Specifically, we inquire to which extent investors will make optimal use\nof information stemming from such stress tests when deciding to provide liquidity\nto banks, e.g. via bank deposits or by purchasing bank bonds. In addition, the\npaper deals with the issue on how to optimally design supervisory macro stress\ntests when the banking supervisor pursue the goal to ensure a macro-economically\noptimal level of banking activities, this by convincing investors to provide the overall\noptimal amount of funding to the banking sector.\nIn our analysis we present a multi-receiver model of a persuasion game. Persua-\nsion games belong to the larger class of cheap talk games. In our model banking\nsupervisors, by making use of macro stress tests, can generate information about\nthe actual stability level of the banking sector. Banking supervisors, however, face a\ncommitment problem when they aim at influencing investors' decisions by disclosure\nof stress tests results. From an investors' point of view, stress test results, which\nare disclosed by banking supervisors, basically do not constitute a reliable form of\ninformation about the true state of the banking system (cheap talk).\nThe game-theoretical analysis of the present paper, however, shows that banking\nsupervisors will optimally design macro stress test in a way that permits them to\ninfluence the decisions of investors to increase social welfare; this by both disclosing\nthe method of the stress tests used as well as the stress test result. We furthermore\nshow that macro stress tests pursued by banking supervisors will always increase the\ninformativeness of the disclosure mechanism. However, banking supervisors should\ngenerally not aim at designing macro stress tests to completely eliminate uncertainty\nat the investors' side as to the actual state of the banking sector. Only this feature\nwill permit supervisors to avoid triggering some possibly extreme forms of investor\nbehavior (such as a complete withdrawal from bank financing, or, in turn, pursuing\nhighly risky financial decisions).\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nDas vorliegende Papier analysiert mit Hilfe eines spieltheoretischen Modells die\nWirkung und optimale Ausgestaltung bankaufsichtlicher Stresstests f\u00a8\nur den gesamten\nBankensektor (Makro-Stresstests).

Since Diamond and Dybvig (1983), scholars\nhave systematically researched how such processes work and what the options are\nfor a banking system to provide adequate forms of liquidity to borrowers. One of the\nmost prominent forms of liquidity provision occurs through maturity transformation,\nby which banks convert securities with short maturities into the long-term forms of\nliquidity that borrowers frequently request.\nIt lies in the very nature of such transformation processes that they come with\na risk: creating liquidity may cause financial fragility, as the banking system may\nbecome unstable when investors do not have the necessary knowledge about bor-\nrowers,2 and this instability may spread throughout the whole banking system.3\nIn this context, it is easy to see why Jaime Caruana, the General Manager of the\nBank for International Settlements, has emphasized in particular that\n\"[...] strengthened, transparent disclosure is good for markets, because\nit helps investors make more informed decisions.\"4\nTransparency is valuable as it improves the information accessible to investors,\nand this increased transparency reduces uncertainty, leading to better risk-adjusted\nbehavior on the investors' side.\nStress tests represent a very prominent form of information disclosure pursued\nby institutional supervisors. The European Banking Authority, the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC) in the U.S., as well as national supervisory authorities\n1We thank participants at the Seminar of the Deutsche Bundesbank in April 2012, the EARIE\n2012 in Rome, and the 2012 meeting of the German Finance Association, our discussants Mikhel\nTombak and Christoph Schmidhammer, as well as G\u00a8\nunther Franke and Eva Schliephake for com-\nments. All remaining errors are ours.\nin the U.K. and in Japan, respectively, have designed and performed a series of new\nstress tests over the past few years. Strikingly, the number of countries publishing\nbank stress tests has increased from 0 to 40 over the past decade.5 An unprecedented\nfact is the frequency by which such macroeconomic stress tests are being performed,\nwhich undoubtedly will shatter the commonly-perceived underestimation of their\nimpact, and one may safely assume that larger and more centralized supervisory\nauthorities will prefer to make more use of such tests rather than less.\nTwo new papers support this view, namely that enhanced transparency through\ndisclosing stress test results is beneficial to financial stability. First, Goldstein and\nSapra (2012), who research the impact of disclosure on ex-ante incentives of banks,\nare strongly in favor of a public disclosure of stress-test results. The authors believe\n\"that \u00ad at least from a financial stability perspective \u00ad the benefits of disclosing\nstress test results are undeniable.\"6\nSecond, an empirical paper by Horvath and Vasco (2012) shows that the degree\nof transparency concerning financial stability has significantly increased since 2000,\nwhich underpins the general viewpoint concerning the value of transparency. More\ninterestingly, they find that greater transparency is beneficial during typical financial\nperiods financial stress is low. Yet, Horvath and Vasco (2012) also detect that greater\ntransparency will increase financial stress when financial systems are undergoing a\ntime of severe distress, in which situations more transparency may lead to adverse\neffects.7 This result is addressed in our paper in a borderline case where the banking\nsector is completely vulnerable. In this special case, disclosure optimally remains\nuninformative.\nIn this light, striving for more transparency has undoubtedly become a central\nissue for a sector that many authors have described as the epitome of an \"opaque\"\nindustry.8 That stress tests will, in general, reduce the inherent degree of opacity in\nthe banking sector, has been emphasized by Peristiani et al. (2010) in their study.\nWhile they see banks as \"neither black boxes nor open books,\" the argument that\nstress tests will generally permit to reduce bank opaqueness can also be found in\nrecent research done by Petrella and Resti (2011) and their analysis of stress tests\nperformed by the European Banking Authority. Significant market reactions reveal\nthat stress tests do help investors make better decisions.\nA clarification is in order. While empirical studies show that stress tests leads to\na reduction of bank opaqueness, opacity is also an issue in central bank's communi-\ncation and monetary policy. Opacity, in this context, seems to remain a generally\naccepted fact to which economists have not added much new insight. For example,\nStein (1989), in an early application of Crawford and Sobel's (1982) seminal article\n7We also thank G\u00a8\nunther Franke for a similar argument.\non strategic information transmission to central bank disclosure policies, has ar-\ngued that in equilibrium, disclosure between a public authority and an uninformed\ninvestor should optimally remain coarse and limited.\nedged instrument. The private information that actors possess may in some situa-\ntions render public information detrimental for a central bank's policy. Disclosing\nall available public (and noisy) information may then lead to suboptimal decision\nmaking, as receivers will put too much weight on the noise in the public information.\nJames and Lawler (2011) confirm the aspect that disclosing too much information\nwill have adverse effects and decrease welfare.9 However, it should be added that\nMorris and Shin's (2002) work has actually opened up an extended discussion, in\nwhich their model has been interpreted as arguing in favor of more transparency, as\nOur explanation is entirely different in its approach. We offer a Bayesian persua-\nsion game with multiple receivers to explain why macro stress tests are performed.\nWe believe that opacity, while at the center of explanations concerning central bank\npolicies over the past decades, cannot account for the specific nature of stress tests.\nBased on the disclosure process that makes use of two pieces of information, we\npropose a new theory that contrasts with earlier work. Macroeconomic stress tests,\nthe way they are perceived by financial markets and the \"dialogue about financial\nstability vulnerabilities\"10 require a new understanding that this paper is set out to\ndeliver.\nWhat we know is that a supervisory agency both discloses the stress test design,\nand the result. It is this property that carries a new viewpoint. Why informed\nsupervisors are willing to disclose multiple pieces of information has, to our best\nknowledge, not been analyzed at all in the context of financial and supervisory dis-\nclosure. We show that a public banking authority can generally \"persuade\" investors\nover a wide range of (prior) beliefs to take actions toward a socially optimal trade-\noff between individual risk bearing and the provision of liquidity to the banking\nsector. By making optimal use of two informational components (the result and\nthe signal-generating process) stress tests will influence a continuum of prudent in-\nvestors toward an optimal and risk-adjusted provision of liquidity to the economy,\nand, in doing so, they increase welfare.\nThe theoretical framework that we develop belongs to a new class of disclo-\nsure games, called Bayesian persuasion games. While still belonging to the larger\nstrand of literature on cheap talk in the tradition of Crawford and Sobel (1982),\npersuasion games lift this literature onto a new level, permitting new insights into\ndisclosure processes between an informed sender and uninformed receivers. Bayesian\n9This, again, contrasts with the findings of Horvath and Vasco (2012).\npersuasion games assume that the sender can, to some extent, control the commu-\nnication environment of the receiver(s). When there is more than just one signal \u00ad\nthat is, when the sender can use the signal-generating process as it takes place in\nstress-testing procedures to deliver additional information to the receiver \u00ad the game\nreveals properties that are much different than those found in standard cheap-talk\ngames. Since he knows that the receivers will update their prior beliefs by using\nBayes' rule, the sender will be willing to perform such a test. This specific feature\npermits the sender to commit to disclose, even when the test results are not known\nto him ex ante. The capability of the sender to commit to such a procedure now\neliminates a well-known drawback of cheap talk games, namely that messages are\narbitrary for a wide range of beliefs, and therefore create strategic complexity.11\nConsequently, the players always face the problem of coordinating on a common\nlanguage. In persuasion games, this problem is eliminated by the fact that now the\nsender creates a \"meaning\" of messages. Because of this property, persuasion games\nnow exhibit commitment power, and the sender no longer needs to best respond to\nany strategy of the receiver(s).12\nThis specific literature on persuasion games13 has been laid out in one seminal\narticle: Kamenica and Gentzkow (2011) (KG hereafter), and this in a setting with\none sender and one receiver. KG show for a wide range of parameters that the\nsender is strictly better off disclosing both pieces of information.\nIn an application different from ours, and with an extension toward a (discrete)\nmulti-receiver setting, Wang (2012) analyzes voting rules in setups with public and\nprivate disclosure. Our paper differs from hers in several ways. We do not analyze\nmajority voting; in our model, every investor's behavior is influenced by the supervi-\nsor. Moreover, we limit our analysis to public signals, that is, we exclude the option\nof the sender to privately disclose different signals to a subset of receivers.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the model, defining\nthe timing of the game, players' preferences and the supervisor's utility function,\nthe investor decisions, and the value of disclosure, treating the issue of Bayesian\nPlausibility in a continuous multi-receiver setting. Section 3 determines the super-\nvisor's problem, deriving conditions for optimal disclosure, studying the benchmark\nof uninformative disclosure, and it expands on some welfare implications. Section 4\nconcludes. The proofs to all lemmas are given in the appendix.\n12Sobel (2010) in his overview shows furthermore that even under arbitrary choices of messages,\ncoordination failures disappear.\n13For a different treatment see Chakraborty and Harbaugh (2011) and their multidimensional\ncheap-talk model without commitment and large biases.\nConsider a setting with two types of agents: a single banking supervisor (sender)\nand a (infinitely) large number of investors (receivers). The supervisor (S) owns a\ntechnology (a stress testing mechanism) that provides him with reliable information\nabout the true status of the banking sector under his control. While information\nacquisition is costly, these costs are fixed and do not depend on the information\nrevealed about the banking sector. We assume a binary state space of the supervi-\nsor's information: either the banking sector is firm / sound (F) or vulnerable (V ),\nmeaning that some adverse situation or crisis hurts the banking sector either only\nmarginally or heavily. We formally summarize this binary state space by  = {F, V }\nwhere  denotes a realization of a certain stress testing exercise. The prior (objec-\ntive) probability distribution over  is Pr(V ) = p and Pr(F) = 1 - p.\nThe investors (R) do not know the state of the banking sector, but they hold\nprior beliefs (b) about the probability that the banking sector is vulnerable. These\npriors may be considered to arise from experiences over past periods, or they may\nbe based on the evaluation of other institutions such as rating agencies. Prior beliefs\nare, hence, considered to be heterogenous among investors.\nWe assume that the total number of investors is infinitely large and can be nor-\nmalized to one. Further, let g(b) denote the continuous function which represents\nthe distribution of prior beliefs over all investors. The corresponding continuous\nfunction G(b) denotes the cumulative distribution function of prior beliefs as well as\nthe number of investors having prior beliefs of, at most, b.\nBased on their individual beliefs, investors make their investment decisions and\nchoose an action in the action space. They decide on their behavior in the banking\nsector. The action space of investors is assumed to be binary as well: investors may\neither act prudently (P) or riskily (R). Prudent behavior means that the investor\nunder consideration believes that the banking sector is vulnerable and is, therefore,\nwilling to provide funding to banks (e.g. by depositing money with banks or by\nbuying bank bonds) only to a minimum amount which is backed by some deposit\ninsurance mechanism or through State guarantees. All investors whose individual\nbeliefs are beyond some threshold probability bT\nbehave this way. Risky behavior,\nin contrast, refers to decisions that result in investors providing much more funds\nto the banking sector than the benchmark would minimally suggest. This latter\nbehavior occurs when investors choose individual beliefs below the threshold proba-\nbility, bT\n. The binary action space will be denoted by A = {P, R} in the following,\nand a denotes a certain realization. The threshold probability bT\nthen defines when\ninvestors prefer to switch from risky to prudent behavior because they believe that\nthe probability that the banking sector is vulnerable is too high.\nWhat essentially follows from these assumptions is that they imply an overall\ndistribution of beliefs, which now determines the total number of investors who\nbehave prudently or riskily, respectively. Specifically, G(bT\n) = Pr(b  bT\n) is the\ntotal number of investors who prefer a risky strategy whereas 1-G(bT\n) = Pr(b > bT\n)\nis the total number of prudent investors given their prior beliefs.\nThe timing of the game is as follows. First, the supervisor chooses an information\ndisclosure mechanism  to induce investors to act in the supervisor's interest. The\ninformation disclosure mechanism consists of two elements: a signal from a binary\nrealization space of the supervisor's stress tests results D  {f, v}, plus a related\nfamily of conditional distributions {|\u00b7}\nover D. The conditional distributions\nfollow the design, result, and accuracy of stress tests. In mathematical terms, the\ndesign of a stress test determines the probabilities of the result d  D, given that\nthe true state of the banking sector is   . That is, we assume that the supervisor\ndoes not cheat on investors about the stress test result. Rather, the stress-test result\nwill be always reported truthfully. Yet the supervisor can design the stress test in\nsuch a way that an incorrect result becomes more or less likely.\nLet (v|V ) ((f|V )) and (f|F) ((v|F)) denote the probabilities that the stress\ntest generates correct (incorrect) results. The stress test design determines the\nfollowing probabilities:\n(v|V )\n(f|V ) = 1 - (v|V )\nand\n(f|F)\n(v|F) = 1 - (f|F)\n.\nIn the next step, the supervisor carries out a stress testing exercise, observes\n(privately) stress test result d  D and reports this result together with the full\ninformation about the stress test's design, i.e. (\u00b7), to investors.\nThe investors, thereafter, observe both the supervisor's choice of the stress test\nmechanism and the stress test realizations to decide on either a prudent or a risky\naction to provide funding to the banking sector.\nAs already mentioned in the introduction, information disclosure in our model\nas well as in KG does not only mean to send out a single message as in standard\nmodels of cheap talk. Instead, disclosure includes information about the signal-\ngenerating process and about the obtained signal as the supervisor in our model\nreveals information to the public about the stress test design (including underlying\nassumption, information regarding the data analysis, and so on) and the outcome\nof the stress test.\nInvestors' preferences strongly depend on making correct investment decisions. For\nsimplicity, let these utilities take values of 1 or 0: each investor receives a utility\nof 1 if he makes the correct decision, UR\n(P, V ) = UR\n(R, F). Otherwise, his utility\nremains UR\n(P, F) = UR\nThe general aim of banking supervisors is the promotion of stability of the bank-\ning sector (cf. BCBS, 2011, para 1). In this regard there are, however, two aspects\nthat a supervisor needs to take into account. First, while acknowledging the eco-\nnomic role of banks in providing financing to private households, firms, and gov-\nernments supervisors are also aware that the banking sector requires funding. The\nbanking literature, in turn, has shown that the structure of banks' balance sheets,\ni.e. using short-term liabilities to fund long-term assets, makes individual banks\nas well as the banking sector as a whole vulnerable to shocks in the financial or\neconomic environment.15 Second, the supervisor is aware of the fact that investors\nsuffer in terms of utility when their investment decisions turn out to be incorrect.\nIt is crucial for an understanding that both aspects are interrelated: information\ndisclosed by the supervisor may cause investor reactions that affect bank funding\nand in this way the stability of the banking sector.\nA supervisor's utility function has therefore to consider both aspects. First, the\nsupervisor is aware of the fact that herding behavior of investors - either too many\ninvestors acting prudently or too many investors acting riskily - may negatively\nimpact the banking sector as a whole. With too many prudent investors banks\nmay face severe funding problems which may in the end make the system even\nmore vulnerable. In turn, with too many investors acting riskily, banks may find\nthemselves in a situation of excess liquidity which may trigger excessive risk taking\nof banks in order to profitably invest available funds. But excessive risk taking will\nalso aggravate the vulnerability of the banking sector.\nAs a result, given the objective probability p of the banking sector being vul-\nnerable, we assume that there exists a certain number of prudent investors |P|max\nthat maximizes the supervisor's utility. That is, for a given p at |P|max there is an\noptimal balance between providing funds to banks and investors' preference for cor-\nrect investment decisions. A higher number of prudent investors, on the one hand,\nmay increase the danger of aggravating the vulnerability of the banking sector by\na shortage of bank funding. On the other hand, fewer prudent investors may also\nincrease the danger of aggravating the banking sector's vulnerability due excessive\n14Although each single investor makes his own decision we do not use an index for a certain\ninvestor. This is only for notational convenience and does not affect results because investors do\nnot differ regarding utility functions.\nrisk taking of banks.\nIn addition, when the supervisor designs the disclosure mechanism (including the\nstress test design), the final outcome of the stress test and therefore the investors'\nresponses to information disclosure, will remain uncertain. The supervisor can only\nform expectations about investor behavior. Therefore we assume in the following that\nthe supervisor's utility function is invariant to the stress test outcome. Furthermore\nthe utility function is considered hill-shaped, reaching a maximum at |P|max and\nbeing zero at the extremes when either all investors act prudently or all investors\nact riskily.\nPut in more formal terms, let US\n(|P|) denote the supervisor's utility as a function\nof the number |P| of prudent investors, i.e. investors who choose a = P.16 The su-\npervisor's utility becomes zero when either all investors act riskily or all investors act\nprudently. Moreover, there exists a number |P|max  (0; 1) where the supervisor's\nutility reaches a maximum Umax\nS\n.17 In sum, we assume the following continuously\ndifferentiable hill-shaped curve representing the supervisor's utility:\nUS\n= US\n(|P|) with US\n(|P|) > (<)0  |P| < (>)|P|max and US\n2.4 Investor beliefs\nBy choosing the appropriate stress test design, the supervisors define the framework\nwhich shows investors - connected to the commitment assumption - how to update\nprior beliefs using Bayes' rule when the stress test shows a specific outcome. As\nin KG, Wang (2011) and Sobel (2010), the supervisor is able to influence investor\nbehavior in a certain way.\nDigression: The Single-Receiver Case (following KG)\nBefore introducing our multi-receiver model, it seems worthwhile to briefly illus-\ntrate the standard persuasion game between a single investor (receiver), who, con-\n16Due to our assumptions, |P| is found by inserting the threshold probability bT\nin the cumulative\ndistribution function of investor beliefs in a given situation. For instance, in the case of a non-\ninformative disclosure mechanism we have |P| = 1 - G(bT\n). In the case of effective information\ndisclosure we have |P| = 1 - ^\nGv\n(bT\n) and |P| = 1 - ^\nGf\n(bT\n) when the supervisor discloses signal\nd = v and d = f, respectively.\n17We do not explicitly consider p to be an argument of US\n(\u00b7) as we earlier assumed that p is given\nexogenously. That is, given the (objective) probability p there exists a socially optimal number of\nprudent investors that maximizes the supervisor's utility. Note that |P|max may change with the\nexogenously given probability p.\nditional on observing that the banking sector is sound (state F), holds prior beliefs\n^\nx = (v|F) and ^\ny = (f|F). In KG, the sender maximizes the overall probability to\nconvince the receiver to change his or her mind about investing:\nmax p^\nx + (1 - p)^\ny\ns.t. ^\n.\nThe informed sender will optimally choose a pair of ^\nx and ^\ny such that the re-\nceiver, upon observing this pair, will update his beliefs toward the following posterior\nprobabilities:\n(V |f) =\nx)p + (1 - ^\n\nand\n(V |v) =\n^\np^\nx + ^\n\nAs a specific situation emerging in the one-receiver KG case, optimality requires\nthat the first Bayes' rule has a zero numerator and updating is impossible. Still, the\nposterior probability is derived from the second Bayes' rule, solving optimally18\np^\nx + (1 - p)^\ny.\nWhat differs in our model from those of KG and Wang (2011) is that each single\ninvestor updates his own beliefs based on individual priors. That is, because we\nconsider a large number of investors with heterogenous prior beliefs, the magnitude\n(but not the direction) of Bayesian updating also differs among investors. Formally\n(|d) denote the posterior belief of an investor with individual prior\nrealization b that the true state of the banking sector is  when the supervisor\ndiscloses d and applies a stress test design {|\u00b7}\n. In particular the posteriors for\nany prior belief b are:\nb\n(V |v) = (v|V )\u00b7b\n(v|V )b+(v|F)(1-b)\nb\n(F|v) = (v|F)\u00b7(1-b)\n(v|V )b+(v|F)(1-b)\nand\nb\n(F|f) = (f|F)\u00b7(1-b)\n(f|V )b+(f|F)(1-b)\nb\n(V |f) = (f|V )\u00b7b\n(f|V )b+(f|F)(1-b)\n18See a detailed description for the multi-receiver case in the next subsection on Bayesian up-\ndating with many receivers.\nwhen the supervisor discloses d = v and d = f, respectively. As a consequence,\nBayesian updating will affect the cumulative distribution function of investors' be-\nliefs. The following subsection describes how the stress test design {|\u00b7}\nand the\nstress test outcome d jointly affect investor beliefs.\n2.4.2 Distribution of investors' posterior beliefs and uncertainty\nSince the stress test design {|\u00b7}\nis public information and does not depend on\nthe prior belief of any single investor, the outcome of the stress tests will affect beliefs\nof all investors to the same direction. Consider the borderline case in which a stress\ntest is completely uninformative. That is, it must be true that b\n(V |v) = b\n(V |f)\nand b\n(F|v) = b\n(F|f) for any b and (v|V ) = (f|V ) = (v|F) = (f|F) = 1\nNow, making the stress test informative - i.e. setting (v|V ) > 1\nand/or (f|F) >\n- works as follows:20\n(v|V ) > 1\n b\n(V |v) > b\n(V |f) and b\n(F|f) > b\n(F|v)  b\nwhere the last part follows from (f|V ) = 1-(v|V ) and the definition of posterior\nbeliefs (2) above. Moreover, perfectly analogously and using the same reasoning we\nnow observe the following:\n b\n(F|f) > b\n(F|v) and b\n(V |v) > b\n(V |f)  b.\nIn a next step, let x  [0, 1\n] denote the level of precision \u00ad ie the\namount by which (v|V ) and (f|F) exceed 1\n\u00ad of the signal d = v and d = f,\nrespectively.\nThese observations already lead to two results. First, although the supervisor\ncan decide about the precision of a certain signal, i.e. d = v and d = f, basically\nseparately, there is an interaction between both. This interaction will make signals\n19Note that (V |v) = (V |f) and (F|v) = (F|f) both require\n(v|F)\n(v|V )\n=\n(f|F)\n(f|V )\n.\nDue to (v|V ) = 1 - (f|V ) and (v|F) = 1 - (f|F) the former condition holds if and only if\n(v|V ) = (f|V ) = (v|F) = (f|F) = 1\n.\nmay occur, we limit our attention to the case with (v|V ) > 1\nin the\ncase of informative disclosure. The reason is twofold: first, (v|V ) > 1\nrefers to a situation of\ntruthful disclosure, which directly translates into investor utility. Second, (v|V ) < 1\nsimply\nmeans that the supervisor is likely to send a signal that is exactly the opposite of the true state.\nSince investors will know the disclosure mechanism, this supervisory strategy will cause investors\nto decide inversely.\nreinforce each other in terms of their precision. As a consequence, posterior beliefs\nare driven by the precision of both signals as well as their interaction. The second\nresult is that the relations hold for any arbitrary prior investor belief b.\nThis gives the model the following interesting twist: when the supervisor's dis-\nclosure mechanism is informative, the public signal d  D will crucially affect the\ncumulative distribution function of posterior beliefs. Therefore, let ^\nGv\n(\u00b7) and ^\nGf\n(\u00b7)\ndenote the cumulative distribution functions of posterior beliefs in the case of signals\nd = v and d = f, respectively. Further, for any b, let us denote ^\nbv\n(b) = b\n(V |v)\nand ^\nbf\n(b) = b\n(V |f) as the respective posterior beliefs that the banking sector is\nvulnerable when signals d = v and d = f are observable. Then, for any b, the above\narguments imply:\n(v|V ) > 1\n ^\nbv\n(b)  b and ^\nbf\n(b) < b  b (3)\n ^\nGv\n(b)  G(b) and ^\nGf\n(b) > G(b)  b. (4)\nand\n ^\nbf\n(b)  b and ^\nbv\n(b) > b  b (5)\n ^\nGf\n(b)  G(b) and ^\nGv\n(b) < G(b)  b. (6)\nIn words: an informative disclosure mechanism increases or decreases the beliefs of\nany single investor relative to his priors, depending on the disclosed signal \u00ad this is\nwhat (3) and (5) reveal. As a result, we have for the aggregate setting, depending\non the supervisor's signal, that information disclosure now shifts mass to the left\ntail or to the right tail of the cumulative distribution function \u00ad see (4) and (6). We\nsummarize these findings as follows:\nLemma 1 Informative disclosure by the supervisor shifts the cumulative distribu-\ntion function of investors' beliefs in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance\n(FSD). The signal v (f) deteriorates (improves) the cumulative distribution function\nof investor beliefs in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance (FSD) compared\nto the prior distribution.\nProof: See the appendix.\nNote in particular that the FSD shift of the cumulative distribution functions\nmay be formally written as\n ^\nGv\n(b|x, y)\nx\n ^\nGv\n(b|x, y)\ny\n ^\nGf\n(b|x, y)\nx\n ^\nGf\n(b|x, y)\ny\nThe FSD shift and the finding that the direction of the FSD shift depends on\nthe stress test outcome d have an important implication regarding the supervisor's\ndecision environment: Implementing an informative stress testing mechanism re-\nplaces the certain decision-making situation of the supervisor with an uncertain one.\nRecall that the supervisor does not know the true state of the banking sector at\nthe time when he decides on the optimal stress testing mechanism. Therefore, the\nsupervisor faces uncertainty about the signal to be sent to investors in a later stage\nof the game. In the case of an uninformative stress testing mechanism this fact,\nhowever, is irrelevant for the supervisor. In this latter case, investors will decide\nbased on their prior beliefs, which implies that the supervisor knows the number of\nprudent investors with certainty. In contrast, in a situation of informative disclosure\nthe stress test outcome d determines the direction the investors' beliefs shift and, as\na result, the number of prudent investors. As the stress test outcome d is unknown\nat the time when the stress test mechanism is designed, the supervisor creates an\nenvironment of uncertainty regarding the effective number of prudent investors.\nTo summarize: when designing an informative disclosure mechanism, the supervi-\nsor actually replaces a certain decision-making situation with an uncertain decision-\nmaking situation (disclosure lottery). Whether this is valuable depends on both\nthe supervisor's utility function and the level of expected utility generated by the\ndisclosure lottery, relative to the utility of the certain situation with uninformative\ndisclosure. In what follows, we analyze this property in great detail.\nInvestors, in general, have to choose an action out of their action space A = {P, R}\nin order to maximize individual expected utility. Let, as a general representation,\nPri\n(V ) and Pri\n(F) denote the individual probabilities (beliefs) of an arbitrary in-\nvestor i that the true state of the banking system is vulnerable (V ) or firm (F).\nThen investor i's expected utility of choosing prudent behavior (a = P) or risky\nbehavior (a = R) is\n(a = P)) = Pri\n(V )UR\n(P, V ) + Pri\n(P, F) = Pri\nor\n(a = R)) = Pri\n(V )UR\n(R, V ) + Pri\n(R, F) = Pri\nrespectively, because of UR\n(P, V ) = UR\n(R, F) = 1 and UR\n(P, F) = UR\n(R, V ) = 0.\nFrom expected utilities (9) and (10) it is easily verified that an arbitrary investor\ni is indifferent between a = P and a = R if and only if Pri\n(V ) = Pri\n. As\na consequence, any investor who believes that Pri\nwill choose a = R, and\nany investor who thinks that Pri\nwill choose a = P. In other words: the\nthreshold probability bT\nthat we mentioned earlier, which defines when investors\nswitch from a risky to a prudent strategy is unambiguously\nbT\n.\nSpecifically, it is irrelevant in this context whether investors revert to their prior\nbeliefs for decision making or whether they update and build posterior beliefs. The\nmode of decision making is unaffected by setting Pri\n(V ) = b, Pri\n(V ) = ^\nbv\n(b), or\nPri\n(V ) = ^\nbf\n(b). Therefore, it must be true that bT\nis constant, regardless of\nthe information disclosed by the supervisor.\nSupervisory information disclosure, however, may affect the level of expected\ninvestor utility. In the previous subsection (Lemma 1) we found that an informative\ndisclosure mechanism causes ^\nbv\n(b)  b  b when the supervisor sends a signal d = v,\nand ^\nbf\n(b)  b  b when the supervisor's signal is d = f. That is, in the case\nwhere d = v, any investor's expected utility when deciding prudently increases,\ncompared to the situation without supervisory information disclosure. Instead, when\nsupervisor sends d = f, any investor's expected utility of prudent behavior will\ndecrease. Therefore, on one hand, investors may prefer to adjust their investment\ndecisions according to the signal received. The supervisor, on the other, is able to\naffect the investors' expected utility and their choice of actions in the desired way\nby applying an optimally designed disclosure mechanism.\n2.4.4 Bayesian Plausibility and the value of informative disclosure\nThe standard persuasion literature, which considers games with a single sender and a\nsingle receiver, argues that Bayesian Plausibility (BP) is the only restriction imposed\non a sender's mechanism.21 This implies that the expected posteriors must be equal\nto the objective probability of a specific situation, in an immediate and simple way,\nas already illustrated in the digression above.\nThe present model now adds a special twist to the basic setup: with an infinitely\nlarge number of investors and with heterogenous prior beliefs, we are now able to\ngeneralize BP to find an equilibrium condition. This becomes evident by taking a\ncloser look at the formal representation of BP for the single investor (receiver) case:\nb\n(V |v)Pr(v) + b\n(V |f)Pr(f) = p (11)\nwith Pr(v) = (v|V ) \u00b7 p + (v|F) \u00b7 (1 - p) and Pr(f) = (f|V ) \u00b7 p + (f|F) \u00b7 (1 - p).\nAlthough (11) is written for an arbitrary realization b of investors' prior beliefs,\nit can be shown that (11) does not hold for all (heterogenous) b simultaneously.\nCalculating the posterior beliefs and taking into account the previous definition of\nprecision of the supervisor's disclosure mechanism, we can rewrite (11)22\n+ x) b\n- (y - p(x + y))\n- (y - b(x + y))\n- x) b\n+ (y - p(x + y))\n+ (y - b(x + y))\nRecall that in the basic persuasion model of KG, Bayesian Plausibility (11) re-\nquires that posterior beliefs need to be unbiased in expected terms. That is, for a\npersuasion mechanism to work properly, the sender needs to make sure that be-\nliefs are not distorted in a way such that receivers would suffer a welfare loss from\nacting according to information disclosed. Note that the left-hand side of (11) - ie\nb\n(V |v)Pr(v) + b\n(V |f)Pr(f) - represents the (single) receiver's expected utility in\nthe case of prudent behavior.23 If persuasion increases (decreases) this term beyond\n(below) the objective probability p, prudent behavior becomes more (less) attractive\nfor a (single) investor. However, due to the distortion, an investor will find himself\nex post too often in a situation where his initial decision proves to be incorrect. The\nreceiver then realizes UR\n(P, F) = 0 or UR\n(R, V ) = 0 instead of UR\n(P, V ) = 1 or\nUR\n(R, F) = 1 \u00ad compared to decision-making based on prior beliefs when ignoring\nthe supervisor's information.\nHowever - and here we differ from the literature such as Wang's (2011) voting\nmodel - this cannot hold for every single investor when there are many investors\nwith heterogenous prior beliefs and when the supervisor's disclosure mechanism is\npublicly known, i.e. (x, y) stays the same for all investors. In this situation (11) -\nor (12) for our particular situation - can only hold for an investor whose prior belief\nb is exactly identical to the objective probability p of a vulnerable banking sector.\nThat is, except for this latter investor, individual prior beliefs of all other investors\nwill appear more or less distorted compared to the objective probability p.\nFor instance, all investors with b < (>)p believe that the probability of a vulner-\nable banking sector is lower (higher) than p. For all these \"distorted\" investors, an\ninformative disclosure mechanism may correct their individual distortions to some\n22Due to previous definitions we have:\nb\n(V |v) =\n+ x) b\n+ x) b + (1\n- y) (1 - b)\n=\n+ x) b\n- (y - b(x + y))\nb\n(V |f) =\n- x) b\n- x) b + (1\n+ y) (1 - b)\n=\n- x) b\n+ (y - b(x + y))\nPr(v) = (1\n+ x) p + (1\n- (y - p(x + y))\nPr(f) = (1\n- x) p + (1\n+ (y - p(x + y)).\n23In section 2.4.3 it was shown that an investor's utility of a specific action a is given by the\n(posterior) belief regarding the status of the banking sector.\ndegree. Put differently: an informative disclosure mechanism of the supervisor gen-\nerates expected posterior beliefs that are higher (lower) than the individual priors\nof investors in the case of b < p (b > p). We so state and prove\nLemma 2 Bayesian Plausibility in our model with multiple investors (receivers)\nand heterogenous investor prior beliefs requires\nb\n(V |v)Pr(v) + b\n(V |f)Pr(f) = p  b = p.\nProof: See the Appendix.\nFrom the investors' point of view information disclosure suggests that their indi-\nvidual priors understate or overstate the probability of a vulnerable banking sector\nin the case of b < p or b > p, respectively:\n+ x) b\n- (y - p(x + y))\n- (y - b(x + y))\n- x) b\n+ (y - p(x + y))\n+ (y - b(x + y))\nor\n+ x) b\n- (y - p(x + y))\n- (y - b(x + y))\n- x) b\n+ (y - p(x + y))\n+ (y - b(x + y))\n< b  b > p.\nFor these \"distorted\" investors, the supervisor's disclosure mechanism now corrects\n(part of) this distortion of prior beliefs in a way that investor beliefs move toward the\ntrue probability of a vulnerable banking sector. As a consequence, information disclo-\nsure helps investors to make correct investment decisions. Against this background,\nthe value of an informative disclosure mechanism for investors becomes evident:\nCorollary 3 A disclosure mechanism that is Bayesian plausible according to Lemma\n2 raises the expected utility of investors whose prior beliefs deviate from the objective\nprobability of a vulnerable banking sector.\nProof: Note that the left-hand side of (12) represents an investor's expected\nutility from behaving prudently, acting according to the supervisor's information\ndisclosure, and having prior belief b. Under a Bayesian plausible disclosure mech-\nanism, then, from the proof of Lemma 2 it is immediately clear that informative\ndisclosure by the supervisor increases the expected utility of prudent behavior for\nall investors who understate the probability of the banking sector being vulnerable\n(b < p). That is, informative disclosure better aligns the evaluations of latter in-\nvestors with the true state of the banking system. Moreover, informative disclosure\ncauses investors with b\n> b to switch from a risky to a prudent investment\nstrategy.\nThe opposite effect appears to be the case with investors whose priors overstate\nthe true vulnerability of the banking sector. Their expected utility from prudent\nbehavior decreases under a Bayesian plausible disclosure mechanism (see proof of\nLemma 2). As a result, investors with b\n(V |v) < 1\n b switch from a prudent to a\nrisky investment strategy.\nFor both situations, the proof of Lemma 2 (see Appendix B) shows that under\na Bayesian-plausible disclosure mechanism the expected utility of those investors,\nwhich change their investment strategy in response to supervisory disclosure, will\nincrease.\nIn other words, under a Bayesian plausible disclosure mechanism, \"distorted\"\ninvestors' expected utility will increase when they base their decisions on supervisory\ninformation instead of prior beliefs. This result is novel to the literature on the\ndisclosure of supervisory information in the banking sector.\n3 Optimal disclosure\nWe now turn to optimality analysis. We now ask whether the supervisor should\noptimally implement an informative stress testing (disclosure) mechanism. For this\npurpose, we first state the supervisor's optimization problem before, and then the\nexistence of an informative disclosure mechanism, to derive some welfare implica-\ntions.\n3.1 The supervisor's problem\nThe supervisor's goal is to maximize his utility while taking into account all the\nfactors that were analyzed in the previous sections. Note that the supervisor's\nutility function, has a unique maximum when the number of prudent investors is\nexactly |P|max. Therefore, when the supervisor finds himself in a situation where\nthe investors' prior beliefs result in24\n),\nthe supervisor will refrain from implementing any informative disclosure mechanism\nas this cannot increase his utility.\nIn the following we consider situations when prior beliefs generate numbers of\nprudent investors which deviate from |P|max. In this context there are two possibil-\nities: either we have 1-G(1\n) < |P|max (case a)) or we have 1-G(1\n) > |P|max (case\n24Note that in section 2.4.3 we argued that the unique threshold when investors switch from a\nrisky to a prudent investment strategy is bT\n.\nb)). Against this background the supervisor's objective is to design an informa-\ntive disclosure mechanism \u00ad by choosing x and y \u00ad such that the distance between\nthe supervisor's maximum utility and the expected utility realized by informative\ndisclosure is minimized:\nmin\nx,y\nUS\n Pr(v) Umax\nS\n- US\nGv\n)) + Pr(f) Umax\nS\n- US\nGf\n))\nwith Pr(v) = (1\n+ x) p + (1\n- y) (1 - p)\nPr(f) = (1\n- x) p + (1\n).\nRecall that, in optimization problem (15), Umax\nS\ndenotes the supervisor's maximum\npossible utility, which is achieved when 1 - G(1\n) = |P|max. Furthermore 1 - ^\nGv\n)\nGf\n) denote the number of prudent investors when the supervisor sends\nsignals d = v and d = f, respectively. Bayesian Plausibility is implicitly considered\nin the cumulative distribution functions of the investors' posterior beliefs ^\nGv\n(\u00b7) and\n^\nGf\n3.2 Optimality of informative disclosure\nThe analysis of optimal information disclosure starts with the derivation of the first-\norder necessary conditions of optimization problem (15):\nUS\nx\n= p Umax\nS\n- US\nGv\n)) - p Umax\nS\n- US\nGf\n)) +\n+Pr(v)US\nGv\n))\n ^\nGv\n)\nx\n+ Pr(f)US\nGf\n))\n ^\nGf\n)\nx\nUS\ny\n= -(1 - p) Umax\nS\n- US\nGv\n)) + (1 - p) Umax\nS\n- US\nGf\n)) +\n+Pr(v)US\nGv\n))\n ^\nGv\n)\ny\n+ Pr(f)US\nGf\n))\n ^\nGf\n)\ny\nThe following considerations, which are essential to our analysis, build on a num-\nber of insights regarding cumulative distribution functions ^\nGv\nand ^\nGf\nto which we\nrefer in great detail in section 2.4.2 as well as in the Appendix. First, it should\nbe noted that the numbers of prudent investors are determined by the cumulative\ndistribution functions of prior and posterior beliefs and that \u00ad due to the features\nof these functions \u00ad the following relation always holds:\nGf\nGv\n).\n25See the Appendix for a formal proof.\nSecond, for the partial derivatives of the cumulative distribution functions of investor\nbeliefs setting  = 1\n(see appendix) yields\n ^\n)\nx\n-y\n-y\n ^\n)\ny\n-y\n+x\nand\n ^\n)\nx\n+y\n+y\n ^\n)\ny\n+y\n-x\nwith\n ^\n)\ny\n<  ^\n)\nx\n)\nx\n>  ^\n)\ny\nWe are now able to derive the following lemma from the first-order necessary\nLemma 4 It is never optimal for the supervisor to implement an informative dis-\nclosure mechanism that either shifts 1 - ^\nGv\n) beyond |P|max in case a), i.e. in the\n) < |P|max, or that shifts 1 - ^\nGf\n) below |P|max in case b), i.e.\nin the case when 1 - G(1\n) > |P|max.\nIn words: it is not optimal for the supervisor to disclose information in a way that in\nthe case of a signal d = f the number of prudent investors is below |P|max, whereas\nin the case of the signal d = v the number of prudent investors is beyond |P|max.\nProof: Assume, to the contrary, that the informative disclosure mechanism causes\nGf\n) < |P|max and 1 - ^\nGv\n) > |P|max.

Then, for the first-order condition (16) to hold\nUmax\nS\n- US\nGv\n)) < Umax\nS\n- US\nGf\n))\nis required to hold because of relations (19) and Pr(v), Pr(f) > 0.\nAnalogous reasoning for the other first-order condition (17), reveals that this\nholds only if\nUmax\nS\n- US\nGv\n)) > Umax\nS\n- US\nGf\n)),\na contradiction. Therefore, it must be true that an optimal disclosure mechanism\nensures 1 - ^\nGf\nGv\n)  |P|max in case of 1 - G(1\n) < |P|max and |P|max \nGf\nGv\n) in case of 1 - G(1\n) > |P|max.\nBuilding on the above lemma, we now state our main result in the following propo-\nsition:\nProposition 1 In either case, i.e. in case a) as well as in case b), there exists an\nunique optimum (x, y) with 0 < x, y < 1\n. In other words, in the case where\n) < |P|max as well as in the case where 1 - G(1\n) > |P|max there exists\nan informative (but not fully revealing) disclosure mechanism that minimizes the\ndistance between the supervisor's maximum utility and the expected utility arising\nfrom informative disclosure.\nProof: Consider case a) first. If the disclosure mechanism is informative, it is\neasy to see that by the first result above we have 1 - ^\nGf\n^\nGv\n)  |P|max must be true. The corresponding utilities for the supervisor are,\nthen, ranked US\nGf\n)) < US\n)) < US\nGv\n))  Umax\nS\n.

Therefore,\nthe first-order condition (16) hold if and only if\nPr(v)US\nGv\n))\n ^\nGv\n)\nx\n+ Pr(f)US\nGf\n))\n ^\nGf\n)\nx\nand the first-order conditions (17) holds if and only if\nPr(v)US\nGv\n))\n ^\nGv\n)\ny\n+ Pr(f)US\nGf\n))\n ^\nGf\n)\ny\nThese conditions, however, are not contradictory since relations (18) and U\nS\n^\nGv\n)), U\nS\nGf\n)) > 0 in the present case imply\n0  Pr(v)US\nGv\n))\n ^\nGv\n)\nx\n> Pr(v)US\nGv\n))\n ^\nGv\n)\ny\nand\n0  Pr(f)US\nGf\n))\n ^\nGf\n)\ny\n< Pr(f)US\nGf\n))\n ^\nGf\n)\nx\n.\nFor case b) the proof is analogous to the that of case a). The only difference with\nthe previous case is that the relationships between terms are reversed and marginal\nutilities are negative, i.e. U\nS\nGv\n)), U\nS\nGf\nLastly, it follows immediately from Lemma 1 that the optimal disclosure mech-\nanism cannot be fully revealing, ie (x, y) = (1\n): a fully revealing disclosure\nmechanism implies that 1 - ^\nGf\n) = 0 < |P|max and 1 - ^\nGv\n) = 1 > |P|max. Using\nLemma 1, it is easy to see that this cannot be optimal.\nIn the previous analysis we have excluded corner solutions, limiting p to values of\nless then 1. Our former results are valid as long as there is no crisis going on in the\nbanking sector. For the case when the banking sector is hurt by a systemic crisis, we\ncan easily show that the supervisor will not anymore apply an informative disclosure\nmechanism. When the banking sector is hit by a crisis, the objective probability of\na vulnerable banking sector will approach unity.\nTo illustrate, let p = 1, from which Pr(v) = (v|V ) and Pr(f) = (f|F).\nMoreover, using equation (2) we find that b\n(V |v) = 1 and b\n(V |f) = 1 for investors'\nposterior beliefs when b = p = 1. Applying Bayesian Plausibility (equation (11) and\nLemma 2) now requires Pr(v) = (v|V ) = 1\nand Pr(f) = (f|F) = 1\n. This\nimplies that Pr(v) = (f|V ) = 1\nand Pr(f) = (v|F) = 1\n. The outcome in\ncase of an ongoing banking crisis is that the supervisor's disclosure will optimally\nhave to remain uninformative \u00ad a result perfectly in line with a number of recent\nobservations made during the subprime crisis of 2007-2009, as well as during the\nOur welfare implications follow immediately from Proposition 1 and Corollary 3. Re-\ncall that in Section 2 we argued that due to Bayesian Plausibility and the investors'\ndecision-making process, investors either gain from information disclosure or realize\nat least the same utility as in a situation without informative disclosure. Moreover,\nsupervisors always gain as there exists an optimal informative disclosure mechanism\nthat minimizes the distance between the supervisor's maximum\npossible utility (for a given objective probability p) and the expected utility arising\nfrom informative disclosure, which has been shown above in section 3. In sum, total\nwelfare increases as a consequence of the supervisor's optimal information disclosure\nmechanism.\n4 Conclusion\nThe goal of this paper is to deliver a rationale for macro stress tests and to explain\nwhy public supervisors use such a design. We so shed new light on the discussion\non transparency and financial stability, which is central to the current financial\ndebate. The paper has shown that disclosing two pieces of information, namely the\nsignal generating process together with a signal, permits institutional supervisors (or\nbanking authorities) to persuade investors (Bayesian receivers) to act in a welfare-\nenhancing way. Our paper shows that to optimally design a stress test (disclosure)\nmechanism for a continuum of investors, public supervisors will recur to a variety\nof stress tests and disclose their information to the public, to capture the varying\nperformance of the underlying banking sector.\nThe disclosure mechanism that we offer reveals some attractive features. It shows\na unique interior optimum plus other valuable properties that permit a novel expla-\nnation why disclosure processes in the banking sector are designed the way they are.\nSpecifically, our results tell practitioners that the design of disclosure mechanisms\nsuch as macro stress tests will induce Bayesian investors to update their beliefs in a\ndirection consistent with the banking authority. In addition, we have shown that for\nthe borderline case of a systemic crisis, disclosure should be optimally uninformative.\nWhile our results are robust and applicable to a wider range of real-world situ-\nations, it seems worthwhile to mention related research that this paper may open\nup and complement, while pointing out differences that may lead to new avenues of\nresearch. Note first that in our model, and different from Wang (2012), disclosure is\nalways welfare enhancing. Typically, in our multi-receiver setting and different from\nKG, the sender will never use a value of zero for one of the parameters x and y.\nThat is, every signal carries additional information. With one of the two parameters\nset to zero, information would only be conveyed indirectly as solely the remaining\nparameter can change the distribution of posterior beliefs.\nOur setting can also be extended to include banks as players, which may then be\ndifferentiated along a new (type-) dimension. In such a model, the supervisor would\nbecome the middleman. One possible advantage of such a setup would consist in the\noption to segment the investment market according to bank types and investor types,\ninvolving even more differentiated disclosure processes handled by the supervisor.\nNeedless to say, such a treatment would come at the cost of reduced tractability.\nGiven the already high degree of complexity that we have reached so far, we will\nleave this avenue, as well, for future research.\nA Proof of Lemma 1: FSD shift of investor beliefs\ndistribution\nConsider the posteriors of any investor with any prior belief b\n^\nbv\n(b) = b\n(V |v) =\n+ x) b\n+ x) b + (1\n- y) (1 - b)\n^\nbf\n(b) = b\n(V |f) =\n- x) b\n- x) b + (1\n+ y) (1 - b)\nwhere we used the notion of signal precision as defined in section 2.4.2.

As a result, a higher level of x implies, ceteris paribus, ^\nbv\n(b)  b and\n^\nbf\n(b) < b for any b whereas a higher level of y implies, ceteris paribus, ^\nbv\n(b) > b and\n^\nbf\n(b)  b for any b. That is, from a formal perspective the disclosure mechanism\n(D, {|\u00b7}\n) is a monotonic transformation of investor beliefs.27\nLet us now denote ^\ngv\n(b) and ^\ngf\n(b) the distribution functions of investors' posterior\nbeliefs when the supervisor sends d = v and d = f, respectively. Given the impact\nof the signaling mechanism on investor beliefs above, the distribution functions of\nposteriors can be determined to be:\n^\ngv\n(b) : ^\nbv\n^\ngf\n(b) : ^\nbf\nThe corresponding cumulative distribution functions are, by definition,\n^\nGv\n() =\n\n^\ngv\n(^\nbv\n(b))d^\nbv\n(b)\n^\nGf\n() =\n\n^\ngf\n(^\nbf\n(b))d^\nbf\n(b).\nApplying the definitions of ^\nbv\n(b) and ^\nbf\n(b) above allows for the calculation of these\ncumulative distribution functions based on the distribution of prior beliefs:\n^\nGv\n() =\n-y)\n-y)\n^\nGf\n() =\n+y)\n+y)\n27Note that x and y reinforce each other regarding the impact on investor posteriors when a\ncertain signal is received.\n] represent param-\neters which determine the upper limit of the integrals. Therefore the cumulative\ndistributions may be considered to be conditional on x and y, denoted\n^\nGv\n()  ^\nGv\n(|x, y) and ^\nGf\n()  ^\nGf\n(|x, y)  .\nSecond, the impact of x and y on the cumulative distributions of posteriors at any\n  [0, 1] can be determined by calculating the partial derivatives:\n ^\nGv\n(|x, y)\nx\n= -g\n- y) \n- y) \n- y) (1 - )\n ^\nGv\n(|x, y)\ny\n= -g\n- y) \n- y) \n+ x) (1 - )\n ^\nGf\n(|x, y)\nx\n= g\n+ y) \n+ y) \n+ y) (1 - )\n ^\nGf\n(|x, y)\ny\n= g\n+ y) \n+ y) \n- x) (1 - )\nwhere die inequalities follow from g(\u00b7) > 0, x, y  [0, 1\nB Proof of Lemma 2: Bayesian Plausibility\nLet bBP\ndenote the prior belief of the investor for which (12) holds.\nConsider the situation b < bBP\nfirst. For a given decision (x, y) of the supervisor\nwe observe y - b(x + y) > y - bBP\n(x + y) which implies 1\n- (y - b(x + y)) <\n- (y - bBP\n(x + y)) and 1\n+ (y - b(x + y)) > 1\n+ (y - bBP\n(x + y)). For the fraction\nterms in (12) we therefore find\n- (y - p(x + y))\n- (y - b(x + y))\n>\n- (y - p(x + y))\n- (y - bBP\n(x + y))\nand\n+ (y - p(x + y))\n+ (y - b(x + y))\n<\n+ (y - p(x + y))\n+ (y - bBP\n(x + y))\n.\n+ x) b  (1\n- x) b \u00ad and note that b  [0, 1] and x  [0, 1\n] \u00ad we have\n+ x) b\n- (y - p(x + y))\n- (y - b(x + y))\n- x) b\n+ (y - p(x + y))\n+ (y - b(x + y))\n> b  b < bBP\n.\nRegarding the situation b > bBP\nthe arguments are analogous but the previous\nrelations turn in the opposite direction. That is, for a given decision (x, y) we\nobserve y - b(x + y) < y - bBP\n(x + y), 1\n- (y - b(x + y)) > 1\n- (y - bBP\n(x + y)) and\n+ (y - b(x + y)) < 1\n+ (y - bBP\n(x + y)). As a consequence the relations between\nthe fraction terms in (12) are:\n- (y - p(x + y))\n- (y - b(x + y))\n<\n- (y - p(x + y))\n- (y - bBP\n(x + y))\nand\n+ (y - p(x + y))\n+ (y - b(x + y))\n>\n+ (y - p(x + y))\n+ (y - bBP\n(x + y))\n.\n+ x) b  (1\n- x) b we finally have in the current situation:\n+ x) b\n- (y - p(x + y))\n- (y - b(x + y))\n- x) b\n+ (y - p(x + y))\n+ (y - b(x + y))\n< b  b > bBP\n.\nMoreover, the above arguments actually prove that bBP\n= p is the only feasible\nopportunity to make persuasion work: Note that for (x, y) = (0, 0) Bayesian Plausi-\nbility (12) holds for any possible b. This is trivial because (x, y) = (0, 0) means that\nthe disclosure mechanism is completely non-informative and investors' posteriors are\nequivalent to their prior beliefs.\nConversely, in the case where (x, y) = (0, 0) it is easily verified that Bayesian\nPlausibility (to reach a high degree of transparency) holds if and only if\n- (y - p(x + y))\n- (y - b(x + y))\n=\n+ (y - p(x + y))\n+ (y - b(x + y))\nwhich requires b = p to hold. In words: in the current context Bayesian Plausi-\nbility needs to be met only for an investor whose prior belief b equals the objective\nprobability for a vulnerable banking sector p.\nC Bayesian Plausibility in the supervisor's opti-\nmization problem\nConsider the supervisor's problem in an explicit form, i.e. including the Bayesian\nPlausibility constraint (BP):\nmin\nx,y\nUS\n Pr(v) Umax\nS\n- US\nGv\n)) + Pr(f) Umax\nS\n- US\nGf\n))\nwith Pr(v)^\nbv\n(p) + Pr(f)^\nbf\n(p) = p (BP)\nPr(v) = (1\n+ x) p + (1\n- y) (1 - p)\nPr(f) = (1\n- x) p + (1\n].\nStarting from the corresponding Lagrangean\nL = Pr(v) Umax\nS\n- US\nGv\n)) + Pr(f) Umax\nS\n- US\nGf\n)) +\n+ Pr(v)^\nbv\n(p) + Pr(f)^\nbf\n(p) - p\nand using the Kuhn-Tucker Theorem yields the following first-order necessary con-\nditions:\nL\nx\n= p Umax\nS\n- US\nGv\n)) - p Umax\nS\n- US\nGf\n) +\n+Pr(v)US\nGv\n))\n ^\nGv\n)\nx\n+ Pr(f)US\nGf\n))\n ^\nGf\n)\nx\n+\n+ p^\nbv\n(p) + Pr(v)\n^\nbv\n(p)\nx\n- p^\nbf\n(p) + Pr(f)\n^\nbf\n(p)\nx\nL\nx\nL\ny\n= -(1 - p) Umax\nS\n- US\nGv\n)) + (1 - p) Umax\nS\n- US\nGf\n) +\n+Pr(v)US\nGv\n))\n ^\nGv\n)\ny\n+ Pr(f)US\nGf\n))\n ^\nGf\n)\ny\n+\n+ -(1 - p)^\nbv\n(p) + Pr(v)\n^\nbv\n(p)\ny\n+ (1 - p)^\nbf\n(p) + Pr(f)\n^\nbf\n(p)\ny\nL\ny\nL\n\n= Pr(v)^\nbv\n(p) + Pr(f)^\nbf\nInspection of terms in square brackets in (25) and (26), which are the derivatives\nof (BP), shows that they both equal zero: using the explicit formulations of Pr(v),\nPr(f), ^\nbv\n(p), ^\nbf\n(p), ^\nbv(p)\nx\n, ^\nbf (p)\nx\n, ^\nbv(p)\ny\n, and ^\nbf (p)\ny\n(see the proof of Lemma 1) yields\np^\nbv\n(p) + Pr(v)\n^\nbv\n(p)\nx\n- p^\nbf\n(p) + Pr(f)\n^\nbf\n(p)\nx\n=\n= p\n+ x)p + (1\n- y)(1 - p)\n+ x)p + (1\n- y)(1 - p)\n-\n- x)p + (1\n+ y)(1 - p)\n- x)p + (1\n+ y)(1 - p)\n=\nand\nbv\n(p) + Pr(v)\n^\nbv\n(p)\ny\n+ (1 - p)^\nbf\n(p) + Pr(f)\n^\nbf\n(p)\ny\n=\n= -(1 - p)\n+ x)p - (1\n+ x)p\n+ x)p + (1\n- y)(1 - p)\n-\n- x)p - (1\n- x)p\n- x)p + (1\n+ y)(1 - p)\n=\ndue to p  (0, 1). Including Bayesian Plausibility (BP) in the supervisor's optimiza-\ntion problem, hence, does not affect the relevant first-order necessary conditions for\nthe optimum. Rather, calculations show that the probability distributions already\ncomprise the crucial features of (BP).\nReferences\nAllen, Franklin and Gale, Douglas (2000), \"Financial Contagion.\" Journal of\nBCBS, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2011),\"Basel III: A Global\nRegulatory Framework For More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems.\" Bank for\nInternational Settlements, Basel.\nBorio, Claudio, Drehmann, Mathias and Tsatsaronis, Kostas (2012),\"Stress-\ntesting macro stress tests: does it live up to expectations?\" Bank for International\nSettlement, BIS Working Paper 269.\nCaruana, Jaime (2011), \"Financial Stability and Risk Disclosure.\" Keynote Speech\nto the FSB Roundtable on Risk Disclosure, Basel, December 9, 2011.\nChakraborty, Archishman, and Harbaugh, Rick (2010),\"Persuasion by Cheap\nCrawford, Vincent P., and Sobel, Joel (1982), \"Strategic Information Trans-\nDiamond, Douglas (2011), \"Liquidity, Banks, and Markets.\" Journal of Political\nDiamond, Douglas and Dybvig, Philip (1983), \"Bank Runs, Deposit Insur-\nDiamond, Douglas and Rajan, Raghuram (2001), \"Liquidity Risk, Liquid-\nity Creation, and Financial Fragility: A Theory of Banking.\" Journal of Political\nFreixas, Xavier and Rochet, Jean-Jacques (2008), Microeconomics of Bank-\ning, 2nd edition, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.\nGoldstein, Itay, and Sapra, Haresh (2012), \"Should Bank's Stress Test Results\nBe Disclosed?
