This means that investors buy mutual funds that had a high return in\nthe past. On the other hand, investors are reluctant to withdraw their money from the\nworst performing funds. This behavior has often been attributed to the irrationality of\nmutual fund investors, but there are also rational explanations for this investor behavior,\nsuch as the model of Berk and Green (2004).\nThe rational explanation by Berk and Green states that sophisticated investors chase\nperformance in order to find managerial ability. But since managerial ability has decreas-\ning economies of scale, fund performance deteriorates when inflows occur. This explains\nwhy it is rational to chase past performance even though performance is not persistent.\nThe fact that some investors do not withdraw their money is explained by \"disadvantaged\nclienteles\" in mutual funds, i.e. investors who are unwilling or hindered by restrictions to\nfollow a performance chasing strategy.\nThis paper investigates whether there are such disadvantaged clienteles in mutual\nfunds. A unique data set, the Securities Deposits Statistics of the Deutsche Bundesbank,\nallows me to differentiate not only between retail and institutional investors, but also\nbetween different institutional investors such as financial corporations as well as insur-\nance companies and pension funds. These investor groups are likely to differ in their\nbehavior when buying and selling mutual fund shares. The main findings of this paper\nare as follows: First, financial corporations show a strong tendency to chase past perfor-\nmance. Second, there is some evidence that insurance corporations and pension funds\nchase performance, although not as strongly as financial corporations. Furthermore, in-\nsurance companies and pension funds do not invest in all mutual funds in the sample.\nInsurance companies and pension funds tend to invest in larger, older and less volatile\nfunds, which results in the fact that insurance companies and pension funds hold only a\nlower fraction in the top performing funds. The difference between the two institutional\ninvestor groups can be explained by additional regulations for insurance companies and\npension funds, which makes these investors institutionally disadvantaged. Third, evidence\nfor retail investors is mixed. Households chase past winners to some extent, but compared\nto financial corporations the inflows to top performing funds are considerably smaller in\nsize. Furthermore, retail flows show a significant first-order autocorrelation, while insti-\ntutional investors do not. This autocorrelation pattern in retail flows can be caused by\nadvertising of the funds, savings plans or by status quo bias of the investors. Both flows\ndue to advertising and status quo bias are associated with unsophisticated investors or\ndisadvantaged investors.\nThese results are consistent with the Berk-Green model. In particular the result that\ninstitutional investors chase past performance is of interest, since performance chasing is\nmostly associated with uneducated or irrational investors. Finally, the paper investigates\nwhether investor groups differ in their behavior of punishing mutual fund managers by\nwithdrawing their money from poorly performing funds. There is no clear evidence that\none investor group punishes poor performance more than the other group.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nIm Bereich der Investmentfonds lassen sich starke Mittelzufl\u00a8\nusse bei denjenigen Fonds\nfeststellen, die in der Vergangenheit \u00a8\nuberdurchschnittlich abgeschnitten haben. Dieses\nVerhalten, bei dem sich Investoren an vergangener Performance eines Fonds orientieren,\nwird in der Literatur als \"Performance Chasing\" bezeichnet. \u00a8\nUberraschend ist hierbei,\ndass es zu Performance Chasing kommt, obwohl gute Performance von Investmentfonds\nmeistens nicht lange anh\u00a8\nalt. Im Gegensatz dazu kann man beobachten, dass Investoren\nnicht ihr Geld von schlechten Fonds abzuziehen. Diese Verhaltensweise von Investoren\nwird oft als irrational bezeichnet.\nBerk und Green (2004) zeigen jedoch, dass es auch eine rationale Erkl\u00a8\narung f\u00a8\nur Per-\nformance Chasing geben kann. Im Modellrahmen von Berk und Green verfolgen In-\nvestoren eine Performance-Chasing-Strategie, um f\u00a8\nahige Fondsmanager, d.h. Manager\ndie eine \u00a8\nUberrendite generieren, zu finden. Mit wachsender Gr\u00a8\no\u00dfe des Fonds, d.h. bei\nstarken Fondszufl\u00a8\nussen, nimmt allerdings die F\u00a8\nahigkeit des Fondsmanagers den Markt\nzu schlagen ab. Starke Mittelzufl\u00a8\nusse reduzieren die \u00a8\nUberrendite eines Fonds solange,\nbis der Fonds nicht mehr den Markt schl\u00a8\nagt. Dies erkl\u00a8\nart, warum Performance Chas-\ning rational sein kann, auch wenn kein Fonds langfristig eine \u00a8\nUberrendite erzielen kann.\nDie Tatsache, dass es nur wenig Abfl\u00a8\nusse aus schlechten Fonds gibt, erkl\u00a8\nart das Berk-\nGreen-Modell durch sogenannte \"benachteiligte Investoren\", die entweder nicht ratio-\nnal sind, oder durch \u00a8\nau\u00dfere Gegebenheiten oder Regulierungen gehindert werden ihre\nMittel abzuziehen. Dieser Aufsatz untersucht, ob solche benachteilige Investorengruppen\nin Fonds existieren. Die Depotstatistik der Deutschen Bundesbank erlaubt hierbei nicht\nnur eine Unterscheidung zwischen privaten und institutionellen Investoren, sondern auch\nzwischen verschiedenen Typen innerhalb der institutionellen Investoren (beispielsweise\nFinanzinstitute sowie Versicherungen und Pensionskassen). F\u00a8\nur diese Investorengruppen\nist jeweils ein unterschiedliches Verhalten in Bezug auf die Kauf- und Verkaufsentschei-\ndung von Fonds zu erwarten.\nDie Ergebnisse lassen sich folgenderma\u00dfen zusammenfassen: Erstens, Finanzinstitute\nbetreiben eine klare Performance-Chasing-Strategie. Zweitens kann festgestellt werden,\ndass auch Versicherungen und Pensionskassen eine Performance-Chasing-Strategie verfol-\ngen, diese aber weniger ausgepr\u00a8\nagt ist als bei Finanzinstituten. Des Weiteren investieren\nVersicherungen und Pensionskassen nicht in alle Investmentfonds. Sie bevorzugen gr\u00a8\no\u00dfere\nund \u00a8\naltere Fonds, sowie Fonds mit geringerer Volatilit\u00a8\nat. Dies f\u00a8\nuhrt dazu, dass Ver-\nsicherungen und Pensionskassen nur einen geringen Anteil an den besten Fonds halten.\nDie Unterschiede zwischen diesen beiden institutionellen Anlegergruppen k\u00a8\nonnen durch\ndie zus\u00a8\natzliche Regulierung von Versicherung und Pensionskassen erkl\u00a8\nart werden, die\nals \"institutionelle Benachteiligung\" bezeichnet werden kann. Die Ergebnisse bez\u00a8\nuglich\nprivater Haushalte sind uneinheitlich. Auch in dieser Investorengruppe kann Performance\nChasing festgestellt werden, allerdings in einem wesentlich geringeren Umfang als bei\ninstitutionellen Investoren. Au\u00dferdem kann eine betr\u00a8\nachtliche Autokorrelation in den\nFondsfl\u00a8\nussen der Haushalte beobachtet werden, was bei institutionellen Investoren nicht\nder Fall ist. Autokorrelation in Fondsfl\u00a8\nussen kann auf Werbung der Fonds, bestehende\nSparpl\u00a8\nane oder Status-Quo-Bias der Investoren zur\u00a8\nuckgef\u00a8\nuhrt werden. Fondsfl\u00a8\nusse auf-\ngrund von Werbung und Status-Quo-Bias werden eher irrationalen Investoren bzw. benach-\nteiligten Investoren zugerechnet.\nDiese Ergebnisse sind konsistent mit dem Berk-Green-Modell. Hervorzuheben ist das\nErgebnis, dass institutionelle Investoren Performance Chasing betreiben. Dieses Verhalten\nist bislang in der Literatur eher unerfahrenen bzw. irrationalen Investoren zugeschrieben\nworden. In diesem Artikel wird zudem untersucht, ob sich die Investorengruppen in\nihrem Verhalten, schlechte Performance durch Abfl\u00a8\nusse zu sanktionieren, unterscheiden.\nEin signifikanter Unterschied zwischen den Investorengruppen kann hier jedoch nicht fest-\ngestellt werden.\nContents\n2 Related Literature and Hypotheses 4\n3.1 Mutual Fund Data and Depositor Structure . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\n3.2 Fund Flows . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n3.3 Performance Measures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10\n4 Flow-Performance Relationship 11\n4.1 Flow-Performance Relationship of Different Investor Groups . . . . . . . . 11\n4.2 The Investment Decisions of Insurance Companies and Pension Funds . . . 14\n5 Mutual Fund Investor Composition 17\n5.1 Investor Composition by Quintile . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\n5.2 Investor Composition: Robustness Checks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\n1 Introduction\nMutual fund investors chase past performance, even though performance is not persistent\nover time. On the other hand, investors are reluctant to withdraw their money from the\nworst performing funds (see e.g. Sirri & Tufano 1998, Carhart 1997). This behavior has\noften been attributed to the irrationality of mutual fund investors.\nIn contrast to behavioral explanations, Gruber (1996) and Berk & Green (2004) de-\nvelop a model in which investors rationally chase past performance. They assume that\nfund managers possess different levels of investment ability. Mutual funds' future perfor-\nmance is thus partly predictable from past performance. Sophisticated investors realize\nthis and therefore rationally chase past performance. Since managerial ability is assumed\nto have decreasing returns to scale, a well performing manager will attract inflows until\nhe or she is no longer able to outperform the market. By the same mechanism investors\nleave poorly performing funds up to the point where the funds cease to underperform.\nThus, performance of mutual funds is not persistent, precisely because investors chase\npast performance.\nThe worst performing mutual funds, however, keep performing poorly (see Carhart\ntence of the worst performing funds is caused by the fact that some investors are unwilling\nor hindered from withdrawing their money (see Berk & Tonks 2007). This cannot be cor-\nrected by other investors, since they cannot short-sell mutual fund shares. The persistence\nof the worst performing funds is therefore attributed to unsophisticated or disadvantaged\ninvestor clienteles that do not withdraw their money from poorly performing funds. So\nare there disadvantaged clienteles in mutual funds, and if so, who are they?\nUsing a unique data set, that allows the identification of different investor groups in\nmutual funds, this paper tries to address this question. The data set comes from the\nSecurities Deposits Statistics of the Deutsche Bundesbank, which record the depositors\nof securities held in Germany. Through this information I am able to obtain the investor\nstructure of mutual funds. In particular, the data enables me to differentiate not only be-\ntween retail and institutional investors, but also between different institutional investors\nsuch as financial corporations and insurance companies and pension funds. These in-\nvestor groups are likely to differ in their behavior. Financial corporations are arguably\nthe most sophisticated investors and should invest according to performance. The group of\nprivate investors can include both sophisticated investors and unsophisticated investors.\nInsurance companies and pension funds are financially sophisticated, but can be insti-\ntutionally disadvantaged because of regulatory restrictions. By identifying these three\ninvestor groups and analyzing their behavior within the same mutual fund I am able to\ndirectly test hypotheses deduced from the Gruber (1996) and Berk & Green (2004) model.\nThe main findings of this paper are as follows: First, financial corporations show a\nstrong tendency to chase past performance, which is statistically and economically signif-\nicant. The best performing funds experience inflows of up to 31 percentage points higher\nthan the average fund. Consequently, the percentage of mutual fund shares held by fi-\nnancial corporations is higher for the best performing funds than for the average fund.\nWhile financial corporations hold an average of 13 percent in mutual funds, they hold\nabout 18-19 percent in the best performing funds. The fact that financial corporations\nchase past performance is telling, because financial corporations are probably the most\nsophisticated investors and chasing past returns of mutual funds has often been attributed\nto unsophisticated investors. Thus, the finding that sophisticated investors chase perfor-\nmance provides strong support for the theory proposed by Gruber (1996) and Berk &\nSecond, there is some evidence that insurance corporations and pension funds are chas-\ning performance, although not as strongly as financial corporations. Moreover, insurance\ncompanies and pension funds do not invest in all mutual funds in the sample. Insurance\ncompanies and pension funds tend to invest in larger and older funds, funds with high\nfees and less volatility, which results in the fact that insurance companies and pension\nfunds only hold around 10-12 percent of shares in the top performing funds, while the\naverage share of this investor group is around 16 percent.\nThird, evidence for retail investors is mixed. Households chase past winners to some\nextent, but compared to financial corporations the inflows to top performing funds are\nconsiderably smaller in size. Top mutual funds only experience around 3 percentage\npoint higher inflows than the average fund. Furthermore, retail flows show a significant\nfirst-order autocorrelation, while both institutional investors - financial corporations, and\ninsurance companies and pension funds - do not. This result is robust for all specifications\nand economically meaningful. All other things being equal, a fund that experienced an\nincrease in retail flows of 10 percentage points in the previous quarter grows in the current\nquarter by an additional 2.6 percentage points. This autocorrelation pattern in retail\nflows can either be caused by unobserved fund characteristics, such as advertising and\ndistribution channels, savings plans or by status quo bias. Both flows due to advertising\nand status quo bias are associated with unsophisticated investors.\nFinally, the paper investigates whether investor groups differ in their behavior of pun-\nishing mutual fund managers by withdrawing their money from poorly performing funds.\nThere is some evidence that financial corporations punish the worst performing funds\nby withdrawing their money. However, when looking at the percentage shares held by\nthe investor groups, the investor composition of the worst performing funds does not\nsystematically differ from the investor composition of the average fund.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the related\nliterature and develops the testable hypotheses. Section 3 describes the data set that is\nused. Section 4 investigates the differences in the flow-performance relationship of the var-\nious investor groups. Section 5 analyzes the investor composition subject to performance.\nSection 6 concludes.\n2 Related Literature and Hypotheses\nA wealth of literature investigates the flows of mutual fund investors as a response to past\nperformance. This flow-performance relationship of investors in mutual funds has been\nmutual funds with high performance receive overproportional inflows, while funds with\nlow performance experience only mild outflows. Ber, Kempf & Ruenzi (2007) and Jank &\nWedow (2010) confirm this convex flow-performance relationship for the German mutual\nfund market.\nThere are several studies that investigate the flow-performance relationship of mu-\ntual funds in connection with investor heterogeneity. Christoffersen & Musto (2002) find\nheterogeneity among money market fund investors. On the one hand there is a group\nof investors that is responsive to performance; on the other there are investors that do\nnot respond to bad performance by withdrawing their money. Investor heterogeneity can\ntherefore explain the cross-sectional fee dispersion among money market funds.\nThere is also evidence for investor heterogeneity in equity funds. Del Guercio & Tkac\n(2002) find different flow-performance relationships among mutual and pension funds.\nJames & Karceski (2006) observe differences between investors in institutional and retail\nfunds and Chen, Yao & Yu (2007) find differences between the clientele of funds issued\nby insurance and non-insurance companies. This paper contributes to the literature of\ninvestor heterogeneity in mutual funds by directly analyzing the flow-performance rela-\ntionship of various investor groups within the same fund.\nThe main focus of this paper thus lies in testing a theory put forth by Gruber (1996)\nand Berk & Green (2004). In their model they assume that mutual fund managers possess\ndifferent investment abilities. Since mutual funds sell at net asset value, managerial ability\nis not priced. A mutual fund with high management ability is therefore underpriced.\nSophisticated investors will realize this fact and buy (underpriced) well performing funds\nand leave underperforming funds, while disadvantaged or unsophisticated investors stay\nbehind. In the Berk & Green (2004) model managerial ability is subject to decreasing\neconomies of scale (see Chen et al. 2004). Thus, inflows of sophisticated investors into top\nperforming funds continue until the size of the fund has increased up to the point where\nthe mutual fund manager is not expected to outperform the market. The first testable\nhypothesis, as formulated by Gruber, is therefore:\nHypothesis 1: Sophisticated investors constitute a larger percentage of cash\nflows into and out of mutual funds than disadvantaged in-\nvestors.\nIf sophisticated investors identify skilled fund managers faster than unsophisticated\ninvestors and also leave poorly performing funds faster, this should also affect the stock\nof funds held by the investor groups. The second testable hypothesis is therefore about\nthe percentage shares held by the different investor groups. If sophisticated investors exit\npoorly performing funds first, it will mostly be disadvantaged investors who stay behind.\nThis is what Berk & Tonks (2007) call a \"burnout\" in analogy to the mortgage backed\nsecurities market. By the same argument the share of sophisticated investors will increase\nin the funds that overperform. Thus, the second testable hypothesis is twofold (Gruber\nHypothesis 2a: Mutual funds that overperform contain a larger proportion of\nsophisticated clientele than a fund with average performance.\nHypothesis 2b: Mutual funds that underperform contain a larger proportion of\ndisadvantaged clientele than a fund with average performance.\nThis gives rise to the following question: Which groups in a mutual fund are so-\nphisticated, unsophisticated or disadvantaged? Gruber (1996) proposes the following\ncategorization, where mutual fund investors are divided into sophisticated and disadvan-\ntaged investors. Sophisticated investors are defined as investors who invest according to\nperformance. The group of disadvantaged investors consists of the following sub-groups:\nFirst, there are unsophisticated investors, who are influenced by other factors besides\nperformance, such as advertising or brokerage advice. Second, there are institutionally\ndisadvantaged investors, who are restricted in their investment decisions by regulations.1\nThis study will test these key hypotheses by investigating the flow-performance rela-\ntionship and percentage holdings of three different investor groups: Households, financial\ncorporations, and insurance companies and pension funds. If the theory by Gruber (1996)\nand Berk & Green (2004) is correct, we should expect differences in the investor groups'\nflow-performance sensitivities. Financial corporations are arguably the most sophisti-\ncated investors and should therefore have a strong flow-performance sensitivity, i.e. they\nshould strongly chase performance and also heavily punish the worst performing funds\nby withdrawing money. The degree of financial sophistication for households is unclear a\npriori. Insurance companies and pension funds are financially sophisticated but compared\nto other institutional investors they are disadvantaged, because regulations restrict what\nthey are able to invest in. In Germany insurance companies and pension funds are both\nregulated by the same law, the Insurance Supervision Act (Versicherungsaufsichtsgesetz,\nVAG), and are supervised by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt\nf\u00a8\nur Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin). This regulation requires insurance companies\nand pension funds to verify that their investments in mutual funds comply with prudent-\nman principles. The three investor groups consequently differ in their decisions whether\nto buy and sell mutual fund shares. The following section will describe the data set used\nin this study.\n1Furthermore, Gruber names tax disadvantaged investors, for whom the tax considerations make it\ninefficient to redeem their shares from a fund. The complication of the tax overhang caused by capital\ngains tax (see e.g. Barclay et al. 1998) does not apply for Germany.\n3.1 Mutual Fund Data and Depositor Structure\nThe sample consists of mutual funds that are registered in Germany and are thus required\nto report to the central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank.2 The reporting data is the\nmain data set and contains, among other things information about the numbers of shares\noutstanding, total net assets, buy and sell prices and dividends payed. The data set also\nincludes funds that have either ceased to exist or have merged with other funds and is\ntherefore survivorship-bias free. I only consider actively managed mutual funds that are\nprimarily offered to individuals, i.e. I omit index funds and funds that are exclusively for\ninstitutional investors. To make funds comparable I only consider funds with a sufficient\nnumber of funds in their peer group:3 funds that invest in Germany, Europe and funds\nwith a global investment objective. The information about the investment objective as\nwell as the total expense ratio was obtained from the German Federal Association of\nInvestment Companies (Bundesverband Deutscher Investmentgesellschaften, BVI).\nThe mutual fund data is matched with data from the Securities Deposits Statistics of\nthe Deutsche Bundesbank. Starting with the last quarter of 2005 the Securities Deposits\nStatistics record data on the depositor structure of financial securities held in Germany.\nThe statistics give the amount of shares held by a certain depositor group in a financial\nsecurity or, in this case, in a mutual fund. I investigate three major investor groups:\nHouseholds, financial corporations, and insurance corporations and pension funds. Fi-\nnancial corporations include credit institutions, other financial intermediaries such as\ninvestment funds and financial auxiliaries and exclude insurance corporations and pen-\n2There are a number of funds that are registered in Luxembourg and marketed in Germany. These\nfunds do not report to the Deutsche Bundesbank and are therefore not contained in the sample.\n3I omit index funds, sector funds and foreign single-country funds.\nsion funds.4 For simplicity, the term financial corporations will always exclude insurance\ncompanies and pension funds in the following analysis.\nThe Securities Deposits Statistics collect data from financial institutions in Germany\non the basis of a security-by-security reporting system. Financial institutions report the\nnumber of shares of their customers or their own holdings in a mutual fund. These shares\nare categorized into depositor groups by the financial institutions and then reported to\nthe Deutsche Bundesbank, which aggregates the data for each fund. Deviations between\nthe actual number of shares outstanding and the number of shares reported can either\nbe caused by shares that are held by depositors which are not reported (e.g. foreign\nshareholders) or by double counting. For this reason I cross-check the aggregate number\nof shares from the deposits statistics with the number of shares outstanding. Descriptive\nstatistics for the sample can be found in Table 1.\nThe table provides the number of funds in the sample and their investment objective\n(Germany, Europe or Global). In addition it displays statistics of common mutual fund\ncharacteristics. Finally, the table shows the number of funds for which information on\nthe investor structure is available. Coverage of the investor structure is around 60 to\nand 2008. Households hold the majority of assets, but their share decreased from 71\ninstitutional investors in mutual funds. Especially the group of insurance companies and\nincrease might reflect the fact that since the reform of the statutory pension insurance\nscheme in Germany in-company and private pension schemes are becoming more and\nmore important.\n4Categorization according to the European System of Accounts (ESA 95): Households (ESA 95 code:\nS.14), insurance corporations and pension funds (ESA 95 code: S.125), financial corporations include\ncredit institutions, other financial intermediaries and financial auxiliaries (ESA 95 code: S.122, S.123 and\nS.124). The remaining group includes non-financial corporations, central banks, general government, and\nSince the data provides the number of shares being held by every investor group in each\nquarter, the calculation of investor flows is straightforward. The net flow of depositor\ngroup j in fund i in period t is calculated as follows:\nFlowi,j,t\n=\nSharesi,j,t\n- Sharesi,j,t-1\nSharesi,j,t-1\nwhere Sharesi,j,t\nis the amount of shares of fund i held by depositor group j in quarter\nt. The total net flow is simply calculated as the relative change in all outstanding shares.\nThrough this procedure I obtain total net flows and flows for each of the three investor\ngroups: Households, financial corporations, and insurance companies and pension funds.\nUnusual flows can occur for very new funds, when mergers take place or when a fund\ncloses down. To avoid these outliers I omit observations with a growth rate below and\nabove the 1st and the 99th percentile.\nFollowing Keswani & Stolin (2008) I calculate time series averages of mean, standard\ndeviation and percentiles of all investor group flows, which can be found in Table 2. Over-\nall, there are weak outflows from mutual funds in the sample period. While households\nseem to withdraw money from mutual funds in the sample period, financial corporations,\nand insurance companies and pension funds bought mutual fund shares. Furthermore, the\ncross-sectional variance of institutional flows is much larger than the variance of private\ninvestors. In particular, financial corporations show the highest variation. This high vari-\nation of institutional flows suggests that institutional investors move their money more\nquickly into and out of mutual funds than retail investors do.\nTable 3 shows time series averages of pairwise correlations of investor group flows.\nThe average correlation between the flows of the different groups is surprisingly small.\nKeswani & Stolin (2008) find a similarly low correlation between retail and institutional\ninvestors. This low correlation points to the fact that different investor groups behave\nvery differently when deciding whether to buy and sell funds.\n3.3 Performance Measures\nPerformance is estimated using three measures, which are commonly reported for mutual\nfunds: Raw Return, Sharpe Ratio and Jensen's Alpha. Raw Returns are calculated\nassuming that gross dividends are reinvested immediately. I calculate the Sharpe Ratio\nas the average excess return in the evaluation period divided by the variance of returns\nSharpe Ratioi\n=\nRi\n- Rf\nV ar(Ri\n)\nwhere Ri\nis the monthly return of fund i and Rf the risk free rate measured by the\n1-month EURIBOR. Last, I use the performance measure proposed by Jensen (1968).\nJensen's Alpha is estimated as follows:\nRi\n- Rf = i\n+ i\n(Rm - Rf ), (3)\nwhere Ri\nis again the return of fund i and Rf the risk free rate, again measured by\nthe 1-month EURIBOR, and Rm is the return of the market portfolio. The market\nportfolio return is measured by the benchmark index for each investment objective. I use\nthe following three benchmark indices, which are generally used to evaluate these mutual\nfunds in their respective peer group: the MSCI Germany, MSCI Europe and MSCI Global\nIndex. The evaluation period for the performance measures is 24 months. Using shorter\nor longer evaluation periods, such as 12 and 36 months, leads to similar results.\nThis study focuses on these performance measures, because they are easily available\nfor all investors. Information services such as Morningstar and others provide these on\na regular basis. The performance measures provided can therefore be seen as a signal\nof managerial ability, which is available to all investors, institutional and private, at no\nor only negligible costs. Thus, the focus of this paper is to answer the question of how\ninvestors react to these observed performance measures by adjusting their flows.\n4 Flow-Performance Relationship\n4.1 Flow-Performance Relationship of Different Investor Groups\nIn order to estimate the flow-performance relationship I run a piecewise-linear regression\n(see Sirri & Tufano 1998, Huang et al. 2007). For each quarter mutual funds are ranked\nwithin their investment objective according to their past performance, where performance\nis measured by Raw Return, Sharpe Ratio and Jensen's Alpha over the past 24 months.\nThis rank is then normalized so that ranks are evenly distributed between zero and one,\nwhere zero is assigned to the worst performing fund and one to the best performing fund.\nFunds are then categorized into low, medium and high performing funds: low performing\nfunds include the lowest performance quintile, medium performing funds the three middle\nperformance quintiles and the high performing funds the highest performance quintile.\nThe three variables for the regression are defined in the following way:\nLowi\n= Min(Ranki\nMidi\n= Min(Ranki\n- Lowi\nHighi\n= Ranki\n- Midi\n- Lowi\n,\nwhere Ranki\nis the percentile rank of the fund. Thus, the coefficients of Low, Mid and\nHigh represent the piecewise decomposition of the percentile rank and can be interpreted\nas the slope of the flow-performance relationship within the performance range. The\nregression model is specified as follows:\nFlowi,j,t\nControlsi,t-1\n+ i,j,t\n,\nwhere Flowi,j,t\nis the flow of each investor group j in fund i at quarter t. Control\nvariables include volatility measured by the 24-month standard deviation of monthly\nreturns, total expenses, fund size measured by the natural logarithm of total net assets,\nand fund age measured by the natural logarithm of one plus age in years.5 For each\ninvestor group I also include the flow lagged by one quarter into the regression, since\nmutual fund flows show a pattern of autocorrelation. In addition, the regression includes\ntime dummies and dummies for the investment objectives, which are not reported.\nThe quarterly regression model is estimated using pooled OLS, since the sample's\ntime dimension is quite short and the Fama & MacBeth (1973) regression lacks sufficient\nstatistical power in such a setting. Standard errors are clustered at the fund level.\nTable 4 shows the result of this regression for Raw Return, Sharpe Ratio and Jensen's\nAlpha. For all performance measures I find a convex flow-performance relationship in total\nnet flows as can be seen in the first column of Panel A, B and C. Furthermore, the results\nshow significant first-order autocorrelation in mutual fund flows. The remaining control\nvariables show the expected signs. Volatility in returns is negatively related to fund flows,\neven though only significant in one specification and total fees are also negatively related\nto flows. Size and age have no significant influence on flows at the aggregate level. These\nfindings are comparable to those for the US market (see e.g. Sirri & Tufano 1998, Chen\nLooking at the disaggregate flows, however, the three investor groups show pronounced\ndifferences in their flow-performance relationship in the high segment. Financial corpora-\ntions have the highest flow-performance sensitivity in this segment. The top performing\nfunds experience a 31 percentage point higher growth rate than funds in the middle section\n(See Panel B). There is some evidence that the group of insurance companies and pension\nfunds chases past performance, but the coefficient of the high segment is not statistically\nsignificant for all performance measures. Moreover, households chase past performance,\nalthough, the coefficient is much smaller in size.\n5Total expenses are measured by expense ratio + 1/3 total load. Since the average holding period\nwas 2 - 3 years in the sample I adjust the calculation of total fees as proposed by Sirri & Tufano (1998).\nNote that Barber et al. (2005) find similar results for US mutual funds with an average holding period\nThe first-order autocorrelation of investor flows is also of interest. The positive au-\ntocorrelation found in the aggregate net flows of mutual funds can solely be attributed\nto the group of households. Insurance companies and pension funds show no significant\nautocorrelation and financial corporations show a slightly negative coefficient of lagged\nflows, which, however, is only significantly different from zero at a ten percent level. This\nresult is robust for all specifications and economically meaningful. All other things being\nequal, a fund that experienced an increase in retail flows of 10 percentage points in the\nprevious quarter grows in the current quarter by an additional 2.6 percentage points. The\nautocorrelation in retail flows can be explained by unobserved factors such as distribution\nchannels of the fund family, advertising or simply status quo bias (see e.g. Patel et al.\nretail flows is a sign for unsophisticated investors among the group of retail investors. An\nalternative explanation is that retail investors are disadvantaged through high transaction\ncosts, and thus choose to invest continuously in the same fund (e.g. through a savings\nplan).\nThe convex flow-performance relationship in total flows can be seen by the fact that\nwithdrawals in the low performance segment are not as strong as performance chasing in\nthe high performance segment. In addition, when comparing the three investor groups,\ndifferences in flow-performance sensitivity in the low performance segment are not as\npronounced as for the high performance segment. Only financial corporations show sig-\nnificant outflows from the worst performing funds, when using risk adjusted performance\nmeasures. These findings have to be interpreted with caution since the flows of institu-\ntional investors show a high variation and these results might be driven by rather extreme\nflows.\nIn summary, the results mainly support the first hypothesis. Sophisticated investors\naccount for a larger percentage of cash flows into well performing funds than disadvantaged\ninvestors do. Financial corporations, arguably the most sophisticated investors, chase past\nperformance to the greatest extent. Insurance companies and pension funds, a group of\ninvestors that might be institutionally disadvantaged, show a lower tendency to chase\npast performance. The results of households as a group are mixed. On the one hand they\nseem to be sophisticated, on the other hand some flows seem to be driven by advertising\nor status quo bias. This result is in line with Malloy & Zhu (2004), who find clientele\ndifferences among retail investors. There is some evidence that financial corporations\npunish poor performance by withdrawing their money from low performing funds.\nAs we see in Table 4, insurance companies and pension funds do not invest in all\npercent of the sample. Omitting this fact might bias the results of the flow-performance\nrelationship. To address this potential selection bias I will model both the decision to\ninvest in a fund or not and the decision regarding how much to invest in the fund (flow\nregression) simultaneously in the next section using a Heckman selection model.6\n4.2 The Investment Decisions of Insurance Companies and Pen-\nsion Funds\nThe investment decisions of insurance companies and pension funds are different to those\nof households and financial corporations. While financial corporations and households can\ndecide on their own, insurance companies and pension funds are regulated by the Federal\nFinancial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and have to prove that their investments in mu-\ntual funds comply with prudent-man principles. If these principles are violated, insurance\ncompanies and pension funds are not allowed to invest in the fund. This regulation might\nbe the reason why there are no insurances and pension funds in one third of the funds\nin the sample. Thus, the decision of insurance companies and pension funds is twofold:\nfirst, whether they can invest in the fund or not; and second, how much they invest in\nthe funds they are allowed to invest in.\n6I also run a Heckman selection model for the group of financial corporations as a robustness check.\nThe results of the Heckman model are very similar to the pooled OLS approach. The Heckman selection\nmodel is not feasible for households, since the number of funds that lack private investors is not sufficient.\nTo capture this two-part decision process I run a Heckman (1979) selection model.\nThe flow-performance regression for insurance companies and pension funds is specified\nas before:\nFlowi,j,t\nControlsi,t-1\n,\nhowever, flows are only observed if insurance companies and pension funds decided to\ninvest in the mutual fund or are not restricted from investing in this fund. This is the\ncase if the following condition is fulfilled:\nPerformance Ranki,t-1\nControlsi,t-1\nwhere\n) = .\nThe explanatory variables of the selection equation are past performance, measured by\nthe performance ranking over an evaluation period of 24 months, volatility also measured\nover the past 24 months, and the age and size of the fund. Furthermore, dummy variables\nindicating the investment objective and time dummies are included, but not reported. I\nestimate the Heckman two equation model using maximum likelihood. Results for the\nthree different performance measures are displayed in Table 5.\nThe first column of each specification (FLOW) shows the flow-performance relation-\nship already estimated (Eq. 6). The second column of each specification (SELECT)\ndisplays the results of the selection equation, the decision of the insurance companies\nand pension funds on whether to invest in the fund (Eq. 7). The estimation results are\nvirtually the same as before. Insurance companies and pension funds show a tendency to\nchase past performance, although not for all performance measures.\nIn the Heckman selection model a self-selection bias arises only if the correlation \nbetween the residuals of equation (6) and (7) is not equal to zero. As can be seen from\nTable 5, the null hypothesis that  is equal to zero cannot be rejected on all conventional\nsignificance levels. Thus, a separate estimation, as carried out before, delivers already\nunbiased estimates.\nNevertheless, the selection equation provides some interesting insights. The probabil-\nity of insurance companies and pension funds investing in a mutual fund decreases if the\nfund is a high performer. This result is in line with the avoidance of risk required by\nthe prudent-man principles. High volatility, on the other hand, has no significant effect\non the probability of insurance companies and pension funds investing in mutual funds.\nMoreover, insurance companies and pension funds tend to invest in older and larger funds,\nwhich can be interpreted as the fund having a long and good reputation, but it should\nalso be borne in mind that only a long record makes it possible for insurance companies\nand pension funds to provide evidence of the security of the mutual fund to the regulator.\nThe positive coefficient for fund fees might also indicate that insurance companies and\npension funds see these funds as high quality funds. Or to put it differently: a high quality\nfund, which has maybe even received a quality rating, is simply able to charge a higher\nfee.\nTo quantify the effect of the explanatory variables on the probability of insurance\ncompanies and pension funds investing in a mutual fund I provide marginal effects of a\nProbit model. Since the residuals of the flow regression are uncorrelated with the residuals\nof the selection regression, a two-part model, i.e. separately running a Probit model and\nOLS regression, also yields unbiased results. Table 6 reports the marginal effects of the\nProbit model evaluated at the mean of the explanatory variables.\nIn summary, insurance companies show signs of performance chasing, although regula-\ntions seem to hinder them from investing in all mutual funds. Overall, the disaggregation\nof the flow-performance relationship in their investor types supports the theory of Gruber\n(1996) and Berk & Green (2004); however, the results provide no clear-cut evidence of\nwhether one group is punishing bad performance more severely. Only in some specifi-\ncations do financial corporations show a significant flow-performance relationship in the\nlower segment. These results should be interpreted with caution since the fund flows,\nespecially institutional flows, show very extreme values (see Table 2). The results of the\nflow-performance regression could accordingly be driven by a few extreme flows. There-\nfore, in the next section I will analyze the percentage holdings of investors. A difference\nin the flow-performance relationship should also become apparent in the stock of shares\nheld by the different investor groups.\n5 Mutual Fund Investor Composition\n5.1 Investor Composition by Quintile\nIf all investors react in the same way to performance there should be no systematic dif-\nference in the percentage of shares held by investor groups in well or poorly performing\nfunds. In contrast, if there are sophisticated investors and disadvantaged investors, the\ninvestor compositions for well and poorly performing funds should be different. Sophis-\nticated investors learn about managerial ability and will increase their flows into high\nperforming funds, which should consequently increase the percentage of shares held by\nsophisticated investors in top performing funds. By the same token there should be an\nincreased percentage of disadvantaged investors in the worst performing funds.\nIn order to test this hypothesis I rank mutual funds according to their past performance\nwithin their investment objective and form five quintiles. In each quintile I determine the\naverage size measured by the total net assets (TNA) of the fund and the average share\nof each investor group. The results can be found in Table 7. The difference in means\nbetween the groups is tested using a t-test. I test the differences between the top and\nThe worst performing funds (bottom quintile) are much smaller on average than the\nbetter performing funds. Fund size increases with performance, but the top performing\nfunds are slightly smaller on average than the fourth quintile in two out of three cases.\nThis result is in line with the theoretical model by Berk & Green (2004), who argue that\nthere are economies of scale in managerial ability.\nThe percentage share held by households is slightly higher for the worst performing\nfunds than the top performing funds. This finding is in line with the previous results.\nHouseholds do chase returns to some extent, but, in addition, other factors such as ad-\nvertising might play an important role in the fund selection process.\nThe previous finding for financial corporations can also be confirmed. Financial cor-\nporations show the strongest tendency to chase past performance. The share of financial\ncorporations in the top performing funds is therefore 19 while the worst performing funds\nonly contain 13 percent on average (Panel A). Moreover, the difference between the top\nquintile and the second best quintile is distinct. The share of financial corporations in-\ncreases by 6 percentage points from the 4th to the 5th quintile.\nThe group of insurance corporations and pension funds is clearly underrepresented\nin the top performing funds, even though there is some evidence of performance chasing\nfor this investor group. Insurance companies and pension funds do not hold any shares\nin many of the better performing funds, which results in the large difference in means\nbetween the top two and the bottom three quintiles.\nWhile this test shows distinct differences in investor composition between top perform-\ning funds and average funds, there is no clear difference between the worst performing\nfunds and average funds. Even though the average size of mutual funds decreases from\n260 million to 182 million Euro from the second to the first quintile (Panel A), the investor\ncomposition between the second and first quintile does not change considerably. Only the\ndifference in mean shares for households is statistically significant, when comparing the\nsecond versus the first quintile. However, when testing against the 3rd or 4th quintile this\ndifference becomes insignificant (not reported). This result implies that the speed with\nwhich households, financial corporations, and insurance companies and pension funds\nleave the worst performing funds does not differ significantly.\n5.2 Investor Composition: Robustness Checks\nSince other factors might influence the percentage share held by one investor group I run\na multivariate regression as a robustness check. I construct a dummy variable Quintile 1\nthat is one if the fund's performance is in the first quintile and zero otherwise. Dummies\nfor the other quintiles are constructed in the same way.\nTable 1 shows that the holding structure of mutual fund investors changed over time.\nTo account for the changing investor composition over time, I include time dummies as\na control in the regression. Furthermore, different investor groups might have different\npreferences regarding the investment objective of the fund. This is controlled for by also\nincluding dummies for the fund investment objective. Additional controls are the funds'\nvolatility, fees, size and age.\nI run a regression of percentage shares of investor groups on the quintile dummies and\nthe mentioned controls. The omitted category is the 3rd quintile. Thus, the coefficients of\nthe dummy variables measure the difference relative to a fund with average performance.\nThe results are essentially the same as for the univariate test. Most importantly, financial\ncorporations hold a significantly higher share in the top performing funds than a fund with\naverage performance. The composition of the worst performing funds, in contrast, does\nnot systematically differ from the investor composition of the average fund. The finding\nof the flow-performance regression that financial corporations punish poorly performing\nfunds more quickly is not confirmed when looking at the investor compositions. The\nsignificant flow-performance relationship in the low segment is thus most likely driven by\nonly a few observations.\nFurthermore, financial corporations seem to be less risk averse since their share is\ngreater in funds with higher volatility. In addition, younger funds have an increased share\nof financial corporations as investors. One possible explanation is that financial corpo-\nrations have better inside knowledge about the fund manager's ability and are therefore\nwilling to buy younger funds.\nLooking at the investor composition of mutual funds provides an additional test for\nthe theory of Gruber (1996) and Berk & Green (2004). While this test provides evidence\nthat sophisticated investors hold higher percentage shares in the best performing funds,\nthe test cannot detect any systematic difference in investor composition between the\nworst performing funds and those with average performance. Thus, we do not observe\na \"burnout\", where sophisticated investors exit poorly performing funds first and only\ndisadvantaged and unsophisticated investors stay behind. The results are more in line\nwith Lynch & Musto (2003), who argue that investors do not respond to poor performance,\nbecause they expect the management strategy or the management team to change.\n6 Conclusion\nChasing past performance of mutual funds is often explained by asymmetric information\nor behavioral arguments. Gruber (1996) and Berk & Green (2004) provide an alternative\nexplanation for this phenomenon. Sophisticated investors rationally chase past perfor-\nmance, because high past performance is a signal for managerial ability.\nThis paper provides a direct test of this theory by examining the flow-performance\nrelationship of different investor groups in German mutual funds. The findings overall\nsupport the theory of Gruber (1996) and Berk & Green (2004). Financial corporations,\narguably the most sophisticated investor group, have a strong tendency to chase past\nperformance. The group of households comprises both sophisticated investors, who chase\npast performance, and unsophisticated investors, whose investment decision is driven by\nadvertising or status quo bias. Insurance companies and pension funds show signs of being\ninstitutionally disadvantaged. There is some evidence that this investor group chases\npast performance, but they are underrepresented in the best performing funds, probably\ndue to investment restrictions. Surprisingly, I find no significant difference between the\ninvestor composition of the worst performing funds and those with average performance.\nThese results provide new insights into the investment decisions of different mutual fund\ninvestors and the different flow-performance relationships of investor groups.\nReferences\nBarber, B.
