While LH is known to have moderate to\nhigh population-level heritability in humans, both at the level of the high-order factor\n(Super-K) and the lower-order factors (K, Covitality, and the General Factor of Personality),\nseveral important questions remain unexplored. Here, we apply the Continuous\nParameter Estimation Model to measure individual genomic-level heritabilities (termed\ntransmissibilities). These transmissibility values were computed for the latent hierarchical\nstructure and developmental dynamics of LH strategy, and demonstrate; (1) moderate\nto high heritability of factor loadings of Super-K on its lower-order factors, evidencing\nbiological preparedness, genetic accommodation, and the gene-culture coevolution\nof biased epigenetic rules of development; (2) moderate to high heritability of the\nmagnitudes of the effect of the higher-order factors upon their loadings on their\nconstituent factors, evidencing genetic constraints upon phenotypic plasticity; and (3)\nthat heritability of the LH factors, their factor loadings, and the magnitudes of the\ncorrelations among factors, are weaker among individuals with slower LH speeds.

The genomic-level heritability of life history\nIntroduction\nThe purpose of this paper is threefold: (1) to introduce the\nuse of the Continuous Parameter Estimation Method (CPEM)\nto enable the estimation of genomic-level heritabilities, which\nwe call individual transmissibilities, in population-representative\nsamples from Sweden and the USA; (2) to apply this method\nto estimate the aggregate heritabilities of the upper two strata\nof the hierarchically-organized latent structure of Life History\n(LH) strategy; and (3) to extend this method further to estimate\nthe heritabilities of the dynamics of Strategic Differentiation-\nIntegration Effort (SD-IE) that have been previously documented\namong the different levels of the latent LH hierarchy (Figueredo\net al., 2013b). Although the second objective has already been\nachieved by more conventional means (see Figueredo et al., 2004;\nFigueredo and Rushton, 2009), the third objective is not attain-\nable without the novel method used to perform the first objec-\ntive. Executing the second step, however, determines whether this\nnovel method performs as expected in approximating the results\npreviously achieved by more traditional means.\nLife History Theory: An Overview\nLife history theory describes the pattern of allocations of mate-\nrial and bioenergetic resources into different domains of fitness in\nresponse to levels of environmental stability, extrinsic morbidity-\nmortality, and population density (Ellis et al., 2009). Mammalian\nlife history strategies in general, including human ones, cohere\ninto a continuum that varies from fast to slow (Promislow and\nFaster life history strategies are characterized by rapid ontoge-\nnetic development, early reproduction, high mating effort, and\nslower life history strategies are by comparison characterized by\nmore parental effort, community building, and greater longevity\nThe latent structure of life history strategy was first extended\nby Rushton (1985) to encompass additional psychosocial traits\nin human populations, including a theoretically-specified pro-\nfile of personality traits (see Figueredo et al., 2013a). This latent\nstructure was later found to be hierarchically organized, with a\nhigher-order factor, termed Super-K, at the apex of this hierar-\nBy analogy with the three stratum theory of human intelligence\nStratum II is populated by at least three lower-order factors so\nfar identified: (1) the K-Factor, which relates to various mea-\nsures of altruistic dispositions toward family of origin, long-term\npair-bonding, parental investment, nepotism toward extended\nkin, altruism toward the community, and an orientation toward\nthe Covitality Factor, which relates to manifestations of physical\nand mental health which are in turn an outcome of higher lev-\n2007); and (3) the General Factor of Personality, or GFP for short,\nunderlying the conventional personality dimensions, such as the\n\"Big Five\" personality traits, collectively forming a global mea-\nsure of prosocial orientation and social efficacy (Figueredo et al.,\nis populated by a variety of more narrowly focused psychomet-\nric scales measuring domain-specific resource allocations within\nthese broader common factors. This three-stratum hierarchy of\nlatent life history traits is depicted graphically in Figure 1.\nStrategic Differentiation-Integration Effort\nThe two fundamental requirements for a robust science of life\nhistory evolution are (i) methods of measuring heritable vari-\nation in life history traits within populations, and (ii) a theory\ndescribing how the variation in life history traits evolves (Lande,\n1982). Advances on these fronts are facilitated by better under-\nstanding of the phenotypic and genetic associations between\nlife history related sources of phenotypic variance. Consistent\nwith this, it has been demonstrated that the phenotypic corre-\nlations among life history traits are stronger among individuals\n(and groups) exhibiting faster life histories than among those\nwith slower ones. This phenomenon has been termed strategic\ndifferentiation-integration effort (SD-IE), and has been consis-\ntently demonstrated in various samples at the level of both indi-\nvidual (Figueredo et al., 2013b) and group differences (Fernandes\nlife histories appear to be more differentiated among themselves,\npossibly due to environmental predictability and heightened\nsocial competition at the carrying capacity during their evolu-\ntion, which theoretically encourages specialization into various\nstable socio ecological micro-niches through intraspecific charac-\nversely, individuals and groups exhibiting comparatively faster\nlife histories appear to be more similar among themselves, as they\nexhibit generalized tactics and need to be able to contingently\nswitch between socio ecological micro-niches that are insuffi-\nciently stable for specialization--a common feature of an evo-\nlutionary ecology where the environmental stability is expected\nthe curved, single-headed arrows going from the latent common\nfactors to the straight, single-headed arrows connecting those\nwith their manifest indicators (i.e., the factor loadings) represent\nthe moderating SD-IE effects, and have been found to be gen-\nerally negative in direction (i.e., the strength of the associations\nweaken as the level of the latent trait increases), with only a few\ntheoretically-expected exceptions.\nAlso important to SD-IE are the concepts of preparedness\nand plasticity (Figueredo et al., 2006). The former represents the\ndegree to which an organism is genetically predisposed toward\na particular developmental trajectory, whereas the latter consti-\ntutes the degree to which gene-environment interaction induced\nphenotypic changes during development may alter that prepared\ntrajectory. Both of these principles relate directly to the con-\ncepts of genetic accommodation (West-Eberhard, 2003), which\nencompasses that of genetic assimilation (Waddington, 1953). It\nhas been argued that, just as selection can favor the predispo-\nsition toward a particular developmental trajectory in ontogeny\nunder conditions where this confers increased fitness, certain\nselection regimes might instead confer fitness on the ability to\ngenerate a highly plastic but persistent phenotype, where differ-\nent phenotypes can be developed by the same genotype under\nWoodley of Menie et al. The genomic-level heritability of life history\nFIGURE 1 | The hierarchically-organized latent structure of life history traits.\ndifferent but stable ecologies. Depending on the rate of environ-\nmental variability over time, a shorter-term form of plasticity,\ncalled flexibility, describes the capacity for an organism to alter-\nnate rapidly between different micro-niches, rather than special-\nize in one. Flexible strategies predispose toward generalist, rather\nthan specialist phenotypes that can be strategically deployed\nacross a wide range of environments. As with biological pre-\nparedness, developmental plasticity and behavioral flexibility are\nalso ultimately genetically influenced, and subject to the selective\npressures of genetic accommodation (including assimilation) of\nenvironmentally-triggered phenotypic changes during develop-\nment. For easy reference, a Glossary (see Supplementary Mate-\nrial) of technical terms that have been used throughout this paper\nhas been assembled.\nIn terms of SD-IE theory, those individuals that are higher\non strategic differentiation effort (who exhibit slower life history\nand are higher-K strategists) are likely to be more phenotypically\nplastic when compared with those higher on strategic integration\neffort (who exhibit faster life history and are lower-K strategists),\nwho should be more phenotypically flexible. Those higher on K\nshould also be less phenotypically prepared compared with those\nlower on K, who exhibit faster maturational rates and receive\nrelatively much less parental and nepotistic investment. Low-K\nindividuals must therefore be prepared for high flexibility early in\nlife with respect to tactics that can be differentially deployed con-\ntingent upon the immediate environment encountered. Levels of\nphenotypic preparedness might be less consistent among high-K\npopulations where selection is more uniformly directional with\nrespect to the occupation of specific micro-niches, rather than\ndiversifying with respect to diverse micro-niches. Under those\nmore stable conditions, preparedness is expected to be more her-\nitable and higher, although this will be traded off against a lower\namount of shorter-term flexibility, allowing individuals to pass\non highly genetically assimilated social roles across generations.\nThis might be interpreted as the ongoing evolution in humans of\nwhat are comparable in some ways to eusocial insect polyethisms\n(behaviorally specialized \"castes\"), which also appear to be con-\ntrolled by a combination of genetic and epigenetic influences\nSD-IE among humans has been corroborated with many\nlatent and outcome variables comprising the life history con-\ntinuum: these include the behavioral and cognitive indicators\nin the Arizona Life History Battery (ALHB; collectively measur-\ning the K-Factor), various personality dimensions, measures of\nWoodley of Menie et al. The genomic-level heritability of life history\nphysical and mental health (Figueredo et al., 2013b), and at the\ngroup-differences level, fertility, longevity, infant mortality, cra-\nnial capacity, crime rate indicators, economic indicators, over-\nall life satisfaction, prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases,\nskin reflectance, divorce rate, and height (Fernandes and Wood-\nWoodley et al., 2014). However, the genetic characteristics and\nconsequences of SD-IE have not yet been explored, which leaves\nvarious important questions unanswered: For example, is the\nSD-IE effect heritable?\nPredictions\nOn the basis of the aforementioned open research question, four\ntestable predictions have been formulated which will be explored\nusing two large and demographically representative samples of\ntwins sourced from the US and Sweden:\nPrediction 1: Individual differences in the degree of biologi-\ncal LH preparedness (Figueredo et al., 2006), i.e., the degree to\nwhich a population might be predisposed (or prepared) toward\ndeveloping a particular specialized set of life history traits, are\npartly heritable. Individual differences in biological prepared-\nness may have been shaped by a variety of related evolutionary\npressures, such as those relating to genetic accommodation\n(West-Eberhard, 2003), and also biased epigenetic rules of\ndevelopment, which may stem from gene-culture co-evolution\nPrediction 2: The individual differences-level SD-IE effects\nthemselves, which as in previous work, are defined as the effect of\nthe level of the higher-order life history factor upon its loadings\non the lower-order factors, will be heritable, evidencing the prin-\nciple of genetic constraints upon phenotypic plasticity (Wadding-\nEstimating the heritability of SD-IE is equivalent to estimating\nthe heritability of the aforementioned continuum of plasticity\nvs. flexibility.\nPrediction 3: The higher-order life history factor (Super-K), as\nwell as its lower-order factors, will be less heritable among slower\nthan among faster LH strategists. This follows on from the obser-\nvation made in previous work that the SD-IE effect appears to\nbe most pronounced on measures of life history that are more\nstrongly correlated with K than those that are less so (Figueredo\net al., 2013b). Put more simply, when a LH component disag-\ngregates at higher levels of the Super-K factor (i.e., when strate-\ngic differentiation occurs), the effect is biggest on those com-\nponents that load more strongly on the heritable latent factors.\nThis weakening of these correlations should therefore attenuate\nthe heritability of LH among those who are most strategically\ndifferentiated, i.e., those highest on the latent factors.\nPrediction 4: It has been demonstrated that weaker\nintergenerational mobility prevails in Sweden compared to\nNorth-American countries in terms of skills and expertise\n(Western and Wright, 1994), and that Swedes exhibit relatively\nhigh status persistence across surname generations (Clark et al.,\n2013). Therefore the Swedish sample should exhibit higher levels\nof heritability across traits relative to the American sample,\nevidencing a greater degree of assimilation of individuated life\nhistory strategies.\nMethods\nSamples of Participants\nSample 1 was comprised of a nationally-representative subsam-\nof same-sex dizygotic (DZ) twins (ages 25\u00ad74) from Wave 1\nStates (MIDUS; Brim et al., 2000), on which previous life history\nFigueredo and Rushton, 2009). The MIDUS Survey consisted of\na telephone interview and two follow-up mail surveys given to\na nationally representative sample, collected in two longitudi-\nnal data collection waves, the first wave over a one year period\nited to English speakers in the United States between the ages of\non singletons (non-twins) as well as on a genetically informative\nsample of same-sex MZ and DZ twins pairs. The MIDUS data\nwere used with written permission from the MIDUS program,\nobtained through their web site (http://www.midus.wisc.edu/).\nThe use of this archival data was also approved by the Institu-\ntional Review Board of the University of Arizona, Office for the\nResponsible Conduct of Research, Human Subjects Protection\nProgram (http://orcr.arizona.edu/hspp).\nSample 2 was comprised of a sample of Swedish Twins, on\nwhich a similar selection of LH-related variables were available.\nThe data were collected from a large sample of twins from the\nSwedish Twins Registry (STR)--the STAGE cohort (Lichtenstein\nand 1985. Zygosity was determined by questions about intra-\npair similarities and was subsequently confirmed in 27% of the\ntwins in the STR using genotyping. For further details on the\nSTAGE cohort and zygosity determination in the STR see Licht-\nweb-survey. An invitation was sent via surface mail to 32,000\ntwins, 11,543 of whom completed at least one instrument in a\nweb questionnaire via the Internet. The final sample used in the\npresent study, after multiple imputation for missing data, con-\nsample was approved by the Regional Ethics Review Board in\nStockholm. Each participant provided written consent.\nMeasures\nThe measures used in the analyses involving the MIDUS cohorts\n(Covitality, the K factor and the GFP) have been detailed in\nRushton, 2009). The measures employed in the analyses involv-\ning the Swedish STAGE data were not precisely equivalent to\nthose employed in the MIDUS based study. As a measure of\nK, the Mini K was employed (Figueredo et al., 2006). This is a\n20 item short-form measure of K which exhibits adequate reli-\nability (0.73) and an excellent validity (0.91) (Figueredo et al.,\n2014). A 44-item short version of the Big five Inventory (John\net al., 1991) was employed as a measure of the GFP (the BFI-\n44). For Covitality, two questions tapping the domain of men-\ntal health were employed, one of which measured depression\nWoodley of Menie et al. The genomic-level heritability of life history\n(Magnusson Hanson et al., 2014), with the second measuring\nemotional exhaustion (Magnusson Hanson et al., 2008). These\nwere reverse scored such that high mental health equated to low\ndepression and emotional exhaustion.\nMissing Data Imputation\nMissing data must be addressed when utilizing longitudinal data.\nIf large amounts of missingness are present in a dataset, this\nmight bias parameter estimates and p-values, increasing type 1\nor type 2 error (Schlomer et al., 2010). For the analyses, missing\ndata were handled with multivariate imputation (Gorsuch, 1983;\nFigueredo et al., 2000) and multiple imputation, using PROC\nMI in SAS. Thus, data for each twin with in each category of\nzygosity were imputed as a separate individual prior to disag-\ngregating and then recombining them for further analysis. Twins\nwere then matched within twin dyads, and later randomly paired\nwith opposite-zygosity twin dyads for heritability analyses, as\ndescribed below. To avoid confusion, the use of the expression\n\"matching\" within each twin dyad will be restricted to mean the\nlinking of each twin with each corresponding co-twin (identi-\ncal sibling). Instead the expression \"pairing\" between these twin\ndyads is used, specifically meaning the random assignment of\nDZ twin dyads to MZ twin dyads not naturally associated across\nzygosities.\nMultivariate imputation (MVI) involved estimating unit-\nweighted factor scores for the component scales and composite\nlower-order factors using: (1) the means of the standardized\nscores for all items that were not missing within each scale and\n(2) the means obtained from the standardized scores for all\nthe indicator scales not missing within each factor (Figueredo\net al., 2000). Most of the scale and lower-order factor scores were\nrecovered this way. Unit-weighted factor scoring was applied, in\norder to avoid problems associated with the sample-specificity of\nfactor scoring coefficients produced by standard errors of incon-\nsistent magnitudes across different samples (Gorsuch, 1983).\nThese unit-weighted factor structures are therefore simply part-\nwhole correlations (here termed \"unit-weighted factor loadings\"\nfor convenience) between the latent composites and each of their\ncomponent indicator measures. Although some of the samples\nwere of sufficient size to reliably estimate differentially-weighted\nfactor scores and factor loadings, this one method was applied\nthroughout for consistency.\nFor those missing data that remained on the scale and factor\nscores, the EM algorithm, as implemented by SAS PROC MI was\nemployed. Each of the twin datasets were assigned 30 multiple\nimputations using this procedure. These were then aggregated at\nthe lower-order factor level across the 30 \"multiple imputations\"\nData Aggregation and Analytic Procedures\nThe Continuous Parameter Estimation Method (CPEM; Gor-\nsuch, 2005) was employed. This permits the change in the covari-\nance between two variables (such as a higher-order multivariate\nconstruct like Super-K and a constituent lower-order latent vari-\nable like Covitality) to be determined throughout the full range\nof another variable (such as the overall level of Super-K). For all\nLH domains sampled, correlation coefficients were estimated at\nthe individual level by taking the cross-product of the standard-\nized (Z) scores of each individual's performance on the relevant\nsubscales.\nPearson's Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient is defined\nas the mean cross-product of the standardized (\"Z\") scores:\n(ZxZy)/N (1)\nIt follows that the group mean of these individual-level\ncross-products automatically becomes the correlation coeffi-\ncient for each group under consideration. This is mathemati-\ncally inevitable by definition. Therefore, the cross-product itself\n(ZxZy) can be used as the individual-level \"raw score\" in CPEM\nto estimate the varying amount of strategic integration or differ-\nentiation \"effort\" in each group. Thus, computing and comparing\nthe group means of these cross-products using ANOVA automat-\nically calculates and compares group-level Pearson Correlation\nCoefficients. This tests the degree to which the strength of this\nrelationship varies between any discreet groups.\nWhen using more traditional methods for identifying changes\nin the strength of the correlation coefficient between groups, it\nis necessary to acquire samples of at least 75\u00ad100 respondents in\neach group, so as to stabilize the correlation coefficients for com-\nparison. As a graded method, CPEM does not require the poly-\ntomization of continuous distribution, by potentially problematic\nmethods such as the median split (Cohen and Cohen, 1983; Mac-\nCallum et al., 2002). Furthermore, CPEM permits one to regress\nthe individual cross-products of the z-scores on continuous as\nwell as categorical predictor variables, facilitating the application\nof this method to multiple regression/correlation (MRC) analyses\nas well as ANOVAs.\nIn the present study, Continuous Parameter Estimates (CPEs)\nfor all individual-level parameters were obtained by means of\nsimple cross-multiplications of the standardized scores involved\nin each model parameter. For example, SD-IE effects were\nestimated by cross-multiplying the standardized unit-weighted\nhigher-order factor scores with the standardized unit-weighted\nfactor loadings on all three lower-order factors. The mean val-\nues of these individual-level CPEs automatically yield Pearson's\nProduct-Moment Correlation Coefficients in the group-level\naggregate SD-IE effects.\nTo be able to estimate dyadic-level parameters using CPEM,\n50 randomly-assigned pairings of DZ twin dyads for each of the\nMZ twin dyads were performed. This procedure produced on\naverage 45 usable pairings (ranging from 39 to 50, due to differ-\ning numbers of MZ and DZ twins along with the vagaries of the\nrandom assignment process) for each MZ twin dyad, which were\nthen then aggregated across these randomly-assigned pairings to\nproduce the final CPEs for each MZ twin dyad, each representing\na single genome, with which a unique heritability coefficient can\nbe associated. The dyadic-level parameter estimates, such as her-\nitability coefficients, therefore apply to each MZ twin dyad, and\ncannot be uniquely associated with any particular DZ twin dyad,\nbecause the latter differ systematically in their genotypes within\nmatched dyads whereas MZ twins do not.\nWoodley of Menie et al. The genomic-level heritability of life history\nAs described above, first, the CPEs of SD-IE parameters for\neach individual co-twin were calculated, regardless of zygos-\nity. After matching and then pairing (as per the restricted\ndefinitions given above) twin dyads, heritability coefficients\nfor each randomly-assigned MZ-DZ dyad pairing were esti-\nmated, and then aggregated across these pairings to obtain\n\"individual-genome-level\" MZ dyadic means, for the SDIE\neffects. Individual-genome level heritabilities were estimated by\nCPEM by applying the Falconer Formula (Figueredo et al., 2004)\nseparately to each random MZ-DZ dyad pairing:\nThe mean values of these individual-genome-level CPEs of her-\nitability coefficients automatically yield values approximating\nthe group-level aggregates obtained using conventional methods\nAlthough more sophisticated analytical techniques are now\navailable for the estimation of heritability coefficients, such as\nbiometric structural equations models (SEM; Rijsdijk and Sham,\n2002), and while these more advanced methods are capable\nof providing additional information such as decomposing the\nshared genetic variance into additive and non additive compo-\nnents, the simpler but older Falconer Formula is more effective\nwhen using CPEM. As there is no obvious method of obtain-\ning the needed parameter estimates from SEM, the whole point\nof the present analytical strategy is to develop a method to gen-\nerate individual-genome-level heritability coefficients, which are\nhere termed individual transmissibilities on the basis that they\ncapture the degree to which a given trait is reliably transmitted\nacross generations (as reflected in the degree of twin-genomic\nsimilarity). Furthermore, this procedure entailed 50\u00ad100 random\npairings of DZ twin dyads with MZ dyads, for a combined cross-\ncultural sample of over 1000 MZ dyads. The estimation of these\nsuch models to be estimated and then meta-analytically aggre-\ngated. Such an approach would have been unwieldy, and difficult\nto interpret, as well as too computationally intensive for currently\navailable equipment. Finally, the aggregate-level heritabilities of\nthe higher- and lower-order factors in the MIDUS data have\nalready been analyzed by means of both the Falconer Formula\n(Figueredo et al., 2004) and a biometric Common Pathway Model\nSEM (Figueredo and Rushton, 2009), yielding nearly identical\nresults for broad-sense heritabilities. Of course, the latter method\nwas able to decompose the heritability coefficients into additive\nand non additive components, which, as acknowledged above is\nits major theoretical advantage, in addition to yielding narrow-\nsense heritability coefficients that were (as expected) lower than\nthe broad-sense heritability coefficients, which were the ones nec-\nessarily obtained by the old Falconer method. This was the basic\nreason why the MIDUS data were reanalyzed with a Common\nPathway Model SEM (Figueredo and Rushton, 2009), as the goal\nof that study was to estimate the non additive genetic variance\nin supporting the evolutionary-genetic hypothesis of recent and\ndirectional selection for these traits in human populations.\nIn double checking these relatively novel CPEM procedures,\nthe group-level aggregations in an alternative sequence were per-\nformed in order to demonstrate that approximately the same\nSD-IE effect parameter estimates were recoverable within an\nacceptable margin of rounding error. These alternative SD-IE\nestimates were obtained by means of bivariate regressions, speci-\nfied as follows: (1) using the standardized higher-order common\nfactor scores as the single predictor variable; and (2) using the\nstandardized factor loadings of the higher-order common factor\non each of the lower-order factors as the criterion variables. This\nis how SD-IE effects have been estimated previously (Figueredo\net al., 2013b). It is necessary to make sure that these new CPEM\nprocedures produced the same results as the old one. To examine\nthe robustness of the novel procedure as compared with the con-\nventional one, these bivariate regressions were performed sep-\narately on each of the randomized MZ-DZ dyad pairings and\nthen aggregated across them as literal replications, simulating\nwhat would have been obtained when meta-analyzing the regres-\nsion results of 50 independent samples of the same population to\nobtain a single, synthetic population-level regression coefficient.\nThe results of this alternative sequence of data aggregation and\nanalysis produced almost identical parameter estimates regard-\nless of which method was used. These complementary results can\nbe made available upon request.\nAfter these basic CPEM parameters were estimated, the two\nsamples (Sweden and USA) were compared by simple one-way\nanalyses of variance and tests for equality of means and vari-\nances were conducted. This was done first for the following: (1)\nthe heritabilities of the higher-order and lower-order life his-\ntory factors, (2) the heritabilities of the factor loadings of the\nlower-order life history factors, (3) and the heritabilities of the\nSD-IE effects of the higher-order factor upon the factor loadings\nof the lower-order life history factors. Secondly, this same test\nwas repeated for the following derived parameter estimates: (4)\nthe correlations among the Super-K factor and the heritabilities\nof the higher-order and lower-order life history factors, (5) the\ncorrelations among the Super-K factor and the heritabilities of\nthe factor loadings of the lower-order life history factors, and (6)\nthe correlations among the Super-K factor and the heritabilities\nof the SD-IE effects of the higher-order factor upon the factor\nloadings of the lower-order life history factors.\nFinally, variable skewness has been consistently demonstrated\nin previous SD-IE tests that used CPEM to have negligible effects\non the estimates of SD-IE effect magnitudes (Fernandes and\nthis has not been controlled in the present study.\nResults\nTable 1 presents the results of the tests for SD-IE, that is, the effect\nof the level of the Super-K upon its loadings on the lower-order\nfactors, among monozygotic twins. SD-IE effects were highly\ncomparable (not statistically different from each other at an a pri-\nori significance level of p < 0.05) between the two countries. The\nSD-IE parameters of the United States sample have already been\nreported in a previous paper (Figueredo et al., 2013b), but have\nWoodley of Menie et al.

This systematic comparison also per-\nmitted determination of whether the values estimated for the\nSwedish twins were higher than those of the US sample, which\nwould, consistent with predictions, suggest that the Swedes have\nbeen evolving toward greater degrees of genetic stratification.\nIt should be noted that, although the differences in heritabil-\nity between countries were not significant, the Swedish sample\nnonetheless presented a trend toward higher average heritabili-\nthe American sample) and for SD-IE (0.57 \u00b1 0.40, compared to\n0.42 \u00b1 0.26 in the American sample), while mean heritabilities\nfor the LH factors were quite similar (0.50 \u00b1 0.06 in the Swedish\nTable 3 presents the correlations between the level of each\nvariable and the individual-level heritability estimates, or indi-\nvidual transmissibilities, associated with each variable.

Finally, this method enabled the\ntesting of four specific predictions set out in the introduction:\n(1) that individual-level factor loadings of the higher-order life\nhistory factor on its lower-order factors will be partially herita-\nble, evidencing some degree of genetic preparedness; (2) that the\nindividual-level SD-IE effects themselves (the effects of the level\nof the higher-order life history factor upon its loadings on the\nlower-order factors) will be heritable, evidencing genetic influ-\nences upon individual differences in flexibility vs. plasticity; (3)\nthat the higher-order life history factor (Super-K), as well as its\nlower-order factors, will be less heritable at its higher levels than\nat its lower-levels; (4) that the Swedish sample will exhibit higher\nlevels of heritability across traits relative to the American sample,\nevidencing a transition toward greater preparedness and lower\nplasticity in the evolution of social polyethism.\nPrediction 1 was validated in the current study, with the factor\nloadings in both the US and Swedish samples indicating modest\nto high levels of heritability (the lowest was in the case of the GFP\nConsistent with prediction 2, the SD-IE effects were also heri-\nindicates that the degree to which individuals are predisposed\ntoward the canalization of a particular phenotype by virtue of the\nstrength of their individual factor loadings is partly under genetic\ncontrol. Furthermore, the degree to which individuals are capa-\nble of specialization once a particular developmental trajectory\nhas been assumed is also partly under genetic control.\nPrediction 3 was validated, as in both the Swedish and US\nsamples the heritability of Super-K was observed to significantly\ndecrease as a function of increasing levels of the latent variable.\nThis is consistent with the observation that across scales, the SD-\nIE effect is concentrated on the strongest measures of K, thus the\ndecline in heritability likely results from the fact that the K-factor\nitself weakens at high levels. The systematic comparisons revealed\nno significant differences between the samples in terms of the\nmagnitudes of these effects across the two populations.\nConcerning Prediction 4, the average heritability of the\nmeasured traits was not significantly higher in the Swedish sam-\nple than in the United States sample. Prediction 4 was there-\nfore not supported, although the pattern of results suggested\nthat the Swedish mean heritabilities might have been somewhat\nhigher given sufficient statistical power or lower inter-individual\nvariance in heritability coefficients. This fails to support the\nnotion that the Swedish population is relatively more genet-\nically differentiated in life history allocations than the North\nAmerican one.\nIt must be noted that in Sweden the K factor was assessed with\nthe Mini-K, therefore its heritability was expected to be lower\nthan that of the American K factor (which was measured with\nthe full ALHB) due to the fact that weaker measure reliabilities\ntend to attenuate correlations (Hunter and Schmidt, 2004). This\nproved to be the case, although the difference was non significant.\nAlthough the ability to estimate individual-genome transmis-\nsibilities might seem like a purely academic point of statistical\nlegerdemain, it opens up wide-ranging possibilities for future\nre studies. In this study, it was found that the mean levels of\nthe higher-order \"Super-K\" life history factor for each MZ Twin\nDyad predicted a variety of SD-IE effects, as well as the trans-\nmissibilities of their higher-order and the lower order factor\nscores, the factor loadings of the lower-order indicators, and the\ngenomic transmissibilities of all of these parameters. Consider-\ning these analyses a \"proof of concept\" as well as an interesting\nfinding in their own right, this same logic can be extended to\nmodel the covariation of transmissibility coefficients with any\nother set of predictor or criterion variables. For example, other\ncausal influences, whether genetic or environmental in origin,\ncould be used to investigate potential moderation effects on these\ntransmissibilities.\nWoodley of Menie et al. The genomic-level heritability of life history\nThus, the ability to estimate individual-genome transmissibil-\nities opens up wide-ranging possibilities for future studies. For\nexample gene-gene and regulatory gene interactions with other\nadaptive traits might be involved in the development of: (1) pre-\nparedness or plasticity in behavior, at the developmental level;\nand (2) the extrinsic variability that might be present in the\nexternal environment, may provide the selective pressures over\nevolutionary time for these conditional adaptations. Molecular\nbiomarkers could in principle be linked to individual transmissi-\nbilities, therefore the epigenetic biochemical mechanisms of pre-\nparedness and plasticity could be elucidated at the proximate\nlevel of causation.\nThese exciting possibilities were opened up primarily by\nthe application of the Continuous Parameter Estimation Model\n(CPEM) to heritability analysis, which has never been attempted\nhitherto. Furthermore, one of the advantages of CPEM is that the\nCPEs for these individual transmissibilities can be subjected to\nsubsequent analyses by a wide array of other parametric statistical\nmethods. These include analysis of variance and multiple regres-\nsion (as illustrated in the present paper), but may also be extended\nto path analysis, factor analysis, hierarchical linear models, gen-\neralizability theory analyses, etc. This is not an entirely different\nmethod for constructing biometric models, merely an addition to\nthe armamentarium of complementary analytical tactics that may\nbe applied.\nSupplementary Material\nThe Supplementary Material for this article can be found\nonline at: http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.\nReferences\nArmstrong, E.
