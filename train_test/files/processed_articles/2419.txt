    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: US mentholated cigarette sales have increased considerably over 50 years. Preference for\nmentholated cigarettes is markedly higher in Black people. While menthol itself is not genotoxic or carcinogenic,\nits acute respiratory effects might affect inhalation of cigarette smoke. This possibility seems consistent with the\nhigher lung cancer risk in Black men, despite Black people smoking less and starting smoking later than White\npeople. Despite experimental data suggesting similar carcinogenicity of mentholated and non-mentholated\ncigarettes, the lack of convincing evidence that mentholation increases puffing, inhalation or smoke uptake, and\nthe similarity of lung cancer rates in Black and White females, a review of cigarette mentholation and lung cancer\nis timely given current regulatory interest in the topic.\nMethods: Epidemiological studies comparing lung cancer risk in mentholated and non-mentholated cigarette\nsmokers were identified from MedLine and other sources. Study details were extracted and strengths and\nweaknesses assessed. Relative risk estimates were extracted, or derived, for ever mentholated use and for long-term\nuse, overall and by gender, race, and current/ever smoking, and meta-analyses conducted.\nResults: Eight generally good quality studies were identified, with valid cases and controls, and appropriate\nadjustment for age, gender, race and smoking. The studies afforded good power to detect possible effects.\nHowever, only one study presented results by histological type, none adjusted for occupation or diet, and some\nprovided no results by length of mentholated cigarette use.\nThe data do not suggest any effect of mentholation on lung cancer risk. Adjusted relative risk estimates for ever\nBlack people (0.90, 0.73-1.10, n = 4). Estimates for current and ever smokers are similar. The combined estimate for\nConclusion: Higher lung cancer rates in Black males cannot be due to their greater preference for mentholated\ncigarettes. While some study weaknesses exist, the epidemiological evidence is consistent with mentholation\nhaving no effect on the lung carcinogenicity of cigarettes.\nBackground\nAccording to Giovino et al. [1], who summarized evi-\ndence from over 50 countries, the market share of\nmentholated cigarettes is relatively high in the Philip-\nUnited States (26%) and Singapore (22%), though it is\nless than 5% in half the countries considered. They\nreported that, in the United States, Newport brands\naccounted for 29.7% of all menthol sales, with Kool\nabout equally distributed. According to Hebert and\nKabat [2], mentholated cigarettes were introduced in the\n1930s, but did not exceed 3% of the total US market\nuntil 1949, when a slow but steady rise in market share\nCorrespondence: PeterLee@pnlee.co.uk\nP.N.

This interest not only\nconcerns whether added ingredients may alter the inher-\nent disease risks of smoking, but also includes consid-\neration of whether ingredients may render cigarettes\nmore palatable, so as to increase initiation of smoking\nor decrease the ability of smokers to quit. The Family\nSmoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, signed\ninto law in the U.S.A. in mid-2009, included a specific\nprovision to ban characterizing flavouring ingredients\nother than menthol from use in cigarettes. A further\nreview of the exemption of menthol is ongoing at the\ntime of writing, with an advisory report and opinion to\nbe provided to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\nby the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee\n(TPSAC) in 2011 (http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommit-\ntees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/TobaccoProductsS-\ncientificAdvisoryCommittee/default.htm). Similar\nquestions on whether added ingredients may increase\nthe risks, attractiveness or addictiveness of tobacco pro-\nducts have also been posed by the European Commis-\nsion to the EU Scientific Committee on Emerging and\nNewly-Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) (http://ec.\neuropa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consultations/\npublic_consultations/scenihr_cons_12_en.htm), and the\nprocess of public consultation on the SCENIHR pre-\nconsultation opinion on added ingredients is presently\nongoing.\nThe principal objective of this paper is to carry out a\nsystematic review, conducted according to the PRISMA\nguidelines [4] of the epidemiological evidence comparing\nthe risk of lung cancer in smokers of mentholated and\nnon-mentholated cigarettes. As background to this\nassessment it is helpful to start by summarizing other\nrelevant evidence related to menthol itself and to\nmentholated cigarettes.\nMenthol\nOH) is a monocyclic terpene alcohol\noccurring as four pairs of optical isomers. (-) - Menthol,\noften referred to as l-menthol, is the isomer most widely\nseen in nature, and is the one assumed by the name\nmenthol. It occurs naturally in over 100 essential oils\n[5], in high concentrations in peppermint oil (from\nMentha piperita) and cornmint, or Japanese, mint oil\n(from Mentha arvensis), being readily extracted from\nthe plant by steam distillation [6]. It has a characteristic\npeppermint odour and gives a cooling sensation when\napplied to skin and mucosal surfaces [6]. It has been\nwidely used for many years, and there seems no reason\nfor concern that it is carcinogenic or genotoxic [7,8]. A\nrecent review [9] notes that menthol is currently\napproved by the US FDA for use in over-the-counter\nlozenges, topical preparations and vapour inhalation\nproducts based on its antipuritic and antitussive proper-\nties, and is widely used as a food flavouring, for which it\nis declared \"Generally Recognized as Safe\" (GRAS).\nEccles [6] has reviewed the evidence relating to possi-\nble effects of menthol, including nasal decongestant\nactivity, inhibition of respiratory reflexes, antitussive effi-\ncacy, effects on mucus production and mucociliary\nclearance, improvement of pulmonary function and\nenhancement of sensations in the oral cavity. Although\nthe evidence is not always very clear, it suggests that\nmenthol has an acute effect on the mouth, nose and\nrespiratory tract and certainly leaves open the possibility\nthat menthol in cigarettes might affect puff volume,\ndepth of inhalation and other aspects of how a cigarette\nis smoked. More recently, Garten and Falkner [10]\nspeculated that menthol might induce unconscious\nbreath holding, so allowing for greater transfer of\ninhaled tobacco smoke constituents into the pulmonary\nblood, and hence leading to an increased dependence on\nnicotine and risk of tobacco attributable disease.\nMentholated cigarettes\nCarcinogenicity, genotoxicity and pharmacological effects\nWhile combustion of menthol under anaerobic pyrolysis\nconditions can produce compounds such as 3,4-benz-\npyrene which are known carcinogens [11-13], menthol\npyrolysis in cigarettes does not give rise to any measur-\nno notable differences in benzpyrene between major US\nmentholated and non-mentholated cigarette brands [20].\nTwo studies compared mouse skin activity of conden-\nsates prepared from mentholated and non-mentholated\ncigarettes, but found no significant difference in either\ntumourigenic activity [21] or tumour promoting poten-\ntial [22]. Gaworski et al. [5,23] reported results from\ntwo 13-week inhalation studies where rats were exposed\nto the smoke of cigarettes with or without added\nmenthol, or to filtered air. In the second experiment\n[23], the test cigarette differed from the reference cigar-\nette in having various other flavour ingredients added as\nwell as menthol. In both studies, dose-related histo-\npathological changes, mainly of respiratory tract epithe-\nlia, were found in rats exposed to mainstream smoke.\nHowever, the changes were similar in cigarettes with\nand without menthol, not neoplastic, and diminished\nsignificantly after a 6-week recovery period. A later 90-\nday study [24] also found no meaningful differences in\nsmoke-related changes between the mentholated and\nnon-mentholated cigarettes. Although these results pro-\nvide no concern regarding possible carcinogenic effects\nresulting from cigarette mentholation, it should be\nnoted that results of long term (2 yr+) inhalation studies\nhave never been reported.\nHeck [9] recently reviewed evidence comparing the in\nvitro cytotoxicity and genetic toxicity of smoke conden-\nsates and gas-phase material from mentholated and\nnon-mentholated cigarettes, finding no meaningful\ndifferences.\nEffects on smoking characteristics\nMany studies [25-44] have compared mentholated and\nnon-mentholated cigarette smokers on one or more of\nthe most commonly studied smoking indices: number of\npuffs, puff volume, carbon monoxide (CO) and cotinine.\nNearly all the studies cited took into account possible\nracial differences. Of seven studies investigating number\nof puffs, four [25-28] found no significant effect of\nmentholation, and three [29-31] reporting significantly\nfewer puffs when smoking mentholated cigarettes. Of\nsix studies on puff volume, two studies [26,27] found no\neffect, three [29-31] a significant decrease when smoking\nmentholated cigarettes, and one [32] a significant\nincrease in CO level associated with mentholation (and\none [30] claimed an increase not apparent from the ana-\nno effect of mentholation, and one [27] reported\nreduced CO in mentholated cigarette smokers. Three\nstudies [32-34] reported a significant increase in cotinine\nlevel associated with mentholation, but nine studies\nmore subjects (3,341) than all the other studies com-\nbined. Most of this evidence was considered in a review\ndence (e.g. on heart rate, blood pressure, total particu-\nlate matter, and serum thiocyanate) concluded that\n\"Taken as a whole, the data provide little consistent sup-\nport for the idea that mentholation may affect how a\ncigarette is smoked so as to increase uptake of toxic\nsmoke constituents\". A more recent review reached\nsimilar conclusions [9].\nFive studies have compared age of starting to smoke\nin mentholated and non-mentholated cigarette smokers.\nNo significant differences were seen in the largest study\nfor race, in two studies in Black people [47,48], or in\ntwo other studies [49,50] which did not adjust for race.\nsubjects, reported that, in both Black and White people,\nmentholated cigarette smokers smoked significantly\nfewer cigarettes per day than did non-mentholated\ncigarette smokers. Reduced cigarette consumption has\nreported that the reduction was only evident in Black\npeople, with an increase in White people. However, no\nsignificant difference was seen in another study of over\nother studies, three conducted in Black people\n[49,57] which did not take race into account.\nSixteen studies have reported results on quitting, race\nbeing accounted for in all but one [53]. The two largest\n[46,52] found no difference by mentholation. No signifi-\ncant differences were also seen in eight other studies\nof these [62,63], both trials of smoking cessation, the\nlower quit rate in mentholated cigarette smokers was\nonly seen in the first month or so, longer follow-up of\nthe subjects finding no difference in quit rate. In one\nstudy [64], the reduced rate of quitting was only evident\nin Black and Hispanic people combined, a significantly\nincreased rate of quitting being seen in White people.\nThe evidence summarized above does not suggest that\nmentholation of cigarettes is associated with an earlier\n(or later) age of starting smoking or any increase in\ncigarette consumption per smoker. Any effect on quit-\nting, if it exists, seems probably quite small.\nDifferences between Black and White people in the US\nRelative use of mentholated cigarettes\nAmong United States smokers, preference for mentho-\nlated cigarettes is much greater in Black than White\npeople. Data from the 2008 National Survey on Drug\nUse and Health (NSDUH) presented in Table 1 show\nTable 1 Relative use of mentholated cigarettes in US\nBlack and White people in 2008 by gender and agea\n% of current smokers using mentholated\ncigarettesb\nGender Age White people Black people\na Derived from the NSDUH (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/cgi-bin/SDA/\nb Current smokers were asked whether they had smoked mentholated or\nregular cigarettes most in the past 30 days.\nthe difference is clearly seen in both sexes and in all age\ngroups (except for 12-17 year-old females). It can also\nbe seen in earlier NSDUH surveys (see [45]). Despite\nthis marked difference, the much higher proportion of\nWhite people implies that many more White than Black\npeople smoke mentholated cigarettes. The tendency for\nBlack people to prefer mentholated cigarettes has long\nbeen evident. For example, in a national study in 1986\ncited by the US Surgeon-General [65], 75.5% of Black\nand 23.1% of White smokers used mentholated\ncigarettes.\nRelative lung cancer rates in Black and White people in the\nUS\nthat age-adjusted incidence rates were 36% higher in\nBlack men than in White men, and mortality rates 31%\nhigher. In females, however, incidence rates were 0.5%\nlower and mortality rates 5% lower. Table 2 shows US\nlung cancer mortality rates by race, gender, year (2000,\n2005), and age. In both sexes, the ratio of rates in Black\npeople compared to White people tends to decline with\nage, with the clearest excesses seen in younger males\n(especially in 2000), lesser excesses seen in older males\nand younger females, and no excess seen in older\nthat the greater preference of Black people for mentho-\nlated cigarettes might help explain their higher lung\ncancer rates, the greater preference is similarly evident\nin both genders, but the excess lung cancer rate is only\nin males.\nDifferences in smoking habits between Black and White\npeople in the US\nIn the United States, there are other relevant differences\nin smoking habits between White and Black smokers.\nTable 3 summarizes findings from the National Health\nInterview Survey for 2006. These are consistent with\nhave a slightly higher prevalence of smoking, a later age\nof starting to smoke, a lower daily cigarette consump-\ntion per smoker, a lower propensity to quit, and a pre-\nference for cigarettes higher in tar and nicotine.\nAccording to Novotny et al. [70] the difference in smok-\ning prevalence by race disappears if adjustment is made\nfor occupation, education and other socioeconomic and\ndemographic factors, but the differences in amount\nsmoked per smoker and probability of quitting do not.\nThe evidence is also consistent that Black smokers\nhave higher cotinine levels than White smokers\nBlack females. After adjusting for age, education, gender,\ncigarettes/day, nicotine content, years of smoking, inha-\nlation frequency and ETS exposure, the difference was\nestimated to be 83.3 ng/ml, with the higher level in\nBlack people significant for both mentholated cigarette\nsmokers (89.0 ng/ml) and non-mentholated cigarette\nOf the characteristics considered above, some would\npredict lower lung cancer rates in Black people (fewer\never smokers, later age of starting, and lesser amount\nsmoked per smoker) and some higher rates (more cur-\nrent smokers, reduced quitting, higher tar level, and\nhigher cotinine levels).\nMethods\nSelection of studies\nStudies selected satisfied four conditions: based on\nresearch on humans, of cohort or case-control design,\nany form of lung cancer as the outcome, and risk esti-\nmates comparing mentholated and non-mentholated\ncigarette smokers available or able to be calculated.\nRelevant publications were initially sought from a\nMedLine search conducted in August 2010, on \"Lung\ncancer and (menthol or mentholated cigarettes)\" limited\nto \"Humans\", from recent reviews relating to mentho-\nlated cigarettes [9,45], and from reference lists of rele-\nvant publications identified. Subsequently, in February\nTable 2 Relative lung cancer mortality rates in US White\nand Black people by gender, year and agea\nWhite people Black people Black/White\nGender Year Age Deaths Rate Deaths Rate Rate\naDerived from the National Center for Health Statistics website (http://wonder.\ncdc.gov).\n2011, the MedLine search was repeated, and additional\npapers sought from further similar searches conducted\nusing Google Scholar, Scopus, Scirus, Science Direct\nand Academic Search Complete, and also from reference\nlists of new relevant publications identified.\nData extraction\nFrom each publication details extracted included:\n\u00b7 study design (prospective cohort, hospital case-con-\ntrol, population case-control)\n\u00b7 study location and timing\n\u00b7 sexes, races and age groups studied\n\u00b7 whether current or ever smokers were studied\n\u00b7 other inclusion criteria\n\u00b7 cases - definition, number studied\n\u00b7 controls (for case-control studies) - definition,\nmatching to cases, number studied\n\u00b7 at risk population (for cohort studies) - definition,\nnumber studied\n\u00b7 questions asked relating to mentholation of cigar-\nettes (and brands of cigarettes smoked) and the variables\nused to quantify exposure\n\u00b7 statistical methods used for analysis\n\u00b7 adjustment variables considered\n\u00b7 availability of results by histological type, and\n\u00b7 main conclusions reached by the authors.\nRelative risk estimates\nFor simplicity, the term \"relative risk\" (RR) is used gen-\nerically in this paper to include various estimators of it,\nincluding the odds ratio and the hazard ratio.\nStudies varied in the extent to which they reported\nestimates of RR with a 95% confidence interval (CI).\nThe reported estimates were supplemented by derived\nestimates, in an effort to present, as far as possible, esti-\nmates by extent of mentholated cigarette use and over-\nall, by gender separately and combined, by race\nseparately and combined, by age groups separately and\ncombined, by histological type of lung cancer separately\nand combined, in current or ever smokers separately\nand combined, and also by extent of adjustment for\nconfounding variables. The full set of RR (CI) estimates\nfor each study, reported and derived, are given in the\ntables which describe the results for each individual\nstudy. Details of how the various estimates were derived\nare given in additional file 1: Methods for deriving RR\nestimates. Three main techniques were used: Unadjusted\nestimates were derived from numbers of cases and con-\ntrols using standard methods [78], independent esti-\nmates were combined using fixed-effect meta-analysis\n[79], and non-independent estimates (relative to a com-\nmon comparison group) were combined using the\nmethod of Hamling et al. [80].\nSummary of study characteristics, strengths and\nweaknesses\nThe features of the studies were first described study-\nby-study and then summarized in a table. For each of a\nnumber of features (study type, location, timing, possible\noverlaps between the studies, number of cases, adequacy\nof cases, adequacy of controls, reliability of data col-\nlected, adjustment for potential confounding variables,\nand statistical methods used), the propensity for bias\nwas considered, and strengths and weaknesses of the\noverall evidence of specific studies evaluated. Study\nquality was also independently assessed, using the nine-\npoint Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale\n(NOS) [81], by the author and a colleague (K.J.\nCoombs), with any discrepancies resolved by discussion.\nMeta-analyses\nFixed-effect and random-effects meta-analyses were con-\nducted, and heterogeneity chisquared statistics esti-\nmated, using standard methods [79]. The principal\ncomparison was between smokers who had ever or\nnever used mentholated cigarettes, though as this was\nTable 3 Differences in cigarette smoking habits between White and Black adults - findings from the National Health\nMales Females\nWhite people Black people White people Black people\nAmong the whole population\nAmong ever smokers\nAmong current smokersb\naDerived from http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/cgi-bin/SDA/ICPSR.\nbIncludes current every day and some day smokers.\nnot available in some studies RRs for similar compari-\nsons (e.g. usual brand mentholated cigarettes or not;\ncurrent brand mentholated or not) were also included\nin the meta-analysis. A secondary comparison used the\nsame comparison group (never or non-current mentho-\nlated cigarettes), but assessed risk relating to long-term\nuse of mentholated cigarettes, using the maximum\nextent of exposure available for the study (e.g. 20+ years\nuse or 32+ pack-years use). The main analyses used\ncombined estimates for the whole population studied,\nbut subgroup analyses give results by gender, race,\nsmoking status, study quality, study size (number of\ncases in mentholated cigarette smokers), study design,\nand publication date. Sensitivity analyses excluded the\nsmaller of these studies, where there was a possible\noverlap in cases between studies. For the main analysis,\npublication bias was investigated by Egger's test [82] and\nby a funnel plot, in which the logarithm of the RR is\nplotted against its (inverse-variance) weight.\nChecking\nDr. J.S. Fry independently checked the extraction of data\nfrom the source publications, the derivation of addi-\ntional relative risk estimates and the conduct of the\nmeta-analyses.

Cases were histo-\nlogically confirmed and identified within seven months\nof diagnosis. Controls under age 65 were randomly\nselected from licensed drivers, whilst those over age 65\nwere randomly selected from Medicare Beneficiaries.\nCases and controls were frequency matched on age,\ngender and race. Cases and controls had to be resident\nin Los Angeles County, aged 40-84, able to complete a\nquestionnaire in English, be Caucasian (non-Hispanic)\nor African American people, and with no previous can-\ncer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer). Subjects\nwere interviewed regarding known and possible risk fac-\ntors for lung cancer, including smoking history, occupa-\ntional exposures, ETS exposure and family history of\nlung cancer. Menthol smoking was classified based on\nresponse to the question \"On average over your lifetime,\nout of every 100 cigarettes you smoked, how many were\nmenthol?\".\nand provided smoking information including menthol\nstatus. The analysis was restricted to the cases (202\ncigarettes in their life). The analyses presented used\nunconditional logistic regression, with adjustment for\nage, race, gender, total pack-years and years since quit-\nting smoking. Other potential confounding variables\n(fruits, vegetables, occupational exposures, family history\nand ETS) had no appreciable influence on the associa-\ntion with mentholated cigarette smoking and were\ntherefore not included in the regression models.\nRRs and CIs were presented by pack-years of mentho-\nlated smoking (Table 6), percentage of mentholated\ncigarettes smoked (Table 7) and type of cigarette smoker\n(Table 8). RRs and CIs are available (or can be derived)\nwhich are unadjusted, adjusted for the matching factors\ngender, age and race, or adjusted for the matching fac-\ntors as well as for total pack-years and years since quit-\nting smoking. No results are available for current and\nformer smokers separately. Results by pack-years of\nmentholated smoking are separately available by gender,\nand by race.\nFor all subjects, the RRs comparing smokers who have\never and never used mentholated cigarettes are close to\n1.0, when adjustment is made for the matching factors\nand the smoking variables considered. Due to rounding\nof RRs presented by level for the three aspects of\nmentholated cigarette smoking, these calculated esti-\nmates are not quite the same in the three tables, being\nin Tables 6, 7 and 8 respectively. The results in Table 6\nalso show that the ever/never mentholated RR is quite\nevidence of any variation in risk by proportion of\nmentholated cigarettes smoked (Table 7) or by cigarette\nsmoker type (Table 8). After adjustment for the match-\nmenthol/regular (non-mentholated), as compared to\nexclusive regular.\nThe only apparent suggestion of an effect of mentho-\nlated cigarette smoking is for the results by pack-years\n(Table 6). In interpreting these results, it is important to\nrealise, that the RRs which are unadjusted or are\nadjusted only for the matching factors may be biased by\nthe greater likelihood of inclusion of current and long\nterm smokers in the higher pack-years categories.

Unlike the previous papers, which\nwere primarily concerned with risk of lung cancer in\nrelation to mentholated cigarette use, the main objective\nof this paper was to compare risk in White and Black\nAmericans. As for the first paper [68], it was based on\ndata from the American Health Foundation multicentre\nhospital case-control study, though the subjects were\nnot exactly the same. The controls were hospitalized\npatients with conditions thought not to be associated\nwith smoking, and were matched to the cases on age,\ngender, hospital and year of interview.

These features\nare discussed below, with comments where relevant on\nthe strengths and weaknesses of the studies.\nStudy type\nThe eight studies covered the three most common types\nof design used in epidemiological research, with two\nprospective cohort studies [51,56], three hospital case-\n[56] was based on follow-up subjects entering a clinical\ntrial. The prospective design virtually excludes the possi-\nbility of recall bias. However, both such studies based\ntheir analysis on use of mentholation at baseline, which\ncould be over 10 years before the lung cancer occurred,\nand might have changed during the follow-up period.\nNeither of these studies concerned representative sam-\nples. The clinical trial [56] concerned subjects with mild\nor moderate airways obstruction, while subjects in the\nKaiser Permanente study [51] had to attend for multi-\nphasic health check-up and were noted to be somewhat\nmore educated than the local population and under-\nrepresentative of the extremes of wealth and poverty.\nHowever, any differential risk of mentholated and non-\nmentholated cigarettes seems unlikely to vary by educa-\ntion, income or prevalence of airway obstruction, so bias\nshould not occur. While case-control studies suffer from\nthe problem that exposure is determined after onset of\ndisease, it is unclear, however, why accuracy of reporting\nrelative use of mentholated and non-mentholated cigar-\nettes should differ materially between lung cancer cases\nand controls.\nLocation\nAll but one of the studies were conducted in the United\nStates. The study in Germany [84], reported as an\nabstract, involved a population where mentholated\ncigarette use is quite low, and its results, based on a\nrelatively small number of lung cancer cases in mentho-\nlated cigarette smokers, contribute relatively little to the\nmeta-analyses described later.\nTiming\nInasmuch as mentholated cigarettes only reached an\nmight expect studies starting later to have more chance\nof detecting possible effects. However, data by period of\nmentholated cigarette use were only reported in the first\ndetermine lung cancer risk for very long term (e.g. 40+\nyears) use. However, any major difference in risk\nbetween the two types of cigarette might be expected to\nemerge in the studies so far conducted.\nPossible overlaps between the studies\nIt is clear from the information on study location and\ntiming in Table 14, that double-counting of cases is only\na possible problem for the three hospital case-control\nstudies. Though the range of years and hospitals varied\nbetween the studies, it is likely that there was some\noverlap in the patients considered. Without reference\nback to the original data, there is no completely satisfac-\ntory solution to this. To avoid loss of power, our main\nanalyses include the data from all the studies, ignoring\nthe overlap, though it is recognized that this may\nslightly overstate statistical significance. However, as a\nsensitivity test, some analyses were also run excluding\nthe results from two of these three studies, the first\nAmerican Health Foundation Study [68] and the Slone\nEpidemiology Center Study [53], only retaining results\nfrom the second American Health Foundation Study\n[83], the study with the largest number of lung cancer\ncases in mentholated cigarette smokers.\nNumber of cases and power to detect an effect\nThe number of cases considered in the analyses ranged\nsecond American Health Foundation multicentre study\n[83].

The German study\nwas less powerful and would only have detected an\nexcess risk of about 65%.\nAdequacy of the cases\nFive of the case-control studies confirmed the diagnosis\nby histology/pathology, but the German case-control\nstudy [84] gave no details. In all these studies, the lung\ncancer was recently diagnosed. One of the cohort stu-\ndies [51] gave no information regarding diagnosis of\ntheir incident cases, but the other [56], which only con-\nsidered deaths, classified cause of death based on a\nreview of death certificates, autopsy reports, relevant\nmedical records, and interviews with attending physi-\ncians.

Since only one of the studies [56] seemed\nto consider autopsy evidence, it is likely that some of\nthe cases included were false-positives. However, the\nprocedures taken in most, if not all, of the studies\nwould have greatly reduced this possibility. Although\nknowledge of smoking habits may affect the likelihood\nof a lung cancer being detected in life [87,88], it seems\nimplausible that knowledge of mentholation status\nwould do so. It is therefore unlikely that inaccuracy of\ndiagnosis will have had any material effect in these\nstudies.\nAdequacy of the controls\npatients with diseases unrelated to smoking as controls.\nThe descriptions of the controls used were as follows:\nAmerican Health Foundation Study [68] \"Controls\nwere hospitalized patients with conditions thought not\nbe associated with smoking, including: cancers (of the\ncolon, stomach, female breast, prostate, and skin, as well\nas leukaemia, lymphoma, sarcomas, etc.); benign neo-\nplastic diseases; and non-neoplastic conditions (such as\nmusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, eye\nconditions, injuries, etc.).\"\nSlone Epidemiology Center study [53] \"Controls had\nbeen admitted for conditions judged to be unrelated to\ncigarette smoking. The most common control diagnoses\nincluded cancers or benign tumors of the breast, colon\nand rectum, prostate, and other non-tobacco-related\nsites (45 percent); diseases of the digestive (14 percent),\ngenitourinary (10 percent), or musculoskeletal (7 per-\ncent) systems; and injury (13 percent). Respiratory or\nupper gastrointestinal conditions, regardless of etiology,\nwere excluded.\"\nSecond American Health Education Study [83] \"Eli-\ngible control diagnoses excluded tobacco-related dis-\neases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral\nvascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,\ngastric ulcer, cirrhosis of the liver, and cancers of the\nmouth, larynx, esophagus, bladder, kidney, pancreas, or\nliver.\" They go on to note the percentage of male and\nfemale controls with specific diseases.\nWhen discussing the first of these three studies [68],\nSidney et al. [51] claimed that \"some of these conditions\nmight have been associated with menthol use, obscuring\nTable 15 Summary of the main features of the epidemiological studies of cigarette mentholation and lung cancer\nCharacteristic Level N (%) Characteristic Level N (%)\nStudy design Cases in mentholated cigarette smokers\nControls matched on age and gender\nFirst year of study Menthol dose-response studied\nRace accounted for\nGenders studied\nSmoking groups used in analysis\nCases studied\nan association with lung cancer\". However, it seems\nrather unlikely that a disease that is not affected by\nsmoking non-mentholated cigarettes would be affected\nby smoking mentholated cigarettes. Risk of some of the\ncancers (stomach, breast, and perhaps colon) may,\naccording to recent evidence, be moderately associated\nwith smoking. However, as they form only a proportion\nof the total controls, and may not be related to menthol\nuse anyway, it seems unlikely that their inclusion would\nhave caused material bias.\nOf the three population case-control studies\nreported only as an abstract with no details given of\nhow the controls were derived.\nIn the Los Angeles county study [69], the population\ncontrols used were derived from registers of licensed\ndrivers aged under 65 and of Medicare Beneficiaries\naged over 65. However, there seems no guarantee that\ncases aged under 65 could drive or that cases aged over\n65 used Medicare. If ability to drive or use of Medicare\nis associated with use of mentholated cigarettes, some\nbias might occur.\nIn the Houston study of Black people [85], the cases\nand controls were drawn only from the metropolitan\narea of Houston. While the cases were recruited \"from\nthe University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center\nand the Michael E. De Bakey VA Medical Center\", the\ncontrols were recruited \"from Houston area community\ncenters and the Kelsey-Seybold Clinic, Houston's largest\nmultispeciality physicians group practice\". It is not\napparent how representative the controls were of the\npopulation from which the cases were drawn.\nIn both these studies there was no clear difference in\nresponse rate between cases and controls. This was sta-\nted to be about 75% in both cases and controls in the\nHouston study [85] and can be estimated as 70% in\ncases and 75% in controls in the Los Angeles County\nstudy [69]. Response rates were not given for the Ger-\nman study [84] or for two of the case-control studies\n[53,68], but in the second American Health Foundation\nstudy [83], it was noted that \"approximately 85% of eli-\ngible patients who were approached agreed to be inter-\nviewed\", though separate figures for cases and controls\nwere not given.\nReliability of the data collected\nAll the studies are limited by possible inaccuracies in\nthe reporting of smoking history and mentholation sta-\ntus. Random errors tend to bias relative risk estimates\ntowards 1.0 and reduce the power of the study to detect\na true effect. However, errors may not be random. For\nexample, subjects may tend to think their past habits\nwere more like their current habits than they actually\nwere.\nThe source of the data on mentholation is summar-\nized in Table 16. As can be seen, this varies from study\nabout brand smoked. In two of these studies [51,53],\nsubjects were also asked whether they smoked mentho-\nlated cigarettes but no mention is made of any cross-\ncheck being made with the brands reported. One of the\nstudies reporting results for ever smokers [53] only\nasked about the most recent brand and that used for\nthe longest period, resulting in incomplete information\non mentholated cigarette use for many subjects.\nThe effect that error in determining mentholation sta-\ntus might have had on the relative risk estimates is not\nclear. Inasmuch as mentholated cigarettes have a dis-\ntinctive taste, any errors may not be too great.\nIn the Slone Epidemiology Center study [53], subjects\nwith an unknown brand history before 1956 were\nassumed to have smoked non-mentholated cigarettes at\nthat time. This would probably have led to some over-\nestimation of the numbers of non-mentholated cigarette\nsmokers and slightly reduced the power to detect effects\nof mentholation. However, as the assumption applied\nequally to cases and controls, this is unlikely to have\ncaused material bias.\nAdjustment for potential confounding variables\nExcept for the German study [84] and the Houston\nstudy of Black people [85], all the studies either adjusted\nfor race, or presented race-specific results from which\nrace-adjusted overall results could be calculated. All the\nstudies adjusted for age, and all either adjusted for gen-\nder or presented results from which gender-adjusted\noverall results could be calculated.\nAll the studies adjusted for smoking variables, with\nthree studies adjusting for cigarettes per day and dura-\nfor indices of total exposure - pack-years [69,83] or total\namount smoked [84]. Some of these six studies adjusted\nfor additional variables: inhalation [68], time used filter\ncigarettes [53] and in two studies of ever (rather than\ncurrent) smokers, years since quitting [53,69]. The most\nlimited adjustments are in the Lung Health study [56]\nwhich only adjusted for baseline cigarettes/day, the\nHouston study [85], where results were only available\nadjusted for current/former smoking, and the German\nstudy [84], which appeared to present results for ever\nsmokers but only adjusted for total amount smoked,\nwithout taking quitting into account.\nEducation was adjusted for in four studies\nother variables adjusted for being year of interview [53]\nand randomization group [56]. It is of interest\nthat none of the studies adjusted for occupational expo-\nsure, which one might expect to vary by mentholated\ncigarette use (though partially controlled by adjustment\nfor race), and none adjusted for diet.\nGenerally, the papers did not present results that\nallowed the reader to determine the effect adjustments\nfor individual variables had on the relative risk esti-\nmates. Also, no paper discusses the appropriateness or\notherwise of adjusting for smoking characteristics,\nsuch as amount smoked or inhalation which may be\naffected by the choice of brand smoked. There are two\nconflicting issues here. One is wishing to guard\nagainst any potential bias arising if the sort of person\nwho chooses mentholated cigarettes is a more (or less)\n\"addicted\" smoker than the sort of person who\nchooses non-mentholated cigarettes. The other is that\nif, say, switching to mentholated cigarettes results in\nan increase in daily consumption with no change in\nrisk per cigarette, adjusting for amount smoked will\nlead to the impression that mentholation is risk free\nwhen it is not. Ideally, the comparison should be\nbetween switchers to mentholated cigarettes and non-\nswitchers, adjusted for smoking characteristics before\nthe switch, but such analyses seem never to have been\nattempted.\nStatistical methods used\nGenerally, the statistical methods used were standard,\nwith Cox proportion hazards modelling used for the two\nprospective studies [51,56], and unconditional logistic\nregression used for all the case-control studies, except\nthe German study [84] which used conditional logistic\nregression analysis. Four of the case-control studies\nditional logistic regression, so did not specifically take\nthe matching into account. This was no doubt to avoid\nloss of power, as some case-control pairs where one\nsubject had never smoked (or in some studies been a\nformer smoker) would not have contributed to a condi-\ntional analysis. However, the studies generally took into\naccount most of the matching variables as adjustment\nvariables in analysis. Exceptions were hospital and date\nof interview in the two American Health Foundation\nResults by histological type\nOnly one study, the first reported [68], gave results by\nhistological type. This is a limitation of the available\ndata.\nNOS study quality score\nOf the two cohort studies, the Kaiser Permanente Study\n[51] scored 9 out of a possible 9, while the Lung Health\nStudy [56] scored 8, the only weakness being the unre-\npresentativeness of the cohort, with mild or moderate\nairways obstruction. All of the six case-control studies\nscored between 5 and 7, the commonest weaknesses\nbeing lack of blind ascertainment of exposure in all six\nstudies, failure to demonstrate that lung cancer cases\nhad been excluded from the controls in four studies, use\nof hospital controls in three studies, and differing\nresponse rates (or lack of information on response rates)\nin three studies. Wells et al [81] do not specify a parti-\ncular cut-off value for \"good quality\" studies, and in the\nmeta-analyses following results are compared between\nthose three studies with scores of 7 to 9 and the other\nfive studies with scores of 5 to 6. Fuller details of the\nstudy quality scoring are available in additional file 2:\nStudy quality.\nTable 16 Source of data on mentholation status in the lung cancer studies\nStudy Data collected\nAmerican Health Foundation study\nSubjects were asked about lifetime history of brands of cigarettes smoked (up to 7 brands per person) and\ninformation was obtained on whether all brands reported were mentholated or not. If the brand name could\nnot be recalled, the mentholation status was recorded.\nKaiser Permanente study [51] Subjects were asked about the brand of the cigarette currently smoked and on whether the brand was\nmentholated or not. The authors did not report that they had obtained information on which brands were\nmentholated, or that they had checked one answer against the other.\nLos Angeles County study [69] Mentholated cigarette use was based on the question \"On average over your lifetime, out of every 100\ncigarettes you smoked, how many were menthol?\"\nSlone Epidemiology Center study\nSubjects were asked about the most recent brand and the brand used for the longest period of time to\ndetermine the brand name and whether it was mentholated or not. The consistency of the brand name and\nmenthol status was not checked. In some analyses, cigarettes smoked prior to 1956 were assumed not to be\nmentholated.\nSecond American Health\nFoundation study [83]\nDetails are not given in the methods, but the variable analyzed related to whether current smokers preferred\nmentholated cigarettes.\nGerman study [84] Subjects were asked about their smoking history including brand names, with exposure to mentholated\ncigarettes derived from the brand names blinded for case-control studies.\nLung Health study [56] At baseline subjects were asked \"Do you now smoke cigarettes?\" followed by \"What type of cigarettes are\nthey? Are they plain or menthol?\" Similar questions were asked at annual follow-ups but the answers were not\nused in the analyses related to risk of lung cancer.\nHouston study [85] Smokers were asked to report their use of mentholated cigarettes, with ever use the endpoint used for\nanalysis.\nMeta-analysis of results for use of mentholated cigarettes\nUse of mentholated cigarettes\nTable 17 summarizes available RRs and CIs for use of\nmentholated cigarettes from the eight studies by gender,\nrace and overall. As is evident, the definition of use varies\ning ever and never users of mentholated cigarettes, and\nthe current or usual brand smoked. The RRs are adjusted\nfor age, gender (where relevant), race (where relevant),\nsmoking habits and other variables. Where the source\nprovides multiple adjusted RRs, those adjusted for the\nmost variables are presented in Table 17. The only indivi-\ndual RRs in the table that are statistically significant at p\nmales observed in the Kaiser Permanente study [51], and\nthe decreased risks observed in the Second American\nTable 18 gives the results of various meta-analyses.\nNone show significant (p < 0.05) heterogeneity between\nestimates, and, although random-effects estimates are\nreferred to in the text below, fixed-effect and random-\neffects estimates are practically the same.\nBased on the overall result from each study, and pre-\nferring results for ever smokers to results for current\nsmokers where there is a choice (in the Houston study\nshows no excess lung cancer risk for mentholated over\nnon-mentholated cigarettes (see also Figure 2). This is\nalso true for estimates subdivided by study design, NOS\nstudy quality score, study size or year of publication, or\nwhen results from the first two hospital case-control\nstudies [53,68] were excluded to avoid possible double-\ncounting of some cases.

As\nshown in Table 5, there was no indication of heteroge-\nneity by age, the (gender-specific) RRs for the four age\ngroups being consistent with those for the combined\nage groups.\nOnly one study [83] provided estimates jointly by race\nand gender, but, as shown in Table 12, none of these\nwere statistically significant.\nRR estimates that were similarly adjusted for non-smok-\ning variables but were either adjusted or not adjusted\nfor smoking. In the Los Angeles County study [69],\nadjustment for smoking habits increased the overall RR\nEpidemiology Center study [53], adjustment increased it\nond American Health Foundation study [83], adjustment\ndiscussed earlier, the extent to which adjustment for\nsmoking habits should be carried out is open to ques-\ntion. However, these results do not suggest that the fail-\nure to find an increased risk from mentholated\ncigarettes depends crucially on smoking adjustment.\nFor the principal meta-analysis, for which the data are\nshown in Figure 2, there was no indication of publica-\ntion bias, as assessed by Egger's test[82] or by a funnel\nplot (Figure 3).\nMeta-analysis of results for long-term use of mentholated\ncigarettes\nTable 19 summarizes available RRs and CIs for long\nterm use of mentholated cigarettes from the four studies\nproviding relevant data. The definitions of long term use\nvary by study, two studies giving results for 15+ years\nuse, one for 20+ years use, and one for 32+ pack-years\nof use. As for Table 17, the RRs are always the most-\nadjusted available. None of the individual RRs shown in\nTable 19 are statistically significant.\nTable 20 gives the results of meta-analysis overall and\nby gender and race. None of the random-effects esti-\nmates suggest any effect of long term mentholation use\nestimates, four for the overall results and those by gen-\nder, and only two for the results by race. No significant\nheterogeneity was evident in any of the analyses.\nSome of these studies also report other results by\nextent of use of mentholated cigarettes. In the Los\nAngeles County Study [69], no excess risk was seen\ncomparing those with exclusive mentholated cigarette\nNor were significant effects of mentholation seen when\nand 54+ pack years, RRs based on limited data being\nmiology Center study [53], ever smokers with 50% or\nmore mentholated cigarette use had no excess risk com-\nalso presented estimates of risk for > 15 years use of\nno association was seen with lung cancer risk whether\ndifferent subsets of smokers were used or whether dif-\nferent assumptions were made concerning data on\nbrand history.\nCan mentholation explain the higher lung cancer risk in\nUS Black people?\npreference of Black people for mentholated cigarettes\nmight help to explain the higher lung cancer rates seen\nin Black males compared to White males. However, the\nepidemiological findings would appear to argue other-\nwise. For mentholation to be the major cause one would\nexpect to see a substantially higher risk of lung cancer\nin mentholated cigarette smokers, but this is not the\ncase. Table 21 presents approximate calculations sug-\ngesting that explaining the 36% increase in incidence\nand 31% increase in mortality reported in Black males\ncompared to White males [66] requires the relative risk\nof lung cancer associated with mentholation to be about\n1.7 or 1.8. In fact, as shown in Table 18, the relative risk\nfor mentholation estimated from the combined available\nevidence is 0.93, with an upper 95% confidence limit of\nuse (see Table 20) the estimate of 0.95 has an upper\n95% confidence limit of only 1.13. Though a small con-\ntribution of mentholation to the excess risk in US Black\npeople cannot be ruled out, a major contribution seems\ntotally implausible based on the available data. The fact\nthat Black females, compared to White females, are\nmuch more likely to use mentholated cigarettes but\nhave quite similar lung cancer mortality, strengthens\nthis view.\nDiscussion\nAs noted earlier, there has been increasing regulatory\ninterest in the possible contribution of additives to the\ncarcinogenicity of cigarettes, both in the United States\nand Europe. In principle, menthol is by far the easiest\nto study, as brand names clearly identify whether or\nnot the cigarette is mentholated, and smokers will be\nwell aware anyway whether the cigarettes they are\nsmoking are mentholated. Also mentholated cigarettes\nTable 17 Risk of lung cancer by use of mentholated cigarettesa (adjusted for age, gender, race, smoking habits and\nother variablesb)\nStudy Comparison Males Females White people Black people Overall total\nAmerican Health\nEver/never used M (in current\nsmokers)\nKaiser Permanente [51] Usual brand M or not (in current\nsmokers for 20+ years)\nLos Angeles [69] Ever/never used M (in ever\nsmokers)\nSlone Epidemiology\nEver/never used M (in ever\nsmokers)\nAmerican Health\nCurrently prefers/does not prefer M\n(in current smokers)\nGerman [84] Ever/never used M (in ever\nsmokers)\nLung Health [56] Current brand M or not (in current\nsmokers)\nHouston [85] Ever/never used M (in ever\nsmokers)\na Mentholated cigarettes abbreviated to M in the table.\nb All estimates are adjusted for age, gender and race except for those that are gender-specific or race-specific.

Coupled with evidence in the\nUnited States that Black males have markedly higher\nlung cancer rates than do White males (see Table 2),\ndespite Black people smoking less heavily and tending\nto start smoking later in life than do White people (see\nmentholation of cigarettes may increase the risk of lung\ncancer.\nThe main objective of this paper is to investigate this\npossibility by a direct epidemiological comparison of\nrisk in mentholated and non-mentholated cigarette smo-\nkers. However, it should be noted that various other\npieces of evidence argue against this possibility. First,\ndata from a number of studies (see e.g. [9,45]) provide\nno convincing evidence that mentholation increases\npuffing, inhalation or tobacco smoke uptake. Also, Black\nfemales have similar lung cancer rates (see Table 2) to\nWhite females, despite the preference for mentholated\ncigarettes in Black people being at least as great in\nfemales as in males (see Table 1). It should also be\nnoted that, as described in the Background section,\nthere are other differences in smoking characteristics\nbetween Black and White people, with Black people\nbeing more likely to be current smokers, less likely to\nquit, tending to choose higher tar cigarettes and having\nTable 18 Meta-analyses of risk of lung cancer by use of mentholated cigarettes\nNumber of\nEstimates\nRR (95% CI) Heterogeneity c2(df), p\nFixed-effect Random-effects\nIn ever smokers (or current smokers if not available)\nStudy design\nNOS study quality score\nStudy size\nYear of publication\nIn current smokers (or ever smokers if not available)\nIn ever smokers specifically\nIn current smokers specifically\nIn former smokers specifically\na Lung cancer cases in mentholated cigarette smokers.\nb Excluding first American Health Foundation Study and Slone Epidemiology Center study.\nhigher cotinine levels. Other differences between Black\nand White people may also be relevant, for example in\nbody mass index, access to health care and metabolism.\nAlthough mentholated cigarettes have assumed an\nimportant place in the United States cigarette market\nover the last 50 years, and the number of published epi-\ndemiological studies of smoking and lung cancer is\nextremely large, relatively few publications provide infor-\nmation comparing risk in smokers according to use of\nmentholated cigarettes.\nWhile only eight relevant studies were identified, and\ntwo of the papers reporting on this relationship [83,85]\ndid not have mentholation as a central interest and one\n[84] was published only as an abstract, the data available\nto study effects of mentholation seem quite good. The\nstudies are reasonably large, involving in total some\n1200 lung cancers in mentholated cigarette smokers and\nare of standard designs analysed by standard methods.\nCases are generally histopathologically confirmed, with\nselection of controls unlikely to cause relevant bias. All\nthe studies take age, gender, race and other aspects of\nsmoking into account in their analyses, with some\nadjustment for other potential confounding variables\nsuch as education and body mass index.\nNevertheless, the studies have limitations. These\ninclude failure to present results by histological type\n(except in one study [68]), failure to adjust for occupa-\ntion or diet, and failure to report results by length of\nuse of mentholated cigarettes in the later published stu-\nmentholated cigarettes for a long time. One would like\nto be able to compare subjects who smoked only\nmentholated or only non-mentholated cigarettes for 30\nyears or more.\nAnother issue is the extent and reliability of the data\non lifetime use of mentholated cigarettes. Some studies\nonly collected or analyzed information on brand cur-\nduring lifetime [53], and some studies collecting data on\nnames of brands smoked and whether the brand was\nmentholated [51,53] seemed not to cross-check this\ninformation. The reliability of statements on brands\nsmoked years ago is in any case questionable [89].\nAmerican Health\nFoundation 1\nKaiser Permanente\nLos Angeles\nSlone Epidemiology Center\nAmerican Health\nFoundation 2\nGerman\nLung Health\nHouston\nOverall\nLogarithmic scale for RR (95% CI) values\nFigure 2 Forest plot of study-specific estimates and 95% CIs for mentholated cigarette use.

RR is the assumed relative risk for mentholated compared to non-mentholated cigarette smoking.\nd Estimated by summing for each race, the product of rows (a) and (b) over columns (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5), and then dividing the total for Black people by the\ntotal for White people.\nThe analyses presented are typically adjusted for smok-\ning habits, such as daily cigarette consumption and dura-\ntion of smoking. This is an attempt to compare\nmentholated and non-mentholated cigarette smokers with\nan equivalent smoking history. None of the analyses have\nattempted to account for the possibility that switching\nfrom non-mentholated to mentholated cigarettes might be\nassociated with changes in cigarette consumption.\nThe combined data from the eight studies are not at all\nsuggestive of any effect of mentholation on lung cancer\nrisk. Meta-analysis of adjusted RRs for ever use give a\ndual estimates showing remarkably little heterogeneity,\nis again based on consistent individual estimates, varying\nin males or females separately, in Black or White people\nseparately or in estimates for ever smokers, current smo-\nkers or former smokers. Limited data on risk by age and\nby histological type of lung cancer also suggest no effect of\nmentholation. There is a question as to the validity of\nadjustment for aspects of smoking habits that might be\naffected by use of mentholated cigarettes, but the esti-\nmates that are adjusted only for non-smoking variables\ntend to be lower. Overall the data, taken as a whole, could\nhardly be more indicative of a lack of relationship.\nFor mentholation to explain the increased lung cancer risk\nin Black compared to White males of some 30-35% would\nrequire a relative risk of about 1.7 to 1.8. The excess risk,\ntherefore, cannot possibly be explained by the much greater\npreference of Black people for mentholated cigarettes.\nConclusion\nWhile there are some weaknesses in the studies present-\ning data, discussed in detail in the report, the evidence\ntaken as a whole is certainly consistent with the addition\nof menthol to tobacco having no effect on the lung car-\ncinogenicity of cigarettes. The much greater preference\nfor mentholated cigarettes in Black people in the United\nStates cannot possibly explain their higher lung cancer\nrisk, which in any case in evident only in men.\nAdditional material\nAdditional file 1: Methods for deriving RR estimates.
