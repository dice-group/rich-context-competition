The aim of the article is to understand the emergence of the Named Person\nin Scotland and to explain the significant distance between legislators and policy makers and those who have opposed the\nNamed Person initiative. We propose that the key to understanding these divergent views is predicated upon profoundly\ndifferent views of the family, the collapse of the ideal of family autonomy, and its replacement with what can be described as\n\"third way parenting.\" Here, the meaning of the \"Named Person\" as laid out in the Children and Young People (Scotland)\nAct 2014, and the opposing views that have been made against this act are explained. The \"Named Person\" provision in the\nlegislation, it is argued, has developed with the rise of micro-managerial politics, the construction of the \"at risk\" child and\nthe anxiety expressed about the early years of children, seen most clearly in the significance of early intervention policies.\nWithin this context, parenting has become problematized and increasingly understood as a skills activity requiring training,\nsupport, and surveillance.\n",

The Named Person is a state named professional\n\"guardian\" who will oversee the interests of every child in\nScotland from birth. Initially, this professional will be a\nhealth visitor and the Named Person baton will be passed\nupward as the child grows, onto primary and then high school\nheads or guidance teachers. This Named Person has grown\nout of the getting it right for every child (GIRFEC) approach,\nand it is hoped will improve services, help keep children\nsafe, and oversee the well-being of all children in Scotland.\nSignificant opposition against the Named Person has\ndeveloped in Scotland, seen most clearly with the No to\nNamed Person (NO2NP) campaign. Looking at those argu-\ning for and against this new initiative, it was noticeable how\nfar apart the two sides were, and indeed are. The anger at\nNO2NP public events is palpable, as indeed is the incompre-\nhension about how the Scottish government could introduce\nsomething like this. At a number of these events, the Scottish\nNational Party (SNP) government is even described as being\nfascistic, as if it is driven by some ideology that has resulted\nin this Named Person being forced upon us.\nThis article has developed out of the author's involvement\nwith the NO2NP campaign. As a form of participant action\nresearch, it was initiated by existing research looking at the\npotential problems of early intervention. This examination of\nearly intervention was itself developed out of prior research\nlooking at the political nature of antisocial behavior legisla-\ntion and the trend toward the regulation of public life. The\nauthor was involved in discussions at the Scottish Parliament\nbefore the act was passed examining the strengths and weak-\nnesses of the Named Person initiative. Subsequently, discus-\nsions were held with a variety of groups and individuals who\nwere opposed to the Named Person. Out of these discussions,\nthe NO2NP campaign was formed and the author helped to\norganize and chair a conference on this subject and also\nchaired numerous \"roadshows\" across Scotland: These pub-\nlic events, the work with parents and parents' groups, and\n1Abertay University, Dundee, Scotland\nCorresponding Author:\nStuart Waiton, Abertay University, Kydd Building, Bell Street, Dundee\nEmail: s.waiton@abertay.ac.uk\nThird Way Parenting and the Creation\nof the \"Named Person\" in Scotland: The\nEnd of Family Privacy and Autonomy?\nStuart Waiton1\n Keywords\nat risk, early intervention, GIRFEC, NO2NP, family\n2 SAGE Open\nsubsequent analysis of Scottish social policy documents\nregarding this matter, form the basis of this article.\nIt is worth noting at this point the nature of the opposition\nto the Named Person compared with those who were promot-\ning it, a difference that explains, in part, the gulf that existed\nbetween the two sides. The groups and individuals in the\nopposition camp were almost entirely made up of \"old\nschool\" types: Christians and Conservatives with a moral\ndefense of the family stood alongside socialists who opposed\nthe demonization of the family and the abandonment of\nstructural explanations and action by the state, with a variety\nof liberal and libertarian voices arguing for parental rights\nmaking up the triumvirate. This contrasted with the politi-\ncians, medical experts, and child care professionals who\nmake up the bulk of those promoting both GIRFEC and the\nNamed Person. These groups it is argued here represent,\nwhat we will call, the new class.\nThe objective of this article is to look at the Named Person\nand to try and explain what it is and why this state guardian\nhas been created. The nature of the Named Person legislation\nand the arguments against it will be discussed below but\nmore particularly there is an attempt here to understand the\nNamed Person as a reflection of the changing nature of the\nrelationship between the state and the family.\nThe State We Are in\nThis article attempts to follow Nigel Parton's concern about\nthe changing nature of state policies toward children and\nfamilies (Parton, 2006). Most particularly, it is concerned\nwith what appears to be a significant shift in terms of state\nexpectations about its active responsibility to create pre-\nscribed \"outcomes\" in children and to develop a framework\nof intervention around the broad category of \"well-being.\"\nSome of these trends can be understood with reference to\nAlvin Gouldner's description of the new class--a flawed\n\"universal\" class who stand above the soiled world of poli-\ntics or moral contestations and use \"scientific\" methods to\ndeveloped mechanism for regulating society at arm's length\nChristopher Lasch's work is also useful for assessing\nwhat he saw as a trend in social policy for professionals and\nexperts to colonize the socialization process of children\n(Lasch, 1977). This, he argued had a long history through\nthe 20th century, but was becoming more intense as society\nattempted to deal with what Habermas called a \"legitima-\ntion crisis\" (Habermas, 1976). For Lasch, the moral and\npolitical framework for state activities had increasingly\nbecome replaced by a process of law making. Law making\nin a sense became a replacement for politics and morals,\nsomething that Alan Findlayson argues became increas-\ningly significant under New Labour, at a time when politi-\ncians found it difficult to change society through political\nand moral leadership by engaging the \"energy of the peo-\nConsequently, there has been a shift in politics and a\ndevelopment of micro-management policies and initiatives\nsummed up perhaps most simply through the idea of \"the\nthis has been influenced with the emergence of the \"thera-\npeutic state\" (Nolan, 1998) and the elevated significance of\nthe emotional life of individuals, an emotional life that Frank\nFuredi believes is predicated upon a diminished view of the\nhuman participant and a universalizing understanding of\npeople (especially children) as being fundamentally vulner-\nable and consequently, in need of support (Furedi, 2004).\nThis sense of vulnerability is assisted by what Lasch\n(1979) described as a world of diminished expectations that\nhe saw developing out of the 1970s, a world with a decreas-\ning sense of human or social possibilities and as such a world\nthat became preoccupied by the mere need to survive. This\nwas a society, described by Furedi (1997), as one that was\nincreasingly dominated by a culture of fear--a culture within\nwhich safety became the new absolute--a prism through\nwhich an increasing number of activities, interactions, and\ninitiatives became subsumed and resulted in the growing\n(best) practice of risk management.\nWhereas past approaches to life and society by the \"old\nschool\" types were grounded in a belief in the potential to\ntransform society, or transform individuals or, for conserva-\ntives, to uphold standards from the past. The new class, espe-\ncially in its increasingly therapeutic guise, is uninterested in\ntraditions or with notions of transformation and has come\ninstead to be preoccupied with the need to micro-manage\nbehavior. Their forensic approach to family life consequently\nbecomes enamored with neuroscientific discussions about the\nbrain as they abandon any attempt to understand the mind.1\nManaging the At-Risk Family\nCritical concerns about social policies targeted at families\nover recent years have addressed a number of issues regard-\ning the \"colonization\" of the family, the bureaucratization of\nchildren's services and the emerging \"risk management\"\napproach to parenting. Nigel Parton (2006), in his book about\nSafeguarding Children (subtitled, Early Intervention and\nSurveillance in a Late Modern Society), has described \"the\nemergence of the `preventive state'\" (p. 6). This is a state that\nhas come to be organized around the protection of the \"at\nrisk\" child.2\nThis growing focus upon the \"at risk\" child has been assisted\nby the \"rapidly-growing number of features of modern life,\"\nsuch as food, sunshine, and technology, which are now deemed\nsafety concerns are recognized to be widespread among the\npublic itself and concerns about the rise of \"cotton wool kids\"\nhas been aired (Waiton, 2001). More abstractly, questions have\nbeen raised about not only the proliferation of modern day\n\"risks\" but also more generally about the emergence of an\nexaggerated \"risk consciousness\" that influences parental\nof the outcomes of the growth of perceived \"risks,\" the critics\nargue, is that the idea of the \"child at risk\" has expanded from\na term used to relate to a very specific group of children to\nbecome a category that is more generally \"applied to all chil-\nIn addition, the growing tendency to understand areas of\nlife through the prism of risks has led to a form of risk man-\nagement becoming a political objective with set targets and\noutcomes being established within children's services. Once\nestablished, as Lynne Wrennall argues, the inability to reach\nthese outcomes themselves becomes understood as a risk.\nShe notes, for example, that when discussing the \"Trojan\nHorse\" of child protection, \"The term `Child at risk' used to\nmean, at risk of abuse or neglect, but it has now been rede-\nfined to mean, a child at risk of not meeting the government's\nStephen Webb, the growing anxiety about child safety in\nsociety and within policy circles, has taken on an internal\ngovernmental dynamic, and risk management becomes\nincreasingly proceduralized (Webb, 2006).\nThrough the prism of \"risk,\" objectives, ideas, and ser-\nvices targeted at children and families have increasingly\ndeveloped around the need for \"prevention.\" For Nigel\nParton (2006), the key change in children's services in\nEngland and Wales is that prevention, rather than being a\nfringe activity has been, recast and \"placed at the centre of\npublic policy\" (p. 6). This shift emerged with the wider trend\ntoward a more managerial, \"less political\" approach to social\npolicy--an evidence-based approach that \"came to the fore\nin the UK with the advent of the New Labour government,\nwho saw it as a pragmatic `third way' approach that tran-\nscended ideologies of Left and Right\" (Edwards, Gillies, &\nHorsley, 2016, p. 1) This idea that \"every problem in society\nhas an evidence-based solution\" is arguably part of a \"mod-\nernising, new managerialist approach to governance in which\nsocial values and moral issues are reduced to technical ratio-\nThe rise of managerialism and bureaucratic mechanisms\nfor relating to children and families has, in the last few\ndecades, developed more specifically with the growing focus\nupon the management of risk or risks. This is arguably part of\nthe wider \"survivalist\" instinct, discussed by Lasch, that has\nresulted in a society weighed down with concerns about pre-\nventing harm rather than doing (political or moral) good. As\nParton notes, for example, increasing surveillance, potential\nrestrictions on liberty and mass data collection are all part of\na new \"protectionist\" approach that is predicated upon \"inter-\nvening at a much earlier stage' rather than a crisis manage-\nment approach\" (Parton, 2006, p. 6). Indeed, to manage risk\nand to prevent problems inevitably results in the desire for\nearly intervention that itself necessitates intervention based\non what would previously have been seen as lesser issues or\nproblems: If we are going to \"intervene early,\" this means\nthat we intervene before a major problem exists.\nAvoiding risks and being risk conscious, Stephanie J.\nKnaak notes in her study of breastfeeding, is part and parcel\nof what \"good mothering\" has come to mean to both profes-\nsionals and mothers alike. It is the purview of a medical-sci-\nentific discourse, she argues, in which authority is gained\nthrough the ability to \"define and monitor `risk'in parenting\"\nThrough the prism of risk and the inevitable trend toward\nearly intervention within children's services, an \"explicit\nlinking\" has developed of the \"minutiae of everyday parent-\ning practices\" with what is understood to be the \"good of\nsociety as a whole\"--something that necessitates further a\nneed for more \"government policy\" (Edwards & Gillies,\nFor Ellie Lee, the construction of the child \"at risk\" has\nresulted in parents being equally constructed as \"risk man-\nagers.\" She notes, \"Attention has been drawn to the distinc-\ntiveness of a culture that routinely represents `parenting' as\nthe single most important cause of impaired life chances,\noutstripping any other factor\" (Lee et al., 2010, p. 5). Once\nparents are established as risk managers their behavior\nbecomes a potential focus for professional concern and\nmanagement. As a result, \"parenting\" becomes something\nspecific, something more related to issues associated solely\nwith the prevention of harm and with a professional under-\nstanding of risk avoidance. Indeed parenting itself is recon-\nceptualized as a, and possibly the most important, risk\nfactor.\nThe implications of these developments for The Family,\nas an institution in its own right are significant, and we have\nseen, over the last decade, clear indications that when it\ncomes to parenting, the hope and expectation is that families\nwill open themselves up to the support (and surveillance)\nthey are understood to need from professionals.\nWhen the education secretary Alan Johnson launched\nEvery Parent Matters (Department for Education and\nSkills, 2007), for example, the, \"vital role of parents in\nimproving their child's life chances,\" was emphasized,\nbefore Johnson explained that, however, \"Traditionally,\nparenting has been a `no-go'area for governments. But now\nmore than ever government needs to be supportive of par-\nents who are themselves increasingly seeking help\"\n(\"Fathers Told to `Dig In' to Bond,\" 2007). Most recently,\naddressing the problem of social mobility and the claim that\n\"4 out of ten children are missing out on good parenting\"\n(Social Mobility & Child Poverty Commission, 2014, p.\n40), the social mobility tsar, \"Alan Milburn said it should\nbe `the norm' for families to be given advice on issues such\nas reading to their children, imposing discipline and restrict-\ning TV viewing to tackle the scourge of `bad parenting'\"\n(\"Make Parenting Lessons the Norm,\" 2014). Noticeably, a\n2011 paper by the Social Mobility and Child Poverty\nCommission, promoting the need to normalize parenting\nclasses, was titled, \"Opening Doors, Breaking Barriers\"\n4 SAGE Open\nThe anxiety about parenting, Macvarish argues, has been\naccelerated through the expanding category of \"abuse\" and\n\"neglect.\" She believes that \"behaviour which would once\nhave been regarded as within the range of family experiences,\nsuch as children becoming overweight or parents getting\nangry and using moderate chastisement,\" is now categorized\nwith reference to risk, abuse, or neglect categories (Macvarish,\nThe problematization of parental practices has been\nassisted, Furedi believes, with the emergence of a thera-\npeutic culture and the understanding that there is an emo-\ntional deficit in society that is more central to individual\nand social problems (Furedi, 2004). Emotional tensions\nhave consequently been recast as issues of abuse leading to\ncalls for a \"Cinderella Law\" to punish parents who are\nemotionally cruel to their children. Sylvia Hewlett and\nCornel West believe that the modern anxiety surrounding\nemotional abuse of children developed first in the United\nStates with the discovery (and construction) of the idea of\n\"toxic parenting,\" an idea promoted by psychologist John\nBradshaw that led him to argue that 96% of families in the\nUnited States were dysfunctional (Hewlett & West, 1998,\nThis focus on the emotional individual within British\nfamilies can be understood, in part, in relation to the \"third\nway\" focus on the minutiae of everyday parenting that\nneglected structural (political) factors and defined social\nexclusion as a \"purely cultural phenomenon, to be addressed\nby changing the norms of parenting in poor families\" (Clarke,\nWith the declining significance of political ideologies, the\ntrend was for social policy to be increasingly focused upon\nthe individual and more particularly, upon the emotionally\nconstituted individual. One of the outcomes in the United\nKingdom was that there was a growing focus upon \"the\nmanipulation of the child's immediate environment,\" and\nwith the hugely expensive development of the Sure Start pro-\ngrams in England, there was now a major government initia-\ntive that targeted a section of the population--the\nunder-fours--\"whose needs had previously been seen as\nalmost entirely the private responsibility of their parents\"\nIn the United Kingdom, as we moved into the new millen-\nnium, Tony Blair explained that if he had an extra billion\npounds to spend, he would spend it on the under-fives\n(Parton, 2006). As Featherstone notes, this emphasis on the\nunder-fives was part of \"New Labour's desire to redraw the\nwelfare state [through] an emphasis on investing in children\"\n(Featherstone, 2009, p. 2). As we have seen, this refocusing\nupon children came with a growing sense of risk in society\nand with a professional belief in the need to manage these\nrisks--risks that related to the minutiae of everyday life and\nincreasingly included a therapeutic understanding of emo-\ntional dangers faced by children--dangers that needed to be\nprevented through early intervention.\nThe Children and Young People\nThe Named Person is about the safety and well-being of chil-\ndren and about creating a \"joined up\" service where there is\none single person who can be approached by a parent regard-\ning services. It is about better service delivery and part of this\nservice is to ensure that the general well-being of the child is\nmaintained and that the child is safe. This service will be\nassisted by better data sharing between professionals. The\nNamed Person, being a professional who is in touch with the\nchild on a daily basis (such as a teacher) will also play a more\nproactive role in watching out for the child's well-being and\nwill be trained to understand what \"well-being\" means helped\nby the SHANARRI indicators developed through GIRFEC.\nThese well-being indicators relate to being Safe, Healthy,\nAchieving, Nurtured, Active, Respected, Responsible, and\nIncluded, and it will be a statutory responsibility for the\nNamed Person to oversee the child's well-being\nIt is explained in the Policy Memorandum to the Bill that\nChildren and young people from birth up to 18 (or beyond if\nthey are still at school) have a Named Person and that relevant\npublic bodies cooperate with the Named Person by sharing\nrelevant information with the Named Person where there is a\nrisk of the wellbeing of a child or young person being impaired.\nThe Named Person, will be constantly updated, and have access\nto data about all services or difficulties that a child has as they\ngrow, where there are \"concerns\" about the \"well-being\" of a\nchild. Indeed it will be a statutory \"duty\" for services (doctors,\npolice, social work, welfare agencies, etc.) to pass on this infor-\nmation (Scottish Parliament, 2014b, p. 17). Subsequently, it is\nhoped that the Named Person will be \"in a position to intervene\nearly to prevent difficulties escalating\" (p. 16).\nThis sharing of data, based on \"concerns about well-\nbeing,\" is a significant change from the much more specific\nand previously required benchmark for sharing data based on\nthere being evidence of \"significant risk of harm\" to a child.\nThe Policy Memorandum explained that the role of the\nNamed Person is,\nbased on the idea that information on less critical concerns about a\nchild's wellbeing must be shared if a full picture of their wellbeing\nis to be put together and if action is to be taken to prevent these\nconcerns developing into more serious issues. (p. 18)\nThe Named Person is embedded in the GIRFEC approach\nthat was developed out of a review of the Children's Hearing\nSystem in 2004. GIRFEC's aim is to support children and\nfamilies by streamlining provision and getting all agencies\nthat have contact with children to work together to provide\nbetter services and also to safeguard children, with, in part,\nan understanding of the importance of early intervention as a\nremedy for preventing problems in the future (Scottish\nGovernment, 2008). Consequently, it is believed that the\nneeds of children in Scotland will be better met and a culture\nof shared responsibility will develop among staff in health\nand education as well as social work.\nDespite the real differences between family policies in\nEngland and Scotland (Donoghue, 2011), in many respects\nGIRFEC replicates the Every Child Matters (ECM) approach\ndeveloped in England in 2003. Both emphasize the impor-\ntance of data sharing between agencies and the need to move\nfrom a crisis management approach to one based on the early\nyears framework that prioritizes the issue of safeguarding\nchildren through early intervention (HMSO, 2003).\nSir Harry Burns, the Chief Medical Officer in Scotland\nuntil 2014, has been one of the most influential advocates of\nearly intervention through his promotion of the problem of\n\"health inequalities\" (rather than simply inequalities). In the\nintroduction to Supporting Young People's Health and\nWellbeing: A Summary of Scottish Government Policy (2013)\nhe sums up the approach:\nIf we are to have the greatest chance of influencing the\ndeterminants of health and wellbeing, we should focus efforts on\nactions to improve the quality of care for children and families.\nWe should start by making efforts to ensure a safe and healthy\npregnancy, a nurturing childhood and support families to bring\nup their children in a safe, healthy, supportive and stimulating\nenvironment. Efforts to enrich early life represent our best hope\nof breaking the intergenerational cycle of disadvantage.3\nThe Risk Management of Well-Being\nA more detailed understanding of the GIRFEC framework\nthat underpins the named person can be gained by looking at\nprevious policy documents and publications explaining the\nnature of \"good practice\"--especially good practice in terms\nof the increasingly central idea of \"well-being.\"\nThe measurement and monitoring of well-being has been\ndeveloped with the help of risk indicators, outcome signifi-\ners, and various ways of managing information about chil-\ndren. The National Risk Framework, for example, is a\nGIRFEC document, used to explain how to understand and\nmanage risks. It aims to \"support and assist practitioners at\nall levels, in every agency, to be able to approach the task of\nrisk identification, assessment, analysis and management\nwith more confidence and competence.\"4 It is now also part\nand parcel of the framework around which the Named Person\nwill operate. There are 221 \"risk indicators\" in this risk\nframework that are intended to help calculate a child's well-\nbeing and a parents' inadequacy in this regard.5 These are\nassisted by the Wellbeing Wheel, the My World Triangle,\nand a Resilience Matrix. The GIRFEC assessment frame-\nwork also includes an explanation of collecting information\nby using risk indicator forms; how to be a risk analyst to\nunderstand the child's world and how to be a risk manager\n(see Figure 1).\nExplaining the underlying early intervention ethos behind\nthe framework, the report states that\nFigure 1. GIRFEC national practice model.9\n6 SAGE Open\nNamed Persons, Lead Professionals and others then need to\nproject the future probability or likelihood of harm and to\ndetermine if this harm is significant in nature or not. Projection\nof probable risk of harm significantly also means that there is a\npotential for error in terms of what we think may occur. This is\nno small task indeed [emphasis added].6\nThere is a clear shift, in policy documents in Scotland, away\nfrom the use of the term welfare toward the idea of \"well-\nbeing\" as the basis of professional practice regarding chil-\ndren. Looking at the consultation document regarding the\nChildren and Young People Bill, written in 2010, for exam-\nple, it states that\nWe are shifting away from a view of a child's and young person's\n\"welfare\" that treats their health, education and safety in\nisolation towards a more rounded view of their \"wellbeing,\"\nwhere services are sensitive to all the factors that affect how\nwell children and young people grow and develop.7\nThere is an attempt to standardize the idea of well-being\nand to develop forms of assessment by creating lists of fac-\ntors that indicate well-being concerns. The Scottish govern-\nment has created a form with 308 well-being indicators or\nsignifiers (as they are called). Each SHANARRI category\nhas its own list--relating to being Safe, Healthy, Achieving,\nNurtured, Active, Respected, Responsible, and Included.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, for such a long list, some of these\nsignifiers are contradictory, many are subjective, and some\nare extremely personal. For example, although the child is\nmeant to be safe, she is also to be encouraged to be curious\nand explore her environment; another signifier asks whether\nthe child smiles and laughs a lot, another wants to know\nwhether the child is unduly anxious about the physical\nchanges taking place during puberty. A number of the signi-\nfiers are reasonable questions regarding what would histori-\ncally have been understood as neglect or maltreatment. Many\nmore, such as the three listed, could indicate something or\nnothing about a child. A significant number of these well-\nbeing signifiers also relate directly to issues of parenting--\ndoes the child have a good relationship with family, is she\nactively involved in her family, are they treated with respect\nand dignity at all times, is their privacy respected, do they\nreceive regular praise and encouragement? Noticeably, many\nof the signifiers are concerned with the emotional well-being\nof the child and about how the child feels whereas others\nseem excessively prescriptive, asking, for example, whether\nthe child is developing aptitudes in one or more cultural\nactivities and one or more sporting activities.8\nOpposition and Analysis\nThe Children and Young People (Scotland) Act was not sim-\nply about the Named Person, it covered a large array of wel-\nfare-related provisions, the vast majority of which were\nsupported by Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs)\nwithin the Scottish Parliament. Some concerns were raised\nabout the Named Person aspect of the bill, particularly by\nConservative MSPs who eventually abstained. All other\nthe Named Person had also developed outside of party poli-\ntics, among Christian groups, legal bodies, and a variety of\nindividuals and organizations representing parents. The basis\nof this opposition is what we will now turn to.\nCentral to the varying forms of opposition to the Named\nPerson was a concern about the family being undermined or\nignored by the Scottish government both during the forma-\ntion of the bill and in its content. Parental rights, family\nrights, and issues of a loss of privacy were core concerns.\nBelow, we look at some of these key areas of concern and use\nthem as a basis to look further at the framework upon which\nthe Named Person has been established.\nFamily Valued?\nA variety of parent groups, legal bodies, and individuals\nopposed the Named Person initiative. A number of these\ngroups joined the NO2NP campaign. One of these, the\nScottish Parent Teacher Council's (SPTC), as part of the con-\nsultation process, submitted a paper to the Education and\nCulture Committee of the Scottish Parliament. A concern\nthey raised about the bill was that despite government sug-\ngestions that the Named Person was about helping parents, in\ntheir experience, few parents had actually been consulted\nabout the new initiative. Rather, through the government's\ndetailed consultation with various children's charities (who\nwork in the main with \"vulnerable children\") the almost pre-\nset consultation framework related to children who were\nunderstood to be \"at risk.\"10\nConcerns about parents' rights have also been raised with\nregard to mass school surveys that have been carried out\nacross Scotland with both 9- to 13-year-olds and with older\nchildren. As part of the GIRFEC framework, school surveys\nattempting to analyze the wide array of possible issues\nregarding children's well-being have been carried out in\nScotland, resulting in complaints from some parents.11 These\nsurveys have been carried out on the basis of the \"assumed\nconsent\" of parents (rather than actual active consent) and\nhave included intimate questions about family life and the\nsex life of children as young as 9 years old. For example, a\nmother from Milnathort, told the Fife Herald, \"My 12-year-\nold niece was quite upset when she was asked if she'd ever\nhad anal sex. She told me she and her friends stopped doing\nthe questionnaire then\" (\"Parents Shocked by New School\nSurvey,\" 2013). Other questions asked related to, \"legal and\nillegal drug and alcohol use, domestic disturbances, parental\napproaches to discipline, weight problems, theft and weapon-\ncarrying\" (\"A Question of Striking Right Balance in\nExamining these surveys, Kenneth Roy of the Scottish\nReview noted that \"assumed consent,\" when consent is pre-\nsumed if you do not opt out of a survey, is seen as an unac-\nceptable practice for surveying children by both the European\nData Protection Directive and the Economic and Social\nResearch Council. Despite this, the Scottish government,\nRoy notes, has launched the new \"ChildrenCount\" survey,\nwhich he believes will lead to a \"massive national database\nbacking up the present administration's intentions to have a\n`Named Person' for every child in Scotland.\"12\nOn the fundamental question of the Named Person under-\nmining the family, the Faculty of Advocates argue that the\nbill, \"dilutes the legal role of parents whether or not there is\nany difficulty in the way that parents are fulfilling their statu-\ntory responsibilities.\" The SPTC likewise argued that the\nNamed Person framework failed to recognize the signifi-\ncance of the relationship between the parent and child, or to\nrecognize that there was something special about this\nrelationship.\nThe Christian Institute which is central to the NO2NP\ncampaign has unsuccessfully launched a legal challenge\nagainst the Named Person, with the basis of the challenge\nbeing focused on the lawfulness of the universal nature of the\nNamed Person and the nature and extent of the powers of the\nNamed Person. Specifically, it questions whether this initia-\ntive cuts across the rights and responsibilities of parents,\nwhich relates to Article 8 of the European Court of Human\nRights (ECHR). More generally, a question is raised here\nabout the principle of subsidiarity, which is one of the funda-\nmental underlying principles of the ECHR: This principle\n(developed most fully after the Second World War and with\nreference to Fascism and Communism) challenges the state's\npresumed place as the only body worthy of value and loyalty\nin society, thus situating the family as a \"society in its own\nright\" with functions that should not be interfered with.\nInterference in family life is protected against in law and\nsupported only when there is a \"pressing social need\" to do\nso, related to exceptional cases of the \"prevention of signifi-\ncant harm to the child.\" Article 8 also ensures that parents\nhave the \"possibility and right of effective participation in\nany official decision making process concerning the care and\nprotection of their child.\"13\nMaggie Mellon the vice chair of the BritishAssociation of\nSocial Workers and a critic of the Named Person scheme\nbelieves that families are being ignored by the Scottish gov-\nernment. Examining the 84-page document that accompa-\nnied the act, she notes that there was only one mention of\n\"family\" in the entire document and that was in relation to a\ncare placement for a looked after child. There is no mention\nOver time, an increasing number of documents have been\nwritten to explain in more detail what the Named Person's role\nwill be in practice. Rather than quell concerns about the family\nbeing undermined however, the more detail that is given, the\nmore concerns have been inflamed. Take, for example, The\nEasy Read Guide to Getting It Right for Every Child.15 This\nguide for parents attempts to give more easily accessible infor-\nmation about the Named Person and gives a list of suggestions\nor instructions regarding each of the SHANARRI indicators.\nThe examples include the following:\nYour child is kept away from dangerous things such as\nfire and traffic (Safe).\nYour child eats healthy food, gets enough exercise, and is\nhappy (Healthy).\nYour child wants to work hard, feels confident, and gets\npraise (Achieving).\nYour child knows they are loved and have daily routines\n(Nurtured).\nYour child plays at home, and outdoors and does fun\nthings with the family (Active).\nYour child is treated as an individual, listened to, can keep\nthings private, and gets a say in things such as how their\nroom is decorated and what to watch on TV (Respected).\nYour child knows about right and wrong and you trust\nyour child to do the right thing (Responsible).\nYour child can be part of a group such as Scouts, Brownies,\nor a football group if they want (Included).\nAt the end of each section it states, \"People who work\nwith your child will check your child is safe\" (or Health,\nAchieving, Respected, and so on).\nAnother new initiative in schools is the Hopscotch Theatre\ngroup's production of a story about Ms. GIRFEC and Mr.\nSHANARRI, which includes two songs--the SHANARRI\nsong and the Rights song. Almost 30,000 primary school\nchildren are currently being taught these songs that (in the-\nory) teach the children, through play, stories, and song, about\nGIRFEC, the Named Person, and about their rights.16 As\nwell as causing consternation about the state indoctrinating\nchildren by getting them to sing songs with lines that include\nthings such as \"We can measure pride and pleasure,\" con-\ncerns have already been raised at roadshows about children\ncoming home and telling their parents that they do not have\nto go to bed, or that they do not have to do French at school,\nbecause they have got rights.\nFinally, it is worth noting that much of the criticism about\nthe Named Person has been directed at the idea of teachers as\nNamed Persons. However, a point often raised by those both\nin favor or opposed to the Named Person is that for most\nchildren at school it will be meaningless, in that teachers will\nnot be interested in minor issues and will only get involved,\nas a Named Person, in more serious cases. To some extent\nthis may be the practical reality, although it also goes against\nthe very idea of the Named Person as someone who is over-\nseeing the well-being of the whole child in all aspects of their\nlife and development. But at least in terms of actual assess-\nments, judgments, and interventions, there may be a reality\nto this point, especially as no additional resources are being\nmade available to schools.\n8 SAGE Open\nHowever, when it comes to health visitors as Named\nPersons, every single child will have a Named Person directly\nassessing them, and specifically assessing their well-being\nneeds as discussed in the Universal Health Visiting Pathway\nin Scotland Pre-Birth to Pre-School document (Scottish\nthe general health of a child, will now have a duty to visit a\nparent eight times in the first year of the child's life and\nensure they support and safeguard the well-being of the\nchild. Health plan indicators will also be used. These have\nbeen \"redefined\" to include an \"emphasis on wider family\nhealth\" (p. 5) There will be an expectation that the health\nvisitor will take a proactive \"health creating\" approach that\nshould begin with two pre-birth visits. On average, these ini-\ntial visits, the visits in the first year and subsequent visits\nshould take between 45 and 60 min and will include breast-\nfeeding benefit awareness, the need to carry out a routine\nenquiry for gender-based violence (which relates specifically\nto violence against the woman and child and will be assisted\nby the Domestic Abuse Risk Assessment Checklist where\nabuse is disclosed), and routine enquiries about family\nfinances/money worries. Core issues to be discussed pre-\nbirth will also include preparing the mother and father for\nparenthood, promoting attuned, sensitive parenting, raising\nawareness about the value of talking, stroking, singing pre-\nbirth and the benefits of brain development, and raise aware-\nness about second hand smoke.\nThe GIRFEC practice model and the National Risk\nAssessment tool are highlighted throughout this report as the\nNational assessment tools to be used, these tools, discussed\nabove include various forms and data monitoring forms\nrelated to the 308 SHANARRI well-being signifiers and the\n221 risk indicators. Essentially, the health visitor is no longer\njust a health visitor but a Named Person and a monitor of\nwell-being, who, like the Named Person in general must,\nensure that \"any risk or potential risk to child or parent/carer\nhealth and wellbeing is identified /addressed early\" (p. 10).\nThe health visitor as Named Person, following in the trajec-\ntory already developed under GIRFEC, will be proactive in\ntheir surveillance of well-being within a family home.\nAssessing, judging, and supporting far wider areas of a\nparent and child's life and relationship will be universally\ncarried out now with the help of the broad well-being indica-\ntors and in part through the framework of assessing these\nrelationships through the framework of risk and the potential\nneed for early intervention. Unlike in education, where there\nare no additional resources for the Named Person, there is to\nbe a significant increase in the funding for health visitors\nwith a planned additional 500 new health visitor posts being\ncreated in Scotland.\nPrivacy?\nMajor concerns were also raised about the sharing of data with\nand by the Named Person. Having more integrated services,\nbetter partnerships, and collaboration is a key element of\nGIRFEC. Better data collection and the use of improving digi-\ntal technology, it is hoped, will facilitate this process--a pro-\ncess that is central to the Named Person.\nPart of the Named Person initiative means that all profes-\nsionals coming into contact with children will be taught\nabout the SHANARRI well-being indicators. If they have\nconcerns that any aspect of a child's well-being is, or is at\nrisk of being, unmet, they have a duty to share this informa-\ntion with the Named Person. The Scottish government argues\nthat information will not be shared without the child's or the\nparent's permission and argue that data protection laws are\nnot being breached. The Law Society of Scotland however,\nraised questions about confidentiality, specifically wanting\nto know whether this sharing of information between profes-\nsionals could undermine the trust that young people have\nwhen disclosing information to adults.18\nConcerns about the Named Person have also been\nexpressed by parents. This is something that may increase as\nparents experience the impact of this initiative.19 Alison\nPreuss, the organizer of the home-schooling group\nSchoolhouse, has, for example, received a number of com-\nplaints from parents about \"Named Persons . . . trawling and\nsharing children's and parents' health records.\"20 Elsewhere\nconcerns have been raised about who the Named Person is,\ntheir right to receive copies of children's confidential medi-\ncal records, and the threatening letters parents have received\nwarning them that their Named Person will be informed if\nthey miss medical appointments.21\nThe practicalities of data sharing are still unclear and\noften only come to light through newspaper articles and let-\nters sent to the press about experiences parents have had.22\nLesley Scott of Tymes Trust, a charity for young Myalgic\nEncephalomyelitis (ME) sufferers, who is part of the NO2NP\ncampaign argues that there is a fundamental problem with the\ngovernment's argument that data will only be shared if the par-\nent and/or child agree to this--and that is the question of non-\ncompliant. Are children, in particular, really in a position to\nsay \"No\" to professionals who want to share information\nabout them? From her experience of working with parents,\nnon-compliance, or refusing to accept professional judgment,\nLesley argues, \"is the fastest way to get social workers inves-\ntigating you as a problem parent.\" Lesley Scott's argument is\nbacked up by Jane Colby the director of Tymes Trust. In a\npaper for Argument and Critique, Colby noted that many par-\nents end up being investigated by social services because of\nsuspicions about their child's illness especially when a parent\nis seen as non-compliant, there have been 141 such investiga-\ntion across the United Kingdom concerning \"abuse or neglect,\"\nnot one has resulted in action by the authorities. She notes,\nWe assert that for 100% of these families to be innocent,\nsomething is gravely wrong with the methods through which\nchildren with ME are selected to be the subject of Child Protection\ninvestigations and with the conduct of these investigations.23\nLookingatthe\"riskindicators\"intheNationalFramework\nof Risk in Scotland document (the GIRFEC risk indicators\nthat will be used by the Named Person)--being a non-com-\npliant parent can be associated with at least four \"risk\" signi-\nfiers: parental resistance/limited engagement, refuses\nworkers access to child, parents masking the reality of the\nsituation, and no shared understanding of concerns.24 Parents\ndo not have to comply when a professional wants to share\ninformation about them or their child, but if they do not they\ncould be labeled as non-compliant--a risk factor to their\nchild's well-being. As well as this, the Named Person or\nother professionals could share information without the\nchild's or parent's consent if they believe that by asking for\nconsent the child will be put at risk. This again is something\nthat Lesley Scott believes is highly subjective, especially\nwhen the extremely broad category of \"well-being concern\"\nis the basis upon which a Named Person is meant to act.\nData sharing is important for health visitors in their role as\nNamed Persons, and the confidentiality of client's medical\n(and other) records is changing. The Universal Health report\nstates that\nAfter following the due process in the Act including seeking the\nviews of the child and normally [emphasis added] the parent,\nsharing of information to promote, support or safeguard a child's\nwellbeing with or by a Named Person's service will be a duty\neven where there is a duty of confidentiality hence consent to\nshare relevant and proportionate information in this context will\nnot be required and if sought and refused could potentially\ndamage the HV/parental relationship.25\nThe duty of confidentiality here appears to be trumped by the\nduty to share information. Indeed, one of the reasons you may\nshare information without getting consent is if you think that\ntelling your client that you wish to share this information could\n\"potentially damage\" your relationship with that client.26\nFinally regarding concerns about data sharing and \"trawl-\ning\" for information: At Roadshows there has been a lot of\nskepticism from parents about professionals informing them\nwhen they share data. A number of parents who have\ndemanded to see the information held about them and their\nchild (via SubjectAccess Requests) have discovered a signifi-\ncant amount of data sharing that they were unaware of.\nParents have also raised concerns about \"data trawling\" in\nschools. This relates to the numerous school surveys that have\nbeen carried out across Scotland where children have been\nasked detailed questions about their lives and their relation-\nships, including the nature of their relationships with parents.\nQuestions have also been raised about teachers themselves\ntrawling for information and using Circle Time to quiz chil-\ndren about things they find embarrassing or worrying.\nDiscussion: Third Way Parenting\nCritics have noted the problematization and professionaliza-\ntion of parenting that is taking place across the United\nKingdom, and it is difficult to dispute the fact that the Named\nPerson, as a universal service for all children in Scotland, is\nfurthering this process--of both introducing professional\npeople and practices into the realm of parenting, perhaps\nespecially through the role of the health visitor--and through\nthis, elevating more areas of life into problems, or risks. The\nvery idea of early intervention is predicated upon intervening\nin a child's life before problems get out of hand; and through\nthe well-being indicators, this necessarily means that more\nminor issues will need to be taken seriously.\nWe mentioned Christopher Lasch's idea of survivalism at\nthe start of this article. This safety-based approach to life is\none that Nigel Parton has discussed at length with regard to\nthe safeguarding of children. With the Named Person's focus\non early intervention pre-birth and throughout a child's life,\nthis prevention-oriented approach takes the practice of \"safe-\nguarding\" to a new level and pushes risk management to the\nheart of parenting and professional practices.\nMany of the trends discussed by critics of parenting poli-\ncies, early intervention, and risk management approaches to\nfamilies, are evident in the Named Person. Indeed in many\nrespects, the Named Person is the \"high point\" of this\napproach to families. Here, there is a high expectation that\nsupport will be needed by parents and provided by profes-\nsionals, where needs and risks are interchangeable and per-\nhaps most importantly, where the category of well-being\nreplaces that of welfare, thus incorporating the anxiety about\nthe (universal) \"vulnerable child\" with an ever increasing\nconcern about the minutiae of everyday life.\nIn the consultation document discussing the Children and\nYoung People Bill, it is noted that the duty of government is\nto prioritize the safety and well-being of children. Scotland's\nservices can lead the way if we work together, we are told.\nThe key is to use the SHANARRI indicators, focus on the\nearly years, and to have a commitment to early intervention.\nThis was not simply an objective of those departments work-\ning with children however, rather, \"These aspirations are the\nfoundations not just for this Children and Young People Bill,\nbut for our approach to government [emphasis added].\"27\nCentral to this new form of government is the idea of gov-\nerning well-being and of supporting people, especially chil-\ndren. This is a development that fully took hold under New\nLabour, as Featherstone (2009) noted, with the redrawing of\nthe welfare state through an emphasis on children.28 Welfare,\nas the consultation document to the new Children Act\nexplained, was no longer an adequate or sensitive enough\nterm. Rather, we need to think about well-being and to be\naware of all the factors that affect how a child grows and\ndevelops.29 And, we need to think about this through a pro-\nfessional perspective that engages with parents and the\nexpert led understanding of \"parenting.\"\nThe shift to well-being is important and appears to pull\ntogether past welfare concerns with wider concerns about\nsafety (or risk) and a more therapeutic approach to the parent\nand child. The term \"well-being\" itself has medical\nconnotations and is one that is often associated with mental\nand emotional \"well-being.\"30 Well-being is consequently an\nincredibly broad and flexible category demonstrated not only\nby the long list of (308) well-being signifiers but also by the\ncomment at the start of this list, which explained that this is\nwhat a child's well-being \"might\" look like. The word might\nis used because there is no limit to the situations or behaviors\nthat could be analyzed through the prism of well-being.\nGiving an idea of both the breadth of the category itself and\nits emotionally therapeutic dimensions, when discussing\npotential triggers that could be incorporated into the category\nof well-being in the future, Bob Fraser, a GIRFEC health\nadvisor suggested that a lack of hope, love, or spirituality,\nprovided by parents, could and perhaps should be the basis\nfor action. This, he noted, would mean intervening with chil-\ndren who are \"not just the usual suspects, not just for those\nthat we identity as those in need\" (Foster, 2015).\nCritics of the couplet of early intervention and child pro-\ntection, such as Featherstone, Morris, and White (2013),\nrightly point out that family support now comes with the lan-\nguage of intervention and prevention. They also argue that\nthis reflects a neoliberal policy that focuses on the poor and\nblames them for their problems. We need to defend the moral\nlegitimacy of support for families and to recognize that this\nis different from intervention, they argue. With the Named\nPerson however, although in practice it may well be poorer\nparents who are affected the most, in principle this is a uni-\nversal service for all parents and all children--\"not just the\nusual suspects.\" Also, it is not clear that this initiative can be\ncategorized as \"neoliberal,\" certainly not in the sense of peo-\nple being expected to be responsible in any classically liberal\nsense of the word. In many respects, the Named Person\nexpects a form of dependence from parents rather than\nindependence.\nAs we noted at the start of this article, there was a contrast\nbetween the \"old school\" nature of the opponents of the\nNamed Person and the new class of politicians, medical\nexperts, and child care professionals who supported it.31 The\nformer is more traditionally political, moral, and concerned\nabout rights (as freedoms). The latter rarely uses moral or\nwider political arguments or (ideologies) to explain their\ncase, but is rather more inclined to use a scientific and or\ntherapeutic language and to operate more technically and\nmanagerially when developing support mechanism for par-\nents and children. These defenders of the Named Person\nbecome irate when they are labeled as authoritarian and, like\nBob Fraser above, see themselves as caring supporters of\nfamilies and children, who they will often recognize, are liv-\ning in difficult circumstances.\nThis apparent anomaly can in part be explained by the\nshift away from ideas of left and right or the move to a \"third\nway\": a \"new\" (less overtly) political basis for developing\nstate policies and practices. Seen most clearly under New\nLabour, and continuing to this day, this approach helped to\ntransform the meaning of things, assisted in part by the shift\nto a therapeutic mind-set and one built upon a survivalist out-\nlook where safety and risk avoidance became more centrally\nimportant (Waiton, 2008). Now what it meant to be respon-\nsible changed, as did the notion of rights and the meaning of\nsupport.\n\"Rights and responsibilities\" became a couplet in the late\n1990s, the former being transformed from (as the name sug-\ngests) a right, to something that was given to you by the\nauthorities if you behaved responsibly. Here too, the mean-\ning of responsibility was transformed from something you\nwere fully accountable for toward a prescribed form of\nbehavior that was sanctioned by the state: You were respon-\nsible if you behaved correctly, for example, if you were quiet\nand did not upset your neighbors, and therefore, could be\nallowed your rights. Often associated with a discussion about\ncrime and safety, the meaning of freedom was also trans-\nformed at this time, with, for example, freedom being associ-\nated with the idea of freedom from fear: To be free, in this\ncontext, increasingly meant being protected from those\naround you often by new laws and powers being developed\nby the state. In this respect, it was the authorities who gave\nyou your rights and freedom rather than individuals exercis-\ning them themselves.\nIn the context of the Named Person, we find that your\nrights, as a parent are now more dependent upon your respon-\nsible parenting, which is being defined by the new class.\nRather than challenging parental responsibility directly how-\never, we find that what it means (or at least what the new\nclass means) by responsible has changed. A responsible par-\nent is now a safe parent, who must protect his or her child\nfrom harm--where what is harmful has itself expanded to\ninclude a new array of sins that are often related to health and\nemotional well-being. In addition, to be responsible, as the\nfamily policy documents above indicate, increasingly means\nbeing \"aware\" and accepting guidance about the minefield of\nparenting. Through the framework of well-being, a vast array\nof parental attitudes and behaviors can now be assessed and\nmonitored, all within the parameter of being a responsible\nparent.\nIndeed, within this new framework it is noticeable that\nold, structurally oriented ideas of inequality are now being\nreposed through the prism of \"health inequalities,\" a repos-\ning that shifts the governmental gaze away from wider ques-\ntions of deprivation onto questions of behavior, attitudes, and\nawareness, regarding forms of correct behavior in terms of\nboth your child's and your own physical and, perhaps more\nimportantly, mental/emotional well-being. In this respect, a\nneed for some economic transformation regarding the poor is\nmetamorphosized into the need for behavioral change among\nthose with health inequalities. The health visitor handbook\nadvises them to move to an approach that relates to \"wider\nfamily health.\" Here, activities (and indeed rights and free-\ndoms) in the private realm of the home are transformed into\nquasi-medical, public policy issues to be measured and cured\nby the new class.\nAs we noticed above, the more caring adoption of the cat-\negory of well-being is predicated upon the idea that \"wel-\nfare\" was not sensitive enough. At one level, this appears to\nbe a more empathetic perspective; at another, it reflects the\nperception that we need to be more sensitive because people,\nboth adults and children alike, need more sensitivity. They\nneed more sensitivity because they themselves are sensi-\ntive--they are fragile and as such need to be protected from\nmore aspects of life. At one level, this can be understood as\nless of a caring approach to people, than an infantilized one.\nA perspective based on the presumption that these \"sensi-\ntive\" people cannot possibly cope without support.\nThe space for the growing development of experts and\nprofessionals in family life has partly been provided by the\ndiminished sense of parental capacity, something that has\nbeen assisted by the problematization and professionaliza-\ntion of parenting (Furedi, 2001). It has become increasingly\naccepted within family policy documents across the United\nKingdom, for example, to presume that it should be the\n\"norm,\" as Alan Milburn argued, for families to be given\nadvice. Indeed a key Scottish government argument, about\nwhy the Named Person is needed, is that parents need some-\none to help them access services. But, it is rare to find a par-\nent who lacks the capacity to access the services her child\nneeds. It is much more common to find parents who know\nexactly what they need but unfortunately find that the ser-\nvices are not available for them.\nThe new class presumption of parental incapacity trans-\nforms, in their minds, the very idea of rights and support\nand the infantilized idea of rights comes to mean the right\nto receive support from experts. Through this diminished\nview of parents, the very idea of support and intervention\nbecomes one and the same thing. To cope alone, to be inde-\npendent, to take full responsibility for your family is a mis-\ntake, a fantasy and as such, to refuse this support is\nproblematic and must necessarily be treated with some sus-\npicion: To be private, independent, and autonomous as a\nfamily is now a barrier to the rights (read support) that you\nand your child needs.\nConclusion\nIn an interview with a mother, Anne Cannon, who opposes\nthe Named Person makes the point that there is an assump-\ntion that the state has a right to know everything that goes on\nin the home. But this is not the case she argues. Children\nneed to know when they come home it is their home and\nwhat happens here is private--\"they have to know they're\nsafe.\" For Anne Cannon, the safety and feeling of safety that\nher children experience is predicated upon the privacy pro-\nvided by the family home--privacy she believes will be\nundermined by the Named Person.32\nIn the end, it is the profoundly differing view of the family\nthat separates the NO2NP supporters from those who pro-\nmote the Named Person.\nIn 2013, the minister for Children and Young People,\nAileen Campbell, who is responsible for overseeing the\nNamed Person initiative defended the new government legis-\nlation explaining that \"we recognise that parents also have a\nrole,\" in raising their children (Borland, 2013, emphasis\nadded). It seems unlikely that politicians from previous gen-\nerations would have thought about parents or the family as\nsomething who \"also\" has a role in raising children.\nWhat has been lost within the new class is an under-\nstanding (or belief) in the central importance of individual\nmoral autonomy, something that is central to the under-\nstanding of the family as an important private \"institution\"\nin its own right.\nHistorically, governments in the United Kingdom saw the\nautonomy of the family and the privacy it provided, as\nimportant. Furedi notes, \"In the past, even radical thinkers\nwho regarded family life as stultifying still believed that a\nprivate life was essential for the moral development of peo-\nple\" (Furedi, 2004, p. 70). Today, the tension between state\nintervention into the family and support given to it, and the\npotential for undermining the independence of parents is\nrarely present in policy discussions. At best, a nod is given to\nthe notion of a private sphere, before the centrality of privacy\nand independence are gently pushed to one side: It is parents\nnot governments who raise children, we are informed, but\nparents (all parents) need support. Replacing the agonizing\nattempt of previous centuries to maintain family indepen-\ndence (Ramaekers & Suissa, 2012), we get a plethora of gov-\nernment documents and initiatives promoting \"support\" as\nthe new norm for parenting. Indeed, whereas for the 19th and\n(to an extent) the 20th century the ideal was to push the need\nfor self-reliance and autonomy, and to argue that \"to patrol\ntoday in comparison, the state is more inclined to see auton-\nomy as a barrier to the third-party support necessary to main-\ntain risk-free relationships in the family.\n"
