Meta-analytic evidence suggests that facial attractiveness\nsignals positive qualities, such as health, that are desirable in a mate (Langlois et al., 2000),\nand for this reason humans seem to have evolved to perceive and desire physical\nattractiveness (e.g., Grammer, Fink, M\u00f8ller, and Thornhill, 2003). It has been argued that\ntestosterone (T) levels depend on male condition in some species (Folstad and Karter,\n1992); this line of thinking has been extended to humans, and it has been argued that T\ncontributes to men's facial attractiveness (e.g., Roney, Hanson, Durante, and Maestripieri,\n2006; Roney, Simmons, and Gray, 2011). In line with this view, a meta-analysis of the\n(fairly inconsistent) literature regarding the relationship between male facial masculinity\nDigit ratio and male facial attractiveness\nand attractiveness found a moderate positive association (Rhodes, 2006). However, this\nview has been challenged in a recent review by Scott, Clark, Boothroyd, and Penton-Voak\n(2013), who argued that methodologically sound studies consistently demonstrate the\nabsence of such a relationship.\nSecond (index) finger length divided by fourth (ring) finger length (2D:4D) appears\nto be a marker of prenatal T/estrogen levels and has been widely used to study prenatal T\neffects in humans (Manning, 2012). Lower 2D:4D are male-typical and indicate higher\nprenatal T levels (Berenbaum, Bryk, Nowak, Quigley, and Moffat, 2009; H\u00f6nekopp and\nmale facial characteristics (Burriss, Little, and Nelson, 2007; Fink et al., 2005; Meindl,\nWindhager, Wallner, and Schaefer, 2012; Schaefer, Fink, Mitteroecker, Neave, and\nBookstein, 2005). Recently, Ferdenzi, Lema\u00eetre, Leong\u00f3mez, and Roberts (2011) reported\nsubstantial negative relationships between 2D:4D and facial attractiveness in a sample of\n49 male students, thus suggesting an advantageous effect of prenatal T on male looks.\nPreviously, Neave, Laing, Fink, and Manning (2003) also reported negative but small and\nnon-significant relationships in a sample of similar size; recently, Roberts et al. (2011)\nreported positive relationships (r  .10, n.s.) in a small sample. Thus, evidence for a\nnegative relationship between 2D:4D and male facial attractiveness appears equivocal.\nHere I report data from two considerably larger samples before I meta-analyze the available\nevidence in order to evaluate the idea that 2D:4D correlates negatively with male facial\nattractiveness.\nMaterials and Methods\nfrom secondary schools in Chemnitz (Germany) for a study on 2D:4D and sports\nperformance (H\u00f6nekopp, Manning, and M\u00fcller, 2006). Sample 2 consisted of a community\nsample of 80 young men (mean age 22.4 years, SD = 1.3) from Chemnitz, recruited for the\nsame study. All participants gave their informed consent.\nIn both hands, relevant finger lengths were measured three times from digital\nphotographs by independent researchers who were unaware of all other data (more details\ncan be found in H\u00f6nekopp et al., 2006). Reliability proved high (Cronbach's   .91).\n2D:4D values reported here are based on the mean across the three measurements of the\nsame fingers. In line with Ferdenzi et al. (2011), I report not only right-hand 2D:4D\n(2D:4Dr) and left-hand 2D:4D (2D:4Dl), but also the difference between the two (Dr-l\n),\nwhich has also been suggested to be inversely correlated with prenatal T effects (Manning,\nFrontal facial photographs were taken against a neutral background from a distance\nwore a bathing cap to conceal hair and showed a neutral facial expression; these\nstandardizations were not in place for sample 1 participants. Photos were cropped and\nresized to a standard height of 520 pixels. Female raters were approached on German\nuniversity campuses and rated the face photographs on a 7-point scale, either for\nattractiveness (with endpoints anchored \"not attractive\" and \"very attractive\") or for\nDigit ratio and male facial attractiveness\nmasculinity (with endpoints anchored \"not at all masculine\" and \"very masculine\").\nPictures were presented in an individually randomized order on notebook computers.\nfor attractiveness and another 15 women (most of them in their early twenties) rated them\nSD = 2.4) rated them for masculinity. Mean attractiveness and masculinity ratings for\npictures were used in subsequent analyses (sample 1: attractiveness Cronbach's  = .93,\nmasculinity Cronbach's  = .84; sample 2: attractiveness Cronbach's  = .89, masculinity\nCronbach's  = .84). In this way, raters' menstrual cycle and pill use were not taken into\naccount. However, cycle-dependent shifts in masculinity preferences are subtle (e.g.,\nPenton-Voak et al., 1999) and should therefore not override any general association\nbetween men's facial attractiveness and their 2D:4D; further, aggregation of data across all\nfemale raters is in keeping with previous studies in this area (e.g., Ferdenzi et al., 2011) and\nis supported by the high levels of internal consistency observed here. The sample-2 rating\ndata have been reported previously (H\u00f6nekopp, Rudolph, Beier, Liebert, and M\u00fcller, 2007),\nbut not in relation to 2D:4D.\nIn order to statistically control for friendliness of expression in sample-1 pictures,\nsix students and university staff rated to what extent all pictures showed a strong smile (-3\n= \"strongly disagree,\" 3 = \"strongly agree\"). Again, mean rating per picture (Cronbach's \n= .91) was used in the analysis.\nIn order to identify relevant previous results for inclusion in the meta-analysis, I\nsearched the topic field in Web of Knowledge for \"attractiveness\" in conjunction with either\n\"digit ratio\" or \"2D:4D.\" Among the 52 hits were six studies that had collected relevant\ndata. Three of them did not report any results on 2D:4D and male facial attractiveness.\nCorresponding authors were emailed about missing information; results for two out of the\nthree aforementioned papers could be recovered in this way. I conducted random-effects\nmeta-analyses (e.g., Schmidt, Oh, and Hayes, 2009) using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis\n(Version 2.2.064). A random-effects model takes into account that the estimated population\neffect size might not be a single value but might instead vary systematically with the type\nof sample, the methodology employed, or similar. Such heterogeneity is indicated by larger\nthan expected variance in the effect sizes of primary studies.  is the estimated standard\ndeviation of the population effect size and therefore describes the magnitude of the\nobserved heterogeneity; the Q statistic is used to test whether  differs significantly from\nzero.\nResults\nFacial attractiveness and 2D:4D in two male samples\nDescriptive statistics for digit ratio and rating data can be found in Table 1.\nCorrelations between digit ratio measures, facial attractiveness, and facial masculinity can\nbe found in Table 2. The sample 1 attractiveness data were corrected for smiling by using\nthe residuals from regressions of attractiveness on smiling; however, zero-order\ncorrelations with digit-ratio measures were virtually the same (not shown). Data inspection\nDigit ratio and male facial attractiveness\nconfirmed that none of the results was unduly affected by outliers. In both samples,\nattractiveness correlated strongly with masculinity (r  .58). Correlations between digit\nratio measures on the one side and ratings on the other side were all in the expected\n(negative) direction; however, correlations were small or near zero and none of them was\nstatistically significant (all ps  .060). Photographs showed a lower degree of\nstandardization in sample 1 than in sample 2. I therefore looked at the sub-set of all 85\nadolescents who did not wear glasses or any facial adornment. Compared to the full set\nresults, correlations hardly changed (details not shown).1\nTable 1. Descriptive statistics for digit ratio and facial attractiveness in males\nDr-l\nTable 2.

As the focus is on male faces here, only a brief\noverview is provided: Attractiveness (Cronbach's  = .93) and rated femininity (Cronbach's  = .88)\ncorrelated highly (r = .79). Paralleling the results for males, none of the three 2D:4D measures (left, right, r-l)\ncorrelated with either rated femininity (r = .07, r = -.02, r = -.09, respectively; all ps  .22) or attractiveness\nDigit ratio and male facial attractiveness\nphotographs which were rated by females, with the exception of Russell (2006), who used\nfemale and male attractiveness raters. Ferdenzi et al. (2011) was the only study that\nmeasured 2D:4D directly from the hands.\nTable 3.

Results for meta-\nanalyses reflect (from top to bottom) mean effect size (point estimate with p-value, 95% confidence interval)\nand heterogeneity (point estimate, test statistic, p-value).\nThe bottom part of Table 3 and Figure 1 show the results from three meta-analyses\n). For all three measures, small negative relationships emerged\nbetween 2D:4D and male facial attractiveness (largest for Dr-l\nconfidence intervals contained zero, thus results were not statistically significant.\nDiscussion\nIn two samples, negative relationships between 2D:4D and male facial\nattractiveness emerged; however, these relationships were weak and not statistically\nsignificant, although sample sizes were large in comparison to most studies in the field (cf.\nTable 3). Any link between attractiveness and 2D:4D should be mediated by facial\nmasculinity (Ferdenzi et al., 2011), but a positive relationship between attractiveness and\nmeasured masculinity is not consistently found (DeBruine, Jones, Smith, and Little, 2010;\nRhodes, 2006; Scott et al., 2013). Here, however, strong relationships emerged with rated\nmasculinity (r  .60). Thus, the observed lack of association between 2D:4D and\nattractiveness was down to weak associations between rated masculinity and 2D:4D in both\nsamples (r  -.10, n.s.).\nDigit ratio and male facial attractiveness\nFigure 1. Meta-analyses' estimates of population correlations between 2D:4D and male\nfacial attractiveness, with 95% confidence intervals\nSome limitations of the studies should be taken into consideration. Sample 1\nphotographs were not highly standardized. However, neither the statistical correction of\nattractiveness for smiling nor the exclusion of models wearing glasses or facial adornment\nchanged the results, which suggests that lack of standardization did not cause major\nproblems. Another point is that, due to age differences, many of the attractiveness raters\nwould probably not consider the models as potential partners (especially for sample 1).\nHowever, averaged ratings of facial attractiveness appear to be similar across different\ngroups of raters (Langlois et al., 2000) and, considerable variation of rater age\nnotwithstanding, the internal consistency of averaged attractiveness ratings was high in\nboth samples (Cronbach's   .89).\nA meta-analysis of the available data revealed small negative relationships (r  -\n.07) between male facial attractiveness and 2D:4Dl, 2D:4Dr, and Dr-l.\nNone of the effects\nwere statistically significant; thus the findings available to date offer no convincing support\nfor a relationship between 2D:4D and male facial attractiveness.\nThe relationship between 2D:4D and male facial attractiveness is of interest because\ncomparing 2D:4D between groups of people who differ in prenatal T effects (females\nversus males; people affected from congenital adrenal hyperplasia, complete androgen\ninsensitivity syndrome, or Klinefelter's syndrome versus unaffected controls) consistently\nfound that the group differences in 2D:4D are substantially smaller than the group\ndifferences in prenatal T effects (Berenbaum et al., 2009; H\u00f6nekopp and Watson, 2010;\nManning et al., 2013). This suggests that 2D:4D and prenatal T levels might not correlate\nvery highly. Therefore, relationships between 2D:4D and characteristics of interest might\nbe substantially attenuated in comparison with prenatal T effects on these characteristics\n(e.g., Kline, 2005). Consequently, even a small relationship between 2D:4D and male facial\nDigit ratio and male facial attractiveness\nattractiveness would be of theoretical interest. We should bear this in mind when judging\nthe CIs (cf. Figure 1), which indicate the range of plausible estimates for the correlation in\nthe population (Cumming, Fidler, Kalinowski, and Lai, 2012). For example, I would\ncertainly regard a correlation of r = -.20 as meaningful in the present context, and this is\nstill captured in two out of the three CIs. Thus, support for the null hypothesis does not\nseem very strong.\nIn sum, though, the data do not support an effect of prenatal T on male facial\nattractiveness. This is in line with the view that facial masculinity and attractiveness are\nlargely independent and that the former is more important in the context of intra-sexual\n"
