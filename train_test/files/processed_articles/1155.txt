We gave focus to the effects of\ndemographic variables, physical health constraints (chronic conditions and functional disability), and\npsychosocial attributes (sense of mastery, religiosity, social support, and satisfaction with support), along with\ntheir interactive roles. We identified lower education, greater functional disability, lower sense of mastery, and\npoorer satisfaction with support as common risk factors for depressive symptoms in both groups; in contrast, the\neffects of age, gender, and religiosity were race specific. In addition, we obtained significant interactions among\npredictor variables in each group, identifying risk-reducing and risk-enhancing factors within each group.\nTHE DRAMATIC growth of aging populations coupled\nwith the increasing proportion of racial or ethnic\nminorities prompts the need for research on minority elders.\nA particularly urgent social issue lies in the mental health arena.\nCompared with the rapidly accumulating research on disparities\nin physical health (e.g., Ferraro & Farmer, 1996; Williams &\nCollins, 1995), less attention has been paid to racial or ethnic\ndifferences in mental health (Blazer, Landerman, Hays,\nSimonsick, & Saunders, 1998; Jackson, Antonucci, & Gibson,\nthat racial or ethnic minority elders, including older African\nAmericans, are more vulnerable to depression than their non-\nHispanic White counterparts (e.g., Cochran, Brown, &\nMcGregor, 1999; Dunlop, Song, Lyons, Manheim, & Chang,\n2003). However, the findings are not always consistent, with\nsome studies suggesting higher rates of depression among\nWhites (e.g., Kessler, Mickelson, & Williams, 1999; Turnbull\n& Mui, 1995) and others finding no racial differences (e.g.,\nBlazer et al.; Cummings, Neff, & Husaini, 2003). In part, these\ninconclusive findings seem to reflect differences in age range\nand composition of the samples, research settings, and the\nselected measures for depression.\nIn the present study we focused on depressive symptoms in\ntwo racial groups: older African Americans and older non-\nHispanic Whites. Given that race is not a simple measure of\ngenetic or biological distinction but a gross indicator of social\nand cultural values and beliefs (Williams, Yu, & Jackson,\n1997), an individual's racial group may exert varying degrees\nof influence over his or her behavior and psychological well-\nbeing. The extent of this influence depends on factors such\nas income, education, and geographic region of origin or\nresidence, and research suggests that the patterns of presenting\ndepressive moods and correlates of depressive symptoms may\nvary across racial groups (Blazer et al., 1998). This diversity,\nin the context of an assessment of risk or protective factors\nfor depressive symptoms, has to be explored from a cross-\nracial perspective.\nThe present study is guided by a basic stress and coping\nmodel that we modified to incorporate factors sensitive to\ncultural differences. Following Lazarus and Folkman (1984,\np. 19), we defined stress as ``a particular relationship between\nthe person and the environment that is appraised by the person\nas taxing or exceeding his or her resources and endangering\nwell-being.'' Fundamental to this definition is the inclusion of\nnot only of stressors but also individuals' subjective in-\nterpretation of and reaction to potential stressors. Also of\nrelevance to this definition is the idea that the stressfulness\nof a stimulus is determined by individuals' personal resources\n(Haley & Jang, 2002). In the process of stress and coping, racial\ngroups may show differences in the exposure to stressors, the\nlevel of personal resources, and the manifestations of outcomes\nof stress.\nIn studies of older populations, it is generally recognized that\ncertain demographic characteristics (e.g., being of advanced\nage, female gender, unmarried status, and low socioeconomic\nstatus) increase vulnerability to depressive symptoms across all\nracial or ethnic groups (Cummings et al., 2003; Turnbull &\nMui, 1995). Declines in physical health are also recognized as\none of the most common concerns and sources of stress among\nolder populations (Blazer, Moody-Ayers, Craft-Morgan, &\nconceptualized physical health constraints, indicated by\nchronic conditions and functional disability, as a major stressor\nin later years.\nA growing body of literature demonstrates that individuals\nwith positive coping resources are likely to fare well when\nfaced with stressful life conditions (Haley & Jang, 2002).\nAmong coping resources, the sense of mastery or a feeling of\ncontrol over one's life and environment has received particular\nattention (e.g., Pearlin & Schooler, 1978). An impressive body\nof literature has demonstrated the beneficial role of sense of\nmastery, and there is consensus that sense of mastery is an\nindicator of psychological resilience that can facilitate adapta-\ntion to changes, overcome negative consequences, and promote\nphysical and emotional well-being (Jang, Haley, Small, &\nPearlin, & Schaie, 2003). Two other coping resources, which\nare of special relevance when studying African American\nJournal of Gerontology: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES Copyright 2005 by The Gerontological Society of America\ngroups, are religiosity (Koenig, McCullough, & Larson, 2001;\nLevin, Chatters, & Taylor, 1995) and social support (Dilworth-\nresources are known to be associated with more positive\nemotional states and with more successful efforts to cope with\nstress (George; Koenig et al.). However, few researchers have\nconsidered whether the aforementioned psychosocial coping\nresources function in the same way and to the same extent in\nAfrican Americans and Whites. Given that African American\nculture places a strong emphasis on religious engagement\n(Cummings et al., 2003; Jang, Graves, Haley, Small, &\nbenefits from religiosity among older African Americans may\nbe particularly salient.\nAs a way of exploring within-group variability, we were also\ninterested in assessing the interactions between the major\nstressor being considered (physical health constraints) and cop-\ning resources (psychosocial attributes) in determining depres-\nsive symptoms. A sizable body of literature has demonstrated\nthat the effect of health problems on mental well-being varies\nby the level of psychosocial resources. Negative consequences\nof diseases and disability have shown to be buffered by a\net al., 1995), and social support (Hays, Steffens, Flint,\nage and gender may condition the effects of health constraints\nand psychosocial attributes (e.g., Keyes, 2004), we also took\nmodifications by age and gender into consideration in our pre-\ndictive models of depressive symptoms.\nTaken together, our purpose in the present study was to\nexplore determinants of depressive symptoms in African\nAmerican and White older adults, conceptualizing physical\nhealth constraints (chronic conditions and functional disability)\nas a major stressor and psychosocial attributes (sense of\nmastery, religiosity, social support, and satisfaction with\nsupport) as coping resources. We examined racial differences\nand within-group variability by testing direct and moderating\neffects. An assessment of the unique characteristics of racial\ngroups and individual variability within each group can help\nidentify race-specific risk or protective factors for depressive\nsymptoms and risk-reducing and risk-enhancing factors within\neach group.\nMETHODS\nParticipants\nWe selected the individuals for the present analysis from two\nmethodologically standardized studies of African American and\nWhite older adults. The African American sample came from\nthe Hillsborough Elder African American Life Study (HEALS)\nand the White sample from the Charlotte County Healthy\nAging Study (CCHAS). For the HEALS and the CCHAS,\nindividuals were recruited from randomly selected blocks of\ntwo U.S. census tracts each in Hillsborough and Charlotte\nCounty, Florida. The samples included community-dwelling\nindividuals between the ages of 60 and 84 years. More detailed\ninformation on the studies and sampling procedures can be\nsubjects and 466 (57.7%) CCHAS subjects agreed to participate\nin the interviews. We excluded individuals whose race was\nidentified as non-White in the CCHAS and those who had\nmissing information in more than 10% of the variables, leaving\nthe White sample.\nMeasures\nOutcome variable (depressive symptoms). --The Geriatric\nDepression Scale\u00adShort Form (GDS-SF; Sheikh & Yesavage,\n1986) was used to assess depressive symptoms. Using a yes\u00adno\nformat, respondents rated 15 items (e.g., ``Do you feel your life\nis empty?'' and ``Are you in good spirits mostly?''). Scores on\nthe GDS-SF ranged from 0 (no depressive symptoms) to 15\n(severe depressive symptoms). A score of 5 and above is\nsuggested as indicative of a probable depression (Sheikh &\nYesavage). Cronbach's alpha for the scale was acceptable to\nsatisfactory (a \u00bc 0.60 for the African American sample; a \u00bc\nMajor stressor (physical health constraints). --Chronic\nconditions were measured with a checklist that asked\nrespondents whether a doctor had ever told them that they\nhad specific diseases or conditions such as heart disease, high\nblood pressure, diabetes, stroke, cancer, and arthritis. We used\na total count of diseases and conditions in the analyses.\nFunctional disability was measured with 17 items drawn\nfrom the Activities of Daily Living list (Katz, 1983), the\nInstrumental Activities of Daily Living list (Lawton & Brody,\nFunctional Health Scale (Rosow & Breslau, 1966). Respond-\nents were asked whether they had difficulty in performing each\nof the activities on the list. The potential range of total scores\nwas 0 (no difficulty on any item) to 17 (difficulty on all items).\nCronbach's alpha for the scale was high (a \u00bc 0.85 for the\nAfrican American sample, a \u00bc 0.84 for the White sample).\nCoping resources (psychosocial attributes). --Sense of\nmastery was measured with the Pearlin and Schooler Mastery\nScale (1978). The seven items included statements such as ``I\ncannot solve my problems'' and ``My future mostly depends on\nme,'' and we scored each on a 4-point scale. Scores on the\nmastery scale range from 7 (low mastery) to 28 (high mastery).\nCronbach's alpha for this scale was acceptable to satisfactory\nWhite sample).\nReligiosity was measured with four items that covered\nservice attendance, religious comfort, importance of religious\nfaith, and frequency of prayer or meditation. Cronbach's alpha\nfor the scale based on these four items was shown to be\nsatisfactory in both groups (a \u00bc 0.75 for the African American\nsample, a \u00bc 0.83 for the White sample). The properties\nand utility of the scale were reported in a previous study (Jang\nSocial support and satisfaction with support were measured\nwith a composite measure from the work of Krause and\nBorawski-Clark (1995). Individuals were asked to report how\noften they received various types of support, including\ninstrumental support (such as help with chores), informational\nsupport (such as sharing suggestions and information), and\nemotional support (such as having others listen and show\ninterest). In addition, respondents were asked to report how\nsatisfied they were with the instrumental, informational, and\nemotional support they received. Cronbach's alphas for social\nsupport and satisfaction with support were acceptable to high\nDemographic variables. --Demographic information in-\ncluded age (in years), gender (\u00c01 \u00bc male, 1 \u00bc female), race\n(\u00c01 \u00bc African American, 1 \u00bc White), marital status (\u00c01 \u00bc not\nmarried, 1 \u00bc married), and education (in years).\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics of the Participants\nResults of descriptive analyses comparing the two samples\nare shown in Table 1. The 255 African American older adults\nand 452 White older adults had comparable gender distribu-\ntions, but they differed in other demographic characteristics.\nThe African American individuals were significantly younger,\nless likely to be currently married, and had lower educational\nattainment than the White individuals.\nThere were no differences in the number of chronic health\nconditions reported, but the White participants reported greater\nlevels of functional disability. African American older adults\nscored lower in their sense of mastery, but their scores on\nreligiosity, social support, and satisfaction with support were\nconsistently higher than those of Whites. Results based on the\nGDS-SF indicated that African Americans reported more\nsymptoms than Whites, and the difference remained significant\nafter we controlled for age, gender, and marital status [F(4, 695)\ncutoff point of 5 (Sheikh & Yesavage, 1986), we found that the\ntwo groups were relatively equal; approximately 10% of the\nAfrican American sample and 9% of the White sample fell into\nthe category of probable depression.\nAssessment of the Cross-Racial Comparability of\nthe GDS-SF\nOne question of concern in research across racial or ethnic\ngroups has to do with whether various groups respond to\na standard instrument in the same way. To assess the\ncomparability of the GDS-SF between African American and\nWhite participants, we ran separate principal component factor\nanalyses of the GDS-SF with varimax rotation. Each of the two\nanalyses yielded a four-factor solution, explaining 53.3% and\n52.6% of the variance respectively. We quantified the com-\nparability of the two factor matrices by calculating congruence\ncoefficients between the rotated factors of each group in the\nsame order (Gorsuch, 1974). Congruence coefficients for the\nan overall congruence coefficient of 0.91. Given that the values\ngreater than 0.90 conventionally indicate factor invariance\n(Gorsuch), these results suggest that the GDS-SF is, on the\nwhole, a comparable measure across the African American and\nWhite samples.\nRegression Models of Depressive Symptoms in\nAfrican Americans and Whites\nTable 2 summarizes the results of the hierarchical regression\nmodels for depressive symptoms. In a preliminary analysis, we\nassessed bivariate correlations and variance inflation factor\n(VIF) statistics to understand the underlying associations\namong study variables and to detect multicollinearity. For each\nracial group, we then estimated a separate regression model\nwith the same sets of predictors entered in the following order:\n(a) demographic variables, (b) major stressors (chronic con-\nditions and functional disability), and (c) coping resources\n(sense of mastery, religiosity, social support, and satisfaction\nwith support). In addition to the direct effect model, interactions\nbetween physical health constraints and psychosocial attributes\n(eight terms) and modifications by age (six terms) and gender\n(six terms) were tested as a final step. To maintain a sufficient\nratio between the number of subjects and predictor variables\nentered in the regression model, we entered each interaction\nterm independently. The interaction terms that reached sta-\ntistical significance are presented in Table 2. In computing\ninteraction terms, we used centered scores to avoid multi-\ncollinearity between direct effects and interaction terms.\nBoth samples of individuals showed a significant increment\nin the amount of variance explained in each step of the\nhierarchical regression models. The total amount of variance\naccounted for by the estimated direct effect model was 43% in\ncommon significant predictors of depressive symptoms across\nthe two groups included lower education, greater functional\ndisability, lower sense of mastery, and poorer satisfaction with\nsupport. We found gender and religiosity to be significant\npredictors only in the African American sample. We obtained\na significant association between age and depressive symptoms\nonly in the White sample. The findings imply a particular\nTable 1.

In subsequent analyses with 20 possible interaction\nterms, we obtained statistical significance in the African\nAmerican sample for Gender 3 Sense of mastery, Gender 3\nReligiosity, Chronic conditions 3 Sense of mastery, and\nFunctional disability 3 Sense of mastery. In the White sample,\nwe found significant interactions for Age3Functional disability\nand Functional disability 3 Sense of mastery. For further\ninvestigation of the significant interactions, we stratified each\nsample into subgroups based on the moderating factors, and we\ncompared the correlations between predictive variables and\ndepressive symptoms in the subgroups by using Fisher's r-to-z\ntransformation, a statistical method to determine the difference\nbetween independent correlation coefficients (Steiger, 1980).\nTable 3 summarizes analyses with the African American\nsample. The correlation between sense of mastery and\ndepressive symptoms was stronger in women than in men,\nand the difference in coefficients was statistically significant.\nWe found a similar pattern for religiosity; the association\nbetween religiosity and depressive symptoms in women was\ngreater than it was in men, although these differences were not\nstatistically significant. When we divided the African American\nsample into low and high groups based on the median score of\nsense of mastery (20), the low-mastery group presented a strong\ncorrelation coefficient of depressive symptoms with chronic\nconditions and with functional disability. However, the high-\nmastery group did not show any significant association of\ndepressive symptoms with chronic conditions and functional\ndisability. The differences between the coefficients in the low-\nand high-mastery groups were statistically significant.\nAs shown in Table 4, for the White sample, the older\ngroup (aged 75 and older) showed a stronger association\nbetween functional disability and depressive symptoms than\ndid the younger group, and the difference was statistically\nsignificant. The low-mastery group (scores below 22) also\nshowed a stronger coefficient between functional disability and\ndepressive symptoms than did the high-mastery group, and the\nTable 3.

Drawing on a stress and coping model\n(Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), we conceptualized physical health\nconstraints as a major stressor, a variety of psychosocial at-\ntributes as coping resources, and depressive symptoms as an\noutcome. Our purposes in the present analyses were (a) to\nidentify similarities and differences in the determinants of de-\npressive symptoms across the racial groups and (b) to explore\nwithin-group variability by testing direct and moderating\neffects of demographic variables, physical health constraints,\nand psychosocial attributes.\nFrom a sociodemographic perspective, the two samples were\nsignificantly different in terms of the proportion of individuals\nwho were married and the educational level that the individuals\nhad attained. These differences mirror the underlying socio-\ndemographic differences manifest at state and federal levels,\nwhere older African Americans exhibit lower educational\nattainment and are less likely than Whites to be married (e.g.,\nThe preliminary investigation addressed the issue of\nmeasurement comparability of the GDS-SF. When making\ncomparisons between groups representing potentially different\nsociocultural backgrounds, we find that it is essential to ensure\nthat a test measures the same underlying construct without\ncultural biases. This issue is particularly salient when an\ninstrument initially developed among Whites is applied to\nAfrican Americans or other racial or ethnic groups (Gallo,\nA number of studies have applied the GDS to African\nAmerican samples and verified its psychometric quality (e.g.,\ncomparability of the GDS response patterns between Whites\nand African Americans has rarely been considered (Mui,\nBurnette, & Chen, 2002). In the present study, we empirically\naddressed the issue by comparing GDS-SF factor structures\nbetween the racial groups. The high overall congruence\ncoefficient obtained in the present investigation indicates that\nthe instrument was comparable at least for the two samples\nbeing considered. This latter finding established the appropri-\nateness of further comparative analyses.\nIn subsequent analyses, African American older adults were\nshown to endorse significantly more depressive symptoms than\ntheir White counterparts, and this finding is consistent with\nstudies showing a greater vulnerability to mental health\nproblems among minority elders (e.g., Cochran et al., 1999;\nDunlop et al., 2003). In contrast, the two groups were strikingly\nsimilar in the majority of factors identified as predictors of\ndepressive symptoms. In both groups, lower education was\nconnected to the higher levels of depressive symptoms, and\nfunctional disability was shown to be a significant health-\nrelated stressor. Among the variety of coping resources exam-\nined, sense of mastery and satisfaction with support reached\nstatistical significance in both groups. These results parallel\nprevious research findings on risk factors (e.g., low socioeco-\nnomic status and poor physical health status) and protective\nfactors (e.g., sense of mastery and social resources) for depres-\nsive symptoms across diverse populations (Blazer et al., 2002;\nare consistent with the literature showing the greater signifi-\ncance of functional disability in comparison with chronic con-\nditions (Zeiss, Lewinsohn, Rohde, & Seeley, 1996) and of the\nperceived quality of support versus the quantity or frequency\nof support (Dilworth-Anderson & Burton, 1999; George) in\ndetermining emotional well-being.\nWe also identified several group-specific predictors of\ndepressive symptoms. Only among Whites was advanced age\na risk factor for depressive symptoms, and among African\nAmericans being female and being less religious represented\nrisk factors. The latter relationship, which can also be described\nas an association of religiosity with well-being, has been\ndemonstrated in other studies of African American elders (e.g.,\nThe reason for this association has yet to be explicated, but\npossible mechanisms for the function of religiosity include\nbuffering the adverse effects of life stresses, strengthening\ncognitive coping abilities, aiding people in finding meaning in\nthe face of adversity, and increasing social connectivity\nOur findings emphasize the need to evaluate the particular\nrole of religiosity among African Americans. A strong\nemphasis on religious engagement has often been reported in\nstudies of African Americans and has been viewed as\na representation of their cultural identity (Koenig et al., 2001;\nLevin et al., 1995). Results suggested that religious beliefs may\nprovide African American elders with psychological resilience\nagainst adversities. This finding expands on previous research\nshowing that African Americans not only have a greater level of\nreligious engagement but also enjoy a comparatively significant\nbenefit from it. However, the power of faith may have its\ndownside. The present results suggest that African Americans\nwho run counter to the norm by exhibiting low religiosity may\nbe at particular risk, and mental health professionals may not\nrecognize this risk if they lack familiarity with the role of\nreligiosity in the African American community. Moreover,\neven very religious African Americans may feel stigmatized by\nmental health problems. Empirical studies have shown that\nAfrican Americans are more likely to perceive depression as\npersonal weakness (Mills, Alea, & Cheong, 2004) and may use\nnegative religious coping such as redefining a situation as\npunishment from divine sources or as a weakness in faith\n(Pargament, Koenig, & Perez, 2000). As a common saying in\nthe African American community goes, ``The Lord won't put\nmore on me than I can bear.'' Clearly, the association of the\nreligious experience with mental health and illness among\nAfrican American elders is complex, and the findings of the\npresent study can do little other than invite further research. The\nresults do suggest that strategies to utilize religious coping in\na positive way to promote mental well-being should be sought.\nIn addition to the direct effect model, we tested interactions\namong predictive variables to explore within-group variability\nand identify risk-reducing and risk-enhancing factors in each\ngroup. We found the involvement of religiosity and sense of\nmastery with depressive symptoms to be more complex among\nthe African American participants. For the latter, the associa-\ntion between mastery and religiosity with mental health was\nstronger among women than men. These findings suggest that\nAfrican American women may be particularly likely to respond\nto interventions designed to strengthen or sustain their sense of\nmastery and religiosity.\nOne of the key findings from this study is that, in both\nsamples, a sense of mastery not only directly predicted\ndepressive symptoms but also had significant interactions with\nfunctional disability. The finding is consistent with the literature\nshowing the significant roles of sense of mastery in buffering\nnegative consequences of physical health problems and\nprotecting mental health outcomes (e.g., Jang et al., 2002;\nthe previous findings are based on information from White\nparticipants, it is notable that in the present study we found the\nsame pattern of modification among African American older\nadults. We also found the buffering role of sense of mastery for\nchronic conditions in the African American sample but not in\nthe White sample.\nIn the White sample, the negative effects of functional\ndisability on mental well-being were shown to be greater\namong individuals of advanced age. This finding suggests that\na combination of older age and having disabilities can markedly\nreduce mental well-being. It is notable that the interactive role\nof age and disability was only observed among White older\nadults. These results can be considered in light of cultural\nvalues and beliefs regarding aging. On one hand, among\nWhites, whose cultural values are oriented on independence\nand youth, the experiences of growing old and having\nfunctional difficulties may be more likely to be perceived as\ndeclines or losses and have more debilitating effects on\nemotional well-being. On the other hand, African Americans,\nwho are reported to have more favorable perspectives on aging\nand the aged and to be more resilient against adversities in the\net al., 1997), have attenuated negative effects with regard to\nadvanced age and mental health. It is also notable that the\nAfrican Americans included in the present study represent\na cohort that survived the era of racial segregation and\ninequality. The sociohistorical experiences shared by this\ncohort may have collectively influenced their beliefs and\nattitudes, and in particular may have provided them an\nopportunity to develop psychological resilience and strength\nBecause we used geographically defined samples and a cross-\nsectional study design, we cannot generalize the findings to the\nnational level or draw causal inferences. It should also be noted\nthat the present analysis only included objective indicators of\nhealth-related stressors such as the existence of disease and\ndisability, without considering perceived difficulties or stressful-\nness from those conditions. Given the importance of subjective\nappraisals in stress and coping models, future studies should\naddress racial variations in appraisals of the stressful life\nconditions and their consequences in mental health. In addition,\nby including younger individuals, future studies can address\ncohort or generational differences in mental health across racial\ngroups. Because the overall reliability coefficients of the multi-\nitem scales were lower among African Americans compared\nwith those among Whites, further research on the issues of\npsychometric qualities and cross-group equivalence would\nappear useful. The results may be idiosyncratic to the present\nstudy or may reflect a larger phenomenon.\nDespite these limitations, the present study was able to\naddress the relevance of stress and coping factors for late life\ndepression from a cross-racial perspective. Our findings on\nracial differences and within-group variability provide insights\nto guide prevention or intervention strategies for the mental\nwell-being of populations with diverse backgrounds. For White\nolder adults, psychosocial and educational interventions to alter\nnegative perceptions of aging may be useful to facilitate positive\nadaptation to the changes and challenges with aging. The\nparticular benefit of religiosity among African American older\nadults deserves attention and has to be utilized when social\nservices and programs are designed. Utilization of community\nresources through religious organizations is strongly encouraged\nin African American communities. The interventions to preserve\nand promote personal feelings of mastery will be beneficial to\nolder individuals regardless of their racial orientations. The\nidentification and utilization of psychosocial attributes amenable\nto specific racial groups may increase the cultural competence\nand effectiveness of social services and programs.\n"
