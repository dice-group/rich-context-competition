Clinical complications\nof SCD include vaso-occlusive pain crises, anemic episodes,\ninfections, and stroke (Frank, Allison, & Cant, 1999; Smith,\n1989). Health care utilization for children with SCD has\nbeen well documented largely due to an increase of studies\nusing administrative claims data (Grosse, Boulet, Amendah,\n& Oyeku, 2010). Children with SCD have mean expendi-\ntures 8.8 times that of children in general (Bilenker, Weller,\nShaffer, Dover, & Anderson, 1998). Relative to children with\nother chronic illnesses, children with SCD have a higher fre-\nquency of hospitalizations and longer mean length of stay\n(Ireys, Anderson, Shaffer, & Neff, 1997). In addition, chil-\ndren with SCD have rehospitalization rates as high as 23%\n(Brousseau, Owens, Mosso, Panepinto, & Steiner, 2010).\nThe average medical fee for a child with SCD during child-\nCoates, Huazhi, Mody-Patel, & Hartzema, 2009).\nCumulatively, these studies indicate that despite progress in\nthe evaluation and management of SCD (Halasa et al., 2007;\nSteinberg et al., 2003; Vichinsky, Hurst, Earles, Kleman, &\nLubin, 1988), care of affected children continues to be\nhigh-cost and resource-intensive (Amendah, Mvundura,\nMvundura, Amendah, Kavanagh, Sprinz, & Grosse, 2009;\nRaphael et al., 2009; Raphael, Mei, Mueller, & Giordano,\nWhile the relative efficiency and low cost of claims data\nhave yielded new insights into health care utilization for\npediatric SCD, uncertainties remain as to whether routine\nclaims data may lack sufficient information to fully charac-\nterize medial service use. A number of past studies have\nquestioned the utility of administrative claims data for\nassessing health care utilization and quality given well-\ndocumented limitations including coding errors and mis-\nclassifications of health care use (Iezzoni, 1997;\nSteinwachs et al., 1998). However, few studies have\nfocused on a single chronic condition (Pawlson, Scholle, &\nPowers, 2007). While medical record review may provide\nmore clinical data relative to administrative claims, it is\nlimited particularly when records are only available from a\n1Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA\n2Texas Children's Health Plan, Houston, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nAngelo P.

To evaluate the\nhealth care utilization of children with SCD who were\nenrolled in a Medicaid managed care program, we compared\nadministrative claims data with medical record chart review.\nOur specific study questions were (a) whether medical record\nreview supplements administrative claims data for SCD and\n(b) the degree to which children with SCD concurrently\nreceive care at multiple institutions.\nMethod\nStudy Design\nA retrospective, cross-sectional descriptive analysis was\nconducted based on claims data from Texas Children's\nHealth Plan (TCHP) and medical record review from Texas\nChildren's Hospital (TCH) to assess health care utilization of\nchildren with SCD. TCHP is a health maintenance organiza-\ntion for children with public insurance and the largest pro-\nvider of care for children with Medicaid and the State\nChildren's Health Insurance Plan (SCHIP) in the greater\nHouston area. TCH is a large, tertiary freestanding children's\nhospital in Houston, Texas. The study was approved by the\ninstitutional review board at the Baylor College of Medicine.\nStudy Population\nThe goal of selection was to identify children with SCD who\nwere TCHP members and also received medical services at\nTCH. SCD was identified using International Classification\nof Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modifications (ICD-9CM)\ncode 282.6 which encompasses sickle cell hemoglobinopa-\nthies. Medical services were defined as emergency care\n(ER), hospitalizations, hematology visits, primary care phy-\nsician (PCP) visits, and radiologic imaging. The initial target\npopulation consisted of children ages 0 to 18 years who\nreceived health care services paid by TCHP at any time dur-\ning 2007 and had a minimum of one medical service at TCH\nduring the same period. We then excluded members who had\nless than 10 months of contiguous enrollment within TCHP\nduring the calendar year, as done in a prior study (Raphael et\nbers who comprised our study sample.\nAdministrative Database\nThe study used administrative data from TCHP for the calen-\ndar year 2007 that included diagnoses and medical services.A\nthird-party software was used to collect demographic and\nutilization data for members with SCD and migrate them to a\nrelational database containing chart review data. To protect\npatient confidentiality, we created an interface between the\nadministrative claims and chart review data that permitted an\nindividual patient's data to be merged but which de-identified\nthe matched data at the time of the analysis.\nWe collected demographic data and medical service use.\nPatient characteristics consisted of age, gender, race/ethnic-\nity, sickle cell phenotype, receipt of comprehensive care at\nTCH, public insurance type, continuous enrollment months\nin calendar year, and distance from TCH. Age was divided\ninto categories of <1 year (infant), 1 to 4 years (preschool\ncence). Racial/ethnic information was categorized as White,\nBlack, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, or Other. For each\npatient, we determined whether they received comprehen-\nsive hematology care at TCH. For the purpose of this study,\nreceipt of comprehensive hematology care was defined as a\nminimum of one routine visit to the sickle cell center at TCH.\nPublic insurance was categorized as Medicaid versus SCHIP.\nContinuous enrollment in the study calendar year was\ngrouped as 10, 11, or 12 months. Finally, for each patient, we\ncalculated the distance from their home to TCH by using dis-\ntances between zip codes.\nFor medical service use, we recorded ER visits, hospital-\nizations, and routine hematology visits for SCD. We also\nassessed PCP encounters, both preventive visits and urgent\ncare visits. Finally, we recorded Transcranial Doppler\nUltrasound (TCD) screening, a recommended annual screen-\ning test for children with SCD to assess stroke risk (National\nSupplemental Medical Record Review\nUsing unique identifiers from TCHP administrative claims,\nwe matched and identified medical record numbers for\nTCHP members with SCD who received care at TCH. While\nTCH has the largest children's hospital in Houston, children\nwith SCD enrolled in TCHP have access to non-TCH institu-\ntions within the city. A diagnosis of SCD from the adminis-\ntrative claims was verified with TCH medical records to\nminimize misclassification errors. A chart review was con-\nducted to determine documentation of all health care utiliza-\ntion occurring at TCH for the study period.\nStatistical Analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used to summarize patient demo-\ngraphics and health care utilization. For health care utiliza-\ntion, we calculated total encounters per unique member\nseparately for claims data and medical record review. This\nratio was calculated by dividing the total number of a given\nencounter type by the total number of unique members hav-\ning that encounter. All analyses were conducted using\nRaphael et al. 3\nTable 1.

The\nmean age of patients was 5.7 years. Children ages 1 to 4\nyears accounted for half of all patients. African American\nand Hispanic children comprised more than 80% of the\nstudy sample. The majority of children did not receive\ncomprehensive care at TCH. Most children were insured\nthrough Medicaid. Almost 70% of the study sample lived\nwithin 20 miles of TCH.\nMedical Service Utilization--Claims Versus Chart\nReview\nResults comparing administrative claims with chart review\ndata are shown in Table 2. For ER visits, the ratio of total\nencounters per unique member was 2.2 for claims compared\nwith 1.5 for medical record review. The total encounters per\nunique member ratio was also higher for claims relative to\nmedical record review for routine hematology visits.\nOutpatient hematology care demonstrated notable patterns.\nA total of 49 members generated 226 visits with hematology\naccording to TCHP claims data. Within TCH alone, 51\nmembers (including 2 members not identified in claims\ndata) accounted for 158 visits with hematology according to\nTCH chart review. For PCP visits, 154 unique members\naccounted for 654 PCP visits, or 4.3 claims per person.\nHealth care utilization at TCH only accounted for a fraction\nof these encounters. According to medical record review, 14\nPCP encounters were documented among 6 unique mem-\nbers, or 2.3 visits per person. Of the PCP visits, 57%\nwere coded as urgent according to claims review (data not\nshown). Of 154 members, 20 did not have any office visits\nwith a PCP according to claims review. Of this group, 7\nmembers had at least 1 office visit with a hematologist. For\nhospitalizations, the total encounters per unique member\nwere lower for claims relative to medical record review. No\ndifferences in the ratio were found for TCD screening. Only\ning according to TCHP claims data. Only 8 of the 26 TCDs\nwere documented at TCH.\nIn addition to assessing the total encounters per unique\nmember, we also assessed the utilization patterns of frequent\nusers of medical services. For members (n = 17) who were\nidentified as having 3 or more ER visits, we compared the\noccurrences at TCH with other institutions. Two thirds\n(58/87) of ER visits occurred at TCH while the remainder\noccurred at outside institutions. For members (n = 7) with 3\nor more inpatient hospitalizations, approximately 70%\n(19/27) of their hospitalizations occurred at TCH.\nDiscussion\nOur pilot study provides novel data on the potential benefit\nof combining administrative claims data and medical record\nreview to assess health care use and fragmentations in care\namong children with SCD. This study demonstrates findings\nconsistent with past studies, documenting significant use of\nmedical care, inadequate access to hematology services, and\nunderutilization of TCD screening (Carroll, Haywood,\n4 SAGE Open\net al., 2009; Raphael, Shetty, Liu, Mahoney, & Mueller,\nshows that medical review, alone, conducted at one institu-\ntion, can quite dramatically undercount unique individuals\nand encounters. Chart review only showed benefit in the case\nof routine hematology visits where it picked up additional 2\nmembers (49  51) who had encounters. These claims were\npotentially missed due to inaccurate coding or errors in filing\nor reporting. To achieve the most complete picture of health\ncare utilization, claims data that cover an entire state or\nregion may offer the most accurate data source.\nThis work highlights potential fragmentations in care for\nchildren with SCD. For high-acuity care, TCHP members\nsought care at TCH and other health care institutions. While\nthese utilization patterns may have been driven by conve-\nnience and proximity to health care services, they nonethe-\nless raise concern about how children with SCD navigate the\nhealth care system. Receipt of care in multiple environments\ncan be problematic for children with SCD. They may be\ncared for by staff unfamiliar with their extensive histories\nand diverse needs or unfamiliar with SCD in general.\nPhysicians may inappropriately repeat tests and interven-\ntions. Such practices may have adverse consequences on\nindividual patient health and generate unnecessary health\ncare costs.\nThis pilot study had several methodological limitations.\nOnly medical records at TCH were reviewed. We did not\nhave access to records at other acute care institutions. This\nlimited our ability to verify and fully assess the nature of\nencounters at all sites of acute and hematology care. It also\nlimited our ability to determine the exact sickle cell pheno-\ntype for the majority of our sample. We also did not have\naccess to the visit policies of the individual PCPs. These\npolicies could encourage or discourage fragmentation. If the\nPCP advised patients in need of acute care to use geographi-\ncally convenient facilities or those more closely affiliated\nwith their practice, it would artificially appear that fragmen-\ntation of care was occurring. However, these policies may\nhave other benefits of convenience and proximity to PCPs\nand patients. In our study sample, 31% of children lived 20\nmiles or farther from TCH. Use of TCH may have been espe-\ncially difficult for these families.\nThis study demonstrates the benefits of administrative\nclaims data in documenting the health care utilization of chil-\ndren diagnosed with SCD. Administrative claims data pro-\nvides key insights into the scope of health service use,\nincluding how and where services are being used. This study\nalso highlights the limitations of sole reliance on medical\nrecord review. In the future, integration of chart review may\nhave a more central role (Pawlson et al., 2007). Historically,\nchart review has been limited by its resource and time inten-\nsive nature. However, with federal efforts to implement elec-\ntronic medical records across integrated health care systems,\nreview of medical records may be more of a viable option in\nthe future.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: This study was\nthe principal investigator.\nReferences\nAmendah, D.
