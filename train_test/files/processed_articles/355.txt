More-\nover, the percentage of deaths associated with HIV in-\nfection in this population had come to exceed those due\nto circulatory and hemorrhagic phenomena. Because of\nrecent developments in antiviral treatment for HIV in-\nfection, in prophylaxis and treatment of opportunistic in-\nfections, and in preparation of factor concentrates, we\nagain analyzed national mortality data to determine the\neffects of HIV infection and of changes in treatment\nmodalities on longevity and causes of death among per-\nsons with hemophilia A.\nIn the United States, every death must be reported to\nstate authorities on a prescribed form which includes\ndesignations for immediate, underlying, and contributory\ncauses of death.

The\nmost recent year for which multiple cause-of-death data\nare now available is 1998.

Age-adjusted\nrates were standardized by the direct method, using the\nyear for persons with hemophilia A was also determined.\nBecause of differences between ICD-8 and ICD-9 codes,\nall other analyses were restricted to death records using\ncalculated age-adjusted and age-specific risk ratios\n(RRs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using Pois-\nson regression analysis [21]. To examine age differences\nin death rates, we used 10-year age groups from 0 to 69\nyears of age and 70+ years. Median age at death in as-\nsociation with hemophilia A was determined for each\nThe ages at death for all persons with hemophilia A were\ncompared by time period using the Wilcoxon rank-sum\nTo examine racial differences and trends, we used race\ncategories as provided in the national mortality data:\nwhite, black, and other races, with the latter including\nAmerican Indian, Alaskan Native, Asian or Pacific Is-\nlander, and all other races.

Other studies have noted under-\nreporting of HIV infection or AIDS on death records,\npossibly due to improper completion of death records,\nreluctance to include HIV infection or AIDS on death\nrecords, inclusion of causes of death unrelated to HIV,\nincomplete recognition of underlying diseases [23,24], or\nvariations in terminology for certain disease categories\n[25]. To maximize identification of HIV-related death\nrecords, we aggregated disease categories based on mul-\ntiple causes of death listed on death records (Table I)\nWe also compared the characteristics of deceased per-\nsons with hemophilia A who did or did not have HIV-\nrelated disease listed on death records during 1995\nthrough 1998.

These increases were\nmost marked among those with HIV infection. In con-\nsignificantly in the 70+ age group and decreased signifi-\ncantly in all other age groups except 20\u00ad29. Among de-\ncedents with hemophilia A, those with HIV-related dis-\nease have been dying at significantly younger ages and\nthose without HIV-related disease dying at progressively\nolder ages. However, when we analyzed multiple-cause-\nof-death data rather than only immediate- or underlying-\ncause-of-death data, we noted a 41% decrease in hemo-\npart attributable to a decrease in deaths among persons\nwith hemophilia A who had HIV-related disease. Al-\nthough no data regarding the use of antiviral therapy are\navailable on death certificates, the decrease in deaths\namong persons with hemophilia A is consistent with ob-\nservations of overall decreasing deaths due to HIV in-\nplained by a reduction in the numbers of the U.S. popu-\nlation with hemophilia A, as such estimates were fairly\nconstant in the 3 years prior to this observed decrease\nLimitations of Death Data Analyses\nIn any study of mortality there are limitations of po-\ntential incorrect diagnoses or errors in death record\npreparation [29,30]. The numbers of HIV-related deaths\nindicated on death records likely represent conservative\nestimates, since possible HIV-related causes of death\nmay be listed on the death record without expressly iden-\ntifying HIV infection [8]. For example, in our study,\nthere were many deaths with nonspecific infectious pro-\ncesses commonly associated with HIV infection, such as\nsepticemia, listed as the cause of death. Of the 106 per-\nwith infections other than pneumocystosis or HIV listed\nas a cause of death and without HIV-related disease, 9\n(9%) had mycobacterial, mycotic, or other infections that\nare now commonly associated with HIV.

Unfortunately, one cannot assess the im-\npact of HIV infection by severity of hemophilia A using\nstandardized death records. However, it is likely that the\ngreatest impact of HIV infection has been on those with\nsevere hemophilia A, since this group would be the major\nusers of factor VIII concentrates compared to those with\nmild or moderate hemophilia A [8,32].\nContinuing Importance of Hemorrhagic\nPhenomena\nThe spread of HIV-1 infection in persons with hemo-\nphilia A in the United States has markedly altered mor-\ntality statistics for this population. In the 1960s and\n1970s, the introduction of factor replacement therapy, the\ndevelopment of comprehensive hemophilia treatment\ncenters, and the implementation of home care for this\npopulation decreased the number and proportion of\ndeaths due to hemorrhage [7], dramatically increasing\ntheir median age at death [33,34]. In this study, these\nperturbations are underscored by the disparity in the me-\nphilia A between those with HIV-related disease (33\nyears) and those without HIV-related disease (72 years).\nHowever, some of this disparity may reflect a greater\nrepresentation in the latter group of persons with milder\nbleeding disorders who thus had a lesser need for factor\nreplacement. Based on death certificate data, the median\nage at death for persons with hemophilia A without HIV\ninfection--72 years--now approximates the overall life\nexpectancy for U.S. males [35].\nIn the analyses presented here, it should be noted that\namong persons with hemophilia A without HIV-related\ndisease, hemorrhagic phenomena remain a leading cause\nof death. In our analyses, the incidence of hemorrhagic\nphenomena as a leading cause of death may be higher\nthan in other reported analyses because the analyses pre-\nsented here were not limited to immediate and/or under-\nlying causes of death but rather included all reported\ndiseases or conditions that contributed to death.\nDeaths Among Females\nobserved but was not associated with HIV infection. This\nincrease probably reflects the increasing recognition and\ndiagnosis of other causes of hemorrhagic phenomena as-\nsociated with lack of factor VIII activity, as in those with\nvariants of von Willebrand disease, carriers of hemo-\nphilia who have low levels of factor VIII, persons with\nFig. 5.

For practical\npurposes in the United States, HIV infection among he-\nabove age 15, HIV seroprevalence increases by age co-\nhort [41,42]. With increasing age at seroconversion, the\nincidence of AIDS-defining illnesses increases [43\u00ad45]\nand survival decreases [46,47], indicating a negative ef-\nfect of age on tolerance to HIV infection.\nImpact of Hepatitis\nThe spread of HIV-1 infection has diverted the atten-\ntion of clinicians from another pair of sequelae of hemo-\nphilia treatment, i.e., chronic hepatitis and progressive\nliver disease [48,49]. Most recipients of non-heat-treated\nplasma-derived factor concentrates have been infected\ninfected with HCV get chronic hepatitis, and many even-\ntually get cirrhosis [52]. Although HIV was eliminated in\nthe United States from clotting-factor concentrates by\n1985, inactivation processes and donor screening proce-\ndures were not sufficiently effective to eliminate the risk\nof HCV from blood products used by hemophilia patients\nuntil 1990. In the data presented here, the total number of\npersons with hemophilia A who had intrinsic liver dis-\nease listed as a cause of death increased 3-fold from\nuting to this increase also have HIV-related disease. This\nmay, in part, reflect the sequelae of exposures to HBV\nand HCV, as well as other non-A, non-B hepatitis agents\n[53,54]. Levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase and\nHCV RNA are much higher among multitransfused per-\nsons with hemophilia A who are HIV-positive than\namong those who are HIV-negative, suggesting that HIV\ninfection promotes increased HCV replication [55]. In\nthe analyses presented here, there was a significantly\ngreater incidence of non-A, non-B viral hepatitis among\nhemophilia A patients who had HIV-related disease com-\npared to those without HIV-related disease, although this\nmay reflect common sources of exposure for both HIV\nand HCV. Fortunately, the widespread use of human re-\ncombinant DNA-derived antihemophilic factor (factor\nVIII) in the treatment of hemophilia A has obviated much\nof the concerns of new hepatitis infections in current\ntreatment, as neither HBV nor HCV is present in recom-\nbinant products.\nAntivirals and Prophylaxis and Treatment of\nOpportunistic Infections\nTreatment with zidovudine (Retrovir, formerly azido-\nthymidine [AZT]) and prophylaxis against Pneumocystis\ncarinii pneumonia have been widely used for HIV-\ninfected populations in general, decreases since 1990\nhave been documented in the incidence of P. carinii\npneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex, cryptococ-\ncosis, herpes simplex disease, and toxoplasmosis, likely\nreflecting the increasing use of preventive therapy to re-\nduce the development of these opportunistic infections\n[57,58]. For several years, early treatment with antiret-\nroviral therapy [59\u00ad61] and prophylaxis against P. cari-\nnii pneumonia [62] have been known to prolong survival\nand the time until AIDS-defining illnesses develop. The\nclinical picture and subsequent survival of persons with\nrecent years with combination therapy using two, three,\nor more antiretrovirals (including other nucleoside ana-\nlog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) [65], protease\ninhibit the constitutive enzymes of HIV and slow or pre-\nCONCLUSION\nAs more cases of HIV infection are managed with\nrevised treatment guidelines that include the use of anti-\nretrovirals before AIDS-defining illnesses or other symp-\ntoms of HIV-infection develop [39], decreases in HIV-\nrelated deaths, such as the decreases presented here, will\nlikely continue [71]. Further gains in longevity can be\nanticipated from increased utilization of hemophilia\ntreatment centers, where there is growing expertise both\nin therapy for HIV infection and in treating and prevent-\ning the hemorrhagic phenomena of hemophilia [34].\n"
