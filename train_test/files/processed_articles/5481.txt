Areal conver-\ngence occurs when unisensory neurons from different modalities merely coexist within a brain region\nbut do not interact. Neuronal convergence occurs when unisensory neurons from two or more modali-\nties make synaptic contact onto recipient \"multisensory\" neurons. Multisensory integration occurs\nwhen the response of multisensory neurons to convergent unisensory input differs qualitatively and\nquantitatively from that elicited by the individual unisensory inputs alone (Calvert, 2001).\nThe redundant signals effect\nA well-known behavioral manifestation of facilitative multisensory integration is the decrease in\nresponse time (RT) to pairings of unisensory stimuli presented over multiple sensory channels, where\nRT to the multisensory combination is faster than to either unisensory signal alone. This enhancement in\nthe speed of processing has been termed the \"redundant signals effect,\" or RSE (Miller, 1982). The RSE\nis not an exclusively multisensory phenomenon because it also occurs when the redundant signals occur\nwithin a single sensory modality (Iacoboni & Zaidel, 2003; Miller, 1986; Miniussi, Girelli, & Marzi,\n2001; Supek et al., 1999), but this paradigm has been widely employed in multisensory research.\nThe roles of physical and physiological simultaneity in\naudiovisual multisensory facilitation\n*Corresponding author.\nMiller (1982) compared two models that could potentially account for the RSE: separate acti-\nvation or \"race\" models and neural coactivation models. Race models assume that each unisensory\n(redundant) signal is processed independently, such that on each trial the channel that processes the\nstimulus most quickly, and thus initiates the overt response, \"wins\" the race.According to race models,\nredundancy gains can result solely from statistical probability summation and no neural interaction\nbetween the activated sensory channels is required (although such interactions are not ruled out). In\ncontrast, neural coactivation models posit that signals from each unisensory channel interact in order\nto initiate the response. Coactivation across the two channels accumulates until a response criterion is\nreached, which can occur before the same criterion is reached by activation within either individual\nchannel.\nMiller (1982) derived a mathematical inequality describing the race model that specifies an upper\nlimit on the cumulative probability (CP) of obtaining speeded RT to redundant stimuli. Miller's ine-\nquality asserts that the CP of obtaining the fastest responses to redundant signals must be less than or\nequal to the CP of obtaining the fastest responses to individual stimuli. Specifically, the race model\nstates that for pairs of stimuli, i.e., auditory (A) and visual (V), at a given AV stimulus onset asyn-\nchrony (SOAAV\n), at a given response latency (t), that\n|A) 1 CP(RT  t|V), (1)\nwhere A is delayed relative to V, and\nCP(RT  t|AV)  CP(RT  t|A) 1 CP(RT  t2SOAAV\nwhere V is delayed relative to A. CP(RT  t|AV) is the CP of obtaining an RT faster than time (t)\nin response to the presentation of the A and V stimuli. This CP must be less than or equal to the\nsum of the CPs of obtaining RTs faster than time in response to the individual unisensory stimuli,\n|\nA) 1 CP(RT  T\n|\nV) or CP(RT  t\n|\n|\nV). Violations of\nMiller's inequality signify that probability summation cannot account for decreased RTs in response to\nredundant signals and implies that neural coactivation has occurred. The evidence that neural coactiva-\ntion is a causal mechanism for the AV RSE comes from numerous behavioral and electrophysiological\n& Mamassian, 2012, for a challenge to this standard interpretation).\nThe \"rules\" of multisensory integration: Spatial, temporal, and intensive\nUnisensory stimuli that are closely aligned in space (the \"spatial rule\") and time (the \"temporal rule\")\nare more likely to produce multisensory response facilitation than are stimuli that are temporally and/\nor spatially disparate, where the latter may even result in response suppression (Holmes & Spence,\nfacilitation may be especially robust for weak (i.e. near threshold) unisensory stimuli (the \"inverse\neffectiveness rule\"). Inverse effectiveness is most conspicuous in the responses of multisensory neu-\nrons in the superior colliculus (Meredith & Stein, 1986).\nThe inverse effectiveness rule\nResults from both behavioral and electrophysiological studies have been interpreted to support the\ninverse effectiveness rule (Callan, Callan, Kroos, & Vatikiotis-Bateson, 2001; Diederich & Colonius,\nSerino, Farn\u00e8, Rinaldesi, Haggard, & L\u00e0davas, 2007; Senkowski, Saint-Amour, H\u00f6fle, & Foxe, 2011).\nThe generality of the inverse effectiveness rule has recently been questioned on the grounds that pre-\nvious studies sampled an insufficient or incorrect range of stimulus intensities to critically test this\n& Foxe, 2007). Studies employing a range of stimulus intensities, whose results have been described\nas \"generally consistent\" with the inverse effectiveness rule (Lakatos et al., 2007), report maximal\nmultisensory facilitation at intermediate (not the lowest) levels of stimulus intensity. Other studies\n(Senkowski et al., 2011), while testing a wide range of stimulus intensities, may still not have sampled\nat the lowest end of the perceptible intensity continuum.\nSimultaneity in multisensory facilitation 215\nThe temporal rule: Physiological simultaneity\nStimuli are intrinsically processed at different rates by different sensory modalities. For example,\nhuman auditory evoked cortical potentials onset as early as 10 ms (Celesia & Puletti, 1971) whereas the\nC1 component of the visual evoked potential, which reflects activity in early retinotopically mapped\nferences between sensory channels due to intrinsic factors such as unequal pathway length, dissimilar\naxonal conduction velocity and/or variations in synaptic complexity, there is the variable influence\nof stimulus intensity. Simple RT is inversely related to stimulus intensity, a phenomenon known as\nPi\u00e9ron's law (Jas\nintensity-dependent variations in the latency of neural activity occur in the primate visual system\n(Barlow, Snodderly, & Swadlow, 1978; Maunsell et al., 1999) and in the auditory system of both cat\nThere is general agreement that multisensory facilitation requires that the neural activity evoked\nby unisensory stimuli converge synchronously onto multisensory coincidence detectors--that is, that\nthe unisensory inputs must exhibit physiological simultaneity (Hershenson, 1962; Miller, 1986; Raab,\n1962). A direct example is that multisensory neurons in the cat's superior colliculus exhibit optimal\nmultisensory integration when the activity elicited by unisensory stimulation occurs at roughly the\nsame post-stimulus latency (Stein & Meredith, 1993). Likewise, human behavioral data indirectly sug-\ngest that multisensory facilitation of simple RT occurs at stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) corre-\nsponding to the difference in simple RT to the unisensory stimuli, where this RT difference is presumed\nto reflect the difference in intrinsic processing speed (Diederich & Colonius, 2004; Hershenson, 1962;\nMiller, 1986). If optimal multisensory facilitation requires the synchronous convergence of unisensory\nsignals onto a multisensory coincidence detector, and if the post-stimulus latency of evoked activity\ndepends on stimulus intensity, then changes in the relative intensities of the component unisensory\nvisual and auditory stimuli should cause systematic changes in the SOAAV\nat which optimal multisen-\nsory facilitation (neural coactivation) occurs.\nThe present experiment\nWe measure how the optimal SOAAV\nfor multisensory integration (as indexed by violations of the race\nmodel) depends on both absolute and relative unisensory stimulus intensities. An evaluation of the\ndependence of optimal SOAAV\non absolute stimulus intensity addresses the validity and generality of\nthe inverse effectiveness rule, while its dependence on relative stimulus intensity tests the predictions\nof the strong version of the physiological simultaneity hypothesis.\nCondition 1 measured the range of SOAAV\nover which neural coactivation occurs for two relatively\nweak unisensory stimuli.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants (n 5 4; two male; mean age 5 31 years) possessed normal (or corrected to normal) vision\nand normal hearing. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the\nWorld Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans. Prior to their\nparticipation in the study, all participants provided written informed consent. All procedures were\napproved by the institutional review board of North Dakota State University.\nStimuli and apparatus\nVisual stimuli were circular Gabor patches which, when viewed from 114 cm, possessed a spatial\nfrequency of 1 cycles/degree and a Gaussian envelope with a standard deviation of 1\u00b0. Gabor patches\nwere centered at 2.25\u00b0 eccentricity from fixation in the upper left visual quadrant (Figure 1). Stimuli\nwere presented on a CRT (mean luminance 5 60 cd/m2; monitor refresh rate 5 100 Hz). Gabor\ncontrast for individual participants ranged between 1% and 4% across all conditions (see individual\nconditions for details). For condition 1, Gabor contrast ranged from 1.0% to 1.7%. Visual stimulus\nThe auditory stimulus was a 1-KHz pure tone of variable loudness (range 5 31.1\u00ad49.0 dBA\n) pre-\nsented via a speaker approximately co-located with the visual stimuli. Auditory stimulus duration was\nProcedure\n2.1.3.1 Pretest. Prior to the experiment, all participants completed a pretest designed to equate\nthe detectability of the unisensory stimuli. The pretest paradigm was a single-interval go/no-go signal\ndetection task. Participants responded via button press as quickly and accurately as possible to the\ndetection of any A or V stimulus. Participants performed 15 blocks of trials for a total of 30 trials per\nstimulus condition. Each block consisted of a total of 50 trials: 24 unisensory A stimuli (2  12 levels\nof dB attenuation), 24 unisensory V stimuli (2  12 contrasts), and 2 catch (no-signal) trials.\nSensitivity (d) was calculated according to the equation d 5 ZH\n, where ZH\ndenotes the\nZ-transformed hit rate (hits/signal trials) and ZFA\ndenotes the Z-transformed false-alarm rate (false\nalarms/no-signal trials). Nonlinear least-squares regression to a logistic function interpolated stimulus\nintensities yielding criterion performance (d  2).\n2.1.3.2 Experiment. A single-interval go/no-go signal detection task was employed. Trials\ncommenced with the appearance of a fixation cross. After a variable interval (1,000\u00ad2,000 ms), the\nfirst stimulus (S1) was presented. The second stimulus (S2) was presented following a variable SOA.\nParticipants responded via button press as quickly and accurately as possible to the detection of any\nstimulus. RT was recorded to the nearest millisecond. Trials terminated after subject response or after\n1,500 ms. Figure 2 illustrates the sequence of events in multisensory trials.\nParticipants completed a total of 34 blocks of 75 trials each, for a grand total of 2,550 trials. Each\nblock included 9 V trials, 9 A trials, 9 no-stimulus catch trials, and 3 AV trials at each of 16 SOAs\nranging (in 20-ms increments) from 2100 ms (AV) to 200 ms (VA). Each subject's RT distribu-\ntion was trimmed to exclude outliers (e.g., 100 ms  RT  1,000 ms). The trimmed RT distributions\npossessed nearly equal numbers of trials contributed by each subject and subsequent analyses in all\nexperimental conditions were conducted on RT distributions pooled across participants.\nThe intensities of the unisensory stimuli were adjusted (as necessary) after every 18 trials to ensure\na mean sensitivity of d  2, which corresponds to an 87% correct response rate in a two-alternative\nforced-choice task, where 75% correct is typically taken as threshold performance. Thus, stimuli in con-\ndition 1 were sufficiently strong that participants could reliably detect them, while sufficiently weak that\nperformance in this condition could be meaningfully contrasted to that observed in subsequent experi-\nmental conditions where stimuli were highly suprathreshold (d  4; 99.9% correct response rate).\nFigure 1. Visual stimuli were circular Gabor patches (1%\u00ad4% contrast) which possessed a spatial frequency of\n1 cycle/degree and a Gaussian envelope with a standard deviation of 1\u00b0. Gabor patches were centered at 2.25\u00b0\neccentricity from fixation (cross) in the upper left visual quadrant. Scale bar 5 1\u00b0.\nSimultaneity in multisensory facilitation 217\nData analysis\n2.1.4.1 Multisensory response facilitation/inhibition. To test whether RTs to multisensory stimuli\nwere significantly faster (or slower) than RTs to unisensory stimuli, mean RT in all 16 SOAAV\nconditions\nwas compared with the fastest (and slowest) mean unisensory RTs (A or V) using independent samples\nt-tests.\n2.1.4.2 Multisensory sensitivity enhancement. Mean sensitivity (d) at each SOAAV\nwas\ncalculated using a bootstrapping procedure (Foster & Bischof, 1991). Response distributions for each\nSOAAV\ncondition (hits) were combined with an equal size sample taken at random from the no-signal\ncondition (false alarms). The distribution of hits and false alarms was exhaustively sampled (with\nreplacement, 1,000 iterations) to generate sampling distributions of d from which means and standard\nerrors were obtained.\n2.1.4.3 Neural coactivation (Miller's inequality analysis). RT data were trimmed (100 ms  RT\n 1,000 ms) and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) were created for each stimulus condition\n(A, V, AV). Sampling distributions were bootstrapped by exhaustively resampling each CDF (with\nreplacement, 1,000 iterations). A sampling distribution of Miller's inequality values was generated\nby subtracting the multisensory CDF predicted by probability summation, AVP\nCDF observed for each multisensory condition at each iteration such that MIf\n,where MIf\nindicates facilitative MI. This process yielded a mean value (and standard error) of Miller's inequality\nfor each SOAAV\n.

While possessing equally\ndetectable stimulus intensities (d  2), mean RT to the unisensory A stimulus was nevertheless faster\n(424.6 ms) than to the unisensory V stimulus (431.9 ms). This difference in RT did not reach sig-\ncortical responses (Celesia & Puletti, 1971; Jeffreys & Axford, 1972). To assess whether multisensory\nstimulation produced response facilitation, mean RT in each AV condition was compared with that in\nthe fastest unisensory condition (A).

As in condition 1, significant violations of Miller's inequality occurred for phys-\nically simultaneous A and V stimuli, as well as at an SOAAV\nof 20 ms. At an SOAAV\nof 0 ms (Figure 6c),\nviolations occurred for physically simultaneous stimuli across a range of RT (217\u00ad290 ms), with a\npeak at 244 ms. The fact that the greatest violations of Miller's inequality occur when unisensory\nstimuli are physically simultaneous is clearly incompatible with the strong version of the physiologi-\ncal simultaneity hypothesis, which posits that neural coactivation should occur at an SOA that closely\ncorresponds to the difference in mean RT to the unisensory stimuli. The results of condition 2 also\nclearly show that neural coactivation can occur when a more rapidly processed stimulus (V) precedes\na more slowly processed stimulus (A). The results of condition 2 are also inconsistent with the inverse\neffectiveness rule, because increasing the intensity of the V stimulus actually increased the magnitude\nCondition 3 is complimentary to condition 2 and was designed to reveal how changing the intensity of\nthe A stimulus might influence its integration with a relatively weak V stimulus. Specifically, we tested\nwhether increasing the intensity (loudness) of the A stimulus caused a change in the optimal SOAAV\nfor\nmultisensory integration relative to condition 1. Again, if physiological simultaneity is necessary for\nmultisensory facilitation, then increasing the intensity of the A stimulus (which will increase the speed\nof auditory processing and reduce mean RT to A stimuli) should shift the optimal SOAAV\nfor neural\ncoactivation to more positive values such that, relative to condition 1, the V stimulus would need to\nbe presented earlier with respect to the A stimulus. Conversely, the optimal SOAAV\nwill not change if\nphysical simultaneity determines multisensory integration.\nMethod\nThe participants in condition 3 were the same as in conditions 1 and 2.

Panel (c) plots the\nmean value (thick line) and 95% confidence intervals (thin lines) for Miller's inequality as a function of RT\nfor simultaneous SOAAV\n. Panel (c) shows the CP distributions for the two unisensory conditions (A: purple; V:\nblue) and their sum (A + V: black), which is the CP distribution predicted by the race model. The CP distribution\nobserved for AV stimulation at an SOAAV\nof 0 ms (AVo\n) is shown in red.

These violations are represented by the segment of the AVo\nCP distribution that lies above\nthe (A 1 V) CP distribution in Figure 8(c). Miller's inequality is plotted (thick line) as a function of\nRT (from 150 to 350 ms) in Figure 8(d). Confidence intervals were derived by a bootstrapping proce-\ndure (Foster & Bischof, 1991) where the AVo\nand A 1 V CP distributions were sampled exhaustively\nwith replacement to generate a sampling distribution of Miller's inequality (N 5 1,000). Thin lines in\nFigures 5\u00ad7(c) and 8(d) plot 95% confidence intervals for the value of Miller's inequality.\n6 General discussion\nTaken together, the results of the four experimental conditions reveal that audiovisual multisensory\nfacilitation, as indexed by significant violations of the race model, occurs only over a narrow range of\nstimulus onset asynchronies which invariably includes physical simultaneity. Manipulations of stimu-\nlus intensity that changed the speed of unisensory processing, as revealed by significant alterations\nof mean RT, had no influence on the range of SOAAV\nover which multisensory interaction occurred.\nMoreover, when the range of SOAAV\nover which significant violations of the race model occurred did\n220 ms), the extension was such that the more rapidly processed stimulus needed to precede the more\nslowly processed stimulus, a result that is, in fact, opposite to the strong version of the physiological\nsimultaneity hypothesis (Hershenson, 1962), which predicts that the more slowly processed stimulus\nshould need a \"head start\" in order to arrive at some central site simultaneously with a more rapidly\nprocessed stimulus. It should be noted that violations of Miller's inequality at all non-zero SOAs were\nsmaller than those at simultaneity. Finally, there was a surprising lack of evidence for multisensory\nfacilitation with respect to sensitivity (d).\nInverse effectiveness\nAlthough the rule of inverse effectiveness has sometimes been upheld as a universally observed char-\nacteristic of multisensory integration (Lakatos et al., 2007; Meredith & Stein, 1986), a number of\nstudies have reported findings that are inconsistent with this rule (Lakatos et al., 2007; Ross et al.,\n2007). Our results likewise do not support the inverse effectiveness rule because the magnitude of the\nviolations of Miller's inequality we observed generally increased with increasing stimulus intensity\nare, however, consistent with a reinterpretation (Holmes, 2007) of the results of Alvarado, Vaughan,\nStanford, and Stein (2007), who showed that whereas multisensory enhancement in neurons in the\ncat's superior colliculus obeyed the rule of inverse effectiveness when analyzed in terms of relative\nspike rate increase, they demonstrated the behavior we observe, viz., increasing effectiveness with\nincreasing stimulus intensity, when analyzed in terms of absolute spike rates. On the contrary, the\nrange of SOAAV\nover which statistically significant decreases in simple mean RT occur is wider for the\nweakest stimuli (condition 1) than for the other conditions (Figure 3), but increases in the time window\nof integration is not what is typically meant by inverse effectiveness.\nIntensity-adjusted latency coding\nAlthough physiological activity resulting from two unisensory signals must simultaneously converge\non a multisensory \"coincidence detector\" for facilitative MI to occur, we find that such facilitation\noccurs nearly exclusively for physically simultaneous multisensory occurrences, independent of fac-\ntors that differentially affect unisensory processing time, such as stimulus intensity. This makes sense\nfrom an ecological perspective, for if multisensory facilitation has aided survival, the advantage it\nconfers must be the enhanced processing of genuine physical events (e.g., the sights and sounds of\npredators or prey which, because they have a common cause, are physically simultaneous), not merely\nto physiological simultaneities some (potentially large) fraction of which are accidental. Although\nthe evolutionary advantage of this result is undeniable, the mechanism whereby it is accomplished is\nunclear.\nConsider the case in which facilitative MI occurs at a coincidence detector where the response\nlatencies for a given pair of simultaneously presented unisensory stimuli are exactly equal. Varying\nthe relative intensities (and hence the processing speed) of the physically simultaneous unisensory\nstimuli will cause their physiological responses to convergence at this detector asynchronously, and\nyet we find that physically simultaneous stimuli integrate despite variations in intensity. Conversely,\nthe physically asynchronous occurrence of two unisensory stimuli can, depending on their relative\nintensity, result in spuriously coincident physiological responses that nevertheless fail to result in\nSimultaneity in multisensory facilitation 225\nfacilitation. This suggests that the time of arrival at multisensory sites must be corrected for latency\ndifferences caused by adventitious variations in stimulus intensity. In other words, the system must\n\"take account\" of differences in physiological response latency that are unrelated to true unisensory\nSOA in order to reject false correspondences. It is well known that neural networks can undergo Heb-\nbian learning, wherein the strength of synaptic connections is modified based on experience. The bio-\nphysical bases of temporal coincidence detection could involve mechanisms of spike-time dependent\nsynaptic plasticity (Song, Miller, & Abbott, 2000) and/or synaptic scaling (Turrigiano, Leslie, Desai,\nRutherford, & Nelson, 1998). Our novel idea that synapses might additionally be \"tuned\" to particular\nstimulus intensities is purely speculative. In short, however, physiological response simultaneity is a\nnecessary but not sufficient condition for facilitative MI.\nOne possible mechanism for achieving this outcome is shown in Figure 9. Assume a neural net-\nwork of AV coincidence detectors (labeled 1\u00ad5 in Figure 9) which integrate unisensory inputs (i.e.,\nfire) exclusively when A and V inputs arrive synchronously, thus reflecting the necessary condition of\nphysiological simultaneity. The coincidence detectors receive input from both A and V sensory recep-\ntors via delay lines and are thus place coded (Jeffress, 1948). A given afferent A or V signal ultimately\nsupplies input to the entire network of coincidence detectors at a continuum of latencies. In Jeffress'\n(1948) theory of binaural sound localization, differences in the time of arrival of sound at the two\nears (the interaural time difference) result in physiological convergence that varies in location within\nthe network of coincidence detectors such that the spatial location of the sound source is read out by\nthe relative spatial location of the activated coincidence detector. This explanation can be adapted to\nexplain our results.\nWe begin by assuming that organisms have ubiquitous access to the physiological activity gener-\nated by genuinely simultaneous multisensory events in their environment, that is, that they have access\nto ground truth. Thus, over the course of their development organisms will accrue robust Bayesian\npriors with respect to multisensory convergence. The class of multisensory stimulation for which exact\nlatency/intensity information is known results from self-generated events. For example, tapping an\nobject with the hand (or a tool), or throwing a projectile whose impact with a nearby surface produces\nboth visual and auditory consequences, etc., produces afferent visual, auditory, and haptic/kinesthetic\nsignals of known common origin. Because these signals routinely vary in intensity, the latencies at\nFigure 9. An illustration of how learned associations (Bayesian priors) between physical simultaneity and relative\nstimulus intensity might be represented in a place-coded delay line network of coincidence detectors. Panels (a\u00adc)\nrefer to situations where physically simultaneous A and V events vary in relative intensity. In panel (a), the A and\nV inputs are of nominally equivalent relative intensity (denoted by the similar size of the delay lines, lettering,\nand the circular input and synaptic symbols), and the afferent signals (coded red) converge synchronously on and\nactivate coincidence detector 3 (red). In panels (b) and (c), simultaneous A and V events vary in intensity. The\nmore intense stimulus (thick line) propagates through the network more rapidly than the less intense stimulus\n(thin line), and their signals thus converge on coincidence detectors 1 or 5. Panel (d) illustrates two inputs of\nnominal equivalent intensity where the visual stimulus is delayed in time of onset relative to the auditory stimulus\n(represented here as added pathway length).\nA\nV\nA\nV\nA\nV\nA\nV\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nTime delay\nwhich these signals converge at multisensory coincidence detectors can, over repeated stimulation,\nresult in the accumulation of intensity-adjusted probability distributions that form the basis for com-\nputing the posterior probability that any set of incoming multisensory signals have a common origin.\nOne way in which the Bayesian priors could be instantiated in a delay-line network is illustrated\nin Figure 9.\nFigures 9(a\u00adc) refer to situations where physically simultaneous A and V events vary in relative\nintensity. In Figure 9(a), the A and V inputs are of nominally equivalent relative intensity (denoted\nby the similar size of the delay lines, lettering, and the circular input and synaptic symbols), and the\nafferent signals (coded red) converge synchronously on and activate coincidence detector 3 (red). No\nother coincidence detector receives simultaneous input. Figures 9(b) and (c) describe situations where\nsimultaneousAand V events vary in intensity. The more intense stimuli (thick lines) propagate through\nthe network more rapidly than the less intense stimuli (thin lines), and their signals thus converge on\ncoincidence detector 1 or 5. Because we are assuming that in each case the physical origin of the\nafferent signals is known to have been common, physical stimulus synchrony can be disambiguated\nand correctly read out by the network only if the coincidence detectors are trained (learn) to fire when\nthe constituent inputs possess the appropriate relative intensities. Thus, in Figure 9(d), two inputs of\nnominal equivalent intensity are illustrated where the visual stimulus is delayed in time of onset rela-\ntive to the auditory stimulus (represented here as added pathway length). Being of nominal equivalent\nintensity, the two signals propagate through the network at similar speeds and converge on coincidence\ndetector 4. However, because this coincidence detector has \"learned\" that physically simultaneous A\nand V events only converge at its location when they possess unequal intensities (intensity tuning is\nindicated by the sizes of the circular synaptic contacts), it rejects this physiological simultaneity as\nspurious and does not integrate.
