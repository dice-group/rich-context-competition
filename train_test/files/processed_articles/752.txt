The effects of proinflammatory cytokines on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal\n(HPA) axis lead to the hypothesis that allergic reactions, as markers for inflammation-associated activation of\nthe HPA axis, result in aberrant responses to subsequent stressors. Data from 6,836 US adults 20-39 years old\nfrom the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) were used. Subjects responded\nto questions regarding low-back pain in the past 12 months and history of asthma, hay fever, and other allergies.\nThe history and onset of major depression were obtained from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Logistic\nregression modeling was used to estimate the associations between allergies and depression and low-back\npain. Subjects with a history of any allergy were more likely to report low-back pain (odds ratio = 1.51; 95%\ninterval: 1.13, 2.21), and much more likely to have both major depression and low-back pain (odds ratio = 3.03;\n95% confidence interval: 1.32, 6.92).

IL-lp is the principal component\nin the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal\n(HPA) axis during immune responses and inflamma-\ntory reactions (18).

Mechanical or psychologic stress also causes\nthe release of corticotropin-releasing hormone and\nsensitizes the pituitary gland to release adrenocorti-\ncotropin hormone in response to IL-lp, which may\nresult in an exaggerated glucocorticoid response (19).\nHypercortisolemia may be an important factor con-\ntributing to the onset or maintenance of depression\n(20). Hypersecretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone\nhas been shown to cause long-term physiologic and\nbehavioral changes, including aberrant responses to\nacute stimuli (21), changes in brain IL-ip expression,\nand excessive IL-ip production from macrophages\n(22). IL-lp stimulates the production and release of\nsubstance P in sympathetic neurons (23) and has been\nshown to be correlated with fear reactions (24) and\nDepression and pain may be independent effects of\nabnormal responses to mechanical or psychologic\nstress resulting from alterations in the HPA axis caused\nby early exposure to IL-ip. IL-ip exposure early in\nlife has been shown to have long-lasting effects on the\nHPA axis of mice (26), and the HPA axes of rats\nexposed to IL-lp as adults show hyperactive responses\nto subsequent IL-lp exposure (27). Since allergy suf-\nferers secrete proinflammatory cytokines, including\nIL-ip, in much greater quantities than do nonsufferers\n(28), we propose that allergic reactions, as markers for\ninflammation-associated activation of the HPA axis,\ninduce changes in the HPA axis resulting in hyper-\nactive responses to subsequent mechanical or psycho-\nsocial stressors. We hypothesize that major depression\nand low-back pain are two outcomes affected by the\nabnormal responses to these stressors.\nThe objective of this study is to estimate the associ-\nations between allergic conditions, including asthma,\nhay fever, and allergic reactions, and recent major\ndepression and low-back pain in a representative sam-\nple of adults 20-39 years old in the  .\nData source and subject selection\nWe used data from the Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES m), which\nwas conducted by the National Center for Health\nbased on a complex sample design with oversampling\nof certain groups (31).

The history\nand current status of asthma and hay fever were\nassessed by asking each subject, \"Has a doctor ever\ntold you that you had asthma?\" and \"Has a doctor\never told you that you had hay fever?\" Subjects\nresponding affirmatively to either of these questions\nwere then asked, \"Do you still have asthma (or hay\nfever)?\" and \"How old were you when you were first\ntold you had asthma (or hay fever)?\" Four additional\nquestions addressed histories of allergic reactions. AH\nsubjects were asked, \"Within an hour after receiving\nallergy shots or allergy tests, have you ever had a\nsevere reaction, such as itching all over, trouble\nbreathing, flushing, hives, or swelling of the face or\nhands or feet?\" and \"Have you ever given up or had\nto avoid a pet because of allergies?\" Respondents\never had a severe reaction, such as itching all over,\ntrouble breathing, flushing, hives, or swelling of the\nface or hands or feet within an hour after being stung\nby an insect?\" Respondents from Phase 2\nsevere allergic reactions occurring within an hour\nafter eating something.\nOutcome variables\nA lifetime history of major depression and a history\nof depression in the past 12 months were obtained\nfrom the Diagnostic Interview Schedule, which was\nto complete the depression-related sections of the\nDiagnostic Interview Schedule. The diagnosis of\nmajor depression was based on criteria A and B of the\ndefinition of a major depressive episode from the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders (33). Criterion A is \"dysphoric mood or loss\nof interest or pleasure in all or almost all usual activi-\nties and pastimes\"; criterion B calls for the presence of\nat least four of the following eight symptoms during a\ndepressive episode: 1) appetite or weight change; 2)\ninsomnia or hypersomnia; 3) loss of energy, fatigue; 4)\nagitation or retardation; 5) loss of interest in sex; 6)\nfeeling worthless or guilty; 7) trouble thinking, con-\ncentrating; and 8) thoughts of death or suicide.\nDepressive subjects were asked the age at which then-\nfirst and last major depressive episodes occurred.\nRespondents 20 years old or older were asked to\nrespond to questions regarding back pain. They were\nasked if they ever had pain in their back on most days\nfor at least 1 month, have they had this pain within the\npast 12 months, and in what part of the back the pain\nis usually located.

Weighted\npolytomous logistic regression was used to estimate\nassociations between allergies and the combination of\nmajor depression and low-back pain. Subjects were\ncategorized into four outcome groups: neither major\ndepression nor low-back pain (treated as the \"reference\ngroup\"), major depression alone, low-back pain alone,\nand both major depression and low-back pain. The\nfinal weights, which were scaled down so that the sum\nof the weights was equal to the unweighted sample\nsize (n = 6,836), were used for all analyses.

The current study, to our knowledge, is the first\nto report such findings. The consistency of the associ-\nations across both long-term allergic conditions and\nshort-term allergic reactions, as well as the finding of\nassociations for currently asymptomatic asthmatics\nand hay fever sufferers, suggests that factors related to\nthe hypersensitivity reactions themselves, rather than\nthe clinical allergic conditions, are responsible for the\npain or depression. Although we found moderate asso-\nciations between allergies and depression and low-back\npain and stronger associations between allergies and\nboth depression and low-back pain, consistent with a\ncommon underlying mechanism, the NHANES III\ndata do not allow for the identification of the specific\nbiochemical and behavioral pathways Unking hyper-\nsensitivity reactions with pain and depression.\nThe likely mechanism involves one or more prod-\nucts associated with the inflammatory response and\ntheir actions, either directly or indirectly through other\nmediators, on the central nervous system.

Alternatively, allergic reactions\nmay be markers for prenatal or early childhood stress-\ninduced IL-ip secretion and consequent HPA-axis\ndysregulation (26). Schmidt et al. hypothesize that\n\"inflammation-associated acute activation of the HPA\naxis may induce delayed and long-lasting changes in\nthe HPA axis that serve to remodel the immune\nIL-lp and other cytokines contribute in inducing the\nhypothalamus to secrete corticotropin-releasing hor-\nmone. In addition to causing the release of adrenocor-\nticotropin hormone and (3-endorphin from the pituitary\ngland, corticotropin-releasing hormone also activates\nthe locus ceruleus-norepinephrine system, which leads\nto catecholamine secretion and further activation of the\nhypothalamus to release corticotropin-releasing hormone.\nAberrant elevation of HPA-axis responsiveness and\naltered serotonin responses during acute stress have\nbeen shown to follow corticotropin-releasing hormone\nhypersecretion (21). Increases in corticotropin-releasing\nhormone have been associated with behavioral adapta-\ntions, including depression, which may then continue to\nactivate the hypothalamus and consequent corti-\ncotropin-releasing hormone release (36). The natural\nhistories of low-back pain and major depression may be\nexplained, at least in part, by alterations in HPA-axis\nfunction through the action of cytokines and/or other\nimmune factors.

This interpretation is supported\nby recent findings of strong cross-sectional and\nprospective associations between allergic disorders\nand depression and physical illness (42).\nLimitations of our study include the cross-sectional\ndesign, reliance on self-reports for allergy and\nlow-back-pain data, no information regarding the\nclinical nature and severity of the low-back pain, no\nvalidation of Diagnostic Interview Schedule-based\nmajor depression, and temporal ambiguity between\nallergic reactions and the onset of depression and\nlow-back pain. Subjects with depression or low-back\npain may have inaccurately recalled having asthma or\nhay fever, or they may have exaggerated the severity\nof allergic reactions compared with those without\nlow-back pain or depression, resulting in possible\nbias due to differential misclassification. These\nrespondents may have also been more likely to have\nsought care for prior allergies and, thus, more likely\nto have been diagnosed with asthma or hay fever.\nAlthough the potential for bias in this study cannot be\nruled out, the consistency of the associations for\nmany types of allergies and allergic reactions, the\nobservation of associations for both current and past\nasthma and hay fever sufferers, and the finding that\nasthma and hay fever preceded the first lifetime\nmajor depressive episode in almost 80 percent of sub-\njects afflicted with allergies and recent depression\nprovide some assurance that misclassification and\nother biases are probably not responsible for the\nobserved associations.

If the findings from this study\nare replicated and the effects of IL-ip on the HPA axis\nare confirmed in other studies, investigators must\ndetermine if the HPA-axis responses can be attenuated\nthrough behavioral, drug, or other interventions. The\neffects of coping strategies and other psychosocial pre-\ndictors on pain chronicity, recurrence, and depression,\nand their relationship to IL-ip and other biochemical\nfactors, should be addressed in large, long-term\nprospective population-based studies.\nREFERENCES\n1.
