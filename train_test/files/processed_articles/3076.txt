To test this hypothesis, we\nevaluatedtheindependentrelationships\nof ethnicity and SES with 6 primary\nCVD risk factors: systolic blood pres-\nsure, cigarette smoking, body mass in-\ndex (BMI), physical inactivity, non\u00ad\nhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol\n(non\u00adHDL-C), and non\u00adinsulin-depen-\ndent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM, chosen\nbecause of its relationship to lifestyle\nfactors and its disproportionately high\nrates in ethnic minority groups).12 We\nAmerican, and white women from the\nThird National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III).\nWealsoaddressed2importantmeasure-\nment and analytic issues that contribute\nto understanding ethnic differences in\nCVD. First, we examined whether 2 in-\ndicators of SES, educational attainment\n(an individual-level marker of SES) and\npoverty-income ratio (a family-level\nmarker), produced similar findings. Sec-\nond, we examined whether 2 analytic\nprocedures, a multivariate linear model\nand a matched-pairs analysis, produced\nsimilar findings.\nMETHODS\nNHANES III, conducted by the Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics, Hy-\nattsville, Md, assessed the health and nu-\ntritionofthecivilian,noninstitutionalized\npopulation of the United States.\nNHANES III used the same stratified,\nmultistage probability design used by\nconducted in two 3-year phases.

We used the lower\nage cut point of 25 years to ensure that\nmost individuals had completed their\nhighest level of education (our primary\nindicator of SES) and the upper age cut\npoint of 64 years to avoid problems of se-\nlection effects due to non\u00adCVD-caused\nmorbidity and mortality.51 We excluded\ndata for women who were pregnant\n(n = 168), women from other ethnic\ngroups (n = 262), women whose surveys\nwere coded as unreliable (n = 8), and\nwomen who completed the home ques-\ntionnaire but not the medical examina-\npleted only the home questionnaire were\nboththehomequestionnaireandmedical\nyears, respectively), years of education\nand country of birth (86% vs 84% born in\nthe United States, respectively).\nDefinition of Variables\nRespondents to NHANES III were\nasked to classify their race or ethnicity\nas black; Mexican or Mexican American;\nwhite; Asian or Pacific Islander; Aleut,\nEskimo, or American Indian; or other\nLatin American or other Spanish. Wom-\nen who chose 1 of the first 3 categories\nwere included in our analyses.\nThe NHANES III data included sev-\neral individual-level and family-level in-\ndicatorsofSES.Weusededucationalat-\ntainment as our primary indicator of\nSES because education level, unlike in-\ncome level and occupation, is available\nregardlessofemploymentstatus,amore\nconstant measure of lifelong SES, and\nnot affected by the CVD outcomes we\nthehighestgradeoryearofregularpub-\nlic or private school that they had com-\npleted. Poverty-income ratio, our sec-\nondary indicator of SES, is calculated\nfromfamilyincomeandfamilysizeandis\nbased on US Bureau of the Census\ntables. Years of education and poverty-\nincome ratio were moderately corre-\ntent with previous research.53\nWe used the following 6 CVD risk fac-\ntors as outcome variables: (1) Systolic\nbloodpressure,measuredinmillimeters\nof mercury. We report the mean of the\nsecondandthirdof3readings,measured\non the right arm by a physician while the\nparticipant was seated during the medi-\ncal examination. (2) Current cigarette\nsmoking status. Participants reported\nwhether they had smoked at least 100\ncigarettes during their lifetimes and\nwhether they were currently smoking\ncigarettes. We used serum cotinine lev-\nable in phase I participants to validate\nself-reported smoking status. (3) Body\nmass index, a measure of weight in kilo-\ngrams divided by the square of height in\nmeters. The calculations provide a mea-\nsure of relative weight. (4) Leisure-time\nactivity. Questions on leisure-time\nphysical activity were adapted from the\nvey,50 which asked participants whether\nthey had engaged in any leisure-time\nphysical activity in the past month, in-\ncluding exercises, sports, or physically\nactive hobbies. Women who reported no\nleisure-time activities were considered\nphysically inactive. (5) Non\u00adhigh-den-\nsitylipoproteincholesterol,measuredin\nmillimoles per liter (milligrams per de-\nciliter). Measurements were taken from\nserumspecimens,analyzedbystandard-\nized protocols, and calculated as the dif-\nference between total cholesterol and\nHDL-C.55 Non\u00adhigh-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol, which may be a better indi-\ncatorofatherogeniclipoproteinparticles\nthan indirectly estimated low-density li-\npoprotein cholesterol,55 does not require\nfasting blood samples, and therefore, al-\nlowed the use of the entire NHANES\nIII sample. (6) Non\u00adinsulin-dependent\ndiabetes mellitus. Fasting plasma glu-\ncose levels, available on the entire\nNHANES III sample, were determined\nusing a microadaptation of the national\nglucose oxidase reference method.56\nWomen were classified as having\nNIDDM if they fasted for 8 or more\nhours and had plasma glucose levels of\npoint based on the new diagnostic crite-\nria for epidemiological studies by the\nAmerican Diabetes Association)57 or if\nthey reported a medical history of dia-\nbetes (other than during pregnancy)\nwith an age of onset older than 25 years.\nData Analysis\nWe carried out our primary statistical\nanalyses, based on linear models, using\nSUDAAN, Version 7.11 (Research Tri-\nangleInstitute,ResearchTrianglePark,\nNC), a software program that adjusts\nfor the complex NHANES III sample\ndesign for calculating variance esti-\nmates.58 All analyses incorporated sam-\npling weights that adjusted for unequal\nprobabilities of selection.

Shea and\ncolleagues11 examined the independent\nassociations of educational attainment\nand ethnicity (white, black, and His-\npanic) with the primary CVD risk fac-\ntors.Findingsweresimilartoours;how-\never, the study was confined to New\nYork State, relied on self-reported data\nfrom a telephone survey, and was lim-\nited by potential collinearity between\nSES and ethnicity (eg, 5% of whites vs\nnot completed high school). Other CVD\nstudies that have been more limited in\nscope(eg,restrictedto1ethniccompari-\nson, 1 CVD risk factor, and/or 1 geo-\ngraphic area) have, in general, sup-\nported our findings of higher-risk fac-\ntors among ethnic minority groups after\nadjustment for SES.47\nStrengths and Limitations\nNHANES III is the most comprehen-\nsive national survey to date with data on\nCVD risk factors for black, Mexican\nAmerican, and white women. The sur-\nvey included an oversampling of black\nand Mexican American women, the 2\nlargest groups of ethnic minority wom-\nen in the United States. Because\nNHANES I and II did not include large\nnumbers of Mexican American women\nand a related survey, the Hispanic\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nvey, did not include white women,\nNHANES III is the first such survey to\nallow a comparison of Mexican Ameri-\ncan and white women. It also included\nlargenumbersofwomenattheextremes\nof educational attainment. Extensive\nand complete data are available from\nboth the home survey and medical ex-\namination, including individual-level\nand family-level indicators of SES and\nstandardized measures of blood pres-\nsure, lipid levels, and glucose levels.\nDespite these strengths, our results\nshould be interpreted with caution be-\ncause of several design and measure-\nment limitations. First, the cross-sec-\ntional design of NHANES III limited\nour ability to draw inferences about\ncausal pathways. For example, the on-\nset of smoking, excess weight gain, and\nphysical inactivity usually occurs at\nearly ages, often before the completion\nof formal education. Although we could\nnot determine from the data the tempo-\nral association between level of educa-\ntion and these CVD risk factors, it is\nmore likely that SES influences risk of\ndisease than that risk of disease influ-\nSecond, the NHANES III data con-\ntained a potential for bias from self-\nreported questions, such as those ques-\ntions about smoking and physical activ-\nity. To verify self-reported smoking, we\nused a biochemical measure, serum co-\ntinine, that was available for all women\nfromphaseIofthesurvey.Amongwom-\nen who reported being nonsmokers, the\nfollowing percentages had positive re-\nsults for cotinine: 8.2% of black women,\n2.0% of Mexican American women, and\nand 2.5% of women completing less than\ntion, respectively.Thus,theminimalun-\nderreporting of smoking by Mexican\nAmerican women and women with\nhigher SES lends credence to our find-\ningoftheirlowsmokingrates.Fewstud-\nies have assessed reporting bias by eth-\nnicity for physical activity measures;\nhowever, we have seen no indications of\ndifferential underreporting or overre-\nporting by black, Mexican American, or\nThird, the NHANES III data used\nonly leisure-time activities to measure\noverall physical activity. It is not sur-\nprising that black and Mexican Ameri-\ncan women, who often have fewer re-\nsources and less time to engage in\nleisure-timephysicalactivitythanwhite\nwomen, reported lower levels of activ-\nity. We did not anticipate, however, that\nhigher-educated black and Mexican\nAmerican women (those who had com-\npleted 12 years of education) would be\nsubstantially more likely than white\nwomentoreportnoleisure-timeactivity\nrespectively). The few questions avail-\nable in NHANES III to assess physical\nactivity highlight the need for future\nsurveys to include measures such as to-\ntal activity recall or energy expenditure\nthat better reflect overall activity levels\nof women, regardless of ethnic and in-\ncome status.\nLast, our primary measure of SES\n(educational attainment) did not mea-\nsure core beliefs and practices in rela-\ntiontospecificCVDriskfactorsormedi-\ncal conditions. Furthermore, it did not\nprovide the same economic benefits to\nblack and Mexican American women as\nto white women.31 As shown in Table 1,\nthe likelihood of living below the pov-\nerty level decreased with increasing\neducation,butlesssoforblackandMexi-\ncan American women than for white\nwomen.\nRecommendations\nThe striking ethnic and SES differ-\nences in CVD risk factors highlight the\nneed for reform in public health policies,\nhealth care systems, and intervention\nand secondary CVD preventive efforts\nhave been effective in reaching white\nwomenandwomenwithhigherSES,they\nhave been less effective in reaching eth-\nnic minority women and women with\nlower SES.64,65 For example, of the wom-\nin the 3 large CVD community interven-\n90%werewhite(non-Hispanic),andmore\nthan 75% had completed a high school\neducation or more.65 In addition, there is\nstrong evidence that white women and\nwomen with higher SES obtain earlier\ndiagnoses for CVD-related conditions,\nhave better access to care, and are more\nlikelytobetreatedeffectivelythanother\ntentwithresultsfromhealthservices re-\nsearch and clinical trials that show that\nwhite women and women with higher\nSESaremorelikelythanAfricanAmeri-\ncan women and women with lower SES\ntobescreened,diagnosed,andtreatedfor\nhypercholesterolemia,70-72 and that white\nwomen are more likely than Mexican\nAmerican women to receive treatment\nThe challenge for public health pro-\nfessionals is to identify and understand\ngroups of women with high prevalences\nAge Group, y\nBlack\nBlack\nMexican\nAmerican\nMexican\nAmerican\nWhite\nWhite\nAge Group, y\nmm Hg\n%\nCurrent Smokers\nSystolic Blood Pressure\nSignificant interactions between ethnicity and age for blood pressure and smoking in women aged 25 to 64\nyears, from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1994.\n\u00a91998 American Medical Association.
