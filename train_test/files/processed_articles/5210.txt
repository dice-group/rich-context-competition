    "abstract": "Abstract\nGraphic organizers (GOs) are fast becoming acceptable standard instructional tools across subjects in the education arena\nglobally. However, this visual representation of information is yet to be recognized and integrated into the teaching methods\nin Nigerian schools. This study, therefore, presents a research-based investigation of the usefulness of GOs in the appreciation\nof prose literature in Nigeria, with a view to foregrounding their use in Nigerian schools. Specifically, the study seeks to find\nout whether senior secondary students in prose literature-in-English in Nigeria who are taught with GOs perform better\nin prose and comprehension assessments. Four project secondary schools with total of 100 students were purposively\nselected for the study. The schools were grouped into two: graphic-based schools (GBS) and non-graphic-based schools\n(NGBS). Whereas the GBS was exposed to instruction via eight graphic organizers, the NGBS served as control. Subjected\nto descriptive statistics and one-sample t test analysis, the investigation reveals that graphic organizers make students take\ncharge of the learning process in prose literature classes, and it concludes that these visual instructional elements guarantee\nstudent understanding and achievement. The study, thus, recommends the incorporation of graphic organizers in the teaching\nand learning processes across subjects in Nigerian schools.\n",

In fact 68% of the participants agreed that compre-\nhension has declined in the last decade. It further reports that\nthe reading culture in Nigeria is so abysmal that only 4%\nNigerians read at least a book or a piece of literary material a\nday. They (the participants in the poll) blamed the decadence\non \"poor educational system\" and \"cultural influence.\" Some\nof the recommendations in the report are that English lan-\nguage should be made a requisite recruitment criterion and\nreading should be encouraged. The message here is not so\nmuch the decline of an official language as the exposition on\nthe decaying literacy level in the country.\nIn 2013, participants of the famous Lagos Book Club2\nnote that candidates writing literature in English lacked\nfamiliarity with the texts examined; they assert that the can-\ndidates narrated \"when they should be discussing, analysing\n. . . or explaining specific notions . . . opinions and assertions\netc.\"; that they generally deviated from the questions. One\nimportant recommendation from the club is the \"need to\nraise the standard of teaching literature in Nigerian schools.\"\nOne way of doing this is to introduce new approaches to\nteaching literature, hence the need for the current research.\nInterestingly, many years before the findings of NoiPolls\nand the reports from Lagos Book Club, many researchers in\nNigeria had commented on the continuous fall of the English\nlanguage proficiency among Nigerian secondary school stu-\n& Abiodun-Eniayekan, 2016). Similarly, some scholars such\nand Uba et al. (2016) have noticed a similar trend among\n1Covenant University, Ota, Nigeria\n2Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nEmmanuel Uba, Department of Languages and General Studies, Covenant\nUniversity, KM 10, Idiroko Rd., Canaanland, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria.\nEmail: emmanuel.uba@covenantuniversity.edu.ng\nA Research-Based Evidence of the\nEffect of Graphic Organizers on the\nUnderstanding of Prose Fiction\nin ESL Classroom\nEmmanuel Uba1, Emmanuel Agbo Oteikwu2,\nEdwin Onwuka1, and Eugenia Abiodun-Eniayekan1\n Keywords\ngraphic organizers, prose literature, Nigerian schools, teaching and learning literature, ESL\n2 SAGE Open\npostsecondary school students in the country. As in the\nNoiPolls' recommendations, the counsel that runs as leitmo-\ntif in the works of these scholars is the enhancement or pro-\nmotion of good reading culture. Incidentally, one sure way of\nenhancing the reading capacity of the English as a second\nlanguage (ESL) learner speakers is through literature immer-\nsion. As noted by Uba et al. (2016), having literature-in-Eng-\nlish in the academic curriculum in Nigeria is one thing, but\nteaching it successfully to students is entirely a different\nthing. For students to maximally benefit from literature les-\nsons, they (the lessons) have to be organically composed and\npresented. One way of making literature interesting and\nengaging to students is by making it visually and tactilely\nappealing to them. An interesting approach to achieving this,\nhowever, is through the use of graphic organizers (see\nThe significance of literature in the teaching of reading\ncomprehension has been studied for many years by scholars\naround the world with findings ranging from those declaring\nit vital to enhancing students' cognitive abilities in English\nlanguage learning process (see Shokrolahi, 2014; Suleyman,\nUlbrich, 2013) to others decrying it as redundant or imped-\ning students' performance at reading and understanding\nFor clarification, literature is used here in its strict sense to\nmean any fictional or imaginative writing that can be catego-\nrized into any of the three major genres of literature--poetry,\nprose fiction, and drama. However, in this study, the focus is\non prose fiction. Compared with other forms, literary writ-\nings are not only \"distinguished in form, expression and\nemotional power,\" but also they have \"evaluative as well as\nLiterature enhances the language capacity of learners.\nTherefore, if the teaching of literature is enhanced in Nigerian\nschools, there is the tendency that students'English language\nproficiency will be improved. The authors believe that this\nwould complement the effectiveness of graphic organizers\non the understanding of prose fiction.\nThe study is set to achieve two main objectives, which are\n(a) to ascertain the perception of literature-in-English teach-\ners and students of the role of GOs in improving teaching and\nlearning of prose, and (b) to find out whether the perfor-\nmance of students taught with GOs would be better than\nthose students taught without GOs. To this end, the authors\nhypothesize that senior secondary school students in Nigeria\nwho are taught with GOs in prose literature-in-English do\nnot perform better in prose and comprehension tests than\ntheir counterparts who are not taught with GOs.\nGraphic Organizers and Learning\nAlso known as cognitive maps or content webs or concept\nmaps, graphic organizers are visual and kinetic display of\ninformation designed for the benefit of all classes of learners.\nThey are drawings that use geometric shapes or tables to show\nthe relations between various pieces of information (Zwiers,\n2004). There are several types of graphic organizers explained\nby many scholars. Some of them are attribute chart, story map,\nmain idea and detail chart, cause and effect diagram, Venn dia-\ngram, flow diagram, sequence chart, concept map, big ques-\ntion map, circle organizer, discussion map, and so forth (for\n2016).3 Irrespective of the type of organizer one chooses, three\nbasic factors need to be considered when constructing one.\nThese are summarized by Baxendell (2003) as follows:\na. Coherence: Every organizer should be designed in\nsuch a way that distractions are eliminated. The con-\nnections it explicates should be clearly labeled and\nthe information covered should be minimal.\nb. Creativity: Graphic organizers should be innova-\ntively constructed to inspire learners' interest. They\nshould also meet the aesthetic desires of the learners.\nEnough room for illustrations is to be created when\nconstructing graphic organizers.\nc. Consistency: To achieve reliability and dependabil-\nity, graphic organizers should be standard and regu-\nlarly introduced into the classroom. Standardization\nhere means that they should be within the cognitive\nperception of the target learners.\nThe literature is enriched with many studies that have\nfocused on GOs and their effects on students learning ability.\nGOs on the reading comprehension of one female with learn-\ning disability. The finding of that study indicates that GOs\nare \"an effective reading comprehension intervention for the\nELL with LD.\" The studies of Kim, Vaughn, Wanzek, and\nthat the use of GOs enhances reading comprehension among\nlearners with disability. Similarly, Gallavan and Kottler\n(2007) admit that the use of GOs enhances learners' short-\nterm memory and long-term achievement because they\nenable them to manipulate ideas and help them summarize\nconcepts. Whereas, Tang (1992) admits that GOs \"facilitate\nthe acquisition of a second language\" (p. 189), Jiang and\nGrabe (2007) remark that \"a serious remaining concern is the\nlack of graphic organisers research with L2 students\" (p. 46).\nThis study provides data from the L2 perspective.\nMethod\nResearch Design\nThe current study employs a transversal study design carried\nout chiefly through observation and analysis of the data col-\nlected from a sample comprising 100 senior secondary\nschool4 students.\nUba et al. 3\nParticipants\nThe research participants were 100 senior secondary stu-\ndents from four private secondary schools in Ife Central\nLocal Government, Osun State, Nigeria. There were more\nthan 100 students offering literature-in-English in the\nselected schools. However, for equal representation, 25 stu-\ndents were taken from each school on the following basis:\n1. Five students who were adjudged to be in the \"A\"\nperformance category;\n2. Five students in the \"B\" category;\n3. Five students in the \"C\" category;\n4. Five students in the \"D\" category;\n5. Five students in the \"E/F\" category.\nThis was done with the help of the principals and the\nteachers in the schools. All the participants spoke English as\na second language and any of Yoruba, Igbo, Ijaw, and Hausa.\nOnly about 12.6% of the students studying literature did so\nfor the love of reading, the rest studied literature because it\nwas a requisite subject in the course they wanted to read in\nthe university. The project schools were grouped into two.\nGroup 1 comprised two schools that used graphics in the\nteaching of literature-in-English (graphic-based schools\n[GBS]), while Group 2 consisted of two schools that did not\nuse graphics in their teaching of literature-in-English (non-\ngraphic-based schools [NGBS]). The project schools were\nnot only government approved but were also West African\nExaminations Council (WAEC) approved. They all operated\non the same literature curriculum. Although the schools did\nnot have the same number of literature teachers, all the teach-\ners were university graduates and had been teaching litera-\nture-in-English for more than 4 years before the research.\nInstruments\nThree main instruments were used during the study. The first\ninstrument was a graphic observation checklist comprising\nseven graphic organizers (GOs); these were the Big Question\nMap, Circle Organizer, Discussion Map, Compare-Contrast\nMatrix, Venn Diagram, Cause and Effect, Story Map and\nTime Line (Alshatti, 2012). They were introduced to the lit-\nerature teachers in the two GBS by the researchers. The\nresearchers trained the teachers on how and when to use a\nparticular GO for effective results. The second instrument\nconstituted four unseen prose passages that were adminis-\ntered to the subjects to ascertain their key elements in litera-\nture-in-English prose texts. Two passages were used to\ndesign 15 objective questions for pretest, and the other two\nwere used to design another 15 objective questions for post-\ntest. They were used to ascertain the subjects' understanding\nof the contents of the texts. All the four prose passages came\nfrom The Last Duty (Okpewho, 2010). This text was used\nbecause it was the recommended text for senior secondary\nschool literature in Nigeria as at the time of the research.\nThere were also four passages for reading comprehension,\nwhich were of the same readability level of the students. Two\npassages were used to design 15 objective questions for the\npretest, and the other two passages were used for the design\nof another 15 objective questions for the posttest. All the pas-\nsages were designed to ascertain their literal, inferential,\ncritical, and creative reading skills. The third instrument was\na structured classroom interaction observation schedule (see\nthe appendix), which was a modified version of Onukaogu\n(1994) classroom interaction analysis schedule. This was\nused in coding the interactions in the classrooms for only\nprose literature-in-English.\nProcedure\nAll the literature-in-English teachers in the GBS were trained\nby the researchers for a period of 3 weeks on\na. How to use the checklist to identify and use graphics in\ntheir literature-in-English lessons. After the training,\ntheir performances were evaluated by the researchers;\nb. How to fill the sections of the structured classroom\ninteraction observation schedule that were applicable\nto them.\nThe teachers in the GBS taught prose literature using GOs\nfor two terms, a period that was equivalent to 8 months. The\nteachers in the NGBS taught the same aspect of literature\nwithout using any graphic organizer.\nTwo unseen prose passages (with 15 objective questions)\nand two comprehension passages (with 15 objective ques-\ntions) were administered to all the students in the project\nschools (GBS and NGBS) before the treatment began.\nAdministration of another set of 30 objective questions took\nplace at the end of the second term in the form of posttest. The\nperformance of the students in each of the tests was classified\nfollowing Onukaogu's (1994) criteria for ease of comparison:\n1. 1% to 39%. This reflects the performance of students\nwho were considered to be below average in their test\nability.\n2. 40% to 59%. This reflects the performance of the stu-\ndents who were considered to be just average in their\ntest ability.\n3. 60% to 69%. This reflects the performance of stu-\ndents who were considered to be above average in\ntheir test ability.\ndents who were considered excellent in their test\nability.\nThe Pretests\nBefore the treatment, all the 100 participating students\nanswered 30 objective questions from two unseen prose texts\n4 SAGE Open\nand two comprehension passages. The descriptive statistics\nof the results of the tests are presented in Table 1.\nThese tests were administered to register participants'\ndegree of prose appreciation and comprehension capacity\nbefore being introduced to the GOs. The tests comprised 30\nobjective questions quintessential of the Senior Secondary\nSchool Certificate Examinations questions.\nTreatment\nAll the participating schools had two literature-in-English\nteachers, one for senior secondary students and the other for\nthe junior classes. The timetables from all the schools indi-\ncated that literature-in-English was taught twice a week.\nHowever, the days of the week and time of the day for the\nsubject differed from school to school. All the subjects partici-\npated in tutorial classes on Fridays (in the evening) and\nSaturday (from 8:00 a.m. till 6:00 p.m.) in preparation for the\nSenior Secondary Certificate Examinations (roughly equiva-\nlent to General Certificate of Education [GCE]). Whereas the\nteachers in the NGBS taught their students in the traditional\nway, their counterparts in GBS employed different GOs in\nteaching literature-in-English. All the genres of literature were\ntaught using GOs in GBS; the researchers recorded activities\nin prose classes only. They also used GOs in class discussions\nand in doing some of their homework assignments.\nPosttests\nAnother set of 30 objective questions (from two unseen\nprose texts and two comprehension passages) were pre-\nsented to all the participants in both GBS and NGBS. The\nresults are presented and discussed in the \"Results and\nDiscussion\" section below.\nData Analysis\nBefore subjecting the data to descriptive and inferential sta-\ntistics, a frequency count of all the interactions was taken.\nBased on the overall interactions, single-sample t test analy-\nses of the performance of all the students in the tests were\ncomputed. The analyses were carried out on a hypothesized\nmeans of 2.2 for the prose test, and 2.28 for the comprehen-\nsion. These figures served as the test values for the compari-\nsons of means. There was no relationship between the scores\non the test variables, no outliers, and the size of the sample\nwas moderate enough that a slight violation of normality\nmight still yield accurate p values.\nResults and Discussion\nThe means were compared in a single-sample t test. The\ntest values were 2.2 and 2.28 for both the unseen prose and\ncomprehension, respectively. The results are presented in\nThe range of performance of the subjects from the two\ngroups of schools in the unseen prose test shows that, for the\nGBS, 2% of the subjects fall within the range of 1% to 39%\nin the test, whereas 22% represents the score from the NGBS.\nMore students from the NGBS performed below average in\nthe unseen prose test than those from the GBS. Again, 6% of\nthe subjects from the GBS scored between 50% and 59%\nwhile the NGBS had 46% of their subjects in the same cate-\ngory. This shows that few students in the GBS performed\naveragely in the unseen prose test, unlike the subjects from\nthe NGBS who had almost half of them in the same category.\nFurthermore, 7% from the GBS scored between 60% and\n69% while in the NGBS 19% were in the same range. In this\naspect, it is obvious that more subjects from the NGBS\nexhibited good performance in the unseen prose test as com-\npared with those from the GBS. Finally, 85% of the GBS'\nNGBS were within the same range. This indicates that a high\nnumber of subjects from the GBS performed excellently in\nthe test, whereas a lesser number of students from the NGBS\ndid so. In comparison, the non-graphic-based subjects were\nfairly spaced between the first three levels of performances\nwith the least population in the very high performance cate-\ngory. This distinguishes the graphic-based students as very\nhigh achievers unlike the non-graphic-based students.\nA similar trend played out in the performance of the two\ngroups in the comprehension tests. The data show that for the\nGBS, 3% of the subjects fall within the range of 1% to 39%\nin the test and 19% from the nongraphic schools fall within\nthe same range. This shows that more subjects from the\nNGBS performed poorly in the comprehension test than the\nGBS. Similarly, 13% of the subjects from the GBS scored\nwere found in the same group. Here again, more subjects\nfrom the NGBS performed above average in the comprehen-\nsion test than their colleagues from the GBS. Furthermore,\nthe NGBS, 22% had the same score range. Here again, more\nsubjects from the NGBS were found in this group than those\nfrom the GBS, that is, a higher percentage of the NGBS\nTable 1. Participants' Pretest Performance.\nUnseen prose Comprehension\n\nPretest\nGBS\nPretest\nNGBS\nPretest\nGBS\nPretest\nNGBS\nN\nNote. GBS = graphic-based schools; NGBS = non-graphic-based schools.\nUba et al. 5\nperformed well in the comprehension test as compared with\ntheir counterparts from the GBS. However, 73% of the GBS'\nthe NGBS scored within the same range. Just as what hap-\npened in the unseen prose tests, there was more number of\nstudents from the GBS who performed excellently in the test.\nFrom the data, it is clear that among the low grades, about the\nsame number of participants from the two groups scored\nbetween 1% and 69%. However, the GBS had a higher num-\nber of subjects who performed excellently in the tests.\nThe finding, thus, shows that the GBS had less students in\nthe low score level to average and good performance, with\nthe majority in the very high performance category, whereas\nthe NGBS had majority in the low to average and good per-\nformance, with very few in the very high performance cate-\ngory. This distinguishes students from the GBS as students\nwith high level of comprehension ability, which can be\nattributed to the use of graphic organizers as a tool in their\nlearning process.\nThe comparison of the mean performances of students\nfrom the GBS and the NGBS, displayed in Tables 1 and 4\nabove, clearly shows that subjects from the GBS had\ngreater means in the posttests in both unseen prose and\ncomprehension than in the pretests. Whereas, the results\nfrom the t test analysis indicate a p value of <.05 for the\nGBS in both unseen prose and comprehension, while that\nof the NGBS is >.05. With this t test result, the hypothesis\nthat senior secondary school students in Nigeria who are\ntaught with GOs in prose literature-in-English do not per-\nform better in prose and comprehension tests than their\ncounterparts who are not taught with GOs is, thus, rejected.\nGiven that the introduction of GOs was the only new strat-\negy exposed to the treatment group, this result would not\nhave occurred had the GBS not been subjected to GOs. It\nis most probable that the subjects in NGBS performed the\nway they did because they failed to draw an association\nbetween their prior knowledge and the ideas in the tests\nthey were reading. This finding is in consonance with the\nconclusion reached by Sam and Rajan (2013) that, when\napplied appropriately, GOs help to improve reading\nTable 2.

And it once again\nnegates the conclusion by Griffin and Tulbert (1995) that\nstudies on GOs have been inconclusive.\nAlthough it is established from the t tests that students\nfrom the GBS performed better than their counterparts from\nthe NGBS in the unseen prose tests and comprehension\ntests, it is vital to understand that the use of graphics did not\naffect only on the subjects' cognitive development. The use\nof graphics also influences other areas of learning processes,\nwhich cumulatively determine the overall success of stu-\n2000). For example, from the results of the structured class-\nroom interaction observation schedule, it was observed that\ngraphic-based classes were more organic and interesting to\nlearners than the non-graphic-based classes. Item 2 on the\nschedule (demonstrated learners'attitude) indicated that stu-\ndents in the GBS were more cooperative, persistent, inde-\npendent in reasoning, enthusiastic, and responsible to\nlearning than the students in NGBS.\nSimilarly, Item 3 of the schedule clearly showed that the\nteachers in GBS were not assuming the traditional role of\nteacher-know-it-all; rather, they were able to shift most of\nthe learning responsibilities to their students. They only\nprovided guides to the learners, motivated and encouraged\nthem, and praised them where necessary. On the contrary, it\nwas observed that teachers in the NGBS maintained the sta-\ntus quo in the prose classroom: They commandeered the\nlearning processes by doing all the talking and asking ques-\ntions at the end of the class. Consequently, students in the\nGBS interacted with each other freely, worked in groups to\nprovide solutions to problems, and applied literary princi-\nples to real-life issues. On the contrary, students in the\nNGBs maintained the monotony of silence typical of the\ntraditional teaching method.\nAgain, as for the classroom atmosphere in the prose\nclasses, it was discovered that in the GBS classrooms major-\nity of the students demonstrated interest in the activities\ngoing on in the classroom and most of them actively partici-\npated in discussions that emanated from the texts studied.\nThe classrooms were generally orderly and peaceful, which\nengendered a favorable learning climate for the students. On\nthe contrary, the majority of the students in NGBS were fre-\nquently off tasks and apathetic to the instructor's activities.\nThis made the atmosphere in the classrooms too tense for\nany meaningful learning to take place.\nHowever, interpersonal interactions with the partici-\npants revealed that the good performance of the students in\nGBS was not directly as a result of the teachers' use of\ngraphic organizers in the lessons, rather, the graphic orga-\nnizers made the lessons more interesting and engaging for\nthe learners, who, in turn, became more enthusiastic in the\nwhole learning process. The fun aspects of the organizers\nmade the students learn in a play-way approach, which\ninvariably contributed to developing their interest in the\nclassroom activities.\nLessons From the Pilot\nPrior to the study, a 4-week preliminary session was carried\nout chiefly to evaluate the applicability of the research instru-\nments. During the pilot, many things were revealed to the\nresearchers, of which the following were the salient ones:\ni. Two teachers only out of the 10 teachers of literature-\nin-English in the selected schools had heard of\ngraphic organizers. Interestingly, these two thought\nthat organizers were for children in stories.\nii. All the teachers in the GBS claimed that the use of\norganizers made their teaching very easy and their\nlessons more interesting. They, however, complained\nthat more time was spent in preparing and selecting\nconcepts for the organizers.\niii. Students in GBS were initially apprehensive of the\nfirst set of organizers introduced to them by the\nteachers. They began to relax after a thorough expla-\nnation of the organizers by their teachers.\niv. The students' interest was heightened at every new\ngraphic organizer introduced to them.\nLimitations/Recommendations\nOne important limitation of the current study is that all the sub-\njects were drawn from the same local government area in south-\nwest Nigeria. There is the need to expand the sample to include\nmore subjects from other sections of the country. Second, the\npretest and posttest questions were solely objective. The authors\ntherefore recommend that further research be conducted with\nsubjective assessment format. Again, the comprehension pas-\nsages used in this study were descriptive; further studies should\nbe conducted using expository passages, with unfamiliar com-\nplex concepts, vocabulary, and organizational structure.\nConclusion\nThe authors of this study are not, however, saying that GOs\nare the best methods in improving teaching and learning of\nprose literature in Nigeria; rather, their position is that incor-\nporating GOs in schools will enhance the quality of literature\ninstruction in Nigerian schools. What the GOs did for the\nstudents in the study was to make the teaching and learning\nexperiences a reflective one. The students, from the class-\nroom interaction observation analysis, became more inter-\nested in the literature classes as a result of the GOs'interactive\nnature. Therefore, straightforward graphic organizers should\nbe integrated into the curriculum. The findings of this study\nhave left us with no better conclusion than to state that litera-\nture not only plays a significant role in language learning, but\nit also can be better taught and learned through the use of\ngraphic organizers.The contributions of Moore and Readence\nand Sam and Rajan (2013) support this conclusion. Graphics\nUba et al. 7\nact as a catalyst to comprehension of literary texts as they\nhelp to stimulate ESL learners' interest in the texts. With the\nuse of graphics in the classroom, the lesson becomes more\ninteractive. Classroom interaction is known to helping learn-\ners to build confidence as they navigate and negotiate the\nlearning process.\nAppendix\nClassroom Interaction Observation Schedule (Instrument)\nSCHOOL--------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------\nCLASS---------------------------------------------NUMBER OF\nSTUDENTS-----------------\nTIME OF THE DAY------------------------------------\nTEACHER-------------------------------------------------\nInstruction: Please TICK/FILL IN the ones\nthat are appropriate to your class/lesson.\n1.
