Browning\nResearch suggests that legal cynicism--a cultural frame in which the law is viewed as illegitimate\nand ineffective--encourages violence to maintain personal safety when legal recourse is unreli-\nable. But no study has tested the impact of legal cynicism on appraisals of violence. Drawing\nfrom symbolic interaction theory and cultural sociology, we tested whether neighbourhood legal\ncynicism alters the extent to which parents appraise their children's violence as indicative of aggres-\nsive or impulsive temperaments using data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago\nNeighborhoods. We find that legal cynicism attenuates the positive association between adolescent\nviolence and parental assessments of aggression and impulsivity. Our study advances the under-\nstanding of micro-level processes through which prevailing cultural frames in the neighbourhood\nshape violence appraisals.\nKeywords: legal cynicism, cultural frames, adolescent delinquency, neighbourhood\neffects\nCriminologists increasingly have focused on the consequences of legal cynicism within\nneighbourhoods. Legal cynicism refers to the cultural view that the legal system is\nillegitimate, inadequately protects against victimization and fails to properly handle\n(criminal) offenses. Accordingly, extralegal strategies to resolve disputes or to secure\npersonal safety should be favoured over legal recourse in legally cynical contexts.\nIndeed, higher levels of neighbourhood legal cynicism have been associated with\nincreased rates of violence (Kirk and Papachristos 2011) and with a decreased likeli-\nhood of arrest for juvenile delinquency (Kirk and Matsuda 2011). But apparently no\nstudy has quantitatively assessed whether and how legal cynicism influences appraisals\nof violence and aggression, which have been inconsistently associated with adolescent\ncrime and delinquency across neighbourhoods (Lynam et al. 2000; Zimmerman 2010).\nTo address this gap in the literature, we investigate whether and how legal cynicism\ninfluences appraisals of adolescents' violent behaviour. Specifically, we test whether the\nlevel of legal cynicism characterizing the residential neighbourhood influences par-\nents' interpretations of their children's violent behaviour as indicative of trait-based\npredispositions.\nUnderstanding the factors influencing parental appraisals of violence is important\nbecause it may help explain why the association between parental assessments of trait-\nbased predispositions and adolescent crime and delinquency is inconsistent across\nneighbourhoods. For instance, Lynam et al. (2000) found that among a sample of\nboys in Pittsburgh, the positive association between an impulsivity measure--which\nNM 87131, USA; bsoller@unm.edu; Aubrey L. Jackson, Department of Sociology, University of New Mexico; Christopher\nR. Browning, Department of Sociology, The Ohio State University.\ncombined parent, self, teacher and researcher assessments--and offending was\nstronger in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Using data from the Project on Human\nDevelopment in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN), Zimmerman (2010) found that\nthe association between parent reports of impulsivity and adolescent offending was\nweakest in neighbourhoods with high levels of legal cynicism. One possible explana-\ntion for this variation across neighbourhoods is that assessments of trait-based predis-\npositions, such as impulsivity and externalizing behaviour problems, often were based\non parents' interpretations of their children's behaviour (Wareham and Boots 2011).\nImportantly, it is possible that parental assessments of trait-based predispositions--\nalthough likely influenced by children's actual behaviour--are systematically biased by\nneighbourhood-based cultural frames. Furthermore, according to Kirk and Matsuda\n(2011) and Kirk and Papachristos (2011), legal cynicism functions as a cultural frame\nthat influences interpretations of violent behaviour within larger contexts, such as\nneighbourhoods.\nTo explain how legal cynicism might influence parental appraisals of adoles-\ncents' violent behaviour, our theoretical framework focuses on how cultural `frames'\n(Goffman 1974; Benford and Snow 2000) inform `role-taking' and appraisal processes\n(Matsueda 1992). Based on this approach, we propose legal cynicism shapes appraisals\nof violence through a process in which individuals project themselves into the roles\nof others and appraise, from their standpoints, the situation, themselves in the situa-\ntion and possible lines of action (Mead 1934; Matsueda 1992). Specifically, we argue\nthat parents residing in legally cynical neighbourhoods--which are characterized by\npervasive views that legal recourse is inadequate--will interpret their children's vio-\nlent behaviour as rational, situated behavioural responses to precarious circumstances\nrather than as symptoms of trait-based predispositions. Accordingly, we hypothesize\nthat legal cynicism attenuates the positive association between children's self-reported\nviolent behaviour and parental assessments of their children's aggression and of a\nrelated temperament--impulsivity--which prominent criminological theories sug-\ngest is a trait strongly associated with delinquency (Gottfredson and Hirschi 1990;\nMoffitt 1993). We test hypotheses with multilevel statistical models using data from\nthe PHDCN.\nA Focus on Cultural Frames\nMuch of the recent research concerning the relationship between culture and crime\ndraws from classical theories of criminal subcultures, which propose that structurally\ndisadvantaged and socially disorganized neighbourhoods engender deviant systems of\nvalues and norms that sanction violence (Cohen 1955; Cloward and Ohlin 1960; Kubrin\nand Weitzer 2003; Stewart and Simons 2006). Accordingly, individuals are thought to\noffend primarily because they adopt norms and values that are conducive to violence\nfrom the surrounding cultural context. But research suggests that residents of poor\nand disorganized neighbourhoods share values with those from more advantaged and\nsocially organized communities (Hannerz 1969; Harding 2007). Given the discrepancy\nbetween the propositions of subcultural theories and empirical findings, we instead\nemploy an alternative and perhaps more fruitful approach to culture that focuses on\nAccording to a framing approach, culture influences action in part through the\nprovision of cognitive frames that shape individuals' perceptions and understand-\nand simplify the external world by selectively encoding actions, events and mun-\ndane occurrences (Benford and Snow 2000). Frames are behaviourally consequen-\ntial because they help individuals identify the practical consequences of various\n`strategies of action' (Swidler 1986) within particular contexts or situations (Berg\net al. 2012). Decisions to employ particular victimization-avoidance strategies, e.g.,\nare influenced by interpretations of violent contexts and of the perceived conse-\nquences of violence. These interpretations are based on past observations, which\nwere filtered through cultural frames pertaining to violence. Rather than inducing\nindividuals to adhere to certain norms or values, culture influences action in large\npart by informing individuals' interpretations of situations--through the provision\nof frames--thereby making violent strategies of action possible and more or less\nprobable (Lamont and Small 2008; Berg et al. 2012). Importantly, this approach to\nculture helps explain why individuals act violently without adhering to a coherent\nset of oppositional cultural norms or values as is suggested by subcultural theories\nThe specific cultural frame we focus on in this study is legal cynicism, which fos-\nters the expectation that legal recourse is unreliable and illegitimate. Given this\ninterpretation, adolescents' strategies for resolving disputes are constrained to\ndefines `self-help' strategies as rational, aggressive responses to grievances that may\ninclude violence. Strategies to avoid victimization are especially likely to include\nviolence if legal protections are inadequate (Anderson 1999; Stewart and Simons\n2006). The cultural frame of legal cynicism thus may encourage perceptions that\nlegal dispute-resolution and victim-avoidance strategies are limited, thereby mak-\ning violence more probable. Indeed, Kirk and Papachristos (2011) found that vio-\nlence is pervasive in legally cynical neighbourhoods. Thus, distinct from the typical\ncriminological view that violence inherently is delinquent or antisocial (Shaw and\ntive allows for the possibility that adolescents within legally cynical neighbourhoods\nact violently even if they do not `value' violence or adhere to norms that legitimize\nviolence. Violence in legally cynical neighbourhoods may be interpreted instead as\npractical, situated behavioural responses within contexts (perceived to be) bereft of\nlegal recourse.\nBuilding upon Kirk and Papachristos' (2011) study, we propose that as a cultural\nframe, legal cynicism not only influences adolescents' decisions to use violence but also\nshapes parents' views regarding the strategies of action that are reasonably available\nto neighbourhood youth engaged in conflict or threatening situations. This is because\ncultural frames not only `inform how people cognitively perceive themselves and the\nworld in which they live' (Kirk and Papachristos 2011: 1196) but they also alter how peo-\nple appraise others' behaviour through the `role-taking' process (Mead 1934; Matsueda\n1992). In the following section, we explain how--through the role-taking process--the\ncultural frame of legal cynicism alters parents' interpretations of their children's vio-\nlent behaviour as symptomatic of individual psychological or trait-based predisposi-\ntions to aggression and impulsivity.\nLegal Cynicism and Role-Taking\nAdolescent violence likely is positively associated with parental assessments of their\naggression and impulsivity. But we argue the association between observed behaviour\nand appraisals of that behaviour is contingent upon cultural frames--in this case,\nlegal cynicism--through which parents interpret the situations that adolescents face\nthroughout their daily lives. These interpretations in turn are realized through the\nrole-taking process in which parents, who experience different external behavioural\nexpectations than do their children, nonetheless may identify the constraints associ-\nated with their children's roles.\nAccording to symbolic interaction theory, role-taking is the process of `projecting\noneself into the role of other persons and appraising, from their standpoint, the situa-\ntion, oneself in the situation, and possible lines of action' (Matsueda 1992: 1580). For\nadolescents and adults, this process involves taking the role of the `generalized other'\n(Mead 1934), which encompasses `the norms, rules, and expectations of a group, com-\nmunity or society' (Matsueda 1992: 1581). Because cultural frames help individuals\ninterpret these aspects of the social world, frames help individuals make sense of the\ngeneralized other, thereby influencing behaviour appraisals. Taking the role of the\ngeneralized other allows one to understand and identify potential strategies of action\nthat are associated with the roles others occupy, which may be quite different from one's\nown role(s). In this way, cultural frames influence how, e.g., a parent interprets and\nidentifies, from his or her child's standpoint, appropriate courses of action given situ-\national constraints.\nUpon projecting themselves into the role of their children, parents perceiving ado-\nlescents' behaviour through a legal cynicism frame may interpret violence as an appro-\npriate strategy of action to resolve grievances or to secure personal safety because legal\nrecourse is unavailable, illegitimate or ineffective. Accordingly, parents residing in\nneighbourhoods with pervasive legal cynicism may be less likely to interpret violence\nas symptomatic of individual psychological or trait-based predispositions and instead\nunderstand violence as a situated behavioural response. In contrast, parents in neigh-\nbourhoods with low levels of legal cynicism may interpret violence as an unnecessary\nand undesirable strategy of action symptomatic of a trait-based predisposition, such as\nan aggressive or impulsive temperament.\nIn summary, we propose legal cynicism encourages residents to interpret violence as\na rational reaction within contexts void of formal social control rather than as indic-\native of a trait-based predisposition. Accordingly, we hypothesize that legal cynicism will\nattenuate the positive association between adolescents' violence and parental assessments of the\nextent to which adolescents are aggressive or impulsive. That is, results support the situated\nbehavioural response hypothesis if, compared to those residing in less cynical neigh-\nbourhoods, parents in highly cynical neighbourhoods appraise their children's violent\nbehaviour as less indicative of an aggressive or impulsive temperament.\nData and Methods\nWe used data from the first wave (1994\u00ad97) of the PHDCN Longitudinal Cohort Study\n(LCS) to construct our dependent and individual-level independent variables. Data\nfor variables measured at the neighbourhood cluster (NC) level--that is, aggregations\nof one to three census tracts--were drawn from the 1995 PHDCN Community Survey\nDecennial Census.\nLongitudinal Cohort Study\nThe PHDCN-LCS is a longitudinal study that examines human development through-\nout early childhood and emerging adulthood among young people in Chicago. For the\nLCS, Chicago's 865 census tracts were combined into 343 NCs that maintained relative\npopulation homogeneity regarding racial and ethnic composition, and housing and\nfamily structural characteristics. PHDCN investigators also defined NCs on the basis\nof ecological boundaries, such as parks, railways and freeways. Each NC consisted of\nroughly 8,000 people. From there, a two-stage sampling procedure was used to con-\nstruct a probability sample consisting of 80 of the 343 NCs stratified by socio-economic\nstatus (high, medium and low), and racial and ethnic make-up (seven categories).\nThe primary objective of sample stratification was to obtain equal representation of\nNCs across the 21 strata. Census blocks were randomly selected from each of the 80\nrepresentative NCs. Within each block, children and emerging adults from seven age\nhouseholds. In-home interviews were conducted with youth respondents and their pri-\nmary caregivers. We focused on respondents from cohorts 9 through 15 because both\nparental assessments of trait-based predispositions and respondent reports of violence\nwere collected from only these cohorts during the first wave of the PHDCN. Our final\nsample consisted of 2,293 adolescent respondents with their primary caregivers nested\nCommunity Survey\nThe PHDCN-CS consists of a probability sample of more than 8,700 adult residents\nof Chicago focusing on their assessments of neighbourhood environments. The sur-\nvey used a three-stage sampling procedure in which city blocks within Chicago's 343\nNCs were randomly selected. Dwelling units within these blocks were then randomly\nselected. Finally, one adult aged 18 years or older per household was randomly selected\nto complete the survey questionnaire. Although 343 NCs were identified, CS respond-\nents resided in only 342 of them. Approximately 25 respondents were selected from\neach of the NCs to allow reliable estimation of neighbourhood-level characteristics\nfrom individual survey responses. PHDCN researchers collected oversamples among\nthe 80 NCs that included PHDCN-LCS respondents, resulting in an average of roughly\n50 CS respondents in each of those NCs.\nDependent Variables\nWe modelled the interactive effects of legal cynicism and adolescent violence on two\ndependent variables that came from validated and widely used behavioural scales, namely\nthe Child Behavior Checklist/4-18 (CBCL) (Achenbach 1991), and the Emotionality,\nActivity, Sociability, and Impulsivity Temperament Survey (EASI) (Buss and Plomin 1984).\nThe first dependent variable, parental assessments of aggression, was measured with a CBCL\nsubscale that was designed to identify syndromes of co-occurring behavioural problems\nrelated to violence and aggression (Achenbach 1991). During the Wave 1 interview, car-\negivers were asked to indicate whether a set 20 of problem behaviours `describes [CHILD]\nnow or within the past 6 months'. Initial responses were scored on a three-point scale ranging\nfrom 0 (`not true') to 2 (`often true'). The aggressive behaviour scale included behaviours\nsuch as getting in many fights, physically attacking people, being cruel, being mean or\nbullying others and threatening people.1 As suggested by Achenbach (1991), we measured\nparental assessments of aggression by first summing responses to the 20 items ( = 0.880).\nBecause this variable's distribution was highly skewed, we then added 1 to each individu-\nal's externalizing score and log-transformed the resulting measure. Higher values on this\nscale suggested parents assess their children as more temperamentally aggressive.\nThe second dependent variable, parental assessments of impulsivity, was measured using\n20 items from the EASI (Buss and Plomin 1984). For this portion of the interview, par-\nents were asked whether a number of statements were characteristic of the focal child.\nSimilar to Gibson et al. (2010), our measure of parental assessments of impulsivity com-\nbined four subscales from the EASI. The first subscale, inhibitory control, included five\nitems capturing the perceived inability of the child to delay gratification and control his\nor her frustrations (e.g. `[CHILD] has trouble controlling his/her impulses'). Decision\ntime, the second subscale, included five items gauging the parent's perception of child's\ninability to delay decision making before considering alternatives (e.g. `[CHILD] often\nacts at the spur of the moment'). The third subscale, sensation seeking, comprised five\nitems tapping preference for new stimuli and acting in the spur of the moment (e.g.\n`[CHILD] sometimes does \"crazy\" things just to be different'). The final subscale, per-\nsistence, included five items in which parents assessed their child's diligence and ability\nto complete a task (e.g. `[CHILD] generally likes to see things through to the end').\nResponses to all scale items ranged from 1 (`uncharacteristic or not at all like [CHILD]')\nto 5 (`characteristic or very much like [CHILD]'). To measure parental assessments\nof impulsivity, we first reverse-coded scale items that measured low impulsivity (e.g.\n`[CHILD] generally likes seeing things through the end'). We then calculated the mean\nof the items ( = 0.768). Higher values on the resulting scale indicated higher levels of\nperceived impulsivity. Descriptive statistics for both dependent variables and for the\nindividual- and neighbourhood-level variables are listed in Table 1.\nIndividual-level independent variables\nAdolescent violence\nAdolescent respondents indicated whether they engaged in various violent acts within\nthe 12 months prior to the first-wave interview. We used responses from these items to\nconstruct our key individual-level independent variable--adolescent violence. Adolescent\nrespondents were asked whether they engaged in the following violent behaviours: (1)\n`Hit someone with whom you did not live with the intention of hurting them' (22.3\nper cent); (2) `Carried a hidden weapon' (7.2 per cent); (3) `Attacked someone with a\n1 As an empirical check, we reran analyses using the full externalizing behaviour scale, which also included parental assess-\nments of their children's non-violent delinquent behaviour (e.g. swears, vandalism, lies, and cheats). Results from those models\nwere nearly identical to those obtained from the aggressive behaviour subscale presented in this study.\nweapon' (2.8 per cent); (4) `Purposely set fire to a house, building, car or vacant lot' (0.9\nper cent); (5) `Snatched someone's purse or wallet or picked someone's pocket' (0.6 per\ncent); (6) `Thrown objects, such as rocks or bottles, at people' (12.2 per cent); (7) `Used\na weapon or force to get money or things from people' (0.2 per cent) and (8) `Been\ninvolved in a gang fight in which someone was hurt or threatened with harm' (4.8 per\ncent). Our measure of adolescent violence represents the number of these violent acts\nthat the respondent engaged in during the past 12 months.2\nParent\u00adchild relationship and family environment\nWe included measures of the parent\u00adchild relationship that likely impact parents' aware-\nness of their children's behaviour. Parental warmth captured affective parenting styles\nas measured by the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME)\nInventory (Caldwell and Bradley 1984). The scale included nine interviewer-assessed\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics on individual and neighbourhood variables\nMean Standard deviation\n Parental assessments\n Race/ethnicity (white/other omitted)\n Family history of arrest 0.30\nNeighbourhood (N = 80)\n2 We ran additional analyses (results not displayed but available upon request) that relied on the IRT-scaled violence measure\nproposed by Raudenbush et al. (2003). Results based on the IRT-scaled violence measure are nearly identical to those presented\nin this study. Additionally, the two violence measures are correlated at 0.97.\nitems indicating whether the primary caregiver performed acts such as mentioning\na particular skill of the focal respondent or praised the adolescent during the Wave 1\ninterview. Past research using PHDCN data found high reliability and validity for the\nparental warmth scale (Leventhal et al. 2004). Our measure of parental warmth repre-\nsented the mean of the items ( = 0.759).\nWe also included two measures capturing parental monitoring of children's activities\nand peer groups. Place monitoring was a binary variable indicating whether the adoles-\ncent is allowed to wander unsupervised for more than two hours (Browning et al. 2005).\nPeer monitoring indicated whether the primary caregiver had contact with at least two\nof the adolescent's friends in the past two weeks (Coleman 1990; Browning et al. 2005).\nBecause parental social capital likely increases parents' access to information about\ntheir children's delinquency, we included two measures from the Provision of Social\nRelations module (Turner et al. 1983) that capture dimensions of parents' social rela-\ntionships. Support from friends represented a six-item scale that included responses to\nquestions such as `I share the same approach to life as my friends do' and `My friends\nwould take the time to talk about my problems, should I ever want to' ( = 0.751). Support\nfrom family represented a six-item scale that included responses to questions such as `I\nknow my family will always stand by me' and `People in my family help me find solu-\ntions to my problems' ( = 0.762). Responses to scale items for both support measures\nranged from 1 (`very true') to 3 (`not true'). To construct each scale, we recoded initial\nresponses so that higher values indicated higher levels of support and then took the\nmean of the items. We also included a measure of residential tenure because it is posi-\ntively associated with individuals' neighbourhood-based social capital (Swaroop and\nMorenoff 2006). This measure was the number of years that the primary caregiver has\nlived at the current address.\nAdolescent experiences with violence\nWe controlled for parents' assessments of their children's exposure to violence with a\ndummy variable indicating whether the primary caregiver thought the adolescent was\nexposed to at least one of four violent events, such as witnessing a shooting or a physi-\ncal assault, in the year leading up to the interview. We included a measure of peer vio-\nlence, which was based on four items that indicated the proportion of the adolescent's\nfriends who have engaged in violent acts, such as attacking someone with a weapon (as\nreported by the adolescent respondent). Responses ranged from 1 (`none of them') to 3\n(`all of them') (Zimmerman and Messner 2010). Our measure of peer delinquency con-\nsisted of the mean of the items ( = 0.675). We also included a dummy variable indicat-\ning whether anyone in the adolescents' family has a criminal record or has been arrested.\nDemographic characteristics\nWe also included a measure of age (in years) and a dummy indicating male sex. Race\nand ethnicity were captured with a series of indicators for black, Latino and other (white\nwas the omitted reference category). Family structure was assessed with an indicator of\nwhether both biological parents were present. Socio-economic status was captured by\nthe first component from a principal component analysis of the maximum value for\noccupational status, education and income among the parents in each adolescent's\nhousehold.\nNeighbourhood-level independent variables\nLegal cynicism\nOur key neighbourhood-level independent variable, legal cynicism, was assessed using\nresponses from all adult participants in the PHDCN-CS. This measure captures the\nextent to which residents lack confidence in the law and law enforcement. Following\nKirk and Papachristos (2011), our measure of legal cynicism included responses to the\nfollowing three items: (1) `Laws were made to be broken', (2) `The police are not doing\na good job in preventing crime in this neighbourhood' and (3) `The police are not able\nto maintain order on the streets and sidewalks in the neighbourhood'. Initial responses\nranged from 1 (`strongly agree') to 5 (`strongly disagree'). To measure legal cynicism,\nwe first estimated a three-level, linear item response theory (IRT) model with reverse-\ncoded items nested within respondents nested within each of the 342 NCs. The IRT\nmodel considered legal cynicism as an underlying construct whose neighbourhood-\nlevel latent value is based on scale items as well as individual and neighbourhood pre-\ndispositions.3 From the IRT model, we derived the neighbourhood-level empirical Bayes\n(EB)-adjusted intercepts (multilevel reliability = 0.785). These EB-adjusted intercepts\ncomprised our final measure--the mean value of legal cynicism within each neigh-\nbourhood adjusted for scale item severity as well as individual- and neighbourhood-\nCollective efficacy\nWe also controlled for collective efficacy in our models because neighbourhood cohe-\nsion and intergenerational closure may influence parents' knowledge of their chil-\ndren's delinquency. We measured collective efficacy by combining information from\ntwo subscales--social cohesion/trust and intergenerational closure--that were admin-\nistered as part of the PHDCN-CS. This collective efficacy scale was intended to capture\nadult\u00adchild social ties and expectations for support and informal social control of local\nyouth by neighbourhood adults (Browning et al. 2005). Following Sampson et al. (1999),\nwe combined the 10 items comprising these subscales into a single measure of collec-\ntive efficacy using the same IRT modelling strategy previously described (multilevel\nNeighbourhood violent crime\nTo reduce the possibility that the effect of legal cynicism on the slope of violence is\nattributable to high levels of neighbourhood violence, we controlled for the NC-level\nhomicide rate.5 We obtained incident-level homicide data from the victim-level file of\n3 We employed this IRT approach to measure key neighbourhood-level variables because the random effects in the IRT model\nadjust for unique individual- and neighbourhood-level propensities for legal cynicism. The IRT model also adjusts legal cyni-\ncism values according to the inverse of their reliability, i.e. less reliable neighbourhood values are pulled towards the grand\nmean. Neighbourhood values of legal cynicism are less reliable if they are based on either fewer valid responses to scale items\nwithin the individual or on fewer individuals within the neighbourhood (Sampson et al. 1997; Raudenbush and Bryk 2002).\n4 Our measure of collective efficacy is more theoretically relevant to our analysis--e.g. it captures parents' potential to become\naware of their children's delinquency--than is the more common collective efficacy measure, which combines the cohesion/\ntrust and informal social control subscales (Sampson et al. 1997). Nonetheless, results from analyses using the more common\nmeasure are nearly identical to those presented in this article.\n5 We use the homicide rate because this crime is measured with greater reliability than other violent crimes (e.g. robbery and\nassault).\nof homicides occurring between 1992 and 1994 to the NC level. Because a neighbour-\nhood's population size likely impacts its homicide rate, we estimated an unconditional\ntwo-level Poisson model with variable exposure based on the 1990 census-based popu-\nlation of the NC. From this model, we obtained the EB-adjusted homicide rate for\neach NC. The EB-adjusted homicide rate is the adjusted log of the event rate ratio\nper 1,000 population for each NC's three-year homicide count (Kirk and Papachristos\n2011). The major benefit of this approach is that the procedure reduces the skew of the\nhomicide count distribution while taking into account variation in population expo-\nBecause neighbours' direct experiences with violence also may alter parental\nappraisals of violence, we included two measures that capture neighbourhood resi-\ndents' experience with neighbourhood violence. Neighbourhood victimization was cap-\ntured by the following question asked of PHDCN-CS respondents: `While you have\nlived in this neighbourhood, has anyone ever used violence, such as in a mugging,\nfight, or sexual assault, against you or any member of your household anywhere in\nyour neighbourhood?' Our neighbourhood victimization measure represented the pro-\nportion of NC residents who answered affirmatively to the question. A second meas-\nure captured neighbourhood residents' perceived frequency of violence. This measure was\nbased on four indicators of whether the following events occurred `often' in the past\nsix months (0 = no, 1 = yes): (1) `a fight in this neighbourhood in which a weapon was\nused', (2) `a violent argument between neighbours', (3) `gang fights' and (4) `a robbery\nor mugging'. We combined the four items into a single measure, which equalled the\nneighbourhood-level EB-adjusted intercepts from a three-level Rasch model (multilevel\nreliability = 0.698)--that is, an extension of the IRT model that is suitable for analysing\ndichotomous outcomes (Raudenbush et al. 2003).\nSubcultural norms or attitudes condoning violence among neighbourhood residents\nalso may attenuate the positive association between violence and parental assessments\nof aggression and impulsivity. Tolerance of fighting was captured by the following ques-\ntion asked of PHDCN-CS respondents: `How wrong is it for teenagers around thirteen\nyears of age to get into fist fights?' Initial responses ranged from 1 (`extremely wrong')\nto 5 (`not at all wrong'). Our measure of tolerance of fighting represented the mean\nresponse within each neighbourhood.\nFinally, legal cynicism may be confounded with residents' perceptions of police\nresponsiveness. We, therefore, included a neighbourhood-level measure of percep-\ntions of police responsiveness, which was captured by the following question asked of\nPHDCN-CS respondents: `How much of a problem is police not patrolling the area or\nresponding to calls from the area?' Our police responsiveness measure was the propor-\ntion of respondents within each neighbourhood who answered `Somewhat of a prob-\nlem' or `A big problem' (versus `Not a problem').\nNeighbourhood structural characteristics\nWe constructed measures of neighbourhood structural characteristics using data from\nthe 1990 Census. Following past research and theory on the determinants of neigh-\nbourhood crime (Land et al. 1990), we constructed our measures using principle com-\nponents analysis with oblique rotated factor patterns of nine measures at the NC level.\nThe first principle component from the analysis, concentrated disadvantage, was domi-\nnated by the percentage of residents on public assistance, percentage of residents with\nincomes below the poverty line, percentage female-headed households, percentage\nunemployed and percentage of residents who are younger than 18. The second compo-\nnent, immigrant concentration, was defined by the percentage of foreign-born residents\nand percentage of residents who are Latino. Finally, residential stability consisted primar-\nily of the percentage of owner-occupied homes and the percentage of persons living in\nthe same house for five or more years.\nAnalytic strategy\nMissing values on individual-level independent variables were multiply imputed using\nStata's Imputation through Chained Equations (ICE) command. We use this imputa-\ntion procedure because unlike traditional methods that substitute missing values with\ncentral tendency measures (e.g. mean and mode), ICE accounts for random variation in\nresponses (Royston 2004). Following von Hippel (2007), we created ten imputed data sets\nfrom a data set that included respondents with missing data on the dependent variable.\nThese data sets comprised the aforementioned independent and dependent variables so\nthat the imputations take into account the multivariate structure of analysis models as\nwell as the associations between predictors and outcomes. In other words, this approach\nensures that the imputation and analysis models are `compatible'. We then dropped\nrespondents with missing data on the dependent variable in our final analysis models.\nAll analysis models are two-level, hierarchical linear models (HLM) estimated with\nthe imputed data sets using HLM7's multiple imputation estimation procedure. We use\nHLM because the PHDCN data are hierarchically structured. Because respondents are\nnested within neighbourhoods, they are likely to be correlated on the dependent vari-\nable; in the absence of adjustment for residual correlation among observations within\nneighbourhoods, standard errors may be biased downward. We account for clustering\nof individuals within neighbourhoods using a random effects approach (Raudenbush\nTable 2 displays results from multilevel regressions of parental assessments of aggres-\nsion on adolescent violence, and Table 3 displays results from comparable regressions\nof parental appraisals of impulsivity. For each outcome, Model 1 included adolescent\nviolence and the following individual-level control variables: age, sex, race, family struc-\nture, socio-economic status, residential tenure, parental warmth, place monitoring,\npeer monitoring, family history of arrest, support from friends, support from family,\nexposure to violence and peer violence. At the neighbourhood level, we also controlled\nfor collective efficacy, the homicide rate, concentrated disadvantage, immigrant con-\ncentration and residential stability. In Model 2, we allowed the slope of adolescent vio-\nlence to randomly vary to measure the extent of variation in the effect of this variable\nacross neighbourhoods. In Model 3, we introduced legal cynicism at the neighbour-\nhood level. Finally, in Model 4, we tested our primary hypothesis--that legal cynicism\nattenuates the positive association between adolescent violence and parental assess-\nments of related trait-based predispositions--by introducing a cross-level interaction\nbetween legal cynicism and adolescent violence. In all analyses, statistical significance\nwas assessed with two-tailed tests and robust standard errors.\nTable 2 Multilevel linear models of parental assessments of aggression regressed on adolescent violence and neighbourhood legal cynicism (individual\nVariables Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4\nIndividual\nRace/ethnicity\nNeighbourhood\n\n\naCoefficients and robust standard errors in parentheses.

Missing values on individual-level variables multiply imputed with ten replications.\nIn analyses, all individual- and neighbourhood-level covariates were grand-mean\ncentred save for adolescent violence, which was group-mean centred. We group-mean\ncentred adolescent violence to isolate within- from between-neighbourhood variation\n(Raudenbush and Bryk 2002). This allowed us to control for the possibility that the\ndifferential effect of adolescent violence across neighbourhoods is attributable neigh-\nbourhood compositional differences--e.g. little within-neighbourhood variation in\nadolescent violence but higher average levels of violence among adolescents residing in\nlegally cynical neighbourhoods--rather than contextual differences in legal cynicism.\nIn Models 1\u00ad3, the coefficient on adolescent violence, therefore, refers to the expected\ndifference in parental assessments of aggression or impulsivity for adolescents residing\nin the same neighbourhood who differ by one unit on self-reported violence. The Level\n2 intercept refers to the neighbourhood mean parental assessment value unadjusted\nfor adolescent violence but adjusted for other individual-level variables included in the\nmodel. In Model 4, the coefficient on the adolescent violence \u00d7 legal cynicism interaction\nterm refers to the effect of legal cynicism on the slope of adolescent violence within a\ngiven neighbourhood.\nResults\nParental assessments of aggression\nResults from Model 1 in Table 2 indicate that, as expected, adolescents' self-reported\nviolence is positively associated with parental assessments of aggression. We also find\nthat the age of the adolescent, family structure, parental warmth, place monitoring,\npeer monitoring and parents' support from family each is negatively associated with\nparents' assessments of their children's aggression. In contrast, exposure to violence,\npeer violence and family history of arrest each is positively associated with parental\nassessments of aggression. Coefficients on other variables in this model fail to reach\nstatistical significance at the p < 0.05 level.\nIn a model otherwise identical to Model 1, Model 2 includes a random effect on the\nslope of adolescent violence. The random effect is significant suggesting that there is\nunexplained variation in the effect of adolescent violence on parental assessments of\naggression across neighbourhood contexts (\nthis random effect, the coefficient on peer monitoring reaches only marginal statistical\nsignificance, but all the other findings from Model 1 persist.\nBuilding on Model 2, in Model 3, we added the neighbourhood legal cynicism meas-\nure at level two. Although this measure is not statistically associated with parental\nassessments of aggression, the other findings from Model 2 persist. Finally, in Model\n4, we tested the cross-level interaction between adolescent violence and legal cynicism.\nWe find that the coefficient on this interaction term is negative and significant, sug-\ngesting that neighbourhood legal cynicism attenuates the positive association between\nadolescent violence and parental assessments of aggression. Additionally, we find that\nthe random effect on the slope of adolescent violence no longer reaches statistical sig-\nnificance--that is, with the inclusion of the adolescent violence \u00d7 legal cynicism interaction\nterm, we no longer find unexplained variation in the effect of adolescent violence on\nparental assessments of aggression across neighbourhoods. This suggests that legal cyn-\nicism accounts for the random variation in the association between adolescent violence\nand the outcome across neighbourhoods. In this more inclusive model, the coefficient\non peer monitoring again reaches statistical significance at the p < 0.05 level, and the\nother findings from Model 3 persist.\nFigure 1 illustrates the interactive effect of legal cynicism and adolescent violence\non parental assessments of aggression. Predicted values along the y-axis are based on\nresults from Model 4 of Table 2 when all other variables are held at their grand means.\nValues along the x-axis refer to an adolescent's relative distance from the within-neigh-\nbourhood mean of self-reported violence. The black, grey and dashed lines represent\nthe association between adolescent violence and assessments of aggression in neigh-\nbourhoods with low (1.5 standard deviations below the mean), medium (the mean)\nand high (1.5 standard deviations above the mean) levels of legal cynicism, respec-\ntively. The black line suggests that when neighbourhood legal cynicism is low, adoles-\ncents are assessed by their parents as more aggressive if they are more violent relative\nto other neighbourhood youth. In contrast, the dashed line suggests that in neigh-\nbourhoods characterized by high levels of legal cynicism, there is little difference in\nparental assessments of aggression across levels of adolescent violence. For example,\nwhen legal cynicism is low, the predicted parental assessment of aggression score for\nan adolescent who engages in one fewer act of violence relative to the neighbourhood\nmean (3.56) is approximately 11 per cent lower than that of an adolescent who engages\nParental Assessments of Aggression\nAdolescent Violence\n(relative to the within neighbourhood mean)\nNeighborhood Legal Cynicism\nFig. 1 Predicted parental assessments of aggression by adolescent violence and neighbourhood\nlegal cynicism (predictions based on results from Model 4 of Table 2 when all other values are held\nat their grand means).\nin one additional act of violence relative to the neighbourhood mean (4.01). But when\nneighbourhood legal cynicism is high, the predicted aggression score of the less violent\nadolescent (3.72) is less than 1 per cent lower than that of the more violent adolescent\n(3.75). Thus, in highly legally cynical neighbourhoods, there is a negligible influence of\nadolescents' violent behaviour on parental assessments of their aggression. This finding\nsupports our assertion that legal cynicism encourages parents to conceptualize violence\nas situated behavioural responses to threatening contexts, rather than as indicative of\nan aggressive temperament.\nParental assessments of impulsivity\nTo further investigate whether parents' interpretations of children's behaviour are\ninfluenced by neighbourhood legal cynicism, we now turn to models of parental assess-\nments of impulsivity. In Model 1 of Table 3, we find that adolescents' self-reported\nviolence is positively associated with assessments of impulsivity, but this measure\nonly reaches marginal statistical significance in this model (p < 0.10). We also find\nthat younger adolescents are assessed by their parents as less impulsive, and boys are\nassessed as more impulsive than girls. Our results also show that compared to adoles-\ncents who are white, adolescents who are black or Latino are assessed by their parents\nas less impulsive. Family structure, parental warmth, place monitoring and parents'\nsocial support from family each is negatively associated with parental assessments of\nimpulsivity. In contrast, socio-economic status, exposure to violence, peer violence\nand family history of arrest each is positively associated with assessments of impulsiv-\nity. None of the coefficients on the other variables reaches statistical significance at\nWe added a random effect on the slope of adolescent violence in Model 2. Consistent\nwith the results on assessments of aggression, the random effect is significant, suggest-\ning that there is unexplained variation in the effect of adolescent violence on parental\nassessments of impulsivity across neighbourhoods (\nsion of this random effect, the positive coefficient on adolescent violence now reaches\nstatistical significance (p < 0.05) and the other findings from Model 1 persist.\nWe introduced legal cynicism to the neighbourhood-level equation in Model 3. The\ncoefficient on legal cynicism fails to reach statistical significance, but the other findings\nfrom Model 2 persist. Finally, in Model 4, we added the cross-level interaction between\nadolescent violence and neighbourhood legal cynicism. We find that the coefficient\non the interaction term is negative and significant. Thus, consistent with our hypoth-\nesis, legal cynicism attenuates the positive association between adolescent violence and\nparental assessments of impulsivity.\nWith the inclusion of this interaction term, we also no longer find unexplained vari-\nation in the slope of adolescent violence across neighbourhoods. Consistent with the\nresults for assessments of aggression, this finding suggests that legal cynicism accounts\nfor the random variation in the association between adolescent violence and parental\nassessments of impulsivity across neighbourhoods.\nAnalogous to Figure 1, Figure 2 illustrates the interactive effect of adolescent vio-\nlence and legal cynicism on parental assessments of impulsivity (predictions based\non results from Model 4 of Table 3 when all other variables are held at their grand\nmeans). The black line in Figure 2 suggests that where neighbourhood legal cynicism\nis low, adolescents are assessed as more impulsive if they exhibit higher levels of vio-\nlence compared to other neighbourhood youth. In contrast, the dashed line suggests\nthat where neighbourhood legal cynicism is high, there is little difference in parental\nassessments of impulsivity for relatively non-violent and violent youth. For example,\nwhen legal cynicism is low, the predicted parental assessment of impulsivity score for\nan adolescent who engages in one fewer act of violence relative to the neighbourhood\nmean (2.33) is approximately 9 per cent lower than that of an adolescent who engages\nin one additional act of violence relative to the neighbourhood mean (2.56). But when\nneighbourhood legal cynicism is high, the predicted aggression score of the less violent\nadolescent (2.45) is only 2 per cent lower than that of the more violent adolescent (2.5).\nIn summary, we hypothesized that where legal recourse is believed to be an ineffective\nor an otherwise unreasonable strategy of action, parents appraise violent behaviour as rea-\nsonable responses to conflict or threatening situations in contexts bereft of formal social\ncontrol rather than as indicative of trait-based predispositions. Consistent with this situated\nbehavioural response hypothesis, we find that the positive association between adolescent\nviolence and parental assessments of aggression and of impulsivity observed at low levels of\nneighbourhood legal cynicism becomes negligible at higher levels of legal cynicism.\nParental Assessments of Impulsivity\nAdolescent Violence\n(relative to the within neighbourhood mean)\nNeighborhood Legal Cynicism\nFig. 2 Predicted parental assessments of impulsivity by adolescent violence and neighbourhood\nlegal cynicism (predictions based on results from Model 4 of Table 3 when all other values are held\nat their grand means).\nSensitivity analyses\nWe hypothesized that neighbourhood legal cynicism modifies how parents appraise\ntheir children's violent behaviour. We found strong support for this hypothesis across\ntwo outcomes--assessments of aggression and of impulsivity. Nonetheless, we explored\nwhether other processes account for our results. Models 4 of Tables 2 and 3 are the\nbases for the following sensitivity analyses of aggression and impulsivity, respectively.\nBerg et al. (2012) and Harding (2007) suggested that disadvantaged neighbourhoods\nwere characterized by heterogeneity in cultural frames. Cultural heterogeneity in turn\nwas thought to shape violence in part because it provided a wider variety of strategies\nof action (including violence) for residents to draw upon. Following the approach of\nBerg et al. (2012) to measuring neighbourhood cultural heterogeneity with multi-item\nscales, we constructed a measure of neighbourhood heterogeneity in legal cynicism and\ntested whether it modified the association between adolescent violence and appraisals\nof aggression and impulsivity (results not shown). We fail to find that cultural heteroge-\nneity influences the slope of adolescent violence for either outcome.\nWe also performed a sensitivity analysis on each outcome to test whether the effects of\nlegal cynicism on the adolescent violence slopes are attributable to other mechanisms.\nFor each model, we introduced all remaining neighbourhood covariates--neighbour-\nhood victimization, frequency of violence, tolerance of fighting and police responsive-\nness to the neighbourhood-level intercept and adolescent violence slope equations (i.e.\nwe added cross-level interactions between each neighbourhood variable and adolescent\nviolence). We also interacted adolescent violence with the following individual-level var-\niables: residential tenure, parental warmth, place monitoring, peer monitoring, family\nhistory of arrest, support from friends and family, exposure to violence and peer vio-\nlence. Table 4 displays the results from the sensitivity analysis of parental assessments\nof aggression (Model 1) and of impulsivity (Model 2).\nThe results from Model 1 indicate that the interactive effect of legal cynicism and\nadolescent violence on parental assessments of aggression remains significant and\nincreases in magnitude after including the aforementioned individual- and cross-level\ninteractions with adolescent violence. Similarly, the results from Model 2 show that\ninteractive effect of legal cynicism and adolescent violence on parental assessments of\nimpulsivity remains significant and also increases in magnitude. Together, these results\nattest to the robustness of the interactive effects of adolescent violence and legal cyni-\ncism on parental assessments of aggressive and impulsive temperaments.\nDiscussion\nRecently, research has focused on the criminological consequences of legal cynicism--\nthe belief that legal recourse is illegitimate, unavailable or otherwise ineffective. Our\nstudy contributes to this emerging endeavour by examining the influence of neighbour-\nhood legal cynicism on parental appraisals of adolescent violent behaviour. We integrated\ninsights from symbolic interaction theory and a cultural frames approach to investigate\nthe microprocesses through which cultural frames shape interpretations of violent behav-\niour. We argued that frames not only inform strategies for resolving disputes but also\ninfluence interpretations of behaviour through the role-taking process. Specifically,\nwe proposed that legal cynicism influences behaviour appraisals by leading individuals\nto interpret violence as a central component of adolescent roles caused by contextual\nconstraints (i.e. a lack of legal recourse) rather than by individual temperaments. We,\ntherefore, predicted that when the surrounding context is characterized by higher lev-\nels of legal cynicism, parents--upon taking the roles of their children--increasingly\nwould rationalize their children's violence as situated behavioural responses to legitimate\nthreats rather than as indicative of temperamental predispositions to violence alone.\nTable 4 Sensitivity analyses of parental assessments of aggression (Model 1) and impulsivity (Model\n2) regressed on adolescent violence and legal cynicisma\nVariables Model 1 Model 2\nIndividual\nNeighbourhood\n\n\naCoefficients and robust standard errors in parentheses. Missing values on individual-level variables multiply\nimputed with ten replications.\nUsing data from the PHDCN and administrative sources, we tested our hypothe-\nsis with multilevel regressions of parental assessments of two trait-based predisposi-\ntions related to violence--aggression and impulsivity--on adolescent's self-reported\nviolence, neighbourhood legal cynicism and a cross-level interaction between the two\nmeasures. We find that legal cynicism attenuates the positive associations between ado-\nlescents' reported violence and each parental assessment outcome. Consistent with our\nhypothesis, our results, therefore, suggest that parents are less likely to appraise ado-\nlescents' violent behaviour as indicative of aggressive or impulsive temperaments when\nthe neighbourhood is characterized by higher levels of legal cynicism.\nOur findings suggest that although parental assessments of trait-based predisposi-\ntions may be influenced by children's actual behaviour, they also may be biased by\ncontextual factors. This finding is relevant to a number of prominent criminological\ntheories that focus on individual traits and temperaments to explain criminal offend-\ning. For instance, Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990) argue that low self-control is sta-\nble throughout adolescence and adulthood and is the underlying cause of antisocial\nbehaviour across the life course. Empirical assessments of Gottfredson and Hirschi's\ntheory depend upon valid measures of key constructs like impulsivity. Moffitt (1993)\nsuggests that adolescent limited offenders' delinquency is assessed differently by par-\nents and teachers because of the instability of their antisocial behaviour across time\nand social contexts. But it may be that such differential assessments in part are a func-\ntion of the frame (e.g. legal cynicism) through which appraisers view and interpret\ntheir behaviour. Given the common reliance on parental or other external assessments\n(e.g. teacher assessments) in studies of adolescent crime and delinquency (Wareham\nand Boots 2011), it is crucial to identify and control for the influence of contextual fac-\ntors on appraisals of adolescent behaviour. Identifying and controlling for such contex-\ntual biases--namely, legal cynicism--may help explain why the associations between\ntrait-based predispositions, such as impulsivity and externalizing behaviour problems,\nand adolescent crime and delinquency are inconsistent across neighbourhoods (Lynam\nOur findings also have implications for understanding processes related to adolescent\ndelinquency. Parents who rationalize violence as necessary to deter victimization may\nbe less likely to emphasize non-violent victimization-avoidance strategies and instead\nencourage aggressive posturing in order maintain street status and the respect of one's\npeers (Anderson 1999). While aggressive posturing may entail advantages within legally\ncynical residential neighbourhoods, it likely is detrimental within mainstream contexts,\nsuch as schools or workplaces, and consequently may lead to further marginalization and\nsocial isolation. Subsequent research may provide more insight into whether changes in\nparenting behaviour mediate the association between legal cynicism and delinquency\namong adolescents and their subsequent well-being throughout the life course.\nDespite our robust findings on the moderating influence of legal cynicism on the\neffect of adolescent behaviour on two parental assessment outcomes, our study is not\nwithout limitations. The data collection of the PHDCN took place in 1994 and 1995.\nUnfortunately, no subsequent neighbourhood-based study has included both the\nsophisticated sampling design and extensive neighbourhood and individual measures\ncharacteristic of the PHDCN. Although our theoretical approach is not period specific,\nfuture research using more recently collected data could assess whether the influence\nof legal cynicism on parental appraisals remains the same.\nAnother limitation of the PHDCN is that the data come from a single city. It is possible\nthat the cultural processes we examine in this study were shaped by unique attributes\nof Chicago, including its situation in the historical context of US crime patterns and\nadministration of criminal justice. The legacy of slavery, immigration policy, residen-\ntial segregation and extreme racial and ethnic disparities in criminal justice outcomes\nmay shape the importance and character of legal cynicism in US cities, especially as\nthey pertain to African Americans and Latinos. For instance, Kirk and Matsuda (2011)\nfound that in Chicago, African American-concentrated neighbourhoods had higher\nlevels of legal cynicism, which were associated with a lower likelihood of arrest follow-\ning the commission of a crime. In their study of New York City, Kirk et al. (2012) found\nthat communities with high immigrant concentration exhibited lower levels of legal\ncynicism, which were associated with increased cooperation with the police. Kirk and\ncolleagues emphasized that the lower levels of legal cynicism in these immigrant com-\nmunities could be jeopardized by aggressive enforcement of immigration laws. These\ntwo studies not only demonstrate the salience of race and ethnicity in the United States\nbut they also show that racial and ethnic differences in outcomes related to coopera-\ntion with the police are partially explained by a cultural frame--legal cynicism. The\nbroader implication, which is beyond the scope of this analysis, is that cultural frames\nsuch as legal cynicism may explain differences between the racial and ethnic groups\nrelevant to a given national or historical context.\nEven though our analysis is based on just one city, this study provides a general foun-\ndation for investigating how cultural frames shape interpretations of behaviour. So\nalthough legal cynicism may be less applicable or fundamentally different in non-US\nor rural contexts, e.g. the role-taking process through which a relevant local cultural\nframe influences appraisals of behaviour is a general process (Mead 1934) and, there-\nfore, likely has explanatory power, regardless of the larger context. Ultimately, this\nis an empirical question. Future research that includes neighbourhoods from several\nurban, suburban and rural areas within or outside of the United States can test whether\nthe results from our analysis stem from general processes or from dynamics that are\nunique to the city of Chicago. Furthermore, examining neighbourhoods across multi-\nple macro-level units would help identify how higher order factors shape local cultural\nprocesses.\nDespite its temporal and geographic limitations, the PHDCN data include exten-\nsive information on adolescents and their caregivers. But we were unable to measure\ntwo important characteristics of parents. First, primary caregivers' legal cynicism--\nwhich could represent an important mediating factor--was not measured. While the\nCS component of the PHDCN enabled more reliable measurements of legal cynicism\nin neighbourhoods, we were unable to test the influence of legal cynicism of the adoles-\ncent respondents' parents. Second, parents' knowledge of their children's delinquency\nwithin legally cynical neighbourhoods may influence their appraisals. As Rios's (2011)\nrecent ethnographic study suggests, adolescents embedded in neighbourhoods with\nhigh distrust of legal authorities may be less likely to `snitch' on fellow residents to\npolice. Restrictions against snitching may increase the likelihood that violent offenses\nremain unknown by the offenders' parents as well as other authority figures, such as\nteachers and school officials. Unfortunately, due to data limitations, we were unable\nto assess how anti-snitching norms influence parental appraisals of their children's\nviolent behaviour. Nonetheless, we tested whether related factors, such as collective\nefficacy--which captures intergenerational closure--and indicators of the parent\u00ad\nchild relationship, explained the interactive effect of legal cynicism and adolescent\nviolence on parental appraisals. We find that including interactions between these vari-\nables and adolescent violence failed to account for our findings. Still, further research\nthat directly measures parent's awareness of their children's delinquency may advance\nour understanding of the impact of legal cynicism on parental appraisals of their chil-\ndren's behaviour.\nThis study highlights the potential role police and other agents of the law have\nin changing violent contexts. Our study suggests that as cultural frame, legal cyni-\ncism induces individuals to interpret violence as a reasonable strategy to avoid vic-\ntimization or to settle grievances. But improved police effectiveness and relations\nbetween law enforcement and community residents may decrease the salience of\nlegal cynicism, thereby attenuating notions that violence is an appropriate or desir-\nable reaction to threatening circumstances. In this way, better relations between law\nenforcement and community residents could contribute to less violent and healthier\nenvironments.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National Institute of Child Health and Human\nNeighborhoods was funded by the John D. and Catherine T.
