This study measured\nthe association between IPV victimization and perpetration and prev-\nalent STIs and STI-risk behaviors among a sample of young women.\nMethods: This analysis uses wave 3 of the National Longitudinal\nStudy of Adolescent Health and was restricted to the 3548 women\nwho reported on a sexual relationship that occurred in the previous\n3 months and agreed to STI testing. A multivariate random effects\nmodel was used to determine associations between STI and STI-risk\nbehaviors and IPV.\nResults: The IPV prevalence over the past year was 32%--3%\nvictim-only, 12% perpetrator-only, and 17% reciprocal. The STI prev-\nalence was 7.1%. Overall, 17% of participants reported partner con-\ncurrency and 32% reported condom use at last vaginal intercourse. In\nmultivariate analysis, victim-only and reciprocal IPV were associated\nwith not reporting condom use at last vaginal intercourse. Perpetrator-\nonly, victim-only, and reciprocal IPV were associated with partner con-\ncurrency. Victim-only IPV was associated with a higher likelihood of\nConclusions: This analysis adds to the growing body of literature\nthat suggests that female IPV victims have a higher STI prevalence, as\nwell as a higher prevalence of STI-risk behaviors, compared with\nwomen in nonviolent relationships. Women in violent relationships\nshould be considered for STI screening in clinics, and IPV issues\nshould be addressed in STI prevention messages, given its impact on\nrisk for STI acquisition.\nIntimate partner violence (IPV), defined as physical, sexual, or\npsychological harm by a current or former partner or spouse,1\nis commonly reported among young adult heterosexual rela-\ntionships. The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nreported ever being victimized by physical IPV.2 In the same\nsurvey, 36% of women and 17% of men reported ever perpe-\ntrating physical IPV.2 Among the relationships that were re-\nported as violent, about half (52%) were reciprocally violent,\nmeaning the participant reported both victimization and perpe-\ntration of IPV. These reciprocally violent relationships were\nfound to be associated with a higher frequency of violence and\ninjury occurrence compared with relationships in which the\nviolence was unidirectional.2 In addition, the study found that\nthe woman was the perpetrator in a majority of unidirectional\nviolent relationships. This previous study offered a few expla-\nnations for this counter-intuitive finding, including that men\nmay be less likely to hit back if their partner initiates physical\nviolence such as slapping or that more severely abused women\nthat are captured in clinical studies may be excluded from\nsurvey studies.\nThere is evidence to indicate that women in abusive\nrelationships experience adverse health outcomes including\nsexually transmitted infections (STIs) and infertility.3 Several\nstudies have looked at associations with STI-risk behaviors and\nhave found that abused women are at increased risk for unpro-\ntected intercourse3\u00ad7 and partner nonmonogamy.3,8,9 Findings\nbased on the nationally representative Add Health data reveal\nthat current involvement in a verbally abusive relationship in\nadolescence was associated with not using a condom at last\nvaginal intercourse6 and that physical IPV in the most recent\nrelationship in adolescence was associated with inconsistent\ncondom use in that relationship.5 Among women in wave 3 of\nAdd Health, who are now young adults, physical abuse victim-\nization in the previous year was associated with inconsistent\ncondom use in the previous year.4\nWomen who are victims of IPV also have increased odds\nof having a history of STI.3,10\u00ad14 In one study conducted among\nwomen who completed the Massachusetts Youth Risk Behav-\nior Survey, which was a representative sample of youth in\ngrades 9 through 12, being an IPV victim was associated with\never testing for STIs or HIV and ever being diagnosed with an\nSTI or HIV.11 However, this was based on self-reported history\nof STI and did not include a currently diagnosed STI. The\nmajority of studies on IPV and sexual health outcomes have\nfocused on women as the victim of abuse. However, there is\nevidence to indicate that women are often both the perpetrators\nand victims of violence in intimate relationships.2 It is plausible\nthat women who are both IPV perpetrators and victims may\nexperience a different power dynamic in their intimate relation-\nships compared with women who are only victims and not per-\npetrators of violence; therefore, these women may exhibit different\nFrom the *Department of Epidemiology, and the Department of\nBiostatistics, University of California, Los Angeles, CA\nThis research uses data from Add Health, a project directed by\nKathleen Mullan Harris and designed by J.
