However, formal\ntesting of logged BPAconcentrations ad-\njusted for age, sex, and urinary creati-\nnine concentrations showed no signifi-\ncant differences between the categories\n(data available from the authors on re-\nquest). Although a possible explana-\ntion for our findings is that the in-\ncreased dietary intakes associated with\nobesity also result in higher intakes of\nBPA and consequent morbidity, the ob-\nserved disease and liver enzyme changes\nwerepresentafteradjustingforbothBMI\nand waist circumference. Crucially, the\nassociation with GGT was present after\nexcluding overweight and obese partici-\npants. An association of BPA concentra-\ntion with GGT concentration also was\npresent in those without cardiovascular\ndisease or diabetes, suggesting that \"re-\nverse causation\" (in which the pres-\nence of these diseases might have led to\ngreater exposure or to some form of al-\ntered BPA excretion) is also unlikely.\nExposure to BPA also might be an in-\ndicator of exposure to multiple xenobi-\notics, including other endocrine disrup-\ntors--but, as presented, adjustment for\notherenvironmentalphenolsandknown\nxenoestrogensincluding4-tert-octylphe-\nnol and triclosan made no difference to\ntheobservedoutcomes,suggestingaspe-\ncific effect mediated by BPA. We also\nhave explored a range of alternative ap-\nproaches to accounting for the sam-\nplingdesign,thedistributionofBPAcon-\ncentrations,andthecorrectionofurinary\ncreatinine concentrations (see eSupple-\nment at http://www.jama.com), all of\nwhich point to our results being robust.\nThe main limitation of our analyses is\ntheir cross-sectional nature: longitudi-\nnal data demonstrating that high BPA\nconcentrationspredictlateronsetsofbio-\nchemical change or diagnoses would\nstrengthen the evidence. A further limi-\ntation is that we have examined a broad\nhypothesis of associations between\nhigher BPA concentrations and adverse\neffects on health status, including tests\nof association with 8 major diagnostic\ngroupings (with 3 questions each about\ncardiovascular and respiratory condi-\ntions) and 8 blood-based assays. Our ap-\nproach, justified by this being the first\nlarge-scale study, may have resulted in\nfalse-positive associations. Although\nfalse-positive inverse associations be-\ntween BPA concentrations and out-\ncomes were theoretically as likely, none\nwere found.\nIndependent replication is now\nneeded to confirm the associations re-\nported. Because our analyses are based\nonurinaryconcentrationsofBPA,which\nreflect recent exposure, studies based on\nrepeat measurements over weeks,\nmonths,orevenyearswouldimprovethe\nassessment of longer-term exposure.\nGiven the many routes of exposure to\nBPA, direct measures of dermal contact\nor of contact with contaminated foods,\nbeverages, and dusts would be very dif-\nficulttoundertake.Afurtherissueisthat\nalthough the previous animal-model lit-\nerature provides evidence of the mecha-\nnisms underlying effects on liver cells\n(and therefore liver enzymes) and insu-\nlin signaling (and therefore diabetes, as\npreviously discussed), the mechanisms\nunderlying the effect on prevalence of\ncardiovascular disease are not obvious.\nIf the associations reported here are con-\nfirmed in independent studies, more\nwork will be needed to identify the\nmechanisms of action linking long-\nterm, low-dose BPA exposure to ad-\nverse outcomes in humans. Given the\nsubstantial negative effects on adult\nhealth that may be associated with in-\ncreased BPA concentrations and also\ngiven the potential for reducing human\nexposure, our findings deserve scien-\ntific follow-up.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUsingdatarepresentativeoftheadultUS\npopulation, we found that higher uri-\nnary concentrations of BPA were asso-\nciated with an increased prevalence of\ncardiovascular disease, diabetes, and\nliver-enzymeabnormalities.Thesefind-\nings add to the evidence suggesting\nadverse effects of low-dose BPA in ani-\nmals.
