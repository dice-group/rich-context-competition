Ogunniyi1,2, Janet B. Croft2, Kurt J. Greenlund2,Wayne H. Giles2 and George A. Mensah2\nBackground\nMicroalbuminuria, a biomarker of endothelial dysfunction, is\nassociated with increased cardiovascular, renal, and cerebrovascular\nmorbidity and mortality, especially among ethnic minorities.\nMethods\nA total of 16,567 adults in the National Health and Nutrition\ncategorized according to JNC 7 blood pressure (BP) definitions.\nMicroalbuminuria was defined as spot urinary albumin/creatinine\nratio (ACR) of 30\u00ad299mg/g. Logistic regression estimated the odds\nof having microalbuminuria among BP categories compared with\nnormal BP after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, sex, education level,\nsmoking status, body mass index (BMI), systolic BP, and diabetes.\nResults\nPrevalence of microalbuminuria was 4.5% for normal BP, 6.3%\nstage 2 hypertension, and 11.3% among those with treated,\ncontrolled hypertension. Compared with participants with normal\nBP, the adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)\nP < 0.01) with treated, controlled hypertension.The treated controlled\nhypertension group exhibited the strongest race\u00adethnicity gradient.\nConclusions\nParticipants with hypertension and prehypertension had a higher\nlikelihood of microalbuminuria than those with normal BP, especially\nethnic minorities, suggesting greater target organ damage. Our\nobservations suggest that further research is necessary to determine\nwhether microalbuminuria can be used as a screening tool in\nadults with prehypertension, to identify adults at highest risk for\ncardiovascular disease or decline in renal function.\nKeywords:bloodpressure;ethnicity;hypertension;microalbuminuria;\noriginal contributions Microalbuminuria by Hypertension Status\nreleased in 2-year increments. Informed consent was obtained\nand approval for the survey granted by the National Center\nfor Health Statistics Research Ethics Review Board. Data were\n\ncollected in two steps: a home interview followed by a detailed\nphysical examination and laboratory tests in a mobile exami\nnation center.\nfor inclusion in our study after we excluded pregnant women\n(n = 1,082), and adults with missing values due to item non\nresponse for BP (n = 760), urinary albumin and/or urinary\ncreatinine (n = 382) or both (n = 195). In addition, data for\nparticipants whose body mass index (BMI) (n = 301), \nsmoking\nstatus (n = 18), and education level (n = 25) could not be\ndetermined due to item nonresponse were excluded from the\nappropriate analyses.\nMeasurement of BP, urinary albumin, and creatinine concen-\ntrations. Licensed physicians measured participants' BP in the\nmobile examination center according to the American Heart\nAssociation's standardized protocols.12 Participants who\nreported currently taking any antihypertensive medication,\nhad an average systolic BP of 140mmHg, or had an average\ndiastolic BP of 90mmHg were classified as having hyper\ntension. The mean of all available BP readings was used for\nthis analysis. BP was then categorized according to the JNC\nBP was classified as normal if the average systolic BP\nwas <120mmHg and the average diastolic BP was <80mmHg.\nPrehypertension was defined as an average systolic BP of\nHypertension was further classified into two stages: stage 1\nan average diastolic BP of 90\u00ad99mmHg) and stage 2 hyper\ntension (an average systolic BP of 160mmHg or an average\ndiastolic BP of 100mmHg). A higher category for classifi\ncation was used if the systolic BP and diastolic BP levels fell\ninto different categories. Participants taking antihypertensive\nmedications were defined as having their BP controlled if\ntheir systolic BP was <140mmHg and their diastolic BP was\n<90mmHg. Persons taking antihypertensive medications were\ndefined as stage 1 hypertension if their systolic BP was between\n99mmHg; otherwise they were defined as stage 2 hyperten\nsion if either value exceeded that cut point.\nUrinary albumin and creatinine concentrations were meas\nured according to established protocol.13 The spot \nurinary\nalbumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) was measured in milli\ngrams per gram (mg/g) and classified as normal (ACR <30),\nmicroalbuminuria (ACR 30\u00ad299), and macroalbuminuria\nSelected characteristics of the study population. Socio\ndemographic information about participants was obtained\nby interviews conducted in the participants' homes. Age was\ndocumented at the screening interview. Race was determined\nby self-reported responses to race and ethnicity was defined\naccording to Hispanic origin. Race/ethnicity was then cate\ngorized by NHANES as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nblack, Mexican American, or all other (other Hispanics,\nAsians, Native Americans, or participants who self-reported\nas more than one race/ethnic group). Smoking status was\ndefined as never smoked, current smoker (i.e., participants\nhave smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and are still smok\ning), and former smoker (i.e., participants have smoked at\nleast 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes but do not smoke now).\nAnthropometric dimensions were obtained by a trained exam\niner and used to calculate BMI (weight in kg divided by height\nin m2). BMI was then classified as underweight (<18.5kg/m2),\nm2).14 Diabetes mellitus was defined by self-\nreport of physician diagnosis of \"diabetes or sugar diabetes\" or\ncurrent use of medications for diabetes mellitus.\nStatistical analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted with\nSAS software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The data\nwere weighted appropriately by using mobile examination\ncenter examination sampling weights to adjust for population\ndistribution and nonresponse. An 8-year weight variable was\ncomplex sampling design of NHANES with SUDAAN software\n(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). All\ntests were based on a statistical significance level of P  0.05.\nA detailed description of the survey and its sampling tech\nniques has been published elsewhere.15\u00ad18 Differences in\nselected characteristics among the BP groups were compared\nby 2-tests. Multivariate logistic regression was used to esti\nmate the odds and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for micro\nalbuminuria among JNC 7 categories compared with normal\nBP after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, sex, education level,\nsmoking status, BMI, and the presence of diabetes melli\ntus (defined as self-report of physician diagnosis of \"diabetes\nor sugar diabetes\" or current use of medications for diabetes\n\nmellitus). A second multivariate model added systolic BP to\nthe other covariates to determine whether racial or ethnic dif\nferences observed in participants with higher BP levels also\ncould account for any observed differences in microalbu\nminuria on the basis of race or ethnicity. For racial or ethnic\ncomparisons among the hypertension and prehypertension\nsubgroups, \nmultivariate logistic regression models included\nparticipants of races/ethnicities other than non-Hispanic white\n(the \nreferent), non-Hispanic black, and Mexican American,\nbut the results were not reported.\nResults\noriginal contributions\nMicroalbuminuria by Hypertension Status\ntreated controlled, BP levels. The characteristics of the four BP\nstages as well as the treated controlled hypertensives are shown\nin Table 1. The proportions of young participants (<45 years),\nparticipants with >12 years of education, and current smokers\ndeclined with higher BP category (Table 1). The proportion of\nnon-Hispanic blacks increased with BP levels. Prehypertension\nand stage 1 hypertension categories had greater proportions of\nmen (61.3 and 51.7%, respectively) than other BP categories.\nOverall, the prevalence of microalbuminuria was 4.5%\nwith controlled, treated hypertension (Table 2).\nCompared with participants with normal BP, the adjusted\nodds ratios and 95% CI for participants with \nmicroalbuminuria\n2.1, P < 0.01) for treated, controlled, hypertension.\nThe prevalence of microalbuminuria increased among all\nracial/ethnic groups (all P < 0.05) with increasing BP \nlevels\n(Figure 1). When the magnitude of the differences in the\n\nprevalence of microalbuminuria between participants with\nuncontrolled hypertension and participants with normal BP\nlevels was compared, we observed an approximately fourfold\ndifference among non-Hispanic whites (P = 0.0001), a fivefold\ndifference among non-Hispanic blacks(P = 0.0001), and a six\nfold difference among Mexican Americans(P = 0.0001).\nMultivariate logistic regression model 1 (Table 3), which\nincluded age, race/ethnicity, sex, education level, smoking\nstatus, BMI, and presence and presence of diabetes (defined\nTable 1| Selected characteristics of the study population by blood pressure categories,NHANES (1999\u00ad2006)\nCharacteristic\nNormal BPa\nPre-HTNb\nStage 1 HTNc\nStage 2 HTNd\nTreated,\ncontrolled HTNe\nAge(years)\nRace/ethnicity\nEducation(years)f\nSmokingstatusf\nBodymassindex(kg/m2)f\nBP, blood pressure; HTN, hypertension; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\n159mmHg or average diastolic BP of 90\u00ad99mmHg). dStage 2 hypertension (average systolic BP 160mmHg or average diastolic BP 100mmHg).

Similarly, higher odds\nratios were obtained for those with treated, controlled hyper\ntension, and uncontrolled hypertension. In multivariate logis\ntic regression model 2 (Table 3), systolic BP was included as a\ncovariate in addition to the covariates included in model 1. In\nthis model, the magnitude of racial or ethnic differences among\nnon-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans remained the\nsame for the treated, controlled hypertension group, but was\nreduced in the uncontrolled hypertension group (Table 3). We\nconducted a formal test of interaction of race\u00adethnicity and BP\ncategories and there was no interaction (P = 0.45).\nDiscussion\nNHANES participants with hypertension and prehypertension\nhad higher odds of having microalbuminuria than participants\nwith normal BP. We observed that 6.3% of participants with\nprehypertension already had evidence of kidney damage in the\nform of microalbuminuria. Participants with prehypertension\nhad 30% greater odds of microalbuminuria than participants\nwith normal BP. A higher prevalence of microalbuminuria\nwas observed among ethnic minorities with hypertension and\nprehypertension than among non-Hispanic whites in these\nBP categories. The finding that the adjustment for systolic BP\nreduced the odds ratio for microalbuminuria among Mexican\nAmericans and non-Hispanic blacks supports the argument\nthat racial and ethnic minorities may have higher BP levels and\ngreater target organ disease. After adjusting for differing levels\nof systolic BP, the odds of having microalbuminuria among\npersons with hypertension remained significantly higher\namong racial and ethnic minorities. This finding suggests that\nother factors, such as access to health care or comorbidities,\nalso may play a role in this excess risk.\nSeveral NHANES studies also have examined the asso\nciation between microalbuminuria and various conditions,\nsuch as diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hypercholesterolemia,\n\nhepatitis C, and elevated C-reactive protein.19\u00ad23 The preva\nlence of microalbuminuria was 13.4% for stage 1 hypertension\nand 25.3% for stage 2 hypertension in the present study. This\nfinding is similar to the documented prevalence of microalbu\nminuria among adults with hypertension, which ranges from\nA strong relationship between microalbuminuria, BP level,\nand increased risk for renal and cardiovascular disease among\npersons with established hypertension has been previously\ndescribed in several cross-sectional and clinical studies.3,24\u00ad26\nAlthough microalbuminuria is listed as a major cardiovascular\nrisk factor in JNC 7,6 most practicing physicians screen only\nNormal Prehypertension Treated, controlled\nhypertension\nUncontrolled\nhypertension\nRace/ethnicity\nNHW\nNHB\nMA\nMicroalbuminuria (%)\nFigure 1 | Prevalence of microalbuminuria by selected blood pressure\nbPrehypertension (average systolic BP of 120\u00ad139mmHg or average\ndiastolic BP of 80\u00ad89mmHg). cTreated, controlled hypertension (taking\nantihypertensive medications, average systolic BP <140mmHg and average\ndiastolic BP <90mmHg). dUncontrolled hypertension (average systolic\nBP 140mmHg, an average diastolic BP 90mmHg, taking antihypertensive\nmedications).

The detection of\nmicroalbuminuria, a biomarker of cardiovascular risk may\nprompt consideration for earlier screening in this group of\nprehypertension.\nAlthough several cohort and clinical studies have examined\nassociations between microalbuminuria and hypertension, our\nstudy is the first to report racial and ethnic variations in micro\nalbuminuria among defined JNC 7 BP categories in addition\nto the treated, controlled hypertension group. Knight et al.9\nexamined the association between high-normal BP (systolic\nthe basis of JNC 6 classification and microalbuminuria. They\nfound that high-normal BP was associated with increased\nodds of microalbuminuria.9 Although we used the JNC 7 as\nopposed to the JNC 6 classification, we also demonstrated that\nadults with prehypertension had higher odds of microalbu\nminuria. In our study, among persons with either hypertension\nor prehypertension, both non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican\nAmericans had higher odds of developing microalbuminuria\nthan non-Hispanic whites.\nPrevious studies that stratified by the presence of diabetes in\nthe NHANES population showed that racial and ethnic minori\nties had greater odds of microalbuminuria compared with\nwhites.11,19 No comparisons were made between hypertension\ncategories. In our analysis, we adjusted for the presence of dia\nbetes rather than stratify because of small numbers; our results,\nhowever, remained significant, although the effects of diabetes\non microalbuminuria may be underrepresented in Mexican\nAmericans in our analysis. A major strength of our study is\nthat NHANES is a nationally representative sample of the US\nnoninstitutionalized population. However, because NHANES\nis a cross-sectional survey, we could only examine associations\nand could not determine causality. In addition, we combined\nlation with a sizeable representation of racial and ethnic groups.\nThe limitations of our study include the use of spot measure\nments of urinary albumin and creatinine. These measurements\nmay differ because of laboratory and intraperson variability\nand by sex and ethnicity.27 In addition, persistent microalbu\nminuria also has been used as a measure of chronic kidney\ndisease.28 However, the use of spot ACR is recommended by\nJNC 7 as a reliable measurement of albuminuria.6 As a cross-\nsectional study, the detailed history of hypertension of the\nindividual respondent is not known. For example, a partici\npant with untreated hypertension for several years, resulting in\nrenal dysfunction in form of microalbuminuria, may now have\ncontrolled BP.\nAs expected, those with treated, controlled hypertension\nhad lower prevalence of microalbuminuria, even though, still\nhigher compared to normal BP, indicating the importance of\nearly treatment.\nOur observations indicate that adults with prehypertension\nand hypertension may require earlier screening and pharma\ncologic intervention for microalbuminuria. Rapid progression\nfrom prehypertension to hypertension can occur over 4 years,\nas seen in the Framingham study;29 therefore, early screening\nfor microalbuminuria, especially in adults with prehyperten\nsion and stage 1 hypertension, may be beneficial. This approach\ncould identify adults who may need earlier pharmacologic\nintervention with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or\nangiotensin receptor blocker treatment and clinical follow-up,\nthus preventing the progression of microalbuminuria.\nGiven that the current treatment recommendation for\npatients with prehypertension is the adoption of a healthy\nTable 3| Race/ethnicity-specific prevalence of microalbuminuria among participants with prehypertensiona and hypertensionb,\nRace/ethnicity n Percentage (%)\nModel 1 Adjusted\nodds ratioc (95% CI) P value\nModel 2 Adjusted\nodds ratiod (95% CI) P value\nParticipantswithprehypertension\nParticipantswithtreated,controlledhypertension\nParticipantswithuncontrolledhypertension\nCI, confidence interval; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\naPrehypertension (average systolic BP of 120\u00ad139mmHg or average diastolic BP of 80\u00ad89mmHg). bUncontrolled hypertension (average systolic BP 140mmHg, an average diastolic\nBP 90mmHg, taking antihypertensive medications). cTreated, controlled hypertension (taking antihypertensive medications, average systolic BP <140mmHg and average diastolic\nBP <90mmHg). dMultivariate logistic regression model 1 included age, race/ethnicity, sex, education level, smoking status, body mass index, and diabetes as covariates.
