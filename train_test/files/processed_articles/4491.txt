So-called mobile health (mHealth) apps have\ndrawn much attention from researchers who are inter-\nested in their applicability in clinical or research prac-\ntices; as such, they are understandably concerned about\nthese apps' claims with regard to medical truthfulness,\nvalidity, or accuracy. Much less attention has been paid\nto mHealth platforms as techno-economic construc-\ntions in the context of a global online infrastructure.\nAs media scholars, we are interested in establishing a\nframework for understanding the claims and complex-\nities involved in the online dynamics in which health\nplatforms are entangled. Such approach requires a con-\nstructivist view that examines online dynamics at the\nintersection of technology and society.\nWe will concentrate on a double-edged logic\ninscribed in these platforms, promising to offer personal\nsolutions to medical problems while also contributing\nto the public good. On the one hand, online platforms\nserve as personalized data-driven services to their cus-\ntomers. On the other hand, they allegedly serve public\ninterests, such as medical research or health education.\nIn doing so, many apps employ a diffuse discourse,\nUniversity of Amsterdam, The Netherlands\nCorresponding author:\nJose\n\u00b4 Van Dijck, University of Amsterdam, Turfdraagsterpad 9,\nAmsterdam, Noord-Holland 1012 XT, The Netherlands.\nEmail: j.van.dijck@uva.nl\nBig Data & Society\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nbds.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons NonCommercial-NoDerivs CC-BY-NC-ND: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Com-\nmons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/) which permits\nnon-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work as published without adaptation or alteration, without further permission provided the\noriginal work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nhinging on terms like ``sharing,'' ``open,'' and ``reuse''\nwhen they talk about data extraction and distribution\n(Fiore-Gartland and Neff, 2015). Equally confusing is\nhow platforms deploy terms like ``communities'' and\n``partners'' when they refer to customers or (corporate)\nassociates in data handling. So how do privatized pre-\nrogatives tally with claims that they serve the public\ngood?\nTo set up an analytical framework, we will first define\nwhat we mean by ``platforms'' as a technical, economic,\nand sociocultural framework for managing online traffic.\nSecond, we will argue how their dynamics are inscribed\nnot just in individual platforms but also more generally in\nthe ecosystem of connective media (Van Dijck, 2013). The\nanalysis concentrates on two aspects: datafication (the use\nand reuse of data), and commodification (a platform's\ndeployment of governance and business models). We\napply these analytical categories to three specific plat-\nforms: 23andMe, PatientsLikeMe (PLM), and\nParkinson mPower (PmP). Each of these platforms\nemploys the logic of private gain versus public good,\nbut their claims are different as they operate from differ-\nent organizational premises.\nThe last section will connect these individual exam-\nples to the wider implications of health apps' data\nflows, governance policies, and business models.\nRegulatory bodies commonly focus on the (medical)\nsafety and security of apps, but pay scarce attention\nto health apps' techno-economic governance. Who\nowns user-generated health data and who gets to bene-\nfit? We argue that it is important to reflect on the soci-\netal implications of health data markets. Governments\nhave the duty to provide conceptual clarity instead of\nadding to confusing propositions in the grand narrative\nof transforming health care and health research.\nThe promises and premises of online\nhealth platforms\nOver the past 10 years, researchers, patients, and doctors\nhave discovered major social network sites (Twitter,\nFacebook, Google\u00fe) as platforms for health communi-\nSantillana et al., 2014). Recently, there has been a spec-\ntacular growth in the development of specific health and\nfitness apps: online services that promise to advance the\nhealth, fitness, and physical or mental well-being of\nusers. mHealth platforms actively distribute apps and\nmobile devices that solicit all kinds of health data--clin-\nical data, performance data, experiential data--that deli-\nver personal information to patients, doctors, and\nresearchers (Adibi, 2015). Data generated from individ-\nuals--the healthy and the sick, the fit and the frail--is\nautomatically aggregated, analyzed, and processed in\norder to inform a variety of services.\nWe are using the term ``platform'' here to refer to\nonline sites that facilitate and organize data streams,\neconomic interactions, and social exchanges between\nusers. Platforms, in this sense, are neither mere tech-\nnical constructs, nor does the term refer to all things\ndigital (Bogost and Montfort, 2009). Platforms are sim-\nultaneously technological, economic, and sociocultural\nconfigurations (Gillespie, 2010). Their owners and a\nwide variety of other societal actors assemble them;\nthese actors include users, but also companies that\nrely on online infrastructures and data. Platforms are\nmade available through websites and apps.1\nAll online platforms are mutually connected through a\nshared technological infrastructure, which is fueled by\ndata, directed by algorithms, and structured by govern-\nance protocols and business models. This ecosystem of\nconnective platforms, which is crucial for each app's\nwidespread distribution and global reach, is not a level\nplaying field: some major platform operators in this eco-\nsystem (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and\nMicrosoft) are more powerful than others. When we\nspeak of a platform infrastructure for online services,\nwe refer to the complex interaction between users, prac-\ntices, technologies, and business models--a combination\nof human and nonhuman actors. Health platforms and\nthe apps they produce form a rapidly growing field within\nthis ecosystem; other sectors, for instance the transporta-\ntion or hospitality sectors, are confronting a similar devel-\nopment, in which many platforms compete for users and\nattention, with Uber and Airbnb in the lead.\nOnline health platforms constitute a wide-ranging\none end of the spectrum, there are fitness apps that\nare mostly used for tracking a person's physical per-\nformance and condition; examples include Fitbit,\nStrava, and Runkeeper. On the other end, we identify\nmedical apps that are meant for (self-) diagnosis of\nsymptoms or conditions (e.g., 23andMe, Doctor\nDiagnose, WebMD, Virtual Doctor). In between\nthose two ends are various categories. Patient experi-\nence exchange platforms serve simultaneously as\npatients' social networks and data exchanges; examples\ninclude PLM, CureTogether, Health Unlocked, and\nAlliance Health (Lupton, 2014b). Health monitoring\nplatforms help individuals monitor vital signs or symp-\ntoms of disease; examples include apps for weight loss\n(Lose It), sexual activity (SexPositive), sleep cycles\n(Sleep Diary), pregnancy (What to Expect), glucose\nlevels for diabetics (Glucosio, Glucose Buddy), or\nsymptoms of Parkinson disease (PmP). This typology\nis neither exclusive nor exhaustive, but it serves to illus-\ntrate the broad range of platforms that are currently\nbeing developed.\nThe growth of health apps is being driven by a power-\nful set of arguments that can be regarded as a ``discursive\n2 Big Data & Society\nregime'' informing a commons sense logic (Kitchin,2014:\n113). Health apps often promise to offer personal solu-\ntions to medical and lifestyle challenges--a healthier life-\nstyle, a quick diagnosis, a proper monitoring device, a\nspeedy update, a form of peer support, etc.--while also\ncontributing to the public good--for instance, improving\npublic health, educating a general audience, or contribut-\ning to medical research. Articulating this double-edged\nlogic, it often remains unclear whom gets served by\ndata-based platforms: individuals, communities, private\nindustries, researchers, or society as such. The dual claims\nare often articulated in a diffuse rhetoric, where terms\nsuch as ``sharing,'' ``open,'' ``transparency,'' and\n``reuse'' seem to be ambiguous, thus propelling different\nagendas. As Rob Kitchin (2014) argues, the discursive\nregime of Big Data is ``to offer a radically new way of\nunderstanding and managing all aspects of human life''\n(p. 114). In this article, we will examine how the ``big\npromise'' of public good and private gain is taking\nshape as part of a wider struggle over how a data-\ndriven platform society should be organized.\nDigital platforms are also driven by a powerful set of\nmechanisms, two of which we would like to highlight\nhere: datafication and commodification.2 Datafication\nis the most fundamental underpinning principle of\nhealth platforms: it means that every aspect of one's\nphysical or mental well-being is translated into data--\nvital signs, objective measurements, subjective experi-\nences, medicine intake, personal information, test\nresults, etc.--and subsequently can be transformed\ninto new kinds of value (Mayer-Schoenberger and\nCukier, 2013). Data can be private and personal (e.g.,\nrecorded symptoms, experiences) or they can be public\nand collective (e.g., clinical research data, health demo-\ngraphics, statistics); data can be user-generated and\nreported automatically through devices, such as elec-\ntronic heartbeat apps, or users themselves can contrib-\nute data consciously, for instance through deploying\npedometers. The question at stake here is what kinds\nof (user) data do platforms collect, how do they collect\nthem, and how do they process and reuse those data?\nCommodification refers to the way in which datafied\ninformation is transformed into (monetary) value. In\nmost cases, this means we will look at business\nmodels of online platforms, which act as strategic medi-\nators in the process of turning personal data into valu-\nable goods. Some platforms sell health information\nproducts to customers sometimes in combination with\nadvertisements; other apps are free to users in exchange\nfor their personal data, which may be shared with\npaying industrial partners or copatients. Looking at\nthe governance and ownership of health platforms, we\nhave to conclude that mHealth platforms are\noverwhelmingly for profit. Virtually all platforms col-\nlaborate with partners, mostly high-tech firms and\npharmaceutical or medical equipment companies;\nsome also partner with universities, government ser-\nvices, or a combination thereof, mixing for profit and\nnonprofit. A minority of health platforms is operated\nvia government or nonprofit organizations, intent on\npursuing public values and yielding public goods.\nThe question here is which business model is used for\nwhat purposes, who owns and operates the platform,\nand who gets to benefit from its products?\nIn the sections below, we will examine the ambigu-\nous claims by analyzing three digital health plat-\nforms: 23andMe, PLM, and PmP. 23andMe was\nlaunched as a medical app that is marketed for\nprofit. PLM is a patient experience exchange platform\nthat is ``not-just-for-profit.'' And PmP is a health\nmonitoring app, which is nonprofit and intent on pro-\nviding data to researchers. In the next three sections,\nwe will analyze how the rationality of personal solu-\ntions and public good becomes manifest through the\nlens of its underpinning mechanisms--datafication\nand commodification. To what extent does it matter\nthat the three online services operate on the basis of\ndifferent economic and organizational premises? Is it\npossible, in this ecosystem of online platforms, to\ndevelop noncommercial platforms based on key\npublic values? To address these questions and find\ninformation about each site's operation and intention,\nwe have examined their explicit platform policies as\nwell as interviews with owners or operators in general\ninformation sources and trade journals.\nThe platform 23andMe started as a personal genome\nservice in 2006, offering customers worldwide a record\nof their DNA profile. Data is collected both offline and\nonline. The offline method is for customers to send in a\nbit of saliva through a special kit; after paying a fee,\nthey receive a complete overview of their genetic\nmakeup, including a risk report stating their personal\nchances for genetic disease and conditions. Besides the\ncommercial offline transaction of genetic data, the com-\npany approaches customers online to submit phenotype\ndata through ``fun'' questionnaires that pop up on your\nscreen. The additional data allegedly help to compile an\neven more accurate profile of one's personal state of\nhealth. On the website we can read:\nPart of 23andMe's mission is to give people access to\ntheir DNA, and this is just another way to put that\ninformation at people's fingertips. Over time we hope\nto improve the app as we get more feedback from cus-\ntomers. Along with giving customers access to their\nDNA, 23andMe wants to educate people about the sci-\nDijck and Poell 3\nData is collected from customers on two different\ngrounds: the promise of receiving a validated genetic\nprofile as well as the promise of donating their genotype\nand phenotype data to help genetic research in general\nThe first promise turned out to be a dubious prop-\nosition. In 2013, the American Food and Drugs\nAdministration (FDA) banned the test kits because\nthey were giving customers inaccurate information\nbased on misleading predictive algorithms. As a result\nof this setback, the platform dropped the medical com-\nponent and shifted its focus from diagnosis to ancestry\nidentification. 23andMe currently features a ``genome\ncompass app'' in the Google Play store and urges its\ncustomers to find out ``what your DNA says about you\nand your family.'' However, the platform's website still\nhints at its underlying aim to deliver personalized pre-\ndictive medicine. In 2014, after slightly changing its\nrhetoric, the company sought approval from the\nBritish Health Authority (MHRA) who then argued\nthat the kit was no longer marketed as a diagnostic\ntest but as an ``information product.'' As a result,\n23andMe can ship the test kit to customers residing in\nthe UK and 50 other countries all over the world\nglobal guidance for standards reviewing a product's\nclaims, each company can look for a regional or\nnational market whose regulatory policies allow it to\nThe second promise that users' genetic information\nwill be used towards the public interest is part of the\n23andMe's rhetoric slips smoothly from notions of per-\nsonalized health care to a celebration of ``consumers''\nresearch participation as a form of ``gift exchange.''\nAccording to the website, the gift of saliva enables med-\nical researchers to find genetic patterns and treatments\nfor a number of diseases. 23andMe also appeals to\nusers' need for solidarity in pursuing health-related\ngoals. The site instills in its customers the noble goal\nof giving away their DNA--a sense of collectivity that\nemerges independent from the idea of forming a com-\nmunity. According to the site, donating personal health\ndetails allows researchers, in the long run, to detect\npatterns of genetic aberrations and develop algorithms\nto predict and prevent disease at the individual level.\nEven after the FDA's mandated discontinuation of\n23andMe's medical diagnostic prerogatives, the\ngrander research-oriented goal still echoes on the web-\nsite now promoting its ``health and ancestry'' app:\nWe are building a powerful, diverse, and ever-growing\nresource for research that combines advances in genetic\nanalysis with the power of the Internet.. . . So when you\nsend in that DNA sample, you're not only learning\nabout yourself, you're joining a community of motivated\nindividuals who can collectively impact research and\nbasic human understanding. (23andMe Core Values,\nHowever, the altruistic motives for participating in\ngenomic sequencing efforts, solicited by appealing to\nthe customer's inclination to ``collectively impact\nresearch'' are misleading. ``Collective community''\nimplies there is a kind of active patient group involved\nin this effort, which sharply contrasts 23andMe's pro-\nprietary claims on these data. In May 2012, the com-\npany was granted a patent for ``polymorphisms\nassociated with Parkinson's disease,'' sparking a con-\ntroversy among its clients who felt misled (Sterckx\n``tricked'' into donating their data to a company that\nsubsequently monetized their data gifts? The same can\nacquired CureTogether--a patient experience exchange\nsite much like PLM--incorporating the data from com-\nmunities reporting on some 600 medical conditions.\nWhile 23andMe appears to be part of a gift exchange\nwhere users participate in research, they are in fact part\nof a data exchange where individual data is turned into\neconomic value: data is gathered not with the prime\nintention to make them public goods but to privatize\nThis brings us to 23andMe's business model, which\nclearly hinges on two principles. First, it sells ``genetic\nprofile service kits'' to customers, whom are charged\nbetween $99 and $199. Second, by sending their saliva\nsamples, customers sign away the right to sell their\ninformation to third parties; in other words, 23andMe\nhas a right to sell and repurpose its users' data for\nfinancial gain (Sterckx et al., 2013). When the FDA's\nban on the company's medical claims substantially hurt\nits revenue stream based on the first model, 23andMe\nshifted its marketing strategy to commoditize its lucra-\ntive by-product: raw genetic data which can be mone-\ntized by giving drug companies access to its resources.\nIn January 2015, pharmaceutical company Genentech\nDNA profiles of patients with Parkinson's disease\n23andMe's multisided business model is fully\nattuned to the larger ecosystem of connective plat-\nforms, by distributing its apps through the Google\nPlay Store. The strategy to find the most profitable\nrevenue model for a single health app very much\ndepends on its integration in the app ecosystem of plat-\nforms (Ragaglia and Roma, 2014). The choice for\nGoogle is not coincidental; Google was one of\n23andMe's first financial investors. Moreover, the plat-\nform's owner, Anne Wojcicki, is also the (ex-)wife of\n4 Big Data & Society\nSergey Brin, Google's cofounder and executive. Major\npharmaceutical companies and medical product\ndevelopers have since invested substantially in\n23andMe. Investors envision a future where combin-\nations of health databases are the prime resources for\npatentable drugs and treatments. In May 2015,\n23andMe announced it would go into drug discovery\nand development. The business model thus evolved\nfrom consumer testing service to drug developer,\nbased on the premise of turning user-generated individ-\nual data into corporately owned private goods. Hence,\nthe appeal to users to donate their personal data to\nresearchers for the benefit of the ``public good'' is a\nrather dubious claim, as the donation goes straight\ninto a proprietary platform that monetizes its data\nresources for corporate (rather than public) gain.\nPLM\nThe double ambition to serve personalized health\nschemes while enhancing the public good also surfaces\nin patient experience exchange site PLM\n(PatientsLikeMe.com, 2015). PLM encourages patients\nto keep track of their personal conditions by uploading\nfacts about their symptoms, vital signs, and medicine\nintake, and also to report more subjective information,\nsuch as experienced pain levels, mood fluctuation, emo-\ntional impact, or side effects. Through the website,\nusers can keep detailed reports, replete with graphs\nand charts, and take them to doctors' visits. PLM is\nnot just used for compiling personalized health reports,\nbut also for exchanging information and advice, and\nfor soliciting support from fellow sufferers. The site pri-\nmarily focuses on creating so-called communities of\npatients: individuals suffering from the same disease\ncan make sense of their data by comparing symptoms,\ncourse of their condition, and effectiveness of treatment\nrelative to other patients. They can call on each other\nfor help and support in disease-centered patient assem-\nblages. So besides taking the form of structured infor-\nmation, datafication of patients' personal illness also\ntakes place through narrative accounts.\nHow does PLM gather their data from patients? Most\ndata collected on this site are solicited from individual\nusers through various interface prompts and incentives.\nIndeed, analyzing self-reported data may be useful for\nexamining patients' perceived side effects; the online pro-\ncess of self-reporting data enables the accumulation of\nindividual scores. The site deploys so-called patient-\nreported outcome measures (or PROMs) to quantify\nthe patient experience. Such self-reported data on symp-\ntoms, vitals, treatment, and effects serve to find perso-\nnalized remedies, for instance to systematically screen\nfor signs of depression, to help patients ``capture pain\ntrends between doctor visits'' or to help people ``choose\nbetween surgical options'' (PatientsLikeMe, 2015). PLM\nrewards members who frequently update their informa-\ntion with ``stars''; obtaining three stars means you\nreceive a free t-shirt with the PLM logo.\nPLM also collects data by invoking a sense of soli-\ndarity between patients to entice them into data shar-\ning; the interface organizes its users around disease\ncategories, ranging from diabetes to cancer and from\nALS to depression. When PLM talks about ``commu-\nnities'' it is referring to its patient-support function\nwhere patients can exchange information about their\ndisease to get peer support in return. It is important\nto note that, while PLM may provide individual\nempowerment to patients suffering from the same dis-\nease, they do not in principle provide collective\nempowerment in the way that activist patient groups\npursue (Wentzera and Bygholm, 2013). As Deborah\nLupton (2014a) found in her research, many health\nplatforms claim to serve communities:\nWhile some apps may feature the opportunity to people\nto engage with a community of like-minded individuals\nwho are attempting to achieve the same ends, very few\nare directed at broader social change or activist politics\nin the spirit of the new public health. (p. 615)\nIt is important to distinguish the ``community'' appeal\nto ``share'' personal experiences and private data from\nthe potential of pursuing collective aims or contributing\nto the public good.\nThe site's contribution to health as a public good\ncomes in the form of the claim that PLM data inform\na new research paradigm. All personal data generated\nthrough the platform, combined with known medical\ndata on specific conditions, form the input for\naggregate data sets that researchers may use to find\ncures and effective treatments for any ailment.\nAccording to its home page, ``PatientsLikeMe aggre-\non 2,300 diseases, analyzes them, and shares the results\nwith health care and life science companies to accelerate\nresearch and develop more effective treatments''\n(PatientsLikeMe, 2015). PLM's philosophy of ``open-\nness'' starts from the idea that sharing ``patient-\nreported outcome measures'' with companies and\nresearchers leads to potential treatments and cures.\nSelf-reported data constructs the foundation for ``evi-\ndence-based medicine'' resulting in personalized health\ncare and treatment. Data is not just collected from labs,\nuniversity halls, or doctors' offices, but from the every-\nday lives of patients who diligently report their scores\nand fill out the standardized forms provided by PLM.\nPLM claims that the site helps patients select and\nreport health data not just to seek personalized\ninformation and treatment, but also for the greater\nDijck and Poell 5\ngood: to provide researchers with relevant testing mater-\nial (PatientsLikeMe Data for Good, 2015). The idea of\npatient-driven health research, using patients' self-\nreported data for clinical testing, has gained traction\nover the years. In 2010, PLM used its patient networks\nto test a scientific hypothesis propelled by Italian\nresearchers who suggested that lithium carbonate\nmight slow down the symptoms of ALS. About 160\nuser patients obtained the drug and started to self-\ntrack their progress through PLM-validated rating\nscales. In less than nine months, this patient-led effort\nled to a refutation of the claim originally made by the\nItalian scientists--a refutation that was confirmed much\nlater by three conventional clinical trials. The results\nwere published in an open access academic paper, com-\nplete with data sets and statistical analysis (Wicks et al.,\n2011). Patient-led efforts to generate experiential data,\naccording to PLM executive Paul Wicks, prove that\nthis new type of ``citizen science'' can complement\nlarge-scale, longitudinal clinical research by conducting\nobservational research ``on the fly.''\nNot unexpectedly, medical researchers have\nresponded critically to PLM's validity claim: how\nvalid are the results put forward by this new scientific\nparadigm propelled by a health platform and by user\ndata? Detractors argue that sites like PLM fundamen-\ntally breach the protocols of medical research by allow-\ning a group of self-selected patients self-administering\ndrugs or treatment to self-report results without\nproper protocols that guarantee double-blind testing\nor control groups (Gorski, 2012). Whereas proponents\nlike Wicks laud the qualities of speed and direct\ninvolvement of patients, criticasters like Gorski warn\nthat such patient-driven trials, relying on massive quan-\ntities of subjective data, are unscientific experimenta-\ntions that benefit neither science nor patients. The\nbelief in the objectification of self-reported data\nshould not distract from solid scientific paradigms\nsuch as double-blind testing, he argues. A side effect\nof this paradigm shift towards user-generated,\ndemand-driven data-based health research might be\nthat it puts the onus of scientific evidence in the\nhands of patients, according to Gorski.\nThe discursive logic of PLM equates user-generated\ndata with user engagement and parallels patient commu-\nnities with ``citizen scientists'' for the benefit of medical\nresearch. How does this relate to PLM's commodifica-\ntion strategy, its business model, and governance?\nAccording to its homepage PLM is a ``for-profit com-\npany (with a not-just-for-profit attitude).'' The platform\npresents itself in its promo-video as a patient-centered\nsite; obviously, it has no products to sell like 23andMe's\npersonal genome service kit, so it positions itself as a\npatient experience site--patients helping each other\nand themselves with information and tracking. PLM\ndoes not allow advertising on its site; however, it does\nsell ``research services'' which means they sell aggre-\ngated, anonymized data to third parties.\nIn contrast to 23andMe, PLM is very explicit about\nits intention to sell its users' health data to partners\nsupporting the platform, which are all listed on their\nwebsite (PatientsLikeMe Partners, 2015). These part-\nners include the world's leading pharmaceutical compa-\nnies, medical device makers, and research institutions.\nHow PLM goes about selling data and contracting part-\nners is not described in detail. In all fairness, the website\nexplicitly warns their users about potential exploitation\nof submitted personal data, about example by ``medical\nand life insurance companies who have clauses that\nexclude pre-existing conditions or employers may not\nwant to employ someone with a high-cost or high-risk\ndisease.'' Most PLM users will not read these details;\nbut unlike many other sites, PLM does not hide this\ninformation in small print user-license agree-\nments--agreements that no one ever reads and which\ncan be changed without a user's consent.\nIn line with its ``not-just-for-profit attitude,'' PLM\nhas to walk a fine line between patient's trust and its\nmonetizing intentions (Sillence et al., 2013). The site's\ninvitation to ``donate your data for good'' and to ``make\nhealthcare better through sharing, support and\nresearch'' reveals an ambiguous claim towards opening\nup private health data to benefit the public good. On the\none hand, PLM presents itself as a proponent of open\ndata; the platform developed an online tool called the\nOpen Research Exchange--a tool that allows for the\nprototyping, testing, and validation of patient-reported\noutcome measures, questionnaires that measure symp-\ntoms and impact (PatientsLikeMe Open Research\nExchange, 2015). However, ``open data'' in the context\nof PLM does not mean that anyone can use them; you\nhave to become a ``partner'' in order to reprocess data\ndonated by patients--to turn data into validated know-\nledge or as input for new drugs or devices.\nCompared to 23andMe, the ``not-just-for-profit''\nplatform PLM explicates its commercial goal to turn\ndata into economic value; the qualifier ``not-just''\nbefore ``for-profit'' refers to its function as a patient\nexperience forum and its support for health research.\nUnlike the genome service, PLM defines communities\nas patient groups exchanging information about dis-\neases, even if they do not rally around collective inter-\nests. In terms of donating data to the public good, PLM\npromotes active participation of users in research. In\nother words, users are addressed as consumers,\npatients, citizen-scientists, and partners, all at the\nsame time. The fusion of the platform as an experience\nexchange, a data exchange, and a research exchange is\ncemented in a dual nonprofit and for-profit business\nmodel. The term ``research exchange'' is equally\n6 Big Data & Society\nambiguous, as it turns out to mean that only (listed)\nresearch partners who pay for the privilege can use the\ndata. Before we turn to the implications of this\nambiguity, let us first look at a site that makes similar\npromises from different organizational premises.\nThe third platform in our sample analysis solicits patient\ndata through a health-monitoring app called PmP. Part\nof a broader research program, PmP is a ``patient-cen-\ntered iPhone app-based study of symptom variation in\nParkinson's disease'' that helps monitor actual patients'\nsigns in real time (Parkinson mPower, 2015). Such signs\ninclude assessing or measuring tremor, balance,\nmemory, and gait before and after taking medication.\nUsing Apple's ResearchKit, researchers gather data\nfrom participants through easy-to-complete surveys via\ntheir iPhones. The study collects additional data\nreported by patients themselves, including automated\nphysical measurements from wearable devices and\nassessments through online surveys or designated tasks.\nUnlike PLM, PmP uses no reward motivators for indi-\nvidual patients, such as gamification elements or t-shirts\n(Lister et al., 2014). PmP requests full names, e-mail\naddresses, and identity, to make sure they are dealing\nwith real persons, and it uses the digital equivalent of a\nconsent form. The site subsequently anonymizes a user's\nidentity from its data; even though they warn for poten-\ntial data breaches, they guarantee users' privacy.\nClearly, the app's prime focus is explicitly on gather-\ning research data that will ultimately help all patients\nsuffering from this disease. As the website claims:\nBy participating in this study you will help us learn the\nrange of PD [Parkinson's disease] symptoms and find\nout whether mobile devices can help measure PD pro-\ngression and manage these symptoms better. In this\nunique study you will be a partner in the research pro-\ncess. (Parkinson mPower, 2015, emphasis added)\nAccording to its principal investigator, the reason to\nrun these studies is ``to see whether we can turn anec-\ndotes into signals, and by generating signals find win-\ndows for intervention'' (Business Wire, 2015). Scientists\nare in great need of precise real-time information about\nthe various Parkinson's signals to better their under-\nstanding of disease phenotypes. Research data in PmP\nis gathered in a structured fashion as part of a medical\nresearch framework, even if the researchers do not pre-\nsume to know exactly beforehand what data to collect\non the basis of a prespecified thesis, ``but instead to\nwork with patients to learn about the disease, with\nthe app serving as an intermediary'' (Business Wire,\n2015). Patient users are primarily addressed as\n``research partners'' in this online clinical study.\nThere is no explicit promise of helping individual\npatients or providing a platform for support and inter-\naction; what is learned from user-generated data is later\nreported back in the form of a ``dashboard'' that allows\npatients to track their personal disease progress.\nData collection through mobile devices such as an\niPhone will likely change the practice of clinical trials. It\nis becoming increasingly normal to automatically track\none's vital signs, and PmP smoothly fits the larger trend\nto constantly wear monitoring apps to datafy every\nmovement of an individual--as part of the emerging\n``sensor society'' (Andrejevic and Burdon, 2015). As\none of the leading researchers points out, having\n20,000 participants in an app-based study can generate\nmore specific information than most clinical trials that\nAnd instead of collecting data from patients every\ncouple of months, iPhones can collect data every few\ndays or even hours. Data collection on PmP differs\nfrom PLM because its researchers predefine the param-\neters of standardized tests. Researchers would stand to\nbenefit most from patients' massive ``gift'' of personal\ndata; the only promise patients get in return is that\neventually, in the long run, their data might contribute\nto (personalized) treatment or cure.\nHow does PmP's prime aim of contributing data to\nthe public good of Parkinson's research tally with its\nbusiness model and data governance? The platform is\npart of a consortium, including medical researchers\nfrom Rochester University, UC San Francisco and\nheaded by Sage Bionetworks, which is a ``nonprofit\nbiomedical research organization, founded in 2009,\nwith a vision to promote innovations in personalized\nmedicine by enabling a community-based approach to\nscientific inquiries and discoveries'' (Business Wire,\n2015, emphases added). The organization is funded\nby foundational grants, and there is no identifiable\nbusiness model, neither to monetize data nor to capit-\nalize on research results--confirming its status as a\nnonprofit. Sage Bionetworks' grander claim is to ``acti-\nvate patients and to incentivize scientists, funders and\nresearchers to work in fundamentally new ways in\norder to shape research, accelerate access to knowledge\nand transform human health'' (Business Wire, 2015,\nemphasis added). In other words, the platform can be\nsquarely positioned in the nonprofit health sector,\nwhich means that data will only be used for research\npurposes. This does not mean, however, that PmP sub-\nscribes to the ``open data'' philosophy, meaning that\nanyone (researchers and companies) can freely access\nand reuse. We will return to this point shortly.\nAn interesting additional aspect of its nonprofit gov-\nernance and business model is the fact that PmP uses\nApple ResearchKit for the distribution of its app.\nDijck and Poell 7\nApple ResearchKit is a recently developed hub for\nresearchers poised to function as data broker; intro-\nduced by Apple as an open source software framework,\nit allows researchers to create apps for medical\nresearch. ResearchKit works seamlessly with Apple's\nHealthKit--a service to store one's personal health\ndata in a secure location where the user can decide\nwhich data can be shared. Through HealthKit,\nresearchers can access more relevant physical data for\ntheir studies, such as calorie use, heart rates, step\ncounts, etc. Integration in the Apple ecosystem of\napps implies both an opportunity and a limitation.\nAn opportunity because researchers can connect its\nresearch data to ``vital signs'' collected through\nHealthKit. A limitation because users of iPhones are\nby definition coming from restricted demographic,\nage, and gender backgrounds. Moreover, integrating\nPmP with the wider ecosystem of major private plat-\nforms means data principally become owned and repur-\nposed by Apple. As gatekeepers of all kinds of data, not\njust health and fitness, these large data exchanges allow\nfor endless opportunities to combine and reuse stored\ndatabases. Apple's HealthKit, like Google Fit, auto-\nmatically collects all types of health data from sensors\nbuilt into their respective smartphones and other\ndevices. In the future, it is not unthinkable that tech\ncompanies may operate central storing and processing\nlocations for health data in the cloud.3 It is thus impos-\nsible for individual platforms such as PmP to operate\nindependent from the general ecosystem's mechanisms\nof datafication and commodification; they are\n``entangled'' in this larger apparatus, an ``assemblage\nof technological innovations, and the social uptakes\nBoth PmP and ResearchKit are nonprofit organiza-\ntions that allegedly serve the public good, but what\nexactly do they mean by using the ``partner'' in relation\nto their patient contributors, and the term ``open'' with\nregards to their data? Of course, the very word ``part-\nner'' is misleading in this context: patients donating\ntheir data are not participating on equal terms with\nresearchers. They are data subjects and research sub-\njects at the same time. Moreover, the word ``partner-\nship'' is confusing because often times it refers to\ncompanies or research organizations that are indeed\ncollaborators in a trial. The same ambiguity applies\nto ``open.'' Neither Sage Bionetworks nor Apple\nResearchKit (despite its use of open source software)\nsubscribes to the open data principle, which is a prin-\nciple and standard that is increasingly promoted by\ngovernments and institutions in the public sector.\nOpen data means that data is not proprietary, but\ncan be reused by any (app) developer or researcher.\nIn the larger ecosystem of connective platform, it is\nvery difficult to define who ``owns'' data or even who\ngets access to them and in what form. How data are\nused and which analytics are applied remains opaque to\nconsumers and citizens. According to Nosowitz (2015),\nmost apps claim to contribute to the world of open data\nand to serve the greater good, but they cannot or do not\nwant to explain to users what happens with their data\nin the Big Data universe.\nHealth platforms as a field\nof contestation\nThe double-edged logic inscribed in mHealth plat-\nforms--to offer personal solutions to medical problems\nwhile also contributing to the public good--is part of a\nwider struggle over how a data-driven platform-based\nsociety is and should be organized (Rich and Miah,\n2014). As we have argued in the previous sections, the\nrhetorical strategies deployed by health platforms are\nstrikingly similar, in spite of their different aims or mis-\nsions. All platforms use terms like ``open,'' ``sharing,''\n``communities,'' and ``partners'' to convince patients to\nvolunteer their precious personal data. They are\nseduced by promises of personalized health advice,\nlured by communal forms of information and experi-\nence exchange, and simultaneously called upon to per-\nform their civic duty to donate their data. Evidently,\n23andMe, PLM, and PmP operate from distinctly dif-\nferent organizational premises (for profit, not-just-for-\nprofit, and nonprofit), but their promises are conspicu-\nously similar: they want to transform medicine into\npersonalized health care with the intention to serve\nthe public good. When looking at mHealth platforms,\nwhat are the wider socioeconomic implications\ninvolved in this grand narrative?\nFor one thing, the notion of health care as a public\ngood for private gain is nothing new: US hospitals and\nthe health care industry have profited from the appro-\npriation and reuse of patients' data for decades. What is\nnew in this era is the automated collection of large data\nflows and the potential to combine health information\nwith many other data types. Individual platforms\nhave mounting power to collect and trade voluminous\ndata sets, and the emergence of dominant data bro-\nkers makes all individual platforms prisoners of the\nlarger connective ecosystem. A score of online broker\nplatforms such as Validic, Fitabase, Open mHealth--\nbesides Google's Fit and Apple's HealthKit--serve as\nconnectors between databases and algorithms. Each of\nthese brokers aims to make data streams interoperable,\nand while some are depending on open source software,\nvery few of them, including the ones that operate on a\nnonprofit basis, aim at sharing all data with all individ-\nual users. There is a growing divide between those who\nhave access to, and control of, data flows and those\nwho have not. The ``big data divide'' as Andrejevic\n8 Big Data & Society\n(2014) argues, aggravates ``the asymmetric relationship\nbetween those who collect, store, and mine large quan-\ntities of data, and those whom data collection targets''\nThe power of corporate data brokers is growing at\nthe expense of collectives and publics, despite the rhet-\noric of individuals as ``partners'' in research.\nGovernments and public institutions are running\nbehind in defining what counts as public good in a\ndatabased and algorithmically driven ecosystem.4\nLocal and national legislators are currently sorting\nout important issues involved in the proliferation of\nmHealth platforms. Understandably, regulatory\nbodies primarily focus on the medical safety and secur-\nity of health apps (Hamel et al., 2014; Treacy et al.,\nimportant concerns tackled by regulators on both sides\nof the Atlantic. Some critics argue that regulatory agen-\ncies focusing on safety, security, and privacy are miss-\ning out on the larger implications of the proliferating\nmHealth sector as they are ill equipped to address fun-\ndamental issues such as open versus proprietary data or\ncollective resources vis-a\n` -vis privatized benefits (Seife,\nIndeed, it takes a broader socioeconomic and eth-\nical\u00adlegal approach to address such issues and anchor\ncrucial definitions into society's governance. The ques-\ntion of who ``owns'' data, after all, is a complex and\nconvoluted one because it pertains to a bundle of rights:\nthe rights of individuals to control one's own data; the\nrights of companies to collect, aggregate, and mine\nthem; the right to trace data back to the data subject,\nto name a few. Such profound reflections on the ``own-\nership'' of health data are important when weighing\nsocietal values against economic values in a quickly\nemerging global market of Big Data flows. In recent\nyears, the ``platformization'' of the health sector pro-\npelled by mechanisms such as datafication and com-\nmodification has triggered responses from both civic\ngroups and governments to regain control in a ``big\ndata knowledge economy'' (Ruppert et al., 2015;\nVolkmer, 2014). Civic groups such as the Open\nKnowledge Foundation have called for ``open data''\ndefined as data that ``can be freely used, modified,\nand shared by anyone for any purpose'' (Open\nGovernments have also called for ``open data''; how-\never, their use of the phrase ``open'' is again different\nfrom the meanings we have identified above.\nAccording to the US government, ``open data'' basically\nmeans the freedom to create economic value out of data\ncollections; in the United Kingdom, open data is con-\nsidered instrumental in procuring citizens' access to\naffordable services, such as health care or education.\nAmerican and European governments have both started\ntheir own ``open data'' initiatives. The American gov-\nernment, through its Health Data Initiative, aims to\nmake large numbers of public data sets available to sci-\nentific institutions and industry innovators.5 They\nencourage private companies to monetize open health\ndata, developing new patentable products. The British\ngovernment started Genomics England in 2013, a com-\npany that is fully owned and operated by public institu-\ntions, hospitals, and researchers all coordinated by the\nNHS (Genomics England, 2015). Genomics England\na UK genomics industry and start a personalized med-\nical service. Both the American and British initiatives\nsomehow confound ``open'' with ``public'' data, which\nis not the same: public is more restricted than ``open.''\nConceptual clarity is often the enemy of popular\nrhetorical persuasion. As we have noticed in all three\nsampled platforms, frequently used normative concepts\nare loaded with ambiguity: ``communities,'' ``partners,''\n``public good,'' ``open,'' ``sharing,'' ``exchange,'' etc.\nThe paradox of private benefit and public good in rela-\ntion to health care platforms thrives on the fuzziness of\nthese terms. The problem is that most concepts are still\ncemented in a predigital system of institutional govern-\nance in which corporate, private, government, and non-\ngovernmental sectors were clearly separated--an ideal\nthat has never actually existed and which has further\ndisintegrated over the past decades. The three mHealth\nplatforms analyzed in this article are symptomatic of a\ndiscursive regime that seeks to persuade people into\naccepting not only the promise of transformative\nhealth care, but also the societal premises on which\nthis logic is erected. It is important to expose such fuzzi-\nness in the promotional discourse of the mHealth\nsector. Many word pairs--open data and public data,\npatient communities and research partners, personal gain\nand public good--are used as interchangeable terms,\nbut they do not pertain to the same set of normative\nvalues and ideals. Governments have the obligation to\nstipulate conceptual clarity instead of adding to confus-\ning propositions in the grand narrative of transforming\nhealth care and health research. Citizens need alterna-\ntive models of trust for app reviews that are sustainable\nand free of conflicts of interest (Powell et al., 2014).\nIf we regard the emerging sector of online health\nplatforms as a field of contestation that is still under\nconstruction, it is important to look beyond the utili-\ntarian regulatory scope that most governments are cur-\nrently envisioning and understand the technical and\nsocial dynamics underpinning the ecosystem. We also\nneed to develop a more comprehensive view of the pol-\nitical consequences of a global platform society that\ngoes beyond deconstructing digital newspeak. The\nontological distinction between open data and propri-\netary data, the normative division between public and\nDijck and Poell 9\nprivate, and the legal difference between nonprofit and\nfor profit are the implicit premises on which the double\nlogic is built. But these diffuse premises do not warrant\nthe promises of a revolution in mHealth care. Whereas\nlegislators are commonly called upon to redefine such\nontological and normative standards, their power\nseems weakened in the face of an emerging global eco-\nsystem of online platforms whose techno-economic\ndynamics appear to operate autonomously. It takes\nthe concerted efforts of citizens, governments, respon-\nsible scientists, and entrepreneurs to secure the checks\nand balances in the organization of health care in a\nfuture platform society.\nNotes\n1. The term ``app'' is used as shorthand for ``application.''\nAn app is a more specific term than the term ``platform.''\nAn application causes a computer to perform tasks for\nusers in order to interact with a data system on a device\n(e.g., a mobile phone or a laptop). One platform can thus\nissue a number of apps, for different devices or for various\ntypes of users (e.g., data professionals, patients, health\nprofessionals, etc.). Please note: in this article, we some-\ntimes use ``health apps'' as shorthand for their platforms.\n2. These two mechanisms are extensively described as part of\nan analytical framework in Van Dijck and Poell (2013).\n3. In that respect, Amazon also counts as an important cen-\ntral hub in the ecosystem. Amazon Cloud Service, like\nGoogle Genomics, offers to store and analyze large gen-\nomic data sets.\n4. The European Commission is still working on the legisla-\ntion of mHealth apps; the European Medicines Agency,\nand the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory\nAgency are expected to introduce guidelines regulating\nmobile medical apps similar to the FDA (Green Paper\n5. The Health Data Initiative's goal is to make more and\nmore data from HHS vaults (from CMS, CDC, FDA,\nand NIH, to name a few sources) easily available and\naccessible to the public and to innovators across the coun-\ntry. This information includes clinical care provider quality\ninformation, nationwide health service provider direc-\ntories, databases of the latest medical and scientific know-\nledge, consumer product data, community health\nperformance information, government spending data,\nand much more.\nReferences\nAdibi S (ed.)
