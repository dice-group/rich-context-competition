Connors, Jr, MD; for the SUPPORT Investigators\nBackground: Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a\ncommon disease with high health care costs and high\nmortality rates. Knowledge of the health-related qual-\nity of life outcomes of CHF may guide decision mak-\ning and be useful in assessing new therapies for this\npopulation.\nMethods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in-\nvolving 1390 adult patients hospitalized with an acute\nexacerbation of severe CHF (New York Heart Associa-\ntion class III-IV). Demographic data and health-related\nquality of life were determined by interview; physi-\nologic status and cost and intensity of care were deter-\nmined from hospital charts.\nResults: The median (25th, 75th percentiles) age of pa-\nvival was 93.4% at discharge from the index hospitaliza-\ninterviewed at 180 days, the median health rating on a\ndependent in their activities of daily living. Overall qual-\nity of life was reported to be good, very good, or excel-\ncapacity were more likely to die. Health perceptions\namong the patients with available interview data im-\nproved at 60 and 180 days after acute exacerbation of se-\nvere CHF.\nConclusions: Patients hospitalized for acute exacer-\nbation of severe CHF have a generally poor 6-month\nsurvival, but survivors retain relatively good func-\ntional status and have good health perceptions. Fur-\nthermore, health perceptions improve after the acute\nexacerbation.\n(CHF) is a common dis-\nease in the United\nStates, with a prevalence\nthere are an estimated 1 to 2 million\nadults with CHF at any time in this\ncountry,2 and the prevalence is on the\nrise.3 Hospitalization rates for CHF also\nhave been increasing.3 Despite the high\ncost of health care for patients with\nCHF, survival rates are poor. Knowl-\nedge of the health-related quality of life\n(HRQL) outcomes of severe CHF may\nguide decision making and be useful in\nassessment of new therapies for this\npopulation.\nMost previous studies reporting out-\ncomes of CHF were performed in stable\ngated outcomes of patients hospitalized\nwith CHF, but did not report HRQL out-\ncomes. Recently, there has been an in-\ncrease in interest in HRQL among pa-\ntients with CHF.30-33 Two large clinical\ntrials used HRQL measurements as an end\npoint to assess therapy for CHF.15,19 How-\never, there have been no large prospec-\ntive studies describing HRQL, change of\nHRQL in time, or survival among adults\nhospitalized due to severe CHF.\nOur purposes were to describe pa-\ntients whose primary reason for hospital-\nization was acute exacerbation of severe\nCHF and to determine the outcomes of\nthese patients in terms of mortality, HRQL,\nand use of resources.\nRESULTS\nFrom the Departments of\nMedicine at the following\ninstitutions: MetroHealth\nMedical Center, Case Western\nReserve University, Cleveland\n(Drs Jaagosild and Dawson, and\nMr Thomas) and the University\nof Cincinnati Medical Center,\nCincinnati (Dr Tsevat), Ohio;\nUniversity of California Medical\nCenter, Los Angeles\n(Dr Wenger); University of\nVirginia School of Medicine,\nCharlottesville (Drs Knaus and\nConnors); Duke University\nMedical Center, Durham, NC\n(Dr Califf); University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco\n(Dr Goldman); and Marshfield\nMedical Research Foundation,\nMarshfield Clinic, Marshfield,\nWis (Dr Vidaillet).

At 60 days after study entry, interview data were\nnot available for 237 patients (17.0%) who died before inter-\notherreasons.Vitalstatusat1yearwasavailableforallpatients.\nMEASUREMENTS\nPatients' physiologic status was evaluated using the Acute\nPhysiology Score component of the Acute Physiology and\nChronic Health Evaluation III, which is an ordinal scale\nconsisting of weights assigned to 17 physiologic measure-\nments.41,48,49 The Acute Physiology Score has a possible range\nof scores from 0 to 252; increased scores are strongly as-\nsociated with an increased risk for death. The Glasgow Coma\nScale50 was used to assess patients' neurologic status.\nPatients' activity status was measured using the modi-\nfied Duke Activity Status Index (DASI).42,51,52 This measure\nof functional capacity gauges the patient's ability to per-\nform common activities and uses the responses in a weighted\nscore. The possible range is from 11 (unable to walk in-\ndoors) to 33 (able to do vigorous exercise or aerobics).51,52\nThe Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) is a measure of per-\nceived health status, with a score ranging from 0 to 100. A\nhigher score describes worse health. The SIP has been found\nto be valid and reliable53 and was used to provide a more de-\ntailed measure of health status at the 60-day interview.43\nPatients'functionalstatus,ie,theirlevelofperformance\nof basic activities of daily living (ADL), was measured using\nthe modified Katz Index of Activities of Daily Living (Index\ngradesreflectdependenceinthefollowing7primaryself-care\nfunctions:bathing,dressing,toileting,transferring,continence,\nfeeding, and walking (1 point for each dependency).54,55\nHealth perception was assessed using several instru-\nas excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor.

Utility was measured by the\ntime-tradeofftechnique,whichascertainstheamountoftime\nin excellent health one would equate with living 1 year in the\npatient's current state of health.45 General health status scales\nand health utility may measure different attributes of health58\nHospital resource use was assessed using the modi-\nfied Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS).43,60,61\nHigher TISS scores indicate higher intensity of hospital re-\nsource consumption. The total cost of care in 1993 dollars\nwas estimated by converting total charge to total cost using\neach hospital's cost-charge ratio.

All rights reserved.\nin the \"Subjects and Methods\" section, we substituted\nHRQL data to increase the available sample size and to\ndecrease possible bias associated with the correlation of\ndisease severity and missing data.\nIt is often difficult to compare HRQL of patients with\nCHF across studies because there is no agreement about\nstrict criteria for CHF, and because the HRQL measures\nused are not always the same. The instruments used in this\nstudy(DASI,SIP,IndexofADL,generalhealthstatusscales,\nand health utility) have been shown previously to be valid\nlimited to patients with severe CHF. We do not know\nwhether outcomes would be different in patients with less\nsevere disease. In addition, only 5 large teaching hospitals\nparticipated in the study; therefore, the results may not be\ngeneralizabletopatientsseeninsmallerornonteachinghos-\npitals or nursing homes or to patients with exacerbation\nof CHF who are not hospitalized. The racial distribution\nof the study patients, however, is similar to that of the gen-\neralUSpopulation.72 Arecentpopulation-basedstudy73 sug-\ngests that patients who were enrolled in SUPPORT tended\nto be younger and male, had fewer ADL impairments, and\nexperienced lower mortality rates compared with patients\nwith similar severity of disease from the same geographi-\ncal area who were not enrolled into the study.\nOur study provides insight into hospital resource\nuse, HRQL, change of HRQL in time, and survival of a\nlarge patient population hospitalized for acute exacer-\nbation of severe CHF. These data demonstrate that pa-\ntients hospitalized with acute exacerbation of severe CHF\nhave a generally poor prognosis for survival during the\nensuing 6 months, but survivors have relatively good func-\ntional status and health perceptions. Furthermore, the\nhealth perceptions improve among survivors after acute\nexacerbation of CHF. Patients with worse functional ca-\npacity are more likely to die, however. The results of our\nstudy are more generalizable to those (generally younger)\npatients who receive a more aggressive approach (in-\ncluding hospitalization) for exacerbation of CHF.\nSupported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,\nPrinceton, NJ.\nThe opinions and findings contained in this article are\nthose of the authors and do not necessarily represent the\nviews of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation or its Board\nof Trustees.\nPresented at the Society of General Internal Medicine\nReprints: Neal V.
