    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjectives: Ephrin type B receptor 4 (EphB4, Eph receptor) selectively binds ephrin B2 (Eph\nligand). EphB4/ephrin B2 is involved in embryonic vessel development, vascular remodelling and\npathological vessel formation in adults (including tumour angiogenesis). Binding of vascular\nendothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A to the endothelial-specific receptor VEGF receptor-2 is the\nmain extracellular signal triggering angiogenic response. Little is known about the role of EphB4/\nephrin B2 during angiogenesis and arteriovenous plasticity in cerebral arteriovenous malformation\n(cAVM). This study investigated EphB4 and ephrin B2 expression in cAVM.\nMethods: Haemorrhagic (H-AVM) and nonhaemorrhagic (NH-AVM) specimens of AVM nidus,\nobtained after microsurgical cAVM resection, and normal superficial temporal artery (STA)\nspecimens, were analysed retrospectively. VEGF-A, EphB4 and ephrin B2 expression were studied\nby immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting.\nResults: In cAVM (10 H-AVM; 10 NH-AVM), VEGF-A was immunocytochemically localized to\nendothelial cells; strong endothelial cell staining was found for EphB4 in veins and ephrin B2 in\narteries. Normal STA (n \u00bc 10) did not express EphB4 or ephrin B2. EphB4 and ephrin B2\nexpression was greater in H-AVM than in NH-AVM.\nConclusions: Endothelial cells are more active in H-AVM than NH-AVM. EphB4 and ephrin B2\nplay important roles in neovascularization and arteriovenous differentiation/plasticity. These data\nprovide new insights into the aetiology of cAVM and lay a foundation for further study. The notch\npathway induced by VEGF-A may be a key signalling pathway in this process.\n",

Ephrin B ligands,\nwhich possess a transmembrane and a cyto-\nplasmic domain, are tyrosine phosphory-\nlated on receptor binding, which induces\nephrin reverse signalling in addition to\nreceptor forward signalling.5 This type of\nsignalling establishes the mechanistic basis\nof junction formation between arterial and\nvenous endothelial cells through the restric-\ntion of cellular intermingling.6,7 EphB4 and\nits cognate ligand ephrin B2 play important\nroles in embryonic vessel development and\nvascular remodelling.8\nCerebral arteriovenous malformations\n(cAVMs) comprise tangles of abnormally\nformed blood vessels, and are an important\ncause of intracranial haemorrhage and\nseizure in young adults.9 They are histo-\npathologically characterized by the pres-\nence of a nidus, consisting of a\nconglomerate of tortuous vessels lacking\ncapillaries, an arterial feeder and a drain-\ning vein.10 cAVMs have long been thought\nto arise from developmental derangements\n(at the embryonic, fetal or early postnatal\nstage of vessel formation), whereby abnor-\nmal vascular formation results in contin-\nued vascular remodelling due to a chronic\nincrease in blood flow during postnatal\ngrowth.11\u00ad13 Their course cannot easily be\npredicted; they may remain static, grow or\neven regress. Angiogenesis and arterioven-\nous plasticity therefore play important\nroles in the formation and development\nof cAVMs. Several reports suggest that\nEphB4/ephrin B2 is also involved in patho-\nlogical vessel formation in adults, including\nknown about its role during angiogenesis\nor in arteriovenous plasticity in cAVM.\nThe purpose of this retrospective study was\nto explore the expression of EphB4 and\nephrin B2 in cAVM.\nPatients and methods\nThis study was approved by the Ethics\nCommittee of Beijing Tiantan Hospital,\nCapital Medical University, Beijing. All\nindividuals providing data for use in this\nstudy were registered as inpatients of\nBeijing Tiantan Hospital. Written consent\nto obtain clinical specimens and to publish\ndata obtained in the study was obtained\nfrom the participants, or from the guard-\nians of participants who were <18 years\nof age.\nPatients\nThe study retrospectively included samples\nfrom patients with cAVM, with or without\nhaemorrhage, admitted to the Department\nof Neurosurgery at Beijing Tiantan Hospital\npatients included both emergency admis-\nsions and routine admissions. The samples\nand data included in this study were ran-\ndomly selected for inclusion using a com-\nputer program. Digital subtraction\nangiography, computed tomography and\nmagnetic resonance imaging were used for\nevaluation before and after surgery, using\nstandard techniques. The Spetzler\u00adMartin\ngrading system (www.neurosurgic.com) for\narteriovenous malformations was used\nto confirm that the surgical risk for\nparticipating patients with cAVM was\nacceptable. All patients underwent surgical\ncAVM resection, which was a routine aspect\nof their care and was undertaken using\nstandard techniques. After surgery, the diag-\nnosis of cAVM was confirmed pathologic-\nally. Also included in the study were head\ntrauma patients with structurally normal\nsuperficial temporal arteries (STAs), who\nserved as controls; the controls were not\nmatched to the treatment group. Head\ntrauma patients with cerebrovascular dis-\neases, tumours or other systemic diseases\nwere excluded.\nTissue specimens\nTissue specimens were obtained from each\npatient after microsurgical cAVM resection.\nThe cAVM nidus was dissected away from\nadjacent brain tissue in the operating room,\nand a representative portion of malformed\nAVM nidal tissue was immediately placed in\nan aluminium container and submerged in\nliquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues were stored\nat \u00c080C until analysis, which was under-\ntaken $2 months after excision. Specimens\nof structurally normal STA tissue were\nobtained from the control patients and\nwere collected, frozen and stored in the\nsame manner as the cAVM specimens.\nImmunohistochemistry\nThe frozen tissue samples were cut into\n5\u00ad6 mm-thick sections for haematoxylin\nand eosin staining, and for immunohisto-\nchemical staining for EphB4, ephrin B2 and\nvascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).\nAfter holding for 20 min at room tempera-\nture, frozen sections were fixed in standard\nacetone for 10 min. Procedures for immu-\nnohistochemistry were as described else-\n(rabbit monoclonal, dilution 1:150; Santa\nCruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), anti-ephrin\nB2 antibody (mouse polyclonal, dilution\n1:300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-\nVEGF-A antibody (mouse polyclonal, dilu-\ntion 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were\nused for immunohistochemical staining;\nantirabbit and antimouse secondary antibo-\ndies were used to detect these antibodies.\nTissue sections were counterstained with\nnuclear fast blue. Microscopy examinations\nscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany); magnifi-\nand 10 scopes were visualized in every\ntissue section; the average (mean \u00c6 SD) was\nthen calculated for each sample.\nImmunohistochemistry results were rec-\norded as scores for the percentage of cells\nstaining positively, and scores for staining\nintensity. The percentage of cells staining\npositively was scored 0 ( 10% positive\nor 4 (>75%). Staining intensity was scored 0\n(negative), 1 (weak), 2 (medium) or 3\n(strong). The product of the two scores was\nregarded as the total score for protein\nexpression; total scores were categorized as\n\u00c0 (score 0), \u00fe (<6), or \u00fe\u00fe (!6).\nImmunoblotting assays\nEqual amounts (10 mg) of protein from\ntissue lysates were separated by sodium\ndodecyl sulphate\u00adpolyacrylamide gel elec-\ntrophoresis, transferred onto nitrocellulose\nmembranes and probed with primary and\nsecondary antibodies. Additional antibodies\nused were anti-EphB4 antibody (rabbit\nmonoclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology;\nbody (mouse polyclonal; Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology; 1:500). Band intensity was\nanalysed using a Kodak\u00d5 Gel Logic imaging\nsystem (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems,\nRochester, NY, USA) and Quantity One\u00d5\n(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) software.\nTechnology, Danvers, MA, USA) was used\nas a control.\nStatistical analyses\nAll results were expressed as mean \u00c6 SD.\nSPSS\u00d5 statistical software, version 13.0\n(SPSS Inc. Chicago. IL., USA) was used\nfor analyses. The Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov test\nwas used to test for normal distribution of\nall quantitative data; 2-test was used for\ncomparisons between two sets of data.\nSingle-factor analysis of variance and the\nKruskal\u00adWallis test were used for compari-\nsons among three sets of data. P < 0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nThis study included data from 20 patients\n(15 male and five female) with cAVM; their\nThe first presentation was with haemorrhage\nin 10 patients and without haemorrhage in\nthe remaining 10 patients; two patients\nhaemorrhaged twice and three patients\nunderwent radiosurgery before cAVM\nresection (Table 1).

A cAVM is a complex tangle\nof abnormal arteries and veins linked by one\nor more fistulae: cAVMs lack a capillary bed\nand the small arteries have a deficient\nmuscularis layer. Such characteristics indi-\ncate that abnormal arteriovenous plasticity\nmay be the main reason for the formation of\ncAVMs.\nEphrin B2 and EphB4 have been\nregarded as the primary marker molecules\nfor arteriovenous differentiation, with\nephrin B2 expressed exclusively by arterial\nendothelial cells and EphB4 by venous\nreinforced by growing but not yet conclusive\nevidence that vessel marker proteins have\nroles other than establishing vessel identity\nin vessel sprouting (during vessel remodel-\nling and angiogenesis), such as the modula-\ntion of cell signalling and the direction of\ncell-tip filopodial extension.24\u00ad26 Indeed,\nephrin B2 can act as a proangiogenic\nfactor in postnatal neovascularization,\nsince it is capable of inducing neovascular-\nization when delivered in a corneal micro-\nThe present findings suggest extensive\nand ongoing roles for EphB4 and ephrin\nB2 in cAVM. We found that high ephrin B2\nexpression continued to mark arteries select-\nively in cAVM, but that there was no\nexpression in normal STA; in line with\nother research discussed above,21 we postu-\nlate that EphB2 did not stain in STA\nbecause these were mature, normal vessels,\nwhereas in cAVM EphB2 staining was\nobserved because the vessels were mal-\nformed and/or immature. Furthermore, we\nfound ephrin B2 expression only in the\narterial endothelium, not in the surrounding\narterial smooth muscle cells and pericytes.\nThis conflicts with a report that ephrin B2\nremained highly expressed in the endothe-\nlium and smooth muscle of adult arterial\nvessels.28 We also found that high EphB4\nexpression continued to mark venous\nFigure 3.

Together,\nthese findings suggest that EphB4 and\nephrin B2 might be involved, in an ongoing\nfashion, in regulating vascular endothelial\nformation, and arteriovenous differentiation\nand plasticity. Furthermore, in our view,\nselective expression of EphB4 and ephrin B2\nin veins and arteries suggests that ligand\u00ad\nreceptor pairs can act together, leading to\nabnormal angiogenesis in cAVM in the\nembryo and adult.\nMolecules with expression restricted to\neither arterial or venous endothelial cells are\nreferred to as arteriovenous markers, and\nplay critical roles in determining the corres-\nponding endothelial cell lineages during\nembryonic development.29 The expression\nlevel of the arterial endothelial cell marker\nephrin B2 seems to be dependent on extra-\ncellular determinants, as it is up-regulated\nWe speculate that hypoxia of the cerebral\nregional area due to artery\u00advein fistulae in\ncAVM stimulates VEGF-A production,\nwhich upregulates expression of ephrin B2.\nIn the embryo, induction of arteriovenous-\nspecific marker expression occurs when\nVEGF-A signals via the VEGF receptor-2/\nneuropilin-1 complex in arterial-fated angio-\nblasts, leading to the downstream activation\nof notch and ERK signalling pathways, and\nthe subsequent expression of the arterial\nmarker ephrin B2. There is some evidence\nthat transcription factors can inhibit the\nnotch signalling pathway in veins, inducing\nthe expression of the venous marker\nEphB4 and ephrin B2 has been determined\nby Delta-like ligand (DLL)-1, a notch ligand\nand an upstream factor regulating embry-\nonic artery differentiation and postnatal\nangiogenesis.37 Hainaud et al.38 found that\nupregulation of notch ligand DLL4 by\nVEGF-A could increase the activity of\nnotch 4, leading to upregulation of ephrin\nThe activation of notch 4 is necessary for\nthe upregulation of ephrin B2 by VEGF-A\nand vascular endothelial cell differentiation.\nThe other notable finding of the present\nstudy was that expression of VEGF-A,\nEphB4 and ephrin B2 was higher in\nH-AVM than in NH-AVM, which suggests\nthat endothelial cells are more active in\nH-AVM than in NH-AVM.\nVascular endothelial growth factor-\ninduced cell signalling has been implicated\nin arteriovenous specification during embry-\nonic development,39 suggesting that VEGF-\nA plays a role in arteriovenous specification\nin adult neovascularization. However, other\nstudies showed that VEGF-A is not respon-\nsible for angiogenic sprouting,40,41 suggest-\ning a different mechanism for the regulation\nof ephrin B2 and EphB4 expression, and\narteriovenous identity specification.\nArteriovenous specification in adult neovas-\ncularization may be driven by haemo-\ndynamic forces and perivascular cell\nactivity that is associated with specific\nneeds of the tissue, rather than by predeter-\nmined programming. To our knowledge,\nhaemodynamic forces are the main reasons\nfor haemorrhage in cerebral AVM, which\ncould explain the higher expression of\nVEGF-A, EphB4 and ephrin B2 in H-\nAVM. Hypoxia due to regional haemor-\nrhage also stimulates VEGF-A production\nIn conclusion, cAVMs have long been\nthought to arise from abnormal vascular\nformation during embryonic development.\nThe course of cAVMs cannot easily be\npredicted; they may remain static, grow or\nregress. Neovascularization and arterioven-\nous specification are the most important\nmolecular events in cAVM. High expression\nof EphB4 and ephrin B2 continues to mark\narteries and veins selectively in cAVM, and\nplays an important role in neovasculariza-\ntion and arteriovenous specification. The\nnotch pathway induced by VEGF-A may be\na key signalling pathway. Understanding the\nmolecular mechanism underlying neovascu-\nlarization, differentiation and arteriovenous\nspecification is important for the develop-\nment of future therapeutic approaches and\nfor the prediction of bleeding in cAVM.\nExpression of VEGF-A in cAVM was the\nfirst step that we studied. We now plan to\nconduct studies with proliferation markers,\nnotch pathway markers and with primary\ncultures defined from human specimens, to\nelucidate more about this key area of clinical\nresearch.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors had no conflicts of interest to declare\nin relation to this article.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
