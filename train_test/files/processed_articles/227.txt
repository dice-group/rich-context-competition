This primary sample was\nstratified to provide estimated equal numbers in\nfive-year age and sex groups.

This small portion has not been included in\nthis study.One thousand nine hundred and forty-\nseven participants were aged 70years and over.\nFrom this group of participants, 1446agreed\nto undergo a clinical assessment which included\ndistance visual acuity measurement. (Table 1)\nClinical assessment was conducted in the\nparticipants' homes by trained staff. Informed\nconsent was obtained from all participants.\nDistance visual acuity was measured at three\nmetresusing a suitable,well-illuminatedSnellen\nchart. Uncorrected visual acuity was measured\nin each eye followed by corrected visual acuity\nin each eye. Corrected visual acuity was\nmeasured using the participants' current\nTable 1.

Despite\nan inevitable component of self-selection\ninvolving those participants from the primary\nsample who underwent visual acuity\nmeasurements,we believe that the weighted data\ngives a reasonable point prevalence estimate of\nlegal blindness in the target population.\nindirect sources including the Department of\nSocial Security and in particular data from the\nNational Trachoma and Eye Health Programme\nto estimate the overall prevalence of legal\nNew South Wales.' Data from the Department\nyearsof ageandover inJune 1994wereinreceipt\nof a pension granted on the grounds of an\nincapacitating visual deficit. This represents\napproximately 0.74% of the elderly South\nAustralian population. Interestingly, this figure\nis compatible with the ALSA data.\nA prevalence survey of eye disease in\nLeicestershire using participants aged 75 years\nhad a visual acuity of less than or equal to 6/60\nin the better eye.6This figure is approximately\ntwice that of the comparable ALSA data. The\nBaltimore Eye Survey found that 0.63% of the\n70 to 79 year old Caucasian population had a\nvisual acuity of lessthan or equal to 6/60 in the\nbetter eye. In the same group aged 80years and\nover 7.28% had a visual acuity of less than or\nequal to 6/60 in the better eye.4An explanation\nfor the considerable increase in the prevalence\nof blindness in this age group was not offered.\nFortunately, such a marked age-related increase\nis not present in the ALSA sample, perhaps\nreflecting a better delivery of health care to our\nelderly population. A standardwhich is achieved\nat considerable expense to society.\nThe ALSA data indicate a considerable level\nof visual impairment and low vision within the\nelderly population. Approximately 9.3% of the\nsample population was visually impaired, as\nrecognised by the WHO criteria. It is possible\nthat a refractive problem contributed to this\nimpairment, however elucidation of aetiolgy\nrequires a more detailed study.\nIn relation to prevalence and causes of\nblindness, the underdeveloped countries have\nreceived more attentionthan their industrialised\ncounterparts. Numerous population-based\nstudies examining the prevalence of blindness\nand low vision in African countries have been\nc ~ n d u c t e d . ~ . ~\nThey reveal a prevalence of\nblindness (WHO definition:visual acuity <3/60\nin the better eye)of approximately 10%to 20%\nin the elderly population. The majority have\ntreatable disease. Comparatively,the prevalence\nof blindness in our elderly population is much\nlower, however we have at least a three-fold\nincrease in the percentage of population aged\nover 70 years. Data from the Australian Bureau\nof Statistics indicates that currently\napproximately 10%of the Australian population\nis in this age group. In the year 2001 there will\nto 16%.The corresponding projections are even\nhigher for South Australia alone. Given the\ncurrent data we can expect approximately 1%\nof this group to be legally blind. In addition,the\ngroup aged over 80years, in which blindness is\nrelatively more common, is the most rapidly\ngrowing subgroupof the population. Further,the\nmajority of blindness in this agegroup is caused\nby age-related macular degeneration and is\ntherefore largely untreatable.6\nBlindness is not only a personal tragedy, but\nalso a considerable social burden. It is clear that\nthis burden is increasing. Accurate data is\nessential in order to plan and provide adequate\nhealth care for our blind elderly population.\nGiven the current paucity of information\nconcerning the aetiology and demography of\nblindness in our community further studies in\nthis area would greatly enhance the current data.\n"
