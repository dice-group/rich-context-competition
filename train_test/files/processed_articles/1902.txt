The objective of the present study was to evaluate the association between\nblood levels of lead and cadmium and peripheral arterial disease.\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Peripheral arterial disease was defined as an ankle brachial index\n0.9 in at least 1 leg. Lead and cadmium levels were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. After adjustment\nfor demographic and cardiovascular risk factors, the ORs of peripheral arterial disease comparing quartiles 2 to 4 of lead\nfor current smokers compared with never smokers was 4.13. Adjustment for lead reduced this OR to 3.38, and\nadjustment for cadmium reduced it to 1.84.\nConclusions--Blood lead and cadmium, at levels well below current safety standards, were associated with an increased\nprevalence of peripheral arterial disease in the general US population. Cadmium may partially mediate the effect of\nKey Words: cadmium  lead  peripheral vascular diseases  smoking\nLead and cadmium are established toxic and carcinogenic\nmetals.1,2 Most studies of the cardiovascular effects of\nthese elements in humans have focused on their association\nwith increased blood pressure.3,4 Other cardiovascular end\npoints remain largely unexplored, although increased expo-\nsure to lead and cadmium has been associated with cardio-\nvascular events in some5\u00ad9 but not all10,11 studies. Lead and\ncadmium increase oxidative stress,12 affect endothelial func-\ntion,13 promote inflammation,14 downregulate nitric oxide\nthat could implicate these metals in the development of\natherosclerosis.\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) is characterized by flow-\nlimiting atherosclerosis in the muscular arteries of the lower\nextremities. Relative to other risk factors, smoking is more\nstrongly associated with PAD than atherosclerosis in carotid\nor coronary arteries,18,19 although the reasons are unknown.\nSmoking, however, is an important source of exposure to lead\nand especially to cadmium.20 Cadmium in cigarettes has been\nproposed as a causative agent for cigarette smoke\u00adinduced\ncardiovascular disease.20,21 We thus hypothesized that cad-\nmium and lead exposure increases the risk of PAD and that\nthey mediate the effect of smoking on PAD.\nTo investigate the association of lead and cadmium expo-\nsure with PAD, we evaluated the relation between blood lead\nand cadmium levels and the ankle-brachial blood pressure\nindex (ABI), a highly specific marker of subclinical PAD,22\nin a representative sample of US adults 40 years of age.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which was selected to\nrepresent the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population.23 Detailed\nin-person interviews, physical examinations, and serum samples\nwere obtained from 9965 persons.

We excluded 6 participants\nwith ABI values 1.5 (values usually related to noncompressible\nvalues in at least 1 of the variables of interest, leaving 2125\nindividuals in the sample.\nPeripheral Arterial Disease\nA specific protocol was used to measure ABI in NHANES 1999 to\n2000.23 The measurements of blood pressure used for ABI were\ndifferent from other measurements of blood pressure used to evaluate\nFrom the Departments of Epidemiology (A.N.-A., E.

If the participant had a condition that would interfere\nwith blood pressure reading in the right arm, the left arm was used.\nSystolic blood pressure was measured twice at each site for partic-\nipants 40 to 59 years of age and once at each site for participants 60\nyears of age. The left and right ABI measurements were obtained by\ndividing the ankle mean systolic blood pressure in each side by the\nmean systolic brachial blood pressure. PAD was defined as an ABI\nBlood Lead and Cadmium\nBlood for lead and cadmium measurements was collected in ordinary\ntubes after confirmation of no background contamination in all\ncollection and storage materials.23 The cadmium and lead levels in\nwhole blood were measured at the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention/National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) En-\nvironmental Health Laboratory Sciences Laboratory on a Perkin-\nElmer model SIMAA 6000 simultaneous multielement atomic ab-\nsorption spectrometer with Zeeman background correction.23 The\ndetection limits were 0.01 mol/L for lead and 2.5 nmol/L for\ncadmium. Two subjects in the study sample had levels below the\ndetection limit for lead, and 230 (9.7%) had levels below the\ndetection limit for cadmium. For these subjects, we imputed a level\nequal to the limit of detection divided by 2.25 The analytical\nlaboratory followed extensive quality control procedures.23 National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology Standard Reference Materials\nwhole-blood materials were used for external calibration. The\ninterassay coefficients of variation ranged from 3.1% to 4.0% for\nOther Variables of Interest\nInformation on age, sex, race-ethnicity, smoking, and alcohol consump-\ntion was based on self-report, and body mass index was calculated by\ndividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. Hypertension\nwas defined as a mean systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg, a mean\ndiastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg, a self-reported physician diagno-\nsis, or medication use. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as a total\ncholesterol level 6.2 mmol/L, a self-reported physician diagnosis, or\nmedication use. Diabetes was defined as a fasting glucose\n7.0 mmol/L, a nonfasting glucose 11.1 mmol/L, a self-reported\nphysician diagnosis, or medication use.\nHigh-sensitivity C-reactive protein was measured with a Behring\nNephelometer II Analyzer.

Adjusted ORs and their 95% CIs were used to compare\neach quartile of lead or cadmium distribution with their lowest\nquartile. Quartile cutoffs were based on the weighted distribution of\nlead and cadmium. Probability values for linear trend were obtained\nby including log-transformed metal levels as continuous variables in\nthe regression models. Smoking was adjusted for by use of self-\nreported smoking status (never, former, current) and cotinine levels\nin serum. Similar results were obtained when smoking was modeled\nas number of cigarettes currently smoked or as cumulative pack-\nyears of smoking (data not shown). The final models included\nadjustment for demographic variables, cardiovascular risk factors,\nglomerular filtration rate, and C-reactive protein. We also assessed\npossible interactions between lead and cadmium and between each\nmetal with sex, race-ethnicity, smoking status, renal function, or\nC-reactive protein. Because no clear interactions were observed and\nno interactions were statistically significant, they were not included\nin the final models.\nResults\nThe geometric means of blood lead and cadmium levels were\nand cadmium levels were higher in older subjects, in those\nwith lower educational levels, and in smokers. Both metals\nwere highest in current smokers, although smoking was more\nstrongly associated with cadmium. Lead levels were higher in\nmen, in blacks, in Mexican Americans, and in alcohol\ndrinkers. Cadmium levels were higher in women, with no\nsubstantial differences by race-ethnicity or by drinking status.\nThe correlation between lead and cadmium was 0.32\nAfter adjustment for demographic and cardiovascular risk\nhigher mean levels of cadmium than subjects without PAD.\nThe association of lead and cadmium with PAD was strong\nand progressive (Table 2), even after multivariable adjust-\nment. Simultaneously adjusting for the other metal did not\nappreciably alter the association for either cadmium or lead.\nCompared with never smokers, current smoking was asso-\nciated with an OR of 4.13 for PAD (Table 3). Adjusting for\nlead reduced the OR for smoking and PAD to 3.38, whereas\nadjusting for cadmium reduced this OR to 1.84.\nDiscussion\nBlood lead and cadmium levels were strongly associated with\nan increased prevalence of PAD in a representative sample of\nUS adults. The decrease in the association of cigarette\nsmoking with PAD after adjustment for cadmium suggests\nthat the effect of smoking on PAD is partly mediated by the\ncadmium content of cigarettes. The observed increase in PAD\nprevalence occurred at lead and cadmium levels much lower\nthan current safety levels used by environmental and occu-\npational regulatory agencies. For instance, only 1 study\nparticipant had lead levels 1.93 mol/L (40 g/dL), the\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)\nSafety Standard for lead in whole blood,27 and only 35 (1.6%)\nhad lead levels 0.48 mol/L (10 g/dL), the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention criterion for elevated blood\nlevels in children and pregnant women.28 Similarly, all\nparticipants had cadmium levels 44.5 nmol/L (5 g/L), the\nOSHA Safety Standard for cadmium.29\nThe general population can be exposed to lead and cad-\nmium in ambient air near industrial and combustion sources,\nin certain foods, through smoking, and sometimes in drinking\nwater.1,2 Lead exposure has declined substantially in the last\n2 decades after the ban on leaded gasoline.30 Lead exposure\nstill occurs in urban environments, particularly in areas near\nemission sources, and through contact with lead dusts and\nsoils. Exposure to cadmium in the general population results\nfrom exposure to cigarette smoke, inhalation of ambient air\nNavas-Acien et al Lead, Cadmium, and Peripheral Arterial Disease 3197\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nnear coal-fired power plants and municipal waste incinera-\ntors, and from consumption of some foods (highest levels in\nshellfish, liver, and kidney meats). Compared with workers in\nsmelting, refining, and manufacturing industries, the preva-\nlence of elevated exposures to lead or cadmium in the general\npopulation is low,1,2 and the levels in this study were much\nlower than those reported in retired workers.31,32\nSeveral mechanisms may explain an increased risk of\natherosclerosis with lead or cadmium. Experimental studies\nshow that both metals contribute to oxidative stress by\ncatalyzing the formation of reactive oxygen species,12,15\nincreasing lipid peroxidation,33,34 and depleting glutathione\nand protein-bound sulfhydryl groups.12 Lead and cadmium\nmay also stimulate the production of inflammatory cyto-\nkines14 and may induce endothelial damage by downregulat-\ning nitric oxide production.15,16 Both metals have also in-\nduced atherosclerosis in some models in vivo.35 The\nrelevance of these mechanisms to human atherogenesis and to\nPAD, however, is uncertain because mechanistic studies are\ntypically conducted at higher doses than the concentrations\nobserved in the present study. Furthermore, the effects of lead\nand cadmium in our study persisted after adjustment for\nTABLE 1.

Additional studies, at very low\nlevels, are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of action of\nthese metals at current levels of exposure in the general\npopulation.\nAn important finding of our study was the decrease in the\nassociation of smoking with PAD after adjustment for cad-\nmium. This pattern suggests that the effect of smoking on\nPAD is mediated partly by cadmium. In addition to cadmium,\nseveral agents in tobacco are considered to contribute to\ncardiovascular disease, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen\noxides, hydrogen cyanide, tar, zinc, and carbon disulfide.20\nAlthough we could not evaluate the relative contribution of\ncadmium compared with other tobacco components, it is\nimportant to note that the effect of cadmium persisted after\nadjustment for cotinine levels or for reported intensity of\nsmoking, indicating that the effect of cadmium is not likely to\nbe confounded by smoking or by compounds in cigarette\nsmoke. Because ABI was the only marker of atherosclerosis\nwhether cadmium is specifically associated with PAD or\nwhether a similar association is present for other vascular\nterritories. However, it is well established that smoking is\nmore strongly associated with PAD than with atherosclerosis\nin other arteries18,19; therefore, the effect of cadmium on other\ncardiovascular outcomes is of great interest.\nOur findings are consistent with previous cohort studies\nshowing a positive association of blood lead with cardiovas-\ncular mortality in NHANES II5 and with coronary heart\ndisease incidence in Denmark.6 Another cohort study in\nBritish men, however, did not show an association between\nblood lead and cardiovascular disease incidence.10 Few stud-\nies have evaluated the association between cadmium and\ncardiovascular outcomes. Ecological studies have found as-\nsociations of cardiovascular mortality rates with cadmium\nlevels in air7 and in soil and water.36 Two small case-control\nstudies found higher blood cadmium in subjects with myo-\nTABLE 2.

The\ncross-sectional design and the use of prevalent cases of PAD\nlimit conclusions regarding the direction or causality of the\nobserved associations. Because ABI is a subclinical marker\nand PAD is often asymptomatic,39 our design may be some-\nwhat resistant to biases introduced when symptomatic sub-\njects modify their levels of exposures. Indeed, the associa-\ntions between PAD and traditional risk factors in NHANES\n(data not shown). Prospective studies with incident cases of\nPAD, however, are needed to confirm our findings. Another\npossible limitation of our study is confounding by socioeco-\nnomic status, by differences in urbanization, or by other\npollutants that may occur in the same environmental settings.\nWe note, however, that although no data are currently\nresidence, our results persisted after adjustment for educa-\ntional level and for race-ethnicity. Finally, our analyses were\nbased on single blood measurements of lead and cadmium,\nimperfect biomarkers of chronic exposure. Environmental\nexposures, however, are likely to be less changeable than\noccupational exposures, and single blood levels are fre-\nquently used biomarkers in population studies.5,11,25 It is also\nlikely that, because of the limitations of blood lead and\ncadmium as biomarkers, our results underestimate the asso-\nciations of both metals with PAD.\nThe strengths of the study come from the rigorous sam-\npling design and the quality of the study measurements used\nin NHANES. These results are representative of the US\nnoninstitutionalized civilian population. Other strengths in-\nclude the use of ABI, a noninvasive measure of atheroscle-\nrosis particularly useful for epidemiological studies, and the\nlarge sample size. Furthermore, lead and cadmium in blood\nare biomarkers of internal dose that integrate all routes of\nAlthough our findings need confirmation in prospective\nstudies and support from mechanistic studies at low levels of\nexposure, we conclude that blood lead and cadmium, at levels\nwell below current safety standards, were associated with an\nincreased prevalence of PAD in a representative sample of\nUS adults. In addition, cadmium exposure explained a sub-\nstantial part of the effect of smoking on PAD.\n"
