Further, clinicians do not\nroutinely check the fit of the `index line' provided\non many BP cuffs to see whether the BP cuff size is\nappropriate for the patient. Data on clinical practice\nCorrespondence: Dr Y Ostchega, National Center for Health\nE-mail: yxo1@cdc.gov\nwww.nature.com/jhh\npatterns indicate widespread problems in BP cuff\nselection. The most common practice appears to be\nthe use a standard adult-size BP cuff for all subjects,\ndisregarding mid-AC.13 In one survey of 114 physi-\ncians,14 only 3% used an appropriate cuff size to\nobtain BP. In another survey of general practi-\ntioners,15 only 57% had an appropriately large cuff\navailable to obtain BP in obese patients. Surveys of\nnursing practice reported similar problems.16,17\nThe ratio of the cuff bladder width (CW) to mid-\narm circumference (CW/AC) is a key parameter for\nselecting an appropriate BP cuff size. A CW/AC ratio\nof 0.40 is recommended to give the optimum fit for\ntion, however, is subject to continuing discussion in\nThe need to tailor BP cuff size to the individual is\nmore pressing today due to increasing overweight\nand obesity among US adults.20 Mid-AC is positively\ncorrelated with body weight; recent US anthro-\npometric data demonstrate a parallel increase in\nthe population mean mid-AC.21\u00ad23 Using a BP cuff\ninappropriate for mid-AC in obese patients results\nin more biased BP readings than in the nonobese\npatient.24 This is especially true when using a\nregular adult cuff (12 cm) on an obese individual\nwith large arms.\nThe combination of measured height, weight,\ngender and age predicts 80% of the variability in\nmid-AC in men and 86% of the variability in\nwomen.23 Although it is preferable to base BP cuff\nselection on measured data, there are some circum-\nstances when it may be useful to determine BP cuff\nsize based on self-reported data. Also, it is of\nscientific interest to examine the relationship\nbetween mid-AC prediction equations based on\nmeasured, as opposed to self-reported height and\nweight data. Currently, there are no prediction\nequations for adult mid-AC based on self-reported\nheight and weight. This paper provides such predic-\ntion equations, and reference tables for estimated\nmid-AC and BP cuff sizes using self-reported data.\nAlso, we present an evaluation of the agreement\nbetween our prediction equations for mid-AC based\non measured vs self-reported height and weight.\nStudy design\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES) is a cross-sectional, nationally\nrepresentative survey with a complex, stratified,\nmultistage probability cluster design. The survey\nconsists of a detailed household interview and a\nhealth examination conducted in a mobile examina-\ntion center (MEC). Procedures for sample selection,\ninterviews and examinations were similar to for\nparticipants and the protocol was approved by the\nNCHS Ethics Review Board.\nMeasurements\nsame interview questions to collect data on self-\nreported height (in inches) and weight (in pounds).\nBoth surveys also employed an identical examina-\ntion protocol for measurement of standing height,\nweight, mid-AC, and for obtaining BP. The NHANES\nprocedure manuals describe the questionnaire and\nexamination protocols, and are available on the\nSample and data analysis\nEach NHANES survey provides national estimates\nfor the US population. Samples were drawn in-\ndependently with no intended overlap. NHANES III\ndata were used as a model building data set to\ndevelop the mid-AC prediction equations, and\nvalidation data set.27,28 The current analytic sample\nuses survey data for all participants ages 20 years\nand over (including the elderly ages 80 \u00fe ), who\nwere both interviewed and examined and for whom\nmeasured mid-AC and self-reported height and\nweight were available. This included 4854 women\nThe analysis was stratified by gender. The model\npredictors were selected on the basis of their high\nTable 1 Anthropometric and demographic characteristics of NHANES III and NHANES 1999\u00ad2000 participants, ages 20 years and over\nWomen Men Women Men\nSelf-reported data\nMeasured data\nEquations for estimating adult mid-AC using self-reported height and weight data\nY Ostchega et al\nJournal of Human Hypertension\ncorrelation with mid-AC measurement and concep-\ntual relevance to the model building.21\u00ad24 As neither\neducation nor race/ethnicity contributed to the\naccuracy of self-reported height and weight in\nNHANES II and NHANES III, these terms were not\nincluded in the self-reported model.29,30 Also, in\nfinal modeling, interaction terms did not contribute\nto accuracy of prediction. Therefore, the final\npredictor variables selected included weight, height,\nage, and a quadratic term for age. For a detailed\ndiscussion of model selection criteria see Ostchega\nBriefly, an all-possible regressions procedure was\nused to arrive at parsimonious models to predict\nmid-AC. The models with the largest adjusted R2,\nthe lowest Mallow's C(P) statistic, and all estimated\nregression coefficients significant (Po0.05) in both\nmodel were selected.31\u00ad33 Four additional analytic\nprocedures were performed to establish the predic-\ntive regression model validity. First, we estimated\nthe predicted residual sum of squares (PRESS)\nstatistics for all regression models and selected the\nmodel with the smallest PRESS value.34 Moreover,\nPRESS statistics can be used to detect outlying or\ninfluential observations. Specifically, if the PRESS\nstatistic values are considerably larger than the\nresidual sum of squares, it may indicate the\nexistence of outliers in the data.34 Second, the mean\nsquared predicting error (MSPR) was calculated for\nthe validation model. An MSPR which does not\ndiffer greatly from the model building data set mean\nsquare error (MSE) indicates that the regression\nequation derived from the model fitting data set is a\nreasonable and valid indicator of the predictive\nability of the fitted regression model.34 Third, cross-\nvalidation was performed using the model-building\ncoefficient values to calculate predicted AC values\nand validating them by correlation analysis with the\nobserved AC values in the validation data sets. The\nfinal step in the validation process involved asses-\nsing the impact of the CW/AC ratio on systolic and\ndiastolic BP variability for men and women sepa-\nas an independent variable was initially regressed\nwith measured mid-AC in the denominator and a\nsecond time with predicted AC in the denominator\nfor self-reported weight and height, using systolic\nBP or diastolic BP as the dependent variable. In the\nnumerator (CW) were BP cuff sizes (12, 15, and\n18 cm) that were selected by the BP observers in the\nMEC using a table as a guide for appropriate cuff\nselection based on the 0.40 CW/ACA ratio criter-\nion.35 During NHANES, the examiners used the\nappropriate BP cuff size 90% of the time.35 We\ncompared the R2 values resulting from measured AC\nwith the results of AC derived from the predicting\nequations. We expected that both the measured and\npredicted CW/AC ratios would contribute a similar\namount of variation to the average systolic and\ndiastolic BP, and therefore were likely to contribute\na similar degree of bias to the above measurements.\nAll data were analyzed as a simple random sample\nbecause no national estimates are reported. The data\nwere analyzed using SAS (Version 8.02, SAS\nInstitute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).\nTables were constructed using the prediction\nequation to provide mean mid-AC by gender, age,\nweight, and height categories. As age had a curvi-\nlinear relationship with AC and an initial positive\ncorrelation followed by a negative correlation (not\nshown), age was dichotomized into two age groups.\nFor men, the correlation between age and mid-AC\nfor ages greater than 50 (r \u00bc \u00c00.37); for women, the\nnegative for ages greater than 60 (r \u00bc \u00c00.33). Since\nthe initial set of prediction equations were con-\nfirmed in the split sample validation step, the\nweight and height were subsequently pooled to\nproduce the final set of prediction equations. This\nimproved the precision of the estimates for the mean\nAll mid-AC estimates derived from measured vs\nself-reported height and weight equations were\ncategorized using the American Heart Association\nBP cuff size recommendations.12,36 The mid-AC\nrange for the adult BP cuff size was 27\u00ad34 cm; for\nthe large adult size, 35\u00ad44 cm; and for the adult\nthigh size, 45\u00ad52 cm. Percent agreement was com-\nputed for these categorized variables by gender and\nResults\nTable 1 shows sample sizes and means for the age\nand anthropomorphic characteristics of NHANES III\npresented by gender.

Each predictor\ncontributed significantly (Po0.01) to predicting\nmid-AC, and combined, they explained 76% of\nvariation in men and 81% of the variation in\nwomen. Body weight is the most important pre-\ndictor of AC; a one pound increase in weight\nresulted in an increase of 0.11 cm in AC in men\nand 0.14 cm in women. MSE and adjusted R2 values\nwere very similar for the building and validation\nto the SSE in all models, suggesting no outliers\nor influential observations.

Although\nthe use of self-reported height and weight data is\nless accurate than those based on measurements; its\ngeneral validity is supported by the high level of\nagreement between methods for predicting mid-AC\nand appropriate BP cuff size based on measured vs\nself-reported data.\nThere are several settings in which self-reported\nheight and weight data may be useful to select an\nappropriate BP cuff. In mobile or home health care\nsettings, for example visiting nursing, it may not\nalways be practical to carry portable scales and\nstadiometers to obtain measured height and weight\nor to obtain mid-AC. Also, in health screening\nsettings (e.g. health fairs) where personnel costs\nand time constraints must be considered, self-\nreported height and weight data may expedite BP\ncuff selection. Individual self-measurement of BP is\na growing trend. In situations where subjects test\ntheir own BP with automated equipment, self-\nreported data may be used to help select appropriate\nBP cuff sizes. Consumers may ask providers to\nhelp them select an appropriate BP cuff for home\nmonitoring and to facilitate such discussions,\npreliminary informational materials could be\ndeveloped using the tables we developed.\nBody weight is the main predictor of, and is\npositively correlated with variation in mid-AC. Our\ncurrent findings support previous work that relates\nincreasing mid-AC to increased weight.21\u00ad23 The\nrelationship between self-reported and measured\nheight and weight was previously reported. Kucz-\nmarski et al.30 using NHANES III data concluded\nthat self-reported weight and height can be used\nwith younger and middle aged adults, but they had\nsome reservations about using self-reported weight\nand height in adults ages 60 and older. The\nassociation between self-reported and measured\nheight and weight was also demonstrated with\nNHANES II data; however, no conclusions were\ndrawn there regarding self-reporting reliability by\nage.29 Therefore, for adults age 60 and older, it is\nstrongly recommended to base BP cuff size selection\non either direct mid-AC measurement or tables\nvalues based on measured height and weight data.23\nThe NHANES prediction equations for mid-AC\nare derived from a nationally representative sample\nusing standardized research protocol. Technically,\nthe results of our study apply strictly to the US\ngeneral population as a whole, which is quite large.\nWhile it has sometimes been assumed for Public\nHealth planning purposes that results from the US\nNHANES surveys apply generally to the situation\ninternationally, this should not be simply be\nassumed to be the case. Ideally, similar studies\nwould be carried out in other countries and\ninternational results compared to allow us to assess\nwhether the US results accurately reflect the general\nsituation. All prediction models have some amount\nof unexplained variance (1\u00c0R2). Specifically, for\nmen in our model, 24% of the variance in mid-AC\nvalues estimated from self-reported data was un-\nexplained. However, when predicted AC was used\nin the denominator of the CW/AC ratio and this was\nregressed on mean SBP and DBP, there were minor\ndifferences compared to regression models using\ndirectly measured mid-AC in the denominator of\nthe CW/AC ratio term.\nThe overall background for, and major conclu-\nsions of our study, are summarized in Table 4. BP\nmonitoring is an essential component of hyperten-\nsion diagnosis and treatment, and proper cuff size is\nrequired to measure BP accurately.

The proper selection of blood pressure (BP) cuff sizes for accurate BP readings depends on accurate mid-arm circumference (AC)\nmeasurements.\n2. Because of recent population trends towards increasing obesity and mid-AC, practical methods for the selection of correctly sized BP\ncuffs is increasingly important.\n3. Valid prediction equations for mid-AC exist based on measured height and weight.\n4. Measured height and weight are highly correlated with self-reported height and weight.\nIt was unknown:\n1. Whether the proper selection of blood pressure (BP) cuff sizes for accurate BP readings can be based on self-reported height and\nweight, as opposed to direct measurement data.\nEvidence from the current study:\n1. Prediction equations for mid-AC were derived from self-reported height and weight data using a large nationally representative\nsample.\n2. The prediction equations performed well in both men and women, sufficient to have utility in mid-AC estimation and BP cuff size\ndetermination.\n3. Compared to direct mid-AC measurement, or mid-AC estimation based on measured height and weight, the prediction equations based\non self-reported data are less accurate, and are a third choice for clinicians. They are likely to be of practical utility only in special\nsettings.\nEquations for estimating adult mid-AC using self-reported height and weight data\nY Ostchega et al\nJournal of Human Hypertension\n21 Graves JW, Bailey KR, Sheps SG.
