Ninety-six cats were included.\nResults Myoclonic seizures were one of the cardinal signs of this syndrome (90/96), frequently occurring prior to\ngeneralised tonic\u00adclonic seizures (GTCSs) in this population. Other features include a late onset (median 15 years)\nand absence seizures (6/96), with most seizures triggered by high-frequency sounds amid occasional spontaneous\nseizures (up to 20%). Half the population (48/96) had hearing impairment or were deaf. One-third of cats (35/96)\nhad concurrent diseases, most likely reflecting the age distribution. Birmans were strongly represented (30/96).\nLevetiracetam gave good seizure control. The course of the epilepsy was non-progressive in the majority (68/96),\nmyoclonic seizures affected their cat's quality of life (QoL). Despite this, many owners (50/96) reported a slow\ndecline in their cat's health, becoming less responsive (43/50), not jumping (41/50), becoming uncoordinated or\nweak in the pelvic limbs (24/50) and exhibiting dramatic weight loss (39/50). These signs were exclusively reported\nin cats experiencing seizures for >2 years, with 42/50 owners stating these signs affected their cat's QoL.\nConclusions and relevance In gathering data on audiogenic seizures in cats, we have identified a new epilepsy\nsyndrome named FARS with a geriatric onset. Further studies are warranted to investigate potential genetic\npredispositions to this condition.\n1Davies Veterinary Specialists, Hitchin, Hertfordshire, UK\n2International Cat Care, Tisbury, Wiltshire, UK\nDepartment of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy,\nLondon, UK\nCorresponding author:\nMark Lowrie MA, VetMB, MVM, DipECVN, MRCVS, RCVS and\nEuropean Specialist in Veterinary Neurology, Davies Veterinary\nSpecialists, Manor Farm Business Park, Higham Gobion, Hitchin,\nEmail:mll@vetspecialists.co.uk\nOriginal Article\nWe have become increasingly aware of audiogenic\nreflex seizures in cats. A questionnaire-based method\nwas used to gather data to better define and characterise\nthe phenotype of feline audiogenic reflex seizures\n(FARS). The purpose of this article is to provide a descrip-\ntion of this syndrome.\nMaterials and methods\nCase recruitment\nCases were recruited via the veterinary media (The\nVeterinary Times and Veterinary Record), the internet\n(solicitation on cat forums, Facebook and the\nInternational Cat Care website) and the international\npress (radio and newspaper driven) asking primary vet-\nerinarians and owners to contact us regarding suspected\ncases of audiogenic seizures in cats. Pedigrees, medical\nhistory information, litter information and cheek swab\nsamples for DNA isolation were collected where possi-\nble. A detailed invitation-only questionnaire was pre-\npared and was preceded by owner interview via\ntelephone conversation or email in which an open\ndescription of the seizure types was given by the owner.\nOn obtaining a description considered compatible with a\nseizure (as determined by one of the authors [ML]) the\nquestionnaire invitation was given. Where available,\nvideo recordings of episodes were reviewed to charac-\nterise that the episodes truly represented an epileptic sei-\nzure. In the cases recruited via primary veterinarians, a\nfull history was also requested and reviewed. If the\nowner had contacted us directly and was included in the\nstudy, consent was obtained to request and review the\nhistory from their primary veterinarian. This history\nsupplemented the information gained from the ques-\ntionnaire. Data were acquired from September 2013 to\nQuestionnaire design\nThe questions used in this questionnaire are detailed in\nthe Supplementary material. The questionnaire was\ndivided into four sections, with each section having its\nown purpose. The questionnaire contained numerous\nopen-ended questions, to which the answer was recorded\nverbatim, followed by specific leading questions. The\nmajority of questions were closed questions with multi-\nple choice answers. In order to ensure they were correctly\nexcluded, questions were also included to help recognise\nthose participants that did not fulfil the inclusion criteria.\nQuestions directed towards the types and characteristics\nof the episodes also included an opportunity to provide a\ndescription verbatim of the episodes. Where more than\none type of episode was observed, participants were\nasked to characterise each individually. The questions\nwere therefore divided across the sections into those that\nscreened cats for audiogenic reflex seizures and those\nthat provided detailed phenotypic information in terms\nof the signalment of animals, possible precipitating fac-\ntors, general health, therapeutic trials, where relevant,\nand the characteristics of the episodes. Questions were\nrandomised within each section to prevent owners from\ndrawing conclusions about the expected answer. The\nproject questionnaire was presented online utilising the\nonline survey software tool SurveyMonkey (http://\nwww.surveymonkey.com).\nInclusion criteria\nInclusion criteria were in place to exclude other disease\nprocesses that may be misinterpreted as an epileptic sei-\nzure or paroxysmal behaviour. It was important that all\ncats had to have suffered three or more GTCSs that had\nbeen precipitated by the same sound stimulus. A GTCS\nwas considered only if strict criteria were met, notably\nthe presence of tonic\u00adclonic contractions of all limbs, and\nthe presence of an altered consciousness with autonomic\nsigns (specifically urination and/or salivation). A GTCS\nwas also excluded if the duration was reported to be >5\nmins. If other types of episodes were present in addition\nto a confirmed GTCS, the features of these episodes were\nrecorded individually in the questionnaire. A myoclonic\nseizure or jerk was considered when there was a sudden,\nbrief involuntary contraction of a muscle or muscle\ngroup. Absence seizures were considered as the occur-\nrence of an abrupt, transient apparent loss of conscious-\nness with no motor activity. All cats had to have at least\na 1 year history of seizures.\nResults\nThere were 128 respondents to the questionnaire. Thirty-\ntwo cats were excluded because they did not meet the\ninclusion criteria. This included 16 cats that had suffered\nfewer than three GTCSs, 10 cats that had a history of\nGTCSs for <1 year, four cats that had no reported auto-\nnomic signs during the episodes and two cats that had\nseizures reported to be >5 mins in duration.\nSignalment\nDetails on 96 cats were therefore collected; these com-\nprised 45 domestic shorthairs, 30 Birmans, six Burmeses\nfive domestic longhairs, four Bengals, two Maine Coons,\nand one of each of British Shorthair, European Shorthair,\nNorwegian Forest and Birman cross. Of the Birman cats,\nThe mean age of the cats at seizure onset was 15 years\nSound stimulus\nAll seizures, as per the inclusion criteria, occurred follow-\ning a noise stimulus, but in some cats spontaneous myo-\nobserved on rare occasions without an obvious noise\nstimulus. All sounds triggering these seizures were high\npitched. The sounds were capable of triggering different\nseizure types with no distinct sound predicting or pro-\nducing a distinct seizure pattern. In some cases, a repeated\nsound initiated a myoclonic seizure that, when prolonged,\ncould progress to a GTCS. This phenomenon of audio-\ngenic kindling was reported in 86 cats. These sounds had\nnot always caused cats to seizure and could occur without\nalthough many owners remarked that the nature of the\nsounds made it very difficult to eradicate the seizures\ncompletely. All owners felt they could reliably induce a\nseizure by making one of the described trigger noises. The\nloudness of the sound (amplitude) also seemed to increase\nthe severity of seizures, regardless of the type of seizure.\nSound stimuli identified to evoke seizures in cats\nincluded the crinkling of tin foil (n = 82); a metal spoon\ndropping into a ceramic feeding bowl (n = 79); the chink-\ning or tapping of glass (n = 72); paper or plastic bags\ncrinkling (n = 71); computer keyboard tapping or mouse\nclicking (n = 61); the clinking of coins or keys (n = 59);\nthe hammering of a nail (n = 38); the clicking of an own-\ner's tongue (n = 24); the sound of breaking the tin foil from\ntreatment or tablet packaging (n = 12); texting (n = 8);\na digital alarm (n = 6); the sound of Velcro (n = 6); the\nclicking of a piezo lighter for a gas stove or the sound\nmade by igniting the gas hob (n = 4); a mobile phone\nring (n = 4); running water (n = 2); the sound created by\na dog scratching its neck and jangling its collar (n = 2); a\ncomputer printer (n = 2); firewood spitting (n = 1);\nwooden building blocks being knocked together (n = 1);\nwalking on a wooden floor with bare feet or squeaky\nshoes (n = 1); and the short, sharp scream of a young\nchild (n = 1). There were no other reported precipitating\nfactors that could induce a seizure or make one more\nlikely to occur.\nClinical features\nApart from GTCSs, cats developed other seizure types\nabsences or presumed absence seizures (6/96; 6%). The\nGTCSs; with six (6/96; 6%) cats having the triad of\nabsence seizures, myoclonic jerks and GTCSs. Six cats\n(6/96; 6%) had only GTCSs. Absence seizures antedated\nmyoclonic jerks in all six cats (6/96) with this seizure\ntype. The first seizure observed by the owner was a\ncats. Seven (7/96; 7%) owners were uncertain which sei-\nzure type was observed first. All cats were reported to be\nnormal between the seizures.\nGTCSs GTCSs were present in all cats, as per the inclusion\ncriteria. Therefore, all had an altered consciousness with\nepisodes lasting <5 mins. Urination was recorded in 74/96\nvided in three cases, which confirmed their nature as\nGTCSs. The seizures never occurred more frequently than\none per 24 h period (ie, no clusters). GTCSs were often\ncated their coming just minutes in advance, with a series of\nrapid myoclonic jerks of increasing intensity. GTCSs most\ncommonly occurred at a frequency of one every 3\u00ad6\nmonths, although, overall, this was highly variable, with\nperiods as long as 18 months between seizures.\nthirst (6/96; 6%) also being reported. These postictal\nsigns abated within 24 h in all cats. However, many cats\nminutes of a GTCS.\nMyoclonic seizuresMyoclonic jerks or seizures without\napparent loss of consciousness were frequently reported\n<30 s), commonly bilateral, rhythmic contractions that\never, all owners reported that the jerking could spread to\nreported to involve only a single part of the body. Videos\nwere provided in 23/96 cats, which confirmed the nature\nFigure 1 Venn diagram demonstrating the seizure types\nassociated with feline audiogenic reflex seizures and their\nfrequency in this population\nof these myoclonic seizures (see video in Supplementary\nmaterial). All owners reported that consciousness was\nunaffected during these jerks. However, video footage\nsuggested there was some degree of impairment, albeit\nbrief. This discrepancy is understandable given the short\nduration of the seizures and so impairment of conscious-\nness should be considered likely in these cats.\nMyoclonic jerks were more likely to occur in clusters\nintensity of myoclonic jerks varied from up to 20 in a day\nto one every 3\u00ad6 months. Owners reported that more\nviolent jerks could result in cats falling to the floor. Rapid\nsuccessive jerks would frequently evolve into a GTCS\nThe majority of the cats were normal immediately\ncats were reported to be more sleepy than normal within\nthe first few hours only. No other postictal signs were\nnoted for this type of seizure.\nThe 16 cats that were excluded because they suffered\nfewer than three GTCSs included 14/16 that reported\nregular myoclonic jerks in response to specific sounds.\nSome of these cats (12/16) had no reported episodes of\nGTCSs. However, these cats have not been included in\nthe study population.\nAbsence seizures Periods of absence were rarely reported\nwithin this population. Absences were considered when\nthe owners reported periods of staring with no motor\nactivity (6/96; 6%). These episodes would almost always\nprecede myoclonic jerks. Episodes lasted between 30 s\nand 1 min in all six cats. Afew seconds after each episode,\nthe cats were reported to be quieter than usual by the\nowners and slower to respond. Postictal signs were var-\nied, with all owners describing sleepiness and a per-\nceived feeling of their cat experiencing disorientation.\nThese signs could last up to a few hours (4/6; 67%) or\nInvestigations\nDiagnostic investigations were pursued in 85/96 cats\n(89%).

Fifteen cats had\nreceived phenobarbital and 29 cats had received leveti-\nracetam. Among the 15 cats taking phenobarbital, 4/15\n(27%) experienced adequate GTCS control, although\nonly one owner felt it reduced the frequency of the myo-\nclonic seizures (7%). The remainder were reported by the\nowners to have no change in seizure frequency. All cats\nhad received this drug for a minimum of 6 weeks before\ndiscontinuing the medication.

Dosages were available\nin 27/29 cats and were considered adequate, and all cats\nhad received the medication for at least 2 months.\nAdditionally, those cats receiving no medication for sei-\nzure control did not appear to progress or deteriorate\nduring the course of their seizures.\nOutcome\nTwenty-two cats were dead at the time of writing, all\nhaving been euthanased. All 22 cats had suffered sei-\nzures up until the point of euthanasia; therefore, the\naverage duration of seizures in these cats was 24 months\nThe reason for euthanasia was seizure-related in just one\ncat. The remaining 21 cats were euthanased owing to\nconcurrent diseases or a decline in condition.\nThe onset of epilepsy was highly variable, with single\nseizures or clusters being observed. The course of the\nepilepsy was non-progressive in the majority of cats\nowners stated that the GTCSs affected their cat's quality\nof life (QoL); however, a much lower proportion (12%;\n11/90) felt the myoclonic seizures affected their cat's\nQoL.\nAlthough the seizures were not a concern to the\ndecline in their cat's health in that they became incoordi-\nnated or weak in the pelvic limbs (24/50), less respon-\ndramatic (>1 kg) weight loss (39/50), toileted inappro-\npriately in the house (12/50) and got stuck in corners\n(8/50) since seizure onset. However, these signs were\nonly reported in cats that had experienced seizures for\n>2 years. Only nine cats that had experienced seizures\nfor >2 years were reported to be normal between sei-\nzures. Of these 50 cats with a decline in general health,\nonly eight had been diagnosed with a concurrent dis-\nease. Eighty-four percent (42/50) of owners felt that\nthese non-seizure signs affected their cat's QoL.\nDiscussion\nFARS are characterised by GTCSs, myoclonic seizures\nand absence seizures. In gathering these data the consist-\nency of agreement between owners' responses has identi-\nfied a degenerative syndrome of FARS in older cats.\nThere appears to be no sex bias, although cats exclusively\nsuffer from FARS later in life within their second decade.\nThe sounds responsible are high-pitched sounds, often\nrelatively quiet sounds, with increasing loudness and\npersistence of a sound only serving to enhance the sever-\nity of epileptic seizures. Myoclonic jerks or seizures with\nor without impairment of consciousness appear as one of\nthe cardinal signs of FARS, frequently occurring prior to\na GTCS in this population. One-third of the population\nwas diagnosed with concurrent diseases; however, this\nmost likely reflected the age of the population rather than\na causal relationship. This rationale is made on the basis\nof the static or improving nature of the epilepsy in the\ncats with concurrent medical conditions. However, 50%\nof the population were reported to have hearing impair-\nment or were deaf. Therapeutic trials with levetiracetam\nsuggest this may be more suitable than phenobarbital to\ncontrol myoclonic seizures and GTCSs associated with\nthis condition. Although seizures remained relatively\nnon-progressive, other signs developed that were slowly\nprogressive exclusively in cats suffering this epilepsy\nsyndrome for >2 years. However, it cannot be deter-\nmined whether this decline was due to concurrent dis-\nease and entirely coincidental to the association of FARS,\nor part of the same syndrome.\nWe found a high number of Birman cats in the study\ncohort (31% of cats), strongly suggesting a breed predis-\nposition to the condition and thus a hereditary tendency.\nThe ancestry of the Birman is such that the seal and blue\npoints are the original breed colours and cross-mating\nwith other breeds such as Persians and Siamese cats\nhave led to the development of other colours, which\nappear unaffected by this syndrome. To date, all known\nBirmans with this condition are of the seal and blue point\nvariety. A recessive or dominant mode of inheritance\nseems unlikely based on the limited pedigree data\nobtained. It is also important to state that Birmans had\nthe same clinical features of FARS as cats of other breeds,\nso although the Birman may represent a different geno-\ntype or aetiology, the phenotype was comparable.\nAnimal models that recapitulate human epilepsies\nare a useful and convenient tool for studying epilepsy.\nAudiogenic epilepsy in rodents has become one such\ninfluential model, with sound-induced seizures initiated\nand driven by a brainstem network independent of the\nforebrain \u00ad so-called `brainstem seizures'.3 The caudal\ncolliculus is critical for the initiation of audiogenic\nseizures.4 Seizure discharges then spread to other brain-\nstem nuclei such as the rostral colliculus, pontine reticu-\nlar formation and periaqueductal gray.5 Repetitive\nacoustic stimulation transforms these midbrain electrical\nstimulations into limbic ones. The spread of these sei-\nzure discharges to these forebrain structures after such\nrepetitive stimulation results in the clinical manifesta-\ntion of an epileptic seizure. In the context of the cats\nreported in this study, the term audiogenic kindling\nrefers to myoclonic seizures and/or GTCSs, which\ndevelop after numerous daily sound exposures. This\nprocess of epileptic activation of the forebrain by\nrepeated sound-induced brainstem seizures has been\nreferred to as audiogenic kindling.6,7\nLevetiracetam has been shown to reduce the fre-\nquency and progression of audiogenic seizures.8,9 The\nantiepileptic effect of levetiracetam against audiogenic\nseizures has been found to correlate with the affinity for\nthe synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A.10 Mapping of leve-\ntiracetam-selective binding sites in the rat brain identi-\nfied high concentrations in structures such as the rostral\ncolliculus and periaqueductal gray; that is, the structures\ninvolved in propagation of brainstem seizures.11 In con-\ntrast to other antiepileptic drugs, levetiracetam appears\nto exert a more profound antiepileptic effect in kindled\naudiogenic seizures than in non-kindled epileptic ani-\nmals, supporting the hypothesis put forward by\nKlitgaard et al,8 proposing that levetiracetam has\nincreased efficacy in the kindled epileptic brain.\nThe results of our study suggest that levetiracetam\nmay aid in reducing the frequency of audiogenic sei-\nzures in cats, as well as their progression (preventing\naudiogenic kindling), providing an exciting opportu-\nnity to trial levetiracetam therapy for FARS. However,\nthe small number of cats receiving treatment and the\npotential for variability in administration means this\naspect would require further investigation before any\nclaims are made about levetiracetam being a suitable\nchoice for epileptic myoclonus and FARS. It is interest-\ning to note that human studies also show that myoclonic\nseizures are highly responsive to treatment with\nThe reason for cats being so sensitive to these seem-\ningly benign high-pitch sounds may have an origin in\nthe ultrasonic hearing range of the species. Mice and rats\ncommunicate in the ultrasonic frequency range (around\n40 kHz).15 It is believed that cats developed a secondary\nultrasonic sensitive hearing range at these frequencies,\npresumably as an evolutionary advantage in catching\nrats and mice; their natural prey.15 Common domestic\nnoises with a high component of ultrasonic frequencies\n\u00ad such as tearing paper, opening cans, jangling keys and\nhitting solid surfaces \u00ad may sound innocuous to us but\nactually sound more startling to cats that are sensitive to\nthese frequencies. Deafness or hearing impairment was\nreported in half the cats in this study, and no apparent\ncause was found in those in which cross-sectional imag-\ning of the head was performed. We therefore speculate\nfrom our data that sensorineural deafness may be associ-\nated with audiogenic seizures in cats, although these\nsigns, especially given the age of the population, may\nhave had no relationship at all to the FARS. Audiogenic\nseizures in cats that are deaf seem paradoxical. It is spec-\nulated that cats become susceptible to cochlear damage\nas a consequence of age and exposure to loud noises. The\nfrequency of the noise determines the position on the\ncochlea that the irreversible damage to the outer hair\ncells occurs.16 Work by Miller et al showed that the main\narea of damage was in the middle and lower portions of\nthe second turn of the cochlea (corresponding to 7600Hz\n\u00ad everyday `loud' noises to us) but that the area of the\ncochlea associated with detecting higher-frequency\nsounds was not affected.16 Therefore, these cats will\nappear deaf to us, although complete hearing loss is not\npresent. Further investigations will be required in this\narea before final conclusions are drawn as hearing\nimpairment was perceived and reported by owners and\nwas not confirmed clinically, making it impossible to\nconfirm this clinical feature or its pathogenesis.\nAn interesting feature of audiogenic seizures in\nrodents is that one particular strain displays concurrent\nsensorineural deafness. Mutations in GIPC3 have been\nfound to cause progressive sensorineural hearing loss\nand audiogenic seizures (Jams1) in mice and autosomal\nrecessive deafness in humans.17 Another important set of\nproteins in epilepsy are those characterised by the pres-\nence of tandem epilepsy associated repeats, or epitem-\npin as it is also known.18 This family consists of several\nproteins,18 including the four members of the LGI (LGI-1,\nrich glioma inactivated protein, a protein-truncating\nmutation in LGI2 in the Lagotto Romagnolo dog, results\nin benign familial juvenile epilepsy.20 Mutations in Vlgr1\nhave been found to be responsible for a monogenic form\nof auditory seizures in certain strains of mice,21\u00ad23 and\nare associated with hearing impairment in these same\nmice.24 This makes them suitable candidate genes for\ngenetic analysis in cases of FARS. FARS also share simi-\nlarities with the progressive myoclonic epilepsies\n(PMEs). PMEs are widely reported in humans and are\ncharacterised by myoclonic seizures, tonic\u00adclonic sei-\nzures and progressive neurological deterioration, typi-\ncally with cerebellar signs and dementia.24 In different\ndisease entities various types of seizures and neurologi-\ncal signs predominate. Myoclonus in PME is typically\nfragmentary and multifocal, and is often triggered by an\nenvironmental or internal stimulus.25 The age of onset,\npresenting signs, predominance of signs such as sei-\nzures, or myoclonus over cerebellar signs and dementia\nvary substantially across the different disorders. In\nhumans, there are five main causes of PME that have\nbeen more accurately defined with recent advances in\ngenetic studies: Lafora disease, neuronal ceroid lipofus-\ncinosis (NCLs), myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red\nfibres, Unverricht\u00adLundborg disease (UCL) and siali-\ndoses.25 Only Lafora disease, NCLs and UCL have been\nassociated with reflex seizures. However, few are\nreported in veterinary medicine, with only Lafora dis-\nease and several different subtypes of the NCLs having\nbeen shown to have a clear genetic cause.26\u00ad34\nhas some clinical correlation with FARS in that reflex\nmyoclonic seizures are a feature. The disease has a late\nonset (median 7 years of age) with a slowly progressive\nmyoclonic seizures may occur in response to auditory\nMiniature Wirehaired Dachshunds has been shown to be\ncaused by the recessive inheritance of a biallelic expan-\nsion of a dodecamer repeat in the malin gene (EPM2B or\nNHLRC1).26 Mutations for the human disease have also\nbeen identified in the laforin (EPM2A) and the malin\ndates for FARS.\nThe NCLs are a group of inherited PMEs resulting\nfrom lysosomal storage disorders. They typically cause\nmyoclonic seizures, often in the terminal phase, along-\nside other degenerative neurological signs. Eight genes\nhave now been described in canine NCLs: PPT1,27 TPP1\nand ARSG.34 In general, the descriptions of cats with\nNCLs report progressive visual dysfunction and pro-\nfoundneurologicaldeclineinanimalsexclusivelyyounger\nthan 2 years of age.52\u00ad56 Myoclonic seizures are only\nreported in end-stage disease. No gene defects have as\nyet been identified in feline NCLs.55,56\nThe nature of this study meant that set criteria were\nnecessary for the phenotype and for inclusion of cats in\nthe study \u00ad this may be helpful for performing a genetic\nstudy, which will form the second part of our investiga-\ntions. Initial recognition of this disorder requires a select\ncollection of cases using defined criteria. However, it is\nimportant to note that other seizure types, such as\nabsence and myoclonic seizures, are likely to occur as the\nsole seizure type in this syndrome. As an example, it is\ninteresting to note that 12/16 excluded cats had myo-\nclonic jerks alone with no GTCSs. Conversely, it is pos-\nsible that some cats presented here may have suffered\nabsence seizures that the owners had not previously rec-\nognised. Furthermore, it is known that the frequency\nand intensity of myoclonic jerks varies. For instance, in\nhumans they may be perceived only internally, as an\nelectric shock-like sensation. For this reason it is possible\nthat owners underestimated the number of episodes that\ntheir cat was suffering. Therefore, the reliance upon clin-\nical historical evidence is likely to overstate the preva-\nlence of GTCS when compared with absences and\nmyoclonic seizures. The spectrum of this syndrome can\nbe further defined should a genetic marker become\napparent for this condition.\nIt is accepted that this study has a number of limita-\ntions; not least the fact that we were relying on owner\naccounts, albeit with clinical correlation to the medical\nhistory provided by primary veterinarians and video\nfootage (in 24% cats). For example, clinical confir\nmation of hearing impairment would require brainstem\nauditory-evoked response or some other form of audi-\ntorytesting,whichwasnotperformedhere.Furthermore,\nhistopathological examination has not been performed,\nmaking it difficult to know if one disease process is more\nlikely than another. However, the consistent observa-\ntions of this syndrome, combined with the large number\nof cats and stringent inclusion criteria, suggest that this\nhas not adversely affected our results. It is accepted that\nthe inclusion of cats with absence seizures is debatable\nas this seizure type has never been reported in this spe-\ncies. However, these individuals had the features that\nallowed inclusion in our cohort as audiogenic seizures\nand, given the consistent descriptions by their owners of\nabsence seizures, it is worthy of mention in this report.\nHowever, electroencephalography would be required to\nconfirm or refute this finding, and to further characterise\nthe myoclonic jerks and GTCSs.\nConclusions\nThis study has defined a previously unreported syn-\ndrome by using a carefully screened questionnaire and\nmedical records. In doing this it has allowed a large\ncohort to be examined with the purposes of genotyping\nthis syndrome. The geriatric nature of this condition is\nsuch that it may be overlooked in older cats that may\npotentially suffer from other concurrent conditions, and\nso this study serves a purpose in informing veterinary\npractitioners of this syndrome. The phenotype is likely\nto be broader than that described but specific criteria\nwere applied to ensure a homogeneous population.\nWork is ongoing to identify the genetic basis of this\ndisorder.\nSupplementary material  The following files are available:\nA copy of the questionnaire given to owners of cats with sus-\npected feline audiogenic reflex seizures.

It is differentiated from spontaneous epilep-\ntic seizures, in which precipitating factors cannot be\nidentified.1 Reflex epilepsy syndrome is therefore one in\nwhich all seizures are precipitated by sensory stimuli.\nHowever, some authors suggest that this definition is too\nrestrictive and only the majority of seizures need to be\nprecipitated by sensory stimuli to constitute a reflex epi-\nlepsy syndrome.2 Audiogenic reflex seizures describe\nthose predominantly induced by sounds.\nReflex seizures may occur in humans with idiopathic,\nsymptomatic or probably symptomatic epilepsies.2\nReflex seizures are reported to be either generalised,\nsuch as absences (non-convulsive), myoclonic jerks or\ntonic\u00adclonic seizures, or focal.1 A specific stimulus may\nresult in isolated absences, myoclonic jerks or general-\nised tonic\u00adclonic seizures (GTCSs), or may cause combi-\nnations of all three. Patients may exhibit reflex and\nspontaneous seizures.2 Myoclonic jerks are by far the\nmost common type of reflex seizures and may manifest\ninitially in the limbs and body, or focally involving just\nthe face or a single limb. Reflex absence seizures are\ncommon in people, with reflex focal seizures being much\nless common.\nIn summary, reflex seizures can occur with any epi-\nlepsy type and the stimulus may be very specific.\nNumerous epileptic seizure syndromes involving reflex\nseizures are described, although a robust classification\nscheme for reflex epilepsies remains elusive.\nAudiogenic reflex seizures in cats\nMark Lowrie1, Claire Bessant2, Robert J Harvey3,\nAndrew Sparkes2 and Laurent Garosi1"
