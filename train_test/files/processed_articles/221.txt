Accordingly, we characterize this process as an\nemancipative value change.\nA third major process involves a society's political institutions. The most\nnotable development in this field has been a massive trend towards more\ndemocracy. This happened in two ways during the past three decades. Most\nobviously, many authoritarian regimes changed into formal democracies by\nadopting democratic constitutions in the `Third Wave of Democratization'\nDorenspleet 2000). At the same time, a more subtle change has taken place\nin established democracies. Since the late 1970s, most of them have imple-\nmented or extended direct democratic institutions (Cronin 1999; Scarrow\n2001) and they have experienced rising levels of direct civic participation\nthese changes as an acceleration of a more enduring historical trend towards\nAs often as the processes of socioeconomic development, emancipative\nvalue change and democratization have been described, they have been called\ninto question (see Randall & Theobald 1998: Chapters 1\u00ad2). It has been\ndebated, for instance, whether these processes manifest irreversible linear\ntrends or follow cyclical patterns with major setbacks; whether they are uni-\nformly global or culture-specific in a way that prescribes an inherently Western\nmodel; and even whether they are desirable or not.\nOne point, however, can be hardly denied: if socioeconomic development,\nemancipative value change and democratization occur, they tend to go\ntogether. Poor societies, whose citizens suffer from scarce resources \u00ad most\nobviously in Sub-Saharan Africa \u00ad tend to be dominated by conformity values\nthat reflect constraints on human autonomy. These societies are usually gov-\nerned by authoritarian regimes. Even if they have a democratic constitution,\nchristian welzel, ronald inglehart & hans-dieter klingemann\n\u00a9 European Consortium for Political Research 2003\nsuch formal democracies seldom operate effectively because highly corrupt\nelites deprive people of their rights (Heller 2000). At the other end of the con-\ntinuum, the citizens of OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment) societies profit from an affluence of individual resources and\ntheir prevailing values are characterized by a stronger emphasis on human\nemancipation. These citizens are usually governed by democratic regimes in\nwhich freedom rights are effectively set in practice. Overall, societal levels of\nindividual resources, emancipative values and effective democracy tend to cor-\nThis insight is not new. In fact, it is conventional wisdom of classical\nDiamond 1992).

Modernization\ntheorists have argued that there are close relations between socioeconomic\ndevelopment, emancipative values and degrees of democracy, but they did not\nsharpen the common focus of these three phenomena. `Modernization' was\neither used as an umbrella term that was defined by enumerating its concrete\ncomponents but not by what integrates them (e.g., Lerner 1968: 385); or it was\ndescribed in such general terms as `functional differentiation' (Mouzelis 1999),\nallowing one to subsume almost anything under `modernization'. In conclu-\nsion, there is no general definition of modernization that clarifies in which\ncommon principle its various components converge.\nEmpirical studies reflect this lack of conceptual integration. Most analyses\nfocus on only one of the three relationships between socioeconomic develop-\nment, value change and democracy. Even the few studies that deal with all\nthree processes dissolve the whole complex into single pairs of relations, each\nthree separate strings.\nFirst, following Lipset (1959), various authors claimed that socioeconomic\ndevelopment helps to establish or sustain democracy (among others, Cutright\nwhile others argue that democracy promotes political stability, provides better\neconomic policies and thus is conducive to socioeconomic development\neconomic development gives rise to `modern' values (Inkeles & Smith 1974;\nthe theory of human development\n\u00a9 European Consortium for Political Research 2003\n`modern' values accelerate socioeconomic development (Putnam 1993;\nanalysts suggest that democracy helps to produce `civic' values (Rustow 1970;\nemerging `civic' values put political elites under popular pressure to institu-\ntionalize democratic rules and to keep these rules effective (Gibson &\nSummarizing these contradictions, Dahl (1998: 35) concluded that `the\nexact nature of the relationship among socioeconomic modernization, democ-\nratization, and the creation of a democratic culture is almost as puzzling\ntoday as it was a quarter-century ago'. It remains puzzling because no one,\nas far as we know, started from the most fundamental question: `What is\nthe common denominator underlying socioeconomic development, emanci-\npative value change and effective democracy?' This question is made all the\nmore pressing by the striking coincidence of these three phenomena, as we\nwill demonstrate. We start from this fundamental question and elaborate\non the syndrome as such before we dissolve the whole complex into separate\nrelations.\nWe unfold a concept based on the principle of `human choice'. This prin-\nciple is implicit in modernization theory (Lewis 1955: 9\u00ad19), but its capacity to\nintegrate related changes in socioeconomic structure, political culture and\nregime institutions has not yet been fully developed. The following section\nunfolds the concept of `human development' as an integrating framework.\nAnand and Sen (2000) introduced the term `human development', arguing\nthat `human choice', or the capability of human beings to choose the lives\nthey want, should be the ultimate measure of social progress. We share this\nhumanistic approach, but, following Welzel (2002a), we elaborate the concept\nof `human development' more comprehensively in a way that includes politi-\ncal culture. Using this framework, we analyze data from the World Values\nSurveys together with socioeconomic data from Vanhanen (1997), civil and\npolitical rights ratings from Freedom House and estimates on elite corruption\nfrom Transparency International. Subsequent sections demonstrate that the\nsyndrome of human development operates across nations, regions and cultural\nzones;that this syndrome is shaped by a process in which socioeconomic devel-\nopment and rising emancipative mass values lead to rising levels of effective\ndemocracy; and that the effect of emancipative values on effective democracy\noperates through their impact on elite integrity. Indeed, elite integrity (i.e., the\nreverse of elite corruption) is the factor that makes formal democracy\neffective.\nchristian welzel, ronald inglehart & hans-dieter klingemann\n\u00a9 European Consortium for Political Research 2003\nTheory\nThe three components of human development\nOur conception follows Welzel (2002), arguing that socioeconomic develop-\nment, rising emancipative values and effective democracy work together in\npromoting human choice among societies (see also, Welzel & Inglehart 2001).\nSocioeconomic development includes a bundle of processes (e.g.,\nurbanization, social mobilization and occupational differentiation) that\nincrease social complexity and multiply social transactions between human\ndencies help to emancipate people from closed in-group discipline, to weaken\nvertical authority relations and to strengthen horizontal bargaining relations,\ngiving people greater autonomy over their resources. Moreover, socioeco-\nnomic development not only individualizes available resources, it also enlarges\nthese resources: rising incomes, skills and information facilities increase\npeople's physical and intellectual resources. Socioeconomic development\ndiminishes the most existential constraints on human choice by increasing\nindividual resources. These resources give people the objective means of\nchoice. This view is as old as Aristotle and has been argued from Adam Smith\nand Karl Marx to Amartya Sen.\nEmancipative cultural change is the second component relevant to human\nchoice. When growing individual resources widen the scope of possible human\nactivities, the strive for self-realization, autonomy and emancipation finds\ngreater leverage, strengthening people's desire to have free choice and control\nover their lives. Rising emancipative values direct people's subjective orienta-\ntions towards human choice, contributing the motives component to this\ntheme. This is consistent with the notion that choice is not only a matter of\none's means but also of one's mind and motivation (Rokeach 1960).\nDemocracy is the third component of human development. It is related to\nhuman choice because it institutionalizes legal rights that guarantee choices\nin people's private and public activity. However, it is important that these\nrights are not only formally guaranteed but work effectively in practice. This\nis what distinguishes effective democracy from formal democracy. Effective\ndemocracy contributes effective rights to human choice and thus represents its\nrules component. Effective democratization, in this sense, is any extension\nof people's effective rights. This notion can be traced back to Mill and\nDewey who saw effective opportunities for `individual self-development'\nIndividual resources, emancipative values and effective rights represent\nthe means, motives and rules components of human development. These com-\nthe theory of human development\n\u00a9 European Consortium for Political Research 2003\nponents are provided by socioeconomic development, emancipative value\nchange and democratization, respectively. Table 1 summarizes this conception\nof human development.\nThe three components of Human Development all coincide in their focus\non human choice. Progress in any of these components improves a society's\n`conditio humana', giving people larger means, stronger motivations and more\neffective guarantees to make use of their personal potential. Human devel-\nopment of societies means growing human choice on a mass level.\nHuman development is not a teleological concept. It does not imply that\nits three components necessarily grow in a linear upward direction. Societies\ncan move in either direction: progressing or regressing. However, our theory\ndoes imply that people's means, motivations and rights tend to develop coin-\ncidentally, either narrowing or widening the range of human choice.\nThe concept of `human development' goes beyond standard modernization\ntheory in having both a wider scope and a sharper focus. Usually, theories\ncannot maximize scope and focus at the same time, but the concept of `human\ndevelopment' does. On the one hand, its scope is comprehensive, integrating\nmajor changes in socioeconomic structure, political culture, and regime insti-\ntutions. On the other hand, this concept is sharply focused on one theme: the\ngrowth (or decline) of human choice.\nchristian welzel, ronald inglehart & hans-dieter klingemann\n\u00a9 European Consortium for Political Research 2003\nTable 1.

These constraints are most existential and pressing in the\nsocioeconomic sphere, when scarce resources deprive people of many options\nin their life. Usually, people tend to adapt their aspirations to these constraints\net al. 2000). This mechanism \u00ad known in social psychology as `aspiration adjust-\nment' (Costa et al. 1987) \u00ad has emerged through human evolution because\nCosmides 1992). Aspiration adjustment leads people to aspire for the most\npressing things first and to avoid wasting energy on unattainable goals\n(Maslow 1988). Downward adjustment of aspirations works against the\nhigher-ordered human strives, in particular for self-expression. Striving for\nself-expression requires freedom and choice, and cannot unfold under press-\ning social constraints. Yet, the striving for self-expression is latent in each\nperson: it follows from the simple fact that human beings are self-conscious.\nThis insight led many theorists \u00ad including Marx, Maslow, Inkeles and\nFlanagan \u00ad to the conclusion that less pressing and more permissive social\nconditions (which offer greater choice) create greater satisfaction and fulfill-\nment. Indeed, data from the World Values Surveys support the view that\ngreater human choice increases individual life satisfaction. In each of 148\nnational representative surveys,conducted in such diverse societies as Uganda,\nChina, Iran, Brazil, Sweden or Poland, there is a highly significant correlation\nbetween people's life satisfaction and their perception of how much choice\nthey have in shaping their live.1\nIf pressing social conditions restrict human choice, people are forced to\nreduce their actual emphasis on self-expression, although this downward\nadjustment of aspirations has psychological costs in that it diminishes life sat-\nisfaction. Downward adjustment of aspirations is nevertheless necessary to\nmake a living under pressing human conditions, such as those prevailing in\npoor societies where scarce resources drive people into a struggle for survival.\nSurvival strategies may constitute a Hobbesian `homo homini lupo' situation\nin which outsiders are distrusted as hostile competitors for scarce resources.\nDistrust towards outsiders forces individuals into rigid in-group discipline\nthe theory of human development\n\u00a9 European Consortium for Political Research 2003\nthat leaves little room for human autonomy. Banfield (1958) examined the\nSouthern Italian community of Montegrano to describe such a typical survival\nsituation. Putnam (1993) reaches similar conclusions in his description of dif-\nferences between Italian citizens of the affluent North and the poor South,\nfinding that Southern Italians distrust their fellow citizens. These citizens tend\nto place emphasis on group discipline, social control, hierarchy, moral rigidity\nand strong authority \u00ad conformity values that prevail under restrictive human\nconditions.\nInglehart (1997) demonstrated for a much wider array of countries that the\npublic's suffering from scarce resources tend to be dominated by conformity\nvalues. Similarly, societies whose people dispose of more individual resources\nplace stronger emphasis on emancipative values. This reflects the fact that the\nbenefits of conformity values recede when existential constraints on human\nchoice fade. Accordingly, conformity values tend to give way to emancipative\nvalues, which is reflected in greater tolerance of human diversity, higher\nlife satisfaction and stronger emphasis on individual freedom. According\nto Flanagan (1987), this value change reflects a functional mechanism of\naspiration adjustment at the societal level.\nThe Motives-Rules Linkage: Living an emancipated life involves activities,\nboth private and public, that require a legal space based on effective freedom\nrights. Emancipative orientations are therefore inherently directed towards\neffective rights. So, if emancipative orientations gain momentum among the\nbroader public, their directedness towards effective rights should be conse-\nquential for the stability of political regimes.\nIf growing individual resources give rise to emancipative orientations\nwithin an autocracy, people will consider authoritarian rule as an illegitimate\nrestriction of their rights. Confronted with an elite unwilling to democratize,\nthese people will withdraw as much material and moral support as they can.\nThis makes authoritarian rule increasingly ineffective and costly. The exhaus-\ntion of a regime's resources and the loss of legitimacy make two events more\nlikely: that a faction of the elite splits off in an attempt to regain legitimacy by\nmobilizing popular support for liberal reforms (Przeworski 1992), and that\ndemocratic dissidents campaign for holding free elections (see Foweraker &\nand spread of emancipative orientations, the mobilization of the public will\nthen be channeled in the direction of democratization, helping to terminate\nan authoritarian regime and to establish freedom rights.\nIf emancipative orientations grow in a democracy, the likely result is not\nregime change but an increasing effectiveness of given freedom rights. A\nsociety may be organized as a formal democracy such that all the basic\nfreedom rights are legally guaranteed, but legal guarantees do not necessarily\nchristian welzel, ronald inglehart & hans-dieter klingemann\n\u00a9 European Consortium for Political Research 2003\nmake these rights effective. Even a democracy can be ruled by corrupt elites\nwho deprive the citizens of their rights. In a poor society that is dominated by\nconformity values, most citizens have neither the resources nor the motivation\nto form effective popular pressure such that the elites feel urged to respect\npeople's rights. However, in a society in which emancipative values are more\nstrongly pronounced, people will be more willing to exert public pressure\nto keep the elites accountable. Usually, these citizens also dispose of the\nresources to make their pressure effective. As noted by Verba et al. (1978: 73),\n`in all nations, citizens appear to convert socioeconomic resources into politi-\ncal involvement'.\nIn democracies, elites are recruited from the electorate. Thus, changing\nvalues among the citizens will affect the elites as well. So, if there is a shift\ntoward emancipative values in the population, the elites also will be affected\nby these values. Data from the World Values Surveys support this assumption,\ndemonstrating that people with university degrees place more emphasis on\nemancipation than do ordinary citizens (Welzel 2003: 278). Yet the cross-\nnational differences in emphasis on emancipation are just as large among\npeople with university degrees as they are among the ordinary citizens. Given\nthat elites are overwhelmingly recruited from people with university educa-\ntion, this finding suggests that a public's emphasis on emancipation is well\nrepresented among its elites.\nIf the elites are influenced by emancipative values, they are more likely to\nconsider corrupt behavior as an illegitimate violation of freedom rights. Thus,\nthere are two reasons why a societal shift towards emancipative values will\nreduce corrupt elite behavior and increase the effectiveness of given rights.\nOne is that the masses dispose of more resources and stronger motivations to\nput elites under popular pressure. The other reason is that the elites are, by\ntheir own beliefs, willing to respect people's rights. From a rational choice\nperspective, there is no reason to expect that elites avoid maximizing their\nbenefits through corruption, unless their own values or popular pressure\neliminate this option from rational calculation.\nConsider now the reverse relation: Can freedom rights by their mere pres-\nence create emancipative values among the citizens? Our answer is `no', unless\nthe resources which feed these values are present. For example, consider India:\nthough offering its citizens a wide array of freedom rights during 50 years of\nformal democracy, most Indians did not develop a correspondingly strong\nemphasis on human emancipation (as is demonstrated by India's location in\nFigures 1A and 2A). On the other hand, former Czechoslovakia provided its\ncitizens with much narrower freedom rights under four decades of communist\nrule, but the Czechs (and, to a lesser degree, the Slovaks) developed much\nstronger emphasis on emancipation than most of the Indians did \u00ad in keeping\nthe theory of human development\n\u00a9 European Consortium for Political Research 2003\nwith their greater material and intellectual resources (see again Figure 1A).\nThis does not mean that formal democracy cannot exist without correspond-\ning emancipative values. Actually it can, as the Indian example shows. Yet, if\nso, formal democracy is likely to be ineffective. To be practiced effectively,\nformal rights need corresponding values, but cannot create them. Formal\nrights are only an institutional offer that cannot by itself create the demands\nthat make it effective. In conclusion, effective democracy is the consequence\nrather than the cause of emancipative mass values.\nFormal democracy and effective democracy\nThe Indian case illustrates how important it is to differentiate between formal\ndemocracy and effective democracy. India is without doubt a formal democ-\nracy that guarantees its citizens a wide array of freedom rights, but as Heller\nhas pointed out (2001), most Indians do not have the resources enabling them\nto exert their rights effectively. They also do not place so much emphasis on\nemancipation that they are willing to insist on fully practicing their rights. In\nterms of effective democracy, India ranks closer to China than to Japan (see\nFigure 2A), although India has a democratic constitution.\nDemocracy is central to human development because it gives the citizens\nformal rights. Codifying these rights creates formal democracy, which is a nec-\nessary component of effective democracy:without formal democracy there can\nbe no effective democracy. Yet formal rights are not sufficient to make democ-\nracy effective. Formal rights are effective to the extent that the elites respect\nthese rights in their actual behavior. Law-abiding elite behavior, or what we\ncall `elite integrity', is an expression of the `rule of law' that, as Linz and Stepan\n(1996) and many others have claimed, distinguishes effective democracy from\nformal democracy. Hence, in order to measure effective democracy, we weigh\nformal democracy by elite integrity, using elite integrity as a grading factor\nthat either downgrades or upgrades given levels of formal democracy.\nThe mass-system linkage in human development\nOur theory of human development maintains that effective democracy is\nlinked to emancipative mass values and that these values are in turn linked to\npeople's available resources. However, while the linkage between effective\ndemocracy and emancipative values becomes manifest only at the societal\nlevel, the linkage between emancipative values and available resources\noriginates at the individual level from where it simply accumulates to the\nsocietal level. This accumulation reflects mass tendencies that are important\nto understand the mass-system linkage in human development.\nchristian welzel, ronald inglehart & hans-dieter klingemann\n\u00a9 European Consortium for Political Research 2003\nEvidence that the linkage between available resources and emancipative\nvalues originates at the individual level is given by the fact that individuals\nwith more resources show a significantly stronger emphasis on emancipation\n(see the section on data sources and measurement below for a description of\nthese variables): within each of 112 opinion polls from the World Values\nSurveys there is a significantly positive correlation between individuals'\nemphasis on emancipation and their income and education. On average, these\nindividual-level correlations within nations point to r = 0.29 (standard devia-\ntion: 0.08).2 Yet compared to the societal level, where we measure a 0.91\ncorrelation, the correlation is relatively weak at the individual level within\nnations. Why this is so can be explained by gravity effects, reflecting mass\ntendencies within populations.\nNational communities are held together by institutions that socialize citi-\nzens into common traditions. Accordingly, nations tend to create distinguished\n`central tendencies' among their citizens' prevailing values. Thus, there is\nlarger variance in value orientations between citizens of different nations than\nbetween those of the same nations. Of course, emphasis on emancipation\nvaries considerably between individuals within nations. Yet, within each nation\na majority of the individuals cluster near their nation's mean emphasis on\nemancipation. In other words, most people's emphasis on emancipation is\nclose to the average citizen's emphasis. However, these averages vary enor-\nmously from nation to nation (see Figure 2A on p. 369). In fact, the national\naverages in emphasis on emancipation capture fully 40 per cent of the total\nindividual-level variance among all people ever surveyed in four waves of the\nWorld Values Surveys. This is a remarkable proportion, with only 73 national\nunits accounting for nearly half of the variance among 158,802 individuals (this\nis more than 2,000 times the random likelihood).\nThe relevance of nations' mass tendencies becomes evident when one\nrecognizes another regularity in social sciences: variations in an independent\nvariable x do never perfectly translate into corresponding variations of a\ndependent variable y. All known relationships in social reality are probabilis-\ntic, showing a `range of uncertainty' within which variations in x are not\nreflected in corresponding variations in y (Inglehart & Welzel 2003). Only\nlarge variations in x that exceed this uncertainty range are reflected in corre-\nsponding variations of y.\nFrom this point of view, consider the relation between available resources\nand emancipative values and assume that both variables show relatively con-\ncentrated distributions within nations. This implies that only a minority of indi-\nviduals deviates largely from the national averages in both variables. In other\nwords, the majority of individuals is bound in the uncertainty range within\nwhich variations in available resources are not reflected in corresponding\nthe theory of human development\n\u00a9 European Consortium for Political Research 2003\nvariations in emancipative values, which necessarily produces a small\nindividual-level correlation within nations. Yet across nations, most individu-\nals' resources deviate so largely from the global mean that they exceed the\nrange beyond which corresponding deviations in emancipative values occur.\nIn this case, the individual-level correlation is stronger across than within\nnations. Therefore, it is important to take cross-national variation into account:\nthis makes individual-level relations visible that are otherwise hidden by the\nnations' mass tendencies.\nThe nations' mass tendencies are reproduced through social processes that\naffect national populations uniformly but to degrees that vary largely between\nthem. The growth of individual resources is a typical process of this kind.\nGermany is one among many examples where most people's financial income\nis close to the average national income. This was so 40 years ago and it is still\nso today. However, during these 40 years the average individual income has\nquadrupled, with little effect on the distribution of incomes (Zapf & Habich\n1999). Hence, income growth is a process that affects national populations\nrather uniformly, although this process varies enormously between nations. As\nnoted by Landes (1998: xx), 200 years ago the income ratio of the richest to\nthe poorest nations was approximately 5:1. Uneven economic growth has\ndramatically raised this ratio to 400:1 today. Thus, economic development\nmoves through nations in a way that reproduces their central tendencies to a\nconsiderable degree, while it creates much greater disparity between them. As\na consequence, any effect connected to growing individual resources, such as\nrising emancipative values, must be more pronounced between than within\nnations.\nIf two related variables show distributions that are concentrated within and\ndivergent between nations, the individual-level correlation must be stronger\nacross than within nations. Across nations, the correlation becomes even\nstronger when the respective variables are averaged to the nation level. The\nreason of this regular phenomenon is that aggregation eliminates random\nvariations at the individual level. Survey data usually contain much random\nvariation due to measurement error: many respondents give erratic answers\nthat reflect `non-attitudes', producing a good deal of random noise at the indi-\nvidual level (Converse 1970). These measurement errors increase the random\nterms in correlations, which produces small correlations at the individual level\nlargely random, one can reduce these errors through aggregation. Averaging\nindividual-level data to the nation level diminishes measurement error\nbecause random deviations to the left and right of a national mean simply\ncancel each other out (Page & Shapiro 1993: 40). Consequently, the random\nchristian welzel, ronald inglehart & hans-dieter klingemann\n\u00a9 European Consortium for Political Research 2003\nterm of a correlation becomes smaller and the correlation as such becomes\nlarger through aggregation. In the presence of random measurement error,\naggregation does not obscure but reveals the `real' correlation.\nAnother question refers to the essential meaning of aggregate data, such\nas a nation's average emphasis on emancipation. Is this average a real\ncommunity characteristic? Of course, this average is calculated from each\nindividual's responses. Yet, for each individual the average reflects to practi-\ncally 100 per cent the responses of all other individuals. Thus, aggregate figures\nrepresent mass tendencies that are almost perfectly exogenous to the individ-\nuals from which they are calculated. It is therefore not mistaken to consider\na nation's average emancipative orientation as a feature of this nation. The\nnation level is the level at which emancipative orientations get linked with\ndemocracy.\nThe linkage between emancipative mass values and effective democracy\nreflects a relation between two different sorts of societal characteristics. Eman-\ncipative values represent an aggregated mass characteristic that accumulates\nfrom the individual level. By contrast, effective democracy is a genuine system\ncharacteristic that does not exist at the individual level. Yet the difference\nbetween mass characteristics and system characteristics does not invalidate the\nquestion of their relationship. Quite the contrary, this question is at the heart\nof democratic theory because democratic theory is interested in the relation-\nship between the citizens and their political regimes. In this sense, democratic\ntheory searches for the mass-system linkage. If such a mass-system linkage\nshould exist, it must be reflected in the relation between a mass variable, such\nas emancipative values, and a system variable, such as effective democracy.\nHuman development theory focuses on precisely this linkage.\nAnalyses\nData sources and measurement\nIn order to measure emancipative values, we use the largest available data set\n\u00ad the European/World Values Surveys (EVS/WVS), which cover 73 countries\nrepresenting 80 per cent of the world's population.3 We measure emancipative\nvalues using a scale of factor scores summarizing several attitudes that\nInglehart and Baker (2000) have proposed as indicators of self-expression\nvalues.

In a way, it is natural that people who emphasize their own liberty\nrespect other people's liberty as well. Emancipative values, in this sense, reflect\nthe logic and the experience of mutual human exchange, which rests on giving\nand taking: people tend to treat their peers like they have been and want to\nbe treated by them (Axelrod 1983). Thus, emancipative values not only include\nan `ego-emphasizing' attitude, reflected in liberty aspirations4 and an inclina-\ntion to protest activities (such as signing petitions)5, but also an attitude of\nopenness towards `alter-ego', as reflected in tolerance of human diversity and\ninterpersonal trust (see the notes to Table 2 for the operationalization of these\nvariables). Moreover, emancipative values are linked with greater life satis-\nfaction, which implies that striving for freedom, autonomy and emancipation\nis embedded in human motivation, leading to greater satisfaction and fulfill-\nment. Finally, as a typical conformity value, strong religiousness is negatively\nlinked with emancipative values.\nAs expected, factor loadings increase systematically from the individual\nlevel within nations to the pooled individual level to the aggregate level across\nnations. The reasons were explicated in the previous section: first, there are\npronounced mass tendencies within nations that bound individual value ori-\nentations into a relatively small range. Individual-level variations within this\nrange are to a large degree random. Thus, the linkage between individual-level\nattitudes is not so clearly structured within nations: hence, the smallest factor\nloadings at the individual level within nations. Second, variations in mass\ntendencies between national populations are more pronounced and less\nrandom than individual-level variations within nations. Therefore, taking\ncross-national variation into account by pooling individual-level data brings\nthe linkage between individual-level attitudes more clearly to the fore: hence,\nthe factor loadings are larger at the pooled individual level than at the indi-\nvidual level within nations. Finally, there are still measurement errors at the\nindividual level. Averaging the data to the national level eliminates these\nerrors, making the linkage between mass attitudes even more evident: hence,\nthe strongest factor loadings occur at the aggregate level.\nIn subsequent analyses, we examine emancipative mass values that are\nmeasured in either the early or the mid-1990s. In order to keep the number\nof observations as large as possible, we replaced measures of the early 1990s\nwith those of the mid-1990s when the former were not available (or vice\nversa). The Appendix gives a detailed description of these procedures. Pooling\nvalue orientations from slightly different points of time is unproblematic\nbecause value change proceeds slowly. Accordingly, a public's emancipative\norientation at one point in time is highly indicative for its orientation at a\nslightly earlier or later point in time. Indeed, the predictive quality of eman-\nvice versa) is above 90 per cent. Not making use of this strong relationship\nwould be a waste of information.\nThe means component of human development \u00ad individual resources \u00ad is\nmeasured using Vanhanen's (1997) `index of power resources'. This index com-\nbines aggregate measures of physical and intellectual resources, and a measure\nof social complexity. We use Vanhanen's most recent version of this index that\ncaptures the early 1990s.6 This measure is preferable to single indicators such\nas per capita GDP (gross domestic product). The use of GDP has been criti-\ncized for good reasons. Anand and Sen (2000) have argued that per capita\nGDP is an incomplete measure of a society's human resources. Moreover,\nGDP does not include the distribution of resources, although from the view-\nequal distribution of resources is a crucial precondition for the functioning of\ndemocracy. Finally, social complexity (which is important for the individual-\nization of resources) is also not tapped by GDP.\nFor these reasons, the Human Development Index has been constructed to\nprovide a more complete measure of individual resources (United Nations\nDevelopment Program 2000). However, this index has its own limitations. One\nof its three components \u00ad life expectancy \u00ad does not measure individual\nresources at all. By contrast, the Vanhanen index captures individual resources\nin all aspects that are relevant to our theory of human development. It mea-\nsures both physical and intellectual resources, and it measures not only levels\nbut also the distribution of these resources. Finally, it includes a measure of\nsocial complexity. In the theoretical perspective of human development, this\nis the most appropriate index to measure individual resources.\nThe institutional component of human development \u00ad effective democracy\n\u00ad is measured using the Freedom House scores for civil and political rights and\nestimates from Transparency International on elite corruption.7 The scores\nfrom Freedom House range from 1 to 7 on both the civil and the political\nrights scales, with 1 indicating the highest and 7 the lowest level of freedom.8\nresulting scores so that higher figures indicate a broader scope of freedom\nrights. Finally, we equaled the highest possible score (28) with 100 and\nstandardized all other scores on this value. This allows an interpretation in\npercentages: a score of 75 indicates that a country reaches 75 per cent of the\npossible maximum in freedom rights. The scores from Freedom House are\nexpert judgments that estimate the scope of given rights. We interpret these\nchristian welzel, ronald inglehart & hans-dieter klingemann\n\u00a9 European Consortium for Political Research 2003\nestimates as a measure of formal democracy, which is a necessary but insuffi-\ncient element of effective democracy.\nThe Freedom House scores are imperfect measures of freedom rights. They\nneglect the extent to which given rights are respected by actual elite behav-\nior. In order to measure how much given rights are respected by a society's\noffice holders, we use the corruption perception scores from Transparency\nInternational.9 These scores, too, reflect expert judgments, estimating how\ncorrupt the political, bureaucratic and economic office holders of a country\nbehave. Corruption is a reasonable indicator for the effectiveness of people's\nrights, showing how far private and public services are provided on the basis\nof bribes instead of rights. Basing services on bribes always means a violation\nof the rule of law and that people are deprived of their rights: if bribery\ngoverns the provision of services, people do not obtain what they are legally\nentitled to obtain (see Rose 2001 for a similar argument). The corruption per-\ncorruption and 10 indicating an absence of corruption among office holders.\nPositively coined, this index provides a measure of `elite integrity', reflecting\nhow strictly office holders abstain from corruption and follow the law. We\ntransformed this index standardizing it to a maximum of 1.0.\nAs argued in the previous section, we operationalize effective democracy\nas the interaction between formal democracy and elite integrity, multiplying\nformal democracy (0 to 100 scale) with elite integrity (0 to 1 scale):\nIn this equation, elite integrity is the weighing factor that grades formal\ndemocracy, making it more or less effective. Since elite integrity operates as a\ngrading factor, it cannot compensate for a low level of formal democracy: even\na maximum elite integrity of 1.0 cannot do more than reproduce the level of\nformal democracy that is given. As has been shown in a two-dimensional plot\n(Welzel 2003: 287), to reach a high score in effective democracy is much less\neasy than obtaining a high score in formal democracy.\nIn summary, we have measures of the spread of individual resources, the\nstrength of emancipative values and the degree of effective democracy in soci-\neties. These measures refer to different points in time and are obtained from\ncompletely different sources. Given that these measures are imperfect and\nmay have considerable measurement error, any systematic relationship\nEffective\nDemocracy\nFormal\nDemocracy\nElite\nIntegrity\n= *\n( ) ( ) ( )\nthe theory of human development\n\u00a9 European Consortium for Political Research 2003\nbetween them points all the more to the conclusion that they capture some\nrobust aspect of reality.\nOperationalizing cultural zones\nIn order to test the general applicability of human development theory, one\nquestion must be answered: `Are the two linkages of human development\nuniversal in their presence across cultural zones?' The theory of human de-\nvelopment can only be considered as a general theory if cultural zones are dif-\nferentiated in ways that reflect the logic of human development.\nemphasized that nations cluster into larger units labeled `cultural zones' or\n`civilizations'. Nations belonging to the same cultural zone tend to share\nsimilar worldviews, institutional traditions and patterns of economic sub-\nsistence. Thus, cultural zones can be considered as `supra-national units of\ndiffusion' that let nations follow similar patterns of societal development.\nThree variables have been considered as typical characteristics of cultural\nzones: historical traditions (reflected in common religious roots), imperial\nlegacies, and region or vicinity (a spatial factor that facilitates diffusion\nbetween nations) (Kopstein & Reilly 2000).\nEach of the gray shadowed areas in Table 3 summarizes a group of nations\nin a distinguished cultural zone. The first criterion of this classification is\nreligious tradition, which produces 18 countries with a historically Protestant\ntradition; 27 Catholic countries; 10 Christian Orthodox countries; 10 Islamic\ncountries; and a residual category of 5 countries in the tradition of an `Asian'\nreligion, such as Buddhism, Hinduism or Confucianism (a quasi-religion).\nThese five religious groups were subdivided for region or imperial legacy,\nif there were enough cases to allow for such a division. Thus, the Catholic\ncountries were divided into the zones of `Catholic Western Europe', `Catholic\nEastern Europe' and `Latin America'. The division between Western and\nEastern Europe reflects whether a country belonged to the Soviet communist\nempire or not. Latin America as well not only represents an own region, but\nis distinguished by its Iberian imperial legacy.\nFor some countries, specific decisions had to be made. Among the Asian\ncountries, we saw no criterion to group China and India together with other\nnations. According to Huntington (1996), both of these countries, each with a\npopulation of more than one billion, represents a `civilization' of its own. On\nthe other hand, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan share a Confucian tradition\nand have in common that they are economically far advanced. Thus we\nsummarized them as `Developed Far East'. Moreover, Estonia and Latvia,\nalthough having a Protestant tradition, were grouped with the Catholic\nchristian welzel, ronald inglehart & hans-dieter klingemann\n\u00a9 European Consortium for Political Research 2003\nthe theory of human development\n\u00a9 European Consortium for Political Research 2003\nTable 3. The location of the WVS nations within cultural zones and regions\n360 christian welzel, ronald inglehart & hans-dieter klingemann\n\u00a9 European Consortium for Political Research 2003\nEastern European countries with which they share the legacy of Soviet com-\nmunism and the tradition of `Western Christianity', as opposed to Orthodox\ncountries have not been divided on the basis of religion. Although there are\nChristian and Islamic influences in Sub-Saharan Africa, there remain specific\nBlack African imprints, based on this region's animist religious roots and its\ndistinctive ethnic make-up. This justifies classifying the Sub-Saharan countries\nas a specific cultural zone (Huntington 1996).\nOur classification is crude. Yet, it captures respectively 85, 84 and 83 per\ncent of the variance in individual resources, emancipative values and effective\ndemocracy across 73 nations. Even this crude classification designates\nrelatively homogeneous zones.\nIn addition to this differentiation of `cultural zones', we use a more fine-\ntuned classification based on 24 smaller `regions', such as Scandinavia, the\nBaltics, Transcaucasia, Mediterranean Europe, Central America and so forth.\nThese regions are marked by the smaller boxes in Table 3. The regional clas-\nsification captures 93, 92 and 91 per cent of the cross-national variance in indi-\nvidual resources, emancipative values and effective democracy. Though the\nclassification into regions entails more than twice as many categories as the\nclassification into cultural zones, it explains only 8 per cent more of the cross-\nnational variance, confirming the adequacy of the cultural zones in Table 3.\nThe human development linkages in cross-cultural perspective\nNations, regions and cultural zones form a three-level hierarchy, with nations\nnested inside regions and regions inside cultural zones. From this perspective,\nthe question is whether there are `frictions' in the cross-level translation of the\ntwo linkages of human development: `Do these linkages translate from the\nnational to the regional to the cultural zone level with or without frictions?'\nIf there are frictions, human development could not be considered as a general\ntheory because its linkages would vary depending on the level at which they\nare observed. Using regression models, such frictions become evident to the\nextent that the intercepts and slopes of the two human development linkages\nvary at different levels of aggregation.\nAs Table 4 demonstrates, the human development linkages do not sub-\nstantially vary in either their intercepts or slopes at different levels of aggre-\ngation. Whether at the national, regional or cultural zone level, intercepts\nand slopes remain virtually constant. The correlations, of course, increase\nsystematically with higher levels of aggregation, indicating that random vari-\nation among lower-level units is averaged out through aggregation to higher-\nlevel units. Yet, apart from the correlations, neither intercepts nor slopes vary\nthe theory of human development\n\u00a9 European Consortium for Political Research 2003\nTable 4.

Thus, we formulate the relation between individual\nresources and emancipative values, and that between emancipative values and\neffective democracy in two-level models. The levels of variation are indicated\nwith suffix `j' for the national level and suffix `k' for the cultural zone level.\nAllowing intercepts and slopes to vary produces a `random intercepts/random\nslopes model' that is written as follows:\nWe can express the composition of intercept and slope as follows:\nIntercept and slope are each composed of a fixed part that is constant\nacross cultural zones (b0\n) and a variable part that differs for cultural zones\n). In addition, there is an error term for nations' remaining variation\n(ejk\n). This variation is random and can neither be attributed to the overall\neffects nor to their variation for cultural zones.\nAs Table 5 shows, the overall effects of both linkages are highly significant,\ngreatly exceeding their standard errors. Hence, there exist overall effects of\nindividual resources on emancipative values and of emancipative values on\neffective democracy that are independent of cultural zones. Compared to\nthese overall effects, the cultural zone-related variances of intercepts and\nslopes are negligible. They do not capture significant proportions of the\nvariance that remains unexplained by the overall effects. This can be seen\nby calculating the share that the intercept and slope variances have in the\nunexplained variance: only the intercept variance in the model explaining\nemancipative values captures more than 20 per cent of the random variance.\nHowever, the random variance is small because only a little variance is left\nunexplained by the overall effects. Hence, the intercept variance captures\nnegligible 3.8 per cent of the total variance. Overall, the two linkages of human\ndevelopment show little variation for cultural zones.\nStill another way to model these findings is to control the effect of indi-\nvidual resources on emancipative values for the cultural zone level of eman-\ncipative values. In other words, we assign to each nation its cultural zone\nIntercept\nSlope\n:\n:\nb b\nb b\nk k\nk k\nu\nu\n= +\n= +\nEmancVals IndivResour\nEffecDemoc EmancVals\njk k k jk jk\njk k k jk jk\ne\ne\n= + +\n= + +\nb b\nb b\n*\n*\n\u00ad\naverage in emancipative values and introduce this variable as an additional\npredictor. Thus, we test the extent to which a nation's own emphasis on eman-\ncipation is a function of the average emphasis found in its cultural zone, treat-\ning the single nations' emphasis on emancipation as a function of diffusion\nwithin cultural zones. In order to avoid a tautological measure of cultural zone\ndiffusion, we assign each nation the mean cultural zone level calculated by\nexcluding a given nation's own value. Hence, we specify for each nation an\nexogenous cultural zone effect, which is crucial for the concept of diffusion.\nSimilarly, we estimate the effect of emancipative values on effective democ-\nracy, controlling for the cultural zone level of effective democracy.\nThe results of these regressions are shown in Table 6. As is evident, the\neffects of individual resources on emancipative values and of emancipative\nvalues on effective democracy remain highly significant across nations, even\ncontrolling for diffusion within cultural zones. This confirms our previous\nfinding: the two linkages of human development are independent of cultural\nzones to a considerable degree. On the other hand, cultural zones as well show\na significant impact. In fact, diffusion within cultural zones captures 30 per cent\nthe theory of human development\n\u00a9 European Consortium for Political Research 2003\nTable 5.

Why this is\nso, is demonstrated in Figures 1 and 2.\nFigures 1A and 2A show the linkages of human development across\nnations, and Figures 1B and 2B across regions and cultural zones. We can see\nthat both linkages are clearly shaped across nations, although the confidence\nintervals within which these linkages appear are relatively broad. This points\nto relatively large `ranges of uncertainty' within which the linkages do not\nappear. `Ranges of uncertainty' can be examined in the vertical dimension (y)\nor in the horizontal dimension (x). The range of uncertainty in x, for instance,\nis the horizontal distance between the left and the right boundaries of the con-\nfidence interval. This distance is constant for any value of y, since the confi-\ndence interval has parallel boundaries. What does this range of uncertainty\nmean?\nConsider Figure 2A and assume you begin traveling from weaker to\nstronger emancipative values (i.e., from left to right) starting at any point of\nthe left boundary of the confidence interval: as long as you travel a horizon-\ntal distance that is shorter than the `range of uncertainty', it is not certain that\nthe next society you meet is farther advanced in effective democracy than the\nprevious one. Within this range, there is much random variation in effective\ndemocracy. Yet once your travel from weaker to stronger emancipative values\nexceeds the range of uncertainty, there is more than 95 per cent probability\nthat the next society you meet actually is farther advanced in effective democ-\nracy. The same logic applies to the relation between individual resources and\nemancipative values (see Figure 1A). You must exceed a certain distance in\nthe growth of individual resources in order to be certain that the next society\nyou meet shows stronger emphasis on emancipation. This distance represents\na threshold in the effect of individual resources on emancipative values.\nNow consider Figures 1B and 2B. It is evident that the horizontal distances\ncovered by cultural zones are so small that they hardly exceed the threshold\nbeyond which the two linkages of human development appear. Obviously\nthere is diffusion, clustering regions and nations into relatively homogenous\ncultural zones. In other words, the largest cross-national differences are\nbetween and not within cultural zones. So the decisive question is whether the\nlinkages of human development operate across these cultural zones. Figures\n1B and 2B leave little doubt that this is actually the case. The means-motives\nlinkage and the motives-rules linkage do work across cultural zones. In other\nwords, these linkages are so pronounced across nations because they operate\nacross the units that homogenize nations.\nThe human development syndrome is strikingly evident at the cross-\ncultural level. It is present there to an even higher degree than cultural zones\nhomogenize nations: cultural zones capture nearly 85 per cent of the cross-\nnational variance in each of the three components of human development, but\nthe linkages between these components explain more than 90 per cent of the\ncross-cultural variation. In conclusion, the linkages of human development are\nnot culture-specific but universal. Cultural zones differ from each other in\nways that reflect the logic of human development.\nThe genesis of human development\nAccording to our theory, growing individual resources on a mass level tend to\nshift a society's values toward greater emphasis on human emancipation.\nGrowing mass emphasis on emancipation then channels popular pressure in\nthe direction of effective democracy. The most debatable assumption in this\nargument concerns the causal relation between mass values and democratic\ninstitutions.A number of writers have claimed that the causal relation between\npolitical culture and political institutions operates into the opposite direction:\nonly democratic institutions can produce pro-democratic values (Rustow 1970;\nIf this is correct, emancipative mass values should be the consequence\nof a nation's preceding democratic tradition rather than the cause of its\nsubsequent democratic performance. This assumption can be tested. For this\npurpose, we specified a cross-national path model that starts from individual\nwith emancipative values as of the mid-1990s and ends up with effective\nvalues should have a stronger effect on subsequent democracy than prior\ndemocratic traditions have on emancipative values. If the opposite assump-\ntion is correct, the contrary should hold true.\nThe path model in Figure 3 supports human development theory. While\ndemocratic traditions have no effect on emancipative values, emancipative\nvalues do have a significant impact on subsequent degrees of effective democ-\nracy. This effect holds up controlling for individual resources and democratic\ntraditions. Hence, in explaining effective democracy, the linkages of human\ndevelopment seem to be more important than democratic traditions, implying\nthat growing individual resources give rise to emancipative mass values that\nin turn tend to promote effective democracy \u00ad even if there is a weak demo-\ncratic legacy from the past.\nTo figure out how the impact of emancipative values on effective democ-\nracy works, we decomposed effective democracy into its components: elite\nintegrity and formal democracy. Controlling for all other effects in the model,\nchristian welzel, ronald inglehart & hans-dieter klingemann\n\u00a9 European Consortium for Political Research 2003\nelite integrity proves to be the only factor with a significant impact on formal\ndemocracy. This reflects that elites are the prime force in shaping formal\ndemocracy. Indeed, the scope of freedom rights is determined by what the\nelites write into the constitutions \u00ad a basic premise of the elite approach\nOn another point, however, adherents of this approach seem to be wrong.\nObviously, elite behavior is not such an independent factor as they assume.\nQuite the contrary, emancipative mass values have a sound effect on elite\nintegrity. In other words, the impact of mass culture on effective democracy\noperates primarily through its impact on elite behavior. Mass emphasis on\nhuman emancipation tends to produce `proper' elites who act in ways that\nmake formal democracy effective.\nThere is little reason to assume a reverse causation in the relationship\nbetween emancipative values and elite integrity. Elites may have possibilities\nto influence public opinion in specific issues. However, such deeply rooted\nvalues as emphasis on human emancipation cannot simply be created by elite\ncampaigns. Elites can appeal to such values but not create them.

From a rational choice perspective, elites have no reason\nto avoid maximizing their benefits by corruption, unless there are severe\nrestrictions on such behavior. An emancipative mass culture constitutes cer-\ntainly one of the strongest of these restrictions. Such a culture either trans-\nlates into powerful public pressure against corruption-seeking elites or it\ncreates elites whose own beliefs eliminate corruption as a legitimate option.\nSpecifying legal sanctions against breaches of the law is not enough to avoid\nthem, if there is strong elite consensus in holding these sanctions ineffective.\nIn conclusion, we maintain that the most plausible reading of the evidence is\nthat mass emphasis on human emancipation increases elite integrity rather\nthan the reverse.\nConclusion\nSocioeconomic development, rising emancipative values and democratization\nconstitute a coherent syndrome of social progress. Modernization theorists did\nnot invest much effort to sharpen this syndrome's common focus. By contrast,\nthe concept of `human development', as introduced by Anand and Sen, pro-\nvides a potential conception of this focus, but this potential has not been fully\nexploited. Thus far, the concept has neither included mass values nor elite\nintegrity. We followed Welzel in describing human development as a targeted\nsyndrome, arguing that the underlying theme of its three components is human\nchoice: socioeconomic development provides people the objective means of\nchoice; rising emancipative mass values strengthen people's subjective orien-\ntation towards choice; and formal democracy grants people the legal guaran-\ntees of choice, which are made effective by responsive elites.\nInglehart and Baker proposed a revised theory of modernization, showing\nthat cultural zones have a significant additional impact on the effect that indi-\nvidual resources have on emancipative values. We go one step further here in\nthat we add effective democracy as a third component to individual resources\nand emancipative values, arguing that these three components converge in a\nmore comprehensive syndrome of human development. Furthermore,we have\nargued that the role of cultural zones is not one that operates against the\nmechanisms of human development. To be sure, diffusion within cultural zones\nhomogenizes nations to a considerable degree, but this does not cancel the\nmechanisms of human development. It raises them to a higher level of\noperation: the way in which cultural zones differ follows the logic of human\ndevelopment. Thus, in cultural zones where people have larger individual\nresources, emphasis on human emancipation is stronger; and in cultural zones\nchristian welzel, ronald inglehart & hans-dieter klingemann\n\u00a9 European Consortium for Political Research 2003\nwhere emphasis on human emancipation is stronger, there is a higher degree\nof effective democracy.\nThe empirical evidence indicates that the syndrome of human development\nis shaped by a causal priority of individual resources and emancipative values\nover effective democracy. Democracy is effective only to the degree that it\nfinds support by a mass culture that emphasizes human emancipation. Such\nan emancipative culture needs a socioeconomic basis that reduces existential\nconstraints on human autonomy. Effective democracy is an evolutionary\nphenomenon that cannot be simply created through intelligent constitutional\nengineering. The emergence of effective democracy reflects changes appear-\ning at the mass basis of societies. Effective democracy is linked to these\nchanges by the emancipative logic of human development. Due to this logic,\neffective democracy improves the institutional basis of human choice.\nThe data we used are, of course, imperfect measures. The Vanhanen index\nof individual resources, the measures of emancipative values from the World\nValues Surveys, the freedom rights scores from Freedom House and the cor-\nruption estimates from Transparency International may all contain a consid-\nerable amount of estimation error. However, if the measurement error of\nthese variables were large, it would be highly unlikely for one to be able to\nfind such strong correlations as we did \u00ad unless all involved variables would\nbe biased by the same systematic measurement error. Yet this is also highly\nunlikely because these variables measure clearly distinguished phenomena at\ndifferent times and are taken from completely different sources. This points\nall the more to the conclusion that the strong linkages we found capture rel-\nevant aspects of social reality. These linkages can therefore be considered as\na cross-validation of an underlying dimension \u00ad namely, human development.\n"
