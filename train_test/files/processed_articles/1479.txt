STIs\nappear to be acquired rapidly after sexual initiation, which\nreinforces the need for prevention efforts, including HPV vaccination,\nwell before the onset of sexual activity.\nabstract\nOBJECTIVE: Most young women initiate sexual activity during adoles-\ncence; risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) accompanies this\ninitiation. In this study we estimated the prevalence of the most com-\nmon STIs among a representative sample of female adolescents in the\nUnited States.\nMETHODS: Data were analyzed from 838 females who were aged 14 to\n19 and participating in the nationally representative National Health\namination, survey participants provided biological specimens for lab-\noratory testing. The main outcome was weighted prevalence of at least\n1 of 5 STIs: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomo-\nnas vaginalis, herpes simplex virus type 2, and human papillomavirus\n(HPV) (any of 23 high-risk types or type 6 or 11).\nRESULTS: Prevalence of any of the 5 STIs was 24.1% among all and\n37.7% among sexually experienced female adolescents. HPV (23 high-\nrisk types or type 6 or 11) was the most common STI among all female\nadolescents (prevalence: 18.3%), followed by C trachomatis infection\n(prevalence: 3.9%). Prevalence of any of the STIs was 25.6% among\nthose whose age was the same or 1 year greater than their age at\nsexual initiation and 19.7% among those who reported only 1 lifetime\nsex partner.\nCONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of STIs among female adolescents is\nsubstantial, and STIs begin to be acquired soon after sexual initia-\ntion and with few sex partners. These findings support early and\ncomprehensive sex education, routine HPV vaccination at the age of\n11 to 12 years, and C trachomatis screening of sexually active fe-\nAUTHORS: Sara E.

Although the course of many of\nthese STIs is benign, even without\ntreatment, some infections may lead to\nlong-term sequelae, including pelvic\ninflammatory disease, infertility, and\ncervical cancer. A number of STIs also\nincrease the risk for acquiring HIV in-\nfection. Community-based studies and\nnational surveillance data suggest\nthat at least some subpopulations of\nadolescents have high STI rates2\u00ad4;\nhowever, these data are not nationally\nrepresentative.\nRecent analyses of US population-\nbased data have shown varying\nprevalences of several individual\nSTIs among female adolescents,5\u00ad8 but\nthere has been no in-depth analysis of\ndata in this age group. Estimates of\noverall STI prevalence and its associa-\ntion with sexual behavior among fe-\nmale adolescents would help to quan-\ntify the magnitude of STI risk in this\nvulnerable population and inform pre-\nvention efforts. We undertook this\nstudy to estimate the prevalence of the\nmost common STIs among a represen-\nin the United States.\nMETHODS\nStudy Population and Survey\nDesign\nWe analyzed data collected from fe-\nticipating in the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\nby the National Center for Health Sta-\ntistics of the Centers for Disease Con-\ntrol and Prevention and uses a com-\nplex, stratified, multistage probability\nsampling design to sample the US non-\ninstitutionalized civilian population\ninterview rate.10 Race/ethnicity catego-\nries were defined as non-Hispanic white,\nnon-Hispanic black, and Mexican Ameri-\ncan using self-reported information.11\nParticipants who did not fit into 1 of\nthese categories were classified as\n\"other.\" Non-Hispanic black and Mexi-\ncan American participants and adoles-\nPoverty index ratio12 values of 1 were\nconsidered below and values of 1\nwere considered at or above the pov-\nerty level.\nSurvey participants were interviewed,\nunderwent a standardized physical ex-\namination, and submitted biological\nspecimens.

We\ndefined \"sexually experienced\" as a\n\"yes\" response to the question, \"Have\nyou ever had sex?\" The Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention institu-\ntional review board approved NHANES\nipants who were aged 18 provided\nwritten, informed consent. Parents\ngave written consent for minors (aged\n18), accompanied by the minors'\nassent.\nLaboratory Tests and Methods\nvided urine, sera, and self-collected\nvaginal swab specimens for analysis.\nUrine was tested for Chlamydia tra-\nchomatis (chlamydia) and Neisseria\ngonorrhoeae (gonorrhea) by using\nBDProbeTecET(BectonDickinson,Frank-\nlin Lakes, NJ).13 Sera were tested for\nherpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) an-\ntibodies with a solid-phase enzymatic\nimmunodot assay14 that was based on\nglycoprotein gG2. Vaginal swab speci-\nmens were tested for Trichomonas\nvaginalis (trichomonas) and human\npapillomavirus (HPV) by using sepa-\nrate polymerase chain reaction tests.\nA TaqMan-based polymerase chain re-\naction method was used to detect\ntrichomonas.15 HPV detection and typ-\ning were performed on swab DNA ex-\ntracts by using the Roche prototype\nline blot assay (Roche Molecular Sys-\ntems Inc, Pleasanton, CA) and addi-\ntional techniques as previously de-\nscribed.5 We defined high-risk HPV\ncould obtain their test results by tele-\nphone by using a password-protected\nsystem.

Those without health care provid-\ners were given names of area clinics\nthat provide STI services.\nStatistical Analyses\nWe estimated the weighted preva-\nlence of HPV, gonorrhea, chlamydia,\ntrichomonas, and HSV-2 infections in\nfemale adolescents who were aged 14\nto 19. Evaluation of HPV infection was\nrestricted to HPV types that are most\nlikely to cause clinically important dis-\nease: the 23 high-risk HPV types de-\nfined already, which are responsible\nfor cervical and other cancers,16 and\nlow-risk types 6 and 11, which are re-\nWe designated this HPV variable \"high-\nwhich was considered positive when\nany high-risk HPV type or type 6 or 11\nwas detected. To measure the overall\nprevalence of at least 1 of these 5 STIs,\nwe defined a composite STI variable,\n\"any STI,\" as a positive test for HR/6/11\nHPV or gonorrhea or chlamydia or\ntrichomonas or HSV-2 infection. We\nlimited analysis of this composite vari-\nable to participants with laboratory re-\nsults for all 5 STIs. We calculated\nweighted prevalence estimates among\nall female adolescents and among\nthose who were sexually experienced.\nWe evaluated \"any STI\" prevalence by\nselected demographic and sexual be-\nhavioral characteristics including age,\nrace/ethnicity, poverty level, number\nof lifetime sex partners, and duration\nof sexual activity. Duration of sexual\nactivity was defined as current age in\nyears minus year of age at sexual ini-\ntiation. We also evaluated HR/6/11\nHPV infection prevalence separately\nfrom prevalence of the remaining 4\nSTIs (gonorrhea or chlamydia or\ntrichomonas or HSV-2) according to\nthese characteristics.\nAll prevalence estimates were weighted\nweights to represent the total US civil-\nian, noninstitutionalized population\nand to account for oversampling and\nnonresponse to the interview and\nphysical examination.18 Using weights\nwith additional nonresponse adjust-\nment for missing laboratory results\nproduced prevalence estimates within\n95% confidence intervals (CIs) deter-\nmined by the original NHANES weights;\ntherefore, we made no additional\nPrevalence estimate CIs were calcu-\nlated by using logit transformation.\nVariance estimates were calculated by\nusing a Taylor series linearization that\nincorporated the survey's complex\nsample design.20 Relative SEs (RSEs)\nwere computed for each weighted\nprevalence estimate as (SE/estimate) \n100. A prevalence estimate with an RSE\nof 30% is considered unstable and\nshould be interpreted cautiously.\nBivariate statistical associations were\nsummarized with unadjusted odds ra-\ntios (ORs); corresponding P values\nwere based on a Wald F statistic. We\ncalculated adjusted ORs (aORs) for the\nmain outcome, \"any STI,\" and for the\nfection and gonorrhea, chlamydia,\ntrichomonas, or HSV-2 infection, by us-\ning multivariate logistic regression\nmodels that included age, race/ethnic-\nity, poverty level, number of lifetime\nsex partners, and duration of sexual\nactivity.

On\nthe basis of published estimates for\nSTI prevalence found in this analysis\nwas not unexpected; however, this ag-\ngregate estimate strengthens our un-\nderstanding of STI epidemiology in fe-\nmale adolescents and highlights the\nneed for enhanced prevention and\ntreatment efforts in this group.\nOur data suggest rapid STI acquisi-\ntion soon after sexual initiation and\namong teens with few lifetime sex\npartners. Prevalence of any of these\nSTIs was 26% among female adoles-\ncents whose age was the same or 1\nyear greater than their age at sexual\ninitiation and 20% among those who\nreported only 1 lifetime sex partner.\nHPV infection was the predominant\nSTI.

Our find-\nings are also consistent with a recent\nstudy of college-aged women that estab-\nlished high risk for HPV acquisition with\na first sex partner.22 Although HPV infec-\ntion was most prevalent, prevalence of\nthe other 4 STIs also increased soon af-\nter sexual initiation.

Our findings, like\nthat racial differences in STI preva-\nlence cannot be fully explained by in-\ndividual risk behaviors. Specifically,\nnon-Hispanic black participants with\nthe same duration of sexual experi-\nence or number of lifetime sex part-\nners as their white counterparts\nwere more likely to have at least 1 of\nthe 5 STIs. Social, environmental, and\npopulation-level determinants, such\nas poverty, barriers to health care ac-\ncess, and the characteristics of sexual\nnetworks, may contribute to greater STI\nrates among non-Hispanic black individ-\nualnetworkincreasestheriskforSTIex-\nposure with any given sexual encounter.\nResources for broad strategies to close\nthe racial gap need to be directed to\ncommunities at risk. Although STIs\namong adolescents of all races and eth-\nnicities are a concern, increased efforts\nare needed to ensure that all subpopula-\ntions have the same opportunities for\nsexual health.\nReducing STIs among female adoles-\ncents and thereby protecting their re-\nproductive health requires a compre-\nhensive approach. Adolescents should\nbe provided thorough skill-based edu-\ncation about prevention strategies to\nlower STI risk, such as delaying sexual\ninitiation, minimizing numbers of sex\npartners, avoiding concurrent sexual\npartnerships,40 and using condoms\nconsistently and correctly.41 In addi-\ntion, adolescents should be informed\nabout the ability of those who are aged\n14 to obtain medical care for STIs\nwithout parental consent in all 50\nstates.42 The recent increase in teen-\nage birth rates43 also highlights the im-\nportance of providing education about\navailable contraceptive methods. Ide-\nally, adolescents' parents, educators,\nand health care providers all would\nparticipate in providing such educa-\ntion. Quality parent\u00adadolescent com-\nmunication about sexuality, sexual\nrisk, and condom use can result in ad-\nolescents' reporting more recent and\nhensive sex education programs can\nincrease STI knowledge and prevent\nrisky sexual behaviors.46 Health care\nproviders' counseling about safer sex\ncan result in fewer STIs.47 In addition,\nhealth care providers can promote\nrecommended primary and secondary\nSTI prevention methods, including rou-\ntine HPV vaccination of girls at ages 11\nto 12 and screening all sexually active\nfemale adolescents for chlamydia.\nOur analysis had several limitations.\nWe may have underestimated overall\nSTI prevalence because the compos-\nite STI variable did not include syph-\nilis or HIV. Only female adolescents\nfor syphilis and HIV; no cases of ei-\nther infection were found (Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention,\nunpublished data). Furthermore, we\nrestricted our analysis of HPV to types\nthat are more likely to cause disease.\nConversely, we may have overestimated\nSTI prevalence because missing labora-\ntory results were more common among\nlower risk younger and sexually inexpe-\nrienced participants. However, even if all\nmissing tests from examined adoles-\ncentswerenegative,theoverallSTIprev-\nalence estimate would be 19.7%, within\nour estimate's confidence limits. Inaccu-\nracies in self-reported data could have\nled to misclassification of sexual behav-\nior categories. This may explain pre-\nvalent STIs among those who reported\nno sexual experience, although these\nestimates were unstable. False-positive\ntest results or STI acquisition from non-\npenetrativesexualactivity(especiallyfor\nHPV)48 could also account for these\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur findings suggest that the STI bur-\nden is substantial among female ado-\nlescents, and the most common STIs\nbegin to be acquired soon after sexual\ninitiation. These findings highlight the\nimportance of both primary and sec-\nondary STI prevention, including early,\nskill-based sex education; HPV vaccina-\ntion of preadolescent girls; and chla-\nmydia screening of all sexually active\nfemale adolescents. A comprehensive\napproach designed to decrease STIs\namong female adolescents would also\ninclude steps to lessen racial dispari-\nties and to ensure that all adolescents\nhave access to such sex education and\nsexual health care well before they ini-\ntiate sexual activity.\n"
