In many cases, this is not very plausible, which has been noted in\nthe literature. The marginal product of a firm falls with its production for example\nbecause of a downward-sloping demand curve or a concave production function. In\nthat case, there are two consequences for wage setting: on the one hand, a firm\nhas the incentive to expand production so as to reduce the wage per worker, which\ndepends on the marginal product. This is a partial equilibrium eect. However, in\ngeneral equilibrium, the higher demand for labor will improve the bargaining position\nof worker and thus lead to higher wages. This suggest that a theoretical bargaining\nsolution should take account of employers' strategic considerations.\nWe analyse the issue of intra-firm bargaining in a calibrated general equilibrium\nbusiness cycle model. Indeed we find that there are strong eects on the steady state\nof the model, with lower unemployment and higher wages than in the model with-\nout strategic wage setting. However, it turns out that the dynamic, business cycle,\neects are qualitatively and quantitatively weak. In response to a positive aggregate\nshock, unemployment falls slightly more, employment and vacancies increase some-\nwhat more, and wages fall a little less. In this respect, intra-firm bargaining matters,\nas the bargaining position of workers improves by less than is mandated by the rise in\nlabor market tightness. But overall, the transmission of aggregate shocks on output\nis virtually unaected.\nThe findings can be interpreted as implying that, in many circumstances, re-\nsearchers may safely ignore intra-firm bargaining even when analyzing business cycle\nmodels with large firms that face decreasing marginal product. If we - falsely - cal-\nibrate a model without this strategic feedback on wages to actual data where it is\npresent, the mistake we make is likely to be small.

The issue of intra-firm wage bargaining arises whenever the scale of the\nfirm changes non-linearly with its labor input. The two most prominent examples\nare concave production and downward-sloping demand. The first example has been\nWe show how intra-firm bargaining implies a feedback eect in the bargaining\nprocess from a firm's marginal product to wage setting. Firms have an incentive to\nincrease production in order to decrease the marginal product, and thus the wages\nof existing employees, in order to capture higher rents. In eect, firms reduce the\nbargaining position of the marginal worker by over-hiring. This partial equilibrium\nscenario, however, implies a general equilibrium feedback eect in that it leads to an\nexpansion in production, and thus higher surplus to be shared among more workers.\nWith a tighter labor market, the additional hiring of firms improves the outside\noptions of workers, and thus raises their wage in general equilibrium.\nThe main contribution of this paper lies in the analysis of business cycle dynamics.\nWhen compared to a specification that neglects intra-firm bargaining, the dynamic\nresponse of the economy to a productivity shock is barely aected. The response\nof unemployment is slightly magnified, depending on the degree of returns to scale\nand elasticity of demand. Similarly, employment and vacancies rise slightly more. In\nthis respect, intra-firm bargaining plays a role as the bargaining position of workers\nimproves by less than is mandated by the rise in labor market tightness. However,\n1Authors' a!liation: Michael Krause, Deutsche Bundesbank, Economic Research Center,\nThomas Lubik, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Economics Department, 701 East Byrd Street,\nThe views expressed in this paper are not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich-\nmond, the Federal Reserve System or the Deutsche Bundesbank.\nintra-firm bargaining does not aect the qualitative response of the economy and an\noverall eect on output is virtually non-existent.\nWe interpret our findings to the eect that, in many circumstances, researchers\nmay safely ignore intra-firm bargaining even when analyzing business cycle models\nwith large firms that face decreasing returns or downward-sloping demand. This is\nnot meant to imply that there may not be important and interesting eects on the\nsteady state of a model. This has been explored, for example, by Ebell and Haefke\n(2004). However, if we -- falsely -- calibrate a model without this strategic feedback\non wages to actual data where it is present, the mistake we make is likely to be small.\nIntra-firm bargaining is not the driving force of significant cyclical dynamics.\nThe gist of this argument can be illustrated by means of the following static exam-\nple that abstracts from search and matching frictions. Consider a simple bargaining\nproblem of a large firm that deals with each worker individually. Employed work-\ners bargain over the wage z, with their outside option being unemployment which\ngenerates benefits e. The firm's bargaining position is given by the surplus that an\nadditional worker generates, net of its outside option which is the value of leaving the\njob unfilled. This outside option is zero.\nLet the firm's price be s and its output |. The firm pays wage z and employs q\nworkers. Its value is given by its revenue minus cost, which consists of the wage bill\nand the hiring cost:\nY = s|  zq=\nConsider first value maximization with respect to employment:2\nCY\nCq\n=\nCs\nC|\nC|\nCq\nq + s\n| {z }\npu\n\n\nCz\nCq\nq + z\n\u00b8\n| {z }\npf\n=\nThe first term on the right-hand side would not be present if the firm were a price\ntaker in the product market; the first term in square brackets would be absent if the\nfirm were a price taker in the labor market. The latter would equal zero when firms\ncan only hire one worker, or when the firm does not internalize the feedback from its\nemployment choice to the wage schedule. The value of a marginal worker is therefore\nthe dierence between marginal revenue and marginal cost, pu(q)pf(q), which we\nindicate as depending on the level of employment.\n2For simplicity of exposition we abstract from fixed costs of hiring and intertemporal considera-\ntions.\nThe Nash bargaining solution maximizes the weighted product of the involved\nparties' surpluses. Given a worker's bargaining weight , the solution is:\nz(q)  e =\n\n[pu(q)  pf(q)] .\nInserting the marginal cost term and taking account of the dependence of the wage\non employment, yields:\nz(q) = \n\npu(q) \nCz(q)\nCq\nq\n\u00b8\nThe wage is a weighted average of the firm's marginal revenue and the worker's outside\noption. The second term in brackets captures the eect from intra-firm bargaining.\nMarginal revenue is adjusted for the feedback of the employment choice on the wage,\nwhich in turn aects the optimal number of employees. Stole and Zwiebel (1996)\nhave shown that this prompts the firm to over-hire. This feedback eect crucially\nrelies on the assumption that the firm's marginal revenue function is not independent\nof employment. Otherwise, as in the basic one-worker one-firm set-up of Pissarides\n(2000), the wage would not depend on q as pu(q) = s, for all q=\nIn the rest of the paper we proceed as follows. The next section outlines the\nmodel under the assumption of decreasing returns to labor and matching frictions\nin the labor market. This allows us to disentangle the relevant eect without excess\ncomplexity. We then add general equilibrium constraints, calibrate the model, and\nproceed to analyze the steady state and business cycle implications graphically and\nnumerically. In section 4, we discuss the similarities of the results to the case of\nmonopolistic competition, and show the robustness of our findings to its inclusion\nalongside decreasing returns. The final section concludes and highlights some further\nconnections to the literature.\n2 A Business Cycle Model with Search Frictions\nand Intra-Firm Bargaining\nWe illustrate the eects of (neglecting) intra-firm bargaining (IFB) by means of a\nsimple model in which production is characterized by decreasing returns to labor and\nfirms are large in the sense that they employ multiple workers. This contrasts with\nthe standard search and matching framework in which production originates in one-\nworker one-firm pairs. We assume an economy with a continuum of firms that use\nlabor as the only input in production. The production function of a typical firm is\ngiven by:\n|w\n= Dw\nq\nw\nwhere 0 ?   1, and Dw\nis a stochastic productivity process common to all firms.\nqw is the measure of workers employed by the firm. We assume that all firms behave\nsymmetrically, and consequently suppress firm-specific indices. With the total labor\nforce normalized to one, aggregate employment is identical to firm-level employment.\nUnemployment is defined as:\nxw\nThe labor market is characterized by search and matching frictions encapsulated\nin the matching function p(xw\n> yw\n) = px\nw\nw\n. It describes the outcome of search\nbehavior of firms and workers in that unemployed job seekers xw\nare matched with\nvacancies yw\nat rate p(xw\n> yw\n) to produce new employment relationships. 0 ?  ?\n1 is the match elasticity of the unemployed, and p A 0 describes the e!ciency\nof the match process. Using the definition of labor market tightness w\n= yw\n@xw\n,\nthe aggregate probability of filling a vacancy (taken parametrically by the firms) is\nt(w\n) = p(yw\n> xw\n)@yw\n. The evolution of employment is then:\n= (1  )[qw\n+ yw\nt(w\n0 ?  ? 1 is the (constant) separation rate that measures inflows into unemployment.\nFirms maximize profits by choosing employment next period and vacancies to be\nposted, subject to the firm-level employment constraint. This job creation comes at\na flow cost f A 0. The Bellman equation is:\nV(qw\n) = max\n{Dw\nq\nw\n z(qw\n)qw\n fyw\n+ Hw\nw\nV(\u00b7) is the value of the firm, w\nis the time-varying discount factor, and z(qw\n) is the\nwage schedule, which will be determined below. The notation indicates that the wage\nof the marginal worker potentially depends on the existing number of workers in the\nfirm. The first-order conditions are:\nf = w\n)>\nw\n= Hw\nw\n)>\nwhere w\nis the Lagrange-multiplier on the employment constraint (3). The corre-\nsponding envelope condition is:\n) = Dw\nw\n z(qw\n) \nCz(qw\n)\nCqw\nqw\n+ Hw\nw\n)\nCqw\nThe presence of the derivative of the wage schedule reflects the impact of intra-\nfirm wage bargaining. When choosing employment, firms take into account how an\nadditional worker aects their bargaining position and thus wage setting.\nWe define the value of the marginal job M(qw\n), and rewrite the envelope\ncondition as an asset equation:\nM(qw\n) = Dw\nw\n z(qw\n) \nCz(qw\n)\nCqw\nqw\nw\nWith constant returns to scale,  = 1, the marginal product of labor is Dw\n(the `one-\nworker one-firm' case), and the wage is independent of the firm's current employment\nlevel. The asset equation then reduces to the one in Pissarides (2000).\nCombining this with the first-order conditions results in a vacancy-posting, or job\ncreation, condition:\nf\nt(w\n)\nw\nwhich can alternatively be written as:\nf\nt(w\n)\nw\n\n) \n)\n+\nf\n)\n\u00b8\nTo gain some intuition, suppose firms anticipate an increase in productivity Dw+1.\nThis raises the present value of profits and thereby the marginal benefit of hiring\nmore workers at given marginal cost f@t(w\n). Other things being equal, more vacancies\nare posted, and qw+1 is expected to be higher, which, in turn, reduces the expected\nmarginal product of labor until equality is restored.\nThis adjustment is aected by two additional channels. The first takes place\nwithin the firm, hence the label intra-firm bargaining. Adding a worker reduces\nthe eective bargaining power of existing workers, and thus their wage. Assuming\nHw\n? 0, which we will show below to be true, this amplifies the in-\ncentive to post vacancies and employment increases further. In order to determine\nthe quantitative significance of this eect, we need to solve for the equilibrium wage\nschedule z(qw\n)> which is done below. The other channel is a feedback eect which\narises in general equilibrium. As all firms post more vacancies, aggregate vacancies\nincrease, the labor market tightens, and it becomes more costly to recruit additional\nworkers with the rise in f@t(w\n). Therefore, employment in each firm increases by less\nthan it would if w\nwhere constant.\n2.1 Determining the Wage Schedule\nWages are determined based on the Nash bargaining solution: surpluses accruing to\nthe matched parties are split according to a rule that maximizes the weighted average\nof the respective surpluses. Denoting the workers' weight in the bargaining process\nas  5 [0> 1], this implies the sharing rule:\nZw\n Xw\n=\n\nMw\nwhere Zw\nis the asset value of employment, Xw\nis the value of being unemployed, and\nMw\nis, as before, the value of the marginal worker to the firm.3\nThe value of employment to a worker is described by the following Bellman equa-\ntion:\nZw\n= zw\n+ Hw\nw\nWorkers receive the wage zw\n, and transition into unemployment next period with\nprobability . The value of searching for a job, when currently unemployed, is:\nXw\n= e + Hw\nw\n[iw\nAn unemployed searcher receives benefits e and transitions into employment with\nprobability iw\n(1  ). The job finding rate iw\nis defined as i(w\n) = p(yw\n> xw\n)@xw\nwhich\nis decreasing in tightness w\n. It is adjusted for the probability that a completed match\ngets dissolved before production begins next period.\nWe substitute the asset equations into the sharing rule (9) and, after some algebra,\nfind the wage equation:\nz(qw\n) = \n\nDw\nw\n\nCz(qw\n)\nCqw\nqw\n+ fw\n\u00b8\n3In models with one-worker firms, the net surplus of a firm is given by Mw\n Yw\n> with Yw the value\nof a vacant job. By free entry, Yw is then assumed to be driven to zero.\nBecause of the presence of the derivative of the wage schedule on account of intra-firm\nbargaining this a first-order dierential equation, the solution of which is:\nz(qw\n) =\n\nDw\nw\n+ fw\nThe derivative with respect to employment is given by:\nCz(qw\n)\nCqw\n= \nDw\nw\nwhich, when inserted into (12), verifies the consistency with the solution.\nFor given employment, intra-firm bargaining increases the wage by virtue of the\nscale factor 1@ [1  (1  )] A 1. The addition of a worker to the workforce implies\na higher value to the firm as it lowers the marginal product of all incumbent workers.\nA new worker has therefore a higher value to the firm than just his marginal product\nbecause he contributes to lowering the firm's wage bill. By the logic of bargaining, the\nsurplus is split, and workers get their share in terms of a higher wage. However, for\nthe very reason that adding workers reduces the wage bill, firms post more vacancies\nto increase employment. This lowers the marginal impact of adding workers, which\nis declining in qw\n. Thus, workers' marginal product decreases with employment and\nhence the wage. Equation (13) gives the overall eect of the falling marginal product\non the wage, corrected for intra-firm bargaining.4\nThe wage schedule can be used in the job creation condition (8) to yield:\nf\nt(w\n)\nw\n\nf\n)\n\u00b8\nIntra-firm bargaining leads to the term 1@ [1  (1  )] which reflects the firm's\ninternalization of the eect of employment on the wage. It exerts a level eect in that\nthe marginal benefit from adding workers is perceived to be higher. This induces\nmore job creation. For the case of constant returns,  = 1, the equation collapses to\nthe usual form, and intra-firm bargaining is irrelevant. However, our argument has so\nfar relied on partial equilibrium reasoning from the perspective of the firm. We will\nanalyze below the general equilibrium feedbacks both on the steady state allocation\nand on the model's adjustment dynamics.\n4In a sense, this setup can be interpreted from the perspective of insider-outsider theory: firms\nare willing to expand employment and incur vacancy costs in order to reduce the bargaining power\nof insiders. The crucial assumption is that the incumbents' wages are not protected by long-term\ncontracts, but are constantly renegotiated. The term `bargaining power' is, of course, used loosely\nin the sense that the Nash bargaining parameter  is fixed.\n2.2 Wage Determination without Intra-Firm Bargaining\nWe assume from the outset that firms internalize the dependence of the wage schedule\non employment (see Eqs. (4) and (5)). This allows them to act strategically and\nextract rents from the workers. As an alternative assume that firms behave myopically\nby taking the wage of its incumbent workforce as given when choosing employment.\nThis amounts to Czw\n@Cqw\n= 0 in the firms' problem. In this case, the value function\nof the firm is:\nM(qw\n) = Dw\nw\n zw\nw\nFollowing the same steps as outlined above, we find the corresponding wage equation:\nzw\n= Dw\nw\n+ fw\nand the job creation condition:\nf\nt(w\n)\nw\n\n fw\nf\n)\n\u00b8\nWhen comparing the two job creation conditions, the only algebraic dierence is the\nterm multiplying the marginal product of labor, namely (1) ? (1)@[1(1)].\nIntra-firm bargaining scales the marginal product of labor and thereby introduces\nan additional incentive for vacancy posting. The wage equations and job creation\nconditions under both scenarios will be the reference points from which we evaluate\nthe general equilibrium eects of intra-firm bargaining.\n2.3 Closing the Model\nWe assume that all workers belong to a representative household that insures its\nmembers perfectly against income risk implied by the two states of employment and\nunemployment. By means of a complete internal asset market, incomes are pooled in\nsuch a way that all households have the same level of income.5 Assuming a CRRA-\nutility function for the household, we can thus construct an implied stochastic dis-\ncount factor:\nw\n= \nw\n5This assumption is standard in the literature following Merz (1995) and Andolfatto (1996). Note\nthat the unemployed enjoy a higher level of utility than the working since they do not suer the\ndisutility of employment.\nwhich firms use to evaluate future revenue streams. 0 ?  ? 1 is the household's\ndiscount factor, and  A 0 is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. fw\nis the\nhousehold's consumption, which draws from production as described by the social\nresource constraint:\nfw\n= |w\n fyw\nTotal hiring costs fyw\nare subtracted form gross production as resources are lost in\nthe search process.\n3 The General Equilibrium Eects of Intra-Firm\nBargaining\nThis simple search and matching model with concave production provides a labora-\ntory for analyzing the qualitative and quantitative eects of intra-firm bargaining.\nWe proceed in two steps. We first compute the model's steady state and compare\nallocations across the two wage-setting assumptions. This discussion parallels the\nresults in Cahuc and Wasmer (2001). In the second step, we study the dynamic\nbehavior of the model and the implications for business cycle statistics.\nIn order to fix a baseline for the model's quantitative analysis, we calibrate the\nparameters to typical values found in the literature.6 We set the discount factor\n = 0=98, and choose  = 1. The mean of the technology process Dw\nis normalized\nto unity. We assume that the input elasticity  = 2@3, roughly the labor share in\nU.S. income. The separation rate is fixed at a value of  = 0=1, which is a mid-point\nof the range of values used in the literature. The match elasticity  is calibrated at\n0=4 based on the empirical estimates in Blanchard and Diamond (1989), while the\nmatch e!ciency parameter p = 0=4 is chosen to generate an unemployment rate\nof roughly 8-10%. To be consistent with this, we fix unemployment benefits e and\nvacancy creation costs f at 0=1. Finally, the Nash bargaining parameter  = 0=5, in\nabsence of any supporting empirical evidence.7\n6A more detailed discussion of the calibration of a closely related model can be found in Krause\n7Note that this violates the e!ciency condition in Hosios (1990). We do not regard this as\nrestrictive for our purposes since, as Cahuc and Wasmer (2001) have shown, the e!ciency condition\nis modified under intra-firm wage bargaining, and second we are not explicitly concerned with welfare\nconsiderations.\n3.1 Steady State Eects\nThe model's first-order conditions can be reduced to a two-equation system in unem-\nployment x and vacancies y (see Pissarides, 2000). The first equation is the Beveridge\ncurve, and is derived from the employment accumulation equation (3) in steady state,\nafter substituting the expression for the firm-matching rate t() and unemployment\nq = 1  x. After rearranging, this results in a relationship between y and x:\ny =\n\nIt is straightforward to show that this relationship is downward-sloping and concave\nin y-x space.\nThe second steady-state relationship is derived from the job creation condition\n(15). Substitution and rearrangement results in the following expression:\nf\np\nx\n\u00b4\n=\ny\nx\nfor which no analytical solution in terms of y is available. Instead, we solve this equa-\ntion numerically for our baseline calibration. It can be shown analytically, though,\nthat the job creation curve is upward-sloping and mildly convex. Consequently, the\ntwo curves intersect once, so that the model delivers a unique steady state equilib-\nrium. The two curves determining the steady state are depicted in Figure 1. The\nfigure also contains the job creation curve that neglects the feedback from intra-firm\nbargaining (IFB), which is derived from (18).\nSteady state equilibrium is at the intersection of both curves which yields an un-\nemployment rate of 8=5%. Without IFB, the job creation schedule is flatter and tilts\ndownwards, resulting in steady state unemployment of 10%. This confirms the result\nby Stole and Zwiebel (1996), subsequently refined by Cahuc and Wasmer (2001) and\nEbell and Haefke (2004), that intra-firm bargaining leads to over-hiring. Firms have\nan incentive to add more employees since the wage paid to all workers is falling in em-\nployment. This eect is mitigated by the feedback that hiring has on unemployment,\nas it raises labor market tightness and thus marginal hiring costs f@t(). Overall, the\nlevel of vacancies and employment are higher in the IFB-case since firms can generate\nhigher surplus by diluting the eective bargaining power of their workers.8\n8The underlying mechanism is not a labor supply eect in the traditional sense, which would\nThe same reasoning can be illustrated with an alternative description of the steady\nstate. We use the Beveridge curve to substitute out q in the wage equation (13), from\nwhich we derive a relationship between z and , labeled the `wage curve'. The job\ncreation condition can be rewritten in a similar way. Both schedules are depicted\nin Figure 2. We also plot the two schedules for the specification in which intra-firm\nbargaining is neglected. The figure shows that both wage and tightness are lower\ncompared to the baseline with IFB.9 Recall that, for given labor market tightness ,\nhigher employment allows a firm to reduce wages paid to workers, and to increase\noverall profits. However, when all firms act in this manner, labor market tightness\nrises both due to more vacancy postings and to a decline in unemployment. The\noverall eect on the wage is positive, so that intra-firm bargaining raises wages in\ngeneral equilibrium, which Figure 2 illustrates.\n3.2 Adjustment Dynamics and Business Cycle Statistics\nWe now turn to an analysis of the eects of intra-firm bargaining on the dynamic prop-\nerties of the model. In order to do so, we linearize both the baseline specification and\nthe model that neglects IFB around their respective steady states. Strictly speaking,\nthis analysis conflates two eects: the dierences in steady state, and the dierences\nin the coe!cients in the dynamic model. It is quite conceivable that models with\nidentical steady states can have dierent dynamic properties. Similarly, dierences in\nresponses (which are themselves measured in percentage deviations from the steady\nstate) have to be interpreted with care as they are relative to dierent steady states.\nThis implied error in our framework is likely to be small since the dierences in steady\nThe resulting linear rational expectations models are solved using standard tech-\nrequire increases in the wage in order to attract additional workers. More searchers find employment\nsince the increase in vacancy postings reduces labor market tightness, and thus increases the job-\nfinding rate, which is enough to compensate the marginal unemployed worker for the lower wage\nrate.\n9Since both schedules are aected under the dierent specifications, it may be conceivable that,\nsay, the wage increased or decreased. Analytically, the schedules with and without IFB dier by\na factor of 1@ [1  (1  )] that multiplies the marginal product of labor Dq1. The schedules\nthus shift both in the same direction. Only for very small values of  such a reversal can occur.\n10The conceptual background we have in mind is that a researcher might ask how much of an error\nhe commits when neglecting intra-firm bargaining. The reason for this neglect might be di!culty in\nsolving dierential equations of the type (12), and the possibly burdensome underlying first-order\nconditions. Alternatively, a researcher may be interested in exploring the implications of myopic\nbehavior by firms that ignores the strategic incentives to expand employment.\nniques. We first compare dynamic adjustment paths towards the steady state after\na productivity disturbance. Secondly, we contrast their predictions for business cycle\nstatistics based on simulated data. In order to describe the stochastic properties of\nthe model we have to calibrate the technology process. We assume that productivity\nDw\nfollows an AR(1) process with autoregressive coe!cient D\na zero mean innovation %w\nwith variance 2\n%\nthe observed U.S. GDP standard deviation of 1=62%.\nThe impulse response function for both specifications are depicted in Figure 3.\nTwo observations stand out immediately. First, the model exhibits an almost com-\nplete lack of internal propagation. The behavior of GDP follows virtually in its\nentirety the adjustment path of the productivity process. This observation has been\nargument that the standard search and matching model is unable to replicate the\nvolatility of unemployment and vacancies. Second, and more importantly for our dis-\ncussion, the responses are remarkably similar in terms of shape, size, and direction. A\npersistent 1% increase in productivity raises current production and future marginal\nproducts of labor. This raises the value of jobs, and thus vacancies posted, per the job\ncreation condition (15). This leads to increased employment in the following period\n(see equation (3)). Workers experience a rise in wages on account of higher productiv-\nity and labor market tightness. However, wages rise by less than productivity because\nof the strategic hiring decisions by firms. Thus, intra-firm bargaining does not change\nthe basic dynamics of search and matching, but it (slightly) modifies its strength.\nWe also compare business cycles statistics computed from simulations of the two\nmodel specifications. The results are reported in Table 1. The baseline model is cali-\nbrated so as to replicate the standard deviation of U.S. GDP; the standard deviations\nof all other variables are then measured relative to this value. The overall impression\nis that the cyclical properties of the model with and without intra-firm bargaining\nare virtually identical. There is no dierence in the behavior of output - which has\nalready been apparent from the impulse response functions, and the real wage. How-\never, when intra-firm bargaining is neglected, unemployment, vacancies and tightness\nare roughly 10% less volatile than in the baseline case. When compared to the corre-\nsponding business cycle facts for the U.S. economy, both models fall woefully short:\nthe latter statistics are o by a factor of 10, the wage is 50% more volatile than in\nthe data.\nIn terms of contemporaneous correlations, both specifications produce identical\nresults. The models are reasonably successful in matching unemployment correlations.\nA benchmark statistic is the correlation between unemployment and vacancies. The\nmodel-implied value of 0=58 is not too far away from the value in U.S. data of 0=95.\nHowever, the models produce perfect correlation between the wage, , and output,\nwhich is inconsistent with the data. Overall, these result support the impression\nthat a model with intra-firm bargaining is essentially observationally equivalent to\none without. An empirical, likelihood-based test of both specifications would find\nit very di!cult to distinguish between the two alternatives as they exhibit identical\ncomovement and only minor dierences between variable-specific volatilities. While\nintra-firm bargaining is a conceptually compelling idea, and quite conceivably relevant\nat the firm level, we conclude that it does not have a significant eect on aggregate\ndynamics.\n4 Monopolistic Competition and Intra-Firm Bar-\ngaining\nAn alternative source of a declining marginal revenue product is downward-sloping\ndemand in an environment with monopolistically competitive firms. Even with linear\nproduction, firms would be compelled, and are able to expand hiring since they can\ncapture rents by moving down the demand curve. This assumption has been used,\nfor instance, in New Keynesian models of output and inflation dynamics with search\nand matching in the labor market. Key examples are Trigari (2004) and Krause and\nWe assume that output of a representative monopolistically competitive firm is\nlinear in labor: |w\n= Dw\nqw\n, and that each firm faces a downward-sloping demand\nfunction for the product variety it produces: |w\n= (sw\n@sw\n, where \\w\nis aggregate\ndemand, and sw\n, the aggregate price level, both taken as given by the firm;  A 1 is\nthe substitution elasticity between competing varieties, and sw\nis the individual firm's\nprice. The firm's real revenue is then given by:\n\nsw\nsw\n\u00b6\n|w\n= D\n\nw\n\\\n\nw\nq\n\nw\nThe asset equation for the value of a marginal job can be derived following the same\nsteps as before:\nM(qw\n) =\n\nD\n\nw\n\\\n\nw\nq\n\nw\n z(qw\n) \nCz(qw\n)\nCqw\nqw\nw\nNote that despite linear production, marginal revenue is responds elastically to changes\nin employment, which opens the possibility of intra-firm bargaining.\nThe asset equation for workers remain unchanged, and so does the sharing rule.\nWe can consequently derive a wage equation as before:\nz(qw\n) = \n\n\nD\n\nw\n\\\n\nw\n\nw\n\nCz(qw\n)\nCqw\nqw\n+ fw\n\u00b8\nThe solution to this dierential equation is:\nz(qw\n) =\n\n\n\n)\nD\n\nw\n\\\n\nw\n\nw\n+ fw\nIt is straightforward to verify that this expression corresponds to the wage equation\n(13), derived under concave production, if  = 31\n\n. However, this neglects the general\nequilibrium feedback eect from aggregate demand condition, captured by \\w\n, which\nboth parties in the bargaining process take as given. Substituting \\w\n= |w\n= Dw\nqw\n, i.e.\nassuming a symmetric equilibrium, results in:\nzw\n=\n\n\nDw\n+ fw\nThe aggregate wage equation is now independent of employment (on account of con-\nstant returns in production), but the feedback eect from intra-firm bargaining mod-\nifies the productivity coe!cient. If IFB is neglected, this coe!cient is 31\n\n\n\n.\nThis wage equation can be used to derive the job creation condition, which closely\nf\nt(w\n)\nw\n\n\nf\n)\n\u00b8\nSince the employment equation (3) is unaected in the monopolistic competition\nframework, we can describe the steady state solution by reference to Figures 1 and 2.\nIn the former graph, the shape of the curves is unaected, there is a unique equilib-\nrium, and intra-firm bargaining results in over-hiring, as the job creation curve tilts\ndownward when IFB is neglected. Similarly, the steady state relationships depicted\nin Figure 2 remain the same qualitatively. In the literature, the substitution elas-\nticity  is often calibrated with a value of 11, which implies a steady state mark-up\nof 10%. Given our baseline specification with  = 0=5, the IFB feedback coe!cient\nis 1@(1  @)  1=05, which is negligible with respect to steady state values and\ndynamics.\n5 A Final Generalization\nConcave production and downward-sloping demand do not produce substantial eects\nof intra-firm bargaining on their own for plausible calibrations. We therefore combine\nboth elements from before in the simple search and matching framework. Following\nthe steps outlined before, the wage equation that takes into account the feedback\nfrom IFB, is:\nzw\n=\n\n\u00a1\n\n\u00a2Dw\nw\n+ fw\nThe job creation condition is:\nf\nt(w\n)\nw\n\"\n\n\u00a1\n\nf\n)\n#\n=\nThe specification without IFB results in the same equations, the dierence being the\ndenominator of the term pre-multiplying the marginal product of labor. The scale\nfactor which measures the feedback from IFB is now 1@\n\u00a3\n\u00a1\n\n\u00a2\u00a4\n. This\nfactor is increasing in , decreasing in , and decreasing in %. In other words, intra-\nfirm bargaining aects steady state allocations and business cycle dynamics more in\neconomies in which workers enjoy higher bargaining power (large ), the labor share\nof income is small (low ), and markets are not very competitive (low %).11\nWe illustrate the role of IFB in the extended model by a few numerical examples,\nwhich are reported in Table 2. We compute various model statistics for variations\nof the parameters aecting the scale factor. In particular, we contrast our baseline\ncalibration with a high worker bargaining parameter ( = 0=9), a lower labor share\n11This reasoning underlies Ebell and Haefke's (2004) finding that product market deregulation can\nhave substantial employment and welfare eects. In fact, their implied values for the substitution\nelasticity is % = 3.\n( = 0=5), and inelastic demand (% = 2). We first note that for an extreme parame-\nterization, shown in the tight-most column, the scale factor goes up to 3, compared\nto a baseline of 1=25. That this implies stronger eects of IFB is confirmed by the\npercentage increase of steady state employment and wage over the case when IFB is\nneglected, as the percentage change is monotonically related to the scale factor. For\nbaseline bargaining power, the change in employment is, however, fairly small, but\nmore substantial for wages. With higher worker bargaining power, these numbers\nincrease dramatically. What the percentages hide, however, are the actual steady\nstate levels. The second row in the table shows that employment actually falls with\nincreases in the scale factor.\nAn increase in the scale factor also has a monotonic eect on the percentage change\nin the standard deviation of labor market tightness. For a given parameterization,\nthe inclusion of intra-firm bargaining improves the predictive power of the model as\nfar as the volatility of key labor market variables is concerned. However, this scale\nfactor eect again masks the fact that with high  and low % the standard deviation\nof  is implausibly low. We conclude that the combination of concave production and\ndownward-sloping demand can increase the strength of the feedback eect of intra-\nfirm bargaining. From a pure calibration perspective, there is, however, a trade-o\nbetween `maximizing' the IFB eect and the plausibility of key model predictions.\nFor empirically relevant parameter values, the IFB eect still remains negligible as\nfar as business cycle dynamics are concerned.\n6 Conclusions\nIntra-firm bargaining yields a strategic incentive for firms to expand employment in\norder to weaken their workers' bargaining position. This expands employment and\nraises wages in general equilibrium because lower unemployment and higher vacancies\nposted raise workers' outside options, osetting the partial equilibrium eect. While\nthis is a conceptually compelling story of hiring behavior at a microeconomic level,\nwe have shown in this paper that the aggregate eects of intra-firm bargaining are\nnegligible in standard search and matching framework with concave production and\ndownward-sloping product demand.\nThe results in this paper should not be taken to imply that we regard intra-firm\nbargaining as irrelevant per se. The specification that combines both sources of de-\nclining marginal revenue product shows that somewhat extreme, but still plausible\ncalibrations can imply large eects. This raises a few questions for further research.\nGiven aggregate data, do the restrictions implied by an IFB specification help with\nparameter specification? Specifically, the bargaining parameter  is di!cult to pin\ndown. Furthermore, it is often di!cult to fit the behavior of the marginal product\nof labor, which might be ameliorated by the inclusion of the scale factor. A related\nquestion is to what extent it is possible to distinguish between the two specifica-\ntion in aggregate data. A second line of research delves deeper into the production\nside. Cahuc, Marque, and Wasmer (2004) have shown that intra-firm bargaining\nhas dierent eects in models with capital and heterogenous labor. Depending on\nthe bargaining power of workers, it may actually lead to underemployment. Their\nanalysis, however, is restricted to the steady state only.\nReferences\n[1] Andolfatto, David (1996): \"Business Cycles and Labor Market Search\".
