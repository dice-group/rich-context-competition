Our hypothesis was that\ndouble bundle PCL reconstruction provides\nbetter restoration of normal knee motion\nthan the single bundle technique, with con-\nsequent improvements in clinical outcome\nmeasurements.\nMaterials and methods\nSearch strategy\nIn accordance with guidelines from the\nCochrane handbook,15 searches of\nPubMed\u00d5, Embase\u00d5, the Cochrane Library,\nCNKI, Wanfang and CBM disc databases\nwere performed for all peer-reviewed studies\npublished up to April 2014 that compared\ndouble bundle with single bundle PCL recon-\nstruction. There were no restrictions on pub-\nlication language. Search terms were:\n``reconstructive surgical procedure''; ``oper-\nation''; ``surgery''; ``posterior cruciate\nligament''; ``single bundle''; ``one bundle'';\n``one tunnel''; ``one band''; ``one socket'';\n``double bundle''; ``two bundles''; ``two tun-\nnels''; ``two bands''; ``two sockets''; ``bi\nband''; ``bi socket''; ``bi bundle''; ``bi tunnel''.\nStudy criteria\nStudies were considered eligible for inclusion\nif they met the following criteria: (i) com-\nparative studies (randomised controlled trials\n[RCTs] or non-RCTs); (ii) patients with PCL\ntear with or without other knee injuries; (iii)\ncomparison of arthroscopic single bundle\nand double bundle PCL reconstruction; (iv)\noutcomes at !12-month follow-up \u00ad knee 90\nposterior stability, knee 30 posterior stabil-\nity, range of knee motion (ROM) and clinical\nfunctional outcomes. The main endpoints for\nthe meta-analysis were knee posterior stabi-\nlity and subjective outcome (Lysholm knee\nfunction score16 or Tegner activity scale17)\nand the International Knee Documentation\nCommittee (IKDC) grade examination.18\nExclusion criteria were: open or repeat\nPCL reconstructive surgery; ligament or\nother injuries in the contralateral knee;\nstudies with ``time zero'' (e.g., intrasurgical)\noutcome measures; technique articles; com-\nparisons within single- or double bundle\ntechniques; review articles.\nStudy selection\nArticle titles and abstracts were independ-\nently screened by two reviewers (X.Y.S. and\nZ.Z.). Subsequently, the full text of the\nstudies that potentially met the inclusion\ncriteria were read and reviewed to determine\ntheir suitability for inclusion or exclusion in\nthe present analysis.\nData extraction\nData were extracted independently by two\nreviewers (J.X.Z. and Z.M.). Data included\ntitle, authors, year of publication, study\ndesign, sample size, population, age, sex,\ntype of graft, fixation method, accompany-\ning injuries, surgical procedures, duration of\nfollow-up and outcome parameters.\nAssessment of methodological\nquality\nMethodological quality of RCTs and non-\nRCTs was appraised using the Cochrane\ncollaboration tool for assessing the risk of\nbias15 and Methodological Index for Non-\nRandomized Studies (MINORS) form,\nStatistical analyses\nContinuous data were expressed as weighted\nmean difference (WMD) with 95% confi-\ndence interval (CI). Dichotomous data were\npresented as odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI.\nStatistical analyses for continuous and\ndichotomous data were performed by inde-\npendent sample Student-t test and Chi-\nsquare test, respectively, using Review\nManager software, version 5.2 (The Nordic\nCochrane Centre, The Cochrane\nCollaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark). P-\nvalues < 0.05 were considered statistically\nsignificant. Heterogeneity was assessed with\nthe I2 statistic, where I2 > 50% was con-\nsidered substantial heterogeneity. In the case\nof substantial heterogeneity, data were\npooled using a random-effects model. A\nfixed-effects model was used in the absence\nof heterogeneity.\nSensitivity analyses were performed to\nexplore the influence of preoperative condi-\ntions, tools for outcome assessment and\nother techniques that varied between\nstudies.\nResults\nA total of 157 titles and abstracts were\nstudies satisfied the eligibility criteria.\nsingle bundle; n \u00bc 206 double bundle).\nliterature selection.

Forest plot for Tegner activity scale score of the knee after single bundle (SB) or double bundle\nmeta-analysis. Double bundle reconstruc-\ntion was significantly superior to the single\nbundle technique, although heterogeneity\nwas high. Since there was a lack of uniform-\nity regarding injury type as well as assess-\nment tool used, we used sensitivity analyses\nto determine the influence of these factors on\nthe pooled results. Due to the limited data\navailable, it was not possible to determine\nwhich measurement tool was more accurate\nand reliable. Future studies are required to\ntest and verify the accuracy and sensitivity of\ndifferent examination tools, and allow the\nstandardization of the method used to assess\nknee stability.\nBiomechanical studies have indicated\nthat single bundle reconstruction did not\nprevent posterior laxity at a flexion angle\n<30, and the double bundle technique\nresulted in significantly less internal rota-\ntional laxity at flexion angles >90.30 The\npresent analysis included four studies that\nassessed posterior laxity at 30 flex-\nthese studies (I2 98%), but sensitivity ana-\nlyses were unable to identify the source of\nbias. Evaluation of knee rotational instabil-\nity was not performed in all studies in the\npresent analysis, and would be a useful\nprimary endpoint in future studies in order\nto elucidate the reasons for the biomechan-\nical superiority of the double bundle\ntechnique.\nFunctional clinical outcomes, determined\nvia the objective IKDC grade and subjective\nTegner activity scale, were significantly\nbetter after double bundle than single\nbundle reconstruction, but there was no\nsignificant between-group difference in\nLysholm score. This may be due to the\nlimited sample size of the present analysis.\nThe present meta-analysis has several\nlimitations. First, it included only three\nRCTs, and these were of low quality. In\naddition, knee posterior stability was\nassessed using three different tools, and\nrotational instability was not evaluated in\nall studies. Finally, complication rates\n(including repeat surgery, revision or graft\nrupture rate) were not reported. Further\nclinical studies are needed to analyse these\npoints.\nIn conclusion, the small amount of data\navailable indicates that double bundle\nreconstruction is superior to the single\nbundle technique after isolated PCL injury.\nThese findings should be interpreted with\ncaution, however, due to the low quality and\nlimited sample size of the studies concerned.\nFurther high quality clinical studies are\nrequired to assess the relative merit of\ndouble- and single bundle PCL\nreconstruction.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
