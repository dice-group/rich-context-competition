The purpose of\nthis study was to examine the association between physical\nactivity and C-reactive protein concentration in a national\nsample of the U.S. population.\nMethods. The analytic sample included 13,748 participants\n20 years of age in the National Health and Nutrition Exam-\nmain study variables.\nResults. After adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, education,\nwork status, smoking status, cotinine concentration, hyperten-\nsion, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, high-density lipopro-\ntein cholesterol concentration, and aspirin use, the odds ratios\nfor elevated C-reactive protein concentration (dichotomized\nat the 85th percentile of the sex-specific distribution) were\nlight, moderate, and vigorous physical activity, respectively,\nduring the previous month compared with participants who\ndid not engage in any leisure-time physical activity. In addi-\ntion, leisure-time physical activity was positively associated\nwith serum albumin concentration and inversely associated\nwith both log-transformed plasma fibrinogen concentration\nand log-transformed white blood cell count.\nConclusions. These results add to mounting evidence that\nphysical activity may reduce inflammation, which is a critical\nprocess in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.\nKey words: adults, C-reactive protein, exercise, health surveys, inflammation.\nPhysical activity helps protect against numerous\nchronic diseases.1 Twenty-five percent of adults in\nthe United States are sedentary, and more than\n60% are not regularly active.1 During the past decade,\nlittle change has occurred in the proportion of adults in\nthe United States who are meeting current physical\nactivity recommendations.2 One estimate of the direct\nhealth care delivery costs of physical inactivity is $24\nThe evidence showing the benefits of physical activ-\nity for cardiovascular disease is overwhelming.4 There\nare several plausible biological mechanisms to explain\nthis relation. Physical activity is inversely linked to\nhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration,\nblood pressure, body mass index, glucose intolerance,\nand fibrinolytic activity, all risk factors for cardiovascu-\nlar disease. Furthermore, physical activity promotes the\nhemodynamic functioning of the heart. In addition,\npeople who are physically active often have other be-\nhaviors associated with a decreased risk for cardiovascu-\nlar disease, such as lower rates of smoking and higher\nrates of fruit and vegetable consumption.\nInflammation is of critical importance in the patho-\ngenesis of cardiovascular disease.5 Thus, it is of consid-\nerable interest to know whether physical activity can\naffect the inflammatory process. Several studies have\nshown inverse associations between physical activity\nlevels and concentrations of acute phase reactants such\nas fibrinogen and C-reactive protein.6\u00ad14\nBecause previous studies of physical activity and C-\nreactive protein concentrations have been limited to\nspecial populations, I explored this relation in a repre-\nsentative sample of the U.S. population.

Although the focus of this study\nis on the association between leisure-time physical ac-\ntivity and C-reactive protein concentration, I also ana-\nlyzed the associations between leisure-time physical ac-\ntivity and fibrinogen (a positive acute phase reactant),\nwhite blood cell count, and albumin (a negative acute\nphase reactant).\nMethods\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey (NHANES III) was conducted between\nstitutionalized civilian U.S. population, selected by us-\ning a multistage, stratified sampling design, was inter-\nviewed and invited for a clinical examination. For most\nparticipants, blood was drawn at the examination clinic,\nbut for some who were unable to attend the examination\nbecause of health reasons, a blood sample was obtained\nduring the home interview. Persons age 60 years, Af-\nrican Americans, and Mexican Americans were over-\nsampled. Details about the survey and its methods have\nParticipants attended one of three examination ses-\nsions: morning, afternoon, or evening. Those attending\nthe morning sessions were asked to fast for 10\u00ad16 hours\nbefore the session; those attending the afternoon and\nevening sessions were asked to fast for at least 6 hours.\nC-reactive protein was measured at the University of\nWashington Department of Laboratory Medicine by us-\ning latex-enhanced nephelometry.16 The lower detec-\ntion limit was 3.0 mg/L. An elevated C-reactive protein\nconcentration was defined as one at or above the 85th\npercentile of the sex-specific distribution: 4.4 mg/dL\nfor men and 7.0 mg/dL for women.17 Albumin was\nmeasured on a Hitachi Model 737 multichannel analyzer\nafter binding with bromcresol purple (Boehringer Mann-\nheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Fibrinogen concen-\ntration was determined by comparing the clotting time\nfrom a sample with that of a standardized fibrinogen\npreparation obtained on a Coagamate XC Plus auto-\nmated coagulation analyzer (Organon Teknika,\nDurham, NC). White blood cell count was determined\non a Coulter Counter Model S-PLUS JR (Coulter Elec-\ntronics, Hialeah, FL). Details about these laboratory\nprocedures and quality control have been published.16\nRespondents were asked whether they participated\nand, if so, their frequency of participation in the follow-\ning activities during the previous month: walking, jog-\nging or running, bicycling or bicycling on an exercise\nbicycle, swimming, aerobics or aerobic dancing, other\ndancing, calisthenics or exercises, gardening or yard\nwork, and lifting weights. Participants could also report\nup to four additional physical activities. Four levels of\nphysical activity were defined: vigorously active, moder-\nately active, lightly active, and sedentary. \"Vigorously\nactive\" was defined as participating three or more times\nper week in an activity with a metabolic equivalent\n(MET) level of 6 for participants who were 60 years or\nolder and 7 for participants who were younger than 60\nyears. One MET is the energy expenditure of approxi-\nmately 3.5 ml oxygen per kg body weight per minute or\n1 kcal per kg body weight per hour. \"Moderately active\"\nwas defined as participating five or more times per week\nin activities of which no more than two could be con-\nsidered vigorous activities. \"Lightly active\" was defined\nas participation that was not vigorous or moderate. Sed-\nentary was defined as engaging in no leisure-time phys-\nical activity. In addition, a summary measure of physical\nactivity was created by summing the products of the\nfrequency of participation by the MET levels for each\nreported activity.\nThe analyses for this paper included the following vari-\nables: age, sex, ethnicity, education, working status, smok-\ning status, serum cotinine concentration, hypertension,\nbody mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, total cholesterol con-\ncentration, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concen-\ntration, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride\nconcentration, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B, li-\npoprotein(a), uric acid, aspirin use, alcohol consumption,\nand fruit and vegetable intake. Most of these variables were\nselected based on published findings suggesting relations\nParticipants who answered the question \"During the\npast 2 weeks, did you work at any time at a job or\nbusiness, not counting work around the house?\" in the\naffirmative were determined to have worked during that\ntime period. Serum cotinine concentration was deter-\nmined by using high-performance liquid chromatogra-\nphy atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization tandem\nmass spectrometry. Three levels of smoking status were\ncreated: participants who currently smoked (had smoked\n100 cigarettes and were currently smoking), those who\nhad quit smoking (had smoked 100 cigarettes and were\nnot currently smoking), and those who had never\nsmoked (had never smoked 100 cigarettes). Three blood\npressure readings were obtained in the mobile examina-\ntion center. The average of the second and third blood\npressure readings (both systolic and diastolic) was used\nin the analyses. Hypertension was defined as a systolic\nblood pressure 140 mmHg, a diastolic blood pressure\n90 mmHg, or the current use of antihypertensive\nmedication.\nConcentrations of total cholesterol, high-density li-\npoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides (after hydrolyza-\ntion to glycerol) were measured enzymatically on a Hi-\ntachi 704 Analyzer. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol\nwas measured after the precipitation of other lipopro-\nteins with a heparin-manganese chloride mixture. Low-\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol was calculated using the\nFriedewald equation for participants who reported fast-\ning at least 9 hours,23 were examined in the morning,\nand were randomly assigned to the morning fasting sam-\nple. Apolipoproteins A1 and B were measured only for\nThese apolipoproteins were measured by using nephe-\nlometry on a Beckman Nephelometer Automated Array\n(Beckman Instrument, Inc, Brea, CA). Lipoprotein(a)\nconcentration was measured only for participants from\nby using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Stra-\ntegic Diagnostics, Newark, DE). Uric acid was measured\non a Hitachi Model 737 multichannel analyzer after\noxidation by uricase to form allantoin and H2\n(Boeh-\nringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Details\nabout the laboratory procedures of all these tests are\nBody mass index was calculated from measured\nweight and height (weight in kilograms divided by\nheight in meters squared). The circumferences of the\nwaist (at the level of the right iliac crest) and hips (at\nthe maximum extension of the buttocks) were measured\nto the nearest 0.1 cm. Aspirin use was estimated from\nthe following question: \"In the past month, have you\ntaken any aspirin, Anacin, Bufferin, Ecotrin, Ascriptin,\nor Midol?\" Participants were then asked how often they\nused these products in the previous month. Consump-\ntion of beer, wine, or hard liquor during the past month,\ndetermined from a food-frequency questionnaire, was\nused to estimate alcohol consumption. Fruit and vege-\ntable intake was determined by summing the responses\nto 21 items on a food-frequency questionnaire.\nBecause C-reactive protein concentrations are ele-\nvated in numerous diseases, I examined whether coro-\nnary heart disease (self-reported myocardial infarction,\nor probable or possible myocardial infarction diagnosed\nby electrocardiogram), cancer other than skin cancer\n(self-reported), diabetes (self-reported or based on fast-\ning blood glucose concentration), arthritis (self-report-\ned), or asthma (self-reported) possibly confounded the\nassociation between leisure-time physical activity and\nC-reactive protein concentration. Electrocardiograms\nwere only offered to participants 40 years of age.\nAnalyses were limited to participants 20 years of\nage. Age-adjustment was based the 1980 U.S. popula-\ntion 20 years of age using the direct method. Tests for\nlinear trend were carried out for proportions and means\nacross levels of physical activity. In addition, I examined\nthe associations between the dichotomized C-reactive\nprotein concentrations and the independent variables by\nusing logistic regression analysis. P-values for linear\ntrend were calculated by using the medians of the fre-\nquency-MET variable for each level of the four-level\nleisure-time physical activity variable. Age, sex, race or\nethnicity, and education were included in all multiple-\nadjusted logistic regression models. In addition, variables\nthat were substantially related to both leisure-time phys-\nical activity and C-reactive protein concentration (Ta-\nbles 1 and 2) were initially included in the regression\nmodels. Subsequently, variables that were not substan-\ntially associated with leisure-time physical activity were\nremoved from the models, as long as their removal did\nnot seriously change the odds ratios (ORs). I explored\nthe associations between leisure-time physical activity\nand albumin concentration, fibrinogen concentration,\nand white blood cell count using both linear regression\nand logistic regression analyses. The same set of covari-\nates identified for the logistic regression model for lei-\nsure-time physical activity and C-reactive protein con-\ncentration was used in these models. After inspecting\nthe distributions of these variables, I performed addi-\ntional linear regression models with log-transformations\nof fibrinogen and white blood cell count to improve\ntheir distributional properties. In addition, the associa-\ntions between leisure-time physical activity and these\nvariables were examined by using logistic regression\nanalysis. To be consistent with the logistic regression\nmodel for C-reactive protein concentration, I dichoto-\nmized albumin concentration, fibrinogen concentration,\nand white blood cell count using the 85th percentile of\ntheir weighted distributions as the cutpoint. Because the\n85th percentiles of these variables were very similar for\nmen and women--unlike those for C-reactive protein\nconcentration--I did not use sex-specific cutpoints. To\naccount for the complex survey design, analyses were\nconducted with SUDAAN.24 I used the medical exam-\nination clinic sampling weights to produce weighted\nestimates.\nResults\ntended the medical examination, C-reactive protein was\ndetermined for 15,604. After participants with missing\ndata for the study variables were excluded, this analysis\nreactive protein concentrations ranged from 3.0 mg/L\nquarters of the men (78%) and two-thirds of the women\nPhysical activity levels were inversely related to age,\nthe proportion of participants who had worked during\nthe past 2 weeks, the percentage of current smokers,\nserum cotinine concentration, the percentage of partic-\nipants with hypertension, body mass index and waist-\nto-hip ratio, total cholesterol concentration, non\u00ad\nhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration,\ntriglyceride concentration, and apolipoprotein B con-\ncentration (Table 1). Furthermore, leisure-time physical\nactivity was directly related to the proportion of men,\nthe proportion of white participants, years of education,\nhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, al-\ncohol consumption, and fruit and vegetable intake. Sed-\nentary participants had the lowest prevalence of aspirin\nuse during the previous month.\nAfter age adjustment, 8% of vigorously active partic-\nipants, 13% of moderately active participants, 17% of\nlightly active participants, and 21% of sedentary partic-\nipants had an elevated C-reactive protein concentration\n(P for linear trend 0.001) (Table 1). In addition,\nleisure-time physical activity was positively associated\nwith serum albumin concentration (P for linear trend\n0.001), and inversely associated with white blood cell\ncount (P for linear trend 0.001) and plasma fibrinogen\nconcentration (P for linear trend 0.001).\nParticipants with an elevated C-reactive protein con-\ncentration differed from participants with a low C-reactive\nprotein concentration for all variables except total choles-\nterol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations (Table 2).\nAfter adjusting for age, the ORs for having an elevated\nC-reactive protein concentration were 0.78 (95% confi-\nactive participants, and vigorously active participants, re-\nspectively, compared with sedentary participants. To ex-\namine whether this association was independent of covari-\nates other than age, I used logistic regression analysis to\nadjust for potential confounders. Non\u00adhigh-density li-\npoprotein cholesterol concentration, alcohol consumption,\nand fruit and vegetable consumption were removed one at\na time from the logistic model, and odds ratios remained\nvirtually unchanged.

Leisure-time physical activity was also\ndirectly associated with serum albumin concentration\nand inversely with fibrinogen concentration and white\nblood cell count. Thus, the results from this study sup-\nport findings from other studies that physical activity\nfavorably affects concentrations of acute phase reac-\ntants.6\u00ad14 Because this was a cross-sectional study, cause\nand effect cannot be directly determined.\nPrevious cross-sectional studies with large sample\nsizes have generally found an inverse association be-\ntween physical activity and C-reactive protein con-\nwere part of the Monitoring Trends and Determinants\nin Cardiovascular Disease Augsburg Cohort Study,\nC-reactive protein concentration\nwas inversely associated with leisure-\ntime physical activity during winter\nand summer but was directly associ-\nmoderate and strenuous physical ac-\ntivity were inversely associated with\nC-reactive protein concentrations.13\nSimilar findings emerged from a\nticipants, age 65 years, in the Car-\ndiovascular Health Study.14 In a\nfound to be inversely associated with\nC-reactive protein concentration by\nunivariate but not multivariate\nInterestingly, heavy bouts of exer-\ncise result in short-lived inflamma-\nmation differs from inflammation that\naccompanies atherosclerosis or other\nchronic conditions. The effect of sin-\ngle bouts of exercise may have mixed\neffects on acute phase reactants, how-\never. For example, subjects who took a\n30-minute treadmill test had increased\nconcentrations of alpha1-antitrypsin\nand haptoglobin but not C-reactive\nprotein or alpha1-acid glycoprotein.32\nIt is not clear how physical activity\ncould influence the specific inflammatory activity asso-\nciated with cardiovascular disease or other diseases. C-\nreactive protein is produced by hepatocytes. The major\nstimulants of production are interleukin-6 (IL-6) and, to\na lesser degree, IL-1. Many stimuli can result in C-reac-\ntive protein production and elevations in its blood con-\ncentrations. One such stimulus is the increased IL-6\nproduction by adipocytes as body mass index increases.\nBy reducing adipose mass, physical activity could de-\ncrease IL-6 production and hence, C-reactive protein\nproduction. However, after adjusting for body mass in-\ndex and waist-to-hip ratio, C-reactive protein concen-\ntration was still strongly related to level of physical\nactivity in the present study, suggesting that physical\nactivity influences the inflammatory process through\nother mechanisms. Geffken and colleagues14 suggest that\nphysical activity can reduce inflammation by improving\ninsulin resistance because concentrations of several in-\nflammatory markers were raised in insulin-resistant sub-\njects. However, after adjustment of NHANES III par-\nticipants' fasting insulin concentration, which is often\nused as a measure of insulin resistance, the odds ratios\nTABLE 4.

Physical activity has been shown to improve\nendothelial function.33 Endothelial cells are known to\nresponse. Activated endothelial cells can increase pro-\nduction of interleukins.36 The possibility remains that\nthe adjustments for excess weight were incomplete and\nthat residual confounding could still be present.\nIn conclusion, the results of this study showed that\nphysical activity is inversely associated with C-reactive\nprotein concentrations, suggesting that physical activity\nmay mitigate inflammation. Research to delineate the\nexact mechanisms through which physical activity in-\nfluences the inflammatory process will help improve our\nunderstanding of some of the benefits of physical activ-\nity. Furthermore, additional research concerning the re-\nlation of the intensity, duration, and type of physical\nactivity with inflammation could yield additional in-\nsights into how physical activity might influence\ninflammation.\nReferences\n1.
