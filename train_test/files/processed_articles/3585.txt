Polyomavirus was detected by nested qualitative\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays of urine. The risk factors for BK virus and JC virus were\nanalysed. The kidney and liver functions of infected and uninfected patients were compared.\nResults: BK virus, JC virus, and simian virus 40 were detected in 21%, 42%, and 0% of HSCT\nrecipients respectively. HCMV infection was found to be an independent risk factor for JC virus\ninfection (odds ratio (OR): 8.528), while transplants with mismatched HLA are more susceptible to\nBK virus infection (OR: 12.000). Liver function of JC virus-infected subjects was worse than that of\nuninfected subjects.\nConclusion: We must be vigilant for opportunistic polyomavirus infections in HSCT recipients,\nespecially those with HCMV co-infection or a mismatched HLA transplant. When unexplained liver\nfunction deterioration is observed, JC virus infection should be considered.\n",

Because the\nrecipients are consequently immunocom-\npromised, they are more vulnerable to\nopportunistic infections by viruses such as\nhuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Epstein-\nBarr virus (EBV) and polyomaviruses.1\nThese viral infections are among the most\ncommon causes of morbidity and mortality\nafter HSCT.2 Polyomaviruses, members of\nthe Polyomaviridae family, include BK\nvirus, JC virus and simian virus 40 (SV40).\nFollowing initial infections in childhood\nwith no or mild symptoms,3 polyomaviruses\nmay be latent in the kidney epithelium,\ngenitourinary tract epithelium and lympho-\ncytes.4 When BK virus or JC virus reacti-\nvates in hosts that are immunosuppressed\n(such as HSCT or solid organ transplant\nrecipients) or immunocompromised (such as\nAIDS patients), it can lead to severe clinical\ndiseases. For example, BK virus reactivation\ncan lead to polyomavirus-associated\nnephropathy in kidney transplant\npatients,1,3,5 while JC virus is more likely\nto be associated with progressive multifocal\nleukoencephalopathy (PML).1,3 Some stu-\ndies revealed that polyomavirus, mainly BK\nvirus,3,6,7 might associate with haemor-\nrhagic cystitis (HC) after HSCT,3,6,7\nwhereas other studies showed no associ-\nation.8,9 However, it was unclear if JC virus\nalso induces HC in HSCT recipients.\nAdditionally, BK virus reactivation may\nresult in renal failure and allograft failure\nin kidney transplant patients,10 but it was\nunknown if reactivation of this virus or of\nJC virus might similarly affect the kidney\nfunction in HSCT.\nIn this study, we examined the occurrence\nof BK virus, JC virus and SV40 after HSCT\nin China, analysed the risk factors for these\nviral infections, investigated if viral infec-\ntions of JC virus or BK virus are associated\nwith HC in HSCT recipients, and explored\nthe effect of these viruses on kidney and liver\nfunctions.\nPatients and methods\nPatients, samples and follow-up\nAllogeneic HSCT recipients treated at the\nFirst Affiliated Hospital, College of\nMedicine, Zhejiang University, China, in\n2010 were enrolled in this study. Patients\nwho died or were lost to follow-up within\none year after transplantation were\nexcluded. Overall, 38 subjects with a\nmedian of age of 23 years were enrolled;\nthey were transplanted for a variety of\nhaematologic malignancies, as described in\nAllogeneic HSCT recipients were exam-\nined in our outpatient clinic at regular\nintervals after transplantation. Follow-up\nwas conducted biweekly in the first month,\nthen once per month until one year post-\ntransplant. As urine specimens are easier to\nacquire than blood samples, which are\ninvasive and painful to obtain, urine samples\nwere collected to test for JC virus and BK\nvirus DNA at 6 and 12 months post-\ntransplant and stored at \u00c070C. At each\nfollow-up visit, all clinical data were col-\nlected, including HC-related symptoms.\nThis study was approved by the ethics\ncommittee of the First Affiliated Hospital,\nCollege of Medicine, Zhejiang University.\nAll patients gave their informed consent to\nparticipate in the study.\nConditioning regimen, immunosuppressive\nand anti-graft-versus-host disease\nprogram\nHSCT recipients received myeloablative or\nnon-myeloablative conditioning before trans-\nplantation (Table 1). They also received\ncyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil and a\nshort-term methotrexate course from day \u00c07\nto day \u00c01, followed by a long-term course of\ncyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil with\nor without prednisone, tacrolimus or\nazathioprine as prophylaxis for graft-versus-\nhost disease (GVHD). Intravenous ganciclo-\nvir (5mg/kg per day) was given from day \u00c07\nto day 14 for HCMV prophylaxis, and sulfa-\nmethoxazole was administered for pneumo-\ncystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis\n(four tablets per day, twice daily) after trans-\nplantation. For cases in which GVHD\noccurred, the immunosuppressive program\nwas intensified. Prednisone was commonly\nthe first line therapy, and other medications,\nsuch as tacrolimus or high doses of azathiopr-\nine, etanercept, and intravenous immuno-\nglobulin, were used with varying durations\naccording to the patient's response.\nPolyomavirus detection\nPolyomavirus DNA was extracted from\nurine samples using AxyPrep Body Fluid\nViral DNA/RNA minikits (AiSiJin\nTechnology, Hangzhou, China) according\nto the manufacturer's instructions. BK\nvirus, JC virus and SV40 DNA were\ndetected by nested polymerase chain reac-\ntion (PCR). The primers amplified a con-\nserved region of the T-antigen nucleotide\nsequences for BK virus, JC virus and\nSV40.11 All of the primers were synthesized\nby Invitrogen Biotechnology Co. Ltd.\n(Shanghai, China).\nThe reaction system and amplification\nconditions were the same as those in our\nprevious report.12 For each amplification,\npositive PCR products (BK virus, 353 bp; JC\nsequenced by ZeHeng Technology Co.\nLtd., Shanghai, China) served as positive\ncontrols and distilled water served as a\nnegative control.\nThe PCR products stained with ethidium\nbromide were analysed by electrophoresis\nTable 1.

The extraction and\namplification conditions were the same as\nthose used for the clinical samples, and all\ndilutions were assayed in triplicate.\nRenal function and liver function detection\nThe glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the\noptimal indicator for renal function.13\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate\naminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin\n(TB), and direct bilirubin (DB) were the\nmost common indicators for measuring liver\nfunction in our enrolled patients. At each\nvisit in this study, serum creatinine (Cr),\nALT and AST were measured by the bio-\nchemical laboratory of the First Affiliated\nHospital and GFR was converted according\nto the modified equations suitable for\nChinese individuals.13\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS software (version 16.0, SSPS Inc.,\nChicago, IL, USA). Patients' ages are\nexpressed as the median, and other quanti-\ntative variables are expressed as the mean\nvalues \u00c6 standard deviation (SD) for\nnormally distributed data. These data\nwere compared using a t-test. Qualitative\nvariables are expressed as a percentage of\npositive results, and the differences\nbetween these variables were evaluated by\nusing the chi-square or the Fisher's exact\ntest. Virus risk factors were analysed by a\nbinary logistic regression. All p-values were\nbased on a two-tailed test of significance\nResults\nPolyomavirus infection\nTwo samples were collected for every\npatient; urine samples were collected in the\nsixth month and the twelfth month after\nHSCT and stored at \u00c070C. The patient was\nconsidered to be virus-infected if at least one\nsample was positive. Of the 38 total patients,\neight patients were infected with BK virus\n(21%) and 16 patients were infected with JC\nvirus (42%), including four patients who\ninfected with both viruses (11%). No\npatients were infected with SV40. JC virus\nwas detected in both urine samples for only\none of the 38 patients; this virus was\ndetected in the sixth month and twelfth\nmonth post-transplantation samples of\nseven and eight patients, respectively. BK\nvirus was not detected in both urine samples\nfor any of the patients; this virus was\ndetected in the sixth month and twelfth\nmonth post-transplantation samples of five\nand three patients, respectively. Both viruses\nwere detected from the same sample for all\nfour of the patients infected with BK virus\nand JC virus. The rate of JC virus coinfec-\ntion in BK virus-infected patients was sig-\nnificantly higher than the rate of JC virus\ninfection in those without BK virus infection\n(p \u00bc 0.001). Additionally, the rate of BK\nvirus coinfection in JC virus-infected\npatients was also significantly higher than\nthe rate of BK virus infection in those\nRisk factors for polyomavirus infection\nWe attempted to analyse the potential risk\ngender, sex difference between donor and\nrecipient, donor being related to recipient,\nABO blood type, mismatched ABO blood\ntype between donor and recipient, mis-\nmatched human leukocyte antigen (HLA)\nbetween donor and recipient, myeloablative\nconditioning, conditioning regimen\n(including anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)),\nGVHD, immunosuppressive program\n(including prednisone corticosteroids, tacro-\nlimus, and high dose of azathioprine) and\nHCMV infection. Our analyses found that\nHCMV infection is a risk factor for JC virus\nAdditionally, a mismatched HLA transplant\nis 12 times more susceptible to BK virus\ninfection than a matched HLA transplant\nHaemorrhagic cystitis\nOf the 38 total patients, seven patients\n(18%) had HC, including six patients\nwithin 3 months after transplantation, and\none patient in the fifth month post-\ntransplantation. The median time of occur-\nrence was 48 days. Four of the seven patients\nwere infected with at least one polyoma-\nvirus; one patient was infected with both BK\nvirus and JC virus, one patient was infected\nwith only BK virus and two patients were\ninfected with only JC virus. Our limited data\non polyomavirus infection (20 cases) and\nHC (7 cases) did not reveal any clear asso-\nciation between polyomavirus and HC.\nThe influence of renal and liver function\nThe Cr, GFR, TB and DB differences\nbetween BK virus-infected patients and\nuninfected patients were not statistically\nsignificant, nor were the differences in these\nmetrics between JC virus-infected and unin-\nfected patients (Table 3). In contrast,\nalthough the ALT and AST were not sig-\nnificantly different between BK virus-\ninfected patients and uninfected patients,\nthe ALT and AST in JC virus-infected\npatients were both significantly higher than\nthose in patients who were not infected with\nGiven that HCMV infection may affect\nrenal function and liver function, both the\nrenal and liver functions were compared\nbetween HCMV-infected patients and\nHCMV-uninfected patients; however, no\nsignificant differences were found.\nDiscussion\nThe infection rates of polyomavirus, BK\nvirus, and JC virus in this study were 63%,\n21% and 42%, respectively, which are simi-\nlar to published results.18,19 Our previous\nresearch demonstrated that immunosup-\npressed patients are more susceptible to JC\nvirus than to BK virus.12 Here, in the four\npatients co-infected with BK virus and JC\nvirus, prior infection with BK virus or JC\nvirus was shown to hasten additional infec-\ntion by other polyomaviruses (JC virus or\nBK virus), but the exact mechanism for this\nremains unknown. It is possible that the\nvirus-specific IgG raised against one poly-\nomavirus may not confer cross-protective\nimmunity against other polyomaviruses.\nAlternatively, polyomaviruses may affect\nimmune regulation, facilitating the replica-\ntion and further infection of other poly-\nomaviruses. Further research is needed to\nvalidate these hypotheses.\nMany previous publications have\nreported an association between HCMV\nassociation may be related to the immuno-\nsuppression required to prevent GVHD.\nAlthough most of those studies revealed a\nTable 2. Binary logistic analysis for BK virus and JC virus risk factors.\nFactors Coefficient(B) OR(95%CI) P-value\nOR, odds ratio; CI, confidence intervals; HLA, human leukocyte antigen; HCMV, human cytomegalovirus.\ncorrelation between BK virus and\nHCMV,22,23 we found here that there were\nalso some associations between HCMV and\nJC virus infections. We identified HCMV as\na risk factor for JC virus infection, in\nshowed that cytomegalovirus replication\nenhances JC virus replication and infection.\nThe possible mechanism of action may be\nas follows. The immunoregulatory ability\nof cytomegaloviruses might increase the risk\nof opportunistic JC virus infections by\nmodulating molecules involved in\nimmune recognition and inflammation.12,24\nAdditionally, expression of the cytomegalo-\nvirus immediate-early 2 gene activates\nearly promoters of JC virus (which induce\nexpression of T-antigen), and various late\nJC virus genes are then replicated and\nHere, we found that mismatched HLA\nbetween the donor and recipient is an inde-\npendent risk factor for BK virus infection;\nWe hypothesize that the effect of HLA\nmismatch is due to the donor immune\nresponse. During BK virus infection, CD8-\npositive cytotoxic T cells can only attack the\nvirus-bearing target cells that share the same\nclass I HLA antigens.26 Notably, when HLA\nis mismatched, the CD8-positive cytotoxic T\ncells might lose this ability. Thus, an\nimpaired immunosurveillance of BK virus\nby virus-specific T-cell responses and the\nmajor histocompatibility complex restric-\ntion of the T-cell response might allow the\nBK virus to escape virus-specific immunity\nin a situation with mismatched HLA.17\nHC is a frequent complication after allo-\ngeneic HSCT. Here, the HC rate was 18%,\nand various studies have reported HC rates\nfound that HC is associated mainly with BK\nvirus and also maybe JC virus.7 Seven\npatients in this study had HC, but, in\ncontrast to previous reports27, their HC\nwas not related to polyomavirus and none\nof the polyomavirus-infected patients devel-\noped polyomavirus-associated HC. One pre-\nBK viruria develops into clinically signifi-\ncant cystitis and that BK viremia and peak\nviruria, were independent risk factors for\nHC.6 If the polyomavirus replication was\nnot at these peak levels in our samples, it\nmay explain the lack of association between\nHC and polyomavirus infection that we\nobserved. Furthermore, there are many\nother potential risk factors for HC besides\npolyomavirus, such as the type of condi-\ntioning chemotherapy (ex: BU-based condi-\ntioning regimens),28 HLA mismatch,\nGVHD, adenovirus, and HCMV7,28.\nTable 3. Liver function and kidney function between polyomavirus-infected and -uninfected patients.\nBK virus-\ninfected\nUninfected\nJC virus-\ninfected\nUninfected\nALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; TB, total bilirubin; DB, direct bilirubin; Cr, creatinine; GFR,\nglomerular filtration rate.\nBK virus and/or JC virus are important\ncauses of polyomavirus nephropathy in\nrecipients of renal transplants,1,3 but their\nsignificance in HSCT was poorly described.\nPolyomavirus nephropathy begins as a\nlocalized viral presence in the tubular epi-\nthelial cells of the kidney and progresses to\ndiffuse and destructive T cell-mediated inter-\nstitial nephritis.16 This interstitial infiltration\ncan cause scarring of the kidney paren-\nchyma, loss of function, and kidney fail-\nure.16 However, during follow-up, no\nneurological complications were found\namong the JC virus-positive patients in this\nstudy.\nHere, we did not observe an increase in\nthe Cr level, regardless of whether or not BK\nvirus or JC virus infection occurred. Ramos'\ntheory of the three stages of polyomavirus\ninfection29 reveals that polyomavirus only\ncauses tissue destruction and classical poly-\nomavirus-associated nephropathy, which\noccur in 5\u00ad10% of transplant patients,\nduring the third stage. Therefore, it is not\nsurprising that we did not find renal dys-\nfunction in any of the polyomavirus-infected\npatients because their polyomavirus infec-\ntions would still be in the first or second\nstage, during which there is no clinical\nabnormality and renal function is still\nnormal.\nTo the best of our knowledge, almost no\nstudies have focused on the effect of poly-\nomavirus on the liver function of transplant\nrecipients. Only Demir-Onder K et al.30\nreported that BK virus is a factor that\nshould be considered when unexplained\nrenal or liver function deterioration is\nobserved in liver transplant recipients.\nTo our surprise, we found that JC virus\ninfection could cause liver function damage.\nThe exact pathophysiologic basis underlying\nthis situation remains unknown. It is pos-\nsible that JC virus reaches the liver via the\nblood flow through a mechanism that allows\nit to escape virus-specific immune surveil-\nlance, subsequently inducing liver cell\ndamage by direct virus attack as well as by\nindirect immune attack. Further research is\nneeded to validate this hypothesis.\nAs with all studies, our work has some\nlimitations. First, we only collected urine\nsamples for qualitative PCR detection; we\ndid not collect blood samples and conduct\nquantitative PCR detection. Furthermore,\nfor consistency, samples were collected at 6\nand 12 months post-transplantation regard-\nless of when symptoms occurred, so the\nresults do not necessary match up with the\ntiming of symptoms. These shortcomings\nwill have some impact on the accuracy of the\nresults of this study. Lastly, this study only\ninvestigated BK virus, JC virus and SV40.\nFurther studies are needed to investigate\nother related pathogens, such as KI poly-\nomavirus (KIPyV), wupolyomavirus\n(WUPyV) and MC polyomavirus (MCPyV).\nIn summary, the data presented in this\nstudy reveal the frequent occurrence of\npolyomavirus in HSCT recipients, with JC\nvirus being the most common pathogen.\nHCMV infection is a risk factor for JC virus\ninfection, and mismatched HLA may induce\nBK virus infection. Polyomavirus-related\nHC, polyomavirus-induced nephropathy\nand renal dysfunction were not found.\nNevertheless, JC virus-related liver function\ndamage was present. Therefore, we should\nbe alert to potential opportunistic polyoma-\nvirus infections in HSCT recipients, espe-\ncially those with the risk factors mentioned\nabove. Furthermore, when unexplained liver\nfunction deterioration is observed, polyo-\nmavirus JC virus infections should be con-\nsidered as a possible cause.\nAuthors' contributions\nJianhua Hu, Jun Fan and Lanjuan Li\ndesigned the study; Siying Li and Yaping\nHuang performed the experiments; Meifang\nYang, Xuan Zhang and Hong Zhao\nacquired the patients; Lichen Xu and\nHuihui Dong collected the data; Jianhua\nHu, Meifang Yang and Lichen Xu analysed\nthe data; and Jianhua Hu and Siying Li\nprepared the manuscript.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of\ninterest with respect to the research, authorship,\nand/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following\nfinancial support for the research, authorship,\nand/or publication of this article: This study was\nsupported by the Medical and Health Science and\nTechnology Project of Zhejiang province\nNatural Science Foundation of China\nand the National S&T Major Project\nReferences\n1.
