    "abstract": "Abstract\nHumans perceive and treat self-resembling others in ways that suggest that self-resemblance is a cue of kinship. However, we\nknow little about how individuals respond to treatment by self-resembling others. Here we approach this problem by connecting\nfacial self-resemblance to social rejection. Given that individuals should expect to cooperate with kin, we hypothesized that\n(1) social inclusion by perceived kin should elicit lesser feelings of rejection and (2) social exclusion by perceived kin should elicit\ngreater feelings of rejection relative to inclusion or exclusion, respectively, by nonkin. To test these hypotheses, we recruited\n90 participants to play two games of Cyberball, a virtual ball-tossing game, with separate pairs of ostensible partners. In one game,\nthe ostensible partners were programed to fully include the participants in group play and, in the other game, they were pro-\ngramed to exclude the participants after a few rounds; the order of inclusion and exclusion was counterbalanced across parti-\ncipants. Partner faces were digitally manipulated to be either self- or nonself-resembling, and these conditions were also\ncounterbalanced. Rejection feelings differed significantly as a function of self-resemblance between the inclusion and exclusion\nconditions, but only for participants who experienced inclusion first. Moreover, for these individuals, inclusion by self-resembling\npartners led to significantly lesser feelings of rejection than did inclusion by nonself-resembling partners. To explain this effect, we\nexplore potential mechanisms of kin recognition and social rejection. Although nuanced, our results suggest that perceptions of\nkinship can moderate psychological responses to the actions of others.\n",

This situation would have\nencouraged the evolution of a range of kin recognition\nmechanisms (Cornwallis, West, & Griffin, 2009; Krupp,\nDeBruine, & Barclay, 2008), including those using contextual\n(e.g., Lieberman, 2009; Lieberman, Tooby, & Cosmides,\net al., 2008), to allocate resources discriminatively.\nKinship and Self-Resemblance\nAmong these mechanisms, humans appear to recognize kin in\npart by phenotype matching, a process by which an individual\nevaluator compares the phenotypes of social partners to infor-\nmation about his or her own phenotype and to the distribution\nof phenotypes in the larger population (Krupp et al., 2011;\nKrupp & Taylor, 2013).

For\ninstance, information about one's own phenotype can be\nlearned through direct experience (i.e., self-inspection) or\nthrough experience with the phenotypes of caregivers and nest-\nmates who are typically parents and siblings. Partners whose\nphenotypes are relatively similar to the evaluator's own\nexpected phenotype are classified as kin (or ``positive'' rela-\ntives), and partners whose phenotypes are relatively dissimilar\nare classified as nonkin (or possibly even as ``negative'' rela-\nindividuals are expected to cooperate more with kin than with\nnonkin but to avoid them sexually, to decrease the risks of\nAlthough some studies of human phenotype matching use\nnaturally occurring individual variation in similarity (e.g.,\nApicella & Marlowe, 2004; Kaminski, Dridi, Graff, & Gentaz,\n2009), experimental manipulations are also possible. In this\nregard, the methods of choice are to either digitally ``morph''\nor ``transform'' images of strangers' faces with images of par-\nticipants' faces and ask participants to evaluate or interact with\nthese altered images. The results of research using these images\nstrongly suggest that judgments of facial similarity are made\nfor the purpose of estimating kinship and are little affected by\ndifferences in age or sex (DeBruine et al., 2009; Maloney &\nDal Martello, 2006). Furthermore, facial self-resemblance\nincreases cooperative behavior, trust, and sexual aversion,\ninteracts with other kinship cues, and is distinct from more\ngeneral preferences for familiarity (Dal Martello, DeBruine,\nLalumie\n`re, 2012). Thus, facial self-resemblance can be thought\nof as a cue of kinship that influences our attributions and treat-\nment of others. Little research, however, has examined how we\nrespond to treatment by self-resembling others. For example,\nhow do our reactions vary when we suffer rejection at the hands\nof ``perceived'' kin? To explore this issue, we expanded the\nresearch on facial self-resemblance by connecting it to work on\nsocial rejection.\nSocial Rejection\nHumans are a social species, possessing psychological and\nbehavioral adaptations designed for the purpose of forming and\nmaintaining groups (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). The establish-\nment of social connections ensures access to resources and\nsupport and thus is essential to maximizing inclusive fitness.\nConsequently, individuals have a visceral negative reaction\nwhen their sense of belonging to or acceptance in a group is\nthreatened. Indeed, social rejection can lead to hurt, sadness,\nloneliness, anger, anxiety, and decreased state self-esteem\nMuch of the recent research on social rejection has used\nCyberball, a virtual ball-tossing game developed to study ostra-\ncism (Williams, Cheung, & Choi, 2000; Williams & Jarvis,\n2006). Participants play with at least two other, ostensible\nplayers, tossing a ball back and forth among themselves. A\nwelcome page presents a cover story that describes the game\nas a means of practicing ``mental visualization skills,'' and\nmany aspects of the game are customizable, including the num-\nber of ball tosses, speed of each toss, number of other players,\nand pictures and text labels for each player. Typically, there are\ntwo conditions in the game: inclusion and exclusion. In the\ninclusion condition, the other, preprogramed players toss the\nball to the focal participant as often as they toss it to one\nanother (i.e., one third of the time if there are two other play-\ners). In the exclusion condition, however, the other ostensible\nplayers toss the ball twice to the participant and thereafter only\nto each other, ignoring the participant altogether. The most\ncommon dependent measure is a questionnaire assessing parti-\ncipants' mood and need satisfaction (i.e., ratings of belonging,\nself-esteem, control, and meaningful existence; Zadro,\nWilliams, & Richardson, 2004). Cyberball has been shown to\nreliably induce an aversive and distressing rejection experi-\nence--even when, for example, exclusion results in monetary\nreward (van Beest & Williams, 2006) or the participant is\ninformed that he or she is playing with a computer rather than\nOf particular relevance to the current problem, several stud-\nies have also examined how various characteristics of the ostra-\ncizing players moderate people's responses to being ostracized\nwithin the game. The results have been inconsistent for simi-\nlarity or in-group\u00adout-group status of the ostracizers, with\nsome studies finding stronger effects of group membership\non the psychological impact of rejection than others (Bernstein,\nSacco, Young, Hugenberg, & Cook, 2010; Gonsalkorale &\nWilliams, 2007; Sacco, Bernstein, Young, & Hugenberg,\nTo our knowledge, only one study has examined the effects\nof kinship on responses to ostracism. In a study by Sreekrishnan\nplaying with their mother and a stranger child of their own sex,\nwhereas mothers believed they were playing the game with their\nchild and a stranger mother. After 108 trials of inclusion, parti-\ncipants were excluded for 44 trials and then rated their mood and\nneed satisfaction. Children reported lower mood and need satis-\nfaction than did their mothers.\nUnfortunately, this study had several shortcomings. First,\nmothers and their children differed from strangers not just with\nrespect to kinship cues but also with respect to familiarity.\nMoreover, mothers and their children had preexisting relation-\nships. Consequently, we do not know whether the effects are\ndue to kinship or to relationship closeness, which also has been\nshown to yield more negative responses to ostracism (Arriaga,\nCapezza, Reed, Wesselmann, & Williams, 2014). Second, chil-\ndren are dependent on their mothers for access to resources,\ncare, and support, but mothers are not dependent on their chil-\ndren for these things (Sreekrishnan et al., 2014). Thus, we do\nnot know whether the divergent responses are due to differen-\ntial effects of kinship or to this power differential. Relatedly,\nmothers and their children differ in age, and perhaps deve-\nlopmental stage played a role in participants' responses\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\n(Sreekrishnan et al., 2014). Third, the study lacked key com-\nparison conditions, such as having some participants play only\nwith nonkin (i.e., two strangers) to more directly compare the\neffects of exclusion by kin versus nonkin. Furthermore,\nalthough inclusion and exclusion were manipulated, these con-\nditions were always presented in the same order (inclusion\nfollowed by exclusion), and participants completed the self-\nreport measure only at the end of the exclusion trials. As a\nresult, the effects of inclusion versus exclusion by kin--as\nendorsed on the self-report measure--could not be compared.\nThe Current Research\nGiven that familial networks have historically provided\nhumans with both direct and indirect fitness benefits, we rea-\nsoned that inclusion in mutually beneficial activities by kin\nmight elicit more positive feelings than inclusion by nonkin\nand, conversely, that exclusion by kin may be especially unex-\npected and distressing relative to exclusion by nonkin. Conse-\nquently, we sought to test the hypotheses that individuals have\n(1) lesser feelings of rejection when included in and (2) greater\nfeelings of rejection when excluded from group activities by\nkin, relative to inclusion and exclusion, respectively, by non-\nkin. Recent work by van der Molen et al. (in press) provides\nsupport for the notion that individuals have different neural\nresponses to social rejection that is expected versus unex-\npected. However, such neural activity does not always correlate\nwith subjective distress (Baddam et al., 2016), which is argu-\nably of greater practical interest. Expanding on the work of\nSreekrishnan et al. (2014), we had participants play two games\nof Cyberball wherein we experimentally manipulated percep-\ntions of kinship via facial self-resemblance of the other players,\nused a within-subjects design that counterbalanced the order of\ninclusion/exclusion and kinship conditions, and collected par-\nticipants' responses on a ``rejection feelings'' questionnaire\nafter each game. We predicted that participants would feel less\nrejected following inclusion and more rejected following\nexclusion from a Cyberball game when their partners were\nself-resembling than when they were not.\nMethod\nParticipants\nUndergraduate students (N \u00bc 104) enrolled in an introductory\npsychology course participated in this study. They received\neither an additional 2% toward their final exam grade or\nUS$10 per hour if they had already received maximum course\ncredit. The research protocols were approved by the Queen's\nUniversity General Research Ethics Board.\na yoking procedure to compare the responses of two different\nparticipants to inclusion or exclusion by the same set of faces,\nwhere these faces were self-resembling to one participant and\nnonself-resembling to the other in a given game. Hence, both\nparticipants in a yoked pair saw ostensible partners with the\nsame faces behave in the same ways; one participant in each\npair served as the ``experimental'' participant and the other as\nhis or her ``control,'' and these roles were switched between the\ntwo games (i.e., inclusion and exclusion conditions). Conse-\nquently, any effects of the manipulation could be attributed to\nself-resemblance and not to some more general effect. Due to\ndifficulties finding another participant of the same sex and self-\nreported racial background in time for the second session (see\nbelow), the data for 14 participants were omitted from the\nanalyses, thus yielding a sample size of 45 yoked pairs or\n64 European, 17 East Asian, and 9 other groups including\npeople who endorsed multiple racial backgrounds).\nMaterials\nSelf-resemblance manipulation. Custom-built digital transforma-\ntion software (Tiddeman, Burt, & Perrett, 2001) was used to\ncreate self-resembling transforms for all participants (Krupp\net al., 2012). A photograph of each participant, centered in the\nframe with a neutral expression, was cropped to a standard size\nstrangers (base faces) were obtained from a database of past\nresearch participants, and two base faces of the same sex and\nracial background were selected for each participant. The shape\nof each participant's face was delineated by placing 179 points\naround the face. After standardizing all photographs for inter-\npupillary distance, the software computed the difference in\nshape between each participant's face and an appropriate com-\nposite face (i.e., an average face of the same sex and racial\nbackground as the participant). Fifty percent of this difference\nwas then added to the shape of each selected base face. Con-\nsequently, two same-sex, same-race transforms were generated\nfor each participant. A 50% transformation is the strongest\ntransformation at which participants do not consciously detect\nself-resemblance and are sufficient to elicit the behavioral\neffects previously described (e.g., greater cooperation with\nself-resembling others; DeBruine, 2004). The hair, clothing,\njewelry, and background of the transformed photographs\nremained the same as those of the base faces (for photographic\nexamples of the facial self-resemblance manipulation, see\n250 pixels to fit into the Cyberball user interface.\nInclusion/exclusion manipulation. Participant pairs played one\ngame of Cyberball in which they were included and one game\nin which they were excluded, in counterbalanced order. In all\ncases, each participant played with two ostensible partners rep-\nresented by face images on the screen. In the inclusion condi-\ntion, participants received the ball exactly one third of the time.\nIn the exclusion condition, participants received the ball twice\nat the beginning of the game and then never again.\nRejection feelings questionnaire. After each Cyberball game, par-\nticipants completed a 30-item questionnaire designed to\nParsons et al. 3\nmeasure feelings of rejection (cf. Zadro et al., 2004). Items\nwithin each section were presented to participants in a rando-\nmized order. Mood was assessed using 4 items that were rated\non a 9-point bipolar scale: bad/good, happy/sad, tense/relaxed,\nand aroused/not aroused. Four psychological needs that are\nknown to be affected by social rejection (Williams, 1997,\n2001) were assessed by 4 items each: belonging (e.g., ``I felt\nlike an outsider during the Cyberball game''), control (e.g., ``I\nfelt somewhat frustrated during the Cyberball game''), self-\nesteem (e.g., ``During the Cyberball game, I felt good about\nmyself''), and meaningful existence (e.g., ``I felt nonexistent\nduring the Cyberball game''). We also included 10 other ques-\ntions: 3 items assessed other feelings about the game (e.g., ``I\nenjoyed playing the Cyberball game''), 3 items were related to\nfeeling rejected or accepted (e.g., ``To what extent do you feel\nyou were being ignored or excluded by the other players?''),\nand 3 items pertained to liking for or being liked by the other\nparticipants (e.g., ``How much do you like the other players?'').\nParticipants indicated to what extent each statement was true\nfor them on a 9-point scale from 1 (not at all) to 9 (very much\nso). One other item was included as a manipulation check for\nthe inclusion/exclusion manipulation (e.g., ``What percent of\nthe throws were thrown to you?'').\nAlthough many studies examine the effects of Cyberball on\nfive different dependent measures (mood and the four basic\nneeds) without first examining the structure of the measures,\nwe did not have specific predictions for how our kinship\nmanipulation would affect, for example, need for control ver-\nsus meaningfulness. Consequently, we were interested in deter-\nmining the most parsimonious combination of the responses to\nrejection. To this end, we conducted principal axis factor anal-\nyses for the 29 items scored on the 1\u00ad9 scale using the psych\npackage (Revelle, 2016) in R (R Development Core Team,\n2008) and following the recommendations of Fabrigar,\nWegener, MacCallum, and Strahan (1999). We also separately\nexamined the items for the first and second games. In both\ncases, the scree plot supported a one-factor solution, whereas\na parallel analysis suggested a three-factor solution, so we\nexamined those two models for each time point. The eigenva-\nhaving the largest eigenvalue and accounting for the most var-\niance as is necessitated by a principal axis factor analysis. The\nthree-factor solutions had a large number of cross loadings,\nwhich made it difficult to interpret. Thus, the more parsimo-\nnious single-factor solution was preferred and was deemed\n``feelings of rejection.'' This one factor accounted for 48% and\n59% of the variance in participants' responses for the first and\nsecond games, respectively.\nThe following 3 items were excluded because they did not\nload substantially on this factor (loadings were less than .29 for\nGame 1 and less than .37 for Game 2) and yielded item\u00adtotal\ncorrelations of less than .30 in subsequent item analyses for\neach game: the ``aroused/not aroused'' mood item, ``Life is\nmeaningless,'' and ``I am in control of my life.'' After reverse\nscoring the appropriate items, a mean score of the remaining\nitems was computed, such that higher scores represented\ngreater feelings of rejection. The Cronbach's a for this index\nof rejection feelings was .97 for each game, indicating excel-\nlent internal consistency.\nProcedure\nThe study consisted of two sessions, set approximately 1 week\napart. In the first session, participants were photographed and\ninformed that their image would be used in the second session,\nwhich would involve playing a game with other participants\nover a computer. They also provided demographic information,\nwhich we used to help yoke them to another participant of the\nsame sex and racial background for the second session. For the\nremainder of the time, they engaged in an unrelated experi-\nment. During the week between sessions, each participant's\nphotograph was delineated and used to create two self-\nresembling transforms for him or her.\nIn the second session, the experimenter informed partici-\npants that they were to play two online games with students\nfrom other universities. Following the procedure used by\nKrupp, DeBruine, and Barclay (2008), the experimenter told\nparticipants to begin by reading the on-screen instructions\nwhile she left the room to make a mock phone call to a labora-\ntory at another university, on the pretense of ensuring that the\nother players were ready to begin. After the experimenter fin-\nished the call, she told the participants to begin playing the\ngame when they were ready. Both participants in each yoked\npair were randomly assigned to the same order of rejection\nconditions (inclusion followed by exclusion or exclusion fol-\nlowed by inclusion). Each yoked pair was also randomly\nassigned to an order of photo presentation for the two Cyberball\ngames, such that one participant's self-resembling transforms\nwere used to represent the two other players in the first game\nand the other participant's self-resembling transforms were\nused to represent the two other players in the second game.\nIn this way, one participant would play the first game with his\nor her perceived kin while the other participant served as his or\nher yoked control. In the second game, the kinship condition\nfor each participant was switched: The participant who served\nas the yoked control in the first game now played with per-\nceived kin whereas the other participant now served as his or\nher yoked control.\nOnce participants completed the rejection feelings question-\nnaire that followed the first game, the experimenter reentered\nthe room to load the second game and to inform the participants\nthat they would be playing with two new partners. As outlined\nabove, each participant played the second game in the rejection\nand kinship conditions opposite to the conditions of the first\ngame (e.g., if a given participant was excluded by perceived kin\nin the first game, he or she was included by nonkin in the\nsecond game). After completing the rejection feelings ques-\ntionnaire for a second time, participants answered questions\nabout the experiment itself to probe for suspicion. Participants\ndid not appear to detect the self-resemblance manipulation:\nWhen asked what the experiment was about or if anything\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\nseemed unusual, no participants made any reference to the\nother players resembling themselves or otherwise appearing\nunusual. Finally, participants were debriefed, compensated,\nand thanked for their time.\nAnalysis of Self-Resemblance Bias\nThe procedure for computing a measure of self-resemblance\nbias was adapted from DeBruine (2005) and Krupp et al.\n(2008). For each game played, the mean rejection feelings\nscore for the participant in the control (i.e., nonself-resem-\nbling) condition was subtracted from that of the yoked parti-\ncipant in the experimental (i.e., self-resembling) condition. In\nthis way, a self-resemblance bias score was computed for\neach game played, allowing us to determine the effect of\nself-resemblance on rejection feelings in response to inclusion\nor exclusion.\nA difference score of zero would indicate that participants in\na yoked pair responded in the same way to the same faces,\nregardless of self-resemblance. In this case, the participants'\nresponses would more likely have resulted from something\ninherent about the faces being viewed (e.g., their attractive-\nness) or to being included or excluded in general. A nonzero\ndifference score would indicate that participants in a yoked pair\nresponded differently to the same faces, implicating self-\nresemblance as the cause of the difference. We predicted that\nparticipants would exhibit a negative self-resemblance bias\nwhen included, meaning that those in the experimental condi-\ntion would experience lesser feelings of rejection than those in\nthe control condition. Conversely, we predicted that partici-\npants would exhibit a positive self-resemblance bias when\nexcluded, meaning that those in the experimental condition\nwould experience greater feelings of rejection than those in the\ncontrol condition.\nResults\nA 2 (inclusion/exclusion) \u00c2 2 (order) mixed-design analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA) was conducted to evaluate the effect of\ninclusion/exclusion condition, as well as the order of these\nconditions, on feelings of rejection experienced by each parti-\ncipant. As this analysis used individual participants as the unit\nof analysis, the data for all participants (N \u00bc 104) were used,\nwith feelings of rejection as the dependent variable. The main\neffect of inclusion/exclusion condition was significant,\nZ2 \u00bc .04. These main effects, however, were qualified by a\nsignificant interaction between rejection condition and order,\nTo evaluate the nature of this interaction, four t-tests for use\nwith mixed designs (Toothaker, 1991) were conducted with a\ncorrected a of .013. The means and standard deviations used\nfor these pairwise comparisons are presented in Table 1. As\nexpected, compared to the inclusion condition, participants\nexperienced significantly greater feelings of rejection in the\nexclusion condition both when exclusion preceded inclusion,\nings of rejection did not significantly differ based on order,\never, participants experienced significantly greater feelings of\nrejection when included in the first game than when included in\nSelf-Resemblance Bias\nTo test for an effect of self-resemblance within each rejection\ncondition, two single-sample t-tests were conducted. The\ndependent variable for both tests was self-resemblance bias,\ncomputed as outlined above. These tests used yoked pairs as\nthe unit of analysis, so only the data for yoked participants\n(N \u00bc 45 yoked pairs) were used. As predicted, the mean self-\nresemblance bias score in the inclusion condition (M \u00bc \u00c00.24,\nSD \u00bc 1.20) was negative, indicating that participants who were\nincluded by self-resembling partners experienced lesser feel-\nings of rejection than did their yoked controls; however, this\np \u00bc .182. Also as predicted, the mean self-resemblance bias\npositive, indicating that participants who were excluded by\nself-resembling partners experienced greater feelings of rejec-\ntion than did their yoked controls who were excluded by\nnonself-resembling partners; once again, however, this score\nwas not significantly different from the test value of 0,\nTo determine whether the effect of self-resemblance dif-\nfered across rejection conditions or as a function of order, a 2\n(inclusion/exclusion) \u00c2 2 (order) mixed-design ANOVA was\nconducted. This test also used yoked pairs as the unit of anal-\nysis, with self-resemblance bias as the dependent variable. The\nmain effects of rejection condition and order were both non-\nsignificant, ps > .29, but the interaction between rejection con-\ndition and order was marginally significant, F(1, 43) \u00bc 3.87,\np \u00bc .056, partial Z2 \u00bc .08. The nature of this marginal inter-\naction was explored further with four t-tests and a corrected a\nof .013, as above. The mean self-resemblance bias scores for\neach condition are shown in Figure 1. When inclusion was\nfollowed by exclusion, the self-resemblance bias differed sig-\nnificantly between the inclusion condition for which the differ-\nence score was negative, and exclusion condition for which the\nwise comparisons were nonsignificant, ps > .013.\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics for Feelings of Rejection Within\nInclusion/Exclusion Condition and Order.\nRejection Condition Order M SD\nParsons et al. 5\nTo further clarify the effect and more directly test our\npredictions, we used one-sample t-tests to compare the self-\nresemblance bias means to 0. When excluded first, the self-\nresembling bias mean was not significantly different from 0\npredicted, participants felt less rejected when included by self-\nresembling than by nonself-resembling others, t(21) \u00bc 2.05,\np \u00bc .053; however, participants did not differ significantly in\ntheir responses to rejection when excluded by self-resembling\nDiscussion\nAs expected, given extensive previous research, participants\nexperienced significantly greater feelings of rejection when\nexcluded than when included in games of Cyberball. Further-\nmore, exclusion was approximately equally hurtful when it was\nexperienced prior to or following inclusion by a different set of\npartners. However, game order affected the experience of\ninclusion such that participants felt less rejected when they had\nbeen excluded in a previous game. This suggests that inclusion\nfeels particularly rewarding when it follows such a powerfully\ndistressing social event. Participants who were excluded prior\nto inclusion might, for instance, have felt that they had over-\ncome an obstacle to group membership, making such inclusion\nfeel especially satisfying.\nAs genetic relatedness tends to foster cooperation, we\nhypothesized that humans would have evolved positive senti-\nments to inclusion and negative sentiments to exclusion from\nkin networks. However, in the omnibus model, self-resemblance\ndid not cause significantly (1) lesser feelings of rejection when\nparticipants were included in group play or (2) greater feelings\nof rejection when participants were excluded from group play.\nNevertheless, closer inspection revealed an interesting effect of\nthe order in which the games were played: The predicted\npattern of self-resemblance effects did emerge when partici-\npants experienced inclusion first and exclusion second but\nonly for the inclusion condition. Therefore, we conclude that\nparticipants found inclusion by self-resembling partners to be\nmore rewarding than inclusion by nonself-resembling partners\nin the first game. As outlined previously, we believe this is\ndue to the adaptive benefits (e.g., resource sharing) of being\nincluded in kin networks.\nAlthough the mean was in the anticipated direction for\nexclusion by self-resembling partners to be more painful than\nexclusion by nonself-resembling partners in the second game,\nthe difference was not significantly different from 0. We dis-\ncuss reasons for this in more detail below. Moreover, we did\nnot find any significant differences for participants who expe-\nrienced exclusion first. In other research using Cyberball, the\neffect of exclusion on affect has generally been quite powerful,\nand for many years, researchers did not believe it was possible\nto find moderation of its effects because it was such a strong\nsituation (McDonald & Donnellan, 2012). Thus, we suspect\nthat our results for self-resemblance bias were weaker for the\nexclusion condition than we expected because exposure to this\ncondition obscured or interacted with other events or processes\nin the conditions that followed it.\nIndeed, there may be carryover effects of exclusion on sub-\nsequent interactions. For instance, participants may be emo-\ntionally overwhelmed--to the point of distraction--by the\nexperience of being excluded, making them less likely to detect\nself-resemblance in a later game. If not impairing attention in\ngeneral, exclusion may shift one's focus of attention to cues\nother than self-resemblance, such as the number of tosses\nreceived, in ensuing interactions. Another possibility is that\nprior exclusion by self-resembling partners yields a more pos-\nitive interpretation of inclusion by nonself-resembling partners\nthan is typical, perhaps because exclusion signals that the par-\nties are in fact unrelated. Alternatively, perhaps the critical\ndifference lies not in this order of inclusion/exclusion condi-\ntions, but in the opposite: Exclusion by self-resembling part-\nners in the second game may be even more unexpected and\ndistressing to individuals who have previously been included\nby nonself-resembling others and who thereafter would under-\nstandably expect--even if unconsciously--to be accepted by\nperceived kin.\nLimitations and Future Directions\nA potential limitation of our study is that the self-resemblance\nmanipulation was too subtle when presented within the Cyber-\nball interface. If true, this may explain the nonsignificant effect\nof self-resemblance on social rejection when exclusion was\nfollowed by inclusion: Participants may have been more easily\ndistracted by exclusion when the self-resemblance manipula-\ntion was relatively weak. Future Cyberball studies might try\nExclusion followed by Inclusion Inclusion followed by Exclusion\nSelf-Resemblance Bias\nOrder of Inclusion/Exclusion Conditions\nExclusion\nInclusion\nFigure 1. Self-resemblance bias for each inclusion/exclusion\ncondition within each order of conditions. A positive self-resemblance\nbias score indicates greater feelings of rejection when playing with\nself-resembling partners than with nonself-resembling partners, and a\nnegative self-resemblance bias score indicates lesser feelings of\nrejection when playing with self-resembling partners relative to the\nnonself-resembling partners. Error bars represent standard\ndeviations.\n6 Evolutionary Psychology\nusing larger facial images or stronger than 50% transformations\nto determine whether these changes make self-resemblance\nmore salient and therefore increase the magnitude of self-\nresemblance effects.\nIt may also be that the crossover effect we find here is an\nartifact of a within-subjects design. Consequently, it would be\ninteresting to compare the results of within-subjects and\nbetween-subjects designs. For instance, participants might play\na single game of Cyberball, wherein half of the participants are\nincluded and the other half excluded by their partners. More-\nover, if using a within-subjects design, it might be interesting to\nprovide a neutral task between Cyberball games to determine\nwhether any carryover effects of exclusion or inclusion persist.\nConclusions\nSome researchers have contended that social rejection, partic-\nularly in the form of ostracism, is so aversive a phenomenon\nthat moderation is difficult, if not impossible (e.g., McDonald\n& Donnellan, 2012). However, others have challenged that\nadds further support to the latter position, showing that even a\nsubtle manipulation--exposure to self-resembling partners--\ncan moderate the powerful psychological impact of social\nexclusion, if only under specific conditions. Specifically, our\nstudy has shown that self-resemblance can alter the subjective\nexperience of social inclusion and exclusion, at least when\nexclusion follows inclusion. Future research should establish\nan effect of self-resemblance on responses to inclusion and\nexclusion separately, before further investigation into potential\norder effects. In addition, we expect that more salient self-\nresemblance manipulations will yield clearer results and stron-\nger effects. In any case, we believe that our findings justify\nfurther forays into the emotional responses that individuals\nhave to the actions of their putative kin, and how these\nresponses might interact with other psychological processes.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nresearch was supported in part by a Canadian Foundation for Innova-\ntion Grant and a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council\nGrant awarded to Jill A.
