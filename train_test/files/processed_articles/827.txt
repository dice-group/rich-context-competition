The reforms were largely a\nresponse to cost containment but also aimed at\nmaking the purchasers and providers of health\nservices more responsive to the needs of consum-\ners. The response of different governments to\nrising health care expenditure has been a series of\nad hoc measures aimed at restraining further\ngrowth and, in some cases, at cost reduction.1\nIn a number of countries, reforms also aimed at\nincreasing productivity to reduce the perceived\nproblems of the public integrated models which\nmay be associated with waiting lists and lack of\nresponse to patients' needs.2\nManaged care in Europe has moved in a\nnumber of different directions. These have been\nanalysed and described elsewhere and will not be\ndiscussed in this paper. There is a consensus that\n13 of the 15 EU countries have established overall\nhealth budgets or separate budgets for the main\nexpenditure components and all countries have\nprevented market forces from determining the\nlevel of expenditure.\nAgainst this background it is important to\nanalyse the views of the public since one of the\nmain objectives of the reformers was to meet\ncitizens' needs.\nThis paper provides an initial analysis of a\nEurobarometer survey, conducted in the 15 Euro-\npean Union Member States in 1996, on citizens\nviews on health care systems and spending.\n*Correspondence to: Elias Mossialos, Senior Lecturer, Department of Social Policy and Administration, Director LSE Health,\nThe measurement of public opinion is relatively\nnew, it emerged in the 1930s and matured in the\n1950s.3 There is still no consensus about the role\nof public opinion and the usefulness of opinion\npoll surveys in the decision-making process. This\nis also the case with opinion poll surveys in the\nfield of health policy.4\nThere are certain limitations when relying on a\ngeneral single measure, but there are several\nreasons to try to draw some preliminary conclu-\nsions. First, the comparative study of public\nattitudes towards health care issues at European\nlevel has not been extensively measured and\nwhen it happened the surveys did not cover all the\ncountries of the European Union and sometimes\ndid not use the same survey methodologies.\nSecond, it is important to establish a starting\npoint, in order to establish a trend to take into\naccount the impact of different reforms and other\nchanges in the health systems on public opinion. If\na trend has been established, then data could be\nused to evaluate changes over a period of time\nwhich may be associated with the introduction of\nspecific measures or reforms. It is therefore\nimportant to establish this anchor point5 and run\nopinion poll surveys on a regular basis in order to\nminimize the effects of specific circumstances that\nmay influence responses.\nThe data used to examine citizens' views on\nhealth care come from a cross-national survey.\nThe survey was part of a Eurobarometer survey\nand the design of the questionnaire was done\ncollaboratively by several researchers, coordi-\nnated by LSE Health, including experts in com-\nparative health policy and opinion polls. The final\ndecision concerning the wording of the questions\nwas that of the Eurobarometer experts. National\nsample surveys were conducted in the 15 Member\nStates of the European Union from 27 February\nThe findings of the survey were based on face-to-\nface interviews in people's homes and in the\nappropriate national language. Total sample sizes\nThe Eurobarometer survey covers the popula-\ntion of the respective nationalities of the 15\nEuropean Union Member States, aged 15 years\nand over, resident in each of the Member States.\nThe basic sample design applied in all Member\nStates was a multistage, random (probability) one.\nIn each EU country, a number of sampling points\nwas drawn with probability proportional to pop-\nulation (for a total coverage of the country) and\nto population density.6\nThe Eurobarometer health survey asked Euro-\npean citizens in the 15 Member States a number\nof questions related to the running of health\nsystems in their countries, their views on the need\nfor reforming the systems and the level of health\nexpenditures.\nThe results illustrate a general evaluation of the\nNational Health System/Service and/or Health\nInsurance System without specific reference to\nissues such as equity, efficiency and satisfaction\nfrom different levels of care.\nThe results are presented in Table 1. Figure 1\nshows the relationship between the per capita\nexpenditure on health on the one hand,7 and\nsatisfaction with the running of health care on the\nother. The increase in satisfaction with increasing\nper capita expenditure is evident. It is clear that\nthere is a north\u00adsouth divide with Ireland and the\nUnited Kingdom falling in between. Satisfaction\nin Great Britain is only slightly lower (47.8%)\nthan that of the total for the United Kingdom\n(48.1%) whose average is influenced by the higher\nsatisfaction rate in Northern Ireland.\nGreece, Spain and Portugal show the lowest\nTable 1. Satisfaction from health systems in the 15 EU Member States in 1996 and per capita expenditure on health in US$ Purchasing Power Parities\ndissatisfied\non health in US$ PPPs\nThe original question read: In general, would you say you are very satisfied, fairly satisfied, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, fairly dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with\nthe way health care runs in (our country)?\nCountry key: B: Belgium A: Austria F: France\nD: Germany FIN: Finland I: Italy\nE: Spain UK: United Kingdom NL: The Netherlands\nIRL: Ireland DK: Denmark P: Portugal\nL: Luxembourg GR: Greece S: Sweden\nlevels of satisfaction and rank lowest in per capita\nhealth care expenditure. However, the percentage\nof those who are neither satisfied nor dissatisfied\nin Spain is the highest amongst the EU Member\nStates (34.0%). On the other hand, Ireland spends\nless than Spain and shows a higher level of\nsatisfaction and Italy spends more than Denmark\nand shows the lowest level of satisfaction amongst\nall the countries. Denmark shows the highest level\nof satisfaction (90%) although health spending is\nlower than that of other countries which show a\nlower level of satisfaction. The results for Great\nBritain show a higher level of satisfaction com-\npared with the 11th report of the British Social\ncompared with the King's Fund survey9 con-\nidentical question was asked.\nCitizens were also asked to express their views\nconcerning the need for reform of the health\nsystem. The question was similar to that used in\nidentical.10 Blendon et al.10 surveyed ten countries\nincluding six EU Member States (The Nether-\nlands, Italy, West Germany, France, Sweden and\nthe United Kingdom). The survey was conducted\nin six countries in 1990 and the survey in the\nBlendon et al.'s study shows Italy to have the\nlowest percentage of respondents (12%), who\nbelieve that only minor changes are necessary to\nmake the health care system work better. In\ncontrast, The Netherlands have the highest per-\ncentage of respondents who believe that only\nminor changes are needed (47%), although sup-\nport of major changes was also very high (51%) in\nthis country. It also reveals that having a national\nhealth programme does not equal a guarantee of\nhigh levels of satisfaction.\nBlendon et al. argued that the results suggest\nthat among the countries surveyed, public sat-\nisfaction is associated with higher levels of health\ncare spending per capita. They concluded that this\nmay be a reflection of the increased availability of\nmore sophisticated technologies, greater choice of\nphysicians, less waiting and travel time for elective\nand specialized medical procedures, and the age\nand modernity of health care facilities.\nTable 2 presents the results of the Euro-\nbarometer survey and Fig. 2 shows the relation-\nship between per capita health care expenditure\nand support for fundamental changes or complete\ntransformation of the system.\nThe results are compatible with those of the\nquestion on satisfaction. High dissatisfaction is\nlinked with support for major changes. In the\nUnited Kingdom, however, the percentage of\nthose asking for major changes or major trans-\nformation of the system (56%), 5 years after\nreforms were introduced, is much higher than that\nof those dissatisfied with the running of health care\n(40.9%). The same applies in a number of other\ncountries (mainly in Belgium, Greece, Spain,\nFrance, Ireland, Italy, Austria and Portugal) where\nthe percentage of those supporting major reforms\nor changes is higher compared with the percentage\nof those who are dissatisfied with the health\nsystem. This may reflect a shift in the opinion of\nFigure 1. Per capita expenditure on health in US purchasing power parities $ in 1993 and satisfaction from health system.\nTable 2. Citizens' attitudes to major health care reforms in the 15 EU Member States in 1996 and per capita\nexpenditure on health in US$ Purchasing Power Parities in 1996\nOn the whole, There are some There are some Health care in Other Per capita\nhealth care in good things ... good things ...

Which one\ncomes closest to your own point of view?\nthose who are neither satisfied nor dissatisfied\nbecause the question on satisfaction with the\nrunning of health care is more vague compared\nwith the question which asks citizens to express\ntheir views on the need for change. Further\nanalysis of the data will test this hypothesis.\nThe present survey shows that support for\nfundamental changes in the health system or for a\nFigure 2. Per capita expenditure on health in US purchasing power parities $ in 1993 and public support for fundamental reforms\nor complete restructuring of the health system.\ncomplete rebuilding of the system is not sig-\nnificant in Germany (18.9%), The Netherlands\nis apparently very low compared with the results\nin West Germany, 51% in The Netherlands, 52%\nin France and 64% in Sweden). On the other\nhand, in both surveys respondents in Italy and the\nUnited Kingdom appear to be in favour of a\nmajor reform of the system, although the percent-\nages are lower for both countries in the Euro-\nbarometer survey. In Blendon et al.'s survey 86%\nof the Italians and 69% of the United Kingdom\ncitizens were in favour of a major reform of the\nsystem, whereas in the Eurobarometer survey\nrespectively.\nRegarding the public's attitude to health spend-\ning, the public offers support for increasing health\nexpenditure but it opposes raising taxes or health\ninsurance contributions.\nCitizens' demand for more health spending\ndiffers significantly among the EU Member States\n(Table 3). The demand is very high in Greece,\nPortugal, the United Kingdom and Ireland, high\nin Spain, Italy and Sweden and relatively high in\nThe Netherlands. In Denmark, Germany, France,\nLuxembourg, Austria and Finland the majority of\nthe respondents would like their governments to\nspend the same amount on health. In Belgium,\nthe largest share of respondents would also like\nthe government to spend the same amount on\nhealth. Only a small minority of the respondents\nwere in favour of less governmental spending on\nhealth. The percentage is higher in France\nThose who favoured increased spending on\nhealth were also asked how the government\nshould find money for this. The respondents were\ngiven a number of options including raising taxes\nand health insurance contributions and spending\nless money on other things. Most of the respon-\ndents in all EU Member States favoured the\noption of spending less on other things which may\nindicate tax resistance across Europe with regard\nto increased health care spending. However, tax\nresistance in the United Kingdom, Sweden and\nDenmark was the lowest, although still high, of all\ncountries surveyed. In the United Kingdom,\n68.9% of respondents, respectively, who were in\nfavour of increased health care spending want the\ngovernment to find money by spending less on\nother things. In contrast, the relevant percentages\nfor Belgium, Germany, France and Finland are\nraising taxes or health insurance contributions is\nalso very high in all southern EU countries. The\nresponses in some of these countries may reflect a\ngeneral distrust by the public of the government's\nmanagement of resources. Citizens were not\nasked whether there were also corresponding\nbenefits from raising taxes or health insurance\ncontributions without reducing expenditure on\nother things. The responses may have been\ndifferent if citizens were asked to indicate in\nwhich sectors governments should contain expen-\nditure. Nevertheless, the responses may indicate\nthat citizens expect efficiency savings in other\nsectors and are opposed to tax increases.\nCONCLUSION\nOur understanding of public opinion on health\ncare systems can be enhanced by comparing\nresults of different studies. But instead of seeking\nuniversal conclusions prematurely, more research\nis needed to verify, replicate and improve our\nknowledge of how different political, economic\nand cultural environments affect public opinion.\nPrevious surveys' data differ extensively from our\nresearch in measures, sample and time period.\nDifferent results in surveys may reflect differ-\nences in the sampling techniques or the different\ncontexts in which the same question was asked.\nChanges in the wording of questions, even minor,\nand the method of interviewing respondents (i.e.\nface to face or telephone interview) may also lead\nto different results. There are also differences\nconcerning the sampling methods employed in\ndifferent surveys which may affect the results.\nThe Eurobarometer survey establishes an\nanchor point in the EU Member States and\ndespite a number of methodological problems\nand limitations can provide scientists and policy-\nmakers with useful information on citizens' views\non health care. Changes in citizens' views in the\nfuture could be taken into account to measure the\npopularity of specific measures or reforms.\nIncreased dissatisfaction or satisfaction with\nhealth systems may be an indirect indicator of\npublic disapproval or acceptability of the reforms.\nAs more and more governments preach that one\nTable 3. Attitudes to health care spending in the 15 EU Member States (%)\nThe original wording of the question read: Do you think that the (nationality) government should spend more, the same amount as today or less on health care?\nTable 4.

This paper exam-\nined the general trends in each EU Member State.\nThe initial analysis of the survey draws three\ntentative conclusions:\nFirst, the study shows that there is a north\u00ad\nsouth divide concerning citizens' satisfaction with\nhealth care systems, with the United Kingdom\nand Ireland being between the two patterns.\nSecond, satisfaction may be related to higher\nspending on health care but there are two\n`extreme' cases -- Italy and Denmark. The case\nof Denmark needs further study -- a country\nwhich spends only 6.7% of its GDP on health, has\nfew private beds, a system that is primarily funded\npublicly, with a strong emphasis on family practice\nand which has achieved significant efficiency gains\ndissatisfaction with the health system in Italy was\nquite high before the establishment of the NHS11\nand continues to be high in all surveys that were\nconducted since then.\nIt may also be the case that because overall\nbudgets for health services or for part of the\nhealth sector were imposed so late in the day (in\nmost countries in the mid-1980s), waiting for\nappointments with specialists or admission to\nhospital are not yet major problems in Belgium,\nGermany, France or The Netherlands as they are\nin the United Kingdom. There may be, therefore,\na change in the public's views in the future if\nhealth care in Europe becomes more managed\nand if the pace of increasing demand outstrips the\npace of gains from efforts to improve efficiency.\nFinally, the public is divided regarding the\nattitude to more health spending but it seems that\nthe majority of those favouring more spending are\nopposed to raising taxes or health insurance\ncontributions and would like governments to\nspend less in other sectors.\nShould governments base their decision-mak-\ning on the public's views and attitudes or should\nthey disregard these views as irrelevant? Govern-\nments need to be aware of the public's wants and\nneeds, but should not be obliged to base their\ndecision-making on the public's demand. The use\nof scientific evidence on what really works should\nbe always taken into account in policy formation\nand implementation. Public dissatisfaction, if per-\nsistent, may indicate that specific measures have\nbeen either ill conceived or badly implemented\nand communicated. As R. H.
