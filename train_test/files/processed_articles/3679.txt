Apoptotic effects of RA at 4, 8, or 16 \u00b5M in OE33 and A549 cell lines,\nan esophageal squamous cancer cell line and a non\u00adsmall-cell lung cancer cell line, were examined. RA at 4 to 16 \u00b5M\ninhibited the survival of both cell lines. RA at 8 and 16 \u00b5M decreased Bcl-2 expression and at 4 to 16 \u00b5M upregulated Bax\nand cleaved caspase-3 expression. RA treatments decreased the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax in those cells. RA at 4 to 16 \u00b5M lowered\nNa+-K+-ATPase activity and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in OE33 and A549 cells. RA at 8 and 16 \u00b5M\nenhanced DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 and caspase-9 expression in OE33 cells. In A549 cells, RA increased caspase-3\nexpression in a concentration-dependent manner; but only at 8 and 16 \u00b5M, it upregulated caspase-9 expression. RA\ntreatments at 4 to 16 \u00b5M decreased protein kinase c activity, suppressed the expression of cytochrome c and apoptosis-\ninducing factor, and lowered the production of reactive oxygen species, vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming\ngrowth factor-1, and tumor necrosis factor- in both cell lines. RA at 8 and 16 \u00b5M downregulated hypoxia-inducible factor-\n1 expression. These findings suggest that RA could penetrate into OE33 and A549 cells and execute cytotoxic activities.\n",

Human\nlung cancers are classified into 2 major types: small-cell\nlung cancer (SCLC) and non\u00adsmall-cell lung cancer\n(NSCLC); the latter is the most common type.1 Lung cancer\nremains the most lethal malignancy. The incidence of\nesophageal cancer is relatively low when compared with\nthat of lung cancer; however, its survival rate is poor.2 Thus,\nthe development of agents with inhibitory effect against\nesophagus cancer cells warrants attention.\nRotundic acid (RA; Figure 1) is a pentacyclic triterpenic\nacid naturally occurring in many medicinal plants such\nas Mussaenda macrophylla, olive (Olea europaea), and\nGlochidion obliquum.3-5 It is reported that this triterpenic\nacid could exhibit cytotoxic activities toward human hepato-\ncellular carcinoma (HepG2), malignant melanoma (A375),\nSCLC (NCI-H446), breast cancer (MCF-7), and colon can-\ncer (HT-29) cell lines.6,7 These studies implied that this trit-\nerpenic acid was a potent anticancer agent. However, it is\nunknown if RAcould inhibit the growth of esophagus cancer\nand/or NSCLC cells. OE33, a human esophageal squamous\ncancer cell line, and A549, a NSCLC cell line, have been\nwidely used to investigate the apoptotic effects and possible\nmechanism of certain compounds against esophagus cancer\nand NSCLC.8,9 In the present study, both cancer cell lines\nwere also used to examine the cytotoxic potential and action\nmode of RA at various concentrations.\nCancer cell death could be induced by activating the\nmitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This pathway is mainly\nmediated by BCL family of proteins, in which the expres-\nsion of apoptotic factors such as Bax is increased and/or\nthe expression of antiapoptotic factors such as Bcl-2 is\ndecreased.10 The changes in these proteins trigger perme-\nabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane of cancer\ncells, which causes the loss of mitochondrial membrane\npotential (MMP),11 enhances the release of cytochrome c\n1Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Science, China Medical University,\nTaichung City, Taiwan\n2Division of Thoracic Surgery, China Medical University Hospital,\nTaichung City, Taiwan\n3Shanghai Research Center for the Modernization of Traditional Chinese\nMedicine, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of\nSciences, Shanghai, China\n4Department of Nutrition, China Medical University, Taichung City,\nTaiwan\n5Department of Health and Nutrition Biotechnology, Asia University,\nTaichung City, Taiwan\nCorresponding Author:\nMei-chin Yin, Department of Nutrition, China Medical University,\nTaichung City, Taiwan.\nEmail: mcyin@mail.cmu.edu.tw\nApoptotic Effects of Rotundic Acid on\nHuman Esophagus and Lung Cancer Cells\nYu-sen Lin, MD1,2, Lihong Hu, PhD3, and Mei-chin Yin, PhD4,5\n Keywords\nrotundic acid, esophagus cancer, lung cancer, apoptosis\n2 Integrative Cancer Therapies \nand apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and activates the mito-\nchondria-derived caspase cascade, such as caspase-3 and\ncaspase-9.12,13 These events eventually lead to cancer cell\ndeath. In addition, Na+-K+-ATPase, a key enzyme in the tri-\ncarboxylic acid cycle, is a transmembrane protein respon-\nsible for exchanging intracellular Na+ for extracellular K+.14\nAbnormality in this enzyme disturbs ion homeostasis and\nimpairs mitochondrial functions. So far, little information\nis available regarding the influence of RA on the variation\nof Bcl-2, Bax, MMP, caspases, cytochrome c, and Na+-K+-\nMalignant tumor growth creates a hypoxic environment\nbecause of insufficient blood supply, which stimulates reactive\noxygen species (ROS) production and hypoxia-inducible fac-\nvates protein kinase c (PKC) and promotes tumor proliferation\nand differentiation.16,17 Furthermore, greater HIF-1 facili-\ntates the transcription of several genes encoding for angiogenic\nand autocrine growth factors, including vascular endothelial\ngrowth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-1,\nand tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, which consequently bene-\nfits the progression of cancer cell angiogenesis and metasta-\nsis.18,19 Thus, if RA could decrease the production of these\nfactors, it might provide more efficient anticancer activities.\nMaterials and Methods\nChemicals\nRA (98.5%) was obtained from Shanghai Institute of\nMateria Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China.\nMedium, chemicals, plates, and antibiotics used for cell cul-\nture were purchased from Difco Laboratory (Detroit, MI).\nCell Culture\nNormal human esophagus cell (Het-1A), normal human\nlines were bought from American Type Culture Collection\n(Rockville, MD). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640\nmedium, which contained 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL\nof penicillin, and 100 U/mL of streptomycin (pH 7.4) at\n. The culture medium was refreshed every\n3 days, and cells were subcultured every week. Phosphate-\nbuffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) was added to adjust the cell\nnumber to 105/mL for experiments and analyses.\nExperimental Design\nStock solution of RA was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide\n(DMSO) and diluted with medium. The final DMSO con-\ncentration in medium was 0.1%. DMSO at this concentration\ndid not affect cell viability and other measurements (data\nnot shown). Test cells (105/mL) were treated with RA at 0\nwhich resulted in 95.9% \u00b1 1.5% incorporation of RA.\nDiphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Assay\nMTT assay was done to examine cell viability. After RA\ntreatment, cells were incubated with 0.25 mg MTT/mL for\n3 hours at 37\u00b0C. The amount of MTT formazan product was\ndetermined by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm using a\nBio-Rad microplate reader (Hercules, CA), with 630 nm as\na reference. Cell viability was expressed as a percentage of\ncontrol groups.\nMeasurement of MMP\nMMP was assayed by flow cytometry (Beckman-FC500,\nBeckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA), and the fluorescent dye\nChemical Co (St Louis, MO). Cells were suspended in\nmedium and followed by incubation for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C.\nAfter washing twice with PBS, the mean fluorescence\nintensity was analyzed.\nPreparation of Mitochondrial Fractions\nControl or treated cells were lysed in 5 mL cold lysis buffer\nenediaminetetraacetic acid), 1.5 mM MgCl\n1 mM PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 1 mM DTT\nAfter centrifuging at 200g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C, the super-\nnatant was collected and further centrifuged at 10000g for\n20 minutes at 4\u00b0C to obtain mitochondria pellet. This pellet\nwas then resuspended in PBS. Protein concentration of\nthe mitochondrial fraction was determined by an assay kit\n(Pierce Biotechnology Inc, Rockford, IL).\nNa+-K+-ATPase Activity Assay\nNa+-K+-ATPase activity was assayed by measuring the\namount of inorganic phosphate (Pi) released from ATP.20\nThe reaction mixture contained 100 mmol/L NaCl, 20\nmmol/L KCl, 2 mmol/L ATP, 30 mmol/L Tris-HCl buffer\n(pH 7.4), and the freshly isolated cellular mitochondria.\nThis assay was initiated by adding ATP and terminated by\nadding 15% trichloroacetic acid after 15 minutes of incuba-\ntion at 37\u00b0C. The released Pi was quantified by measuring\nthe absorbance at 640 nm. The value was expressed as a\npercentage of control groups.\nFigure 1. Structure of rotundic acid.\nLin et al 3\nDetermination of DNA Fragmentation\nA commercial ELISA plus kit (Roche Molecular Bio-\nchemicals, Mannheim, Germany) was used to measure\nDNA fragmentation. After incubation with RA at various\nconcentrations, cells were lysed for 30 minutes at room\ntemperature and followed by centrifugation at 200g for 10\nminutes. Then, 20 \u00b5L supernatant was transferred onto the\nstreptavidin-coated plate, and 80 \u00b5L freshly prepared immu-\nnoreagent was added into each well and followed by incu-\nbation for 2 hours at room temperature. After washing with\nPBS, the substrate solution was added and then incubated\nfor 15 minutes. The absorbance at 405 nm (reference wave-\nlength 490 nm) was measured using a microplate reader.\nDNA fragmentation was expressed as the enrichment\nfactor using the following equation: enrichment factor =\n(Absorbance of RA treated cells)/(Absorbance of controls).\nMeasurement of ROS, TNF-, TGF-1, and VEGF\nROS level was measured by 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diace-\ntate (DCFH-DA). Cell homogenate at 100 \u00b5L was reacted\nFluorescence values were determined by a fluorescence\nThe result was expressed as relative fluorescence unit\n(RFU)/mg protein. The levels of TNF-, TGF-1, and\nVEGF in cell culture supernatant were measured using\nELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).\nPKC Activity Assay\nPKC activity was determined by a peptide pseudosubstrate,\nwhich could be phosphorylated by PKC.21 In brief, cell pellets\nwere washed twice in ice-cold PBS and suspended in 1 mL\nmercaptoethanol, 10 mM EGTA [ethyleneglycoltetraacetic\nacid], 10 mM benzamidine, and 1 mM PMSF; pH 7.5). After\ncentrifugation, protein concentration was determined. PKC\nactivity was assayed by a protein kinase assay kit (EMD Bio-\nsciences, Darmstadt, Germany). Color intensity was measured\nat 492 nm, and the relative kinase activity was calculated.\nWestern Blot Analyses\nCells were suspended in lysis buffer, and protein content was\ndetermined. Sample at 40 \u00b5g protein was applied to 10%\nSDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to\na nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for\n1 hour. After blocking with a solution containing 5% non-\nfat milk for 1 hour, the membrane was incubated with\nanti\u00adcaspase-3, anti\u00adcaspase-9, anticytochrome c, anti-AIF\n(Boehringer-Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN, USA) at 4\u00b0C over-\nnight and followed by reaction with horseradish peroxidase\nconjugated antibody for 2 hours. The detected bands were\nquantified by Scion Image analysis software (Scion Corp,\nFrederick, MD), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydro-\ngenase (GAPDH) was used as a loading control. The blot was\nimaged by autoradiography and normalized to GAPDH.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe effect of each treatment was analyzed from 10 different\npreparations (n = 10). Data were reported as means \u00b1 SD\nand subjected to analysis of variance. Differences among\nmeans were determined by the least significance difference\ntest, with significance defined at P <.05.\nResults\nRA Decreased Cancer Cell Viability\nRA treatments at 0.5 to 16 \u00b5M did not affect the viability of\nHet-1A and BEAS-2B cells and normal human esophagus\nand bronchial epithelial cell lines (Figure 2, P > .05). RA\ntreatments at 0.5, 1, and 2 \u00b5M did not affect the viability of\nOE33 and A549 cells and esophagus and lung cancer cell\nlines. However, RA at 4 to 16 \u00b5M inhibited the survival of\nboth cell lines (P < .05) in a concentration-dependent man-\nner. After calculation, the values of IC\ncells, RA at 4 to 16 \u00b5M decreased Bcl-2 expression and\nincreased the expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3\n(Figure 3, P < .05), and Bax expression was enhanced in a\n(percentage of control), determined by MTT assay, in human Het-\nwith RA at various concentrations, cells were further incubated with\nMTT for 3 hours at 37\u00b0C.

RA at 4 to 16 \u00b5M decreased the ratio\nof Bcl-2/Bax in both cell lines (P < .05).\nRA Impaired Mitochondrial and DNA Stabilities\nAs shown in Table 1, RA at 4 to 16 \u00b5M reduced MMP\ndependent manner. RA at these concentrations, without a\nconcentration-dependent effect, also lowered Na+-K+-ATPase\nactivity in both cell lines (P < .05). RA only at 8 and 16 \u00b5M\nlated caspase-3 and caspase-9 expression in OE33 cells\nin a concentration-dependent manner but increased caspase-9\nexpression only at 8 and 16 \u00b5M (P < .05). RA treatments at\n4 to 16 \u00b5M decreased PKC activity in both cell lines, and\na concentration-dependent effect appeared in A549 cells\nRA Suppressed Cytochrome c, AIF, and HIF-1\nExpression\nAs shown in Figure 6, RA at 4 to 16 \u00b5M suppressed cyto-\nchrome c and AIF expression in both cell lines (P < .05),\nand a concentration-dependent effect was observed in\ndecreasing AIF expression in OE33 cells (P < .05). RA at 8\nand 16 \u00b5M downregulated HIF-1 expression in both cell\nlines (P < .05). RA at 4 to 16 \u00b5M lowered ROS, TNF-,\nP < .05), in which a concentration-dependent effect was\nseen in the reduction of ROS, VEGF, and TGF-1 levels in\nDiscussion\nThe cytotoxic effects of RA against liver, breast, and colon\ncancer cells have been reported.6,7 Our present study\nextended the inhibitory activity of this triterpenic acid\nNSCLC cells. Our data revealed that RA suppressed\nprotein expression of Bcl-2 and HIF-1, lowered MMP,\nincreased DNA fragmentation, promoted caspase activa-\ntion, and decreased VEGF and TGF-1 production in both\ncancer cell lines, which consequently led to cell apoptosis.\nThese novel findings prove that RA was a potent agent\nagainst esophagus cancer and NSCLC. In addition, RA at\ntest concentrations did not affect the survival of normal\nhuman esophagus and bronchial, Het-1A, and BEAS-2B\ncells. Thus, the application of RA for esophagus or lung\ncancer prevention or therapy might be safe.\nApoptosis could be induced through the mitochondrial\napoptotic pathway. We found that RA lowered Bcl-2 expres-\nsion, increased Bax and cleaved caspase-3 expression, and\nObviously, the apoptotic action of RA in these 2 cancer cell\nlines was a result of its induction of the mitochondrial\napoptotic pathway via decreasing antiapoptotic defense\nand increasing apoptotic action. DNA fragmentation is a\nmarker of cell rupture and death. Our data indicated that\nRA treatments led to greater DNA fragmentation in OE33\nand A549 cells. These results suggested that RA could pen-\netrate into these cells, disrupt plasma membrane integrity,\nand cause DNA damage. Na+-K+-ATPase is a transmem-\nbrane protein responsible for the maintenance of Na+-K+\nion homeostasis. Abnormality in this enzyme led to the loss\nof MMP and the release of caspases.22,23 The presence of\nRA markedly reduced Na+-K+-ATPase activity and MMP\nin both cell lines. Thus, the observed cytotoxic activity of\nRA could be partially ascribed to this compound impairing\nmitochondrial stability and functions. RA treatments also\neffectively upregulated the expression of caspase-9 and\ncaspase-3, an upstream initiator and a downstream effector,\nin the caspase cascade. The activation of these caspases\nfurther mediates gene expression and signal transduction,\nwhich consequently promotes proteolytic cleavage, DNA\ndamage, and cell death. These findings indicated that RA\nwas able to activate both upstream and downstream cas-\npases in OE33 and A549 cells and facilitated apoptotic\nreactions in these cancer cells. In addition, both caspase-9\nand caspase-3 are involved in death signal transduction\nin the death receptor pathway.24 Thus, it is possible that\nRA-induced apoptosis in both cancer cell lines was\npartially a result of its activation of this death receptor\npathway.\nTable 1.

The inhibitory effects of RA on\nPKC activation in those cells might contribute to retarding\nesophagus cancer and NSCLC progression via decreasing\nassociated pathways. Both cytochrome c and AIF play\nimportant roles in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and\ncell survival.28,29 It is reported that increased AIF enhanced\ntumor differentiation in esophageal squamous cell carci-\nnoma.30 Thus, the lower protein expression of cytochrome c\nand AIF after RA treatments that we observed implied that\nthe mitochondrial respiratory chain of OE33 and A549 cells\nwas damaged. These data once again prove that RA could\ncause mitochondrial malfunctions in those cells. HIF-1\nregulates the essential adaptive process for cancer cells to\nthe hypoxic microenvironment, the major pathophysiological\ncondition for cancer progression.15 HIF-1 overexpression\nwas a predictive factor for poor prognosis or worse survival\nrate for NSCLC and esophagus cancer patients.31,32 Thus,\n48 hours of treatment with RA at various concentrations, cells were further processed by Western blot analyses.

Furthermore, HIF-1 is a transcriptional fac-\ntor for VEGF expression.33 Because RA treatments already\ndownregulated HIF-1 expression in both cancer cell lines,\nthe lower VEGF generation in these cells could be explained.\nROS is an oxidant, and TNF- is an inflammatory medi-\nator. Both VEGF and TGF-1 are angiogenic factors.\nIncreased ROS, TNF-, VEGF, and TGF-1 production\nenhance oxidative and inflammatory stress, which benefits\nmicrovascular permeability and cancer metastasis. Saji\net al34 indicated that TGF-1, via its immunosuppressive\neffect, promoted pulmonary metastasis in NSCLC patients.\nvon Rahden et al35 reported that TGF-1 overexpression\nwas highly associated with poor prognosis in patients with\nesophagus cancer. Thus, the lower production of ROS,\ncells suggested that angiogenic and metastatic actions in\nthese cancer cells were diminished. These findings imply\nthat RA might provide antiangiogenic and antimetastatic\nactivities in these cancer cells by decreasing oxidative,\ninflammatory, and angiogenic stress. RA is a natural com-\npound present in many edible plant foods or herbs such as\nG obliquum, O europaea, Ilex integra, and Randia for-\nmosa.4,5 Its natural property could enhance its use for dis-\nease prevention or therapy. However, the information\nregarding the in vivo activity and bioavailability of this\ncompound is limited. Thus, further in vivo studies are nec-\nessary to verify and ensure the safety and efficiency of RA.\nIn summary, RA treatments at 4 to 16 \u00b5M induced apop-\ntosis in OE33 andA549 cells. This triterpenic acid increased\nDNA fragmentation, decreased MMP and Na+-K+-ATPase\nactivity, and lowered VEGF and TGF-1 production in\nthese cancer cells. This agent also effectively suppressed\nprotein expression of Bcl-2, HIF-1, and cytochrome c.\nThese findings suggest that RA is a potent agent against\nesophagus and lung cancers.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article:\nThis study was partially supported by a grant from Ministry of\nReferences\n1.
