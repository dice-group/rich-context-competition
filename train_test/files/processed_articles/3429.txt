If language evolved in some group that\ndid not have sustained and peaceful contact with others, then a bilingual brain\nwould not be of much use, natural selection would not have favored it, and we\nwould end up with exactly the state of affairs we now have (pp. 57-58).\nI agree with Hagen that our capacity for bilingualism does provide insight into the nature of\nour ancestor's social ecology; I suggest however that what we know about human language\ncapacities leads to a very different conclusion about prehistoric sociality.\nHagen argues that the difficulty in learning a second language compared to learning\na first language is evidence that our ancestral communities lived in states of near constant\nhostility. I propose, to the contrary, that the ease with which children simultaneously learn\nBilingualism brain\nmultiple languages evinces a state of sustained cooperation and exchange between groups\nsuch that speakers of different groups, speaking different languages, recurrently\ncommingled over long periods of time (Hirschfeld, 2001).\nA singular property of the language acquisition device (LAD) supports the\nconclusion that modern humans lived in markedly multilingual communities. The language\nacquisition device is in fact misnamed; it is device for acquiring multiple languages\nsimultaneously. During the period in which young children acquire their first language,\nthey are capable of (and often do) acquire several languages without significant decrement\nto first language acquisition. This ability to effortlessly acquire several languages is a\nsingular design feature of the LAD. What other complex cognitive skill is unaffected by\ndoubling or even tripling the acquisition task? Learning to add and subtract at the same\ntime surely takes more cognitive effort and time than learning only to add by itself.\nConsider another task that like language is subserved by a special-purpose acquisition\ndevice, namely, learning to classify nonhuman living things. Flora and fauna represent two\naspects of the same system which would lead us to expect that they are learned together. As\nHickling and Gelman (1995) have demonstrated, however, young children initially over\nattribute animal properties to plants but not vice versa, suggesting that learning about the\ntwo biological kingdoms is to some extent not simultaneous but serial.\nHagen is correct that learning a second language as an adult is relatively more\ndifficult than learning a first language as a child. However, this is not the relevant contrast.\nBilingualism \u00ad the simultaneous acquisition of two languages \u00ad is simply no more difficult\nthan learning a first language (to the extent that it makes sense to talk about first and\nsecond language acquisition when two languages are learned at the same time). This\nachievement is all the remarkable since some of the processes that enable bilingual\nacquisition (e.g., establishing two distinct lexicons) would otherwise seem to compete with\nprocesses that enable single language acquisition (e.g., a single word for each whole\nobject).\nThis does not mean that all features of the language acquisition process support\nmultilingualism. Consider accent. Children of nonnative speakers (i.e., speakers who\nlearned a second language as an adult) do not acquire the nonnative accent of their parents,\neven though parental speech is plausibly the primary linguistic input (Harris, 1998;\nHirschfeld, 2001). Indeed, these children develop the accent of the speech community in\nwhich they live. Presumably they accomplish this by giving greater weight to less frequent\nbut more community relevant input. Nor is this due to the language learner's inability to\ndistinguish accented from unaccented speech, as Kinzler, Dupoux, and Spelke's (2007)\nrecent and elegant study with 6-month-old infants demonstrates. (More generally,\ndifferential attention to community standards is common among toddlers and preschool age\nchildren in domains ranging from accent to racial and gender stereotypes.)\nNor do multiple language environments in themselves always lead to reproducing\nmultilingualism. An important distinction needs to be drawn between communities in\nwhich vestiges of multiple lingualism are found and communities in which several\nlanguages are spoken over long periods of time. As Hagen notes, massacre sites often do\nnot contain the remains of fertile women, suggesting that they are taken as spoils of war. In\nsuch a context it is plausible that captured women would not establish sustained, parallel\n(i.e., bilingual) language communities. In such contexts, where a dispreference against\ncultural forms of captured women's native communities seems plausible, the learner's\nBilingualism brain\npropensity not to acquire foreign-accented pronunciation would inhibit acquiring the\n(captured) mother's native language.\nEffortless multilingual acquisition, in contrast, is consistent with the peaceful\nmovement of women between communities, a pattern of multilingualism that\nanthropological linguists have long acknowledged is the rule rather than the exception (Gal\nand Irvine, 1995). This pattern is also consistent with a long tradition in anthropology\ndocumenting the high frequency of exogamous marriage (and long-distance trade). As\nLevi-Strauss showed half a century ago, kinship systems with both direct and indirect\n\"exchange of women\" between groups are arguably the fundamental building block of\nhuman sociality. In sparsely settled landscapes with exchanging groups (whether through\nmarriage or sustained long-distance trade relations) the evolution of a cognitive capacity for\nmultiple language acquisition would subserve sustained and peaceful contact between\ncommunities speaking different languages.\nHagen's argument is consistent with a long-dominant view that our ancestral\nenvironment was wracked by warfare and near-constant threat of intergroup predation.\nIgnoring for the moment that even in the ancestral environment many important group\ndifferences were intragroup rather than intergroup, the evidence for this Hobbesian portrait\nis not overwhelming. Warfare may well not have been as endemic as this view holds, and\nevidence of frequent prehistoric warfare comes largely from more recent settlements\n(Ferguson, 2003). Even if competition for scarce resources did eventually reach a critical\npoint in the late Pleistocene, the period during which most complex cognitive functions\nevolved was characterized by extremely sparse settlement patterns and (arguably) low\nlevels of intergroup predation.\nMuch of my speculation here is based on a fairly simple observation: in terms of\ncomplex cognitive mechanisms, it is less languages that have evolved than language\nacquisition devices. Increasingly more complex linguistic structures emerged as distinct\nLADs evolved, presumably as adaptations to challenges grounded in shifts in the human\nand nonhuman environments. There is no reason to suppose that low cost multiple language\nacquisition is an especially ancient feature, as the scope and frequency of multiple language\ncommunities are likely a fairly late evolutionary condition. To conclude as Hagen does that\nbilingualism is largely a function of adult second language acquisition misses the point.\nBilingualism \u00ad like recent work on evolved moral judgments (Haidt, 2007; Hauser, 2006) \u00ad\nis persuasive evidence against a brutish portrait of our ancestral past.\nReferences\nGal, S., and Irvine, J.
