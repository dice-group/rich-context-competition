The proposed\npolicy model is integrative, self-reflexive, and procedural in\nits nature, which provides several benefits: First, it recon-\nciles the perceived theoretical and ideological schism in for-\nmulating the public interest, as it combines the benefits of\neconomic development with social unity in fulfilling democ-\nracy. Second, it is flexible in responding to the current policy\ncondition because the self-reflexive mechanism corrects and\nrenews the ongoing policy system. Finally, it offers the\ngrounds for communication research contributing to the pol-\nicy process for its procedural step essentially involves vari-\nous contextual analyses that in turn demands communication\nresources and research. See Figure 1 for the proposed model.\nThe Policy Objective:\nThe Public Interest Standard\nOne major challenge in the development of diversity policy\nstems from the competing principles of the public interest.\nThe FCC's interpretation of the public interest mandate\nmeans achieving competition, diversity, and localism (Report\nand Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 2003; Report\nand Order on Reconsideration, 2008). Alas, these concepts\nare elusive, and difficult to measure. There is considerable\nconceptual overlap between localism and diversity, which\nmakes it difficult to distinguish localism from diversity.\nMore importantly, not all these values fit into the existing\npolicy framework due to its deficiency in social and political\nevaluative criteria. While competition lends itself to the\nexisting economic analysis, diversity and localism do not\n(Ho & Quinn, 2009). As history tells us, the failure of diver-\nsity policy is often a result of the FCC's vague definition of\nregulatory concepts of diversity, closely tied to the public\ninterest standard.\nEstablishing the Public Interest Standard: Political,\nSocial, and Economic Values\nMedia and communications policy is made for the benefit of\nthe public. The public, according to John Dewey, is a social\ncreation that is not biased toward government administrative\ngoals nor individual freedom, but the product that reflects\nconsequences of social, political, and economic consider-\nations we all share (see also Aufderheid, 1999; Van\nCuilenburg & McQuail, 2003, for the dimensions of the pub-\nlic interest). Although the public interest may take various\nforms, depending on what current national policy empha-\nsizes and how a legal system operates in a society, the gen-\neral components of public interest should encompass these\nthree considerations, necessary for guiding media and com-\nmunications policy.\nThe criteria defining political values are associated with\nthe function of democracy, ensured by the adoption of the\nFirst Amendment: Pluralism and diversity are political goals,\nconcerned with whether diverse ownership and content\nwould cultivate informed citizenry for their meaningful par-\nticipation in democratic public life. Social values relate to\nthe social impact of media content in terms of cultural and\nsocial benefits; under this consideration, diversity concerns\nwhether diverse viewpoints in media content foster socially\ndesirable outcomes for the public needs. Economic values\nrelate to the economic efficiency of technology, competition,\nand profits; under this consideration, diversity concerns\nwhether diverse competition and media outlets provides an\naccess for citizens' participatory democracy. Economic val-\nues, however, are more effective in facilitating pluralism\nthan diversity. Understood by and large, the political premise\nof freedom of expression, such as democracy, has been\nenforced through the economic consideration of effective\ncompetition as well the social consideration of critical and\nsubstantive media content. Discerning the complementary\nfunction of the public interest is thus desirable for approving\nparticular communication services and improving the poli-\ncies while avoiding a potential political conflict, fueled by\nfollowing the narrow logic in competing principles (see\nFigure 2).\nDiversity Policy Objective: Pluralism to Serve\nDemocracy\nDiversity as political pluralism is to achieve democracy. By\ncreating diverse sources, and ideas (i.e., pluralism) through\nan open communication system (i.e., public sphere or mar-\nketplace), it attempts to facilitate genuine public debate by\nparticipation of well-informed citizens (i.e., democracy).\nWithin this framing, diversity policymaking starts from stat-\ning a clear policy objective, that is, \"creating pluralism to\nserve democracy.\" The critical relationship between media\nand democracy in a society has often been debated, primarily\ndue to the presumption that media exercises a critical public\nFigure 1. Media diversity policy paradigm.\nrole in cultivating citizenship. Whether citizens take an\nactive role in making a democratic decision largely hinges on\nthe responsibility of media in a self-governing system. This\nraises a diversity inquiry into whether the current media sys-\ntem functions as a source of guidance for citizens' participa-\ntion and deliberation in democracy, which ultimately guides\nthe FCC's implementation of the public interest standard for\nthe diversity policy.\nTheory Proposed:\nGuidance to the Policymaking\nThe Integrative Theory: Political\nOutcomes in Economic and Social Contexts\nTwo major approaches to diversity revolve around the eco-\nnomic and social values of media's democratic performance:\nEach conceptualizes media diversity within separate domains\nand proposes divergent ways of envisioning audiences,\nnamely,\"citizens\"and\"consumers,\"respectively.Responding\nto such division, many critics have suggested the need for\nconceptual clarification in the study of communications pol-\nure of issue-oriented policy analysis is due to certain theoreti-\ncal propositions that oversimplify contradictions and\ncomplexities of the negotiation held by policymakers. In a\nsimilar vein, Entman and Wildman (1992) criticized the lack\nof constructive discussion between the market economics and\nsocial value schools of thoughts and unwillingness to learn\nfrom the other's approach.\nThe proposed theory responds to the need for developing\nan analytical framework for diversity policy that involves the\nwider intellectual frames consistent to the public interest\nstandard, and discerning complementary functions of social\nand economic goal in achieving political goal, democracy.\nSocial and economic theories share common goals in the\nspecific context of media regulation, such as pursuing lib-\nerty, pluralism, and diversity, although they differ in their\npreferred means of achieving these goals. The effort in con-\nceptual clarification of the diversity principle, thus, should\nexamine common goals as well as contentious issues devel-\noped from social and economic standpoints on the diversity\npolicy.\nEconomic Approach: Empirical Claim and\nEfficiency of Competition\nThe economic approach has its roots in market liberalism,\ndubbed the market economics. It maintains that the media\nshould carry content that most appeals to consumers, and suc-\ncess of media performance is primarily measured by market\neconomics, the market economics proposes the benefits of the\nfree market, advancing the neutral role of government due to\nits distrust of government. The market is more responsible to\nconsumers than the state, thus can enhance consumer choices\n(Vick, 2006). By establishing a free market line, the economic\napproach legitimatized deregulation policy (see Candeub,\nextent, the market theory offers an assumption that pluralism\nand diversity will flourish within a free marketplace.\nThe economic concept of market liberalism has been\nwidely applied in the courts and ownership regulations,\ndubbed the marketplace of ideas metaphor. Accordingly, the\nmarketplace of ideas has served as the theoretical underpin-\nning of the diversity principle in the United States (see\nhis dissenting opinion in Abrams v. United States. The meta-\nphor suggests that the best policy can be made out of the\n\"competition of extensively various ideas\" in an unregulated\nmarket, well reflected in the FCC's assumption that ensuring\nantagonistic sources would be instrumental to achieving\ndiverse viewpoints for audiences.\nIn policy and juridical circumstances, empirical evidence\ntakes an important role in justifying FCC's regulatory efforts.\nEconomic analysis is inherently quantitative, and thus can\nestimate the causal mechanism involved in the issue by either\nproving or disproving the theory. Such an empirical assess-\nment functions to narrow down a general claim of diversity\nto testable outcomes, and accordingly can generate prag-\nmatic alternatives to the market reality. Historically, eco-\nnomic analysis has a large role to play in policymaking.\nFigure 2. Dimensions of the public interest and media institution.\n4 SAGE Open\nHowever, the empirical analyses of the economic\napproach alone do not effectively capture the democratic val-\nues associated with media content (i.e., diverse viewpoint\ncultivating citizenship). Although mass media policy has\nused various methods to serve the policy interests of market\nefficiency and democratic issues (Shelanski, 2006), demo-\ncratic values within the economic approach have often been\ndefined as pluralism satisfying popular demands rather than\ndiversity. Moreover, the FCC has failed to provide substan-\ntial evidence to prove the nexus between liberalizing media\nmarkets and preserving deliberative democratic values.\nConsumers' ideas are often the opposite of the diverse intel-\nlectual activity and politically informed public body the mar-\nketplace of ideas suggests, as they tend to eschew challenging\nestablished notions (see Curran, 2000; Entman & Wildman,\n1992). This illustrates the limitation of market economics in\noffering appropriate insights into diversity policy goals, and\nthe need for incorporating a social approach to the diversity\nprinciple and policy development.\nSocial Approach: Moral Claim and the Media\nContent in Cultivating Deliberative Democracy\nThe social-based theory, in general, pursues statism, egalitar-\nian, and deliberative democracy (see Baker, 2007; Croteau &\nexpression in the advocacy of government intervention for\nenhancing social values and protecting the public interest\nagainst the private market power. It purports that unregulated\nprivate market power is socially detrimental, and can be a\nthreat to democracy, diversity, and freedom of expression;\nthus, it does not identify market efficiency as a primary goal\n2006). Concerned with the inequality of market power, social\nadvocates would argue that the decentralization of media\nownership, for its own sake, should be a political goal (e.g.,\nHowever, they also view the ownership restrictions relying\non economic mechanism of antitrust law as failure in terms\nof connecting to any quantifiable social and political goals\nWith an emphasis on deliberative democracy, promoting\ndiversity is seen as facilitating an informed public discussion\nof important issues and rational-critical debates (see\nShelanski, 2006). To achieve such goals, it underlines the\nmedia's obligation to pursue social goals as public resources\nover their professed organizational goals. Hence, diversity is\nassessed in terms of whether the media facilitate critical\nindependent thought among citizens, information quality,\nand the social/cultural order in society, and whether policy\ncan effectively help the media provide different viewpoints.\nBecause of assuring citizens'informed judgments about pub-\nlic issues, the social approach meets the requirement for\ndeliberative democratic values of media content vital to\nachieve diversity. Unfortunately though, social values are\noften dismissed as externalities by market economics propo-\nnents because they are not easily quantifiable (see Baker,\nApplication of the Policy: Government\nAction and Court Challenges\nThe application to policy involves not only government reg-\nulations on behalf of the public interest, but also court chal-\nlenges and judicial decisions about the constitutionality of\nproposed rules. The constitutionality of the rules and regula-\ntions, in this way, hinges on the government's logic to justify\nthe public interest. The following briefly provides regulatory\nconcepts of diversity defined by the FCC to increase the\nunderstanding of how the FCC uses them, and second exam-\nines the imposition of the regulations rules and the FCC's\njustifications for them.\nConcepts of Diversity Defined by the FCC\nThe FCC defined diversity as five distinctive yet interrelated\nconcepts, namely, viewpoint, program, outlet, source, and\nminority and women ownership diversity (FCC, 2011;\nReport and Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,\n2003): Viewpoint diversity refers to the availability of media\ncontent reflecting a variety of perspectives; Program diver-\nsity refers to a variety of programming formats and content;\nOutlet diversity means that, in a given market, there are mul-\ntiple independently owned firms; Source diversity refers to\nthe availability of media content from a variety of content\nproducers; Minority and female ownership diversity refers to\nencouraging minority and female ownership (Report and\nOrder and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 2003, para\n19-42). The first two concern content diversity while the\nlater three concern ownership diversity. Insisting on the pre-\nsumed link between ownership diversity and content diver-\nsity, the FCC has attempted to create viewpoint and program\ndiversity through outlet, source, and workforce diversity.\nThis explains that the FCC regulatory concepts center pri-\nmarily on competition of ownership to achieve diversity\ngoals.\nContent Control:\nFairness Doctrine\u00adPolitical Viewpoints\nIn spite of the First Amendment conflict, the content of\nbroadcasting has been subject to censorship due to its legally\ndistinctive nature; broadcasting can reach the general public\nand broadcasters are public trustees for the public. A primary\nexample is the fairness doctrine, mostly linked to viewpoint\ndiversity. The fairness doctrine reflects the public interest\nrationale for content restriction, allowing government\nsupervision of broadcasters' programming, mandating more\ndiverse programming, and particularly political viewpoints\n(see \"In Re Application of Great Lakes,\" 1929). The fairness\ndoctrine-based content restriction was validated and consti-\ntuted by firm establishment of the scarcity rationale in Red\nLion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC (1969). Nonetheless, faced\nwith FirstAmendment challenges, the public interest demand\nfor media delivering diverse viewpoints does not seem appli-\ncable to an increasingly competitive economic environment.\nAccordingly, with its opinion in Syracuse Peace Councils in\n1986, the FCC refused to enforce the fairness doctrine, and\nOwnership Regulations: Economic Analysis of\nAntitrust Law\nThe FCC's efforts to achieve diversity goals have focused\nheavily on ownership structure, largely guided by the eco-\nnomic principles of antitrust law (see Connolly & Kwerel,\ninvolve the three areas: ownership of outlet (outlet diversity),\nownership of programming (source diversity), and owner-\nship of workforce within the distribution system (minority\nand female ownership diversity).\nFrom the cross-ownership rules to cross-media limit: Outlet and\nviewpoint diversity. The FCC adheres to the presumption that out-\nlet diversity is the most reliable means of promoting viewpoint\ndiversity (Report and Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemak-\ning, 2003). To preserve outlet diversity, the FCC has imposed\nvarious cross-ownership rules to prevent common ownership\nwithin the same market (e.g., newspapers-broadcaster cross-\nownership and the television-radio cross-ownership). The\npublic interest rationale for these rules was to protect the\navailability of viewpoint diversity, pertinent to editorial con-\ntent, to local communities, closely linked to localism. Yet,\nthe newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule was substan-\ntially relaxed and the television-radio cross-ownership rule\nwas entirely eliminated (retained now due to a failure of jus-\ntifying the new rules), based on the FCC's adoption of the\ncross-media limits in 2002. The Commission explained that\nthere is no substantial record that indicates that the cross-\nownership limits significantly protect a diversity of view-\npoints (or localism) in those media (Report and Order and\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking, 2003; Report and Order\nWhen the commission fist proposed the newspaper-\nbroadcast cross-ownership rule it was challenged in FCC v.\nNational Citizens Committee for Broadcasting (1978). The\ncourt, however, held the validity of the challenged regula-\ntions, accepting the difficulty of defining and measuring\nconceded that the rulemaking record was inconclusive in\nestablishing the connection between ownership limits and\nviewpoint diversity, the court recognized the need\nfor qualitative judgment on defining an elusive concept of\nviewpoint diversity. Nevertheless, the court began to take\nseriously the connection between them in the Prometheus\nRadio Project v. FCC, in which the court criticized the FCC's\nuse of the DI to measure viewpoint diversity, and remanded\nit (Dissent by Chef Judge Scirica).\nFin/syn rules: Source and program/viewpoint diversity.The\nFCC's ownership regulation to ensure content diversity is\nalso concerned with the ownership of program producers\n(i.e., source diversity). Based on the belief that increasing\nindependent program suppliers furthers program and view-\npoint diversity, the FCC imposed Financial Interest and Syn-\ndication rules (fin/syn). The fin/syn rules were originally\nadopted in 1970 to restrict the three established networks\n(ABC, CBS, and NBC) from owning monetary rights in syn-\ndicated programs while encouraging the bargaining power\nand profitability of independent program suppliers (see\nReview of the Syndication and Financial Interest Rules,\nthe fin-syn rules is to limit the networks' control over televi-\nsion programming and thereby encourage the development\nof a diversity program through diverse and antagonistic\nsources of program services (Review of the Syndication and\nNotably, the rules have received substantial criticism.\nAlong with changes in the media market, the networks,\nrestricted from the syndication market, seemed unable to\ncompete with the cable and video companies in terms of the\nprice offered. The independent producers have tended to pur-\nchase inexpensive products from domestic syndicators rather\nthan producing innovative and diverse television content. As\na result, in 1983, the FCC proposed eliminating much of the\nfin/syn rules fueled by a deregulation climate. In 1991, after\nreceiving extensive comments and conducting a hearing, the\nFCC relaxed certain aspects of the fin/syn, yet retained the\nrevised fin/syn rules. On appeal, however, the 1991 decision\nwas overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the\nSeventh Circuit due to the failure of proving the nexus\nbetween the modified rules and diversity goals (Review of\nthe Syndication and Financial Interest Rules, 1995). In\nSchurz Communications, Incorporated v. FCC (1992), Judge\nPosner criticized the logic of the public interest built on the\nFCC's long-standing economic antitrust foreclosures applied\nfor enhancing diversity, and struck down the revised fin/syn\nrules.\nEEO rules: Workforce diversity and viewpoint diversity.The\nEqual Employment of Opportunity rules (EEO) are an obvi-\nous example of the FCC's effort to create diverse viewpoints\nor programming through the ownership of the workforce\nwithin the distribution system. The EEO rules were designed\nto ensure that minority groups (racial, ethnicity, and gender\nbased) have a fair chance of being employed in electronic\nmedia services to foster diversity in programming. Yet, in\n6 SAGE Open\nLutheran Church-Missouri Synod v. FCC (1998) the D.C.\nCircuit court criticized the FCC's logic of formulating the\nrace-based rules, and rejected the FCC's ruling against the\nchurch. According to the court, the FCC did not clarify what\nexactly constitutes diversity of programming, and thus failed\nto establish a connection between the minority ownership\nand viewpoint diversity.\nOutcomes: Court Decisions\nand First Amendment Values\nScarcity Rationale: Constraint on Media\nVoices for Socially Desirable Media Content\nThe legal question, raised by the court challenges, involves\nthe validity of the primary justification for media regula-\ntions, which lends itself to different applications of First\nAmendment values to the diversity policy. It addresses the\nsignificant challenges in regulatory justification for achiev-\ning diversity goals. The scarcity rationale is the primarily\nlegal justification for broadcast regulations, allowing gov-\nernment intervention to promote the FirstAmendment values\nfor the public (see Krattenmaker & Powe, 1999; Spitzer\n1989). The court imposed a legal presumption of distinctive\ntreatments for different communications media for First\nimpact of the media content.\" Democracy (i.e., diversity) is,\nthus, achieved through an adoption of the legal framework\nbased on the normative principle that demands diverse pro-\ngramming or \"socially desirable content,\" equally applicable\nto all \"citizens.\"\nHowever, the constitutional significance of the scarcity\nrationale was widely attacked during the convergence era\nthat legitimatized deregulation policy. The blurring media\nservices, due to technological innovation and digitalization,\ngoes beyond the ability of the broadcast model that is con-\nfined to single media legislation. In this way, it seems impos-\nsible for the Supreme Court to apply a distinctive legal\nframework to First Amendment issues, evidenced when the\nSupreme Court expressed doubts about continued reliance\non scarcity, and the minimal control of government over\nbroadcast programming in Turner Broadcasting v. FCC\n(1994). Consequently, the diversity goals envisioning social\nvalues and deliberative democracy, enforced within broad-\ncasting, have been greatly undermined.\nThe Marketplace of Ideas: Constraint on\nGovernment Actions for a Robust Competition\nWhile the changing media landscape eliminated much of the\nscarcity in broadcast regulations, the marketplace of ideas\nhas been a prominent guiding metaphor for ownership deci-\nsions. It has been primarily used for justifying economic\nantitrust laws, drawn upon the value of efficient market,\nresponsive to the public needs. Democracy is thus achieved\nthrough the First Amendment purpose that protects a robust\ncompetition of multitude of media voices against the govern-\nment intervention, which in turn meets the public needs.\nNevertheless, the courts threw the validity of the market-\nplace of ideas into doubt, calling into question a mere eco-\nnomic authorship over media structure with little regard to its\nconnection to democratic values of content diversity, particu-\nlarly viewpoint diversity (e.g., Schurz, Lutheran Church,\nTime Warner, and Prometheus cases). With an undercurrent\nof the demand for substantial proof to justify ownership\nrules, the courts discredited the marketplace of ideas. The\nquestion raised about the continued validity of the regulatory\njustifications addresses the critical demands for reframing\nthe existing policy framework for an adequate implementa-\ntion of the policy.\nAssessment of Policy: Reviews and\nRegulatory Challenges\nallows the Commission to periodically review its ownership\nrules (except the national television ownership limit) and\ndetermine whether any of such rules are necessary in the\npublic interest as the result of competition (Report and Order\nimportant policy issues of (a) the deregulatory climate gov-\nerning the marketplace ideas, (b) the challenges in defining\nregulatory concepts in terms of competition, diversity, and\nlocalism, and (c) the limitation of the entire range of existing\neconomic regulation to further diversity.\nDeregulation Policy and Value of Monopoly\n2010 Quadrennial Review Orders reflect their profound con-\nsideration of diversity at the local level or localism, and the\nincreased provision of the benefits of common ownership. In\n2002 Biennial Review and Order, the Commission signifi-\ncantly relaxed the cross-ownership limits with an adoption of\nthe cross-media limits, derived from the Diversity Index\n(DI). In completing the 2006 Quadrennial Regulatory\nReview, the FCC further relaxed the 32-year-old ban on\nnewspaper/broadcast ownership rules within the television\nmarket (Report and Order and Order on Reconsideration,\n2008). The rules ban not only certain newspaper/broadcast\ncross-ownership combinations in the top 20 markets, but\ngenerally will apply to all other markets (Report and Order\nOrders, are based on the FCC's belief that the cross-ownership\nactually produces localism rather than harms competition; the\nnewspaper-owned television stations tend to produce local\nnews and public affairs programming (Report and Order and\nconsideration of the benefits of common ownership is also\nbased on the assumption that the technological advancements\nsupport the operation of mainstream media companies deliv-\nering news and information to their local communicates (see\nReport and Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 2003;\nReport and Order and Order on Reconsideration, 2008). The\ngrowing number of media outlets for news and information,\nand entertainment today provides more choices via nontradi-\ntional modes of media, such as cable, satellite television, digi-\ntal transmission, and the Internet (Report and Order and\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking, 2003; Report and Order and\nThe FCC's significant liberalization of the media owner-\nship was not a simple modification of the rules, but rather a\nsignificant change in media structure, which allows substan-\ntial concentration in the national and local television markets.\nThe ownership decisions encompass the benefits of a free\nmarket, provisioned by values of monopoly in creating mul-\ntiple media outlets or voices for consumers. In fact, the sig-\nnificant teleological advancements have fully developed\neconomic sectors around electronic media and telecommuni-\ncations since the 1970s, leading to vertical integration of the\npreviously separated communication industry, known as con-\n2006). With increased provisions of economic viability of\ncommunication services, the value of monopoly has been\nreconsidered. The market liberalists and economists advanced\nthe benefit of monopoly and contrived competition among\ncorporate media, necessary for increasing national compati-\nbility within globalized market.\nNevertheless, the commonly expressed concern raised by\ncritics indicates a gradual decline of the public accountability\nof media and rational debates among citizens (see Miller,\n2011).Today's highly competitive media system with increased\nnews outlets hasn't yielded a sufficient amount of public issues\nmajor caveats is that more outlets produced by new media do\nnot necessarily offer new media content when \"broadcast TV\nprograms are recycled for cable channels, and newspaper and\ncable news content is repackaged for the internet, and so on.\"\n(Croteau, D. Federal Communications Commission Broadcast\nOwnership En Banc. Virginia, 27 February 2003. http://transi-\nRelevant research also indicated that media diversity has\ndeclined where scarcity has been more present after the pas-\nsage of the Telecommunication act of 1996, in broadcasting\ndecline of space for new programs and for public services and\nthe creation of polarized online discussions were also true in\nspite of a multichannel environment (see Campbell, Martin, &\nDefining Regulatory Concepts\nIn the 1998 Biennial Review, the cross-ownership limits of\ncable and broadcasting were vacated by the D.C. Circuit due\nto the FCC's inability to precisely define what constitutes a\nvoice for diversity. For the constitutionality of the proposed\nownership rules, the Commission used the DI (Report and\nOrder and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 2003) to mea-\nsure viewpoint diversity at the local market. The DI was\ndesigned to measure viewpoint diversity by giving insight\ninto consumers'reported preferences for their media sources\nof information and news (see Prometheus). It weighs the\nmarket share of various media outlets in local media mar-\nkets for antitrust purposes. Nevertheless, the DI does not\ndirectly measure, nor sufficiently measure viewpoint diver-\nsity. With its economic scheme, it measures the number of\nparticipants rather than to coherently measure viewpoint\nthat DI is not clearly linked to viewpoint diversity, citing in\nits remands that the Commission irrationally assigned out-\nlets of the same media-type equal market shares, and incon-\nsistently derived the cross-media limits from its DI results\n(Prometheus).\nOn the issue remanded by the Third Court in Prometheus,\nthe FCC commissioned the empirical research, namely, the\nMedia Ownership Study that informed the 2006\nQuadrennial Review of the ownership policies. Yet, the\nbroad and inconsistent definition of local and localism ren-\nders contradictory results from the research, making its\napplication questionable. The definition of local identified\nby the FCC was based on a Designated Market Area\n(DMA) as determined by Nielsen Media Research, which\nhas boundaries of geographically distinctive television\nviewing areas. For example, the FCC's previous research\nconducted by Alexander and Brown (2004) established the\nnecessarily condition for measuring localism where view-\npoints or local stores take place within DMA. In contrast,\nunder the Media Ownership Study of 2006, localism does\nnot appear to be precisely delineated from DMA, expend-\ning from geographically bounded definition of local within\nstate to a broader one across state (e.g., Milyo, 2007).\nFurthermore, a broad definition of localism resulted in\ninconsistency in defining the local content and news.\nAccording to the FCC, localism is broadly defined as the\nlevel of responsiveness of a station to the needs of its local\ncommunities and local news and quality. Given such a def-\ninition, any story would be considered a local content. The\ninconsistency of defining local content is apparent when\nMilyo's (2007) study included sports and weather in the\ncomponent of local news, which has been excluded in the\nFCC's previous research (e.g., Alexander & Brown, 2004).\nOf course, a broad definition of local and localism inevita-\nbly overestimates the local content. More importantly,\nwhat makes the FCC's research unsustainable is that only\na few studies respond to the intention of the court's demand\nfor precisely defining viewpoint diversity. For instance,\nMilyo's (2007) study appears to be the only one perform-\ning content analysis that directly measures local content\nand the political slant of local television news among the\nothers of the Media Ownership Study.\n8 SAGE Open\nLimitation of Economic\nRegulation for Democratic Values\nThe use of the DI to measure viewpoint diversity and incon-\nsistency of measuring localism indicate the FCC's inability\nor unwillingness to define viewpoint diversity. It also\nexplains the FCC's assumption that viewpoint diversity\ncould be empirically established by a justification for eco-\nnomic effects-based competition policy. Approached empir-\nically though, the existing economic analysis is not effective\nto measure political or democratic values of viewpoint\ndiversity. As Baker (2009) noted, the problem with view-\npoint measurement is its reliance on what is easy to measure\nrather than what is important. Similarly, Entman and\nWildman (1992) argued that democratic values of media\ndiversity do not seem to render economic analysis. Along\nwith scholarly criticism, growing judicial skepticism about\nviewpoint diversity clearly points out an inclusiveness of\nthe entire range of the existing economic regulations to fur-\nther democratic values of diversity. In retrospect, the FCC\nwould continually confront difficulty in making its regula-\ntion constitutional in the future unless it provides substantial\nempirical backing for the presumption that diversity of own-\nership is an essential proxy for content diversity or view-\npoint diversity.\nRevision\nPolicy Objectives: Government\nResponsiveness to the Major Problem\nThe policy analysis in the previous sections addresses\ninsufficient government responsiveness to the major prob-\nlem with the unpredictable impact of a new media land-\nscape on the marketplace. Instead of balancing the\npotentially negative effect of ownership concentration on\ndiversity against the economic viability of struggling media\noutlets, the policy tends to leave out the democratic value\nof diversity, insofar as the assessment of diversity has relied\non the economic impact of the marketplace. In opposition\nto the democratic purpose of antitrust law, its economic\nanalysis has provided justification for significant relaxation\nof ownership. Although the First Amendment principles for\nunprecedented media convergence inherently value the lib-\neralization of ownership undermining the traditional regu-\nlatory rationale, it is important to recognize the courts'\nshifting concern from the structure of the communication\nmarket to the content of communication, and government is\nresponsible to that content contributing to democracy (see\nKrattenmaker & Powe, 1995). With this regard, two possi-\nble responses the FCC could make to the given regulatory\nchallenges are (a) developing a more sophisticated and rig-\norous measure of viewpoint diversity, aimed at democratic\nvalues, and (b) diversity of ownership as a separate political\ngoal from viewpoint diversity.\nMetrics of Viewpoint Diversity: Input of\nCommunication Research Into the Policy\nThe regulatory challenges address the need for empirical evi-\ndence about viewpoint diversity, yet existing quantifiable\nmeasures lack in accounting variables that influence out-\ncomes of viewpoint diversity. More critically, a substantial\neffort to increase analytical resources has been degraded in\nspite of increasingly evidence-driven policymaking\ndemanded by current law (see Napoli, 2008). The perceived\ngap between the FCC's rationale for economic regulations\nand judicial interpretation of First Amendment values of\ndiversity addresses the need for a collaborate effort of poli-\ncymakers, legal, and communication scholars in answering\nthe constitutional questions and capitalizing the norms for an\nempirical assessment of diversity. Indeed, the input of com-\nmunication research into the policymaking is valuable in\nresponding to the courts' increased requirement for convinc-\ning empirical justification for viewpoint diversity. A number\nof scholars provide the value of communication research that\nprovides informational inputs to policymaking (e.g., Braman,\nTo develop a more sophisticated and meaningful metrics\nof viewpoint diversity, diversity inquires should entail the\ncomplementary functions of (a) deliberative democracy that\nensures substantive ideas and information for cultivating\ninformed citizenry and (b) participatory democracy that\nencourages citizens' engagement in the democratic process.\nThe norms for assessing viewpoint diversity thus encompass\nthe inquiry into how media democratic system affects\ninformed citizenry, and in turn how citizens' widespread\nhabit of media use affects their democratic decisions. Such\nmetrics of viewpoint should be drawn from a collective\nunderstanding of normative and empirical inferences devel-\noped and contextualized within and across economic and\nsocial disciplines that propose reasons for value-laden\ninquires as well as statistical analysis, respectively.\nNormative and Empirical Inferences\nUnlike the critical social approach that challenges the uncriti-\ncal acceptance of empirical findings and proposes an unquan-\ntifiable nature of social values with its normative approach,\nsocial scientists have empirically or statistically measured\n\"social values\" with its positive approach. Inversely, statisti-\ncal analysis quantified by the market economics is not neces-\nsarily drawn from positive inferences, as its conceptual root is\ngrounded in Marxist's critical perspective that proposes nor-\nmative social justice based on class analysis. Moreover, con-\ntemporary economic approaches have imposed a critical role\nof government to attain the desired democratic needs, which\nis opposed to the classical market approach (see Van\nCuilenburg & McQuail, 2003). Understanding such complex-\nity of theoretical and methodological propositions in terms of\ndemocracy, developed within and across the social and\neconomic field, is important to avoid theoretical schism and\nideological conflict that often hinders developing a compre-\nhensive and schematic assessment of diversity. In other\nwords, two democratic values of diversity, such as delibera-\ntive and participatory democracy, should be explained from\nthe interdisciplinary interplay between normative and empiri-\ncal inquires developed across a variety of disciplines without\ngeneralization of each approach.\nDeliberative democracy: Political diversity reflected in media\ncontent.The FCC's definition of viewpoint diversity and\nvarious approaches to it have involved these two democratic\nvalues stated above. Traditionally, as reflected in Red Lion,\nand enforced through the fairness doctrine, viewpoint diver-\nsity would measure \"political endorsement.\" Later, as stated\nby Hundt (1996), the measure of viewpoint diversity involves\n\"editorial perspective\" or editorial content. Most recently,\nthe FCC in the 2003 Report and Order states that viewpoint\ndiversity is most easily measured through \"news and public\naffairs programming,\" concerning political ideas and infor-\nmation necessary to guide the cultivation of rational delib-\neration between citizens. These tell that the norms of\nviewpoint diversity underline deliberative democratic values\nrepresented in media content, which affects the robustness of\ndemocratic participation of citizens by increasing political\nknowledge or ideological viewpoints. Under this direction,\nmany researchers have developed variables relevant to polit-\nical endorsement, and editorial perspectives and positions in\nnews and public affairs programming in measuring view-\nvariables that involve such deliberative democratic values of\nviewpoint diversity are\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Newspaper or broadcast content based on political\nendorsements\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Counts of time and space allotted to political candi-\ndates in broadcast.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Political content (liberal vs. conservative positions) of\nnews articles offered by newspaper editors and\nbroadcasters\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Word frequencies in editorials and news article\nViewpoint diversity reflecting deliberative democracy is\ncritical to cultivate well-informed citizenry; thus, their par-\nticipation in democracy is accountable. The scholarly criti-\ncism questioning the reliability of viewpoint diversity stems\nfrom the deficiency of critical social values of deliberative\ndemocracy in its measurement, which is closely linked to the\nmethodological flaw of the DI that measured the number of\nparticipants in a market (number of media outlet) rather than\nsubstantive viewpoints. Continual efforts in capitalizing and\nadvancing norms for deliberative democratic values of view-\npoint diversity are critical to empirically assessing the social\nbenefits of media content.\nParticipatory democratic values: Survey of citizens and use of\nmedia. Viewpoint diversity extends its definition to partici-\npatory democracy that accentuates the citizens' participation\nin their democratic public life. Technological advances have\ngreatly increased citizens' active participation in public\nissues and democratic decisions through an interactive\nmedium, namely, the Internet. The emphasis of participatory\ndemocratic values of viewpoint diversity inherently involves\naudience research, such as surveying citizens or ethnographic\ninquiries into citizen's information processing through vari-\nous mediums. The norms for viewpoint diversity in this\napproach involve access for civic engagement in democratic\ndecision via news and information served by various media\nThe citizens'right to receive a diverse range of ideas through\nguaranteed access has been understood as a more encom-\npassing notion of the freedom of communication system and\nis a central principle of diversity.\nIt is, however, important to note that the market approach\nto participatory democracy has measured viewpoint diver-\nsity based on media reflection of public demands with little\nregard to how their demands fulfill democratic ideals.\nHowever, the public demands are not necessarily equiva-\nlent to the public needs in their democratic decisions.\nEmphasized earlier, the literature supports that audiences'\ndemands are popular rather than intellectually diverse.\nThus, measuring political dimension of viewpoint diversity\nin participatory democracy should entail the inquiry into\nwhether citizens' response to or use of media information\n(i.e., citizens' participation) through various mediums (i.e.,\naccess offered by media outlets) affects their public or dem-\nocratic decisions. Considerable research in the communica-\ntion field has addressed this diversity inquiry (e.g., Braman,\nables that potentially measure such participatory demo-\ncratic function are\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Citizen's public competence or knowledge that affects\ncivic engagement in political issue and public\ndecision\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Citizens' education level that affects information pro-\ncessing in terms of political issue\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Cultural or demographic aspect, including racial, gen-\nder, and age background that affect their participation\nin political issue and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How these variables affect their particular use of\nmediums and its relevance to democratic decisions.\nDiversity of Ownership as a\nSeparate Goal From Viewpoint Diversity\nDeveloping objective and meaningful metrics of viewpoint\ndiversity is necessary and should be a primary goal in aca-\ndemic research because such an effort has its own\nintellectual rigor. But, particularly, in times of increased\njudicial skepticism about viewpoint diversity and empirical\njustifications for regulations, the FCC inevitably faces\nmethodological challenges. Even if more rigorous and\nadvanced methodologies of viewpoint are developed within\nand across various disciplines, ongoing debate on its con-\nceptual elusiveness and subjectivity is more likely to exist\nas a result of the contradictory effects of the economic anti-\ntrust law on diversity. Dealing in a practical manner, there\nseems no greater chance that the FCC would satisfy the\ncourt's critical demand for objective and scientific proof for\nestablishing the connection between ownership diversity\nand viewpoint diversity, thereby continually hindering the\ngovernment responsiveness to media's democratic perfor-\nmance. If this is the case, an alternative way of countering\nsuch struggle in regulations is setting diversity of ownership\nas a separate goal from viewpoint diversity. Put differently,\nthe FCC may simply make ownership diversity by itself as a\npolitical goal (consideration reflected in the 2002 Biennial\nReview). Enforcement of antitrust law, in this way, is pre-\nserving democratic values of not content diversity but own-\nership diversity in a First Amendment principle.\nThe proposition of decentralizing ownership is not a new\nconcern. Grounded in normative concern, numerous media\nscholars have addressed the danger of ownership concentra-\nreform of media structure to affirm the democratic function\nof media. He argues that concentrated corporate control is\ndetrimental to any notion of participatory democracy, yet the\nFirst Amendment has provided an exclusive shield for corpo-\naddressed the potential danger of corporate media power that\nundermined democracies deemed in the public interest, thus\nthe relaxation of ownership would reduce diversity in terms\nof quantity and quality. Baker (2009) also provided reasons\nfor decentralized ownership regardless of the contradictory\neffect of antitrust law on viewpoint diversity. The commonly\nexpressed concerns, addressed by these scholars are that con-\ncentration of ownership\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 would reduce quality diversity, journalism, cultural\npluralism in commercial media content;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 would hinder informed public participation or distri-\nbution of citizens' voices with the democratic public\nsphere;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 would undermine democratic value of egalitarian\npremise in sharing political power;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 would lead to demagogic political power, failing to\nserve watchdog function.\nImplementing diversity of ownership as a separate politi-\ncal goal from viewpoint diversity would avoid burdensome\nscrutiny as a result of its content neutral restriction. This\napproach, while encouraging government responsiveness to\nmedia democracy, may also be less competing against the\ncourts' interpretation of the First Amendment values than\napproving its connection to viewpoint diversity.\nConclusion\nMedia diversity is central to democracy, through which the\nFirst Amendment is expressed and promoted by specific pol-\nicies. In the goal of greater precision of the diversity princi-\nples, and of implications and decisions of the diversity policy,\nthis article proposed an alternative policy model, acknowl-\nedging the social, economic, and political schisms in fulfill-\ning the goal of media diversity. The policy model attempted\nto establish the policy objective, that is, creating pluralism of\noutlets, ownership, and choices of people to serve democ-\nracy, such as diversity of media content to cultivate citizen-\nship. The predicable connection between pluralism and\ndiversity, in this way, should not be overlooked. The theoreti-\ncal underpinning of media diversity proposed in the article\nentailed the wider intellectual frames consistent to the public\ninterest. With the analysis of the integrative function of mar-\nket economics and social values of media diversity and desir-\nable outcomes on their own, it attempted to avoid\noversimplification of complexities existing in the concept of\nmedia diversity. Clearly while the empirical analysis of the\neconomic approach can be appropriate to measuring the plu-\nralistic value of competition, the critical analysis of the social\napproach is equally important to assess the democratic value\nof media content that can cultivate intellectual activity and\npolitically informed public body.\nThe application of diversity policy involves judicial deci-\nsions about the constitutionality of proposed rules and regu-\nlations. The clarification of regulatory concepts of media\ndiversity was attempted to understand the FCC's logic to jus-\ntify the public interest for preserving the competition of out-\nlets and ownership, and diversity of content (i.e., viewpoint\ndiversity). The major regulatory challenge the FCC has faced\nwas the failure to establish the substantial connection\nbetween competition and diversity closely connected to\nlocalism. The improvement of the FCC's use of the DI to\nmeasure viewpoint diversity is thus critical to justify the pub-\nlic interest rationale. Two regulatory justifications histori-\ncally used for achieving diversity goals were the scarcity\nrationale and the marketplace of ideas, each of which renders\ndifferent applications of legal framework to FirstAmendment\nissues. The shift from the scarcity rationale to the market-\nplace ideas due to the changing media landscape conse-\nquently undermined social values of media content while\njustifying economic antitrust laws designed to protect own-\nership competition. Hence, the continued validity of the mar-\nketplace of idea for promoting viewpoint diversity is largely\nquestionable.\nThe critical analysis of the FCC's periodical review of the\nownership rules and regulations raised important policy\nissues, such as the continual decline of media diversity fueled\nby deregulation, the challenges in defining regulatory\nconcepts, left poorly defined, and the limitation of an entire\nrange of existing economic regulations for promoting demo-\ncratic values of viewpoint diversity. The potential revision of\nthe existing policies precisely responding to these problems\nis a key factor in effective policymaking. For that reason, the\narticle suggested developing a rigorous assessment for mea-\nsuring viewpoint diversity strengthened by entailing the\ncomplementary function of deliberative and participatory\ndemocracy to ensure substantive and critical content for\nrational deliberation, public participation, and citizen\nempowerment rather than diversity policies serving as mere\nrhetorical tools for justifying market motivation of corporate\nmedia. With the increased attention to the current media\nownership, which is heavily concentrated, the article finally\nsuggested implementing diversity ownership as a separate\npolitical goal from viewpoint diversity. This attempt may\neschew the recurring problem of equating competition of\nownership with diversity of media content.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAlexander, P.
