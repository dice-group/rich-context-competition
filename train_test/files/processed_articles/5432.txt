    "abstract": "Abstract\nNurses are pivotal to an effective societal response to a range of critical events, including disasters. This presents nurses\nwith many significant and complex challenges that require them to function effectively under highly challenging and stressful\ncircumstances and often for prolonged periods of time. The exponential growth in the number of disasters means that\nknowledge of disaster preparedness and how this knowledge can be implemented to facilitate the development of resilient\nand adaptive nurses and health care organizations represents an important adjunct to nurse education, policy development,\nand research considerations. Although this topic has and continues to attract attention in the literature, a lack of systematic\nunderstanding of the contingencies makes it difficult to clearly differentiate what is known and what gaps remain in this\nliterature. Providing a sound footing for future research can be facilitated by first systematically reviewing the relevant\nliterature. Focused themes were identified and analyzed using an ecological and interactive systems framework. Ten of the 12\nretained studies included evacuation, revealing that evacuation is more likely to occur in an aged care facility than a hospital.\nThe unpredictability of an event also highlighted organizational, functional, and competency issues in regard to the complexity\nof decision making and overall preparedness. The integrative review also identified that the unique roles, competencies, and\ndemands on nurses working in hospitals and residential health care facilities during a natural disaster appear invisible within\nthe highly visible event.\n",

History has already\nprovided examples of what can happen to a community in the\nevent of a large-scale natural disaster. Factors such as popula-\ntion growth and urban development are increasing the risk\nfaced by populations worldwide. Climate change will increase\nthe incidence, duration, and severity of hazards of meteoro-\nlogical origin. The risk of disaster and thus the human conse-\nquences is increasing. When disaster strikes, health care\norganizations, and particularly their nursing and medical staff,\nare a critical element in any disaster response. They provide an\nessential service to any community, and hospitals and emer-\ngency departments (EDs) are often the first place of call for\npeople affected by any type of emergency. The nursing work-\nforce makes up a large part of any health care facility and orga-\nnization, and is expected to be able to adapt and function\ncompetently. In addition, nurses may have to adapt at a\nmoment's notice to events that occur with little or no warning,\nand they may be called upon to function effectively in chal-\nlenging circumstances for periods of weeks or months and in\ncontexts where their own community has been affected. The\nnature, extent, and speed of recovery in areas impacted by\nadverse events such as natural disasters is thus influenced by\nthe adaptive capacity and resilience of nurses and the health\ncare organizations they represent.\nThe aim of the integrative review was to provide an\nevidence-based approach and re-conceptualization of ideas\nand recommendations for natural disaster preparation, pre-\nparedness, and competencies for nurses using an ecological\n1University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Australia\n2University of Tasmania, Launceston, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nGillian C.

Specifically, the review focused on primary research that\nreported on large-scale natural disasters that involved nurses\nworking within residential health care facilities such as hospi-\ntals and nursing homes. It examined lessons learned in relation\nto roles, interrelationships, and activities; knowledge, skills,\nand competencies; and processes and procedures that may\nincrease the potential for preparedness, adaptation, and resil-\nience. By integrating and synthesizing the empirical literature\nof past natural disasters, it further clarifies what is already\nknown, identifies gaps, and provides direction for future\nresearch in disaster management processes and preparedness\nfor nurses.\nHazard events can be natural (e.g., the result of an eco-\nlogical disruption such as cyclones, floods, pandemics, wild-\nfires, earthquakes, and tornadoes) or man-made (e.g., acts of\nterrorism). The capacity to respond determines whether an\nadverse hazard event will be an emergency or develop into a\ndisaster (Pan American Health Organization, 2008). One\ncharacteristic people, organizations, and societies have that\ninfluences whether a hazard event becomes a disaster is their\nintrinsic resilience (Paton & Johnston, 2006).\nResilience can be defined as an ability to be prepared and\nhave the capacity to \"spring back from\" (United Nations\nInternational Strategy for Disaster Reduction [UNISDR],\n2009) an adverse event, a disaster--natural or man-made. It\nis also defined as the ability to withstand, recover from, and\nthrive after a disaster (Smith, 2012). This concept has also\nbeen linked to the adaptive capacity of individuals (Norris,\nStevens, Pfefferbaum, Wyche, & Pfefferbaum, 2008).\nAdaptive capacity is described as the individual's or the\ncommunity's ability to cope with, adapt to, and develop from\nthe demands, challenges, and changes encountered during\nand after disaster (Paton & Johnston, 2006; Paton & Violanti,\ncomplex nature of the disaster response context makes being\nable to adapt to dynamic, emergent issues over time as par-\nticularly important in disaster recovery context (Paton &\nMost health care facilities and staff are educated and pre-\npared to deal with any type and size of emergency event or\nsmall-scale disaster, and although it may stretch resources,\nprocedures and processes are generally in place to respond\nand address the situation (L. M. Brown, Hickling, & Frahm,\n2010). A large-scale natural disaster, however, is a cata-\nstrophic event that is greater than any extraordinary emer-\ngency (L. M. Brown, Hickling, & Frahm, 2010; P. R. Brown\net al., 2010), is often unforeseen, and will be affected by seri-\nous disruption to essential services such as electricity, water,\nand sanitation (Quarantelli, 1997). The facility itself may\nhave to function in complete isolation or may have incurred\nstructural damage, and staff and patients within may have\nbeen injured or killed (Priest & Bahl, 2008).\nConsideration needs to be given to whether or not the\nsame planning that has gone into emergency preparedness\nexists for what could be seen as an extraordinarily unlikely\nevent. How will nursing and health care personnel continue\nto deliver a health care service at an optimal level during and\nimmediately after a large-scale natural disaster, especially if\naccess to services and technology is compromised, and they\nhave to deal with evolving demands over prolonged periods\nof time?\nIntegrative Review\nIntegrative reviews may address either a mature or a new and\nemerging issue (Torraco, 2005). A mature, well-developed\nsubject produces a plethora of literature with diverse opinion\nand research methodologies. Disaster management is both\nlarge and complex and continues to grow and contribute to\nthe body of knowledge on preparedness recommendations\nand the development of resilient and adaptive organizations.\nA large proportion of international nursing literature avail-\nable on this subject, however, is experiential, based on per-\nsonal opinion and not evidence based. The strength and\ndebatably a weakness of a review of this type is that it allows\nfor the integration and synthesis of a wide range of literature\nand research methodologies (Torraco, 2005; Whittemore &\nKnafl, 2005). Rigorous synthesis and critique of information\ngathered can, however, further contribute to theory, practice,\nand policy development (Whittemore & Knafl, 2005).\nSearch Method\nPrimary searches focused on electronic databases commonly\nused for storing medical and nursing-related literature such\nas Medline & Psych Info, CINAHL, Proquest Central.\nSecondary hand searching of reference lists of relevantly\nsourced articles was also undertaken (Figure 1). Key search\nterms included derivations of Nurs*.mp, disaster, natural\ndisaster*.tw, catastroph*.tw, hospital, hospitalization, aged\ncare facility, preparedness, resilience, lessons learned*\n[learnt]. Boolean terms of and/or were also used to incorpo-\nrate further search terms such as knowledge, skills, compe-\ntencies, roles, decisions, and recommendations.\nThis search included original primary research data (i.e.,\ninformation derived from field studies using either quantita-\ntive or qualitative research methodology), from peer-\nreviewed, scholarly journals, English language only, and\nerature gained from secondary sources, such as, policies and\norganizationally produced documents) and conference pro-\nceedings were not included in the search. Also excluded was\nliterature pertaining to pre-hospital or non-residential activi-\nties, volunteering outside of the nurses' own country or\nhealth care facility.\nWhen articles were assessed for inclusion, the terms natu-\nral disaster or catastrophe, included extreme weather events\n(such as hurricanes, cyclones, big storms, or tornadoes), seis-\nmic events (such as earthquakes and volcanic activity), and\ngeneral critical events due to a natural disaster that may\nScrymgeour et al. 3\ncause surge capacity to an institution (such as evacuations).\nReference to man-made, biological, epidemic, or terrorist\ndisasters was excluded.\nTheoretical Underpinnings to Data\nAnalysis\nContent and thematic analysis was used to collate and inter-\npret the data from the integrative review. An ecological/inter-\nacting systems framework was used to guide and help\nprovide fresh interpretation to the data. Researchers have\nused an interactive systems approach to explore, understand,\nand analyze the effects of a disaster on individuals, commu-\nnities, systems, and organizations. Hoffman and Kruczek\n(2011) used a bioecological model to review the literature on\nmass traumas caused by large-scale disasters and commu-\nnity-wide catastrophes. They believe that these events can be\nbetter understood by using an \"ecosystemic model\" (Hoffman\neffects on individuals and communities. Their bioecological\nmodel of mass trauma was based on Bronfenbrenner's bio-\necological model of human development which was, up until\nhis death, continually evolving and is defined as \"the phe-\nnomenon of continuity and change in the biopsychological\ncharacteristics of human beings, both as individuals and as\nHoffman and Kruczek (2011) believed that an individual\nis affected by interactions among systems that provide social\ncontext and determines the impacts of events. Paton and\nJohnston and Norris et al. echoed this and developed multi-\nlevel, interdependent models of disaster resilience (Norris\n(1979) original ecological theory, the interdependent struc-\ntures or nested systems have various levels: microsystem,\nmesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem. Hoffman and\nKruczec have focused on Bronfenbrenner and Ceci's\nexpanded model in 1994 that included the addition of a bio-\nlogical element known as chronosystems (Hoffman &\nKruczek, 2011). This process refers to life changes that occur\nover time that are dependent on changes to the environment,\nwhich is also viewed as important to accommodate the tem-\nporal dimension of disaster response (Paton, Johnston,\nMamula-Seadon, & Kenney, 2014). Critical distinctions\nwere also made between the proximal processes of environ-\nment and process, and are seen by Bronfenbrenner to be\ninterdependent and bidirectional (Bronfenbrenner & Morris,\nThe bioecological theory was also used by Boon, Cottrell,\nKing, Stevenson, and Millar (2012) to develop a tool to\nmodel and assess community resilience at an individual and\ncommunity level to natural disasters. These authors used\ntheir framework to hypothetically test an Australian commu-\nnity to the effects of a disaster. Their application was not con-\ntext specific as it was derived from prior studies on disaster\nresilience. They used data from actual events that occurred in\nBeechworth, Victoria, and Innisfail and Ingham, Queensland,\nas a proxy measure to develop and illustrate their model of\npossible issues and resilience indicators. The authors believe\nthat Bronfenbrenner's bioecological theory is useful to help\ncollate, interpret, and triangulate findings from multi-method\nstudies on disaster resilience (Boon et al., 2012).\nPaton and Violanti's theory of ecological resilience and\nmodel of adaptive capacity (Paton & Violanti, 2011) have\nsome similarities to Bronfenbrenner's descriptive model but\nhave been operationalized within a disaster context. Paton\nand Violanti's model of adaptive capacity was originally\ndeveloped from empowerment theory, a construct often used\nin management and organizational contexts, which includes\ncomponents of meaningfulness, competence, choice, and\nperceived control. This theory, according to Paton (personal\nstarting point\" when conceptualizing and analyzing adaptive\ncapacity within an organization because it highlights the\nneed to accommodate the interdependence between empow-\nered people and empowered settings. This makes it a useful\nconceptual framework for the multi-level analysis of pro-\ncesses that operate under conditions of uncertainty (which is\nFigure 1. Prisma diagram.\nSource. Adapted from Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman, and The PRISMA\n4 SAGE Open\npertinent with regard to the development of capability prior\nto events occurring). They also assert that when developing a\nmodel of adaptive capacity that facilitates resilience in high\nrisk professions, it is important to consider the interactions\nand relationships of person, team, and organization, and\nmost importantly family (Paton & Violanti, 2011). These\nauthors believe that these factors are interdependent and the\ncombination of which will affect the likelihood of adaptive\ncapacity and resilience in the individual.\nResults\nFrom the initial screening of 233 records, all 12 studies that\nmet all inclusion criteria for final analysis were undertaken\nin the United States. The type of disaster that affected their\nfacility were nine involving large-scale hurricanes, two\nfocused on a non-specified natural disaster event and one\nfollowing an earthquake. Two of the facilities studied were\nhospitals and 10 were aged care facilities such as nursing\nhomes or assisted living facilities. Only half of the studies\ndirectly interviewed nurses as a specific demographic. The\nrest included nurses as one of the members of the multi-\ndisciplinary team involved. Methodologies included five\nquantitative surveys, two mixed methods, and five qualita-\ntive surveys.\nContent within all the studies were initially examined and\ncoded manually into categories and analyzed with four pre-\ndetermined key outcome messages or main focus of each\nstudy in mind. The majority of the studies (n = 9) included\nthe key message of preparedness either with another cate-\ngory or on its own. Knowledge and skills, decision making,\nand resilience were only represented in three instances each,\neither on its own or with another category.\nThematic Analysis\nThe data were further coded initially into broad themes using\nNVivo9 software. All the 10 studies that involved nursing\nhomes included evacuation or sheltering in place as a key\ntheme. Focused themes were then identified and analyzed\nusing an ecological and interactive systems viewpoint as a\nbroad guide.\nDistributed Decision Making Is Fundamental\nThe majority of articles within this review discussed issues\npertaining to the facilities either considering or requiring\nevacuation or accepting evacuees. Multiple issues such as\nresourcing and adequate staffing, provision of care and\npatient safety, adequacy of shelter available, and transporta-\ntion need to be considered prior to making a decision on\nwhether to evacuate or shelter in place. This cannot be made\nwithout meticulous planning and expert decision making\nacross local agencies prior to an event, and should be\nreflected within the organization's disaster plan (Hyer,\nA successful outcome depended on developing prior rela-\ntionships with multiple agencies and organizations, which\nincluded well-coordinated and direct lines of communication\nwith emergency management organizations, the local com-\nmunity, and other health care facilities within the region.\nIntegrated emergency management processes were identified\nas lacking or below par. Many reported the need for improved\ncommunication with their emergency management and state\nregulatory agencies (Castro, Persson, Bergstrom, & Cron,\nwith some administrators feeling the pressure to evacuate,\nagainst their better judgment (Blanchard, 2009). Some felt\nabandoned by the state, alone in decision making, and over-\nall, nursing home residents did not seem to be a priority for\ndecisions on evacuation or ensuring essential supplies such\nas electricity to a facility if sheltering in place (Dosa,\nGrossman, Wetle, & Mor, 2007). Community assistance and\nother nursing facilities, however, were seen as helpful and a\ngreat support at critical times (Dosa et al., 2007; Laditka\nThe success of these decisions also depended on the cor-\nrect professional being involved at the initial planning phase\nas it requires specific expertise in choosing appropriate, safe,\nand fit-for-purpose emergency shelters, appropriate transpor-\ntation, and predicting for adequate supplies and resources.\nNurses, some holding leadership roles, who were involved in\nthe actual care of their patients during the disaster, were often\nexcluded in the initial planning and this was reflected in\nstudies where nurses discussed how their lack of input had a\ndirect effect on staff and patient safety and privacy, and was\na barrier to care (Christensen, Brown, & Hyer, 2012; Hyer\nbe summed up by the following statement by Christensen\nAlthough disaster nursing is tremendously challenging,\nregardless of whether staff shelters in place or evacuates, our\nstudy suggests that asking these critical questions before\nevacuating to a non-clinical facility can help reduce hazards to\nboth residents and staff. (p. 382)\nPersonal Exposure and Interconnections of the\nIndividual Influences the Functioning of the\nIndividual as a Professional\nThe unpredictability and past experiences of disasters and\npersonal worries of the potential impact of the disaster on\npatients, staff members, their families, pets, and houses\naffected the functional capacity and performance of staff\nwithin a facility. Facilities were understaffed due to absen-\n2004). One administrator reported that they had to \"mandate\nScrymgeour et al. 5\nall staff participate in evacuation\" (Hyer et al., 2009, p. e11),\nand employees were threatened with disciplinary action and\nsome were terminated if they did not turn up for work.\nWhereas, Castro et al. (2008) reported that allowing family\nmembers to evacuate with their staff members increased staff\ncoverage. This was also the case for some facilities that shel-\ntered in place, with one respondent claiming that they had\nmore staff than they needed (Hyer et al., 2009). Suggestions\nwere also made to consider increasing the level of supplies\nstockpiled from the standard guidelines of 3 days to at least a\nweek (Laditka et al., 2008) to cater for staff bringing their\nfamily members and pets with them.\nPhysical and mental exhaustion of staff and putting their\npatients and facility ahead of their family concerns were also\nissues raised (Laditka et al., 2009). A small pilot study of ED\nnurses by Battles (2007) highlighted the potential for post-\ntraumatic stress to affect their ability to adapt and respond\nboth personally and professionally during and after a disas-\nter, and may continue to have lasting effects on them.\nDirectors of nursing (DoNs) focus group participants in a\nstudy conducted by L. M. Brown, Hyer, Schinka, Mando,\nFrazier, & Polivka-West (2010) suggested that all direct care\nproviders should be trained in psychological first aid, which\ncould be provided following a disaster to meet the mental\nhealth needs of both patients and their staff member\ncolleagues.\nFunctional Capability and Adaptive Demands on\nNurses Often Hidden Within the Multidisciplinary\nand Inter-Agency Context of a Disaster\nIn most articles, nurses were included in the general descrip-\ntion of staff respondents. This included facility administra-\ntors; direct or non-direct care staff; allied staff such as social\nworkers, physiotherapists, and Occupational Therapists;\nancillary such as domestic, kitchen, or maintenance and\nother professionals identified as physicians and psycholo-\ngists. Most studies focused on the effect on the facility,\npatients, and staff as a whole, and administrators were identi-\nfied as their key respondents. Two identified specific inter-\nviews with DoNs (Christensen et al., 2012; Laditka et al.,\n2009) and two studies interviewed or included data from ED\nficult to clearly identify the unique roles, competencies, and\ndemands of nurses involved in a disaster. Only one study\n(Laditka et al., 2009) reported evidence of resilience in staff,\nand recommended this potential in staff warrants further\nstudy. Nursing resilience or adaptive capacity was not identi-\nfied or mentioned.\nSummary\nResults from the integrative review highlight that evacuation\nis more likely to occur in an aged care facility/nursing home\nthan a hospital. Ten of the 12 studies examined in the\nintegrative review included evacuation and decisions about\nevacuation or shelter in place as a key issue. A successful\noutcome for patients and staff following an evacuation\nrequires well-prepared employees who have undergone\ntraining/education, regular site visits, and spot drills.\nFacilities that incorporated the lessons learned from previous\ndisasters into their disaster plans found that it improved their\noverall level of preparedness and strengthened their commu-\nnication and collaboration with community and emergency\nmanagement authorities during the next disaster. Successful\ndecisions also depended on the correct professional being\ninvolved at the initial planning phase as it requires specific\nexpertise in choosing appropriate, safe, and fit-for-purpose\nemergency shelters, appropriate transportation, and predict-\ning for adequate supplies and resources.\nStaff workload increases during a disaster with lack of\nsleep and breaks a contributing factor to increasing stress. In\nsome cases, these increased levels of stress in staff caused a\ndesensitization to the distress in patients, and had the poten-\ntial to mask a mental health problem. Evacuated patients\nwere more likely to experience depression and anxiety. This\nalso contributed to increased staff workload with needing to\nspend more time providing emotional reassurance as well as\nproviding for their usual care requirements often under try-\ning circumstances due to lack of resources and normal ser-\nvices. A small pilot study of ED nurses highlighted the\npotential for posttraumatic stress to affect their ability to\nadapt and respond both personally and professionally during\nand after a disaster and may continue to have lasting effects\non them. Some studies reported, however, that many staff\nhad positive experiences and found that the events helped to\nbuild stronger relationships with their patients and other staff\nmembers. In most articles, nurses were included in the gen-\neral description of staff respondents. This made it difficult to\nclearly identify the unique roles, competencies, and demands\nof nurses involved in a disaster.\nDiscussion\nThe complexity of decision making is highlighted within this\nreview. The level of uncertainty is often exacerbated by the\ndynamic nature of a large-scale disaster. Decisions are dis-\ntributed over a range of people, teams, agencies, and organi-\nzations. This usually involves multiple decision makers with\nvarying levels of expertise, local knowledge, with varying\norganizational procedures and processes. This type of deci-\nsion making is referred to by Schneeweiss (2003b) as distrib-\nuted decision making where multiple decision makers are\nunited in a mutual problem or issue (Schneeweiss, 2003a).\nDecision-making strategies and coping with uncertainty and\nstress have been explored and analyzed extensively by many\nresearchers (Aldunate, Pena-Mora, & Robinson, 2005; Flin,\nSalas, Strub, & Martin, 1997; Gore, Banks, Millward, &\nadaptive decision making involves the person, teams, and\n6 SAGE Open\norganizations to be able to be open, flexible, and have com-\nmon situational awareness and a shared mental model of the\nproblem. This, in turn, contributes to resilient and adaptive\nteams and organizations (Serfaty & Entin, 1997).\nEcological and interactive systems models are a useful\nfoundation to view and interpret resilience within the indi-\nvidual, team, organization, and community. Paton and\nViolanti's (2011) model of adaptive capacity describes resil-\nience and adaptive capacity as \"resulting from the interaction\namong person, team, organizational and family factors with\neach level of analysis being interdependent\" (p. 165). These\nauthors maintain that empowerment of individuals collec-\ntively helps to build a resilient workforce and organization.\nThey believe that developing and building on interpretive\nframeworks from past critical events, through facilitating\ncompetencies from lessons learned of past experiences, help\nto build the adaptive capacity of professionals working in\nhigh risk professions (Paton & Violanti, 2011).\nConclusion\nThis review highlighted many organizational, functional,\nand competency issues that affected the preparedness of\nhealth care professionals during a natural disaster. Many\nissues and lessons learned have been raised previously in\ndisaster-related health care literature. One factor that appears\nto be missing is the focus on the adaptive demands specifi-\ncally on nurses working in residential health care facilities\nduring and after an event. Their roles and responsibilities\nwere often invisible within the highly visible event. Research\nexploring the adaptive demands of nurses in a critical event\nsuch as a large-scale natural disaster may help to further\nhighlight the important roles nurses play and the effect that it\nmay have on a health care facility.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAldunate, R.
