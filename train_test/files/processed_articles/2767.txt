While assimilation is a complex process that cannot be reduced to a\nsingle indicator, intermarriage offers insights into one key dimension: whether ethnic\nidentity is salient enough as a boundary to influence marriage decisions. For example,\nPagnini and Morgan (1990) and Qian and Lichter (2007) examine intermarriage in the\nUnited States in the early and late 20th century respectively for insight into boundaries\nbetween immigrant groups and the native-born population. Low rates of intermarriage,\nlike the levels observed between African Americans and whites in the United States, are\nsuggestive of in-group preferences on the part of one or both groups. High rates,\nmeanwhile, are indicative of relative indifference to the ethnicity of prospective\nspouses.\nQuantitative evidence on the prevalence of Manchu and Han intermarriage during\nthe Qing is rare. Even if relevant studies exist, the institutional context in most parts of\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 34\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 931\nChina regarding civilians and the Eight Banners, as detailed in the next section, would\ncomplicate the interpretation of results: Intermarriage between mostly Manchu\nbannermen and mostly Han civilians was forbidden or at least strongly discouraged\ngeneral population, it is unclear whether it reflected compliance with prohibitions\nagainst marriage between bannermen and civilians or deliberate avoidance based on\nethnicity.\nThis paper explores the boundaries between Han and non-Han in the late Qing by\nstudying intermarriage in an unusual population whose members were able to marry\nwithout regard to the prohibitions against marriages between bannermen and civilians\nthat, as a by-product, prevented marriages between Manchu and Han elsewhere in\nChina. The population we study were affiliated with the Eight Banners. Families should\nhave been free to emphasize or ignore the ethnicity of prospective spouses for their son\nor daughter according to their own preferences or prejudices. High rates of\nintermarriage would indicate indifference to boundaries, while very low rates would\nindicate attentiveness to them.\nOur analysis makes use of the China Multi-Generational Panel Dataset,\nShuangcheng (CMGPD-SC). This records the population of a settlement in\nShuangcheng County in what is now Heilongjiang Province on an annual basis between\nthe middle of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. For our analysis, we use\ntwo measures of ethnicity to identify cases of intermarriage: the registered ethnicity of\nhusbands recorded in the original data and the implied ethnicity as suggested by maiden\nnames of their wives. The data also allows us to examine the relationship of\nintermarriage and socioeconomic status because they include household landholding\nand official positions held by males.\nWhile this study is by no means intended to resolve the debate over sinicization,\nwe hope that the results will offer a novel perspective on ethnic boundaries between\nManchu and Han during the Qing by taking a very different approach than previous\nstudies. Whereas much of the earlier work examines relations among elites or in major\ncities where there were banner garrisons, we study the routine behavior of residents of\nfarming communities on the frontier. Their decisions regarding marriage provide\ninsights into the practice of identity on the ground, reflecting their daily experiences\nand interactions.\nWe also contribute to the broader literature on ethnic intermarriage by being one of\nthe first to examine it quantitatively in a historical non-Western population, let alone in\na multiethnic empire such as Qing China. Almost all previous studies of ethnic\nintermarriage have been for North America or Europe, and focus on the 20th century\nthese studies focus on trends in intermarriage as indicators of ethnic assimilation or\n932 http://www.demographic-research.org\nintegration, or, in the case of studies of black\u00adwhite intermarriage in the United States,\ntest Merton's status exchange theory (1941). Studies of marriage between Chinese and\nneighboring peoples in the Qing and earlier dynasties, like studies of intermarriage\nbetween the residents of empires and neighboring peoples, have generally been\nqualitative and focused on the role of marriage in diplomacy. Similarly, studies of\nmarriage for conquering peoples such as the Manchus, who founded the Qing dynasty,\nand the Mongols, who founded the Yuan dynasty (1271\u00ad1368), have generally focused\non the strategies of elite families.\nThe rest of the paper is divided into five parts. In Section 2 we provide historical\nbackground on ethnicity and ethnic intermarriage during the Qing period, giving the\ninstitutional and historical context for the study site. In Section 3 we introduce the\nCMGPD-SC, which is the basis for our analysis, and provide background on\nShuangcheng. We explain our approaches to the measurement of ethnicity. In Section 4\nwe describe our methods. We use tabulations to characterize patterns of ethnic\nassortative mating and then estimate logistic regressions to examine how community,\nhousehold, and individual characteristics influenced the probability that a man would\nmarry a woman of a different ethnicity. In Section 5 we present the results and interpret\nthe main findings. We conclude in Section 6 with an assessment of the results for our\nunderstanding of Qing China.\n2. Background\n2.1 The Eight Banners\nOne of the most distinctive and widely noted features of Qing China was that it was\nfounded by a conquering army organized by Manchus, who originated in what is now\nNortheast China, and then ruled by their descendants. As part of their effort to maintain\ncontrol, the conquerors and their descendants sought to retain an identity distinct from\nthat of their subject population. Toward this end they created a civil and military\norganization, the Eight Banners, membership of which was hereditary and defined by\ndescent from the Manchu conquerors and their Mongol or other allies. Rules and\nregulations privileged bannermen (qiren) and governed their interactions with the\nnonbanner civilian population, made up mostly of Han Chinese. Outside Northeast\nChina, bannermen lived separately from Han Chinese and other civilians in garrisons.\nThe Manchu were originally a nomadic people living on the frontier, like the\nMongols. The threat posed by such nomadic peoples was a preoccupation of successive\nChinese dynasties going back millennia and a focus of diplomacy and military activity.\nLike many of these nomadic peoples, the Manchu distinguished themselves from the\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 34\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 933\nresidents of the territory they conquered by their emphasis on martial skills, such as\nhorseback riding, archery, and hunting. They continued to use their own written and\noral language, dressed differently than the Han, chose recognizably different given\nnames (Campbell, Lee, and Elliott 2002), and had different traditions for marriage,\nburial, and other ceremonies. While the Manchu adapted Confucian ideology to\nlegitimate their rule, there is plenty of debate, as noted before, over the extent to which\nThe Eight Banners were originally an institution of military management among\nthe Jurchen tribes of Northeast China. They gradually developed into a more elaborate\npolitical and military institution as the Jurchen expanded southward from Northeast\nChina and eventually completed their conquest of the country (Du 2008). When the\nEight Banner system was first established in 1615, the bannermen consisted mainly of\nManchus who were part of the conquering army, along with some Mongols and other\nethnicities who lived in Northeast China. It also included some Han who had lived\nunder the Jurchen. More Han were added to the banners later, either because they\nhelped in the conquest or because they had other relationships with the Manchu.\nSubsequently, affiliation was hereditary.\nThe Eight Banners had an internal hierarchy (Xu 2008). The Upper Three Banners\n(shangsanqi) were of higher status. They included the Plain Yellow, Bordered Yellow,\nand Plain Blue. Membership was limited to the Manchu conquerors and their\ndescendants only. The Lower Five Banners (xiasanqi) included the Plain Red, Bordered\nRed, Plain White, Bordered White, and Bordered Blue. In addition to Manchu, they\nincluded other ethnicities, such as Mongol, Xibo, and Han. These banners were of\nlower status on a number of levels (Ding 1992; Li 1992). Whereas in Shuangcheng the\nHan and other groups were mixed together with Manchu in the Lower Five Banners, in\nother contexts they were organized under separate formal structures. The Han who were\npart of the Eight Banners were mostly descended from Han who resided in areas that\nwere conquered early on and were incorporated into the Han-martial Eight Banners\n(baqi hanjun). Another sign that Han bannermen had a distinct and somewhat lower\nstatus is that during the reign of Qianlong (1735\u00ad1796) they were allowed to choose\nwhether they wanted to retain their status or become non-banner Han civilians (Sun\nMuch of the research on the Eight Banners in Northeast China focuses on their\norganization and role. The essential role of the Eight Banner garrison system in\nadministering Northeast China has been studied using traditional historical archives\nthe role of the Eight Banners as a military force ended around 1858, when they were\nsuperseded by new modern armies. Xie (2008) studied the collapse of Han banners and\n934 http://www.demographic-research.org\nalso investigated the question of Manchu and Han assimilation by studying the Han\nbanners. He concluded that the resinicization of Han bannermen led to the overall\nexamined the Xibo garrison, focusing on its origins (Wu and Zhao 2008). Other\nChinese researchers have looked into the ethnic identity of Han bannermen in Northeast\nChina. Wu concluded that Han bannermen in Heilongjiang mostly assimilated into\nManchu culture in terms of their language, customs, and ethnic identity, although there\nwere some exceptions (Wu 2005). Qiu described the life of bannermen and their\ndescendants who live in suburban areas of Beijing based on oral history interviews and\nby referring to other archives (Qiu 2014).\nAs discussed in the introduction, there is intense debate over whether the Manchu\nretained a distinct identity or had been assimilated by the Han by the end of the Qing.\nThe case for sinicization was made most forcefully by Ho (1967, 1998). He argued that\nthe Qing embraced Confucianism as a way of legitimating their rule and that, following\nthe example of previous conquest dynasties, the Manchu and other groups that were\npart of the banners were eventually assimilated into Han Chinese society. In contrast,\nthat Manchus retained a distinct identity well into the 19th century. The specifics of\ntheir arguments differ. Elliot (2001: 14) explored Manchu identity formation and\nclaimed that \"the Manchus were never as a group assimilated into Chinese society in\nthe Qing.\" He said that the Manchu conquest group took measures to maintain\nboundaries that would distinguish them from the majority Han (Elliott 2001). Crossley\n(1991) claimed that not only were the Manchus not sinicized but their self-\nconsciousness of their distinct ethnicity grew over time in response to changes in their\nown position and in Chinese attitudes toward them (Crossley 1991).\n2.2 Assortative mating\nIn most societies people tend to marry those they regard as similar to themselves in\nways that concern them. This behavior, often referred to as assortative mating, is the\nsubject of many studies because it reflects and shapes boundaries between social groups\n(Qian and Lichter 2007). Changes in assortative mating over time reflect changes in\nthose boundaries and the integration of social groups. Common topics include religion\nbelow, race and ethnicity. In the relevant literature, a large number of methods has been\ndeveloped to describe patterns of assortative mating and compare those patterns across\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 34\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 935\nOne of the most influential theories about the relationship of race and ethnic\nintermarriage to broader social context is Merton's (1941) original theory of status\nexchange. Initially developed to account for patterns of interracial marriage in the 20th-\ncentury United States, this theory suggests that, when marrying, individuals leverage\nhigh status on one level by seeking a spouse who may be low status on that level but\nhigh on another. Other theories of race and ethnic assortative mating focus on\nexplaining ethnic homogamy (that is, the choice of a spouse from within the same\ngroup). Preferences for cultural similarity have been studied in the literature on\npersonal attraction in psychology (Byrne 1971). Another hypothesis about within-group\nmarriage is group identification (Hwang, Saenz, and Aguirre 1995), according to which\nmore educated individuals may be more likely to intermarry because they are not as\nconcerned about identifying as a member of their origin group.\nAssortative mating by race and ethnicity is widespread, reflecting the salience of\nrelevant social boundaries. In the most extreme cases, such boundaries are imposed by\nlaws forbidding specific types of intermarriage. Even where laws do not forbid\nintermarriage, prejudice against specific racial or ethnic groups may lead to marriages\nwith them being rare. Conversely, groups may discourage their members from marrying\nout in order to preserve the identity of the group and prevent assimilation. In other\ncases, low rates of intermarriage between groups result from the indirect effect of\nassociations between group membership and other characteristics that play a role in\nspouse selection: for example, religion (Pagnini and Morgan 1990).\nRacial and ethnic intermarriage is consequently widely studied for what it reveals\nabout the formation, maintenance, and dissolution of boundaries between groups. The\nrelevant literature is sizeable and here we provide examples of a few influential studies\nthat use intermarriage to study assimilation. Intermarriage between racial and ethnic\ngroups in the United States is the most frequently considered. Common topics include\nthe determinants of interethnic marriage (Furtado and Trejo 2013), the linguistic\ndistance (Chiswick and Houseworth 2011), trends of intermarriage over time (Qian and\nLichter 2007), and immigration in relation to assimilation (Pagnini and Morgan 1990).\nOutside the United States, Monden and Smits (2005) studied marriages between\nLatvians and Russians before and after independence from the Soviet Union, and found\nthat at least half of the increase in intermarriage following independence could be\nexplained by what they refer to as \"the integrative process.\" In an analysis that\npreceded the civil war in Yugoslavia by several years, Botev (1994) examined ethnic\nintermarriage there and concluded that it was not increasing, and that there was little\nevidence that boundaries between groups were diminishing.\nWhile there are a number of studies of educational assortative mating in\none published study of assortative mating based on political status (Xu, Ji, and Tung\n936 http://www.demographic-research.org\n2000), published studies of ethnic intermarriage are rare and tend to focus on specific\nregions or provinces. For Taiwan, marriages between Taiwanese and mainlanders have\nbeen examined in the historical and political context of relationships between those two\ngroups (Wu 2002; Liang 2009). In conjunction with a study of consanguinity (marriage\nwith kin) in a Man (Manchu) population in a community in rural Liaoning, Wang,\nQian, and Bittles (2002) reported rising levels of intermarriage between Manchu and\nHan in the 20th century. In a study using 1990 census data from Beijing and Xinjiang,\nMamet, Jacobson, and Heaton (2005) found that Man were the most likely to\nintermarry and Uyghurs the least.\n2.3 Interethnic marriage during the Qing\nEven though the prohibition against marriage between bannermen and civilians was\nwell enough known to be the basis of a common saying (\"Qi min bu tonghun\" \u00ad\n\"Banner and civilians do not intermarry) and had the side effect of preventing\nintermarriage between Han and Manchus in much of China, we have not located any\nevidence of prohibitions against ethnic intermarriage within the Eight Banners during\nthe Qing. The small number of published quantitative studies of ethnic intermarriage\nduring the Qing rely on the ethnicity apparent in the maiden names of wives in\ngenealogies from elite Manchu descent groups, such as the Imperial Lineage. The\nresults tend to confirm that prohibitions against bannerman marrying Han populations\n(min) were respected, at least in the selection of primary wives (qi) (Lee, Wang, and\nRuan 2001; Lee and Wang 2000). In elite families of the ruling class, primary wives\nwere almost entirely Manchu, while qie (commonly translated as `concubines') and\nother partners of lower status could be Han. Remaining studies of ethnic intermarriage\nin the Eight Banners are mostly qualitative, focusing on the institutional context, or\nreporting on case studies of specific locations based on archival documents or the\nresults of fieldwork among contemporary descendants of Eight Banner populations.\nmuch of what is known about intermarriage between Manchu and Han during the Qing.\nShe emphasizes that what we refer to as the boundary between Manchu and Han during\nthe Qing was in fact a boundary between the ruling banners and their civilian subjects,\nnot necessarily between the two ethnic groups as they are presently defined. According\nto Ding, within the Eight Banners, Manchu, Han, and other ethnicities were free to\nintermarry (Ding 1999: 349), and this may have been a way the Manchu and Han\nwithin the banners integrated.\nThe policies that governed marriages between bannermen and civilians changed\nover time. Right after the Qing was established, intermarriage between Manchu and\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 34\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 937\nHan was encouraged in order to reduce tensions between the two groups. However, the\npolicy did not work well and the Qing court quietly canceled the policy soon afterwards\ncivilians was prohibited during the early Qing, mainly to prevent Manchu women from\nmarrying Han men. Starting during the reign of Kangxi (1661\u00ad1722), men in the Eight\nBanners were allowed to marry Han women under specific conditions. This practice\nintermarriage between the banners and Han was revived in the Jiaqing period (1796\u00ad\n1820) and then relaxed again in 1865. The rule that forbade daughters of bannermen\nfrom marrying Han civilian males was amended so that it applied only in Beijing (Ding\nA number of other studies examine intermarriage between bannermen and Han\ncivilians (Zhang and Zhang 2005; Liu 2008). Formal or informal prohibitions against\nsuch intermarriages were most influential in the Upper Three Banners (Zhang and\nZhang 2005). Bannermen also had an economic incentive not to intermarry. They\nenjoyed benefits and privileges, including legal protection of their real estate and other\nproperty, that they could lose if they married Han civilians (Liu 2008). In spite of these\nobstacles, at least one qualitative study relying on interviews with the living\ndescendants of mixed marriages suggests that in Eight Banner garrisons bannermen\nmarried local non-banner Han civilians (Pan 2007). Liu (2008) also compared marriage\npractices across Eight Banner garrisons and found that while bannermen in northern\ngarrisons, such as Xian and Suiyuan, avoided marrying civilians for more than 200\nyears, in other garrisons, such as Hangzhou, they did so frequently. Bannermen took\ncivilian Han women as their wives, but banner women rarely married civilian Han men\nEven though, as noted above, there were no regulations forbidding Manchu,\nMongol, and Han in the Eight Banners from marrying each other (Ding 1999), there\nmay nevertheless have been obstacles in the form of status differences by ethnicity\nwithin the banners (Chen 2017), as well as preferences or prejudices rooted in identity.\nAs we have seen, membership in the Upper Three Banners was reserved for Manchu\nconquerors and their descendants, and non-Manchu were restricted to the Lower Five\nBanners. One consequence of this differentiation was that the Manchu, Mongol, and\nHan banners were initially assigned to separate districts in the capital, Beijing, though\ngeographic segregation may have declined later as housing became less strictly\n938 http://www.demographic-research.org\nThe population of Shuangcheng that we study was descended from Manchu, Han, and\nother bannermen who lived in Beijing and other locations in areas that are now Hebei,\nof the bannermen to Shuangcheng in the early 19th century was organized by the state\n(Chen 2017). That the settlement was carefully planned and regulated is evident in\nFigure 1, which shows the locations of settlement villages in Shuangcheng. The Qing\ngovernment relocated 698 metropolitan banner families from Beijing to Shuangcheng\nin order to reduce the expense associated with supporting them in the capital. The\nrelocated families were given land grants instead of monthly and annual allowances for\ntheir support. These were the jingqi, or metropolitan bannermen. To clear the land,\nconstruct 120 new villages, and otherwise help the metropolitan families adjust to rural\nlife, the government also relocated 3,000 households of rural bannermen from areas that\nare now Hebei, Liaoning, and Jilin Provinces (Wang et al. 2013). These were the\ntunding. Shuangcheng was otherwise closed to other legal migrants before the 1860s.\nStatus as jingqi or tunding was hereditary, descending through the father.\nThe state privileged the jingqi in a number of ways. Most importantly, it gave\nthem larger allocations of land. In Shuangcheng, each tunding household was allocated\n18.33 shang, while each jingqi household was allocated nearly twice that amount: 35\nshang (Chen 2017). 4 Detailed analysis of landholding data in Shuangcheng proved that\nthe local government succeed in maintaining the inequality between metropolitan and\nrural bannermen: In 1876, about 58% of the rural banner households were in the bottom\nhalf of the overall landholding distribution, while only 13.5% of the metropolitan\nbanner households were in the bottom half. The state also intervened in the land market\nto maintain these differentials (Chen 2017). Meanwhile, male tunding were required to\nserve as laborers. Tunding households without adult males had to hire laborers to fulfill\nthe service requirement.\n4 Shang is a unit of land in historical China, especially in northern China. 35 shang correspond to about 64\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 34\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 939\nFigure 1: Shuangcheng settlement, Heilongjiang, late 19th to early 20th century\nBased on the state-mandated inequality in land allocation and other policies that\nsought to preserve an elevated status for jingqi (Chen 2017), and inspired by Merton's\ntheory of status exchange, which we introduced earlier, we expect that for Han males\nhigher social and economic status is associated with greater chances of intermarriage\nwith non-Han wives, while for non-Han males it will be associated with less\nintermarriage. In this population, the non-Han were privileged, especially if they were\njingqi. Non-Han families of high socioeconomic status had little incentive to marry\ntheir daughters into Han families of low socioeconomic status, but non-Han families of\nlow socioeconomic status may have had an incentive to exchange their ethnic status for\neconomic status by marrying their daughters into Han families of high socioeconomic\nstatus.\n940 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTo study ethnic intermarriage in Shuangcheng during the Qing, we make use of 1.3\nBecause this data and extensive documentation are publicly accessible for download at\nICPSR (Wang et al. 2013), and are the basis of a book on stratification and\ndemographic behavior which also provides extensive detail on local context (Chen\n2017), here we only summarize specific details relevant to the analysis.5 The CMGPD-\nSC was constructed from population registers compiled annually in Shuangcheng from\n1866 to 1913. Records included individual name, age, relationship to household head,\ndemographic characteristics, and entrances and exits. Importantly for this analysis, the\nCMGPD-SC records the registered ethnicity of households. For males, registered\nethnicity was hereditary and descended through the father. Other historical Chinese\npopulation sources, such as the China Multi-Generational Panel Dataset, Liaoning\n(CMGPD-LN), mostly do not record registered ethnicity, except in very specific\ncircumstances.\nThe CMGPD-SC includes a number of measures of social, economic, and political\nstatus. The CMGPD-SC organizes individuals not only by household and village, but\nby banner, which, as noted earlier, was an important dimension of status because of its\nassociation with jingqi or tunding status (Chen 2017; Wang et al. 2013). The CMGPD-\nand 1906. Landholding reflected a mixture of state and market influences. The land\nallocation policy of the state differentiated between jingqi and tunding (Chen 2017).\nPrevious studies using the CMGPD-SC and CMGPD-LN establish these datasets\nas valuable source for studying social, economic, and demographic history (Chen 2017;\nfor studying marriage has already been demonstrated in studies of community and\nhousehold influences on the chances of marrying or remarrying (Chen, Campbell, and\nSC and the related CMGPD-LN to examine stratification and demographic behavior\nof Liaoning by Ding et al. (2004) and Lee and Campbell (1997) use only the CMGPD-\nLN but are relevant as background on regional and banner history and context.\nOur sample is based on records of jingqi and tunding in CMGPD-SC. Both the\njingqi and tunding include a mixture of Manchu, Mongol, Han, Xibo, and other groups.\nThe diversity is apparent in Table 1, which presents the registered ethnicity of males in\nthe CMGPD-SC according to whether they were jingqi or tunding. The higher-status\n5 The data and accompanying documentation may be downloaded at ICPSR: http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 34\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 941\njingqi were composed mostly of Manchu, but included Mongol and Xibo. Importantly,\nthe jingqi did not include any Han at all. The lower-status tunding included a\nsubstantial proportion who were Han, with the remainder distributed among the other\nnon-Han groups (Chen 2017). Han accounted for 35% of males, making them a\nminority in Shuangcheng. Outside Northeast China, of course, Han Chinese accounted\nfor the majority of the population. According to one estimate, non-Han in the Eight\nBanners accounted for only 2\u00ad4% of the population of China overall during the Qing\nTable 1: Registered ethnicity and population category of males, Shuangcheng,\nJingqi vs. tunding\nEthnicity Number of\nobservations\nPercent Jingqi % Tunding % Total %\nNotes: Restricted to observations of males between 1 and 75 sui. We exclude those observations whose registered ethnicity was not\navailable in the data.\nThe main challenge of using the CMGPD-SC in the study of interethnic marriage\nis that ascertaining the ethnicity of wives' natal families requires an indirect approach\nbased on her maiden name. In Shuangcheng, the registers record ethnicity only for the\nhousehold as a whole; they do not separately record the registered ethnicity of wives\nbased on their household of origin. Nor do they directly identify the natal households of\nmarried women, so the information cannot yet be recovered by nominative record\nlinkage back to the wife's record as a daughter in another household. We have\nexperimented with linking records of wives to their records as daughters in their natal\nhouseholds based on their maiden name, age, and year of marriage. However, the\nresulting links are not yet satisfactory and robust when a wife is matched to multiple\ndaughters or multiple wives are matched to the same daughter. Thus, while we continue\nto work on better solutions for direct linkage, in the current study we report results\nbased on an indirect approach for the identification of wives' ethnicity.\nFor our indirect approach, we make use of the wife's maiden name and take\nadvantage of the fact that certain surnames were strongly associated with registered\n942 http://www.demographic-research.org\nethnicity being either Han or non-Han. We identified surnames that were exclusively or\npredominantly Han and non-Han by tabulating surnames against the registered ethnicity\nof men in our data. Then we flagged wives' ethnicity based on whether their maiden\nname was one that the tabulations indicated was predominantly Han or predominantly\nnon-Han, and retained the remainder in our sample as a third group classified as\nindeterminate.\nTabulation of male surnames by registered ethnicity identifies a subset of\nsurnames that have a clear association with ethnicity, in the sense that they are almost\nexclusively Han or non-Han. Table 2 presents the top 20 surnames according to\nwhether the male's household ethnicity is registered as Han or non-Han. Through a\nreview of such tabulations, we identified a subset of surnames listed in Table 3 that\nappear almost exclusively in Han or non-Han households, and are therefore likely to be\nreliable indicators of the registered ethnicity of the wife's household of origin. These\nare the basis for our flag variable. For a wife's likely ethnicity we identified nine Han\nsurnames (Han, Zhou, Jin, Chen, Xia, Jiang, Mu, Pan, Huang) that appeared primarily\namong men registered as Han and used these as the basis for inferring Han ethnicity\namong wives. For example, 8.46% of the Han population was surnamed Han, versus\n1.8% of the non-Han population. The distinction is even clearer for the remaining Han\nsurnames. Zhou accounts for 3.29% of the Han population, but 0.26% of the non-Han\npopulation. To identify non-Han wives, we also identified 15 surnames that in the\nShuangcheng registers appear solely or primarily among non-Han men (Zhao, Guan,\nWu, Bai, Fu, He, Gao, Na, Ma, Tong, Lang, Shen, Meng, E, Hu). While outside\nNortheast China some of these are primarily associated with Han Chinese, within\nShuangcheng this is a coincidence, and the surnames don't reflect kinship with Han\nChinese lineages elsewhere in China that have the same surname.\nTable 2: Top 20 male surnames by registered ethnicity, Shuangcheng,\nHan surname % of Han population Non-Han surname % of non-Han population\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 34\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 943\nTable 2: (Continued)\nHan surname% of Han population Non-Han surname % of non-Han population\nTable 3: Surnames used to flag Han and non-Han wives, Shuangcheng,\nHan Non-Han\nSurname % of registered Han % of registered non-Han Surname % of registered non-Han % of registered Han\nThe distinctiveness within Shuangcheng of the surnames used by the non-Han is a\nlegacy of differences between Chinese and the Manchu, Mongol, and other non-Han\nlanguages. Unlike Chinese surnames, Manchu surnames were multisyllabic and written\nin a separate syllabic script derived from Mongol. Manchu and other non-Han names\nwritten with Chinese characters were therefore not just transliterations but also often\nshort approximations of longer multisyllabic names. When Manchus, Mongols, and\n944 http://www.demographic-research.org\nother non-Han selected Chinese characters to represent their surnames, they did so on\nthe basis of the pronunciation of their names in their native language. The Manchus\nbegan to adapt Chinese characters to represent their surnames only after they conquered\nChina in the early 17th century, in part out of a desire to improve communication with\ntheir Han subjects (Gao 2001). This also explains why some of the surnames that\nappear mainly or solely among non-Han people in Shuangcheng seem to be the same as\nsurnames associated with Han Chinese elsewhere in China.\nThe surnames in Table 3 that are predominantly Han or non-Han are roughly the\nsame as the ones that other studies have identified as being strongly associated with\nbeing either Han or Manchu, Mongol, or other non-Han. Because these were adapted as\ntransliterations, they don't reflect common ancestry with Han Chinese with the same\nsurnames elsewhere in China. Studies of Manchu surnames list the most common\nChinese characters used to represent them during the Qing and trace the history of the\npractice of using Chinese characters for surnames back to the Liao, Jin, and Yuan\nperiods (Gao 2001). For example, Guan and Bai are common Chinese surnames for\npeople whose Manchu-language surname is Gua'erjia. Gao and He are common\nChinese surnames for people whose Manchu-language surname is Hesheli. Overall, as\nmany as one-third of the Chinese characters routinely used to represent Manchu\nsurnames originated with the Jurchens during the Jin dynasty in the 12th century (Mu\n4. Methods\n4.1 Community, household, and individual influences on intermarriage\nTo study the influence of community, household, and individual characteristics on the\nchances of ethnic intermarriage, we estimate separate logistic regressions for males\naccording to whether their registered ethnicity was Han or non-Han. Each observation\nrepresents a newly married couple. In each case, the outcome variable is set to 1 if they\nare intermarrying: that is, if the wife's surname is among the ones that in Table 3 was\nclearly associated with the other ethnicity. If the wife's surname is of the same\nethnicity, or her ethnicity could not be inferred from her surname because it wasn't one\nof the surnames in Table 3, the outcome variable is set to 0. With this approach, we are\nlikely to underestimate the overall level of intermarriage, since many of the wives in the\nindeterminate category may also be of the other ethnicity. However, we have no reason\nto think that this likely underestimate of the overall level of intermarriage will affect\npatterns of differences within the population that is the goal of the logistic regression.\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 34\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 945\nRight-hand-side variables listed in Table 4 measure characteristics of the\nnewlywed husband, his household, and his village. We make use of information about\nthe husband from when they were first recorded as married. When a right-hand-side\nvariable is an indicator, for example, of whether the husband holds a non-Han name,\nthe mean given in Table 2 represents the proportion of the population in that category.\nThe coefficient that we estimate later will reflect the proportional difference in the odds\nof having a wife from another ethnicity, compared to the odds of having a wife from the\nother ethnicity for those males who do not have a non-Han name.\nTable 4: Means of the right-hand-side variables, newlywed males,\nHusband's characteristics Han Non-Han\nPopulation category (ref: jingqi)\n946 http://www.demographic-research.org\nWe include six sets of right-hand-side variables that measure different aspects of\nsocial and economic status at time of marriage at household and individual levels: (1)\njingqi (metropolitan bannermen) or tunding (rural bannermen), (2) household\nlandholding, (3) whether or not the husband's father has ever held a government\nposition, (4) an indicator for whether the husband's father has a non-Han given name,\n(5) an indicator for whether the husband has a non-Han given name, (6) husband's age\nat marriage, (7) an indicator for whether the husband's mother's maiden name was non-\nHan, and (8) an indicator for whether or not the husband was an eldest son.\nAmong the Manchu, we expect jingqi to be less likely than tunding to marry a Han\nwife. As noted earlier, the jingqi had the highest status in Shuangcheng (Chen 2017).\nThey were all Manchu and Mongols, and descended from the bannermen who had been\nrelocated from Beijing and Rehe. The state took active measures to maintain\ndistinctions between them and the tunding, including granting them a variety of\neconomic and social privileges. The tunding were descended from bannermen farmers\nin Liaoning and Jilin who were recruited by the state to help prepare the area for the\njingqi. For jingqi, a Han wife would necessarily be tunding, and families indifferent to\nthe ethnicity of their son's wife may have had little incentive to recruit a wife from the\nlower-status tunding. By contrast, economically less successful non-Han tunding may\nhave had an incentive to intermarry with economically successful Han tunding if it\nallowed them to exchange their higher ethnic status for a connection with an\neconomically successful family (Merton 1941).\nFor our measure of landholding, we use a categorical variable. To construct it, we\ncalculate the total amount of land held by each household, merge it to individual\nrecords, and then categorize the amount of land held as high, medium, or low. For years\nwhere no landholding information was available for an individual, we copied their\ninformation forward from the most recent available year. For those whose landholding\ninformation was still missing after attempting to copy forward, we created an indicator\nvariable, thereby separating them into a different category.6\nWe expect men whose fathers held a position to have been more likely to\nintermarry if they were Han, but less likely to intermarry if they were non-Han. In\nhistorical China, a father's socioeconomic status influenced adult male marriage\nchances (Chen, Campbell, and Lee 2014). Men with high-status fathers married earlier\nand were more likely to marry overall. In a largely rural society like Shuangcheng,\nholders of relatively mundane salaried government positions were among the local elite\nbecause they had a fixed nonagricultural income. Some positions also provided\nopportunities for additional income beyond the official salary. Han males whose fathers\n6 In terms of landholding, the difference between `haves' and `have-nots' is the most prominent inequality.\nWe also experimented with other cut-offs in categorizing landholding, and the results are quite similar. We\nchose 15 and 18.33 in our final models in order to be consistent across two approaches.\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 34\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 947\nheld a salaried position may have been an attractive prospect for non-Han families with\ndaughters, while similarly advantaged non-Han families may have had great incentive\nto consider daughters from Han families. We do not use the husband's own official\nposition because most men married before they were old enough to attain a position.\nAs a measure of expressed ethnic affiliation or aspiration, we use indicators of\nwhether the husband or his father had a non-Han given name. When Han took non-Han\ngiven names, it was typically to express an affiliation with the ruling Manchus. For\nexample, in Liaoning men often took Manchu given names upon acquiring an official\nposition (Campbell, Lee, and Elliott 2002). Some of the bannermen in Shuangcheng\nwho were registered as Han had Manchu given names, suggesting a desire to express\naffiliation with the non-Han banners. Among Han males in our population, having a\nnon-Han given name may have reflected some status not otherwise measured that led\nthem to express affiliation. Accordingly, we expect Han males who had non-Han given\nnames or whose fathers had non-Han given names to have been more likely to marry\nnon-Han women.\nWe include a categorical variable to control for age at time of marriage for the\nhusband. In historical China, male age at marriage was strongly associated with\nsocioeconomic status. Higher-status males married earlier. Lower-status males married\nlater or not at all (Campbell and Lee 2008a). To the extent that earlier marriage\nreflected higher social or economic status, we expect Han men who married early also\nto be more likely to marry non-Han wives, and non-Han men who married early to be\nless likely to marry Han wives. The age of males in our regression models ranges from\nand 31\u00ad40. We start at age 11 because previous studies of marriage in Northeast China\nreveal that men began to marry at around that age (Chen, Campbell, and Lee 2014).\nOverall, they were most likely to marry in their early or mid-twenties.\nHan men who had a mother with a non-Han maiden name should be more likely to\nmarry a non-Han wife. Although the registered ethnicity of these men was Han, they\nprobably included some who were of mixed ancestry, in the sense that their mother may\nhave been non-Han. For a Han male, the fact that their mother was non-Han may\nindicate that their father was himself of higher status than other Han males. Of course,\nhaving a non-Han mother may have increased the chances of marrying a non-Han\nwoman in other ways. For example, the husband may already have had affinal kin who\nwere non-Han who could assist in the search for a spouse by providing introductions to\nother non-Han families.\nWe assess the influence of seniority among brothers by including an indicator to\nmake clear whether the husband was his parents' eldest son. Households in China\nprioritized the marriage of their eldest son (Lee and Campbell 1997). They married\nearlier and in higher proportions. Younger brothers married afterward and in sequence.\n948 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTo the extent that families were also more strategic and selective when it came to\nevaluating prospective daughters-in-law for eldest sons, we expect Han males who were\neldest sons to have been more likely to marry non-Han wives. Conversely, we expect\nnon-Han males who were eldest sons to have been less likely to marry Han wives.\nWe include the percentage of the village population currently registered Han as a\nmeasure of the ethnic composition of the local marriage market. The share of Han or\nnon-Han people within the village may affect the chances of intermarriage by shaping\nthe composition of the marriage market. In historical China, families sought brides in\nthe same village or a neighboring village. If people were completely indifferent to the\nethnicity of their spouse, or more broadly if preferences were unchanging, an increase\nin the share of the local population that was of a particular ethnicity should increase the\nshare of marriages involving that ethnicity. If the percentage of Han in the village was\nhigh, we would expect non-Han families seeking brides for their sons to have had more\nHan potential brides to choose from, and if they were indifferent to ethnicity or their\npreferences with respect to ethnicity did not vary across villages, the share of Han\nbrides should still increase. Meanwhile, Han families should have had fewer non-Han\nbrides from whom to choose. The measure we use in the logistic regression is not time-\nvarying. Ethnic differences in marriage and reproduction were small and we doubt that\ncomposition within villages changed much over time, but we do address the possibility\nof changes over time in the population-level composition of the marriage market in the\ncontingency table analysis.\nWe expect the chances of intermarriage to have changed during the period covered\nby our data, 1866\u00ad1913. As discussed above, regulations related to intermarriage\nfocused more on maintaining boundaries between bannermen and civilians, and less on\nboundaries between ethnic groups, and they appear to have been relaxed starting in\n1865. In the last few decades of the 19th century, China experienced political, social,\nand economic change. Attacks by foreign countries and unrest in other parts of the\ncountry weakened the Qing state and reduced the status of bannermen. We expect that\nthese changes, especially the diminished status of Manchus, weakened boundaries\nbetween Han and non-Han. To control for changes over time in the chances that an\nindividual intermarried, we include a categorical variable by dividing our data into four\n4.2 Assortative mating over time\nTo assess changes over time in the overall level of assortative mating as reflected in the\ndistribution of couples according to the husband's registered ethnicity and wife's\nethnicity, we turn to contingency table analysis. Logistic regression yields insight into\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 34\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 949\nwithin-population differences in the propensity to intermarry but is less useful for\nproducing a population-level measure of the tendency to intermarry or remain\nhomogamous. While coefficients from the logistic regressions may reveal differences\nbetween men in the likelihood of intermarriage, by themselves they do not necessarily\nyield insight into the overall prevalence of intermarriage at the population level. That\nrequires consideration of the distribution of couples according to the characteristics of\nboth husband and wife.\nWe begin by computing the ratios of observed to expected marriages for different\ncombinations of husband's and wife's ethnicity over the four periods specified earlier.\nWe consider two categories for husband's registered ethnicity (Han and non-Han) and\nthree categories for wife's inferred ethnicity (Han, indeterminate, non-Han). We restrict\nour observations to newly married couples. Expected numbers of marriages were\ncalculated on the assumption that ethnicity played no role at all in partner choice, and\nnumbers of marriages to spouses of a particular type were directly proportional to the\noverall share of spouses of that type. When the ratio of observed to expected marriages\nis high, this means that pairs with those characteristics form more often than would be\nexpected if their matching was random. If the ratio is higher than one for spouses from\nthe same ethnic background, this means that there is ethnic homogamy, in the sense that\npeople are more likely to be married to people of the same ethnicity than can be\naccounted for by chance.\nWe then apply contingency table analysis to model the numbers of newly married\ncouples with different combinations of ethnicity in time periods. Studies of assortative\nmarriage across religious, ethnicities, and educational attainments routinely make use of\naccount for the influence of the numbers of husbands and wives of each ethnicity on the\ntotal numbers of couples of each combination, these models control for the distributions\nof husbands and wives by category, and estimate parameters that reflect how common\nor uncommon different types of pairings are relative to what would be expected if\nfamilies were indifferent to the associated characteristics. Because they rely on records\nof new couples, these models account for changes across time periods in the ethnic\ncomposition of the newlyweds.\nIn the complete model described by Equation 1, F denotes the expected number\nof new marriages between men in ethnic category i and women in ethnic category j\nobserved in time t. Husband's registered ethnic category is denoted by  , wife's\nethnic category inferred from her maiden surname is denoted by  , and time period\nof observation is denoted by  (i = Han, non-Han; j = Han, non-Han, indeterminate;\ndiagonal parameters, p = 1 if i = j (p = 0 otherwise). Therefore, the value of  provides\n950 http://www.demographic-research.org\nparameter estimates for ethnic homogamy. These parameters and their interaction with\ntime periods measure the extent of ethnic homogamy and its changes over time.\nlogF =  +  +  +  +   +   + p + p  (1)\n5. Results\n5.1 Descriptive results\nEthnic intermarriage was not uncommon. According to a tabulation of a husband's\nrecorded ethnicity by ethnicity implied by his wife's surname in Table 5, 7.90% of\nmarried non-Han men had wives who appear to be Han, in the sense that their maiden\nsurname was observed primarily in households whose registered ethnicity was Han.\nConversely, 21.35% of Han men have wives who appear based on their maiden names\nto be non-Han. These are conservative estimates based solely on a small number of\nsurnames that had a very clear association with one ethnicity or the other. For both Han\nand non-Han men, some wives currently in the indeterminate category are certain to be\nof a different ethnicity than their husband. According to Table 6, among non-Han males\nintermarriage with Han was more common for the tunding than for the jingqi. The\ntunding were of lower status than the jingqi, so may have had more incentive to\nintermarry, if it allowed them to form connections with economically successful Han\nfamilies.\nTable 5: Percentages of Han and non-Han newlywed men married to Han or\nHusband's registered\nethnicity\nHusband's population\ncategory\nWife's ethnicity as suggested by maiden name\nIndeterminate\nobservations\n%\nHan\nobservations\n%\nNon-Han\nobservations\n%\nTotal\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 34\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 951\nBy themselves, the percentages intermarrying presented in Table 5 do not yield\ninsight into actual preferences because they are subject to the influence of the relative\navailability of Han and non-Han in the marriage market. According to Table 5, Han\nvery close to the share of Han men in Shuangcheng in Table 1. Assuming the shares of\nHan women in the marriage market were similar, it would have been arithmetically\ndifficult for a large share of non-Han to marry Han wives, even if their families all\nwanted them to. Similarly, large shares of Han men marrying non-Han wives may\nsimply have reflected their relative abundance in the marriage market, not a specific\npreference. Making inferences about preference or avoidance requires comparison of\nobserved marriages with the number that would be expected if families were indifferent\nto the ethnicity of their son- or daughter-in-law. Therefore, below we make use of\ncontingency table analysis.\n5.2 Determinants of intermarriage\nMother's inferred ethnicity had strong effects on a man's chances of intermarriage.\nTable 6 presents the results of logistic regressions in which the outcome is whether a\nman's wife is of the opposite ethnicity; again, each observation represents a newlywed\ncouple.7 In our logistic regression models, the estimated coefficients reveal the change\nin the odds of intermarriage associated with a one-unit change in the covariate, holding\nother covariates unchanged. According to Table 6, the tendency to intermarry was\ncorrelated across generations: Mother's ethnicity, as reflected in her maiden name, has\na significant effect on Han and non-Han males' chances of marrying a woman of the\nother ethnicity. For Han men, having a mother with a non-Han maiden name raised the\nchances of marrying a non-Han woman by approximately 31%. For non-Han men,\nhaving a mother with a Han maiden name raised the chances of marrying a woman with\na Han maiden name by 52%. The inclusion of a control for the ethnic composition of\nthe village rules out the possibility that this solely reflects the availability of spouses in\nthe marriage market. More likely, the inclination to intermarry was inherited, or\nmother's kin played a role in helping locate prospective spouses and tended to refer\nfamilies of their own ethnicity.\nIntermarriage was also associated with ethnic aspirations expressed in choice of\ngiven name: Han men who had a non-Han given name were 34% more likely to\nintermarry. Choosing a non-Han given name for a son and finding a non-Han wife for\n7 As a robustness check, we used a subsample in which the variable used to flag wife's ethnicity as Han or\nnon-Han was constructed using a subset of surnames with an especially strong association with one group or\nthe other. The results are shown in Table A-1 in the Appendix and are consistent with the ones here.\n952 http://www.demographic-research.org\nhim may both have been strategies for Han banner families that sought to express an\naffiliation with the non-Han banner elites. Since father's official position and household\nlandholding are controlled for, this is net of any effects of the political or\nsocioeconomic standing of the family.\nThe composition of the local marriage market was also an important determinant\nof the chances of ethnic intermarriage. Han people who lived in a village where the\npercentage of non-Han was higher had higher chances of marrying a non-Han wife.\nConversely, for non-Han people, living in a village with a higher proportion of Han\npeople increased the chances of marrying a Han wife. In both cases, a one percentage\npoint increase in the share of Han in the village raised the chances of marrying a Han\nwife by approximately 1%. The strength and consistency of these associations suggest\nthat marriage markets were very local.\nTable 6: Determinants of interethnic marriage, newlywed males,\nWife's surname non-Han,\nfor registered Han husbands\nWife's surname Han,\nfor registered non-Han husbands\nHusband's characteristics Coef. Odds ratio p Coef. Odds ratio p\nPopulation category (ref: jingqi)\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 34\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 953\nThe results for the effects of jingqi and tunding status are consistent with the\nhypothesis that tunding non-Han had the most incentive to intermarry, because for at\nleast some of them it may have offered an opportunity to trade their higher ethnic status\nfor connections to economically well-off Han families (Merton 1941). Non-Han\ntunding were twice as likely to intermarry as non-Han jingqi. Since we have controlled\nfor the percentage of Han in the village of residence, this is unlikely to reflect the\neffects of geographic segregation by banner on marriage markets. It seems more likely\nthat, as a non-Han elite, the jingqi had less incentive to marry Han because doing so\nwould also imply intermarriage with lower-status tunding.\nThe effects of other measures of social and economic status were inconsistent. The\neffects of father's official position were not statistically significant. As for landholding,\nthere were differences by category among non-Han men, but the pattern was U-shaped:\nMen in the middle of the distribution were less likely to intermarry than those at the\nbottom or top. While the effect of being in the lower category of landholding is\nconsistent with the hypothesis that the least well-off non-Han had the strongest\nincentive to intermarry, the effect of being in the upper category is not.\nThe results also suggest that intermarriage became more common in the final\ndecades of the Qing. According to Table 6, Han were approximately 20% (e0.19) more\nlikely to marry non-Han wives in the period after 1900 than they were before 1880.\nWhile non-Han men were also more likely to intermarry during this period, the results\nare not statistically significant. Overall, there is some suggestion that in the final years\nof the dynasty already porous ethnic boundaries weakened even further. In particular,\nthere is clear evidence that either Han were more accepting of non-Han daughters-in-\nlaw or non-Han were more willing to marry their daughters into Han families. As noted\nabove, the Qing court began to relax restrictions on intermarriage between bannermen\nand civilians in 1865, and this may have been accompanied by a weakening of\nboundaries between ethnic groups within the banners. From the logistic regression\nalone, however, it is impossible to rule out the possibility that changes in the relative\navailability of different types of prospective spouses in the marriage market drove\nchanges in the likelihood of intermarriage.\nTo examine change over time in intermarriage while accounting for the possibility of\nchanges in the distribution of prospective spouses, we turn to contingency table\nanalysis. We begin our assessment of change over time by calculating o/e ratios\n(observed outcomes/expected outcomes) in contingency tables. The results are\ndisplayed in Table 7. When the ratio is close to 1 the proportion of couples of the\n954 http://www.demographic-research.org\nspecified combination of ethnicities was the same as would be expected if marriage\nignored ethnicity. Ratios higher than 1 indicate that there are more couples of the\nspecified combination than would be expected if people were indifferent to ethnicity.\nRatios higher than 1 for couples of the same ethnicity are indicative of homogamy.\nWe observe a clear time trend of decreasing homogamy and increasing\nintermarriage in these ratios. The o/e ratios for homogamy were 1.61 for Han and 1.28\nfor non-Han in the first time period, 1866\u00ad1879. The ratios declined gradually and\nreached 1.32 for Han homogamous marriages and 1.20 for non-Han homogamous\nmarriages in the time period 1900\u00ad1913. At the same time, the ratios for heterogamous\npairings increased over time. The ratio for couples consisting of non-Han men and Han\nwives rose from 0.62 to 0.79. The ratio for couples consisting of Han men and non-Han\nTable 7: Observed/expected ratios for ethnic homogamy and intermarriage\nHusband's registered Ethnicity of wife's surname\nethnicity Indeterminate Han Non-Han Observations\nAs an aside, we note that the ethnic composition of the population as a whole\nremained stable across the four periods. While this is most apparent in calculations for\nthe whole population that are not shown here, it is evident in the stability shares of\nregistered Han and non-Han men among husbands shown in Table 7. In the first period,\n(2,492/6,257) of husbands were registered Han. The population was closed, with almost\nno in- or out-migration, and differentials in marriage and reproduction according to\nethnicity were mild, so there was limited scope for the ethnic composition of the\npopulation to change.\nTo assess whether changes over time might be the product of chance variation or\nare likely to be real, we make use of log-linear models. Table 8 summarizes the\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 34\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 955\nestimated models. Model A-1 is an independence model, including only marginal\ndistributions of both husbands and wives, which assumes no association between the\nethnicities of husbands and wives. Model A-2 includes a parameter that allows for\nhomogamy to be more or less common than expected from the marginal distributions.\nModel A-3 allows for the numbers of couples to vary by time period, but doesn't\ninclude a homogamy parameter. Model A-4 includes additive effects of time period and\nhomogamy. Model A-5 includes an interaction between time period and homogamy. If\nthe extent of homogamy changed over time, Model A-5 should be the best fit.\nTable 8: Models of ethnic assortative mating\nA-1: Marginals logF =  +  + \nA-2: A-1 + homogamy logF =  +  +  + p\nA-3: A-2 + time logF =  +  +  + \nA-4: A-1 \u00d7 time + homogamy logF =  +   +   + p\nA-5: A-2 \u00d7 time logF =  +   +   + p \nNotes: e  is husband's ethnicity,  is wife's ethnicity,  is time period, p = 1 if i = j (p = 0 otherwise).\nTable 9 presents the test statistics. While we present both G and BIC for the\nmodels of ethnic assortative marriage, we will focus on BIC as our main criterion for\ngoodness of fit. The G statistic is the deviance for the model. As the fit of the model\nimproves, the deviance will approach 0. The BIC statistics adjust the likelihood ratios\nL for sample size. The smaller the value of BIC, the better the fit of the model to the\ndata (Raftery 1986). If this assumption is true, the deviance will approach 0. The\ndegrees of freedom equal the number of cells in the table minus the number of model\nTable 9: Goodness-of-fit tests for log-linear models of assortative marriage,\nModels df G2 BIC\n956 http://www.demographic-research.org\nAs might be expected from Table 10, homogamy was an important feature of\nmarriage in Shuangcheng, and its intensity changed over time. Whereas the BIC for\nincludes a parameter that allows for homogamous marriages to be more or less common\nthan other pairings, and the reduction in BIC reproduces the patterns in the data better\nthan Model A-1, even after accounting for the use of additional degrees of freedom.\nModel A-5, which allows for the extent of homogamy to change over time, has an even\nsmaller BIC: 26. Overall, Model A-5 best fits the data.\nOdds ratios computed from these models confirm that homogamy declined over\nof a homogamous marriage within either group were 2.6 those of the odds of a\nheterogamous marriage. This parameter declined to 2.46 and 1.97 in the next two\ncommon over time and homogamy less common is consistent with the logistic\nregression results in Table 6, but the approach here rules out the possibility that the\ntrend in Table 6 was caused by changes in the composition of the marriage market.\nTable 10: Odds ratios: Homogamy vs. heterogamy among newlywed couples,\nTime period Odds ratio\nHomogamy/heterogamy\nThe odds ratios for homogamy appear much lower than in other populations where\nracial or ethnic homogamy is common. While odds ratios are not directly comparable\nacross studies because of differences in model specification, a review of published\nresults is nevertheless highly suggestive in that the odds ratios for homogamy in\nShuangcheng are simply not in the same range as ones reported in other settings where\nrace or ethnicity is generally acknowledged to be a major boundary for marriage. In the\nUnited States in 1980 and 1990, the odds ratios for a white being married to another\nwhite were between 3 and 4, and the odds ratios for an African American being married\nfor homogamy among Russians and Latvians in Latvia in the late 20th century were\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 34\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 957\nratios for homogamy computed for all the combinations of eight ethnic groups in eight\ndifferent regions, only four were lower than 3 (Botev 1994: 473). The majority were\nmuch higher.\n6. Conclusion\nTo our knowledge, this study is both one of the first quantitative analyses of ethnic\nintermarriage in a historical Chinese population and one of a relatively small number of\nstudies of ethnic intermarriage for any Chinese population, historical or modern. It\ncontributes to our understanding of ethnic boundaries in Qing China in an unusual\nsetting where Han and non-Han could intermarry without regard to prohibitions against\nmarriage between banners and civilians. If similar studies of intermarriage elsewhere in\nQing China or among the peoples of other multiethnic agrarian empires become\navailable, our study will hopefully act as a point of comparison that will yield new\ninsight into interactions not only between ethnic groups in China but also in agrarian\nempires more generally.\nThe results inform ongoing debates about the nature of ethnic identities and\nboundaries during the Qing by showing that in a setting where Han, Manchus, and\nothers were not affected by the prohibitions against marriage between banner and non-\nbanner populations that largely prevented them from marrying elsewhere in China,\nthere is little evidence of a strong aversion to ethnic intermarriage. Even though\nhomogamy was somewhat more likely than intermarriage, the gap was not nearly as\npronounced as in other historical populations widely noted for ethnic divisions that\nwere reflected in low rates of intermarriage. In Shuangcheng during the late 19th\ncentury, ethnicity by itself was not so salient a boundary that when it came to decisions\nabout marriage it led to patterns suggestive of racial and ethnic divides.\nOther findings about ethnic intermarriage in Shuangcheng are particularly\nnoteworthy. First, the chances of intermarriage increased over time. This may have\nbeen the result of a number of factors. The non-Han may have become steadily less\nprivileged in the last decades of the Qing, so that status homogamy no longer\ncontributed to ethnic homogamy. Within Shuangcheng, other boundaries between Han\nand non-Han in terms of identity and perceived differences that affected marriage\nchoices may also have been eroding. While the persistence of a mild tendency toward\nhomogamy indicates that boundaries between groups didn't disappear completely, it\n8 While the odds ratios in Figure 2 in Monden and Smits (2005) are labeled \"intermarriage odd ratios,\" the\ninterpretation in the accompanying text suggests that they are odds ratios for homogamy, since the decline\nover time is presented as a sign of increasing intermarriage.\n958 http://www.demographic-research.org\nmay be either that there was some assimilation or that behaviors and customs remained\ndistinct but that these differences were simply not considered important. Second, we\nfind some evidence that is consistent with the hypothesis based on status exchange\ntheory that high-status non-Han were less likely to intermarry.\nFinally, there were interactions between registered ethnicity and ethnic aspiration\nor affiliation expressed by choice of name or previous marriage choices. Ethnicity, in\nother words, was not solely the product of official registration, but also in some cases\nan expression of affiliation or aspiration that was aligned to registered ethnicity but not\nidentical to it. Within groups defined by registered ethnicity, the tendency to intermarry\nvaried according to whether there was a family history of intermarriage, suggesting\npersistent differences within groups in the definition of boundaries and the willingness\nto cross those boundaries. Men registered as Han with a mother whose surname was\nnon-Han were themselves more likely to marry a non-Han wife. Conversely, men\nregistered as non-Han whose mother had a Han maiden name were more likely to marry\na Han wife. Among the Han, family ethnic aspiration or affiliation, as reflected in the\nchoice of a non-Han given name, also influenced marriage choices. For Han men,\nhaving a non-Han given name was associated with elevated chances of marrying a non-\nHan wife.\nThe study also raises a number of questions that can be answered only with an\nanalysis that considers the socioeconomic and other characteristics of husbands and\nwives simultaneously by linking wives to their natal households and extracting relevant\ninformation about their family of origin. Our indirect approach based on the ethnicity\nimplied by the wife's maiden name precludes consideration of the wife's background\nand limits us to a `one-sided' analysis in which we consider only the influence of the\nhusband's characteristics on his chances of intermarriage. The ideal approach would be\n`two-sided' and examine how male and female socioeconomic and other characteristics\njointly influence the chances that they will intermarry. Among other things, this would\nallow for disentanglement of the influences of jingqi/tunding status and ethnicity, and\npermit a more refined assessment of the relevant of Merton's (1941) status exchange\ntheory. More generally, it would allow for a direct examination of the interaction of\nhusband's and wife's family landholding, socioeconomic status, ethnic registration, and\njingqi/tunding status on intermarriage. Our efforts to develop a robust approach in order\nto link wives with their natal households is still ongoing and we hope to revisit these\nissues in future work.\nDemographic Research: Volume 38, Article 34\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 959\n7.
