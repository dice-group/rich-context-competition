No study has attempted to\nexamine and compare classes of nursery products\nby using a nationally representative sample.\nWhat This Study Adds: This study is the first to\nuse nationally representative data to investigate the\nepidemiology of injuries associated with a broad\nrange of nursery products among young children.\nThe rise in these injuries since 2003 warrants\nincreased injury prevention efforts.\nGaw et al\nNearly every household in the United\nStates with a newborn or young child\nuses nursery products, which include\ninfant furniture, barriers, walkers,\ndevices, and equipment used for\ntransporting, bathing, or caring for\na child. These products are intended\nto help parents raise their children.\nHowever, nursery products can pose\na threat to the well-being of young\nchildren, especially if the products do\nnot meet current safety standards.\nproducts were the leading category\nof children's products recalled in the\nUnited State,\n\u00ad\n4 and they account\nfor millions of dangerous products\nfound in US households.5,\n\nproducts are known to be a source\nof child injuries7 and deaths.8,\n\ndepartment (ED) visits by children <5\nyears old attributable to nursery\nFew studies have evaluated injuries\nassociated with multiple classes of\nnursery products among infants and\nchildren, including 1 small study in a\nnon-US population.11 Most previous\nepidemiologic studies focus on\ninjuries associated with 1 or several\nproducts in a single product class,\nsuch as strollers,\n\u00ad\nwalkers,\n\u00ad20 and baby bottles,\nusing both regional and national data.\nNursery product safety is a critical\nyet challenging issue in injury\nprevention, complicated by the\nrapid anatomic, motor, and cognitive\ndevelopment of young children as\nwell as injury profiles unique to\nspecific products based on their\n\n22 Identification of\ninjury characteristics and patterns\nassociated with nursery products is\ntherefore essential in pinpointing\nareas of greatest concern for\ncaregivers, health care providers,\nmanufacturers, and policy makers.\nThe objective of the present study\nwas to determine the epidemiology of\ninjuries associated with a wide array\nof nursery products among young\nchildren treated in US EDs. To our\nknowledge, this study is the first to\ncomprehensively investigate nursery\nproduct\u00adrelated injuries by using a\nnationally representative sample.\nMethods\nData Source\nThe National Electronic Injury\nSurveillance System (NEISS),\nis operated by the US Consumer\nProduct Safety Commission (CPSC),\nmonitors consumer product\u00adrelated\nand sports and recreational activity\u00ad\nrelated injuries treated in US EDs.24\nincluding 8 children's hospitals,\ncontribute to the NEISS, which\nrepresents a stratified probability\n24-hour ED with at least 6 beds in the\nUnited States and its territories.25,\n\nProfessional NEISS coders abstract\ninformation from ED medical records,\nincluding patient demographic\ncharacteristics, the consumer product\ninvolved, injury diagnosis, affected\nbody region, disposition from the ED,\nand a brief narrative regarding the\ncircumstances of the incident.27\nNursery product\u00adrelated injuries\namong children aged <3 years\nreported through the NEISS\nretrospectively analyzed. Nursery\nproduct\u00adrelated injuries were\nidentified by using 39 discrete\nNEISS consumer product codes\n(Supplemental Information),\nwhich were based on the product\ncodes included in the CPSC annual\nreport on nursery product\u00adrelated\ninjuries and deaths.10 Each case\nnarrative was then examined, and\ncases were excluded if the injury\ndid not involve a nursery product\nor involved a motor vehicle crash,\ndiaper rash, animal bite, dermatitis,\nor conjunctivitis. The final data set\nStudy Variables\nNEISS case narratives were\nindividually reviewed to identify\nthe mechanism of injury, which\nwas classified as follows: (1) fell\nspontaneously or due to actions of\nthe patient; (2) fell due to actions\nof another person; (3) collision\nwith or while using the product; (4)\nbreathing related; (5) entrapment;\n(6) product failure, which includes\nproduct collapse or malfunction; (7)\ningestion; (8) nonfatal submersion;\nand (9) other. In instances in which\nmechanisms of injury overlapped, the\ninitial event in a sequence of events\nwas considered the mechanism of\ninjury. NEISS consumer product\ncodes were regrouped into 12 major\ncategories of nursery products,\nsimilar to categories used by the\nCPSC (Supplemental Information).10\nThe NEISS variable for age was\nregrouped into 0 to 5 months, 6 to\nInjury diagnosis was categorized as\nfollows: (1) ingestion; (2) aspiration;\n(3) burn; (4) laceration (including\nthe NEISS categories of amputation,\nlaceration, puncture, and nondental\navulsion); (5) concussion/closed\nhead injury (CHI), including internal\norgan injury to the head; (6) soft\ntissue injury, including crushing,\ncontusion/abrasion, hematoma,\nand strain/sprain; (7) anoxia/\nsubmersion; (8) fracture; (9) dental\ninjury; or (10) other, including\ndislocation, foreign body, nerve\ndamage, hemorrhage, electric shock,\npoisoning, internal organ injury to\nnon-head body regions, and other.\nBody region was grouped into: (1)\nupper extremity, including shoulder,\nelbow, upper arm, lower arm,\nwrist, hand, and finger; (2) lower\nextremity, including knee, upper\nleg, lower leg, ankle, foot, and toe;\n(3) trunk, including upper trunk,\nlower trunk, and pubic region;\n(4) head/neck; (5) face, including\nface, eye, mouth, and ear; and (6)\nother, including injury to >25%\nof the body. Disposition from the\nED was categorized as: (1) treated\nand released; (2) hospitalized,\nincluding NEISS categories of\ntreated and transferred, treated and\nadmitted, and held for <24 hours for\nobservation; (3) left against medical\nadvice; and (4) fatality. Location\nof injury was grouped into home\n(including home, apartment/condo,\nand manufactured/mobile home) and\nother. Additional variables analyzed\nincluded sex and year.\nStatistical Analysis\nData were analyzed by using SPSS\nversion 20.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics,\nIBM Corporation) and SAS 9.3 (SAS\nInstitute, Inc, Cary, NC) statistical\nsoftware.

Future research is warranted\nto assess the effects of this important\nconsumer product legislation on\nnursery product\u00adrelated injuries to\nchildren.\nGiven the success of interventions\nto prevent injuries associated\nwith baby walkers, including\nstrengthened safety standards and\nnew safer product design,\n\nGaw et al\nefforts should be used to address\ninjuries associated with other\nnursery products, especially the top\ncontributors to pediatric morbidity\nin this study: baby carriers, cribs/\nmattresses, and strollers/carriages.\nBaby carriers were the leading\nsource of nursery product\u00adrelated\ninjuries and hospital admissions.\nBaby carrier\u00adrelated falls involving\ncaregivers may lead to more severe\ninjuries due to factors such as\nthe caregiver falling on top of the\nchild or propelling the child with\nadditional momentum during a fall.34\nTo reduce the likelihood of these\ninjuries, caregivers should attempt\nto keep living spaces free of objects\nthat pose a tripping hazard. Child\ncaregivers using a carrier should\nminimize the use of stairs and\nrefrain from carrying other objects\nwhile on the stairs, using the free\nhand to grasp the handrail.35 Infants\nshould be matched to carriers that\nare appropriate for their size and\nNearly one-third of product failures\nwere associated with baby carriers,\nwhich included instances of handle\ndetachment and product collapse.\nBaby carrier seats, especially\ndetachable car seats, should be\ncarefully inspected before infant\ntransport. Any supporting devices\nand carrier handles should be\nlocked into position before moving\nan infant or child.37 Carrier seats also\npose an additional hazard of injuries\ndue to unattended falls, which\nare associated with placement\nof seats on elevated surfaces.34,\n\nInfants in carrier seats should\nalways be secured using the safety\nharness straps provided, and carriers\nshould be equipped with nonskid\nundersides. Caregivers should\nnot place carrier seats on slippery\nsurfaces, such as glass tables, or on\nsoft surfaces, such as beds, where a\ntip over could lead to suffocation.37\nCribs/mattresses were the second\nmost common source of injury and\nwere associated with the majority of\nnursery product\u00adrelated fatalities.\nPrevious literature provides evidence\nthat cribs are a leading nursery\nproduct associated with infant\n\n\n39 It is likely that\nsudden unexpected infant death\naccounted for many of these fatalities\nin our study as well as in others.\nSleep environment hazards play a\nkey role in infant injury, especially\nsudden unexpected infant death,\nand health care practitioners should\ncounsel caregivers to not place\nbumper pads or soft objects, such\nas blankets or pillows, in the crib\nbecause of the risk of strangulation,\nCaregivers should only use the firm,\nsnugly fitting mattress designed\nfor their crib and never use\nsupplemental mattresses, which may\nincrease the risk of entrapment and\nsuffocation.\nCrib bumper pads have been\nmarketed as protective barriers to\nreduce entrapment injuries, and\nsome organizations, such as the\nJuvenile Products Manufacturers\nAssociation, maintain that bumper\npads are safe.40 However, multiple\nfatalities attributable to bumper pad\u00ad\nrelated suffocation or strangulation\nhave been reported.41,\n\nthe American Academy of Pediatrics\nhas recommended against bumper\nThe city of Chicago45 and the state\nof Maryland46 have taken these\nrecommendations further, banning\nthe sale of bumper pads. Despite\nthese public policy efforts, bumper\npads can still be found in Chicago,\nand more needs to be done at the\nnational level to limit the sale and use\nof crib bumper pads.\nStrollers/carriages were the\nthird-leading source of nursery\nproduct\u00adrelated injuries. Tip overs\nand falls involving strollers have\nbeen described as the predominant\nmechanism of injury in the\nliterature,\n\n\nneed for caregivers to avoid taking\nstrollers on stairs, hanging objects\non stroller handles, and allowing\nother children to play with or\nhang onto a stroller while a child\nis inside.36 These measures should\nbe combined with safety belt use,\nwhich previous studies suggest is low\namong injured children.49 In a report\ndescribing stroller-related injuries in\nQueensland, Australia, researchers\nnoted that 8% of fall injuries were\ndue to the stroller rolling away\nfrom the caregiver.48 The injury risk\nfrom stroller-roll-away could be\nmitigated through the installation of\na \"dead man brake,\n\" similar to those\non airport trolleys. Manufacturers\nshould be encouraged to place these\nconditional braking systems on child\nstrollers and carriages.\nAlmost 90% of injuries occurred at\nhome, and 80% of injuries were due\nto a fall. Therefore, prevention efforts\nshould focus on fall prevention in\nthe home setting. Strategies for\npreventing falls include the following:\n(1) use of products' safety devices,\nsuch as a strap or harness; (2)\nappropriate adult supervision; and\n(3) proper assembly/installation and\nuse of products, such as adjusting the\nmattress height in a crib to prevent\na child from climbing out. We also\nfound that young children were more\nlikely to injure their head and neck or\nbe diagnosed with a concussion/CHI,\nwhereas older children were more\nlikely to injure an upper extremity or\nbe diagnosed with a laceration. This\nfinding is most like due to children's\ndevelopmental changes and how\nthis development specifically affects\nhow they fall. Young children have\ndisproportionately large heads,\nwhich provides a larger target for\ninjury and also raises their center\nof gravity. These children tend to\nlead with their head when they fall\nand are unable to break their fall\nwith their arms because of lack of\ncoordination and strength. As they\nget older, they use their arms more\neffectively to protect their heads but\nhave more upper extremity injuries\nSeveral limitations exist in this study.\nThe number of nursery product\u00ad\nrelated injuries was underestimated\nbecause only cases treated in EDs\nwere included. Injuries treated\nin urgent care centers and other\nnon-ED medical facilities are not\ncaptured by the NEISS. Fatalities\nare also underreported in the\nNEISS because prehospital deaths\nmay not be transported to an ED,\nand fatal patient outcomes after\nhospital admission are not captured\nin the NEISS database. The findings\nof this study, therefore, may not\nbe representative of all nursery\nproduct\u00adrelated injuries. In addition,\nNEISS case narratives are limited by\nthe amount of detail included in ED\nmedical records. Narratives may not\nconsistently provide information\nabout injury mechanism, factors\ncontributing to the injury event,\nand which product was primarily\ninvolved in the injury if multiple\nproducts were listed. Information\nregarding socioeconomic status was\nunavailable. It is possible that some\nof these injuries were the result\nof child maltreatment. Because\nmultivariate analyses were not\nperformed, our results do not reflect\nthe potential influence of covariates\non the relationships examined.\nDespite these limitations, the\nstrength of this study lies in its use\nof a large, nationally representative\nsample over a period of 21 years\nthat includes product-specific\ninformation.\nConclusions\nTo our knowledge, this study\nis the first to use a nationally\nrepresentative database to examine\npediatric injuries associated with\na wide array of nursery products.\nAlthough nursery product\u00adrelated\ninjury prevention efforts with baby\nwalkers, these injuries increased\nduring the final 8 years of the study\nwarranted to prevent injuries\nassociated with other nursery\nproducts, especially baby carriers,\ncribs, and strollers. Prevention of falls\nand concussions/CHIs associated\nwith nursery products also deserves\nspecial attention. Future studies that\nfurther examine the circumstances of\nnursery product\u00adrelated injuries and\nevaluate current safety interventions\nare needed to help inform the\ndevelopment of effective prevention\nstrategies.\nReferences\nKids In Danger.
