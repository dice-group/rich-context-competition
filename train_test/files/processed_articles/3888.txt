Pollen analysis is a\nversatile, established, and widely used technique (Lowe &\nranging from environmental reconstructions to forensic evi-\ndence. Due to this diversity, we have chosen pollen analysis\nto exhibit the advantages of using EcoCount. Identifying,\ncounting, and recording pollen grains and spores remain a\nhighly skilled, time-consuming, and demanding task\n(Stillman & Flenley, 1996). Standard techniques necessitate\nthe classification and recording of between 300 and 500 pol-\nlen grains from each representative sample. The quality and\nquantity of the preserved pollen vary, and attaining the mini-\nmum number of pollen grains can involve counting numer-\nous slides. Green (1997) suggested the \"sheer time and effort\ninvolved in counting pollen\" as a significant obstacle to the\nprogression and development of high-resolution pollen stud-\nies (France, Duller, & Lamb, 2000). Furthermore, Green\n(1997) correctly encouraged resolving methodological\nimpediments in pollen analysis (palynology) as a high prior-\nity and was an advocate of automation. Although automated\npollen counting systems have been proposed and are\ncontinuing to be developed (e.g., Allen et al., 2006; Costa &\nthese systems appears not to have been fully realized or\nembraced by the palynology and wider environmental com-\nmunity. The reasons for this have ranged from expense of the\nsystems, reliability and accuracy issues, and simple reluc-\ntance of the palynology community to embrace a radical\nchange to their technique/field. However, efforts have been\nmade to develop user-friendly low cost systems to facilitate\nwider availability (e.g., Costa & Yang, 2009). Until a fully\nreliable and financially accessible system is available, simple\nchanges within the pollen analysis methodology can improve\nthe efficiency of the palynologist.\nThere are many steps in the process of pollen analysis that\ndo make the technique a labor-intensive and a time-consum-\ning activity. Procedural steps such as chemical treatments\nduring the sample preparation process are essential and can-\nnot be removed or rushed, for example, spinning to remove\nwater prior to acetylation. However, with\n1Frostburg State University, MD, USA\n2Dynamica Solutions, Helston, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nPhillip P.

Allen1 and Neil Sewell2\n Keywords\nefficient, automated, voice recognition, user-friendly, versatile\n2 SAGE Open\nprocedural experience, the preparation of samples can be\nrelatively efficient. Yet once the laboratory preparation phase\nhas been successfully completed, there is ample opportunity\nfor improvement of the current procedure. One specific area\nfor enhancement is the actual data recording of the identified\npollen and spores. Once the palynologist has identified the\npollen grain or spore, the data along with ancillary informa-\ntion such as preservation condition, presence of charcoal, or\nthe preparation spike (e.g., lycopodium) are entered onto a\ncount sheet. The use of a paper count sheet remains a com-\nmon occurrence for the palynologist and is often augmented\nby a number of hand tally counters (analogue and digital)\nthat have been designated a specific pollen type.\nComputerized count sheets utilizing software such as\nMicrosoft Excel have been used and remove the data entry\nstep into subsequent programs such as Tilia/TGView\nthe primary pollen data represents an inefficient step in the\npalynologist's routine.\nCurrently, recording pollen types requires the palynolo-\ngists to look away from the microscope, find the correct taxa\non the sheet/tally counter/cell, and physically enter data,\nwhich over the duration of a full count represents a signifi-\ncant inefficient use of time.\nWe acknowledge that the process of physically recording\nthe pollen allows the palynologist to further engage and\nbecome familiar with the evolving data set, which develops a\ndeeper connectivity to the results. Yet, constantly breaking\ncontact with the field of view remains a cumulative ineffi-\ncient use of time. Therefore, if a record of the identified pol-\nlen could be constructed while the palynologist continues to\nengage with the field of view and connects to the developing\ndata set, it would make one aspect of the pollen counting\nprocedure more efficient and economical. The process of\nmanually transferring data from the count sheet into a spread-\nsheet or directly into programs such as Tilia/TGView\nical data recording and transfer could be eliminated from the\nprocedure, it would save further time and remove an ineffi-\ncient step in the working-up of pollen data.\nEcoCount--The Advantage of the New\nDigital Approach to Environmental\nData Recording\nAn alternative technique that improves efficiency for data\nrecording and transfer is presented here. The EcoCount pro-\ngram is a voice activated automated computer program.\nEcoCount uses the Microsoft Speech Application\nProgrammers Interface (API) to perform both listening and\nspeech synthesis. The API enables the software to record the\nuser's voice and parse the recorded sound to identify key-\nwords and phrases. EcoCount uses these words and phrases\nand interprets the user's requirement, for instance, by\nincrementing the count of a particular type of pollen. The\nconfiguration (Figure 1) can be via a headset or freestanding\nmicrophone where the palynologist tells the computer what\nto record. In addition, EcoCount uses the Microsoft API to\nenable a talkback function so that the software can engage\nwith the palynologist either through the speakers or head-\nphones. On recognition of a phrase such as \"Count Tilia,\nCount Good,\" the talkback function says what the computer\nhas understood in the form of \"Count Tilia, Count Good.\"\nThis informs the palynologist of the action and enables him\nor her to undo that count if necessary by saying the command\n\"Edit undo.\"\nEcoCount operates on a simple spreadsheet format, with\neach taxon listed in individual cells. These cells can be\nincluded or excluded from the total count via a tick box being\nactivated. The palynologist first creates a dictionary of taxa\nby adding in all the pollen and spore types they expect to\nobserve. Once the dictionary has been created, this can be\nkept as a template file for expedient deployment in succes-\nsive counts. Subsequent taxa types can be quickly added in\nduring the counting and identification phase. The taxa names\nare entered into the sheet, via the sub menu (Figure 2).\nFollowing the addition of new pollen type(s), the program is\nthen restarted and the computer will instantly recognize and\nuse the recently added pollen type.\nThe data can be entered into the spreadsheet via two ways.\nFirst, manually--The palynologist adds information by\nlooking up each taxon in the spreadsheet and uses a mouse to\ninput the value.\nEach taxa cell can be increased and decreased by an incre-\nment of one, when the curser is placed on the corresponding\ntaxa row and double clicked. If a value has been entered into\nthe wrong cell, right click and choose decrement. This pro-\ncess of physically finding the correct taxa remains relatively\nFigure 1. Equipment configuration, illustrating headset with\nmicrophone linked to a laptop computer running EcoCount.\nAllen and Sewell 3\ninefficient but does generate a digital file, which makes data\nThe spreadsheet can list the taxa in alphabetical order, which\nis optional, and also has a time stamp displayed to tell the\npalynologist when the last values were added into a cell. Yet\nthis method represents time and resource management issues,\nand is not the preferential use of EcoCount.\nSecond, automatically--Information is added via the\nvoice recognition option within EcoCount.\nThe palynologist turns on the listening function and tells\nthe computer what pollen or spores and their preservation\ncondition the operator has identified, for example, \"count\nBetula\" and \"count Good.\" The palynologist prefixes the\nword that he or she wants the computer to record with the\ncommand \"count\"; this makes the computer listen at a spe-\ncific time. Even if the EcoCount program is left unattended\nin \"listen\" mode, the computer will not record data until the\n\"count\" command is heard; this function reduces the chance\nof background noise being mistakenly recorded by the com-\nputer and attributed to a pollen taxon. Each time a pollen\ntype is spoken, it is automatically added into the correspond-\ning taxa cell in the spreadsheet, by an increment of one.\nThere is a playback function that repeats the last taxa and\npreservation condition recorded by the computer\nto the palynologist; this function insures the correct taxa is\nrecognized and recorded by the computer. Therefore, if it\nwas a mistake, the command \"edit undo,\" removes the last\ntaxa added in. New taxa can be added into the spreadsheet at\nany time during the count following a simple save and restart\nprocedure. Therefore, identification of taxa not included in\nthe original dictionary template is not an issue. All pollen\ntypes recorded are automatically entered into a total count\ntally; thus, the palynologist knows when the minimal count\ngoal has been met. Cells for the pollen preservation and\nunidentified pollen grains are located within the spreadsheet\nwindow (Figure 2); however, these values are not included in\nthe total count. The preservation nomenclature of Good,\nCrumpled, Corroded, and Ruptured used in EcoCount has\nfollowed the categories proposed by Jones et al (2007). Due\nto the unfamiliar marriage of botanical names and a synthetic\nvoice, there is a \"read word\" function that allows the opera-\ntor to hear how the computer listens to words.\nDiscussion\nThe software described here for recording pollen is user-\nfriendly, accurate, consistent, and very efficient. Following\ninitial development, this program was tested and used within\nFigure 2. An example of the EcoCount spreadsheet.\n4 SAGE Open\na university and private consultancy laboratory setting, and\nwe find EcoCount to be a very robust and dependable piece\nof software. One logistical distinction of this package is the\nease with which it can be loaded onto a Mac and PC plat-\nform. The simple application of this software to pre-existing\nlaboratory computers renders purchases of specific comput-\ners redundant. In addition, when a computer is upgraded or\nchanged, the transfer of this software is a relatively simple\nprocess. Once installed, the ease at which the investigator\ncan become expert makes EcoCount more efficient and\neffective than the traditional data recording techniques. The\noral connection with the software means the investigator\ncontinues to interact with the growing data set, and by\ndefault, this action allows the time for the data to be mentally\nworked up by the investigator prior to the completed spread-\nsheet stage. This continued level of data interaction assures\nthat familiarity with the range of pollen grains is vigorous\nand unexpected occurrences can be readily identified and\nexplored. The digital count sheet is saved as a .txt file, which\ncan be quickly opened in Excel, which in turn can be opened\nor imported directly into Tilia/TGView (Grimm, 1992,\n2004). We find that the playback feature, where the computer\nimmediately repeats the last recorded name, was exception-\nally useful as it allows real-time error correction. Many\nresearchers have been tired when operating a microscope and\nrecorded something different to what was identified. Real-\ntime oral playback for correct data recording is a more effec-\ntive method for reduction of error compared with manual\nrecording, where a mark is made against the wrong box or\nthe wrong counter is selected, producing a false record that\ncan result in potentially serious consequences. In addition,\nerrors created by the operator have been known to occur dur-\ning the process of manually transferring the data from a\npaper count sheet record into a spreadsheet or directly into\nfeature is a simple safeguard that allows users the chance to\nrealize their mistakes before it becomes a permanent error.\nThe playback function also established a reinforced connec-\ntivity with the data that allowed the user to develop a detailed\nand comprehensive mental picture of the developing data set.\nWhen an entry into the spreadsheet is made, the time is also\nrecorded. Therefore, we have begun to generate a pollen map\nof the microscope slide. Analysis of the time stamp map may\nreveal hitherto unobserved patterns of preferential pollen\ndispersal in different materials, for example, silicon and\nglycerin. We imagine that the best form of potential develop-\nment for this software, applications, and functions must\ncome from the community of users. The advantage of using\nthe EcoCount program is that digital copies are instantly pro-\nduced while counting and therefore, make the operation of\ndata inputting from paper count sheets redundant. The pro-\nduction of digital files also allows collation of data for stor-\nage and archiving very simple and files can be placed within\nsecure storage as a routine end of day activity. EcoCount was\ndesigned with pollen analysis in mind; however, due to the\nease of entering taxonomic names into the cells, the program\ncan be adapted for any type of counting analysis, for exam-\nple, diatoms, foraminifera, and plant macrofossils.\nDemonstrating a quantified increase in efficiency during a\npollen count due to using EcoCount has been exceptionally\ndifficult. To date, replicating a pollen count to compare using\nEcoCount against traditional recording methods has been\nunsuccessful. Pollen samples can be immersed in silica oil to\nbe viewed on a microscope slide. The silica fluid is a mate-\nrial that allows the palynologist to physically rotate grains\nthrough 360\u00b0 planes to observe subtle characteristics that aid\nidentification. When pollen are rotated, one consequence is\nthat the grains often move to different locations on the micro-\nscope slide, especially if the cover slip is not sealed into\nplace. Therefore, attempting to identify and count the exact\nsame grains has been remarkably challenging. Replicating a\npollen count is possible; however, the emphasis of these tests\nhas been to compare the sums of each identified taxon to\nexamine the pollen ratios per slide. Therefore, quantitate\ncomparative analysis of the time allocation for the different\nrecording techniques are problematic. Consequently, we\nhave used a qualitative account based on feedback from use\nof EcoCount in an academic and private consultancy labora-\ntory environment. The view was that using EcoCount saved\ntime during the recording phase of the pollen count and by\nnot turning away from the microscope, the feeling of fatigue\nat the end of a count session was reduced.\nConclusion\nUntil a full automated, reliable, and economically viable pol-\nlen counting package is readily available, pollen analysis\nwill remain a labor-intensive and time-consuming activity. If\nan adaptation to a procedural technique is utilized, the effi-\nciency of the process can be improved. Identification of the\npalynomorph can be a time sink; however, methods for\nrecording the information can and have been improved. A\ncurrent widely used technique for data capture is time-con-\nsuming and prone to error. Although we acknowledge the\nvalue of basic technology, pen and paper, EcoCount repre-\nsents a procedural adaptation that can make one facet of pol-\nlen analysis more effective and economical. The adoption of\na voice activated fully customizable digital count sheet\nallows the investigator the opportunity to remain engaged\nwith the critical task, identification, for longer, utilizing his\nor her efforts more efficiently. EcoCount is economical as\nthe trial version is free, and a full license is less than US$20.\nThe versatility of the EcoCount software package allows the\ninvestigator to remain interactive with the developing data\nset and has functions that can reduce the potential for errors\nbeing recorded in the data set. The continued engagement\nwith the data set allows the investigator the time and oppor-\ntunity to work up a mental picture of the data present on the\nslide or within the sample. The digital file format further\nenhances simple and expedient data transfer and storage.\nAllen and Sewell 5\nSoftware that can be loaded onto different computer plat-\nforms makes the adoption by users and laboratories simple\nand inexpensive. The user-friendly format of EcoCount\nallows any novice to be competent and functional in a very\nshort and efficient time. With use by the counting commu-\nnity, product development can be achieved to make this soft-\nware a better and more powerful laboratory tool and even\nmore user-friendly.\nAuthors' Note\nA download and instruction guide of EcoCount can be found at\nwww.dynamicasolutions.co.uk and follow the software link.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAllen, G.P., Hodgson, R.M, Marsland, S.R., Arnold, G.
