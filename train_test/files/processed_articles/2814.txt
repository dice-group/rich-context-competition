Hamby, PhD\nViolence against children continues to grow as a salient\nissue in national and international public health and\npublic policy discussions.1,2 However, epidemiology to\naccurately describe the problem and track trends continues to\nbe a stumbling block in the United States and elsewhere. Avail-\nable data have not resolved disagreements about whether\nphysical abuse of children in the United States has been\nincreasing3-5 or decreasing6 or whether bullying is an\nepidemic7,8 or on the decline.9 A recent National Academies\nPress report pointed to problems in the epidemiology of child\nmaltreatment and called for a \"high-quality, population-\nbased,epidemiologicalsurveillancesystemthatdrawsonmul-\ntiple data sources.\"10\nThe most important recent initiative to improve child mal-\ntreatment epidemiology is a joint effort of the US Department\nof Justice and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\ninitiated in 2008 entitled the National Survey of Children's Ex-\nposure to Violence (NatSCEV).11 Repeated assessments have\navailability of this surveillance system means that policy mak-\ners and health care professionals can have current informa-\ntion on prevalences and trends. The NatSCEV provides ongo-\ningnationalestimatesofawiderangeofviolenceagainstyouth,\nincluding the only national source of information about crimes\nagainst children younger than 12 years that are not reported\nto authorities.\nIMPORTANCE It is important to estimate the burden of and trends for violence, crime, and\nabuse in the lives of children.\nOBJECTIVE To provide health care professionals, policy makers, and parents with current\nestimates of exposure to violence, crime, and abuse across childhood and at different\ndevelopmental stages.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence\n(NatSCEV) includes a representative sample of US telephone numbers from August 28, 2013,\n17 years old, with information about exposure to violence, crime, and abuse provided by\nyouth 10 to 17 years old and by caregivers for children 0 to 9 years old.\nMAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE Exposure to violence, crime, and abuse using the Juvenile\nVictimization Questionnaire.\nRESULTS In total, 37.3% of youth experienced a physical assault in the study year, and 9.3% of\nyouth experienced an assault-related injury. Two percent of girls experienced sexual assault\nor sexual abuse in the study year, while the rate was 4.6% for girls 14 to 17 years old. Overall,\n15.2% of children and youth experienced maltreatment by a caregiver, including 5.0% who\nexperienced physical abuse. In total, 5.8% witnessed an assault between parents. Only 2\nsignificant rate changes could be detected compared with the last survey in 2011, namely,\ndeclines in past-year exposure to dating violence and lifetime exposure to household theft.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Children and youth are exposed to violence, abuse, and crime\nin varied and extensive ways, which justifies continued monitoring and prevention efforts.\nSupplemental content at\njamapediatrics.com\nAuthor Affiliations: Crimes Against\nChildren Research Center, University\nof New Hampshire, Durham\n(Finkelhor, Turner, Shattuck);\nDepartment of Psychology, Sewanee\u00ad\nThe University of the South,\nSewanee, Tennessee (Hamby).\nCorresponding Author: David\nFinkelhor, PhD, Crimes Against\nChildren Research Center, University\nof New Hampshire, 125 McConnell\nHall, 15 Academic Way, Durham, NH\nResearch\nOriginal Investigation\n \nDownloaded From: http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc. User on 11/06/2015\n \nMethods\nParticipants\nThe NatSCEV 2014 was designed to obtain up-to-date inci-\ndence and prevalence estimates of a wide range of childhood\nviolence, crime, and abuse. It consists of a national sample of\nphonebytheemployeesofanexperiencedsurveyresearchfirm.\nTelephone interviewing is a cost-effective method11,13 that has\nbeen demonstrated to be comparable to in-person interviews\nin data quality, even for reports of exposure to violence, psy-\nchopathology, and other sensitive topics.14-19\nSample\nA nationwide sample was obtained using the following 4\nsources: (1) an address-based sample (ABS) of households from\nwhich cell phone and residential numbers could be dialed, (2)\na prescreened sample of households with children from re-\ncent national random-digit-dialed surveys, (3) a listed land-\nline sample (with a known child in the household based on\ncommercial lists), and (4) cell phone numbers drawn from a\ntargeted random-digit-dialed sample frame. This combina-\ntion of sampling frames was an effort to increase nationwide\ncoverage of households, including those served only by cell\nphone, while efficiently reaching households with children to\nobtain the desired number of completed interviews. Weights\nwere developed to account for differential probability of se-\nlection within and across the sampling frames and to adjust\nfor nonresponse.\nRecruitment\nThe ABS respondents received an advance letter for the study\nwithahouseholdinformationformtodetermineeligibilityand\nwillingness to participate in the study. In return, the house-\nhold would receive a $5 check and soon be called to conduct\nthe telephone interview for an additional $20.\nProcedure\nA short interview was conducted with an adult caregiver (usu-\nally a parent) to obtain family demographic information. One\nchild was then randomly selected from all eligible children liv-\ning in the household. If the selected child was 10 to 17 years\nold, the main telephone interview was conducted with the\nchild. Otherwise, the interview was conducted with the care-\ngiver who was most familiar with the child's daily routine and\nexperiences. Verbal informed consent was obtained from the\ncaregiver and youth, if interviewed.\nRespondents were promised complete confidentiality and\nwere paid $20 for their participation. The interviews, averag-\ning 60 minutes in length, were conducted in English or Span-\nish.Availableparticipantswithoutsuchlanguageskillswereex-\ncluded from the study.

All procedures were authorized by the Institutional Re-\nview Board of the University of New Hampshire.\nMeasurement\nInformation on children's exposure to violence was collected\nusing the 2013 version of the Juvenile Victimization\nyouth (eAppendix 1 in the Supplement) covering the following\n6 general areas: conventional crime, child maltreatment, peer\nandsiblingoffenses,sexualassault,witnessingandindirectex-\nposure to violence, and Internet offenses. Follow-up questions\nfor survey items gathered additional information about inci-\ndents,includingperpetratorcharacteristics,theuseofaweapon,\nwhether injury resulted, and whether the exposure type oc-\ncurredinthesameincidentasanothertype.Theitemsandtheir\nfollow-upquestionswereusedtoconstructaggregatetypes(eg,\nanyphysicalassault)andrescoredtypes(eg,physicalassaultby\na nonsibling peer) (eAppendix 2 in the Supplement).\nStatistical Analysis\nData analysis was conducted using a software program (STATA\n13; StataCorp LP), and sampling weights were incorporated by\nmeans of the program's set of \"svy\" commands for complex\nportions of children experiencing each type of episode in the\npast year and over their lifetime were calculated, and com-\nparisons by age and sex were conducted using cross-\ntabulations and 2 tests. Comparisons for overall past-year and\ncolumns of the tables) were made by pooling the data for both\nyears, calculating the proportion of children experiencing each\nepisode type by year and then conducting significance test-\ning on the differences between the 2 years' proportions. The\nJuvenileVictimizationQuestionnaireusedinNatSCEV2014in-\ncluded several new items not included in the earlier survey.\nRates shown for the NatSCEV 2014 reflect the incorporation\nof the new items, but comparisons with rates from 2011 were\nbased only on items that were used in both surveys.\nTable 6 summarizes the likelihood that children who ex-\nperienced one aggregate type of episode would experience an-\nother episode of a different type. Odds ratios listed in Table 6\nwere calculated using binomial logistic regressions that con-\ntrolled for age.\nAt a Glance\n\u00b7 We used a nationally representative sample of US telephone\ninformation on exposure to violence, crime, and abuse among\n\u00b7 More than one-third of the youth experienced a physical assault\nin the past year.\n\u00b7 One in 10 experienced an assault-related physical injury.\n\u00b7 One in 20 girls 14 to 17 years old experienced sexual assault or\nabuse.\n\u00b7 There were significant declines since 2011 in past-year exposure\nto dating violence and lifetime exposure to household theft.\nChildhood Prevalence of Exposure to Violence,   Original Investigation Research\n \nDownloaded From: http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc.

User on 11/06/2015\n \nthe ABS frame represented cell phone\u00adonly households, con-\nfirming our expectation that the ABS sampling design effec-\ntively captured this type of hard-to-reach household.\nNonresponse analyses were conducted to assess poten-\ntial differences between study respondents and individuals\nwhorefusedparticipationorwhocouldnotbecontacted.Over-\nall, the response propensity modeling25 suggested that adults\nwho refused to grant permission for the youth interview were\nmore likely to come from households with more educated par-\nents, healthier children, higher income, and less school or\nneighborhood violence or from families with children 10 to 12\nyears old (ie, individuals who were typically at lower risk).\nThese differences were rectified through weight calibration.\nWe also compared prevalence rates for 6 major types of of-\nfenses (property crime, peer or sibling offenses, sexual of-\nfenses, sexual assault, physical assault, and maltreatment)\nacross the sampling frames. There were no significant differ-\nences in any rates across the sampling frames, except for a\nslightly lower rate of peer or sibling offenses in the ABS frame\nrelative to the listed landline sample, likely due to the some-\nwhat younger age and fewer siblings in the ABS frame. Given\nthatmuchofthenonresponsewasowingtotheinabilitytocon-\ntact respondents after numerous call attempts, we also com-\npared exposure rates among respondents whom we were able\nto interview early in the contact process with respondents who\nwere interviewed later. Except for higher rates of sexual as-\nsault among the later responders, who were somewhat older\nyouth on average and thus expected to have higher rates, there\nwere no significant differences in prevalences reported. These\nanalyses and the adjustments made through weighting give us\nconfidence that nonresponse has not biased the survey.\nAssault\nMore than one-third of all youth (37.3%) experienced a physi-\ncal assault during the study year, primarily at the hands of sib-\nlings and peers (Table 1). An assault resulting in an injury oc-\ncurred to 9.3%. An assault by an adult occurred to 5.1%. We\nmeasured general bullying\u00adtype behaviors, without limiting\nTable 2.

Physical in-\ntimidation was highest for children younger than 10 years, and\nrelational aggression was highest for children 10 to 13 years old.\nInternet harassment was highest for children 14 to 17 years old.\nsault or intimidation also showed declines. However, only one\nsignificant.\nSexual Assault\nFive percent experienced a sexual offense in the past year, and\n1.4% experienced a sexual assault (Table 2). Sexual assault ex-\ncludes sexual harassment and comprises attempted and com-\npleted rape, plus contact sex offenses by adults and peers. It\nis equivalent to contact sexual abuse. Girls 14 to 17 years old\nwere the group at highest risk, 16.4% of whom experienced a\nsexual offense, and 4.6% experienced sexual assault or sexual\nabuse in the past year. Among this group, 4.4% had an at-\ntempted or completed rape, 11.5% experienced sexual harass-\nment, and 8.5% were exposed to an unwanted Internet sexual\nsolicitation in the past year.\nSexual assault is a form of childhood violence that is fre-\nquently measured in lifetime prevalence.

There was a non-\nsignificant increase of 1.4% in past-year maltreatment since\n2011. Two of the specific categories (physical abuse and emo-\ntional abuse) had nonsignificant increases, and neglect had a\nnonsignificant decrease.\nProperty Crime\nProperty crime is a reality for young people, as it is for adults,\nbut is rarely discussed by child safety and protection offi-\ncials.

The lifetime rate\nof witnessing any family assault among the oldest youth (14-17\nanother parent or partner in their lifetime. There were no sex\ndifferences. Children 10 years and older had witnessed more\npast-year violence than younger children.\nWitnessing a community assault was also frequent, oc-\ncurring in 18.4% of all youth in the past year and in 57.9% over\ntheir lifetime for the oldest youth. The rate of exposure to\nshootings was 13.4% for this oldest group of youth over their\nlifetime, while exposure to warfare was only 3.2%. Children\nand youth had also been exposed to household theft (5.4%) in\nthe past year, and 6.1% had experienced a bomb threat in their\nschool. Aggregate witnessing violence in the past year in-\ncreased nonsignificantly by 1.6% since 2011. Household theft\ndecreased nonsignificantly by 2.5% for the past year, but the\nlifetime decrease of 4.7% was statistically significant. School\nthreats increased nonsignificantly by 2.4%.\nMultiple Exposures\nIt was common for children and youth to be exposed to mul-\ntiple types of episodes over the course of a year. In total, 40.9%\nhad more than 1 direct experience of violence, crime, or abuse,\nof the children had at least 1 form of direct exposure in the past\nyear. When witnessing and indirect exposures were com-\nbined with direct exposure, 67.5% of the children had at least\nmore exposures, and 4.4% had 10 or more exposures. There\npants with 6 or more exposures.\nExposures to violence were interrelated in such a way that\nexperiencing one type increased the likelihood of experienc-\ning other types as well. For example, having a past-year physi-\ncal assault was associated with a 4.9 times higher likelihood\nof experiencing a sexual offense and a 3.4 times higher likeli-\nhood of caregiver maltreatment (Table 6). Risks for addi-\ntional types of exposure were increased by a factor of 2 or more\nfor most past-year and lifetime exposures. Every combina-\ntion had a significant risk amplification.\nTrends Summary\nTables 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 list the percentage change for rates in\ntime estimates. There were only 2 significant changes in all 48\ncomparisons, namely, declines in past-year exposure to dat-\ning violence and lifetime exposure to household theft.\nDiscussion\nThis study provides updated estimates for exposure to a wide\nvariety of offenses, including violence, crime, and abuse. This\nexposure is widespread in the short term and over the devel-\nopmental life course.27-30 The NatSCEV approach to epidemi-\nology offers some unique features. It provides exposure in-\nformationoverthefullcourseofchildhood.Itincludesoffenses\nthat were not reported to police or child protection services.\nIt illustrates the interrelationships among different forms of\nviolence, crime, and abuse. It provides estimates for a variety\nof purposes using a mixture of categories that have relevance\nto various policy domains.\nFor example, physicians interested in exposures result-\ning in injury may note that 9.3% of youth had such expo-\nsures, while those interested more generally in aggression can\nhighlight the estimate of 37.3%. Sex offense policy makers\nsometimes want to focus on sexual abuse by a known adult\nyears old). Alternatively, they may prefer to focus on sexual\nassaults for the past year for all children (1.4%) or sexual as-\nsaults over their lifetime (14.3% for older girls).\nAn important component of the comprehensive ap-\nproach in the NatSCEV is the ability to detect youth who may\nexperience large numbers of exposures. Ten percent of the\nyouth in the sample had 6 or more direct exposures in a single\nTable 6.

They seem prone to many adversities, distress, and\nother problems.31,32 Forty-one percent of youth had multiple\nexposures in the past year. These findings highlight the num-\nber of children facing potentially trauma-inducing exposures\nto violence, as well as the importance to physicians and other\nchild-serving professionals of inquiring about such expo-\nsures and being prepared to help patients and families con-\ncerning possible needs for protection and counseling.\nLike all studies, the NatSCEV 2014 has limitations. Vari-\nous factors may have prevented us from capturing the full ex-\ntent of exposure. The families who could not be reached at\nhome or who refused cooperation for themselves or their chil-\ndren may be families in which children have discrepant lev-\nels of exposure compared with the cooperating families. For\nmany reasons, children may fail to disclose all their expo-\nsures, and parents in particular may have incentive to con-\nceal their children's exposures or may not know about all of\nthem. This could explain the lower rates for the younger chil-\ndren in many exposure categories. The screening questions for\nexposures needed to be brief and may not have included\nenough examples and details to trigger the memory of quali-\nfying experiences. Some exposures, especially over a long time\nspan, may be forgotten or may have occurred before the\nmemory capacity of some of those experiencing them was well\nformed.\nIn addition, the response rates for some segments of the\nsampling design are low by historical standards but are as good\nas or better than what is typical in national survey research.\nResponse rates to social science surveys have been steadily de-\nLow response rates do not necessarily increase the bias of\na sample.
