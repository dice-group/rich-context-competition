This article aimed to examine\nthe attitudes of Pakistani students toward the learning of English as an L2 and to understand the motivational orientations\nthat result from their attitudes. A secondary objective of this research was to find evidence to support the claim that\nPakistani students are additive bilinguals who are not averse to the idea of a language policy that promotes English as\nthe medium of instruction.

The results indicated positive attitudes toward\nlearning English as a second language with a clear instrumental orientation. Hence, the study highlighted that there exist no\nconflicting loyalties regarding the status of English and Urdu (the L1) and that both languages are held in high esteem. Despite\na strong desire to learn English to gain access to international markets, the status of Urdu remains secure as it is viewed as a\nsymbol of national integration.

They have been wondering why certain individuals\nquickly achieve native-like competency whereas others find\nprogressing beyond beginner proficiency levels highly chal-\nlenging. The most commonly asked question in this context\nis, \"What is it that makes a second language learner strive\ntowards goal achievement?\" To answer this question, current\ntheories of second language acquisition and learning need to\nbe examined. These theories are based on research in a wide\nvariety of fields, such as linguistics, psychology, sociology,\nanthropology, and neuro-linguistics (Freeman & Freeman,\n2001) and borrow from each other to address questions that\nresearchers have been trying to answer to provide guidance\nto language teachers and policy makers.\nResearch has indicated that second language learning is a\nsocial\u00adpsychological phenomenon, and it is important to\ncarefully consider the conditions under which it takes place.\nEllis (1997) argues that both internal and external factors\nplay an integral role in learning a second language. External\nfactors such as the social milieu in which learning takes place\ninclude opportunities learners may have to hear and speak\nthe target language. Internal factors, however, include the\nattitudes learners develop toward the target language and\nseem to have a much stronger effect on language learning.\nSaville-Troike (2006) claims that the question why some\nlearners are more successful than others leads to the exami-\nnation of differences in the learners themselves. In this con-\ntext, numerous factors may be examined; however, this\nparticular research focuses on the individual differences that\nlanguage learners display in terms of language attitudes and\n1Lahore University of Management Sciences, Pakistan\nCorresponding Author:\nAamna Khalid, Department of Humanities & Social Sciences, Mushtaq\nAhmad Gurmani School of Humanities & Social Sciences, Lahore\nUniversity of Management Sciences, DHA, Lahore 54792, Pakistan.\nEmail: aamna@lums.edu.pk\nA Study of the Attitudes and Motivational\nOrientations of Pakistani Learners\nToward the Learning of English as a\nSecond Language\nAamna Khalid1\n Keywords\nmotivational orientations, language attitudes, instrumental motivation, language policy, additive bilingualism, second language\nlearning, Pakistan, language planning, measurement of attitudes, bilingualism\n2 SAGE Open\nmotivational orientations. These differences are most impor-\ntant as they directly and indirectly influence the rate, process,\nand efficiency of language learning.\nBackground of the Study\nPakistan with a population exceeding 199 million is as much\nan English-speaking country as it is an Urdu-speaking coun-\ntry (Rahman, 1998). Urdu, an urban language of wider com-\nmunication, is the national language of the country whereas\nEnglish is the official language. English is the language of\nthe elite of Pakistan both formally--official interaction,\nemployment, education and so on--and informally (private\nconversations, entertainment, reading, travel, etc.). It is\nfirmly entrenched into the Pakistani society and considered\nto be a highly desired language by a vast majority of the pop-\nulation. Hence, English, today, enjoys a high status as the\nlanguage of education, law, government, science, and tech-\nnology. It is interesting to note that although English enjoys\na high status and is a powerful language, Pakistan is a pre-\ndominantly ESL (English as a second language) country.\nAdvocates of English argue for its retention as a language\nfor international communication and as a lingua franca\namong the country's provinces. Some conservative groups,\nhowever, see English as a symbol of Western culture and as\ncreating inequality among the English-speaking elite and the\nOver the last few decades, language policy makers in\nPakistan have tried time and again to oust English and to\nreplace it with Urdu as the language of government, law, and\neducation (Rahman, 1998). They have supported their claims\nby labeling English as the language of the colonial masters of\nthe past when Pakistan was a part of India under British rule.\nIn their view, the younger generations do not hold English in\nhigh esteem and have highly negative attitudes toward it\nNevertheless, English is taught in all the schools, and is in\nfact the medium of instruction in many institutions and has\nbeen observed to be a language that the young students are\nusing in not just their school lives but also their private lives\n(Rahman, 1998). Such contrasting scenarios have been pos-\ning numerous difficulties in language policy development\nand in determining the status and role of English in the\nPakistani educational context (Rahman, 1999). Hence, it is\nof relative importance that the dynamics behind the teaching\nand learning of English are analyzed before any language\nteaching or learning policies are formulated (Rahman, 1998).\nResearch Aims and Objectives\nAs has been discussed earlier, one of the most important\nissues in the English learning and teaching scenario is that of\nthe learners' attitudes toward and their motivations for learn-\ning this language. To formulate effective language and edu-\ncation policies, the study of these attitudes and motivations is\ncrucial so that policies and learner needs and motivations are\nin sync for better language education in the country.\nConsequently, it has been emphasized time and again that\n\"instrumental reasons for learning a language display a posi-\ntive attitude towards one's own language as well as towards\nas opposed to integrative reasons.\nThis research study attempts to prove this hypothesis to\nbetter understand one of the most important variables that\naffect the second language learning process in Pakistan. The\nmain reason why this variable is so important is that policy\nmakers have quoted integrative orientation as the key moti-\nvating factor in the learning of English, hence showing that\nPakistani learners are subtractive bilinguals (Rahman, 1999).\nThese views are in direct contrast to the existing research in\n1999). What has happened as a result is that the language\npolicies have been rendered rather unproductive and ineffec-\ntive and so have adversely affected the second language\nThus, the main aim of this research study is to highlight\nthe learners' attitudes toward and their motivations for learn-\ning English to ensure that language and education policies\nand learner needs and motivations are in sync for better edu-\ncation in the country.\nFor this purpose, the article attempts to examine what\n16-year-old Pakistani students feel about the learning of\nEnglish language. This understanding will benefit policy\nmakers as they try to develop sound educational policies.\nMoreover, this article also aims to analyze the effects of\nthese attitudes on the motivational preferences of these learn-\ners; that is, this study also aims to identify and determine the\nlearners' motivational orientations.\nHence, the research objectives are as follows:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 To examine the attitudes of Pakistani students toward\nthe learning of ESL\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 To understand the motivational orientations/prefer-\nences of Pakistani students by analyzing the effects of\nthe language attitudes that Pakistani students display\ntoward the learning of ESL\nA secondary, yet important, objective of this research is to\nfind evidence to support the claim that Pakistani students are\nadditive bilinguals who are not averse to the idea of a lan-\nguage policy that promotes English as the medium of instruc-\ntion. Hence, this article is simply a starting point in the\nmuch-needed research into the role and status of English in\nthe Pakistani educational scenario.\nLanguage Attitudes and Second\nLanguage Learning\nSocial psychologists claim that attitudes exert a directive\ninfluence on behavior because someone's attitude toward a\ntarget influences the overall pattern of the person's responses\nto that target. Triandis (1971) suggests that attitudes are\nmade up of three components: cognitive, affective, and cona-\ntive; that is, what a person thinks and feels, and how he or\nshe tends to behave toward an object. These components are\noften interdependent to a certain extent and interact dynami-\ncally with the environment. Ryan and Giles (1982) present a\nmore language-focused view of attitudes as, \"any affective,\ncognitive or behavioural index of evaluative reactions\ntowards different language varieties or their speakers\" (p. 7).\nSimilarly, Fasold (1984) maintains that attitudes toward a\nlanguage are often the reflection of attitudes toward mem-\nbers of various ethnic groups. In addition, Edwards (1982)\ncontributes that an individual's reactions to a language vari-\nety reveals a great deal about his or her perceptions of the\nspeakers of that variety.\nIn a similar vein, Gardner (1982) suggests that if we know\na person's attitude toward the target language community,\nthat is what he or she thinks and feels about them, then we\nhave a better chance of being able to predict the way he or\nshe will behave toward them. This hypothesis has been the\nbasis underlying most of the research conducted into the\nrelationship among attitudes and Second Language\nAcquisition (SLA), for example, Gardner and Lambert\ntheory is, therefore, that a student's attitude toward the target\nlanguage group will influence how successful he or she will\nbe in incorporating aspects of that language. It is commonly\naccepted among scholars that language belongs to a person's\nwhole social being: It is part of one's identity and is used to\nconvey this identity to other people. Thus, the learning of a\nsecond language involves more than learning skills, or a sys-\ntem of rules, or a grammar; it involves an alteration in self-\nimage, the adoption of new social and cultural behaviors and\nways of being, and therefore has a significant impact on the\nsocial nature of the learner. Hence, Gardner (1985) hypoth-\nesized that L2 learners with positive attitudes toward the tar-\nget culture will learn the target language more effectively\nthan those who do not have such positive attitudes. In their\nearlier studies, Gardner and Lambert (1959) found that apti-\ntude and motivation were the two factors most strongly asso-\nciated with learners' L2 achievement.\nAccording to Latchanna and Dagnew (2009) motivation,\nattitudes and beliefs about learning a language are among the\ndetermining factors that influence a student's efficiency and\nmust be taken into account when understanding second lan-\nguage learning processes. Lennartsson (2008) postulates that\nstudents' beliefs can be an obstacle if they believe that they\ncannot learn the new language successfully. Hence, a negative\nattitude and lack of motivation can lead to obstacles in learn-\ning a language (Lennartsson, 2008). In another vein, research-\ners have indicated that students' attitudes toward the specific\nlanguage group and attitudes toward learning it are bound to\ninfluence how successful they will be in incorporating aspects\nof that language--whether that influence takes the form of a\ncognitive filter as suggested by Dulay and Burt (1977), and\nKrashen (1981), or whether they simply support a student's\nHence, research has indicated that in second language\nlearning contexts, the role of attitudes and motivation is of\nimmense importance (Fishman, 1978). For example, in post-\ncolonial Africa, students may be educated in English or\nFrench whereas another language is spoken in the home, and\nyet another may be used in public encounters (Fishman,\n1978). In officially bilingual countries such as Switzerland,\nstudents use one language at home and for most schooling,\nbut are expected to acquire competence in at least one other\nofficial language; thus, in Switzerland, French and German\nare of equivalent social status and importance to success.\nIn the Pakistani community where different languages co-\nexist, it is imperative to realize that language attitudes play\nan important role in the lives of the users of these languages.\nAccording to Grosjean (1982) \"wherever languages are in\ncontact, one is likely to find certain prevalent attitudes of\nfavour or disfavour towards the languages involved. These\ncan have profound effects on the psychology of the individu-\nals and on their use of these languages\" (pp. 95-96) and\nhence on the learning processes of these languages.\nTherefore, how an individual views another language group\naffects not only his or her reasons for learning that language,\nbut also his or her motivational intensity.\nMotivation, Orientation, and Language Learning\nWhen studying language attitudes, the concept of motives is\nimportant. In the context of the study and in the domain of\nsocial psychology, motivation is taken to be a construct with\nthree interacting components. These were identified by\nGardner (1985) as a combination of a desire to learn an L2,\nthe expenditure of effort to achieve L2 proficiency, and a\nfavorable attitude toward learning the target language. This\nconcept suggests that attitudes and motivation are important\nbecause they determine the extent to which individuals will\nactively involve themselves in learning the language.\nGardner (1979) further hypothesized that it is not possible\nfor an individual with an unfavorable attitude toward acquir-\ning a language to find the high drive, to invest the effort, and\nto seek out opportunities required to learn. He further adds\nthat \"attitude variables are important in that, they serve to\nAnother concept of considerable importance in the field\nof SLA deals with individual orientation, that is, the indi-\nviduals' reasons for learning the target language (Siguan &\nMackey, 1987). It is easy to understand that motivation is\ngoal-directed behavior, and in this context, the goal is to\nlearn a language. The question that arises here is, why does\nan individual have this goal--what is his or her orientation?\nEarly research into attitudes, motivation, orientation, and\ntheir influence on SLA contrasted two types of orientation:\n4 SAGE Open\nintegrative and instrumental. Mansoor (1993) has postulated\nthat integrative orientation is based on the desire to learn an\nL2 to be able to meet, converse with, better understand, and\neventually be a part of the target language community.\nWhereas instrumental orientation is based on a desire to\nlearn the L2 for essentially utilitarian reasons, such as getting\na good job or being better educated.\nGardner and Lambert (1972) proposed that an integrative\norientation leads to higher motivational levels and more suc-\ncessful learning than instrumental orientation. This theory\nwho have both proven that instrumental orientation leads to\nmore effective learning.\nThe Conceptual Framework of This Research\nThis research study rests on theories posited by Mansoor\n(1993) in her extensive research on language attitudes and\nmotivations in L2 learning in Pakistan. As stated earlier, her\nframework rests on the hypothesis that instrumental orienta-\ntion leads to more effective language learning than integra-\ntive orientation does. Mansoor's work stems from her careful\nstudy of the social\u00adpsychological model proposed by\nlearner's motivation to acquire a language is determined by\nhis or her attitude toward the target language group and by\nhis or her orientation toward learning the L2. Thus, Mansoor\n(1993) analyzed learner attitudes toward a target language\ngroup while trying to study the learners' attitudes and orien-\ntations toward the learning of the said language.\nThis article also rests on Gardner's theory of second lan-\nguage acquisition, where the crucial point to consider is that a\nstudent's attitude toward the target language group will influ-\nence how successful he or she will be in incorporating aspects\nof that language into his or her repertoire (Gardner, 1985).\nHence, the conceptual framework of this research study rests\nthat L2 learners with positive attitudes toward the target cul-\nture will learn the target language more effectively than those\nwho do not have such positive attitudes and that a strong\ninstrumental orientation is highly beneficial in this scenario.\nThe social\u00adpsychological model. In his seminal social\u00adpsycho-\nthat the learner's motivation to acquire a language is said to\nbe determined by his or her attitude toward the target lan-\nguage group and by his or her orientation toward learning the\nL2. The model is based on a theory of bilingual development\nand self-identity modification. The theory suggests that lin-\nguistic distinctiveness is a basic component of personal iden-\ntity. This means that the development of L2 proficiency has\nimplications for the learner's self-identity and vice versa.\ndistinctiveness originates very early in the socialization\nprocess, occurring when parents make contrasts between their\nown and other cultural communities to help their children\nunderstand their social identity. Schools reinforce these early\nperceptions. Consequently, language is seen to play a major\nrole in the development of an individual's self-identity.\nLambert (1967) argued that students learning a second\nlanguage must be able and willing to adopt aspects of behav-\nior that characterize members of the target linguistic\u00adcultural\ngroup. This involves both cognitive (language aptitude and\nintelligence) and affective (attitudes and motivation) factors.\nHowever, the stress is more on affective factors not just in\nLambert's theoretical model but also in this research; hence,\nthe discussion in this article will not focus on the role of apti-\ntude and intelligence in second language learning.\nFigure 1 displays the major components of this model.\nThe social\u00adpsychological model proposes that SLA is\nmediated by a number of variables that include language apti-\ntude and certain attitude and orientation variables, such as\nethnocentric tendencies, attitude toward the other language\ncommunity, and instrumental and integrative orientation\n(Ellis, 1991). Moreover, as an individual becomes more profi-\ncient in the L2, his or her self-identity may undergo a change,\nwhich may lead to either additive or subtractive bilingualism.\nIt is important to note at this point that high motivation can\nmake up for considerable deficiencies both in one's language\naptitude and in learning conditions. In their seminal work,\nGardner and Lambert (1972) emphasize that, although lan-\nguage aptitude accounts for a considerable proportion of\nindividual variability in language learning achievement, moti-\nvational factors can override the aptitude effect. In certain lan-\nguage environments, as Gardner and Lambert point out, where\nthe social setting demands it (e.g., when the L1 is a local ver-\nnacular and the L2 is the national language), many people\nseem to master an L2, regardless of their aptitude differences.\nAttitudes Toward Language Groups\nSpolsky (1969) argues that in a second language learning\nscenario, one of the most important attitudinal factors is the\nattitude of the learner toward the target language and toward\nits speakers. A learner who has a positive attitude toward the\nAttitudes &\norientation\nAptitude\nMotivation\nProficiency\nSelf-identity\nAdditive\nbilingualism\nSubtractive\nbilingualism\nFigure 1. Lambert's social\u00adpsychological model.\ntarget language group will exhibit a stronger desire to learn\nthat language as compared with a learner with a negative atti-\ntude toward that language.\nAccording to Gardner (1985), the study of attitudes\ntoward languages and language groups includes issues such\nas group-specific attitudes (attitudes toward language-speak-\ning communities; own ethnic community and other language\ngroups), attitudes toward languages (i.e., the mother tongue\nand second languages), the extent of the use of all the lan-\nguages in the repertoire of the individual, and how the func-\ntions of the languages are being extended or restricted.\nEthnolinguistic identity. Ethnolinguistic identity is based on a\nbelief that one's own group is distinctive in socially impor-\ntant ways (Lennartsson, 2008) and that the most important\ncomponent is cultural distinctiveness. The social identity\nmay be positive or negative according to how in-groups fare\nin social comparisons with relative out-groups. In this way,\nlanguage functions as a very sensitive filter through which\none's own perception of self and group and others must pass.\nLanguage maintenance, spread, and shift.Language shift and\nmaintenance are the long-term collective results of language\nchoice. In language shift, a community simply gives up one\nlanguage completely in favor of another--an effect of subtrac-\nthat this could be the result of negative attitudes toward one's\nlanguage and a low ethno-linguistic identity. However, lan-\nguage shift does not mean that knowledge of the forsaken lan-\nguage has disappeared, but that the relative competence in the\ntwo languages has become opposite to what it was earlier.\nCooper (1983) suggests that language spread occurs when\none language takes over others as a lingua franca and is used\nfor wider communication. On the whole, such spread is neu-\ntral in attitudes when the spread is part of a natural process of\nadding another language to the existing repertoire. However,\nwhen the new language takes over as the mother tongue, the\nlanguage spread becomes a case of language shift. Hence,\npositive attitudes engender language loyalty (Blommaert,\n2010) and therefore favor maintenance of one's native lan-\nguage. Cummins and Swain (1986) further maintain that\nadditive bilingualism is directly related to language mainte-\nnance, whereas shift displays a subtractive attitude toward\nthe native language. Over time, intense subtractive bilingual-\nism could even lead to language loss or death.\nThe Research Scenario\nThis article outlines a small-scale research study conducted\nto examine the above-mentioned theoretical concepts in the\ncontext of the Pakistani school systems. A limited number of\nparticipants were randomly selected--fifty-seven 16-year-\nold Pakistani male students from English-medium govern-\nment (public) schools and the selected data collection tools\nwere administered over the course of a few days.\nTo minimize the effects of variables in the research situa-\ntion, the participants were very carefully selected with\nrespect to their age ranges, socio-economic background, and\ngenders. The aim was to ensure minimum variations in terms\nof ages, gender, and socio-economic class, hence enhancing\nthe study's reliability index.\nResearch Objectives and Questions\nAs has been discussed earlier, to formulate effective lan-\nguage and education policies, it is crucial to study second\nlanguage learners' attitudes and motivations toward the tar-\nget language. This will ensure that policies reflect learner\nneeds, attitudes, and motivations, and are hence, effective.\nThus, the main aim of this research study was to highlight\nthe learners' attitudes and their motivational orientations\ntoward learning English to ensure that language and educa-\ntion policies and learner needs and motivations are in sync for\nbetter language education in the country (refer to Table 1).\nAs stated earlier, a secondary objective of this study was\nto find evidence to support the claim that Pakistani students\nare additive bilinguals who display instrumental orientations\ntoward the learning of ESL. Thus, these learners are not\naverse to the idea of a language policy that promotes English\nas the medium of instruction (in direct contrast to what pol-\nicy makers believe at the moment).\nLimitations of the study. This research study was conducted as\na pioneering effort in the study of attitudes and orientations\nof 16-year-old Pakistani students from public schools. It\naimed at opening the door to further research in this field,\nhence, was small-scale and restricted to one city in the\ncountry.\nAnother limitation of the study was related to data collec-\ntion. Through the course of this study, it became evident that\npolicy makers were not accessible and unwilling to share the\nreasons behind their views about the role and status of\nEnglish. It is rather important to be able to analyze their\nviews if an in-depth study of the role of language attitudes\nTable 1.

A comparative analysis of the attitudes of different\nsocio-economic classes would have led to results that could\nbe generalized to a greater extent. However, as the objectives\nof this research were to simply identify the basic attitudes\nand orientations of students and to simply begin the process\nof investigation in this domain, the participant group was\nconsidered adequate.\nMeasurement of Attitudes and Motivation\nWhile selecting the methods to collect data, it is imperative\nto first address several issues in the search for dimensions\nunderlying language attitudes. First, the issue of prime\nimportance is to understand that the type of empirical proce-\ndures used in deriving dimensions from rating scales contrib-\nutes significantly to the ultimate result. Second, because the\nattitudes toward different languages may vary quite dramati-\ncally within a group, it is important to ascertain the critical\nwithin-group characteristics and to investigate their interac-\ntion with postulated attitudinal dimensions (Mansoor, 1993).\nTherefore, an important method to use in this scenario is the\ndirect measurement technique, which observes language atti-\ntudes through the use of questionnaires, either in written\nform or via individual interviews (Ryan, Giles, & Sebastian,\nMoreover, it is also important to remember that in a totally\nindirect method of data collection, the participants are not\naware that it is their language attitudes that are being studied,\nand hence, there are fewer chances of their responses being\ncolored by any biases. Thus, following Blommaert's (2010)\nsuggestions promoting the use of direct and indirect mea-\nsures as a cross-validation technique, both direct and indirect\nmeasures were used in this study to collect data.\nResearch Method\nThe most appropriate methods were selected after a critical\nreview of their advantages and disadvantages as enumerated\nin Table 2.\nThroughout the research study, the emphasis was on the\nuse of multiple data collection tools, thereby combining both\nqualitative and quantitative methods. The research conducted\nclearly depicted the many advantages of triangulation where\neach source of data is seen to contribute an additional piece\nto the puzzle and in that way complement each other (J.\nPatton (1990) claims that when investigating human\nbehavior and attitudes, it is most fruitful to use a variety of\ndata collection methods, as the researcher can build on the\nstrength of each type of tool and minimize the weaknesses of\nany single approach. Thus, in the present research, the use of\nboth qualitative and quantitative methods in the form of survey\ninterviews and direct and indirect questionnaires provides\nresults that could be both statistically valid and theoretically\nsound.\nIn relation to the advantages of using questionnaires,\nWilson and McLean (1994) postulate that questionnaires\nprovide structured data, are easy to administer without the\npresence of the researchers, and are often straightforward to\nanalyze. In addition, the research interview provides impor-\ntant qualitative data, and Patton (1990) suggests that when\ninterviews are structured and well organized, they are effec-\ntive data collection tools.\nDirect measures/self-reports. Bilingualism is measured either\nby reported linguistic behavior by the bilingual speaker him-\nself or herself either in questionnaire or interview form or\nthrough observation (Hardford, Valdman, & Foster, 1982).\nReported linguistic behavior consists of background data of\nself-assessment and of the results of measurements of atti-\ntudes. Self-reports have often been criticized as being sus-\nceptible to extraneous variance (Ryan et al., 1982); however,\nno empirical evidence has been identified to support this\nclaim. In fact, according to Hardford et al. (1982) self-assess-\nment of an informant's use of an L2 is a rather reliable\nmethod of measuring bilingualism. Nevertheless, the success\nof self-report techniques for eliciting information depends on\nthe openness and flexibility built into the questions (Aghey-\nDirect questionnaire (domain analysis).The collection of\nbackground data is the easiest way of acquiring informa-\ntion about the use of languages. In many investigations, the\nbackground data show a fairly strong correlation with other\nmeasurements of bilingualism (Mansoor, 1993). Macnamara\n(1966) divides the background questionnaire into five cat-\negories, namely, \"informant him/herself, father, mother, sib-\nIn this study, the survey used included statements related\nto domains such as family, friendship, neighborhood, trans-\nactions, education, government, and employment (refer to\nAppendix B).

The aim was to analyze their use of\nEnglish in different domains--both formal and informal.\nEducation, employment, and government were categorized\nas formal whereas family, friendship, neighborhood, and\ntransactions as more informal domains.\nThis questionnaire was adapted from Mansoor (1993);\nhowever, changes were made that were considered necessary\nfor the context of this research. The questionnaire (refer to\nAppendix B) included open-ended questions to provide soft\"\ndata about issues involved in the research.\nDirect questionnaire (Likert-type scale).A well-known\ndirect measure is the Likert-type scale (Appendix C)--a\nmethod of summated ratings. According to Dawes and Smith\n(1985), a Likert-type scale consists of declarative statements\nand a number of categories on which the respondents rate\ntheir agreement or disagreement. The most common number\nof categories is seven with a neutral category if required.\nAppendix C presents a sample of the questionnaire based\non the Likert measurement scale. A total of 35 items were\nselected, which aimed to provide a well-rounded view of the\nparticipant's attitudes toward the target language. This ques-\ntionnaire was adapted from Mansoor (1993).\nDirect questionnaire (orientation index).The orientation\nindex in Appendix D was designed to elicit information\nabout the learners' reasons for studying English and to\ndetermine whether their orientation would be classified as\nintegrative or instrumental. This measure was based on a\nquestionnaire developed by Gardner and Lambert (1972).\nSix integrative and six instrumental reasons were randomly\nordered. The participants had to indicate the importance of\neach reason by marking off one of five possible judgments\nfor each reason, ranging from \"most important\" to \"not at\nall important.\"\nSemi-structured and open interviews.This measure con-\nsisted of a number of prepared questions on the issue of\nlanguage proficiency and usage (refer to Appendix E). In\naddition, the overall desirability of languages for education\nwas also considered. The questions were open-ended to give\na soft and qualitative dimension to the study. Although there\nwas a questionnaire format for the interview that was used\nas the central core, some flexibility was allowed and the\nresearch probed deeper into areas of interest especially the\nrole of language in education.\nIndirect Identity Scales. Indirect Identity Scales were developed\nOller et al. (1977) suggest that integrative\u00adinstrumental orien-\ntation may be better measured by this technique that expresses\nthe concept of a continuum between the two orientations.\nThese Indirect Identity Scales were thought to provide an\nindirect indication of a student's attitudinal orientation. Oller\net al. (1977) suggested that if a student rates a certain trait\nmore highly on the ideal self-scale, it indicates a positive valu-\nation of that trait.\nIndirect questionnaire (identity scales). The Indirect Iden-\ntity Scale used in this study consisted of four identity\nscales, namely, ratings for self-concept, ideal self-concept,\nthe Urdu-speaking community, and the English-speaking\ncommunity. Each part had the same set of 17 traits on a\nSemantic Differential Scale (Osgood, Suci, & Tannenbaum,\n1957). Participants were required to mark the bi-polar traits\non a 5-point scale. To protect against order effects, the traits\nwere randomly ordered on the page, with a different order\nfor each of the parts, so that participants would be forced\nto respond to each part separately. Negative and positive\ntraits were also counterbalanced in the two columns (refer\nto Appendix A). This questionnaire was adapted from Man-\nValidity and Reliability of the Surveys\nA meaningful data collection instrument is one that is both\nreliable and valid. One of the simplest tests of reliability is\nwhether the same questionnaire, administered to the same\nperson twice in a short period of time, yields similar responses\nthat consistent responses suggest reliability, and consistent\nresponses to different items that seek to measure the same\nbehavior provide greater confidence that the questionnaire is\nreliable. According to Cohen et al. (2000), the issue of the\ndegree of unreliability can also be reduced by using a variety\nof measuring devices and assessors.\nTests of validity ask whether the interpretation, uses, and\nactions based on assessment results are appropriate to the\npurpose and context of the research (J. McDonough &\nMcDonough, 1997). A data collection item is valid to the\ndegree that it actually measures what it claims to measure.\nTo ensure reliability and validity in this study, not only\nnumerous data collection tools were used (triangulation), but\nthese tools were also tested in a piloting stage. Before the\nsurveys were administered to the participants, the surveys\nwent through a rigorous process of reliability and validity\nchecks with a control group of participants.\nProcedure of the Research Study\nThe participants were randomly selected and were given a\npreliminary explanation of the purposes of the study before\nthe data were collected in two sessions. The Identity Scales\nand domain analysis questionnaires were completed in the\nfirst session. An interval of half an hour was given between\nthe two sessions, to set off the \"fatigue effect.\"\nIn the second session, the participants completed the ori-\nentation index and the Likert-type scale questionnaires. After\n8 SAGE Open\nanother 15-min break, 10 students were randomly selected\nfor the interviews.\nFindings and Discussion\nThe results of the research study addressed both research\nquestions and clearly highlighted the language attitudes and\norientations of Pakistani second language learners.\nWith respect to the use of language, the results indicated\nthat all the learners belonged to lower-middle income groups\nand shared a common first language, that is, Urdu. It was\nfound that the participants used a blend of Urdu and English\nin informal settings, whereas English dominated all of the\nformal communication (refer to Table 3).\nOne of the most important findings was that the study\nrevealed highly favorable attitudes toward English and the\nEnglish-speaking community. These were observed on both\nthe direct and indirect measures as discussed below and indi-\ncated positive attitudes toward the learning of English.\nA comparative analysis of attitudes toward the Urdu-\nspeaking and the English-speaking communities indicated\nthat the English-speaking community was rated lower than\nthe Urdu community by 90% of the learners. This directly\ncontradicts the assumptions of Pakistani policy makers who\nclaim that because of the use of English, Pakistani students\nhave developed a subtractive attitude toward their native lan-\nguage (Rahman, 1998). This research revealed that although\nPakistani learners hold highly favorable attitudes toward\nEnglish, the positive attitudes are not at the expense of Urdu.\nRecent research conducted by Islam, Martin, and Chambers\n(2012) has also disproved the older views that Pakistani stu-\ndents feel Urdu to be at risk if English is to be promoted not\nonly as a medium of instruction but also as a compulsory\nsubject from Grade 1 onward.\nRegarding specific traits, the Urdu-speaking community\nwas rated considerably higher on integrative traits such as\n\"interesting, confident, reliable, capable, socially graceful,\nopen and most similar to self.\" The traits on which the\nEnglish-speaking community was rated higher were mainly,\ninstrumental ones such as \"modern, successful, independent,\nhappy, high standard of living, bright future, and impres-\nsive.\" Thus, this research corroborated findings from Norton\nand Kamal's (2003) study that young Pakistani learners con-\nsider competence in English to be closely related to\ntechnological advances and developments in literacy in the\nfuture and consider English education to be desirable and\nhighly beneficial from an instrumental perspective.\nFrom this discussion when we try to determine whether\nPakistani students are additive bilinguals or subtractive, it is\nrather obvious from the results that the majority display addi-\ntive tendencies. Our students value English for its utility and\nassign it a high status but not at the expense of their first\nlanguage.\nThe questionnaire that measured the students' attitudes\ntoward learning ESL (Appendix C) further reinforced the\nfinding that Pakistani students are additive bilinguals with\nvery positive attitudes toward both English and Urdu (the\nnational language).\nRefer to Table 4 for the results of the questionnaire.\nThe results indicated that the participants agreed 100%\nthat proficiency in both Urdu and English is an advantage.\nAlthough they all believed that proficiency in English is\nadvantageous and important, a vast majority felt more com-\nfortable using their first language in everyday situations.\nHundred percent of the participants claimed that they\nstrongly identified with their mother tongue, first language,\nand culture. This, among other things, proved the hypothesis\nthat although Pakistani students value English, they are\nnonetheless additive bilinguals.\nAs for their views about the importance of Urdu, the\nresults clearly indicated that all of the students believed in\npromoting Urdu to preserve their culture and felt that the use\nof Urdu should be promoted throughout the country as it had\na strong role to play in the development of Pakistan.\nWith respect to attitudes toward the English community\nand the learning of English, the research indicated that the\nstudents had highly positive attitudes. Eighty to ninety per-\ncent of the students strongly agreed that proficiency in\nEnglish had direct positive influences on getting a good job\nand succeeding in their professional lives. Yet, the majority\ndisagreed when asked whether English should always be\nused in everyday life, on public signs, notices, and advertise-\nments. The students were of the opinion that in all these\nspheres of life, their national and regional languages should\nbe used.\nIt was interesting to note that although English was\nassigned such a high status and given so much importance by\nthe students, 90% of the students strongly disagreed when\nasked whether they identified with the values and culture of\nthe target language community. They agreed that English has\nbeen and continues to be advantageous for Pakistan, yet it\ndoes not make up a significant part of their history and iden-\ntity. Thus, learning English is undertaken purely for utilitar-\nian purposes.\nHence, one of the most important findings was related to\nthe high status that most students assigned to English and its\nutility in their lives. English was seen as useful in all spheres\nof life, especially in professional life (refer to Table 5). The\nstudents revealed that English is regarded as a status symbol\nTable 3.

L1 = local vernacular; L2 = national language.\nin Pakistan and acquisition of English is seen as necessary\nfor social prestige. In the Pakistani culture, social prestige is\nsynonymous with speaking English and being educated in\nEnglish. This takes the discussion to another area--that of\nthe preferred medium of education. However, this will be\ndiscussed later. Overall, most students regarded English as\n\"a passport to progress and success.\"\nResults on the orientation index and the other direct ques-\ntionnaires revealed that all learners were more instrumen-\ntally motivated than integratively motivated to learn English.\nThe students scored an overall mean score of 4.222 on instru-\nmental reasons and 3.132 mean score on integrative reasons;\nthus, the instrumental scores were higher. When a t test was\nrun on the orientation scores, instrumental orientation was\nTable 4.

When the rea-\nsons for the low scores were analyzed, it was revealed that in\nthe students' views, these reasons imply a clear rejection of\nthe norms of Pakistani society and question their loyalty to\ntheir own community, which the students find quite\nunacceptable.\nOne of the secondary purposes of this study was to ana-\nlyze the issue of the medium of instruction in Pakistan.\nResearch has shown that in the past, English as a medium of\ninstruction was considered to be a luxury reserved for the\nhigher income sectors of society (Rahman, 1998). The\nmedium of instruction for public and government-run\nschools was Urdu, and the students viewed English-medium\ninstruction as a betrayal of their native culture and values\nhowever, have indicated a shift in this attitude. Because\nEnglish has gained popularity as a language for develop-\nment, attitudes have changed with respect to its purposes. It\nis no longer seen as a language that will lead toward a shift in\nthe status of Urdu but as a language that is necessary to prog-\nHence, its role as a lingua franca has led to a shift in the\nattitudes of policy makers who earlier regarded English-\nmedium education as a threat to national integration and\ndevelopment (Shamim, 2011). Policy makers, following in\nthe footsteps of Pakistani students, are just now beginning to\nsee the value of introducing English as a medium of instruc-\ntion in public and government schools.\nThis research study also indicated this trend toward\nEnglish-medium instruction. The students displayed highly\npositive attitudes toward English as a medium of instruction.\nThey were of the view that a change from Urdu-medium to\nEnglish-medium education does not indicate any negative\nattitudes toward Urdu or a lowering of its prestige. This\nchange, according to the students, is simply a necessary\nrequirement if Pakistani students are to compete on an equal\nfooting with the students from the rest of the world. This will\nautomatically be advantageous to Pakistan as English may\nbe a powerful vehicle for promoting dialogue, unity, and\nreduction of the divide between developed and underdevel-\nFigure 2 depicts the opinions of the participants with\nrespect to the case of the medium of instruction. As is evi-\ndent, a larger percentage of students preferred English as a\nmedium of instruction over Urdu. The vast majority, how-\never, indicated that schools should provide students with a\nchoice between selecting Urdu or English as a medium of\nstudy. This would empower students, and they would feel\nthat their opinions matter to policy makers.\nTable 6.

Medium of instruction.\nIt is essential to note at this point that when students pre-\nferred being given the opportunity to choose their medium of\nstudy, 80% of them indicated that they would choose English\nover Urdu. This simply reinforces the finding that English is\nnow the preferred medium of instruction.\nTable 7 highlights the reasons that the students presented\nfor preferring English over Urdu as a medium of instruction.\nOther than the obvious reason regarding the status of English\nas a lingua franca and its role in opening doors for future\nopportunities for the students, the interviews revealed that\nstudents have other reasons for their preference. The students\nlisted numerous difficulties in Urdu-medium studies, mainly,\nlack of materials and untrained teachers, and less access to\nvaluable literature and developments in various walks of life\n(refer to Table 7).\nFinally, the results implied a language spread in the case\nof both Urdu and English.\nIn most cases, it was observed that English was used dom-\ninantly along with Urdu in both informal and formal spheres\nof life. Therefore, the L1 is being maintained even with rapid\nspread of the L2, namely, English.\nAn important factor in the case of the spread of English is\nthe high status it enjoys. It has been the second official lan-\nguage till 1972 and is used along with Urdu for all official\npurposes (Rahman, 1998). It is seen as necessary for upward\neconomic and social mobility and as a symbol of progress\nand modernization.\nThe study revealed another very interesting finding\nrelated to the status and role of English in Pakistan and the\nsubsequent attitudes of students toward the learning of\nEnglish. Research has indicated that in countries where\nEnglish is a foreign language, the nature and strength of the\ncitizens' affiliations for their own country may have\nconsequences for their motivation to learn English (Islam\nsignificant correlations between nationalism and positive\nattitudes toward learning English. These results can be\nexplained in terms of the belief of many Japanese that\nEnglish is an important tool for internationalizing their\ncountry while also asserting Japanese distinctiveness in the\nworld outside. Similar research in China also suggests that\na possible motivation to learn English is the perception that\nit may play a vital role in promoting Chinese identity and\nculture to the world (Orton, 2009). In addition, Al-Haq and\nSmadi (1996) found that Saudi Arabian students do not\nconsider English to be a threat to their national identity or\nreligious commitment; rather, they see learning English as\na religious and national duty because the language could be\nused to promote and spread their cultural and religious\nbeliefs.\nIn Pakistan, most of the research leans in the opposite\ndirection where English is seen as a threat to national inte-\ngration and as the main reason behind the decline in the pop-\nularity of the national language leading to a negative shift in\nthe status of Urdu (Haque, 1993). This is in direct opposition\nto the findings of this research and the perspective put forth\nby Shamim (2011) in her research studies where she describes\na widespread perception of English as the language for\ndevelopment at both the individual and national levels, which\nhas \"overtaken issues of class, identity, and fear of cultural\ninvasion from an erstwhile colonial language\" (p. 293).\nRecent progressive political leadership has called knowledge\nof English \"an urgent public requirement\" (Jalal, 2004, p. 24)\non democratic grounds, and a new English language policy\nhas recently instigated the teaching of English from Grade 1\nin most public schools in the hope of promoting the language\namong the less privileged groups studying in public-sector\ninstitutions (Shamim, 2011). What is required now is a pol-\nicy where English gets the status of a medium of instruction\nin all public schools.\nOverall, the study revealed that Pakistani students display\na positive psycholinguistic distinctiveness. The learners\nseem to strive to achieve a positive identity by not only seek-\ning dimensions that afford favorable comparisons with out-\ngroups, but regard their own language as something worth\nhaving, and as necessary for their national identity.\nImplications and Recommendations\nAccording to Mueen (1992), countries have two dimensions\nof language policy: first, to spread their languages to as many\npeople and groups as possible, and second, to learn foreign\nlanguages to secure their national interests through diplo-\nmacy, intelligence gathering, trade, and so on. Hence, lan-\nguage policies should be formulated after in-depth research\ninto the language needs and attitudes of the populace to\nensure that both attitudes and policies are in sync for effec-\nTable 7.

Sabiha Mansoor, how-\never, has conducted two major studies on the attitudes of\nstudents toward languages. Her surveys suggest that stu-\ndents have a linguistic hierarchy in mind with English at the\ntop, followed by Urdu and their mother tongues. She found\nthat English is associated with modernity, efficiency, and as\na means for future advancement (Mansoor, 1993). Her\nstudies have revealed positive attitudes toward English, not\njust as an important second language to excel at but also as\na medium of instruction. Hence, English is seen as a means\nfor empowerment both at the personal and professional\nlevels.\nalong with this research have clarified that young Pakistani\nstudents not just view English as the sole means of empower-\nment but also value Urdu and agree on its role in numerous\nareas of importance in personal and professional lives--they\nare hence, additive bilinguals.\nThis is another interesting revelation that this study high-\nlights. Pakistani students are clearly additive bilinguals, as\ntheir first language Urdu, a highly valorized language, is\ngiven a great boost in the country for the purposes of national\nintegration, and learning a second language (English),\nanother highly valorized language, poses no threat to their\nL1 or language community.\nThe misinformed policy makers have been trying to oust\nEnglish as the official language and to replace it with Urdu\n(Abbas, 1998). They have based this action on the claim that\nPakistani students feel that English is a threat to their national\nidentity and integration. According to these policy makers,\nstudents view the spread of English as a sign of language\nshift with respect to Urdu (Abbas, 1998). They have deliber-\nately, or through ignorance, not realized that the Pakistani\nstudents understand and respect the role of English in their\nlives. Students now do not view English as the weapon of the\nelite used to create divisions in society but as a tool that will\nin fact bridge the gap between the well-educated,Westernized\nurban elite, and the common masses of students who are\nequally brilliant but suffer nonetheless in the job market\nbecause of their lack of proficiency in English (Memon,\n2007). These students believe that through the study of\nEnglish and in the medium of English, such disadvantages\ncould be eliminated. The students from public-sector schools\nand universities could come up to par with the private school\nstudents with respect to language skills (Memon, 2007).\nThere exists no doubt in the minds of students that English,\nbeing an international lingua franca, is the key to accessing\nbetter professional opportunities.\nAnother myth undermined by the results of the study is\nthat Urdu should be the sole medium of instruction as English\nis harmful to Urdu. In fact, the study revealed highly positive\nattitudes toward English as a medium of instruction. Students\nare in favor of English-medium education because they feel\nthat many more doors will open for them if they were to study\nin a language that is now the language of international mar-\nkets. Research has indicated that there exists great discrimina-\ntion between Urdu-medium and English-medium students\nregarding job opportunities (Abbas, 1998), and the attitude of\nthe employer displays a clear bias in favor of English-medium\nstudents (Memon, 2007). Hence, English-medium study will\nensure that students from the public sector are on an equal\nfooting with students from private English-medium schools\nand will have access to the same opportunities and will not be\nleft behind. Hence, it is a tool for social mobility.\nThis in no way means that these students do not wish to\nstudy Urdu or that they value it less. This research has clari-\nfied that students believe Urdu to be a part of their national\nidentity and agree to its high status and important role in life\nand that English is in no way a threat to Urdu.\nThus, the study shows that there are no conflicting loyalties\nregarding the study of English and Urdu. Despite the strong\ndesire to learn English for instrumental reasons, the status of\nUrdu remains secure. Urdu is seen as a symbol of national\nintegration, and all the learners display integrative attitudes.\nHence, the study points out that students want bilingual\neducation; that is, they want to study both English and Urdu\nto fulfill different needs. Urdu is hailed as a symbol of\nnational identity, and English is desired because of its great\ninstrumental value in higher education, international com-\nmunication, and economic gains and progress.\nConclusion\nIt has been evident that the attitudes of Pakistani students have\nchanged radically from ambivalence and hostility to English as\na symbol of colonial rule during the first few decades after inde-\npendence, to an enthusiastic acceptance of English today.As far\nas English is concerned, the \"colonial hangover\" (Rahman,\nEnglish on the basis that English is the language of the colonial\nmasters--the English people. The findings lend support to\nKachru's (1986) observations that the \"colonial association of\nEnglish and its Western cultural values are now underempha-\nsised. Instead what seems to be stressed is the power of English\nas an instrument of individual and societal transformation\"\n(p. 110). This research showed that English is now considered\nthe language of globalization and considered essential for an\nindividual eager to enter the international market.\nAs stated earlier, language policies despite trying their\nutmost to oust English and replace it with Urdu have failed\nbecause of the positive attitudes of the students toward\nEnglish (Rahman, 1999). The students want English educa-\ntion and feel cheated if they are deprived of it. Hence, English\nshould not be the monopoly of the elite private school\nstudents but should spread out to the masses as a tool for\nempowerment. Thus, policy makers should not feel threat-\nened by its existence and in fact use it to further the cause of\nUrdu as the language of national integration.\nIn addition, policy makers should promote the concept of\nadditive bilingualism and in fact try and eliminate any atti-\ntudes that may hinder the spread of English. Only then will\nthe attitudes and needs of the students be in sync with the\npolicies. Thus, policies will finally prove beneficial to the\nstudents, making the education process more effective.\nIn light of the research, it may be suggested that language\nplanning in Pakistan should aim at \"cultural pluralism,\" rather\nthan \"assimilation,\" which recognizes the cultural and social\ndiversity of different language groups, but which nevertheless\nseeks to create a political and economic unity for them (Haque,\n1993). Based on the study, a two-language formula catering to\nthe different needs of the learners appears to be suitable: (a)\nUrdu for national identity and as a link language, and (b) English\nas a world language and as a language for development.\nVery positive attitudes toward Urdu indicate that it is suit-\nable as a national official language for integrative reasons.\nHowever, the great instrumental need for English makes it\nsuitable for a second official language. As a result, bilingual\neducational programs should be introduced and followed,\nwhere an option is provided to the learners regarding the\nchoice of the medium of instruction.\nTo promote additive bilingualism, it is recommended that\neducation be initiated in the national language as well as in\nthe L2 simultaneously. The bi-literate bilingual program\ndefined by Fishman is recommended as most appropriate\nand useful in this Pakistani context. This group maintenance\nprogram would encourage a stable bilingual community\nFinally, a detailed larger scale study into the attitudes, ori-\nentations, and the motivational intensity and achievement\nlevels of Pakistani students is recommended to shed more\nlight on this important issue. This will result in gathering\ndata that will assist in drafting workable language and educa-\ntional policies.\nIt is common knowledge that the education system in\nPakistan is in a crisis--for numerous reasons--but many\naspects of this crisis are directly related to the language poli-\ncies (Mueen, 1992). A clear language policy that aims to pro-\nmote the learning of English for instrumental purposes will\nbe the right step in the direction of resolving this crisis.\nIt is important to remember that the aim here is not to\nreplace one language with another but to adopt a better\napproach of a parallel language system, with the caveat,\nhowever, that the roles of these languages be demarcated\nand defined to avoid any instances of dominance of one\nlanguage over another leading to a language shift. Hence,\nwe need a policy that removes the communication impasse\nand creates an egalitarian society to have equal rights of\neducation, employment, and good living just as illustrated\nby the views and attitudes that the students in this study\ndisplayed.\nAppendix A\nIndirect Identity Scale Questionnaire\nPart 1: Self-concept.
