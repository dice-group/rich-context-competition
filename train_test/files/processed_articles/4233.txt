To the best\nof our knowledge, no large-scale studies\nhave investigated the association between\nhyperuricemia and the risk of CHD based\non FRS in a Chinese mainland population.\nTherefore, a cross-sectional study was\nundertaken to assess the relationship\nbetween hyperuricemia and the risk of\nCHD calculated from the FRS.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis cross-sectional study included patients\nwho were undergoing routine check-ups at\nthe Health Examination Centre in Xiangya\nHospital, Central South University,\nChangsha, Hunan Province, China between\nParticipants were selected according to the\nfollowing inclusion criteria: (i) aged 40 years\nor older; (ii) serum uric acid and other basic\nbiochemical measurements available; (iii)\navailability of data on all basic characteris-\ntics, including age, sex and body mass index\n(BMI); and (iv) availability of data on\nhealth-related habits, such as smoking\nstatus, alcohol consumption, activity level,\nand medication use. The study design has\nbeen previously published.11 Using a stan-\ndardized questionnaire, independent, regis-\ntered nurses interviewed all participants and\ncollected information on demographic char-\nacteristics and health-related habits. The\nprotocol of this study was reviewed and\napproved by the Ethics and Research\nCommittee of Xiangya Hospital (no.\nobtained from each participant.\nBlood biochemistry\nAll blood samples were drawn after a 12-h\novernight fast and were kept at 4C until\nanalysis. Hyperuricemia was defined by the\nuric acid level !416 mmol/l in males and\n!360 mmol/l in females. Blood fasting glu-\ncose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol\n(HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein choles-\nterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels were\nalso measured. The inter- and intra-assay\ncoefficients of variation were tested by low\nconcentrations (2.5 mmol/l for glucose and\n118 mmol/l for uric acid) and high concen-\ntrations (6.7 mmol/l for glucose and\n472 mmol/l for uric acid) of standard\nhuman samples.

The inter-assay coefficients of variation\nPatients with a fasting glucose !7.0 mmol/l\nor who were currently undergoing drug\ntreatment for blood glucose control were\nregarded as having diabetes mellitus.\nLaboratory tests were performed with a\n(Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA).\nAssessment of other exposures\nThe weight and height of each patient was\nmeasured to calculate BMI. Blood pressure\nwas measured with an electronic sphygmo-\nmanometer. In addition, participants were\nasked about their average frequency of\nphysical activity (i.e. never, one to two\ntimes per week, three to four times per\nweek, five times and above per week), aver-\nage duration of physical activity (i.e. half an\nhour or less, half an hour to 1 h, 1\u00ad2 h, more\nthan 2 h). Smoking, alcohol consumption,\neducational background, occupation and\nmedication status were ascertained by\ninterview.\nAssessment of 10-Year Risk for\nCoronary Heart Disease\nAdult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) charts\nwere used to calculate the FRS for each\nparticipant.8 Information included in the risk\nassessment tool included age, sex, smoking,\nsystolic blood pressure, use of antihyperten-\nsive medications, presence of diabetes\nmellitus, total cholesterol and HDL-C.\nStatistical analyses\nContinuous data were expressed as\nmean \u00c6 SD and categorical data were\nexpressed as n of patients (%). Differences\nin continuous data were evaluated by\none-way analysis of variance for normally\ndistributed data or Kruskal\u00adWallis H test\nfor not normally distributed data.\nDifferences in categorical data were assessed\nby the 2-test. Patients were classified into\ntwo categories based on their 10-year CHD\nrisk: 0\u00ad9% (low risk) and !10% (intermedi-\nate/high risk). The prevalence of intermedi-\nate/high CHD risk scores were compared\nbetween patients with and without hyperur-\nicemia. The unadjusted association between\nhyperuricemia and CHD risk was first\nexamined by a logistic regression. Then a\nmultivariable model including variables for\nage, BMI, creatinine level, activity level,\nalcohol consumption, educational back-\nground, occupation, and diabetes status\nwas used to estimate the odds ratio (OR)\nand related 95% confidence interval (CI).\nSubgroup analyses were conducted in the\nmale and female populations.\nSensitivity analyses were performed\nfirstly by excluding patients with diabetes,\nhypolipaemic medication history or chronic\nkidney disease (CKD) and secondly, by\nadding LDL-C and triglycerides into the\nmultivariable adjusted model.

The relationship was valid\nfor both the male and female subgroups. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy to examine the correlation between\nhyperuricemia and CHD risk based on FRS\nin a middle-aged to elderly Chinese\npopulation.\nUric acid is the metabolic end product of\npurine metabolism.12 It has been described\nas having both an extracellular antioxidant\neffect and an intracellular pro-oxidant effect\ndepending on locality and presence of other\nfactors.12 This dual role has been described\nas the `uric acid paradox'.12 For example,\nlow concentrations of uric acid contribute to\nthe prevention of oxidative inactivation of\nendothelial enzymes and angiotensin con-\nverting enzyme and also to the preservation\nof nitrous oxide (NO) production.13\nHowever, under hyperuricemic conditions,\nthe beneficial effects are replaced by dele-\nterious effects that include NO reduction,\nendothelial dysfunction,14 oxygen radical\npromotion and increased proinflammatory\nmarker production.15\nAlthough the exact mechanisms are\nunclear, several studies have shown that\nhyperuricemia is associated with CHD and\nis independently associated with some CHD\ndamage to the vascular endothelium and\nvessel wall because, as previously men-\ntioned, uric acid can exert a pro-oxidant\neffect and oxidative stress would promote\nendothelial dysfunction.14,18 In addition,\nuric acid stimulates the proliferation of\nvascular smooth muscle cells through the\nrenin-angiotensin system and its activation\ncould lead in turn to the stimulation of the\nxanthine oxidase and nicotinamide adenine\ndinucleotide phosphate systems.19,20 This\nphenomenon could possibly impair arterial\nfunction and cause arterial stiffening, which\nis a major cause of hypertension and\nCHD.12 Another possible explanation of\nthe involvement of uric acid in CHD is\nTable 2.

For example, as far as we\nae aware, it is the first study to investigate\nthe possible association of hyperuricemia\nwith 10-year CHD risk based on FRS in a\nlarge sample (n \u00bc 6347) of middle-aged and\nelderly Chinese patients. Also, a multivari-\nable model was used to ensure that the\nassociations were independent of a consid-\nerable number of potentially confounding\nfactors (i.e. BMI, creatinine, activity level,\nalcohol consumption, educational back-\nground, occupation and diabetes status),\nwhich improved the reliability of the results.\nHowever, the study had some limitations.\nFirst, the serum uric acid level was deter-\nmined by a balance of uric acid generation,\nreabsorption, and excretion. Thus, it could\nhave been influenced by various factors such\nas the use of diuretics, dietary purine intake,\nvolume depletion and renal dysfunction.23\nHowever, these factors were not recorded\nand so they could not be assessed in this\nstudy. Secondly, the cross-sectional design\nof the study precluded analysis of causal\nassociations and therefore, further prospect-\nive studies and intervention trials should be\nundertaken to establish any causal associ-\nation between hyperuricemia and CHD.\nFinally, this study evaluated only middle-\naged and elderly patients undergoing a\nhealth check-up, which limits the applicabil-\nity of these results to the general population.\nIn conclusion, this present study demon-\nstrated that hyperuricemia was positively\nassociated with 10-year risk of CHD.\nTherefore, hyperuricemia may be an inde-\npendent CHD risk factor in middle-aged\nand elderly Chinese patients. Additional\nprospective studies are required to confirm\nthese findings.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research was supported by the Fundamental\nResearch Funds for the Central Universities of\nCentral South University, Changsha, Hunan\nReferences\n1.
