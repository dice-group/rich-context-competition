Among these\neffects, the most important is carcinogenesis. In view of the importance of immune\nsurveillance in cancer control, the dose-response relationship of the changes in\ndifferent cell types of the immune system after whole-body irradiation is analyzed on\nthe basis of systemic data from the author's laboratory in combination with recent\nreports in the literature. For T lyrnphocytes ]- or inverted j-shaped curves are usually\ndemonstrated after irradiation, while for macrophages dose-response curves of\nchiefly stimulation with irregular patterns are often observed. The intercellular\nreactions between the antigen presenting cell (APC) and T lymphocyte (TLC) in\nthe immunologic synapse via expression of surface molecules and secretion of\ncytokines by the two cell types after different doses of radiation are illustrated. The\ndifferent pathways of signal transduction thus facilitated in the T lymphocyte by\ndifferent doses of radiation are analyzed to explain the mechanism of the phenom-\nenon of low-dose stimulation and high-dose suppression of immunity. Experimental\nand clinical data are cited to show that LDR retards tumor growth, reduces metasta-\nsis, increases the efficacy of conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy as well as\nalleviates the suppression of immunity due to tumor burden. The incidence of\nthymic lymphoma after high-dose radiation is lowered by preexposure to low-dose\nradiation, and its mechanism is supposed to be related to the stimulation of antican-\ncer immunity induced by low-dose radiation. Recent reports on lowering of stan-\ndardized cancer mortality rate and all cause death rate of cohorts occupationally\nexposed to low-dose radiation from the US, UK, and Canada are cited.\n",

The LNT hypothesis emphasizes the stochastic nature of DNA damage\ncaused by ionizing radiation. However, it should be emphasized that the defense\nand adaptive reactions in the body are often activated by low-dose radiation and\ndown-regulated by high-dose radiation. Among these reactions antioxidants, DNA\nrepair, apoptosis of damaged cells, adaptive response in mutagenesis, and immune\nconcentrates on the analysis of the dose-response relationship in the immune system\nafter whole-body irradiation (WBI).\nEstablishment of dose-response relationship of biological parameters is one of\nthe key topics in radiobiology research. Due to the importance of immune surveil-\nlance against cancer and infection, radiation effect on the immune system has been\none of the chief research fields in radiation biology and radiation protection.\nHowever, in most previous studies only the changes in immunity after exposure to\ndoses above 0.2 Gy were observed, thus usually giving rise to a linear or quadratic\neffect of doses of 0.2 Gy and lower are studied, usually a ]- or inverted j-shaped curve\ncan be demonstrated for parameters of the lymphocytes, and curves showing chiefly\nstimulation with irregular patterns are often observed for macrophages. Elucidation\nof the characteristics of these dose-response curves is of importance in understand-\ning the manifestations and mechanisms of immunologic changes induced by differ-\nent doses of ionizing radiation.\nSince the 1980s of the last century radiation effect on the immune system has\nbeen a constituent part of many important international conferences concerning\nthe biological effects of low-dose radiation (Sagan 1987; Sugahara et al. 1992; Liu\nreviewed papers discussing the stimulatory effect of low-dose radiation on immunity\nHattori 1994). However, not many of these involve the dose-response relationship\nof ionizing radiation-induced immune changes. In 1994 in its report to the UN\nGeneral Assembly, UNSCEAR for the first time recognized the adaptive response\ninduced by low-dose radiation (UNSCEAR Report 1994 to the General Assembly of\nUnited Nations). In this document stimulation of immunity induced by low-dose\nradiation was included in adaptive responses. However, its mechanism and influ-\nence on cancer risks were not fully analyzed. Since the publication of UNSCEAR\n1994 report, more scientific data have been accumulated in international literature,\n72 Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. I, No. I, 2003\nNonlinear Dose-Effect Relationship in Radiation Immunology\nmaking it possible to give an analysis of the topic in more depth. In the present\npaper three aspects of the effect of ionizing radiation on the immune system will be\nanalyzed, that is, dose-response relationship of immunologic parameters, mechanis-\ntic studies on low-dose stimulation of immunity, and the implications in relation to\ncancer risks.\nThe dose-response relationship of immunological parameters following expo-\nsure to ionizing radiation is affected by a number of factors. Most important among\nthese are the target cells under observation and the experimental design. When the\nlymphocytes and related functions are studied, a ]- or inverted j-shaped dose-\nresponse curve is usually observed. If the macrophages and related functions are\nunder study, chiefly stimulation with irregular patterns may appear over the usual\ndose range within 10 Gy. In order to confirm the existence of stimulation by low-\ndose radiation in animal models, experimental design may be a critical factor. Dose\nrange, dose spacing, and dose rate as well as temporal relationship of the changes\nare crucial in the experimental design. Usually three orders of magnitude have to\nbe chosen for the dose range, that is, from 0.01 to 10 Gy and within this range 3-4\nGy with 10 or more dose points. In the author's laboratory, for whole-body irradia-\n2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 Gy and sham-irradiated control are used to construct a dose-\nresponse curve in most immunological studies evaluating the response of lympho-\nsistant parameters, such as NK activity and ADCC activity, more doses in the higher\nend are needed, e.g., extending to 10, 12, and 14 Gy, in order to reveal the\nThe stimulatory effect of low-dose radiation on immunity has been documented\ndose-response relationship of the immunologic changes, especially in a coordinated\nmanner synthesizing various effects at different levels, has not been reported. In the\npresent paper 52 immunologic parameters in two categories are pooled to construct\ndose-effect curves. The dose-effect relationship of one category consisting of 20\nparameters shows a j-shaped curve (left upper panel of Figure 1) .These parameters\ninclude: (1) cell activities, such as cell cycle control, cell survival (apoptosis): (2)\nsurface molecules, such as CTLA-4; (3) cytokines, such as IL-lO and IL-4 synthesis,\n(4) signal molecules, such as cAMP and cAMP to cGMP ratio, protein kinase A and\nphospholipase A2, glucocorticoid receptor (GCR).

In many studies in the literature doses below 0.2 Gy were often neglected,\nthus the effect of low-dose radiation would be missed.

Vol. I, No. I, 2003\nNonlinear Dose-Effect Relationship in Radiation Immunology\nAnother factor is the strain of animal used. When the irradiation conditions\nremain the same, different strains of mice may react differently to low-dose radia-\ntion. Take the proliferative reaction oflymphocytes to Con A as an example, BALBI\nc mice and C57BL/6 mice may react in an opposite direction (Shankar B et aJ.\n1999). When C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were exposed to fractionated low-dose\nradiation (0.04 GyI day,S days/week, total dose 0.2 Gy) and subsequently stimulated\nwith Con A, the proliferation of spleen cells in response to Con A as measured by\n3H-TdR incorporation was significantly higher in 0.2 Gy-irradiated C57BL/6 mice\nwhen compared with that in the Con A-stimulated cells from sham-irradiated con-\ntrols, but the same response was suppressed by 0.2 Gy in BALBIc mice. The\naugmentation of response to Con A in C57BL/6 mice was marked by the decrease\nin the proportion of cells expressing p53 as estimated by flow cytometry. A reduction\nin expression of p53 was accompanied by reduced apoptosis in the Con A-stimulated\nspleen cells of irradiated C57BL/6 mice when compared with that in the sham-\ntreated controls. However, the splenic cells of BALB/c mice showed exactly oppo-\nsite profiles in this respect. The Kunming strain and C57BL/6 strains of mice react\nimmune response following low-dose radiation is evidently affected by the strain of\nmice used. It has been reported that BALBIc mice are more sensitive to cancer\ninduction by radiation than C57BL/6 mice due to the genetic instability induced by\nradiation in the former strain of mice (Ponnaiya et aJ. 1997).\nFor BALBIc mice the stimulatory effect of the low-dose radiation may be condi-\ntioned by the dose rate used, e.g.,a dose rate of 15 mGy/min or lower would usually\nbe effective in eliciting a stimulating effect with total doses of 77 and 106 mGy,\nresulting in doubling the proliferation rate to that of sham-irradiated control, but\na dose rate of 200 mGyI min with the same total dose may not be effective in eliciting\nstimulation of proliferation in BALBIc mice (Su etaJ. 1997). In this experiment the\nproliferative response of splenocytes to Con A was observed in BALBIc mice\nmeasured by 3H-TdR incorporation after whole-body X-irradiation (Table 1).\nThe temporal changes of the biological parameter under study may sometimes\nalso influence the shape of the dose-response curve. It is especially important when\n\"overcompensation stimulation\" is concerned in the mechanism of the hormetic\neffect (Calabrese 2001). As listed in this article, the hormetic effect elicited by a\nnumber of chemical agents showed an inverted j-shaped curve only at a certain time\npoint after the administration of the chemical agent. The same may be true for some\nof radiation-induced effects. Take apoptosis as an example, a J-shaped dose-re-\nsponse curve was demonstrated both for thymocytes 24 h after WBI of mice (mea-\nsuring DNA fragmentation with fluorescence staining using DAPI) and for EL-4\ncells 24 h after in vitroX-irradiation (measuring apoptotic bodies with flow cytometry)\n[Llu et aI. 1996). In these two cases a statistically significant decrease in apoptosis\nrate occurred at doses of 0.05 and 0.075 Gy, but the decrease was not statistically\nsignificant at the dose of 0.025 Gy.

Again, a statistically significant decrease in apoptosis\ncourse studies revealed a brief increase in apoptosis rate 1 h after irradiation with\nthese doses, but the magnitude was greater after 0.05 and 0.075 Gy than that after\n0.025 Gy. It was supposed that a certain magnitude of initial DNA damage triggering\nan increase in apoptosis was required in order to stimulate a compensatory reaction\nthat would be able to clear the apoptotic cells to a level significantly below the\ncontrol base line in the course of 12 h. An example is given in Table 2 showing the\ntime course of the changes in apoptosis rate in the cortex of thymus assayed with\nIt is seen in this table that a higher abrupt early increases in apoptosis rate\nsation\" at 12 h with the apoptosis rate going down to below control. The mechanism\nof the \"overcompensation\" may of course consist of a number of defense reactions,\nincluding increased DNA repair elicited by low-dose radiation.\nHowever, in many other cases direct stimulation may be the mechanism of the\nhormetic effect. Take the dose-effect curve of thymocyte cAMP I cGMP ratio and the\nactivity of its downstream molecule protein kinase A (PKA) as an example, a\nj-shaped curve was demonstrated 24 h after whole-body irradiation as shown in\nThe time course studies showed that there was statistically significant drop in\ncAMP/cGMP ratio beginning from 8 h after whole-body irradiation with 0.075 Cy,\nreaching its nadir at 24 h, and no rise above control was observed even as early as\nNonlinear Dose-Effect Relationship in Radiation Immunology\nTable 2.

This change in cAMP/ cGMP ratio is due to both up-\nregulation of cGMP and down-regulation of cAMP after low-dose radiation. The\nopposite is true for the time course after a higher dose (2 Gy). The same pattern of\nthe time course of PKA was also demonstrated after low and high-doses of radiation.\nThese data may speak for a direct effect of low-dose radiation but not due to\n\"overcompensation\".\nThe dose-response relationship of changes in macrophages after exposure to\nionizing radiation is apparently different from that of the T lymphocytes. Most of\nthe parameters studied showed a pattern of chiefly stimulation from low to high-\ndoses of ionizing radiation. Examples are given in Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 shows\nperitoneal macrophages after whole-body irradiation and on J77 4A.l cells (a mouse\nmacrophage cell line) after in vitro irradiation (Liu et a1. 2001).

Changes in the expression of surface molecules and the secretion\nof cytokines are accompanied with the induction of relevant genes and the expres-\netal. 2001; Liu et al. 2001a,b). It has been demonstrated in mice that these molecular\nchanges induced by low-dose radiation constitute a unique pattern distinctly differ-\nLiu et al. 2001a). Low-dose radiation acts on both the APCs and T lymphocytes,\nfacilitating the intercellular reactions within the immunmologic synapse (Malissen\nNonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, Nov l , 2003 79\nShu-Zheng Liu\n1999) formed between these two categories of immune cells (Figure 5). It stimulates\nthe expression of a number of surface molecules and modulates the secretion of\n(CD86) molecules on and secretion oflL-12p70 by the macrophages as well as the\nCD28 (Liu et al. 2001) on the lymphocytes and down-regulates IL-IO synthesis by T\ncells together with decreased CTLA-4 expression, and high-dose radiation exerts\nopposite effects on these parameters ofthe T cells (Liu et al. 2001; Liu etal. 2001a,b).\nAs shown in Figures 3 and 4, there is a significant increase in secretion of TNFa,\nIL-lj3, and IL-12p70 by the macrophages in response to whole-body irradiation of\nalso important costimulating molecules regulating the immune response. It has\nbeen reported that low-dose radiation strongly enhanced the expression of CD2,\nboth in PHA-stimulated and in resting human T lymphocytes, as demonstrated by\na rosette assay or by immunofluorescence (Sambanmi et al. 1996). Flow cytometrk\nanalysis showed that in vitro irradiation ofEL-4 (mouse lymphoma) cells resulted in\nPresenting Cell\nI\nf\n!\nIJ\"\\\u00b7I\nT lymphocyte\n(JIllmunologic Synapse)\nSchematic diagram showing the intercellular reactions between an antigen pre-\nsenting cell and a T lymphocyte via the surface molecules.

It is\nseen that both low and high-doses of radiation caused up-regulation of surface\nmolecules on the macrophages (except CD48) and increased secretion of IL-12.\nThus, the differential response of the immune reactions to low- vs. high-dose\nradiation chiefly depends on distinct changes of the T lymphocytes. So far, as the\nare concerned, this opposite relationship of the changes in surface molecule expres-\nsion on and cytokine secretion by the lymphocytes after low and high-doses of\nradiation and its impact on the final outcome of the immune response are illus-\ntrated in the diagram in Figure 6 (Llu et a1. 2001).

(See text for detailed\nexplanation).\nShu-Zheng Liu\nChanges in other surface molecules and cytokines, as described in previous sections\nof the present paper, also play important roles.\nIt is quite clear that research on the molecular basis of the changes in the\nintercellular reactions after different doses of ionizing radiation in recent years has\npromoted the understanding of the nature of hormetic effect of low-dose radiation\non immunity. The signals from APCs are absolutely necessary for the activation of\nlymphocytes in response to low-dose radiation (Ltu et al. 2001). The part played by\nthe APCs (macrophages) is essential for the realization of low-dose radiation-\ninduced immunolgic stimulation because depletion of these cells from the spleno-\ncyte suspension obtained from the low-dose-irradiated mice will lead to the disap-\npearance of the stimulatory effect. The up-regulation of expression of surface\nmolecules (CD48, CD80, CD86) on APCs and increase in secretion of cytokines (IL-\n12, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha) by APCs after exposure to low-dose radiation are crucial\nfactors for up-regulation of T cell activity. On the other hand, all these changes\nexcept the down-regulated expression of CD48 are also observed after exposure to\nhigh-dose radiation (2 Gy). Thus, T lymphocytes play an even more important role\nin determining the fate of the immune response since the expression of their\nsurface molecules (TCR, CD2, CD28, CTLA-4) changes in opposite directions after\nlow and high-doses of radiation, and, even more, the secretion of IL-lO is down-\nregulated after low-dose radiation and up-regulated after high-dose radiation. De-\nspite the fact that the expression of CD80 and CD86 on and the secretion of IL-12\nby the APCs are sustained at a high level after high-dose radiation, the down-\nregulated CD28 expression and up-regulated expression of CTLA-4 on and in-\ncreased IL-10 secretion by the lymphocytes after high-dose radiation will ultimately\nlead to down-regulation of T cell activation. Therefore, it is these distinct dose-\ndependent changes in the lymphocytes that determine the final outcome of im-\nmune response.\nThe molecular changes in the immunologic synapse would apparently reinforce\nthe facilitation of the signal transduction in the lymphocyte initiated by the action\nof low-dose radiation. There have been reports on the effect of ionizing radiation\nLow-dose radiation may facilitate the transduction in multiple signal pathways,\nincluding the protein kinase C/calcium ion (PKC/[Ca2+\nL) system, cyclic adenosine\nmonophosphate/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) system, phospholipase A2/\nprosdaglandin E2 (PLA2/PGE2) system, and others. The effect of low-dose radia-\ntion on these signal pathways may be schematically illustrated in Figure 7.\nIn Figure 7 it is shown that low-dose radiation may act on the two categories of\nimmune cells (APC and TLC) directly or via the reactive oxidative species (ROS) to\ninfluence the expression oftheir surface molecules and secretion ofrelevant cytokines\nwithin the immunologic synapse as described in previous sections. On the left side\nin the middle part of Figure 7 three signal pathways and their interrelationship are\nillustrated.

On the other hand, tetramethyl\nbenzidine-8 (TMB-8), a calcium antagonist, could completely suppress the low-dose\nradiation-induced augmentation of thymocyte proliferation (Ltu 1998; Liu and Xie\nL pathway may occupy a pivotal\nposition in low-dose radiation-induced up-regulation of T cell activation.

In addition, the lowering of the activity of phospholipase A2\n(PLA2) in the thymocytes after low-dose radiation may further decrease the cAMP\net a1. 2001). The changes in these three signal pathways would converge on the\nactivation of transcription factors, which would increase the transcription of genes\nrelated to immune response. In the diagram up-regulation of IFNy and IL-2 genes\nare shown as representatives (Liu et a1. 2000). It is shown on the right side of the\ndiagram that increased secretion of IL-l ~ could positively feedback to stimulate the\nAPC (Ltu 1998), and the rise of nitric oxide (NO) and ROS induced by TNFa. (Sun\nand Liu 2000b) may exert direct stimulation to the transcription factors (TFs). The\nultimate result, as shown at the bottom of the diagram, is T lymphocyte activation\nand proliferation, which would lead to clonal expansion and potentiation of anti-\ncancer immune activity.\nThe time course of the changes in signal molecules after whole-body irradiation\nwith 0.075 Gy is shown in Figure 8. It can be seen that all the signal molecules reach\ntheir peak or nadir at 12 to 24 h after whole-body irradiation.

Immune surveillance is one of\nthe most important defense mechanisms in the body monitoring the development\nof cancer (Dunn eta1. 2000) . As reviewed in the previous sections, low-dose radiation\nstimulates T cell activity. The significance of these immunologic changes in radia-\ntion-induced cancer is still a question of debate. In UNSCEAR 1994 report, it was\nstated that \"it remains doubtful whether the immune system plays a significant role\nin any of the adaptive responses at low-doses.... the immune system may not playa\nmajor role in moderating human radiation oncogenesis, although immune func-\ntion in certain organs may ensure that some early neoplastic cells are eliminated\nbefore they become established\". NCRP Report No. 136 (NCRP 2001) also briefly\ndiscussed the adaptive response induced by low-dose radiation. It is stated that \"in\nthe ultimate instance of cancer in vivo, the adaptive response may take the form of\nan immune surveillance of preneoplastic cells. This is certainly a possibility, but it\nis difficult to design laboratory experiments to test it\". In a recent commentary\narticle on radiation hormesis it is recognized that \"under appropriate conditions,\nexposure to Xrays or gamma rays at doses below those causing immunosuppressive\neffects has been observed to augment various immune responses in mice...\" but \"the\nmechanisms of the observed enhancement remain to be elucidated in full...\"\n(Upton 2000). These statements accept the importance of experimental data on\nlow-dose radiation-induced up-regulation of certain immune functions and im-\nmune surveillance of cancer formation on one hand and question its significance\nin the analysis of cancer risk assessment on the other. There have been accumulat-\ning data disclosing the cellular and molecular mechanisms of low-dose radiation-\ninduced increase in antitumor immunity in animal models as reviewed in the\npresent paper. Low-dose radiation increases cellular antioxidant activity, facilitates\nShu-Zheng Llu\nDNA damage repair, reduces cell mutagenesis, and stimulates immune surveillance.\nAll these may contribute to the effect of low-dose radiation on the reduction of\ncancer incidence. There have been experimental studies illustrating the suppressive\neffect of low-dose radiation on tumor growth, metastasis, and carcinogenesis as well\nas increased anticancer immunity, including enhanced NK and CTL activity as well\nas increased IFNy and IL-2 secretion, and all these data point to the significance of\nimmune responses up-regulated by low-dose radiation in cancer control (Li et al.\ndose radiation decreased the growth rate and metastasis of implanted B16 mela-\nnoma and Lewis lung cancer in C57BL/6j mice. In a well-recognized model of\nthymic lymphoma induced by fractionated whole-body irradiation (1.75 Gy once a\n6-12 h preceding each fractionated high-dose radiation could reduce the lym-\nphoma incidence from 43.3% in the control (exposed to only the high-dose radia-\ntion) to 15.1% (high-dose radiation being preceded by 0.075 Gy, with an interval of\n6 h) and 17.6% (high-dose radiation being preceded by 0.075 Gy, with an interval\nof 12 h) in 6 months after the fractionated exposures (Li et al. 1998; Li et al.\n1999a,b). It was found that the low-dose radiation-induced suppression of tumor\ngrowth, metastasis, and incidence of lymphoma were accompanied with enhance-\nFigure 9 shows experimental data illustrating that low-dose radiation retards cancer\ngrowth, reduces metastasis, increases efficacy of chemotherapy of cancer, and alle-\nviates immune suppression caused by tumor burden (Fu et al. 1996; Li et al. 1993;\nZhang et al. 1997b, 1999). The clinical application of low-dose radiation in the\ntreatment of cancer has shown enlightening results. When patients with non-\nHodgkin's lymphoma under chemotherapy was given total body or half body (the\nthorax) low-dose radiation in a regimen of 0.1 Gy three times a week or 0.15 Gy two\ntimes a week for 5 consecutive weeks with a total dose of 1.5 Gy, the survival rate in\n9 years rose to 84% from 50% ofthe control with chemotherapy alone (P<O.Ol). The\nlow-dose radiation-treated patients showed enhanced anti-cancer immunity\nActually, j-shaped dose-incidence curves have been demonstrated for a number\nof cancers induced by exposure to different doses of radiation (Calabrese and\nBaldwin 2002). Human epidemiological surveys also showed decreased cancer inci-\ndence after exposure to low-dose radiation. Among these the U.S. nuclear shipyard\nworker study, the 100-year British radiologists observation and a Canadian occupa-\ntional radiation dose registry analysis strongly speak for the possibility of existence\nof an hormetic effect of low-dose radiation in cancer incidence since the cohorts\nobserved in these three reports would probably exclude the \"healthy worker effect\"\nreports would promote further research in this field, thus accumulating more\nscientific data giving impetus to the improvement of the present radiation protec-\nNonlinear Dose-Effect Relationship in Radiation Immunology\n\u00b7\nI\nFigure 9.

This situation makes it possible to construct dose-response curves reflect-\ning reality. However, full analysis of existing data is still limited, which may be due\nto inaccessibility or neglect of some of the scientific reports. The present paper\ntended to review the dose-response relationship of immune parameters after whole-\nbody X-irradiation and the up-regulation of T cell activity induced by low-dose\nradiation with emphasis on its cellular and molecular mechanisms, a research field\nadvancing along with the rapid progress in modern immunology. Just because of\nthis situation the review may not be able to cope with the development in this rapidly\nadvancing field.
