Two possible channels have been discussed. The bank lending\nchannel theory argues that small banks with weak liquidity positions have to cut\ntheir loan supply after a monetary tightening if the market for bank debt is\nimperfect: Such banks face difficulties in substituting the decrease in deposits by\nexternal non-insured funds. In contrast, the bank capital channel theory argues\nthat poorly capitalized banks that are subject to capital regulation may cut their\nloan supply after a monetary tightening if the market for bank equity is imperfect:\nBanks face maturity transformation costs (i.e. costs incurred after a monetary\ntightening due to the inability to re-price long-term loans, whereas funding turns\nmore expensive immediately), which reduce their interest income and, hence, the\ncapital position. As a consequence, poorly capitalized banks may have to cut\nlending, thus possibly generating real economic effects if bank customers do not\nhave perfect substitutes for bank loans.\nThis paper tests whether a bank capital channel type of transmission\nmechanism exists in the German banking system. The intuition behind the\nempirical model is the following: banks try to avoid the cost of falling below the\nregulatory minimum capital requirements by holding capital buffers and asset\nbuffers, i.e. short-term risk-weighted assets (other than customer loans) that can\nbe liquidated if the bank runs into problems with the capital requirement. A\nmonetary tightening leads to costs for banks with a time-to-maturity mismatch\nbetween assets and liabilities. Hence, if these banks additionally have low asset\nand capital buffers, they are expected to react more restrictively, as for them, the\nexpected value of the costs of violating the capital regulation increases.\nThis paper then tests the derived hypotheses based on quarterly data for\nthat, in the light of a restrictive monetary policy, the interaction of the asset and\ncapital buffer plays a significant role. Further, banks with a low asset buffer react\nmore restrictively after a monetary tightening than their peers if they face\nmaturity transformation costs. The capital buffer is only significant in interaction\nwith a low asset buffer. The interdependence is illustrated by the fact that the\nasset buffer plays an important role only for banks with a low capital buffer.\nAll additional pieces of evidence point in the same direction. First, the more\npronounced the time-to-maturity mismatch of a bank, the more its income\ninterest position deteriorates. Second, other bank-specific variables that may\nsignal financial strength to market participants and that are often used in the\nempirical literature to test for the bank lending channel are found to be\ninsignificant. Third, as the majority of German banks is organized in liquidity\nnetworks, we also test whether another type of transmission mechanism may\ncome through the respective head institutions. However, we find no evidence to\nsupport this hypothesis. All in all, we find clear evidence that a bank capital\nchannel exists in the German banking system.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nDie theoretische und empirische Literatur hat in den letzten Jahren verst\u00e4rkt die\nRolle von Banken in der geldpolitischen Transmission analysiert. Dabei werden\nzwei m\u00f6gliche Kan\u00e4le diskutiert. Die Theorie des Bankkreditkanals\nargumentiert, dass kleine Banken mit geringer Liquidit\u00e4t bei einer Straffung der\nGeldpolitik ihre Kreditvergabe einschr\u00e4nken m\u00fcssen, falls der Markt f\u00fcr\nBankschulden unvollkommen ist. Solche Banken k\u00f6nnen nur schwer den\nR\u00fcckgang der versicherten Einlagen durch die Ausgabe von\nSchuldverschreibungen kompensieren. Im Gegensatz dazu argumentiert die\nTheorie des Bankkapitalkanals, dass schlecht kapitalisierte Banken, die\nMindestkapitalanforderungen einhalten m\u00fcssen, bei einer Straffung der\nGeldpolitik ihre Kreditvergabe einschr\u00e4nken m\u00fcssen, wenn der Markt f\u00fcr\nBankkapital unvollkommen ist. Banken entstehen durch steigende Zinszahlungen\nauf ihre Verbindlichkeiten Kosten, die sie bei l\u00e4ngerfristigen Festzinskrediten\nnicht unmittelbar an ihre Kreditnehmer weitergeben k\u00f6nnen. Diese\nFristentransformationskosten reduzieren das Zinsergebnis und damit das\nEigenkapital von Banken. Schlecht kapitalisierte Banken m\u00fcssen daher ihre\nKreditvergabe verringern, was bei fehlenden vollst\u00e4ndigen Substituten f\u00fcr\nBankkredite einen negativen realwirtschaftlichen Effekt nach sich ziehen kann.\nDas Papier testet die Existenz des Bankkapitalkanals in Deutschland. Das\nempirische Modell nimmt an, dass Banken Kosten der Verletzung der\nMindestkapitalanforderungen vermeiden wollen, indem sie Kapitalpuffer und\nAktivpuffer (d.h. Aktiva, die bei einer Verschlechterung der Eigenkapitalposition\nkurzfristig liquidiert werden k\u00f6nnen) halten. Eine Straffung der Geldpolitik f\u00fchrt\nzu Fristentransformationskosten, auf die Banken mit niedrigem Kapital- und\nAktivpuffer mit einer Einschr\u00e4nkung ihrer Kreditvergabe reagieren m\u00fcssen,\nwenn sie eine Verletzung der Mindestkapitalanforderungen vermeiden wollen.\nDas Papier testet diese Hypothesen basierend auf Quartalsdaten f\u00fcr deutsche\ndass die Interaktion von Aktiv- und Kapitalpuffer bei einer restriktiven\nGeldpolitik eine wichtige Rolle spielt. Ferner reagieren Banken mit niedrigem\nAktivpuffer restriktiver auf eine Straffung der Geldpolitik und damit\neinhergehende Fristentransformationskosten als andere Banken. Der\nKapitalpuffer ist nur in Interaktion mit dem Aktivpuffer signifikant. Die\nInterdependenz wird dadurch verdeutlicht, dass der Aktivpuffer nur bei Banken\nmit niedrigem Kapitalpuffer eine wichtige Rolle spielt.\nAlle zus\u00e4tzlichen Indizien weisen ebenfalls auf das Vorliegen eines\nBankkapitalkanals in Deutschland hin. Zum einen verschlechtert sich das\nZinsergebnis von Banken umso mehr, je st\u00e4rker sie Fristentransformation\nbetreiben. Zum anderen erweisen sich andere bank-spezifische Variablen, die\nMarktteilnehmern finanzielle St\u00e4rke einer Bank signalisieren und die daher in der\nempirischen Literatur zum Testen des Bankkreditkanals herangezogen werden,\nals insignifikant. Da die Mehrheit der deutschen Banken in\nLiquidit\u00e4tsnetzwerken organisiert ist, \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen wir auch, ob der\nBankkreditkanal eventuell \u00fcber die jeweiligen Girozentralen wirken kann. Jedoch\nk\u00f6nnen wir daf\u00fcr keinerlei Indizien finden. Zusammenfassend l\u00e4sst sich\nfeststellen, dass unsere Ergebnisse auf die Existenz eines Bankkapitalkanals in\nDeutschland hinweisen.\nContents\n2 Related Literature and Theoretical Hypotheses 2\n3 The Empirical Model and Methods 5\n4.1 Asymmetrical Reactions to Monetary Policy 10\n1 Introduction\nThe issue of how monetary policy is transmitted to the real economy remains far\nfrom being resolved, although some major theoretical and empirical progress has\nbeen made recently.1 For a long time, most economists did not assign any active\nrole to banks in the transmission of monetary policy. The bank lending channel\ntheory has altered this view, predicting that real economic effects of a monetary\ntightening are amplified by small banks with weak liquidity positions. When the\nmarket for bank debt is imperfect, these banks have to cut their loan supply after\na monetary tightening. The empirical evidence for the United States indeed\nshows this pattern (Kashyap and Stein, 2000). But the evidence is at best mixed\nfor Europe in general (Angeloni et al., 2003) and Germany in particular (Worms,\nThe difference in the way German and US banks react to changes in monetary\npolicy is related to the structure of the banking system. More than two thirds of\nGerman banks are organized in liquidity networks. When the central bank\ntightens monetary policy, large head institutions inject liquidity into the system,\nthereby countervailing restrictive effects (Ehrmann and Worms, 2004).\nFurthermore, a major part of German banks is owned by local authorities and all\ntheir liabilities were guaranteed by the government until July 2005. Hence, they\nfaced, at most, lax refinancing constraints.\nRecently, a new strand of the literature has given a prominent role to banks\nand their regulatory capital buffers in monetary policy transmission, even under a\nfrictionless market for bank debt. The bank capital channel theory predicts that\nbanks that are subject to capital regulation may cut their loan supply after a\nmonetary tightening in an imperfect market for bank equity (Van den Heuvel,\nOur paper tests for the existence of the bank capital channel, taking into\naccount the specific features of the German banking system. The idea is that\nbanks try to avoid the cost of falling below the regulatory minimum capital\nrequirements by holding capital buffers and asset buffers, i.e. short-term risk-\nweighted assets (other than customer loans) that can be liquidated if the bank has\ntrouble complying with the capital requirement. A monetary tightening leads to\n____________________\n1 For a quite broad but somewhat outdated overview, see Symposium on the\nMonetary Transmission Mechanism, Mishkin (1995). For European evidence, see\n2 For macroeconometric evidence, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2005).\ncosts for banks, with a time-to-maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities.\nHence, if these banks additionally have low asset and capital buffers, they are\nexpected to react more restrictively, as for them, the expected value of the costs\nof violating the capital regulation increases.\nThese hypotheses are tested using regulatory bank-level data on German\nbanks. We find evidence that a bank capital channel exists. Banks with a low\nregulatory capital buffer and a low asset buffer react more restrictively after a\nmonetary tightening than the average bank. This phenomenon can be observed\nfor the whole sample as well as for savings banks and for credit cooperatives,\nwhich are both organized in liquidity networks. We have no indication that a low\ncapital buffer of head institutions leads to a more restrictive behavior of the\nrespective liquidity network members.\nWith respect to the effect of macroeconomic variables on bank lending, we\nfind that a monetary tightening (GDP growth) has the expected negative\n(positive) effect on bank lending. Interestingly, we detect an omitted variable\nbias if we do not include a measure of interest rate volatility. Banks are found to\nlend less in times of volatile interest rates. This is a novel finding for Germany.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the theoretical\nliterature on the bank capital channel and derives hypotheses. Section 3 presents\nthe empirical model and the methodology. Section 4 gives the empirical results,\nand Section 5 concludes.\n2 Related Literature and Theoretical Hypotheses\nAccording to the bank lending channel theory, monetary policy affects the supply\nof intermediated credit, particularly bank loans, and is active through an\nimperfect market for bank debt. A restrictive monetary policy leads to a drop of\nbanks' reservable and typically insured deposits. Only banks that have a larger\nshare of liquid assets or that are bigger are able to shield their lending\nrelationships. The former can draw on their liquid assets, whereas the latter have\nbetter access to external finance due to their size. Hence, they do not have to curb\ntheir lending as sharply as their small or less liquid peers (see Bernanke and\nGertler, 1995). The same may be true for banks with a bigger capital-to-assets\nratio: Market participants may perceive highly capitalized banks as being less\nrisky (Kishan and Opiela, 2000). Consequently, it should be more expensive for\npoorly capitalized banks to finance externally. If debtors do not have perfect\nsubstitutes for loans, banks' restrictive lending behavior constitutes a cost to\nthem. As a consequence, the bank lending channel theory predicts a real\neconomic effect in addition to conventional channels, which would not exist\nunder a perfect market for debt.\nEmpirically, banks with a lower ratio of cash and securities (i.e. liquidity) to\ntotal assets react more restrictively to a tightening of monetary policy in the\nUnited States (Kashyap and Stein, 2000). The result is attributable to small banks\nand thus provides evidence in favor of the bank lending channel theory.3 The\nevidence for Europe is somewhat mixed and depends very much on the structure\nof the national banking system.4 Worms (2003) concluded in an empirical study\nfor Germany that small banks with low liquidity do not necessarily react more\nrestrictively to a monetary policy tightening than their peers. However, banks\nreduce lending more sharply the lower their ratio of short-term interbank\nliquidity to total assets. A reaction along the lines of the traditional bank lending\nchannel based on the size criterion can only be found when controlling for the\ninfluence of interbank liquidity. Ehrmann and Worms (2004) show in a related\npaper that German savings banks and credit cooperatives use their head\ninstitutions for liquidity management: The head institutions accept short-term\ndeposits from the local banks and provide longer-term loans in return. As a\nconsequence, criteria such as the size of a bank, which would lead to an\nasymmetric reaction in a banking system without liquidity networks, are partially\nundone in the German banking system.\nIn addition, local savings banks and credit cooperatives may not be subject to\nsignificantly different costs of finance.5 As mentioned, most German banks use\ntheir head institutions for liquidity management. Even without sufficient short-\nterm deposits at their head institutions, they can re-finance with similar\nconditions at their head institutions and are thus not subject to a lemon's\npremium incurred by market participants. This is amplified by the fact that local\nsavings banks and their head institutions enjoyed government guarantees until\nJuly 2005 (\"Gew\u00e4hrtr\u00e4gerhaftung\").6 Besides, for the majority of credit\n____________________\n3 The result was recently challenged by Baum et al. (2004a). They write that the\ndescribed pattern is much weaker and thus economically potentially not as relevant\nwhen taking market volatility into account. For a theoretical explanation, see Baum\n4 For a summary of the most recent results, see Angeloni et al. (2003).\n5 Differences in the costs of finance depending on bank-specific criteria, however,\nare necessary in the theoretical model developed by Ehrmann et al. (2003), which\nwas used for a number of empirical studies.\n6 Their owners (cities, municipalities, rural districts for savings banks and states plus\nthe local savings banks for the head institutions) guaranteed all liabilities. Thus, in\nthe past, all institutes in the savings bank sector enjoyed the status of a de facto\ncooperatives and savings banks, the amount of customer deposits is bigger than\nof the credit cooperatives and for about 60% of the savings banks in our sample.7\nThus, these banks have no need for external finance.\nAt first glance, the empirical finding by Worms (2003) that interbank liquidity\nmatters a lot in Germany seems to contradict our hypothesis. But the bank capital\nmore light on this issue. The bank capital channel is active through an imperfect\nmarket for bank equity. A restrictive monetary policy directly affects banks via\nmaturity transformation costs, since they typically have a maturity mismatch\nbetween assets and liabilities.8 As a consequence, banks incur losses or make\nsmaller-than-expected profits, affecting their capital. Since it is costly (or almost\nimpossible for most German banks) to raise new equity, banks that are poorly\ncapitalized will have to cut lending to keep an adequate regulatory capital buffer\nand to reduce the risk of violating the capital requirements.9 There are three\nnecessary conditions for the bank capital channel to be operative: an imperfect\nmarket for bank equity, a maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities\nexposing banks to interest rate risks, and the existence of minimum capital\nrequirements. All of these conditions are fulfilled in Germany. First of all, locally\norganized banks are owned either by government institutions or by their\nmembers. Hence, it is very difficult for them to raise new equity. But even\npublicly listed companies are subject to financial frictions. Second, descriptive\nstatistics show that German banks perform maturity transformation (see\nAppendix B). Finally, all German banks are subject to minimum capital\nrequirements.\nVan den Heuvel (2002a) presents indirect evidence that the bank capital\nchannel exists in the United States. When a state's banking sector starts out with\na low capital-to-assets ratio, its subsequent output growth is more sensitive to\nchanges to the monetary policy indicator.\nWithout using regulatory data, it is not clear a priori whether a more\nrestrictive reaction of banks after a monetary tightening is driven by higher costs\n____________________\nAAA rating (although most of them were not officially rated), and there was no\ndefault risk for non-insured liabilities.\n7 Measured as time periods when banks had more customer deposits than customer\nloans. Free savings banks are not included in this number, since they follow\ndifferent economic dynamics.\n8 Loans typically have a longer time to maturity than deposits. Maturity\ntransformation is regarded as one of the main functions of a bank (see e.g. Freixas\n9 According to Basel I, 8% of the loan volume has to be held as capital (there are\nexceptions for government and other specific loans).

Hence, three studies\non European countries (Austria, Italy, and Switzerland) use regulatory data. They\ndo, in fact, find evidence supporting the bank capital channel, as banks with\nlower regulatory capital buffers10 are found to react more restrictively to a\nThere is no microeconometric study for Germany so far that uses regulatory\ncapital to analyze the transmission of monetary policy. This paper tries to fill the\ngap.\n3 The Empirical Model and Methods\nIn this section, we describe our empirical approach. First, we derive our\nestimation equation and the hypothesis to be tested later in the paper. We\nsubsequently discuss the employed econometric methods.\nVan den Heuvel (2003) develops a dynamic model that shows that banks'\nlending response to monetary policy depends on their capital structure. He\nillustrates in a calibrated model that monetary policy can change the supply of\nbank loans through its impact on bank equity. However, his model is not suited\nto derive a reduced form for the reaction of banks to monetary policy depending\non their bank-specific criteria and of course does not take into account certain\nspecial features of the German banking system, such as liquidity networks.\nHence, in order to test the bank capital channel, we extend the standard model\nused in the empirical literature (see, for instance, Kashyap and Stein (2000);\n____________________\n10 Some other studies use \"excess capital\" synonymously for \"capital buffer.\"\n11 Engler et al. (2005) interpret this result in the context of the traditional bank\nlending channel, since they cannot find any evidence that Austrian savings banks\nand credit cooperatives perform significant maturity transformation.\nfollowing dynamic reduced form structure:\nln ln\nit j it j it it it\nj\nj it j t j j it j it j t j\nj j\nj it j it j t j j it j\nj\nLoans Loans Capital Buffer Asset Buffer Risk\nRho MP Capital Buffer Rho MP\nAsset Buffer Rho MP Capital Buffer Asset Bu\n   \n \n \n- - - -\n=\n- - - - -\n= =\n- - - -\n=\n =  + + + +\n+  +  +\n+  +\n\u00a6\n\u00a6 \u00a6\nit j it j t j\nj\nt it\nffer Rho MP\nTimeDummies u\n\n- - -\n=\n +\n+ +\n\u00a6\n\u00a6\nwhere  is the first-difference operator, Loans denotes domestic customer loans\n(loans to government institutions and financial institutions excluded),12 MP\ndenotes the monetary policy indicator, and Risk denotes asset risk. Rho is a proxy\nfor the cost a bank incurs when facing a one-percentage-point increase in the\nmonetary policy indicator. Hence, Rho*MP is a proxy for the maturity\ntransformation costs. i and t refer to the bank and time dimension, respectively. A\ndetailed description of all variables can be found in Appendix A.

Even if banks are not subject to\ndifferent costs of finance, as in the bank lending channel theory,13 monetary\npolicy can lead to an asymmetric reaction as predicted by the bank capital\nchannel literature. If a bank faces maturity transformation costs due to an\nincrease in the market interest rate, the risk of violating the capital requirement\nincreases, especially when it is short on its asset and capital buffer. The more\nshort-term risk-weighted assets (other than customer loans) the bank holds on its\nbalance sheet (i.e. the higher the bank's asset buffer), the lower the risk of\nviolating the capital requirements will be: The short-term risk-weighted assets\n____________________\n12 The change in loans is an approximation for newly issued loans.\n13 In the baseline regression we omit the bank lending channel option. In a robustness\ncheck, we assume that the amount of inflowing deposits is driven by the stance of\nmonetary policy to incorporate the features of the bank lending channel into the\nmodel. As a consequence, monetary policy can be transmitted via the head\ninstitution of the liquidity network of banks.\nwill soon be liquid, thereby reducing the capital requirement in the near future.\nAlso, the higher the bank's capital buffer, the lower the risk of violating the\ncapital requirement will be. If the asset and capital buffer are not sufficiently\nhigh, given maturity transformation costs the bank faces a higher risk of violating\nthe capital regulation after a monetary tightening. Thus, it may decide to cut its\nloan supply by more than its peers in order to restore adequate capital and asset\nbuffers. Even if banks are not pure profit maximizers, they will weigh the risk of\nviolating the capital requirements against other objectives, such as relationship\nbanking.\nThe empirical specification is very similar in spirit to Worms (2003), who\nuses an interaction between different bank-specific variables and the money\nmarket rate to test for the bank lending channel. We deviate in two ways from his\nspecification. First of all, we use the capital buffer instead of the capital-to-\nassets-ratio, since we consider the distance from the regulatory threshold as the\nrelevant criterion for the bank capital channel. Second, the bank-specific\nvariables are not interacted with the market interest rate, but with the proxy for\nmaturity transformation costs (Rho*MP), as low buffers will only affect a bank\naccording to the bank capital channel theory if it faces maturity transformation\ncosts.14 In Appendix A, it can be seen that almost all German banks have a\nlonger time-to-maturity of assets than liabilities, i.e. they have a positive Rho.\nThus, the bigger Rho, the more exposed is a bank to interest rate increases, and\nthe more pronounced should be its reaction in terms of loan volume reduction.\nWe consider the double interaction of the asset and capital buffer as very\nimportant, since it captures the interaction between both variables, i.e. it\nconditions one on the other. Intuitively, a bank should be very cautious if it is\nlow on both types of buffers, whereas having either a significantly high asset or\ncapital buffer may reduce the risk of violating the capital requirements\nsignificantly.\nAs we do not know the right set of macro variables in advance and as there is\nalways the danger of not capturing the time effects properly and thus obtaining\nseriously biased coefficients for the micro variables, we replace all macro\nvariables in the baseline regression with a set of time dummies. This comes with\na price tag: we do not know how the average bank will react to interest rate\nchanges and other macro variables. To overcome this problem, we experiment\nlater to find out which set of macro variables leads to similar estimated\ncoefficients for the micro variables.\nTo capture the dynamics fully, we add lags to explanatory variables.\nFurthermore, we add the asset and capital buffer as level terms to keep our\nestimated specification as general as possible and to prevent an omitted variables\nbias.\n____________________\nFor expositional simplicity, we do not show the full (short-term) dynamics\nwhen giving the regression results in Section 4 but instead confine ourselves to\nshowing the \"long-term\" coefficients. For instance, we calculate the \"long-term\"\ncoefficient  using the following formula:\nj j\nj j\n  \n= =\n= -\n\u00a6 \u00a6 .\nThe other \"long-term\" coefficients are calculated accordingly.\nTaking as the null hypothesis that German banks do not react along the lines\nof the bank capital channel, we can state our hypothesis in terms of the\ncoefficients  ,  , and  as follows:15\nWe expect banks with a lower capital buffer to react more restrictively if they\nface maturity transformation costs ( >0) caused by a monetary tightening.\nSimilarly, we expect the same for banks with a lower asset buffer ( >0). Finally,\nwe expect that banks that are weak in both categories are at a disproportionately\nhigh risk of running into trouble with the capital regulation. We therefore expect\nthem to react much more restrictively ( <0). For the capital channel to be at\nwork, at least one of these three estimated long-term coefficients has to show the\nexpected significant sign and none of the other coefficients may show an\nunexpected significant sign. For the double interaction term (<0), it is important\nto know whether it is driven by banks with low or high capital and asset buffers.\nThe latter would lead to the counterintuitive result that banks with high asset and\ncapital buffers react more restrictively to a monetary tightening than their peers.\nThis will be analyzed in a robustness check.\nIn the following analysis, we use two measures of banks' asset buffers. The\nfirst measure contains short-term interbank assets with a maturity of up to one\nyear, whereas the second one additionally includes shares and securities\nholdings. While short-term interbank assets are not subject to interest rate risk,\nsecurities and shares may suffer significant losses if the interest rate increases.\nThese losses may prevent sales, which means that the first measure therefore\ncontains more highly liquid assets than the second measure.\nFurther, short-term interbank loans may serve a double function. Local banks\ndeposit short-term funds at their respective head institutions in the liquidity\nnetwork and obtain long-term loans in return (Ehrmann and Worms, 2004). Thus,\nthe more short term loans a bank holds at the interbank market, the less it is\nexposed to maturity transformation costs. Hence, banks can use this instrument\n____________________\n15 Please note that Capital Buffer and Asset Buffer are demeaned and hence take on\nnegative values for banks with low buffers (see Appendix A for details).\nas a hedging mechanism. This, in turn, also reduces the risk of violating the\ncapital requirements.\nThe question as to whether a potential differential reaction of banks to\nmonetary policy based on the first asset buffer (short-term interbank loans) is\ndriven more by the described asset buffer function or by its hedging\ncharacteristics goes beyond the scope of this study. As a consequence, we stay\nagnostic in what follows and call the first asset buffer interbank liquidity, thus\nleaving this question to the critical reader and future research.\n3.2 Econometric Approach\nGiven Eq. (1), we employ dynamic panel data techniques that control for the\nbank-specific effects\ni\n\u00b5 . We take the first difference of the model specified in\nEq. (1) in order to eliminate the individual effect\ni\n\u00b5 , and we try to find suitable\ninstruments for the lagged endogenous variable. Arellano and Bond (1991)\nsuggest a generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator that uses the entire\nset of lagged values of the endogenous variable as instruments. Arellano and\nconditions are valid if the autoregressive process is mean-stationary: then, first\ndifferences of the endogenous variable are uncorrelated with the individual effect\ni\n\u00b5 and can thus be used as instruments for equations in levels. In order to obtain\nthe efficient GMM estimator, both sets of moment conditions have to be\ncombined to obtain the \"system GMM estimator\" proposed by Blundell and\nBond (1998). Given the potential endogeneity of the other bank-specific\nvariables, Capital Buffer and Asset Buffer, we also include GMM-style\ninstruments for these variables. We only use a sub-sample of the whole history of\nthe series as instruments in the later cross-section. To determine the optimal lag\nlength of the instruments, we use the Hansen test as the specification criterion\nAs, for our sample, the one- and two-step Blundell-Bond system GMM\nestimator produce quite similar estimates, we present only the (asymptotically)\nmore efficient two-step estimates. However, the two-step estimates of the\nstandard errors tend to be severely downward biased (Arellano and Bond, 1991;\nBlundell and Bond, 1998). To compensate, we use the finite-sample correction to\nthe two-step covariance matrix derived by Windmeijer (2005).\nSince the econometric literature has pointed out that GMM estimations may\ndeliver inconsistent results too (see e.g. Bound and Baker, 1993), Appendix C\nadditionally shows results from fixed effects regressions as a robustness check.\nAlvarez and Arellano (2003) find that the GMM estimates are close to fixed\neffect estimates for panels with a large time dimension.16 We therefore expect\nthe two methodologies to yield qualitatively similar results.\n4 Empirical Results\nOur dataset consists of bank-level confidential supervisory data on German\nuniversal banks (commercial banks, savings banks with their central giro\ninstitutions, and credit cooperatives with their central giro institutions) for the\nMonetary Union). The variable definition and the treatment of outliers and\nmergers are described in full detail in Appendix A.\nIn the following subsections, we first present the results of estimating Eq. (1).\nWe then give additional evidence that the results are indeed in line with the\ncapital channel. Finally, we show that our results may also be economically\nsignificant.\n4.1 Asymmetrical Reactions to Monetary Policy\nBaseline Regression\nTable 1 shows the long-term coefficients obtained from estimating Eq. (1) and\nthe specification tests (Hansen test and the tests of serial correlation in the first-\ndifferenced residuals). Since the results obtained from fixed effects are\nqualitatively the same and differ only in magnitude (see Table A3 in\nAppendix C), we confine ourselves to discussing the results obtained from the\nBlundell-Bond procedure, unless we consider differences to be insightful.\nFirst, in the baseline regression with time dummies, the estimated coefficient\nfor the interaction term of Interbank Liquidity and Maturity Transformation\n____________________\n16 Like the GMM estimator, the fixed effects estimator also wipes out the\ni\n\u00b5 .\nHowever, it is still biased of O(1/T), and its consistency depends on T being large\n(Nickell 1981). In our case, T is about 20 and, hence, larger than in most panel\ndatasets. We therefore opt to complement our GMM estimates with fixed effects\nestimates.\nCosts is found to be significant and positive, while the interaction term between\nCapital Buffer and Maturity Transformation Costs is found to be insignificant.\nThis means that banks with below-average interbank liquidity react in a more\nstrongly negative way to a monetary tightening than their average peers, which\ngives support to hypothesis H1\n.\nSecond, the interaction term between Capital Buffer, Interbank Liquidity, and\nMaturity Transformation Costs is found to be significant and negative. This\nindicates that there is a meaningful interaction between the interbank liquidity\nand the capital buffer. Banks with both a low capital buffer and low interbank\nliquidity react more restrictively to an increase in the interest rate than their peers\nwhich have, for instance, only a low interbank liquidity, thus giving support to\nhypothesis H1\n: The lower the capital buffer and the interbank liquidity, the higher\nthe risk they face of violating the capital requirements. As a consequence, banks\nwith a low capital buffer and low interbank liquidity act more restrictively than\ntheir average peers when they face maturity transformation costs after a monetary\ntightening.\nThe sign of the estimated coefficient of the interaction term of Capital Buffer,\nInterbank Liquidity, and Maturity Transformation Costs may also indicate that\nhighly capitalized banks with an above-average asset buffer also react more\nrestrictively to an increase in the interest rate (due to the normalization). This last\neffect would clearly be counterintuitive. Hence, in the following subsection, we\nanalyze whether the significant and negative sign of the coefficient is driven by\nhighly or poorly capitalized banks. To do so, we assign dummies according to\ntheir average capitalization in the next section.\nTable 1: Long-Term Coefficients for Estimating Eq. (1)--Blundell-Bond\nBaseline Baseline\nDependent Variable:\nLoan Growth Without Macro Variables With Macro Variables\nTime Dummies Yes No\nNotes: The table gives the long-term coefficients based on Blundell-Bond two-step estimations with\nWindmeijer corrections of Eq. (1). The dependent variable is Loan Growth, measured as the quarterly\ngrowth rate of domestic loans to non-financial firms and to private customers. Risk is defined as new loan\nloss provisions plus loan write-offs divided by total loans. Capital Buffer is defined as regulatory capital\nminus risk-weighted assets divided by total assets. Asset Buffer is defined as short-term interbank claims\ndivided by total assets. Rho is a proxy for the maturity transformation cost a bank faces after a one-\npercentage-point increase in the monetary policy indicator. MP is defined as the absolute change in the\nthree-month EURIBOR (=monetary policy indicator). GDP Growth is defined as quarterly growth rate of\nreal GDP. For better readability of the table, the estimated coefficients for Rho* MP are rescaled by the\nfactor 10-2, Capital Buffer * Rho* MP and Interbank Liquidity * Rho * MP by 10-4 and Capital Buffer\n* Interbank Liquidity * Rho* MP by 10-6. t-statistics are given in brackets. ***, **, and * indicate\nstatistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels, respectively, in a two-tailed t-test. Hansen test\nrefers to the test of overidentifying restrictions. AR(1) and AR(2) test refer to the test for the null of no\nfirst-order and second-order autocorrelation in the first-differenced residuals. For the Hansen, the AR(1),\nand the AR(2) tests, p-values are shown.\nIf we use the quarterly changes of the Euribor and the real GDP growth rate\ninstead of the full set of time dummies, we obtain similar results for the\ninteraction term of Capital Buffer, Interbank Liquidity, and Maturity\nTransformation Cost. But the significant coefficient for the interaction term of\nInterbank Liquidity and Maturity Transformation Costs cannot be replicated. As\nexpected, lending depends positively on real GDP growth. The estimated\ncoefficient for interest rate changes is negative, but surprisingly not significant.\nThe described results and the rejection of the Hansen test (although the\nautocorrelation tests of second and higher order show no problems) indicate that\nthe two macro variables are unable to capture the time effects entirely and/or we\nhave chosen an inappropriate set of instruments. This issue will be discussed in\nmore detail in the dummy approach in the next section.\nIf we use the second asset buffer measure (instead of interbank liquidity),\nwhich also includes securities and shares, we find no evidence throughout the\nentire sample that banks react asymmetrically with respect to this measure.\nInterestingly, if we split the sample according to banking groups (not shown\nhere), for savings banks, the second asset buffer measure delivers estimation\nresults that are qualitatively similar to those for interbank liquidity. The\nestimated coefficient for the interaction term of Capital Buffer, Asset Buffer 2,\nand Maturity Transformation Costs is negative and significant at the 5% level.\nThe critical reader may wonder if this result is driven by the interbank liquidity,\nwhich is also contained in this measure. But the correlation between the two asset\nbuffers is only 0.23 in the savings bank sector. Since we do not find similar\npatterns in the subsample for credit cooperatives or the entire sample, we leave\nthis issue for future micro banking research and concentrate on the first asset\nbuffer (interbank liquidity) in what follows.\nThere are two possible explanations why the interbank liquidity performs far\nbetter in the overall sample: First, shares and securities are subject to interest rate\nrisk and may thus not be sufficiently liquid to serve as an asset buffer. When\nbanks face maturity transformation costs after a monetary tightening, these\nassets' value may deteriorate. Alternatively, the additional hedging function of\ninterbank liquidity, as described in Section 3, might render them more important.\nThe estimated coefficient for Maturity Transformation Costs is insignificant\nin Specifications (1) and (2), indicating that banks do not react to maturity\ntransformation costs as such, but only in interaction with the asset and capital\nbuffer. This result is in line with our theoretical setting. Although maturity\ntransformation costs reduce the current profit of a bank, they are sunk costs.\nTheir current magnitude is determined by the term structure of assets and\nliabilities one period before, which cannot be affected by the contemporary loan\npolicy. Thus, banks only react more restrictively to maturity transformation costs\nif they belong to the group of poorly capitalized and low liquidized banks.\nThe baseline regression furthermore shows that, higher Risk leads to a\nsignificant decrease in loan growth: As increasing credit risk increases the need\nto build up capital buffers, banks with a more risky loan portfolio have a slower\nloan growth.\nNeither the capital buffer nor the interbank liquidity shows a significant\ninfluence on the average loan growth in our sample. Interestingly, the fixed effect\nregressions indicate that banks with a bigger asset or capital buffer have a faster\nloan growth.\nDummies\nIn order to see whether the significant negative coefficient of the interaction term\nof Capital Buffer, Interbank Liquidity, and Maturity Transformation Costs we\nhave detected is driven by banks with high or low capital buffers, we define\ndummy variables that capture the capitalization of banks. We assign one dummy\nto banks that are, on average, below the 50th percentile of excess capitalization\n(Low) and one dummy to those banks above this threshold (High).17 Each\ndummy is multiplied by the interaction term of interbank liquidity and maturity\ntransformation costs. This allows us to disentangle the effects in the full\nspecification and to assign them to poorly and well capitalized banks. We are\naware that the threshold is arbitrary and therefore check to see whether the results\ndepend on the chosen threshold.18\nln ln\nit j it j i it i it it\nj\nj i it j t j j i it j t j\nj j\nj i it j it j t j j i\nj\nLoans Loans LowAsset Buffer High Asset Buffer Risk\nLowRho MP HighRho MP\nLowAsset Buffer Rho MP High Asset Buffe\n   \n \n \n- - - -\n=\n- - - -\n= =\n- - -\n=\n =  + + + +\n+  +  +\n+  +\n\u00a6\n\u00a6 \u00a6\nit j it j t j\nj\nt it\nr Rho MP\nTimeDummies u\n\n- - -\n=\n +\n+ +\n\u00a6\n\u00a6\nTable 2 shows the regression results for Eq. (2). Like the baseline regression,\nhigher Risk is found to lead to a significant decrease in loan growth. Further, the\ninteraction term between Interbank Liquidity and Maturity Transformation Costs\ncorresponds to the interaction term between Capital Buffer, Interbank Liquidity,\nand Maturity Transformation Costs in the baseline specification shown in\n____________________\n17 Without previously normalizing excess capital to zero, the sample split for credit\ncooperatives and savings banks delivers similar results.\n18 To check for robustness, we validated all results obtained from the dummy\napproach by using an equivalent sample split for poorly and highly capitalized\nbanks, which is somewhat less restrictive with respect to the imposed dynamics\n(for instance, not assigning the same estimated coefficients for the lagged\ndependent variable for both types of banks). Since this approach leads to the same\nconclusions, we do not show the estimated coefficients.\nTable 1. The regression results show that the interaction term between Interbank\nLiquidity and Maturity Transformation Costs is significant and positive only for\npoorly capitalized banks and insignificant for well capitalized banks. Hence,\npoorly capitalized banks react more restrictively to an increase in maturity\ntransformation costs if they have below-average interbank liquidity.\nHowever, the reaction of highly capitalized banks to a change in the interest\nrate does not depend on interbank liquidity. Again, these findings support the\nhypothesis that the asset buffer plays an important role in interaction with the\ncapital buffer, namely for poorly capitalized banks.\nAs a robustness check, we run the same exercise and assign one dummy to the\nlowest capitalized 25% of banks, one to banks capitalized within the 25% to 75%\nrange, and a third to the highest capitalized 25% of banks. The estimated\ncoefficient for the lowest capitalized banks is positive and significant at the 5%\nlevel, while banks in the middle range show a positive, albeit insignificant sign,\nand the best capitalized banks a negative and insignificant sign. This confirms\nthat the asymmetry is driven by the lowest capitalized banks in interaction with\ntheir interbank liquidity.\nIf we replace the time dummy specification with a set of macro variables, the\nquarterly changes in the Euribor and the real growth rate of GDP, we obtain the\nsame qualitative results for the interaction terms, thus confirming the\naforementioned hypotheses. As expected, the reaction to real GDP growth is\nhighly significant and positive, thus capturing loan demand effects. As in the\nbaseline specification, the estimated long-run coefficient for interest rate changes\nis insignificant.\nHowever, the implausible insignificance of MP disappears if we include a\nvolatility measure for the monetary policy indicator (calculated based on daily\ndata; see Appendix A for details) into the regression, as suggested by Baum\n(2004a, b). As a consequence, the estimated coefficient for MP gains\nsignificance and increases in magnitude. The latter also holds for the estimated\nGDP coefficient. The volatility measure itself is found to be highly significant\nand negative, indicating that higher interest rate volatility results in lower lending\nactivity on average. The big changes in the estimated coefficients for the other\ntwo macroeconomic variables show that Specification (2), which only includes\nreal GDP growth and interest rate changes instead of the full set of time\ndummies, suffers from a severe omitted variable bias.\nBaum et al. (2004b) argue that banks behave more homogenously during\ntimes of greater macroeconomic uncertainty, since macroeconomic volatility\nprevents them from foreseeing investment opportunities. The inclusion of\nmacroeconomic volatility by Baum et al. (2004a) weakens the results in favor of\nthe bank lending channel, which was assembled by Kashyap and Stein (2000) for\nthe United States.\nTable 2: Long-Term Coefficients for Estimating Eq.

To improve the readability\nof the table, the estimated coefficients for Rho*MP are rescaled by the factor 10-2, Capital Buffer*Rho*\nMP and Interbank Liquidity*Rho*MP by 10-4, Capital Buffer*Interbank Liquidity*Rho*MP by 10-6,\nVolatility by 104, and Interbank Liquidity*Volatility by 102. t-statistics are given in brackets. For savings\nbanks, we use only three lags of the endogenous variables, since this is sufficient to capture the dynamics.\n***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels, respectively, in a two-\ntailed t-test. Hansen test refers to the test of overidentifying restrictions. AR(1) and AR(2) test refer to the\ntest for the null of no first-order and second-order autocorrelation in the first-differenced residuals. For\nthe Hansen, the AR(1), and the AR(2) tests, p-values are shown.\nUnlike in Baum (2004a), the finding that banks react asymmetrically to\ninterest rate changes (expressed by the interaction terms of Interbank Liquidity\nand Maturity Transformation Costs) remains unaffected by the inclusion of the\nvolatility measure. The estimated coefficient for the interaction term remains\nsimilar, whereas the magnitude and significance level even increase somewhat in\nthe Blundell-Bond estimation. Furthermore, the estimated coefficient for the\ninteraction term of Volatility and Interbank Liquidity is insignificant.\nThus, interestingly, German banks do not seem to be affected by Baum's\ncritique that the result of an asymmetric reaction of banks to monetary policy is\nweakened or even undone by including second moments. We hypothesize that\nhis point may be more relevant to the bank lending channel than to the bank\ncapital channel. We would tend to expect poorly capitalized banks to act more\ncautiously if they cannot foresee investment opportunities properly.\nAll in all, the dummy approach underlines the hypothesis that banks with a\nlow capital buffer and a low interbank liquidity react more restrictively to\nmonetary policy than the average bank.\n4.2 Further Evidence\nIn this subsection, we present several pieces of evidence that lend additional\nsupport to our finding in favor of the bank capital channel. First, we analyze\nwhether maturity transformation costs, as defined by our proxy (see\nAppendix A), are able to influence the interest income of banks significantly.\nThis is an important precondition for the bank capital channel to be active.\nSecond, we check to see if the asymmetric reaction is driven by a bank lending\nchannel-type mechanism. Therefore, we check (i) to see if banks react differently\ndepending on the customer deposits relative to customer loans on their balance\nsheet and (ii) if savings banks, which are organized in liquidity networks, react\nasymmetrically depending on the bank-specific criteria of their respective head\ninstitution.\nInterest Income\nThe bank capital channel theory argues that a monetary tightening reduces bank\nprofits, as banks face maturity transformation costs. Thus, poorly capitalized\nbanks have to reduce lending, as they see their capital position deteriorating even\nfurther or are not able to reestablish a sustainable capital buffer. Hence, a\nnecessary precondition for the bank capital channel to be at work is deteriorating\nprofits after a monetary tightening. We test this precondition by regressing\nbanks' interest income on their maturity transformation costs. As interest income\nis available only on a yearly basis, we use a yearly dataset in this subsection (see\nTable 3 for results).\nSpecification 1 shows that maturity transformation costs have a highly\nsignificant effect on interest income. As we do not include control variables other\nthan time dummies, it is particularly important to rule out autocorrelation in the\nerror term. However, if we allow for an AR(1) process in the error term\n(Specification 2) or include lagged interest income in the fixed effects estimation\n(Specification 3) or Blundell-Bond estimation (not shown here), the result is\nqualitatively unaffected.\nIn sum, banks are found to face maturity transformation costs after a\nmonetary tightening that reduces their interest income. The existence of this\nprecondition for the bank capital channel to be at work strongly supports our\nargument that the detected decline in bank lending by poorly capitalized banks\nafter a monetary tightening is indeed due to the bank capital channel.\nDependent Variable:\nInterest Incomet\nRobust Standard\nErrors\nAR(1) Standard\nErrors\nRobust Standard\nErrors\nInterest Incomet-1\nRhot\n*MPt\nTime Dummies Yes Yes Yes\nNotes: The table gives the coefficients based on fixed effects estimation.

It is possible that the\nmembers of a liquidity network will restrict lending after a monetary tightening if\ntheir respective head institution begins to have trouble providing sufficient\nliquidity. To test this hypothesis, we have to match the banks with their\nrespective head institution and analyze whether member banks react differently\ndepending on the head institutions' bank-specific criteria. However, for credit\ncooperatives, such an assignment does not exist, as they can re-finance at both of\ntheir head institutions. In contrast, for savings banks, there is a strict regional\nsystem for assigning local savings banks to their head institutions. We therefore\nanalyze this hypothesis for savings banks only.\nSince the head institutions of savings banks were subject to\nGew\u00e4hrtr\u00e4gerhaftung (publicly underwritten liability) during our sample period,\nthey were considered as AAA-rated banks and should not have run into trouble to\nacquire sufficient sources of finance. However, they could have reacted more\nrestrictively because of the expected cost of violating the capital rules. Thus, in\naddition to the standard specification above, we interact the monetary policy\nindicator with the excess capital position of the respective head institution:\nln ln\nit j it j it it it\nj\nj it j t j j it j it j t j\nj j\nj it j it j t j j it j\nj\nLoans Loans Capital Buffer Asset Buffer Risk\nRho MP Capital Buffer Rho MP\nAsset Buffer Rho MP Capital Buffer Asset Bu\n   \n \n \n- - - -\n=\n- - - - -\n= =\n- - - -\n=\n =  + + + +\n+  +  +\n+  +\n\u00a6\n\u00a6 \u00a6\n, ,\nit j it j t j\nj\nj headof i t j head of i t j t j t it\nj\nffer Rho MP\nCapital Buffer Rho MP TimeDummies u\n \n- - -\n=\n- - -\n=\n +\n+  + +\n\u00a6\n\u00a6 \u00a6\nThe estimated long-run coefficient of the interaction between excess capital\nand monetary policy indicator is found to be insignificant. As a consequence, we\nconclude that there are no signs that local savings banks were credit constrained\nby their head institutions.19\nBank Lending Channel\nThe critical reader may wonder whether the differences in the banks' reaction\nwith respect to their excess capitalization and interbank liquidity were driven by\n____________________\n19 Interestingly, the estimated coefficient of the second and third lag of the interaction\nterm was highly significant. This may be an indication that the bank-specific\nvariables of the head institutions have an effect on the members of the respective\nnetwork.\nthe bank lending channel rather than the bank capital channel. The reasoning\ncould go as follows: highly capitalized banks may find cheaper sources of\nunsecured finance than their poorly capitalized peers since market participants\nperceive them as less risky. Furthermore, interbank liquidity may be used to\nshelter customer loans when deposits are withdrawn.\nYet, the theoretical literature has  so far  failed to provide a consistent\nframework to test the bank capital channel against the bank lending channel. In\ntheir empirical paper, Gambacorta and Mistrulli (2004) argue that the capital\nbuffer captures the bank lending channel, while the maturity transformation costs\ncapture the bank capital channel. This line of argument is not fully convincing, as\nthe bank capital channel works through the interaction of maturity transformation\ncosts and capital. However, as the variables used to test the two channels are\neither identical or at least highly correlated, an empirical approach that separates\nthe two channels is hard to come by. We are still convinced that our results are\ndriven by the bank capital channel due to the following reasons.\nFirst, as mentioned in Section 2, a large percentage of German savings banks\nand credit cooperatives have a much larger amount of customer deposits than\nloans. For those banks, the traditional bank lending channel may not be strongly\noperative since a drop in deposits after a monetary tightening would not\nautomatically force them to seek external sources of finance.20 If we restrict our\nsample to periods where banks have more deposits than loans on the balance\nsheet, we can find the same asymmetric pattern as for the entire sample. This\ngives us a further indication that the asymmetric reaction is driven by the bank\ncapital channel.\nSecond, other bank-specific criteria that are usually used to test for the bank\nlending channel are less significant, or not significant at all. Interestingly, if we\nspecify the model without maturity transformation costs, we obtain a\nqualitatively similar pattern as before (results are not shown here, but are\navailable on request). However, if we specify our baseline equation with cash to\noverall assets instead of interbank liquidity and the capital-to-assets ratio instead\nof the excess capital, none of the estimated coefficients for the interaction terms\nis significant at conventional levels. Further, if we define a Liquidity variable that\nincludes all assets with a maturity shorter than one year and securities (unlike the\nsecond asset buffer, this measure also includes other positions such as cash), and\ninteract it with Excess Capital, we cannot obtain a significant estimated\ncoefficient. These findings do not necessarily mean that the bank lending channel\ndoes not exist. Yet, they lend further support to our hypothesis that the bank\ncapital channel is at work.\n____________________\n20 Yet, although banks with more deposits than loans can, in principle, shelter their\ncustomer loan supply after a monetary tightening, they may want to protect their\nother investments due to portfolio considerations and, hence, may cut lending.\nSummary\nThe additional evidence provided in this subsection gives support to the\nhypothesis that the asymmetric reaction that we observe is indeed due to the bank\ncapital channel, although we do not rule out the possibility that the bank lending\nchannel may exist in parallel and thus strengthen the observed pattern.\nFurthermore, there appears to be no indirect transmission via poor capitalization\nof the head institutions in the savings bank sector.\nAshcraft (2006) asks the question: \"Bank loans might be special, but should\nmacroeconomists care?\" Microeconometric evidence can only provide a first\nindication of whether the bank capital channel can possibly affect the macro\neconomy. This is only the case if loan supply movements are large enough to\ninfluence business cycle fluctuations.\nTherefore, we analyze the size of poorly capitalized banks.21 In terms of loan\nvolume (assets), they are, on average, about 2.5 (3) times bigger than their well-\ncapitalized peers (see Appendix B). Thus, in contrast to many studies for the\nbank lending channel,22 the asymmetric reaction of banks is not only driven by\nvery small banks, which are potentially irrelevant to the macro economy.\nThe regression results indicate that banks with a weak interbank liquidity\nposition and a high exposure to maturity transformation costs, behave most\nrestrictively. For simplicity, we assume that the 50 percent of banks with the\nlowest interbank-liquidity buffer and with the largest exposure to maturity\ntransformation costs are well represented by the 25th percentile within this\nsubsample. Using the estimated coefficients, these banks would react by an\naverage of around 0.2 percentage point more restrictively than the average bank\nif we take the most conservative GMM estimation and about 0.1 percentage point\nif we use the fixed effects results.23\nAfter a monetary contraction, following our regression results, we would\nexpect those banks that have the most negative values in the interaction of de-\nmeaned interbank liquidity and the most pronounced maturity mismatch between\nthe time-to-maturities of their assets and liabilities to react most restrictively.\nConsidering these banks in the sub-sample reveals that they are somewhat\nsmaller in terms of loan volume than the average bank in the sample.\n____________________\n21 Using the same definition as in the dummy approach.\n22 See e.g. Fr\u00fchwirth-Schnatter and Kaufmann (2006) for Austria.\n23 If we use a pooled regression, we obtain estimated coefficients that are in between\nthe two other coefficients.\nWithout wanting to stretch our example too far, we present a back-of-the-\nenvelope calculation that illustrates the relevance of the bank capital channel. In\n2004, the overall loan volume to companies and private clients was about  2.2\ntrillion in Germany. We assume for simplicity that, of the lower 50 percent\ncapitalized banks, half the banks with the smallest interbank liquidity and\ngreatest exposure to maturity transformation costs represents roughly about a\nquarter of the lending volume. Furthermore, we take the results from the most\nconservative estimation, saying that those banks reduce their lending by an\nadditional 0.1 percentage point in the long run (compared to their average peers)\nif the interest rate goes up by 1 percentage point. Our back-of-the-envelope\ncalculation indicates that those banks would reduce their loan supply by  600\nmillion in the long run.\nEven if banks' customers can replace loans from their \"house bank\" with\nother sources of finance, they may have to bear considerable switching costs. The\nnumbers therefore suggest that the bank capital channel may have significant\neffects in Germany, especially if the loan supply exerts a multiplier effect on real\neconomic activity. A more detailed analysis would go beyond the scope of this\nstudy and will be left for future research. To do so, it would be necessary to\nanalyze the reaction of bank customers to such a pattern, i.e. the substitutability\nof loans.\n5 Concluding Remarks\nThis paper provides evidence that the bank capital channel hypothesis is relevant\nto Germany. The outlined theoretical framework adds an asset buffer to the\nexisting theory and shows its relevance in the empirical regressions. Banks with\nlower asset and lower capital buffers that face maturity transformation costs react\nmore restrictively to a monetary tightening than their average peers.\nWe find evidence in favor of a meaningful interaction of interbank liquidity,\ncapital buffer and maturity transformation costs for the entire sample as well as\nfor the sub-samples for savings banks and credit cooperatives. Interestingly, the\nsecond asset buffer measure, which additionally contains securities and shares,\nperforms far worse than interbank liquidity. There is only some weak evidence\nfor its relevance in the savings bank sector. The underlying reason for this pattern\nmay be an interesting question for future banking research.\nThe results indicate the existence of the bank capital channel. Although the\nbank lending channel may exist in parallel, we are confident that our findings are\ndriven by the bank capital channel. However, as no framework to discriminate\nthe two channels exists, we cannot test the two channels against one another\nmore rigorously. Hence, future research on developing such an analytical\nframework would be highly desirable.\nIn terms of affected lending volume, the results seem economically significant\nand indicate that the bank capital channel may be an important source of\nmonetary policy transmission for Germany. However, the question as to the size\nof the effects can only be answered with more evidence about the substitutability\nof bank loans that are affected by potential reductions in the loan supply after a\nmonetary tightening. Furthermore, calibrated dynamic stochastic equilibrium\nmodels of the Bernanke et al. (1999) type, which could try to incorporate the\nbank capital channel explicitly, may deliver further insights into potential effects.\nBoth issues are surely a major challenge for future research.\nReferences\nAlvarez, J., and Arellano, M.

For the balance-sheet data, we\nuse every third observation in time, while for the data on loan-loss provisions, we\ndistribute the provisions over the four quarters of a year, though not uniformly:\nwe interpolate between every two subsequent years in order to avoid jump\ndiscontinuities at the end of each year.25\nThe Variables\nThe variable definitions are given in Table A1. Our two variables of interest,\nCapital Buffer and Asset Buffer, are described in more detail in the following.\nThe Capital Buffer is defined as follows:\n( )\n( ) / ( )\n( )\nit it\ni BG\nit\nit\nit t\nEC\nCapital Buffer\n= -\n\u00a6\n,\nwhere excess capital (\nit\nEC ) is actual regulatory capital minus minimum\nregulatory capital, A is total assets, and N is the number of banks. Hence, our\ncapital buffer variable is scaled by total assets and demeaned by the period's\nmean of excess capital.26 We do not use the overall period's mean, but the mean\n____________________\n24 In contrast to subsidiaries of foreign banks, we do not include branches of foreign\nbanks, as their business activities in Germany are more likely to be driven by their\nheadquarters than by euro-zone monetary policy or total economic activity in\nGermany. Further, their loan growth series often start from a very low level,\ntherefore show very high growth rates and are extremely volatile. As a\nconsequence, the inclusion of branches of foreign banks would bias the loan\ngrowth rates strongly upwards.\n25 The variable is divided by four before interpolating. To prevent an endogeneity\nbias, we start instrumenting loan-loss provisions with the fourth lag.\n26 We demean the data by the period's mean in order to remove the time trend that is\nexistent in the data. For descriptive statistics, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2005).\nof the respective banking pillar27 (BG), since the pillars differ greatly with regard\nto capitalization due to the pillars' institutional rules (see e.g. Koetter et al.,\nAsset Buffer is defined as follows\n( )\n( ) / ( )\n/\n( )\nit it\nT\ni BG\nit\nit\nj\nit t\nB\nAsset Buffer T\n= -\n\u00a6\n\u00a6\nwhere\nit\nB are assets (other than loans) that have a non-zero regulatory risk\nweight and a short time-to-maturity or that can be easily liquidized, A is total\nassets, N is the number of banks, and T is the number of observations over time.\nHence again, we scale our measure by total assets and normalize it by the mean\nof the respective banking group. In this case, however, we do not use the period's\nmean but the overall mean since there is no time trend visible in the data.\nWe use two different subcategories of assets to construct B and, hence, Asset\nBuffer. First, we use short-term interbank market liquidity, which consists of\ninterbank market assets with a time-to-maturity of less than one year.28 These\npositions are subject to capital requirements, although only weighted with 20%,\nand will expire within one year. Thus, they would reduce the required capital and\ncan serve as a buffer. This is our baseline measure, as it accounts for the existing\nliquidity networks in Germany. As a robustness check, we use an alternative\nmeasure that also includes shares and bonds. These two additional positions are\nalso subject to capital requirements and can easily be liquidized. The major\nshortcoming is that they are subject to interest rate risk. Liquidizing them after an\nincrease in the market interest rate may result in a loss.\nFor the calculation of market volatility, we use a procedure similar to that of\nBaum et al. (2004a). We extract the intra-quarterly volatility from daily data on\ninterbank market interest rates, government bond yields, and interest rate spreads.\nThe daily contribution to quarterly volatility is defined as:\n*\n\u00b8\n\u00b8\n\u00b7\n\u00a8\n\u00a8\n\u00a9\n\u00a7\n\n\n=\nT\ni D\nt\nd\nl\n ,\nwhere D\nt\ni\n are daily interest rate changes.29 They are normalized by the number\nof days between two observations ( T\n ). If there is, for instance, a weekend\nbetween two trading days,\nt\n rises to three.\nThe intra-quarterly volatility is defined as\n____________________\n27 We distinguish three pillars: savings banks, credit cooperatives and commercial\nbanks.\n28 This is the same measure used by Worms (2003) in a somewhat different context.\n29 We obtained the following daily data from Datastream: the three-month money\nmarket interest rate and the one-year, two-year, five-year and ten-year government\nbond yields. In addition, we calculated several term spreads thereof.\n\u00a6\n=\n= T\nt\nd\nl\nt\nt\ni\n)\n( \n\nThe different measures interest rates, yields and spreads we used showed\nsimilar results. For simplicity, we only show the results for the three-month\nEURIBOR volatility in the main part.\nRisk is defined as new loan loss provisions and loan write-offs divided by\ntotal assets. By contrast, the empirical literature normally uses non-performing\nloans as a risk proxy. However, data on non-performing loans is not available for\nGerman banks. As new loan-loss provisions and loan write-offs are only\navailable on a yearly basis, we interpolate the data linearly to obtain quarterly\ndata, as we do with our measure of Rho.\nRho is a proxy for the cost a bank faces after a monetary tightening by the\ncentral bank due to the maturity transformation and is calculated as follows:\nj\nA and\nj\nP are assets and liabilities classes with different time-to-maturity.\nThe Deutsche Bundesbank's prudential database contains six maturity classes.30\nThe sensitivities (\nj\n and\nj\n ) are obtained directly from the supervisory\nregulations.31 We divided by the average size of interest-bearing assets and\nliabilities to normalize for the size of a bank.\nIn order to determine the existence of a bank capital channel, it is necessary to\nconsider the change in a bank's profits due to a change in the interest rate. We\ntherefore need to take into account all interest-bearing assets and liabilities rather\nthan those merely existing in the trading portfolio. The extent to which a bank is\nexposed to interest rate changes is dependent on the degree of maturity mismatch\nheld by the bank.\nSince the regulatory data (maturity classes and risk) is only available on a\nyearly basis, we interpolated it linearly to obtain quarterly data.\nA positive Rho indicates maturity transformation costs. As can be seen in the\nchart below, these costs are faced by most German banks.\n____________________\n30 Interest-bearing assets and liabilities with time-to-maturity shorter than one year,\none to two years, two to three years, three to four years, four to five years, and\nabove five years.\n31 The Amendment to the Basel Accord to Incorporate Market Risks, Basle\nCommittee, January 1996.

The numbers on daily Euribor fluctuations\nwere obtained from Datastream.\nTreatment of Mergers\nDuring the observation period, the banking system underwent a strong\nconsolidation wave. For our analysis, it is important to identify these mergers, as\notherwise there would be unexplained jumps in the loan growth series, which\ncould lead to seriously biased results.\nThere are several alternative ways of treating mergers. First, banks involved\nin mergers can be completely discarded from the sample. However, as there were\nseveral hundred mergers during the observation period, especially between local\nsavings banks and between cooperative banks, this would lead to a significant\nloss of information. The second option is to merge banks backwards. This\nprocedure hinges on two assumptions. First, banks are assumed to behave as one\nentity, even pre-merger. And second, their behavior does supposedly not change\npost-merger. As these assumptions seem to be pretty severe to us, we choose the\nthird option, i.e. to create a new notional institute after two banks merge. This\ncauses the number of banks to increase, because there is one additional bank for\neach merger (the merging banks stay in the sample until the time of the merger,\nand the newly created bank after the merger). The drawback of this procedure is\nthat we lose information, since all banks with six or less observations drop out of\nthe regressions.32 If we delete all banks with less than seven observations, the\nsample shrinks by between 0.5 and 15% in terms of the banking sector's total\nTreatment of Outliers\nIn a panel framework it is crucial to identify outliers, as all banks --\nindependently of their size -- are weighted in the same way. If the sample is not\ncleaned, there is the danger of results being driven by extreme outliers. Deleting\nsingle outliers from the dataset would be extremely arbitrary. We therefore elect\nto drop the whole time series for a bank if some observations for this bank\nexceed a certain threshold. As thresholds we rely on percentiles, which we set\naccording to visual inspection of the histogram for the respective variable. If we\nrun robustness checks for different banking groups (not shown, but sometimes\nreferred to in this paper), we apply this outlier identification procedure to the\ndifferent banking groups separately. As this outlier identification procedure is\n____________________\n32 Differentiation of the dependent variable leads to a loss of one time period.\nFurthermore, four lags of the dependent variable are used as regressors. In addition,\nat least one more lag is needed for the instrumentation.\n33 The loss of information is not entirely due to the treatment of mergers, as there\nhave also been banks with less than seven periods. The attrition is of course the\nbiggest at the borders of the sample and the smallest in the middle of the sample.\nWhen we cut a bank e.g. in the first quarter of 2000 into two parts, the first five\nquarters drop out of the sample (at least seven time-series observations are needed\nto be included into the regression), whereas the later part remains.\nalso somewhat arbitrary, we run robustness checks to see if the results depend on\nthe chosen thresholds. However, they deliver the same qualitative results.\nWe use the following threshold for the standard specification, which we run\nfor savings banks and credit cooperatives. For the dependent variable Loan\nGrowth, we use the 1st and 99th percentile. For Asset Buffer, we use the 99th\npercentile only, as the variable is non-negative by construction. For Capital\nBuffer, we drop banks with negative observations: these banks may undergo\ntransitional adjustments in accordance with the supervisory authority.\nAlternatively, they may be distressed and therefore under supervisory control. In\nthis case, they could not take deliberate investment and funding decisions.\nHowever, we lack the data to discriminate between these two cases and, thus,\ndrop the negative observations. In addition, we use the 99th percentile. As a\nresult of this cleaning procedure, our remaining dataset covers about two thirds\nof the banking sector in terms of the lending volume.34\nIf we run regressions for the entire sample, we widen the cut-off values to the\n2nd and 98th percentile for loan growth and to the 98th centile for the other\nvariables. We effectively obtain a wider span of values, since they are much\nmore dispersed for commercial banks.35\nThe following two graphs (the left graph shows loan growth for the entire\nsample before cleaning, the right one after cleaning) exemplarily show the\nnecessity of a data cleaning procedure, illustrating that the uncleaned dataset\nwould deliver seriously biased results.\nDensity\nloan_growth_before_cleaning\nDensity\nloan_growth\n____________________\n34 When referring to results for the savings banks sector, we use only three lags of the\nexplanatory variables, since this was sufficient to capture the dynamics.\n35 We do not run any outlier procedure for Rho since the visual inspection revealed\nmuch fewer outliers. A robustness check showed that omitting the 1% and 99%\ncentiles of Rho leads to similar estimation results.\nAppendix B\nDescriptive Statistics\nTable A1: Descriptive Statistics36\nBanks with Low\nCapital Buffer\nBanks with High\nCapital Buffer\nWilcoxon\nTest\nMean Std.
