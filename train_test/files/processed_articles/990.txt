For example, the proportion of pork from lean cuts in `stir-fried\nfresh pepper and pork' varies between 14 and 24% in urban and rural areas and the\ntotal pork content for 100 g (dish) varies by 15 to 19 g between rural and urban areas\nin each of eight provinces. Another challenge relates to the variation in the edible\nvegetable oil content added during food preparation. Reliance on standard\nrecipes for each fried dish would miss the variations in oil use over time, space\nand socio-economic status.\nConclusions: Dietary change is rapid in transitional countries. Reliance on recipes\nstandardised for animal food and edible oil contents will lead to very large\nsystematic errors in the measurement of energy, fat and protein intakes.\n",

Also, as the epidemiological and\nnutrition transition progresses, concern for malnutrition\nand the classic maternal and child health focus has to\nshift towards a broader-based focus of diets appropriate\nfor both undernutrition and overnutrition and their\nrelation to non-communicable diseases. Our research in\nChina illustrates the challenges and the methods used to\naddress them.\nThe challenges in studying nutrition in a developing\ncountry are understood. They include incomplete food\ncomposition tables and lack of extensive research and\nexperience with individual measurement of dietary intake\nfor children and adults. For instance, the Institute of\nNutrition and Food Safety in China had never collected\nindividual food intake in a large-scale study prior to our\n1989 survey. Also, research experience in cultures where\nconsumption is directly from common dishes was\nminimal. In addition, with few processed and packaged\nfoods, individual consumption patterns might be expected\nto be more heterogeneous.\nThere are, of course, important ways that dietary\nresearch is facilitated in transitional economies such as\nChina. There is no sophisticated understanding of good\nand bad dietary patterns as they relate to disease, and so\nthere is little sense of `good' and `bad' foods. Thus there\nare fewer problems related to systematic recall biases that\naffect diet research. However, we are seeing the\nemergence of `Western ideals' for body image that might\nlead to biased responses to questions about diet in the\nfuture (Bentley, personal communication).\nThe first part of the paper presents some of the ways we\naddressed the measurement of dietary change in China.\nIncluded is an evaluation of the decision to obtain\ningredients for each composite dish from our respondents\nand not to use recipe files.

The CHNS covered eight provinces\nthat vary substantially in geography, economic develop-\nment, public resources and health indicators (Guanqxi,\nGuizhou, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Liaoning and\nShandong) for the first three panels, replacing Liaoning\nwith Heilongjiang in 1997. A multi-stage, random cluster\nprocess was used to draw the sample surveyed in each of\nthe provinces. Counties in the eight provinces were\nstratified by income (low, middle and high) and a\nweighted sampling scheme was used to randomly select\nfour counties in each province (one low-income, two\nmiddle-income, one high-income). Within each county,\nthe town where the county government is located was\nselected, and three villages were chosen randomly. In\naddition, each provincial capital and a lower-income city\nfrom each province were selected. Within each city, urban\nand suburban neighbourhoods were selected randomly.\nThe sample design consisted of 188 primary sampling\nunits, including 3870 households and covering about\n16 000 individuals. Except for part of the samples from\nGuangxi and Guizhou provinces, most persons studied\nhad a Han background (85%).\nMethods of dietary assessment\nMeasurement of household food inventory\nHousehold food consumption was determined on a daily\nbasis by calculating changes in food inventory. Chinese\nscales with a minimum and maximum limit of 20 g and\n15 kg, respectively, were used. All foods in stock at the\ninitiation of the survey (including edible oils, sugar and\nsalt), foods purchased and/or produced at home during\nthe survey period, and food preparation waste (including\nspoiled rice and food fed to animals) were weighed and\nconsidered in the calculation of household food con-\nsumption. This was the only method that was used by the\nInstitute for national and large-scale surveys prior to the\nMeasurement of individual intake\nIndividual dietary data for the same three consecutive days\nwere recorded for all household members, regardless of\nage or relationship to the household head. This was\nachieved by asking each individual, except children aged\nbelow 12 years, each day, to report all food consumed\naway from home on a 24-hour recall basis. For the\nyounger children, the mother or a mother substitute who\nhandled food preparation and feeding in the household\nwas asked to recall the child's food consumption. The\nsame daily interview was used to collect at-home\nindividual consumption. Using food models and picture\naids, trained field interviewers recorded the types,\namounts, type of meal and place of consumption of all\nfood items during 24 hours of the previous day.\nRespondents were prompted about snacks and shared\ndishes. Food items consumed at restaurants, canteens and\nother locations away from home were systematically\nrecorded. Housewives and other household members\nwere encouraged to provide additional information to use\nin determining the amounts of particular food items in\ndishes consumed in the household. The amount of each\ndish was estimated from the household inventory, and the\nproportion of each dish consumed was reported by each\nperson interviewed. Thus, the amount of individual\nconsumption was determined by the total amount in the\ndish and the proportion of the dish that each person\nconsumed.\nThere are clear reasons for collecting 24-hour dietary\nintake data. China has conquered the problems of food\nscarcity at the national level and has undergone a\nremarkable transition in the structure of food consump-\ntion. This has gone hand in hand with marked changes in\neating behaviour. For instance, away-from-home (AFH)\nfood consumption has increased in response to the\ndynamic changes in real disposable income and market\nlabour force patterns. Within-household variations in food\nintake and eating patterns appear to be expanding3. Food\nand nutrition policy is focusing less on food security\nneeds and more on the health-related needs of selected\nage\u00adgender groups. As this occurs, individual dietary\nintake becomes more important.\nThe major concern is that the traditional eating pattern\nin China involves the preparation and serving of a limited\nnumber of complex dishes. These dishes consist of staple\nand side foods. The former includes all food made of\ngrains and served in a separate bowl to each person, and\nthe latter consists of all meat and vegetable dishes cooked\nand placed in the centre of the table in big bowls or\nplates for all people to share. This pattern of household\nconsumption from common plates increases the difficulty\nof obtaining accurate measurement of individual food\nconsumption. In addition, snacks and food eaten away\nfrom home are dependent on respondent's memory.\nThese limitations have hindered the development of\ncollection of individual dietary intake data in China, as\nthey were felt to reduce the validity and precision of the\nindividual 24-hour recall method. The combination of the\ntwo methods developed for the CHNS allowed us to lessen\nthe errors associated with this eating method. Both total\nBM Popkin et al.\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Also, the\navailable FCT of China was based on food as purchased\nand grown and consisted of raw food items. It did not\nmeasure processing and preparation wastage4. This FCT\nhas been expanded to encompass closer to 2000 foods and\nnow includes adequate representation of processed foods.\nHowever, there is one gap. The Chinese FCT does not\ninclude any recipes, so measurement of AFH food intake\nmust rely on knowledge of the ingredients used in food\npreparation. Studies are underway, including work with\nthe CHNS, to collect adequate recipe data to provide at\nleast an understanding of the average components of\ncurrent dishes consumed in China.\nAssessment of oil and other condiment use\nIn China, an additional problem relates to the measure-\nment of cooking oil and other condiments used in the food\npreparation process, since the Chinese FCT is based on\nfood as purchased and not as cooked. For this reason,\nmeasurement of cooking oil would have been omitted\nfrom the traditional 24-hour recall undertaken in China.\nStir-frying is a major cooking method for Chinese dishes\nand there is no standard recipe available for most dishes.\nAny combination of vegetables and meat is regarded as a\ndish. As we shall show, the amount of cooking oil used\nwith each dish varies considerably from family to family.\nSince the amount of each dish consumed by each\nindividual within the household varies significantly, a\nmethod of allocating oil between household members was\ndeveloped that is based on meat and vegetable consump-\ntion. The proportion of meat and vegetables consumed by\neach individual from the total household consumption of\nthese food groups is calculated. This proportion is used to\nallocate household cooking oil to each individual.\nUnderlying this is the knowledge that Chinese households\nutilise frying of foods predominantly for dishes containing\nvegetables (including tofu and beans), beef, pork,\nchicken, fish and seafood. They combine edible oils,\nnormally soyabean, peanut and vegetable oils, with these\ndishes, but rarely with staple foods containing rice, wheat\nflour and other grains.\nFollowing this approach, individual daily consumption\nof cooking oils and condiments was estimated from the\nhousehold dietary data. These data, based on the food\ninventory method and partial weighing and measuring of\nthe dishes, are a very accurate measure of total household\nintake of edible oil. The proportion of these household\noils consumed by each individual, based on their\nproportion of the household consumption of vegetable\nand meat foods, was added to the 24-hour dietary recall to\nmeasure individual nutrient intakes.\nFood grouping system\nA variety of ways exist to describe patterns of food\nconsumption. One might describe single foods, food\ngroups or foods by level of processing. One might also\ndescribe food use by the place where foods are purchased\nor consumed (at home vs. away from home), by time of\nday or by specific meal or snack patterns. These\npossibilities led a working group of University of North\nCarolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) and Chinese Institute of\nNutrition and Food Safety (INFS) researchers to develop a\nfood grouping system that summarises intakes of foods in\na nutritionally meaningful way. The complexity of eating\nbehaviour has led most researchers to use simple food\ngrouping systems such as those measuring intakes of 8\u00ad10\nfood groups such as starchy staples (cereal-based foods),\nmeats, dairy products, and so forth. We feel that this\napproach aggregates foods into too few food groups to\npick up important shifts in eating behaviour and misses\nTable 1 Distribution of pork per 100 g of a stir-fried fresh pepper and pork (zhu rou chao qing jiao) recipe (1997 China Health and\nNutrition Survey)\nGroup\nAmount\nper meal per capita\n(g)\ndish Fatty pork Normal pork Lean pork Total\nDietary methodology for transitional countries 949\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

For instance, many studies have examined overall\ndairy or milk consumption whereas the health effects of\nconsuming higher- and lower-fat milks, or butter and\nmargarine, are quite different.\nThe food grouping system that we have used separates\nall foods into 39 descriptive and nutrient-based groups.\nInitially major food groups were based on food\ngroupings used by the INFS. Then fat and b-carotene\ncompositions were used to develop more refined food\ngroupings, and nutrient thresholds were used to separate\nmajor food groups into more distinct, nutrient-based\nfood groups.\nResults\nRecipes\nThere was a large number of recipes consumed, most of\nwhich are not found in any Chinese restaurant. Rather the\ncommon dishes are stir-fried dishes such as zhu rou chao\nqing jiao containing fresh pepper and pork and xi hong\nshi chao ji dan containing tomato and eggs.\nIt would be possible to replace ingredients with recipes\nif there were minimal nutritionally important differences in\nthe composition of recipes between persons from various\ngeographic entities (urban vs. rural, between provinces)\nand socio-economic groupings (e.g. income levels). As we\nshow this is not the case. The most interesting difference is\nseen by examining Table 1. We selected one of the most\ncommon recipes, a stir-fried pork and pepper dish, used\nby our sample households. Each adult consumed about\n110 g of this dish, half of which was pork. The fatty pork\nfound in less than 2% of the recipes contains over 90% fat\nand has an energy density double that of normal pork\nand over five times that of lean pork. The normal pork,\nused in 77% of the recipes, is very high in fat and energy\ndensity also. Not only are there large variations in the\ndistribution of pork in this dish, but, as the first two rows\nshow, the amount of pork varies between urban and\nrural areas.\nAs shown in Table 2, stir-fried tomato and eggs, another\ncommon recipe, also varies widely in consumption with\nrural adults consuming much more than those in urban\nareas. There are differences of about 10% in the\nproportion of eggs in this dish.\nThe energy density of these dishes and the total fat\nthey contributed to the diet varied considerably\nbetween each province and between urban and rural\nareas in all provinces (unreported results). For instance,\nin one province (Hubei), urban residents consumed an\naverage of 46 g of pork and rural residents consumed\nan average of 59 g of pork (n \u00bc 311 persons) in the\ndish zhu rou chao qing jiao. In another higher\nconsumption province (Guizhou), among 693 persons,\nan average of 61 g of pork was consumed per 100 g of\nthe dish in urban areas and 65 g of pork among the\nrural residents.\nA second methodological issue related to use of a recipe\nrelates to AFH consumption. For this component of the\ndiet, the absence of a recipe file may be deleterious.\nWithout a recipe file, consumers are asked to remember\nthe food content of these dishes prepared and cooked by\nothers. There is potential for systematic error if people\nunderestimate components of AFH food.\nLittle research has been undertaken on the proportions\nof food consumed away from home in China. Even in\n1997, AFH food intake in China represents a low\nproportion of total energy intake (Table 3). Yet, as these\nresults show, AFH food consumption is associated with\nincome and urban residency. China is urbanising rapidly\nand also continues to experience a very rapid growth in\nincome per capita. Thus, we would expect AFH intake to\ngrow as a proportion of overall consumption. What is\nremarkable is that in 1989 there was virtually no\nTable 2 Distribution of eggs per 100 g of a stir-fried tomato and\neggs (xi hong shi chao jin dan) recipe (1997 China Health and\nNutrition Survey)\nAmount\nper meal per\ncapita (g)*\nGrams of egg per\n* Mean ^ standard deviation.\nUrban Rural\nLow income\ntertile\nMiddle income\ntertile\nHigh income\ntertile Total\n* Food consumed is separated into three parts: at home, restaurant or food stall, and other (relative's or friend's house, festival/celebration, others).\nBM Popkin et al.\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

This is still a very small figure compared with studies\nwe did in the Philippines and elsewhere in Asia (e.g.\nBisgrove and Popkin5).\nAssessment of oil allocation\nAs noted above, the CHNS measures oil consumed\nseparately for each household. Table 4 illustrates the mean\nof daily intakes of selected nutrients by the traditional\n24-hour recall and the modified 24-hour recall method\nused by the CHNS. The mean intake was separated into\nhouseholds with and without guests plus AFH intake. The\nmost relevant group is the no guest and no AFH group. In\nthis group, the mean intake of fat was 55.5 g for the\nmodified method and 27.0 g for the traditional 24-hour\ndietary recall method, respectively. This is a very large\ndifference and is reflected in large differences in the\nenergy and percentage of calories from fat measures. It is\nimportant to note that the adjustment methods change the\nprotein measure only slightly and have their major effects\non fat intake as we show elsewhere6.\nThe dietary transition in China\nUsing the UNC-CH\u00adINFS food grouping system, we\nadults aged 20\u00ad45 years in a number of components of\ntheir diet.\nIn Table 5, we present data on food diversity. We\ncounted the number of food groups consumed by each\nperson and present mean intake and the proportion with\nhigh, medium and low numbers of food groups\nconsumed. There is a marked increase in diversity of the\nChinese diet across all groupings of socio-economic status.\nThe urban increase is particularly noticeable. Over time,\nthe proportion of Chinese of all income groups who\nconsume less than eight food groups has declined while\nthose who consume more than 10 food groups has\nincreased considerably.\nThe shift in foods consumed is considerable. We\nhighlight a few points in Table 6. One is the reduction in\ngrain intake and its replacement by other foods. This\nincludes large reductions in coarse grain intake in rural\nareas (these same declines occurred earlier in urban areas)\nand declines in refined grain intake. A second is the\nreduction in vegetable intake in rural areas with no change\nin urban vegetable intake. Related are increases in edible\noils, meat and meat products, and eggs.\nThe effect of these shifts towards a more diverse diet,\nand one with a marked shift away from traditional low-\nenergy-density high-fibre foods toward more meat, oil and\nother higher-energy-density foods, is linked with two\nimportant nutritional effects. One is greater overall\nnutrient density as is shown in Table 7. The overall\nincrease in energy density of the Chinese diet is from 2.20\nto 2.42 kcal g21. This is a considerable increase as reviews\non the subject note7,8.\nThesecondeffectisa markedreductionintheproportion\nof Chinese people with low-fat diets and much greater\nconsumption of a higher-fat diet. In fact, Table 8 shows that\nless than 4% of the Chinese adults in the CHNS sample\n1989. The higher-fat diet is nowconsumed byover a third of\nresiding in urban areas. The new Chinese FCT do not have\nsaturated fat measures for all foods so we present fat from\nanimal sources as a crude proxy. This shows the large\nincrease in animal fat intake, particularly in urban areas.\nTable 4 Comparison of the standard 24-hour recall and the modi-\nfied method for Chinese persons aged 1 year and older used by\nthe China Health and Nutrition Survey, 1991*\nEnergy\n(kcal)\nProtein\n(g)\nFat\n(g)\nkcal from fat\n(%)\n* Source: Zhai et al.6.\n All means are statistically significant \u00f0P # 0:01\u00de:\n A family is termed away from home (AFH) only if, during any meal over a\n3-day span, one or more food items for any family member were eaten\naway from home.\n\u00a7 The modified recall is the traditional 3 days of individual dietary recall\ndata plus the oil and condiments consumption measured with the house-\nhold inventory.\nFood groups consumed*\nUrban Rural\nLow income\ntertile\nMiddle\nincome\ntertile\nHigh income\ntertile Total\n* Using the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\u00adInstitute of Nutrition and Food Safety (UNC-CH\u00adINFS) food groups that contain 39 food groups\nbased first on the major food groupings and then on nutrient-based subgroups.\nDietary methodology for transitional countries 951\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

We just note each of these here.\nThey include the following.\n. A rapid increase in the proportion of sweeteners and\nvegetable oil as key markers of urbanisation among\nlower-income countries. There is no research on the\ncomposition of edible oils as they might affect national\nhealth, but there are some data to indicate that red palm\noil might be more healthy whereas edible oil with high\ntrans-fatty acid content would be more unhealthy. For\ninstance, one study has found trans-fatty acid levels of\nabout 50% in dalda, a vegetable ghee widely consumed\nin India (Willett, personal communication).\n. A shift in food sources of energy across most developing\ncountries that is comparable to China, but that has\nusually changed at a much lower pace. Edible vegetable\noil intake predominates as a marker of dietary change in\nAsia and Africa.\n. There are many variants in the types of staples that are\nconsumed at each stage of the transition, as well as in\nthe relative position of meat and meat products, poultry,\nfish and seafood, and dairy and dairy products at each\nstage of dietary change between countries as well as\nwithin countries. For instance, India is a high dairy\nconsuming country. This is important since eggs and\ndairy products are such an important source of saturated\nfats in the diet. Indian consumption of ghee, a\nparticularly high saturated fat product, is important in\nthat a high consumption of saturated fat is closely\nrelated to chronic diseases.\nDiscussion\nUnique features of transitional economies require special\nmethods to capture accurately dietary change. China is\nused as an example. The traditional eating pattern in China\ninvolves the preparation and serving from a common plate\nof a limited number of complex dishes. These dishes\nconsist of main dishes of mainly staples together with side\ndishes of meat and vegetables, placed in the centre of the\ntable in big bowls or plates for all people to share. This\npattern of household consumption from common plates\nincreases the difficulty of obtaining an accurate measure-\nment of individual food consumption. This mode of eating\nhas hindered the development of individual dietary intake\ndata collection methods in China, as they were felt to\nreduce the validity and precision of the individual 24-hour\nrecall method.\nOne of the more important factors differentiating classes\nas well as transitional countries is edible oil intake. The\ncollection of household use of edible oil, and the\ndevelopment of a method specific to each country to\nallocate this oil to each individual in the family, appears\nto be important as a means of improving the quality of\n24-hour recall data. The large differences found between\nthe 24-hour and household inventory methods when the\nadjustment for cooking oil was removed demonstrate this\nclearly. The large variation in recipe composition was\ndemonstrated for China and it is clear that recipe methods\nneed to be used in limited ways. It is also clear that edible\noil intake is so responsive to income and prices, and varies\nso greatly, that it must be measured separately.\nNutrition Surveys)\nUrban Rural\nLow income\ntertile\nMiddle\nincome\ntertile\nHigh income\ntertile Total\n* The total grains category includes raw and cooked rice, wheat flour and products, fried wheat/rice products, corn flour, coarse grain (millet, sorghum, corn)\nand products, starch, starch noodles and products.\nTable 7 Shift in dietary energy density (kcal g21) for Chinese\nUrban Rural\nLow income\ntertile\nMiddle\nincome\ntertile\nHigh income\ntertile Total\nBM Popkin et al.\nDownloaded from http:/www.cambridge.org/core.

A recipe file must be developed to capture this\ncomponent of the diet. At this time such recipe files, if they\nexist, are not based on samples of such dishes from many\nfood stalls and restaurants.\nSome of the methods used to study dietary change in\nChina appear to represent methodological issues that are\nrelevant to all developing countries, or most certainly\nthose in Asia and Africa. One is the measurement of\nhousehold intake of edible oil and the development of a\nway to allocate this among household members. Other\nmethods, such as dealing with consumption from a\ncommon plate and the need to link individual recall and\nhousehold measurement to ensure accurate measures, are\nimportant for many countries but not all.\nA third method, the collection of recipe ingredients at\nthe household level, may be required quite generally.\nHowever, little research on the composition of complex\ndishes exists so we cannot generalise from our findings.\nA fourth issue, the increase in AFH consumption in\nrestaurants and food stalls, may be much more important\nin other countries. In one large study of urban Filipino\nwomen, it was found that about 25% of their energy intake\nand about 45% of their fat intake come from AFH\nconsumption5. There is extensive anecdotal evidence on\nthe importance of AFH intake, but few rigorous large-scale\nanalyses9.\nThe changes in diet are so rapid in transitional\neconomies as presented here for China, and elsewhere\nfor Brazil, South Korea and other countries, that greater\nattention must be paid to methodological issues such as\nReferences\n1 Popkin BM.
