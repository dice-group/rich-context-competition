The\nNational Center for Health Statistics Multiple Cause of Death databases for 1989\u00ad1996 were analyzed for\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes for gastroenteritis due to infectious agents and\ncodes describing illness with other enteric pathogens. The highest rates of death related to enteric diseases were\nseen among people older than 75 years, followed by children under 1 year of age. Rates increased markedly over\ntime in the 65- to 74-year age group for bacterial enteric pathogens and in the 35- to 44-year age group for viral\nenteric pathogens. Enteric diseases were the underlying cause of death for an average of 2,740 deaths during\neach year of this study, and the rate of death due to enteric-related disease is increasing.\ngastroenteritis; intestinal diseases; mortality\nAbbreviations: AIDS, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; CI, confidence interval; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; ICD-\n9, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision; MCD, multiple cause of death; RR, relative risk.\nEnteric diseases continue to contribute to the overall\nburden of human disease. In vulnerable populations such as\nyoung children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised,\nenteric diseases are especially prevalent and more often result\nin serious outcomes. It has been estimated that the cost of\nacute intestinal infections in the United States, including\nmedical costs and lost productivity, exceeds $20 billion annu-\nally (1, 2). A recent report from the FoodNet surveillance\nsystem estimated that there are 76 million cases of foodborne\ndisease each year in the United States (3). Many foodborne\npathogens are enteric in origin, but these infections represent\na fraction of all enteric infections, which may also occur\nthrough waterborne or person-to-person transmission.\nDuring the 20th century, rates of death due to enteric\ndiseases plummeted, largely because of disinfection of\ndrinking water. In 1900, 8.3 percent of all deaths were due to\nthe broad cause of gastritis (including diarrhea, enteritis, and\ncolitis), but by 1990 all infectious diseases (respiratory as\nwell as gastrointestinal) accounted for only 1.8 percent of\ndue to typhoid and paratyphoid fever (5) (International Clas-\nsification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), code group\nhad been reduced more than threefold to only 7.6 deaths per\n100,000 population, partly because of disinfection and filtra-\ntion of community water supplies. Deaths from typhoid and\ntion in 1953 and have remained at that level since then (5).\nDuring that same time span, deaths due to gastritis, duoden-\nitis, enteritis, and colitis dropped from a high of 142.7 per\nThus, the impact of enteric diseases on mortality has been\ngreatly reduced over the last century. However, the propor-\ntion of Americans who are at high risk for severe enteric\ndisease because of low immunity or advanced age is\nincreasing each year.\nUsing national mortality data, we made a quantitative esti-\nmate of the numbers of endemic and epidemic deaths related\nto microbial-enteric disease in the United States from 1989\nto 1996.

Each\nrecord includes information from the decedent's death certif-\nicate about the underlying cause of death, multiple condi-\ntions that contributed to the death, and the place and date of\ndeath, as well as demographic data on the decedent. Each\nrecord may contain up to 20 causes of death that were coded\ndeath in the United States was included within these data\nsets. Deaths that occurred outside of the 50 states, such as\nthose in Guam, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, were\nexcluded from this analysis.\nTwo sets of codes on conditions considered contributing\ncauses of death are included for each data record in the MCD\nfiles. The original death certificate coding is preserved in the\nentity-axis codes, while the record-axis codes have been\nedited by the National Center for Health Statistics to elimi-\nnate contradictions and to define the condition most\nprecisely within the limitations of ICD-9 coding and the\navailable medical information on the death certificate (6).\nRecord-axis codes are used by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics for the published MCD statistics. The\nordering of codes within each record is not the same as it\nappeared on the death certificate, and this should not be\nconsidered relevant information. Record-axis codes repre-\nsent the most meaningful codes for the reported condition,\nbut some detail has been removed from the entity code for\nthat record. ICD-9 category titles apply directly to record-\naxis codes. For example, a decedent with entity codes ICD-9\n571.5 (cirrhosis of the liver without mention of alcohol) and\nICD-9 303 (alcohol dependence syndrome) would have\nthose codes replaced in the record-axis data by ICD-9 571.2\n(alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver) (6). This analysis used the\nrecord-axis codes from the MCD files.\nPoisson regression was used to estimate relative risks for\npossible predictors of enteric disease, including age group,\nsex, race, and US Census region.\nAnalysis\nThe MCD data were categorized by decedent age, race,\nand US Census region and then analyzed for reports of\nenteric disease. Four broad ICD-9 code categories based on\nthe etiologic agents responsible for disease were used in the\nanalysis. \"Bacterial deaths\" include decedents whose death\ndeath certificates mentioned certain ICD-9 codes in the 8.6,\nzoal deaths\" include decedents whose death certificates\ngroups; and \"other microbial deaths\" include decedents\nwhose death certificates mentioned certain ICD-9 codes in\ndisease deaths\" includes the sum of the bacterial, viral,\nprotozoal, and other microbial categories.\nEach record was examined for the presence of any of the\ndesignated ICD-9 codes in any position (from the underlying\ncause of death through the 20th contributing cause of death)\nwithin the record. An indicator variable was indexed for each\ntype of microbe for each diagnosed disease. These cases\nwere then summed within the microbial categories to create\nnational estimates of the number of bacterial, viral, proto-\nzoal, and other microbial diseases that contributed to deaths.\nEach enteric diagnosis was counted separately, so that the\nnumber of diseases could be estimated. For example, if an\nindividual died with an intestinal Campylobacter infection\nhepatitis A (ICD-9 code 70.1), the individual would be\ncounted under each of the three enteric diseases rather than\nas just one decedent with multiple diseases.\nThe MCD data do not include population figures, so the\nCensus Bureau's Population Estimates Program (14) was\nused to obtain population denominators for calculation of\nregion-, age-, and race/ethnicity-specific rates. For these\nanalyses, the \"White\" ethnicity category includes non-\nHispanic Whites and the \"Black\" category includes non-\nHispanic Blacks. The \"Other\" category includes Hispanics\nand all other reported racial and ethnic designations,\nincluding but not limited to Native Americans, Aleuts,\nInuits, Pacific Islanders, and Asians.\nAge- and race-specific rates of death related to enteric\ndisease were calculated by summing the diseases in each\ncategory and then dividing by the corresponding population\ntotal. For example, the number of reported bacterial enteric\ndiseases contributing to the deaths of Black children under 5\nyears of age in 1996 was calculated from the MCD database\n(number of deaths = 10). This value was then divided by the\nestimated number of Black children under age 5 years in the\nUnited States in 1996 from the US Census data (population =\npopulation. Thus, the specific death rate for Black children\nFor each death, the underlying cause and up to 20 contrib-\nuting causes were analyzed. During the years studied, no\ndecedents had more than 15 causes of death included in their\nrecord. The majority of decedents with an enteric disease had\neither one or two enteric diseases listed as causes of death,\nand no decedents had more than four enteric diseases listed\nas causes of death during the study years (table 1).\nRESULTS\na steady increase in the rate of reported deaths associated\nwith enteric viral diseases (figure 1). During the same\nperiod, reports of bacterial and other microbial enteric\n60 Peterson and Calderon\ndiseases as causes of death approximately doubled (bacte-\nin 1996), while reports of deaths associated with protozoal\ndiseases remained nearly constant at approximately 0.01\u00ad\ndisease as a cause of death increased approximately three-\nfold over the study period, from a minimum of about 1.3 per\nrelated to enteric diseases of any etiology increased each\nyear, with an average percentage increase of 116 percent.\nTABLE 1.

Infants and children under 5 years of age\nexperienced rates similar to those of people aged 25\u00ad45\nyears and higher than those of people aged 5\u00ad24 years.\nReported rates of bacterial disease death for the older age\ncategories were higher each year than in the preceding year.\nViral enteric disease was also more frequently reported as a\ncause of death in the oldest age categories, but the increase in\nreports of viral enteric disease as a cause of death started at a\nyounger age level than that for reported deaths associated\nwith bacterial disease (figure 2). The rates of reported death\nassociated with viral disease began to increase with the 35-\nto 44-year age group, while bacterial disease death reports\nbegan to increase with the 55- to 64-year age group. In the\nmost recent years, the rise in the number of reported deaths\nassociated with viral enteric diseases was most rapid among\nexperienced a smaller increase, and the rates of viral enteric\ndisease for people younger than age 34 years at death were\nnearly constant (figure 3).\nAge- and race/ethnicity-specific rates\nIn general, enteric infections were reported more\nfrequently as a cause of death for Blacks than for persons of\nother racial/ethnic categories (figure 4). The disparity among\ndeath rates in the under-5 age category was due to Black\nchildren and infants dying with other microbial infections at\na rate nearly four times that of children in other racial/ethnic\ncategories (annual average rate of reporting: Black = 5.8 per\ngory, the racial/ethnic differences in rate are driven by the\nrates of bacterial infection: Black elderly suffer from enteric\nbacterial infections more than three times as often as White\ndecedents and five times as often as Other decedents (annual\naverage rate of reporting of bacterial enteric infection as a\nEtiologic trends\nA frequency analysis of the ICD-9 codes listed for each\ndeath in each microbial category indicated that the increased\nrates were due to increased rates of reporting within certain\ncode groups rather than to an increase in reports of all enteric\ndiseases. For the bacterial pathogens, the increase in reports\nwas driven by an increase in the 008 codes (intestinal infec-\ntion due to other organisms), along with a slight increase in\nthe 041 codes (bacterial infection in conditions classified\nelsewhere). The most commonly reported subcategory\nwithin the bacterial disease diagnoses was the 008.4 code,\nwhich includes Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Campylo-\nbacter, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Clostridium difficile, as\nwell as other anaerobes and Gram-negative bacteria. Within\nthe viral category, the increase was due almost completely to\na rise in reports of the 070 code (viral hepatitis).\nFIGURE 2.

The National Vital Statistics Report for 1997\nlisted 5,086 deaths due to shigellosis, amebiasis, other intes-\nTABLE 2.

The\ndifference in the rate of increase for viral as opposed to bacte-\nrial pathogens supports the hypothesis of changing diagnostic\ntechniques that allow for more detection of viral infections.\nAn analysis of the number of causes of death coded for each\nrecord during the years under study indicated that the mean\nnumber of causes of death coded was 3.11 per decedent, with\na variance between years of 0.0008. This indicates that the\nnumber of codes recorded for each decedent was nearly\nconstant over time, and the increased number of reports of\nenteric disease related to death was not due to a change in the\nusual number of causes of death coded for each decedent.\nAnalysis of the underlying cause of death separate from all\ncontributing causes combined revealed that the rate of viral\nenteric diseases' being reported as the underlying cause of\ndeath more than doubled during the study period (from 0.48\nenteric disease as the underlying cause of death is also\nincreasing and is being driven by the increased reports of\nviral enteric deaths. Rates of reporting of bacterial and other\nmicrobial enteric infections as the underlying cause of death\napproximately doubled over the study period (bacterial\nrial and other enteric microbial deaths represent a small frac-\ntion of the deaths related to viral enteric infections.\nDetermining the true cause behind observed differences in\nenteric disease burden within population groups or for\nspecific pathogens is beyond the scope of this analysis.\nEnteric disease burden in children\nGenerally, children have high rates of viral infection\nbecause they have not yet acquired immunity to viral patho-\ngens. The low reporting rates for viral disease associated\nwith children's deaths, however, suggest that while children\nmay experience higher rates of enteric viral infection, these\ninfections are rarely so serious as to cause or contribute to\ndeath. We estimated that enteric diseases are reported as a\ncontributing cause of death for 456 children under age 5 each\nyear. A review of studies of the impact of diarrhea on child-\nrhea each year (16). Since different International Classifica-\ntion of Diseases codes were used, our death estimates cannot\nbe directly compared with those of other studies, but our esti-\nmates were similar in magnitude to those of the previous\nreview.\nBlack children under 5 years of age have enteric infections\nlisted as a cause of death more than four times as often as\nchildren of other races in the same age group. This suggests\nthat factors other than pathogen virulence are responsible for\nthe greater risk of mortality associated with these infections\nin some children. Black decedents less than 5 years old had\nICD-9 codes for disorders relating to short gestation and low\ntheir death certificates twice as often as decedents from the\nWhite and Other racial categories (Black, 19.5 percent;\nWhite, 8.8 percent; Other, 10.9 percent). Other factors and\nexposures not captured on the death certificate may also\ncontribute to increased risk of death from enteric disease.\nEnteric disease in the immunocompromised\nThe immune status of persons infected with HIV makes\nthem more susceptible to enteric infections and more likely\nto be suffering from a serious enteric infection at the time of\ntheir death. The most interesting trend possibly affecting this\nsubpopulation is the increasing rate of reported viral enteric\ndisease associated with death among people aged 25\u00ad45\nyears (figure 2). The rate was fairly linear in 1989, but by\n1996 there was a distinct rise in the rates of reported viral\nenteric disease associated with death. It is possible that this\nis a direct result of the acquired immunodeficiency\nsyndrome (AIDS) epidemic in those age groups. Peak\nmortality associated with AIDS occurs among persons aged\nThe rates of reported death associated with protozoal\nenteric diseases increased similarly in both Blacks and\nWhites, centered at the 35- to 44-year age group. This\nfinding agrees with current prevalence figures for HIV and\nAIDS indicating that the age category with both the highest\nincidence of AIDS and the highest mortality from AIDS is\nincrease in the rate of reported other enteric microbial infec-\ntions associated with death is slightly evident among Blacks.\nThis increase may also be due to HIV infection, because the\nprevalence of HIV infection is higher among minority Amer-\nicans than in the White population (17).\nImpact of enteric disease\nfrom one year to the next in the fraction of deaths related to\nAmericans live with compromised immune systems, the\nfraction of deaths related to enteric disease will continue to\nincrease.\nEnteric Disease as a Cause of Death 65\nDeaths related to bacterial enteric disease in the elderly, a\nquickly growing segment of the US population, are\nincreasing at a greater rate than in any other age category.\nThis also suggests that enteric disease will be a continuing\nand expanding burden on the health care system unless better\nprevention and control measures are found and imple-\nmented. The fact that hepatitis A, a vaccine-preventable\ndisease, is contributing to the deaths of more people each\nyear should not go unnoticed. Vaccination against hepatitis\nA may be one public health intervention strategy for\nreducing preventable deaths.\nAnother factor affecting the number of deaths related to\nenteric disease each year is the number of Americans living\nwith HIV infection (ICD-9 code 042). Of the deaths related\nto enteric disease in 1989, 3.3 percent also included HIV as\nIn summary, the rate of reporting of enteric diseases as\ncontributing causes of death more than doubled between\nrates of reporting of enteric diseases as causes of death. Viral\nenteric diseases contributed to an increasing number of\ndeaths among people in the 35- to 55-year age groups during\nthe study period, probably because of the impact of HIV and\nAIDS in that population. Nonwhite Americans are most\naffected by enteric diseases as contributing causes of death.\nWhile enteric disease caused many fewer deaths in the 1990s\nthan in the 1920s, these diseases remain an important and\noften preventable contributor to mortality in the United\nStates.\n"
