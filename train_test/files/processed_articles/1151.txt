Patients and physicians often\ndo not discuss issues around OP costs,\nwhich may be owing to embarrassment or\nfear that the quality of care may be com-\npromised.11-13 However, studies focused on\npatient-physician communication have ex-\namined cost sharing generally rather than\ncomparing its effects on specific types of\nhealth care services (eg, diagnostic test-\ning) and have explored only a limited num-\nber of physician and practice factors in re-\nAuthor Affiliations: Center for\nStudying Health System\nChange, Washington, DC\n(Drs Pham and O'Malley);\nMacLean Center for Clinical\nMedical Ethics and the Division\nof General Internal Medicine,\nUniversity of Chicago\nHospitals, Chicago, Ill\n(Dr Alexander).\n\u00a92007 American Medical Association.

We analyzed data on how frequently physicians\nreported considering their patients' OP costs from co-\npayments and deductibles when prescribing drugs, se-\nlecting diagnostic tests, and choosing care settings. We\nalso assessed the physician and practice characteristics\nassociated with this practice.\nMETHODS\nDATA\nThe Community Tracking Study Physician Survey20 is a peri-\nodic, nationally representative telephone survey of nonfederal\nUS physicians conducted 4 times since 1996. The sample is clus-\ntered in 60 randomly selected metropolitan statistical areas and\nincludes physicians who report spending at least 20 hours in\ndirect patient care per week. Primary care physicians (PCPs)\n(including those engaged in the practice of general internal medi-\ncine, family practice, general practice, general pediatrics, geri-\natrics, and pediatrics/internal medicine) were oversampled, and\nspecialists such as radiologists, anesthesiologists, and patholo-\ngists were excluded. Our analysis focuses on data from the 2004-\nsponse rate of 53%. Other details about the survey and its design\nhave been previously published.20\nMEASURES\nOur outcome measures came from 3 questions of the form \"How\noften do you consider an insured patient's out-of-pocket costs\nfor copayments and deductibles\" in (1) \"prescribing a generic\nover a brand-name drug if a generic option is available?\" (2)\n\"deciding the types of tests to recommend if there is uncer-\ntainty about a diagnosis?\" and (3) \"choosing between inpa-\ntient and outpatient care settings, when there is a choice?\" Phy-\nsicians responded \"always,\" \"usually,\" \"sometimes,\" \"rarely,\"\nor \"never.\" We dichotomized responses as always/usually vs all\nother responses.\nWe selected these types of decisions because physicians face\ndifferent levels of discretion for each. That is, generic drugs are\nnearly always equivalent to brand-name drugs in efficacy, while\ndifferent diagnostic tests or care settings may entail considerable\ntrade-offs in safety, convenience, or other factors. For example,\na physician trying to determine if a patient's chest pain is cardiac\nin nature may order a simple treadmill stress test; a stress test with\nan echocardiogram to visualize pump function; or a higher-risk\nbut more definitive cardiac catheterization. Similarly, a patient\nwithcommunity-acquiredpneumoniamaybeappropriatelytreated\nas an outpatient or admitted to a hospital, depending on the pres-\nence of comorbidities, severity of the infection, and presence of\nfamily or other support in the home.\nWe limited our inquiry to insured patients to isolate the ef-\nfects of cost-sharing arrangements as distinct from those of po-\ntentially much larger OP expenses that uninsured patients con-\nfront. The 3 questions underwent cognitive testing with a focus\ngroup of physicians prior to survey fielding and were rotated\nduring survey administration.\nOur main independent variables of interest were self-\nreported physician and practice characteristics. Physicians' char-\nacteristicsincludedyearsinpractice;specialty(PCPs,medicalspe-\ncialists,andsurgeons);medicalschoolsite(UnitedStates,Canada,\nor Puerto Rico, [hereinafter called \"United States\"] vs else-\nwhere); board certification; sex; race or ethnicity (non-Hispanic\nwhite, Hispanic, and all other); whether their compensation was\ndependentonmeasuresofproductivityorpatientsatisfaction(yes\nor no for each); what they perceived the overall effect of their fi-\nnancial incentives to be (expand services at all vs reduce services\nat all or no effect); and whether they agreed that they had ad-\nequate time to spend with patients during office visits (agree\nstrongly or somewhat vs all other responses).\nFor the question on drug prescribing, we also included the\nreported proportion of the physicians' patients covered by drug\nFor the question on selecting diagnostic tests, we included phy-\nsicians' reported ability to access referrals for high-quality di-\nagnostic imaging and specialty care. And for the question on\nselecting care settings, we considered physicians' reported abil-\nity to access elective hospital admissions for their patients (all\ncategorized as yes or no). Practice characteristics included type\n(solo or 2-person group; groups 3; staff or group model health\nmaintenance organization [HMO]; hospital and/or university;\nor other); percentage of revenues derived from Medicare and\nmanaged care (each categorized by terciles); the number of man-\naged care contracts; and whether the practice had information\ntechnology to access treatment guidelines. For the question on\ndrug prescribing, we also assessed whether physicians had ac-\ncess to information technology in their practice to write elec-\ntronic prescriptions.\nWe examined several other variables as proxy measures of the\nsocioeconomic status of physicians' patient panels: the number\nof hours physicians reported providing charity care in the previ-\npractice revenue derived from Medicaid (terciles); the median\nhousehold income in the physician's practice ZIP code (quin-\ntiles); and the proportion of adults 25 years or older in that county\nwho received 12 or more years of education (terciles).\nWe report herein the adjusted proportions of physicians who\nreported having considered patients' OP costs by their indi-\nvidual and practice characteristics. Adjustments were made using\nseparate multivariate logistic regressions for each of the 3 out-\ncome measures and included physician and practice charac-\nteristics that were significant in bivariate analyses. We also ad-\njusted for the reported proportion of each physician's patients\nwith a chronic condition as a measure of the illness burden\namong his or her patients.\n\u00a92007 American Medical Association.

How well this works depends in part on phy-\nsicians' sensitivity to their patients' OP costs, because phy-\nsicians are responsible for decisions that affect how 90%\nof each health care dollar is spent.5 We found that while\nmost physicians reported routinely considering patients'\nOP costs in clinically straightforward prescribing deci-\nsions, only half or fewer do so in more complex situations\nthat allow greater clinical discretion.\nafteremployersandinsurersembarkedonthecurrenttrend\nof \"benefits buy-down\" through expanding consumer co-\npayments and deductibles.1,3 We found that, despite the at-\ntendant increases in cost-sharing burdens over that time\nperiod, most physicians did not take them into account\nwhen making common care recommendations surround-\ning diagnostic testing and choosing care settings.\nTo our knowledge, prior studies have not compared\nphysicians' sensitivity to patients' OP costs for different\nservices. The variation across different types of clinical\ndecisions that we document is not unexpected. The wider\nclinicallatitudeinvolvedinmorecomplexdecisionsmeans\nthat physicians may prioritize other considerations, such\nas accuracy of a test or ease of scheduling, above pa-\ntients' OP costs as they approach these types of choices.\nAnd physicians and patients are less likely to have ready\naccess to detailed cost data for diagnostic tests or care\nsettings than for prescription drugs.\nNevertheless, that physicians report considering pa-\ntients' OP costs less frequently in making decisions about\nmore expensive services suggests that cost-sharing ar-\nrangements dependent on patients and physicians weigh-\ning such costs can have only limited effect on use of such\nservices and, by extension, less impact on overall health\ncare spending than payers might hope for.\nWe also found that specialists were modestly more re-\nsistant to OP costs than primary care physicians. This find-\ning was consistent across all 3 types of care decisions and\nmaybeduetoanumberoffactors.First,PCPsmaybemore\nsensitivethanspecialiststopatients'economicburdens,per-\nhaps because of more continuous care relationships and\nknowledge of patients' social circumstances that would fa-\ncilitate discussing sensitive topics.21,22 Second, some spe-\ncialist physicians are more likely to perform many types\nof diagnostic procedures including through self-referrals,\nwhich may create perverse disincentives for them to con-\nsider patients' cost burdens in selecting individual tests, al-\nthough we did not find specific evidence that physicians'\nfinancial incentives affect consideration of patients' OP\ncosts.23,24 Third, it is possible that specialists may perceive\nless discretion in decision making if they responded to the\nsurvey thinking in particular of patients within the pur-\nview of their individual specialties who may have more se-\nvere illness than similar patients treated by PCPs.25 Re-\ngardless of the mechanisms, these specialty differences\ncompound concerns that cost sharing will have limited ef-\nfects on the use of more expensive medical services.\nOutside of comparisons of academic medical centers vs\ncommunity-based practices, few studies have examined\npractice type differences in decisions regarding specific ser-\nvices.12 We found that physicians in closed-model HMOs\nare most likely to consider OP costs in drug prescribing\nwhile those in solo or 2-person practices are most likely to\ndo so in recommending diagnostic tests and care settings.\nOne potential explanationmay be thatphysicians inHMOs\nare more likely than those in other practice settings to have\nready access to information on copayments for formulary\nvs nonformulary drugs to which they can refer during pa-\ntient encounters.26 In contrast, similar decision aids for\nchoosing diagnostic tests or care settings are unlikely to\nbe as available or straightforward to use, given the greater\nclinical latitude involved in these types of decisions. In this\ncontext, the strength of individual patient-physician rela-\ntionships that support communication about sensitive eco-\nnomic issues may become more important determinants\nof whether physicians consider cost burdens. Although in\nprior research both patients and physicians report that in-\nadequate time is a barrier preventing greater communica-\ntion about OP costs,12 in the present study we did not find\nan association between physician's reports of having ad-\nequate time to spend with patients and physicians' rou-\ntinely considering OP costs.\nOur finding that physicians who reported worse ac-\ncess to high-quality imaging services and elective hos-\npital admissions were more likely to consider OP costs\nin selecting tests and care settings is intuitive. It sug-\ngests that cost-sharing arrangements will have their great-\nest effects where the supply of the relevant services is al-\nready constricted, providing further motivation for\nphysicians to weigh their costs against their benefits and\nthe time patients would spend waiting to access them.\nThe tendency toward greater consideration of OP costs\namong physicians treating patients with lower socioeco-\nnomic status is also expected. Lower-income insured\nAmericans are more likely than the wealthier insured to\nhave high OP health care spending burdens relative to\ntheir family incomes.3 Physicians may either intuit this\nor make assumptions about the relationship between pa-\ntients' cost burdens and their socioeconomic status. But\nas more patients face cost-sharing arrangements, such pre-\nconceived notions of which patients are most vulner-\nable could grow less reliable.\nOur results should be viewed in light of several limi-\ntations. We examined only 3 types of clinical decisions.\nPhysicians may consider OP costs more or less fre-\nquently in other clinical situations, especially those in-\nvolving even higher-cost or higher-risk services such as\nsurgical procedures. Social desirability bias in a tele-\nphone survey may also result in underestimation or over-\nestimation of physicians' likelihood of considering pa-\ntients' cost burdens, although we carefully worded\nquestions on diagnostic testing and care settings to avoid\nimplying a normative response. (We expect physicians\n\u00a92007 American Medical Association.

Similarly, because survey items asked about\nphysicians' overall experience, we cannot address the in-\nfluence of OP cost considerations on decision making in\nindividual care encounters. Further research may clarify\nwhetherphysiciansmaybemoresensitivetocostburdens\nexperiencedbyparticularpatientsubgroupssuchasthose\nexposed to \"doughnut holes\" and varying copayments vs\ndeductibles.19,27 Finally, our results do not address the ef-\nfectsofcostsharingoncaredecisionsthatpatientsmaymake\noutside of their interactions with physicians, for example,\nMore aggressive interventions such as accessible, de-\ntailed, and user-friendly information on costs of specific\nservices might broadly change physicians' clinical deci-\nsion making,29 but only if they result in a significant im-\nprovement in how often and how well patients and phy-\nsicians communicate with one another about cost burdens.\nTo evaluate the impact of such efforts, policymakers will\nneed to track physicians' sensitivity to patients' OP costs\nover time, particularly for costly, discretionary services.\nHow such clinical decisions are made at the point of care\nis critical to the viability of cost-sharing arrangements as\nacost-controltooland,asimportantly,totheoverallhealth\nand economic burden they pose to patients.\nCorrespondence: Hoangmai H.
