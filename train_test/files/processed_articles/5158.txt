PAI-1 blocks the conversion of\nplasminogen to plasmin through covalent\nbinding to plasminogen activator, thereby\ninhibiting activation of matrix metallopro-\nteinases. 3 PAI-1 participates in the process\nof inflammation through modulating cell\nmigration and levels of cytokines, such as\ntumour necrosis factor-a, interleukin-6, and\ninterferon-g in the lung.4,5 Thus, PAI-1 may\nplay an important role in the pathogenesis of\nCOPD through its effect on extracellular\nmatrix deposition and inflammation.\nThe serpin family E member 1\n(SERPINE1) gene, which encodes the PAI-\nq22 and contains nine exons. Several single-\nnucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have\nbeen described in SERPINE1, such as -844\npolymorphisms have been shown to affect\nSERPINE1 expression. The A allele in the -\n844 A/G substitution polymorphism is asso-\nciated with increased PAI-1 mRNA and\nprotein levels.8,9 In terms of the SERPINE1\nism, the 4G allele has been shown to\nupregulate PAI-1 mRNA and protein\n4G genotype have higher plasma PAI-1\nlevels than those with the 4G/5G and 5G/\ngenetic polymorphisms have been found\nassociated with several diseases, such as\nstroke, rheumatoid arthritis, acute coronary\nsyndrome and metabolic syndrome, in dif-\nSeveral studies have investigated the\n5G polymorphism and chronic pulmonary\ndiseases, including asthma and pulmonary\npolymorphism is shown to be associated\nto impact the effect of inhaled glucocorti-\ncosteroid.16 Frequency of the 4G allele is\nsignificantly higher than the 5G allele in\npatients with nonspecific interstitial pneu-\ntype has a significant negative association\nwith the development of idiopathic pulmon-\nary fibrosis.18 Thus, it may be reasonable to\nexpect a relationship between SERPINE1\npolymorphisms and COPD.
