Microevolution (e.g., natural selection and genetic\ndrift) operates in synergistic fashion with macroevolution\n(e.g., evolutionary history and adaptive constraints), as coor-\ndinated by developmental biology responding to an environ-\nment. In general, natural, sexual, frequency-dependent,\nindividual, kin, group, and species selection operate on phe-\nnotypes and drive change in gene frequency across succes-\nsive generations. Mutation, the founder effect, the bottleneck\neffect, drift, and Mendel's fair coin represent opportunities\nfor variation. Random variation creating synonymous base\nsubstitutions, pseudogenes, and neutral amino acids may\nhave no evolutionary effect. Evolution can be very fast when\nselection is directed and strong in a large population with\ngreat diversity, but rapid modifications usually incur costs\nthat destabilize changes. The price of change may induce\nmaladaptation, or even dysfunction in response to environ-\nmental extremes, and this is evident in the evolution of the\nhuman brain.\nEvolution fashioned a balance between the energetics\nFoley, Lee, Widdowson, Knight, & Jonxis, 1991; Herculano-\nhigh cell number for information storage and retrieval (e.g.,\nelephants), complexity for sense data processing and calcula-\ntion (e.g., sonar-dependent bats), or both as in cetaceans and\nprimates (Herculano-Houzel & Kaas, 2011; Snodgrass et al.,\n2009).

For example, the major placental tran-\nscript contributes to increased circulating E2 in pregnant\nwomen by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude (Abramovich & Rowe,\n1973). However, uniting large transcripts prior to translation\npermits many opportunities for transcript-level regulation\nand dysfunction, especially at the common splice site.\nCirculating serum estradiol demonstrates wide ranging\neffects throughout the body and directly regulates the\ninflammatory response in all tissues (Bastarache et al.,\nautoimmunity in males (Becker, 2012). The inflammatory\ncascade is a system of feed-forward and feedback loops, and\nmetabolites of these processes directly regulate gene expres-\nsion in cells that reside within entirely different tissues, such\nas the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (Ahlquist et al., 1982;\nWhittle, 1981).

The\ncritical aspect to human brain evolution is phenotypic plas-\nticity; primate brains experience tremendous cell prolifera-\ntion postpartum, selective synaptic pruning in response to an\ninfinitely variable environment, \"hard-wiring\" due to\nmyelination (Figure 2), and CYP19A1 is principal to each of\nthese processes.\nThe aim of the current study is twofold. The first purpose\nwas to explore the evolution of CYP19A1 as evidence\nindicates developmental derailment is not an exclusively\nhuman condition (Bastian, Sponberg, Suomi, & Higley,\nMcGrew, & Preuschoft, 2006; Capitanio, Mendoza, Mason,\nal., 2002; Kalcher-Sommersguter, Preuschoft, Crailsheim, &\nFranz, 2011; Kempes, Gulickx, van Daalen, Louwerse, &\nallows for invention and manipulation of tools, whether\nmaterial or social, rests at the core of primate brain evolution\nDunbar, 1998). Because the human brain does not mature\nunilaterally during ontogeny, nor has it done so through phy-\nlogeny, there may be genetic mechanisms that link selection\nto developmental neurobiology.\nWhile it is true that brain size and complexity correlate to\nphysiological and ecological factors (Allman, McLaughlin,\nauthor suggests that genetic mechanisms supporting the\nsocial brain hypothesis would correlate less as taxonomy\ngoes phylogenetically afield. Such a mechanism must also\naccount for the gender-biased differences in developmental\ncortical volume positively correlates to group size in females\nbut not to males (Lindenfors, 2005). Therefore, this study\nfirst seeks to determine if the CYP19A1 gene (a) demon-\nstrates a strong phylogenetic trend and (b) if its orthologous\nrelationship correlates to previously hypothesized mecha-\nnisms for human brain evolution.\nOrganisms possess genotypes that permit deviations in\ndevelopmental pathways in response to varying environ-\nmental conditions (Scoville & Pfrender, 2010).

A\nNeanderthal CYP19A1 composite is produced from 6\nthe UCSC Genome Browser (Blanchette et al., 2004;\n2009). Because modern Homo sapiens share a more recent\ncommon ancestor with Neanderthal than any nonhuman pri-\nmate, CYP19A1 should demonstrate organization nearly\nidentical to the current human model, particularly if the gene\ndemonstrates an evolutionary trend through the extant pri-\nmate lineage.\nDunbar's (1992) original model (Figure 3) presented\nneocortex ratio (NCR) as an independent variable and group\nsize as the dependent variable, stating that \"the interest lies\nin the consequences of brain size\" (p. 9). This perspective\nneglects environmental circumstances that may induce last-\ning group size change regardless of brain development.\nBecause, unlike Dunbar, this study is concerned with the\ncause of human brain evolution, NCR becomes the\nFigure 3.Dunbar's original assessment of the impact of a large\nneocortical ratio to social group size and complexity.

This study considers\nthat while growing through neurologically sensitive stages\nwithin an ever-dynamic social milieu (Rodseth, Wrangham,\nHarrigan, & Smuts, 1991; Sutcliffe, Dunbar, Binder, &\nArrow, 2012), situated within an environment of limited\noperated on individual variability to propel primate brain\nevolution. Therefore, due to its contribution to plasticity,\nenvironmentally triggered patterns of neuronal remodeling,\nand modulation of gender typical social behavior, CYP19A1\nis a factor.\nWhat has become known as \"Dunbar's equation\" is cor-\nrected with current information regarding orangutan\nSch\u00fcrmann, & Sugardjito, 1990; Utami, Goossens, Bruford,\nde Ruiter, & van Hooff, 2002) and gorilla (Yamagiwa,\nKahekwa, & Basabose, 2003) range and social group disper-\nsion. Dunbar (1992) log-transformed all data due to curvilin-\near relationship between group size and NCR, and performed\nthe regression on reduced major axes as this provides great-\nest estimate of relation when errors are unknown, though this\ncreates an added false visual sense of linearity (Figure 3).\nThose species previously described by Dunbar as existing in\na group size of 1 are here considered as living in a social\ngroup of 2+ as courtship and mating is assumed to be a com-\nplex social interaction (Schillaci, 2008) within local if not\noverlapping environments.\nThe ratio of neocortex volume to whole brain volume is\nthe dependent variable as it accounts for executive function,\nthough it is easy to imagine a small primate evolving a NCR\ngreater than human, yet still in possession of a brain no larger\nthan a walnut. To fashion a more complete model, brain mass\n(Deaner, Isler, Burkart, & van Schaik, 2007; Dunbar &\nShultz, 2007) is included so that neuronal density that varies\nwithin and between brain regions (C. E. Collins, Airey,\nYoung, Leitch, & Kaas, 2010) and the scaling factor (Clark,\nHouzel & Kaas, 2011) become a feature of the model. The\nfemale body cavity delimits the general size of the fetus, and\nthe size of the female pelvis restricts the size of the neonatal\nbrain, so brain volume enables some accounting for general\nbody size and encephalization quotient in primates (Deacon,\nFollowing species-specific data correction, SPSS v 18\nwas used to perform a regression with NCR as the dependent\nvariable. Square root transformed group size and brain mass\ndata (TGR and TBM, respectively) with CYP19A1 genetic\northology are independent variables. Unlike Dunbar (1992),\nthe axes remain intact to prevent added visual impression of\nlinearity. Because visual interpretation of graphic analysis\nsuggested a phylogenetic trend through vertebrate phylog-\neny, with particular development in primates, a CDS FASTA\nalignment (Karolchik et al., 2003) output was produced from\nnine primate species to derive the amino acid sequence align-\nCYP19A1 assembly. Amino acid sequence was chosen over\nnucleic acid because each transcriptome sequenced repre-\nsents an imaginary construct representing each species with\nno easy accounting for substitutions to synonymous codons.\nThe BLAST-like alignment tool (BLAT; Kent, 2002) is used\nto determine orthology.\nIf it is established that CYP19A1 complexity does trend\nwith phylogeny and that it correlates strongly to previously\nhypothesized drivers of human brain evolution, then the\nUCSC Genome Browser (Kent, 2002) is used to align the\nEnsembl, Genscan, RefSeq, and UCSC Gene human genome\ndatabases against data from exon microarray expression in\nthe fetal brain (Johnson et al., 2009), histone mapping\nthrough brain development by gender (Cheung et al., 2010),\nTargetScan miRNA regulatory sites (Friedman, Farh, Burge,\nBartel, 2005), RNA transcription levels (ENCODE Project\nConsortium et al., 2011), brain DNA methylation (Maunakea\nthe presence of simple nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs;\nand regulation from the above data provides evidence rela-\ntive to genetic accommodation specific to (a) brain region,\n(b) by gender, (c) across developmental stages, and (d) with\nbroad genetic variability.\nResults\nPhylogenetically, CYP19A1 does not fully organize until\nplacental vertebrates (Figure 4) and appears to play a reason-\nably comparable role whether bat, elephant, or dolphin, until\nthe rise of Platyrrhini (New World monkeys) and Catarrhini\n(Old World monkeys and apes).

Because many of the techniques described in this\nwork can be performed with formaldehyde-preserved tis-\nsues, it is now feasible to track the evolution of site-specific\nregulatory mechanisms with fine detail across all brain\nregions and throughout the entire chordate phylum.\nThe miRNA data presented (Figure 8) suggest that pri-\nmary expression regulation of P450arom gene in placenta\noccurs at the level of transcription and the tissue-specific\nregion is conserved throughout the mammalian class\n(Helgen, 2011). It is perhaps important to note that the\nsame tissue-specific transcript carries the weight of\nNeanderthal-specific deviation (Figure 4). It is reasonable\nto suggest Neanderthal experienced no difference in\nexpression, due to synonymous substitutions and equiva-\nlent amino acid variations, but this could represent\nmaternal reproductive adaption in response to dietary DHA\navailability. Human CYP19A1 transcription levels are\nhighest in regions dedicated to reproductive tissues and the\nbrain (Figure 8), and these areas show positive selection in\nearly humans (Figure 4).\nIncreased gyral white matter in the human prefrontal cor-\ntex (PFC) suggests selection in primates for risk assessment,\nemotional restraint, attention maintenance, meta-awareness,\nworking memory, imitative learning, goal-directed behavior,\ncommunication (including use of gaze), and decision making\nTottenham, Liston, & Durston, 2005; Caviness, Kennedy,\nRichelme, Rademacher, & Filipek, 1996; Courchesne et al.,\nXi et al., 2011). Though ascribing a \"reason\" for some trait to\nevolve is often problematic, these data seem to correlate with\nFigure 8. Fine regulation of CYP19A1 by gender, across lifetime developmental stages, as detected by histone mapping, miRNA regulation,\ntranscription level, cytosine-guanine (CG) methylation, and known simple nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This degree of regulation\nis necessary because CYP19A1 transforms testosterone into neuroprotective estradiol and coordinates the conversion of omega-3 fatty\nacids into DHA while competitively inhibiting proinflammatory AA. Axonal elongation, myelination, neurite outgrowth, arborization,\nsynaptogenesis, generation of neuroprotectin D1, inhibition of apoptosis, and targeted physiological debridement are thus modulated by\nCYP19A1 with extreme regulation.\n(a) increased DHA production in mammary tissues (Caspi et\nal., 2007; Lammi-Keefe, Rozowski, Parodi, Sobrevia, &\nFoncea, 2008), (b) increased DHA uptake by the placenta\n(c) both of which are required for proportionally thicker\ncortical white matter in the growing human brain (Allman\nFor many decades, the common approach to genetics was\nto study artificially induced and naturally occurring muta-\ntions as a means to understand normal gene expression. This\nauthor asserts that as great phenotypic plasticity is the pri-\nmary character trait selected for, the search for genes linked\nto developmental disorder that also demonstrate phyloge-\nnetic trends in orthology will reveal those genes most critical\nto human brain evolution. This author is currently assessing\ngenes known linked to human brain development and disor-\nder to determine what may be the core genomic set respon-\nsible for human brain evolution (preliminary results provided\nin Table 2). Those genes demonstrating higher orthology fur-\nther from primates specifically, and toward placental mam-\nmal, marsupial, monotreme, reptile, and so on provide\nestimation for when in evolution those genes became most\nselectively advantageous. It is important to point out that the\nFOXP2 and HOX genes did not display strong positive\northologous correlation, suggesting that while these genes\nwere important to the evolution of a central nervous system,\nthey did not play a central role in human brain evolution\nspecifically.\nAuthors' Note\nRaw data for the exon microarray expression may be obtained\nthrough the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus http://www.ncbi.nlm.\nnih.gov/geo. All in silico hybridizations, histone mapping, DNA\nmethylation assessment, and assessment of CYP19A1 SNPs were\nprocessed using the UCSC Genome Browser on Human February\nand RefSeq databases, and ENCODE data.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nTable 2. Preliminary Results Using the Orthology Correlation Technique on 158 Genes.\nDemonstrates positive correlation Little to no positive correlation\nNote: More than two dozen genes listed above were previously considered linked to developmental disorders, including autism, and are labeled with an\nasterisk (*). It is important to understand that pathology purely due to genetics is considered a disease and not a disorder, and while each of those listed\nmay induce a disease with behavioral characters strikingly similar to those diagnostic of autism spectrum disorders, they seldom explain any aspect of the\ngender bias, the influence of environmental stimuli, and never both together.\nReferences\nAbramovich, D., & Rowe, P.
