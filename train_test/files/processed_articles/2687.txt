Inadequate weight gain is associated with low birth weight, preterm birth and fail-\nure to initiate breastfeeding[10]. As a result, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) have called for more effective interventions to\npromote healthy weight gain during pregnancy to address this critical public health issue\nIn the US, less than 40% of women gain within the IOM recommended guidelines, while\nhealthy pregnancy weight gain among young women is particularly important, as the US has\none of the highest rates of adolescent pregnancy among high-income countries and rising\nrates of obesity among women and adolescents[15\u00ad17]. Despite recent declines in teen birth in\nresult, morbidity related to inappropriate weight gain continues to contribute to poor health\namong at-risk young mothers and their children.\nSome interventions designed for adult women have been shown to be effective at maintain-\ning healthy weight gain during pregnancy[19\u00ad22]. However, few interventions have been\ndesigned specifically for pregnant adolescents or young women. Pregnant adolescents and\nyoung women likely have different needs and preferences than pregnant adults, and as a result,\ninterventions for this at-risk group should be tailored to their distinct needs and preferences to\nbe effective. To appropriately tailor interventions, there is a critical need to understand the\ncharacteristics of adolescents and young women who are at greatest risk for inappropriate\nweight gain during pregnancy.\nRisk factors for inappropriate pregnancy weight gain are known among adults and prepreg-\nnancy BMI, age, and race[9,23,24]. However, the effects of sociodemographic factors on inap-\npropriate weight gain among pregnant adolescents and young women is unclear. The aim of\nthis study is to use a large national sample to identify risk factors for inappropriate weight gain\nduring pregnancy specifically among adolescents and young women.\nMaterials and methods\nThe Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study follows a cohort of mother and father dyads\nand their children born in large US cities between 1998 and 2000 (roughly three-quarters of\ndyads are unwed parents). \"Fragile families\" denotes that these families are at greater risk of\nbreaking up and living in poverty than more traditional families[25]. National weights make\nWomen at risk for excess weight gain during pregnancy\nInstitute of Child Health and Human Development\n(NICHD) of the National Institutes of Health under\nfoundations. Additionally, Tammy Chang received\nfunding from the National Institutes of Health -\nhad no role in the design and conduct of the study;\ncollection, management, analysis and\ninterpretation of the data preparation, review, or\napproval of the manuscript, and decision to submit\nthe manuscript for publication.\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nThe study extracted information from medical records about mothers' pregnancy and\ndelivery (including prepregnancy BMI), and the mother's weight gain during pregnancy. Fol-\nlow-up interviews gathered additional information, including access to and use of healthcare\nand childcare services, experiences with local welfare and child support agencies, parental con-\nflict and domestic violence, and child health and well-being. Because this data set provides a\nunique glimpse into the many factors that may affect weight gain during pregnancy, it has the\npotential to be used to create a typology of pregnant adolescents and young women who gain\nappropriate weight versus those who do not.\nThe cohort of interest was pregnant women between the ages of 15 and 24 at time of deliv-\nery to capture adolescents as they transitioned into adulthood[27]. Data was further restricted\nto those who had medical record information available and carried singleton pregnancies to\nterm (37 weeks or later). Mothers were categorized into BMI categories using prepregnancy\nheight and weight information. Prepregnancy BMI among those who were 18 or older were\ngorized using age-specific percentiles from the CDC (<5th percentile = underweight, 5th-85th\npercentile = normal, 85th-95th = overweight, 95th+ = obese, BMI of 40+ = morbidly obese)\n[28,29]. IOM guidelines updated in 2009 for gestational weight gain vary by prepregnancy\nBMI: underweight women should gain between 28 and 40 lbs., normal weight between 25 and\nlbs.[9]. The guidelines have been shown to be appropriate for both adults and adolescents[12].\nThese guidelines were used to categorize each mother's weight gain as less than recommended,\nwithin recommended, or more than recommended during pregnancy.\nFactors that contributed to an increased likelihood of gaining more weight than IOM\nguidelines recommended were assessed with weight gain category (less than recommended,\nwithin recommended, more than recommended) during pregnancy as the outcome. Bivariate\nanalyses, Chi-squared tests and ANOVA as appropriate, were performed evaluating factors\npotentially associated with pregnancy weight gain including baseline age, socioeconomic status\n(SES), race, ethnicity, federal poverty level (FPL), health status, insurance status, marital status,\nsituational history variables (homelessness, inadequate money, living with biological father),\npoor nutrition, alcohol use, tobacco use, other drug use, medical comorbidities, preexisting\nmedical conditions, time when prenatal care began, and prepregnancy BMI category.\nThe final adjusted multinomial logistic regression model included factors that were signifi-\ncant in the bivariate models or have been shown to be associated with weight gain during preg-\nnancy in the IOM's conceptual framework[9]. These included age, race, ethnicity, SES, current\nhealth and prepregnancy BMI category as covariates. Interactions between covariates, primar-\nily between prepregnancy BMI and age, were also investigated. All analyses were adjusted\nusing national survey weights with STATA version 13.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).\nThe University of Michigan IRB determined this study to be not regulated.\nResults\nThere were 1,413 mothers between the ages of 15 and 24 in the national sample with available\nmedical record data. Mothers who carried multiples (n = 20), gave birth prior to 37 weeks\n(n = 142) or had unknown gestational age at delivery (n = 3) were excluded from analysis. An\nadditional 214 mothers were removed due to missing either prepregnancy BMI or weight gain\nduring pregnancy data, leaving a final unweighted analytic sample size of 1,034.\nThe average age of the weighted sample was 21 years (SD = 3.0) with roughly equal distribu-\ntion across races and a large proportion (39.0%) being Hispanic and falling below the FPL\nWomen at risk for excess weight gain during pregnancy\nwere overweight prior to becoming pregnant (Table 1).\nBased on IOM guidelines over half (55.2%) of the weighted sample gained more than rec-\nommended during pregnancy, 27.2% gained within guidelines, and 17.7% gained less than rec-\nommended. Bivariate analysis found prepregnancy BMI to be the only factor significantly\nassociated with weight gain category (p-value = 0.002), with overweight and obese individuals\nhaving higher probabilities of gaining more than the recommended weight compared with\nother categories. (Table 1)\nA multinomial logistic regression model including age, race, ethnicity, federal poverty level,\ncurrent health and prepregnancy BMI category as covariates did not find any significant asso-\nciations between gaining less than recommended compared to within recommended guide-\nlines (Table 2).\nTable 1.

Overweight and obese individuals had higher likelihoods of gaining more than rec-\nommended, when compared with normal weight individuals (Relative Risk Ratio (RRR) (95%\nactions between prepregnancy BMI category and other covariates including age, race, ethnic-\nity, self-reported health and federal poverty level were not found to be significant.\nTable 2.

Marginal probabilities of gaining under, within, or over IOM guidelines by prepregnancy BMI.\nWomen at risk for excess weight gain during pregnancy\nThe marginal probability of each outcome category was estimated across prepregnancy\nBMI categories using the final model (Fig 1). Mothers who were overweight or obese prior to\ngetting pregnant had substantially higher probabilities of gaining more than the recommended\nguidelines, compared to normal-weight women. The other prepregnancy BMI groups showed\nno significant difference between probabilities of gaining under, within or over the recom-\nmended guidelines.\nDiscussion\nCategorical weight gain was similar in our sample of 15\u00ad24 year-old women compared to\ncohorts that include older women (under IOM guidelines: 18% vs 21%; within: 27% vs 32%;\nover: 55% vs 47%)[30]. Overweight and obese pregnant young women were more likely to\ngain excess weight during pregnancy compared to normal weight peers, while Hispanic young\nwomen were less likely than non-Hispanic peers to gain excess weight during pregnancy.\nThese findings are also consistent with previously reported national and state-level data that\nincluded older adults[9,14,31]. No characteristic was associated with gaining too little weight\ncompared to gaining within the guidelines.\nThough 15 year olds are arguably different than 24 year olds, younger mothers in our sam-\nple did not have a different risk for excess weight gain than older mothers. This finding high-\nlights the importance of prepregnancy BMI at any age for predicting weight gain during\npregnancy. Interestingly, Hispanic women in this study were found to be less likely to gain\nexcess weight. Future studies that aim to understand the reason for this distinction could help\ndevelop interventions among those at elevated risk for excess weight gain. Our findings also\nhave important implications for the care of pregnant adolescents, young women, and their\nchildren today.\nFirst, BMI is objective data that is readily obtained during usual clinical care and can be eas-\nily used to identify young pregnant women at-risk for gaining excess weight during pregnancy.\nThere is no need for complicated tests or a prolonged screening process. Based on a Cochrane\nSystematic Review, high-quality evidence indicates that diet or exercise, or both, during preg-\nnancy can reduce the risk of excessive weight gain in pregnancy[32]. Once at-risk women are\nidentified, available resources to improve diet and exercise habits can be provided to prevent\nlong-term morbidity associated with excess weight gain. Next, pregnancy has been shown to\nbe a time when women are particularly activated and engaged in their health[33,34]. Over-\nweight and obese adolescents and young women would likely benefit from support and\nresources to achieve healthy diet and exercise habits regardless of pregnancy status. During\npregnancy, young women often have increased number of clinical visits and community sup-\nport which can lead to greater opportunities to address these important issues.\nIn addition to intrauterine changes that may occur with excess weight gain in pregnancy,\npoor health habits are often passed on from mothers to their infants[34\u00ad36], creating an inter-\ngenerational cycle of poor health among these at-risk families. As a result, accurate informa-\ntion, resources and support to achieve healthy weight gain is particularly important for over-\nweight and obese pregnant adolescents and young women. Studies have shown that clinicians\nmay be uncomfortable discussing weight gain with pregnant women[37,38], but that pregnant\nwomen are interested in receiving more information about this topic[39]. Adolescent pregnant\nwomen in particular may have an even higher need for counseling due to the increased preva-\nlence of body dissatisfaction among this age group[40]. Interventions and programs must be\ndesigned that take adolescent-specific factors into account.\nFinally, obese adolescents have also been found to be significantly less likely to use birth\ncontrol compared to normal weight adolescents, despite having similar levels of sexual activity\nWomen at risk for excess weight gain during pregnancy\n[40]. Efforts to provide responsible education and resources to all adolescents to prevent unin-\ntended pregnancy can have greater effects beyond contraception; these efforts may also reduce\nthe risk of long-term morbidity associated with obesity among this at-risk group.\nLimitations\nOur findings are subject to certain limitations. First, these data are cross-sectional and cannot\nbe used to infer causation. BMI data was extracted from medical records and may be either\npatient self-report or anthropometric measurements. These data were also collected in 1998\nand 2000 and may no longer represent epidemiologic patterns seen today. However, our study\nuses a nationally representative sample of births among at-risk adolescents and young women,\nand includes many social factors that have been hypothesized to be related to weight gain dur-\ning pregnancy. Finally, our sample may not be sufficiently powered to examine interaction\neffects as described in our methods, though the results with our current sample (n = 1,034)\nfound only small effects that did not approach significance.\nConclusion\nPrepregnancy BMI and ethnicity are important factors that predict excess pregnancy weight\ngain among adolescents and young women age 15\u00ad24. Interventions and policies should focus\non high-risk women to prevent excess weight gain-related morbidity among these mothers\nand their children.\n"
