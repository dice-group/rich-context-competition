    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This study explores the current market value of the care provided\nby unpaid family members and friends to ill and disabled adults. Using large,\nnational data sets we estimate that the national economic value of informal\ncaregiving was $196 billion in 1997. This figure dwarfs national spending for\nformal home health care ($32 billion) and nursing home care ($83 billion).\nEstimates for five states also are presented. This study broadens the issue of\ninformal caregiving from the micro level, where individual caregivers attempt to\ncope with the stresses and responsibilities of caregiving, to the macro level of\nthe health care system, which must find more effective ways to support family\ncaregivers.\nIn a major policy initiative the Clinton administration\nrecently proposed a $6 billion five-year package to begin to ad-\ndress the long-term care needs of persons with chronic illness or\ndisabilities and their families.1 By explicitly recognizing that family\nmembers are the core long-term care providers in the U.S. health\ncare system, this initiative opens a long-overdue policy discussion.\nBecause \"informal\" caregiving lies outside the market economy\nand is socially and politically invisible, its economic value is not\ngenerally acknowledged. Although some aspects of families' contri-\nbutions to patient care are impossible to measure (such as the com-\nfort of being cared for at home), other aspects can be expressed\nquantitatively. This study addresses one such question: What is the\ncurrent market value of the unpaid caregiving provided by family\nmembers and friends to adults who are chronically or terminally ill\nor seriously disabled? There have been some limited attempts to\narrive at such a number, but no recent systematic estimates.2 This\nstudy begins to fill that gap.\n\u00a91999ThePeople-to-People Health Foundation,Inc.\nPeter Arno is a professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Social Medicine,Monte-\nfiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, in the Bronx, New York.

National prevalence figures were\nderived in two steps: (1) estimating the number of informal care-\ngivers; and (2) determining the hours of care provided per caregiver.\nFor the former we examined a variety of national data sets, including\nthe Survey on Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the Na-\ntional Survey of Families and Households (NSFH), the National\nHealth Interview Survey (NHIS), and the National Long-Term Care\nSurvey (NLTCS). Because SIPP and the NSFH provide the most\ncomprehensive data on the prevalence of caregiving in the general\npopulation, we used these surveys and their definitions of caregiving\nto develop our estimates. (The NLTCS includes only Medicare pa-\ntients over age sixty-five.)\nSIPP is a national, multipanel, longitudinal survey of adults, rep-\nresentative of households in the civilian, noninstitutionalized popu-\nlation.3 The 1986 survey wave collected information from approxi-\nmately 19,100 households on whether persons age fifteen or older\nneeded or provided personal assistance with everyday activities. A\nperson was considered to need personal assistance only if his or her\nlimitation was the result of a health condition that had lasted or was\nexpected to last three months or longer. We assumed that the ratio\nof caregivers to the U.S. population, by age cohorts, was the same in\nThe first wave of the NSFH included a national probability sam-\nRespondents were asked about the need for or provision of personal\nassistance due to a disability or chronic illness. A similar approach\nwas used to estimate the number of caregivers as described above.\nThe number of caregivers providing personal assistance to adults\n(age eighteen or older) was disaggregated by sex: 11.3 million men\nand 16.1 million women. Assuming that the ratio of caregivers to the\ngeneral population by age and sex was the same in 1997 as it was in\nNumber of caregiving hours. The best overall source of data for\nestimating the number of caregiving hours in the general population\nwas found in the National Family Caregiving Survey.5 Fielded in\n1996, the survey was based on a nationally representative sample of\n1,509 English-speaking households with telephones. This survey\nyielded an average of 17.9 caregiving hours per week. This figure was\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ M a r c h / A p r i l 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Richard Ernst and Joel\nHay estimated the number of unpaid caregiver hours from nine\nstudies of community-dwelling demented or mentally impaired pa-\ntients at 52.5 hours per week.6 In small-sample studies of Alzhe-\nimer's disease patients, ventilator-dependent patients, and Parkin-\nson's disease patients, investigators reported an average of 70.0, 58.8,\nWage rate. Two general approaches have been used in the litera-\nture to impute an economic value to the quantity of caregiving. The\nfirst entails measurement of the opportunity costs to caregivers of\nlost or forgone wages and benefits as a result of caregiving responsi-\nbilities.8 This approach is not used here because considerable care-\ngiving is provided by retired persons. Thus, to impute their eco-\nnomic worth only from forgone earnings would undervalue their\ncontribution. The second approach, which we have chosen, applies\na market wage rate to caregiving activity.9 Because our main focus is\nestimating the potential cost in today's market if informal caregiving\nhad to be replaced by paid workers, we selected a wage rate that\nreflects today's labor market.\nInitially, two wage rates were considered: the current minimum\nwage ($5.15 per hour) and the average, national rate for home health\naides ($11.20 per hour).10 Because caregiving tasks performed by\nfamily members range from the relatively unskilled to the highly\nskilled, we chose $8.18 per hour as a midrange wage rate. This figure\ndoes not include benefits or administrative overhead, which are\nrequired for formal employment.\nFindings\nCaregiving prevalence estimates derived from large, distinct, na-\ntional data sets generated a narrow range of estimates for the\nrange estimate is 25.8 million.11 Applying the average weekly figure\nof 17.9 hours of informal caregiving to the number of estimated\ncaregivers yields approximately 22\u00ad26 billion hours of caregiving\nper year, nationwide, with a midrange estimate of 24 billion hours.\nUsing midrange figures, the national economic value of informal\nThe economic value of informal caregiving in 1997 dwarfs national\nCAREGIVING\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 2\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

At the midrange estimate of\n$196 billion annually, the economic value of informal caregiving is\nequivalent to approximately 18 percent of total national health care\nspending ($1,092 billion). Informal caregiving is not counted as part\nof national health care spending. If it were, the trillion-dollar figure\nwould rise by nearly $200 billion.\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ M a r c h / A p r i l 1 9 9 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

California led the way, with\n2.9 million caregivers at an estimated economic value of $22.1 bil-\nImplications\nImputing an economic value to the extraordinary level of care-\ngiving described in this study does not detract from the emotional,\ncultural, and societal values expressed through informal caregiving.\nOn the contrary, it enhances their importance by providing a tangi-\nble measure of the vast but vulnerable base upon which our chronic\ncare system rests.\nToll on individuals, families, and society. Caregiving has be-\ncome a normative experience. Although it may bring personal grati-\nfication to some, it clearly takes a well-documented toll on many\ncaregivers' physical and mental health.13 The costs are not only to the\nindividual, however. Stress and exhaustion may lead to increased\nhealth care resources' being devoted to the caregiver as well as to the\npatient and may exacerbate family destabilization and impoverish-\nment. These are concerns not only for individuals and families but\nalso for the larger society. As the population ages and as chronic\nconditions continue to account for a high proportion of medical\ncosts, these concerns will become even more critical.14\nThis study has explored only one aspect of the economic impact\nof family caregiving. Other studies have addressed the substantial\ndirect costs families pay in unreimbursed health care expenses, even\nif they are insured.15 Other important factors are the loss of income\nand other benefits, such as Social Security, when a caregiver gives up\na job or reduces work hours.16\nPolicy options. Our focus on the economic value of informal\ncaregiving should not be interpreted as an argument to pay care-\ngivers. Neither do we dismiss this as a policy option. Several states\nalready have limited programs in place to pay informal caregivers.17\nPaying some categories of informal caregivers under clearly defined\ncircumstances may provide a level of flexibility and continuity that\nis difficult to attain in the formal system.\nBeyond the tax credits and state information and referral pro-\ngrams outlined in the Clinton administration's proposal, other op-\ntions include amending the Family and Medical Leave Act to make it\nmore accessible to employees in small firms and its benefits better\nknown to eligible workers. Social Security credits also might be\nCAREGIVING\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 8 , N u m b e r 2\nD a t a W a t c h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Because family caregivers are not\ntypically part of policy discussions, the limitations on their ability to\nprovide care and their needs for training and support are not usually\nconsidered when decisions are made about how to deliver care or\nsave money. Informal caregivers are seldom adequately trained and\nalmost never offered appropriate follow-up services, reevaluation of\ncare arrangements, or referrals to community services. They are left\nto negotiate an increasingly complex and fragmented system and to\nfind whatever help they can by whatever means they can.\nSpending for formal home health care has grown dramati-\ncally in recent years--more than three times faster than spend-\nconstrain this growth by better management and monitoring are\njustified. However, cutting costs by cutting vitally needed services\nwill only add to the already heavy burden on informal caregivers.\nThey are the bedrock of our nation's chronic care system; we must\nfind more effective ways to support and sustain them.\nThis study was conducted as part of the Families and Health Care Project (FHCP),\nUnitedHospitalFund(UHF),NewYorkCity.
