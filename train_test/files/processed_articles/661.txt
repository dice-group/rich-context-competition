Hogan3\n'Department of Community Health, Center for Gerontology and Health Care Research, Brown University.\n2Division of Community Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of Illinois at Chicago.\n'Department of Community Health, Center for Statistical Sciences, Brown University.\nUsing the 1992 National Health Interview Survey Cancer Control Supplement, relationships were analyzed between\nstage of readiness for smoking cessation and background characteristics, smoking behaviors, and smoking-related\nattitudes among smokers aged 18-29, 30-49, and >50 years. For each age group, an ordinal logistic regression\nmodel was computed to identify correlates of readiness to quit. The youngest smokers had attitudes most favorable\nto being ready to try to quit smoking. For smokers aged 30-49, the influence of a medical provider and perceived\nhealth effects of smoking were important correlates of readiness. Among smokers 50 and older, those with realistic\nhealth consequences of smoking and those who perceived smoking as addictive were more likely to be ready to quit.\nThe effectiveness of smoking cessation programs might be improved by matching interventions to a smoker's age\nand stage in the smoking cessation process.\nA LTHOUGH its prevalence has declined substantially,\n/ x cigarette smoking remains the primary cause of pre-\nventable death in the United States (Fiore et al., 1989;\nMcGinnis and Foege, 1993). Extrapolating from present\nrates of initiation and cessation, at least 22 percent of adults\nare expected to be smoking by the year 2000 (Pierce et al.,\n1989). Morbidity and mortality, especially due to lung can-\ncer, chronic obstructive lung disease, and heart disease, are\nincreased among both men and women who smoke (Kaplan\nand Human Services [USDHHS], 1989). Smoking cessation\nhas major and immediate health benefits for persons of all\nages with and without existing smoking-related disease\n(Gordon, Kannel, and McGee, 1974; Jajich, Ostfeld, and\nUSDHHS, 1990a). Because of the avoidable health risks\nassociated with cigarette smoking, smoking cessation is one\nof the most important public health concerns today.\nIn spite of more than two decades of research, continued\neffort is needed to develop effective smoking cessation\nstrategies for adults of all ages (Glynn, Boyd, and Gruman,\nstrategy is to take into account the readiness of individuals\nto change their smoking behaviors. A widely accepted way\nto operationally define readiness to quit smoking is stage\nof change, a key theoretical component of the Transtheoret-\nical Model of health behavior change (Prochaska and\nDiClemente, 1983). According to the model, modification\nof addictive behaviors involves progression through five\nstages: Precontemplation, Contemplation, Preparation,\nAction, and Maintenance (Prochaska, DiClemente, and\nNorcross, 1992). Most smokers recycle through some or all\nof the stages several times before they are able to stop\nsmoking permanently. The utility of the Transtheoretical\nModel in predicting smoking behavior change has been\nsupported by numerous studies (Prochaska, DiClemente,\nUnfortunately, few published studies have examined the\ndistribution of the stages of change in representative, popu-\nlation-based samples of smokers. Available data show\nvarying distributions of current smokers across stages of\nreadiness to quit (Precontemplation, Contemplation, Prepa-\nration). In a random-digit-dial telephone survey sample in\nRhode Island, 42 percent of smokers were in Precontem-\nplation, 40 percent were in Contemplation, and 18 percent\nwere in Preparation (Fava, Velicer, and Prochaska, 1995).\nStage distributions reported from a California survey some-\nwhat parallel the trend from Rhode Island with 37 percent\nof smokers in Precontemplation, 47 percent in Contempla-\nUsing a slightly different algorithm for assigning smokers\nto a stage, a prevalence survey in South Australia found 24\npercent of smokers in Precontemplation, 47 percent in\nContemplation, and 29 percent in Preparation (Owen et al.,\n1992). Variability in these distributions may be attributable,\nat least in part, to the fact that the definition used by Owen\net al. (1992) did not require a quit attempt in the previous\nyear as one of the criteria for classification into the Prepa-\nration stage. To date, there has not been a published report\nof the stage distribution of a nationally representative sam-\nple of current smokers in the United States. Interventions\nhave been developed from surveys of regional or local\nsamples. Knowing the stage distribution of smokers in the\ngeneral population has important benefits for refining\nstage-matched interventions for more broadly representa-\ntive samples of current smokers.\nThe Transtheoretical Model proposes that interventions\nbe designed with the realistic objective of moving persons\nsequentially from one stage to another. The majority of\nexisting interventions tend to recruit persons ready to make\na quit attempt and focus on making the transition from the\nPreparation to the Action stage. However, as the above\nstudies suggest, approximately 80 percent of smokers are\nin Precontemplation or Contemplation, and most currently\navailable interventions are not the most effective for them.\nTherefore, there is often a mismatch between a smoker's\nreadiness to quit and the goals of the intervention. Interven-\ntions that match materials to a participant's stage of readi-\nness to change have the potential for significant impact by\nemploying the broader, more representative recruitment\nstrategies of public health programs while tailoring the\nintervention to the needs and characteristics of smokers in\neach stage (Velicer and DiClemente, 1993; Velicer et al.,\nA second important strategy to improve the likelihood of\nsuccessful smoking cessation programs is to understand\ndifferences among age subgroups of the population.\nDespite the extensive literature on smoking cessation\nstrategies for the general population and for subgroups of\nsmokers defined by selected demographic characteristics,\nonly limited attention has been given to age as a basis for\ndesigning strategies that can motivate and assist smokers to\nquit. Furthermore, most results have not been presented in\nways that allow making age-related interpretations.\nAvailable data have shown inconsistent associations\nbetween age and stage in the smoking cessation process.\nFor instance, the Centers for Disease Control reported that\nthe proportion of smokers who say that they want to quit\nsmoking is lower among smokers age 50 and older (57%)\nthan it is among those younger than 50 years of age (68%;\nUSDHHS, 1990b). In a community-based demonstration\nproject, Lichtenstein, Lando, and Nothwehr (1994) found\nthat older smokers (55 to 74) expressed less interest in quit-\nting compared to younger smokers (25 to 54). In an analy-\nsis of a random sample of smokers in three age groups, 18\nfound that the oldest smokers were least likely to say they\nplanned to quit someday. However, among smokers who\nsaid they planned to quit someday, the oldest were most\nlikely to plan to quit within the next three months. In an\nanalysis of two random samples of smokers, Velicer et al.\n(1995) identified similarities by age in the distribution of\nsmokers in Precontemplation, Contemplation, and Prepara-\ntion except for smokers age 65 and older. In one sample, a\ngreater percentage of the oldest smokers were in the Prepa-\nration stage relative to the younger age groups, while in the\nother sample older smokers were disproportionately in the\nPrecontemplation stage. Due to these inconsistencies, it is\nimportant to better understand the relationship between age\nand stage of readiness in the smoking cessation process\nusing a nationally representative sample. More information\nabout the association between age and readiness to quit is\nimportant to the further development of age-tailored smok-\nThis article presents results from an analysis of correlates\nof stage of readiness for smoking cessation among three\nnational sample of current smokers. Our first goal was to\nanalyze differences by age in stage of readiness to quit\nsmoking. Our second goal was to identify age-specific cor-\nrelates of stage of readiness. Finally, we compared signifi-\ncant correlates of stage of readiness across the three age\ngroups.\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe data for this study were from the public release tape\nof the 1992 National Health Interview Survey-Cancer Con-\ntrol Supplement (NHIS-CCS), which is the most recent\nrelease of data about smoking attitudes and behaviors from\nthe NHIS that allows for determining stage of readiness for\nsmoking cessation (National Center for Health Statistics,\n1993). The NHIS is an annual household interview of ran-\ndomly selected persons 18 years of age and older. The Can-\ncer Control Supplement was an additional set of questions\nasked of half the sample. Although previous Supplements\nhave been conducted throughout the entire year with the\nNHIS, the 1992 Supplement was only administered for the\nfirst half of the year due to funding limitations.\nwho reported smoking cigarettes every day. Smokers were\ngories because they are generally representative of three\ngroups of smokers based on their smoking histories. Smokers\n18 to 29 can be characterized as recently initiated smokers,\nolder as long-term smokers. This was supported by differ-\nences in the mean number of smoking years reported by sub-\nAlso, this age categorization enabled us to compare our find-\nings with those from other studies (Kviz et al., 1994; Orleans\nDependent Variable\nBecause our sample consisted of current smokers, we clas-\nsified all subjects into one of the first three stages of change,\nwhich indicate a smoker's readiness to stop smoking. We\nused the operational definitions specified by Prochaska,\nDiClemente, and colleagues (DiClemente et al., 1991;\nProchaska and DiClemente, 1992): Precontemplation, in\nwhich a smoker has no intention to quit within the next 6\nmonths; Contemplation, in which a smoker is seriously con-\nsidering quitting within the next 6 months, or a smoker is\nseriously planning to quit within the next 30 days but has not\nmade a quit attempt in the past year; and Preparation, in\nwhich a smoker is seriously planning to quit within the next\n30 days and has made at least one quit attempt in the past\nyear. Unfortunately, recently quit and former smokers could\nnot be classified into the Action or Maintenance stages due to\nerrors in the NHIS questionnaire skip patterns.\nWe chose these operational definitions of stages of readi-\nness because they are the most widely used in the smoking\ncessation literature. Each stage represents a period of time\nas well as a set of tasks and intentions needed for move-\nment to the next stage. Previous studies have documented\nthat a recent quit attempt that resulted in a relapse is an\nimportant prompt for a future quit attempt, and that a proxi-\nmal intention to quit along with a recent quit attempt is an\nimportant distinction between smokers contemplating quit-\nting and those prepared for action (DiClemente et al., 1991;\nProchaska and DiClemente, 1992). Also, DiClemente and\ncolleagues (1991) verified that this categorical classification\nof smokers is predictive of both quitting attempts and ces-\nsation success.\nIndependent Variables\nWe selected independent variables that were identified in\nprevious studies as potential correlates of stage of readiness\nto stop smoking or were related to a smoker's age. Our\nselection of covariates and their response categories was\nconstrained by those available in the NHIS-CCS; three\nmajor types were selected: (a) background characteristics,\n(b) smoking behaviors, and (c) attitudes about smoking\ncessation.\nBackground characteristics. -- Background characteris-\ntics included gender, ethnicity, education, income, and mar-\nital status. Ethnicity, reported as White, Black, Hispanic,\nAmerican Indian, Eskimo, and several other Asian groups,\nwas recoded into Non-White and White. Education was\nmeasured as number of years of formal education and was\nrecoded as less than high school graduate (0-11 years),\nhigh school graduate (12 years), and some college or more\nIn addition, due to the large percentage of persons who\ndeclined to report income or did not know (N = 295,\n14.0%), an unknown category was also created to avoid the\nloss of a large portion of the sample. Marital status was\nreported as married, widowed, divorced, separated, or\nnever married and was reclassified as married and not mar-\nried. Self-rated health was measured as excellent, very\ngood, good, fair, and poor.\nBackground characteristics also included two measures\nof the influence of health care providers on helping a\nsmoker to stop. The influence of a medical provider was\nmeasured by two questions asking smokers if they had seen\na medical doctor in the past year and if this medical doctor\nhad advised them to stop smoking. Responses were com-\nbined into a single 3-category variable: no medical visit in\npast year, medical visit without advice to quit, and medical\nvisit with advice to quit. The influence of a dental provider\nwas measured similarly by asking smokers if they had seen\na dentist in the past year and if the dentist had advised them\nto stop smoking, with these responses then recoded into a\n3-category variable.\nSmoking behaviors. -- Smoking behaviors were mea-\nsured with two indicators. Average number of cigarettes\nsmoked per day was measured as a continuous variable and\nwas classified into less than 1 pack (1-19 cigarettes) and 1\npack or more (> 20 cigarettes). Adjusted percent of lifetime\nspent smoking was defined as the proportion of time\nbeyond age 12 in which an individual reported smoking on\na daily basis (computed by dividing the total number of\nyears a smoker reported smoking cigarettes daily by current\nage minus 12 years). This measure was categorized into 75\npercent or less and more than 75 percent (the median\nvalue).\nSmoking cessation attitudes. -- Smoking cessation atti-\ntudes were measured with six indicators. First, smokers\nwere asked if they thought smoking affects their health now\n(yes or no). Second, smokers were asked to rate on a 3-\npoint scale (unlikely, somewhat likely, very likely) the like-\nlihood of serious health problems if they continue to\nsmoke. Third, the perceived addictive nature of smoking\nwas measured by asking smokers whether they thought\nsmoking was a habit, an addiction, neither, or both.\nResponses were recoded into addictive (addictive or both)\nand not addictive (habit or neither).\nThe fourth attitude indicator was a count of the number\nof agreements with five statements about cigarette smoking,\ncoded so that higher scores indicated a more favorable atti-\ntude toward not smoking: (a) So many things cause cancer\nthat it doesn't matter if you smoke (reverse coded); (b) The\nsmoke from other people's cigarettes is harmful to you; (c)\nMost deaths from lung cancer are caused by cigarette\nsmoking; (d) Smoking should not be allowed in indoor\npublic places; and (e) Even if a person has smoked for\nmore than 20 years, there is a health benefit to quitting.\nNext, respondents were asked a 3-point rating (good, fair,\npoor) of the perceived likelihood of surviving lung cancer.\nTo include the large percentage of smokers who sponta-\nneously responded \"not sure\" (N = 323, 15.4%), a fourth cat-\negory was created. Finally, smokers were asked to rate on a\n3-point scale (not annoying, somewhat annoying, very\nannoying) their annoyance with the smoke from other peo-\nple's cigarettes. The categories of \"not annoying\" and\n\"somewhat annoying\" were combined for all analyses. For\nall measures of smoking cessation attitudes, a response of\n\"don't know\" or refusal were coded in the least favorable\ncategory, because noncommittal answers were considered\nnegative indicators of motivation to quit smoking.\nAnalysis Plan\nFor all analyses, we used the SUDAAN Release 7.0 soft-\nware package (Shah, Barnwell, and Bieler, 1996) in order\nto account for the sample weights and the complex survey\ndesign of the National Health Interview Survey.\nIndependent variables by age. -- We tested the null\nhypothesis that smokers in the three age groups (18-29,\npendent variables. Pearson x2 statistics were used to com-\npare percentage distributions for categorical variables, and\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare means\nfor continuous variables.\nStage of readiness by age. -- In order to determine if the\ndistribution of the stages of readiness to quit was similar\nacross age categories, we used the likelihood-ratio x2 statis-\ntic. First, we computed an overall test for associations\nbetween the three age groups and the three stages of readi-\nness categories (Precontemplation, Contemplation, and\nPreparation). Then, we decomposed the overall relationship\nbetween stage of readiness and age by partitioning the dis-\ntributions into finer subdivisions (Reynolds, 1977). To\ndetermine differences in the likelihood of being in Precon-\ntemplation versus Contemplation, we compared smokers\noldest smokers and compared them to smokers 30-49. Sim-\nilarly, to determine differences in the likelihood of being in\nearly (Precontemplation and Contemplation) versus later\n(Preparation) stages of readiness, we compared smokers\noldest smokers and compared them to smokers 30-49.\nCorrelates of stage of readiness: Multivariate analyses\nby age. -- For each of the three age groups, we fit a pro-\nidentify independent variables that were correlated with\nreadiness to quit. The proportional odds model is a logistic\nregression model for ordinal data. Its general form is:\nlog\n?x{Yi<k)\nPr{ Yi>k)\n= ou - x ,\nwhere Yi is the ordinal response for subject /; x, is a vector\nof explanatory variables; p is a vector of regression param-\neters; and the cu are cut points. For the three stages of\nreadiness, Yi takes on values 1, 2, or 3, and two cut points\nare required.\nIn a logistic regression for binary (0,1) response, (3 is the\nincrease in log odds of positive response corresponding to a\nunit increase in xi. Interpretation in a proportional odds\nmodel is similar: 3 corresponds to the increased log odds of\nbeing in a higher stage of readiness for every unit increase\nin xi. Consequently, ep is the odds ratio for being in a\nhigher stage when comparing two levels of a covariate.\nPositive values of 3 correspond to positive associations\nbetween Yi and xi.\nThe following model-building procedures were employed:\n1. We fit a proportional odds model for each of the three\nage groups.\n2. Using a likelihood-ratio statistic, each final age-specific\nmodel was compared to an age-specific model that\nincluded all covariates as main effects (i.e., the largest\nmodel we were willing to consider). A nonsignificant dif-\nference between the two models was regarded as evi-\ndence that the final model represented an appropriate fit\nto the data. An informal check of the proportional odds\nassumption for each final model was made by comparing\nthe log-likelihood to that from a multinomial model.\n3. To test whether the covariates differed across age groups,\nwe fit a single ordinal logistic regression model to the\nentire sample. In order to do this, the model included\nterms for the interaction between age and each of the\ncovariates that were significant in any of the separate\nage-specific models. Significance of interaction terms\nwas assessed using likelihood-ratio statistics. A signifi-\ncant interaction term indicated that the nature of a partic-\nular association was different across age groups.\nRESULTS\nBackground Characteristics and Smoking Behaviors by Age\nAs shown in Table 1, we found significant age-related\ndifferences for every background characteristic except\ngender. Although most smokers in each group were White,\nthe largest proportion of non-White smokers were age\nmost likely to have less than a high school education,\nwhereas smokers 30-49 were most likely to have been edu-\ncated beyond high school. Smokers 30-49 were also most\nlikely to have incomes of $20,000 or more. The youngest\nsmokers were least likely to have been married or living\nwith a partner.\nAs compared to the two younger age groups, the oldest\nsmokers expressed lower self-ratings of health. The oldest\nsmokers were most likely to have made a visit to a medical\ndoctor within the past year. Among those making a medical\nvisit, the oldest smokers were also most likely to report\nhaving been given advice to quit smoking. On the other\nhand, the oldest smokers were least likely to have made a\ndental visit in the past year. However, among those making\na dental visit, smokers aged 30-49 were least likely to have\nreceived advice to quit smoking during the visit. Average\ncigarettes smoked per day and the percentage of smokers\nwho had been smoking for 75 percent or more of their life-\ntime (since age 12) were positively associated with age.\nSmoking-Related Attitudes\nAge differences were found for all six attitude indicators\n(Table 2). Although the age-related trends were not strong\nfor any one indicator, the oldest smokers consistently\nexpressed attitudes least favorable to smoking cessation.\nThat is, the oldest smokers were least likely to think that\nsmoking affects their health now, that there is a strong like-\nlihood of serious health problems from smoking, and that\nsmoking is addictive. The oldest smokers were also least\nlikely to agree with statements about the harms of smoking\nand were most likely to erroneously believe that the likeli-\nhood of surviving lung cancer is good. Finally, the oldest\nsmokers were least likely to express that they become very\nannoyed by smoke from other people's cigarettes.\nStage of Readiness To Quit Smoking by Age\nAs shown in Table 3, about 60 percent of all smokers\nwere in the Precontemplation stage, more than 30 percent\nwere in the Contemplation stage, and less than 10 percent\nwere in the Preparation stage. Table 3 also shows that\nalthough the results were not exceptionally strong, there\nwas an overall association between age and stage of readi-\nness to quit smoking. Specifically, while smokers 18-29\nand > 50 did not differ in the likelihood of being in the\nContemplation versus Precontemplation stage, those aged\n30-49 were more likely than the other two age groups to be\nin the Contemplation stage. There were no differences by\nage in the likelihood of being in early (Precontemplation\nand Contemplation) versus later (Preparation) stages of\nreadiness to quit.\nCorrelates of Readiness To Quit Smoking\nTable 4 presents the final ordinal logistic regression mod-\nels of readiness to quit smoking. The first three columns of\nthe table are results of the final age-specific models of\nreadiness to quit. In these models, the odds ratios are pro-\nportional for all adjacent categories and are interpreted as\nthe relative odds of being in a higher stage of readiness.\nTable 1.

A covariate is considered\nsignificant if the 95% confidence interval excludes 1.0.\nThe pattern of significant covariates differed by age, as\nindicated by the fact that only one variable was significant\namong all three age groups. Agreeing with statements about\nthe harms of smoking was positively associated with readi-\nness to quit smoking for all smokers. Among smokers\n18-29 years, the only other significant correlate of readi-\nness to quit was race. Non-Whites were more likely to be in\nhigher stages of readiness. Among the 30-49 age group,\nsmokers were more likely to be in higher stages of readi-\nness if they had more than a high school education, had\nreceived advice to quit smoking in the past year during a\nmedical visit, had been smoking for 75 percent or less of\ntheir lifetime, thought smoking affects their health now,\nperceived serious health effects of smoking, and were very\nannoyed by smoke from other people's cigarettes.\nThe oldest smokers were similar to those aged 30-49 in\nthat they also were more likely to be in higher stages of\nreadiness to quit if they had received advice to quit during\nthe past year from a medical provider, had been smoking\nfor 75 percent or less of their lifetime, and perceived seri-\nous health problems from smoking. In addition, among the\noldest smokers, readiness to quit was associated with smok-\ning less than one pack of cigarettes per day and perceiving\nsmoking to be addictive.\nThe fourth column in Table 4 presents the results of the\ntests of interactions between age and each of the covariates.\nWe found three significant interactions by age. First, there\nwas a positive effect of education on readiness to quit in the\n30-49 age group, whereas there was no association with\neducation among the youngest and oldest age groups. Sec-\nond, perceiving smoking as addictive was not associated\nTable 2.

Finally, while perceptions of harms of smoking\nwere positively associated with readiness to quit among all\nsmokers, the effect was weakest in the oldest age group.\nDISCUSSION\nStage of Readiness To Quit Smoking\nThis is the first published report, to our knowledge, of\nthe distribution of stages of readiness to quit smoking in a\nnationally representative sample of current smokers in the\nUnited States. Other studies of random samples of current\nsmokers have found the distribution of stage of readiness to\nbe approximately 40 percent in Precontemplation, 40 per-\ncent in Contemplation, and 20 percent in Preparation (Fava,\net al., 1995). However, in this nationally representative\nsample, we found a higher percentage of smokers of all\nages in Precontemplation (60%), a somewhat smaller per-\ncentage in Contemplation (33%), and a lower percentage in\nPreparation (7%). The NHIS-CCS data show that, among\ncurrent smokers, the proportion in the Precontemplation\nstage is about 50 percent greater, and the proportion in the\nPreparation stage is about 50 percent less than was previ-\nously thought based on data from other studies that did not\nuse nationally representative samples (Velicer et al;, 1995).\nThe distribution of smokers by stage of readiness has\nimportant implications for the emphasis in smoking cessa-\ntion programs. Our findings support the conclusion of\nTable 4.

(1995) that smoking cessation programs\nshould focus on motivating the majority of smokers (who\nare in Precontemplation and Contemplation) to try to quit\nsmoking. However, the higher percentages in Precontem-\nplation and Contemplation also show that this need is even\ngreater than was suggested by the estimates presented in\nother studies (Fava, Velicer, and Prochaska, 1995; Kaplan\nsuggest that approximately 80 percent of smokers are in the\nfirst two stages of readiness to quit, findings from this anal-\nysis indicate that about 93 percent of current smokers are in\nthe Precontemplation or Contemplation stages. Therefore,\nwith the majority of current smokers in the Precontempla-\ntion stage, a strong emphasis still is needed to raise the\nawareness among smokers of all ages that their behavior\npresents a serious threat to their health and to move them to\nhigher stages of readiness to quit. If the nation is to achieve\nthe Year 2000 goal of reducing the smoking prevalence to\nno more than 15 percent among people aged 20 and older\n(National Center for Health Statistics, 1994), it is essential\nthat many more smokers become motivated to move out of\nthe Precontemplation stage of readiness to quit. As our find-\nings indicate, only about 7 percent of the total population of\ncurrent smokers is in the Preparation stage and is ready to\nmove into the Action stage. This means that changes are\nnecessary in many current smoking cessation programs that\nare targeted primarily at moving smokers into the Action\nstage.\nAge Differences in Readiness To Quit Smoking\nAs suggested by Biener and Abrams (1991), it is impor-\ntant to distinguish between two levels of readiness to quit\nsmoking: \"readiness to consider quitting\" and \"readiness to\nmake a quit attempt.\" We found a significant difference by\nage in readiness to consider quitting, with smokers age 30\nto 49 more likely than younger and older smokers to be in\nthe Contemplation stage relative to the Precontemplation\nstage. However, we found no differences by age in the per-\ncentage of smokers prepared to make a quit attempt com-\npared to those in Precontemplation and Contemplation.\nThese results are slightly different from those reported by\nother studies. Velicer et al. (1995) reported stability in the\nstage distributions across age, while Kviz et al. (1994)\nfound that smokers age 49 and younger were more likely to\nbe considering quitting while those 50 and older were more\nlikely to be ready to make a quit attempt. Neither of these\nprevious studies analyzed national samples. Also, Kviz and\ncolleagues did not use the operational definitions of stages\nthat were used for these analyses.\nWe also found important age-related differences in the\nsignificant covariates of readiness to quit. These findings\nsuggest that the effectiveness of stage-matched interven-\ntions might be enhanced by including age-sensitive recruit-\nment strategies and program content (Rimer and Orleans,\npromotion appears to be among smokers age 50 and older.\nSimilar to results reported by Kviz and colleagues (1994),\nwe found that older smokers had perceptions about the\neffects of smoking cigarettes that were least favorable to\nbeing ready to quit. While the oldest smokers were least\nlikely to perceive smoking as addictive, recognizing smok-\ning as an addiction was a correlate of readiness to quit\namong older adults but not younger ones. Similarly, while\nwe found that perceiving serious health problems from\nsmoking was associated with readiness to quit among the\noldest smokers, they were least likely to perceive that there\nis a strong likelihood of serious health problems from\nsmoking and that smoking affects their health now.\nUsing data from the Adult Use of Tobacco Survey,\nOrleans and colleagues (1994) also found a consistent dif-\nin the recognition or acceptance of smoking health harms.\nCompared to younger adults, older adults both underesti-\nmated the risks of smoking and perceived more benefits of\nsmoking. Furthermore, results from other studies have\nshown that older smokers, who have survived smoking-\nrelated health threats and still smoke despite unavoidable\npublic health messages, may deny or suppress awareness of\nsmoking-related symptoms (Orleans et al., 1991; Rimer et\nal., 1990). While we found that agreeing with statements\nabout the harms of smoking was positively associated with\nreadiness to quit for all smokers, this association was weak-\nest among smokers 50 years of age or older. Therefore,\nwhile interventions should reinforce both the immediate\nand long-term health harms of smoking among smokers of\nall ages, more emphasis about the consequences of smok-\ning and benefits of quitting are needed for older adults.\nFinally, we found that, unlike younger age groups, older\nadults who smoked one or more packs of cigarettes per day\nwere less likely to be ready to quit despite the fact that they\nare at high risk for adverse health effects associated with\nsmoking. Therefore, special strategies should also be con-\nsidered for heavier, long-term smokers among the oldest\nage group.\nThere were similar correlates of readiness to quit among\nsmokers aged 30 to 49 and the oldest smokers, suggesting\nthat some comparable intervention strategies may be\nemployed for these smokers. Among smokers aged 30 to 49\nand 50 and older, motivational strategies should be consid-\nered for long-term smokers, who were less likely to be\nready to quit smoking than those who had smoked for a\nsmaller percentage of their lifetime. These motivational\nmessages should take into account the habituation of the\nbehavior as well as a potential lack of confidence in the\nability to stop smoking as a result of prior failed quit\nattempts. One promising strategy for delivering smoking\ncessation information and materials is through advice from\nhealth professionals in clinical settings. Smokers who had\nbeen advised to quit by a medical doctor in the past year\nwere more likely than those without a medical visit to be in\nhigher stages of readiness to quit. Health care providers\nshould especially emphasize the health consequences of\nsmoking, as we found that those who perceived that smok-\ning affected their current health status and would likely\ncause serious health problems in the future were in higher\nstages of readiness to quit.\nAlthough they shared some similar correlates of readi-\nness to quit with older smokers, established smokers ages\n30 to 49 had attitudes more favorable to being ready to try\nto quit smoking. Furthermore, they were more likely than\nthe youngest and oldest smokers to be contemplating quit-\nting. However, they were no more likely than other age\ngroups to be preparing to take action. Therefore, interven-\ntions should focus on moving them from Contemplation to\nPreparation. Furthermore, unlike the other age groups, edu-\ncational level was positively associated with readiness to\nquit among smokers 30 to 49. Therefore, special strategies\nshould be considered for less educated smokers in this age\ngroup, who were less likely than those with education\nbeyond high school to be in higher stages of readiness\nto quit.\nWe also found that, unlike other age groups, smokers\naged 30 to 49 who reported being very annoyed by smoke\nfrom other people's cigarettes were in higher stages of\nreadiness to quit. This suggests that for a relatively small\ngroup of smokers, despite years of their own smoking,\nbecoming personally affected by smoke from other people's\ncigarettes is an important motivator for preparing to take\naction. Future studies should examine triggers of this\nannoyance and how realization of the nuisance of exposure\nto passive smoke can be used to motivate current smokers\nto make an attempt to quit.\nAmong smokers 18 to 29 years, the only other significant\ncorrelate of readiness to quit smoking was race. Non-\nWhites were slightly more likely to be in higher stages of\nreadiness to quit. While in bivariate analyses we found that\nthe youngest smokers had attitudes and smoking behaviors\nmost favorable to being ready to quit, our multivariate anal-\nysis did not provide insight as to how to assist younger\nadults in preparing to quit smoking. In a study using com-\nparable age categories, Kviz et al. (1994) found that per-\nceived desire, determination, and confidence in ability to\nquit were associated with readiness to quit smoking among\nyounger adults. Unfortunately, measures of these variables\nwere not available in the NHIS-CCS. Therefore, this should\nbe explored in future studies using national samples of\nsmokers.\nFuture Directions\nCaution is necessary when interpreting findings from\ncomparisons of age groups regarding a habitual and addic-\ntive behavior such as smoking (Hall, Tunstall, & Rugg,\n1984). Some of our findings might be explained by a cohort\neffect, related to differences in the nature and amount of\ninformation about smoking and quitting to which smokers\nwere exposed during the time they were smoking. Also,\nfindings from the oldest group may have been influenced\nby selection effects. The smokers in that age cohort who\nwere most likely to quit smoking already may have quit at a\nyounger age. Thus, current older smokers may be those\nwho were least motivated or least able to stop smoking.\nAlso, members of the older cohort who were most suscepti-\nble to smoking-related morbidity and mortality were less\nlikely to have been included in the sample because they\ndied or were too ill to participate. Therefore, future research\nshould include longitudinal and trend studies to distinguish\nthe attitudinal shifts which occur as a result of maturation\nfrom changes in secular trends or generation effects.\nIn this study, we used a broad age range for the oldest\nage group 4ue to the lower smoking prevalence among\nsmokers age 65 and older as well as a desire to compare our\nresults with other studies. However, this resulted in a het-\nerogeneous group of older adults. For example, adults 50 to\n64 may be more affected by workplace smoking policies\nand influential household members while the current cohort\nof smokers 65 and older may be strongly influenced by fre-\nquent contact with health care settings due to negative\nhealth effects related to life-long smoking habits. There-\nfore, future studies should include sufficient numbers of\nelderly smokers in order to conduct age-specific analyses\nwithin the cohort of smokers 50 years and older.\nPower to identify differences between the three age\ngroups we analyzed was restricted by the unequal distribu-\ntion of cases by age, in that almost half of the total sample\nwere in the 30 to 49 age group. Also, with the smaller num-\nnot have the same power to identify significant correlates of\nreadiness to quit within those age groups as for the 30 to 49\ngroup. Therefore, future studies should recruit sufficient\nnumbers of younger as well as older adults in order to have\ncomparable samples of smokers across the life span.\nFindings from this analysis are an important addition to\nthe limited age-related research about smoking cessation\nand show that there are age differences in factors associated\nwith stages of readiness to quit smoking. These results sup-\nport other studies of age differences in readiness to quit\nAge differences should be considered routinely when plan-\nning, implementing, and evaluating smoking cessation\ninterventions. In addition to matching interventions to a\nsmoker's stage in the smoking cessation process, our find-\nings suggest that the effectiveness of smoking cessation\nprograms might be improved by including age-sensitive\nrecruitment strategies, program content, and modes of\ndelivery.\n"
