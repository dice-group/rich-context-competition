Among\nadults ages 65 years, 50% reported an arthritis diagnosis\nattributable activity limitations (1). Arthritis and other\nrheumatic conditions remain the leading cause of disabil-\nity among adults in the US (3).\nThere is strong evidence supporting the beneficial ef-\nfects of physical activity (PA) for individuals with arthritis\n(4). The American College of Rheumatology highlights the\nimportance of PA for the management of arthritis (5,6).\nDespite this, a majority of individuals with arthritis do not\nengage in sufficient amounts of PA necessary to experience\nsuch benefits, and are less active than those without ar-\nthritis (7). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) Arthritis Program recommends 6 evidence-based\nPA programs for individuals with arthritis (8). The two\ninitial programs (i.e., Arthritis Foundation Aquatics Pro-\ngram, People with Arthritis Can Exercise [9]) were devel-\noped specifically for people with arthritis. However, there\nis growing evidence that programs not designed exclu-\nsively for people with arthritis may be beneficial and ap-\npropriate for people with arthritis (8).\nTwo non\u00adarthritis-specific evidenced-based PA pro-\ngrams, Active Living Every Day (ALED) and Enhance-\nFitness, were recently added to the CDC Arthritis Pro-\ngram's list of recommended interventions. Such programs\nare appealing in that a more \"generic\" intervention can be\noffered to the entire general population, yet still provide\nbenefits to those with arthritis. This may be particularly\nadvantageous for organizations that do not have resources\navailable to offer a wide range of disease-specific interven-\ntions (8).\nActive for Life (AFL) was a translational initiative that\nsuccessfully implemented two evidence-based PA behav-\nior modification programs (Active Choices [AC] and\nALED) into \"real-world\" community settings with diverse\nThe findings and conclusions in this report are those of\nthe authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation or institution affiliated\nwith the authors.\nThe   was supported by the Robert\nWood Johnson Foundation.\nMeghan Baruth, PhD, Sara Wilcox, PhD: University of\nSouth Carolina, Columbia.\nAddress correspondence to Meghan Baruth, PhD, Public\nHealth Research Center, 921 Assembly Street, Columbia, SC\nSubmitted for publication November 9, 2010; accepted in\nArthritis Care & Research\n\u00a9 2011, American College of Rheumatology\npopulations. AFL resulted in significant improvements in\nPA and a number of other PA-related variables (10). A\nlarge proportion (64%) of participants in AFL self-reported\ndoctor-diagnosed arthritis. The purpose of this study was\nto examine whether changes in PA and PA-related out-\ncomes in participants in AC and ALED, both general PA\nprograms, differed in participants with and without\narthritis.\nThe methodology and major findings of AFL are described\nin more detail elsewhere (10,11). AFL was a 4-year initia-\ntive that evaluated the effects of two evidence-based be-\nhavioral PA interventions, ALED and AC, on self-reported\nPA and other PA-related outcomes. The interventions\nwere implemented by 9 public health, senior service,\nhealth care, and grassroots organizations across 12 sites.\nThe programs were typically implemented by non\u00adhealth\ncare professional staff members from each organization\nInterventions. In AFL, AC was a 6-month telephone-\nbased program (12\u00ad14). Participants received an initial\nface-to-face orientation, followed by up to 8 one-on-one\ntelephone counseling calls. The counseling was tailored to\nthe participant's readiness for change (15) and emphasized\nkey behavioral constructs in the social cognitive theory\n(16). During each call, the health educator discussed the\nparticipant's current level of PA, their readiness for\nchange, a specific behavior change principle, and modified\nPA goals, if necessary.\nEach week, participants attended a 60-minute group-based\nsession that focused on behavior change principles consis-\ntent with the social cognitive theory (16). The goal of\nALED was to help participants accumulate a minimum of\n30 minutes of PA on most days of the week. Participants\nwere encouraged to provide support and share successes\nand challenges with one another.\nBoth AC and ALED are behavioral programs that do not\ninclude structured PA as a part of the intervention ses-\nsions. In AFL, 4 organizations implemented AC and 5\norganizations implemented ALED.\nParticipants. The 9 participating organizations re-\ncruited participants through their networks and from the\ncommunity at large. Recruitment strategies were tailored\nto the community they targeted. The most successful re-\ncruitment efforts were onsite staff recruitment, presenta-\ntions at the facilities, direct mail, flyers, newsletters, and\nlocal media. Participants were ages 50 years, sedentary\nor underactive (2 days/week and 120 minutes/week),\nand free of medical conditions or disabilities that required\nhigher levels of supervision, as determined by lead staff\n(e.g., unstable angina) (10).\nResearch design and procedures. This study used a\nof the participants completed an informed consent form\napproved by the Institutional Review Boards at the Uni-\nversity of South Carolina and Texas A&M Health Science\nCenter, and review boards or legal departments of the lead\norganizations.\nSelf-report outcomes. Comprehensive surveys were ad-\nministered to all participants in year 1 (100 per site) and\nto the first 100 participants per site in years 3 and 4. This\ndecision was made a priori, as it was not necessary for\nadequate statistical power to collect survey data on all\nparticipants across all years. A shortened version of the\nsurvey that collected several key outcomes was given to\nthe rest of the participants in years 3 and 4. Although the\nintervention was delivered during year 2, outcome data\nwere not collected.\nAfter year 3, the lead organizations taking part in AFL\nrequested that the ALED program be shortened to 12\nweeks. Although the program was shortened in year 4 (i.e.,\nlasted 12 weeks, not 20 weeks), steps were taken to ensure\nthat essential elements were maintained (10). Participants\ntaking part in the ALED intervention during year 4 com-\npleted a 12- (all short versions) and 20-week posttest sur-\nvey. This study only uses the 20-week data from year 4.\nSociodemographic, health-related, and other variables.\nParticipants self-reported height and weight to compute\nbody mass index (BMI), date of birth, sex, marital status,\nrace/ethnicity, and education level. Self-reported absence\nor presence of arthritis was assessed by asking partici-\npants, \"Have you ever been told by a doctor, nurse, or\nother health professional that you had arthritis?\" Dropout\nrates were tracked by AFL staff.\nPA. The 41-item Community Healthy Activities Model\nProgram for Seniors questionnaire assessed PA (19). This\nself-report measure assesses the frequency and duration of\nvarious activities typically undertaken by older adults for\nexercise, activities undertaken in the course of their day\nthat are physical in nature, and recreational activities that\nprovide PA. Hours/weeks spent in moderate- to vigorous-\nintensity PA (MVPA; metabolic equivalents value of 3.0\nacceptable test\u00adretest reliability (22), and is sensitive to\nPA was also assessed using a secondary 3-item measure\nfrom the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System that\nassessed participation, frequency, and duration of moder-\nSignificance & Innovations\n General physical activity programs (i.e., Active\nChoices and Active Living Every Day) may be ap-\npropriate for people with arthritis.\n Improvements in physical activity, physical func-\ntioning, and other physical activity\u00adrelated behav-\niors were similar for those with and without arthritis.\nDifference in AFL Outcomes in Those With and Without Arthritis 1039\nate intensity PA (25). Participants were classified as meet-\ning (30 minutes/day, 5 days/week) or not meeting PA\nrecommendations (26).\nDepressive symptoms. The 10-item Center for Epidemi-\nologic Studies Depression Scale (27\u00ad29) assessed symp-\ntoms of depression during the past week. Scores range\nfrom 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater depres-\nsive symptoms.\nPerceived stress. A 4-item version of the Perceived\nStress Scale (30,31) measured the degree to which situa-\ntions in one's life are appraised as stressful. Scores range\nfrom 0 to 16, with higher scores indicating greater per-\nceived stress.\nBody satisfaction. Satisfaction over the past 4 weeks\nwith 9 aspects of body appearance and function was as-\nsessed on a 7-point scale. Two subscales were derived\nfrom factor analysis (32): satisfaction with body appear-\nance (3 items) and satisfaction with body function (6\nitems). Scores range from 9 to 9 (appearance) and from\n18 to 18 (function), with higher scores indicating\ngreater satisfaction.\nPhysical performance outcomes. One ALED site admin-\nistered 4 performance-based physical functioning tests.\nEach test was administered during all 4 years of AFL with\nthe exception of the Chair Sit-and-Reach Test, which was\nonly administered during year 3. The methods used in\nadministering physical functioning measures are reported\nin greater detail elsewhere (33). Lead staff was trained by\nan expert in physical functioning in how to administer the\nperformance-based measures. The test manual and video-\ntape provided by Human Kinetics were used to aid train-\n30-second Chair Stand Test. The 30-second Chair Stand\nTest assessed lower body strength (34). Participants sat in\nthe middle of a 17-inch high chair with their back straight,\nfeet flat on the floor, and arms crossed at the wrist and held\nagainst the chest. On the signal \"go,\" participants rose to a\nfull stand and returned to a fully seated position. Partici-\npants completed as many stands as possible in 30 seconds.\nEight Foot Up-and-Go Test. The Eight Foot Up-and-Go\nTest assessed agility and dynamic balance (34). Partici-\npants sat in the middle of a 17-inch high chair with their\nback straight, feet flat on the floor, and hands on the thighs.\nOn the signal \"go,\" participants got up from the chair,\nwalked as quickly as possible around a cone placed 8 feet\nfrom the chair, and sat back down. Measured in seconds, a\nshorter time is better.\nChair Sit-and-Reach Test. The Chair Sit-and-Reach\nTest assessed lower body (primarily hamstring) flexibility\n(34). Participants sat on the front edge of a 17-inch high\nchair and extended one leg out as straight as possible in\nfront of the hip, with the foot flexed and heel resting on the\nfloor. Participants slowly bent forward at the hip joint,\nreaching as far forward as possible toward (or past) the\ntoes. The distance from the tips of the middle fingers to the\ntop of the shoe was measured. Measured in inches, a\nlonger distance is better.\n30-Foot Walk Test. The 30-Foot Walk Test assessed gait\nspeed (35). On the signal \"ready, go,\" participants started\nwalking at their normal speed. The stopwatch did not start\nuntil the participant crossed the 10-foot line, and was\nsubsequently stopped when the participant crossed the\n40-foot line. The time, in seconds, to complete the test was\nconverted to gait speed (meters/second). A faster gait\nspeed is better.\nImpairment status. Rikli and Jones' (34) age- and sex-\nbased normative data were used to classify participants as\nimpaired (less than or equal to twenty-fifth percentile) or\nnot impaired at baseline and postprogram on the 30-Sec-\nond Chair Stand Test, the Eight Foot Up-and-Go Test, and\nthe Chair Sit-and-Reach Test. Because normative data for\nthe 30-Foot Walk Test are not available from Rikli and\nJones (34), data from a recent meta-analysis (36) were used\nto classify participants' gait speed as impaired (less than or\nequal to twenty-fifth percentile) or not impaired at base-\nline and postprogram.\nStatistical analyses. Participants who completed any\nbaseline outcome measure (or physical functioning test for\nsubanalyses) and had complete model covariates were in-\ncluded in the baseline demographic analyses. Differences\nin postprogram outcome measure completion and dropout\nrates, as well as demographic, health-related, and other\nkey outcome variables, among participants with and with-\nout arthritis were examined with the chi-square test or\nanalyses of variance. Square root transformations were\nconducted on both baseline and postprogram scores for\nMVPA and the Eight Foot Up-and-Go Test, as these mea-\nsures were skewed and/or had high kurtosis. The transfor-\nmations successfully corrected the problem(s).\nRepeated-measures analyses of covariance that con-\ntrolled for site clustering (using SAS PROC MIXED) were\nconducted to examine whether changes in outcomes from\nbaseline to postprogram differed by arthritis status (yes/\nno). Changes in dichotomous outcome variables were as-\nsessed using SAS PROC GLIMMIX. Arthritis  time inter-\nactions were tested in each model, and all models\ncontrolled for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and BMI. Using the\nadjusted means and the unadjusted baseline SD, effect\nsizes (d  [postprogram mean  baseline mean] / baseline\nSD) were computed for each of the continuous outcome\nconsidered small, d  0.5 was considered medium, and\nd  0.8 was considered large.\nRESULTS\nA total of 5,604 participants completed at least one base-\nFigure 1 shows the number of participants with baseline\nand followup data for each intervention group by arthritis\nstatus. Self-reported arthritis was reported in 56% (AC)\nand 61% (ALED) of participants. Table 1 shows the base-\nline demographic, health-related, and outcome measures\nfor each intervention group, and for those with and with-\nout arthritis separately. In both groups, those with arthritis\nwere more likely to be women and have higher BMIs; were\nolder, less educated, less likely to be married, more de-\npressed, and less satisfied with their body function; and\nwere more likely to have higher levels of perceived stress.\nIn the AC group, participants with arthritis engaged in less\nPA, were less likely to be African American, and were less\nlikely to be Hispanic. In the ALED group, participants with\narthritis were less likely to meet PA recommendations and\nless likely to be satisfied with their body appearance.\nAt least one physical functioning test was completed by\n619 participants at baseline (from one ALED site). Of this\nsample, 68% self-reported arthritis. Table 2 shows the\ndemographic, health-related, and outcome measures for\nthose with and without arthritis separately. Participants\nwith arthritis were more likely to be women, performed\npoorer on the Eight Foot Up-and-Go Test and 30-Foot Walk\nTest, and were more likely to be classified as impaired on\nthe Eight Foot Up-and-Go Test than those without\narthritis.\nPostmeasure followup and dropout rates are shown in\nTable 3. There were no significant differences in the per-\ncentages of participants with and without arthritis who\ncompleted postmeasures or dropped out, for any interven-\ntion group.\nAC. The adjusted baseline and postprogram mean\nscores for all outcomes, as well as the calculated effect\nsizes for participants with and without arthritis in the AC\nintervention, are shown in Table 4. There was a significant\narthritis  time interaction for MVPA (P  0.01), meeting\nPA recommendations (P  0.047), and satisfaction with\nbody appearance (P  0.04). Significant improvements\nwere seen in all outcomes for both participants with and\nwithout arthritis; however, those without arthritis im-\nproved significantly more than those with arthritis. There\nwere no other significant arthritis  time interactions for\nany of the other variables, indicating no difference in\nchange over time for participants with and without arthri-\ntis. There was a significant main effect for satisfaction with\nbody function (P  0.001), indicating improvements over\ntime regardless of arthritis status. There were no signifi-\ncant time effects for depressive symptoms (P  0.16) or\nALED. The adjusted baseline and postprogram mean\nscores for all outcomes, as well as the calculated effect\nsizes for participants with and without arthritis in the\nALED intervention, are shown in Table 5. There was a\nsignificant arthritis  time interaction for depressive\nsymptoms (P  0.008), where depressive symptoms signif-\nicantly decreased in participants with arthritis but did not\nchange in participants without arthritis. There were no\nother significant arthritis  time interactions for any of the\nother variables, indicating no difference in change\nover time for participants with and without arthritis.

With the exception of\ndepressive symptoms and perceived stress in the AC pro-\ngram (which did not improve in those without arthritis\neither), significant improvements in all PA, PA-related,\nand physical functioning outcomes were seen for people\nwith arthritis. With a few exceptions, improvements (ef-\nfect sizes) were similar in magnitude to those without\narthritis.\nAlthough PA is beneficial to people with arthritis, the\nsymptoms of arthritis often deter individuals from engag-\ning in regular PA (39,40). Medium to large increases (ef-\narthritis in both intervention groups. The percentage of\nparticipants with arthritis meeting PA recommendations\nalso nearly tripled in both groups. Furthermore, there were\nno negative outcomes reported, lending support to the\nsafety of ALED and AC for individuals with arthritis. It is\ndifficult to compare our findings to other studies due to\ndifferences in study design. However, thus far, findings\nfrom arthritis-specific community-based PA interventions\nDepression is common among people with arthritis\n(44,45).

Al-\nthough participants with arthritis were more depressed at\nbaseline than those without arthritis and therefore had\nmore room for improvement, depression scores in all par-\nticipants were quite low. ALED is a group-based program\nwhere social interactions occur often, and support from\nother group members is encouraged. Participants may\nhave found reassurance in talking to other participants\nwho were attempting to make similar lifestyle changes.\nThis may have been especially useful and important to\nparticipants with arthritis who may experience unique\nchallenges and barriers when becoming active. Similar to\nour findings for AC, no changes in depressive symptoms\nhave been reported in other community-based arthritis-\nspecific intervention studies (41,42); however, as stated\nearlier, caution should be taken when comparing findings\ndue to differences in study design.\nPerceived stress (ALED only) and satisfaction with body\nappearance and function also significantly improved in\nparticipants with arthritis (small to medium effect sizes).\nThese variables have not been measured in other studies\ntargeting people with arthritis; therefore, it is hard to make\ncomparisons across studies. However, these measures are\nimportant and pertinent to individuals with arthritis. Be-\ning satisfied with one's body appearance and function\nmight be particularly important for people with arthritis,\nwho may be more likely to experience problems with\nenergy, stamina, strength, and functioning.\nNearly 40% of adults with arthritis report arthritis-\nattributable activity limitations (46). Functional declines\nare common in people with arthritis (47\u00ad50), although PA\nmay help to prevent them. Significant improvements were\nseen in all physical functioning measures in the sub-\nsample of participants with arthritis performing the phys-\nical functioning tests. Effect sizes were in the small to\nmedium range; applied across the population, improve-\nments in function would be very meaningful. The percent-\nage of participants with arthritis who were classified as\n\"impaired\" also significantly decreased between 11% and\n18%. These findings are promising, as individuals with\narthritis who may already be experiencing declines in\nphysical functioning can also benefit from PA-based pro-\ngrams (i.e., ALED); it may be possible to reverse such\nimpairments. A recent meta-analysis (51) of randomized\ncontrolled trials found that community-deliverable exer-\ncise interventions resulted in a small but statistically sig-\nnificant improvement in physical functioning.\nAlthough MVPA, meeting PA recommendations, and\nsatisfaction with body appearance significantly improved\nin AC participants with arthritis, the improvements were\nnot as large as those seen in participants without arthritis.\nOne possible explanation for these findings is that AC did\nTable 5.

Additional\nstudies are needed to understand how these outcomes may\nbe improved even more in individuals with arthritis. Fur-\nthermore, although improvements in PA and a number of\nPA-related variables, all of which are important and rele-\nvant for people with arthritis, resulted from the AC and\nALED interventions, this study did not measure other vari-\nables that are more specific to individuals with arthritis\n(e.g., pain, fatigue, stiffness). Therefore, it is unclear\nwhether ALED and AC would produce meaningful\nchanges in such variables. Future studies are needed to\nexplore this in more detail.\nAlthough the effectiveness of AC among individuals\nwith arthritis has not been evaluated (or at least reported),\nthe effectiveness of ALED has. Fontaine and colleagues\n(52) conducted a pilot study in a sample of participants\nwith fibromyalgia based \"loosely\" on ALED. However, in-\nformation specific to fibromyalgia was incorporated into\nthe intervention, and therefore the original ALED was not\ntested. Callahan et al (53) tested the effectiveness of ALED\nin a large sample of participants with arthritis. Although\nresults from the trial have not yet been published, quali-\ntative data indicate that ALED was safe and appropriate for\npeople with arthritis, and modifications to the program to\nmake it more relevant for people with arthritis were sug-\ngested by the participants and instructors (53).\nThis study had a number of strengths, including the\nlarge sample size, the diverse sample, and the objective\nmeasures of functional fitness on a subsample. We also\nrecognize study limitations. Perhaps the largest limitation\nis the lack of a control group. However, the goal of AFL\nwas not to test the efficacy of AC and ALED, but to test\nwhether both programs could be successfully translated\ninto the community. Therefore, although internal validity\nmay be threatened, the focus on external validity adds to\nthe overall science-based literature. Second, the presence\nof arthritis was self-reported; there was no validity check\nto confirm the presence of doctor-diagnosed arthritis.\nThird, the type and severity of arthritis were not measured;\nit is possible that our sample had low symptoms (i.e., pain,\nfatigue) that may have influenced our findings. Partici-\npants with more severe symptoms might not have done as\nwell in the programs. Fourth, a number of self-report mea-\nsures were used, which could be subject to biases. Finally,\nbecause only one site (ALED) administered functional fit-\nness tests and because not all participants were required to\ncomplete the long version of the survey, sample sizes for\nsome outcomes were significantly lower.\nArthritis and its related complications remain an enor-\nmous public health problem. The CDC recommends a\nnumber of PA interventions for people with arthritis, some\nof which were recently added (8). Although options are\navailable to clinicians and public health officials, partici-\npation in these programs is very low (9). AC and ALED\nresulted in improvements in PA, physical functioning, and\nother PA-related variables in participants with arthritis\nthat were similar to those without arthritis. PA programs\nsuch as AC and ALED that target the general population,\nbut may also result in improvements in PA, functional\nfitness, and other PA-related behavior in individuals with\narthritis, are promising, as a larger and perhaps more di-\nverse group of individuals could be reached.\n"
