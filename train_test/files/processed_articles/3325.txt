Here we consider the\npossibility that observers might instead, or concurrently, represent local surface shape, a geometrical\ninvariant with respect to motions. Observers judge local surface shape, in a picture of a piece of\nsculpture, on a five-point categorical scale. Categories are cap\u00adridge\u00adsaddle\u00adrut\u00adcup\u00adflat, where\n\"flat\" denotes the absence of shape.

There exist remarkable inter-observer differences. Over a group of 10 naive observers we\nfind that the dispersion of judgments peaks at the saddle category.

It fre-\nquently happens when you look \"into,\" as opposed to \"at,\" pictures (Ames, 1925a, 1925b; Clapar\u00e8de,\nSchlosberg, 1941; Schwartz, 1971), but it may also happen when you look \"into\" the clouds, or \"into\"\na dirty old wall (Leonardo da Vinci, 1651). Pictorial awareness appears categorically different from\nmore frequent modes of visual awareness. Unfortunately, it is not always obvious how to identify the\nnature of the awareness in experimental phenomenology. Observers monitor the mode of their present\nvisual awareness as a level of momentary reality.\nConsider some of the major differences between \"generic,\" and pictorial visual awareness. In\ndaily interactions with the physical environment the eyes play an important role, even though one is\nnot immediately aware of their functions at any moment. Most visual processes run automatically,\nindependent of awareness. This is the major function of the eyes from the perspective of biological\nfitness. Theories of enactive perception (Gibson, 1950) apply. In the cases of \"good looks,\" or even\nscrutiny, visual awareness remains closely tied to the environment. The visual ego-center (\"eye\" for\nshort) is experienced as being \"in,\" or \"part of\" that environment. Objects in visual awareness are in\nthe same space as the eye. They are experienced as having backsides, even if one momentarily sees\nonly their frontsides. That is because one may change perspective voluntarily, and reckon with others\nhaving a different perspective. Man shares this type of awareness with all other vertebrates (Spelke,\na Pion publication\nLocal shape of pictorial relief\n189 Koenderink J, van Doorn A, Wagemans J\nFigure 1. Left: on the poster (designed by Alfred Leete, first appeared as cover of \"London Opinion,\" on the 5th\nof September 1914) Lord Kitchener points right at you, quite independent of the perspective you take. This shows\nvividly that pictorial space is not \"connected\" to the space you move in. Center: Magritte \"The Schoolmaster\"\n(1954). Notice that there is no geometrical transformation of pictorial space that will allow you to see the face.\nRight: illustration (\"Full muscular detail\") from Rimmer'sArtAnatomy (1877), drawn from the imagination. This\nevokes the impression of a highly articulated pictorial relief. Notice how local shape varies from point to point\nover the surface.\nThese observations are crucial in understanding the pictorial mode. In pictorial mode one can-\nnot voluntarily change the physical perspective, although the mental perspective (Koenderink, van\nDoorn, Kappers, & Todd, 2001) may vary. Such a change of mental perspective cannot reveal novel\ngeometrical aspects. The eye is not in pictorial space. It is \"elsewhere\" in the sense that it is logically\nimpossible for the eye to be in pictorial space. This is different from being outside a house, which one\nmay simply re-enter. Nothing in physical space is in pictorial space, not even the picture surface if\nthere is one. That is why Lord Kitchener (in Figure 1 left) always points right at any observer, even\nwhen they view it from an awkward angle.\nIn summary, pictorial space is a mental entity, without proper physical \"cause.\" The picture of a\nhorse is not a physical horse, but a piece of paper covered with some arrangement of pigments. Thus\npictorial objects have to be studied through methods of experimental phenomenology. Moreover, as\ndiscussed above, the geometry of pictorial space is not Euclidean. Empirical methods have to take\nthis into account. We have developed a battery of empirical methods in the past. This project is still in\na continual stage of development. At this moment our understanding of pictorial space, and pictorial\nreliefs, is still very incomplete.\n1.2 Representation of pictorial relief: Planelets and surflets\nIn this study we aim to study a novel method, designed to probe properties of opaque pictorial objects.\nSuch objects are experienced as volumetrically complete--even though they lack backsides--spatial\nentities, perceived through their frontal surfaces, usually denoted as \"pictorial reliefs.\" These objects\nhave locations, spatial attitudes, and shapes, although these geometrical entities lack proper physical\ncounterparts.\nSince the physical eye, and the pictorial object are mutually \"elsewhere,\" there exists no rational\nway to define a \"distance\" between them (Koenderink et al., 2011). In some sense the eye is at \"infinite\"\ndistance from any pictorial location. However, pictorial objects do have mutually different locations.\nThis is perhaps somewhat understandable in the case of the fronto-parallel dimensions--although one\nmight rightfully object to this relation being trivial (Lotze, 1852)--but it is certainly problematic in the\ncase of the \"third\" dimension. This latter dimension is conventionally known as \"depth\" (Koenderink\net al., 2011). Absolute depth is a non-entity, but depth differences between pictorial locations make\nsense. The length unit is certainly incommensurable with that applied in the fronto-parallel though.\nThus one prefers to conceive of pictorial space as \"211\", rather than three-dimensional.\nOn the basis of a large body of empirical data, we have formulated a geometry of pictorial space\nwith excellent descriptive and predictive power (Koenderink & van Doorn, 2012). It is a non-Euclidean\ngeometry of a very simple type, in that the third dimension is isotropic (Bell, 1998; Strubecker, 1941,\nLocal shape of pictorial relief 190\nfact that full turns about fronto-parallel axes do not exist in this space: if one looks at a portrait in\nen face pose, one is forever unable to see the back of the head (and vice versa, see Figure 1 center).\nWhy? Because it was never painted in the first place! But in Euclidean geometry full turns about arbi-\ntrary axes are nothing special, hence the problem.\nIn a scientific investigation one desires to simplify things as much as possible, without losing the\nrelevant aspects in the process. In geometry one of such attempts is to zoom in on local structure--so-\ncalled \"differential geometry\" (Coxeter, 1961).\nThe most local description of a narrow region on a surface is its location. This approximates the\nsurface as a single point, for formal reasons it is known as the \"zeroth order\" approximation (Bell,\n1998). The surface then exists as a \"depth map.\" The next stage in articulation is to consider the local\nspatial attitude. One considers the local surface as a \"planelet\" (Barrow, 1735). This is the \"first order\"\napproximation. To treat the globe as flat--as our ancestors did--is to stick to the first order. The next\nstage in articulation is to consider the local deviations from planarity. One considers the local surface\nas a \"surflet.\" This is the \"second order\" approximation.\nPlanelets are fully described by their spatial attitude, say slant and tilt. For surflets the number of\npossibilities multiplies. In the case of the globe, one would recognize it as spherical. The first visual\nround-up is due toAlberti (1436), who recognizes such surflets as \"like the outside of egg shells,\" \"like\nthe inside of egg shells,\" \"like columns,\" \"like the inside of reeds,\" and \"like a water surface.\" These\npossibilities are qualitatively distinct, as opposed to the lower orders, where the various cases are only\nquantitatively different. This was generally affirmed for several centuries, till Gauss (1827) published\nhis catalog, which added \"like a horse's saddle.\" Of course, Gauss' paper is framed in terms of math-\nematical formalism. Alberti thinks of shape like a continuously distributed surface quality, much like\ncolor, a surflet map.\nFormally, the \"quality\" that one colloquially calls \"shape\" can be indexed through the signs of\nthe curvatures of two mutually orthogonal sections. Generic possibilities are (Figure 2) 11 (cap,\nthat is \"like the outside of egg shells\"), 12 (saddle, that is \"like a horse's saddle\") and 22 (cup,\nthat is \"like the inside of egg shells\"), with transitional forms 10 (ridge, that is \"like columns\"),\nand 20 (ruts, that is \"like the inside of reeds\"). A non-generic case is 00 (flat, that is \"like a water\nsurface\"), which is actually a quantitative, rather than qualitative distinction (see Appendix at\nhttp://i-perception.perceptionweb.com/journal/I/volume/5/article/i0659). The generic surflets occur\nover areas, whereas the transitional forms occur on certain special curves bounding such areas (see\nAppendix).\n1.3 Aim of the present study\nIt is not known how reliefs are represented in human vision. Obvious possibilities are in terms of\ndepth maps, planelet maps, surflet maps, and so forth. Figure 3 illustrates some of these possibilities.\nA surface represented by a finite number of points, or depth values, is fully determined. A surface\nrepresented through a planelet map is somewhat ambiguous, in the sense that its overall depth is inde-\nterminate. A surface represented through a surflet map is even more ambiguous, in the sense that both\nits overall depth and overall slant are indeterminate. Whatever the representation, observers will be\nable to judge other quantities, up to the ambiguities mentioned above. However, such quantities have\nFigure 2. Examples of the generic surflets. From left to right: CAP (11, \"like the outside of egg shells\"), RIDGE\n(10, \"like columns\"), SADDLE (12, \"like a horse's saddle\"), RUT (20, \"like the inside of reeds\"), and CUP\n(22, \"like the inside of egg shells\"). Ridge and rut are transitional forms that occur on the common boundaries\nof areas of saddles, and areas of cups or caps.\n191 Koenderink J, van Doorn A, Wagemans J\nto be derived from the basic representation, thus they cannot be more precisely determined than that.\nEmpirically, we know that observers are unable to judge absolute depth, but can judge relative depths\n(Koenderink & van Doorn, 1995). They can also judge surface attitude (Koenderink, van Doorn, &\nFor the sake of clarity, Figure 3 shows a one-dimensional \"image.\" The vertical direction rep-\nresents the depth domain. Although this suffices to make basic conceptual points, it fails to show\nan important complication that occurs in higher dimensional cases. Especially the two-dimensional\n(\"image\") case is important here. A planelet map does not necessarily \"mesh\" into an integral surface.\nThere exists an integratability constraint, namely the planelet map should be a gradient field, or be\n\"curl-free\" (a curl-free field has no vortices; Spivak, 1999; see Figure 4.) This can be empirically\ntested (Koenderink et al., 1992), and is one of the most important indicators for the nature of the\nrelief representation. A similar condition has to be met in the case of surflets. In the case of Euclidean\ngeometry, the surflet map has to satisfy the so-called \"Codazzi\u00adMainardi equations\" (Codazzi, 1868,\nFigure 3. In the left column we show likely relief representations: depth maps (zeroth order), planelet maps (first\norder), and surflet maps (second order). Of course, even higher order representations are possible! In the second\ncolumn we show a possible awareness, a smooth relief, based on the finite representation. In the third column we\nshow another--equally possible--interpretation. Only the absolute depth map (order 0) is fully determinate. In\nthe planelet representation (order 1) absolute depth is indeterminate, in the surflet representation (order 2) both\nabsolute depth and overall attitude are indeterminate. These are useful thought models; reality might well be a\nmixture of diverse, incomplete representations.\nFigure 4. An example of a circular string of planelets, taken from a planelet map that fails to \"mesh.\" Notice\nthat the adjacent planelets A and B are far from a coplanar condition. This happens when a planelet map is not a\ngradient field, or \"curl free.\" In such a case there does not exist an integral surface, thus not a depth map.\nLocal shape of pictorial relief 192\ncase of the geometry of pictorial space, the formal condition is slightly simpler. Details are available\nWe have investigated the meshing of observed planelet maps, and found that the integratability\ncondition is met within the empirical spread (Koenderink et al., 1992). We have also been able to show\nthat empirically planelet maps are more precise than relative depth maps (Koenderink & van Doorn,\n1995). Might surflet maps be sufficient to \"explain\" planelet maps? Yes, that is to say, up to an overall\nambiguity of spatial attitude. This is perhaps okay, since we often find idiosyncratic overall attitude\nvariations in empirical planelet maps. A formal argument in favor of a surflet representation is that\nshape is an invariant over arbitrary motions. Translation will affect location, and rotations will affect\nspatial attitude, but shapes remain unaffected. This might be an advantage where mental models are\nconcerned.\nAlthough extremely important from a conceptual perspective, it will take much effort to make\nprogress towards an answer. In this paper we only attempt a first step, in that we construct methods to\nsample surflet maps.\n1.4 Proposed method to sample surflet representations\nConsider some generic relief. An example would be the pictorial relief evoked by a photograph, draw-\ning, or painting of some articulate object, like a sculptural representation of a human torso. The exam-\nple shown in Figure 1 (right) provides an instance. In such a relief the local shape varies continuously\nfrom location to location. A point on such a surface is at some depth, the planelet at the point has some\nspatial attitude, and the surflet at the point has some shape. The shape is the local variation of the\nplanelets, the planelet the local variation of the depth. A really large neighborhood will reveal a vari-\nation of surflets, a very restricted neighborhood may show only irrelevant textural variation, thus the\nscale, that is the size of the relevant region of interest, is a crucial parameter (see Appendix).\nIn sampling a surface one uses a grid of sample points, the grid spacing setting the scale at which\nthe sampling proceeds. In a typical experiment one may consider a grid of a hundred to a thousand\npoints, thus the scale is limited to roughly a few up to 10 percent of the width of the pictorial object. Of\ncourse, here the \"sampling\" is a property of the experimental paradigm. It is quite unclear how much\nof the image is \"used\" by the observer to arrive at a \"local\" judgment. Moreover, this is not something\nthat we can ascertain from the present investigation. On the one hand, the obvious shape variations\nover the depicted object suggest that the area available for a \"measurement\" is rather limited. On the\nother hand, it is intuitively clear that observers would be at a loss when you would mask all of the\nimage except this crucial area. This is conceptually a very difficult problem. We have explained the\nformal issues in the Appendix. One finds that there is always a fairly well-defined \"footprint\" that is\nrequired, although much larger areas, perhaps even the whole image, are probably needed to provide\nthe necessary context. For instance, if the major cue is shading, the context might be the direction of\nillumination. Notice that an estimate of the direction of illumination requires an understanding of the\nshape map. Thus the issue is a very involved one. We leave it for future investigation.\nIn the simplest case one indicates a location on the relief and asks the observer to specify the\nnature of the shape of the relief in the immediate neighborhood of that location. For instance, it may be\nseen as \"convex\" (like the outside of egg shells), and so forth. In order to turn this simple task into a\nformal method of \"measurement,\" one needs to provide a formal scale. This is the nature of the method\nwe propose here.\nTechnically, one uses the ratio of extremal sectional curvatures to define a size-independent shape\nmeasure. This \"shape index\" (Koenderink, 1990; Koenderink & van Doorn, 1992) is defined on a\nclosed linear interval, with the cap and cup at its extremities, the symmetrical saddle at the center.\nThere exists a natural symmetry about the center, since shapes situated at mutually symmetric points\nare related as a plaster cast with its mold. Thus, for instance, cup and cap are related in this way,\nwhereas the symmetrical saddle is congruent to its own mold.\nAlthough this is a continuous scale, it can be coarse-grained into natural categories. This is done\nby noting the signs of the extremal curvatures. Notice that one needs some convention, say curva-\nture reckoned positive for convexity, negative for concavity. This yields the ridges and ruts as natu-\nral anchors between the center and the end-points of the scale. Then the cap\u00adridge\u00adsaddle\u00adrut\u00adcup\nsequence appears as a natural set of shape categories. It is the scale that was illustrated above in\n193 Koenderink J, van Doorn A, Wagemans J\nThis should not be interpreted such that \"ridge\" (for instance) implies that one principal curvature\nwould be identically zero. Indeed, that would make no sense, because it would indicate a singular\ncase, thus an empty category. One should understand \"ridge\" as a central item in its category. Some\nthings are perceptually more \"ridge\" than either \"cap\" or \"saddle.\" Such things are immediately obvi-\nous to the observer in the actual task, but we noticed that it leads to formal misunderstandings by col-\nleagues who merely conceptually think about, rather than perform the task.\nIn this first investigation of surflet maps, or \"shape landscapes,\" we ask observers to categorize\nlocal shape on this categorical scale. This scale is augmented with a \"flat\" category, required because\nobservers cannot always detect a curvature. Planarity is not a shape, no shape index can be assigned\nto it. It is perhaps most appropriate to say that flat is any shape you want. In formal geometry, planar\npoints occur with probability zero. However, in the case of uncertainty, there is a finite probability\nthat the curvatures are not significantly different from zero. Then it becomes meaningful to consider a\n\"flat\" category. Of course, this does not imply that \"flat\" is a proper shape (see Appendix).\nWe then study the consistency of such judgments for given observers over repeated sessions, as\nwell as the degree of agreement between observers for given locations. Both intra-observer consist-\nency and inter-observer agreement can be studied as a function of shape, for instance, by relating\nthem to the median over numerous judgments. Notice that this does not involve any notion of \"ground\ntruth.\" Thus the study is singularly limited to pictorial space.\nIn this study we use a photograph of a piece of sculpture by Andrew Smith (working as professional\nsculptor since 1989; Smith, 2014). It is simply labeled \"Reclining Nude--Portland stone\" (Figure 5).\nWe do not know the exact size of the piece, nor the lighting set-up for the photograph, distance or focal\nlength, etc. Portland stone is a limestone from the Tithonian stage of the Jurassic period quarried on the\nIsle of Portland, Dorset. It has found many uses in the UK, e.g., St Paul's Cathedral and Buckingham\nPalace are constructed from it. It is an oolitic limestone that is so well cemented that it can be readily\nworked, and is quite suited to larger pieces of sculpture. What is important here is that it has slight texture,\nsomewhat apparent in the image. Its surface scattering is diffuse, not all that different from Lambertian.\nMost of the visible relief in the photograph is revealed through conventional \"shading\" (Baxandall,\nthat the occluding contour is rather revealing. Occlusions (T-junctions--ending contour pairs) are of\nminor importance (waist, shoulders). Parts where the relief emerges from the block (legs, arm, part of\nthe thorax) are clearly marked, and not easily confused with occluding contours. A few singular curves\n(cleft between the legs, cleft between the buttocks) are easily read, and not likely to be confused with\noccluding contours either. Thus this is a very revealing photograph of a generic (Koenderink, 1990;\nPorteous, 1994; Thom, 1972), predominantly smooth relief, which renders it eminently suitable to our\npurpose.\nFigure 5. The stimulus is a photograph of a sculpture \"Reclining Nude,\" executed in Portland stone by Andrew\nSmith (http://www.assculpture.co.uk/reclining%20nude.html). The red line is a contour that defines the region of\ninterest, the yellow dots show the 600 fiducial locations used to sample apparent surface shape.\nLocal shape of pictorial relief 194\nThe piece is evidently illuminated from top right (Figures 6, 7). The (minor) cast shadows reveal\nthree rather directional sources, from only slightly different directions. Thus most of the relief can be\nregarded as being illuminated through a single, directional, effective source. There are traces from\ndiffuse reflexes (e.g., at the bottom left). Some \"shading\" is actually due to vignetting (cleft between\nthe legs, arm pit).\nThe \"reclining nude,\" predominantly female, is a conventional topic in Western art (Clark, 1956;\nRogers, 1969). Both dorsal and ventral views are common. The artistic interest is in the composition\nof overall pose and local anatomical detail. Different from common misconception, a piece like this\nis to be understood as a sophisticated abstract work. The nude is not a subject of art, but a form of art.\nAlthough major body parts can easily be named, which is quite useful in discussing the relief, this\ndoes not at all imply that one would know the relief without even looking at it. In fact, most of the\nimportant details could hardly be named by the naive observer. Who actually remembers the location,\nand shape of the infraspinatus, or teres minor and major? The anatomical knowledge of most observ-\nFigure 6. Isophotes in the photograph of the \"Reclining Nude.\" In order to find them we first established the scale\nthrough Gaussian blurring by about half the edge length of the triangulation, followed by a \"posterization,\" again\nfollowed by an \"edge finding\" operation. The whole procedure is easily finished in Photoshop. This pattern defines\nthe shading cue. One readily identifies the light direction (remember that the buttocks are almost spherical), the\ncylinder axes (legs, spinal area), and a variety of cylindrical points (most of the extrema, and all of the saddles in\nthe dorsal thorax). Also notice the effect of the cast shadow of the upper buttock on the lower leg and the reflex\nat the lower left contour.\nFigure 7. An impression of the screen layout. The \"flat\" category is added by way of a \"don't know\" escape, and\ndoes not properly belong to the shape index scale. In fact, any shape, when sufficiently attenuated will become\n\"flat.\" One might say that flat is to shape, as black is to hue. The yellow dot indicates the fiducial location that\nidentifies the trial. (For the sake of clarity, the size is enlarged in print.) The observer responds by clicking the\nappropriate category with the mouse. In this case the \"cap\" category will appear appropriate to most observers.\n195 Koenderink J, van Doorn A, Wagemans J\ners is very limited anyway, and surface articulations easily as prominent as the nose are easily missed\nby non-professionals. But notice that although most people certainly could point out a nose in a face,\nthey would be hard put to indicate its boundaries--even less so with a cheek. Such \"knowledge\" is\nvery poor indeed. Even a medical training is only of limited use, because \"artistic anatomy\" is a topic\nby itself. In artistic anatomy one routinely merges objects that would be distinct to the medical person.\nThe artistic taxonomy echoes the \"Gestalt understanding\" of the human form, not the anatomical one\nThe bottom line is that the relief is largely an abstract entity to most observers. One is aware of\nan array of mutually interconnected \"objects\" that have a fleeting existence and constantly reorganize\nduring continued scrutiny. Their lifetime is only a moment of visual awareness.\n(LCD) screen, in a darkened room. The viewing distance was 78 cm. The stimulus filled the width of\nthe screen. Above and below were free areas used for user interaction. In the upper area were placed a\nprogress bar, a record of time spent in the session, and an analog clock showing time of day. The lower\narea was used for the actual user interface (see Figure 7).\nIn all cases, viewing was binocular, using open view, possibly using one's regular correction.\nInteraction was by way of the mouse (see below). At each trial a mark (a filled dot) indicated a fiducial\nlocation, and the observer had to judge the local shape by clicking one of the categories presented just\nbelow the picture (Figure 7). Observers were instructed to approach the task very seriously and use all\nthe time they needed to do that. Responses were collected as XML files and processed later, off-line.\nWe recorded both response times and actual responses, although the response time data were hardly\nused. Trial sequence was randomized in all cases.\nWe used two distinct groups of observers. The first group of 10 observers was fully naive with respect\nto the aim of the experiment. Both genders were present in roughly equal proportions, all were aged\nin their 20s to 30s. Most had prior experience with various types of visual experiments. Each of these\nobservers performed a single session. The second group of observers were the authors AD (female, in\nthe 60s), JK (male, in the 70s), and JW (male, in the 50s). All are experienced with various psycho-\nphysical procedures, but effectively naive in the present task. They have some basic understanding\nof geometry, and of artistic vision, but are not active as mathematicians, nor as visual artists. Each\nrepeated the session three times, at different dates. We discuss these groups separately, since different\nmethods of analysis apply.\nThe first group comprises 10 observers. Our first concern is to check to what degree they yield mu-\ntually similar results, and whether it is possible to detect obvious outliers from a global perspective.\nA first global check is to consider the response times. Although observers were instructed to go at\ntheir own speed, the duration of the session was long enough that they no doubt tried to economize.\nWe find that the median response times vary from 2.1 to 3.7 s, with an interquartile range (i.q.r.)\nof 0.38 s. The interquartile ranges of all observers overlap, thus in that sense there are no obvious\noutliers.\nAnother global check is to consider the distribution over the categories over all locations. Here\nwe find obvious differences (Figure 8). There can be little doubt that there exist very significant inter-\nobserver differences.\nOf course, the distribution over locations is crucial. As a first check one may consider whether\nresponses are consistent per location. A simple way to do this is to compare observers pairwise. For a\ngiven pair we consider only instances where both observers did not report \"flat.\" Since the responses\nare labeled by location, we may then simply consider a rank order correlation. We used the Kendall\ntau. It turns out that the observers correlate very significantly. The Kendall tau has a standard deviation\nthe distribution over all pairs (Figure 9) reveals one observer as an obvious outlier. It is observer #10,\nthe one that is at the bottom of the sorted list shown in Figure 8.\nLocal shape of pictorial relief 196\nFigure 8. At left the distribution of the responses over the categories is shown for the first group of observers.\nObservers #1\u00ad #10 have been sorted by increasing fraction of \"flat responses.\" Here, as in all subsequent figures,\nwe use the canonical color code shown at right for the shape categories (Koenderink & van Doorn, 1992): red--\ncup, yellow--ridge, white--saddle, blue--rut, green--cup. We have indicated the flat category with black, which\nis colorless, thus indicating the lack of shape. Notice that opponent hues are used to encode opposite (as shape and\nmold) shapes, this is why the saddle is shown as white.\nFigure 9. Here we consider the rank correlations (Kendall's tau) for all pairs of observers. The colors indicate:\norange: within the interquartile interval; red: above the 0.75 quartile; blue: below the 0.25 quartile. Notice that\nobserver #10 is an obvious outlier.\n197 Koenderink J, van Doorn A, Wagemans J\nAlthough it is clear that observer #10 is an outlier and perhaps should be ignored when consider-\ning overall trends, it is of obvious interest to see in which respects this observer differs from the others.\nIn order to find out, we need to consider the actual spatial distribution of responses. First, we study\nthe overall consensus for all observers except #10 (Figure 10). The concordance is quite good; it is the\nleast in the area of the back above the waist, with the exception of the spinal rut.\nIn comparison, the distribution for observer #10 is quite exceptional (Figure 11). This observer\nrates about 40 percent of the area as flat, and most of the remainder as ridge. A few cups and caps\nappear randomly scattered. A saddle area seems somewhat coherent, but apparently coincides with the\npoints that the other observers frequently rated as \"rut.\" We conclude that this observer is hardly aware\nof a consistent pictorial relief at all. One might say that this observer experiences the stimulus largely\nveridically, that is to say, as a flat picture. This is the reason to omit the data of observer #10 from our\noverall assessment.\nFigure 10. At top we show the consensus (by majority vote) for observers #1\u00ad#9, using the color code as in\nfigure 8. At the bottom we show the distribution of mutual concordance, normalized on the temperature scale from\nblue (least) to red (best), shown at right.\nFigure 11. The distribution of shape responses for observer #10. Notice that much of the area is judged flat, most\nof the remainder as convex cylindrical (ridge).\nLocal shape of pictorial relief 198\nIn Figure 12 we plot the distribution of \"flat\" responses, averaged over the nine remaining observ-\ners. One notices an obvious pattern: the shape is well defined in the buttocks, spinal, and exposed\nshoulder areas; it is ill defined in the waist and the scapular areas.\nApart from the distribution of responses over locations, it is of much interest to study the dis-\ntribution of responses over the categories. We summarize our findings in Figures 13 and 14. These\nfigures are based on the pooled responses of observers #1\u00ad #9.\nThere are a few difficulties that need to be overcome in this study. A trivial, but serious problem\nis the very unequal distribution over the responded categories. Consider the pie-chart (over observers\n#1\u00ad #9) shown in Figure 13. This problem is most readily solved by normalizing over this unequal\ndistribution. The only drawback is that the distribution for the cups will be far less precise than that\nover the ridges, and so forth. This is not too problematic. Below we will point it out where necessary.\nMore of a conceptual problem is that there does not exist anything like a notion of \"ground truth.\"\nThe only solution appears to be to study the distribution of responses factored with respect to the aver-\nage, or median response per location. We use the median for reasons of robustness. We obtain a set\nof responses for each median response; each set is normalized. The result is the distribution shown\nin Figure 14. The distribution is roughly concentrated about the main diagonal--such would be the\n\"ideal\" result--but there is a marked dispersion, especially in the saddle region.\nFigure 12.

Pie chart of the distribution of categorical responses pooled over observers #1\u00ad #9 of group one.\n199 Koenderink J, van Doorn A, Wagemans J\nFrom Figure 14 we conclude that observers are not able to use the categorical scale with ultimate\nprecision. They are quite precise in the cap (i.q.r.: 0.65 of 5), ridge (i.q.r.: 0.66), and rut (i.q.r.: 0.98)\nregions, but more variable in the saddle region (i.q.r.: 1.68). Because of the scarcity of instances we\nleave the cup region (i.q.r.: 2.01, but very variable) out of this discussion. An overall conclusion might\nbe that observers are quite variable in the saddle region, where the uncertainty amounts to almost half\nthe total scale (40%).\nThe second group of observers consisted of the authors. They did the full session three times, on differ-\nent dates. Thus we gain the advantage of looking at intra-observer variations. As a first overall check\nwe ran the same analysis as for the first group on all sessions, thus treating the repeated sessions as due\nto different persons. We find results that do not appear to differ from those of group one. A first look\nat the data involves the spatial distribution of categorical responses over all observers and all sessions.\nIt is presented in Figure 15.\nIn Figure 15 we spot both obvious differences as well as obvious similarities. These are per-\nhaps more easily studied in the overall consensus, and the distribution of mutual correspondences\nIn Figure 16 we see that the consensus and mutual concordance are quite similar to those of the\ngroup of fully naive observers. Apparently these groups are largely comparable. The median rank\ncorrelations over the three sessions of an observer are 0.78 (AD), 0.81 (JK), and 0.77 (JW). Over all\nobservers and all sessions the median rank correlation is 0.65 (i.q.r.: 0.60\u00ad0.73), thus the repeated\nsessions per observer are more similar than the observers are like each other. Apparently there exist\nFigure 14. The distribution of responses over categories, as a function of the median category response. These\nare the pooled results for the observers #1\u00ad#9. The distributions have been normalized per median category,\nthat is to say, column wise. This normalization serves to remove the effect of the (very) different frequency of\nthe categorical responses. The extremes are the 2,211 ridge versus the 10 cup responses. We omitted the flat\nresponses. The colors are from a temperature scale, from blue (low density) to red (high density), as in figure 10.\nThe red dots indicate the medians, the gray bars the interquartile ranges, of the distribution over a column. The cup\ncategory is based on so few instances that one should perhaps not attach too much importance on it. The width of\nthe distribution at the saddle category is significantly larger than that of its ridge and rut neighbors.\nLocal shape of pictorial relief 200\nFigure 15.

Perhaps not unexpectedly, the observers of group two are--as a group--more\ncoherent than those of group one. This induced us to do the final analysis we did for group one once\nover again, but only for the sessions of a single observer (necessarily of group two). The result is\nThe result is striking to the extent that the observers of group two manage to retain their categori-\ncal judgments over time. The only exceptions are near the cups-extreme, where the data are rather\nuncertain. Apparently categorical judgments of shape are possible, although there is only moderate\nconsensus (median rank correlation: 0.65) over observers.\n201 Koenderink J, van Doorn A, Wagemans J\n4 Conclusions\nGiven the wide-ranging scope of the problem our conclusions must necessarily be of a preliminary\nnature. However, given the fact that essentially no quantitative researches have been published thus\nfar, we trust that they are of some interest.\nPerhaps the major drawback of this study is the fact that we used only a single stimulus. For a\nproblem like this there is no \"ground truth,\" thus, in the conventional sense, \"no stimulus\" at all. A\ncounter-measure might be to use a large set of mutually very different pictures. We have not done this,\nbut consider it still reasonable to draw a few interesting preliminary conclusions.\nWe find that observers will readily judge the local shape of a pictorial relief on a five-point cat-\negorical shape index scale (see below), needing only a second or so for a \"good look,\" and with a\nspatial resolution that is at least some five percent of the picture width. At least, this holds true for our\nstimulus, where the major cues to pictorial shape are contour and shading, and the rough overall nature\nof the pictorial object is not in question.\nNotice that we do not count \"flat\" as a category here. From a formal, geometrical point of view\nflat points may be ignored, because they do not generically occur on unconstrained surfaces. From an\nempirical point of view one expects any of the categories to evoke \"flat\" responses when the curva-\ntures are subliminal for an observer. Thus \"flat\" is not a true category of shape, but is defined through\na quantitative criterion. Flat is related to the shape-scale in a similar way as black is related to the\nhue-scale. In a study like this one might perhaps use the flat responses to gain some insight into the\nthreshold for curvedness. Due to the scarcity of instances we have refrained from doing so.\nThe \"precision\" of the shape inferences is hard to describe. We draw the tentative conclusion\nthat good observers can resolve the five-point categorical shape index scale easily, but that different\nobservers may well disagree by up to about half of the total scale extent. This implies a number of\nrather important conceptual issues.\nOne issue is that it makes hardly any sense to average over observers. Such averages may indeed\nyield a population measure, but it severely misrepresents the abilities of individuals. Averages are per-\nhaps of interest for industry or government work, but rather less so to vision science.\nAnother issue is that \"the\" category at which one defines the spread is already a non-entity in the\nsense that it does not exist as an objective stimulus parameter. In this type of \"experimental phenom-\nenology\" one has no option but to study the nature of the response in terms of properties of itself. This\nmakes sense, because phenomenological research addresses the internal relations between aspects of\nawareness, rather than the relation of aspects of awareness to given objective stimulus parameters. The\nadvantage is that experimental phenomenology addresses qualities and meanings, whereas psycho-\nmetric studies cannot go beyond objective--thus experientially devoid of meaning and quality--prop-\nerties. Both approaches are necessary and important, albeit in mutually complementary ways.\nA single observer is able to use the five-point shape index scale reliably over extended periods\n(days). We find this not too surprising, because the scale is a natural one, based on the sign of sectional\ncurvature. All one needs to be able to do is to judge convexity/concavity in a few directions. It is hard\nto image that one would not be able to do this, except when the local relief appeared flat, as it occasion-\nFigure 17. The distribution of responses over categories, as a function of the median category response for the\nsessions of each observer of group two (compare with Figure 14).\nLocal shape of pictorial relief 202\nally does. Seeing curvature intuitively implies seeing its sign, an intuition that is by no means conclu-\nsive. Thus, seeing something as curved (or \"non-flat\") seems to imply that one will be able to use the\nscale. On the other hand, the ability to interpolate the scale would involve abilities of a quantitative\nnature, such as the ability to judge the foreshortening with respect to both direction and magnitude.\nThis puts the continuous shape-index scale in an entirely different ball park.\nWhy are observers so obviously different? The issue may well be the absence of a proper \"physi-\ncal cause\" of the awareness. For if all observers strive to attain a common physical target one indeed\nexpects them to become similar. For instance, if all observers are instructed to shoot at the same\nphysical target in front of them, for \"target practice,\" one would be surprised to find major systematic\nmisses. The case of pictures is very different. Leonardo saw medieval battles in a dirty old wall, but\nwhat would a modern observer see in the same situation? It could be virtually anything, but a medieval\nbattle scene would be highly unlikely.\nA conclusion from the previous observation might well be that it will be of much interest to vary\nthe cue-content of the stimulus pictures parametrically in this task. Thus the method may well become\na tool to study pictorial perception per se.\nWhat about observer #10 of group one, the obvious outlier? What seems to be the case here is that\nthis observer did not experience pictorial relief, but experienced the screen of the monitor much like\nit was, which is flat. The observer apparently did not look into, but at the screen. Of course, it will be\nvery hard to make such a guess objective. One method to do so is to test the person with a battery of\nmethods and pictures, which would imply a major undertaking. Such an effort may become worth it\nwhen one had a sizable group, say at least half a dozen, of such observers. We believe it very likely\nthat human observers that lack the usual \"pictorial mode\" exist (Koenderink et al., 2011). In fact, we\nbelieve to have met quite a few of them as \"outliers\" in a variety of experiments over the years. One\nencounters them not just among naive observers, but also among vision scientists. In the latter case one\nmay discuss the nature of their awareness with the observers. We have met with a variety of interesting\ncases, like inability to become visually aware--as different from reasoning out--of concavities (van\nDoorn, Koenderink, Todd, & Wagemans, 2012).\nAs we mentioned in the introduction, in 1436 Alberti came up with a taxonomy of local surface\nshapes that was complete except for the omission of saddles. Moreover, it took till the work of Gauss\n(of 1827!) before this omission was amended. How was this possible? After all, most of the comments\non Alberti stem from visual artists, or intellectuals interested in the visual arts. How come no one\nnoticed the omission a century before Gauss? Our study fails to yield a complete answer. We find that\nour observers readily categorize local surface shapes as belonging to the saddle category. Moreover,\nindividual observers do not fluctuate in their response to saddles over time. However, when one com-\npares a group of observers, one finds that the responses fluctuate much more heavily near the saddle\ncategory than in other parts of the scale. Apparently there is something special the case with the saddle\ncategory. It is unlikely to be a prior, because saddles are actually more frequent in nature than caps or\nIn summary, human observers readily categorize local pictorial relief in terms of cap, ridge, sad-\ndle, rut, cup, and flat categories. They do this consistently, but the inter-observer variability is very\nsignificant. Although all observers globally \"see the same object,\" there are considerable differences\nin detail.\n"
