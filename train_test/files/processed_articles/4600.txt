Chatters2\n Keywords\ncyberbullying, college, undergraduates, bullying\nCyberbullying has been extensively studied among pre-\nadolescent and adolescent populations in secondary\neducation (Berson, Berson, & Ferron, 2002; Smith & Yoon,\nand characteristics of this phenomenon among college\nstudent populations are largely unknown (Smith & Yoon,\nCyberbullying victimization online has gradually\nbecome a focus of concern due to reported incidents of\nsuicide linked to bullying online (El-Ghobashy, 2010;\nSchwartz, 2010), the White House Summit on Bullying's\nconcerns about cyberbullying in college (White House,\n2011), and recent publications reporting college students\nbeing targets of online smear campaigns that included\nracist, sexist, homophobic remarks, or threats of physical\nHigh school and college students continue to be the\npopulation that utilizes the Internet and social media most\noften including email, cell phones, instant messaging, and\nchat rooms (Boyd, 2008; Bryant, Sanders-Jackson, &\nattending college and 90% reported being members of\nsocial media websites (Duggan & Brenner, 2013; Lampe,\nEllison, & Steinfield, 2006). This extensive use of\ntechnology and social outlets provides useful media for\nbullying to take place (Gilroy, 2013; Mishna, Cook,\nDespite national attention, reported cases, and access\nto media, there has been minimal research on\ncyberbullying among college students. A recent search\nconducted by the authors using Academic Search\nPremier, JSTOR, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, and Web of\nScience found very few studies regarding cyberbullying\nin college. Furthermore, these studies provided no\nimplications for college counselors preparing for,\nresponding to, or providing education on the topic of\ncyberbullying in post-secondary settings. In addition,\nthere were no studies on the continuation of\ncyberbullying from high school to college.\nCyberbullying\nDue to the recency of cyberbullying, there is a lack of\nconsensus about definition of terms (Kowalski, Limber, &\nAgatston, 2008). Indeed, the need for an integrative\ndefinition of cyberbullying is crucial for both conceptual\nand operational clarity. For the purposes of this study, the\nfollowing definitions were used: Cyberbullying is any\nbehavior performed through electronic or digital media by\nindividuals or groups who repeatedly communicate hostile\nor aggressive messages intended to inflict harm or\nA cyberbully is a person who uses electronic means to\nintentionally harass others. A victim of cyberbullying is a\nperson who has experienced harassment or threats through\nelectronic means (Hinduja & Patchin, 2008).\nCyberbullying manifests through four primary forms:\nchat rooms, instant messaging, emails, and text messaging\n2004). Lack of supervision and the anonymity provided by\nthese electronic forms makes it easy to be both a cyberbully\nand a victim (Diamanduros et al., 2008).\n1University of South Florida, Tampa, USA\n2Pennsylvania State University, State College, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nSeriaShia J. Chatters, Pennsylvania State University, 125 CEDAR,\nEmail: sjc25@psu.edu\nsgo.sagepub.com\n2 SAGE Open\nCyberbullying Among College Populations\nCyberbullying among K-12 populations has been reported\n2007). There are a variety of research studies conducted on\ncyberbullying that focus on K-12 student populations,\nfocused primarily on pre-adolescents and adolescents\ndemonstrated a decrease in bullying overall from\nelementary to secondary school, a finding that suggest\nfurther decreases in bullying from secondary school to\ncollege. One of the few studies reviewing the frequency,\ncharacteristics, and psychological effects of cyberbullying\non college populations found a positive correlation between\nbeing a bully in elementary school, high school, and college\nmore than 40% of participants who reported being either\nbullies or victims of bullies in elementary school and high\nschool, continued to maintain this role in college. In\naddition, research regarding bullying in the workplace\nfound that adults who had been bullies in childhood had the\npotential to be bullies in the workplace as well (Harvey,\nHeames, Richey, & Leonard, 2006). These findings suggest\nsome stability of the bullying role and its presence in\nadulthood.\nAccording to the few research studies available to date,\nthe prevalence of cyberbullying among college populations\nthe 339 college students surveyed reported experiencing\ncyberbullying via instant messaging. The study did not\nexplore diversity of the sample. A study conducted in\nand found that about 22% reported experiencing\ncyberbullying. This study highlighted the prevalence of\ncyberbullying in college on an international level. Zacchilli\nand Valerio (2011) conducted two studies on college\nsurveyed 76 freshmen and 34 seniors. The results of Study\n1 indicated that less than 1% of the students reported\nexperiencing cyberbullying. In Study 2, about 9% of the\nsample reported being a victim of cyberbullying, whereas\n3.6% reported being a cyberbully. MacDonald and Roberts-\nthat 21% of the sample reported being cyberbullied, 38%\nreported knowing someone who had been cyberbullied, and\n8% reported cyberbullying someone. Reported frequencies\nof cyberbullying were partitioned from the overall data set\nfocused on traditional bullying behaviors. Walker,\nstudents surveyed had experienced cyberbullying with more\nthan 40% knowing someone who had been cyberbullied.\nFinally, a recent study by Smith and Yoon (2013)\nrandomly chosen emails. About 10% of the respondents\nreported being cyberbullied in college and 25% reported\nobserving another student being cyberbullied. The small\nnumber of returned responses limited the significance of\nthis study.\nThe variations in sample size, methodologies, and\nfindings among the limited research available suggests a\nneed for additional studies reporting on the frequency and\ncharacteristics of cyberbullying among college students\nEmotional and Psychological Impact of Cyberbullying\nThe psychological effects of cyberbullying seem to cause\nequal or more emotional damage than traditional bullying\ndue to the wider audience and impact of the Internet\nNakamoto and Schwartz (2009) revealed a significant\nnegative association between peer victimization and\nacademic achievement in high school students, as measured\nby grades, student achievement scores, or teacher ratings of\nacademic achievement. Additional studies indicate that\nbullied and cyberbullied children and adolescents more\nfrequently than their peers want to avoid attending school,\nhave issues with substance abuse, delinquency, depression,\nand receive poorer grades similar to their cyberbully-victim\npeers (Eisenberg, Neumark-Sztainer, & Perry, 2003;\nKowalski & Limber, 2013; Mitchell, Ybarra, & Finkelhor,\nGender, Ethnicity, and Cyberbullying\nResearch has found a lack of consensus regarding gender\ndifferences in cyberbullying victimization in middle and\nhigh school. Some studies reported an equal amount of\ncyberbullying experienced by males and females (Hinduja\ngirls more likely to be victims of cyberbullying, whereas a\nTurkish study found boys to be the victims of\ncyberbullying more often (Aricak et al., 2008; Smith et al.,\nIannotti, & Nansel, 2009). Similarly, there are\ncontroversial findings regarding gender differences for the\nethnicity on cyberbullying experiences of victims and\nbullies were also found to be contradictory. A survey\nstudy on a college sample found that 60% of victims and\nstudy comparing Chinese and Canadian students found the\nformer reported higher instances of being the victims of\ncyberbullying while the latter reported more instances of\nbeing the perpetrator of cyberbullying (Li, 2008). In spite\nof their limitations and variations in outcome, these\nstudies identified the presence of cyberbullying in college\nand denoted a need for further research.\nZalaquett and Chatters 3\nThe Present Study\nThe purpose of this study is to contribute to the current\nknowledge base by investigating the prevalence of\ncyberbullying in a large sample of college students from\ndiverse backgrounds and to determine the relationship\nbetween cyberbullying in high school and college. Given\nthe potential presence and impact of cyberbullying, the\nexploration of students' attitudes toward cyberbullying\nprevention training was included. The study addressed the\nfollowing research questions:\nResearch Question 1: To what extent do college\nstudents experience cyberbullying?\nResearch Question 2: To what extent were victims of\ncyberbullying during high school also victims during\ncollege?\nResearch Question 3: To what extent were victims also\nbullies?\nResearch Question 4: Are there differences in the\nfrequency of cyberbullying based on gender, age, race\nand ethnicity, and frequency of time on electronic\nmediums?\nResearch Question 5: Via which mediums did\ncyberbullying occur the most and by who?\nResearch Question 6: What are the direct psychological\neffects and actions taken following cyberbullying?\nResearch Question 7: To what extent would college\nstudents favor education on cyberbullying?\nMethod\nContext and Participants\nSimilar to other studies, this research used survey data from\na convenience sample of university students from a large,\nurban, southeastern university (Hustinx, Meijs, Handy, &\napproved by the university's Institutional Review Board,\nincluded only students who were currently enrolled.\ncompleted surveys out of 613 were used in the study.\nDemographics of the respondents were as follows: 459\n(6 did not report their ethnicity); between the ages of 21 and\nResearch Procedures\nSurveys were distributed in seven undergraduate courses\naccepted by most colleges' programs as part of their general\ncurriculum. After receiving consent from each instructor, a\nmember of the research team visited each classroom, read\nthe participant's informed consent form, and distributed the\nsurveys. The surveys were distributed at the beginning of\neach class included a copy of the informed consent form.\nStudents were informed that participation in the study was\noptional and anonymous. Participants did not receive any\nrewards for participation in the study. Research team\nmembers did not report any incidences of participants\ndeclining to participate, thus reducing the possibility of\nrespondent self-selection (Hustinx et al., 2012). Completed\nsurveys were collected for data analysis.\nMeasures\nThe College Cyberbullying Survey consisted of 23\nquestions developed for the purposes of this study. Two\nsenior faculty experts in adolescent behavior in schools and\ncollege reviewed and approved the questionnaire. The\nsurvey was separated into two sections including\ndemographic information and questions regarding\ncyberbullying experiences. The following independent\nvariables were included in the first section of the\nquestionnaire to explain possible differences in\ncyberbullying experiences: gender, ethnicity, grade point\naverage, membership to social networks, and chat room use.\nSection 2 of the questionnaire consisted of 14 questions that\ninquired about cyberbullying experiences such as number of\ntimes cyberbullying was experienced in high school,\nnumber of times cyberbullying was experienced in college,\nsource of cyberbullying, whether they participated in\ncyberbullying, and the electronic mediums used by\ncyberbullies to harass victims. Individuals interested in\nobtaining a copy of the survey may contact the authors.\nAnalysis\nA series of Pearson's chi-square tests were used to analyze\nthe data. This statistics was used due to the nominal nature\nof the data and to investigate any possible relationships\namong the variables. Lebanon (2009) indicates, \"Pearson's\nChi-Square is generally considered the standard method for\nthe multinomial case and is often more accurate than the\nalternatives\" (p. 1).\nResults\nAfter an analysis of the data regarding each research\nquestion, some relations were determined and are indicated\nbelow.\nResearch Question 1: To What Extent Do College\nStudents Experience Cyberbullying?\nAnalysis of the data collected indicated that 31.3% (n =\n189) of the respondents were victims of cyberbullying\nduring high school and 19% (n = 115) were victims during\n4 SAGE Open\ncollege. Cyberbullying experiences of college students\nranged from 0 to 10+ times during high school with 24% (n\nexperiences of the college students currently ranged from 0\n10+ times. In addition, 28% of these participants reported\nhaving a friend who had currently experienced\ncyberbullying. These results indicate a significant number\nof college students who have been affected directly by\ncyberbullying or know someone who has.\nOf the 19% of college cyberbully victims, 30% reported\nthat the reported cyberbullying was based on sexuality, 10%\nreported it was based on race/ethnicity, 8% reported it was\nbased on gender, and 62% placed the type of cyberbullying\nthat took place under the \"Other\" category.\nResearch Question 2: To What Extent Were Victims\nof Cyberbullying During High School Also Victims\nDuring College?\nA statistically significant association was found between\ncyberbullying in high school and cyberbullying in college\nof the victims of cyberbullying in college also experiencing\ncyberbullying in high school, which accounted for\napproximately 15% of the total sample.\nResearch Question 3: To What Extent Were Victims\nof Cyberbullying Also Cyberbullies?\nApproximately 5% (n = 33) of the total sample reported\nbeing a cyberbully in college and 40% of this subsample\nreported being victims of cyberbullying as well.\nApproximately 3% of the subsample of participants who\nreported being victims of cyberbullying in college reported\nbeing cyberbullies as well.\nResearch Question 4: Are There Differences in the\nFrequency of Cyberbullying Based on Gender, Age,\nEthnicity, and Frequency of Time on Electronic\nMediums?\nGender. Cyberbullying in college differed by gender, 15.5% of\nthe females surveyed reported being cyberbullied compared\nwith 3.6% of the males surveyed. Although there were 3 times\nmore females in the sample as males, the frequency of\ncyberbullying in the female populations remained\ndisproportionately high, with cyberbullying in college being\nreported 5 times more by females in the sample.\nAge. An analysis of the sample that experienced\ncyberbullying in college only found that 58% (n = 76) of\nthe participants who reported being cyberbullied in college\nReported frequencies demonstrate that, in this study,\nmore likely to report cyberbullying than participants 30 and\nover.\nEthnicity. Approximately 56% (n = 74) of the participants\nwho reported being cyberbullied in college were European\nAmerican or Other. To account for the disproportionate\nnumber of European American participants, a Pearson chi-\nsquare analysis was conducted using frequency of\ncyberbullying experienced in college and ethnicity.\nAnalysis indicated that Asian Americans experienced\ncyberbullying 4 times or more (32%; n = 8) more frequently\nthan African American (18%), Hispanic American (18%),\nor European American (15%).\nFrequency of time on electronic medium. Past research has\nlinked the amount of time spent on the computer to an\nincreased risk of experiencing cyberbullying. An analysis of\nfrequency of cyberbullying experiences and computer use\nfound no significant relationship between these variables in\nthis study. This outcome may be due to the majority of the\nparticipants spending significant computer use and high\nmembership in social networks, creating a ceiling effect.\nSimilarly, increases in reported computer proficiency did\nnot indicate an increase in reports of cyberbullying in\ncollege. Again, this outcome can be related to the high\nskills level observed in this study, with 51% of the total\nsample reporting having advanced skills using computers.\nThe frequency of time on the computer reported by\nparticipants experiencing cyberbullying in college ranged\nfrom 1 to 7+ hr daily, with 45% of respondents reporting 3\nIn addition, 93% of participants belonged to some form\nof social network, with around 70% belonging to two or\nmore social website. In spite of these social websites being\nan environment in which cyberbullying may take place,\nthere was no evidence that belonging to a social network\nincreased incidence of cyberbullying.\nResearch Question 5: Which Mediums Did\nCyberbullying Occur the Most and by Who?\nApproximately 46.1% of the victims reported text\nmessaging as the most frequent medium for cyberbullying,\nAlso, 44% of students cyberbullied in college reported\nbeing bullied by a fellow student, 42% reported being\ncyberbullied by friends, 22.6% by a boyfriend or girlfriend,\n22.6% by someone unknown to them, and 5.3% reported\nbeing cyberbullied by a co-worker. It is important to note\nZalaquett and Chatters 5\nthat 40.4% of the victims indicated they were cyberbullied\nby multiple sources involving various combinations of the\nabovementioned sources of cyberbullying.\nResearch Question 6: What Was the Direct\nPsychological Effect and Action Taken Following\nCyberbullying?\nCyberbullying seemed to have several direct psychological\neffects in this sample. Approximately 45% of the\nparticipants who reported experiencing cyberbullying\nreported feeling angry, 41% felt sad, 32% reported\nexperiencing an increase in stress, and 9% reported\nexperiencing a loss of productivity. Only 6% reported\nexperiencing no effects.\nResearch Question 7: To What Extent Would College\nStudents Favor Education on Cyberbullying?\nApproximately 77% of the total sample favored education\non cyberbullying, which indicates participants feel there is a\nneed for more education on this type of bullying. In\nindicated they had given their phone number to someone\nunknown over the Internet, which denotes a need for more\neducation regarding Internet safety.\nDiscussion\nThis study provides further evidence that cyberbullying is a\nphenomenon observed beyond K-12 school settings.\nAlthough there is an observed decrease in the number of\ncyberbully victims from high school to college,\napproximately 19% of college students reported being a\nvictim of cyberbullying. This prevalence of cyberbullying\nin college is similar to and in some cases higher than\npreviously reported rates of cyberbullying in high school\nand college (Finn, 2004; MacDonald & Roberts-Pittman,\nwho reported being victims of cyberbullying in the current\nstudy also reported experiencing cyberbullying in high\nschool. The evidence indicates that cyberbullying continues\nfrom high school to college.\nApproximately 5% of the college students participating\nin this study self-identified as cyberbullies. Past research in\nhigh school students has reported approximately 15% of\ntheir samples as self-identified cyberbullies (Aricak et al.,\nresult of the increased age and maturity of the participants\nor a decrease in the number of participants willing to admit\nthey have participated in cyberbullying. Also, knowledge of\nthe negative social perception of cyberbullies may impact\nparticipants' willingness to report cyberbullying activities.\nTogether, this data suggest that cyberbullying is a\nsignificant issue among college students with the potential\nto affect their psychological well-being and mental health.\nPsychological Impact\nAlthough the participants of this study may be more\nemotionally mature than high school victims of cyberbullying,\ncollege victims still reported significant psychological effects\nof cyberbullying. College students indicated cyberbullying\nmade them sad, angry or upset, and caused an increase in stress\nindicating the psychological impact of cyberbullying does not\ndissipate as the victim matures. These findings confirm results\nfrom previous studies, which indicate cyberbullying can be a\ncatalyst for impaired mental health, psychological distress,\nprovokes fear, and in extreme cases increases risk factors\nassociated with suicide among college populations (Dilmac,\nDifferences in Gender, Ethnicity, and Age\nDifferent than previous research (Walker et al., 2011),\nfemales were the primary victims in this study. The\nfrequency of cyberbullying experiences differed among\nethnic groups. Similar to previous research (Goebert, Else,\nMatsu, Chung-Do, & Chang, 2011), a higher percentage of\nparticipants, who identified as Asian American or Other\nreported higher frequencies of cyberbullying than any other\nethnic group. The difference in reported incidences of\ncyberbullying among ethnic groups was troubling, but not\nsurprising. Research conducted among high school\npopulations have found cyberbullying to be more prevalent\namong multiethnic populations and to have a significant\nimpact on the well-being and self-esteem of Asian\nAmerican and Pacific Islander youth (Goebert et al., 2011).\nRegarding cyberbullying and age, the results of this\nstudy showed that college students between the ages of 20\nand 25 were more likely to report cyberbullying than\ncollege students 30 years of age and older.\nSources and Mediums of Cyberbullying\nA significant percentage of participants (40%) in this study\nreported experiencing cyberbullying from multiple known\nsources from inside or outside college, including friends,\nsignificant others, and/or co-workers. The primary\nelectronic medium was cell phone\u00adbased texting. Few\nparticipants used chat rooms, which were frequently\nmentioned in previous studies.\nEducation on Cyberbullying\nA majority of the respondents in this study favor education\non cyberbullying. These findings are similar to a recent\n6 SAGE Open\nstudy conducted by Molluzzo and Lawler (2012) in which\nmore than 80% of the study participants favored further\neducation on online harassment.\nThe results of this study highlight the reported\nfrequency, characteristics, and psychological impact of\ncyberbullying in a large and diverse sample of college\nstudents. These findings were similar to the findings of\nprevious research in some areas; however, the discrepancies\nindicate the importance of conducting research solely\nfocused on the phenomenon of cyberbullying, as suggested\nby MacDonald and Roberts-Pittman (2010). Also,\nlongitudinal studies are needed to illustrate psychological\nimpact and the possibility of the delayed effects on\nacademic achievement over time. The increase in college\nstudents' use of many electronic mediums during their\neducation and the evidence of cyberbullying behavior\noccurring in college via these mediums highlights the\nimportance of educating this population on the prevalence\nand impact of aggressive electronic communication and the\npotential dangers of cyberbullying.\nStrengths and Limitations of the Research\nStrengths of this study include its specific focus on\ncyberbullying, large and diverse sample, and high response\nrate. The study also expanded the research knowledge\nregarding the relationship between frequency of\ncyberbullying and age, and the continuity of cyberbullying\nexperiences from high school to college.\nAmong the limitations of this study is the potential lack\nof knowledge about cyberbullying among college students,\nwhich may result in misinterpretation of these behavior and\nsubsequent low numbers of reported incidents. Also, many\nstudents reported that they had been bullied in high school\nbut not in college; however, they reported the effects of\ncyberbullying from both high school and college. Their\nresponses may indicate that the students did not report the\ncyberbullying but did report its consequences. Also, the\nstudy uses a measure created by the authors. Future\nresearch may develop a standardized measure of the\nprevalence of cyberbullying. In addition, it is important to\nnote that the study was conducted on a convenience sample\nat one institution. Random sampling of college students\nfrom multiple institutions may be used to gain further\nunderstanding of this phenomenon in college students\nacross the nation.\nImplications for Future Research and\nPractice\nCyberbullying represent an aggressive form of\ncommunication that utilizes electronic medium and provoke\nnegative mental health consequences. Zacchilli and Valerio\n(2011) indicated a need for further research investigating\nthe emotional impact of cyberbullying on college\npopulations. Cyberbullying seemed to be most prevalent\namong Asian Americans in this sample, but this finding\nalso varies across studies. Clearly, further research within\nthe area of ethnicity and the prevalence of cyberbullying\nseems necessary due to variability in findings (Lindsay &\nKrysik, 2012). Similarly, variations in the relationship\nbetween cyberbullying and age have been observed across\nHenrich, & Meyers, 2009; Wolak, Mitchell, & Finkelhor,\nresearch findings indicate a need for further research to\ndetermine the nature of the relationship between age and\ncyberbullying. In addition, research regarding the\nrelationship of cyberbullying, mental health, and academic\nachievement should be pursued to clarify possible\ndifferences among racial and cultural groups in college. It is\nimportant for future research to take place to further\nunderstand this phenomenon in college, determine effective\nways to promote awareness of cyberbullying, and inform\ncollege students about how to deal with this form of\nbullying and its harmful effects.\nPractical Implications\nIn an effort to prevent the transition of cyberbullying from\nK-12 settings to college, colleges and universities must\nimplement programmatic changes to advocate for\nawareness of this phenomenon. The results of this study\nindicate that 75% of the college students sampled favor\neducation on this topic. Student affairs personnel could\ncollaborate with high school counselors to incorporate\ninformation on the existence of cyberbullying in college\nsettings into campus visits and new student orientation\nsessions. Due to the negative consequences of this\nphenomenon, which in extreme cases can result in suicide,\ncampus counseling centers should provide workshops to\neducate students about the psychological impact of\ncyberbullying. In addition, individual and group sessions\nmay help victims and cyberbullies improve self-esteem and\ndevelop healthier ways to communicate and respond to\nonline victimization. Campus administrators should\nconsider allotting financial resources to cyberbullying\neducation and promote healthy ways to communicate and\ndeal with conflict. Campus policies should be developed to\ndeal with the instances of cyberbullying on college\ncampuses. In addition, education on cyberbullying could be\nintegrated into undergraduate introductory courses such as\nfreshmen seminars, human relations courses, and college\nexperience courses.\nProfessors in student affairs, counseling education,\neducational leadership, and higher education could prepare\nsecondary school counselors-in-training to provide\ninformation and educational workshops on cyberbullying\nfor students and parents. In addition, counselor educators,\ncollege counselors, and other professionals could research\nthe impact of education on cyberbullying on the prevalence\nZalaquett and Chatters 7\nof cyberbullying in college. The results of these studies\nwould help improve efforts to reduce the likelihood of\ncyberbullying among college students. Future research on\ncyberbullying, its types, causes, mediums, and\npsychological correlates is needed to aid in the development\nof innovative methods of prevention, education, and\ninterventions.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAricak, T., Siyahhan, S., Uzunhasanoglu, A., Saribeyoglu, S.,\nCiplak, S., Yilmaz, N., & Memmedov, C.
