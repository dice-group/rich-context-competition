We investigated\nthe long-term role of BAE in CAD development and related mortality in 50 patients with proven\nCAD compared with that of 50 patients with chest pain and no CAD (controls) matched for\nclinical and laboratory characteristics.\nMethods: All subjects received a 4-day standard diet that included ~500 mg of cholesterol.\nFecal bile acids from 24-h stool collections were measured by gas liquid chromatography.\nResults: CAD patients excreted lower amounts of total bile acids than controls (p < 0.001),\nless deoxycholic acid (p < 0.0001) and less lithocholic acid (p < 0.01). BAE was the best\nsignificant independent laboratory factor that predicted CAD (p < 0.05). Mortality and CAD\ndevelopment rates were significantly lower for the controls at the 20-year follow up.\nConclusions: These results showed that CAD patients had markedly decreased BAE levels\ncompared with non-CAD controls. BAE <415 mg/day was associated with increased CAD\nlong-term mortality. Impaired ability to excrete cholesterol might be considered an additional\nindependent risk factor for CAD development.\n",

By carrying out a longitudinal study we\nintended to verify whether the difference between\npatients with and without CAD remained\nunchanged, increased or decreased over the\nperiod of time.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy design\nSubjects with symptoms suggestive of CAD were\nenrolled into the study and tested for the presence\nof CAD using coronary angiography. CAD-\npositive and CAD-negative patients were assayed\nfor fecal BAE as described below. The follow-up\nperiod averaged 17 years for both groups.\nPatient population\nAll patients hospitalized in our institution with\nchest pain suspected as being CAD (angina pecto-\nris, unstable angina or myocardial infarction) were\neligible for participation in this study, which was\nconducted from January 1995 through December\n2015. They all underwent coronary catheterization\naccording to clinical criteria (some of them after\nnoninvasive tests, treadmill ergometry or a thallium\nscan) and were divided into two groups: those with\nconfirmed CAD (demonstration of stenosis greater\nthan 70% on coronary angiogram) and those with\nnormal coronary arteries. Excluded were patients\nyounger than 40 years of age (because of a low risk\nfor CAD), those with psychiatric disease, malig-\nnancy, acute and end-stage renal failure (dialysis),\nhepatic disease, severe chronic obstructive pulmo-\nnary disease or acute infectious disease, and those\nreceiving lipid-lowering drugs. A complete medical\nhistory was taken, and the medical charts of partici-\npants with previous visits to our clinic were reviewed\nin order to retrieve data on a history of CAD and\ncardiac risk factors \u00ad diabetes mellitus (DM),\nhyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking and a body\nmass index (BMI) >25. In addition to a physical\nexamination, the study candidates also underwent\nan electrocardiogram, laboratory tests (a complete\nblood count, glucose, renal function, liver enzyme,\ncreatinine kinase) and a lipid profile in order to\nensure they were clinically stable. All patients after\ncoronary angiography were divided into two\ngroups: those with confirmed CAD (Group 1) and\nthose without CAD (Group 2, controls). Regarding\nconcerns about the possibility that participants in\nthe non-CAD group had symptomatic coronary\natherosclerosis (i.e. producing pains), it is impor-\ntant to emphasize that members of this group had\nbona fide normal coronary arteries.\nGroup 1 patients were enrolled in the study on\ncondition that they had not undergone any acute\ncoronary event for at least a previous 3-month\nperiod in order to exclude any effect of infarction-\nrelated metabolic changes. The study was\napproved by the local ethics committee and each\nentrant signed an informed consent prior to\nforms of long-term follow up and survival were\nbased on electronic health records.\nStudy protocol\nThe study was approved by the Ethical Committee\nof Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center.\nG Charach, O Argov et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 3\nAll patients performed a 24-h stool collection into\nspecial containers. A continuous non-absorbable\nmarker was used to evaluate the quantity of stool\nexcretion. Each subject received 12 capsules of\n75 mg copper isothiocyanate to be taken one per\nmeal for 4 days previous to stool collection, meant to\nserve as an internal standard for the purposes of cal-\nculation. A few patients did not have a bowel move-\nment after three days of the internal standard (copper\ntablets) administration. In those cases copper was\ngiven for a few more days until a stool was passed.\nOne week prior to the ingestion of this internal\nstandard, the patients received a standard in-hospi-\nhigh-cholesterol diet was well tolerated by all study\nparticipants without any discomfort or diarrhea.\nThey were asked to record the contents of each\nmeal consumed. Participants who did not conform\nto the strict diet were dropped from the study. Fecal\ncollection was made only during the hospital stay of\nthe patients admitted because of chest pain sugges-\ntive of ischemic heart disease. All blood samples\nwere taken on the same day as feces collection.\nQuantitative determination of the bile acids in\nfeces\nDetermination of bile acids was done as previ-\nously described.15 This method allows for com-\nplete recovery and separation of bile acids,\ntogether with a high level of accuracy, reliability\nand simplicity in performance. The stools were\ncollected throughout 24 h, and the amount of bile\nacids was determined per 225 mg of copper iso-\nthiocyanate that served as an internal stand-\nbile acids and their fractions is described in detail\nin our earlier publication.15\nFecal cholesterol excretion in the present work\nwas exceedingly low in comparison to total BAE.\nWe deemed these negligible amounts of choles-\nterol to have no significant weight in the total\nsterol excretion. With a linear detection range of\n1\u00ad150 mol bile acids, we considered our meth-\nodology fairly sensitive and accurate. Coefficient\nof variations for bile acids measurements were:\nintra-assay 3% and inter-assay 5%.\nIn an attempt to simplify the assessment of BAE,\nthe possibility of measuring blood level of surro-\ngate markers for the excretion may appear useful.\nHowever, while several assays have been used to\ndetermine both total and individual bile acids in\nbiological fluids, it should be recognized that less\nthan 1% of the total bile acid pool is present in the\nperipheral blood (2\u00ad10 mmol/L) due to the high\nefficiency of the hepatic transport mechanism for\nbile acids. Moreover, serum BA level is predis-\nposed to considerable variation due to alteration\nof liver function that is often undetectable by other\nliver function tests. Thus, it is not considered a\nreliable measure of metabolic risk for CAD.\nMeasurement of lipids content in the serum\nTotal cholesterol and triglyceride levels were meas-\nured enzymatically on a Siemens Advia 1650\nChemistry Analyser (Siemens Medical Solutions.\nDiamond Diagnostics - USA, Holliston, MA)\nusing the manufacturer's reagents.15\nStatistical analysis\nCategorical variables are reported as frequency\nand percentages, and continuous variables are\nreported as medians and interquartile ranges\n(IQR). Continuous variables were tested for a\nnormal distribution histogram. Categorical varia-\nbles were compared between patients with and\nwithout ischemic heart disease (IHD) by use of\nthe Chi-square test or the Fisher exact test, and\ncontinuous variables by the independent samples\nt test or the Mann\u00adWhitney U test.\nBile acids were divided into categories according to\ntheir median value. Kaplan\u00adMeier plots were used\nto describe mortality during follow up in patients\nwith and without IHD and in different bile acid cat-\negories. The log-rank test was used to compare\nthem. The length of follow up was measured using\nthe reverse censoring method. The univariate Cox\nregression was used to evaluate the association\nbetween bile acids, CAD status, potential confound-\ners and mortality. Each bile acid was assessed by a\nseparate multivariate Cox regression. The multivari-\nate regression models included age, sex, IHD and\nvariables with p < 0.2 in the univariate analysis.

This can be explained by\nrapid and more complete intestinal absorption of\ntriglycerides due to an excess of intraluminal bile\nacids necessary for the emulsification of fats.\nA significant percentage of patients were reported\nto develop atherosclerosis despite suppression of\nreason that a greater decrease of cholesterol blood\nlevels can be achieved by increasing cholesterol\ndisposal. This is particularly true in the case of\npatients at high risk for CAD, and it can be accom-\nplished by combining statins, ezetimibe, pcsk9\n(proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9)\ninhibitor-evolocumab treatment with drugs affect-\ning bile acid (and cholesterol) excretion, thus\nensuring optimal management of dyslipidemia.\nThe objective of the current longitudinal study\nwas to verify whether the differences in BAE\nbetween patients with CAD and non-CAD indi-\nviduals persist, increase or decrease over an\nextended period of time. Importantly, some non-\nCAD patients can also be expected to develop\ncoronary disease over a long period of follow up.\nWe consider that, in high-risk patients who can-\nnot achieve optimal LDL cholesterol levels while\non statin, ezetimibe or pcsk9 inhibitor, determi-\nnation of BAE could help to evaluate whether\nadding a bile acid sequestrant may boost choles-\nterol lowering.\nStudy limitations\nThe sample was relatively small and this could be\nthe reason why we did not find the impact of\nother bile acids, cholic and chenodeoxycholic\nacid, on patients' survival. The vast majority of\nour data were collected before the widespread use\nof statins, but whatever statin use existed it would\nhave led to underestimation of risk for the natural\nhistory of CAD. Limitations of this analysis\ninclude the absence of any information about sta-\ntin use, and its intensity. Only mortality outcomes\nwere recorded to the extent that nonfatal myocar-\ndial infarction (MI) occurred without subsequent\nCAD death during follow up. Thus, the risk for\nthe combined outcomes of CAD death or nonfa-\ntal MI and total atherosclerotic cardiovascular\ndisease would be underestimated in both groups.\nOur study included patients of predominantly\nEuropean origin, thus limiting the generalizability\nof our findings. There are the usual limitations to\nthis retrospective form of long-term follow up\nbased on electronic health records as noted previ-\nously. Importantly, we do not know what lipid-\nregulating therapy was being used by the\nparticipants for the last 10 years of the study, and\nthis limits the interpretation of data with regard to\nthe magnitude of the 20-year benefit.\nIt is reasonable to assume that repeating stool\nanalysis might yield more accurate results.\nHowever, stool sampling (described in the study\nprotocol) is laborious and exceedingly challeng-\ning, meaning that repeating stool collection not\nonly would intolerably burden participants but\ncould result in a dropout rate risking the whole\nproject. We thus opted for a single stool collec-\ntion, using the same protocol published in two\nIt appears that BMI was not an independent\ndeterminant of BAE.

Given that conjugated secondary\nbile acids are not absorbed and excreted in the\nfeces, it is also likely that bacterial enzymes facili-\ntating deconjugation would play a significant role.\nWhile these are speculations requiring further\nproof, additional lines of investigations related to\nthe role of gut dysbiosis where increased deconju-\ngation may limit fecal excretion are warranted.\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 11 \n10 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\nConclusion\nThe results of the present follow-up study showed\nsignificantly lower amounts of total bile acid,\ndeoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid secretion in\npatients with CAD compared with non-CAD\npatients. Decreased BAE to a daily level <415 mg\nwas associated with increased mortality.\nIn other words, decreased BAE was found to\nindependently be associated with increased mor-\ntality when patients with CAD are compared with\nnon-CAD individuals.
