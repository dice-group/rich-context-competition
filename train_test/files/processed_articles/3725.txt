In our study, we aimed to evaluate alosetron efficacy using new\nUS Food and Drug Administration (FDA) endpoints and utilization in clinical practice.\nMethods: This prospective, open-label, multicenter, observational 12-week study evaluated\nwomen with severe IBS-D enrolled in the alosetron prescribing program. The coprimary FDA\nendpoints were changes from baseline in stool consistency and abdominal pain severity.\nResponders achieved a 30% decrease compared with baseline in weekly average of the\nworst abdominal pain in the past 24 h, and a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in the\nnumber of days/week with at least one stool of type 6 (mushy) or type 7 (watery) consistency.\nSecondary endpoints included changes from baseline in stool frequency, fecal urgency and\nfecal incontinence.\nResults: Enrolled patients (n = 192) were primarily White (90.6%), with a mean age of 44.5\nyears.

Two generic formulations of\nalosetron have recently been approved by the\nFDA using the same 2002 indication and recom-\nmended dosage range.\nInterestingly, despite documented efficacy in\nclinical trials,3 no prospective studies have been\nperformed in clinical practice settings to evaluate\nthe safety and efficacy of alosetron in women\ndiagnosed with severe IBS-D using Rome III cri-\nteria. As well, no studies have evaluated the effi-\ncacy of alosetron using the new FDA composite\nendpoint which requires improvement in both\nabdominal pain and diarrhea.4\nThe objectives were to: (a) evaluate alosetron effi-\ncacy using the new FDA composite endpoint in\nwomen with IBS-D who meet Rome III criteria;\n(b) evaluate changes in fecal urgency and inconti-\nnence during alosetron therapy; (c) measure the\nclinical utilization pattern of alosetron in real-\nworld clinical-practice settings with respect to\npatient characteristics, (d) evaluate the dosing\nregimen prescribed in medical practice (including\nsubsequent adjustments); (e) assess concordance\nbetween physician and patient assessments of\nchange in IBS-D symptoms during alosetron\ntreatment, and (f) evaluate drug safety.\nMethods\nThis prospective, open-label, multicenter obser-\nvationalstudy(Protocol10LOT01)[ClinicalTrials.\ntron use in clinical practice of healthcare providers\nin the United States enrolled in the Prescribing\nProgram for Lotronex (PPL) in women with\nsevere IBS-D from November 2010 to March\nby the number of consenting eligible patients\nentered during the prespecified 28 months enroll-\nment period. Per PPL guidelines, the recom-\nmended starting alosetron dose is 0.5 mg twice\ndaily (b.i.d.) and can be increased to 1 mg b.i.d.\nafter 4 weeks if the starting dose is well tolerated\nbut does not adequately control IBS symptoms.\nAlosetron should be discontinued in patients who\nhave not had adequate control of IBS symptoms\nafter 4 weeks of treatment with 1 mg b.i.d.\nAdditional dose adjustments were permitted.\nA total of 67 investigative sites participated in\nthe study; 31 were gastrointestinal (GI) clinical\npractice groups, 4 sites were GI academic prac-\ntices and 32 were primary care sites. Institutional\nreview boards approved the protocol and patients\nprovided written informed consent. Adult\nfemales aged 18\u00ad65 years diagnosed with IBS-D\n(according to the Rome III criteria6) with IBS\nsymptoms for at least 6 months not adequately\ncontrolled by other IBS therapy were enrolled if\nthey met the definition of severe IBS-D by hav-\ning one or more of the following criteria, as\ndefined in the package insert: frequent and\nsevere abdominal pain/discomfort; frequent\nbowel urgency or fecal incontinence; or disabil-\nity or restriction of daily activities due to IBS.1\nThree to four patients were entered per investi-\ngative site. Exclusion criteria included presence\nof biochemical or structural abnormalities of the\ndigestive tract, concomitant unstable medical\ncondition(s), history of bloody diarrhea or\nabdominal pain with rectal bleeding, known or\nsuspected bile acid malabsorption, chronic or\nsevere constipation or complications from con-\nstipation, recurrent bowel obstruction, throm-\nbophlebitis or a hypercoagulable state. Patients\nwho were currently constipated or who had no\nbowel movements for three or more days during\nthe 2-week screening period were excluded.\nData collection\nPatients recorded daily diary entries describing\nbowel habits and IBS pain for 7\u00ad14 days during\nscreening. Eligible patients received an alosetron\nprescription from their healthcare providers and\nobtained alosetron from a pharmacy. At a base-\nline visit, patients and healthcare providers com-\npleted questionnaires on their perceptions of\ndisease severity, most bothersome symptoms,\nand satisfaction/success with the prestudy treat-\nment for IBS-D. Patients initiated alosetron\ntreatment after the baseline study visit and com-\npleted daily diaries on bowel habit and IBS pain\nfor all 12 weeks of the study. Study visits\n(exit) visit, patients and healthcare providers\nagain completed symptom and treatment satis-\nfaction questionnaires for comparison with those\nobtained at baseline.\nBE Lacy, JP Nicandro et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 3\nStudy endpoints\nThis study evaluated the composite primary end-\npoints (abdominal pain intensity and stool consist-\nency) currently recommended by FDA for studies of\ndrugs to treat IBS-D. In addition, as an exploratory\nendpoint, it also evaluated for overall treatment\nresponder status, as specified in the 2012 `Guidance\nfor Industry' publication.4 The clinical measure-\nments used to assess for improvement in both\nabdominal pain intensity and in stool consistency\nwere recorded daily in a diary by the patient during\nbaseline and throughout alosetron treatment. The\nintensity of the worst abdominal pain occurring in\nthe past 24 h was rated by the patient using a\n10-point scale (where 0 = `no pain' and 10 = `worst\npossible pain'). Stool consistency was evaluated for\neach bowel movement by having the patient visually\ncompare each expelled stool with a standardized\nscale Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) which pre-\nsented photographs of seven stool types that varied\nin consistency from hard balls of stool (type 1) to\nmushy (type 6) or only liquid stool (type 7). A daily\naverage stool consistency score was calculated if\nmore than one stool was passed each day. Average\nweekly values for daily abdominal pain intensity\nscores and for stool consistency scores were calcu-\nlated and used to evaluate for weekly treatment\nresponder status for these two parameters. A\nresponder for abdominal pain intensity was defined\nas a patient who experienced a decrease of at least\n30% in the weekly average abdominal pain intensity\nscore as compared with baseline. A stool consistency\nresponder was defined as a patient who experienced\na 50% or greater reduction in the number of days\nper week with at least one stool that had a consist-\nency of type 6 or type 7 compared with baseline.\nAn overall responder to alosetron treatment was\ndefined as a patient who achieved the prespecified\nimprovement in the weekly scores for both\nabdominal pain intensity and stool consistency\nfor at least 50% of the study weeks, that is, in at\nSecondary endpoints included changes from base-\nline in stool frequency, and proportion of days\nwith fecal urgency and fecal incontinence. Baseline\nand on-treatment percentage of days with fecal\nurgency and incontinence were calculated as the\ntotal number of reporting days divided by the\nnumber of days the patient reported the event,\nmultiplied by 100. The percentage of fecal\nurgency-free days during alosetron treatment was\nalso calculated for patients who recorded fecal\nurgency as being present during baseline. The\ntreatment response metric of fecal urgency-free\ndays has been suggested as a useful way to assess\ntreatment response in patients with IBS-D.7\nData on the type and number of other IBS thera-\npies used at baseline and during alosetron treat-\nment were collected. The proportion of patients\nwho increased (to 1 mg b.i.d.) or decreased (to\n0.5 mg once daily) their dose from the starting dos-\nage regimen of 0.5 mg b.i.d. was analyzed. Dose\ntitrations were based on the investigators' expertise,\nwith the goal of controlling IBS symptoms.\nPatients and physicians rated IBS severity on a\nscale of 1 (not very severe) to 7 (extremely severe)\nand identified the symptoms that improved after\nalosetron treatment. The percentage level of con-\ncordance in treatment outcome and improvement\nin IBS symptoms was compared between patients\nand their treating physicians. Success and satis-\nfaction with conventional therapy at baseline, or\nalosetron therapy at week 12 was rated on a scale\nwhere 1 = not successful or not satisfied and 7 =\nextremely successful or extremely satisfied.\nSafety\nAll patients who received at least one alosetron\ndose were evaluated for safety throughout treat-\nment and during follow up. Physical exams, blood\ncounts and serum chemistries were performed at\nthe 4- and 12-week/final visits. Adverse events of\nischemic colitis, ischemic changes, ischemia or\nnecrosis of the colon, constipation requiring hospi-\ntalization or an emergency room visit, and possible\ncomplications of constipation (e.g. obstruction,\nperforation, intestinal ulceration, toxic megacolon,\nileus, or impaction) resulting in hospitalization or\nemergency room visit were reported within 24 h of\ndiscovery by study investigators, regardless of seri-\nousness or severity. Physician impression of alose-\ntron tolerability was rated on a 7-point scale where\n1 = not well tolerated and 7 = very well tolerated.\nStatistical analysis\nSAS (Version 9.1, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, US)\nwas used for data analyses.\nBaseline average stool consistency score and pain\nseverity scores were calculated for the screening\nperiod and weekly during alosetron treatment.\nWeek 4 and 12/study termination results and\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 11\n4 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\nchanges from baseline were tested by nonpara-\nmetric Wilcoxon rank-sum test,8 and summarized\ndescriptively.\nConcordance between patient and physician assess-\nments of overall success of treatment outcome, as\nwell as improvement in individual symptoms from\nbaseline to the week 12 evaluation was also under-\ntaken. Evidence for concordance (lack of signifi-\ncant difference) in the patient versus physician\nassessment was assessed using McNemar's test.\nResults\nStudy population and baseline characteristics\n(75%) enrolled (Figure 1). Reasons for screen\nfailure (n = 64; 25%) included: screening criteria\nnot being met (17.2%), consent withheld or with-\ndrawn (31.3%), or the patient was unable to pay\nthe cost of the study medication (21.9%). Other\nreasons for screen failure and disposition of the\nrandomized patients are shown in Figure 1. A\ntotal of 192 patients were started on study medi-\ncation (see Figure 1). Forty of these patients dis-\ncontinued the study medication. The main\nreasons for discontinuation were inadequate relief\nwith worsening abdominal pain; 2 with increased\nconstipation, and 1 with worsening diarrhea) or\nlost to follow up (n = 6). A sum of 152 patients\ncompleted the study. Fully evaluable data sets\nwere incomplete in 47 of these patients, due to\nthe provider not completing all forms or the\npatient not answering all questions on the ques-\ntionnaires at each visit. Thus, the fully evaluable\n(per protocol) patient population consisted of\n105 patients for whom all study visits and proce-\ndures per protocol were completed.\nPatient characteristics and baseline IBS symp-\ntoms are shown in Table 1. Most patients\nyears. Patients' mean abdominal pain score\nwas 4.2, while stool consistency was loose, with\na mean BSFS of 5.2. Fecal urgency occurred\non >75% of baseline days and fecal inconti-\nnence occurred on approximately 18% of these\ndays (see Table 2).\nResults of patient and healthcare provider\nassessments of overall IBS severity at baseline\nare shown in Table 1. Both groups assessed IBS\nseverity as between moderately severe and\nsevere, with an 85.9% concordance (Spearman\nof patients meeting each of the criteria for severe\nIBS-D, as specified in current alosetron labe-\nling, was 92% for frequent and severe abdomi-\nnal pain and discomfort; 98% for frequent bowel\nurgency or fecal incontinence; and 88% for dis-\nability or restrictions of daily activities due to\nIBS. The majority of patients (84.4%) met all\nthree severity criteria, while 15.6% met two of\nthree criteria.\nAlosetron dosing and dosing adjustments.Baseline\nalosetron dosing regimens and adjustments during\nthe study were determined from the physicians'\nprescribing information.The most common start-\nFigure 1.

More specifically, there\nwere no cases of colonic ischemia, no reports of\ncomplications of constipation, and no deaths dur-\ning the study. Thirteen patients (6.8%) stopped\ntreatment due to one or more adverse events.\nDiscussion\nThis study enrolled women with severe IBS-D, as\ndefined by the current product label for alosetron.\nAll patients were derived from the clinical prac-\ntices of healthcare providers enrolled in the PPL.\nAlthough patients needed to meet only one crite-\nrion in the label to initiate alosetron, the vast\nmajority of patients in the study (84%) met all\nthree symptom-severity criteria, and both patients\nand healthcare providers concurred on the overall\nIBS severity at baseline. Thus, patients in this\nstudy are typical of those currently treated in `real\nworld' clinical practice.\nAlosetron has been previously studied in a large\nnumber of single- and repeat-dose studies.3,9 This\nprospective observational trial is unique in that it is\nthe first alosetron study to enroll patients using the\nRome III criteria. In addition, it is the only prospec-\ntive study of alosetron in which treatment efficacy\nwas evaluated by the new FDA composite end-\npoint,4 the current benchmark for demonstrating\nFigure 3.

The overall treat-\nment responder rate, using this rigorous FDA\nrequirement, was 44.6%, demonstrating alosetron's\nhigh level of control of abdominal pain and diarrhea,\nthe two cardinal symptoms of IBS-D evaluated by\nthe FDA composite endpoint. Importantly, one of\nthe most bothersome symptoms of IBS-D, fecal\nurgency, also significantly improved during this\nstudy. Calculation of responder status for freedom\nfrom fecal urgency during treatment showed that the\n50% and 75% responder rates during alosetron\ntreatment were 69% and 47%, respectively. These\nresponder rates during alosetron treatment compare\nfavorably with those observed during eluxadoline\nrespectively),10 a mixed -opioid receptor agonist/-\nopioid receptor antagonist approved by the FDA in\n2015 for IBS-D. Evaluation of responder status for\ncomplete relief of fecal urgency during treatment\nwith rifaximin, another drug approved by FDA for\nIBS-D treatment in 2015, has not been fully\nreported. A review of alosetron, eluxadoline, and\nrifaximin efficacy and safety demonstrated that alos-\netron had the greatest numerical treatment response\nusing the FDA composite endpoint.11\nAlosetron efficacy was consistent with that reported\nin previous clinical trials that used higher initial\nstarting doses of alosetron.12\u00ad16 Importantly, this\nprospective study is the only trial which evaluated\nIBS-D patients with the currently recommended\nstarting dose of 0.5 mg of alosetron b.i.d. with\nclinical monitoring to assess the need for dosing\nchanges as indicated by treatment response. A pre-\nvious randomized, controlled study in women with\nsevere IBS-D (Rome II criteria) demonstrated that\nalosetron doses of 0.5 mg once daily, 1 mg once\ndaily, and 1 mg b.i.d. were all effective in providing\nglobal improvement in IBS symptoms, adequate\nrelief of IBS pain and discomfort, and improve-\nment in bowel symptoms.17 The lower starting\ndoses also resulted in statistically significant and\nclinically relevant improvements in health-related\nquality of life, restriction of daily activities, and\ntreatment satisfaction compared with placebo.18\nHowever, there was no opportunity to change the\ndose if treatment response was inadequate. In our\nreal-world clinical-practice management study, no\ndosing adjustments were required for the majority\nof patients whose treatment was initiated at the\nrecommended starting dose of 0.5 mg b.i.d., indi-\ncating that IBS symptoms are well controlled in\nthe majority of patients at the recommended lower\nalosetron starting dose.\nThere was excellent agreement between patient\nand healthcare provider perceptions of IBS sever-\nity at baseline and symptom improvement during\nalosetron treatment. This concordance is improved\nover that reported in previous studies comparing\npatient and healthcare provider perceptions of IBS\nsymptoms and severity19 and may reflect the suc-\ncess of the alosetron risk management program in\nselecting appropriate patients for treatment, as well\nTable 3.

Similar to nearly all IBS\nstudies, the enrolled population was predomi-\nnantly White. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of\ndata regarding alosetron treatment outcomes in\nother races or ethnic groups. Although no cases of\nischemic colitis occurred during this study, the\nsample size was not adequately powered to iden-\ntify this, given that the risk of ischemic colitis in\nalosetron users is calculated at approximately 1 in\npatients to continue to use other available medi-\ncations taken during baseline for IBS-D symp-\ntoms, as long as the dose remained stable.\nHowever, this does not diminish the positive find-\nings reported in the study, since patients entered\nthe study only because they were symptomatic\ndespite current treatment.\nConclusion\nIn this real-world clinical-practice assessment of\nalosetron use in women with severe IBS-D who\nmet current labeling prescribing requirements,\ndosing with alosetron was consistent with labeling\nguidelines and there were minimal dose adjust-\nments during the 3 months of treatment.\nAlosetron significantly improved multiple IBS\nsymptoms, including IBS pain and stool consist-\nency using the FDA composite endpoint, fecal\nurgency, and incontinence. Patients and health-\ncare providers had similar assessments of the\nimprovement in multiple IBS symptoms during\nalosetron treatment. Alosetron was well tolerated\nand there were no reports of colonic ischemia or\ncomplications of constipation during the 3\nmonths of observation. Overall, these results\nsupport use of alosetron as a clinically effective\ntreatment for severe IBS-D in women who have\nnot responded adequately to other treatments.\n"
