To research\ndifferences between these organizations and vertically integrated organizations, we analyzed a sample of 1,031 industrial\nplants, statistically representative of firms with more than 50 employees in Spain's manufacturing industry. We used t-tests,\nnonparametric tests, and chi-square tests, and hypotheses were tested for three subsets of companies, classified by the R&D\nintensity of the industry. In each set of industries, subcontracting is systematically associated with small batch production.\nBy contrast, vertically integrated plants are more inclined to use mass production. In every type of industry, subcontracting\nis a form of governance especially efficient for the diffusion of new technology. Plants that subcontract production are more\nlikely than integrated plants to adopt advanced manufacturing technology, whatever the R&D intensity of the industry. We\nconclude that outsourcers seem better prepared than vertically integrated organizations to meet customers' requirements\nbut employment of subcontracting do not lower necessarily their technology needs--a widespread \"pro-network\" argument.\n",

The former have acquired increasing importance in\nsome developed countries'industry and are currently spread-\ning to developing countries (EIM & IKEI, 2009; Kakabadse\nThe literature has emphasized the possible advantages\naccruing to subcontractors who participate in production\noutsourcing networks (e.g., transfers of technology;\nAmesse, Dragoste, Nollet, & Ponce, 2001; Innocenti &\nPodolny & Page, 1998). A review of the literature con-\ncludes that \"the vast majority of the evidence analysed is\noverall extremely positive about the value of business-to-\nbusiness networks and their impact on the innovation pro-\ncess\" (Pittaway, Robertson, Munir, Denyer, & Neely, 2004,\np. 158). It has also been claimed that, in some industries,\nnetworks yield greater economic welfare than vertical inte-\ngration as contractors may share the capacity of different\nsuppliers, promoting savings of overall investment costs\n(Kranton & Minehart, 2000). These research findings may\nhave contributed to the existence of what Grandori (1999)\ncalls \"a general widespread pro-network bias\" among aca-\ndemics, international organizations, and policy makers (p. 2).\nPolicies have encouraged subcontracting in countries such\nas Italy, Ireland, Korea, Malaysia, and the United States\nConference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], 2001).\nThe United Nations Industrial Development Organization\n(UNIDO, 2003) has promoted subcontracting partnerships\nto help small and medium-sized subcontractors in develop-\ning countries and economies in transition.\nHowever, it is difficult to assess whether engagement in\nproduction outsourcing networks also accrues some advan-\ntages to contractors (outsourcers or clients).

One rea-\nson why companies outsource production appears to be, after\nall, to avoid investment in expensive equipment (Berggren &\nthis subject has left a practical question unanswered: Is sub-\ncontracting superior to other forms of corporate governance\nin promoting the adoption of new manufacturing technology\nin the industry? Furthermore, output flexibility, a trait the lit-\nerature often associates with production networks, has rarely\nbeen studied in its general dimension. The alleged shift\ntoward flexible production has largely been analyzed within\nincreasing popularity of offshoring and extraregional pro-\nduction networks (Hagedoorn, 1994; H\u00e4t\u00f6nen & Eriksson,\nuseful to understand more clearly whether firms that choose\nvertical disintegration have more chances to improve their\noutput flexibility, whatever their partner's location. Lack of\nconsensus on such questions is partly due to insufficient\nlarge-scale analyses.\nWhile the empirical literature in this field has provided\nimportant analyses, it has been mainly concerned with case\nstudies, rarely offering systematic evidence. The few large-\nscale studies on subcontracting are often at the industry (not\nat the industrial plant) level (see, for instance, D\u00edaz-Mora,\ntistical analyses to complement such research and provide a\nbroader picture of the phenomenon. Second, most of the\nmodels of industries that rely on external economies have\nbeen built on examples taken from Japan, Italy, and Germany\nand have concentrated on specific sectors, such as automo-\nbiles, within these countries (Sturgeon, 2002). Analyses of\nnational industries (and sectors) other than those tradition-\nally studied by previous researchers may help to draw a more\naccurate picture of the so-called new paradigm for industrial\norganization.\nTo summarize, more research supported by large represen-\ntative samples and standardized measurements is necessary to\novercome the limitations of previous studies confined to cer-\ntain countries, regional samples, and a limited selection of\nindustries. A better understanding of these aspects may con-\ntribute to the formulation of informed industrial policies.\nTo study differences between outsourcers and nonout-\nsourcers, we analyze data taken from a plant-level survey of\nSpanish industrial firms conducted in 2003. We compare\nthese industrial plants to understand better if those that prefer\ndisintegration are (a) better prepared to customize produc-\ntion and (b) have a potential to adopt new manufacturing\ntechnology. We also try to understand (c) if subcontracting\nenables industrial plants to reduce their equipment require-\nments, compared with vertically integrated plants. The total\nsample included 1,031 industrial plants (hereafter, plants).\nGiven size, sector, and geographic location, our sample is\nrepresentative of Spain's manufacturing plants with more\nItaly, Spain hosted the largest subcontracting industry in the\nEU-15, in terms of turnover associated with manufacturing\nsubcontractor activity (EIM & IKEI, 2009), hence the inter-\nest in analyzing the Spanish case.\nThe section \"Theoretical Background and Hypotheses\"\nprovides a review of the literature and proposes our hypoth-\neses. The section \"Data\" describes the data used in the\nempirical analysis. The \"Results\" section tests for differ-\nences between outsourcers (production networks) and non-\noutsourcers. The section \"Discussion\" discusses the results\nand the section \"Conclusion\" offers some conclusions.\nTheoretical Background and\nHypotheses\nThere is no standard definition of outsourcing (hereafter, we\nuse the terms outsourcing and subcontracting). Most authors,\nhowever, stress that subcontracting differs from mere market\ntransactions of readymade parts/components in that products\nsupplied by subcontractors (suppliers) are based on specifi-\ncations (quality, design, etc.) issued by the outsourcer (client\nWe define production outsourcing as an arrangement in\nwhich a company (the outsourcer) requests from another\nindependent firm (the subcontractor) the supply of an input\nor of parts and components; these must be manufactured\naccording to the outsourcer's specifications. We focus only\non subcontracting that involves legally distinct industrial\nestablishments (not within-company subcontracting), and\non outsourcing of tangible materials and components (not of\nservices). The term outsourcing has also been used in a pur-\nchasing perspective in trade studies, international business\n(IB) studies, and part of the management literature (Rama &\nHoll, 2013). This perspective sees outsourcing as trade in\nparts, components, and tasks deriving from the fragmenta-\ntion of (national or international) production, whatever rela-\ntionships exist between the buyer and the supplier.\n\"Outsourcing\" practices analyzed by this line of research\noften consist of the purchase of a noncustomized input\nthrough a spot market transaction (Spencer, 2005). In this\nsense, obviously, all companies \"outsource\" some produc-\ntion. However, we adhere here to the organizations and busi-\nness alliances literature, and define outsourcing as an\narrangement that involves collaboration between the con-\ntractor and the subcontractor. In this sense, not all firms (or\nplants) are outsourcers.\nAccording to Kranton and Minehart (2000), in a market\nwhere manufacturers and suppliers have no relationship,\nPardo and Rama 3\nonly standardized inputs are marketed; at the same time, ver-\ntically integrated manufacturers obtain their specialized\ninputs from their own plants. In practice, firms outsource\nsome activities and integrate others. Moreover, a firm may\nproduce in-house and buy (or subcontract) the same product\n(Parmigiani, 2007). Companies or plants may seek collabo-\nration along different stages of the value chain (vertical sub-\ncontracting) or in the same stage in an industry to expand\ntheir product mix (horizontal subcontracting). In practice,\nthey often combine both arrangements.\nResearch into outsourcing stems from various roots, such\nas organizational theory and network theory (H\u00e4t\u00f6nen &\nuse terms such as subcontracting networks or production\nnetworks for contracting out relationships involving collabo-\nration. However, it should be stressed that subcontracting\nnetworks are only a specific case of networks (Sacchetti &\nThough many types of flexibility definitions have been\nrecognized in the literature (see, for instance, De Propris,\n& O'Leary-Kelly, 2000), we focus here on output flexibility\nand, more specifically, on the ability of the plant to produce\nsmall batches and customized items. In the literature, pro-\nduction processes centered on small batch production, niche\nmarkets, and customization are often defined as flexible pro-\nduction systems. For Parthasarthy and Sethi (1992), compet-\ning in a market based on product mix or customization is an\nimportant aspect of scope flexibility. According to von\nTunzelmann (1995) \"flexibility comes from the alleged abil-\nity to redesign products very rapidly in response to perceived\nmarket forces\" (p. 263). Other authors see the ability to\nchange quickly between products as one form of manufactur-\ning flexibility (Upton, 1995). Naturally, these definitions are\nrelated.\nSome studies associate the mass production of standard-\nized goods (hereafter, mass production) channeled to large\nhomogeneous markets with vertically integrated firms, and\nsmall batch production with production networks (Bessant &\nthis thesis has mainly been tested for local production net-\nStorper & Harrison, 1991); hence, the criticism of those who\nclaim that flexible production phenomena are likely to be\nconfined to specific regional locations (Coffey & Bailly,\n1991). Though geographic proximity can certainly facilitate\nnetworking, case studies suggest that firms can also seek\nflexibility through subcontracting relationships with spa-\ntially decentralized suppliers (see, for instance, Echeverri-\nWe hypothesize the following:\nHypothesis 1 (H1): Outsourcers are more likely than non-\noutsourcers to engage in small batch production.\nWe investigate if this applies also to outsourcers who\nmainly subcontract production in foreign countries (interna-\ntional outsourcing). This thesis has rarely been put to test\nwith large-scale samples of a national manufacturing indus-\ntry. This is a contribution of our article.\nAdvanced Manufacturing Technology (AMT) enables\nmanufacturing plants to switch cheaply from one task to\nanother and produce small batches of customized items.\nZammuto and O'Connor (1992) define AMT as \"a family of\ntechnologies that include computer-assisted design and engi-\nneering systems, materials resource planning systems, auto-\nmated materials handling systems, robotics, computer\nnumerically controlled machines, flexible manufacturing\nsystems, and computer-integrated manufacturing systems\"\n(p. 701). For a list of AMT analyzed in this article, see\nAppendix A.\nWhile some authors see a positive association between\noutsourcing practices and the use of AMT, others suggest the\nrelationship is negative. The latter statement is justified\nbecause firms may allegedly reduce their investment require-\nments by outsourcing production (see, for instance, Berggren\nPittaway et al., 2004). Network theory and the industrial dis-\ntrict literature often consider subcontracting arrangements to\nbe a solution to firms' problems, such as resource scarcity\n(see, for instance, Berggren & Bengtsson, 2004; Ghisi &\nInsufficient capital is one such resource shortage, and, via\nsubcontracting, runs the argument, companies are able to\nquickly increase their output without incurring additional\ncapital investment. The management literature also consid-\ners that outsourcers may be able \"to take advantage of emerg-\ning technology without investing significant amounts of\nThis would increase the technology-related flexibility of\nfirms, especially when production technology changes\nquickly or when technological changes are difficult to pre-\nThis point of view has received some empirical support.\nSubcontracting seems to have allowed French small and\nmedium sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in the engineer-\ning industry to avoid investment in up-to-date machine tools\nand, often, reduce capacity (Lorenz, 2000). In a period of\nslow growth and uncertain markets (in the early 1980s), this\nauthor claims, it would have been impossible for these small\ncontractors to amortize investments. They were able to do so,\nhe argues, because subcontractors could aggregate the\ndemand of several clients. A similar argument is defended\nby Sturgeon (2002) concerning the U.S. high-tech industry.\nIn outsourcing of modules, he claims, suppliers rather than\noutsourcers (client firms) play a leading technological role,\nan arrangement that may reduce outsourcers' needs for\nmanufacturing technology. According to this author, these\n4 SAGE Open\ncontractors may be able to increase volume without install-\ning additional in-house equipment, as \"turn-keys\" suppliers\ncan offer external economies of scope. From the French and\nthe U.S. studies, it might be deduced that contractors (out-\nsourcers) may have less need for manufacturing assets than\nnonoutsourcers of the same sector.\nBy contrast, other academics believe that information and\ncommunication technology (ICT), an important element of\nAMT, is contributing to a shift from the old integrated firm\ntoward production networks (see, for instance, Acemoglu,\nAhion, Griffith, & Zilibotti, 2007). The literature on business\nnetworks suggests that ICT is an important ingredient in inter-\nfirm relationships (Grandori & Soda, 1995). Milgrom and\nRoberts (1990) argue that adopters of AMT tend to interrelate\nclosely with their suppliers. This stream of literature offers\ntwo principal explanations for why firms presumably com-\nbine participation in production networks and the utilization\nof AMT. First, ICT facilitates interfirm linkages by reducing\ncoordination costs. Rapid and reliable communication on a\nday-to-day basis is crucial to ensure continuous coordination\nbetween outsourcers and their suppliers (Giunta & Trivieri,\ndesign technology (another type of AMT) may facilitate vari-\nety-based production by reducing design and manufacturing\ncosts. As stated, previous research suggests that outsourcers\nare likely to specialize in customized production.\nHowever, the empirical evidence on the possible associa-\ntion between production networks and company use of AMT\nis inconclusive. One study finds that the fragmentation of\nproduction is slowing down the spread of ICT among Italian\nSMEs (Giunta & Trivieri, 2007). Milgrom and Roberts\n(1990) offer a convincing account of why outsourcers use\nAMT, but do not supply empirical evidence to support their\ntheory. As Bocquet, Brossard, and Sabatier (2007) note, most\nprevious studies have confined such analysis to computers\nand automation tools. Other studies, by contrast, have\nfocused exclusively on ICT and find associations only in cer-\ntain cases (e.g., in high-performing companies; Bocquet\net al., 2007; Whittington, Pettigrew, Peck, Fenton, & Conyon,\n1999). It is difficult to determine from previous research\nwhether subcontracting is associated with AMT in general.\nKlein (2005) contends that, in analyses of contractual rela-\ntionships and integrated firms, alternate hypotheses should\nbe tested as, in this field, rival explanations are quite\ncommon.\nTherefore, we put to test two alternate hypotheses:\nHypothesis 2a (H2a): Outsourcers are more likely to uti-\nlize AMT in the industrial plant.\nHypothesis 2b (H2b): Outsourcers are less likely to use\nAMT in the industrial plant.\nWe test for association rather than for causality between\nthese factors. The principal body of organization theory\nassumes that decisions concerning organizational form and\ntechnology are simultaneously adopted by the firm (Madhok,\nwith other empirical studies in the field (Whittington et al.,\n1999), we adhere to this theory, which implies association\nrather than causality between company adoption ofAMT and\nengagement in production networks. A contribution of our\narticle is that we analyze the relationships between subcon-\ntracting and a complete series of different types of AMT (not\nexclusively ICT) in companies operating in three different\nindustrial classes.\nAs stated, previous research has argued that AMT may\nfacilitate variety-based production by reducing design and\nmanufacturing costs at the plant level. This view suggests\nthat the reasons why outsourcers adopt AMT are to be sought\nin their production strategy, that is, production of small\nbatches and customized items. The question left unanswered,\nhowever, is whether it is the type of production (rather than\nthe type of organization) that is associated with the plant\nadoption of AMT. To our knowledge, previous literature has\nnot tackled this question.\nA review of the operations management literature finds\nthat although conventional wisdom has it that use of AMT is\nrelated to manufacturing flexibility (including new designs,\nrange of products, and volume flexibility), the results of\nempirical studies are in fact counterintuitive (Vokurka &\nO'Leary-Kelly, 2000). These studies \"are almost unanimous\nthat AMT was not associated with an increase in manufactur-\ning flexibility and, in some cases, was found to be associated\nwith a decrease in flexibility\" (p. 492). A possible reason for\nthe findings, these authors claim, is the unavailability of\nmanagerial skills required to implement AMT at the plant\nlevel.\nWe argue that engagement in production networks may\nboost certain managerial skills that facilitate the adoption of\nAMT. When a firm acquires new generation technology it\nneeds to possess in-house capabilities to cooperate and nego-\ntiate with suppliers of capital goods and systems (Flowers,\n2007). The adoption ofAMT requires complementary invest-\nments and learning, such as reskilling of the workforce; com-\npared with standard machines, AMT technology implies\nhigher costs of adoption, rather than lower ones (Hall, 2005).\nMoreover, as noted by Meccheri and Morroni (2010), \"out-\nsourcing entails the development of internal capabilities to\nbargain\" (p. 81). In our view, outsourcers may be better pre-\npared to face the sunk costs involved in successful AMT\nadoption. They are more likely than nonoutsourcers to have\ndeveloped such in-house capabilities, given their experience\nin managing partnerships and their greater propensity to\nTherefore, we propose the following:\nHypothesis 3 (H3): The implementation of small batch\nand customized item production tends to be signifi-\ncantly associated with the adoption of AMT only in\noutsourcers (not in nonoutsourcers).\nPardo and Rama 5\nData\nThe Survey\nA review of the literature on manufacturing flexibility and\nAMT adoption strongly advises to use the industrial plant\nas a unit of analysis in empirical analyses (Vokurka &\nO'Leary-Kelly, 2000). The data used in the following anal-\nysis were obtained from a plant-level survey targeting\nplants in Spain's manufacturing industry and conducted in\n2003. To establish the dimension of the population of plants\nin terms of sector, region, and size, we used the information\ncontained in the Central Directory of Enterprises (DIRCE),\ncompiled by the National Institute of Statistics. To select\nthe sample, the distribution of plants indicated by the\nDIRCE was taken into account. Regions are the 17 Spanish\nAutonomous Communities; including peninsular Spain, the\nCanary Islands, and the Balearic Islands. Sectors were\ndefined according to the CNAE classification (National\nClassification of Economic Activities), similar to the\nEuropean NACE rev1, and include all the Spanish manu-\nfacturing industry (26 industries). We selected companies\nfor analysis from the Dun & Bradstreet Spain list. Before\nfieldwork started, the initial list was depurated: 312 plants\nhad less than 50 employees because they had reduced their\nworking force after the publication of their data and 216\ndisplayed unreliable contact information. 2,209 plants were\ncontacted and the obtained response rate was 47%, giving a\nfinal sample of 1,031 plants. A comparison of the initial list\nand the final sample found no statistically significant dif-\nference between respondents and nonrespondents in terms\nof industry or region.\nThe sampled units are statistically representative of the\nuniverse of plants with more than 50 employees in the\nSpanish manufacturing industry.1 According to EUROSTAT\nclassification (European-Commission, 2008), these are\nmedium-sized and large plants. Other studies on manufactur-\ning contractors also select for analysis plants that employ\n2000). The sampling process was made by quotas resulting\nindustries. For a confidence level of 95.5%, the sampling\nerror is \u00b12.8%. The survey does not suffer from significant\nitem nonresponse.\n59% of the sample plants belong to a stand-alone firm that\nowns no other plant and 41% to a firm that owns at least\nanother plant (though not necessarily located in Spain). We\nwere unable to determine the name of the parent company in\n7% of the cases. Therefore, in a small number of cases we\nmight have collected data from different plants of the same\nparent. This may be a problem only if plants within a com-\npany have adopted a similar strategy. However, studies that\ninvolved multiple plants within a company have shown that\nmanufacturing flexibility is not uniform across plants (Upton,\n1995). Moreover, in our sample, the share of incompletely\nidentified plants is small and given that the total sample size\nis very large, even in the unlikely worst case scenario of all\nnonfully identified cases pertaining to the same parent com-\npany and, at the same time, all of them adopting a unique\nstrategy, the general results would be quite robust. Therefore,\nwe believe this circumstance does not pose a serious\ndifficulty.\nMost outsourcers subcontract parts and components or\nphases of production (vertical subcontracting). Only 17.5%\nof outsourcers declared, on a 1 to 5 Likert-type scale, that\nthey always subcontract the manufacturing of final products,\nwhich may involve horizontal and vertical subcontracting.\n57.7% of the outsourcers declared they never subcontracted\nfinished products and the rest used this arrangement only\nsporadically. The evidence also suggests that networks of\nsubcontracting are complex as plants may combine several\ntypes of arrangements. For instance, 83.4% of the outsourc-\ners combined subcontracting of parts and components (verti-\ncal subcontracting) with some subcontracting of final\nproducts that, as stated, may involve vertical and horizontal\nsubcontracting.\nA pretest of the questionnaire was conducted and all the\nprincipal problems encountered (mainly, ambiguities and\npoor understanding of some questions) were fixed before\nlaunching the general fieldwork. At the plant level, in the\nlarge majority of cases we interviewed Directors of\nProduction and personal interviews lasted on average\napproximately 1 hr. In a minority of cases, the interviewee\nwas somebody designated by the Director of Production. In\na few cases, after the interview was conducted, the more\nsenior official was subsequently contacted to complete\nmissing responses on some of the questions. Though the\ninformant's position in the plant may generate informant\nbias, this risk is reduced when researchers use a structured\ninterview (Vokurka & O'Leary-Kelly, 2000), as was the\ncase here.\nPatterns of technology adoption, the propensity to out-\nsource production, and the need for flexibility appear to vary\nfrom one sector to another (Acemoglu et al., 2007; D\u00edaz-\nTherefore, in our statistical analyses, we control for sector's\ndifferences. We classified the 26 manufacturing industries in\nwhich the plants operate into three groups according to the\nR&D intensity (average R&D/turnover) of the industry. In\ndoing so, we used the Organization for Economic\nCo-Operation and Development (OECD) classification,\nwhich establishes the following cutoff points for average\nR&D/turnover: 0.9%, 3%, and 5%. For instance, in indus-\ntries classified as having low R&D intensity, their average\nR&D/turnover is below 0.9%. We consequently divided the\nsample into three subsets, namely plants operating in (a) low\nR&D intensity industries2; (b) medium-low R&D intensity\nindustries3; and (c) medium-high4 and high5 R&D intensity\nindustries. We took into account the sector of the plant, which\nis not necessarily the main sector of the parent company. Our\n6 SAGE Open\nhypotheses are explored using data for the full sample of\nplants and for each of the three subsets.\nThe variables (Appendix A) were selected on the basis of\nthe previous discussion. The ORGANIZATION variable has\ntwo categories, outsourcers (i.e., firms that outsourced some\nproduction in the last 3 years) and nonoutsourcers.\nThe Sample\nOf the firms sampled, 41.8% operate in low R&D inten-\nsity industries, 31.0% in medium-low intensity indus-\ntries, and 27.2% in medium-high and high intensity\nindustries. Outsourcers account for 64.6% of the sampled\nfirms and nonoutsourcers for 34.9%. The percentage of\noutsourcers rises from 58% of the total number of firms\nthat operate in low R&D intensity industries, to 67% in\nmedium-low R&D intensity industries, and to 74% in\nmedium-high and high R&D intensity industries (Table\n1A). Companies that outsource some production to sub-\ncontracting suppliers are an important feature of Spain's\nmanufacturing industry.\nWe use four variables to analyze outsourcing practices:\nLOCATION (for definitions of the variables, see Appendix A).\nAs in other studies on production subcontracting (for reviews\nlyze the organization of plants by using a binary variable\nobtained through an explicit question about the use of outsourc-\ning. ORGANIZATION has, then, two categories: outsourcers\nand nonoutsourcers. In some of the tests, this binary variable is\ncomplemented by two ordinal variables that measure, respec-\ntively, the depth (intensity) and breath (scope) of subcontract-\ning. As in other studies (see, for instance, Bala Subrahmanyan,\ncontracting (INTENSITY) is measured by the share of out-\nsourced components and parts in total production. The variable\nreflects the extent to which the company relied on external sub-\ncontractors for the creation of production (Table 1B). 81.8% of\nthe sampled outsourcers report that outsourced components\nand parts amount to less than 25% of production value and\n18.2%, which we call heavy outsourcers, report that they\naccount for 25% or more. The selection of the cutpoint (25% of\ntotal production) was made in accordance with the few pub-\nlished statistics and estimations on subcontracting in the\nSpanish manufacturing industry (C\u00e1maras de Comercio, 2008;\nCambra de Comer\u00e7 de Barcelona, 2008). When outsourced\nitems amount to a larger part of total production, the firm relies\nmore heavily on subcontracting. By the same token, when sub-\ncontractors are fully responsible for the manufacturing of com-\nponents and parts, from design to production, we consider that\nthe breadth of subcontracting is broader and the client relies to\na greater extent on subcontractors for production (BREATH;\nTable 1C). In all, 67% of outsourcers indicated that their sub-\ncontractors were fully responsible for manufacturing of com-\nponents and parts. We expect that relationships predicted in H1\nand H2a will be stronger in plants that depend more on subcon-\ntracting to generate production.\nFinally, 92% of the sampled outsourcers had subcon-\ntracted production mainly in Spain and 8% mainly elsewhere\n(LOCATION; Table 1D).\nResearch Method\nWe start by analyzing certain factors, which, according to\neconomic theory, may influence company decisions con-\ncerning technology adoption (Hall, 2005; Karshenas &\nStoneman, 1995). A large plant or a plant that controls a large\nshare of the market may have more financial resources to\ninvest in new manufacturing technology (as opposed to a\nsmall plant or a plant that controls a small share of its princi-\npal market). In countries that are not at the forefront of tech-\nnological development, a foreign affiliate or a joint venture\nmay be better informed about new manufacturing technol-\nogy than domestic firms. Therefore, we study the association\nbetween our variable of interest, ORGANIZATION, and\nSIZE, OWNWERSHIP, and MARKET (definitions in\nAppendix A) to test for differences between outsourcers and\nnonoutsourcers. We also analyze the age of their respective\nequipment (AGE) to understand better the possible differ-\nences between outsourcers and nonoutsourcers concerning\ntheir use of manufacturing technology.\nSecond, we test for differences between outsourcers and\nnonoutsourcers (ORGANIZATION) through the use of non-\nparametric tests, t-tests and chi-square tests. Our first step\nconsists of studying their differences with regard to small\nbatch production (PRODUCTION). In doing so, we put to\ntest H1. Then, we analyze their differences concerning the\nuse of AMT by analyzing pairwise complementarities (see\ndefinitions of AMT variables in Appendix A). In doing so,\nwe put to test H2a and H2b. We also test whether the rela-\ntionships predicted in H1 and H2a are stronger in outsourc-\ners that depend more on outsourcing of production than in\nthe full sample of outsourcers. As stated, we control for the\nindustry context in which individual factors interact.\nFinally, we examine the interaction between a strategy\nfocused on small batch production and the utilization of\nAMT separately in outsourcers and nonoutsourcers. In doing\nso, we put to test H3.\nOur analysis is of an exploratory nature as we do not\nexplicitly model firms' decisions. As noted by Ring (1999),\nfirms have actually engaged in collaboration \"in ways that\nconfound theoretical predictions\", hence the need for bot-\ntom-up empirical analysis (p. 237).\nResults\nFactors Influencing Technology Adoption\nWe start by studying certain aspects that may influence the\nplant decision to adopt new technology (see SIZE,\nPardo and Rama 7\nOWNERSHIP, and MARKET in Appendix A). Differences\nbetween outsourcers and nonoutsourcers concerning size,\nownership, and market characteristics are not statistically\nsignificant (Table 2A and Table 2B). These key variables are\nnot likely to account for differences between outsourcers and\nnonoutsourcers concerning technology adoption.\nWe also analyze their possible differences concerning the\nage of the manufacturing equipment (Table 2C). A multivari-\nate test (Pillai's trace test) also demonstrates that the average\nage (AGE) of the respective equipment used by outsourcers\ntake into account the type of industry in which companies\nB.

The plants surveyed\nwere asked to indicate which of the following statements\nbest described their activities: the manufacture of (a) small\nbatches of a great variety of products and custom-made prod-\nucts; (b) large batches of technically homogeneous products\nand products in a continuous flow system. The first statement\napproximates small batch and customized production and the\nsecond, mass production.\nWe present now the results of the statistical analyses per-\nformed to test H1. Outsourcers tend to manufacture custom-\nmade products or in small batches (Table 3). Nonoutsourcers,\nconversely, are more likely to produce large batches. H1 is\nsupported. We inquire now whether plants intensively\nengaged in outsourcing tend, with more reason, to produce\nprincipally small batch and customized items (column 2,\nTable 3). We find that 37% of nonoutsourcers mainly produce\nsmall batches and customized items, versus 53% of outsourc-\ners and, more specifically, 66% of heavy outsourcers, that is,\nplants in which outsourced parts and components account for\n25% of total production. Results are robust to changes in the\nthree sets of industries, classified by R&D intensity.\nCalculating the odds ratio, we find that the probability of\ncompanies engaging principally in small batch and custom-\nized production is twice as high for outsourcers and 3.4 times\nhigher for heavy outsourcers (compared with nonoutsourc-\ners). The more heavily the plant relies on subcontracting, the\nmore it tends to mainly produce small batch and customized\nitems. This finding is confirmed for each of the three subsets\nof firms, and results are statistically significant. H1 is\nconfirmed.\nWe test now whether the physical location of subcontrac-\ntors affect such findings (see LOCATION in Appendix A).\nDifferences between companies that mainly subcontract\nabroad (international outsourcing) and companies that\nmainly subcontract within Spain are not statistically signifi-\n.244). We conclude that outsourcers are more likely than\nnonoutsourcers to engage in small batch and customized pro-\nduction, and that all types of production networks tend to be\nengaged in such a strategy, whatever the partner location.\nTable 3 also shows that nonoutsourcers manufacturing stan-\ndardized goods and outsourcers providing customized items\nstill coexist in every sector of Spain's manufacturing industry.\nThe empirical evidence certainly suggests that production\nnetworks are substantially associated with strategies related\nto the customization of production and fragmented markets.\nHowever, coincidence between the organization model (out-\nsourcers vs. nonoutsourcers) and type of production (cus-\ntomized production vs. mass production) is not complete. In\nsourcers) are principally committed to mass production and,\nconversely, 36.8% of nonoutsourcers customize their output\nor provide small batches of products.\nComparing Patterns of AMT Adoption\nTo test H2a and H2b, we compare the number of categories\nof technologies used by outsourcers and nonoutsourcers.\nPrevious research suggests that firms tend to combine the\nusage of various types of AMT (Colombo & Mosconi, 1995;\nMilgrom & Roberts, 1990). Moreover, Kotha and Swamidass\n(2000) advise researchers to consider AMT as a multidimen-\nsional construct. Therefore, we investigate how many such\ncategories of technologies are utilized by the average out-\nsourcer and the average nonoutsourcer. Definitions of the\nvariables used in the analysis are to be found under the head-\ning \"Advanced manufacturing technology,\" which includes\nTable 2.

The surveyed plants were\nasked eight questions regarding the usage of different types\nof AMT. We defined such multiple response variables as a\nmultiple response set, which we treated in exactly the same\nfashion as a normal continuous variable ($ATM). We then\nstudiedtheassociationbetween$ATMandORGANIZATION.\nOutsourcers, compared with nonoutsourcers, use a greater\nvariety of AMT, a result confirmed for each of the three sub-\nsets of companies (Table 4). This finding is confirmed, \"a\nfortiori,\" when we examine heavy outsourcers (INTENSITY\nin Appendix A). On average, they use four different catego-\nries of technologies, while nonoutsourcers use only 2.8\n(Table 4). This result is confirmed for plants in every group\nof Spain's manufacturing industries. Furthermore, outsourc-\ners who were likely to devolve full responsibility to suppliers\n(BREATH in Appendix A) used a greater variety of AMT\n(four, on average) than outsourcers who just subcontracted\nsome isolated phase (3.6); according to a t-test, this differ-\n.06). The outsourcers that, in principle, relied most on sub-\ncontracting tended to use the broadest range of AMT.\nWe also tested for differences between outsourcers and\nnonoutsourcers concerning the plant-level utilization of each\nindividual category of technology. Outsourcers were more\nlikely to utilize design and engineering technology, manufac-\nturing technology, and communication and control technol-\nogy (definitions in Appendix A); in most cases, chi-square\ntests indicated positive associations for each of the three sub-\nsets of companies (Appendix B). To summarize, outsourcers\nare significantly more likely to use AMT. Therefore, H2a is\nsupported and H2b is rejected.\nOutput Flexibility and AMT Adoption\nWe turn our attention now to the interaction between\nPRODUCTION and $AMT, but we perform the test sepa-\nrately for outsourcers and nonoutsourcers to understand the\npossible role of organization. As stated, certain proportion of\nnonoutsourcers also tends to produce small batch and custom-\nized items (Table 3); the test allows us to learn whether they\nare likely to use AMT.

Therefore, H3 is supported.\nTo summarize, the implementation of a strategy based in\nproduction of small batch and customized items is signifi-\ncantly associated with the use of AMT in outsourcers (not in\nnonoutsourcers). This finding is a contribution of our\narticle.\nDiscussion\nProduction networks are an important feature of Spain's\nmanufacturing industry. The percentage of outsourcers\n(nearly 65% of sampled plants) is high but in accordance\nwith previous data on subcontracting in Spain (D\u00edaz-Mora,\ndata with those of a previous study suggests an increase of\nsubcontracting practices in the Spanish manufacturing indus-\ntry (Holl, 2008). Perspective for the figure is provided by\nstudies on other countries. Around 50% of French manufac-\nturing companies with more than 50 employees outsource\nsome production (Greenan & Mairesse, 2001); a similar per-\ncentage of outsourcers is reported among Swedish engineer-\ning firms (Bengtsson, 2008). Reasons for differences in the\nextent of subcontracting in different countries are still an\nopen question in the literature, though some authors point to\nthe possible influence of cultural and institutional factors\nProduction networks are substantially associated with\nproduction of small batches and customized items as pre-\ndicted by previous studies mainly based on regional evidence\nresults suggest that outsourcers, whatever the location of\ntheir subcontracting partners, are better prepared to produce\nsmall batch and customized items than nonoutsourcers.\nTherefore, a contribution of our analysis is a geographic\nextension of previous results concerning the association\nbetween subcontracting relationships, and small batch and\ncustomized item production in local settings.\nWe also found that the expected relationship between the\ntype of organization and the type of production was stronger\nfor outsourcers that depended more on outsourcing than for\nthe full sample of outsourcers.\nSubcontracting is associated with the adoption of each of\nthe three kinds of AMT studied here: design and engineering\ntechnology, manufacturing technology, and communications\nand control technology.Acontribution of our study is the anal-\nysis of such associations for different types of AMT (not only\nICT). The number of AMT adopted by a firm may also reveal\nits ability to meet customers' requirements (Petroni, 2000).\nOur results disprove the argument that firms necessarily\nreduce their investment requirements by outsourcing produc-\ntion (see, for instance, Berggren & Bengtsson, 2004; Ghisi &\ninvestments tend to be similar to those of nonoutsourcers\nwith regard to the age of equipment while their need to invest\nin-house in varied technology seems to be higher, as they\ntend to use more categories of AMT. Moreover, the outsourc-\ners that were more reliant on subcontracting relationships\nwere likely to use a broader range of AMT equipment.\nProduction networks are forms of organization in which\nimportant resources specific to the relationship among busi-\nness partners are shared (M\u00e9nard, 2009). We propose that the\nnature of linkages and national context may play a role in the\ndistribution of such resources between outsourcing partners.\nThis may explain the divergence of our results with some\nstudies on high-tech industries in France and the United\nbile, defense, and telecommunication equipment industries,\nsubcontracting of modules is implemented through systems\nintegration implying relationships quite similar to arm's\nlength linkages. By contrast, analyses of outsourcers based\nin the manufacturing industries of France, Germany, and\nItaly, where subcontracting mainly involves subcontracting\nof parts and components (rather than modules), suggest that\nthese firms keep a range of manufacturing assets \"in house,\"\nInnocenti & Labory, 2004). Similar to those of the European\nstudies previously discussed, our results also support\nBengtsson's (2008), who concludes that subcontracting\nshould not be regarded as an alternative to development of\ninternal manufacturing capability.\nIn our sample, the implementation of small batch and cus-\ntomized item production tends to be significantly associated\nwith the adoption of AMT only in outsourcers (not in non-\noutsourcers). Though some nonoutsourcers produced mainly\nsmall batch and customized items, they were unlikely to uti-\nlize the specific equipment that might facilitate such a pro-\nduction. Therefore, organization seems to play a crucial role\nin AMT adoption. The empirical evidence suggests that the\nimplementation of small batch and customized item produc-\ntion does not per se lead to the adoption of AMT; outsourcers\nmay acquire, through their relationship with suppliers, some\nnetworking and technical capabilities that facilitate AMT\nadoption.\nConclusion\nWe analyzed data taken from a plant-level survey of 1,031\nSpanish manufacturing industrial plants to understand better\nwhether a \"pro-network bias\" might be justified. In doing so,\nwe compared outsourcers and nonoutsourcers concerning\noutput flexibility and technology adoption.\nOutsourcers seem better prepared than nonoutsourcers to\nproduce small batches and customized items, an important\nconsideration when the plant competes in volatile or unpre-\ndictable markets, the plant needs to produce frequent small\ndeliveries, or the product variety demanded by the customer\nis high. However, subcontracting of production do not lower\nnecessarily their technology needs--a widespread \"pro-\nnetwork\" argument. Policies implying that the use of net-\nworking may always allow outsourcers to obtain resources\nsuch as equipment are likely to fail as this is not a reality in\nall countries. Our result is also important for prospective\nentrepreneurs: networking, \"per se,\" is not likely to allow\naccess to new technology.\nIn every type of industry, subcontracting is a form of gov-\nernance especially efficient for the diffusion of new technol-\nogy. This finding supports the idea that outsourcers are likely\nto display a technology-driven strategy (Madhok, 2002;\nTeece & Pisano, 1994) and seems to confirm the interest of\n\"pro-network\" industrial policies.\nThe adoption of new manufacturing technology in con-\ntractors very often triggers changes in suppliers' assets and\ncapabilities (Afuah, 2001). A contractor that uses ICT may\nput pressure on its subcontractors to also adopt this technol-\nogy to facilitate coordination, thus promoting the spread of\nICT in the industry (Giunta & Trivieri, 2007). If this is true,\nour results may imply that outsourcing practices could dis-\nplay a potential for the modernization of the industry.\nOur results suggest that outsourcers may acquire, through\ntheir relationship with suppliers, some networking and tech-\nnical capabilities that facilitate AMT adoption. This is an\nimportant consideration in some markets as, according to the\noperations management literature, fit between a strategy\nbased on product variety and use of AMT leads to superior\nOur results are also relevant for academic researchers. In\ncontrast to earlier studies that studied only some aspects of\nAMT, we were able to cover a substantial range of technolo-\ngies. Moreover, the adoption of a multidimensional approach\nhas enabled us to study the relationship with organization in\ngreater detail. The implication for future studies is that AMT\nneeds to be studied in its varied forms. Second, our results\nsuggest that theoretical models (see, for instance, Atamt\u00fcrk\nance the trade-offs between acquiring capacity and subcon-\ntracting are not necessarily applicable to all national\nindustries.\nIn spite of the possible advantages of outsourcers, the\ngeneralized shift toward new forms of production organiza-\ntion predicted by some authors (Acemoglu et al., 2007;\noccurred in Spain's manufacturing industry at the beginning\nof the 21st century, although the networked firm certainly\nseems to be an emerging governance formula there, espe-\ncially in R&D-intensive industries. Our data support the the-\norganizational forms may be heterogeneous within national\nindustries. The persistence of \"old\" forms of governance\nsuggests that other aspects than those studied here also need\nto be compared. This will be the object of future research. A\nmethodological limitation of our study is the cross-sectional\nnature of the data. As noted by Afuah (2001), in an age of\nrapid technological change, firm boundaries evolve.\nLongitudinal studies of subcontracting are an important ave-\nnue for future research.\nAppendix A.\nDefinition of Variables.\nName of Variable Definition Question Responses\nCharacteristics of the firm\nSIZE Employment No. of employees in the industrial\nplant\nNo. of employees in the\nindustrial plant\nOWNERSHIP\n\nOrigin of capital Origin of capital 1.
