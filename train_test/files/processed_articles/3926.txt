Forty-six patients with newly diagnosed myeloid (AML, biphenotypic leukemia,\nCML) or lymphoid (CLL, NHL, B-ALL, T-ALL) hematological disorders were included in the study. In the lymphoid\ngroup, the median expression values of RENIN, ACE1, ACE2 and ANGIOTENSINOGEN (ANGTS) mRNAs were 1.96%,\nphoid group, RENIN levels were significantly higher (p = 0.001), whereas ACE1 and ACE2 levels were significantly higher\nin the myeloid group (p values were 0.013 and 0.010, respectively). ANGTS levels were similar in both groups. In patients\nwith non-ALL lymphoid malignancies, RENIN expressions were significantly higher when compared to ALL patients\n(p = 0.004). All patients with active disease had significantly higher RENIN mRNA expression levels than patients without\nactive disease (2.03% vs 0.30%) (p = 0.034).

Moreover, RENIN\nexpression levels in all patients with active disease were\nsignificantly higher than in those without active disease.\nThese data further support the original hypothesis that there\nis a local RAS in the BM affecting physiological and patho-\nlogical hematopoiesis.1,2 The main RAS molecules, includ-\ning renin, angiotensinogen, angiotensin receptors and\nACE had been previously detected in the rat BM microen-\nvironment.24 We have found the same RAS molecules in\nhuman samples, indicating that local hematopoietic RAS is\na universal autocrine-paracrine system. The results of our\npresent study also indicate that the activities of local RAS\nmay differ in distinct disease states such as leukemia and\nlymphomas.\nRenin, as an aberrant leukemic marker of acute leuke-\nmia, was expressed in leukemia cell lines such as K562,\nto specific immunoreactive renin-like peptide of 47 kDa\nconverting angiotensinogen to Ang-I had been detected in\nTable 3.

The highest frequency was observed in AML\npatients (47.2% of the cases).25 Renin expression disap-\npeared during the complete remission of AML.25,26 The\nsame investigation team has analyzed 76 samples taken\nfrom patients with AML with follow-up of the positive\npatients. Thirty-one patients (41%) were positive for renin\ngene expression at diagnosis in their study. All of the renin-\npositive patients at diagnosis showed no expression during\ncomplete remission (CR), but expression recurred in those\nexperiencing relapse and persisted when the disease was\nrefractory to treatment.26 In our study, RENIN expressions\nwere found to be significantly higher in the lymphoid group\nin comparison to the myeloid group. After dividing the\nlymphoid group into two groups including ALL patients\nand non-ALL patients, we noticed that RENIN expressions\nwere significantly higher in the non-ALL patient group\nwhen compared to RENIN expression levels of the ALL\npatient group. Thus, the difference of the RENIN expres-\nsion levels between lymphoid and myeloid groups was\nlikely to be due to the non-ALL patient group. Furthermore,\nRENIN gene expression levels of the patients with active\ndisease were significantly higher than the expression levels\nof the patients without active disease (p = 0.034). These\nfindings indicate that RENIN is an active molecule for both\nmyeloid and lymphoid neoplastic disorders.\nACE existence throughout hematopoietic ontogeny7,8\nindicates primitive hematopoiesis casts attention on the\neffects of RAS on neoplastic tissues. Immunohistochemical\nstudies have shown the possible role of ACE/RAS in BM\nby evaluating ACE expression in normal BM, several mye-\nloproliferative disorders and myelodysplasia.31 ACE and\np53 expressions were detected in the CD34+ cells of\npatients with acute leukemia during and after induction\nchemotherapy.17 ACE-expressing macrophages in lymph\nnodes of patients with Hodgkin's disease have been\ndetected.15 Enhanced ACE activity was also linked to mul-\ntiple myeloma.32,33 ACE hyperfunction results in faster\nhydrolysis of the AcSDKP peptide, which in turn decreased\nin BM tissues, allowing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to\nenter the S stage of the cell cycle.9,34 Ang 1-7 can be formed\ndirectly from the major RAS peptide Ang-II by the actions\nof the enzyme ACE2 and also from the Ang-I peptide. Mas\nreceptors present in the BM microenvironment mediate the\nproliferative effect of Ang 1-7 on HSCs.35\nDeficiency of ACE2 in BM-derived cells increased\nmRNA abundance of a macrophage marker (F4/80) and\ntumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) in the stromal vascu-\nlar fraction of retroperitoneal adipose tissue, suggesting\nincreased infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue\nof chimeric mice lacking ACE2 in leukocytes.36 In our\nstudy, ACE1 and ACE2 expressions were found to be sig-\nnificantly higher in the myeloid neoplastic disorders when\ncompared to the lymphoid cancers. Our results confirm\nprevious observations that ACE is an important molecule\nin the pathobiology of leukemias.3,4 ACE inhibitors have\ninhibitory actions against leukemic cells via induction of\napoptosis in vitro. A Spanish group37 investigated the\neffect of captopril, trandolapril and losartan on the K562\nleukemic cell line and K562 transfected with c-myc, bcl-x\nand bcl-2 (KmycB, Kbclx and Kbcl2, respectively). ACE1\nand losartan inhibited cell growth, decreased c-myc\nexpression and increased apoptosis in leukemic cells. The\npro-apoptotic effects of the RAS blockers were associated\nwith the Ang-II induced Smad activation.37 Therefore, the\nplace and function of ACE in hematological neoplasia are\nnot just an academic issue but deserve to be investigated\nfor the management of tumors in future trials.\nHuman umbilical cord blood cells express RENIN,\nANGTS and ACE mRNAs.38 Savary and colleagues detected\nthe expression of ACE, RENIN, ANGTS and the chicken\nAng-II receptor at a stage when blood circulation is not yet\nestablished and systemic regulation of blood pressure by\nthe RAS is therefore not yet required. It therefore seems\nlikely that the RAS is locally functional. The location of\nACE in the extraembryonic endoderm, in contact with the\nfirst blood islands differentiating in the posterior extraem-\nbryonic mesoderm, puts ACE in a strategic position for\nprimitive erythropoiesis.

De novo CML patients had increased ACE,\nANGTS and RENIN mRNA expression levels, and these\nlevels decreased following administration of imatinib. The\nRAS activities were significantly different among Sokal\nrisk groups of CML, highlighting the altered biological\nactivity of RAS in neoplastic disorders. Therefore the\nhematopoietic RAS affects neoplastic cell production,\nwhich may be altered via administration of tyrosine kinase\ninhibitors such as imatinib mesylate.16 In our study, ANGTS\ngene expression levels were similar in myeloid as well as\nlymphoid patients with or without active disease. Paracrine\nand autocrine activities of the renin and ACE seem to be\nsuperior to angiotensinogen in the pathobiology of hemato-\nlogical neoplastic disorders.\nThe contributions of the RAS components to primitive\nand neoplastic hematopoiesis are evident.3,4 AT type 1a\ncells, CD34+CD38+ cells, lymphocytes and stromal cells.\nAng-II, the main effector peptide of RAS, increased hemat-\nopoietic progenitor cell proliferation by acting on AT1a\nreceptors present on the CD34+ HSCs.42 Ang-II was found\nto be acting as an autocrine growth factor for AML.43 BM\nAT1 expression levels of the myeloma patients disclosed\npositive correlation with their BM infiltration pattern and\ntumor load indicated by serum beta 2 microglobulin lev-\nels.33 The pharmacologically developed drug Ang-1-7 is\nalready in phase I/II clinical trials for the modulation of BM\nRAS in distinct disease states.44,45 However, since most of\nthe cellular effects of the local RAS are in an autocrine,\nparacrine and intracrine fashion, future drugs intended to\nmodulate local RAS functions shall be prepared to have\nlocal targeted actions in the tissue microenvironment, such\nas inside BM.\nConclusions\nThe results of our present study indicate that the activities\nof local RAS may differ in distinct disease states such as\nleukemia and lymphomas.
