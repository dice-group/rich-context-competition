Greene,1 Jan Ondrich,1 and Sarah Laditka2\n'Center for Policy Research, Syracuse University, New York.\n2State University of New York Institute of Technology, Utica.\nObjective. To determine whether efficient allocation of home care services can produce net long-term care cost\nsavings.\nMethods. Hazard function analysis and nonlinear mathematical programming.\nResults. Optimal allocation of home care services resulted in a 10% net reduction in overall long-term care costs for\nthe frail older population served by the National Long-Term Care (Channeling) Demonstration, in contrast to the 12%\nnet cost increase produced by the demonstration intervention itself.\nDiscussion. Our findings suggest that the long-sought goal of overall cost-neutrality or even cost-savings through reduc-\ning nursing home use sufficiently to more than offset home care costs is technically feasible, but requires tighter targeting\nof services and a more medically oriented service mix than major home care demonstrations have implemented to date.\nTHE issue of whether the actual and potential perfor-\nmance of home care services can offset nursing home\nuse, and thereby reduce overall long-term care costs for\nchronically impaired older persons, has been a central con-\ncern of policy analysts for nearly two decades. Despite a con-\nsiderable body of empirical data provided by a number of\nmajor demonstration studies, understanding of the issue re-\nmains incomplete. In part, this is because analysis has been\nhindered by conceptual and methodological approaches that\nare limited in their ability to address key policy issues, partic-\nularly those related to service-targeting and allocational effi-\nciency. The broad objective of the research described in this\narticle is to apply a more rigorous and informative analytical\nframework within which these issues can be addressed. Our\ngoal is to assess the actual performance against the estimated\noptimal performance of the National Long-Term Care\nDemonstration (better known as the Channeling Demonstra-\ntion)--and, by inference, the performance of other such pro-\ngrams--in the cost-effective use of long-term care services.\nIn this way we can estimate the extent to which the Channel-\ning Demonstration may have fallen short of its cost-contain-\nment potential and gain insight into reasons why.\nThe question of whether home-based long-term care ser-\nvices can serve as cost-effective alternatives to nursing\nhome care for frail older persons is important both because\nit has major implications for the design and financing of\nlong-term care services at a time when demand for them is\nexpected to rise dramatically, and because the ability to\nmaintain frail older persons in community settings, rather\nthan in institutions, is an important humanitarian issue in\nUnited States social policy. The fact that an expansion of\nhome care services is at the core of the Clinton Administra-\ntion's proposals for long-term care reform lends additional\ninterest to the issue.\nIt is widely believed that a series of demonstration stud-\nies undertaken over the past 20 years, culminating in the\n1984 Channeling Demonstration, has definitively estab-\nlished that home care services have little or no potential to\nreduce overall long-term care expenditures, even in very\nfrail populations. As a consequence of these findings, schol-\narly policy interest in such services in this context has\nwaned greatly in recent years, despite continuing political\nsupport for home care programs. In our view, however, re-\nports of the demise of the cost-effective home care alterna-\ntive are premature and are based on conceptual models and\ndata analyses that are inconclusive and incomplete with re-\nspect to a number of key policy issues.\nThe more systematic and rigorous studies of the effects\nof home care on nursing home use and long-term care costs\nhave been large experimental or quasi-experimental studies\nin which a treatment group is provided with supplemental\nhome care services over their predemonstration levels\nwhile a control group is not. After a period of time, the\ncost-equivalent of the difference in total nursing home use\nacross treatment and control groups over the period is\nnetted out against the total costs of the demonstration ser-\nvices to ascertain whether total long-term care costs have\ndecreased, in which case the intervention would be consid-\nered \"cost-effective\" in this narrow, but important, sense.\nIn some cases, changes in acute care costs are considered\nas well. In general, the more rigorous evaluation studies\nhave found insufficient nursing home savings to offset the\ncosts associated with the demonstrations' services (Hughes,\nCready, & Pawelak, 1988). This finding was repeated in the\nresults of the Channeling Demonstration--the largest, most\nbroadly implemented, and most rigorously evaluated home\ncare demonstration to date (Kemper, 1988).\nDespite the general uniformity of the body of findings\nfrom these demonstrations, what is known about the effect\nof home care services on nursing home use and long-term\ncare costs remains remarkably limited and offers little guid-\nance on such key issues as appropriate service mixes and\ntargeting of services. One principal shortcoming of the evi-\ndence is that the demonstration intervention has been\nviewed as an aggregate \"package\" in the evaluation meth-\nodology, which in effect compares average outcomes across\ntreatment and control groups. As a result, the differential ef-\nfects of particular services for particular individuals have\nnot been assessed fully in the evaluations.\nAs we have pointed out previously (Greene, Lovely, &\nOndrich, 1993), findings that home care interventions are\nnot cost-effective at the program level implies only that, on\naverage, the costs of providing the home care services out-\nweighed the imputed savings in nursing home expenditures.\nBut this average loss may disguise any number of individ-\nual gains. That is, it is possible that some, perhaps many,\nindividuals who received demonstration services experi-\nenced a sufficient reduction in their actual or expected nurs-\ning home use to offset the costs of the home care services\nthey consumed. Indeed, we have argued that this appears to\nbe the case for many individuals in the Channeling Demon-\nstration population (Greene et al., 1993). It is also possible\nthat different portfolios of home care services could have\nbeen more cost-effective for individuals than those that\nwere actually utilized. These issues have seldom been\naddressed rigorously in the literature, though they are fun-\ndamental to considerations of the efficient targeting of\nservices (cf. Davidson, Moscovice, & McCaffrey, 1989;\nTargeting, properly understood, is systematically decid-\ning who gets which services, when, and in what amounts\n(Greene et al., 1993). Even if a screening process is effec-\ntive in identifying those individuals who could benefit from\nservices (in ways defined by the goals of the program), the\neffectiveness and cost performance of the intervention still\ndepends on the appropriate services being provided in ap-\npropriate amounts to the appropriate individuals. The in-\ntended contribution of the research reported here is to ad-\ndress these issues directly. We consider the targeting issue\nspecifically, analyzing service use in the population tar-\ngeted by the Channeling Demonstration at the level of spe-\ncific individuals using specific home care services in spe-\ncific amounts at specific prices. We then make use of this\nframework to assess the potential of home care services to\noffset their long-term care costs through reductions in ex-\npected nursing home use.\nIn our earlier work on optimal home care service al-\nlocation, technical considerations required us to allow the\noptimization to allocate all available home care services,\nincluding those provided outside of the Channeling Dem-\nonstration from both public and private sources (see Greene,\nLovely, Ondrich, & Miller, 1995). Most importantly, the\noptimization was allowed to reduce services to individ-\nuals where it found them to be used inefficiently, even, in\neffect, taxing away services that were purchased privately.\nAlthough the results of this rather authoritarian \"social\nplanning\" solution are of analytical value, their direct pol-\nicy interest is obviously quite limited. In the present study,\nwe have been able to constrain the optimization process\neffectively so that, like the Channeling Demonstration, it\ncan initiate or supplement home care services where it finds\nit appropriate to do so, but it cannot reduce nondemonstra-\ntion services already in use. Thus, the optimization here\nfaces the same basic structural constraints, prices, service\ntypes, and population characteristics as did the actual\ndemonstration, so that its performance in effect yields a\ntechnically optimal \"gold standard\" against which the cost-\ncontainment performance of the actual demonstration can\nbe compared.\nMETHODS\nOur work proceeds in two basic stages. The first devel-\nops an empirically estimable statistical model for long-term\ncare costs that takes into account both the costs of home\ncare services and those of nursing home care; these costs\nare expressed as a function of individual characteristics and\nlevels of use of various home care services. The second\nstage is to use this model to simulate a cost-minimizing dis-\ntribution of services to a population statistically equivalent\nto the one served by the Channeling intervention, and to\ncompare this optimal outcome to the one actually achieved\nby the demonstration. Through this comparison, as noted,\nwe can assess the actual performance of the Channeling\nDemonstration relative to its estimated theoretical potential.\nFurther, by comparing actual service assignments as imple-\nmented in the demonstration with those assigned by the op-\ntimization, we can gain insight into the sources of any dif-\nferences in performance.\nDeveloping the Cost Equation\nDrawing from our earlier work on this topic (Greene et\nal., 1993), we begin our analysis by inquiring as to what ex-\nactly is meant when one asks whether providing an addi-\ntional unit of a specific home care service to an individual\nis \"cost-effective.\" Consider first the effect of providing an\nadditional unit of this service (e.g., one hour per week) on\nthe expected cost of caring for this individual in the com-\nmunity. The extra service not only increases the nominal\nweekly cost of care by the hourly cost (price) of the service,\nit also increases the probability that this cost will actually\nbe incurred insofar as the additional unit of service in-\ncreases the likelihood that the individual will be able to re-\nmain in the community. On the other hand, these additional\ncosts will be offset insofar as the additional unit of service\ndecreases the likelihood that the nominal weekly charges of\na nursing home will be incurred. The question of budgetary\ncost-effectiveness then hinges on whether, and the extent to\nwhich, the second effect exceeds the first. It should be\nnoted that this analysis generalizes to individuals who\nmight currently be in nursing homes in that the availability\nof an additional unit of home care service may be taken to\naffect the risk for nursing home use in subsequent periods\nby increasing the likelihood of discharge and decreasing\nthat of readmission.\nWe will make our discussion more precise by consider-\ning an individual whose characteristics are such that her\noverall risk (probability) of being found in a nursing home,\nconditional on survival, is ty. This may, equivalently, be\nthought of as the proportion of time such an individual\nwould be expected to spend in nursing home care. Assume\nfurther, for the moment, that surviving individuals are ei-\nther in the community or in a nursing home (we deal with\nthe issue of hospital use later). We can then write the total\nexpected (i.e., long-run average) weekly long-term care\ncosts for this individual as\nT=tyN+(l -\\\\t) C (1)\nwhere N is the prevailing nominal weekly charge for nurs-\ning home care and C is the sum of the price-weighted quan-\ntities of all formal home care services that would be con-\nsumed by this individual during a week of community\nresidence. Equation 1 therefore simply expresses the nomi-\nnal cost of each state weighted by its probability of occur-\nrence, which is the conventional method of estimating costs\nin situations where outcomes are not known with certainty\nat the time decisions must be made (Raiffa, 1970).\nIf this individual receives some amount of additional\nhome care services, the anticipated result is to decrease i|i\n(nursing home risk) to some degree, but to increase C by\nthe nominal cost of these additional services. Observe in\nEquation 1 that these effects tend to counteract each other\nin that the term \\\\tN will decline while the term (1 - iff) C\nwill increase. Whether it is cost-effective to provide these\nadditional home care services is determined by the net ef-\nfect on expected total weekly long-term care cost (7). If T\ndecreases, the reduction in risk (I|J) was sufficient to offset\nthe increase in C and the additional services may be said to\nbe cost-effective in this sense. On the other hand, if T in-\ncreases, then the additional services have failed to reduce\nnursing home risk sufficiently to offset the expected costs\nof their provision.\nIt is instructive to consider Equation 1 in marginal form.\nThe continuous (rate of) change in expected total costs as a\nfunction of changes in the level (weekly hours) of the jth\ncommunity service (5,) is obtained by differentiating par-\ntially with respect to Sj to yield\nTTT + PU) \u00b7 (1 - (2)\nwhere P(j) is the per-hour cost (price) of the jth service\n[dC/dSj = P(j)]. For an additional unit of service to be cost-\neffective, it is necessary for the derivative on the left to be\nnegative; that is, the change in total cost must be downward.\nFrom Equation 2, it is clear that whether it is cost-effec-\ntive to provide or make available another unit of home care\nservice to an individual depends, at a minimum, simultane-\nously on four considerations:\n1. The current cost differential between caring for the in-\ndividual in a nursing home as compared to the com-\nmunity: the term (N-Q.\n2. The current level of nursing home risk: ij/.\n3. The magnitude of the effect on this risk of providing\nthe additional unit of service: d\\\\i/dSj.\n4. The price of the additional unit of service: P(j).\nEmpirical Estimation of the Cost Equation\nTo understand more fully the stochastic model underlying\nthe cost equation, consider a sample member who begins\nheryth stay in a nursing home at calendar time T,. If, at cal-\nendar time ij + t, the sample member is still in the nursing\nhome, then the current duration of her stay is t. In this study\nwe assume that T, and t are measured continuously. In actual\nfact, we have daily information on nursing home use, so our\nassumption of continuous measurement is not unreasonable.\nWe are interested first in examining the determinants of\nthe instantaneous (conditional) probability of returning to\nthe community from a nursing home, written as Qn\ndt, where\ndt is a time infinitesimal and 0n\nis the nursing home hazard\nrate. Typically, the nursing home hazard rate is determined\nby factors at calendar time T> + t and at current duration t.\nThus, we may write\nen\n= t,t). (3)\nThe nursing home hazard rate can be defined formally as\nthe following transformation of a conditional probability\nfor random completed stay duration 7}:\n(T, + t,t) = lim Prob(t<Tj<t+ AHT,, 7}>0/Af. (4)\nWe consider nursing home hazard rates having a Weibull\nform:\n(T; + t,t) = p,ar', a > 0, (5)\nwhere pn\n, the scale function of the Weibull hazard rate, de-\npends on T; +1 and is typically defined by\npn\nwhere Zn is a vector of (weakly) exogenous covariates that are\nconstant over the individual's history and Zn\ni is a vector of\n(weakly) exogenous covariates that vary over the course of an\nindividual's history. The parameter a is the shape or duration\ndependence parameter of the Weibull. The goal is to determine\nPo, Pi, P2, and a using maximum likelihood estimation. (A\ntechnical discussion of the estimation of this hazard and others\nin this section, omitted here due to length considerations, is\navailable from the corresponding author upon request.)\nThe hazard rate for entering a nursing home from the com-\nmunity, 9c, is given an exponential form in this study. An ex-\nponential hazard rate does not depend on current duration\nand is simply a Weibull hazard rate with the shape parameter\na = 1. This is a simplifying assumption, but it is necessary if\nan individual who is in the community at the start of the sam-\nple period is not to have her initial current community spell\nduration assigned arbitrarily. This is not a problem with the\nnursing home hazard estimation because there is a sufficient\nnumber of completed nursing home spells with which to es-\ntimate the hazard parameters after initial half-spells are\nomitted from the estimation. In the exponential community\nspell model, using the information in the last \"half of the\ninitial community spell as if it were a spell starting at the be-\nginning of the sample history does not lead to biases.\nAccordingly, the exponential hazard rate for the commu-\nnity spell is determined solely by the Weibull scale function\nand can be written\n(T, + t) = exp{70 + 7' Zc\\ + iiZd (T;\n+ t)}. (7)\nEquation 7 represents the rate at which individuals move to\na nursing home. The parameters to be estimated are y0\n, yi,\n.\nHazard parameters will be biased in maximum likelihood\nestimation if variables have been omitted from the correct\nspecification of the Weibull scale function, even if the\nomitted variables are uncorrelated with those that are in-\ncluded. The shape parameter a will typically be biased\ndownward. Lancaster (1979) proposed a correction for\nomitted variables using a random effect technique: A ran-\ndom effect v is introduced into the likelihood contribution\nof each individual and then integrated out over its probabil-\nity distribution, which was assumed to be unit-mean\nGamma. In our model, this effect represents unobserved\nheterogeneity arising from the fact that available measures\nof functional status and other covariates are unlikely to ac-\ncount fully for risk differentials across individuals.\nHeckman and Singer (1984) showed that biases could\nstill result if the assumption about the probability distribu-\ntion for the random effect is incorrect, and they proposed a\nnonparametric maximum likelihood methodology that pro-\nvides consistent estimates of the hazard parameters. The\nHeckman-Singer approach posits K classes of individuals,\neach with its own scale function intercept. The nursing\nhome hazard scale function for an individual in class k is\nP\u00ab*(T, + 0 = exp {po* + P' Zn\n, + $'\u00a3,,! (T, +1)}. (8)\nThe parameters to be estimated are Pi, p2\n, ex, the (Vs and\nK probabilities /?*, where pk\nis the probability that the indi-\nvidual is in class k. In determining the number of classes\nto use (K) we have followed the procedure of Trussel and\nRichards (1985), which resulted in two classes for the re-\nported model. (Because attempting to control for unob-\nserved heterogeneity introduces the problem of defining a\nstarting time for the sample of community spells, informa-\ntion unavailable in the data files, we did not attempt the\nHeckman-Singer approach for the community hazard.)\nThe central issue in the estimation of T in Equation 1 is\nthe parametrization of i); in a manner that permits its esti-\nmation from the data. The other elements of Equation 1 are\nobtained directly from the Channeling Demonstration eval-\nuation data files (these are the prices of nursing home and\nhome care services that prevail at the individual's site of\nresidence and the usage levels of these services as reported\nin the surveys).\nParametrization of i|i is accomplished by defining the\nhazard functions for the entry of individuals into nursing\nhomes and for their exits to the community as a function of\ntheir home care service use as well as other relevant fixed\nand time-varying characteristics (such as gender and degree\nof functional disability, respectively). Because we are inter-\nested in the transition of living individuals between care\nsettings, the hazards are conditional on survival.\nIn the community hazard the corresponding mean dura-\ntion for a community spell (i.e., the mean length of periods\nspent in the community) is\nn-c\n=i/ec\nporate 2-point Heckman-Singer unobserved heterogeneity\ninto a Weibull specification. For what we will call \"short-\nstayers,\" the scale of the nursing home hazard rate is\npn\n, = exp{poi + Z'n\nwhere Zm and Z\u00ab2\nare vectors of time-invariant and time-\nvarying covariates, respectively, for the nursing home haz-\nard. For \"long-stayers,\" the scale of the nursing home haz-\nard rate is\n+ Z'n\nFixing the values of the covariates in Zn2\nat baseline, the\nmean duration for short-stayers is then\nwhere T(x) is the gamma probability function, whereas for\nlong-stayers the mean duration is\nM\n-\n,\nThe key parameter in Equation 1, \\\\t, which can be\nthought of as an individual's probability of being in nursing\nhome care, or equivalently as the expected proportion of\nher time spent in a nursing home, can now be written as\nIn the hazard for nursing home spells (i.e., the hazard of\nmoving from a nursing home to the community), we incor-\nwhere pt\nis the probability of being a short-stayer and p2\nis\nthe probability of being a long-stayer. This expression now\ngives \\\\i as a function of the parameters of the hazard func-\ntions, which can in turn be estimated consistently from the\nobservations.\nA total of 4,158 individuals who participated in the\nChanneling Demonstration provided information for at\nleast one of the two hazard analyses: 684 people provided\ninformation for the nursing home hazard analyses; they had\nsampling frame. Stays that had already started at the begin-\nning of the sampling time frame, of which there were 25,\nwere dropped from our analyses. A total of 4,109 individu-\nals provided information for the community hazard analy-\ncompleted over the sampling frame. The portion of an ini-\ntial community spell that was covered by the sampling\nframe was included in the community hazard analysis.\nNursing home spells interrupted only by short hospital\nstays (< 30 days) are treated as single spells.\nThe Optimization Analysis\nHaving obtained estimates of the hazard functions' coef-\nficients and expressing \\\\t as a function of the hazard model\ncovariates (including home care utilization), we are in a po-\nsition to treat Equation 1 as an objective function to be\nminimized in terms of home care service levels. The basic\noptimization problem to be solved here is this: for each in-\ndividual, provide additional quantities (weekly hours) of\neach type of home care service (in this study: home nurs-\ning, home health aide, personal care aide, and housekeep-\ning) in such a manner that the expected total long-term care\ncost (Equation 1) for that individual is minimized. Observe\nthat by minimizing cost for each individual, total aggregate\ncost is minimized as well (that is, the optimization problem\nis \"decomposable\" in that it contains no global or cross-\nindividual constraints). Hence the optimization result pro-\nvides information on both optimal service use and expendi-\ntures for each individual, as well as an optimal budget and\noptimal overall service mix for the target population.\nThe objective function for the optimization is Equation 1,\nsolved for each individual. The objective function relates the\noptimization criterion (expected individual long-term care\ncosts) to a set of \"control variables\" (formal home care ser-\nvice levels), which are taken to be determined by a rational\ndecision maker (the optimization algorithm) that acts as a\ncost-minimizing \"case manager,\" so to speak. These are in-\ncorporated in the i|/< through the estimated hazard functions.\nFormally, the optimization problem can be written:\nFor each individual i = 1 , . . . , n\nMinimize T, = I|J,W + (1 - i|i/)G[by assigning the Sv\nSubject to i|i, = i|i, (X, ,S\u00ab) for j = 1, .... ,k (17)\nand Su\nHere, / indexes individuals in the Channeling Demonstra-\ntion control group, which was the target for the simulated\nadditional services. We used the control group because\nit is essentially statistically equivalent to the treatment\ngroup prior to the intervention. Equation 15, as noted, is the\nobjective function to be minimized. N is the prevailing (ob-\nserved average) weekly nursing home charge at the resi-\ndence site of individual /. Equation 16 defines C, as the\nprice-weighted sum of hours of home care services (&,)\nwhere ; indexes service category. That is, C, measures the\nmonthly nominal home care service expenditures for indi-\nvidual /. Equation 17 simply notes that i|;,- is a function of\nindividual services use (S.,) and a vector of individual char-\nacteristics (Xi), via the coefficients from the hazard models.\nInequality 18 limits solutions to ones in which the simula-\ntion can only provide services in addition to those actually\nfound in use prior to the demonstration. Because the rela-\ntionship of iji, to Syis nonlinear, Expressions 15 through 18\ndefine a nonlinear optimization problem to be solved sepa-\nrately for each individual.\nThe constraint given by Expression 18 merits further\ncomment. It requires the optimization to seek only solu-\ntions that do not reduce existing preintervention services.\nThe optimization can (but need not) supplement existing\nservices or initiate them where none are in use, but cannot\nreduce services even where it finds them to be in excess of\nefficient levels. The purpose of this restriction is to con-\nstrain the optimization in the same way that the Channeling\nintervention itself was constrained in seeking its goals; that\nis, to supplement services at the margin of existing use\nprior to the demonstration intervention, but not to seek to\nreduce services already in use (Carcagno & Kemper, 1988).\nFor simplicity of development and notation, we have left\nout of this account the problem that the factor (1 - i|;,) rep-\nresents the probability of being in any survival state other\nthan nursing home care, including being in the hospital. Be-\ncause individuals are not actually using home care services\nwhile hospitalized, the term (1 - i|i/)G would tend to over-\nstate expected home care service costs. In the empirical\nanalyses, (1 - i|/,) has been adjusted for hospital use in the\nsame manner as we have described previously in this jour-\nnal (Greene et al., 1995). We solved the resource allocation\noptimization problem using the IMSL nonlinear program-\nming solver.\nData\nData are from the public use files of the Channeling\nDemonstration (Carcagno & Kemper, 1988). These remain,\nunfortunately, by far the best data available for fine-grained\nlongitudinal long-term care service use information for a\nlarge, reasonably representative sample of frail older peo-\nple. The demonstration primarily sought to determine\nwhether the provision of additional home care services\nwould reduce nursing home use, and thereby overall long-\nterm care costs, in a frail older population.\nThe Channeling Demonstration study sample was a tar-\nsenting considerable geographic and socioeconomic diver-\nsity (the sites were Baltimore; Houston; Cleveland; Miami;\nPhiladelphia; an eight-county region in Eastern Kentucky; a\ntwo-county region in Southern Maine; Middlesex County,\nNew Jersey; Rensselaer County, New York; and Greater\nLynn, Massachusetts). The demonstration enrolled persons\nwho were relatively old, frail, and with modest or low in-\ncome. Persons who applied for its programs were screened\nto be age 65 or older, substantially impaired in functional\ncapacity, and to have some degree of unmet need in impor-\ntant functional areas. Those participants enrolled while in\nnursing home care were further required to be deemed good\nprospects for discharge within 90 days.\nThose screened into the demonstration were randomly\nassigned to either a control group, for whom no interven-\ntion was provided through the demonstration, or to one of\ntwo treatment conditions: \"basic\" and \"financial control.\"\nThose at the basic sites were offered case management as-\nsistance in obtaining and using existing, nondemonstration\nservices, but no funds to purchase additional services were\nprovided. At the financial control sites, however, case man-\nagers had the authority to purchase additional home care\nservices for treatment of group members.\nWe are interested in comparing the cost-containment per-\nformance of our optimization model (which is permitted to\nallocate new supplemental resources where it finds they can\nsufficiently reduce expected nursing home use) to that of\nthe Channeling Demonstration's financial control interven-\ntion, which, as noted, was likewise permitted to purchase\nsupplemental services where case managers judged them to\nbe justified in terms of the project's objectives. These ob-\njectives were intended to include reduction of nursing home\nuse and consequent overall long-term care cost containment\nas a primary goal.\nOf the 6,326 persons initially enrolled in the Channeling\nDemonstration, 4,158 had complete nursing home use his-\ntories over their survival period within the demonstration's\nfirst 12 months of operation and were used in this study (al-\nthough half of the survivors at 12 months were followed for\nan additional 6 months, the absence of consistent measure-\nment on some data during this period led us to exclude\nthese latter observations). We used these 4,158 individuals\nin estimating our hazard coefficients, and then used the sub-\nset of 1,517 individuals in the demonstration's randomized\ncontrol groups as our target population for the optimization\nanalysis. In this way, we make use of all available informa-\ntion to estimate marginal effects, but provide simulated\nsupplemental services through the optimization to a popula-\ntion essentially the same in its characteristics as the one ini-\ntially encountered and targeted for supplemental services\nby the demonstration intervention itself.\nHazard-Model Specification and Measurement Issues\nCovariates included in the hazard models, which are\nspecified symmetrically, include indicator variables for\nbeing African American, Hispanic American, male, or a\nhomeowner; living alone; being severely impaired or worse\nin activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of\ndaily living (IADL), and cognition; using a wheelchair; and\nwhether the individual was a treatment group member at ei-\nther a basic or financial control site in the Channeling\nDemonstration. Continuous or ordered categorical covari-\nates include age (in years), area nursing home bed supply\nmonthly income, self-perceived health (on a scale of 1 to 4,\nwhere 1 = excellent, 4 = poor), and number of surviving\nchildren. Finally, and most central to our interest, are mea-\nsures of weekly hours of use of the major categories of\nhome care services provided by the demonstration: home\nnursing service, home health aide service, personal care\naide service, and housekeeper service. Means and standard\ndeviations for these covariates can be found in Table 1.\nOf these covariates, the home care services levels and\nfunctional impairment in ADL and IADL were time varying\n(measured at the 6- and 12-month survey intervals of the\ndemonstration) and are incorporated as time-varying co-\nvariates in our hazard models. Inconsistencies in the survey\nover time in measuring cognitive impairment required us to\nkeep this variable fixed at its baseline value.\nAs noted, impairment and health-related variables in-\nclude dummy indicators of whether each individual was\nseverely impaired in ADL, IADL, or cognition, or if she\nused a wheelchair. In the surveys, functional status in ADL\nand IADL was measured in several areas (eating, transfer,\ndressing, bathing, and toileting for ADL; meal preparation,\nhousework, shopping, travel, medication use, money man-\nagement, and telephone use for IADL). In each area of\nfunctioning, respondents were scored from 0 to 2, with 0\nindicating severe impairment (complete dependence), 1 in-\ndicating moderate impairment (needs some help), and 2 in-\ndicating independence. For the IADL dummy variable used\nhere, these scores were summed, and individuals with total\nscores between 0 and 3 (the most impaired third of the sam-\nple) were coded 1; the others were coded 0. For ADL, the\nrange 0 to 2 was coded to 1, producing a similar split.\nCognitive impairment was assessed by the Simple Port-\nable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ; see Pfeiffer,\nTable 1.

The nursing home bed rate, as a\nproxy for bed availability, was expected to positively influ-\nence nursing home use.\nThe home care service variables consist of survey esti-\nmates (measured in hours per week) of formal community\nservices received by each individual in the sample. We\nmeasured four categories of community service: home\nnursing, home health aides, personal care aides, and house-\nkeepers. These represent the vast majority (over 90%) of\nthe total in-home services reported to be actually consumed\nby the sample. Other categories (e.g., physical therapy)\nwere not used with sufficient frequency to permit reliable\nstatistical estimation of their effects.\nIn the hazard models, services are entered interacted with\nthose client impairment indicators that were expected to be\nsubstantial predictors of differential impact for that service\non nursing home risk. Thus wheelchair use, often correlated\nin an older population with severe frailty and more medical\nneeds, is interacted with nursing hours. Severe cognitive\nimpairment seemed likely to be best dealt with by staff with\ntraining at least equivalent to that of nursing home patient\ncare aides to whom home health aides are generally compa-\nrable; hence the interaction between cognitive impairment\nand home health aide service. A similar rationale applies for\npersonal care aides, who deal primarily with ADL deficits,\nand for housekeepers, who deal mainly with aspects of\nIADL limitation. The interaction terms are entered symmet-\nrically for both the presence and absence of severe func-\ntional limitation, except for the interaction of the absence of\nsevere cognitive impairment with home health aide hours\nand the absence of severe ADL limitations with personal\ncare aide hours. The inclusion of these two terms intro-\nduced collinearity effects into the sampling stability of the\nother coefficients (mainly because few individuals actually\nused more than one type of service over a given period)\nwithout themselves being statistically significant. Hence,\nthey were dropped from the estimation. Obviously, with\nmultiple services that may be interactive, both among\nthemselves (where use levels of one service may influence\nthe marginal impact of another) and with other client char-\nacteristics than those which we included, more elaborate\nspecifications, as noted, are possible and reasonable. But\nour experience with these specifications using the Channel-\ning Demonstration data was that collinearity problems in\ntheir estimation became so prevalent that it seems likely\nthat experimental rather than observational studies will be\nnecessary to pursue these more complex specifications.\nInformation on formally supplied services in the Chan-\nneling data set is drawn from surveys administered at base-\nline and again at the sixth month and twelfth month of the\ndemonstration. Both the timing and the measurement pro-\ncedures for these services introduce complications and\npotentially significant limitations in the data. The survey in-\nstrument used retrospective questioning that required par-\nticipants to recall the total hours and types of services re-\nceived from all formal sources during the previous week of\ncommunity residence. Because of the retrospective nature\nof the questioning, it was necessary for our purposes (as\nwell as for the Channeling Demonstration's original evalua-\ntion) to assume that the \"snapshot\" of service hours re-\nported at the time of the 6-month survey is representative of\nthe actual hours received in Months 1 through 6. Similarly,\ninformation reported at the 12-month survey is imputed to\nMonths 7 through 12. See Corson, Granneman, Holden, &\nThornton (1986, Appendix B) for a fuller discussion of the\nmeasurement and typology of home care service used in the\nChanneling Demonstration.\nAn individual in a nursing home at a point in time is not\nconsuming community services. What is at issue in predict-\ning her transition to the community is what services are\navailable to her in the community at that time. We do not\nhave direct measures of such \"potential\" services. For indi-\nviduals who exited nursing homes during the study period,\nwe took the services they were found to be receiving at the\nnext survey point (after exit) to be representative of what\nwas available to them during the preceding period of insti-\ntutionalization. For individuals in the sample who began\nthe study period in nursing homes and did not exit alive, we\nhave (of course) no data on community service use during\nthe study period (such individuals represent about 25% of\nthose initially in nursing homes--about 2% of the sample\noverall). For these persons, their baseline report of home\ncare service use (as reported by them or by their survey\nproxy) at the time of their most recent nursing home admis-\nsion was used as an estimate for services available. Individ-\nuals who had been in a nursing home more than two\nmonths at baseline, and for whom survey recall error by\nthemselves or by their proxy respondents was thus likely to\nbe excessive, were excluded from the analysis.\nFor cost data, site-specific average costs experienced by\nthe 20% subsample for whom provider record extracts were\nobtained were used to estimate the community service and\nnursing home prices faced by individuals at that site (see\nThornton, Dunston, & Kemper, 1988). The hourly cost (in\ncosts ranged from $7 to $33, with a mean of $16; personal\nmean of $7.20; and housekeeper hourly costs ranged from\nnoted that sites varied widely in geographical region and\ndegree of urbanization and, hence, in service prices.\nRESULTS\nResults From Estimating the Hazard Functions\nThe Nursing Home Hazard.--Hazard function results are\nreported in Tables 2 and 3. We turn first to the hazard for\nnursing home exit, which was estimated allowing for unob-\nserved heterogeneity using the procedure developed by\nTrussell and Richards (1985) for applying the Heckman-\nSinger model, as noted earlier: individuals may belong to\none of up to several classes with respect to the hazard (and,\nhence, with respect to expected duration of nursing home\nstays). To determine the number of classes K of individuals,\nTrussell and Richards proposed starting with a single class\nand then adding classes incrementally until the resulting\nlog-likelihood improvement falls to less than unity.\nFollowing this approach, we found two discernible\nclasses of individuals, which we descriptively termed short-\nstayers and long-stayers. The empirical results for the\nsingle-class model (simple Weibull) and the two-class\nmodel (Weibull with 2-point heterogeneity) are presented in\nTable 2. Adding a third class (in fact, we tested up to ten\nclasses) resulted in negligible increase in the log-likelihood.\nThe bias for a when the effects of omitted variables are\nnot controlled is apparent from Table 2. With a single class,\na = 0.793 (indicating negative duration dependence), but a\nmoves up to 1.048 when a second class is added. In fact,\nthe second value is insignificantly different from unity at\nthe 5% level (the standard error is .0793), implying that we\ncannot reject the hypothesis that the true nursing home haz-\nard is just a structurally time-varying exponential, that is, a\nconstant holding pnk\nfixed.\nThe coefficients on the nonservice covariates, which in-\nterpret the change in the log-hazard due to a unit change in\nthe covariate, are generally consistent with expectations\nand with earlier work and will not be considered in detail\nCoward, Home, & Peek, 1995; Coward, Netzer, & Mul-\nCrucially, all coefficients for the service variables are\npositive, indicating that higher levels of each service, other\nthings equal, are associated with a greater likelihood of re-\nturn to the community. The coefficients involving home\nnursing services are notably larger than those for other ser-\nvices. Notable also is that higher levels of impairment in\nADL, IADL, and cognitive functioning and poorer self-\nrated health are all associated with lower chance of return\nto the community. Being at a demonstration site with\ngreater bed supply significantly decreases the chance of dis-\ncharge to the community, whereas being in a treatment\ngroup at a financial control site and having higher income\nincrease the chance.\nThe Community Hazard.--Turning to the hazard for\nnursing home entry (Table 3), one sees that all service coef-\nficients are negative, indicating again, as one would expect,\nthat higher levels of services, other things being equal, are\nassociated with a lower risk of nursing home admission.\nTable 2. Hazard Function Coefficient Estimates for Transitions\nFrom Nursing Home to Community\nModel I\nSimple\nWeibull\nModel II\nWeibull With\nHeterogeneity\nCognitive impairment\nAgain, the marginal effect of home nursing services consid-\nerably exceeds that of other services. With respect to the\nother covariates, being Hispanic or African American,\nbeing a homeowner, having a larger number of surviving\nchildren, and being in a Channeling Demonstration treat-\nment group are all associated with a significantly lower risk\nof nursing home admission. Conversely, living alone, being\nseverely impaired in IADL, ADL, or cognitive functioning,\nand being in an area with a greater nursing home bed sup-\nply are all associated with greater risk of admission. All\nthese findings are generally consistent with existing find-\nings in the literature cited previously. Anomalies are wheel-\nchair use (associated significantly with lower risk of ad-\nmission) and better self-rated health (associated with higher\nadmission risk), for which various post hoc hypotheses\nmight be advanced.\nThe fact that the service coefficients have the appropriate\nsigns ensures that the objective function for the optimiza-\ntion will be strictly convex and thus the optimization algo-\nrithm will converge to a true global optimum (here, mini-\nmum cost).\nResults of the Optimization\nAlthough all 4,158 cases with complete data in the Chan-\nneling Demonstration public use data files were used as our\nanalysis sample in estimating the hazard rate coefficients,\nthe problem of interest in the optimization turns on the re-\nsponses of individuals in the demonstration population as\nthey were found prior to the effects of the demonstration in-\ntervention itself. Thus, results reported are based on the\nTable 3. Hazard Function Coefficient Estimates for Transitions\nFrom Community to Nursing Home\nModel III\nExponential\nHome health X cognitive impairment -0.039*\nCognitive impairment (1 = severe or worse) 0.297**\nTreatment group/financial control site -0.054\n1,517 persons in our analysis sample who belonged to the\ndemonstration control groups; that is, those participants who\ndid not receive services from the demonstration, but who\nwere essentially statistically equivalent to those who did.\nCost reduction results (costs are in 1982 dollars), al-\nthough not dramatic--as one would expect given that the\noptimization prohibits any reductions in existing cost-inef-\nficient home care service use--are nevertheless substantial.\nBecause of the constraint given in expression 18, cost re-\nductions are possible only through increasing home care\nservice levels in cases where resulting reductions in ex-\npected nursing home use are more than sufficient to offset\nthe costs of the services. Table 4 shows that the optimum\nservice allocation was found to reduce expected total week-\nly expenditures for long-term care overall in this population\nThis was, we emphasize, achieved by targeted additions to\nexisting, nondemonstration home care services already\nbeing received, resulting in an increase in weekly home\n$63,110) in expected weekly nursing home expenditures\nthat resulted from this increased use of home care services.\nThese results are of particular interest in comparison to the\nChanneling Demonstration itself, which also attempted to re-\nduce overall long-term care costs through targeted additions\nof home care services, but was unable to break even. Also\npresented in Table 4 for comparison are cost data from the\ndemonstration's financial control site treatment groups mea-\nsured six months from baseline and scaled for group size to\nbe comparable to the control group data (see also Brown &\nPhillips, 1986). By comparing these data to those observed\nfor the control group, we see that the demonstration in-\ncreased overall long-term care costs substantially (by about\n12%) because its decrease in nursing home costs (relative to\nthe control group) was more than offset by its large increase\nin home care expenditures (about 61%). In short, when effi-\nciently allocated, the optimal home care expenditure level\nachieved a greater reduction in expected nursing home ex-\npenditures, while spending only about half as much on addi-\ntional home care services as did the Channeling Demonstra-\ntion's financial control intervention.\nTable 4.

In ancil-\nlary analyses not reported here, the optimization was found\nto give relatively more resources than the actual demonstra-\ntion did to those who were older, who lived alone, who\nwere more grievously impaired in ADL, IADL, or cogni-\ntion, and who lived in areas with greater numbers of nurs-\ning home beds per person over age 65. Not surprisingly,\nthese are all characteristics associated with greater nursing\nhome risk, the reduction of which was the only way that the\noptimization could recover its home care costs. On the\nother hand, the optimization tends to give relatively fewer\nadditional resources to minorities, men, homeowners, those\nwith better self-reported health, those with higher income,\nand those with more surviving children. The relative ne-\nglect of persons with these characteristics in turn reflects\nlow relative prior nursing home risk and, therefore, fewer\nopportunities to generate larger risk reductions in response\nto additional home care services.\nAlthough technically explicable, the finding of a relative\ndisinclination of the optimization algorithm to provide ad-\nditional services to African and Hispanic Americans is po-\ntentially troubling on social equity grounds (cf. Greene &\nMonahan, 1984). Arguably, the model should be made\n\"blind\" to racial and ethnic considerations by constraining\nthese coefficients in the objective function to be zero. The\nloss in underwriting efficiency resulting from such a con-\nstraint is a matter for future research.\nThe reductions in cost achieved by the optimum alloca-\ntion reflect not only retargeting of services as a function of\nindividual characteristics, but also entail a fairly radical cor-\nresponding alteration in the aggregate mix of services being\nprovided. This is evident in Table 5, where a comparison of\nthe distribution of service hours by type for the Channeling\nDemonstration's financial control intervention with that for\nthe control group shows that the demonstration increased\nhours used in all service types, but by far increased them\nmost dramatically in personal care services. Already the\nmost popular service type before the intervention, the\ndemonstration more than doubled its utilization, greatly in-\ncreasing its relative share of the portfolio of services.\nAlthough the optimum allocation also differs from the\npreintervention service hours distribution, it does so very\ndifferently than the Channeling Demonstration did. The op-\ntimization produces a dramatic (almost fourfold) increase\nin home nursing hours, with modest increases in home\nService Type\nNursing\nHome health aide\nPersonal care aide\nHousekeeper\nTotal Hours of Service Per Week by Type\nCompared by Allocation Regime\nBaseline\nControl\nGroup\nService Hours Used\nOptimum\nChanneling\nFinancial\nControl\nhealth aide and housekeeper hours. Notably, the optimiza-\ntion does not increase personal care service hours at all.\nThat is, the cost-minimizing changes are virtually opposite\nthose implemented by the Channeling Demonstration.\nThese patterns are similar to those found in our earlier stud-\nies, though they are less pronounced due to the optimiza-\ntion being more constrained in this study in that it could not\nreduce preexisting consumption (Greene et al., 1995).\nIf one considers the incidence of use (the percentage of a\ngroup that actually uses services), one sees in Table 6 a\nsimilar pattern. Compared to the control group at baseline,\nthe financial control intervention increased incidence of use\nfor all services except housekeeping, but with the most dra-\nmatic absolute increase being in personal care aide services\nagain in contrast to the cost-minimizing solution, where\nhome nursing saw the most dramatic incidence increase--\nvery modest.\nOur optimization model, in seeking to reduce overall\nlong-term care costs, might be said to produce a more\n\"medicalized\" model of home care than that which was ac-\ntually found in place prior to the Channeling Demonstration\nand further implemented through the demonstration. This\nresult may seem surprising in view of the higher relative\nprices of service by health care providers, but it arises be-\ncause home nursing hours have a greater marginal impact\non expected nursing home use for many individuals than do\nhours of the lower level (and lower priced) services, there-\nby being better able to offset the cost of their use; that is,\nthey give more \"bang for the buck\" in many cases, despite\ntheir higher unit cost.\nTo guard against the risk that the relatively much larger\nmarginal effects of home nursing might simply reflect sam-\npling instability in the estimation process, the optimization\nwas rerun with the home nursing coefficients in each hazard\nreduced by one standard error and the other coefficients in-\ncreased by one standard error. The results were similar to\nthose reported here, though the rerun optimization pro-\nduced a less dramatic increase in use of home nursing and\nslightly larger expansions of home health aide and house-\nkeeper services. Notably, personal care aide services were\nagain never increased.\nThese findings should not be entirely unexpected, not-\nwithstanding widespread concerns about the cost implica-\ntions of \"medicalizing\" home care. Nursing hours generally\nTable 6.

Further, home nursing services represent a substi-\ntute for higher level nursing home services; services that\nare required for precisely the sort of needs that, if unmet in\nthe community, would most rapidly force an individual into\nnursing home care and that are the most difficult to obtain\nfrom nonprofessional (e.g., family) sources.\nObviously, people use home care services for many pur-\nposes other than trying to reduce their risk of nursing home\nuse and net long-term care costs--for example, improving\nor maintaining their quality of life in the community. But\nfor the case managers at the financial control sites in the\nChanneling Demonstration, who had as a specific goal re-\nducing long-term care costs through deterring nursing\nhome use, the overwhelming tendency to use their case-\nmanagement resources and service budgets to provide a\nlarger volume of cheaper, lower level services (mainly per-\nsonal care services), while providing proportionately much\nless additional home nursing, may have been an unfortu-\nnate approach from a cost-containment standpoint.\nIn comparing our results for the optimum allocation, in\nwhich overall long-term care costs (costs for nursing home\nuse and direct home care services) were reduced 10% from\ntheir preexisting levels, with the performance of the compa-\nrable Channeling Demonstration financial control interven-\ntion (under which these costs on average increased 12%), it\nappears that a more stringently targeted and more medically\noriented model of intervention would have better served the\ngoals of reducing nursing home use and long-term care costs.\nDISCUSSION\nOur results clearly support the case for the potential cost-\neffectiveness of substantially expanding budgets for home\ncare services. The optimization itself increased preexisting\nhome care expenditures by over 30%, but reduced expected\ntotal costs through reducing expected nursing home use.\nIn considering such an expansion, however, two essential\npoints should be kept in mind. First, services must be tar-\ngeted much more effectively to those at higher risk than was\nthe case in the Channeling Demonstration, perhaps through\nusing more powerful statistical models. And second,\nnotwithstanding current enthusiasm and advocacy for per-\nsonal care services, quite possibly justified in terms of the\nability of such services to improve the quality of life at home\nfor frail older people, we must not overlook the fact that sig-\nnificant expansion of their use, at the expense of possible ex-\npansion of other services, does not seem justified in terms of\ncost containment or potential to reduce nursing home use.\nIn view of the complexity of even simple analyses of the\nprocess by which long-term care costs arise (this study is an\nexample), one possible means of improving case manage-\nment decision making with respect to cost containment for\nhome care service allocation may be through a computer-\nized decision support system, for which the type of method-\nology used here might serve as a prototype. Such consider-\nations might be especially important in administering home\ncare services within a managed care framework, where effi-\nciency is essential.\n"
