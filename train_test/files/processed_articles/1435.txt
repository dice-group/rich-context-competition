Caraballo,1 Gary A. Giovino,2 Terry F. Pechacek,1 and Paul D. Mowery3\nThe discrepancy between cigarette smoking status reported during an interview and measured level of serum\ncotinine, a nicotine biomarker, was investigated in a representative sample of the US population aged 17 years\n(N = 15,357). Data were collected from participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\ncotinine level less than or equal to 15.0 ng/ml, the selected cutoff point for identifying nonsmokers. Age (p <\n0.01), race/ethnicity (p < 0.01), and average number of cigarettes smoked per day (p < 0.01) were associated\nwith these discrepant findings. Among self-reported nonsmokers, 1.4% (95% confidence interval: 1.1, 1.7) had\na serum cotinine level greater than 15.0 ng/ml, the selected cutoff point for identifying smokers. Race/ethnicity\n(p < 0.01), education (p < 0.01), number of household members who smoked in the home (p = 0.03), and self-\nreported smoking status from an earlier home interview (p < 0.01) were associated with these discrepant\nfindings. Differences in smoking patterns, including the extent of nicotine dosing, may explain most of the\ndiscrepancy observed among self-reported smokers, whereas deception regarding smoking status may explain\nmost of the discrepancy among self-reported nonsmokers.

Such self-\nreports may be suspect, however, because participants may\nbe unwilling to admit to a health or social behavior that\nmany perceive to be undesirable. Studies comparing self-\nreported smoking status with concentrations of biochemical\nmarkers of tobacco consumption (e.g., nicotine, cotinine,\ncarbon monoxide, carboxyhemoglobin, and thiocyanate)\nhave generally found self-reports to be good indicators of\nactual smoking status (1\u00ad5), although in some populations\nself-reports may underestimate the actual prevalence of cig-\narette smoking by up to 4 percent (1, 2, 6). Factors that may\naffect the accuracy of self-reports include age (7), race/\nethnicity (2, 3, 8), education (2, 3), smoking history (2), and\nthe presence or absence of a disease known to be linked with\nsmoking (9). Identifying factors that contribute to misclassi-\nfication of self-reported smokers and nonsmokers could\nallow more accurate estimates of smoking prevalence.\nBiochemical markers of tobacco consumption vary in sen-\nsitivity (biochemical measures lose sensitivity at lower levels\nof smoking), specificity, and difficulty of analysis (3\u00ad5,\n10\u00ad12). Overall, studies comparing nonsmokers (exposed or\nunexposed to environmental tobacco smoke) with active\nsmokers (13\u00ad19) have consistently found that measurement\nof cotinine in serum can distinguish active smokers from non-\nsmokers. However, the concentration distributions for occa-\nsional smokers and nonsmokers exposed to environmental\ntobacco smoke have been found to overlap (20), exposing one\nlimitation of the use of serum cotinine concentration as a gold\nstandard. Nicotine is the best marker of tobacco exposure,\nbecause this biomarker is relatively unique to tobacco, but its\nhalf-life is short (2\u00ad3 hours) (21). Cotinine is a primary\nmetabolite of nicotine, and it has an average half-life of 18\u00ad20\nhours (21); thus, it can be used to accurately assess a person's\nexposure to tobacco--whether through passive exposure (i.e.,\nto environmental tobacco smoke) or through active use.\nIndeed, serum cotinine concentration has been widely used as\na biomarker in studies assessing exposure to tobacco (20,\n22\u00ad27). The National Center for Environmental Health\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) recently devel-\noped a highly sensitive measurement method for detecting\nserum cotinine concentrations as low as 0.05 ng/ml (28).\nWe explored in depth discrepancies between self-reported\nsmoking status and measured serum cotinine concentrations.\nWe used data collected from persons aged 17 years or older in\nthe United States who participated in the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).\nNHANES III was a nationwide household survey that\ncollected health and nutritional information from a repre-\nsentative sample of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized\npopulation aged 2 months or older (29). The survey, which\ncarried out in the participant's home (including questions on\ntobacco use and exposure), followed by a standardized\nphysical examination and an additional questionnaire on\ntobacco use administered in specially equipped mobile\nexamination centers (MECs).\nSubject selection\nwere selected to participate in the survey; 4,180 refused the\ninterview, and 2,345 were interviewed at home but did not visit\nthe MEC. For our study, we excluded 2,348 persons because\nthey either did not answer the questionnaire on tobacco use,\nhad no cotinine measurement, or reported having had exposure\nto significant sources of nicotine other than cigarettes in the\nprevious 5 days. Thus, our study consisted of 15,357 persons\naged 17 years or older. Children and adolescents aged 8\u00ad16\nyears were excluded because of methodological issues in using\nbiomarkers to assess active smoking among persons initiating\nor experimenting with cigarette use (7).\nDemographic classification\nDemographic information was collected during the in-home\ninterview. We classified our study participants by sex, age\nHispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, or Mexican-American),\nmarital status (married or not married), and education (0\u00ad8,\nwas based on a measure developed by the US Census Bureau\n(30) in which members of families having annual incomes\nequal to or greater than the poverty threshold were categorized\nas \"at or above poverty level\" and those having annual\nincomes below the poverty threshold were categorized as\n\"below poverty level.\" Body mass index, which is commonly\nused to assess obesity, was computed as body weight (in kilo-\ngrams) divided by the square of height (in meters). Obesity\nFor determination of environmental tobacco smoke expo-\nsure in the home, one member of the household (usually the\nhead of the family or his/her spouse) was asked, \"Does anyone\nwho lives here smoke cigarettes in the home?\" If the answer\nwas yes, the interviewer asked who it was. When that house-\nhold member was identified, every other member of the house-\nhold was classified as being exposed to environmental tobacco\nsmoke at home. We categorized the number of household mem-\nbers who smoked cigarettes at home as zero, one, or two or\nmore. One of the family members was asked how many rooms\nwere in the home, excluding bathrooms. We categorized the\nnumber of rooms as 1\u00ad4 rooms and five or more rooms.\nWe created a variable to capture the presence of a\ntobacco-related disease. Participants who reported that they\nhad ever been told by a doctor that they had a stroke, a heart\nattack, congestive heart failure, emphysema, chronic bron-\nchitis, or a smoking-related cancer were categorized as hav-\ning a smoking-related disease. All others were categorized\nas not having such a disease.\nParticipants who reported having a job or business were\nasked how many hours per day they were close enough to\ntobacco smoke at work that they could smell the smoke. We\nclassified the number of hours exposed to environmental\ntobacco smoke at work as 0, 1\u00ad3, and 4 or more hours.\nAn average of 2 weeks elapsed from the time of the in-\nhome interview to the time of physical examination and\nadministration of the additional tobacco-use questionnaire.\nTo take into account potential changes in smoking status\nbetween the household interview and the medical examina-\ntion, we created a variable in which participants were iden-\ntified as never, former, or current smokers by their smoking\nstatus in the household interview. In the household ques-\ntionnaire, respondents were asked if they had smoked at\nleast 100 cigarettes during their lifetime. Those who\nanswered \"no\" were classified as never smokers. Those who\nanswered \"yes\" were then asked if they were currently\nsmoking cigarettes. Respondents who answered \"no\" to this\nquestion were classified as former smokers, and respondents\nwho answered \"yes\" were classified as current smokers.\nCigarette smoking status\nThe tobacco-use questionnaire, administered by an inter-\nviewer in the MEC, asked participants, \"How many cigarettes\nhave you smoked in the past 5 days?\" In our study, we defined\nsmokers as persons who reported smoking at least one ciga-\nrette in the previous 5 days. We calculated the average num-\nber of cigarettes smoked per day for those who had smoked\none cigarette or more in the previous 5 days. In this study, we\nrefer to nonsmokers as persons who reported that they had not\nsmoked during the 5 days prior to the MEC interview. This\nstudy did not use a \"bogus pipeline\" strategy to increase the\naccuracy of self-reports; however, given that the NHANES III\nsurvey was not tobacco-specific, each participant was informed\nthat his or her blood specimen was going to be tested for\nnumerous components (i.e., hematologic assessments, dietary\nintake, biochemistry profile, cotinine level, and other factors).\nSerum cotinine measurement\nBiochemical determination of tobacco exposure was per-\nformed by measuring serum cotinine level in blood speci-\nSelf-Reports on Smoking vs. Serum Cotinine Levels 809\nmens obtained by venipuncture in the MEC. The biochemi-\ncal assay involved isotope dilution, liquid chromatography,\nand tandem mass spectrometry (28).\nIn a previous analysis of NHANES III data, Pirkle et al.\n(20) found that for respondents aged 4 years or older, serum\ncotinine level was bimodally distributed for tobacco users\nand nonusers, with little overlap. This separation occurred at\nto use a cotinine cutoff point of >15.0 ng/ml to designate\nsmokers and 15.0 ng/ml to designate nonsmokers.\nStatistical analysis\nLogistic regression analysis was used to examine the rela-\ntions between serum cotinine level and self-reported smok-\ning status. Two types of models based on different subsets of\nthe NHANES III data were estimated. We fitted a model\nusing data from all respondents who indicated in the MEC\ninterview that they were smokers--i.e., that they had\nsmoked at least one cigarette during the previous 5 days.\nThe binary outcome for this model was set equal to 1 if a\nrespondent was biochemically classified as a nonsmoker\n(serum cotinine level 15.0 ng/ml). The second model was\nbased on data from all respondents who indicated in the\nMEC interview that they were nonsmokers--i.e., that they\nhad not smoked during the previous 5 days. The binary out-\ncome for this second model was set equal to 1 if a respon-\ndent was biochemically classified as a smoker (serum coti-\nWe included in the logistic regression models variables to\naccount for the stratification and multistage design of\nNHANES III.

Survey weights were used to account\nfor different probabilities of selection within strata.\nThe covariates included those shown in tables 4 and 5.\nAdditional covariates that we examined and rejected\nincluded poverty status, obesity, exposure to environmental\ntobacco smoke at work, and number of rooms in the house.\nFor self-reported smokers, number of cigarettes smoked per\nday was categorized in various ways.

These cutpoints corresponded to\ncigarettes smoked during the previous 5 days.\nBivariate tables were used to examine the strength of the\nassociation between each covariate and disagreement of bio-\nchemical and self-reported smoking status. We fitted logis-\ntic regression models that included all possible combina-\ntions of the covariates. Covariates were added and deleted\nfrom the models until we found models that best character-\nized the disagreement patterns and produced stable log odds\nratios. We did not include interactions between covariates in\nany of the models, because of small sample sizes. Finally,\nself-reported smoking status ascertained during the house-\nhold interview was used only as a covariate. It was not used\nto calculate misclassification.\nRESULTS\nStudy population\nCompared with self-reported smokers, self-reported non-\nsmokers comprised a higher proportion of persons who were\nfemale, were aged 65 years or older, had 13 or more years of\neducation, and did not live below the poverty level (table 1).\nAgreement analysis\nAmong self-reported smokers, 92.5 percent were also bio-\nchemically classified as smokers (serum cotinine level >15.0\nTABLE 1.

Of the self-reported smokers with serum\ncotinine levels less than or equal to 15.0 ng/ml, 87.5 percent\nsmoked an average of fewer than five cigarettes per day\n(data not shown).\nWe found an average discrepancy of 1.4 percent among\nself-reported nonsmokers (range: from 0.6 percent for\nMexican Americans to 3.1 percent for persons with 0\u00ad8\nyears of education) (table 3). Persons aged 65 years or older,\nBlacks, and persons with 0\u00ad8 years of education had a dis-\ncrepancy of 2.0 percent or higher.\nIn the final model for self-reported smokers, after simul-\ntaneous adjustment for several selected characteristics, we\nfound that younger persons were more likely than persons\naged 65 years, and Blacks were less likely than Whites, to\nbe in discrepancy with results from biochemical assessment\n(table 4). The average number of cigarettes smoked per day\nin the past 5 days was inversely and highly associated with\nthe probability of discrepancy. The presence or absence of a\nsmoking-related disease was not associated with the proba-\nbility of discrepancy in this study.\nIn the final model for self-reported nonsmokers, after\nsimultaneous adjustment for several selected characteristics,\nwe found that discrepancy with the results of biochemical\nassessment was more likely among Blacks than among\nWhites, less likely among Mexican Americans than among\nWhites, less likely among persons with 12 years of educa-\ntion than among persons with 0\u00ad8 years of education, and\nmore likely among persons who reported two or more smok-\ners living in the home than among persons who reported no\nsmokers living in the home (table 5). Persons who were\nclassified as former smokers or current smokers (according\nto the household interview) and who reported not smoking\nin the previous 5 days (during the MEC visit) were more\nlikely to be in discrepancy than those who were classified as\nnever smokers.\nDISCUSSION\nThe results of our study indicate that self-report smoking\nand biochemical measurement of serum cotinine concentra-\ntion give approximately the same overall estimates of smok-\ning prevalence. Most validity studies regarding smoking\nhave concentrated on deception among self- reported non-\nsmokers (i.e., cessation studies), but we found a higher over-\nall discrepancy between self-reports and serum cotinine lev-\nels among self-reported smokers (7.5 percent) than among\nself-reported nonsmokers (1.4 percent).\nWe can postulate several explanations for the observed\ndiscrepancy between self-reports and the biochemical mea-\nsures among self-reported smokers. First, because the half-\nlife of cotinine in the blood is 18\u00ad20 hours, the serum coti-\nnine levels of smokers who do not smoke every day or who\nsmoke only a few cigarettes per day will be more likely to\ndrop to 15.0 ng/ml in a shorter period of time than those of\nsmokers who smoke a greater amount of cigarettes.\nApproximately 34.7 percent of smokers who reported smok-\ning an average of fewer than five cigarettes per day in the\nprevious 5 days had a serum cotinine level less than or equal\nto 15.0 ng/ml. About one third of those who smoked fewer\nthan five cigarettes per day can be considered occasional\nsmokers (less than one cigarette per day). Occasional smok-\ners, in particular, did not smoke daily; they smoked just a\nfew cigarettes per day when they did smoke, and the num-\nber of cigarettes they smoked per day probably varied\ngreatly. It is possible that for occasional smokers, serum\ncotinine concentration either never reached levels of >15.0\nng/ml or reached low levels (15.0 ng/ml) by the time the\nblood was drawn during the physical examination.\nUnfortunately, no data were collected about when the last\ncigarette was smoked. Recency of use is now measured in\nTABLE 2.

Thus,\ndeception seems unlikely.\nThird, despite the observations of Pirkle et al. (20), the\nselected cotinine cutoff point of >15.0 ng/ml may be too\nhigh to identify all smokers. When we reanalyzed the data\nng/ml for nonsmokers, the discrepancy for self-reported\nsmokers dropped from 7.5 percent to 6.3 percent but the\noverall results for predictors of discrepancy did not change.\nPrevious studies that have measured cotinine levels in the\nng/ml, to detect active smoking (15, 34\u00ad38). We did not cal-\nculate a receiver operating characteristic curve to choose the\ncutoff that maximized sensitivity and specificity, because\nthe receiver operating characteristic curve may be affected\nby inaccurate self-reported smoking information. A receiver\noperating characteristic curve is a graph of sensitivity (the\ntrue-positive fraction) against the complement of specificity\n(the false-positive fraction) for all possible cutoff points\nPrevious studies have found that, in the United States,\nBlacks have higher serum cotinine levels than Whites do at\nTABLE 3.

Among\nself-reported smokers, our finding of lower discrepancy\namong Blacks than among Whites is consistent with these\nreports. It is possible that different cutoff points for cotinine\nconcentration may be needed for Blacks and Whites. This\nissue should be studied further; differences in the character-\nistics of the cigarettes smoked, smoking topography, or the\npharmacokinetics of nicotine should be considered (43).\nInformation about differences in serum cotinine concentra-\ntions between Whites or Blacks and Mexican Americans is\nscarce.\nWe can also postulate a number of explanations for the\ndiscrepancy between self-reports and the results of bio-\nchemical assessment among self-reported nonsmokers.\nFirst, Blacks, as compared with Whites, may be highly\nexposed to environmental tobacco smoke or may differ in\nterms of nicotine pharmacokinetics. These two possibilities\nwould help to explain why Blacks who reported themselves\nto be nonsmokers were more likely to have a cotinine level\ngreater than 15.0 ng/ml. Indeed, several studies have found\ndifferences in serum cotinine concentrations between Black\nBlacks had higher cotinine levels than did Whites, even after\nenvironmental tobacco smoke exposure and other factors\nwere taken into account. Because racial differences in nico-\ntine pharmacokinetics (44) and genetic polymorphisms\ninvolved (49) exist, different cutoff points are probably\nTABLE 4.

Second, among all self-reported\nnonsmokers who lived with two or more smokers who\nsmoked inside the home, the high concentration of serum\ncotinine may have been the result of high exposure to envi-\nronmental tobacco smoke. Third, among respondents who\nreported being current smokers (during the household inter-\nview) but reported not smoking in the 5 days before their\nblood was drawn (in the MEC interview), the presumably\nhigh serum cotinine level (on average, a regular smoker has a\nserum cotinine concentration of 250 ng/ml) may have not\ndropped to 15.0 ng/ml by the time of the MEC interview.\nFourth, respondents may have provided accurate information\nin the household interview but not in the MEC interview.\nFifth, perhaps most of the persons who reported not smoking\nin the previous 5 days and had serum cotinine levels greater\nthan 15.0 ng/ml provided inaccurate information about their\nsmoking status. Eighty-three percent of self-reported non-\nsmokers who were determined by the biochemical measure to\nbe smokers had a serum cotinine level greater than or equal to\n25.0 ng/ml (the median cotinine level for non-tobacco users\nserum cotinine level greater than or equal to 100.0 ng/ml (data\nnot shown). A value greater than 100.0 ng/ml is inconsistent\nwith either high exposure to environmental tobacco smoke or\noccasional smoking. Sensitivity to the social stigma associ-\nated with smoking has been cited as one reason why people\nmight underreport their smoking status (48).\nOverall, in this study there were higher levels of discrep-\nancy among self-reported smokers than among self-reported\nnonsmokers. Smoking patterns, including the extent of nico-\ntine dosing, may be the main explanation for the 7.5 percent\ndiscrepancy among self-reported smokers, and social stigma\nmay be the main explanation for the 1.4 percent discrepancy\namong self-reported nonsmokers. The private setting used to\ncollect information on smoking status in NHANES III may\nhave contributed to the low levels of discrepancy observed\namong self-reported nonsmokers.\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first to provide quan-\ntification of the discrepancy between self-reported smoking\ninformation and data from a biochemical measure for the\nUS population aged 17 years or older. Although biochemi-\ncal assessment is generally believed to be more reliable than\nself-reports in assessing smoking status, its validity at very\nlow levels of cigarette smoking may be questioned.\nSpecifically, the validity of serum cotinine concentration as\nan objective measure for detecting true smokers should be\ncarefully considered when trying to assess smoking status\namong groups with a substantial proportion of persons who\nsmoke fewer than five cigarettes per day (i.e., Mexican\nAmericans). In general, however, self-reports appear to be a\nvery good indicator of actual smoking status.\nREFERENCES\n1. Patrick DL, Cheadle A, Thompson DC, et al.
