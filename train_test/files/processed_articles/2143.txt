Self-reported LTPA was divided into inactive, regular low-to-moderate and vigorous activity. A\nfrequency-weighted metabolic equivalents (METS/week) variable was also computed. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence\nintervals (CI) were calculated for overall cancer mortality in the whole sample, by body mass index categories and insulin resistance\n(IR) status. Nonsignificant protective associations were observed for regular low-to-moderate and vigorous activity, and for the\nhighest quartile of METS/week (HRs range: 0.66\u00ad0.95). Individuals without IR engaging in regular vigorous activity had a 48%\ndecreased risk of cancer mortality (HR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.28\u00ad0.98) in multivariate analyses. Conversely, nonsignificant positive\nassociations were observed in people with IR. In conclusion, regular vigorous activity may reduce risk of cancer mortality among\npersons with normal insulin-glucose metabolism in this national sample.\n1. Introduction\nCancer is a major public health concern in the United\nStates with approximately 25% of total deaths attributed\nto cancer [1]. The projected number of cancer deaths in\ntotal of over 560,000 deaths. Therefore, investigations into\nmodifiable risk factors that may reduce the rates of cancer\nmortality continue to be of significant importance. Physical\nactivity has been hypothesized to protect against cancer\nthrough obesity reduction, improved insulin sensitivity and\nsex hormone profiles, and lowered inflammation [2]. The\nWorld Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Can-\ncer Research Expert Panel Report concluded that physical\nactivity likely reduces the risk of some cancers and suggested\nan active lifestyle for protection against cancer progression\nand mortality [3]. However, concrete recommendations for\nphysical activity to prevent cancer mortality are lacking, in\npart, due to inconsistencies in the existing evidence, and due\nto varying methodology and differing definitions of physical\nactivity used [4]. Furthermore, at this time associations with\nphysical activity are better established for cancer incidence as\ncompared to mortality [4, 5].\nA greater understanding of the protective effects of phys-\nical activity may enhance existing cancer control strategies\nand potentially reduce cancer mortality. The present study\nstrengthens the evidence in the current literature by exam-\nining longitudinal associations between leisure-time physical\nactivity (LTPA) in the Third National Health and Nutrition\nmortality data through 2006. Excess adiposity and aberra-\ntions in the insulin-glucose axis are hypothesized to promote\n2  \ncarcinogenesis [6, 7] and may offset the protective potential\nof physical activity. It is noteworthy that research in the\narea of cancer mortality has typically focused on a single\nrisk factor. Less attention has been devoted to the combined\neffects of body weight, insulin resistance (IR), physical activ-\nity, and cancer mortality [8\u00ad11], and the interrelationships of\nthese risk factors warrant investigation. Therefore the current\nstudy is designed to expand the physical activity-cancer\nhypothesis by assessing whether body mass index (BMI)\nand IR modify the relationships of physical activity and\ncancer mortality. Existing data available from this national\nsample on body weight, laboratory values, self-reported phy-\nsical activity data, and cancer mortality (N = 863) prov-\nides a unique opportunity to conduct these analyses. The\nresults of this study provide data to guide clinical trials that\nmay ultimately contribute to individualized physical activity\nrecommendations for cancer control.\n2. Materials and Methods\nulation, a national sample of civilian noninstitutionalized\nindividuals, was selected through a complex, multistage\nprobability design [12]. Persons who were 17+ or older were\neligible for the mortality follow-up from the date of partic-\nresents the last NHANES III mortality update. The current\nanalyses included adults 20\u00ad89 years. Per the Adult Treat-\nment Panel (ATP) definition, individuals were considered to\nbe adults if they were at least 20 years old [13]. NHANES par-\nticipants 89+ years were assigned an arbitrary age of 90 years\nfor confidentiality purposes and were excluded from the ana-\nlyses. Pregnant women were excluded because their baseline\nphysical activity and BMI may not be an accurate reflection\nof their usual activity or body weight. Additionally, persons\nwith missing values for the pertinent variables were also\nexcluded, resulting in a final sample of 15,535 individuals.\n2.2. Data Collection. The NHANES III survey consisted\nof a structured household interview and a standardized\nphysical examination in a mobile examination center at\nentry into the study. Participants self-reported their age,\nrace/ethnicity, level of education, leisure-time physical activ-\nity, dietary intakes, alcohol use, current prescription medica-\ntion, and presence of doctor-diagnosed cancer in a personal\ninterview. Race/ethnicity were categorized into (1) non-\nHispanic whites, (2) non-Hispanic Blacks, (3) Mexican-\nAmericans and (4) \"other.\" Trained personnel measured\nheight, weight and waist circumference during the in-person\nexamination [12]. The measured height and weight were\nused to compute BMI. Smoking status was assessed during\nthe in-person interview, in which participants reported\nthe use of cigarettes, pipes, and cigars. A fasting blood\nsample was obtained during the physical examination that\nwas used to measure fasting plasma glucose concentrations.\nDetails of the NHANES III protocols have been previously\npublished [14].

Exposure: Leisure-Time Physical Activity. A question-\nnaire consisting leisure-time physical activity questions\nincluding type of activity and frequency of the activity in\nthe past month was queried in the Household Adult Ques\ntionnaire administered once at baseline. There was no\nadditional follow-up information on physical activity and\nother variables after time of entry into the study until the end\nof mortality follow-up (Figure 1). At baseline, participants\nwere asked for example, if \"In the past month, did you run\nor jog?\" and \"In the past month, how often did you jog or\nrun?\" Similarly, questions were asked on walking, bicycling,\nswimming, aerobics and/or aerobic dancing, other dancing,\ncalisthenics, yard work, lifting weights, and engagement in\nup to four other activities that were not mentioned in the\nsurvey. Frequency of engagement in activities over the past\n30 days was reported. These responses were standardized to\nweekly frequency by using the conversion factors of 4.3\nweeks/month and 30.4 days/month per NHANES III [15].\nA validated intensity rating in metabolic equivalents (MET)\nwas provided by NHANES III for each activity as defined\nin the Compendium of Physical Activities [16]. For exam-\nple, jogging/running was assigned an intensity rating of\n\"8 METS.\" For this study, LTPA was classified as \"low inten-\nsity,\" \"moderate\" and \"vigorous\" using the standard cut-offs\nestablished by Pate et al. [17]. Activities requiring <3 METS\nwere classified as \"low-intensity,\" activities requiring 3\u00ad\n6 METS were classified as \"moderate\" and >6 METS were\nclassified as \"vigorous\" [17]. Participants who did not re-\nport engagement in any of the activities, were classified as\n\"inactive.\" Because individuals engaging in \"low intensity\"\nactivities represented <0.05% (n = 7) of the population, they\nwere combined into the \"moderate\" activity group.\nNext, participants were categorized as performing \"reg-\nular low-to-moderate\" exercises if they reported performing\nthe activity at least 5 times per week and \"regular vigorous\" if\nthey reported performing vigorous activities at least 3 times\nper week. These categories were mutually exclusive (so that\nif an individual performed vigorous and low-to-moderate\nactivities, he/she was included in the vigorous activity group\nand not in both groups). Additionally, a frequency-weighted\n  3\nLTPA variable was calculated by multiplying the frequency\nof each activity by its corresponding intensity value and\nsummed. This variable was divided into quartiles in the\nregression models. The NHANES III survey did not collect\ninformation for duration of each bout of exercise, which\nlimits more precise estimation of physical activity. The phy-\nsical activity definitions used in this study are consistent with\npreviously published studies using the NHANES III popula-\n2.4. Cancer Mortality Ascertainment. Mortality information\nwas obtained from the updated NHANES III Linked Mortal-\nity Files that provide mortality follow-up data from the date\nupon either death certificates or from a probabilistic match\nbetween NHANES III and the National Center for Health\nStatistics, National Death Index (NDI) records. Cancer\nmortality was identified using the International Classification\ncodes C00\u00adC97). Persons were considered alive at the end\nof the follow-up period if they were not matched to a death\nrecord. Details of the mortality files are described elsewhere\n2.5. Statistical Methods. Descriptive statistics were generated\nto assess demographic, lifestyle and dietary attributes related\nwith cancer mortality, and to identify potential confounders.\nNext, unadjusted univariate hazard ratio (HR) and 95%\nconfidence intervals (95% CI) of overall cancer mortality and\nlevel of LTPA were computed using Cox proportional hazard\nmodels, using age as the time scale. Persons who died from\ncauses other than cancer were censored at the age of death\nand persons who were considered alive were censored at the\nend of the study follow-up period.\nWe tested demographic, lifestyle, physiological, and die-\ntary factors as potential confounders of the associations of\nLTPA and cancer mortality, by entering these additional vari-\nables singly into the Cox proportional hazards models. If the\naddition of the variable singly in the model changed the HR\nfor cancer mortality by 10% or more, the variable was added\nto the final regression model. Potential variables tested were\nage (continuous and years), race or ethnicity (categorical:\nwhite, black, Mexican, and other), cardiovascular disease\n(categorical: yes/no), BMI (categorical: normal weight,\noverweight and obese), smoking (categorical: never, current,\npast), alcohol consumption (continuous: number of drinks/\nday), education (categorical: <12 and 12 years), aspirin\nuse (yes/no) total dietary proteins (continuous: grams/day),\ntotal dietary fats (continuous: grams/day) total dietary car-\nbohydrates (continuous: grams/day), and total calories\n(continuous: kilocalories/day). We tested for potential effect\nmodification (considered significant for the purpose of these\nanalyses at alpha value of 0.10 or less) by race, age, gender,\nBMI, and IR status for the relationships of physical activity\nand cancer mortality. A significance level of 0.05 was used\nfor all the other tests. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by\nreanalyzing the associations after excluding persons with a\nbaseline report of doctor-diagnosed cancer (n = 588). For\nexploratory purposes, we repeated analyses in adults 40+\nyears at baseline (n = 9348). The statistical analyses were\nweights provided by NHANES III were applied to all the\nanalyses.\n3. Results\n3.1. Participant Characteristics. Baseline characteristics of\nNHANES III sample are expressed as either weighted freq-\nuencies for categorical variables or weighted means with\ntheir corresponding standard errors (SEs), and minimum\nand maximum values for continuous variables (Table 1). The\nnon-Hispanic blacks, 5.2% Mexican-Americans, and 7.8%\n\"other\" ethnicities. The mean population age was 45 years.\nApproximately 85% of the participants reported engaging in\nany physical activity, with half (53.3%) of the population\nbeing moderately and 16.9% being vigorously active on\na regular basis. About 15% of the sample was \"inactive.\"\nFurthermore, 33% of the participants reported being more\nactive, 21% reported being less active, and 44% estimated\nabout the same level of activity as compared to their peers\nof the same sex and similar age. Over half the population\nwas obese or overweight (BMI > 25), with a mean waist\ncircumference of 92 cm. Twenty-two percent of the popu-\nlation had the insulin resistance syndrome, defined per the\nATP III criteria as having at least three of the following five\ncriteria: abdominal obesity (waist circumference >102 cm\nin men or >88 cm in women), insulin resistance (blood\nglucose >110 mg/dL), low high density lipoprotein (HDL)\n(<40 in men or <50 in women), high serum triglycerides\nconcentration (>150 mg/dL), and hypertension (systolic\nblood pressure >130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure\n(n = 863) of the population had died from cancer at the\nof the patients who had died of cancer had reported doctor-\ndiagnosed cancer during their in-person baseline interview.\n3.2. Associations between Leisure-Time Physical Activity and\nOverall Cancer Mortality. Overall, nonsignificant inverse\nassociations were observed for overall cancer mortality\namong persons engaging in any activity, regular low-to-\nmod- erate or regular vigorous activity in the whole pop-\nulation (Table 2).

Restricting\nanalyses to adults 40+ years at baseline yielded similar results\n(data not shown).\n  5\nTable 2: Hazard ratio (HR) (95% CI) for cancer mortality and measures of leisure-time physical activity in NHANES III (1988\u00ad2006)\nWhole population\nAfter excluding persons with\nAny activity\nRegular low-moderate activity\nRegular vigorous activity\nFrequency-weighted METS/week3\nAge-adjusted\nAdjusted for additional variables1\nAdditional adjustment for BMI2\nAdjusted for age, race, sex, and smoking.\n2Adjusted for age, race, sex, smoking, and BMI.\n4P value for difference between quartiles.\nPrevious research has reported that BMI and IR are\nassociated with cancer mortality [6, 23, 24].

Furthermore, HRs were similar when analyses\nwere repeated among individuals who were 40 years or older\nat baseline.\n4. Discussion\nThe current study was undertaken to elucidate the relation-\nships between LTPA and cancer mortality in a nationally rep-\nresentative dataset and its linkage to mortality status (1988\u00ad\n2006). The comprehensive data available in the NHANES III\nsample on obesity, insulin resistance, and physical activity\nhistory provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the com-\nbined impact of these factors on longitudinally ascertained\ncancer mortality, an approach that has typically not been\nused in the previous studies.\nAlthough the results of the current study are not statisti-\ncally significant in the whole population, they are suggestive\nof protection against overall cancer mortality, specifically for\nvigorous activity (HR < 1). This study is similar to previous\nstudies that have evaluated physical activity in relation to\noverall cancer mortality of site-specific cancer mortality. For\nexample, a recent prospective cohort study among elder\nJapanese adults noted that high levels of physical activity (5\nor more days per week) were associated with a 23% decreased\nrisk of overall cancer mortality (P for trend = 0.02) [25].\nPrevious studies have shown that physical activity protects\nagainst mortality from some common cancers including\n[11]. We observed a slight attenuation of the non-significant\nassociations in the sensitivity analyses after excluding persons\nwith self-reported cancer at baseline. This could perhaps\nbe due to lifestyle changes among the cancer cases after\ndiagnosis, or due to reverse causality. However, unavailability\nof follow-up measures of physical activity in the NHANES\nIII survey limits the complete understanding of this phe-\nnomenon. Furthermore, the current study suggests that the\nprotection afforded by LTPA may be realized in the absence\nof aberrations in the insulin-glucose axis. We note that the\nprotective associations of LTPA and cancer mortality were\nmore pronounced among non-insulin-resistant individuals\nwho engaged in vigorous LTPA.\nSeveral biological mechanisms may explain the potential\nprotective role of physical activity against cancer mortality.\nWith respect to this study, IR-related mechanisms seem\nparticularly relevant. Insulin, an anabolic hormone, is\nhypothesized to promote cell proliferation, inhibit apoptosis,\nand support cancer progression [30\u00ad32]. Regular LTPA has\nbeen associated with improved insulin sensitivity [33\u00ad36].\nStudies have demonstrated that the benefits of physical\nactivity are apparent even in the absence of changes in body\nweight [2, 35]. IR is associated with increased levels of sex\nhormones and increased levels of inflammation [35], that\nmay affect cancer risk [35, 37]. LTPA may also improve\nhormonal profiles [38, 39], reduce systemic inflammation\n[2], and ultimately delay cancer mortality.\nDespite the potential biological mechanisms of physical\nactivity in cancer biology, associations were not significant\nfor all levels of LTPA in the whole population in this study.\nSome inherent limitations of the NHANES III survey design\nand assessment methods for physical activity could have\ncontributed to measurement error and the quantitatively\nweak findings. It has been hypothesized that the time course\nof risk factors along the continuum of the cancer process\nis important [40] and previous studies suggest that physical\nactivity after the diagnosis of cancer influences cancer mor-\ntality [29, 41]. LTPA information was collected once dur-\ning the in-person interview at baseline. Changes in LTPA\npatterns over time and engagement in LTPA after cancer\ndiagnosis during the follow-up period were not captured,\npotentially biasing the results towards the null. Next, physical\nactivity was self-reported and was therefore vulnerable to\nrecall bias due to under- or overreporting their level of LTPA\n[42]. Further, the NHANES III dataset was not well powered\nto investigate site-specific cancer mortality. Lastly, the results\nof this study might be an underestimation of the associations,\nthe prevalence of IR as well as the proportion of physically\ninactive persons have increased in the past two decades [43\u00ad\n45], emphasizing the importance of physical activity in the\ncurrent context.\n5. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, this study uniquely utilizes a large, nationally\nrepresentative sample of US adults and assesses the interre-\nlationship between LTPA, obesity, and IR, two hypothesized\nrisk factors of cancer mortality in the previous literature. The\nresults suggest that the protective effects offered by physical\nactivity against cancer mortality may be realized through\nthe maintenance of normal metabolic function and may\nthereby serve a potential cancer control tool. If confirmed\nin additional epidemiologic studies, these findings may have\nimportant public health implications in the context of the\nhigh rates of insulin resistance and cancer mortality and\na large proportion of persons with sedentary lifestyles in\nthe USA. Further research is also required to determine the\ncritical periods of exposure to physical activity during the\nlife course with exposure measures before and after cancer\ndiagnosis in relation to cancer outcomes in prospective\nstudies.\nAbbreviations\nATP III: Adult Treatment Panel III\nBMI: Body mass index\nCI: Confidence interval\nHDL: High-density lipoprotein\nHR: Hazard ratio\n8  \nICD-10: International Classification of Diseases,\nTenth Revision\nIR: Insulin resistance\nLTPA: Leisure-time physical activity\nMETS: Metabolic equivalents\nNDI: National Death Index\nNHANES III: Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey\nSE: Standard error.\n"
