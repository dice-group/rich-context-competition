    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe goal of this study was to examine the role of positive mood on generative and evaluative thinking in creative problem\nsolving. Participants included 89 middle school students who watched either a positive or neutral mood video program.\nAfter students watched the video, they completed the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) scale to determine\ntheir current mood. Participants were then divided into three groups and given a divergent thinking task to complete. Group\nA was asked to generate potential solutions to a problem (generative thinking). Group B was given one solution to the\nproblem that had been offered by participants' peers in a previous pilot study and then asked to generate possible advantages\nto this particular solution (evaluative thinking). Group C was given the potential solution but asked to generate potential\ndisadvantages (also evaluative thinking). Students in the positive mood condition were significantly more fluent than those\nwho watched the neutral video. Students in the neutral mood condition generated more disadvantages than advantages, but\nthis difference was significant only at p < .10. Implications and limitations of these results were discussed.\n",

Indeed, the goal preparing\nlearners to be able to effectively deal with ever increasing\nand complex problems of the modern world is more and\nmore a concern of business and political leaders as well as\neducators (Coy, 2000; National Governors Association,\nCouncil of Chief State School Officers, and Achieve, Inc,\ncorporate, government, and nonprofit professional organi-\nzations worldwide have called for expanded attention to\neducation for creativity. Creativity, knowledge, and access\nto information are . . . \"powerful drivers of development\"\n(p. 3) and \"Creativity is . . . the key resource in the knowl-\nedge economy, leading to innovation and technological\nchange and conferring competitive advantage on businesses\nand national economies . . .\" (United Nations Committee on\nTrade and Development and the UNDP Special Unit for\nWhat is known about creativity and CPS is that it is a\ncomplex phenomenon, involving skills of both idea genera-\nTreffinger, Isaksen, & Stead-Dorval, 2006). Generative\nthinking involves developing many new possibilities.\nGeneration of ideas is an open exploration or search for ideas\nin which a person generates many ideas (fluency in think-\ning), varied ideas and new perspectives (flexibility), and\nunusual or novel ideas (originality). According to Treffinger\nand Isaksen (2005), generating ideas is viewed by many peo-\nple as \"creative,\" and is sometimes (in error) equated with\n\"brainstorming.\" Generating ideas is but one important com-\nponent and stage in CPS and brainstorming is one specific\ntool (among many) for generating options.\nOn the contrary, evaluative thinking involves exploring\nways to make promising options into workable solutions and\npreparing for successful implementation. Evaluation of ideas\nis essential when solutions are presented and individuals\nmust develop the solutions and make them as appropriate,\nuseful, or workable as possible (Gibson & Mumford, 2013).\nApplying planned strategies and tools to analyze, develop,\nand refine possibilities, and to transform them into promising\n1Ramsey, NJ, USA\n2Fordham University, New York, NY, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nJohn C.

In its latest formulation,\nTreffinger et al., 2013) involves both generative and evalua-\ntive thinking tools. At each stage of the creative problem-\nsolving process, the individual applies both types of tools,\nand with each successive step or task in the process, the indi-\nvidual engages in appraisal or evaluative activity, providing\ninformation and insight to guide further efforts.\nAlthough the CPS model had many revisions over the last\nto be a powerful tool and effective method for igniting cre-\native potential and making productive change (Christie &\nKaminski, 2002; Freeman, Wolfe, Littlejohn, & Mayfield,\nMcCluskey, Baker, & McCluskey, 2005; Puccio, Firestein,\nHowever, numerous researchers have argued that skill build-\ning is of limited utility unless more personal, affective quali-\nties in the problem situation are considered (Davis, Kaufman,\nStanko-Kaczmarek, 2012). No less a major figure than J. P.\nties of the individual were the real determinants of a creative\nresponse.\nWith regard to responding to individuals' affective quali-\nties, teachers and trainers have had a limited number of tools\n(Beghetto, 2010). But, one area that has interested research-\ners for many years is that of the effect of mood on perfor-\nmance (Martin, 1990; Westermann, Spies, Stahl, & Hesse,\n1996). \"Mood induction procedures\" (MIPs) include a broad\ndiversity of methods \"whose aim is to provoke in an indi-\nvidual a transitory emotional state in a non natural situation\nand in a controlled manner . . . an experimental analogue of\nthe mood that would happen in a certain natural situation\"\nin both clinical and educational situations, and involved\ninduction of both positive and negative feelings.\nAsubstantial amount of research exists on the relationship\nDaubman, & Nowicki, 1987; Isen, Johnson, Mertz, &\nhave consistently shown that positive mood inductions lead\nto better, more efficient decision making, including decision\nmaking requiring more careful, systematic, and thorough\nprocessing. Several recent studies continue to show benefi-\ncial effects of positive affect (Eubanks, Murphy, & Mumford,\nHowever, not all of the literature supports the position\nthat positive mood broadens one's ability to think (Harmon-\naffect facilitated divergent thinking late in the idea genera-\ntion process. Kaufmann (2003) later concluded that the\npositive mood\u00adcreativity link is not guaranteed. The results\nfrom some mood induction studies indicate that participants\nin a happy or positive mood perform many tasks more poorly\nthan participants with neutral or sad affect. Happy partici-\npants tended to be less critical and analytical in their thinking\nand are more easily persuaded by weak arguments (Bless,\nmore likely to make inaccurate judgments, even in situations\nwhere there are objective criteria (Sinclair & Mark, 1995). In\nthe Sinclair and Mark study, participants with statistical\ntraining were asked to estimate the magnitude and direction\nof correlation coefficients associated with several scatter\nplots. Participants who were in a positive or happy mood\nprocessed the material less systematically, took less care, and\nconsequently made more errors than did participants in a\nneutral or negative mood.\nOne reason for these different findings may be the fact\nthat researchers have more often examined only the genera-\ntion of solution possibilities--fluency or divergent thinking.\nWhen evaluative thinking is called for, results of positive\nmoods are less clear. Therefore, the purpose of the present\nstudy was to investigate the effect of positive mood on both\ngenerative and evaluative thinking in the creative problem-\nsolving process.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants were 89 sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade mid-\ndle school students from a middle-class suburban school dis-\ntrict, approximately 40 miles from New York City.\nCaucasian, 11 Asian, 2 Hispanic, and 1 African American\nstudents. In terms of academic achievement, each grade\nscored above the 90th percentile on recent statewide tests in\nlanguage arts.\nInstruments and Materials\nPositive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS).The PANAS\n(Watson & Clark, 1988) is a 20-item list of positive and neg-\native adjectives scored on a 5-point scale that asks the par-\nticipant to respond to given words describing emotions and\nfeelings and indicate to what degree the participant feels this\nway (1 = very slightly, not at all; 2 = a little; 3 = moderately;\n4 = quite a bit; 5 = extremely) for a given time period (at the\nmoment). The positive affect items, which are interspersed\nwith the negative affect items, include interested, excited,\nstrong, enthusiastic, proud, alert, inspired, determined,\nattentive, and active. The negative affect items are distressed,\nupset, guilty, scared, hostile, irritable, ashamed, nervous, jit-\ntery, and afraid.\nInternal consistency coefficients range from .84 to .90.\nTest-retest reliabilities range from .39 to .71, with the higher\nPolitis and Houtz 3\ncoefficients reported for the longer durations. The PANAS\nscale is one of the most widely used measures of affectivity\nand has been reported with excellent psychometric proper-\nties with U.S. samples. The scale, which has been validated\nacross diverse time frames, response formats, and cultures,\nmeasures positive and negative affect (mood) separately,\ntreating them as two dimensions of a mood state rather than\nas the opposite ends of a continuum.\nMood induction videos. Participants were randomly assigned\nto either a positive induction experience group or the control\ngroup. A 20-min nature video was used for the control group.\nThis video was used to not elicit any emotion at all. The\nvideo segment was taken from the Planet Earth DVD series\nfrom the Discovery Channel. A 20-min comedy video was\nused to induce a positive mood experience. The video con-\nsisted of excerpts from a Bill Cosby humor routine from the\nvideo titled, Himself. The routine was specifically selected to\nbe essentially free from aggressive content, dealing with\nsuch topics as Cosby's experiences as an expectant and new\nfather, the birth of his child, the training of his son to be a\nsuccessful athlete, an encounter at the dentist office, and so\nforth.\nIt should be noted that when examining the mood induc-\ntion studies, the majority of research did not specify the type\nof video used. However, in all studies with a neutral mood or\ncontrol group, video of nature was used. The most common\nvideos used for the positive mood induction was a comedy\nvideo of famous comedians such as Robin Williams, Eddie\nMurphy, and Bill Cosby. The majority of the mood research\nfocused on college participants and adults. Given the ages of\nthe participants, a comedy video of Bill Cosby was more\nappropriate given the rating of Parental Guidance (PG).\nused the same comedy routine for the mood induction proce-\ndure with successful results.\nBefore beginning the present study, both video segments\nwere shown to colleagues and participants in the pilot study\nto assess whether their reactions matched the expected ones.\nThe PANAS scores reported a positive mood after the com-\nedy video as the nature video elicited a neutral mood because\nall participants did not score high on the positive or negative\nPANAS scale.\nProblem-solving task. During the pilot study, participants were\ngiven sample questions that consisted of generative and eval-\nuative types of thinking. From these questions, the solutions\ngiven were then used for the current study. The hypothetical\nproblem of the cell phone company was used as participants\nshowed the most interest in that problem; it was relatable and\nthey were familiar with the content. When considering the\nproblem-solving task, a model used by Treffinger and Feld-\nhusen (1998) was considered for productive thinking applied\nto CPS. This model stated that three areas that should be con-\nsidered in the problem were the foundations, realistic tasks,\nand real-life opportunities and challenges. Given the age of\nthe participants, it was important to use a task that was age\nand level appropriate.\nProcedures\nThe institutional review board of Fordham University\nreviewed and approved this study at the proposal stage for\nadherence to ethical standards and protection of human par-\nticipants. School administrators were contacted about the\nnature of this research and gave their permission. Parents of\nprospective student participants were contacted and 89\nreturned signed consent forms for their sons and daughters to\nparticipate.\nThe study was conducted in students' guidance classes,\nwhich are classes they have once a week with their guidance\ncounselor to discuss personal and social concerns. In each\nclass, participants were separated randomly into two groups.\nParticipants then watched either the comedy video or the\nneutral video. Each movie was 20-min long.\nNonparticipant students were excused from guidance\nclass and attended supervised library and/or study hall.\nAfter students watched the movie, they completed the\nPANAS scale. Then, students were given a piece of paper\nand a pencil. Within the positive mood induction group and\nthe neutral mood induction groups, participants were further\ndivided randomly into three conditions via distinct written\ndirections: (a) Group A participants were asked to generate\nideas to a problem situation (possible ideas to reverse a com-\npany's declining cell phone sales), (b) Group B was asked for\nthe advantages of using one possible solution to the \"declin-\ning sales\" problem, and (c) Group C was asked for the disad-\nvantages of using the one possible solution to the \"declining\nsales\" problem. Participants were given 15 min to work on\ntheir respective tasks. The possible solution to the \"cell\nphone sales\" problem that was given to Groups B and C was\nselected from those offered by different participants in an\nearlier, separate pilot study.\nIt should be noted that the lead author was the experi-\nmenter for all the groups as she was the teacher for the guid-\nance class where the participants were examined. While the\nparticipants were completing the problem-solving tasks, the\nlead author scored the PANAS to determine whether any par-\nticipant scored extremely high in the negative mood cate-\ngory. This was not the case for any participant. If any such\ncase or cases had occurred, a school counselor was available\nto assure adequate and appropriate assistance to the\nstudents.\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics\nTable 1 presents the means, standard deviations, standard\nerror, and range of all variables in the study.

There were no significant F ratios.\nA second ANOVA was computed using the dummy code for\ngrade level. In Table 3, there is a significant F ratio for the\nmain effect of Mood Induction group. Further tests of homo-\ngeneity of variance, normality, and correlation between the\ndependent measure (fluency of response) and grade code\nacross each experimental group suggested that the use of\ngrade code as a covariate was appropriate.\nTests of the hypotheses\nTests of the first hypothesis. Hypothesis 1 was that the posi-\ntive mood induction group would generate more responses\nthan the neutral mood induction group.

As for the directions groups, the over-\nall means of the \"solutions\" and \"disadvantages\" groups were\ngreater than the \"advantages\" groups. These differences were\nstatistically significant according to both Scheffe and\nNeuman\u00adKeuls' post hoc procedures beyond the .01 (Kirk,\nTests of the second and third hypotheses. Hypothesis 2 was\nthat participants in the positive mood induction group would\ngenerate more advantages than the neutral group. Hypoth-\nesis 3 was that participants in the neutral mood induction\ngroup would generate more disadvantages than participants\nin the positive mood group. Simple main effects (Winer,\n1971) were computed comparing the fluency of positive and\nneutral mood group students in the advantages directions\ngroup and the disadvantages directions groups. The F ratios\n(df = 1, 18, p < .10), respectively. Although these tests are\nsignificant only at .10, the means of the disadvantages direc-\ntions groups are larger by more than two points compared\nwith the advantages groups. Hypothesis 2 was not supported,\nand results in favor of the third hypothesis were significant\nDiscussion\nIn this study, the question was what effect mood would have\non both generative and evaluative thinking. Would the effects\nbe the same? Or, would positive or neutral moods affect gen-\nerative and evaluative thinking in different ways? The mood\nliterature suggested that a positive mood would result in\nmore ideas being generated (Fredrickson, 2001; Isen et al.,\n1987). The creative problem-solving literature clearly argues\nfor the avoidance of negative attitudes and negative, judg-\nmental, evaluative comments during idea generation stages\nhypothesized that a positive mood condition would result in\na greater number of ideas being generated. This hypothesis\nwas supported. The main effect of mood on fluency was sta-\ntistically significant with the positive mood group generating\nmore ideas than students in the neutral condition. This result\nwas also evident in the interaction effect means, with the\nmean of the positive-mood-solutions group greater by more\nthan four and two ideas, respectively, compared with the\npositive-mood-advantages- and positive-mood-disadvan-\ntages groups.\nHowever, a differential effect of mood on evaluative think-\ning was not demonstrated. There is some literature that sug-\ngests that in the evaluative domain, it is easier for individuals\nto be more negative than positive (Isaksen et al., 2000). That\nis, it is more likely that people can think of what is wrong\nwith an idea rather than what is good about a new idea.\nHowever, in this study, it was hypothesized that a positive\nmood would reverse that relationship. Thus, it was expected\nthat the positive mood group given directions to think of\nadvantages about a potential solution would generate more\nideas than would participants given directions to think of dis-\nadvantages about the potential solution. This was not the find-\ning in this study. The overall main effect of directions clearly\nshowed that more disadvantages than advantages were gener-\nated. Furthermore, the positive-mood-disadvantages group\ngenerated more ideas than the positive-mood-advantages\ngroup.\nAre we a pessimistic population? Are we hypercritical?\nDo people easily learn to be more negative rather than posi-\ntive? This study did not address these questions, but one\nexplanation may be offered for the greater number of disad-\nvantages. Although the solution presented to student partici-\npants was one that was generated by participants'peers in the\npilot study, perhaps it is more difficult to think of advantages\nwithout greater information about how the solution was\ndeveloped, how it might be implemented, or what, exactly,\nmight be the criteria for a good solution. Participants in the\ndisadvantages group (neutral or positive mood) could easily\n\"turn around\" the three points just mentioned and make them\nnegatives. For example, the solution may not be a good one\nTable 5. Means and Standard Deviations of Fluency by Mood Induction and Directions Groups.\nVariable n M SD SE Minimum Maximum\n6 SAGE Open\nbecause we don't know how the solution was developed (or\nby whom); it might not be able to be put into practice (that is,\nit is impractical, it won't work); or the solution won't com-\npletely solve the problem (that is, we don't know how to\njudge if it works well enough). Put another way, it may take\nmore technical knowledge and background to argue in favor\nof a solution.\nAs described above, the latest model of CPS (Version\n6.1TM; Treffinger et al., 2006) stresses a ubiquitous context of\nevaluative thinking. As individuals work on problems, they\nuncover, generate, or transform information that affects the\nsuccessive steps they may take. Treffinger et al. refer to this\nas appraising tasks, and it is an essential process integral to\neffective problem solving. We may conclude the present\nstudy has again demonstrated that mood is a variable that can\naffect generative thinking. Inducing a positive mood can be a\nuseful method in problem solving and instructional situa-\ntions when fluency of ideas is an important outcome. But the\nquestion remains whether and how mood can affect evalua-\ntive thinking. Additional research is needed to answer the\nquestion \"Can a positive mood increase individuals' positive\ntask appraisals or reduce negative appraisals?\"\nAuthors' Note\nThe research reported herein was completed in partial fulfillment of\nthe requirement for the doctor of philosophy in educational psy-\nchology from Fordham University.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAbele, A.
