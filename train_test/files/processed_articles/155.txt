Previous re-\nsearch has already found evidence for tax avoidance by debt shifting. I analyze the importance\nof locating debt at holdings which own the operating firm. Placing debt at the level of the hold-\ning is more advantageous since it allows inter alia for debt financing up to the purchase price.\nAccordingly, by using firm-level data provided by the German Central Bank I show empirically\nthat the probability that a firm is held by a holding in the same country increases with the tax\nrate in that country (though the effect is rather small). As a limitation, I find this effect only for\na sample of all firms and no additional effect in case of M&As (denoted as M&A firms). Since\nthis way of debt financing requires that interest payments of holdings are used to offset profits\nof the operating firms, I consolidate financial structures of holdings and the operating firms. I\ndiscuss theoretically and show with descriptive statistics that this consolidation \u00ad the major\ncontribution of my paper \u00ad leads to a higher total debt ratio compared to the unconsolidated\ncase. However, this effect can only be observed in particular for the subsample of those M&A\nfirms which actually belong to such structures of holdings and operating firms and does not\nlead to an increase of the debt ratio in the sample of all M&A firms. Finally, I show that the tax\nsensitivity of external debt financing increases with the consolidation (though again with no\nadditional effect in case of M&A firms). I conclude that those findings may be one explanation\nwhy previous studies have found relatively low effects of taxes on debt financing.\n",

Introduction\nMy paper focuses on tax avoidance in the context of mergers and acquisitions (M&A). M&As\naccount for an increasing part of foreign direct investment (FDI) (48 percent in 2015,\n(UNCTAD, 2016)) and are therefore potentially relevant for tax planning in multinational en-\ntities (MNE). Indeed, it is, e.g., shown that effective tax rates of formerly domestic targets de-\ncline by around 3 percent after M&As (Belz, Robinson, Ruf & Steffens, 2013). Furthermore,\nHuizinga and Voget (2009) show that potential double taxation has an effect on the location of\nheadquarters in MNEs after M&As.\nTargets are often not acquired directly but via holding structures. It is a question, whether this\nhappens for tax reasons. Several papers have investigated, why operating firms are held via\nholdings. Mintz and Weichenrieder (2010) show that so-called treaty shopping, i.e., the avoid-\nance of withholding taxes, is a relevant determinant of holdings. In addition, Lewellen and\nRobinson (2013) find that transaction costs and the reduction of tax payments through inter-\ncompany loans are drivers of the use of holdings.\nHolding structures are also used to implement certain financial structures. From a tax perspec-\ntive the interest tax shield should be allocated in a high tax location. Mintz (2004) shows that\nin this context so-called \"double-dipping\" can explain the use of holdings: Parent firms invest\nin operating firms via holdings. While the parent finances this investment by taking a loan, the\noperating firm receives its funds also as a loan from the holding. Whereas the holdings are\nlocated in countries where the interests from the operating firm are not considered as income,\nthe interests may be twice deducted from the taxable profit.\nAnother strategy is known as debt push down financing, i.e., loading debt on subsidiaries in\ncountries with a high tax rate. In case of M&As, the debt may particularly be loaded at the level\nof a holding. This is advantageous since it allows for debt financing up to the purchase price\n(and not just the amount of total assets) (Ruf, 2011). Indeed, for German inbound investment,\nRuf (2010) shows that debt is particularly shifted to holding companies. In line with that, he\nshows that a higher tax rate of the parent firm (i.e. a relatively lower tax rate of the firm) de-\ncreases the probability of the usage of a holding (Ruf, 2011). Another explanation could be,\nthat debt-push-down strategies including the usage of holdings can particularly be used to cir-\ncumvent thin-capitalization rules (Jacobs, 2011). Thin-capitalization rules are targeted against\nexcessive debt financing, since they limit the deduction of interests from the tax base in case of\nexcessive debt ratios.\nI focus on financial structures set up through M&As. I consider German outbound FDI and\nthereby exploit more variation in the explanatory and control variables than previous studies\nthat considered German inbound FDI. Considering outbound investment, my dataset \u00ad the Mi-\ncrodatabase Direct investment (MiDi) provided by the German Central Bank (Deutsche Bun-\ndesbank) \u00ad allows us to observe the complete chain of ownership including holding companies,\nsince it is based on mandatory reporting from German MNEs. I will consider all FDI (i.e. also\ngreenfield investment) and measure additional effects of firms which became FDI through\nM&As (in the following referred to as \"M&A firms\"; firms which follow from greenfield in-\nvestment are denoted as \"non-M&A firms\").\nLoading debt at the level of holdings may also explain why previous studies, which do not\naccount for this kind of debt financing, have found relatively small tax effects on debt financing.\nSeveral papers have investigated how taxes affect debt financing in MNEs. B\u00fcttner, Overesch,\nSchreiber and Wamser (2011) find a positive effect of taxes both on internal and external debt.\nIn addition, they find that, in case of adverse lending conditions, the tax sensitivity of the former\nis larger than the one of the latter. In a meta-study based on 46 primary studies, Feld,\nHeckemeyer and Overesch (2013) predict, as a consensus estimate, that the debt ratio (relative\nto total capital) increases by 0.3 percentage points if the tax rate increases by one percentage\npoint, which seems to be a rather small effect.\nSeveral papers have made theoretical contributions or found empirical results which may ex-\nplain the relatively small effects of the tax rate on the debt ratio. Excessive external debt financ-\ning may lead to debt overhang (too much debt may hinder attractive investment projects) or\nbankruptcy risks (Myers (1977), Kraus and Litzenberger (1973)). Furthermore, controlled for-\neign corporation rules (a common regulation of countries against tax avoidance), by immedi-\nately taxing income in low tax subsidiaries at the tax rate of the parent company, reduce the\naccumulation of internal debt financing in low tax affiliates (see, e.g., Altshuler and Hubbard\neffect of taxes on the debt ratio is rather strong for firms with less capabilities to reduce their\ntax base through non-debt tax shields and for firms with a smaller probability to experience\nlosses. B\u00fcttner, Overesch, Schreiber and Wamser (2012) show that thin-capitalization rules re-\nduce internal debt shifting. Ruf (2011) finds that transfer pricing regulations, by restricting in-\nterest rates, may also have a negative effect on debt financing. Egger, Keuschnigg, Merlo and\nWamser (2014) find several reasons, which may explain the relatively small tax sensitivity:\nFirst, previous studies have not considered small firms which may increase the tax sensitivity\nof the internal debt ratio to some extent. Second, they show that the tax sensitivity also increases\nif an empirical model is chosen which accounts for the boundedness of the dependent variable\nbetween zero and one. Third, they find that relative advantages to locating debt at alternative\naffiliates, reduces debt financing of a firm. Another explanation could be, that in case of thin-\ncapitalization rules and no strict transfer pricing regulations, the height of interests rather than\nthe debt ratios are adapted (Schindler & Schjelderup, 2016). I however expect, that previous\nstudies have also probably underestimated the effect of taxes on debt financing because they\nneglect the significant debt financing of holding companies and that it is necessary to consoli-\ndate financial structures of operating firms and holdings in order to measure the debt ratio more\nprecisely.1\nMy paper is organized as follows: in the following section, I start by developing relevant hy-\npotheses for my research. In Sections 3 and 4, I then describe the identification strategy and the\nused data. Afterwards, I present my results. The paper ends with some concluding remarks.\n2. Development of Hypotheses\nI analyze how taxes affect the financial structures of M&As. I separate my analysis in two steps.\nFirst, I investigate, whether financial considerations and associated tax benefits determine\ngroup and in particular holding structures which emerge from M&As. As a second step, I in-\nvestigate the effect of taxes on debt ratios and particularly account for debt-push-down strate-\ngies including holdings. To be precise, I consolidate financial structures of operating firms and\nholdings located in the same host country before evaluating the tax influence on the debt ratio.\nNote, that in my empirical analysis I will always consider all firms and measure additional\neffects for M&A firms. The hypotheses will however be formulated for M&As in particular.\n2.1. Determinants of Holding Structures in the Case of M&As\nI start by investigating the effect of several determinants of group and holding structures im-\nplemented in the course of M&As. Debt financing, which reduces the tax base, is especially\nrelevant in case of a high corporate tax rate in the host country. In case of M&As, this debt\nshould particularly be placed at the level of the holding, which leads to my first hypothesis:\n1 Note, that whenever I refer to consolidation, I do not refer to the well-known meaning of consolidating financial\nstatements of MNEs as a whole, but of consolidating those balance sheet positions of all subsidiaries of an MNE\nin each country which enter the calculation of the debt ratios.\nH-1: The tax rate of the host country has a positive effect on the probability that a firm\nis held indirectly by a holding in the same country.\nIn order to offset the profits of the subsidiaries with the interest payments of the holding\nfirms in the same country a group tax regime is necessary. Therefore I formulate the follow-\ning hypothesis:\nH-2: The existence of a group tax regime in the host country has a positive effect on the\nprobability that a firm is held indirectly by a holding in the same country.\nAs mentioned above, an alternative explanation of the usage of holdings is treaty shopping,\ni.e., the avoidance of withholding taxes. In that case they would be located in intermediary\ncountries. In accordance to that, I also test the following hypothesis:\nH-3: The withholding tax rate of the host country has a positive effect on the probability\nthat a firm is held indirectly by a holding in an intermediary country.\nAnother driver of using a holding may be that there is a credit system in the headquarters\nhome country (e.g., like in the USA). If the home country taxes exceed the tax credit, setting\nup a holding in an exemption country would be beneficial (Weichenrieder and Mintz (2008)).\nHowever, this is not relevant in my case, where I only consider subsidiaries of German\nMNEs and observations after 2004. Starting from 2001, Germany generally exempted for-\neign dividends.\n2.2. Considering Debt-Push-Down Strategies When Analyzing Capital Structure Choices\nIn the second part of my analysis, I focus on the financial structures and in particular on debt\nfinancing of holding and target firms. First, I refer to previous literature that has already ana-\nlyzed the tax effect in capital structure choices. Therefore, I attempt to confirm previous find-\nings about a positive relationship between the host country tax rate and leverage:\nH-4: The tax rate of the host country is assumed to have a positive effect on the debt\nratio.\nUnlike previous literature, my focus is on debt-push-down strategies by means of holding\nfirms. I expect that previous literature has underestimated the effect of host country taxes on\ndebt financing if the different entities of a holding structure are analyzed separately.\nThe following simple example may help to clarify this argument. Figure 1 illustrates an ex-\nample of a simple holding structure, where I have a target firm (Firm 2) which is owned by\na holding in the same country (Firm 1). Let us suppose that the holding firm reports exclu-\nsively financial assets, i.e., the shares of the target firm, and that no intercompany loans are\nused here. The target firm however invests the capital in fixed assets.\nFigure 1: Simple Holding Structure\nFirm 1 (Holding Firm):\nfinancial assets1,t equity1,t\nFirm 2 (Target Firm):\nfixed assets2,t equity2,t\nNotes: The index of all balance sheet positions (i,t) includes the number of the firm before the comma (i) and the\nperiod after the comma (t). Liabi,t\ndenotes the liabilities of the respective firm.\nTraditionally the total debt ratio was calculated as the average of the ratios of debt to total\ncapital (,\n, i.e.,  1,\nrespectively  2,\n):\n\n=\n+\nI can compute the consolidated total debt ratio (CTDR) of the two entities as follows:\n\n=\n)\n)\nNote that I subtract 2,\nin the denominator because it is already included in 1,\nand\nhence it would be counted twice. Because of goodwill the value of 1,\n(the market value of\nFirm 2) may exceed 2,\n(the book value of Firm 2).\nThis CTDR of both firms might differ from the average \nfor the holding and the operating\nfirm. The simple intuition is as follows. Since I subtract 2,\n, the ratio increases.\nIf there are multiple holding structures in one country, simple examples can show that the\nCTDR may be lower than the TDR if one holding structure is relatively large and has a low\ndebt ratio. Hence, in the overall sample (not just M&A firms in countries with a high tax rate),\nthe effect of a higher CTDR must not necessarily be observed. However, in case of debt-push-\ndown strategies the debt ratios should be similar across different aggregates (i.e., have the same\nheight relative to the profits). If debt is used to reduce profits (and there are no financing con-\nstraints), there is no reason why this should only be conducted for some subsidiaries of an MNE.\nStill, for earlier investments debt-push-down strategies may not have already been conducted\n(if the MNE rather recently started to do tax avoidance). As mentioned above, in my empirical\nanalysis I will consider also the overall sample of all firms and measure additional effects for\nM&A firms. As discussed above, in case of the latter, using holding structures is more likely.\nHence, all of the following hypotheses should at least hold for M&A firms.\nI conclude that I expect a higher level of the CTDR compared to debt ratios measured for each\nsingle entity (at least in countries with a high tax rate where debt financing at the level of hold-\nings is attractive).\nH-5: Measures for the debt ratio show higher levels of debt-financing if I consolidate all\nliabilities assigned to subsidiaries of an MNE located in the same country (at least\nin countries with a high tax rate).\nThe consolidation, which allows us to observe the debt ratio more precisely, will presumably\nlead to a higher measured effect of the tax rate on the debt ratio. I therefore expect that\nprevious literature has underestimated the tax effect on capital structure choices.\nH-6: The effect of the tax rate on the debt ratio is larger compared to previous results if\nI consolidate subsidiaries with their holdings in the same country.\nIf I consolidate financial information of all entities controlled by the same MNE in a certain\nhost country, I can compute the ratio for total debt as well as similar measures for total inter-\ncompany debt and total bank loans. I therefore further look at internal and external debt financ-\ning in particular. As for total debt financing, I also expect a stronger effect of the tax rate on\nthose two ratios once I consider the consolidated financial items.\nH-7: The effect of the tax rate on the internal debt ratio and the external debt ratio is\nlarger if I consider consolidated financial items.\n3. Identification Strategy\n3.1. Determinants of Holding Structures in the Case of M&As\nIn the following empirical part, I inter alia determine the probability that a firm is held by a\nholding. I estimate this probability with a logit model. For my first regression, I consider a\ndummy variable as my dependent variable that is equal to one if the firm is held indirectly by a\nholding in the same country ( ( )) in the first year where it appears in\nthe database. I only consider firms which are not holdings for firms in the same country them-\nselves (though they may have subsidiaries in other countries). Expression (3) shows my empir-\nical approach, where  denotes the respective firm:\n ( )\n\n\n \n\n+\n\n \n \n \n\n \n+  + \nMy variables of interests are the statutory profit tax rate in the host country of the firm ()\nas well as the existence of a group tax regime ( ) in the host country. Since I am\nparticularly interested in the usage of holdings in case of M&A firms I interact both variables\nwith the variable , which is equal to one, if the firm has entered the database in such a way\n(and equal to zero if it has entered the database through greenfield investment). Furthermore, I\nalso include the withholding tax rate  in the host country as an explanatory variable but I\nonly expect an effect in the second regression which I will describe below and where I change\nthe dependent variable.  denotes a vector of country specific control variables. According to\nmy hypotheses, I expect a positive effect for 6\n(see hypotheses H-1 and H-2).\nFor the second regression I now exchange the dependent variable by the variable\n (. ) which is equal to one if there is a holding in an intermediary\ncountry.\n\n\n \n\n+\n\n \n \n \n\n \n+  + \nI now focus on the withholding taxes (). I expect a positive effect for 7\n(see hypothesis\n3.2. Considering Debt-Push-Down Strategies When Analyzing Capital Structure Choices\nIn this second step, I investigate the effect of taxes on financial structures. I refer to well-known\nstrategies to identify a tax effect on the capital structure choice but I also consider consolidated\ndebt ratios as a dependent variable. If I observe a positive effect of taxes on the probability that\na firm is held via a holding (which \u00ad as explained in Section 2.2 \u00ad leads to higher debt ratios)\nin the regression as denoted in expression (3), then, on average, the consolidated debt ratios\nshould be higher in countries with a high tax rate and hence the effect of the tax rate on the debt\nratio should be higher in the consolidated case.\nFor my basic set of regressions, I consider the total as well as the external and internal debt\nratio as dependent variables. The total debt ratio  is defined as \n= ,\n,\n(see Section\n2.2 for the definition of the variables in the ratio). This differs only in so far from the debt ratio\nin expression (1) as a) there I consider the average of those debt ratios for the special case of\ntwo firms and b) now I also subtract current profits from total capital, since they may also be\nconsidered as equity. Different from that, the internal debt ratio  considers only liabilities\nto affiliates and the parent of the firm. For the external debt ratio , the difference between\nthe total liabilities and those internal liabilities (i.e., the external liabilities) is divided by total\ncapital. Again I use  and  as explanatory variables. However, different than in Section\n3.1,  is now assigned the value one for all subsidiaries of an MNE in a country, if one is a\nM&A firm. In addition, the variable  is defined equal to zero if no firm in the same MNE\nand country has entered the database through an M&A, but at least one through greenfield in-\nvestment. Because of this sample design I consider only holding structures where at least one\nfirm has entered the database in either of the two ways. However, the mode of entry is only\ngiven for firms which became FDI after 2004, so my sample is restricted to the time period\ndenotes the respective firm and  the year:\n\n\n\n \n+  + \n+ \n+ \n is a vector of firm and country level characteristics. According to my hypothesis H-4 I expect\na positive sign for 1\n. In this unconsolidated case, I do not assume an additional effect for M&A\nfirms and hence I have no expectation about the sign or significance of 2\n.\nFurthermore, I consider the consolidated debt ratios as dependent variables, i.e., the consoli-\ndated total debt ratio (), the consolidated internal debt ratio () and the consolidated\nexternal debt ratio (). As can be seen from expression (2), they are basically constructed\nas in the unconsolidated case, but now generally as a sum of all the firms in each holding struc-\nture (including chains of subsidiaries) with the equity of the operating firms being subtracted\nin the denominator. However, different from the stylized case in expression (2), now also inter-\nnal liabilities between the firms in the holding structure are subtracted in order to avoid double\ncounts (they are generally subtracted from the numerator and the denominator of all three debt\nratios, except from the numerator of the ). Furthermore \u00ad as for the unconsolidated debt\nratios \u00ad the debt ratios differ in so far from the debt ratio in Section 2.2 as now I also subtract\ncurrent profits from total capital, since they may also be considered as equity. Finally, for sim-\nplifying the aggregation, this consolidation is conducted for all affiliates in the same MNE and\ncountry, i.e., a common debt ratio is for example also constructed if there are multiple such\nstructures (arranged in a parallel way) of one MNE in a country.\n2 I need firms with a known mode of entry in order to identify differences between M&A firms and non-M&A\nfirms. However, as mentioned above, we can observe the mode of entry only for new firms after 2004. It may be\nquestioned whether new non-M&A firms may not enter holding structures with affiliates that are M&A firms.\nHence the expected difference between M&A firms and non-M&A firms would be biased. However, this would\nbe a downward bias and the actual results may even be stronger.\nExpression (6) shows the example of the consolidated total debt ratio (which I again analo-\ngously consider for the internal and external debt ratio):\n\n\n\n \n+  + \n+ \n+ \nThe variables  and  are defined as for expression (5). I also expect a positive effect of\nthe tax rate on this debt ratio, i.e., 1\nshould be positive in expression (6). For H-6 and H-7, I\nassume a positive and significant effect of the interaction term (those are the cases, were holding\nstructures are likely and hence the consolidation should lead to higher debt ratios in countries\nwith a high tax rate). According to this reasoning, it should only be the firms belonging to a\nholding structure for which I observe this effect. Therefore, in additional regressions, I will only\nconsider firms belonging to an MNE which has such a holding structure in the respective host\ncountry.\nMoreover, I will consider the potential influence of group tax regimes and thin-capitalization\nrules and further reduce the sample to firms which are located in countries with such rules.\nRegarding group tax regimes, the effect of the tax rate is supposed to be larger for firms located\nin countries with such regimes. Accounting for thin-capitalization rules is relevant since, as\nmentioned above, one purpose of using holdings may also be to circumvent those rules (Jacobs,\n2011). Accordingly, I also expect a stronger effect in case there are thin-capitalization rules in\nthe host country (but rather on the internal debt ratio, which \u00ad different then the external debt\nratio \u00ad has been found to depend on those rules (B\u00fcttner et al., 2012)). My dataset on thin-\ncapitalization rules does not distinguish between those rules and earnings stripping rules. Like\nthin-capitalization rules, earnings stripping rules are targeted against excessive debt financing.\nWhereas thin-capitalization rules limit the deduction of interests in case of excessive debt ratios,\nearnings stripping rules apply if the interest to earnings ratio exceeds a certain threshold. Ac-\ncordingly I expect similar effects.\nI use firm data for multinationals from the MiDi database, which is collected by the German\nCentral Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank). This database includes information on both FDI of Ger-\nman MNEs (outbound) as well as FDI of foreign MNEs in Germany (inbound). I consider Ger-\nman outbound FDI, which \u00ad as mentioned in Section 1 \u00ad allows us to exploit more variation.3\n3 I exclude observations from mining, agriculture, non-profit and membership organizations because special tax\nregimes may be available there. Furthermore, I exclude firms from the financial services sector, for which special\nDue to mandatory reporting, this database provides balance-sheet information on all FDI posi-\ntions (subsidiaries) of German MNEs abroad.4 Furthermore I can observe chains of ownership\nincluding the holdings. MiDi provides panel data with information on the mode of entry (M&A\nproject vs. Greenfield project), so I can observe the group structures over time, including the\nemergence of new subsidiaries through M&As. As mentioned above, my sample is restricted\nto the time period 2005 to 2014. I consider only fully owned subsidiaries so that the MNE has\nsufficient influence to conduct the described debt-push-down strategies.\nI consider investment in EU-countries and countries belonging to the OECD, excluding Ger-\nmany which is the country of the MNEs' headquarters.5 My sample includes 1,842 observations\nfor the regressions explaining the holding structures (this number is here also equal to the num-\nber of firms since I consider always only the first year per firm), 8,211 observations (2,335\nfirms) for the regressions explaining the unconsolidated debt ratios and 6,442 observations\n(1,716 firms/holding structures) for the regressions explaining the consolidated debt ratios.\nThe descriptions, means and standard deviations of the variables used in the empirical analysis\nare listed in Tables 1 to 3. I generally use the dependent variables and variables of interests as\ndescribed in Section 3. The selection of control variables is oriented on recent papers dealing\nwith related research questions (see, e.g., Ruf (2011)). The variables of my first set of regres-\nsions (i.e. for explaining holding structures) are listed in Table 1.\nHere I consider the dependent variables and variables of interest as defined in section 3.1,\nnamely Holding (same country), Holding (interm. country), STR, GT Regime and WhT. Those\nexplanatory variables are further interacted with the variable indicating M&A firms (MA),\nwhich is also considered separately. Regarding control variables, certain country specific fac-\ntors may also have an impact on whether subsidiaries are held directly or via holdings (Dre\u00dfler,\nregulations for the balance sheet structure apply, that may lead to biased results. Finally, I also exclude observa-\ntions whose German parent is not an incorporated and legally independent entity, as well as subsidiaries which are\nnot legally independent. In all those cases, I drop all observations of an MNE (in all years) in one country, since\notherwise I might drop some firms from a holding structure whereas others remain which may bias the debt ratios.\n4 The mandatory collection is determined in the German Foreign Trade and Payments Regulation\n(Aussenwirtschaftsverordnung). The criteria, when an investment has to be reported varied over time. From 1999\nuntil 2001, FDI had to be reported if the participation was 10% or more and the balance-sheet total of the respective\nforeign investment exceeded 5 million Euros or if the participation was 50% or more and the balance-sheet total\nthe balance-sheet total exceeded 3 million Euros. Since 2007 the threshold of 10% applies only for direct shares,\nwhereas for indirect shares or a mixture of direct and indirect shares the threshold has been raised to 50% (for\n5 I exclude firms located in Iceland. The used database is confidential concerning information on individual firms\nand since there are only few German subsidiaries in Ireland, this has initially caused conflicts with this require-\nment. For further revision, it may be possible to include firms located in Iceland again.\n2012). Therefore I include GDP, GDP per capita, Inflation and Corruption (measured by the\nWorldbank's Control of Corruption index where higher values denote less corruption).\nTable 1: Descriptive Statistics for Regressions on Determinants of Holding Structures\nVariable Description Mean Standard\nDeviation\nHolding (same country) Dummy variable that is equal to one if the firm is held\nindirectly by a holding in the same country in the first\nyear where it appears in the database.\nHolding (interm. coun-\ntry)\nDummy variable that is equal to one if the firm is held\nindirectly by a holding in an intermediary country in\nthe first year where it appears in the database.\nStatutory profit tax rate\nMA Dummy variable, that is equal to one if the firm has en-\ntered the database through an M&A by the reporting\nMNE (and equal to zero if it has entered the database\nthrough greenfield investment).\nGroup Tax Regime\n(GT Regime)\nThe firm is located in a country with a group tax re-\ngime.\nWithholding Tax\n(WhT)\nGDP Gross Domestic Product in the firm's host country;\nmeasured in billion USD.\nGDP per Capita Gross Domestic Product per home country national in\nthe firm's host country; measured in USD.\nCorruption Value of World Bank's Control of Corruption Index in\nthe firm's host country.\nNotes: The number of observations is 1,842. Firm specific variables are obtained from the Microdatabase Direct\ninvestment (MiDi) 1999-2014 of the Deutsche Bundesbank's research Data and Service Centre (RDSC). Tax var-\niables are derived from IBFD Tax Handbooks and the Worldwide Corporate Tax Guides by Ernst & Young. GDP,\nGDP per Capita, Inflation and Corruption stem from the World Bank.\nWhereas GDP and GDP per capita may increase the probability of holdings in the same country\nsince they indicate the market size and purchasing power (and hence maybe profits which could\nbe offset by interest payments) they may reduce the probability of holdings in an intermediary\ncountry, since high values of those variables may indicate well-established markets where firms\nare presumably rather directly held by the headquarters. Both, Inflation and Corruption may\nhowever be indicators of investment risks in the respective countries and are hence assumed to\nhave opposite signs to the GDP measures in regressions explaining the usage of holdings in\nintermediary countries (for domestic holdings, I have no clear expectations).\nTable 2 shows the variables for my second set of regressions (i.e. with the unconsolidated debt\nratios as dependent variables). Here, I keep the tax rate as an explanatory variable and adapt the\ndefinition of the variable MA as stated in Section 3.2. In addition I include several variables at\nfirm level which should affect the ability respectively willingness of firms to take loans, namely\nLoss Carryforward, Sales and Tangibility. I expect a negative sign for Loss Carryforward be-\ncause if a firm carries forward losses, it has relatively low current profits and hence should have\na lower incentive to reduce its tax base via a high debt ratio (see, e.g., MacKie-Mason (1990)).\nFor the variable Sales different effects can be thought of. On the one hand, for large firms (i.e.\nfirms with large sales) it is assumed to be easier to receive external debt financing (see, e.g.,\nGraham and Harvey (2001)). On the other hand, large firms may typically be more mature and\nhence might rather finance themselves with retained earnings (Ruf, 2011). Whereas the first\neffect is only expected for external debt financing, the second effect may be relevant for both,\ninternal and external debt financing. Hence I have no clear expectation concerning external and\noverall debt financing but assume that the internal debt ratio declines with Sales. Like Sales,\nalso a high value of Tangibility (measured by fixed and intangible assets of the firm, divided\nby total capital (balance sheet total)) should increase the willingness of external lenders to give\na loan. Hence, for this variable I expect a positive effect on the external debt ratio but no specific\neffect on the internal and total debt ratio. Furthermore, I consider GDP growth, which is a\nmeasure for potential profits (see, e.g., Huizinga, Laeven and Nicodeme (2008)) and should\nalso increase the chance to receive a loan. Inflation serves as a measure for lending conditions\nbecause high inflation is usually associated with low interest rates, which should increase bor-\nrowing. Finally, I again include Corruption, which \u00ad as stated above \u00ad takes a high value in\ncase of low corruption and presumably has a positive effect on the debt ratios, since lenders\nmay be eager to give loans rather to firms in more secure countries.\nTable 2: Descriptive Statistics for Regressions on Capital Structures\nVariable Description Mean Standard\nDeviation\nTDR Liabilities of a firm, divided by total capital (balance sheet\ntotal).\nIDR Internal liabilities of a firm, divided by total capital (bal-\nance sheet total).\nEDR External liabilities of a firm, divided by total capital (bal-\nance sheet total).\nStatutory profit tax rate\nHigh STR The firm is located in a country with a tax rate above the\n75%-percentile of all countries.\nMA Dummy variable, that is equal to one if any firm in the\nsame MNE and country (though I consider disaggregated\ndebt ratios here) has entered the database through an M&A\nby the reporting MNE (and equal to zero if no firm in the\nsame MNE and country has entered the database through an\nM&A, but at least one through greenfield investment).\nGroup Tax Regime\n(GT Regime)\nThin-capitalization or\nearnings stripping rule\nThe firm is located in a country with a thin-capitalization\nor earnings stripping rule.\nHolding structure The firm is located in a country, where it's MNE has at\nleast one holding structure.\nLoss Carryforward\nTangibility Fixed and intangible assets of the firm, divided by total\ncapital (balance sheet total).\nGDP Growth Current years GDP in the firm's host country minus last\nyears GDP, divided by last years GDP.\nCorruption Value of World Bank's Control of Corruption Index in the\nfirm's host country.\nNotes: The number of observations is 8,211.

Tax var-\niables are obtained from IBFD Tax Handbooks and the annual Worldwide Corporate Tax Guides by Ernst &\nYoung. GDP growth, Inflation and Corruption stem from the World Bank.\nFor the consolidated case, the country specific explanatory variables and the variable indicating\nM&As are the same as in the unconsolidated case (see Table 3), besides that in case of firms\nbelonging to the same MNE and country, they are now not considered for single firms, but for\nthe group of those firms (considered as one single firm). However, the value of those variables\nfor the group is the same as for each firm of the group in the unconsolidated case (since the\nfirms of those groups are in the same country). Besides the debt ratios, also some explanatory\nvariables (Loss Carryforward, Sales and Tangibility) differ, since they are now not calculated\nfor a single firm but as a minimum outcome (Loss Carryforward) respectively sum (Sales and\nTangibility) for all firms in the same MNE and country.\nTable 2 and Table 3 also include further variables which are relevant for defining the subsam-\nples in Table 4 and the regressions, since they indicate firms which are located in a country with\na Group Tax Regime (Group Tax Regime), a thin-capitalization or earnings stripping rule (Thin-\ncapitalization or earnings stripping rule) or which belong to a holding structure (Holding struc-\nture).\nTable 4 shows the means of the total debt ratio for the consolidated and unconsolidated case,\nwhich I consider in order to test my hypothesis H-5. I consider all firms (rows (1) and (2)) and\nM&A firms in particular (rows (3) to (12)).\nIn the case of all firms, the debt ratio is surprisingly slightly smaller for the consolidated case\n\u00ad as mentioned in Section 2.2 \u00ad this may well be the case, if multiple holding structures of an\nMNE in one country are consolidated. But in case of debt-push-down strategies \u00ad as stated\nabove \u00ad I expect an increase in the debt ratio through the consolidation. In the following rows,\nI consider subsamples where holding structures and therefore higher debt ratios should become\nmore likely given my discussion in Section 2. Foremost, holding structures should be more\nlikely in case of M&As. Starting from row (3) I will only consider such firms. Here, the debt\nratio in the consolidated case (row (4)) is at first still smaller than in the unconsolidated case\n(row (3)). So I find no stronger effect for M&A firms in general. In a next step, I further restrict\nmy sample to firms in countries with a high tax rate (above the 75%-percentile of all countries).\nHere, the effect of higher consolidated debt ratios is even more likely, also in case of multiple\nholding structures (in countries with a high tax rate the debt ratios should be similar across\ndifferent holding structures). Indeed the consolidated debt ratio (0.518 in row (6)) is slightly\nhigher than the unconsolidated debt ratio (0.511 in row (5)). Not surprisingly, this effect be-\ncomes stronger if I consider only firms belonging to holding structures (0.574 in row (8)), i.e.,\nthose firms from which the increase stems. I expect this increase to be even larger, if there is a\ngroup tax regime in the host country of the aggregate (row (10)), since such regimes are neces-\nsary for offsetting profits in the holding structures. However, here the consolidated debt ratio\nslightly declines to 0.554. Hence, there may be other factors affecting the debt ratios for which\nthe chosen descriptive statistic do not control for. Finally, the effect should also be stronger if\nthere are thin-capitalization rules, which may be circumvented by holding structures. Since in\nmy sample, all host countries which have group tax regimes, also have such rules, the effect is\nthe same as in the previous sample. I can conclude, that the results support my hypothesis H-5,\naccording to which the consolidated debt ratios should be higher than the unconsolidated ones,\nthough only for especially relevant samples (i.e., in particular in such subsamples, where only\nthose firms, which belong to holding structures, are included).\nTable 3: Descriptive Statistics for Regressions on Capital Structures (consolidated case)\nVariable Description Mean Standard\nDeviation\nCTDR Liabilities of the firm/consolidated liabilities of all firms\nbelonging to the same MNE and country, divided by con-\nsolidated total capital (balance sheet total).\nCIDR Internal liabilities of the firm/consolidated internal liabili-\nties of all firms belonging to the same MNE and country,\ndivided by consolidated total capital (balance sheet total).\nCEDR External liabilities of the firm/consolidated external liabili-\nties of all firms belonging to the same MNE and country,\ndivided by consolidated total capital (balance sheet total).\nStatutory profit tax rate\nStatutory profit tax rate in the firm's/group of firms' (in\nsame MNE and country) host country.\nHigh STR The firm/group of firms (in same MNE and country) is lo-\ncated in a country with a tax rate above the 75%-percentile\nof all countries.\nMA Dummy variable, that is equal to one if any firm in the\nsame MNE and country has entered the database through\nan M&A by the reporting MNE (and equal to zero if no\nfirm in the same MNE and country has entered the data-\nbase through an M&A, but at least one through greenfield\ninvestment).\nGroup Tax Regime (GT\nRegime)\nThe firm/group of firms (in same MNE and country) is lo-\ncated in a country with a group tax regime.\nThin-capitalization or\nearnings stripping rule\nThe firm/group of firms (in same MNE and country) is lo-\ncated in a country with a thin-capitalization or earnings\nstripping rule.\nHolding structure The firm/group of firms (in same MNE and country) is lo-\ncated in a country, where it's MNE has at least one holding\nstructure.\nLoss Carryforward\n(LCF; consolidated)\nThe firm/at least one firm in the group of firms (in same\nMNE and country) has a loss carryforward.\nSales (consolidated) Total sales of the firm/group of firms (in same MNE and\ncountry).\nTangibility (consoli-\ndated)\nTotal fixed and intangible assets of the firm/group of firms\n(in same MNE and country), divided by total capital (bal-\nance sheet total).\nGDP Growth Current years GDP in the firm's/group of firms' (in same\nMNE and country) host country minus last year's GDP, di-\nvided by last year's GDP.\nInflation Inflation rate in the firm's/group of firms (in same MNE\nand country) host country.\nCorruption Value of World Bank's Control of Corruption Index in the\nfirm's/group of firms (in same MNE and country) host\ncountry.\nNotes: The number of observations is 6,442.

Results\n5.1. Determinants of Holding Structures in the Case of M&As\nIn this section I present my results for the empirical analysis as specified in Section 3.\nTable 5: Determinants of Holding Structures\nDependent Variable Holding (same country) Holding (interm. country)\nSource: Research Data and Service Centre (RDSC) of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Microdatabase Direct invest-\nNotes: p-value reported. The dependent variable is one, if the firm was held by a holding in the same country\n(column (1)) or an intermediary country (column (2)) in the year when it was founded. The standard errors are\nshown in parentheses. They are robust and clustered at the country level. The regressions include year-specific\neffects. *, ** and *** show significance at the level of 10%, 5% and 1%.\nThe results support my hypothesis H-1 according to which the tax rate of the host country\nshould increase the probability that a firm is held by a holding in the same country. The coeffi-\ncient 6.231 (together with the interaction effect with MA of -3.737) translates into a marginal\neffect of 0.434 (at the average of the control variables in the sample), which is also significant\nwith a p-value of 0.030. This means that a 10 percentage point increase of the tax rate increases\nthe probability that the investment firm is held via a holding in the same country by 4.3 per-\ncentage points, which yet seems to be a rather small effect. However, I do not find evidence\nthat this effect is particularly strong in case of M&As since the interaction between the tax rate\nand the variable indicating M&A firms is insignificant (though \u00ad as mentioned above \u00ad it is\ncorrectly included in the calculation of the marginal effect). Furthermore, I do not find evidence\nfor the other hypotheses which are relevant in the context of those two regressions (hypotheses\nH-2 and H-3). Regarding control variables, all effects are insignificant.\nAs mentioned above, another way to investigate debt-push-down strategies is by looking at the\ndebt ratios. Those results are shown in the following section.\n5.2. Considering Debt-Push-Down Strategies When Analyzing Capital Structure Choices\nThe results from the previous regressions slightly indicate that MNEs place debt in particular\nat the level of holdings. In the following I present my results from the analysis where I test,\nwhether the financial structures are in line with this finding. I start by investigating my hypoth-\nesis H-4. The respective results are shown in Table 6. Here I consider all firms, i.e., not just\nM&A firms. The additional effect of the tax rate on the debt ratio in case of M&A firms is\nmeasured by the interaction of MA and STR.\nI find a significant positive effect of the tax rate on the external debt ratio (column (3)). Ac-\ncording to this result, an increase of the tax rate by 10 percentage points increases the external\ndebt ratio by about 2.3 percentage points. However, I do not find corresponding effects for the\ntotal and internal debt ratio. This is surprising given that other studies have found effects also\nfor those debt ratios (see Section 1). One explanation may be the growing importance of thin-\ncapitalization rules (some countries have introduced such rules rather late such as Netherlands\nor Italy (both in 2004)), which seem to be effective in preventing internal debt financing\n(B\u00fcttner et al., 2012). Earlier studies may not have fully captured this effect. Furthermore, I\nfind no significant effect for the interaction with the variable MA, which may imply that there\nare no additional effects in case of M&As. However, the coefficient for MA is significantly\nnegative in the regressions with the internal and total debt ratio as the dependent variables. This\nfinding, which does not seem to be related to the tax rate, may be addressed in further research.\nAs a first conclusion, I can state that my results confirm my hypothesis H-4 in so far, as the\nlocal tax rate has a positive effect on debt financing, however only in case of the external debt\nratio and not in particular for M&A firms.\nTable 6: Tax Influence on Capital Structures (unconsolidated debt ratios)\nDependent Variable TDR IDR EDR\nSource: Research Data and Service Centre (RDSC) of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Microdatabase Direct invest-\nNotes: The regressions include year-specific and parent-specific effects. The standard errors are shown in pa-\nrentheses. They are robust and clustered at the country-year level. *, ** and *** show significance at the level\nRegarding control variables, I would expect a negative effect for LCF (see Section 4) but find\na significant positive effect. The coefficient for Sales is as expected, since I find a negative\neffect on the internal debt ratio and a positive effect on the external debt ratio. For the latter,\nthis implies that in my analysis the effect that larger firms may easier receive debt financing\npresumably outweighs the effect that larger firms may also have tendency to rather use retained\nearnings as a source of financing. The coefficient for Tangibility, which should give a similar\nsignal to external lenders as Sales (and where I expect no specific effect on the internal and\ntotal debt ratio) is however negative in all three columns. The negative effect of Corruption\n(which takes higher values in case of less corruption) is also against the above mentioned ex-\npectations.\nI have already seen in Section 4, that if I consolidate the debt ratios of holding structures, the\ndebt ratios are higher at least in particularly relevant subsamples. According to my hypothesis\nH-6 I also expect a stronger effect of the tax rate on the debt ratio if I consolidate firms with\ntheir holdings in the same country. In addition I assume this increase of the tax sensitivity also\nfor internal and external debt financing separately (hypothesis H-7). As can be seen in Table 7,\nthe effect of the tax rate on the external debt ratio increases (by about 6 percentage points) and\nthere is now also a significantly positive effect on the total debt ratio. Hence I find support for\nmy hypothesis H-6 (only in the consolidated case, the effect on the total debt ratio is significant\nat all) and limited evidence for hypothesis H-7, i.e., only regarding external debt financing.\nTable 7: Tax Influence on Capital Structures (consolidated debt ratios)\nDependent Variable CTDR CIDR CEDR\nSource: Research Data and Service Centre (RDSC) of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Microdatabase Direct invest-\nNotes: The regressions include year-specific and parent-specific effects. The standard errors are shown in pa-\nrentheses. They are robust and clustered at the country-year level. *, ** and *** show significance at the level\nFurthermore, the variable indicating M&A firms again seems to have a negative effect on the\ninternal debt ratio and now also on the total debt ratio. However, the interaction of the tax rate\nwith this variable is again insignificant in all three specifications. Hence, I do not find full sup-\nport for my hypothesis H-6, which, as all my hypotheses, refers to M&A firms. However, I find\nthe expected effect for the overall sample. The effects of the control variables do not change\nconsiderably, except that the sign for the effect of Tangibility on the internal debt ratio turns\npositive (and the effect on the total debt ratio gets insignificant).\nFor now I can conclude, that my first results indicate that debt financing at the level of holding\nfirms is particularly relevant (Table 5) and consolidating financial structures leads to higher\ndebt ratios (see Section 4) respectively a higher measured effect of the tax rate on the debt ratio\n(Table 7).\nI would expect, that the increasing tax sensitivity is rather driven by those firms, which are part\nof a holding structure. This subsample is considered in the regressions in Table 8. The coeffi-\ncient for the effect of the tax rate on the consolidated external debt ratio again increases con-\nsiderably (to a value of 0.368). The effect on the total debt ratio turns insignificant again (also\nin the following specifications) and is hence not robust in my analysis. In this specification, I\nalso find a significant effect for the variable Inflation. According to my reasoning in Section 4,\na high inflation (i.e. low interest rates) should increase external borrowing. However, I find the\nopposite sign.\nTable 8: Tax Influence on Capital Structures (consolidated debt ratios; only holding\nstructures)\nDependent Variable CTDR CIDR CEDR\nSource: Research Data and Service Centre (RDSC) of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Microdatabase Direct invest-\nNotes: The regressions include year-specific and parent-specific effects.

As regards control variables, the major change to previous specifications is that now the\nshare of tangible assets (measured by the variable Tangibility) has the expected positive effect\non external borrowing whereas the effect of Inflation again turns insignificant.\nFinally, in Table 10 I consider only such firms, which again belong to a holding structure but\nare now also located in countries with thin-capitalization rules or earnings stripping rules. As\nmentioned above, holding structures may inter alia be used to circumvent such rules. Again I\nexpect a stronger effect of the tax rate on the debt ratio compared to Table 8. Now, the effect\non the total debt ratio becomes significant in case of M&A firms (with a coefficient of 0.817)\nbut the effect of the tax rate on the external debt ratio becomes insignificant. Because of this\nmixed result I abstain from drawing conclusions here.\nTable 10: Tax Influence on Capital Structures (consolidated debt ratios; only holding\nstructures; thin-capitalization rules or earnings stripping rules in host country)\nDependent Variable CTDR CIDR CEDR\nSource: Research Data and Service Centre (RDSC) of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Microdatabase Direct in-\nNotes: The regressions include year-specific and parent-specific effects.

Concluding remarks\nIn this paper, I investigate the influence of tax incentives on the financial structures of M&As\nby MNEs. In case of M&As, purchase prices are often financed by high amounts of debt. From\na tax perspective, it is beneficial to load the loans particularly on subsidiaries in countries with\na high tax rate (debt push down). Additionally, I explain that it is often advantageous to place\nthe debt at a holding in the country of the target firm, since it allows for debt financing up to\nthe purchase price (and not just the amount of total assets).\nI then investigate this potential tax influence on financial structures set up through M&As using\na dataset of German MNEs. The analysis was separated into two steps. First, I investigate,\nwhether financial considerations and associated tax benefits determine group and in particular\nholding structures. I show that the probability that a firm is held by a holding in the same coun-\ntry increases with the tax rate. In my empirical investigation, a 10 percentage point increase of\nthe statutory profit tax rate increases the probability that the investment firm is held via a hold-\ning in the same country by about 4.3 percentage points. This supports my assumption, that it is\nadvantageous for firms to place debt at the level of holdings in order to avoid taxes, but it is a\nrather small effect. However, I find no particularly strong effect in case of M&As.\nIn addition, if debt-push-down strategies involve holding structures, I show theoretically that it\nis necessary to consolidate financial structures of operating firms and those holdings which\nleads to higher debt ratios. I find that in the overall sample of firms and also for M&A firms in\nparticular the total debt ratio however slightly declines with this consolidation. But if I consider\nM&A firms which belong to holding structures (i.e., for the subsample from which the effect\nof the consolidation stems), I see a considerable increase from the unconsolidated debt ratio\n(50.4 percent of debt relative to total capital) to the consolidated debt ratio (57.4 percent). Ac-\ncording to that, I also find that indeed the effect of the tax rate on the external debt ratio in-\ncreases with such a consolidation (but this effect cannot be found for the internal debt ratio and\nnot in a robust way for the total debt ratio). This effect becomes stronger for firms which belong\nto a holding structure and even stronger if there is a group tax regime in the host country. To\nbe precise, my results for the unconsolidated case show that an increase of the tax rate by 10\npercentage points increases the debt ratio by 2.3 percentage points. For the consolidated case,\nthis effect ranges between 2.9 percentage points (for all firms) and 5.4 percentage points (for\nfirms that belong to a holding structure and are located in a country with a group tax regime).\nThe stronger effect for the subsamples is as expected because I assume that the increase stems\nfrom such holding structures and profits of the firms have to be offset with the interest payments\nof the holding firms which requires a group tax regime. Finally, in at least some specifications\nI find a significantly negative effect of whether a firm entered the database through an M&A\non the internal and total debt ratio as the dependent variables. This topic may be investigated in\nfurther research.\nReferences\nAltshuler, R., & Hubbard, R. G. (2003).
