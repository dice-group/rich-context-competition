CMDS: Stage 0: metabolically healthy; Stage 1: one or two metabolic syndrome risk factors\n[other than impaired fasting glucose (IFG)]; Stage 2: IFG or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or metabolic\nsyndrome (without IFG); Stage 3: two of three (IFG, IGT, and/or metabolic syndrome); and Stage 4: type\n2 diabetes mellitus/CVD.\nResults: In the CARDIA study, compared with Stage 0 metabolically healthy subjects, adjusted risk for\ndiabetes exponentially increased from Stage 1 [hazard ratio (HR) 2.83, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.76-\n<0.001). In NHANES III, both cumulative incidence and multivariable adjusted HRs markedly increased\nfor both all-cause and CVD mortality with advancement of the risk stage from Stages 0 to 4.

The consequences of cardiometabolic dis-\nease are severe. T2DM, which is epidemic in the United States (1)\nand worldwide (2), is associated with elevated risk for morbidity\nand mortality (3) and high social costs (1), and CVD remains the\nleading cause of death in Western societies. To stem the increasing\nprevalence of T2DM and to reduce CVD risks, it will be necessary\nto identify high-risk individuals early in the progression of cardio-\nmetabolic disease and intervene with effective strategies for disease\nprevention.\nObesity can exacerbate insulin resistance and impel cardiometabolic\ndisease progression. However, the relationship between generalized\nobesity, as measured by the body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), and car-\ndiometabolic disease is complex. For example, insulin resistance\nexists largely independent of BMI (4), and BMI is a poor predictor\nof CVD compared with measures of fat distribution such as waist/\nhip ratio (5).

Thus, obesity is neither necessary nor sufficient to\nexplain the pathophysiology underlying cardiometabolic disease.\nEven so, weight loss can be used as a therapeutic tool. Weight loss\nwhether achieved by lifestyle intervention (7), medications (8), or\nbariatric surgery (9) can prevent progression to T2DM in high-risk\nindividuals, ameliorate dyslipidemia, lower blood pressures, and\nimprove glucose tolerance.\nBefore 2012, clinicians used lifestyle modification and a limited num-\nber of modestly effective medications in efforts to combat obesity,\nwith bariatric surgery reserved for more severe or refractory cases\n(10). In the summer of 2012, the FDA approved two new medications,\nphentermine plus topiramate extended release (phentermine/topira-\nmate ER) and locaserin, to be used as adjuncts to lifestyle modifica-\ntion in the treatment of overweight and obesity. The availability of\nthese safe and effective weight loss drugs represents a landmark devel-\nopment in obesity pharmacotherapy, and enables an evidenced-based\nmedical model that incorporates more effective and comprehensive\napplication of lifestyle, drug, and surgical treatment options (11).\nIn developing a medical model for obesity management, it is impor-\ntant to consider that any intervention entails risk, and treatment\nmust be targeted to those patients who will derive the greatest bene-\nfits from the intervention to optimally balance benefit and risk.\nMany treatment algorithms for obesity are based on BMI level,\nwhich determines thresholds for indications pertaining to pharmaco-\ntherapy and bariatric surgery (10,12). For the reasons discussed\nabove, BMI is a poor indicator for use in this context; rather,\npatients who will benefit most from obesity treatment have obesity-\nrelated complications that can be ameliorated by weight loss\n(10,11,13). Given that medications and surgical procedures have\ninherent risks for patients and increase the cost of health care deliv-\nery, it is important to develop a staging system that identifies\npatients who can most benefit from weight loss interventions, based\non complications rather than BMI per se.\nIn this article, we have validated a system for evaluating the stage\nand severity of cardiometabolic disease. Our studies used the\nNHANES III-linked mortality file (14) for cardiovascular and all-\ncause mortality, and longitudinal data from the national CARDIA\nstudy for incident T2DM (15). We have defined distinct categories\nusing readily available clinical information that assess future risk for\nboth T2DM and CVD mortality, and have called this system Cardio-\nmetabolic Disease Staging (CMDS). The studies have provided\ninsight regarding risk progression in cardiometabolic disease, and\nhave validated a tool that can be used by clinicians to identify treat-\nment modality and intensity for obesity based on cardiometabolic\ndisease severity. Such an approach may be useful to optimize the\nbenefit/risk ratio for interventions, and achieve the best outcomes by\naligning specific therapy with those patients who will derive the\ngreatest benefit.\nMethods\nRisk staging system\nWe propose a risk classification system using clinical parameters\npertinent to diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome from Adult Treat-\nment Panel III (ATP III) (3), and prediabetes/diabetes using fasting\nand 2-h OGTT glucose values according to the American Diabetes\nAssociation. The CMDS system is shown in Table 1, and was based\non results from the epidemiological and physiological literature: (i)\nStage 0 includes individuals who are relatively insulin sensitive, free\nof any cardiometabolic disease risk factors, and without increased\nrisk of diabetes or CVD (6), referred to as \"metabolically healthy\nobese\" (16); (ii) Stage 1 includes patients who meet only one or two\nATPIII criteria (waist circumference, elevated blood pressure, tri-\nglycerides, and HDL-C) but who are still at increased risk of future\nT2DM and CVD (17,18); (iii) Stage 2 is comprised of patients who\nmeet criteria for either metabolic syndrome or impaired fasting glu-\ncose (IFG) alone or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) alone; (iv)\nStage 3 includes patients with any two of three of these conditions\n(metabolic syndrome, IFG, and IGT) who exhibit approximately\ndouble the risk for future diabetes compared with those who have\neither condition alone (18,19); finally, (v) Stage 4 subjects have\ndiagnoses of T2DM and/or CVD as patients with previous myocar-\ndial infarction and T2DM patients without a previous myocardial\ninfarction have equal risk of future coronary heart disease mortality\n(20). Thus, the CMDS system was rationally constructed based on\nmultiple published observations. Then, we proceeded to empirically\nvalidate the predictive value of CMDS for differential risk of future\nT2DM and mortality using data from the Coronary Artery Risk\nDevelopment in Young Adults (CARDIA) and the National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohorts.\nCARDIA study\nData from the CARDIA study was used to validate CMDS against\nfuture risk for T2DM. The CARDIA study (15) is a large, ongoing\nyoung black and white adults (46% male) aged 18-30 years from\nfour sites in the United States, including Birmingham, AL; Chicago,\nIL; Minneapolis, MN; and Oakland, CA. Oral glucose tolerance tests\n(OGTTs) with measurement of the 2-h glucose concentration were\nnot initiated until CARDIA year 10, and, for this reason, year 10\nserved as baseline year for this study, with follow-up to year 20.\nThese analyses included 3,315 participants with valid 2-h glucose\nmeasures at year 10 after excluding pregnant women, participants\nwith diabetes or CVDs, and participants without enough information\nfor assignment to risk category. Site institutional review committee\napproval and informed consent were obtained.\nMeasures. BMI (kg/m2) was computed and standardized blood\npressures were obtained by sphygmomanometer. Standing waist cir-\ncumference was measured at a level laterally that is midway\nbetween the iliac crest and the lowest lateral portion of the rib cage\nand anteriorly midway between the xiphoid process of the sternum\nand the umbilicus. Serum glucose and plasma lipids were assayed\nusing the fasting blood sample. Seventy-five-gram OGTTs were per-\nformed at the year 10 and year 20 examinations. Each participant\nwas asked to fast for 12 h; however, participants were asked to\nreport the time of their last meal, so the length of the fasting period\ncould be calculated. Incident diabetes was defined as participants\nreporting a diagnosis of diabetes, or having a documented fasting\nData from NHANES III-linked mortality file was used to validate\nCMDS against mortality risk. NHANES III is a cross-sectional\nOriginal Article Obesity\nsurvey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics\nprobability sample to represent the civilian, noninstitutionalized, US\npopulation. The study was approved by the NCHS Institutional\nReview Board, and all adult participants provided written informed\nconsent. Information on mortality from public-use mortality files\nwas linked to the National Death Index, with follow-up through\nyears who had been randomized to the morning session of the\nmobile examination center and completed an oral glucose test were\nconsidered eligible. Participants without adequate information to\nassess risk staging classification were excluded.\nMeasures. Subjects were grouped into three BMI categories: 30\nwas self-reported as non-Hispanic White (NHW), non-Hispanic\nBlack (NHB), Mexican American (MEX), other Hispanic, and other.\nStandardized blood pressures were obtained by sphygmomanometer.\nStanding waist circumference was measured just above the upper-\nmost lateral border of the ilium. Plasma glucose and serum lipids\nwere measured as delineated in the NHANES Laboratory Procedures\nManual (21). The method of probabilistic matching (22) was used to\nlink NHANES III participants with the National Death Index to\nascertain vital status and mortality through December 31, 2006. It\nwas found that 96.1% of the deceased participants and 99.4% of the\nliving participants were correctly classified, using identical matching\nmethodology applied to the NHANES I Epidemiological Follow-up\nStudy for validation purposes (22).\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were carried out with SAS version 9.3 (SAS\nInstitute). A two-sided P < 0.05 was determined to be statistically\nsignificant. Cox regression models were used to examine risk stage\nin relation to incident diabetes using CARDIA data. Follow-up time\nwas calculated as the difference between the baseline set at year 10\nof the CARDIA study and the year when diabetes was first identi-\nfied, examination year 20, or the year a participant was censored,\nwhichever came first. Multivariable adjusted Cox model 1 was\nadjusted for age, sex, race, income, education, current smoker, cur-\nrent alcohol drinker, and parent diabetes history. Model 2 was addi-\ntionally adjusted for BMI.\nAll analyses for NHANES data took into account differential proba-\nbilities of selection and the complex sample design by using sample\nweights, following NHANES Analytic and Reporting Guidelines.\nStandard errors were calculated using Taylor series linearization.\nWe analyzed all-cause and CVD mortality using Kaplan-Meier sur-\nvival curve estimates and Cox regression models. Model 1 was\nadjusted for age, sex, race, income, education, current smoker, and\ncurrent alcohol drinker. Model 2 was further adjusted for BMI. Sen-\nsitivity analysis was conducted after excluding participants with can-\ncer, CVD, or hepatitis C in the full multivariable adjusted model.\nTABLE 1 The Cardiometabolic Disease Staging (CMDS) system\nThe Cardiometabolic Disease Staging (CMDS) system\nStage Descriptor Criteria\nStage 0 Metabolically healthy No risk factors\nStage 1 One or two risk factors Have one or two of the following risk factors:\n(a) High waist circumference (112 cm in men and 88 cm in women)\n(b) Elevated blood pressure (systolic 130 mmHg and/or diastolic 85 mmHg) or\non antihypertensive medication\n(c) Reduced serum HDL cholesterol (<1.0 mmol/L or 40 mg/dL in men; <1.3 m-\nmol/L or 50 mg/dL in women) or on medication\n(d) Elevated fasting serum triglycerides (1.7 mmol/L or 150 mg/dL) or on\nmedication\nStage 2 Metabolic syndrome or prediabetes Have only one of the following three conditions in isolation\n(a) Metabolic syndrome based on three or more of four risk factors: high waist cir-\ncumference, elevated blood pressure, reduced HDL-C, and elevated triglycerides\n(b) Impaired fasting glucose (IFG; fasting glucose 5.6 mmol/L or 100 mg/dL)\n(c) Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; 2-h glucose 7.8 mmol/L or 140 mg/dL)\nStage 3 Metabolic syndrome 1 prediabetes Have any two of the following three conditions:\n(a) Metabolic syndrome\n(b) IFG\n(c) IGT\nStage 4 T2DM and/or CVD Have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and/or cardiovascular disease (CVD):\nbetic therapy)\n(b) active CVD (angina pectoris, or status post a CVD event such as acute coronary\nartery syndrome, stent placement, coronary artery bypass, thrombotic stroke, n-\nontraumatic amputation due to peripheral vascular disease)\nObesity CMDS Risk Staging System Guo et al.\nWe examined the relationship between the risk system and incident\ndiabetes, or mortality, in all study participants and in those subjects\nwho were overweight and obese. The proportional hazards assump-\ntion for Cox models was assessed using Schoenfeld residuals, and\nno violation was found.\nResults\nIncident diabetes\nThe CARDIA study was used to assess incident diabetes, and base-\nline characteristics (i.e., CARDIA year 10 examination) are pre-\nsented in Tables 2 and 3. Participants in CARDIA were relatively\nyoung with a median age of 35 years. A total of 29.3% of over-\nweight or obese participants were metabolically healthy (i.e., no risk\nfactors; Stage 0, Supporting Information Table).\nOver the 10-year follow-up period, there were 203 cases of newly\ndiagnosed diabetes resulting in an overall crude cumulative diabetes\nincidence of 6.1%. The cumulative diabetes incidence across risk\ntively, as shown in Figure 1A. Among overweight or obese partici-\npants, cumulative diabetes incidence was 8.9% overall, and across\nrespectively (Supporting Information Figure 2). Clearly, patients\ncategorized in Stage 0 (metabolically healthy) exhibited little tend-\nency to progress to diabetes, while cumulative diabetes incidence\nrose at progressively higher rates as the risk stage was advanced\nfrom Stage 1 to Stage 3. The impact of risk stage on diabetes inci-\ndence was similar in both genders and in Whites and Blacks (Sup-\nporting Information Figure 1).\nIn the same manner, multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for\ndiabetes increased as a function of advancing CMDS as shown in\nFigure 1B. Compared with Stage 0 metabolically healthy subjects,\nadjusted risk for diabetes exponentially increased from Stage 1 (HR\ntrend <0.001). Even after adjusting for BMI in Figure 1C, HRs\nincreased as a function of risk stage with statistically significant\nalthough the magnitude of the risk increments was reduced.\nAdjusted HRs for incident diabetes also increased with higher stage\nwhen only overweight or obese participants were included in the\nanalysis (Supporting Information Figure 3).\nAll-cause and CVD mortality\nNHANES III was used to assess effects on all-cause and CVD mor-\ntality, and baseline characteristics are presented in Tables 2 and 3.\nThe NHANES III sample was comprised of 3,964 subjects who\nreported that they had fasted for at least 8 h before OGTT with\nTABLE 2 Sample size for the CARDIA study and NHANES-linked mortality file\nNumber (weighted %)\nRisk level\nNHANES-linked mortality file\nThe CARDIA study\nFor NHANES III-linked mortality file, participants aged 40-74 years with valid 2-h glucose measures and information for assigning risk category were included.

Both all-cause and CVD mortality increased with\nadvancing risk stage in the entire cohort. This applied to both gen-\nders and all ethnic/racial subgroups (Supporting Information Figures\n4 and 7), and when the analyses were confined to only those sub-\njects who were overweight or obese at baseline (Supporting Infor-\nmation Figures 5 and 8). Similarly, multivariable adjusted HRs for\nall-cause mortality are also clearly increased as a function of higher\nCMDS risk stage. In Figure 2B, with Stage 0 metabolically healthy\nadjusted mortality HRs. These results were similar after adjusting\nfor baseline BMI (Figure 2C) or after excluding participants with\nCVD, cancer, or hepatitis C at baseline (data not shown). Adjusted\nHRs for all-cause mortality also increased with higher stage in over-\nweight or obese participants (Supporting Information Figure 6).\nHigher CMDS risk stages also predicted progressively greater risk\ngories were associated with progressively higher adjusted hazard for\nCVD mortality with the lowest risk category Stage 0 serving as the\nreferent group. We further observed that these results were similar\nafter adjusting for BMI (Figure 3C) or after excluding participants\nwith CVD, cancer, or hepatitis C at baseline (data not shown).\nAdjusted HRs for CVD mortality also increased with higher stage in\noverweight or obese participants (Supporting Information Figure 9).\nOver a 10-year follow-up period in CARDIA, CMDS risk categories\n(Stages 0 to 3) discriminated 20-fold differences in both the cumu-\ntes. In NHANES, CMDS Stages 0 to 4 differentiated cumulative all-\nyears and adjusted HRs from 1.0 to 3.12, and CVD mortality rates\nto 14.6. Thus, CMDS is a strong predictor of incident diabetes, all-\ncause mortality, and CVD mortality.\nDiscussion\nCardiometabolic disease staging\nWe used two large national cohorts, the CARDIA study for incident\ndiabetes and the NHANES III-linked mortality file for all-cause or\nCVD mortality, to validate a single risk staging system for both met-\nabolic and vascular outcomes in cardiometabolic disease. We estab-\nlished five categories (Stages 0 to 4) for predicting increasing risk\nfor future T2DM and CVD mortality using parameters from the\nphysical examination and laboratory measurements that would be\nimmediately available to clinicians. These parameters are relevant to\nthe diagnosis of metabolic syndrome using ATPIII guidelines (23)\nand prediabetes as defined by the American Diabetes Association,\nand include waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pres-\nsures, fasting and 2-h OGTT blood glucose levels, triglycerides, and\nHDL-C. Our intention was to establish a clinically useful paradigm\nthat will allow clinicians to identify modalities and intensities of\ntherapy for prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic diseases in\na manner that optimally balances benefit and risk. Our analyses\nclearly established that the five stages: (i) define populations at pro-\ngressively increasing risk of future T2DM and all-cause and CVD\nmortality; (ii) partition populations with substantial numbers into all\nthe various risk categories; (iii) serve to differentiate individuals\nover a wide range of disease risk; and (iv) maintain predictive value\nin both genders and across ethnic/racial subpopulations.\nCMDS and the progression of cardiometabolic\ndisease\nThe staging system that was validated in this study confirms isolated\nobservations but, moreover, provides an integrated understanding of\nthe progressive nature and spectrum of cardiometabolic disease. For\nexample, our data confirm that a significant proportion of\nTABLE 3 Characteristics of participants from the CARDIA\nstudy and NHANES-linked mortality file\nBMI, body mass index; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; elevated blood pressure,\n(systolic 130 mmHg and/or diastolic 85 mmHg) or on antihypertensive medica-\ntion; elevated fasting serum triglycerides, 1.7 mmol/L or 150 mg/dL; or on medi-\ncation; elevated total cholesterol, 180 mg/dL or on medication; HDL, high-density\nlipoprotein; higher education, have completed some college or higher education;\nhigh waist circumference, 112 cm in men and 88 cm in women; reduced HDL\nwomen; or on medication; SBP, systolic blood pressure.\nObesity CMDS Risk Staging System Guo et al.\noverweight and obese individuals do not have cardiometabolic risk\nfactors (6,24), equivalent to 19% of the CARDIA cohort, and now\nprospectively demonstrate that these individuals (i.e., Stage 0) also\nexhibit low rates of future diabetes and all-cause and CVD mortal-\nity. Our study also indicates that patients with one or two risk fac-\ntors (Stage 1), who do not meet criteria for either metabolic syn-\ndrome or prediabetes, exhibit increased risk of future diabetes. This\nis consistent with the idea advanced by us (25) and others (17,18)\nthat these diagnostic categories have high specificity but low sensi-\ntivity for identifying insulin resistance and cardiometabolic disease.\nNevertheless, as cardiometabolic disease progresses to fulfillment of\ncriteria for metabolic syndrome or IFG or IGT (Stage 2), patients\nare at increased risk for T2DM and CVD, and the risks approxi-\nmately double when any two of these three are present (Stage 3).\nThis is consistent with previous data showing patients who meet cri-\nteria for both metabolic syndrome and prediabetes are at substan-\ntially higher risk for T2DM than patients who satisfy criteria for\nonly one of these diagnoses (18-20). Stage 3 is identical to a high-\nrisk state for future diabetes identified in a position statement from\nthe American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, who recom-\nmend consideration of treatment with antidiabetic drugs in these\npatients (26). Stage 4 is defined by the presence of overt T2DM\nand/or CVD, and reflects the high risk conferred by T2DM per se,\neven in the absence of known CVD, for future CVD events (20).\nThus, in single cohorts of patients, our study demonstrates the full\ncontinuum of the cardiometabolic disease process, and elucidates the\nprogressive severity of the disease using quantifiable clinical\nmarkers and manifestations relevant to both metabolic and vascular\ncomponents.\nBMI was not included in the determination of cardiometabolic dis-\nease risk because previous studies have indicated that insulin resist-\nance exists largely independent of generalized adiposity (4,25,27)\nand that BMI is a poor independent predictor of CVD (28). This\ndata substantiate that BMI is weak independent predictor of future\ndiabetes as well as all-cause and CVD mortality because adjustment\nfor BMI did not substantially alter risks predicted by CMDS. Also,\nthe predictive value of CMDS was unchanged when lean subjects\nwere omitted and CMDS was applied only to overweight and obese\nindividuals. In contrast, waist circumference is a strong independent\npredictor of insulin resistance and CVD (28,29), and is incorporated\ninto CMDS. It is also apparent that HbA1c was not used as a mea-\nsure of diabetes or prediabetes, and this is because we (30) and\nothers (31) have shown that HbA1c has low sensitivity for these\ndiagnoses, and is responsible for a high false-negative rate among\npatients diagnosed using the gold standard measures of fasting glu-\ncose combined with 2-h glucose values. It is also important to con-\nsider that a high proportion of patients with prediabetes on the basis\nof IGT (i.e., elevated 2-h OGTT only) will be missed when only\nfasting glucose and HbA1c are available, and that this proportion of\nmissed diagnoses increases as a function of age (32). Elevated 2-h\nglucose is also a strong independent risk factor for CVD (33). These\nFIGURE 1 (A) Cumulative diabetes incidence according to risk staging system.

CMDS should be studied as a tool to\noptimize the benefit/risk ratio when selecting interventions with\nvariable safety and efficacy for the prevention or treatment of cardi-\nometabolic diseases risk. Although CMDS can be used as a guide-\nline for any intervention, it is the recent advances in treatment of\nobesity that have impelled this study. The availability of two new\neffective medications, phentermine/topiramate ER (8) and lorcaserin\n(34), has enabled a comprehensive evidence-based medical model\nfor effective and balanced utilization of lifestyle modification, drugs,\nand bariatric surgery (11). It is important to identify which patients\nwill derive the greatest benefit from these interventions because,\nwith 70% of US adults being overweight or obese (35), it is not\ndesirable or feasible to treat all patients with medical or surgical\ntherapy. Furthermore, available therapies are often unable to achieve\noptimal cosmetic results but can dramatically improve both the car-\nThe patients who will benefit most from therapy have obesity-\nrelated complications that can be ameliorated by weight loss.\nCurrently, BMI is featured predominantly in treatment algorithms\nthat determine therapeutic indications for overweight and obesity,\nsuch as that proposed by the NHLBI (12). However, the cardiometa-\nbolic and many mechanical complications of obesity exist independ-\nmost benefit from treatment. From this perspective, baseline BMI is\nless important in targeting patients who will benefit most from\nweight loss than the existence and severity of complications at base-\nline (11,13,36). CMDS can be used to identify patients at various\ndegrees of risk for T2DM and CVD mortality, and serve as a guide-\nline for selection of therapeutic modality and intensity. This concept\nunderscores a complications-centric model, as opposed to a BMI-\nOther approaches to risk staging\nThere are other approaches to risk evaluation for cardiometabolic\ndisease. The clinician should certainly evaluate patients for meta-\nbolic syndrome and prediabetes, even though metabolic syndrome\nhas high specificity but low sensitivity for identifying patients with\ninsulin resistance and cardiometabolic disease (25). Various risk\nscores have also been constructed using information from the history\nand physical examination (37) or using clinical laboratory assays\n(38), and these can be used to stage risk in insulin-resistant patients\nwhether or not they meet diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome\nor prediabetes.

The Edmonton system features five\nstages (stages 0 to 4), and has been validated to predict only all-\ncause mortality. Even so, CMDS Stages 1, 2, and 3 would all be\nincluded in Edmonton Stage 1. As we have clearly demonstrated\nthat there was a significant range of differential risk among patients\nin CMDS Stages 1 to 3, from this perspective, CMDS provides a\nmore granular dissection of cardiometabolic disease risk.\nStudy strengths and limitations\nStrengths include the use of longitudinal data from two large\nnational cohorts, the CARDIA study and the NHANES III-linked\nmortality file. The studies involved both genders and several racial/\nethnic groups, and this has enabled our findings to be readily\napplied to the general population. Second, we validated CMDS for\npredicting risk of incident diabetes, CVD mortality, and all-cause\nmortality over a wide range of BMI. These aspects substantiate the\nbroad application of CMDS for interventions designed to prevent or\ntreat cardiometabolic disease.\nThis study also has limitations. NHANES, as in any survey, may\nhave sampling and nonsampling errors. Additionally, only a subset\nof participants received a glucose tolerance test, and some of those\nparticipants did not fast over 8 h, hence they were also excluded\nfrom the analysis. The sample size is not large enough to permit\nextensive subgroup analyses, especially for CVD mortality. Further,\nmortality follow-up was available only till late 2006, and updated\nfollow-up information has not yet been released. In the CARDIA\nstudy, ascertainment of diabetes in year 15 was made by fasting glu-\ncose only, whereas diabetes in year 20 was ascertained by both fast-\ning and 2-h OGTT glucose. Finally, clinical trials will be needed to\ndetermine whether the application of CMDS will enhance outcomes,\nbenefit/risk ratio, safety, and cost-effectiveness of interventions,\nsuch as weight loss therapy, to prevent and treat cardiometabolic\ndisease (e.g., T2DM).\nConclusions\nCMDS can discriminate a wide range of risk for diabetes, CVD\nmortality, and all-cause mortality independent of BMI, and can be\nused as a risk assessment tool to guide interventions that prevent\nand treat cardiometabolic disease. In particular, such a tool can be\nuseful in a complications-centric approach to the treatment of obe-\nsity (11,39,40), wherein the goal of weight loss is to ameliorate the\ncomplications of obesity, particularly those related to cardiometa-\nbolic disease risk. Prospective interventional trials are needed to val-\nidate whether that application of CMDS, as a guide to the selection\nof obesity treatment, will enhance patient outcomes and cost-\neffectiveness of care. The goal is to target treatment intensity,\nwhether involving lifestyle modification, weight loss medication, or\nbariatric surgery options, to those patients who will derive the great-\nest benefits from the intervention according to considerations that\noptimally balance benefit and risk.
