These stressful and potentially\ntraumatic events occur more frequently and earlier among those\nwith low socioeconomic status [2\u00ad7]. In a review of mechanisms\nlinking psychological factors and health, Miller and colleagues [8]\nhypothesized that negative life events may also be more common\nin disadvantaged neighborhoods. Variation in neighborhood\nconditions due to segregation may also be a key contributor to\nhealth disparities [9,10]. Context may to some extent itself predict\nor condition stress, emotions, and coping behaviors directly [11\u00ad\n13]. We provide the first evidence that neighborhood conditions\nare related to the prevalence of recent negative life events, and\ndemonstrate the importance of this link for psychological well-\nbeing.\nMost survey-based research on life events has implicitly treated\nlife event risk as a risk faced by individuals. We argue that\nindividuals are embedded in communities, that some communities\nexperience disproportionate social, demographic, and physical\nhazards (6\u00ad8), and that these hazards are intertwined. The phrase\n``riskscape'' [14] conveys the idea that particular physical and\nsocial risks (or resources) in a place are not independent but rather\ninteract and accumulate. This growing appreciation that contex-\ntual risk is more than the sum of risks from individual toxicants or\nstressors has given rise to a new emphasis on documenting the\nnature of these cumulative exposures [15]. Just as a concentration\nof poverty, social dysfunction, and crime in a community may lead\nto worse health outcomes [16], we expect that certain neighbor-\nhood conditions may independently increase the risk of future\nnegative life events. Meanwhile, negative life events may also have\ntriggered downward social mobility. Downward social mobility\nmay co-occur with moves to worse neighborhoods or staying in\ndeclining neighborhoods. Hardships and traumatic experiences in\ncertain communities may be associated with subsequent social,\npsychological, and health problems. Thus, we hypothesize strong\nlinks between recent negative life events and neighborhood\nconditions.\nLife events are not purely exogenous shocks but rather are\ncorrelated with exposures to other risks and resources in one's\nenvironment. Variation in recent experience of negative life events\nis one important mechanism by which deleterious neighborhood\neffects may relate to downstream health outcomes. However,\nexisting research has not yet assessed whether neighborhood\nconditions are linked with negative life event experience. Using\ndata from a representative sample of adults clustered in 343\ncontiguous Chicago neighborhoods, we report the prevalence of a\nvariety of negative life events in a representative urban sample and\nexamine which life events are most clustered geographically. To\nfacilitate comparison with prior literature, we present individual\nsociodemographic predictors of any recent life event, followed by\npredictors of 4 categories of life events, based on typologies\ncommonly used in the trauma literature. We report on how a wide\nrange of neighborhood conditions is differentially related to\nexposure to the life event categories. Finally, we use path models\nto demonstrate that the indirect association of neighborhood\nconditions and multifaceted psychological well-being mediated\nthrough life event experience are stronger than the direct\nneighborhood ``effects.''\nLife Events in Spatial Context\nImportance of Life Events. Exposure to negative life events\nhas been associated with a variety of adverse physical and\npsychological health outcomes, including symptoms of depression\n[17] and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [18], reduced life\nsatisfaction [19], inflammation [20], and chronic physical condi-\ntions [21]. In addition, research has shown that traumatic\nexperiences over the life course can exert greater adverse effects\non psychological and physical health outcomes compared to single\nincident events [22\u00ad24]. Given that the majority of individuals\nexposed to stressful and traumatic events experience more than\none event during their lifetime [25], it is important to understand\nthe cumulative effects of exposure to multiple negative life events\nas well as the differential impact of exposure to various types of\nevents separately.\nLife Events in Context. Life events have typically been\nviewed as individual risks. However, life event risks and\nexperiences take place in physical locations which carry different\nrisks for exposure to certain types of events. Negative life events are\nmore common in places that are undergoing periods of violence\nand hardship, such as war and natural disaster. Dropping out of\nschool and teenage childbearing are also much more common in\ntroubled neighborhoods [26]. Durkheim's classic work on suicide\n[27] demonstrated differences in suicide rates between Catholic\nand Protestant places. Also, characteristics of individuals' social\nnetworks (embedded in place) may increase the risk of experienc-\ning a negative life event. For instance, older adults are particularly\nlikely to experience the death of social contacts, simply because\nmany of the people they know are also older adults.\nThus, life events occur within socially- and spatially-variant\ncontexts. While a few papers have discussed a specific context in\nwhich life event data were collected (place; i.e. [28]), research has\nrarely considered how various conditions in locations in which\nrespondents spend time (space) may relate to their experience of life\nevents. Life experiences may vary across neighborhoods as a result\nof variations in worldviews, economic opportunities, physical\nsafety, social support, and access to resources (e.g., transportation,\nhealth care, child care). Certain aspects of family dynamics, such\nas the role of older adults in the family structure and the amount of\nresponsibility placed on children and young adults, may also vary\nculturally across neighborhood contexts. These differences may in\nturn influence the risk (and impact) of negative life events. Only\none prior study looked at life events in context, finding\nneighborhood disadvantage and disorder amplified the association\nbetween negative life events and the onset of major depression\namong African-American women [29].\nHealth in Context. Advancing research concerning contex-\ntual effects on health will require greater attention to concrete\nmechanisms by which specific features of neighborhoods ``get\nunder the skin'' [9,30]. One way to begin looking for contextual\ncausal mechanisms is to investigate the geographic clustering of\nrisks, resources, and outcomes. When residential neighbors have\nmore similar values of a variable than those who live farther away\n(geographic clustering) [31], this suggests the potential for a\nneighborhood mechanism. To some extent, geographic clustering\ncan be spurious \u00ad the result of composition effects. For instance,\nneighborhoods populated by older adults will have higher\nmortality because older adults have higher mortality. Neighbor-\nhood effects could also be due to selective migration related to the\nvariable being studied. For example, the life event ``death of\nspouse'' would be more common in Sunbelt retirement towns\nbecause older adults migrate there in later life expecting to live\nwell, not because retirement towns are dangerous. Negative life\nevents may also be contagious, rather than causal or composi-\ntional, such as when gang violence results in a string of reprisals.\nOnce geographic clustering has been documented, identifying\nwhich of these mechanisms is at play and to what extent should be\nan important research goal.\nTo illustrate, crime rates vary substantially across intra-urban\nneighborhoods [32], and living in a high-crime area may influence\nhealth in multiple ways. The effort to avoid crime may influence\nhealth behaviors \u00ad to avoid being victimized, residents may avoid\nwalking for exercise or transportation and spending time outdoors.\nContinual fear of crime may also result in chronic activation of\nstress processes, which may lead to physiological dysregulation and\nlater disease [33]. Fear of crime may also influence social\nbehaviors such as avoiding interacting with neighbors, community\nparticipation, and moving away, triggering a reciprocal effect such\nthat fear of crime induces conditions which may foster social\ndisorganization [34], which in turn leads to higher crime rates.\nAlthough prior research has focused on chronic pathways like fear,\nour goal is to examine the acute effects of neighborhood conditions,\nwhich are experienced only in the instance in which the feared\nevent occurs (e.g. a resident is a victim of a crime) (Figure 1). This\ndistinction between chronic and acute effects applies to many\naspects of place, such as fear of police vs. being unnecessarily\nfrisked, traffic stress vs. having an accident, or anxiety while home\nalone vs. being robbed. It is likely that the health effects of actually\nexperiencing the feared event (the acute exposure) is much greater\nthan the effect of the fear (the chronic exposure), even though far\nmore people are exposed to the chronic than the acute stressor.\nPathways. Figure 2 illustrates potential pathways between\nneighborhood characteristics and health outcomes through life\nevents. Crucially, we do not know the comparative amount that\nstress- or event-based pathways influence downstream health. As a\nresult, we might overestimate the contextual effect of fear of\nFigure 1. Acute Versus Chronic Effects of Neighborhood\nConditions. If the event does not occur, health outcomes may be\naffected negatively by stress and by the opportunity costs of steps\ntaken to avoid the event or to mitigate its effects if it did occur. For\nexample, fear of crime may lead someone to avoid leaving home to\nmake friends, or to install a burglar alarm. This is the chronic path. In\ncontrast, if one is criminally victimized, there is a potential for\nimmediate effects on psychological or physical health. This is the acute\npath.\nNeighborhoods, Negative Life Events, and Health\nnegative events because sometimes those events actually occur,\nand both fear of and exposure to the event may influence the same\nhealth outcome. Thus life events might mediate and or moderate\nneighborhood conditions. For example, a higher crime rate\nincreases the risk of victimization, and having been victimized\nmight increase the stress response to exposure to further crime risk.\nThe pathway through life events may also suppress a direct effect.\nFailing to account for acute as well as chronic effects might thus\nresult in model misspecification. Most neighborhood studies\ninclude individual controls and neighborhood predictors, and\nmany recognize potential confounding between the two levels (i.e.,\nbetween individual and neighborhood income/wealth and race/\nracial composition [35]). But little attention has been given to\npotential confounding between individual and contextual stressors.\nResearchers interested in stress mechanisms typically introduce a\nneighborhood measure into a model, understanding the direct\npathway to be the total effect. Our main goal is to draw attention\nto a potential additional pathway not previously emphasized in the\nliterature. Increased risk of a negative life event having occurred to\nrespondents in a certain neighborhood (causal or spurious) may\nresult in an individual experiencing the event, and experience of\nthe event may influence their health in an acute way that is distinct\nfrom the chronic effect. Alternatively, a negative life event may\npropel an individual into worse contexts. In other words, life\nevents may mediate/confound/suppress the relationship between\nneighborhood characteristics and health outcomes. (Confounding\nand mediation are computationally equivalent in cross-sectional\nmodels, and attribution of the effect type depends on the\nresearchers' understanding of the pathways involved [36].)\nSpecifically, our aim is to illustrate that when neighborhood\npredictors are entered into a model predicting a health outcome,\nthose neighborhood predictors are correlated with the recent\nexperiences of individuals in prior contexts. For this reason we use\nretrospective rather than prospective data, and focus on where\nrespondents live at the time of data collection rather than when the\nevent occurred, consistent with the data framework used in\nresearch on stress and neighborhood effects on health.\nMaterials and Methods\nSample\nTo assess the association of negative life events with neighbor-\nhood characteristics and health, we use a multilevel probability\nsample of 3,105 adults age 18 and older, with analyses weighted to\nrepresent the Chicago population in 2000. The Chicago\nCommunity Adult Health Study (CCAHS) consists of face-to-face\ninterviews (71.8% response rate), systematic social observation, a\ncommunity survey, and linkage with archival data. The survey\nelicits individual level data about socioeconomic, psychosocial,\nbehavioral factors, health, and perceived social and physical\ncharacteristics of neighborhoods. Neighborhoods in the CCAHS\nare operationalized as clusters (NCs) of contiguous census tracts,\nbased on the clustered sampling framework of the Project on\nHuman Development in Chicago Neighborhoods [37] and\nreflecting physical barriers, local cultural knowledge, and cluster\nanalyses of census data so that the NCs are relatively homogeneous\nand cover the entire city [38]. On average 9 respondents live in\neach of the 343 NCs. Analyses are weighted to represent Chicago's\n2000 Census population in terms of age, race/ethnicity, and sex.\nThe sociodemographic composition of the sample has been\nreported elsewhere [13]. There are substantial numbers of\nminorities and a broad range of adult ages and socioeconomic\nstatuses [39]. Data collection for the CCAHS was approved under\nthe University of Michigan Health Sciences and Behavioral\nSciences Institutional Review Boards. Respondents gave written\ninformed consent, and data were deidentified prior to public\nrelease.\nMeasurement\nNegative Life Events. Respondents were asked about their\nexperience of 16 specific negative life events in the last 5 years\n(Table 1). CCAHS selected events using a preliminary field study\nbased on the Duke Life Events Inventory [1,40]. To examine the\nextent to which neighborhood conditions differentially relate to\nvarious types of life events, events were classified into several\ndichotomous categories (Table 1). First, events were classified as\nrespondent-directed or other-directed (i.e., events that affected the self\nprimarily through their impact on others). Negative and traumatic\nevents that are directly experienced are generally associated with\ngreater adverse outcomes (e.g., symptoms of depression, PTSD)\ncompared to negative and traumatic events directed at others [41].\nSecond, in accordance with the A1 PTSD diagnostic criterion\n(DSM-IV-R, [42]), an event was categorized as a trauma if it was\nlife threatening for the individual or someone else involved. Events\nthat meet the A1 criterion are generally associated with greater\nPTSD symptoms than non-A1 events [43,44]. Events that were\nnon-life threatening were classified as a hardship.\nNeighborhood Conditions. The 11 measures of neighbor-\nhood conditions are standardized across NCs. Based on recent\nresearch reporting distinct relations between multiple dimensions\nof contextual socioeconomic conditions and outcomes, neighbor-\nhood disadvantage and affluence are assessed separately [38,45].\nPrincipal components factor analysis of 2000 Census NC-level\nmeasures yielded two factors [46]. The neighborhood disadvan-\ntage factor loads negatively on high family incomes, and positively\non low family incomes, high levels of poverty, public assistance,\nunemployment, and vacant housing. The affluence factor loads\npositively on measures of the proportion of employed civilians ages\n16 and over in professional or managerial occupations, the\nproportion of individuals ages 25 and over who have completed 16\nor more years of education, and median home values. Disadvan-\ntage and affluence capture distinct but correlated aspects of\nneighborhood socioeconomic status, much as income and\neducation represent distinct aspects of individual socioeconomic\nstatus. Many neighborhoods low in disadvantage are also low in\naffluence [47]. The traditional family structure scale is composed\nof percent of families headed by females (reverse-coded), and\npercent of residents married. The physical disorder measure used\nhere comes from the Systematic Social Observation (SSO) [48,49]\ncomponent of the CCAHS, in which trained raters assessed 9\necological conditions (i.e. graffiti, litter, abandoned cars, broken\nglass) using standardized criteria.\nThe perceived measures are aggregated to the neighborhood\nlevel from individual responses to the Community Survey section\nof the CCAHS. Scales are based on the PHDCN [50] and use\napproximately five questions for each scale. Aggregation of reports\nFigure 2. Pathways by which Contextual Life Event Risk May\nInfluence Downstream Outcomes. A: Moderation of neighborhood\nconditions by occurrence of life event. B: Direct association of\nneighborhood conditions with outcome. C and D: Indirect association\nof neighborhood conditions with outcome modified by negative life\nevent risk.\nNeighborhoods, Negative Life Events, and Health\nfrom all respondents within the NC minimizes the importance of\neach respondent's response, so that the respondent's own\nperceptions of neighborhood will not overly influence results\n[11]. To aggregate individual item responses to factors at the\nneighborhood level, empirical Bayesian hierarchical linear models\nwere used [51]. The procedure adjusts for missing items, controls\nfor individual socioeconomic characteristics, and improves neigh-\nborhood-level estimates by borrowing information from across\nlocations [51]. A perceived disorder measure was also studied\nbecause both measures are widely used; social stigma can amplify\nperceptions [52]. The ``collective efficacy'' scale includes 10 items\nfrom two subscales and assesses a shared willingness (social\ncohesion) to take action to enforce collective norms (social control)\n[53]. The total victimization scale captures experiences of being a\nvictim of crime (i.e. assault, property theft, robbery) in the\nneighborhood. Anomie assesses the extent to which residents\nreport a disconnection from basic societal rules (e.g. agreeing with\n``Laws are made to be broken''). Reciprocal exchange focuses on\nthe exchange of favors, advice, material goods, and information\nwhich make up a social support network within the community\nSociodemographics. Previous research has shown that\nindividual sociodemographic factors predict both the experience\nof negative life events [2] and the kinds of neighborhoods in which\nindividuals live [55]. We therefore adjust for individual sociodem-\nographics: race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, non-\nHispanic other, with non-Hispanic White as the reference\ncategory), variables indicating whether the respondent is female\nand is a first generation immigrant, and dummy variables for age\nas the reference group), education (12\u00ad15 years or 16+ years, with\n0\u00ad11 years as the reference category), and annual income (of\nrespondent and their spouse if applicable) (less than $5,000,\n$15,000 as the reference category). Categories are used for age in\norder to highlight non-linearity.\nHealth Outcomes. Three health outcomes were selected as\ncommonly studied with respect to both life events and neighbor-\nhoods. Descriptions of the depression (CESD) [56], anxiety [57],\nand self-rated health [58] measures used are given elsewhere.\nAnalytic Plan\nThe analysis was organized in several stages. First, the\nprevalence of exposure to each life event in the five years prior\nto the interview is reported, along with the level of neighborhood\nsimilarity of exposure to each event. Neighborhood (i.e. NC)\nsimilarity is assessed using intraclass correlations (ICCs), where the\nclasses are neighborhoods. ICCs are reported for each life event\ncategory, without and with adjustment for sociodemographics.\nThis method partitions variance in multilevel models attributable\nto individual versus neighborhood levels as a ratio of the between-\nneighborhood variance to the sum of the between-neighborhood\nvariance and the between-individual, within-neighborhood vari-\nance. The ICC for logit models is calculated as t/(t+3.29), where t\nis the variance of the random intercepts [59]. ICCs can only be\ncompared within a given dataset, and comparison with other\nfindings from the CCAHS are discussed. Particularly given the\nlevel of statistical complexity in the measure and the low\nTable 1.

Third, population-weighted regression models assess\nassociations between individual-level characteristics (e.g. socioeco-\nnomic status) and life event categories. Fourth, mixed-effects\nmodels are estimated to assess the relationship between neighbor-\nhood characteristics and life event categories. Mixed-effects\nmodels are necessary because multiple respondents living in each\nneighborhood violates the regression independence assumption.\nThese population-average robust models with population weights\ninclude controls for individual socio-demographics not shown.\nFifth, to check for sensitivity to neighborhood spatial boundaries,\nthe association between life events and disadvantage is assessed at\nvarious spatial scales. Finally, path analyses of the associations\namong 2 of the most frequently studied [60] neighborhood\ncharacteristics (disadvantage and perceived disorder), any recent\nlife event, and 3 health outcomes (self-rated health, depression,\nand anxiety) are presented. These population-weighted models\nwere estimated using Mplus software [61], with controls for\nindividual sociodemographics not shown.\nResults\nOverall, 72.7% of the sample experienced at least one negative\nlife event in the last 5 years. Table 1 reports the prevalence of each\nlife event in Chicago in 2001\u00ad3. Frequencies of individual life\nevents varied widely across event type, with some events occurring\namong less than 1% of the sample (e.g. life-threatening illness/\naccident of a spouse/child) and other events occurring among\nmore than 20% of the sample (e.g. financial difficulties, life-\nthreatening illness of someone else close). For each event in\nTable 1, ICCs are reported with and without adjustment for\ncovariates. Previous reports of geographic clustering using the\nsame dataset (CCAHS) indicate that most measures of neighbor-\nhood physical and social conditions have ICCs above 0.13, some\nnegative emotions (e.g. pessimism) have ICCs of 0.06\u00ad0.09, while\nsome physical health and psychological measures have ICCs under\nadjustment for covariates (0.18) is substantial, almost reaching the\nrange of purely neighborhood-based characteristics such as\nperceived violence in the neighborhood (0.23). The clustering of\ndeath of child (0.13) and life-threatening illness/accident to\nspouse/child (0.13) approximates that of neighborhood-level\nvariables with stronger links to individual characteristics, such as\nperceived social cohesion (0.14). A moderately high level of\nclustering was observed for another group of life events, including\na move to a worse neighborhood, assault, financial difficulties,\nrobbery/burglary, life-threatening illness/accident of respondent,\nlegal trouble, and unemployment of respondent or household\nmember), which may be consistent with a high degree of clustering\nof factors at the individual level, and is comparable to the level of\ngeographic clustering previously reported in the same dataset\n(CCAHS) for negative emotions [13], drinking [63], and exercise\n[63]. Finally, events including divorce, personal job loss, life-\nthreatening illness/accident of someone else close, and death of\nsomeone close, have lower clustering, similar to rates of clustering\nobserved in the CCAHS for measures such as smoking [63],\nsystolic blood pressure, and hopelessness [13].\nTo assess whether the comparatively high level of clustering\nobserved for negative life events is primarily driven by the\ntendency of similar individuals and households to live near each,\nTable 1 also presents ICCs adjusted for sociodemographic\nvariables. In Chicago much of the demographic sorting is due to\nracial/ethnic and income segregation. Thus, the difference in the\nlevels of clustering between the unadjusted and adjusted ICCs\ngauges the contribution of segregation and other sorting by\nneighborhoods to similarity in the experience of negative life\nevents. When adjustment produces larger ICCs, as for divorce and\ndeath of someone close, they are interpreted as resulting from\ndisparities running counter to neighborhood selection (e.g. when\nWhites report greater fear of crime and also live in safer\nneighborhoods [63]). Overall, our results indicate that clustering\nof events persists even when adjusted for sociodemographic\nclustering, suggesting that life events are spatially dependent in\ntheir own right.\nTo visually illustrate the extent to which negative life events are\ngeographically clustered, Figure 3 presents a map of the empirical\nBayes estimates of the neighborhood prevalence of any recent life\nevent. The highest quartiles of prevalence are colored darker.\nConsistent with our other results, life events are not randomly\ndistributed with respect to geography. Rather, a clear spatial\ndistribution is discernible such that recent life events are more\ncommon in more disadvantaged areas of the city, as well as\ndowntown. Chicago is bounded by Lake Michigan on the east,\nand the central business district is centrally located on the shore.\nRespondents living in the outlying areas of the city (distant from\ndowntown, with more single-family houses and wealthier residents)\nhave experienced few recent life events, adjusted for sociodemo-\ngraphics. These are the same outlying areas previously identified\nas having high levels of social capital [64]. Meanwhile, the central\nbusiness district (``The Loop'') area also has a comparatively high\nprevalence of negative life events, despite the low disadvantage of\nits residents.\nTo facilitate comparison with prior research, Table 2 reports\nassociations of socio-demographic variables with life event\ncategories. Consistent with previous research [2,25,65], men were\nsignificantly more likely to report respondent-directed events,\nhardships, or any negative life event. Compared to non-Hispanic\nWhites, non-Hispanic Blacks were more likely to report respon-\ndent-directed events and hardships, and Hispanics were more\nlikely to report hardships. Compared to third generation\nimmigrants, first generation immigrants reported far fewer events\nacross all categories, and second generation immigrants reported\nfewer events overall and respondent-directed events. Older adults\nalso reported having experienced fewer events in the last five years,\nexcept for traumas, consistent with findings that negative life\nevents are more common early in the life course [3,65,66]. Having\nincome also predicted having recently experienced fewer negative\nlife events, compared to those in the lower income group\nyoung and the old) was not significantly different from the lower or\nhigher group (not shown).\nGiven the high levels of clustering reported in Table 2, the next\nanalytic phase focuses on the relation between negative life events\nand conventionally studied neighborhood measures. Table 3\nexamines associations of specific features of neighborhoods with\nlife event categories. Several neighborhood conditions (both\nobjective and perceived) are strong predictors of any recent life\nevent. Certain types of events, specifically hardships and respon-\ndent-oriented events tended to be related to the neighborhood\nmeasures. The types of events which were significantly associated\nwith neighborhood predictors also tended to be those which were\nmore geographically correlated. Respondents do not necessarily\nNeighborhoods, Negative Life Events, and Health\nlive in the same neighborhoods as those emotionally close to them,\nconsistent with there being few significant associations of\nneighborhood characteristics and events to others. Also, many of\nthe traumatic events are related to illness, which is among the\nmore spatially diffuse phenomena studied here. Residents of\ndisadvantaged neighborhoods have greater odds of having recently\nexperienced any event (except other-oriented events). However,\naffluence is not associated with the risk of negative life events,\nconsistent with a literature showing distinctive findings for\ndisadvantage and affluence.\nOther social composition measures also predict life events:\nhaving a greater proportion of older adults in the neighborhood is\nassociated with lower odds of respondent-oriented events, hard-\nships, and overall events. Perhaps neighborhood family composi-\ntion is related to the likelihood of reporting an event to an\nacquaintance if non-traditional family composition increases the\nnumber of people viewed as family. This finding is also consistent\nwith a protective effect of traditional family contexts. Conditions\nlinked with crime (robbery rate and total victimization) and\ndisorder (objective or perceived) strongly predict greater odds of an\nevent directed at the respondent, hardships, and any event, with\nweaker or no relationships with events directed at others and\ntraumatic events (probably because of the importance of health in\nthis category). The three measures of neighborhood norms and\nbehaviors show divergent patterns of prediction. Anomie increases\nodds of events directed at the respondent, but not hardships.\nCollective efficacy decreases odds of respondent-oriented events,\nhardships, and any event, while reciprocal exchanges between\nneighbors are non-significant, lending support to the literature on\nthe benefits of collective efficacy beyond other forms of social\ninteraction.\nSeveral studies have found differences in neighborhood\n``effects'' as a function of how neighborhoods are defined [67].\nAs a cross-check, additional models (not shown) were estimated in\nwhich disadvantage and affluence were assessed in concentric rings\n(``buffers'') around the respondents' geocoded home addresses with\neach spatial scale, disadvantage coefficients in Poisson models\npredicting the count of recent life events, adjusting for sociodem-\nremained non-significant across spatial scale in the buffer models.\nThis indicates that neighborhood definition does not drive results.\nFinally, illustrative results from path analyses of neighborhood\ncharacteristics (disadvantage and perceived disorder), life events\n(any recent event), and 3 health measures (worse self-rated health,\ndepression, anxiety) are given in Table 4. In each model, the\nFigure 3. Neighborhood Estimated Experience of a Recent Life Event (Empirical Bayes Estimates; CCAHS, 2001\u00ad03).\nNeighborhoods, Negative Life Events, and Health\nneighborhood characteristic strongly predicts a recent life event,\nand a recent life event strongly predicts the health outcome. By\ncontrast, direct associations of the neighborhood variable with\nhealth are smaller. Analogous results appeared in models on the\nsubsample of respondents who had lived in their neighborhoods\nfor 5 years or more (not shown). The highly significant Sobel [68]\ntest statistics (which tests the indirect effect of neighborhood\nconditions on health outcomes through recent negative life events)\nindicate that recent life events partially mediates the associations of\nneighborhood conditions and health outcomes.\nDiscussion\nThese findings illustrate the importance of considering acute\nrather than only chronic pathways between context and health.\nExperience of negative life events \u00ad to varying extents \u00ad are\npatterned by residential neighborhood context. Previous research\non the prevalence of stressful and traumatic life events has tended\nto consider individuals as the unit of analysis. The evidence in this\npaper suggests a new direction linking research in a variety of fields\n(criminology, social networks, urban geography) with the literature\non neighborhood health and health disparities. Exposure to actual\nnegative life events is a distinct neighborhood-health pathway\nbeyond fear of events, and may serve as an important mechanism\nby which context influences stress levels.\nSeveral features of the analysis limit the ability to draw causal\nlinks between neighborhoods and events, which is not our goal.\nCross-sectional models cannot directly assess risk of event\noccurrence in neighborhoods. The survey questions do not specify\nwhere the events took place. Future data collection may be able to\nmore explicitly capture how events relate to dynamic spatial and\nsocial contexts. Respondents who experience negative events\nclosely linked to place, such as muggings, may be more likely to\nmove to places where they feel safer or where they have no\nunpleasant memories. Or, negative life events may lead to\ndownward socioeconomic mobility, resulting in residence in less\ndesirable areas. These issues do not detract from our aim to\ndemonstrate the association between recent exposure to negative\nlife events and contextual conditions. Future prospective studies\ncould help establish any dynamic longitudinal relationship\nbetween residential attainment/choice and life events.\nTable 2.

For instance, divorced respondents must have first been\nmarried, and context is associated with both divorce and marriage.\nContextual conditions are associated with not only occurrence of\nan event conditional on eligibility but also eligibility itself. This is\nbecause we are interested in the population-level relationship\nbetween neighborhood conditions and occurrence of an event.\nWhile the structured interview questions covered a broad range of\nevents, many other stressful and potentially traumatic life events,\nas well as a range of positive events, may be consequential.\nHowever, when prompted with an open-ended question, respon-\ndents reported relatively few events not previously queried.\nTable 3.

Extensive prior\nethnographic work has previously described the cumulative nature\nof life experience burden in poor communities [69]. Whereas\nethnographic work can help elucidate stress pathways in individ-\nuals and specific communities, spatial demographic work can\nprovide prevalences necessary for comparison across space. The\nability to consider spatial variation in life events is required in\norder to investigate how geographic factors cause life events, how\nspatial clustering of life events may result in biased estimation of\nspatial effects, and how life events may lead to further events for\nthose nearby. The results also show that some life events are\nspatially clustered in ways not driven by poverty, and future work\nis needed to understand the reason.\nBoth chronic strain and acute life events may influence physical\nand mental health over the life course. Preventive efforts may\nbenefit from a careful discourse distinguishing between the impact\nof fear of events and objective experience of events on health. The\nwork presented here lays a foundation of basic findings on which\nto bridge research concerning trauma with the literature on\nneighborhoods and health. We urge stress researchers to consider\nthe embedded nature of specific events within spatial and social\nnetwork contexts.\n"
