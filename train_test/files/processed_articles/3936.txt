The consequences of the interaction of dom-\ninant economic and political structures in the society con-\nsiderably incite the transformation and activation of latent\nideologies of socioeconomic liberation accommodated\nunder various typologies of terrorism. Although it may be\ntempting to compound the complex nature and situation of\nterrorism in the continent as simply religious, the concept of\nsocioeconomic liberation provides a common linkage to its\nmanifestations and dimensions. Referencing cases, particu-\nlarly, from the Nigerian situation, this article underscores\nthe ideological shift and conflict for economic and political\nauthority between the emergent interest groups nay terror-\nists and the subsisting elite groups within leadership posi-\ntions in the region. The article is subdivided into four parts.\nThe first part covers the concept of elite dominance and the\nimpact of globalization in encouraging the emergence of ter-\nrorist forces. The second part examines the wave of social\nunrest that serves as forerunners of the destructive and pecu-\nniary led terrorist ideas of the present day--that some have\ndescribed as the new terrorism (Otenyo, 2004), in contrast\nwith the terrorism of the colonial and postcolonial periods.\nThe social and economic cost of terrorism is the third com-\nponent and looks at the implications of terrorism and elite\ndominance for security, growth, and development of the\ncontinental economy. Presented in part four is a theoretical\nexamination of elite dominance as a product of a subsisting\ncolonial mentality\u00adwholly encapsulated within political\ngovernance on the continent. Finally, the article concludes\nby raising policy-relevant questions of security and gover-\nnance on the continent.\nDetermining the appropriate definition for terrorism is a\ncommon issue in terrorism literature. Early scholars simply\ndescribed it as the destructive and arbitrary employment of\nviolent activities designed to induce fear (E. V. Walter, 1969;\nWilkinson, 1974), a position reaffirmed by a variety of con-\ntemporary scholars, counterterrorism experts, and policy\nism may be more schematically defined as the new and the\nold terrorism. He describes the new terrorism as being inter-\nnational in scope and involving the use of modern technology,\nsuch as cyberspace. Although the old terrorism laid claims to\nsome altruistic motivations for its actions, the new terrorism\nuses no nuances to hide its objectionable criminality.

At the core of the ideals of both the new and\nthe old is religious fervor. Pecuniary gain is also a primary\ncomponent of each. In the context of the present study, we\ndefine terrorism as the uncontested use of violence to achieve\nideological, political, and socioeconomic goals by state or\nnonstate actors against combatants or noncombatants.\nIn 1994, Martha Crenshaw, a leading scholar of terrorism,\nobserved that terrorism in Africa had not taken the shape of\nterrorism in the Middle East and Asia. Apparently, she was\nimplying that African governments, particularly those of the\nsub-Saharan nations, did not support international terrorism.\nToday, given the plausibility of state encouragement of elite\ndominance systems on the continent (Imershein, Rond, &\nMathis, 1992) that may influence and provide some political\nimpetus for the emergence of the new terrorism on the local\ncontinental front, Crenshaw's assertion is no longer relevant.\nElite dominance is a governing system based on pecuniary\nprivilege. Nieto (2014) defined \"the elite\" as \"a group of\npeople with a privileged position inside the political, mili-\ntary, economic, and cultural structure of nations whose deci-\nsions have very important consequences for the rest of the\nsociety.\" Elite dominance is a structural and functional part\nof most socioeconomic systems, and its political restructur-\ning is an ongoing process (Imershein et al., 1992). The elites\nas used in the article are based on C. Wright Mills's (2000)\ntypology--described as the \"Power Elite\" at the top end of\nthe power hierarchy, and sub-elites--comprising the politi-\ncal, economic, and military confidants and consultants to the\nformer group. The idea that elite dominance systems are\nassociated with the modern resurgence of terrorism in Africa\nreceives a very little inquiry. Although elite dominance as a\nperfunctory system might appear to have a distant and casual\nrelationship with terrorism, it deserves consideration, none-\ntheless. Globalization opened up information on the manifes-\ntation of elite dominance in poor and sociopolitically weak\nsocieties and has encouraged the grouping of forces to coun-\nter it. Although some of these forces follow the paths of\nsocial unrest and democratization, others rose with insurgen-\ncies and terrorism.\nThe issues examined in this article emphasize the circum-\nstances under which the various elite relationships may have\nemerged. They also analyze the related consequences--from\nthe perspectives of the conflict of social classes to the rise of\npostcolonialism, or the new terrorism. The terrorist groups\ninvolved in the new terrorism explicate struggles against\nnational and foreign interests. Given the pecuniary nature of\ncurrent terrorist practices on the continent, the question\narises: How can sub-Saharan African nations spread oppor-\ntunities for social mobility beyond the dominant elite groups?\nThe answer should provide a deeper understanding of the\nnature, creative tendencies, and sustenance of terrorism on\nthe African continent, as well as its implications for conti-\nnental and global security.\nElite Dominance\nThe forms of modernization associated with elite dominance\nsystems in colonial African States--like sub-Saharan\nAfrica--are similar to the type that Remmer (1976) identified\nin the Latin American nations, Chile and Argentina. This pat-\ntern, called the \"comprador bourgeoisie,\" is a kind of modern-\nization that is dependent on international economic forces and\nhas its roots in colonial, political, and economic domination\n(Remmer, 1976). Remmer explains that the comprador bour-\ngeoisie system has a tendency to form and align with and then\nfall prey to undemocratic forces, contrasted to the more pro-\ngressive pattern of independent bourgeoisie. Influenced by\npowerful, external systems that are beyond its control,\nRemmer argues that this pattern of bourgeoisie tends to form\na coalition of elites in both the public and private sectors, each\nwith vested interest in the underdevelopment of their respec-\ntive nations. In effect, the corresponding international eco-\nnomic control empowers them to maintain their favored\nstatuses. In the case of Chile and Argentina, these patterns\nbecame an upper-class economic coalition at the expense of\nthe lower-class groups (Remmer, 1976). The structure of the\nelite dominance in a society viewed in terms of a pyramidal\nhierarchy--a few individuals at the very top of the pyramid\ncontrol the socioeconomic and political power of the society.\nAlthough the common notion is that societies are controlled\nby a diversity of competing interest groups, in reality a very\nfew individuals control the broad stream of power centers\nacross most societies. The late sociologist, C. Wright Mills,\nprovided the fundamental premises of the elite theory. Mills,\none of the most referred elite theorists, explains that the cen-\nters of elite power in modern societies are located in the\nbureaucracies of the government, economic, and military\ninstitutions. Unlike in the premodern era, when the power of\nthe elites was concentrated in individuals such as monarchs,\nthe powers of the modern elites depend on authority and attri-\nbutes of social organizations (Mills, 2000). According to\nMills, the \"positions of the power elite enable them to tran-\nscend the ordinary environments of ordinary men and women\n(p. 4).\" To complete the elite apparatchik, middle-level elites\noccur at the spot on the pyramid below the power elites. These\ncomprise the politicians, upper-class individuals, celebrities,\nand local authorities. It is interesting that Mills noted that\nthough the power elites make the most important decisions in\nsociety, however, the decisions they make or do not make are\noften less important compared to the pivotal positions they\noccupy. In other words, at the apex of societal power in mod-\nern societies where decision making occurs, positions take\npreeminence over the capability to make the required deci-\nsions. Mills observed that \"often the power elite are so uncer-\ntain of their roles and even more often they allow their fears\nand hopes to affect their assessment of their own power (p.\n4).\" The implied paradox is that in the fear to keep the power,\nthe elites focus less on their roles than on the need to resist\nothers who may want to usurp those powers (Mills, 2000).\nEjiogu and Mosley 3\nA critical point in the political development of most post-\ncolonial states, often overlooked, involves the process\nthrough which rural elitism mushrooms into an urban form.\nTo understand the African situation of elite dominance, one\ncan draw upon instances from other societies where the\nimpact of elite dominant structures on the societal level has\nreceived significant, scholarly attention. Although in most\nprecolonial societies the relationship between the peasants\nand the local elite may have been consensual and mutually\nbeneficial in some areas of communal management, the\ncolonial evolution of the rural to urban elitism did not pro-\nvide any opportunities for such agreements in Africa. In\nother words, colonial-day peasants were not involved in the\ntransition to urban elitism, nor in the negotiations that pre-\nceded the political process handed down to the urban elite\nthe rural Mexican elite is not considered a major player in\nlocal politics, yet the maintenance of power is dependent on\nexploitation of the peasants through the use of skills of\nmanipulation and practices that were cultured over centuries.\nIn Nigeria, Usman Dan Fodio founded the northern Fulani\nOligarchy, Dan Fodio was a feudal warrior with Islamic\nMiddle Eastern origins. He created the Sokoto Caliphate, a\npolitico-religious state successor selected by the British\ncolonial authorities as they prepared to depart Nigeria. The\nCaliphate ruled Nigeria through a highly manipulative state,\nsocial, and religious process for four decades after colonial\nabdication of power. Dan Fodio's highly trained descendants\nwere able to spread this structure of dominance through a\nvery brilliant transition of a rural elite class--structured\naround traditional emirate ruling families--into a national\nmodern urban elite class.\nThe emergence, dominance, and maintenance of elitism\nin diverse cultural societies are not unilateral. Some of the\nforces influencing elitism include political and economic\nfactors, social class, ethnicity, and family. The effects of\nthese forces differ in the context of a particular analysis and\nlocality. For the most part, these systems perpetuate them-\nselves from generation to generation (Brewster, 2008).\nBrewster contends that there is a very significant dimension\nof elite dominance. Facing such an advantageous position,\nelites would take steps to maintain their status for future gen-\nerations. This is usually the point of conflict in many modern\nsocieties, where informed members of the working class\nseek to encroach upon these elite domains, sometimes with-\nout the structures of political power, social class, proper fam-\nily connection, or belonging to the dominant ethnic groups.\nSuch a revolt is potent enough to present formidable chal-\nlenges to the status quo. According to Mills (2000), the elite\napportion greater attention to the maintenance of their posi-\ntion compared to the requirements of the position.\nIn a way, economic terrorism pose challenges to the new\nurban ruling elite, particularly by the peasants excluded from\nthe negotiations that preceded the former's emergence.\nHowever, with increasing evidence of the involvement of the\nso-called elite class in the sponsorship of terrorist activities,\nthis argument diminishes. In many postcolonial states, the\nauthority of the urban elite is still fundamentally local. In sub-\nSaharan African states, the structure of the modern elite class\nis based on the primordial beliefs of the protection of kin-\nships, the maintenance of cultural domains, the advancement\nof notions of ethnic superiority, preservation of traditional\nfamily ties, and broadening of the extant spatial power base.\nHowever, the organic state, since compromising these mecha-\nnisms, created platforms for the evolution of other power-\ndominant systems, ones that are controlled by wealthy\nindividuals with amassed land and financial and other capital\nassets, all protected by networks of paid political machines\nprone to use violent reprisals against enemy systems.\nNonetheless, the real threat to urban elitism is its prejudiced\nreluctance to renegotiate its postcolonial emergence with\nlocal peasants. Intrinsically, these power-dominant systems\nclosely resemble terrorist structures. Because resilience\nlodges among the primary pillars of elite dominance, alli-\nances routinely exhibit and manipulate raw power. Generally,\nmembers of this class emerge from similar social structures.\nThis has enhanced the integration of the structures of domi-\nnant institutions in society--through which the alliance of the\ngovernment, economic, and military elite is coordinated and\nmaintained (Mills, 2000). Referencing the colonial legacy of\nMexico's political elite, Nieto (2014) argued that corruption\nwithin the Mexican cultural, political, and economic systems\nis rooted in colonialism. His account examines the decline of\ntraditional societies and traditionally held customs, norms,\nand values as a consequence of a colonial hierarchical man-\nagement system vested in the privileged acquisition of pro-\nduction, labor, and land from the locals. In addition, Nieto\nlooks at one aspect of the colonial theory and concludes that\nthe manifest effect of economic, political, and psychological\nconstraints and disenfranchisements established by the colo-\nnial system is the emergence of corruption through nepotism\nand the social and economic underdevelopment of the people.\nHe noted that the conflict between the traditional values of\nindigenous Mexican citizens and those of the mixed breed\ncitizens of indigenous and European descent was also a clash\nof the law and its application. His position can be illustrated,\nsimilarly, under the Durkheimian analysis of the transition\nfrom the traditional mechanistic to the organic society of\n17th-century France. In each of these situations, the inability\nto control a fast changing society easily led to hemorrhages in\nboth law maintenance and criminal innovations. But in the\ncase of the colonialized, the path of change to the organic\nsociety was forced--not negotiated--by an external power,\nthe colonial system, whose primary goal was resource expro-\npriation. Thus, this conflict built into the laws, and the institu-\ntions and models of governance as corrupt modifiers have\nendured. The crisis point in this change involved the locals\nadapting to new ways of doing things as part of the norm. The\npolitical elite has, since, entrenched the system of ruling by\ncorruption in the postcolonial governments.\n4 SAGE Open\nThe adoption of corruption as a mode of governance has\nbecome so pervasive in Mexico that a magazine survey\nreported by Nieto showed that, in as much as the gains of\ncorruption are usefully applied, 48% of all Mexicans did not\nseem worried by the status quo. In addition, 70% of the\nrespondents support official theft if the public share in the\nloot. Seen in this light of public acceptance of corruption, by\nfar, the greatest loss to the nation is the modification of tradi-\ntional norms and values of the society regarding the means to\nachievable goals. These systems of elite rule by corruption\nare not unique to Mexico. Rather, they reflect the poor gov-\nernance of postcolonial sub-Saharan African states.\nElite dominance restricts social mobility within some\ngroups, sometimes to as little as 1% of the population in\nmany postcolonial economies (Coe & Davidson, 2011;\nmobility as \"the rise and fall of individuals between social\nand economic groups,\" which depends on access to opportu-\nnities structured around political, social, and economic\npower schemas, controlled by the dominant elite groups in\nsociety. He notes that social mobility in Britain is limited to\nabout 7% of the population, who are, mostly, graduates of\nelite private schools. This practice is a form of social engi-\nneering. Elite dominance by nepotism--shared personal\nrelations that are, originally, a part of the British Monarchy.\nIt spread abroad as a tool of control in the colonial adminis-\ntrative structure (Rodney, 1974). Elite dominance practices\noccur at different levels of the societal structure, such as in\nthe form of legacy admissions in U.S. Ivy League colleges, a\nnational ideology of meritocracy and individual opportuni-\nties, notwithstanding. Colleges apply elite privilege practices\nas avenues for colleges to retain financial donations, family\nloyalty, as well as for maintaining tradition (Coe & Davidson,\nspread of social mobility and economic opportunities for the\nelite class resulted in a strong reductive effect on the global\ncompetitive nature of Britain. Through a network of institu-\ntional and relational arrangements, the economic elite in\nnations like Britain and Germany utilize bureaucratic power,\nownership, and social capital to maintain their dominance\n(Windolf, 1998). Yepiskoposian, Margarian, Andonian, and\nRashidvash's (2011) examination of cultural change among\nTurkish-speaking people of Northwestern Iran reveal that\nelite dominance imposes fundamental cultural changes, such\nas the replacement of the language of the subordinate groups.\nSimilarly, in Northern Nigeria, the elite dominance struc-\ntures of the Hausa\u00adFulani ruling families seem to have\nreplaced a significant proportion of native languages of the\nindigent ethnic groups with the Hausa language (Crawford,\n1979). In many instances, for the purpose of accomplishing\ngoals and creating opportunities, and to protect group ideo-\nlogical and social advantages, elites in different societies cre-\nate structural stratifications of class, ethnicity, and religion.\nNieto's (2014) definition of the elite contends that their\ndecisions have important consequences for the rest of society,\nespecially when social groups competing for political and\neconomic interests become oblivious to the fact that the popu-\nlar direction of political power is for the general societal good\nand well-being. We examine the salient consequences of elite\ndominance, next, in relation to the emergence and activities of\nprominent terrorist groups in colonial and postcolonialAfrica.\nTerrorism as a Postcolonial Conflict of\nSocial and Economic Stagnation\nnoted that Africa remains an area largely omitted in the con-\nversations on the war on terror. Generally, disaffection and\ndisdain was the response toAl-Qaeda's initial call forAfrican\nMuslims to join its terrorist network in the sub-Saharan\nregion. Although as reported in a few nations like Somalia,\nSudan and, more recently, Nigeria, Al-Qaeda-style terrorism\nappeals to some adherents of the Islamic faith, resulting in\nthe growth of formidable followership (Mair, 2003).\nHowever, because of the socioeconomic hardships in sub-\nSaharan African, instead of exportation, terrorism acts\ninward against the state and its economic institutions.\nReported cases of terrorist incidents in sub-Saharan Africa\nwas an annual average decline of about 50% of reported ter-\nrespectively. In particular, the Nigerian situation has been\nreported incidents of terrorism in Nigeria increased by 300%.\ntime highs of 75 and 62 incidents, respectively (Global\nTerrorism Database, 2011). In general, for each succeeding\ndecade, the pattern emerging from both the Nigerian and the\nwider sub-Saharan data sets is one of mounting terrorist\nincidents.\nScholars have reiterated the relationship between global-\nization, the nation state, and terrorism. Because of the factors\nof transnational human mobility (e.g., wars, natural disasters,\ntrade and commerce), the development of nations and cul-\ntures is influenced by the external political, economic, and\nsocial forces (Remmer, 1976). Globalization, defined as \"the\nfree movement of capital, goods, knowledge, manpower, and\nservices among countries due to the increased technological\nand scientific improvements and diminished state-centric\ngrate cultures across diverse regions of the world. In spite of\nthe advantages of the socioeconomic and cultural dimen-\nsions of globalization, the phenomenon has dire implications\nfor the security of nations. The forces of globalization have\nconsiderably weakened the concept of the sovereign nation\nEjiogu and Mosley 5\nstate which is the bedrock of the fight against terrorism\n(Demir & Varlik, 2015). Many states in the demanding ter-\nrorist regions of the world, such as the Middle East, can no\nlonger sustain the security and stability required to contain\nthe persuasions and activities of terrorists on their own soil.\nDemir and Varlik (2015) shared the view that the world as a\nglobal unit cannot defeat terrorism while undermining the\nnation state. It is now well documented that the globalization\nof terrorism enlarges, considerably, the reach and power of\nits activities, especially in its advancement and use of tech-\nnological operations platforms (Demir & Varlik, 2015;\nences of globalization is the worsening of socioeconomic\ninequality. It also influences the creation of multiple chan-\nnels of international interdependencies beyond the interde-\npendence of states (Demir & Varlik, 2015), through which\nnew forms of powers are created and new knowledge of\npolitical and socioeconomic inequalities, which feed discon-\ntent and ways of challenging dominions, are being learned\nand practiced. Through the enhancement of political and\neconomic opportunities and global cultural integration, glo-\nbalization, in a sense, creates conditions which trigger the\nsocioeconomic polarization of society, the strengthening of\nelite dominance, easy access to terrorist ideals through free\nand cheap technological platforms, and the weakening of the\npowers of individual nation states.\nReflecting on the genesis of contemporary terrorism\nforms in Africa, external accounts contend that piracy in\nSomalia is a result of the lack of a rule of law, insecurity, and\nthe absence of government. Somali pirate groups contributed\nO'Rourke, Mason, & King, 2011). However, insider accounts\nfrom Somalia suggest that piracy is a survivalist response to\neconomic despoliation, degraded fishing grounds by interna-\ntional toxic waste dumping, illegal trawler fishing, and\ndrought. Pirate groups in Somalia organize along clan lines\nin isolated towns and regions (Ploch et al., 2011). Similarly,\nNiger Delta piracy in Nigeria arose from estranged fishing\ncommunities angered by the degradation of their sensitive,\ndeltaic ecosystem by petroleum exploration companies\n(Ogundiya & Amzat, 2006). State terrorism in Nigeria\nreceived global attention as the \"Niger Delta Crisis\" when\nthe Nigerian military, at the behest of the Anglo-Dutch Shell\nOil conglomerate, raised Ogoni villages because of local dis-\nturbance and riots on its facilities. By the time the military\nleft Ogoni, about 1,000 villagers were dead and another\nThe increasing inroads of Islamic fundamentalism in\nNorthern Nigeria and the shift of political power to the South\nin 1999 encouraged the politically motivated Boko Haram\nband. The Great Lakes region of East Africa has also wit-\nnessed the incessant problems of insurgency and insurrection\nin the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Uganda. The\nsolid mineral resources in this region of sub-Saharan Africa\nattract all sorts of foreign interests, insurgency, and rebellions.\nThis has resulted in heightened weapons trafficking, kidnap-\nping, illegal mining and an encouragement of terrorist activi-\nties by dissident groups in this area (Daley, 2006; Hayes &\nchoice material in high-tech industries. Its value to industries\nin the Silicon Valley is such that the U.S. government desig-\nnates it a strategic mineral (Hayes & Burge, 2003; Montague,\n2002). Beyond the traditional, political, and ethnic contests\nand rivalry in the DRC, international investment in illegiti-\nmate mining operations finances rebel forces, thus ensuring\nthe continuing instability of the nation through conflicts, fraud,\nofficial corruption, and the weakening of civil institutions.\nAlso implicated in mineral exploitation are the armies of\nneighboring African nations, Uganda and Rwanda, which\nsecure companies and serve as conduits and stakeholders in\nmining operations (Montague, 2002). Visible defects in the\npresent-day governance infrastructure in many African states\nindicate that the elitist reinforcement of the corrupt ideals of\ncolonialism poses barriers to the proper domestication of\nWestern democratic cultures inherited after independence.\nMost postcolonialAfrican nations embraced the colonial state-\ncraft ideology of undermining the rights of occupied citizens\n(Dickson, 1989). Early manifestations of this misrule became\nevident in a series of coups and counter-coups in sub-Saharan\nAfrica (Ciliers, 2003). The continental leadership of the\nAfrican Union (2004) is concerned with the international vari-\nants of terrorism, while subnational and state terrorism, such\nas corrupt leadership is more critical to Africa. Studies on ter-\nrorism assume that only traditional ideological concepts of\nreligion, leftism, conservatism, and ethnonationalism typify\nterrorist activities (Martins, 2009). But, a critical review of\ngovernance on the continent reveals that terrorism underwent\na form of local domestication, resulting from the mass percep-\ntion of alienation from modern, elite progress, as well as from\nthe politico-corporate plunder and the squandering of the con-\ntinent's natural resources during the postcolonial era (L.\nWalter, 1996). A significant portion of terrorist violence in\nsub-Saharan Africa is unidirectional and vertical against busi-\nnesses and economic activities. In response, African govern-\nments resort to state terrorism, brutalization, unlawful arrests,\ndetention, and torture. State terrorism uses clandestine\nmethods, including murder, to check political opposition\n(Clutterbuck, 1986). The point made is that in these confronta-\ntions, it is not clear when insurgency evolves into terror or\nwhenterroristsbecomeinsurgents(Kilcullen,2005).Ogundiya\n(2009) suggested that to understand the causes of terrorism, it\nis essential to delineate its typologies. Otenyo (2004) explored\nBritish authorities used the word \"terrorism\" to describe the\nactivities of the Mau land and freedom fighters. He associates\nthe internal domestic processes in Kenya with the terrorist\nattacks in that nation. In New Terrorism, Otenyo describes\nincreased religious content and motivation, the practice of\nmartyrdom, the use of strategy and coordinated attacks, esca-\nlation of terror networks, and advances in the usage of\n6 SAGE Open\ntechnology, for example, cyberspace. With regard to the rise of\njihadist terror adherents, Otenyo (2004) contended that the\nmain thrust of the elucidations of global terrorism is its explan-\natory power. However, he questioned the role of poverty in the\nNew Terrorism. Otenyo believes that poverty has little to do\nwith the rise of the new terrorism. This may be true only when\nstated in such easy, palliative terms. But poverty is a relative\nterm--its dimensions spread much wider than the poverty of\nthe stomach. It is much more than the act of not having enough\nresources on which to subsist. Poverty encompasses many\ningrained psychological dimensions, such as the poverty of\nbelieving in a national ideology, hopelessness, losing trust in\nsocietal leadership, and living an insecure lifestyle.\nOtenyo (2004) equally noted that the new terrorism could\nbe associated with regional waves of Islamic fundamental-\nreturn of Ayatollah Khomeini to Iran, and Osama bin Laden\nand the Palestinian Intifada in 1991. These episodes acted as\nmicrocosms, delivering other power interdependencies\nacross the globe, eliciting transmissions of knowledge about\nchallenging dominions within other dimensions of struggle.\nButtressing Otenyo's wave of the New Terrorism in Africa,\nrorist incidents, the United States's war on terror has accen-\ntuated the level of insecurity in the nations of the Horn of\nAfrica, including Kenya, Somalia, Eritrea, Tanzania, Uganda,\nComoros, Djibouti, and Sudan.\" Insecurity in this region\nemanates from the diverse forms of state and nonstate\nactors--criminal and terrorist elements engaged as guerril-\nlas, bandits, cattle rustlers, pirates, liberation movements,\nvigilantes, and other diverse forms of state terror players.\nUnlike Otenyo's observation that poverty has meager influ-\nences on the rise of the new terrorism in Africa, Kagwanja\nemphasizes that poverty, chronic underdevelopment and a\ndeep sense of marginalization, and the negative forces of\neconomic liberalization and the historical linkages to the\nMiddle East are influential to the new terrorism in Africa.\nIn his book Dilemmas of Weak States: Africa and\nTransnational Terrorism in the Twenty-First Century,\nMentan (2004) examined the problem of weak and failed\nstates and their relationships to the rise of terrorist activities\ninAfrica. He clarified that the root causes of conflicts and the\nweak states of nations in Africa are not the products of a sur-\nplus inflow of conventional arms from Europe, Asia, and\nAmerica--due to the war on terror or any other war, but,\nrather, the failure of African governments to abide by the\nsocial contract between the citizens and the state. The failure\nof these governments to deliver on the promises of statehood\nresults from corruption, incompetence, a lack of responsibil-\nity to governing roles, and a general misunderstanding of the\nnotions of statehood and leadership, all of which leads to a\ngeneral pauperization of geographic and socioeconomic\nfringes and hinterlands and a mass migration of the young\nand audacious to the urbanized centers of government power,\nwhere messages that would feed their socioeconomic and\npolitical discontent are free and easy to come by. Mentan\nargues that, the variables that compound these problems in\nAfrica include the following:\n1. Chronic conflicts that shatter economies and create\nvast refugee camps\n2. Corrupt, incompetent, and undemocratic African\ngovernments, and.\n3. International political and economic systems--con-\ncerned about Realpolitik, oil supply, and the interest\nof global finance than about the well-being of\nAfricans (p. ix).\nThe political and economic elite maintain a hegemony on\ntheir nation states in Africa, which enhances the ideological\nvacuum of leadership and development (Mentan, 2004). This\nvacuum, some suggests, derives from the inability of these\nleaders to differentiate their personal interest from the soci-\netal goals, thus manifesting the creation of personality cults\nof leadership that is accountable to nothing and to no one.\nMills (2000) has explained that often the modern \"Power\nElite\" assign greater attention to keeping their position than\nthe critical role of making decisions that would advance the\nprogress of their societies. The primary problem of the\nAfrican leadership brand of elite dominance is found in its\nideological vacuum, replete with ill-conceived rules and reg-\nulations, and a lack of adherence to its own rules (Mentan,\n2004). Mentan makes note of the following statement by a\nprolific South African-born author, Gavin Williams, which\nillustrates the degree of cynicism associated with the pros-\npects of this ideological vacuum for leadership and develop-\nment in Nigeria.\nThe Nigerian bourgeoisie lack the commitment of a religious\nsocialist or national character of the rationalizing, capital-\naccumulating, surplus-expropriating classes of Britain, Russia,\nGermany, or Japan during their period of industrialization. In\nfact, the Nigerian bourgeoisie does have an ideology in the sense\nof a theoretical legitimization of the status quo. It is found in the\nconcept of development. (p. 6)\nThe reasons for the weaknesses of African states listed by\nelite apparatchiks of leadership in many African states: (a)\ndependence, (b) lack of a coherent ideology, (c) softness, (d)\nlack of a technical and analytical capacity to comprehend\nimpending consequences of state actions in the current inter-\nnational system, (e) hostile international environment that is\nimpatient with local African needs, and (f) poor record of\nstatehood. The excessive appointment of family and associ-\nates in government positions and propensity to advancing\ntheir pecuniary interests in governance plays a major role in\nweakening the elite dominant leadership in sub-Saharan\nAfrican states. These factors which we explore next,\nEjiogu and Mosley 7\ncontribute and boost the social and economic costs of terror-\nism on the continent.\nSocial and Economic Cost of Terrorism\nTerrorism literature has revised the notion that terrorism is an\nirrational act. The most abject form of terrorism--suicide ter-\nrorism--has overcome the conventional wisdom of irrational-\nity? Observers of suicide terrorism say that it is a\nwell-coordinated and organized practice, as has been the case\nfor other forms terrorism. Just as well, terrorism can no longer\nbe described as attacks against noncombatant targets, alone\n(Moghadam, 2006), because of full-fledged, state-seeking ter-\nrorist groups in the middle-east, such as (Islamic State of Iraq\nand the Levant (ISIL), regularly attack and engage armies of\nsovereign nations, dispossessing them of their sovereign\nspaces. If suicide terrorism defined as attacks by which success\nis contingent on the death of its perpetrator (Moghadam, 2006),\nin what ways might we define socioeconomic terrorism, the\nprimary interest of the present article? Newman (2006) stated\nthat knowledge of underlying sources of conflict in society is\nfundamental to understanding the specific incidents and cate-\ngories of terrorism more than the examination of the root causes\nwhich are more useful for analytical purposes when considered\nin conjunction with the precipitant factors of terrorism. As\nNewman describes the root causes of terrorism in terms of the\n\"forms of causal relationships between underlying social, eco-\nnomic, political, and demographic conditions,\" the differences\nbetween underlying social conflicts and the aforementioned\nroot causes is semantic in the African context. In many sub-\nSaharan African nations, the economic costs of terrorism are\npoorly accounted. Frey, Luechinger, and Stutzer (2004) main-\ntained that the cost of terrorism to the general well-being of the\nindividual citizen exceeds narrow economic repercussions. A\nquantification of the real cost of terrorism is limited by simple\nquantitative comparisons of terrorism by the number of inci-\ndents (see Figures 1-3), human casualty figures, types of\nweapon used, reliance on media reports and official statistics,\nwhich have problems of underreporting, bias, and other\nfluctuating methodologies. To support their position, Frey et al.\n(2004) examined the major aspects of the economy impacted\nby terrorism (i.e., foreign direct investment, foreign trade, tour-\nism, stock market, and urban economy), and concluded that,\nFrequency\nSource.

We submit that social disorganization and eco-\nnomic depression can explain the subsequent deviance of\ndomestic terrorism (Sandler & Walter, 2004). Examining ter-\nrorist violence from an analogous position, Abadie (2004)\nexplained that, if levels of political freedom are considered,\nrisks of terrorism in poorer nations are not less than similar\nrisks in wealthier nations. Domestic terrorism accounts for\nabout 80% of terrorist activity around the world, compared to\ntransnational terrorism, which attracts greater global attention\n(Abadie, 2004). Poverty is, indeed, a potential trigger of terror-\nism for the globalized world (Abrahamsen, 2005; Easterly,\n2006). In the context of the present analysis, we suggest that the\npartnership between the local expropriation interests of the\ndominant elite business and governing class and the interests of\nforeign multinational groups has a relationship to sociopolitical\nconflicts in sub-Saharan Africa (Sofiri, 2007). According to\nMentan (2004), this collaboration lacks a coherent national\ndevelopmental ideology. For instance, the Niger Delta crisis of\nthe 1990s was a Nigerian dilemma that revealed the degree of\nsocioeconomic disaffection in the country--a practical mani-\nfestation of a people's economic predicament in the midst of a\nhegemonic and exploitative institution. The structure of the\ngovernmental process in Nigeria enables local exploitation, but\ndoes not benefit indigent communities (Ogundiya & Amzat,\n2006), perhaps describing a limited technical and analytical\ncapacity to comprehend impending consequences of state\nactions within the global system. Comparatively, China wel-\ncomed global investors into its economy with a grounded\nnational developmental ideology and focus. One imagines\nwhat the Chinese sociopolitical state (even with the remnants\nof its fast receding communist structure intact) would look like\nwithout the audacious plan to provide adequate opportunities\nfor social mobility to all its citizens. The terrorist crisis in\nNigeria, for instance, as displayed in the Niger Delta region, is\nemblematic of two competing security positions (Okeke-\nUzodike & Isike, 2009). However, there is the state-centric\ninterest, consisting of the elite dominant governing structures\nand its international allies, while on the other is the human\nangle, made up of the militia and their communities. Within\nthis ultra-contentious scenario, whose security interests are\ngovernments elected to represent, and whose economic inter-\nests are the terrorists set to protect? The Nigerian state's pri-\nmary focus on the protection of foreign interests, without\nequally articulating a similar agenda for the interests of its citi-\nzens, is a reflection of its dependence on a hostile international\nenvironmentthatisimpatientwithlocalAfricanneeds (Mentan,\n2004). The zeal of religious extremists in Nigeria seems to\nrelate to socioeconomic disorientation as well. This is the pri-\nmary dilemma of the Nigerian terrorism situation. State-created\nsocial, economic, and political imbalances in Nigeria have\nincreased in the past three decades (Okeke-Uzodike & Isike,\n2009). The case of the Boko Haram sect does not differ much\nwhen examined from the perspective of broken down state and\nsocial institutions, and the diminishing levels of state control\nfound in the inability to assure the dues of contractarian citizen-\nship. Profligate leadership, fraud, corruption, and resource\nexpropriation do not endear civic citizenship. It is as if the\nsocial, political, and economic damage, imposed by decades of\npoor leadership across the continent have awoken and embold-\nened these terrorist groups to challenge the status quo.\nNeocolonial Theory of Localization\nAccording to Durkheim's anomie theory, under the precepts\nof the social changes that beset France during and after the\nIndustrial and French revolutions of the 18th century, eco-\nnomic inequality was a significant element of the increase of\ncriminal behavior and not just the breakdown of the tradi-\ntional French society. Similarly, multinational corporations\ncreate an environment for crime by enabling huge economic\ninequality in developing societies. The same patterns of\nurban elitism and crime that occurred in Western and Eastern\nEurope during their periods of modernization are currently\ntaking place in Asia and Africa (Vold, Bernard, & Snipes,\n2001). However, the major differences may be glimpsed\nfrom the ideological vacuum from which societal develop-\nment in nations like Nigeria are structured and undertaken by\nthe national leadership (see Mentan, 2004). Growth patterns\nin many developing nations often do not follow real develop-\nment (United Nations Industrial Development Organizations\n[UNIDO], 2011). The acclaimed dynamism of the Nigerian\naround a rush for Nigeria's natural resources, anchored\naround the Niger Delta region. This is reflective of colonial-\nism or the rush for the golden age of California gold mines in\nthe United States. Today, this situation has set up bands of\ndissidents seeking their own path of the lucre, some through\ninstruments of state authority, and others through the ploy of\nterrorism (Sofiri, 2007). In contrast to the contemporary\ncreed of economic terrorism, postmodern terrorism moved\naway from the militant-only anarchist and leftist movements\nof the late 19th century to a more ethnically based rationalist\nmovement with political upfront units (L. Walter, 1969). The\nproblem of locating an ideological position and framework\nfor terrorism in sub-Saharan Africa is similar to factors that\nprevent total and direct ascription of terrorism to exclusive\nstate-sponsored terrorist activities globally. The closest ideo-\nlogical brand pertinent to terrorism in sub-Saharan Africa\nappears to be \"economic ethnonationalism\" (Ogundiya,\nran Africa reflects the dynamic power of globalization's\ninformation age to open up communities long held back by\nclosed governance systems to the reality of socioeconomic\nmobility and the ability to be involved in the determination\nEjiogu and Mosley 9\nof their own destinies. It has been observed that populations\nunaffected by national political institutions develop little\npolitical interests and, hence, are most unlikely to become\npolitically involved (Welfing, 1979). However, today, to the\nextent that governance in sub-Saharan Africa has remained\nunresponsive to the needs of its citizens, this position seems\nto have taken a new turn. Since colonialism cannot be justi-\nfied, then, correspondingly, indigenous occupation, even\nunder altruistic considerations, also cannot.\nTraditionally, colonialism refers to \"the establishment of\ndomination over a geographical external political unit,\nmostly inhabited by people of a different race and culture,\nwhere the domination is political and economic, and the col-\nony exists subordinated and dependent on the mother coun-\nthe elimination of foreign control of a state or territory, and\nthe control and exploitation of subordinate groups pass to the\ndominant group (Tatum, 1994). Internal colonialism repro-\nduces many of the same characteristics of the former colo-\nnizing group (Gabbidon & Greene, 2009). In the book Race,\nEthnicity, Crime and Justice, Shaun Gabbidon (2010) offers\na cross-national explanation of these colonial constructs. He\nargues that people respond differently to the same forms of\nalienation. In probabilistic terms, people may differ in their\nadoption of the same process of oppression (Tatum, 1994).\nSimilarly, in his book, Sociology in a Changing World,\nWilliam Kornblum claims that the characteristics of internal\ncolonialism are related to the subjugation of ethnic groups,\nwhere the colonized did not enter the union voluntarily. This\ninvolves dominance and the destruction of the culture of the\ncolonized by the colonial group. The colonizer begins to view\nthe colonized as a biologically and sociopolitically inferior\nspecies (Kornblum, 2007). Kornblum's colonial theory shad-\nows an intrinsic perspective that manifests in native neocolo-\nnial tendencies of governance systems in African nations like\nNigeria, today: the growing elitist perception of the other as\nthe socioeconomic nothings. This perception is invidious with\nthe concentration of poverty at one end of the sub-Saharan\nunderdevelopment space, against extreme riches at the other\nend, under held by less than 1% of the population (Oxfam,\n2014). Examining this negative trend of socioeconomic and\npolitical aggrandizement within the centrum of a colonial\ntheory, a certain peculiar perspective is derivable. The con-\ncept of internal colonialism identifies clear similarities\nbetween the relationship of colonial exploitation and domi-\nnance, which existed in the past between countries and the\nrelationship which exists, locally, in some countries today.\nInternal colonialism is structurally described as a society\nwithin a society, based on linguistic, ethnic, cultural, political\nnative dominance is anachronistic, being that, notwithstand-\ning, the interstitial union of numerous ethnicities, distinct\ngroups tend to form mostly from dominant urban elites and\nfamilies that assumed rulership from the departing colonials.\nThe postindependence nationalization of peripheral colonial\nbusinesses and industry prepared the receptacle for these elite\ngroup forms. This form of dominance, which emerged across\nethnic lines, has urban elitism as its common denominating\nfactor. The urban elite may emanate through high educational\nattainment, economic wealth, family connection, or through\nsheer force of political aggression. Domination in the local\nneocolonial parlance may not necessarily be ethnically ori-\nented, but, rather, a creation of a system of dominance playing\nagainst its own goals of governance. Here, class conflict is\nequally relevant whether the dominating groups are foreign or\nlocal. In contrast to traditional forms of colonialism, the local\ncolonial system is a union entered willingly as a unit (Fanon,\nSimilar to the common identification of autocratic systems\nwith inequality, Albertus and Menaldo (2014) found that eco-\nnomic elites impede the redistribution of resources, even dur-\ning democratic regimes. Using a global, panel data set,\nregimes are better able to avoid the trap of elite dominance by\ncrafting a new constitution protected from the prejudices of\nthe outgoing regime. The impact of elite dominance on the\nunderdevelopment and marginalization of minorities--\nwomen and the poor in India--suggests discriminatory prac-\ntices that are, essentially, underinvestments in education and\nother core developmental areas that are essential to uplifting\nthe socioeconomic conditions of the populace. The top 5% of\nthe population owns the greater share of land in India.\nExamining the increasing legitimization of corrupt practices\nin India, Jauregui (2014) discovered that the term jugaad is\nused as a euphemism for allowing corruption, particularly in\nthe sense that it is a necessary and acceptable vice to achieve\nthe general societal goal for economic superiority. According\nto Jauregui, jugaad is a sort of \"provisional agency\" for attain-\ning the so-called `better future'. Similarly, in Nigeria, the\nterm settlement is used as a precondition to allowing the cor-\nrupters and partners unquestioned access to their loot. Why, in\nmost postcolonial states, has corruption become socially\nacceptable, rather than a noxious crime against society's col-\nlective values of integrity and equity? It is possible that, by\nunconsciously redefining and eroding the distinctions\nbetween virtue and vice in the minds of the public, elite domi-\nnant influences and practices, steamed in a heritage of colo-\nnial corruption, replicated itself across a broad spectrum of\nsocioeconomic and political platforms. These forms of elite\ndominance, exemplified in India, mirror the patterns in local\nneocolonial dominance forms in sub-SaharanAfrican nations.\nThe paradox is that these elite dominance practices lower\nspending on developmental projects. At the same time, they\nincrease spending on nondevelopmental interests (Pal &\nexamination of elite dominance and ethnic divisions in\nPakistan as a Political Economy of Growth without\nDevelopment.

This is an indication that Nigeria, like\nPakistan, witnessed growth but not development (Easterly,\ndeveloping economy, the proportion of Nigerians living in\npanies a widening crisis of socioeconomic inequality (British\nmillion (74.6%) lived below the poverty line (Figure 4), the\ndegree of this problem in Nigeria is herculean.\nToday, entrenched and dysfunctional forms of urban elit-\nism and socioeconomic dominance systems are rampant in\nmost sub-Saharan African nations. The governments on the\ncontinent generally allocate resource exploration rights to\nfriends, family and associates -since the governments, busi-\nness leaders, bureaucrats and politicians relate as members of\nthe elite groups. They act as the postcolonial conquerors of the\nAfrican continental landcape. The operational methods of\nthese elitist cliques are analogous to branched cults, with the\nmeans and power to free access of poorly regulated national,\nsocioeconomic and political portfolios. Very recently,\nOlusegun Obasanjo, the former Nigeria president, accused a\nnoted Nigerian business personality that he intentionally made\nher a billionaire. Obasanjo mentioned that his intention was to\ncreate 50 billionaires in Nigeria, but sadly he could only create\nhalf of that number before the end of his leadership. What cri-\nteria of leadership inform a president to create a class of 50\nbillionaires out of a population of 150 million citizens, where\nmore than 74.6% live under the threshold of poverty? Through\norganized forms of elite manipulations and group dominance,\nthese \"power elites\" have made it, virtually, impossible for the\nvast majority of continental Africans to attain the, seemingly,\nmeager goal of individual well-being. The inverse of Robert\nMerton's (1938) strain theory is relevant, here, to accentuate\nthe strain derived from a lack of regulation or enforcement of\nthe core governance structures inAfrica. These structures have\nbeen diminishing since the postcolonial era. Such strain affects\nthe populace, which struggles to assume the local elitist stan-\ndard of socioeconomic somethings. Although colonial admin-\nistrations effectively and appropriately utilized and regulated\nthe structures of its dominance for the sole goal of resource\nexpropriation, postcolonial African governments appropriated\nonly a part of the structure that processed resource expropria-\ntion. Under a variety of epicurean maladies, they, unwittingly,\nallowed the core regulatory and administrative superstructure\nto diminish to nothingness. As a result, now you find govern-\nments that are vastly limited by undefined business processes\n(Mapuva & Chari, 2010). A ramification of these loose gov-\nernmental procedures is the increasing loss of confidence in\ngovernment's ability to assure the social contract between it\nand its citizenry. Terrorism--and its venture into the hardcore\ncriminality that is so symptomatically concerned with uplift-\ning the economic status of the terrorist--becomes a radius on\nthe circumference of a backlash, which may well be a path to\na definition of sub-Saharan Africa's brand of postcolonial\npanic. Remonstrating, thus, is an emblematic syllogism.\nMapuva and Chari (2010) agreed that, with neocolonial prac-\ntices of Africa's leadership class, traditional colonialism is no\nlonger to blame for Africa's problems.\nCrenshaw debunked the claim of direct causative associa-\ntion of terrorism with extenuating circumstances of ideologi-\ncal persuasions, Western permissiveness, correlates of\npsychopathology, and nationalism. She argued that most ter-\nrorist acts emanate from direct, well thought, rational inten-\ntions, where the social, economic, and political environment\nis merely contextual. A causative factor of terrorism,\nCrenshaw contends, consists of long-term preconditions and\nimmediate and specific precipitants. Among these precondi-\ntions, the most impacting permissive factors are moderniza-\ntion, social facilitation, and a particular government's attitude\nand approach to terrorism. However, the terrorist's ideologi-\ncal permutations receive transnational audiences. Crenshaw\nsuggests that the tangent of mass passivity and elite disaffec-\ntion could, in fact, be a significant causative condition. She\npoints out that, although terrorism may not always be a direct\nresultant of oppression, it may result from weakness of group\nnegotiation (Crenshaw, 1981). If one considers the level of\nnaivet\u00e9 surrounding postcolonial governments in Africa,\ncolonial theory, viewed as a model of oppressive governance,\ncould be inheritable and Orwellian in concept. Na\u00efvet\u00e9\ndefines the lessons learned by these elitist class from the\ncolonial dominators; the incomplete assimilation of the colo-\nnial tactics, appear to extend, ideologically, such oppressive\ntendencies in, more-or-less, the same way, but couched in\nmore localized argot and crude operational methods.\nTo appreciate the emerging scenario of local neocolo-\nnialism, we can compare the models of economic gover-\nnance in both eras. Because of an abiding interest in\npostcolonial expropriation, we find that the struggle for\nexpropriated resource control endures in the African con-\ntext as a task left unfinished by the continent's colonial\ngovernments. The triangle of colonial resource expropria-\ntion has not changed in Africa. Using the Niger Delta phe-\nnomenon in Nigeria as a case study, the triangle still\nconsists of the foreign multinational entities and the local,\npolitical, and business bourgeoisie. But, unlike in the past,\nwhen the third arm of the triangle was that of the colonial\nEjiogu and Mosley 11\ngovernment, which provided the legal authority, organiza-\ntion, and security for the enterprise, today, indigenous\nAfrican governments play that crucial role. The major\nproblem for those who agitate against these forms of\nunregulated dominance is that the \"thin line\" between\nfighting for economic freedom and terrorism have become\nextremely indistinct. Local postcolonial leadership in sub-\nSaharan Africa remains an iconic riddle awaiting explana-\nlacking resources and unable to better the lot of their citi-\nzens, were known to manage power through subtle\n\"regimes of terror (Welfing, 1979).\" It is however difficult\nto support such rudimentary angles of exoneration today,\nespecially having seen the great amount of resources made\navailable by providence to nations like Nigeria in the past\nfour decades, yet without better results.\nArguments that terrorism has little to do with economics\nbut more with politics, frustration and seated feelings of\nindignity, or to poverty and limited educational opportuni-\nties (Krueger & Maleckova, 2003) rely too heavily on the\ncommon religious ideology of terrorism. In reality, it is dif-\nficult to consider a separation between political aspirations\nand economic manifestations. The preeminent raison d\n'etat for governance, according to the late French scholar of\npunishment, Foucault, is to protect the people and their\ncommonwealth (Garland, 1997). Paraphrasing this\nFoucauldian perspective, politics is inseparable from eco-\nnomic aspirations. This reality is evident in the history and\npractice of sub-Saharan African terrorism. The confusion\nsurrounding African governments involves understanding\nthat, unlike traditional colonial governments, the former are\nnot governing a conquered people. They are governing\ntheir own citizens. Considering the vicarious nature of ter-\nrorism evident in sub-Saharan Africa, there is evidence of\nan elitist, clique-based pattern of political and economic\ndomination. Terrorism, as it appears, emanates from current\ndisagreements among conscious, local groups within the\nsociety. The discrepancy is over the terms set for the socio-\neconomic-related distributions to the commons by the rul-\ning elite. The apparent problem here is that such\narrangements are somewhat skewed toward criminal and\nviolent patterns of negotiation. Dominant class-conscious-\nness is a political and theoretical concept common to most\nsocieties and underlies progressive challenges to the order\nof things. In Africa, the problem with this dominant strat-\negy is that it disproportionately opposes progress. So why\nhas there been a sudden upsurge in terrorist activities on the\ncontinent in the last three decades? The most promising\nanswer could be that globalization and modern communi-\ncation technology has created an awareness of the right to\nliberty and the good life. Media displays of the irreverent\nprofligacy of the political class reduce belief in political\nand governmental processes. Furthermore, as evidenced by\nthe Niger Delta and Somalian examples, socioeconomic\nterrorism has proven to be very lucrative.\nConclusion and Recommendation\nAfrica's security threat to the West and to the world is a con-\ncern pondered only rhetorically, albeit in contemporary,\ninternational conversations. Indeed, in terms of threats, sub-\nSaharan Africa has not merited an emergency call. The\ncauses of terrorist activities in sub-Saharan Africa--like\nthose in the Nigerian entanglement--which have been the\nfocus of this article, rely on a socioeconomic liberation ide-\nology. There is also the confrontation of contending political\nand religious ideological issues in Africa and, unmistakably,\nin the emergence of destructive sects like the Boko Haram.\nSub-SaharanAfrican terrorism relates to its continuing strug-\ngle with resource expropriation and socioeconomic disorien-\ntation. Whereas in the colonial past, the fight was against the\ncolonialists, today the colonialists are indigenous and have\nformed partnerships with foreign multinationals. In defer-\nence to securitization theories on Africa, the continent may,\nindeed, be potent, with occlusions to threaten the global sys-\ntem if multilateral institutions and core national governments\ncontinue to treat her like former British Prime Minister\nRobert Blair's \"scar on the conscience\" of the world (see\nAbrahamsen, 2005), rather than like a partner in healing its\nattrition. Perhaps, unintended by African governments,\ndecades of leadership in nonpurposive malfeasance have cre-\nated a culture of coercive youth violence on multiple terror\nfronts. African citizens have shown a unique quality of\npatience and tolerance at the height of a clear sequence of\nexploitation, starting from the European colonial period,\nthrough to today, where postcolonial exploitation has contin-\nued, this time with local umpires. With the unending journey\nto nationhood, there is a clear frustration on the part of youths\nin many African states. Facing increasingly deteriorating\npoverty levels, socioeconomic disorientation and the profli-\ngacy of government, youths, who no longer trust the impar-\ntiality and due process of organized governance to provide\nequal and fair opportunity to improve their lives, choose per-\nsonal socioeconomic liberation by any means possible. In so\ndoing, and at particular thresholds of national uncertainties,\nenduring ancient communal and imported systems of politi-\ncal aggression make those choices for them. The analogy of\nthe sociopolitical economy of postcolonial Nigeria does not\nexonerate the subterfuge of local partnerships and acquisi-\ntionists in these activities, but it does identify and explain it.\nThis is the pedagogical problem of a leadership class of\nurban elites raised under postcolonial control, on a premise\nof exploitation so beneficial and committing that it has\nbecome a distinct culture, averse to the accepted norms of\naccountability in governance, even as practiced in ordinary,\nlocal villages. This class, because of its autochthonous legiti-\nmacy and its inability to negotiate the foreseeable backlash\nof its subtle commission, appears more dangerous than the\ncolonialists. Clearly, the deviation to the criminality of the\nterrorist form in sub-Saharan Africa involves both the state\nand the dissident groups. The two groups are like business\nplayers with their eyes set on controlling the continent's\nremaining natural resources. The fear is that these pockets of\nterrorist activities may spread and become an accepted norm\nfor negotiating modern socioeconomic liberation. Unlike in\nthe Middle East, where there is broad public support and\nsympathy for such activities, low community patronage in\nsub-Saharan Africa relate to its ungrounded ideology.\nOrganizational theorists affirm that environments are prime\ndetermining factors for organizational cultures (Wilson,\n1968). The environments that created present governance\nand bureaucratic structures in most nations on the African\ncontinent were colonial in nature. Those structures persist,\nwhereas the environments from which they emerged have\nlong been extinct. This is a dilemma of governance in Africa,\nand one in which nations like Nigeria have demonstrated,\nrepeatedly, their inability to help themselves. Without a\nstructural reformation of governance, management, and\nadministrative practices, throwing money at the plethora of\nproblems inherent in the majority of the states in the subcon-\ntinent is an exercise in futility. Conflicts in sub-Saharan\nAfrica clearly reflect a response to poverty, social political\nmaladies, and a noticeable disequilibrium between govern-\nments and the environments in which they operate. Structural\nchanges are required in the articulation of the role of govern-\nment, as well as for citizens in finding lasting solutions to the\nproblem of terrorism in Africa. Improving social mobility\nshould be a public policy goal. Such a policy necessitates\ngiving greater attention to socioeconomic independence,\nmass education, including vocational tutoring, and the eradi-\ncation of social barriers, such as economic inequality, envi-\nronmental renewal, and gentrification. In summary, this\narticle maintains that the genesis of modern terrorism in\nAfrica is associated with governmental and corporate socio-\neconomic and environmental neglect, and with usurpation by\nlocal elite leadership who live, vaingloriously, beyond the\nmeans of their nation's economic capacities. The leadership\nconstraints of the elite that result into the vainglorious gover-\nnance of African nation's demands critical research by schol-\nars with interest in the political and economic leadership and\non the idealogical basis of the new terrorism on the continent.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAbadie, A.
