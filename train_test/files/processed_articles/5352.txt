    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn 1927, Walter Lippmann published The Phantom Public, denouncing the `mystical fallacy of democracy.' Decrying roman-\ntic democratic models that privilege self-governance, he writes: ``I have not happened to meet anybody, from a President\nof the United States to a professor of political science, who came anywhere near to embodying the accepted ideal of the\nsovereign and omnicompetent citizen.'' Almost 90 years later, Lippmann's pragmatism is as relevant as ever, and should be\napplied in new contexts where similar self-governance concerns persist. This paper does just that, repurposing\nLippmann's argument in the context of the ongoing debate over the role of the digital citizen in Big Data management.\nIt is argued that proposals by the Federal Trade Commission, the White House and the US Congress, championing failed\nnotice and choice privacy policy, perpetuate a self-governance fallacy comparable to Lippmann's, referred to here as the\nfallacy of data privacy self-management. Even if the digital citizen had the faculties and the system for data privacy self-\nmanagement, the digital citizen has little time for data governance. We desire the freedom to pursue the ends of digital\nproduction, without being inhibited by the means. We want privacy, and safety, but cannot complete all that is required\nfor its protection. If it is true that the fallacy of democracy is similar to the fallacy of data privacy self-management, then\nperhaps the pragmatic solution is representative data management: a combination of non/for-profit digital dossier man-\nagement via infomediaries that can ensure the protection of personal data, while freeing individuals from what Lippmann\nreferred to as an `unattainable ideal.'\n",

The digital\ncitizen knows they are somehow affected by what is\ngoing on. Internet evolution continually, terms of ser-\nvice statements regularly, and data privacy mentions\noccasionally, serve as reminders that they are being\nswept along by great drifts of circumstance.\nYet the Internet's data-driven affairs are in no con-\nvincing way the affairs of the digital citizen. Big Data's\noperations are for the most part invisible, managed at\ndistant centers, from behind the scenes, by unnamed\npowers. As a private person, the digital citizen does\nnot know for certain what is going on, or who is\ndoing it, or where they are being carried. No newspaper\nreports their environment so that they can grasp it; no\nschool has taught them how to imagine it; their ideals,\noften, do not fit with it. Digital citizens live in a world\nwhich they cannot see, do not understand and are\nunable to direct. In the cold light of experience the\ndigital citizen knows that data privacy self-management\nis a fiction.\nUniversity of Ontario Institute of Technology, Canada and Quello Center,\nMichigan State University, USA\nCorresponding author:\nJonathan A Obar, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Canada\nand Quello Center, Michigan State University, USA.\nEmail: jonathan.obar@uoit.ca\nBig Data & Society\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nbds.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons NonCommercial-NoDerivs CC-BY-NC-ND: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Com-\nmons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/) which permits\nnon-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work as published without adaptation or alteration, without further permission provided the\noriginal work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nHad The Phantom Public been written today, and\nWalter Lippmann been concerned with the nature of\nour digital existence, perhaps this is how his opening\nchapter would have read. In 1927, critiquing what he\nrefers to as ``the mystical fallacy of democracy'' (p. 28),\nLippmann decries academic and popular misconcep-\ntions suggesting that individuals can be self-governing\nin a democracy. With language now infamous for its\nfiery and at times offensive tone, Lippmann challenges\nperpetuations of democratic delusion; spoken sedatives\nthat, to this day, are strategically prescribed by polit-\nicians aiming to assuage publics that might otherwise\nfear political marginalization. Almost 90 years later, his\nwords and his pragmatism are as relevant as ever, and\nshould be applied in new contexts where similarly\nromantic and impractical calls for self-governance\nquiet those easily sedated, concurrently wasting time,\nmoney and energy in the pursuit of what Walter\nLippmann called an ``unattainable ideal'' (p. 29).\nThis paper does just that, repurposing Lippmann's\nargument in an attempt to contribute to the self-\ngovernance debate taking place over the role of the digi-\ntal citizen1 in their own Big Data management. It is\nargued here that recent calls for data privacy self-man-\nagement, or the ability for a single individual to control\nhow their personal data is collected, used and disclosed\n(Solove, 2012), reveals a self-governance fallacy compar-\nable to the fallacy described by Lippmann. What I term\nthe fallacy of data privacy self-management, or the mis-\nconception that digital citizens can be self-governing in a\ndigital universe defined by Big Data, is perpetuated by\ngovernments the world over, refusing to move beyond\nflawed notice and choice policy. While digital citizens\nsuffer reputation management woes (Citron, 2009),\nself-disclosure misappropriation (Noamgalai.com,\ntheft (Solove, 2002), eligibility threats from algorithms\nand data brokers (Pasquale, 2015), and a ``swarming\nlinked to the exponential growth of Big Data, govern-\nments champion futile `notice' efforts in the name of\nprivacy, engendering `the biggest lie on the internet,'2\nand data management practices (`choice' and `access'),\nthat limit individual data control more often than\nnot (e.g. Parsons, 2014). In an attempt to contribute to\nthe scholarship already highlighting the flaws in notice\nand choice privacy policy (e.g. Ben-Shahar and\nLippmann's self-governance concerns to further demon-\nstrate the futility of the current approach. In doing so,\nthe intention is to strengthen the community of critique\nby connecting the current Big Data self-governance\ndebate to the rich and longstanding literature addressing\nthe role of the individual in societal governance; a debate\nthat can be traced back at least to the ancient Greeks. By\nmaking these connections, hopefully ongoing and future\nprivacy efforts will learn and draw from the long history\nof self-governance concern, and do more to champion\npragmatic approaches to Big Data management that are\nbeneficial to digital citizens.\nThis paper begins with a review of Lippmann's `fal-\nlacy of democracy,' allowing for further conceptualiza-\ntion of the `fallacy of data privacy self-management.'\nWhat follows is a policy analysis of recent privacy efforts\nby the US government that perpetuate the data privacy\nself-management fallacy. The analysis begins with a look\nat data proliferation, linked to a sweeping digitization of\neveryday life, and a Big Data industry that is growing as\nquickly as its stockpiles. The myriad data sources and\ndata collectors will be emphasized in an attempt to high-\nlight the complexity and impossibility of data privacy\nself-management. Calls for data self-governance by the\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC), the White House,\nand the US Congress are presented next, with brief refer-\nences to Lippmann's critique interspersed. Recent\nresearch supporting the view that data privacy self-\nmanagement is a fallacy will be described. The discussion\nsection summarizes the critique and briefly introduces a\nmore pragmatic approach to the challenges identified,\nand one in need of further inquiry--representative data\nmanagement.\nLippmann's `Fallacy of democracy' and\nthe `Fallacy of data privacy self-\nmanagement'\nCritiquing what he views as the misconception that\nindividuals can be self-governing in a democracy,\nLippmann writes, ``I think it is a false ideal. I don't\nmean an undesirable ideal. I mean an unattainable\nideal [. . .] An ideal should express the true possibilities\nof its subject'' (p. 29). Lippmann explains that coming\nto terms with the fatal flaws3 common to models of\nparticipatory democracy reveals the fallacy. The flaws\nmost relevant to our current inquiry, among those that\nLippmann identifies as limiting the true possibilities of\nthe subject, are individualistic as well as structural.\nSpeaking to the limitations of the individual, he writes:\nI have not happened to meet anybody, from a President\nof the United States to a professor of political science,\nwho came anywhere near to embodying the accepted\nideal of the sovereign and omnicompetent citizen.\nBeyond the challenge of ubiquitous expertise in an\nincreasingly technocratic world, Lippmann argues that\nthe impossibility of omnicompetence, or expertise in all\nareas of government, is among the fatal flaws. He writes:\n2 Big Data & Society\nSo I have been reading some of the new standard text-\nbooks used to teach citizenship in schools and colleges.\nAfter reading them I do not see how any one can escape\nthe conclusion that man must have the appetite of an\nencyclopaedist and infinite time ahead of him. [. . .] He\nis told, in one textbook of five hundred concise, con-\ntentious pages [. . .] about city problems, state prob-\nlems, national problems, international problems, trust\nproblems, labor problems, transportation problems,\nbanking problems, rural problems, agricultural prob-\nLippmann includes himself among those that stand\nlittle chance in the face of an ever-increasing multitude\nof questions to be answered,\nMy sympathies are with him, for I believe that he has\nbeen saddled with an impossible task and that he is\nasked to practice an unattainable ideal. I find it so\nmyself for, although public business is my main interest\nand I give most of my time to watching it, I cannot find\ntime to do what is expected of me in the theory of\ndemocracy; that is, to know what is going on and to\nhave an opinion worth expressing on every question\nwhich confronts a self-governing community.\nA second flaw similarly revealed by the long list of\ntasks for which the self-governor would be responsible\nis the limitation of individual time. Lippmann argues\nthat having the required faculties at our disposal, not to\nmention the will to engage with all issues, would still be\nfutile, as the lack of time available to address and\nanswer all questions would leave society at a standstill.\nSpeaking again to the civics teachers, he writes:\n[N]owhere in this well-meant book is the sovereign citi-\nzen of the future given a hint as to how, while he is\nearning a living, rearing children and enjoying his life,\nhe is to keep himself informed about the progress of this\nA third fatal flaw Lippmann associates with\nmodels of participatory democracy speaks to the lack\nof a pragmatic structure or system that would make\nself-governance possible. Indeed, how big an Ecclesia\nis needed to house 300 million self-governors?4 What\ntype of interface would allow for such a crowd to raise\nall issues, debate and resolve them? For Lippmann, this\nstructural concern is a by-product of the lack of omni-\ncompetence and time necessary to answer all questions.\nFurthermore, there simply isn't a system or interface\nthat would allow all self-governors to answer all ques-\ntions quickly enough to affect all things all the time,\nespecially as they evolve each day. He writes:\nIt never occurs to this preceptor of civic duty to provide\nthe student with a rule by which he can know whether\non Thursday it is his duty to consider subways in\nBrooklyn or the Manchurian Railway, nor how, if he\ndetermines on Thursday to express his sovereign will on\nthe subway question, he is to repair those gaps in his\nknowledge of that question which are due to his having\nbeen preoccupied the day before in expressing his sov-\nereign will about rural credits in Montana and the\nrights of Britain in the Sudan. Yet he cannot know\nall about everything all the time, and while he is watch-\ning one thing a thousand others undergo great changes.\nMuch has been written about Lippmann's critique of\nromantic preoccupations with self-governance. Relevant\nto the current discussion is Lippmann's supposed deni-\ngration of individual autonomy and efficacy, contribut-\ning to allegations that his position was anti-democratic\n(Schudson, 2008). For example, James Carey has linked\nLippmann's work to a problematic shift in approaches\nto journalism as well as democratic theory that view the\npublic as incompetent and incapable of participation in\nthe governance process (e.g. Carey, 1987). John Dewey's\nwritings, most notably The Public and its Problems\n(1927), championing a more inclusive participatory\nmodel, have often been placed in opposition to\nLippmann's. Whether or not there ever was a\n``Lippmann\u00adDewey debate,'' as some have claimed and\nothers disputed (Schudson, 2008), both Lippmann and\nDewey framed their arguments in opposition to what\nthey viewed as a struggling American democracy, pre-\nscribing different, but potential solutions for the\nAmerican political system (Whipple, 2005). What mat-\nters for our current purpose is to say that the differences\nin their assertions, and Dewey's close proximity to the\nromantic ideal, do not invalidate Lippmann's argument.\nDewey himself understood this, as noted in his review of\nThe Phantom Public:\nWhile one might cite passages which, if divorced\nfrom their context, would give the impression that\nMr. Lippmann was permanently ``off'' democracy,\nMr. Lippmann's essay is in reality a statement of\nfaith in a pruned and temperate democratic theory,\nand a presentation of methods by which a reasonable\nconception of democracy can be made to work, not\nabsolutely, but at least better than democracy works\nunder an exaggerated and undisciplined notion of the\nDewey appears to appreciate the move beyond an\nexaggerated false ideal--or as Lippmann states, ``I do\nnot mean an undesireable ideal. I mean an unattainable\nto identify the unattainable and pursue the pragmatic.\nHis argument is anti-democratic only to the extent that\nit upsets those wedded to the warmth of a mystical demo-\ncratic delusion. Considering the fatal flaws identified by\nLippmann, it could be suggested that his pragmatism\ndoes more to champion citizen empowerment than\nDewey's call for direct participation, through\nLippmann's critique of governance models that do little\nto engender practical self-governance outcomes. As\nLippmann writes:\nAn ideal should express the true possibilities of its subject\n(emphasis added). When it does not it perverts the true\npossibilities. The ideal of the omnicompetent, sovereign\ncitizen is, in my opinion, such a false ideal. It is\nunattainable. The pursuit of it is misleading. The failure\nto achieve it has produced the current disenchantment.\nRepurposing Lippmann and extending the self-\ngovernance debate to the Big Data context, it is\nargued here that each of the self-governance flaws iden-\ntified (lack of omnicompetence, time and structure) are\nsimilarly revealed by the fallacy of data privacy self-\nmanagement. Discussed in greater detail in the policy\nanalysis that follows, calls for data privacy self-\nmanagement, or the ability for a single individual to\ncontrol how their personal data is collected, used\nand disclosed (Solove, 2012), highlight comparable\nself-governance challenges to those identified by\nLippmann, and a correspondingly similar demand for\npragmatic alternatives. As will be discussed in the next\nsection, the multitude of tasks that the individual user\nmust address in the Big Data context presents a com-\nparable omnicompetence challenge. Beyond traditional\nand expanding digital divide concerns (e.g. Hargittai\nPrieger, 2013), it is unrealistic to expect ubiquitous\nomnicompetence in the form of understanding and con-\ntinuous management of data being collected, organized,\nanalyzed, as well as repurposed and sold by every\napplication, commercial organization, non-commercial\norganization, government agency, data broker and\nthird-party, while also expecting users to read and under-\nstand every terms of service (TOS) agreement and privacy\npolicy. New research also suggests that data drawn\nfrom the physical layer of the Internet is relevant to the\ndigital citizen (Clement and Obar, 2015b; Obar and\nClement, 2012), adding knowledge of Internet infrastruc-\nture, management and operations to the list of tasks\nrequiring oversight.\nThough more research in the area is needed,\nMcDonald and Cranor (2008) revealed a number of\nyears ago, before the explosion of social media, touch-\nscreen phones and tablets, that it would take users an\naverage of 40 minutes a day to read all the privacy poli-\ncies they encounter. This alone suggests a time manage-\nment concern associated with self-governance in the Big\nData universe. Imagine how much additional time\nwould be needed to manage all the tasks continually\nintroduced by Big Data. After engaging with this\n``swarming confusion of problems'' (Lippmann, 1927:\n14), would digital citizens have time to actually use the\nInternet? To work? To have a family? To do anything\nelse?\nThe lack of a structure or system for enabling digital\ncitizens to manage their Big Data is also highly problem-\natic. Beyond attempts to improve the informed consent\nprocess for privacy and TOS policies (e.g. Microsoft,\n2015), perhaps the first of many, many steps towards\ndata privacy self-management, it is clear that the speed\nof analysis as well as change within the Big Data indus-\ntry maintains an instability that limits the creation of\nuser-friendly organizing structures. The four V's\n(volume, velocity, variety and veracity) are consistently\nused to draw a ring around the Big Data concept (see\nIBM, 2015a). Some have suggested that it is velocity, the\nspeed at which data is being collected, analyzed and\nutilized, that is currently the key to Big Data's appeal.\nBurn-Murdoch (2013) notes ``it is speed, not size, that\ndefines big data in 2013,'' and ``it is speed, not size, that\nis increasingly driving desire for software and hardware\nimprovements at data-processing organisations.'' The\nreason velocity is so important is the desire for real-\ntime and predictive results. IBM in particular is clear\nabout its emphasis on speed, and how its products will\nhelp customers achieve their velocity-oriented needs:\n``the most advanced analytics software in the world\ndoesn't do you any good if (it) takes forever to get\ninsights. You need to have the right infrastructure in\nplace to be able to get the most from big data and ana-\nlytics in realtime'' (IBM, 2015b). They add: ``those that\nare able to acquire, analyze and act on data faster than\ntheir competitors will be the ones actually able to benefit\nthe most from those efforts'' (Reese, 2014). Speaking\nabout one of their Big Data products, IBM Spark, the\njustification for speed is clear,\nAs the speed of business keeps accelerating, the value of\nknowing what happened pales in comparison to the\nvalue of knowing what is happening right now.\nImagine the power of knowing how your ad campaign\nis performing this very minute. Imagine the benefit of\nknowing where sales are spiking or tanking every day;\nwhere inventory is low or high as sales are made; and\nwhich patients are responding to care and which are\nIn addition to the velocity issue, the speed of change\nin the Big Data industry is also a concern. In August of\n4 Big Data & Society\n2012, Facebook's Vice President of Engineering, Jay\nParikh, provided a glimpse into the industry's attitude\ntowards Big Data's constant evolution, stating, ``[in a\nfew months] no one will care you have 100 petabytes of\ndata in your warehouse [. . .] the world is getting hun-\ngrier and hungrier for data'' (Constine, 2012: 4). Where\ndoes the average user fit in this whirlwind of speed and\nchange? Speaking to his own concerns about the speed\nof change in the context of societal governance,\nLippmann wrote:\n[. . .] (the individual) cannot know all about everything\nall the time, and while he is watching one thing a thou-\nsand others undergo great changes. Unless he can dis-\ncover some rational ground for fixing his attention\nwhere it will do the most good, and in a way that\nsuits his inherently amateurish equipment, he will be\nas bewildered as a puppy trying to lick three bones at\nThe fatal self-governance flaws of omnicompetence,\ntime and structure saddle both the expert and the novice\nuser with an impossible task in a digital universe defined\nby Big Data. Indeed, the challenge of citizen empower-\nment embodied by the fallacy of data privacy\nself-management should be understood as an extension\nof the self-governance challenges identified by\nLippmann's fallacy of democracy. Nevertheless, recent\nefforts by the US government continue to pursue flawed\nnotice and choice policies (discussed further on) that\ncling to romantic self-governance ideals and perpetuate\nthe fallacy. A plan for data privacy self-management\nshould express the true possibilities of its subject.\nAchieving pragmatic ends to empower digital citizens\nwill not be easy, and will first require movement\nbeyond romantic notions that remain as impossible as\ndirect democracy within a nation of millions.\nThe Big Data boom\nA description of the individual's relationship to the Big\nData boom should be prefaced with the following: gen-\neral details about Big Data, and the number of poten-\ntial entities involved, do not address the extent to which\nindividuals are implicated in the practice of data collec-\ntion, management, retention, sharing, etc. which\nremains, for the most part, a mystery. The enigmatic\nnature of Big Data is due to a number of factors. First,\nin 2011, the McKinsey Institute reported that every\nsector in the global economy is now addressing the\nrole of Big Data (Manyika et al., 2011). Thus The\nEconomist's (2010) comment ``Data, Data,\nEverywhere'' should be interpreted to mean not only\nthat data is being collected everywhere, but also that a\nmultitude of organizations are engaging with the\ngrowing Big Data industry, each presenting their own\nmosaic of Big Data questions. This suggests that within\nand across all sectors of the global economy, data is\nbeing collected, organized and retained in unique ways,\ncontributing to a relative inability to standardize\ndescriptions of Big Data practices for the purpose of\nuser understanding.\nSecond, the lack of transparency on the part of\norganizations engaged with the Big Data industry fur-\nther contributes to an inability to understand the extent\nto which the individual is implicated. Recent empirical\nassessments of Internet service providers (ISPs),\nInternet carriers, and other online intermediaries sug-\ngest that organizations are closed-lipped about the spe-\ncifics of data collection, retention and management\n2015a). The growing trend in transparency reporting\n(e.g. recent transparency reports from Microsoft,\nTwitter and Comcast) provides insight into the practice\nof data disclosure requests from security agencies and\nthe extent of compliance. Unfortunately, few details\nrelevant to individual accounts are made available,\nagain, making it difficult for digital citizens to assess\ntheir own connection to data disclosures. The flawed\nnotice and choice policies that many of these companies\ndo mention in their TOS and privacy policies provide\nusers with the opportunity to request access to personal\ndata. Beyond the impracticality of this option for\ncommon use by the general public (e.g. Ben-Shahar\ngest that when individuals do make the effort, they are\nmet with a variety of obstacles (e.g. Parsons, 2014).\nConcerns with transparency also apply to the\ngrowing industry of data brokers, commercial entities\nthat collect information about individuals and then\norganize and package that information to sell to\nanother party (Pasquale, 2015). A recent report by\nthe FTC noted:\nData brokers acquire a vast array of detailed and spe-\ncific information about consumers; analyze it to make\ninferences about consumers, some of which may be\nconsidered sensitive; and share the information with\nclients in a range of industries. All of this activity\ntakes place behind the scenes, without consumers'\nWhile companies like Facebook and Google are in\nthe business of interacting with the public, data brokers\nare not, as they communicate directly with organiza-\ntions interested in purchasing data. Beyond the chal-\nlenge of dealing with digital dossiers at organizations\nwe knowingly interact with, users are also faced with\nthe difficulty of identifying dossiers managed by hidden\ndata brokers.\nThe purpose of this preface was to emphasize how\ndifficult it is for the digital citizen to develop both a\ndetailed understanding of the complexities of Big\nData, as well as a clear picture of their own digital\nfootprint, before attempting to overcome the challenges\nof omnicompetence, time and structure.\nBig Data by the numbers\nThough Web 2.0, the mobile industry and the `Internet\nof Things' have amplified the amount of information\nbeing collected, data collection practices have existed\nfor quite some time. Census data and other government\nrecords, police records, health records, credit reports,\ncredit card data and other information collected by\nfinancial institutions highlight just a few of the trad-\nitional sources of data. Newer sources also exist.\nSchneier (2015) describes how all of our interactions\nwith computers produce data of some kind. The prolif-\neration of computers in the home, in public, at work\nand even on the person highlights the omnipresence\nof data collection devices. The Internet in general,\nand social media in particular, are major sources of\ndata. Clickstream collection and other forms of web\ntracking, practices that have been common since the\n1990s, are just the beginning of the data deluge. All\nuser-generated content, the lifeblood of the social\nmedia organism (Obar and Wildman, 2015), including\ntext, links, photos, audio and video, `likes,' social net-\nwork lists, game results, selections, de-selections, and\nan evolving number of other behavioral manifestations\nonline are all being collected. The myriad possibilities\nfrom mobile phone data are also being realized. As\nSchneier (2015) describes, mobile phones not only\ntrack where you live, work, spend evenings and week-\nends, they also can assess your relationship to other\nmobiles in the area, suggesting the capability for deter-\nmining whom you are interacting with in person as well\nas online.\nBeyond the global positioning (GPS) capabilities of\nyour phone, many mobile phones are also smart-\nphones--a device that performs many functions com-\nmonly associated with computers. All of the\napplications that individuals use when engaging with a\nsmartphone produce data. Wearable media devices, still\nin their infancy, like the Apple iWatch and the Fitbit\nalso introduce new possibilities for constant tracking.\nSchneier (2015) describes a few more of the many com-\nputers we encounter daily including the machines used in\nstores to identify loyalty cards and process credit/debit\npurchases, computers in cars generating data about loca-\ntion, driving quality and quantity, as well as video sur-\nveillance devices monitoring indoor and outdoor spaces.\nIn 2011, a McKinsey Institute report presented an\nearly description of what is now referred to as the\n`Internet of Things,' highlighting the proliferation of\ntracking technologies,\nMore than 30 million networked sensor nodes are now\npresent in the transportation, automotive, industrial,\nutilities, and retail sectors. The number of these sensors\nis increasing at a rate of more than 30 percent a year.\nCoupled with these tracking technologies are also\nfacial and gait recognition applications that help ana-\nlyze and infer from data (e.g. Acquisti et al., 2014;\nSchneier, 2015). Emphasis on data analysis technolo-\ngies such as predictive analytics suggests that our atten-\ntion should focus not only on data collection, but data\naggregation, management, retention, disclosure, etc.\nThis further elucidates that digital citizens are tasked\nwith understanding not only a multitude of diverse\nchallenges associated with data collection, but also a\nvariety of aggregation and analytical possibilities.\nThe term being used to describe the constantly and\nexponentially evolving universe of information being\ncollected is `Big Data.' The `iceberg' cliche\n\u00b4 applies to\nthe term, as users are only periodically given glimpses\ninto Big Data collection and management practices,\ntypically hidden from public view.\nlished an article in Wired about a new multi-billion\ndollar National Security Agency (NSA) ``spy center''\nbeing built in the Utah desert capable of handling yot-\ntabytes of data. A yottabyte is one septillion (1024)\nbytes; the progression moves from gigabyte (109) to\nthat the entire global Internet contained 500 exabytes of\ndata (Wray, 2009), further emphasizing Big Data's rate\nof growth. In August of 2012, Facebook's Vice\nPresident of Engineering, Jay Parikh, reported that\nFacebook was accepting 2.5 billion pieces of content\nbytes of data each day (Constine, 2012). Facebook's\nBig Data represents the collection practices of just\none site. Countless other sites visited by users every\nday including Google, Twitter, Yahoo, Amazon,\nMSN, CNN.com are all amassing stockpiles of their\nown. Furthermore, Internet companies are hardly the\nonly entities interested in Big Data. As noted, Manyika\net al. (2011) reported that every sector in the global\neconomy is now addressing Big Data questions.\nA discussion of the Big Data industry must include a\nmention of data brokers. Data brokers, also referred to\nas data aggregators, information brokers or data ven-\ndors, collect information about individuals, then organ-\nize and package that information for the purpose of\nselling data to another party. Their methods of data\n6 Big Data & Society\ncollection are varied and controversial. Methods range\nfrom scraping public data like names, contact informa-\ntion and other user-generated content from publicly\naccessible locations, especially on the Internet, to the\nacquisition of purchasing histories, credit\ncard activities, registrations with commercial and\nnon-commercial organizations, charitable and religious\naffiliations, as well as bulk-data purchases of massive\ndatabases from government (and likely) private entities\nIn summary, IBM estimates that by 2020, a total of\ncompanies operating in the US have at least 100 tera-\nbytes of data stored, a number that is also increasing,\nwork connections across the world, 2.5 connections per\nWith such a wide variety of entities involved in the\ncollection, management and trade of Big Data, data\nprivacy self-management proposals must go beyond\nbroad and ambiguous notice and choice possibilities.\nProposals without pragmatics for addressing our lack\nof omnicompetence, time and structure are at best a\nfirst step, and at worst, futile.\nCalls for data privacy self-management\nIn 1973, responding to the growth of digital data col-\nlection, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\nreleased a set of Fair Information Practice Principles\n(FIPP), intended to guide industry practice as well as\nthe development of law and policy. In the years that\nfollowed, a variety of privacy laws in the United States\nand around the world (in Canada and in Europe in\nparticular) were developed in accordance with the\nFIPPs.5 The principles include: 1) transparency of\ndata record systems, 2) the right to notice about data\nrecord systems, 3) the right to prevent data from being\nused without consent, 4) the right to correct or amend\npersonal data, and 5) that data holders are responsible\nfor the safekeeping of data and to ensure that data isn't\nmisused (c.f. Solove, 2012). The FIPPs are now com-\nmonly referred to as notice, choice, access, security and\nenforcement (McDonald and Cranor, 2008). As has\nbeen previously discussed, the first three FIPPs (often\ncharacterized as `notice and choice' policy) are proving\nto be problematic in the context of Big Data. The notice\nprinciple raises concerns due to the difficulties asso-\nciated with achieving informed consent through privacy\nand TOS policies (McDonald and Cranor, 2008). The\nchoice and access principles are concerning because of\nthe self-governance challenges identified (i.e. lack of\nomnicompetence, time and structure). Nevertheless,\nthese romantic, impractical principles continue to\nserve as a foundation for ongoing privacy efforts\naround the world.\nIn what follows, four recent policy efforts that draw\nfrom the FTC's FIPPs are discussed: the 2012 FTC\nData Privacy Report, the White House's Consumer\nPrivacy Bill of Rights, and two proposals from the\nUS Congress. The self-governance concerns highlighted\nin each example will be identified and critiqued through\nreferences to Lippmann and recent privacy research.\nIn March of 2012, the FTC released Protecting\nConsumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change:\nRecommendations for Businesses and Policymakers\n(FTC, 2012). The report was the result of a review pro-\ncess initiated in 2010 after the release of a preliminary\nreport that proposed a framework for protecting con-\nsumer privacy in the 21st century.6 The eventual frame-\nwork released in the 2012 report articulates best\npractices for entities involved in data management,\nand is intended to direct future law and policy efforts\nThe report has three areas of focus: 1) privacy by\ndesign, 2) simplified choice for businesses and con-\nsumers, and 3) greater transparency. The `greater trans-\nparency' section is the focus of the current analysis. In\nthis section, the FTC describes three strategies:\n1) Privacy Notices: ``Privacy notices should be clearer,\nshorter, and more standardized to enable better com-\nprehension and comparison of privacy practices.''\n2) Access to Data: ``Companies should provide reason-\nable access to the consumer data they maintain; the\nextent of access should be proportionate to the sen-\nsitivity of the data and the nature of its use.''\n3) Consumer Education: ``All stakeholders should\nexpand their efforts to educate consumers about\ncommercial data privacy practices.'' (FTC, 2012:\nviii)\nThe privacy notice strategy clearly draws from the\nnotice principle, while the data access and consumer\neducation strategies extend from choice and access.\nPrivacy notices\nThough the report acknowledges that privacy policies\ntend to be too long, complicated, and generally ineffect-\nive at informing consumers about data practices, the\nFTC maintains a strong belief in their value.\nAccording to the FTC, privacy notices simply need to\nbe shorter, more concise, and easier to understand.\nAt the same time, the FTC notes that calls for standar-\ndized policies are only appropriate for certain notice\ncomponents, stating, ``privacy statements should\naccount for variations in business models across different\nindustry sectors, and prescribing a rigid format for use\nTherefore, the FTC's plan requires that users read and\nunderstand a variety of privacy notices and policies\nequal to the multitude of entities collecting their data.\nWhat might Walter Lippmann say about this?\nReferring to the fallacy of democracy, Lippmann\nwrites:\nThe individual man does not have opinions on all\npublic affairs. He does not know how to direct public\naffairs. He does not know what is happening, why it is\nhappening, what ought to happen. I cannot imagine\nhow he could know, and there is not the least reason\nfor thinking, as mystical democrats have thought, that\nthe compounding of individual ignorances in masses of\npeople can produce a continuous directing force in\nIn the context of data privacy self-management,\nLippmann's argument (i.e. lack of omnicompetence,\ntime and structure) suggests that it is unrealistic to\nexpect that every user, of every age and skill-set,\nwould be able to engage with the evolving TOS and\nprivacy policies of a multitude of data-driven entities.\nThe challenges users face can be further broken down\ninto the following areas: 1) TOS and privacy policies\nare too long and 2) TOS and privacy policies are diffi-\ncult to understand.\nTOS and privacy policies are too long\nA seminal study by McDonald and Cranor (2008)\nassessed privacy policies from the 75 most popular web-\nsites on the Internet in 2005. At the time, the policy\nlengths McDonald and Cranor found ranged from\nwords. When they asked participants to skim a selection\nof policies, they found that median time to skim one\npolicy ranged from 18 to 26 minutes. They estimated\nthat, at the time, Americans would likely have had to\nspend 201 hours per year if they read all of the privacy\npolicies they came into contact with (an average of 40\nminutes a day). Though the average length in 2005 was\nwebsite Which?, the lengths of the terms and conditions\nfor some of the Internet's most popular sites were as\n(Parris, 2012). This suggests that TOS and privacy poli-\ncies have grown in length since 2005, though the current\naverage remains unclear. It should be added that calls\nfor data privacy transparency have contributed to\nthe release of more detailed TOS and privacy policies\n(to include retention periods, disclosure and sharing\npolicies), as well as transparency reports and law\nenforcement handbooks (see: Cardozo et al., 2014;\ncalls for greater transparency will increase the amount\nof reading required, making informed consent more of\nan impossibility. Indeed, it would be ideal if every user\nhad the ability, time and interface to achieve informed\nconsent in every context, but this seeming impossibility\nemphasizes how the notice principle aught to be recon-\nsidered in favor of more pragmatic models that produce\nresults.\nTOS and privacy policies are difficult to\nunderstand\nIf users found the time to read TOS and privacy policies,\nthey would still encounter what Solove refers to as the\n``privacy self-management consent dilemma'' (2012:\n1883) because policies are difficult to understand\n(Reidenberg et al., 2014). As Paul Ohm, former legal\nadvisor to the FTC, once wrote: ``Nobody reads privacy\npolicies, and even if people did, they would not be likely\nto understand them, because they are often very long\nhall meeting in 2007, then FTC Commissioner Jon\nLeibowitz described a similar concern:\nInitially, privacy policies seemed like a good idea. But\nin practice, they often leave a lot to be desired. In many\ncases, consumers don't notice, read, or understand the\nprivacy policies. They are often posted inconspicuously\nvia a link at the very bottom of the site's homepage--\nand filled with fine-print legalese and technotalk.\nA recent study by Reidenberg et al. (2014) demon-\nstrates how difficult it is to achieve common understand-\ning--and thus, a consistent informed consent--of\nprivacy policies. The study asks users of varying levels\nof privacy expertise to evaluate data sharing, retention\nand deletion policies, and assesses agreement within and\nacross groups. The findings suggest that within groups of\nindividuals with similar levels of privacy expertise there\nis considerable disagreement about what policies say.\nThe across group assessment reveals that expert users\nhave an easier time understanding policies than users\nin other groups. The authors emphasize that perhaps\nthese findings add to the literature pointing to the failure\n8 Big Data & Society\nof the notice and choice framework in general\n(Reidenberg et al., 2014). Furthermore, the results vali-\ndate what is referred to as `the biggest lie on the\nInternet'--namely, `I have read and agree to the terms'\nmay be an important first-step, but they still leave users\nfar from achieving data privacy self-management.\nAccess to data\nThe FTC organizes its discussion of data access into\nthree sections: a) data for marketing, b) data for eligibil-\nity decisions, and c) data for other purposes. In its first\nsection on data for marketing, the FTC notes that calls\nfor complete access and correction rights are unrealistic,\nmainly because of the prohibitive financial costs for\norganizations intending to use the data. Instead, the\nFTC suggests that these organizations provide ``a list\nof the categories of consumer data they hold, and the\nability to suppress the use of such data for marketing''\napproach, the FTC also recommends that entities\nprovide more individualized access or `granular choices'\nfor opt-in or opt-out when necessary. Here the FTC\nagain begins with an attempt at standardization and sim-\nplicity, and then completes its recommendation with\nguidelines that would ensure variation across entities,\nperpetuating self-governance challenges linked to the\nBig Data deluge.\nThe second data access category refers to entities\nthat collect data for use by ``creditors, employers, insur-\nance companies, landlords, and other entities involved\ninstances, the FTC notes that the Fair Credit\nReporting Act (FCRA) applies \u00ad specifically, the provi-\nsions that provide consumers with the ability to access\nand correct all information contained in consumer\nreports. The FTC recognizes the demands resulting\nfrom these guidelines grow increasingly complex, ``as\nmore and more consumer data becomes avail-\nable . . . (including data collected from social media\nsites) companies are increasingly finding new opportu-\nnities to compile, package, and sell that information''\n(FTC, 2012). For example, the FTC had, at the time,\nissued warning letters to an organization that collected\npublic records and then developed apps that allowed\nusers to learn information about friends, co-workers,\nneighbors, or potential suitors. The report states that\nthe applicability of FCRA was unclear in this situation\nas the specific use of the apps had not been determined.\nIn this instance, the FTC's proposal, again, presents\nusers with a Herculean data access responsibility with-\nout explaining how to pragmatically and effectively\nmaintain data privacy self-management.\nThe third section of the report refers to entities using\ndata for purposes other than marketing or eligibility.\nThe FTC notes:\nThese businesses may encompass a diverse range of\nindustry sectors. They may include businesses selling\nfraud prevention or risk management services, in order\nto verify the identities of customers. They may also\ninclude general search engines, media publications, or\nsocial networking sites. They may include debt collectors\ntrying to collect a debt. They may also include compa-\nnies collecting data about how likely a consumer is to\ntake his or her medication, for use by health care pro-\nIn each of these instances, the FTC recommends a\nsliding scale approach related to the sensitivity of the\ndata. When data is more sensitive, and the possibility of\ndamages to the individual is greater, individualized\nnotice, access, and correction rights should be granted.\nThe FTC adds that as a minimum requirement, com-\npanies should provide consumers with basic informa-\ntion about the type of data being collected as well as the\ndata sources.\nThe FTC also recommends that data brokers do\nmore to increase public awareness of their industry in\ngeneral and of their data collection and management\npractices in particular. To increase transparency, data\nbrokers must reach out to those they have collected\ndata from (a population of individuals that they gener-\nally do not communicate with) and provide access to\ntheir stockpiles of data. One strategy the FTC mentions\nis the creation and maintenance of a website where data\nbrokers identify themselves and explain how they col-\nlect, organize, re-package, and sell data. The website\nshould also identify the company types that purchase\ndata from brokers, explain access rights and other\nchoices offered to consumers, ``and could offer links\nto their own sites where consumers could exercise\nWhat might Walter Lippmann say about this?\nThere is [. . .] nothing particularly new in the disen-\nchantment which the private citizen expresses by not\nvoting at all, by voting only for the head of the\nticket, by staying away from the primaries, by not read-\ning speeches and documents, by the whole list of sins of\nomission for which he is denounced. I shall not\ndenounce him further. My sympathies are with him,\nfor I believe that he has been saddled with an impos-\nsible task and that he is asked to practice an unattain-\nable ideal. I find it so myself, for, although public\nbusiness is my main interest and I give most of my time\nto watching it, I cannot find time to do what is expected\nof me in the theory of democracy; that is, to know what\nis going on and to have an opinion worth expressing on\nevery question which confronts a self-governing com-\nIn each of the data access scenarios, the FTC offers\nsuggestions that, if followed, will increase the transpar-\nency of Big Data. Though it does not create an exhaust-\nive list of all organizations involved, or every potential\nBig Data practice, the FTC does begin to identify the\nbreadth and depth of the industry. That being said, if\nLippmann's omnicompetence, time and structure con-\ncerns are applied, the FTC's recommendations for an\nacross-the-Big-Data-board increase in communication\nwith consumers, access to data stockpiles, and oppor-\ntunity for data control, create an impossible scenario\nfor achieving data privacy self-management.\nSolove (2012) describes a variety of structural prob-\nlems that access models like the one proposed by the\nFTC appear to ignore. Similar to concerns articulated\nby Lippmann, Solove identifies a `problem of scale.'\nThere are too many entities, too many quickly\nmoving parts, too many stockpiles and too many data\npoints to expect a consistent, exhaustive and ubiquitous\ndata privacy self-management. The suggestion that\nusers could manage the data collected by one entity\nlike Facebook seems challenging enough--one need\nonly examine the case of Max Schrems in Germany\nand the 1200 pages of personal data that he received\n(O'Brien, 2012)--once the number of data managers is\nmultiplied, the impossibility is amplified. Ben-Shahar\nand Schneider (2011) describe an ``overload effect'' spe-\ncific to the management of complex legal obligations\nthat makes it difficult for individuals to remember, let\nalone manage complex legal situations. They write:\nLawmakers have no good solution to this problem.\nThere is rarely a good solution in principle: incomplete\ndisclosure leaves people ignorant, but complete disclos-\nure creates crushing overload problems. (Ben-Shahar\nThe FTC's plan, epitomizing romantic and imprac-\ntical calls for self-governance, proposes that thousands\nof organizations, large and small, operating in different\nmarkets, for different purposes, with different levels of\nexpertise and specialization, using different interfaces,\neach communicate with consumers, offering them\naccess to an equally diverse set of data stockpiles, priv-\nacy, and TOS policies. Furthermore, the FTC's plan\ncurrently operates within a national context; Big\nData's increasingly global context would greatly\nexpand the complexity of the tasks at hand. The\nFTC's plan creates potentially millions of pages for\nconsumers to read through, an infinite number of\ndata points to check, understand, critique, and manage.\nConsumer education\nIf that wasn't enough, the FTC also recommends that\norganizations involved in data collection, trade or\nusage, engage in public education campaigns about\nthe Big Data industry. Organizations are encouraged\nto develop and share articles, blog posts, videos,\ngames, etc. that can inform the public about the wide\nvariety of Big Data practices and technologies, as well\nas user rights relative to data management.\nWhat might Walter Lippmann say about this?\nThe usual appeal to education can bring only disap-\npointment. For the problems of the modern world\nappear and change faster than any set of teachers can\ngrasp them, much faster than they can convey their\nsubstance to a population of children. If the schools\nattempt to teach children how to solve the problems\nof the day, they are bound always to be in arrears.\nThe piling on of impossible tasks in the FTCs pro-\nposal is an ideal context for the application of The\nPhantom Public. Walter Lippmann refers to the ``fal-\nto suggest that romantic appeals to self-governance\nconvey fantastic possibilities that, while pleasant to\nthe ear, are impossible to achieve in reality. Despite\nthe long history of self-governance critique, and a\ngrowing literature calling out flawed notice and choice\nprivacy policy, the FTC, and others to be discussed,\ncontinue to perpetuate the fallacy of data privacy self-\nmanagement.\nWhite House Consumer Privacy Bill\nof Rights\nIn February of 2012 the White House released Consumer\nData Privacy in a Networked World: A Framework\nfor Protecting Privacy and Promoting Innovation in the\nGlobal Digital Economy (White House, 2012). In a letter\nfrom President Obama at the beginning of the report, he\nnotes that this proposal is to serve as a blueprint for self-\nregulation within the Big Data industry, as well as for\ncongressional efforts to fill gaps in existing federal law.\nAt the center of the report is a proposed Consumer\nPrivacy Bill of Rights. Of the seven rights,7 three\n(first, second and fifth) relate directly to data privacy\nself-management, drawing from the Fair Information\n10 Big Data & Society\nPractice Principles the FTC developed in the 1970s. The\nfirst right presented is: ``Individual Control, con-\nsumers have a right to exercise control over what per-\nsonal data companies collect from them and how they\nthat at the time of collection, entities collecting data must\nprovide users with choices about data collection, use,\ndisclosure, and sharing that are relevant to the scale,\nscope and sensitivity of the personal data in question.\nFor example, companies that have access to significant\nportions of individuals' Internet usage histories, such\nas search engines, ad networks, and online social\nnetworks, can build detailed profiles of individual\nbehavior over time. These profiles may be broad in\nscope and large in scale, and they may contain sensitive\ninformation, such as personal health or financial data.\nIn these cases, choice mechanisms that are simple\nand prominent and offer fine-grained control of per-\nsonal data use and disclosure may be appropriate.\nThe right to individual control also guarantees that\nusers should have access to innovative technologies that\ncan help ensure user control over data. Companies\ninvolved in online data collection should ensure that\ntheir products have detailed privacy settings that users\ncan modify as appropriate to control what data is col-\nlected and when. Going a step further, the report notes\nthat applications that enable `Do Not Track' function-\nalities should be built into these products to further\nstrengthen user control by offering the opportunity to\nopt-out of data collection and use, especially by third\nparties.\nThe right of individual control also extends to data\ncollected and used by data brokers. The White House\nacknowledges that this poses considerable challenges\nbecause data brokers are removed from direct inter-\nactions with the general public, and because many indi-\nviduals are unaware of the data aggregation industry.\nSimilar to the FTC report, the White House proposal\nencourages data brokers to develop mechanisms for\nincreasing consumer access and control over personal\ndata, and also recommends that data brokers engage in\npublic awareness initiatives.\nThe second right is: ``Transparency, consumers have\na right to easily understandable and accessible informa-\ntion about privacy and security practices'' (White\nlanguage statements about data collection, use, disclos-\nure and retention practices should be well-integrated\ninto all technologies that produce data. Not only\nshould there be a blanket statement associated with\neach technology, but organizations should communi-\ncate with citizens about data privacy concerns ``when\nthey are most relevant (p. 14).'' This suggests that users\nshould be given access to data privacy information or\nconsent materials at multiple points during an inter-\naction as new actions lead to new data. These respon-\nsibilities also apply to data brokers.\nThe fifth right is: ``Access and Accuracy, consumers\nhave a right to access and correct personal data in\nusable formats, in a manner that is appropriate to the\nsensitivity of the data and the risk of adverse conse-\nquences to consumers if the data is inaccurate''\nlated by the FTC, this right emphasizes that access\nto data being used for eligibility decisions should be\nguaranteed. To ensure protections, entities should not\nonly provide user access to data, but the ability to cor-\nrect, delete, or suppress data where appropriate. It\nshould be noted that the White House recently released\na draft of the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights Act of\nguage discussed included in the proposal.\nData privacy self-management\nand recent congressional efforts\nIn the United States, a variety of recent legislative\nefforts have included similar provisions that also per-\npetuate the fallacy of data privacy self-management.\nOne example was the Do Not Track Kids Act of 2013\n(Markey et al., 2013--not enacted). Among the com-\nponents of the bill was an `openness' principle which\nincluded a variety of notice, choice and access provi-\nsions, but geared towards minors. The bill stated that\nthose operating websites targeted to minors or involved\nin data collection of minors must:\nprovide each minor using the website, online service,\nonline application, or mobile application [. . .] with a\nclear and prominent means [. . .] to obtain any personal\ninformation of the minor that is in the possession of the\noperator from the operator [. . .] to challenge the accur-\nacy of personal information of the minor that is in the\npossession of the operator; and [. . .] if the minor estab-\nlishes the inaccuracy of personal information [. . .] to\nhave such information erased, corrected, completed,\nThis bill epitomizes the inability of regulators to see\nbeyond the fallacy. To expect that minors are capable\nof addressing all of the challenges identified herein, sug-\ngests that members of the US Congress continue to\npropose bills with romantic notions of citizen empower-\nment in mind, without focusing on pragmatics. The\nData Broker Accountability and Transparency Act of\nby Congress, includes a number of notice and choice\nprovisions similar to those presented by both the FTC\nand the White House. For example, there is the require-\nment that, ``a covered data broker shall maintain an\nInternet website and place a clear and conspicuous\nnotice on that Internet website instructing an individual\nhow [. . .] to review information under subsection (b)(1)\n(personal information).'' This requirement demon-\nstrates once again that regulatory efforts continue to\ndraw from the problematic FIPPs.\nBoth of these legislative efforts champion the notion\nof data privacy self-management as outlined in greater\ndetail in both the FTC and White House reports. These\nefforts call for individuals to have access to their data,\nand the opportunity to understand and control how\ntheir data is being collected, managed and used.\nLacking from each of these proposals, however, are\npragmatics designed to ensure the realization of data\nprivacy self-management.\nDiscussion\nI have been reading the new recommendations used to\nencourage data privacy self-management in the United\nStates. After reading them I do not see how any one\ncan escape the conclusion that the digital citizen must\nhave the appetite of a data miner and infinite time at\ntheir disposal. In these new proposals the digital citizen\nstudies the problems of Big Data, and not the structural\ndetail. They are told in reports from the FTC, the\nWhite House and the U.S. Congress about reading\nterms of service agreements, privacy policies, the seem-\ningly impossible task of communicating with poten-\ntially thousands of companies of all shapes, sizes and\nabilities, including data brokers who have never been in\nthe business of communicating with the public, review-\ning data sets even more diverse and complex, and being\nasked to critically engage with this data and its man-\nagement, as well as to understand the financial strate-\ngies of the entities wishing to profit from this data.\nAfter completing all of this, the digital citizen is then\nasked to provide restrictions for each of these data-\ndriven entities, continuously imposing multiple unique\nlimitations on a constantly and quickly evolving limit-\nless number of stockpiles and applications. This is all\naccomplished through the myriad interfaces determined\nappropriate by the data-driven entities that will be (and\nyou can be sure of this) more than happy to welcome\nthe millions of assuredly well-behaved and well-\ninformed information auditors into their vaults.\nBut nowhere in these well-meant recommendations is\nthe sovereign digital citizen of the future given a hint as\nto how, while earning a living, rearing children and\nenjoying life, they are to keep informed about the pro-\ngress of this swarming confusion of problems.\nFurthermore, the authors of these guidelines have\nmissed a decisive fact: the digital citizen gives but a\nlittle of their time to these affairs, has but a casual\ninterest in Big Data and but a poor appetite for theory.\nIt never occurs to these preceptors of data privacy\nself-management to provide the student with the rule\nby which they can know whether on Thursday it is\ntheir duty to consider Google's new data points or\nFacebook's new privacy policy, nor how, if they deter-\nmine on Thursday to express their sovereign will on\nthe data point question, the digital citizen is to repair\nthose gaps in their knowledge of that question which\nare due to having been preoccupied the day before in\nexpressing their sovereign will about Walmart's new\ndata management system or some data broker's mis-\nsion statement.\nYet the digital citizen cannot know all about everything\nall the time, and while they are watching one thing a\nthousand others undergo great changes. Unless the\ndigital citizen can discover some rational ground for\nfixing attention where it will do the most good, and\nin a way that suits inherently amateurish equipment,\nthe digital citizen will be as bewildered as a puppy\ntrying to lick three bones at once.\nOnce again, had Walter Lippmann been concerned\nwith the nature of our digital existence, perhaps this is\nhow the second chapter of The Phantom Public entitled\n``The Unattainable Ideal,'' might have started.\nMissing from the detailed guidelines formulated by\nthe FTC, the White House and the US Congress are\npragmatic strategies for data control and protection\nthat take into consideration all of the limitations and\nchallenges articulated by Lippmann and others. We\nhave only begun to realize the challenges associated\nwith the evolving universe of Big Data and new, tan-\ngential challenges are quickly coming into view. For\nexample, at the University of Toronto, IXmaps\nresearchers are beginning to uncover political econo-\nmies of data packet transmission. For instance, access-\ning a website or sending an email could result in routing\nvariegations, sometimes with data crossing national\nboundaries, presenting data collection and surveillance\nconcerns (Obar and Clement, 2012). Imagine having to\nunderstand, manage and control, not only the myriad\ndata stockpiles that exist, but also the routing data\nassociated with every data transmission.\nA partial answer to the fallacy of data privacy self-\nmanagement is articulated by Lippmann:\nThe interest of the public is not in the rules and con-\ntracts and customs themselves but in the maintenance\nof a re\n\u00b4 gime of rule, contract and custom. The public is\ninterested in law, not in the laws; in the method of law,\nnot in the substance; in the sanctity of contract, not in a\n12 Big Data & Society\nparticular contract; in understanding based on custom,\nEven if we had the faculties and the system for\ndata privacy self-management, the digital citizen has\nlittle time for data governance. What we desire is the\nfreedom to pursue the ends of digital production, with-\nout being inhibited by the means. The average digital\ncitizen wants privacy, and safety, but cannot complete\nall that is required for its protection.\nIf it is true that the fallacy of democracy is similar\nto the fallacy of data privacy self-management, then\nperhaps the imperfect yet pragmatic answer to the\nfallacy of data privacy self-management is to similarly\nintroduce a system of representative governance.\nRepresentative data management could contribute to\nthe protection of personal data while freeing individuals\nfrom the impossible task of data privacy self-manage-\nment. As scholars discuss models of privacy-focused info-\nmediaries (e.g. Mowbray et al., 2012), banks and\norganizations like the US-based Lifelock are already\noffering identity theft protection services to address a\nburgeoning consumer demand. Other more robust com-\nmercial and non-commercial representative data man-\nagers should be developed (perhaps modeled after\naccounting services), whose task will be to manage our\nmassive array of digital dossiers. The accountant analogy\nfits well as it provides an example of an infomediary that\ninterprets a complicated set of systems (i.e. the tax code\nand government tax systems) as well as our own personal\nfinancial data, while interfacing with the general public in\na user-friendly manner. Accountants also engage in a\nform of reputation management on our behalf, helping\nconsumers appropriately represent their financial status\nto the government. Each of these elements of the con-\nsumer\u00adaccountant relationship should be modeled as\nrepresentative data managers develop to meet consumer\ndemand. Though generating demand seems a difficult\ntask (would you pay someone to manage your online\nphotos?), consumer demand for representative data man-\nagers aught to increase, in light of the myriad Big Data\nproducts and services increasingly driving eligibility deci-\nsion-making (see Pasquale, 2015). Representative data\nmanagers would be responsible for continuously collect-\ning and patrolling our Big Data, while offering individ-\nuals a simplified, all-encompassing interface that can be\nmanaged and controlled from afar, perhaps annually.\nNon-commercial options should be developed, to offer\nservices that meet diverse consumer demands, in light\nof growing concerns over digital forms of discrimination\nresearch should address the extent to which representa-\ntive data management can address the challenges identi-\nfied by the fallacy of data privacy self-management, as\nwell as methods for generating demand for services.\nOne issue to be clarified when considering the appli-\ncation of Lippmann's self-governance critique and the\nsuggestion of a representative solution is the imperfect\nanalogy linking the fallacy of democracy and the fallacy\nof data privacy self-management. Indeed, one does not\nmirror the other perfectly. For example, democratic\ngovernment, whether popular or representative, aims\nto engender a system of governance for both the indi-\nvidual and the society as a whole. It would be a stretch\nto suggest that calls for data privacy self-management\nmake similar claims to governance of the entire Big\nData universe. What matters in terms of the applica-\ntion of the analogy is the analysis of impractical\nself-governance proposals and the long history of self-\ngovernance critique that led to the Dewey\u00adLippmann\ndebate, and should now extend to the Big Data context.\nAs we dip our heads beneath the waterline and force\nthe Big Data iceberg into public view, pragmatic, real-\nistic approaches to transparency, privacy and control\nare required. If we cling to romantic fallacy, we per-\npetuate what Lippmann referred to as ``a false ideal.''\nAs Lippmann states: ``I do not mean an undesireable\nBig Data context, the challenge of citizen empowerment\ndescribed here should be seen as an extension of the\nlongstanding self-governance debate, exemplified by\nthe works of John Dewey and Walter Lippmann.\nBoth framed their arguments in opposition to what\nthey viewed as a system struggling to find an autono-\nmous and efficacious role for the citizen. In the Big\nData context, Lippmann's pragmatism champions citi-\nzen empowerment by critiquing a governance model\nthat fails to achieve practical self-governance outcomes.\nAchieving pragmatic alternatives will not be easy. The\nfirst step towards a plan that expresses the true possi-\nbilities of its subject requires movement beyond roman-\ntic notions that remain as impossible as direct\ndemocracy within a nation of millions.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1. In this instance, the term ``digital citizen'' refers to any\nindividual who engages with digital media technologies,\nno matter how extensively. This broad definition is neces-\nsary to emphasize that light users also generate data.\n2. The ``biggest lie on the internet'' refers to the statement ``I\nhave read and agree to the terms'' (Finley, 2012; Greiner,\n3. Lippmann doesn't use the phrase ``fatal flaws,'' which is\nused herein to organize the most relevant self-governance\nconcerns identified in The Phantom Public.\n4. Though the classical direct democracy of ancient Greece is\noften held up as a normative ideal, in actuality, the Greek\npolitical system was prejudiced, sexist and emphasized\nexclusion in many respects.\n5. The Canadian privacy law most relevant is the Personal\nInformation and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). In\nEurope, the privacy law most relevant is the EU Data\nProtection Directive.\n7. The White House's Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights\nincludes the following seven rights: 1) individual control,\n2) transparency, 3) respect for context, 4) security, 5)\naccess and accuracy, 6) focused collection, and 7)\naccountability.\nReferences\nAcquisti A, Gross R and Stutzman F (2014) Face recognition\nand privacy in the age of augmented reality.
