The purpose of this study was to examine the correlates of religious participation among older Black\nCaribbeans.\nMethods. Data from the older Black Caribbean subsample of the National Survey of American Life were used to\nexamine selected measures of organizational, nonorganizational, and subjective religious participation.\nResults. The findings indicated important demographic differences in the correlates of religious participation among\nolder Black Caribbeans. In particular, gender, marital status, income, immigration status, and denomination were\nassociated with religious participation.\nDiscussion. We discuss study findings in relation to available ethnographic data on Black Caribbeans and prior survey\nresearch on religious participation among older African Americans. Although there were several similarities to the\nresearch on older African Americans and religious involvement (e.g., marital status, gender, denomination), noted\ndepartures from prior research findings (e.g., income effects) may indicate the influence of ethnic group membership and\nthe importance of the immigration experience in shaping distinctive life experiences for older Black Caribbeans.\nBLACK Caribbeans constitute a significant percentage of\nthe African American population and represent a major\nethnic subgroup. According to the 2000 census, there were 1.5\nmillion Black  , which roughly\nrepresents 4.5% of the Black population overall. This number\nreflects an increase of 67% in the growth of the Black\n2003). The Black Caribbean presence is especially evident in\nseveral cities on the East Coast, such as New York, Boston,\nMiami, and Fort Lauderdale, where at least 1 out of 5 African\nAmericans is of Caribbean descent (Logan & Deane, 2003).\nOverall, Black Caribbeans currently outnumber Koreans and\nCubans and are growing at a faster rate than both of these\nBlack Caribbean immigration and settlement in the United\nStates has occurred continuously over a period of time dating\nback to colonial era. Black Caribbeans represent a variety of\ngroups who, while having a shared heritage of African descent\nand enslavement, differ with respect to national origin, lan-\nguage, culture, and immigration history. The Black Caribbean\npopulation in the United States, although undergoing signifi-\ncant growth, is geographically concentrated in urban centers\non the East Coast and within so-called ethnic or immigrant\nenclaves (neighborhoods with high percentages of Black\nCaribbeans). Furthermore, as their immigration history sug-\ngests, Black Caribbeans reflect a full range of experience in the\nUnited States, from very recent arrivals to individuals who have\nseveral generations of family (naturalized and native born)\nwho trace their ancestry to the Caribbean region. These factors,\ncoupled with their shared racial heritage and physical similari-\nties with native African Americans, have contributed to their\nrelative invisibility within American society.\nResearch on Black Caribbeans has been primarily restricted\nto a limited number of qualitative and humanities-based studies.\nAs a consequence, researchers lack information concerning the\nstatus of important subgroups (e.g., based on age, gender, socio-\neconomic position) within this population, and the perceptions\nand unique life experiences of diverse members of this group.\nFor the purposes of this study, we were particularly interested\nin the nature and pattern of religious involvement among\na specific subgroup of Black Caribbeans, that of older adults.\nInvestigating religious participation among older adults is par-\nticularly important because religious involvement provides\nregular opportunities for interaction and informal support from\nfellow church members, provides access to clergy and the\nuse of religiously based coping strategies (e.g., prayer) for\nassistance with stressful life situations (e.g., health problems,\nbereavement), and, overall, exerts a salutary influence on phys-\nical and mental health status and general well-being (see review\nQualitative studies of Black Caribbeans have indicated that\nthe church has been an important institution and resource for\nnew immigrants and subsequent generations. Waters's (1999)\nextensive qualitative study of racial and group identity among\nBlack Caribbeans in Brooklyn, New York, indicated that the\nchurch plays a prominent role in Black Caribbean life. She\nnoted that many Black Caribbeans belong to an ethnically\nrooted church in which the congregation is composed exclu-\nsively of Black Caribbeans or, in some cases, individuals from\na specific Caribbean country. Black Caribbean churches fulfill\na dual function of providing spiritual and other forms of support\nto members, as well as reinforcing social relationships and\nconnections with other immigrants. McEachern and Kenny\n(2002) found that Black Caribbean women place great\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2007 by The Gerontological Society of America\nemphasis on religion, arguing that these women share strong\nreligious ties and a sense of loyalty, moral obligation, and\nrespect for the church and its teachings (p. 55).\nSystematic research on religious involvement among this\ngroup is virtually nonexistent. Researchers currently have little\ninformation regarding even the most fundamental aspects of\nreligious participation for the Black Caribbean population such\nas denominational affiliation, rates of religious service atten-\ndance and church membership, and types of prayer activities.\nThe situation is even more problematic with respect to\ninformation about religious participation for the subgroup that\nis of interest to this study, that of older Black Caribbeans.\nAccordingly, the goal of the present study was to provide a\npreliminary examination of the demographic correlates of reli-\ngious participation among older Black Caribbeans. This article\nbuilds upon recent work on race and ethnic differences in\nreligious participation (Taylor, Chatters, & Jackson, 2007).\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe Program for Research on Black Americans at the\nUniversity of Michigan's Institute for Social Research collected\nthe National Survey of American Life: Coping With Stress in\nthe 21st Century (NSAL). NSAL staff conducted a total of\n6,082 face-to-face interviews with persons aged 18 or older,\nand 1,621 Blacks of Caribbean descent (survey field period was\nbility sample of Black Caribbeans ever conducted.\nFor the purposes of this study, we defined Black Caribbeans\nas persons who (a) trace their ethnic heritage to a Caribbean\ncountry but who now reside in the United States, (b) are racially\nclassified as Black, and (c) are English speaking (but may also\nspeak another language). There are 303 Black Caribbeans aged\n55 and older who comprise the sample used in this study. The\noverall response rate was 72.3%.\nThe African American sample is the core sample of the\nNSAL. The core sample consists of 64 primary sampling units.\nThe Black Caribbean sample came from two area probability\nsample frames: the core NSAL sample and an area probability\nsample of housing units from geographic areas with a rela-\ntively high density of persons of Caribbean descent. In both the\nAfrican American and Black Caribbean samples, it was\nnecessary for respondents to self-identify their race as Black.\nThose self-identifying as Black were included in the Black\nCaribbean sample if they answered affirmatively when asked if\nthey were of West Indian or Caribbean descent, if they said\nthey were from a country included on a list of Caribbean area\ncountries presented by the interviewers, or if they indicated that\ntheir parents or grandparents had been born in a Caribbean area\ncountry (see Jackson et al., 2004). The interviews were face to\nface and conducted within respondents' homes. Respondents\nwere compensated for their time.\nMeasures\nThe present analysis investigated measures of organizational,\nnonorganizational, and subjective religious participation. The\nmeasures of organizational religious participation included\nfrequency of service attendance, church membership, and\nfrequency of participation in congregational activities. We\nassessed frequency of religious service attendance by combin-\ning two questions: ``Other than for weddings or funerals, have\nyou attended services at a church or other place of worship\nsince you were 18 years old?'' (yes/no) and ``How often do you\nusually attend religious services?'' The categories for this\ncombined variable were as follows: attend nearly every day,\nattend at least once a week, a few times a month, a few times\na year, less than once a year, and never. We measured church\nmembership by the question ``Are you an official member of\na church or other place of worship?'' (yes/no). We measured\nfrequency of participation in congregational activities by the\nquestion ``Besides regular service, how often do you take part\nin other activities at your church? Would you say nearly every\nday, at least once a week, a few times a month, a few times\na year, or never?''.\nNonorganizational religious participation comprised five\nitems: reading religious books or other religious materials,\nwatching religious programs on TV, listening to religious\nprograms on the radio, praying, and asking someone to pray for\nyou (Cronbach's a \u00bc .74). Respondents indicated how often\nthey engaged in each of these activities: nearly every day, at\nleast once a week, a few times a month, at least once a month,\na few times a year, or never. Subjective religiosity comprised\nfour items: importance of religion while growing up, impor-\ntance of parents taking or sending their children to religious\nservices, importance of religion in the respondent's life, and\nhow religious the respondent feels (Cronbach's a \u00bc .88).\nWe included several demographic variables in this analysis\nas independent variables, including age, gender, marital status,\neducation, family income, immigration status, and country of\norigin. We imputed missing data for family income. Income\nwas coded in dollars and divided by 5,000 in order to increase\neffect sizes and provide a better understanding of the net impact\nof income. Immigration status had four categories: (a) respon-\ndent was born in the United States, (b) respondent immigrated\nto the United States less than 25 years ago, (c) respondent\nimmigrated to the United States between 26 and 35 years ago,\nand (4) respondent immigrated to the United States 36 or more\nyears ago. Country of origin had four categories: Jamaica, other\nEnglish-speaking country (e.g., Barbados), Spanish-speaking\ncountry (e.g., Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic), and Haiti.\nWe included denomination as an independent variable, mea-\nsured by the question ``What is your current religion?''. This\nsample of older Black Caribbeans mentioned more than 35\ndifferent denominations that were recoded into eight categories:\nBaptist, Methodist, Pentecostal, Episcopal, Catholic, other\nProtestant (e.g., Lutheran, Presbyterian), other religion (e.g.,\nJewish, Buddhist, Muslim), and none.\nAnalysis Strategy\nWe conducted this analysis using the svy:regress and the svy:\nlogit commands in Stata 9.2. All analyses were design based, in\nthat they (a) utilized sampling weights and (b) accounted for the\ncomplex multistage design of the NSAL sample (i.e., clustering\nand stratification) when computing standard errors.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 provides the distribution for the demographic and\ndenomination factors used in this analysis. Table 2 presents the\nregressions of the religious involvement factors on the\ndemographic variables, controlling for denomination. Equation\n1 is the regression for service attendance, Equation 2 presents\nthe logistic regression for whether the respondent was an offi-\ncial member of a place of worship, Equation 3 is the regression\nfor frequency of participation in congregational activities, Equa-\ntion 4 presents the regression for frequency of nonorganiza-\ntional religious activities, and Equation 5 is the regression for\nsubjective religiosity.\nAs indicated in Equation 1, gender, marital status, education,\nimmigration status, and denomination were all significantly\nassociated with frequency of attending religious services.\nWomen attended religious services more frequently than men,\nand education was positively associated with attendance.\nAmong the marital status groups, married respondents attended\nreligious services more frequently than separated, divorced, and\nnever-married persons. Immigration status differences indicated\nthat respondents who immigrated to the United States less than\ngious services more frequently than respondents who were born\nin the United States. Baptists indicated attending religious\nservices more frequently than Catholics and persons who were\nnot affiliated with a denomination.\nEquation 2 presents the results of the logistic regression of\ndemographic variables on whether the respondent was an\nofficial member of a place of worship. Denomination was the\nonly variable that demonstrated a significant relationship.\nRespondents who were Catholic and those who did not report\na denomination were less likely than Baptists to be official\nmembers of a place of worship. Income, country of origin,\nand denomination were significantly associated with frequency\nof participation in congregational activities (Equation 3).\nRespondents with lower incomes participated in congregational\nactivities more frequently than those with higher incomes.\nRespondents from Jamaica participated in congregational acti-\nvities more frequently than respondents from other English-\nspeaking countries. Denomination differences indicated that\nBaptists participated in other activities at their place of wor-\nship more frequently than Episcopalians, Catholics, respond-\nents who identified other non-Christian religions, and those\nwho indicated that they did not have a religious denomination.\nGender, income, marital status, immigration status, and denom-\nination were all significantly associated with the frequency of\nnonorganizational religious activities (Equation 4). Women and\nrespondents with lower incomes reported engaging in non-\norganizational religious activities more frequently than men and\ntheir higher income counterparts. Married respondents engaged\nin nonorganizational religious activities more frequently than\ntheir never-married counterparts. Respondents who immigrated\nto the United States less than 25 years ago and those who\nimmigrated between 26 and 35 years ago reported engaging in\nnonorganizational religious activities more frequently than older\nBlack Caribbeans who were born in the United States. Lastly,\nBaptists reported less frequent nonorganizational activity than\nrespondents from Pentecostal churches but more frequent non-\norganizational activity than Catholics, other Protestants, and\nthose who did not have a religious denomination. Income and\ndenomination were significantly associated with degree of sub-\njective religiosity (Equation 5). Respondents with lower incomes\nindicated significantly higher levels of subjective religiosity than\ntheir higher income counterparts. Lastly, Baptists reported\nsignificantly higher levels of subjective religiosity than respond-\nents who were not affiliated with a religious denomination.\nDISCUSSION\nOverall, these findings are generally consistent with the\nlimited amount of previous research indicating that churches\nand religion are an important aspect of the lives of Black\narticle builds upon recent work of Taylor and colleagues\n(2007), who found that overall, older Black Caribbeans re-\nported fairly high levels of religious participation similar to\nthose of older African Americans and higher than those of\nolder White adults. There were two significant gender findings\nin the current analysis. Older Black Caribbean women\nattended religious services and engaged in nonorganizational\nreligious activities more frequently than their male counter-\nparts. This finding is consistent with previous research on both\nolder African Americans (Chatters, Levin, & Taylor, 1992)\nand African American adults (Levin, Chatters, & Taylor,\n1995). The finding that women demonstrated significantly\nhigher levels of religiosity is also consistent with research on\nTable 1.

Although previous research on marital\nstatus differences in religious participation is somewhat\nequivocal (Taylor et al., 2004), the present findings are\nconsistent with research indicating that marriage is associated\nwith higher levels of service attendance and other forms of\nreligious participation among African American adults and\nAfrican American elders (Chatters et al., 1992; Chatters &\nhere is that marriage was associated with higher levels of\nreligious service attendance and, in limited instances, non-\norganizational religious participation. Previous research has\nspeculated that the presence of a spouse encourages overall\nsocial integration in religious settings. Religious settings, in\nturn, often embody specific value orientations and program-\nmatic foci (e.g., family-life ministries) that reinforce marriage\nand family life and have positive influences on involvement in\nWe found several significant income effects: Income was\nnegatively associated with degree of subjective religiosity, as\nwell as participation in other activities at the place of worship\nand participation in nonorganizational religious activities. The\nnegative direction of these relationships indicates that older\nBlack Caribbeans with lower incomes reported significantly\nhigher levels of religious participation than their higher income\ncounterparts. Interestingly, prior research among older African\nAmericans has generally failed to find any significant asso-\nciations involving income and religious involvement of any\nTable 2.

We can attribute the emergence of several negative\nincome relationships in this sample to several possible factors.\nFirst, this set of findings is consistent with a deprivation\u00ad\ncompensation model (Glock, Ringer, & Babbie, 1967), which\nsuggests that among persons of lower socioeconomic status,\nreligion serves to compensate for blocked opportunities, limited\naccess to social institutions, and general social disadvantage. It\nmay be that religion does serve this specific purpose among\nlower status older Black Caribbeans. Second, qualitative\nportrayals of immigrant churches emphasize their important\nroles in integrating individuals and families within the fabric of\nthe community (Waters, 1999). Particular characteristics of\nimmigrant communities (i.e., relative insularity, cultural differ-\nences) may heighten the role of religious institutions and\ninvolvement as a means to procure needed material and social\nresources (e.g., social capital). Persons of lower income status\nmay be particularly inclined to invest in the church and religion\nto gain necessary resources. Finally, it is important to recall the\nobserved income effects for subjective religiosity, participation in\ncongregational activities, and nonorganizational religious activ-\nities. For lower income older Black Caribbeans, these religious\nmanifestations are an important means of defining a sense of self\nwithin a religious context and of establishing organizational\ninvolvement as a conduit for social capital. The single education\nfinding for church attendance (i.e., people with higher education\nattend church more often) reflects greater participation in this\nmore perfunctory component of public religious behavior. Taken\ntogether, the findings indicate that income and education do not\noperate similarly in patterning religious involvement. Investi-\ngating income and education effects within the entire adult\nsample of Black Caribbeans may shed light on the nature and\nextent of these status group differences.\nDenominational differences in religious participation among\nolder Black Caribbeans are consistent with research on the\ngeneral population. In particular, recent research from the Gallup\nPoll on the general American population reported that Baptists\nindicated higher levels of service attendance than Catholics\n(Newport, 2006), and that Catholics generally had lower levels\nof nonorganizational and subjective religious involvement\n(Gallup & Lindsay, 1999). Lower levels of participation in con-\ngregational activities among Catholics is consistent with research\non congregational climate (Pargament, Silverman, Johnson,\nEchemendia, & Snyder, 1983), characterizing Catholic churches\nas having lower levels of emotional closeness and sense of\ncommunity. The less hierarchical nature of Baptist churches may\nafford greater member involvement in congregational activities\n(e.g., committees, church boards) and overall member participa-\ntion. Alternatively, the findings of lower levels of attendance,\nmembership, and congregational activities could also indicate\nthat many older Black Caribbean Catholics may not have found\na church in which they feel comfortable.\nThere was only one instance in which Baptists had lower\nrates of religious involvement as compared to other denomina-\ntions. The higher rates of nonorganizational religious participa-\ntion among Pentecostals as compared to Baptists are consistent\nwith general observations. For instance, members of Pentecostal\ndenominations have high rates of membership in prayer groups\nand lay healing groups. In the present circumstance, a main\nportion of the denominational difference was due to the fact that\nPentecostals reported that they were more likely than Baptists to\nask someone to pray for them (analysis not shown).\nCountry of origin was significantly associated with only one\nreligious participation variable. Older Black Caribbeans who\nhad emigrated from or traced their heritage to Jamaica\nparticipated in congregational activities more frequently than\ndid respondents from other English-speaking countries. Older\nBlack Caribbeans who had emigrated from or traced their\nheritage to Spanish-speaking countries and Haiti were no\ndifferent from those of Jamaican heritage with respect to\nparticipation in congregational activities.\nImmigration status was significantly associated with two of\nthe religious participation variables: religious service atten-\ndance and nonorganizational religious participation. Older\nBlack Caribbeans who immigrated to the United States less\nthan 25 years ago and those who immigrated between 26 and\n35 years ago both demonstrated higher levels of service atten-\ndance and nonorganizational religious activities as compared to\nrespondents who were had been born in the United States\n(persons who immigrated more than 35 years ago were not\nsignificantly different than native-born older Black Caribbeans\nin relation to these religious variables). The finding that these\nrelatively more recent immigrants (0\u00ad35 years) demonstrated\nhigher levels of religious participation than persons who were\nborn in the United States is consistent with Waters's (1999)\nobservations concerning the importance of churches and reli-\ngious institutions in assisting the transition of Black Caribbean\nimmigrants into American life. That is to say, the higher levels\nof religious service attendance and nonorganizational religious\nactivities among older Black Caribbeans may be indicative of\nan overall pattern of strong connections to religious institutions\nand involvement in religious pursuits as a means to structure\nsocial and community life. This type of involvement is parti-\ncularly important in aiding the transition of immigrant groups\nas they adjust to living in large metropolitan cities.\nIt is important to recognize that one of the limitations of this\nsample is that it excluded individuals who did not speak\nEnglish. Non-English-speaking Black Caribbeans (i.e., persons\nwho speak Spanish, Haitian-French, or Creole dialects) were\nnot included in the sample and, as a consequence, the study\nfindings are not generalizeable to these groups. Nonetheless,\nthe significant advantages of the sample provide an unparalleled\nopportunity to begin important explorations into the nature of\nreligious involvement within this group.\nIn conclusion, the significant and growing presence of Black\n  suggests that this group\ndeserves more focused attention in the social and behavioral\nsciences. Although prior research findings among older African\nAmericans served as the foundation for this preliminary\ninvestigation, this is not meant to equate the experiences of\nthese two groups. A tradition of ethnographic research on their\nexperiences and life histories attests to the unique factors that\ncontinue to shape the development of Black Caribbean\nindividuals, families, and communities. This study, along\nwith other recent work (Taylor et al., 2007), is an initial\nattempt to develop a more nuanced understanding of religious\ninvolvement among older Black Caribbeans and the role of key\nstatus characteristics (e.g., age, gender, socioeconomic posi-\ntion) among members of this group.\n"
