More importantly,\nmany studies have described different\ntrends in the number and morphology of\nroots and root canals among different\nethnicities, between the two sexes,2 and\namong different ages.3\u00ad6\nThe maxillary second molars (MSMs)\nhave been frequently investigated because\nof their complex root and root canal morph-\nology and higher incidence of variations.\nMost MSMs exhibit a mesiobuccal root\n(MBR), a distobuccal root (DBR), and a\npalatal root (PR).7 A common anatomic\nvariation in these teeth is root fusion, with a\net al.8 indicated that the prevalence of root\nfusion of MSMs in a Chinese population in\nTaiwan was 40.1%. Fusion of the PR with\nthe MBR was the most prevalent, followed\nby fusion of the MBR with the DBR;\ncomplete fusion of the three roots into a\ncone-shaped root was the least common.\nOther studies of the native Chinese popula-\ntion have revealed that fusion of the two\nbuccal roots (BRs) of MSMs was the most\nreported that the prevalence of MSMs with\nthree separate roots in a Brazilian popula-\nanatomic variation was a mesial root (MR)\nand a distal root (DR) with one canal in the\nMR and two canals in the DR. Plotino\net al.13 found that a BR and PR was the\nmost common anatomic variation in the\nMSMs in a white population. Kim et al.4\nfound that the incidence of fused roots was\nand four separate roots were identified in\nfour (0.49%) of the MSMs, including three\nBRs and one PR, two DBRs, one MBR, and\none PR. In addition, Kottoor et al.14\nreported an MSM of a 35-year-old man\nexhibiting two PRs, two MBRs, and one\nDBR each with its own separate canal. Zeng\net al.15 treated a right MSM exhibiting a C-\nshaped MBR with two canals, two fused\nDBRs with two separate canals, and one\nnormal bulky PR with one canal.\nMany methods have been used to evalu-\nate the root canal morphology. The most\ncommonly used methods include canal\nstaining and tooth clearing,2,16 periapical\nradiographs,17 and micro-computed tomog-\nraphy (micro-CT).9 The canal staining and\ntooth clearing technique has generally been\nconsidered the gold standard in previous\nstudies.2,16 However, this technique cannot\nbe used in vivo, and it is not repeatable\nbecause of its destruction to teeth. Periapical\nradiographs have generally been used in\nclinical examinations, but the defects of\nanatomical noise, two-dimensionality, and\ngeometric distortion have restricted its\napplication in investigations.18,19 Micro-CT\nimaging has been applied to evaluate the\nroot and root canal anatomy because of its\nhigh resolution and lack of specimen\ndestruction.9 However, micro-CT cannot\nbe used to scan the head of a living\nhuman, which limits its clinic application.\nRecently, cone-beam computed tomography\n(CBCT) has been widely used in endodontic\nregions because it provides improved accur-\nacy, higher resolution, and lower effective\nradiation doses than does conventional\nCT.20 CBCT images can display the axial,\nsagittal, and coronal planes of the roots and\nroot canals, reducing the superimposition of\nsurrounding structures.21 Studies have con-\nfirmed that CBCT images are as accurate as\nthe modified staining technique in identify-\ning the root canal system and much more\naccurate than periapical radiographs.22\nCBCT as a nondestructive scanning tech-\nnique has become a powerful tool in endo-\ndontic diagnosis, treatment planning, and\nPrevious studies have reported the\nnumber of root canals of MSMs in native\nstudies have explicitly investigated the mor-\nphological characteristics of the MSMs\naccording to the sex and age of the patients.\nTherefore, the objective of this study was to\ninvestigate the root and root canal morph-\nology of MSMs in a large sample of a native\nChinese population according to sex and age\nusing CBCT images.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nThis study was approved by the Ethical\nCommittee Department, Affiliated Hospital\nof Stomatology, Nanjing Medical\ninformed consent was obtained from the\npatients. High-quality CBCT images were\nrandomly collected from the Department of\nRadiology, Affiliated Hospital of\nStomatology, Nanjing Medical University\nreasons for CBCT scanning included man-\nagement of impacted teeth before orthodon-\ntic treatment, preoperative assessment for\ndental implants, treatment planning before\nnonsurgical and surgical endodontic treat-\nment, and diagnosis of facial trauma. The\nCBCT images fulfilled the following inclu-\nsion criteria: the presence of MSMs; MSMs\nwith fully formed apices; and no root canal\nfillings, posts, coronal restorations, frac-\ntures, root resorption, apical periodontitis,\nor any other odontogenic or nonodonto-\ngenic pathology.\nand 734 women were selected. The details of\nthe selected specimens are shown in Table 1.\nThe mean age of the men and women was\nImage acquisitions and evaluations\nCBCT images were obtained using a CBCT\ndevice (NewTom 5G; QR s.r.l., Verona,\nItaly) with the following parameters: 110\nkVp and 10 mA, a basic voxel size of\nselected according to the examination\nrequirements.

The inter-\nexaminer and intraexaminer reliability were\nassessed by statistical analysis using Cohen's\nkappa. The endodontists then simultan-\neously evaluated the CBCT images with\nNNT software version 4.6 (ImageWorks,\nElmsford, NY). All MSMs were analyzed\nusing serial axial, sagittal, and coronal\nplanes with a slice thickness of 0.3 mm, and\nthe contrast and brightness of the images\ncould be adjusted using the software to\nensure optimal visualization. After 2\nweeks, the two endodontists evaluated the\nCBCT images again, and a radiologist with\nendodontic experience resolved any dis-\nagreements. The following observations\nwere recorded:\n(1) Number and morphology of roots\nThe number and morphology of roots\nwere classified into the following categories,\nmodified from the method described by\nYang et al.8:\nCategory I: One root\nSubdivision 1: Cone-shaped root\nSubdivision 2: B-shaped root\nSubdivision 3: V-shaped root\nCategory II: Two roots\nSubdivision 1: BR (MBR fused with\nSubdivision 2: MR (MBR fused with\nSubdivision 3: MBR \u00fe DR (DBR fused\nwith PR)\nCategory III: Three roots: MBR \u00fe DBR \u00fe\nPR\nCategory IV: Four roots: MBR \u00fe DBR \u00fe\nmesiopalatal root \u00fe distopalatal root\n(2) Root canal morphology\nThe root canal morphology of every\nroot of the MSMs was analyzed\naccording to Vertucci' s classification.1 The\nincidence of additional canals was also\ndetermined.\n(3) Symmetry of MSMs\nThe symmetry in the root and the root\ncanal morphology of the MSMs on the\nopposite side were evaluated.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS 19.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) at a\nsignificance level of P < 0.05.

The percentage\nof fused roots increased with age in both men\nand women, while the percentage of fused\nroots was higher in women than men in each\nage group (P < 0.05). The Kruskal\u00adWallis\ntest showed significant associations between\nthe percentage of fused roots and sex\nFor one-rooted MSMs, a cone-shaped\nroot was the most prevalent while a B-\nshaped root was the least prevalent in both\nmen and women. For two-rooted MSMs,\nSubdivision 1 roots were the most prevalent\nin men, while Subdivision 2 roots were the\nmost prevalent in women. Subdivision 3\nroots were the least prevalent in both men\nand women.\nNumber and morphology of root canals\nThe root canal morphology of one-rooted\nMSMs included Vertucci's Type I, II, IV, V,\nand VIII (Figure 3a and b) and five add-\nitional canal types identified as follows: 1-2-\nFor two-rooted MSMs, all nonfused\nroots had Vertucci's Type I canals, whereas\nthe fused roots showed complex root canal\nmorphologies. For Subdivision 1, the BRs\nhad Vertucci's Type I, II, III, IV, V, VIII,\nand 3-2 type. Type IV canals were the most\ncommon in men, while Type I canals were\nthe most common in women. For\nSubdivisions 2 and 3, most of the fused\nroots had Type IV canals in both men and\nwomen (Figure 3c, Tables 3 and 4).\nFigure 2.

The percent-\nages of second mesiobuccal (MB2) canals in\nthe MBR was significantly higher in men\nthan women in every age group except the\n!51-year group (Table 5, Figure 3d). The\n31- to 40-year age group showed a higher\nprevalence of MB2 canals than the other age\ngroups (P < 0.05), while MB2 canals were\nmore frequently absent in the !51-year\ngroup in both men and women (P < 0.05).\nFor four-rooted MSMs, each of the four\nroots had only one canal.\nSymmetry in the bilateral MSMs\nhad perfect symmetry in the root and root\ncanal morphology on the opposite side. Men\nhad higher symmetry than women (P < 0.05)\nsymmetry than the other age groups\n(P < 0.05), while in women, there were no\nsignificant differences among the age groups\n(Table 6).\nDiscussion\nMany studies have revealed that the pres-\nence of three separate roots is the most\ncommon morphology in MSMs (incidence\nMSMs are very rare (incidence of 0.06%\u00ad\nMSMs had three separate roots and that\narate roots in men and women, respectively.\nThe prevalence of root fusion in women\n(48.44%) was significantly higher than that\nfused roots increased with age in both men\nand women. Additionally, the form of root\nfusion was not the same between men and\nwomen. Possible explanations for these\nobservations are that (1) the cementum\ndeposition with time differs between men\nand women, resulting in different forms and\nprevalences of root fusion, and (2) the\ncementum deposition with time is not uni-\nform in people of the same sex and peaks in\nold age, resulting in a complex and change-\nful root morphology in old age.\nThe incidence of MB2 canals in MSMs\net al.10 reported that MB2 canals were present\nin 18% of the MSMs in a Chinese popula-\ntion, and Weng et al.24 reported that MB2\ncanals were present in 14% in the MSMs in\nsubjects of Han ethnicity in the same Chinese\npopulation. In the present study, the preva-\nlences of MB2 canals in three-rooted MSMs\nrespectively. The prevalence of MB2 canals\nwas significantly different between men and\nage group showed the highest prevalence of\nMB2 canals, but both men and women in the\n!51-year age groups showed the lowest\nTable 5.

Bilateral symmetry of roots and root\ncanals of maxillary second molars.\nAge (y) Men Women P\nprevalence of MB2 canals. These results are\nconsistent with previous reports in Korean4\nand Brazilian5 populations, in which the\nprevalence of MB2 canals was found to be\nassociated with patient age. The present\nresults are also consistent with a previous\nreport in a Japan population, which con-\nfirmed that canal differentiation was com-\npleted around 30 to 40 years of age for the\ndeposition of secondary dentin, resulting in a\nlow prevalence of intercanal communications\nat young and old ages but a high prevalence\nat intermediate ages.3 These results confirm\nthe above-mentioned possible explanations\nfor why the deposition of secondary dentin\nwith time differs between men and women\nand is not uniform in people of the same sex.\nIn general, the root canal morphology of\nMSMs changes as age advances, but it\nbecomes more complex at intermediate ages.\nBilateral symmetry of the presence or\nabsence of MB2 canals of MSMs was found\net al.10 and Tian et al.11 reported that bilat-\neral homonymous MSMs were present in\npopulation, respectively. In addition, Plotino\npatients. In the present study, bilateral sym-\nmetry of the MSM root and root canal\nand 59.22% of women, and the main pattern\nof asymmetry was the presence of a single\ncanal in each root of three-rooted MSMs.\nThe highest symmetry was found in the 20- to\n30-year age group, and lower bilateral sym-\nto 50-year age groups; this may have been\ncaused by the simple root canal morphology\nat young ages and complicated morphology\nat intermediate ages.\nThis study has provided a detailed\ndescription of the root and canal morphol-\nogies of MSMs in a large sample of a\nChinese population. These findings are\nvery important for clinicians because they\nwill help to increase the success rates for\nendodontic treatment of patients of different\nsexes and ages. However, accessory canals\nmay not be readily identified because of the\nresolution of CBCT. In addition, the higher\nradiation and higher cost of CBCT scanning\ncompared with periapical radiography\nhinder its clinical application, especially for\nendodontic treatment.\nConclusions\nThe root and root canal morphology of\nMSMs in a Chinese population showed asso-\nciations with sex and age. Root fusion was\nincreased with age, while root canal morph-\nology was more complex at intermediate ages.\n"
