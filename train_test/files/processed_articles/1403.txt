METHODS: With serum LH peak day as the `gold standard' of ovulation,\nwe estimated accuracy and precision of ovulation day algorithms using 30 ovulatory menstrual cycles with daily uri-\nnary and serum hormones and transvaginal ultrasound. Sensitivity and specificity for estimating the presence of ovu-\nlation were tested using visually assessed ovulatory (30) and anovulatory (22) cycles. RESULTS: Sensitivity and\nspecificity ranged from 70 to 100% for estimating presence of ovulation with twice-per-cycle, weekly, twice weekly,\nevery-other-day and daily specimens. A combined hierarchical method estimated ovulation day using daily speci-\nmens within \u00b12 days of the gold standard in 93% of cases. Accuracy of estimating ovulation day within \u00b12 days using\nintermittent sampling ranged from 40% (weekly sampling) to 97% (every-other-day). CONCLUSIONS: A combined\nhierarchical algorithm using precise and accurate markers allows maximal use of available data for efficient and\nobjective identification of ovulation using daily specimens. In intermittent sampling designs, the presence and the\ntiming of ovulation can be estimated with good sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.\nKey words: estrone conjugates/estrone glucuronide/FSH/LH/pregnanediol glucuronide\nIntroduction\nA variety of urinary hormone-based methods are available to\ndetect the presence or absence and timing of ovulation, and\nthey are increasingly used in large-scale and long-term studies\nof reproduction (e.g. Joseph-Horne et al., 2002; Liu et al.,\nongoing development and critical evaluation. In this paper, we\nevaluate the performance of existing methods and present new\napproaches, including evaluation of ovulation marker methods\nfor precision, combining multiple ovulation markers into a\nhierarchical system and the use of ovulation markers in inter-\nmittent sampling designs.\nPublished methods for estimating the day of ovulation are\nusually evaluated for accuracy (Baird et al., 1991; Ecochard\npaper has systematically examined precision (Royston, 1983).\nAccuracy is a measure of how close a marker is to the day of\novulation. A marker may occur, on average, close to ovulation,\nand therefore be accurate, but we also need to know how pre-\ncise it is; that is, whether there is high variation among women\nor cycles in the relationship of the marker with the day of ovu-\nlation. Ideally, we would like markers that are both accurate\nand precise. In the absence of a marker that is both accurate\nand precise, we should favour precise markers over accurate\nones, because bias resulting from inaccuracy can be corrected,\nwhereas bias from imprecision cannot. To facilitate choosing\nprecise markers for estimating day of ovulation, we evaluated a\nrange of urinary and serum hormone markers of ovulation for\nprecision.\nTechnology in recent decades has facilitated the assay of\nspecimens for multiple hormones. Research examining multi-\nple hormones from daily specimens not only gives us the\nopportunity for a more comprehensive picture of reproductive\nOvulation detection using urinary hormones\nfunction but also provides us with multiple markers of ovula-\ntion. However, few researchers have taken advantage of this in\na systematic fashion. Dunson and colleagues used two urinary-\nbased methods [Baird's day of luteal transition (Baird et al.,\n1991) and the day of the luteinizing hormone peak] to estimate\nday of ovulation, and they point out that this approach\nimproves accuracy and enables one to maintain sample size\neven when one of the markers, such as the easily missed LH\npeak, is not available in individual cases (Dunson et al., 2001).\nWe extend this approach to develop a hierarchical combination\nalgorithm that takes advantage of the best indicators preferen-\ntially when applied to individual cases and only uses less-\nprecise measures when better markers are unavailable.\nResearch sampling designs should be geared towards seek-\ning a balance between minimizing subject collection burden\nand project costs and providing sufficient data for reliable esti-\nmation of ovulation status and timing. Although several meth-\nods for estimating the presence or absence of ovulation have\nbeen evaluated for sensitivity and specificity using daily hor-\net al., 2003), they have not been evaluated for use with inter-\nmittent sampling designs. Similarly, methods for estimating\nthe day of ovulation have been examined for accuracy using\ntent data. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published,\nvalidated algorithms for estimating the presence or absence, or\nday, of ovulation using intermittent sampling designs. We\ntherefore examined the performance of a range of urinary hor-\nmone-based methods for use with intermittent data collection\nstrategies, including twice per cycle, once per week, twice per\nweek and every other day.\nOur goals were thus to (i) identify ovulation markers with\nthe highest sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and precision; (ii)\ncombine the best methods into a hierarchical algorithm to max-\nimize use of available data in studies using multiple hormone\nindicators and (iii) evaluate the performance of ovulation\ndetection markers for intermittent sampling designs. In addi-\ntion to providing methods for efficient and objective evaluation\nof ovulation, this information will facilitate the use of the best\navailable methods for different research objectives and can\nalso enable researchers to account for error when estimating\nWe used two convenience samples to achieve our goals. The\nfirst data set includes daily urinary pregnanediol glucuronide\n(PDG), estrone glucuronide (E1G), LH and FSH data for 58\nvisually assessed ovulatory and anovulatory menstrual cycles.\nThe second includes daily serum and urine measurements of\nfour reproductive hormones across the menstrual cycle and\ndaily mid-cycle transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) measures from\n30 ovulatory cycles.\nMaterials and methods\nParticipants and specimens\nHormone results and menstrual diary data from two studies were used\nto develop and test urinary markers of ovulation. The first convenience\nsample was used to evaluate methods for presence or absence of\novulation and came from the Biodemographic Models of Reproductive\nAgeing (BIMORA) project, a 5-year, prospective study of the hormo-\nnal and menstrual cycle characteristics of reproductive ageing (Ferrell\net al., 2005). Participants provided written informed consent and\nreceived compensation. The institutional review boards of Georget-\nown University, the University of Utah, the Pennsylvania State Uni-\nversity and the University of Washington approved all procedures.\nwomen collected daily first morning urine specimens and provided\ninformation on menstrual bleeding, prescription and over-the-counter\nsupplement and drug use and health conditions and medical proce-\ndures. We excluded data collected during and 3 months following any\nevent that was known to affect menstruation or hormone levels\nmens from 58 menstrual cycles, is used in the present study. For this\nsubset, we used only complete menstrual cycles that fell within one of\nthe five 6-month urine specimen collection windows.\nIn the second convenience sample, 799 daily urine and serum spec-\nimens were collected across one menstrual cycle from 30 US women\nageing (Klein et al., 2004). Monetary compensation was provided,\nparticipants provided written informed consent and all procedures\nwere approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of\nWashington. Participants were normally cycling, in good health and\nnot using medications or hormones. Daily morning blood specimens\nwere obtained by venipuncture, beginning with the first day of men-\nstrual bleeding and continuing until the first day of menstrual bleeding\nof the subsequent cycle. Daily TVU monitoring began in the mid-fol-\nlicular phase and continued until follicle collapse was observed.\nSerum specimens were at the end of the study collection period\nassayed, all cycles were confirmed ovulatory by TVU and day of folli-\ncle collapse was determined in 27 of the 30 cycles. Urine specimens\nwere taken daily in the clinic, usually at the same time as blood collec-\ntion and thawed 2 years later for assay.\nAssays\nAll serum specimens were assayed for estradiol (E2\n), LH and FSH,\nbut serum progesterone was measured only in the luteal phase (the\ntiming of the luteal phase was determined using evidence of follicle\ncollapse by TVU). The radioimmunoassay for E2\n(ICN Biomedicals,\nIrvine, CA, USA) had inter- and intra-assay coefficients of varia-\ntions (CVs) of 16 and 7%. The radioimmunoassay for progesterone\n(Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX, USA) had inter-\nand intra-assay CVs of 13 and 11%. Solid-phase two-site immun-\nofluorometric assays (IFMA) (Wallac, Turku, Finland) were used to\nestimate the serum levels of intact LH and FSH. The LH IFMA\ncross-reacts less than 1% with FSH, and the inter- and intra-assay\nCVs were 2.8 and 4.7% respectively. The FSH IFMA cross-reacts\nless than 1% with LH, and the inter- and intra-assay CVs were 2.3\nand 4.6% respectively.\nCompetitive enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) were used to assay\nurine specimens for PDG, E1G and estrone conjugates (E1C). The\nPDG, E1C and E1G EIAs are described in detail elsewhere (O'Connor\ncients of variation were 10.3 and 9.2% respectively for the PDG EIA\n2003). Urinary and serum concentrations were highly correlated:\n(O'Con-\nSandwich immunoenzymometric assays were used to measure -LH\nand -FSH in urine (Brindle et al., unpublished data). The inter- and\nK.A.O'Connor et al.\nintra-assay CVs for the LH assay were 6.8 and 3.7% respectively. The\ninter- and intra-assay CVs for the FSH assay were 3.7 and 4.1%\nrespectively. Urinary LH and FSH values were highly correlated with\nserum hormone results: Pearson correlations between urine and serum\n(Brindle et al., unpublished data).\nAll specimens, calibrators and controls were run in duplicate, and\nhormone concentrations were estimated from optical density using a\nfour-parameter logistic model in BIOLINX 2.0 Software (Dynatech\nLaboratories, Inc., Chantilly, VA, USA). All urinary hormone values\nwere adjusted by specimen specific gravity, using the following equa-\ntion and a population mean (target) specific gravity of 1.020: corrected\nhormone concentrationsample\n= raw hormone concentrationsample\n\u00d7\n(specific gravitytarget\n-1.0/specific gravitysample\nEstimating presence or absence of ovulation\nThe ability of algorithms to detect the presence or absence of ovula-\ntion was evaluated using (i) sensitivity [the ability to detect a true pos-\nitive (ovulation), defined as the number of cycles classified as\novulatory/true number of ovulatory cycles]; (ii) specificity [the ability\nto detect a true negative (anovulation), defined as the number of\ncycles classified anovulatory/true number of anovulatory cycles] and\n(iii) the percent of cycles correctly classified by a method (defined as\nthe number of cycles correctly classified/total number of cycles). The\nKassam (Kassam et al., 1996) PDG moving averages interval method,\nthe Baird (Baird et al., 1991) day of luteal transition (DLT) method\nand mid-cycle LH and FSH peaks (Aedo et al., 1976; Kesner et al.,\nThe Kassam (Kassam et al., 1996) method uses a ratio of daily\nPDG to the minimum 5-day moving average PDG to identify a sus-\ntained PDG rise, defined as 3 consecutive days of a ratio of target day\nPDG to the 5-day running average  three times the baseline in com-\nplete cycles (cycle method) or across time intervals (interval method)\nwhen cycle day is uncertain. The Baird et al. (Baird et al., 1991) algo-\nrithm identifies the timing of ovulation using rules for finding an\nabrupt change in the ratio of estrogen to progesterone (E/P). To\nidentify urinary LH and FSH peak days, we modified existing\nmethods which identify significant LH peaks (Aedo et al., 1976;\nday with the highest concentration as evidence of ovulation, we\nconsidered the timing of the LH and FSH peaks to distinguish\nthose occurring around the time of menses (e.g. Miro and Aspinall,\n2005) from those at mid-cycle. Additionally, we specified that an\nLH or FSH peak be followed by a rise in PDG for a cycle to be\ndeemed ovulatory. Peak days were identified as those with the\nhighest LH or FSH value the average LH or FSH value for the\nentire menstrual segment plus two SDs of all values for the men-\nstrual segment. Only peaks occurring 4 days before, on the day\nof, or 1 day after the first day of a sustained PDG rise (as defined\nby the Kassam algorithm) were considered.\nThe above four methods (Kassam, Baird, LH and FSH) were\napplied to 58 menstrual cycles from the BIMORA project, for\nwhich we had daily urines and menstrual diaries. The cycles were\nselected from a database of hormone profiles of roughly 2000 com-\nplete menstrual segments from 156 women and independently eval-\nuated for ovulation status by two researchers with extensive\nexperience interpreting urinary reproductive hormone profiles.\nOnly uncensored cycles with relatively complete data (no more than\nabout 3 days in a row missing) were considered. Starting with the\ncycles in chronological order by subject, the first researcher chose one\ncycle (the first cycle) per subject from every other subject until 30\napparently ovulatory and 30 abnormal (anovulatory or indeterminate)\ncycles were selected. The same researcher then re-evaluated the\n30 abnormal cycles and categorized them as anovulatory or indeter-\nminate. All 60 hormone profiles were printed, shuffled and then\nassessed by the second researcher, who was blinded to both the ini-\ntial classification of the cycles and the expected number of cycles of\neach category. Visual inspection of the patterns of E1G, PDG, LH\nand FSH was used to assess ovulatory status: specifically, we looked\nfor the presence of a follicular phase rise, mid-cycle peak and then\nlate cycle decline in E1G, midcycle peaks in LH and/or FSH and a\nsignificant and sustained rise in PDG towards the end of the cycle.\nBoth experts were in agreement on the classifications: 30 were ovu-\nlatory, 22 were anovulatory and six were indeterminate. Neither\nresearcher was aware of the age or reproductive history of the\nwomen contributing the segments. Algorithm performance was eval-\nuated by estimating sensitivity and specificity of the four methods\nusing the visual classification of presence or absence of ovulation as\nthe `gold standard.' The six indeterminate cycles were excluded in\nthe specificity and sensitivity analyses.\nEstimating day of ovulation\nThe ability of ovulation algorithms to estimate the day of ovulation\nwas examined for a range of markers using the data set of 30 ovarian\ncycles, 27 of which were confirmed ovulatory by TVU and three of\nwhich were deemed ovulatory by the presence of the serum LH peak\nand subsequent sustained serum progesterone elevation. Performance\nof each marker was evaluated by precision (consistency across women\nor cycles in timing relative to ovulation) and accuracy (proximity to\novulation day). For each of the methods discussed below, accuracy\nwas assessed by how close the mean difference between a marker and\nthe gold standard (marker minus gold difference or `MMGD') was to\nzero. Precision of each marker was assessed as (i) the SD of the\nMMGD and (ii) the percentage of estimates on and within \u00b11 and \u00b12\ndays of the mode of the MMGD. Markers designated as precise have\nthe smallest MMGD SD and the highest percentage of estimates fall-\ning on or within \u00b11 or \u00b12 days of the MMGD mode. Cases for which a\nmarker was not available were not included in estimates of either\naccuracy or precision.\nWe selected the day of the serum LH peak as our gold standard; the\nday of the serum LH peak is considered the day of ovulation and\noccurs, on average, 1 day earlier than follicle collapse observed by\n1980). The serum LH peak was defined as the highest mid-cycle\nserum LH value in a cycle.\nSeveral widely used methods for identifying ovulation day were\nevaluated: two versions of Baird's DLT method, one using E1G and\nmethod; the mid-cycle peak day of urinary LH (Kesner et al., 1998)\nand the mid-cycle peak day of urinary FSH (Li et al., 2002). Baird and\ncolleagues' (Baird et al., 1991) DLT algorithm identifies the day of\novulation as the 2nd day in a 5-day sequence where there is a 60% or\ngreater decline in the ratio of E/P between the first and the last 2 days\nof the sequence. The Waller et al. (Waller et al., 1998) method is a\nmodification of the Baird DLT method, with more specific criteria for\nidentifying ovulation day based on the peak and subsequent change in\nthe E/P ratio and a modification of the PDG ratio to accommodate\nvery high and low levels of PDG. We modified existing methods for\nidentifying ovulatory LH and FSH peaks to consider the magnitude\nand timing of the peak to distinguish mid-cycle peaks from those\noccurring around menses (Miro and Aspinall, 2005). The peak day\nhad the highest LH or FSH value the average LH or FSH value for\nthe entire menstrual cycle plus two SDs of all values for the cycle.\nOnly peaks occurring within 4 days before, on the day of, or 1 day\nafter the first day the Kassam PDG ratio was 3 for at least 3 consec-\nutive days were considered.\nOvulation detection using urinary hormones\nWe also evaluated methods less commonly used \u00ad the peak day of\nurinary E1G and the peak day of urinary E1C (Royston, 1983; Baird\n(Kassam et al., 1996) urinary PDG-based interval and cycles method\n\u00ad for their ability to identify ovulation day. The Kassam method for\nidentifying a sustained rise in PDG was modified to estimate the day\nof ovulation: we used the first day of the sustained rise in PDG as the\nday of ovulation. The urinary E1G and E1C peaks were defined as the\nhighest values in a menstrual segment.\nWe also examined the relationships of serum FSH, LH and E2\npeaks with the gold standard. The same peak identification methods\nused for urinary peaks of these hormones were used with the serum\ndata.\nCombination hierarchical algorithm\nThe best-performing urinary hormone markers were combined to\ncreate a hierarchical method for determining presence or absence\nand day of ovulation. The combined method was constructed using\nfour criteria: (i) the presence or absence of ovulation was estimated\nusing the method with the highest sensitivity and specificity; (ii) if\novulation occurred, the marker with the highest precision and accu-\nracy was used to estimate day of ovulation; (iii) the hierarchy\nfavoured the most precise and accurate method for determining ovu-\nlation day but would compensate for its absence on a case-by-case\nbasis by using the second most accurate or precise method in the\nhierarchy; if an individual case did not have data for the second-\nchoice method, then the third most accurate or precise method in the\nhierarchy was used, and so on; (iv) the individual methods in the\nhierarchy had to be amenable to automation. We considered preci-\nsion more important than accuracy, so markers consistently the same\nnumber of days from the gold standard were ranked higher than\nthose occurring nearer the gold standard but which had high varia-\nbility from cycle to cycle.\nEstimating presence or absence of ovulation with intermittent\nspecimen sampling designs\nIntermittent sampling designs using every-other-day, twice-weekly,\nweekly and twice-per-menstrual cycle collection protocols were simu-\nlated in our data sets. Every-other-day collection was simulated by\nrandomly selecting either the first or second day of data available for\neach cycle and then every second day through the rest of the cycle.\nFor twice-weekly sampling, two situations were simulated. In the\nfirst, the first day of specimen collection was the first day of menstrual\nbleeding, and the next day of collection was 3 days later, followed by\na collection 4 days later, followed by a collection 3 days later, and so\non. In the second simulated situation, specimens were collected every\nMonday and Thursday, beginning on the first Monday in a menstrual\ncycle. To simulate weekly collection, similar scenarios were used:\nbeginning collection on the first day of menses or on a Monday. To\nsimulate twice-per-menstrual cycle sampling, we used the 7th and\n21st day of each cycle, assuming an average 28-day cycle length,\ngiven that specimen collection days would need to be decided in\nadvance without knowing completed cycle length.\nThese sampling designs were simulated using both data sets com-\nbined, for a total of 82 (60 ovulatory and 22 anovulatory) menstrual\ncycles. Ovulation algorithms were applied to determine the presence\nor absence of ovulation in each menstrual cycle, and performance was\nassessed by estimating sensitivity and specificity against the `gold\nstandard' determination made using the most sensitive and specific\nalgorithm with daily data.\nThe ovulation algorithms were designed for use with daily data and\nhad to be modified for intermittent sampling. We evaluated only the\nKassam and Baird methods; these are both based on a rise in PDG,\nwhich is the only indicator that spans enough days to accommodate\nintermittent sampling designs. Our modifications were designed to\nbalance reduced observations with stringent criteria indicative of ovu-\nlation or its absence. The modifications are summarized in Table I,\nalong with the reasoning for each modification.\nEstimating day of ovulation with intermittent specimen\nsampling designs\nTo estimate the day of ovulation with data collected weekly,\ntwice-weekly and every-other-day, variations of the basic princi-\nples of the Kassam algorithm were evaluated for precision and\naccuracy. For example, for weekly data, we examined the first\nday the Kassam ratio exceeded 3 as well as up to 4 days before and\nup to 5 days after in order to identify which algorithm had the\nhighest precision and accuracy. The denominator of the ratio also\nvaried by sampling design: it was simply the minimum PDG value\nin a menstrual segment for weekly and twice-weekly sampling but\nwas calculated using a running three-sample average for every-\nother-day data.\nWe also tested a modified version of the Baird et al. algorithm for\nestimating day of ovulation with every-other-day sampling. In this\nmethod, we extrapolate hormone values of E1C (or E1G) and PDG\nfor each missing day by using the mean of the measures on either\nside of the missing day. The Baird algorithm was then applied to the\ndata.\nAccuracy of the Kassam and Baird modified methods for estimat-\ning day of ovulation with intermittent sampling was evaluated using\nthe mean MMGD and the percentage of cases in which the day of ovu-\nlation was estimated within \u00b12 and \u00b14 days of the serum LH peak.\nPrecision was evaluated using the MMGD SD. The 30 ovulatory\ncycles with serum LH and TVU were used for these tests.\nResults\nThe mean and SD of cycle lengths and participant age and BMI\nfor each data set are shown in Table II. The anovulatory and\nindeterminate cycles had wider variation in cycle length than\nthe ovulatory cycles. Age was higher among women with ano-\nvulatory and indeterminate cycles, whereas BMI was higher\nfor ovulatory and indeterminate cycles.\nEstimating presence or absence of ovulation with daily data\nSensitivity, specificity and misclassification rate for each of the\nalgorithms tested for determining the presence or absence of\novulation using daily specimens are shown in Table III. Of\nfour algorithms applied to the 52 classifiable menstrual seg-\nments from the BIMORA study, the Kassam algorithm using\nthe intervals method (Kassam et al., 1996) performed best\noverall in terms of sensitivity (100%), specificity (100%) and\nmisclassification (0%) (Table III). Of the six cycles visually\nclassified as indeterminate (which are not included in the\nresults in Table III), five were classified anovulatory and one\novulatory by the Kassam algorithm. Examples of the steroid\nand gonadotrophin hormone profiles of ovulatory, anovulatory\nand indeterminate cycles are shown in Figure 1. Visually inde-\nterminate cycles lack a clear and sustained rise in PDG and\ntended to be classified as anovulatory by each of the algo-\nrithms. The visually indeterminate cycle in Figure 1C was\nassigned anovulatory status by the Kassam method.\nK.A.O'Connor et al.\nEstimating day of ovulation with daily data\nTable IV presents measures of precision for each of the different\nmarkers: the SD of the mean MMGD, the MMGD mode and the\npercent of cases where a marker falls on or within 1 and 2 days of\nthe MMGD mode. Only cycles where the indicator being tested\nwas present were included in the denominator for calculating per-\ncentage of cases falling on or within 1 and 2 days of the mode;\nabsence of the indicator would otherwise have been treated as a\nmethod failure, unduly lowering the precision estimate.

The\ntiming of the rise was considered consistent enough from woman\nto woman to allow us to take the 3-day lag into account in subse-\nquent analyses using the Kassam method to estimate day of ovula-\ntion. Urinary LH, FSH, Baird DLT and the Waller methods were\nall reasonably accurate (mean MMGDs close to zero) and precise\n(low SDs). Serum E2\nis actually fairly precise (77% of cases fell\non the mode); the MMGD SD (1.82 days) for E2\nprimarily reflects\none case with an 8-day deviation from the serum LH peak.\nThe mean of the mean deviations between day of serum LH\npeak and all other markers in Table IV was 0.71 days (SD =\n0.99). The mean of the mean deviations between day of follicle\ncollapse and all other markers in Table IV was 0.29 days (SD =\n0.97). Follicle collapse is closer in time to the marker events,\nbut not significantly so, indicating that either serum LH peak\nor follicle collapse can be used to represent day of ovulation.\nThe results presented in Tables III and IV guided the con-\nstruction of a combined hierarchical method. In this method,\nthe first step was to evaluate whether or not a cycle was ovula-\ntory. Table III supported the use of the Kassam (Kassam et al.,\nficity). If the Kassam algorithm identified a cycle as ovulatory,\nthe next step was to identify the day of ovulation. The urinary\nLH peak, FSH peak and Baird DLT methods all had similar\nprecision and accuracy. Using precision as a guide, we placed\nthe LH peak first (MMGD SD = 1.14) and the FSH peak\nsecond (MMGD SD=1.30) in the hierarchical algorithm. LH\nand FSH peaks were put ahead of the Baird DLT (MMGD SD\nsometimes unusual ovulation days that can be assigned by the\nBaird DLT algorithm in the hormonally irregular cycles that\ncan occur as a result of reproductive ageing (data not shown).\nThe Baird algorithm worked equally well with both the E1C\nand E1G measures, and either of these can be used in the com-\nbined hierarchical method. The Kassam intervals method, with\ncorrection for the 3-day lag, had lower precision (MMGD SD\n= 1.60) than LH, FSH and the Baird DLT, and thus it was\nplaced last in the hierarchy. Ovulation day using the Kassam\nmethod is identified as 3 days before the first day of 3 consec-\nutive days that the ratio exceeded the threshold value of 3.\nThe combined hierarchical method had, overall, high accu-\n93% of estimates fell within 2 days of the MMGD mode) for\npredicting ovulation day (Table IV). We did not include the\nWaller method in the hierarchical method as it is a more com-\nplicated version of the Baird DLT method and had lower accu-\nracy and precision than the Baird method.\nIntermittent sampling\nTable V summarizes results for six different intermittent sampling\nscenarios for estimating the presence or absence of ovulation.\nTable V.

Misclassification rates were below 10% for methods\nthat had both sensitivities and specificities greater than 90%.\nMost of the algorithms were too sensitive to small PDG\nchanges and therefore had low specificity with every-other-day\nsampling (5\u00ad77%). However, requiring an elevation in PDG of\nthree times the baseline for two consecutive samples improved\nspecificity to 100% for every-other-day samples (using the\nKassam 6 modification, see Tables I and V). Specificity also\nimproved for weekly and twice-weekly sampling with different\nmodifications to the Kassam algorithm, such as raising the\nthreshold ratio from 3 to 4 (using the Kassam 4 and 5 modifica-\ntions, see Tables I and V). Twice per cycle collection had rela-\ntively low sensitivity and specificity (68\u00ad82%) for estimating\nthe presence or absence of ovulation. The Kassam method var-\niations generally had higher sensitivity and specificity and\nlower misclassification rates than the Baird method variations.\nMethods for determining presence or absence of ovulation had\nto be tailored to accommodate the collection scheme: no single\nmethod was identified that could be used to give the best\nresults for all sampling scenarios.\nAccuracy and precision for identifying ovulation day with\nintermittent data is shown in Table VI; only the best performing\n(highest accuracy and precision) algorithms are listed. Precision\n(MMGD SD) ranged from 1.3 to 2.8 days for weekly, twice-\nweekly and every-other-day sampling designs (Table VI).\nAccuracy of estimates of the day of ovulation increased with\nincreased sampling frequency: the MMGD declined from 2.1\nto \u00ad0.2 as sampling frequency increased (Table VI). Twice-\nweekly and every-other-day methods based on modified Kassam\nmethods estimated ovulation day within \u00b14 days in up to 90%\nof cases, but only 63\u00ad77% were estimated within \u00b12 days. In\ncontrast, the Baird et al. modified algorithm for every-other-\nday sampling had high accuracy and precision and estimated\nday of ovulation to within \u00b14 days in up to 100% of cases\n(using E1C in the ratio) and to within \u00b12 days in up to 97% of\ncases (using E1C in the ratio). Weekly sampling with Kassam-\nbased methods estimated ovulation day within \u00b12 days in only\n40\u00ad70% of cases (Table VI). For both twice-weekly and\nweekly sampling, beginning specimen collection on the first\nMonday of a menstrual cycle resulted in higher accuracy and\nprecision than beginning collection on the first day of a men-\nstrual cycle (the first day of menses).\nDiscussion\nThe results of this work provide researchers with information\nfor choosing urinary markers of ovulation that (i) are precise;\n(ii) are well-characterized statistically; (iii) make maximum use\nof available ovulation marker data, even in cases where differ-\nent types of data are missing; (iv) can be applied objectively\nand (v) allow for choice of a research design that balances\nsubject collection burden, project goals and cost with appropri-\nate data for estimation of the presence or absence and day of\novulation.\nThe PDG-based Kassam method, and modifications of it,\nhad high sensitivity and specificity for estimating the presence\nor absence of ovulation in daily and intermittent sampling\nscenarios. The Kassam method had 100% specificity and sen-\nsitivity for determining whether ovulation occurred in a cycle\nwith daily sampling. This method easily accommodated varia-\nbility between subjects in magnitude of the PDG rise and\ncould also be applied with minimal modification to a range\nof sampling schemes. With intermittent sampling schemes,\nincluding every-other-day, twice-weekly and weekly, the Kassam\nmethod modifications had sensitivities and specificities greater\nthan 90% and misclassification rates of 10% or less. Even\ntwice-per-cycle sampling had sensitivity and specificity from\n68 to 82% with the Kassam method. Whereas the Kassam\nmethod proved to be an effective basis, modifications specific\nto each collection scenario had to be made to optimize perform-\nance. This was a result of the need to balance data richness with\nthe strictness of the rules in order to achieve high sensitivity and\nspecificity. For less-frequent sampling, more permissive rules\nwere needed to optimize sensitivity. These rules were too relaxed,\nhowever, and compromised specificity in designs with higher\nsampling frequency. The Baird DLT method had high sensitivity\nbut low specificity for estimating presence or absence of ovulation\nwith most sampling designs, except for weekly sampling, with\nTable VI.

The low\nspecificity for other sampling scenarios was probably a result\nof the method's vulnerability to missing data, and the fact that\nthe Baird DLT method was not originally designed to assess\nthe presence or absence of ovulation, it was designed only for\nestimating day of ovulation (Baird et al., 1991).\nOther methods for estimating the presence or absence of\novulation tend not to be as sensitive or specific as the Kassam\nmethod with daily sampling (Santoro et al., 2003). In our data,\nLH and FSH peak days were specific, but not sensitive,\nwhereas Baird's DLT method was sensitive but not very spe-\ncific. The Kassam method was chosen for estimating the pres-\nence or absence of ovulation in the combined hierarchical\nmethod because of the method's high sensitivity and specific-\nity as well as robustness to missing data.\nAlthough the Kassam method performed quite well with our\ndaily data for estimating presence or absence of ovulation,\nslightly lower sensitivity and specificity were reported in its\noriginal description (Kassam et al., 1996) and elsewhere\nattributable, in part, to our gold standard choice. Whereas\nKassam and colleagues used <2 ng/ml serum progesterone as a\ngold standard of anovulation, taken once per week, and\nMcConnell and colleagues used the urine LH peak as a gold\nstandard of the presence of ovulation, we tested our algorithms\nfor the presence or absence of ovulation against a gold standard\nof visually assessing cycles using measures of four hormones\nfrom daily urine specimens. Although our visual assessment\nincluded E1G, PDG, LH and FSH, the most telling visual indi-\ncator of ovulation was a sustained mid-to-late-cycle rise in\nPDG. Thus, given that the test and gold standards were based\non similar (but not identical) criteria, our estimates of sensitiv-\nity and specificity may be overly optimistic. However, our\nobjective was to effectively capture and standardize the PDG\nrise that is evident visually, even with intermittent sampling,\nusing the Kassam algorithm.\nWe evaluated the performance of algorithms for the pres-\nence or absence of ovulation in a data set that included 25\ncycles from perimenopausal women (out of a total of 58 cycles\nfrom the BIMORA project). Perimenopausal women may have\nhormonally disordered cycles with or without ovulation,\nincluding elevated early follicular phase FSH, lack of LH or\nFSH peaks and hyper- or hypo-estrogenism (Prior, 1998).\nMany of the cycles in our sample showed one or more of these\ncharacteristics (for an example, see Figure 1B). Despite this,\nthe Kassam PDG-based algorithm had nearly perfect sensitiv-\nity and specificity for discriminating ovulatory and non-ovula-\ntory cycles. Our results are in agreement with Santoro and\ncolleagues (Santoro et al., 2003) in finding the Kassam method\nuseful for evaluating not only normal cycles but also the hor-\nmonally irregular cycles encountered in reproductive ageing.\nIn previous work, we found that the Kassam algorithm also\nperformed well in the disrupted cycles sometimes found in\nexercising women (McConnell et al., 2002). We note, how-\never, that the algorithms examined here were designed for use\nin women still experiencing menstrual cycles. It is possible that\nthey may not perform similarly in women who are not cycling\nat all, such as late peri- or post-menopausal women, in whom\nlow-level fluctuations in steroid hormone levels may cause the\nalgorithms to falsely indicate that ovulation has occurred. The\nchances of identifying a PDG rise three times the baseline that\nis associated only with random, low-level fluctuations will\nincrease as interval length increases, as is expected in late peri-\nor post-menopausal women. In these cases, it may be necessary\nto identify a minimum PDG level below which peaks identified\nby the Kassam method are clearly not biologically meaningful.\nAll the indicators we examined for estimating of day of ovu-\nlation were accurate within 1 day of ovulation, except for the\nKassam algorithm which gave an ovulation day 3 days\nremoved, on average, from the gold standard. We were able to\ncorrect for this bias by designating the day of ovulation as 3 days\nprior to the first of 3 consecutive days when the ratio was 3.\nPrecision varied across urinary indicators, ranging from 0.85 to\n5.99 days. The E1G and E1C peaks, despite being accurate to\nwithin 1 day of ovulation, were the least precise indicators and\nwere thus not considered for use in the combined hierarchical\nmethod. The remaining urinary indicators had acceptable pre-\nIn the construction of the combined hierarchical method for\nestimating day of ovulation, we valued precision over accu-\nracy. If a cycle was found ovulatory by the Kassam method,\nthe mid-cycle urine LH peak, if available, was used preferen-\ntially to estimate ovulation day. If the urinary LH peak was not\navailable, then the mid-cycle urine FSH peak was used as the\nday of ovulation. If no LH or FSH peaks were available, then\novulation day was estimated using the Baird DLT method. If\nthe Baird algorithm identified the cycle as anovulatory, or the\novulation day indeterminate, the last step of the hierarchy was\nto define the day of ovulation as 3 days before the first of 3\nconsecutive days on which the Kassam PDG:PDG baseline\nratio was 3. Urinary LH and FSH peaks and the Baird DLT\nalgorithm, though reasonably accurate and precise, are all vul-\nnerable to small amounts of missing data (Baird et al., 1991),\nin contrast to the Kassam method. Thus, the Kassam method is\nan important component of the combined hierarchical method.\nThe combined hierarchical method had excellent accuracy \u00ad\nthe MMGD mean was less than 1 day (0.60 days) \u00ad and excel-\nlent precision \u00ad 93% of estimates of ovulation day in a sample\nof 30 cycles fell on or within 2 days of the MMGD mode, and\nthe MMGD SD was 1.13 days. As an example of how the\nmethod accommodates missing data, when we applied the\nalgorithm to 61 cycles classified as ovulatory (30 confirmed\novulatory by TVU, 30 visually assessed ovulatory and one vis-\nually assessed indeterminate) ovulation day was determined by\nthe urine LH peak in 42 cycles, by the FSH peak in four cycles,\nby Baird DLT in 13 cycles and by the Kassam method in two\ncycles.\nVariants of the Kassam and Baird methods were used to\nestimate the day of ovulation with intermittent data. Other\nmethods were not evaluated given their vulnerability to miss-\ning data. Similarly, the hierarchical combined method was not\ntested for intermittent data, because not all of the indicators in\nthat method were amenable to missing data. Estimation of\novulation day with Kassam-based methods to within \u00b14 days\nof ovulation had 90% accuracy for twice-weekly and every-\nother-day sampling, but accuracy declined to around 70% for\nOvulation detection using urinary hormones\nestimation to within \u00b12 days of ovulation day. The Baird mod-\nified method performed very well with every-other-day sam-\npling, using either E1C or E1G in the ratio: ovulation day was\ncases.\nBeginning specimen collection on the first Monday of a\nmenstrual cycle resulted in higher accuracy and precision than\nbeginning collection on the first day of a menstrual cycle (the\nfirst day of menses) for estimating ovulation day with both\ntwice-weekly and weekly sampling. This is a result of the fact\nthat ovulation is not distributed randomly across the menstrual\ncycle and tends to cluster between cycle days 8\u00ad15 (Wilcox\net al., 2000). The day of ovulation (day of serum LH peak) in\nthe 30 cycles for which we had TVU clustered around days 13\u00ad14\nof the menstrual cycle: the mean ovulation day was cycle\nday 14.3, the mode was cycle day 13, the median was cycle\nday 14 and the range spanned cycle days 7\u00ad25. Because ovula-\ntion day clustered so tightly around cycle days 13\u00ad14, and\nthese cycle days fell between collection days, beginning collec-\ntion on the first day of menses missed ovulation day in a sub-\nstantial proportion of our data set in the twice-weekly and\nweekly sampling designs. In contrast, beginning collection on\nthe first Monday of a cycle increased the probability of collec-\ntion days coinciding with cycle days 13 and 14. We conclude\nthat intermittent collection schemes for weekly and twice-\nweekly collection should avoid beginning specimen collection\non the first day of menses.\nA limitation of the work here is that the methods were evalu-\nated on relatively small data sets \u00ad 30 ovulatory cycles with\nserum, urine and TVU data and 58 visually assessed anovulatory\nand ovulatory BIMORA cycles. Our estimates of sensitivity,\nspecificity, precision and accuracy may not be representative of\nhow the markers might perform in other data sets. In particular,\nour data might reflect a limited range of variance across women\nfor the estimates of precision. It is not possible to compare our\nestimates of accuracy with other studies, as each study used dif-\nferent gold standards: we used the serum LH peak, Baird and\ncolleagues and Royston used the urinary LH peak (Royston,\ncolleages used follicle collapse (Ecochard et al., 2001; Li et al.,\n2002) and Santoro and colleagues used visual assessment of\nevidence of luteal activity (Santoro et al., 2003) as gold stan-\ndards for estimating accuracy. A second and related limitation is\nthat our estimates of precision, accuracy, sensitivity and speci-\nficity for methods that we modified or created are likely to be\nbiased by the fact that we are reporting statistical performance\nfor indicators using the data set which was used to develop or\nmodify the indicators. Thus, it is possible that the indicators dis-\ncussed here may not perform as well in other data sets.\nThe methods outlined here were developed for objective and\nautomated identification of the presence and timing of ovula-\ntion. The results suggest that a combined hierarchical method\nhas several advantages for daily samples: it has excellent sensi-\ntivity and specificity for estimating presence of ovulation; it\nhas high accuracy and precision for estimating ovulation day\nand it is robust to missing data, thereby maximizing use of a\ndata set. We found that the presence or absence of ovulation\ncan be estimated with PDG-based methods with good sensitiv-\nity and specificity in intermittent sampling designs. In particu-\nlar, every-other-day, twice-weekly and weekly specimens\nperform well. These results should be useful for reducing sub-\nject burden and project cost in studies in which the outcome\nmeasure is presence or absence of ovulation. Most intermittent\nsampling designs are less useful for estimating day of ovula-\ntion; for the best accuracy and precision, every-other-day (with\nthe modified Baird method) or daily sampling is necessary.\n"
