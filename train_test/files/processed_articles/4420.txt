Icariside II is a flavonoid from Epimedium koreanum Nakai with remarkable anticancer properties,\nbut poor solubility and significant efflux from cancer cells limited its clinical use. In our previous study, a self-assembled\nmixture of micelles (TPGS\u00adIcariside II\u00adphospholipid complex) was successfully constructed, which could substantially\nincrease the solubility of Icariside II and inhibit the efflux on Caco-2 cells. In this study, we evaluate the anticancer effect\nof the mixed micelles encapsulating Icariside II (Icar-MC) on MCF-7/ADR, a multidrug-resistant breast cancer cell line.\nThe cellular uptake of the micelles was confirmed by fluorescent coumarin-6-loaded micelles. The IC\nof Icar-MC in\nMCF-7/ADR was 2-fold less than the free drug. The in vitro study showed Icar-MC induced more apoptosis and lactate\ndehydrogenase release. Intravenous injection of Icar-MC into nude mice bearing MCF-7/ADR xenograft resulted in a\nbetter antitumor efficacy compared with the administration of free drug, without causing significant body weight changes\nin mice. The antitumor effect was further verified by magnetic resonance imaging and immunohistochemical assays for Ki-\n67, a proliferative indicator. Moreover, Icar-MC treatment also elevated Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and the expressions of cleaved\ncaspase-3, -8, -9 and AIFM1 in tumors. This study suggests that phospholipid/TPGS mixed micelles might be a suitable drug\ndelivery system for Icariside II to treat multidrug resistant breast cancer.\n",

Furthermore, the significant efflux from cancer cells\nalso limits its clinical application.\nSelf-assembled micelle system is recognized as one of\nthe most promising strategies to deliver poorly soluble anti-\ncancer drugs.3-5 In our previous study, a self-assembled\nmixture of micelles (TPGS\u00adIcariside II\u00adphospholipid com-\nplex) was constructed using phospholipid complex and\nTPGS (d--tocopheryl polyetheyene glycol 1000 succi-\nnate), which was capable of inhibiting the efflux and\nimproving the solubility of Icariside II.6 As an important\ncomponent of the cell membrane, phospholipids can sustain\nmembrane fluidity. They represent a well-known class of\nbiocompatibleandnoncytotoxicbiomolecules.Phospholipid\ncomplexes have been successfully applied to improve the\npermeability and bioavailability of drugs, such as clarithro-\nmycin and curcumin.7,8 TPGS, containing a lipophilic non-\npolar head and a hydrophilic tail, would be an ideal\nsolubilizer to provide high drug encapsulation and emulsifi-\ncation efficiency for lipid-based drug delivery formula-\ntions.9 Moreover, TPGS could reverse multidrug resistance\n(MDR) by inhibiting the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) pump.10,11\n1School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing,\nChina\n2Jiangsu Provincial Academy of Chinese Medicine, Shizi Street, Jiangsu,\nNanjing, China.\nCorresponding Author:\nXiaobin Jia and Zhenhai Zhang, Key Laboratory of Delivery Systems\nof Chinese Meteria Medica, Jiangsu Provincial Academy of Chinese\nTPGS/Phospholipids Mixed Micelles for\nDelivery of Icariside II to Multidrug-Resistant\nBreast Cancer\nJie Song, MSc1,2, Houcai Huang, MSc2, Zhi Xia, BSc2, Yingjie Wei, PhD2,\nNan Yao, MSc2, Li Zhang, MSc2, Hongmei Yan, PhD2, Xiaobin Jia, PhD2,\nand Zhenhai Zhang, PhD2\n Keywords\nmicelles, multidrug resistance, Icariside II, MCF-7/ADR, P-glycoprotein\nAll these characteristics make them qualified surfactants to\novercome drug efflux.12 Breast cancer continues to be the\nmost common malignancy diagnosed in women world-\nwide.13 MDR is considered as one of the main reasons for\nthe failure of cancer chemotherapy.14 The principal mecha-\nnism of MDR is drug efflux from cancer cells by overex-\nWe assumed that phospholipid-TPGS micelles might be\na promising platform for improving the therapeutic efficacy\nof Icariside II in drug-resistant cells. In this work, the in\nvitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy of Icar-MC against\nMDR breast cancer cells was estimated.\nMaterials and Methods\nCell Culture and Reagents\nThe human breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and MCF-7/\nADR (an ADR-resistant breast cancer cell line) were pur-\nchased from American Type Culture Collection and main-\nmM l-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (50 IU/mL\nand 50 \u00b5g/mL, respectively) at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of\n. Icariside II was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide\n(DMSO) for in vitro experiments and was suspended in\nphosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.2% sodium car-\nboxymethylcellulose (CMC-Na) for in vivo experiments.\nCoumarin-6, Icariside II and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylin-\ndole (DAPI) was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).\nIcariside II-phospholipid complex was prepared by an\nanhydrous cosolvent reduction vaporization method as pre-\nviously described.6 All other chemicals were of high-\nperformance liquid chromatography or reagent grade and\nused without further purification.\nUptake of Calcein-AM in MCF-7/ADR Cells\nP-gp activity in the MCF-7 or MCF-7/ADR cells was\nfirstly examined with the Multidrug Resistance Assay Kit\n(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), which evaluates the mean\nfluorescence of calcein AM accumulated in cells.16 Cells\nwere preincubated with increasing concentrations of cyclo-\n(Calcein-AM, 0.3 M) were added and cells were further\nincubated for 30 minutes. At the end of incubation, intracel-\nlular fluorescence of P-gp substrates was quantified by a\nmicroplate reader (Bio-Rad iMark, Richmond, CA) at 488\nnm. We further examined the P-gp activity in TPGS- or\nempty micelles-treated MCF-7/ADR cells. Calcein AM (0.3\nM) was added to the culture medium after cells had been\nincubated with TPGS (0.18 mg/mL) or empty micelles (0.2\nmg/mL) for 15 minutes. Coincubation lasted for another 15\nminutes. The fluorescence was measured using a microplate\nreader.\nCellular Uptake of the Coumarin-6-Loaded\nMicelles\nFluorescent coumarin-6-loaded micelle has been a success-\nful model to investigate the cellular uptake of micelles.17-19\nCoumarin-6-loaded micelles were prepared by replacing\nIcariside II with coumarin-6 in the process of constructing\nIcar-MC. After treatment with coumarin-6-loaded micelles\n(6 \u00b5M) for 30 minutes, the cells were washed with PBS and\nthen the nuclei were counterstained by DAPI for 10 min.\nThe cells were washed again for fluorescence imaging.\nIn Vitro Cytotoxicity Study\nIn vitro cytotoxicity was determined using MTT assay.\nMCF-7/ADR cells (2 \u00d7 104/well) were treated with free\nIcariside II, Icar-MC (0-40 \u00b5M) or empty micelles (0.2 mg/\n570 nm was used to assess the relative cell viability from 3\nindependent experiments.\nLactate Dehydrogenase Release\nThe MCF-7/ADR cells (1 \u00d7 106 cells/mL) were treated with\nIcar-MC or Icariside II at a concentration range of 0 to 40\n\u00b5M for 12 hours. Released lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in\nthe media was measured with a cytotoxicity kit (Promega,\nMadison, WI) with absorbance at 340 nm.\nAnalysis of Cell Apoptosis\nAfter incubation with Icar-MC or Icariside II (25 \u00b5M) for\nwashed with cold binding buffer, and suspended in Annexin\nin darkness. The cells were diluted with binding buffer at a\ntotal volume of 400 \u00b5L and analyzed immediately by flow\ncytometry. Cells in the lower right quadrant represented\napoptosis and in the upper right quadrant represented necro-\nsis or postapoptotic necrosis.\nEfficacy Study in Xenografts in Mice\nAthymic nude mice (18-20 g) were obtained from the SLAC\nLabAnimal Center of Shanghai (Shanghai, China). They were\nmaintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle at the temperature of\nlibitum. This study and the experimental protocols were\napproved by the InstitutionalAnimal Care and Use Committee\n(IACUC) of Jiangsu ProvincialAcademy of Chinese Medicine\nMCF-7/ADR cells were injected subcutaneously into the\nflank area of female nude mice. On day 0 (5 days after cell\nimplantation), tumor sizes reached an average of 75 mm3,\nand mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 8):\ngroup 1 (saline); group 2 (free Icariside II at 10 mg/kg, in\nmg/kg, in PBS, pH 7.4); and group 4 (Icar-MC, containing\nthe same dose of Icariside II as group 2, in PBS, pH 7.4).\nTreatments via intravenous injections or oral gavage began\non day 1. Mice in groups 1 and 2 were dosed through oral\ngavage every 3 days for a total of 8 times (finished on day\n24). Mice in groups 3 and 4 were injected intravenously\nevery 3 days for a total of 8 injections (finished on day 24).\nTumors were measured thrice a week with an electronic\ncaliper by using the formula: Tumor volume (mm3) = length\nafter the last treatment (day 24), and all the mice left were\neuthanized. During the experiment, mice with tumor size\nexceeding 1000 mm3 were also euthanized. Tumors were\nisolated immediately for further Western blotting and\nimmunohistochemical assays after euthanasia.\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\nThe nude mice were subjected to magnetic resonance imag-\ning (MRI) (Excite Echospeed HD 1.5T, GE MRI system,\nWaukesha, WI) on day 34.20 Coronal position, transverse\nsection (T1WI, T2WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging\nand a slice thickness of 3 mm, interval 0.2 mm, field of\nWestern Blot Analysis\nThe protein levels in tissue homogenates were assessed with\nthe use of methods described previously.21 After the indi-\ncated treatment, tissue homogenates were lysed in extract\nbuffer. Equal amounts of proteins from each set of experi-\nments were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate\u00adpolyacryl-\namide gel electrophoresis. The gel was transferred to\nmembrane and probed with either P-gp, Bax, caspase-3, -8,\n-9, PARP, FADD, AIFM1, Bcl-2 antibodies, each obtained\nfrom Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). The pro-\ntein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence\ndetection kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Densitometric\nmeasurements of the scanned bands were performed using\nImage pro plus (IPP) software program. Data were normal-\nized to -actin.\nImmunohistochemical Studies\nSections (5 m) from paraformaldehyde-fixed tissues\nwere dewaxed with xylene and ethanol and then washed in\ndistilled water. After incubating in hydrogen peroxide to\nquench endogenous peroxidase activity, the slides were\nheated at 100\u00b0C to retrieve antigens. The slides were incu-\nbated with anti-Ki-67 antibody from Nanjing Bioworld\nBiotech Co Ltd. (Nanjing, China) for 1 hour, followed by\nincubation with horseradish peroxidase\u00adconjugated sec-\nondary antibody. Sections were then incubated with devel-\noping solution, and counterstained with hematoxylin.\nColor was fixed with acid alcohol and dehydration steps.\nImmunoreactivity was identified as brown nuclear or\ncytoplasmic labeling in tumors counterstained with\nhematoxylin.\nStatistical Methods\nThe experiments exposed were representative from three\nindependent experiments. All descriptive statistics, includ-\ning mean \u00b1 SD, were performed. Student's t test was used to\nevaluate differences between the control group and each\ntreatment group in all in vitro studies. For multigroup com-\nparisons, a 2-way analysis of variance test was used. To\ncompare animal survivals, the log-rank test was used and\nthe results were shown with Kaplan-Meier curves.\nResults\nP-glycoprotein Activities in MCF-7/ADR Cells\nCalcein AM was used as a substrate to evaluate the activity\nof P-gp in the presence of increasing concentration of cyclo-\nsporinA(a competitive inhibitor of P-gp). Previous research\nreported that cyclosporin A displayed dose-dependent inhi-\nbition of P-gp-mediated calcein AM efflux.22 Therefore,\ngreater retention of calcein AM means greater inhibitory\neffects on the P-gp activity. As shown in Figure 1A, high\nconcentration of cyclosporin A induced retention of calcein\nin MCF-7/ADR cells but not in MCF-7 cells, signifying that\nP-gp was much more active in MCF-7/ADR cells. Moreover,\nhigh level of P-gp proteins was detected in MCF-7/ADR\ncells, as shown in Western blot assays (Figure 1B).\nWe further examined the P-gp activity in TPGS- or\nempty micelles-treated MCF-7/ADR cells. Characterization\nof Icar-MC has been carried out in our previous research,\ndemonstrating that this formulation was able to increase the\nsolubility and the permeability of Icariside II. New experi-\nmental data from batches in this study are shown in Table 1.\nThe weight ratio of TPGS:empty micelle was 9:10 when\nconstructing Icariside II-loaded mixed micelles. The rela-\ntive fluorescence value for retention of calcein AM was\n(0.2 mg/mL). It is obvious that TPGS or empty micelles\nwould increase calcein AM retention in MCF-7/ADR cells\n(Figure 1C). However, both treatments failed to affect P-gp\nprotein levels in MCF-7/ADR cells (Figure 1D).\nIn Vitro Cellular Uptake\nAfter incubation with the coumarin-6-loaded TPGS micelles\nfor 30 minutes, images of MCF-7/ADR cells are shown in\nFigure 1E. The green fluorescence is emitted by coumarin-6\nand the blue fluorescence is obtained from the DAPI chan-\nnel. From the images, DAPI-stained nuclei are circumvented\nby green fluorescence. This proves that micelles have\nentered into the cellular cytoplasm.\nIn Vitro Cytotoxicity\nThe in vitro cytotoxicity of free Icariside II and Icariside\nII-loaded mixed micelles in MCF-7/ADR cells was examined\nFigure 1. Activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and cellular uptake of micelles. (A) P-gp activity was determined by retention of calcein\nAM in the multidrug resistance assay. (B) P-gp protein expression was determined by Western blotting. (C) P-gp activity after\ntreatment with TPGS (0.18 mg/mL) or empty micelles (0.2 mg/mL) by detecting cellular accumulation of calcein AM in MCF-7/\nADR cells. Greater numbers suggest greater inhibitory effects on the P-gp activity (*P < .05, **P < .01 vs control). (D) P-gp protein\nexpression was determined by Western blotting.

The result indicates that Icar-MC has advan-\ntages in achieving higher cytotoxicity than the free drug. The\nIC\nfound to be 2-fold less than the free Icariside II (25.2 \u00b1 0.7\n\u00b5M) (P < .01) after 24-hour incubation. The IC\nof Icar-MC\n\u00b5M) (P < .05) after 48-hour incubation (Figure 2A). The cyto-\ntoxicity of empty micelles was evaluated on MCF-7/ADR to\ndiscriminate the effect of Icar-MC from empty micelles. Our\nresults confirmed that the empty micelles at 0.2 mg/mL are\nnoncytotoxic to MCF-7/ADR cells. The P-gp inhibiting effect\nby the TPGS makes these micelles a better nanocarrier for\nIcariside II delivery. It allows sustaining the drug concentra-\ntion inside the cell, resulting in a more potent cytotoxic effect.\nIcar-MC-treated cells had higher level of LDH release com-\npared to free Icariside II at all concentrations (0-40 \u00b5M)\n(Figure 2B). Statistical analysis showed that the difference in\nLDH release between Icariside II and Icar-MC was significant\nat 20 and 40 \u00b5M. In accordance with MTT assay, Icar-MC\ntreatment resulted in higher apoptotic cells than Icariside II\n(Figure 2C). This experiment was repeated three times, and\nthe difference is statistically significant (P < .05).\nAssessment of In Vivo Therapeutic Efficacy\nThe tumor volumes of MCF-7/ADR xenograft and weights\nof nude mice were measured thrice a week. The tumor vol-\nume kept increasing in the mice treated with saline (Figure 3,\nTable 2). On day 24 (the last treatment), 5 out of the 8 mice\nwith tumors exceeding the size limit of 1000 mm3 were euth-\nanized. The rest of the mice in the saline group were eutha-\nnized successively once the tumors reached the size limit.\nEmpty micelles (200 mg/kg) exhibited no tumor inhibition\non nude mice. On day 25, one death occurred in the empty\nmicelles group due to tumor burden. None of the animals in\nthis group survived to the end of the study (day 34, 10 days\nafter they were given the last treatment).\nIcariside II is almost insoluble in aqueous solutions;\ntherefore, it was orally given in PBS with 0.2% CMC-Na at\npH 7.4. Free Icariside II (10 mg/kg) exhibited weak inhibi-\ntion on tumor growth, without statistical significance com-\npared to the saline group. In the Icariside II group, three\nmice received euthanasia successively due to exceeding the\ntumor size limit. Five mice survived to the end of the study\nin the Icariside II group (day 34).\nStrong suppression of tumor volume was observed in\nanimals receiving Icar-MC (10 mg/kg of Icariside II basis),\ncompared to the saline group (P < .05). At the end of the\nstudy, the mean tumor size was 285 mm3 from an initial\naverage volume of 75 mm3. Two out of the 8 mice had obvi-\nous tumor regression. There is a statistical significance\nbetween free Icariside II and Icariside II-loaded micelles (P\n< .05). MRI analysis of the mice harvested at the end of the\nexperiment demonstrated that the tumor volumes differed\nsignificantly between the Icariside II and Icar-MC groups\n(Figure 3C).\nTo estimate the adverse effects of the mixed micelle for-\nmulations, body weight of the mice was also recorded dur-\ning the treatment and the results are shown in Figure 3D. It\ncan be easily observed that the average body weight of the\nmice in all groups showed similar trends: slow increase in\nthe initial 7 days, quick increase between 8 and 12 days, and\nunchanged afterward.\nImmunohistochemical Assays\nWe carried out immunohistochemistry assay in tumors to\nexamine the cell proliferation indicator Ki-67. As expected,\nKi-67-positivecellsweredecreasedinIcar-MC-treatedtumors,\nindicating the reduction of proliferated cells (Figure 4). These\nfindings strengthened the conclusion that Icar-MC had greater\ntherapeutic efficacy than Icariside II alone.\nExpressions of Apoptosis-Related Proteins\nWe then investigated the molecular mechanisms responsi-\nble for the antitumor effect of Icar-MC. -actin is not a good\nloading control when apoptosis is induced. We used Hsc70\nas the loading control which was less sensitive to caspase\ncleavage. Icar-MC enhanced the levels of Bax, cleaved cas-\npase-8, -9, -3, cleaved PARP, and AIFM1 compared with\nvehicle; decreased the expressions of Bcl-2 in tumor tissues\n(Figure 5). Icar-MC induced apoptosis involving both the\nintrinsic and extrinsic signaling pathways. Free Icariside II\nalso displayed a tendency to modulate the expressions of\napoptosis-related proteins, but to a lesser extent. Thus,\nmixed micelles made of TPGS and phospholipid complexes\nallowed for a strong pro-apoptotic effect of Icariside II.\nDiscussion\nThis study was designed to investigate whether self-\nassembled micelles can enhance Icariside II absorption\nand overcome MDR. We have shown several important\nTable 1.

TPGS can pre-\nvent P-gp-mediated efflux and elevate drug bioavailability.\nFurthermore, TPGS has been used as a sole excipient and a\nbrilliant emulsifier to reverse paclitaxel drug resistance in\novarian cancer cells.26,27 Also, TPGS itself has cancer-fight-\ning properties, though the mechanism is unclear. In light of\nthese findings, TPGS is incorporated into Icariside II\u00ad\nphospholipid complex to produce the mixture of micelles.\nIn this study, the mixed micelles successfully reduced the\nefflux of Icariside II in Caco-2 cell monolayers.6 TPGS\nupregulated calcein AM retention level in MCF-7/ADR\nFigure 3.

Calcein AM was\nused as a substrate to evaluate P-gp activity. Greater reten-\ntion of calcein AM means greater inhibitory effects on the\nP-gp activity. Here, it can be inferred that mixed micelles\ninhibited the P-gp activity directly rather than modulating\nP-gp protein expressions.\nAs expected, data obtained from in vitro MTT study\nshowed that Icar-MC exhibited stronger inhibitory effect on\nthe proliferation of MCF-7/ADR cells than Icariside II.\nAlso in this work, the progressive changes of the tumor vol-\nume in the MCF-7/ADR xenografted nude mice confirmed\nthe higher antitumor activity of Icar-MC as compared to\nfree drug at a comparable dosage of Icariside II. Namely,\nthe behavior of Icar-MC in vivo correlated well with their in\nvitro interaction with tumor cells. As a tumor-fighting drug,\nthe cellular uptake of Icariside II is a predominant process\nfor its therapeutic efficacy. Previous research has empha-\nsized that the addition of the TPGS into polymeric nanopar-\nticles can increase the cellular uptake in tumor.28 In vitro\ncellular uptake results obtained here also confirmed this.\nThis formulation promoted intracellular accumulation of\nIcariside II in cells, which could explain the improvement\nof the anticancer efficiency in vitro and in vivo.\nIn the in vivo experiment, free drug is applied orally and\nthe mixed micelle intravenously.

The average value of C\nmax\nafter oral administration of free drug, while the average\nvalue of C\nmax\ntion of Icar-MC.6 Here, we concluded that except for the\nmore significant uptake of Icar-MC over Icariside II by can-\ncer cells and overcoming drug resistance, the improved\nplasma concentration of Icariside II might also contribute to\nthe difference in anticancer efficacies. Moreover, the in\nvivo activity of Icariside II-loaded micelles may also be\nimproved by their augmented accumulation in tumor tissues\ndue to the enhanced permeability and retention effect. The\ntissue concentration of free Icariside II and Icar-MC should\nbe evaluated in our future study to elucidate the effect of\nenhanced tumor accumulation.\nIn conclusion, this study has identified a novel drug\ndelivery system, self-assembled micelle for encapsulation\nand delivery of Icariside II in P-gp-mediated drug-resis-\ntant cancers. The study provides a rationale for the contin-\nued investigation of Icar-MC as a promising anticancer\ntherapy.\nFigure 4. Antitumor effect of Icar-MC in nude mice.
