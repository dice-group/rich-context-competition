The purpose of this study was to determine whether moderate CKD is associated\nwith cognitive performance among young, healthy, ethnically diverse adults. Three computerized cog-\nnitive function tests of visual-motor reaction time (Simple Reaction Time), visual attention (Symbol Digit\nSubstitution), and learning/concentration (Serial Digit Learning) were administered to a random sample\nof participants, aged 20 to 59 yr, who completed initial interviews and medical examination in the Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Participants for this study (n  4849)\ncompleted at least one cognitive function test. GFR was estimated using the Modification of Diet in\nRenal Disease (MDRD) equation. Moderate CKD was defined as estimated GFR (eGFR) 30 to 59 ml/min\nper 1.73 m2. Unadjusted, residual-adjusted, and multivariate-adjusted logistic regression models were\nmoderate CKD. Models were adjusted for residual effects of age, gender, race, diabetes, and other\nknown potential confounders. In multivariate models, moderate CKD was not significantly associated\nwith reaction time but was significantly associated with poorer learning/concentration (odds ratio 2.41;\ninterval 1.01 to 7.40). In summary, among those in a large nationally representative sample of healthy,\nwas significantly associated with poorer performance in visual attention and learning/concentration.\nHigh rates of cognitive impairment and dementia\nhave been reported in many but not all studies of\npatients with ESRD.1\u00ad7 Factors that may contribute\nto cognitive impairment in those with ESRD in-\nclude a high prevalence of traditional cardiovascu-\nlar risk factors that cause subclinical damage and\nuremia and its associated metabolic disturbances.8\nIncreased risk for stroke9 and carotid atherosclero-\nsis10,11 among those with ESRD may also predispose\nthem to cognitive impairment.\nMany of the same factors that are proposed as\ncontributors to cognitive impairment in patients\nwith ESRD are also observed, although to a lesser\ndegree, in patients with moderate kidney impair-\nment.12\u00ad14 Furthermore, several recent studies have\nreported an association between both dementia and\ncognitive impairment and moderate kidney dys-\nevated serum creatinine to be associated with in-\nPublished online ahead of print.

Those with moderate CKD were less\nlikely to be black and consume one or more alcoholic drinks\nper week. There were no significant differences in comorbid\nconditions, education, or cardiovascular disease between the\neGFR groups (Table 1).\nUnadjusted mean cognitive function test scores by eGFR\ncategory are presented in Table 2. All three cognitive test scores\nshowed significantly poorer performance (longer reaction\ntime/more errors) for those with moderate CKD.\nModerate Kidney Impairment and Cognitive Function\nScores on each of the three cognitive function variables were\nnot normally distributed. No transformation made it possible\nto satisfy the normality assumption for linear regression; there-\nfore, cognitive function variables were categorized into quar-\ntiles.

Furthermore, these associations were independent\nof the residual effects of age, race, gender, diabetes, and other\nfactors that are known to confound the association between\nCKD and cognitive function.\nPrevious studies of cognitive impairment and kidney dis-\ncohorts in previous studies were elderly, had ESRD, and lacked\nethnic diversity, any direct comparison should be made with\ncaution.\nSimilar to the null findings reported here on the SRTT, the\nTable 4. eGFR and cognitive function by SDSTa\nParameter Unadjusted OR (95% CI), P Residual Adjusted OR (95% CI), P Full Model OR (95% CI), P\naOR for scoring in the abnormal (fourth) quartile of the SDST (3.16 seconds) compared with lower three quartiles (1.38 to 3.15 seconds).\nTable 5. eGFR and cognitive function by SDLTa\nParameter Unadjusted OR (95% CI), P Residual Adjusted OR (95% CI), P Full Model OR (95% CI), P\naOR for scoring in the abnormal (fourth) quartile of the SDLT (10 errors committed) compared with lower three quartiles (zero to nine errors committed).\nNational Cooperative Dialysis Study (NCDS) also reported no\nsignificant differences on the Choice Reaction Time test (a\nmeasure of psychomotor speed). The NCDS randomly as-\nsigned hemodialysis patients to either a low or high BUN target\nlevel with either long or short dialysis time. Cognitive function\nwas examined as part of the study. No differences in reaction\ntime between those with high or low BUN levels were found,\nalthough electroencephalogram abnormalities were noted in\nthe high BUN group.19\nAlso similar to findings reported here, Seliger et al.15 found\nmoderate kidney insufficiency, defined as an elevated serum\ncreatinine, to be associated with a 37% increased risk for de-\nmentia among community-dwelling individuals who were 65\nyr and older and participating in the Cardiovascular Health\nCognition Study. In the same study, kidney function analyzed\nas a continuous variable was associated with a 26% increased\nrisk for dementia.\nIn a cross-sectional study of primarily white postmeno-\npausal women who had established coronary artery disease and\nparticipated in the Heart Estrogen/Progestin Study, Kurella et\nal.16 found low eGFR significantly associated with impaired\nglobal cognitive function, executive function, language, and\nmemory. The association was independent of residual effects\nof age and race and other confounding variables.\nAlso consistent with results reported here, Kurella et al.17\nwith cognitive impairment in a cohort of Medicare-eligible\nindividuals who participated in the Health, Aging and Body\nComposition Study. The risk for cognitive impairment was\ngreater for those with lower eGFR.\nBiologic mechanisms for the observed association between\nmoderate kidney impairment and cognitive function cannot\nbe determined by this study and are likely multifactorial. Tra-\nditional vascular risk factors that are associated with cognitive\nimpairment in the general population, such as age, hyperten-\nsion, diabetes, and dyslipidemia,20\u00ad22 are often more prevalent\namongthosewithCKD.Theseriskfactorsforstrokemayaccount\nfor decreased cognitive function through subclinical damage to\nthe central nervous system (CNS). Results presented here, how-\never, suggest that cognitive impairment was independent of these\nfactors in an otherwise healthy adult population.\nAnother explanation for the association between kidney\nand cognitive dysfunction is the accumulation of solutes. This\nexplanation would suggest a potentially reversible cause, mak-\ning this explanation tantalizing. A recent small study of pa-\ntients who were on nocturnal hemodialysis revealed improve-\nments in cognitive function after initiation of nocturnal\ndialysis, suggesting a reversible cause to the impaired cognitive\nfunction.23 Other studies suggested that elevated plasma ho-\nmocysteine levels may also be a potential vascular risk factor\nfor dementia and cardiovascular disease in the general popu-\nlation.24\u00ad27 Elevated homocysteine is present in 85% of dialysis\npatients8 and also common among those with moderate\nCKD.28 Increased oxidative stress and cognitive impairment\nhave been seen in the general population26 and are also associ-\nThis study has a number of limitations. Because only\nthree cognitive function tests were administered as part of\nNHANES III, this study cannot provide a comprehensive\ncognitive assessment of moderate kidney impairment and\ncognitive function across the full range of cognitive func-\ntion. One of the three cognitive tests in this study (SRTT)\ndid not have consistent results with the other two tests.\nHowever, the null findings were consistent with those of\nother investigators, suggesting that the difference with the\nother tests may be related to the distinct cognitive domain\nassessed by the SRTT that might not be related to kidney\nimpairment. Direct comparison with other tests of cogni-\ntive function is also not possible. Another limitation is that\nthere was an overall test nonresponse rate of 9%. Nonre-\nsponse rates increased with age, decreased with educational\nlevel, were higher for men, and were lower for non-Hispanic\nwhite individual than other ethnic groups.29 Although it is\nimpossible to determine whether eGFR status had any in-\nfluence on nonresponse, it is possible that nonresponse\nrates may have introduced some bias into the study.\nMost known correlates of kidney impairment were ad-\njusted for in these analyses. However, other confounders,\nsuch as vascular disease, which we could not adjust for in\nthese analyses, might also explain these results. Plasma ho-\nmocysteine was measured on a small subset of the NHANES\nIII cohort during the second laboratory examination and\ntherefore not suitable for inclusion in this analysis. In addi-\ntion, parathyroid hormone levels, often elevated in those\nwith CKD, were not measured in NHANES III and could\nnot be adjusted for in these analyses. Furthermore, although\nthis study found an association between cognitive function\nand moderate CKD, the cross-sectional nature of the study\nmakes it impossible to suggest any inferences as to the cause\nof the observed findings.\nThere was a relatively small number (0.8%) with CKD in\nthis younger, relatively healthy sample, which limited the abil-\nity to perform subgroup analyses. The small number of indi-\nviduals with moderate CKD made it impossible to stratify by\nNational Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Qual-\nity Initiative (KDOQI)-defined eGFR categories to assess\nwhether there was a threshold effect. Also, caution should be\ntaken when assuming a relationship between moderate CKD\nand cognition because of the low prevalence of CKD. None-\ntheless, even with the low prevalence of CKD, the statistical\nsignificance at an  of 0.05 was observed.\nDespite the limitations, our study has several strengths.\nThey include the large, nationally representative, educationally\nand ethnically diverse sample of healthy 20- to 59-yr-olds. The\nextensive laboratory data and extensive medical history data\ncollected using standardized methods of NHANES III allowed\nus to adjust for potential confounders.\nwww.jasn.org\nCONCLUSION\nModerate CKD, as reflected by an eGFR 30 to 59 ml/min per\n1.73 m2, was significantly associated with poorer performance\nin visual attention, learning, and concentration in a large, na-\ntionally representative sample of healthy, ethnically diverse 20-\nto 59-yr-olds. These findings provide an important extension\nto the existing literature on older adults with CKD, and adults\nwith ESRD and may provide important insights into the early\ndevelopment of cognitive impairment that predate comorbid\nconditions that are prevalent in the elderly and those with\nmore advanced kidney disease.\nParticipants\nNHANES III was conducted at 89 survey locations between 1988 and\n1994 by the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention. This national survey of the civilian,\nnoninstitutionalized US population aged 2 mo and older used a com-\nplex, stratified, multistage probability design with oversampling\namong individuals who were 60 yr of age, non-Hispanic black, and\nMexican American to enhance the precision among these groups. The\nsurvey was designed to obtain nationally representative information\non the health and nutritional status of the US population by means of\ninterview and physical examination.30,31 CNS (cognitive) function\nevaluation was administered to a random half-sample of NHANES III\nexaminees who were aged 20 to 59 yr and participated in the mobile\ncomponent of the NHANES III examination (n  5662). Cognitive\ntests were systematically administered to those with odd-numbered\nsurvey identification numbers. Cognitive testing was not adminis-\ntered to those who could not speak English or Spanish or to those who\nwere legally blind.29\nCognitive Function Testing and Definition of\nOutcomes\nThree computerized tests were administered to evaluate cognitive\nfunctioning. The tests were components of the Neurobehavioral Eval-\nuation System 2, a system of neurobehavioral tests that were developed\nby Baker and Letz32,33 and are used in epidemiologic studies. Trained\ntechnicians administered all cognitive tests using a standardized pro-\ntocol in both English and Spanish. Each test was preceded by a prac-\ntice phase.\nThe SRTT is a measure of visual-motor speed, or response time,\nmeasured in milliseconds. Participants were instructed to press a but-\nton as quickly as possible when a solid square appeared in the center of\na blank computer screen. A total of 50 trials were administered. The\nSRTT was scored as the average reaction time, excluding the first 10\ntrials. NHANES III has determined a reaction time 750 or 50\nmilliseconds to be invalid. Furthermore, individuals with mean scores\nrepresenting 20 trials are considered invalid by NHANES III.29,34\nThe SDST is a test of coding ability and visual attention. A set of\nnine symbols is matched to the digits one through nine. The partici-\npant is shown a series of symbols and must match the symbol with the\ncorrect corresponding digit as quickly as possible. A total of four trials\nwere conducted with a different pairing of digits and symbols. The\nSDST was scored as the average total time, in seconds (s), for comple-\nThe SDLT is a test of learning recall and concentration. Partici-\npants were presented with a series of digits displayed on a computer\nscreen, one at a time, for 6 seconds, with a 6-second interval between\ndigits. Once all digits were displayed, participants were required to\nenter the entire sequence on the keyboard in the order in which they\nwere presented. Testing stopped when participants responded cor-\nrectly on two consecutive trials or after a total of eight trials. The SDLT\nwas scored as the sum of the errors committed during the trials.29,32\u00ad34\nEstimation of Kidney Function\nGFR, an estimate of kidney function was estimated (eGFR) using the\nModification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula, which is\nbased on baseline age, gender, race, and serum creatinine concentra-\ntion.35 Serum creatinine measurements were calibrated to the Cleve-\nland Clinic laboratory by subtracting 0.23 mg/dl.36 eGFR was dichot-\ndefine moderate CKD. This threshold was chosen on the basis of\ncurrent National Kidney Foundation guidelines defining CKD.37 Mi-\ncroalbuminuria was defined by gender-specific cut points using 17\nCovariates\nVariables that were known or hypothesized to be associated with cog-\nnitive function, CKD, or both were chosen from the NHANES III data\nfiles. Demographic variables including age, gender, and self-reported\nrace (coded as non-Hispanic black [black] versus others), educational\nlevel (12 yr), medication use (use of blood glucose regulators, anti-\ndepressants, lipid-lowering medication, antihypertensive medication,\nor drugs that effect the CNS), smoking status (current or nonsmoker),\nethanol use (one or more drinks per week), and self-reported current\nhealth status (excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor) were ascer-\ntained by in-person questionnaire. Physical activity was categorized as\nhaving any leisure-time activity during the past month as well as the\nself-reported total metabolic equivalents expended during the past\nmonth. History of myocardial infarction, stroke, and all cardiovascu-\nlar disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, and/or congestive heart\nfailure) was ascertained by self-report. Socioeconomic status was di-\nchotomized at 200% federal poverty level (\"poor or near poor\")\nusing methods similar to those described by Martins et al.38\nPhysical measures including systolic and diastolic BP, height, and\nweight were obtained during physical examination. Body mass index\nwas calculated as kg/m2. Participants were considered hypertensive\nwhen they reported having been told by a doctor that they had high\nBP, reported taking antihypertensive medication, or had an average\nBP 140/90 mmHg. Diabetes was defined as a fasting plasma glucose\n126 mg/dl, a self-report of diabetes, or self-report the use of blood\nglucose regulators. Hyperlipidemia was defined as a total cholesterol\n240 mg/dl or self-report of taking lipid-lowering medication. Lab-\noratory measures including serum creatinine (mg/dl), total choles-\nterol (mg/dl), HDL (mg/dl), BUN (mg/dl), hematocrit (%), urinary\nalbumin (g/min), and urinary creatinine (mg/d) were obtained dur-\ning laboratory examination.\nStudy Sample\nIndividuals were excluded from this study when they reported\ntaking antidepressants, when the examining physician found evi-\ndence of disabling impairment that prevented them from comply-\ning with the examination, when they had invalid (SRTT) or miss-\ning (because of nonresponse) test results, when they had an eGFR\nserum creatinine. A total of 5662 individuals were administered\ncognitive function tests. Of these, 5308 had serum creatinine val-\nues (93.7%). Cognitive function test scores for individuals with\nmissing serum creatinine values did not differ significantly from\nthose who were included in the study sample. Similarly, serum\ncreatinine and eGFR did not significantly differ between those with\ncomplete data and those with invalid or missing test results (data\nnot shown). Nonresponse rates varied by test; therefore, the num-\nber who completed each test is not uniform.29 After the exclusions\ndescribed, the study sample for the SRTT consisted of 4721 partic-\nipants, the study sample for the SDST consisted of 4965 partici-\npant, and the study sample for the SDLT consisted of 4956 partic-\nipant (Figure 1).\nStatistical Analyses\nA cross-sectional analysis was performed to examine the association\nbetween moderate CKD and cognitive function. Bivariate associa-\ntions with dichotomized eGFR and those who participated in any of\nthe cognitive function examinations were assessed with Wilcoxon\nrank-sum tests and 2 for continuous and categorical variables, re-\nspectively. Median (IQR) was reported for continuous variables. Pro-\nportions were reported for categorical variables.\nEach cognitive function test was modeled individually. Model-build-\ning strategy followed that of previous studies that examined the associa-\ntion of eGFR and cognitive function.16,17 A priori, it was decided that\nlinear regression would be used to model cognitive function and eGFR.\nHowever, should a cognitive function variable not be normally distrib-\nuted, then transformations of the variable would be attempted to satisfy\nthe normality assumption. If transformations could not satisfy the nor-\nmality assumption, then the results would be categorized into quartiles,\nbecausetherewerenoestablishedcutpointsforthesetests.16 The\"abnor-\nmal\" quartile is defined as the quartile with the longest reaction time\n(SRTT and SDST) or the quartile with the largest number of errors\n(SDLT).Logisticregressionwasusedtocomparethe\"abnormal\"quartile\nwith the remaining three quartiles.
