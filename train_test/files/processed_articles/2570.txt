However, research on the association between physical\nactivity and positive mental health outcomes is limited. Happiness is an example of a positive construct of mental\nhealth that may be promoted by physical activity and could increase resilience to emotional perturbations. The aim\nof this study is to use a large multi-country dataset to assess the association of happiness with physical activity\nvolume and its specificity to intensity and/or activity domain.\nassessing self-reported happiness on a six point scale (dichotomised: happy/unhappy) and physical activity data\ncollected using the IPAQ-short (i.e. walking, moderate, vigorous) and four domain specific items (i.e. domestic,\nleisure, transport, vocation). Logistic regression was used to examine the association between happiness and\nphysical activity volume adjusted for sex, age, country, general health, relationship status, employment and\neducation.

Previous research has predominantly focused on\npreventive and curative approaches to negative mental\nhealth disorders that are endemic in modern society [2]. It\nis now widely accepted that engaging in physical activity\npositively influences depression and anxiety across the\nlifespan [3-6]. However, there is less evidence regarding\nthe relationship between physical activity and positive\nmental health constructs that may subsequently increase\nresilience to emotional perturbations [4,7-9]. This paucity\nof research is evident in physical activity behaviour change\nmessages that have previously focused on disease preven-\ntion rather than the promotion of positive mental health\noutcomes (e.g. physical activity to prevent depression ra-\nther than to promote happiness). It is thought that exam-\nining positive components of mental well-being, such as\nhappiness, may identify new opportunities to apply health\npromotion models to physical activity interventions and\nimprove mental health outcomes [10].\nDespite a range of definitions for the construct of happi-\nness, there is general consensus that it comprises positive\nmental or emotional (affective) states of enjoyment and\ncontentment [9-11]. It appears that the promotion of hap-\npiness is emerging as a public health priority in several\ncountries globally. This is evident in a recent report pub-\nlished by the World Health Organisation (WHO) Bulletin\nthat indicated countries such as the UK, France and\nCanada are following Bhutan's example and considering\nnational happiness indexes to complement existing popu-\nlation measures of development such as Gross Domestic\nProduct (GDP) [11]. This represents a clear departure\nfrom measuring economic growth as the sole indicator of\nnational prosperity and has stimulated debate on how\nhappiness can be facilitated [12,13]. Lyubomirsky et al.\n(2005) described three general predictors of happiness: (i)\nlife circumstances and demographics; (ii) traits and dispo-\nsitions; (iii) intentional behaviours [12]. From a public\nhealth perspective, \"intentional behaviour\" is the only one\nof these predictors that is individually modifiable and as\nan example of this, physical activity has been identified as\na strategy that may induce happiness [13].\nSeveral literature reviews have described a positive associ-\nation between physical activity and mental well-being, but\nthere is a paucity of studies specific to the construct of hap-\npiness [6,7,14]. The existing evidence primarily comprises\nsingle-country cross-sectional analyses that indicate happi-\nness is positively associated with higher volumes of physical\nactivity [15-17]. These studies have used different methods\nto assess happiness and to our knowledge there are no pre-\nvious multi-country analyses that have assessed the associ-\nation with physical activity using consistent metrics. There\nis also limited evidence describing the relationship of differ-\nent physical activity domains (i.e. domestic, leisure, trans-\nport, vocation) and intensities (i.e. moderate, vigorous) with\nhappiness. This makes it difficult to target specific physical\nactivity promotion messages to activities that may be more\nbeneficial. Although previous analyses of population survey\ndata from several countries indicate that physical activity for\nleisure appears to have a stronger association with mental\nhealth than other domains, these studies have not assessed\nthe construct of happiness [18-20]. It also appears that phys-\nical activity intensity may be an important moderating factor\nfor various mental health outcomes, but existing recom-\nmendations focus on physical outcomes and there is\ncurrently insufficient evidence to target these towards im-\nIn this paper, our primary objective is to use a large\nmulti-country European dataset to examine the association\nbetween self-reported physical activity and happiness. Our\nsecondary objective is to analyse the domain- and intensity-\nspecific associations of physical activity with happiness. We\nintend the results to inform future research and policy on\ntargeting physical activity interventions to promote happi-\nness and other positive constructs of mental health.\nMethods\nStudy sample and data collection procedures\nThe Eurobarometer is a multi-national survey of public\nopinion and social trends in the European Union\nconducted since the 1970s on behalf of the European\nCommission (http://www.gesis.org/eurobarometer). In this\nstudy, we accessed data from Eurobarometer 58.2, which\nwas the most recent survey that collected concurrent data\non physical activity and happiness (October 28 - December\nnon-commercial research is authorized.\nspondents from 15 European Union countries: Austria,\nBelgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,\nIreland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain,\nSweden, United Kingdom. All European Union citizens\nresiding in those countries (nationals and non-nationals)\nwho were at least 15 years old were eligible to partici-\npate. Sample sizes within countries ranged from n = 602\n(Luxembourg) to n = 2,042 (Germany) and the overall\nParticipants in the Eurobarometer 58.2 survey were sam-\npled via a multi-stage design. First, primary sampling units\n(PSU) were selected from each European statistical adminis-\ntrative region in participating countries, with the sampling\nprobability proportional to population size and stratified by\nurbanisation. Second, addresses were randomly selected\nwithin each PSU, and then one respondent was randomly\nselected per household. All necessary informed consent was\nobtained for each respondent and they were interviewed\nface-to-face in their homes in their national language. The\ndata were collected by the European Opinion Research\nGroup, which is a consortium of marketing and public\nopinion research agencies. Further details of Eurobarometer\nmethods are available online (http://ec.europa.eu/public_o-\npinion/description_en.htm).\nMeasures\nThe Eurobarometer 58.2 survey categories for socio-demo-\ngraphic data about the participants were used for: sex (male,\nyears, 20 years, still studying); self-reported general state of\nhealth (very good, good, fair, bad/very bad); employment sta-\ntus (self-employed, employed, not working). We recoded the\nrelationship status responses into a dichotomized variable\nbased on current cohabitation with a partner (currently\ncohabitating: \"married\", \"remarried\", \"unmarried, currently\nliving with partner\"; not currently cohabitating: \"unmarried,\nhaving never lived with a partner\", \"unmarried, having previ-\nously lived with a partner but on my own\", \"divorced\", \"sep-\narated\" and \"widowed\").\nThe measurement of happiness was adopted from a\nsingle question from the SF-36 survey: \"In the past\nmonth, have you felt happy?\" [25]. There were six re-\nsponse options that we recoded into a dichotomized\nvariable to differentiate between those who provided a\npositive vs. negative response (YES: \"all the time\", \"very\noften\", \"often\"; NO: \"rarely\", \"very rarely\", \"never\").\nPhysical activity was assessed by adapting questions\nfrom the short form of the International Physical Activ-\nity Questionnaire (IPAQ-short) into a multiple-choice\nformat as presented in Table 1 [26]. The IPAQ-short had\ntest-retest reliability (Spearman's rho = 0.76) and criter-\nion validity (Spearman's rho = 0.30) that was comparable\nto other self-report measures [27]. Participants were\nasked to report the number of days in the past week and\nthe total time per day (hours/minutes) of walking,\nmoderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity physical activ-\nity in bouts of at least 10 minutes. We calculated phys-\nical activity volume as the sum of the three activities\nwith vigorous physical activity weighted by two to ac-\ncount for higher energy expenditure. Participants were\nthen classified based on the global physical activity rec-\nommendations as \"inactive\" (0\u00ad9 minutes of physical ac-\ntivity), \"insufficiently active\" (10\u00ad149 min), \"sufficiently\nalso calculated the independent amounts of walking,\nmoderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity physical activ-\nity for subsequent analysis of intensity specific associa-\ntions with happiness.\nThe Eurobarometer 58.2 survey included four additional\nquestions to assess physical activity in various domains (i.e.\nvocation, transport, domestic and leisure). The participants\nwere asked: \"In the last seven days, how much physical ac-\ntivity did you get: 1) at work; 2) when moving from place to\nplace; 3) doing work in and around your house (including\nhousework, gardening, general maintenance, or caring for\nyour family); 4) for recreation, sport and leisure-time activ-\nities?\" There were three response options: \"a lot\", \"some\" or\n\"little or none\". These data were used to assess domain spe-\ncificity of the association between physical activity and\nhappiness.\nStatistical analysis and reporting\nData analyses were performed using IBM SPSS19.0. Partici-\npants who did not have complete physical activity data\nthey were \"severely restricted to physical activity\" were ex-\ncluded from the final analytical sample. Reported happiness\nwas presented according to socio-demographic character-\nistics and bivariate associations were examined using a\nPearson's chi-square test. We ran logistic regressions to\nexamine the crude and adjusted associations of happiness\nwith: 1) physical activity volume; 2) physical activity inten-\nsity; 3) physical activity domain. The model for physical\nactivity volume was adjusted for sex, age group, country,\ngeneral state of health, relationship status, employment\nstatus and age when finished full-time education. The\nmodel for physical activity intensity included time spent\nengaging in walking, moderate-intensity and vigorous-\nintensity physical activity as independent variables, adjusted\nfor all of the covariates described above. Since previous\nstudies have identified sex differences for the association\nTable 1 Adaptation of the of the IPAQ-short questions\nQ50.

The associations between\ndomains of physical activity and happiness were tested in\nseparate models adjusted for physical activity volume in\naddition to all covariates. The model for vocational physical\nactivity only included those currently employed (n = 5,816).\nStatistical significance was assessed at the levels of p < 0.05,\nResults\nDescriptive statistics\nEuropean Union countries (75.9% of the original sample)\nwere included in the current study. Descriptive statistics on\nproportion of feeling happy by country and relevant vari-\nables are presented in Table 2. Overall, 82.9% of the partici-\npants reported feeling happy (all the time, very often or\noften) in the past month. Significant differences were ob-\nserved across socio-demographic factors and by country.\nproportions of feeling happy and Dutch (91.1%) and Irish\n(90.4%) reported the highest proportions of feeling happy.\nThe participants were more likely to report feeling happy if\nthey were male, of younger age groups (i.e. below 40 years),\nin good health, currently in a relationship and working. Be-\nsides a positive association between educational attainment\nand feeling happy, those who were still studying were the\nmost likely to report being happy. There was a significant\nand positive association between physical activity participa-\ntion level and happiness, with nearly 86% of those who were\nvery active reporting feeling happy.\nPhysical activity and happiness\nThe crude and adjusted odds ratios of the association of\nfeeling happy with physical activity volume, intensity and\ndomain are presented in Table 3.\nA positive dose\u00adresponse relationship was found for\nphysical activity volume and happiness. Compared to in-\nactive participants, the adjusted odds of being happy was\n20% higher for people insufficiently active and this in-\ncreased to 29% and 52% higher for those sufficiently and\nvery active respectively.\nAll crude odds ratios for the association between happi-\nness and different physical activity intensities (i.e. walking,\nmoderate, vigorous) were small, but statistically significant.\nThese associations only remained statistically significant for\nwalking and vigorous-intensity physical activity in the ad-\njusted model. The adjusted results indicate that the odds of\nbeing happy were 2% higher for each additional weekly\nhour of walking and 3% higher for each additional hour of\nvigorous physical activity. There were no significant interac-\ntions with sex for our analyses of walking [p = 0.21] or\nmoderate intensity physical activity [p = 0.20]. However, we\nfound a significant interaction with sex for our vigorous\nphysical activity result [p = 0.002]. The sex stratified analyses\nfound a significant association between vigorous physical ac-\nThere was a statistically significant crude association be-\ntween happiness and doing \"some\" or \"a lot\" of physical\nactivity in each domain (i.e. vocation, transport, domestic\nand leisure). These associations remained statistically sig-\nnificant for the vocational and domestic domains after\nadjusting for socio-demographic variables and physical ac-\ntivity volume. Domestic physical activity appeared to have\nthe strongest association with happiness in the adjusted\nmodels. Compared with people who reported \"little or no\"\ndomestic physical activity, those who reported \"some\" had\n36% higher odds of feeling happy and this further in-\ncreased to 42% for those who reported \"a lot\". In contrast,\ncompared with people who reported \"little or no\" voca-\ntional physical activity, those who reported \"some\" had\n39% higher odds of feeling happy and this decreased to\n33% for those who reported \"a lot\". Participants who re-\nported \"some\" leisure physical activity were not signifi-\ncantly different to those who reported \"little or none\", but\nthose doing \"a lot\" had 15% higher odds of feeling happy.\nThe amount of physical activity in the transport domain\nwas not significantly associated with feeling happy in the\nadjusted model.\nDiscussion\nFindings from our study indicate that increasing volumes of\nphysical activity are associated with higher levels of happi-\nness. The intensity of physical activity appears to be of min-\nimal importance. However, the association with happiness\nwas domain specific and our results indicate it was stron-\ngest for people who engaged in \"some\" vocational and/or \"a\nlot\" of domestic physical activity.\nTo our knowledge, this paper presents the first multi-\ncountry analyses of the association between physical activ-\nity and happiness. Our results for the association between\nphysical activity volume and happiness are similar to pre-\nvious cross-sectional analyses completed in several healthy\npopulations. Kye et al. (2014) assessed a random sample\nthose who exercised for 30 minutes at least five times per\nweek were more likely to be happy [17]. Similarly, a study\nfound that those who engaged in daily physical activity\nand found that those who participated more frequently in\nphysical activity were significantly happier [15]. Secondary\nanalysis of four population surveys from the USA and\nCanada that included people aged 10 years and older also\ndemonstrated an association between physical activity and\npositive mood [19]. This collection of papers suggests a\nglobal phenomenon that extends across the lifespan and\naligns with the broader evidence for other positive con-\nHowever, several authors remain sceptical about the asso-\nciation between physical activity and happiness. Blacklock\net al. (2007) suggested that the contribution of physical ac-\ntivity to happiness might be minor compared to other\ndemographic and lifestyle factors such as education, income\nand companionship [29]. Similarly, a longitudinal co-twin\nstudy conducted in the Netherlands concluded that an\nunderlying environmental or genetic confounding factor\nmay be positively influencing both physical activity partici-\npation and happiness [30]. This ongoing conjecture war-\nrants further prospective intervention studies to establish\nthe relationship between physical activity and happiness.\nOur finding that only walking and vigorous-intensity\nphysical activity had small associations with happiness\nadds to ongoing debate in the literature regarding\nintensity-specificity. Although a previous review of exer-\ncise and mood state suggested that moderate-intensity\nphysical activity is the most beneficial, it is thought that\nthis may vary according to the personal preference of\nadults suggested that sex may moderate the association\nbetween physical activity intensity and several constructs\nof mental health [21]. However, our results contrasted\nwith the findings of this previous study, which suggested\nbetter mental health outcomes were most strongly asso-\nciated with physical activity at a vigorous intensity for\nmen and at a moderate intensity or walking for women\n[21]. Although it is important to note that previous re-\nsearch has focused on broader constructs of mental\nhealth than happiness, this ongoing uncertainty suggests\nfurther sex specific investigation is necessary.\nIn contrast, we found several stronger associations be-\ntween different domains of physical activity and happi-\nness. The results for the vocational domain suggest that\noptimal happiness is associated with performing some\nphysical activity at work, but not a lot. This concurs with\nexisting evidence for the deleterious effects on mental\nhealth of both highly sedentary lifestyles and work that\nis primarily manual labour [31,32]. There appears to be\nTable 2 Descriptive table of happiness by variables of\nn (%) % Feeling happy p-value\nSex\nAge group\nCountry\nGeneral state of health\nRelationship status\nEmployment status\nAge when finished full-time education\nTable 2 Descriptive table of happiness by variables of\nPhysical activity level\nChi-square test for significance between distributions among variables\nof interest.\na \"happy medium\" for vocational physical activity and\nfurther research is indicated to identify the most effect-\nive ways of facilitating this in different workplaces.\nOur results for the transport domain also concur with\nexisting data. The Taking Part Survey included more\nthan 24,000 British adults and demonstrated that happi-\nness is associated with participation in recreational\nsport, but not cycling for utilitarian purposes (e.g. trans-\nport to work) [33]. This may be explained by concerns\nabout safety and the underlying recreational versus utili-\ntarian motives for physical activity in the transport do-\nmain (i.e. commuting is often a necessary process that\n\"must be done\" and is inherently stressful) [9,20,33].\nConsequently, perhaps future research on the relation-\nship between active transport and happiness should\nfocus on comparisons with motorised commuting, rather\nthan other physical activity domains.\nContrary to our results suggesting that domestic phys-\nical activity has the strongest association with happiness,\nthe existing evidence indicates that the leisure domain\nmay be more important. Secondary analysis of the 1978\nCanadian Health Survey found that women were consid-\nerably happier when engaged in recreational activities\nonly than when domestic chores were part of their phys-\nical activity mix [19]. Our contrasting findings may re-\nin social perceptions of domestic activities and gender\nroles and/or variation in cultural norms between Canada\nand Europe. It is also likely that further changes have oc-\ncurred since the 2002 Eurobarometer data was collected\nand this may limit the relevance of our results to current\nassociations between physical activity and happiness in\nthe participating countries. However, more recent data\nHealth Survey also indicated an inverse association with\nnegative constructs of mental health that was stronger\nfor leisure than domestic physical activity [18]. Similarly,\na Belgian study of 1,919 adults demonstrated variation\naccording to sex and other socio-demographic factors,\nbut also indicated that psychological distress was associ-\nated with recreational sport participation and inversely\nassociated with housework [20].\nWe hypothesise that the strong association between hap-\npiness and domestic physical activity in the 2002 Euroba-\nrometer data was because the measurement tool explicitly\nreferred to tasks that are often recreational (i.e. gardening)\nand promote self-worth (i.e. caring for family) [24]. As de-\nscribed by Aszatalos (2012), these are typical characteristics\nof \"mindful\" physical activity that is driven by a positive\nunderlying motivation and is more likely to be associated\nwith better mental health outcomes [9]. In contrast, the\ndomestic domains of the Canadian Health Survey focussed\non \"chores\", the Scottish Health Survey referred to \"heavy\nhousework/manual and gardening work\" and the previously\ndescribed Belgian study also assessed \"housework\" [18-20].\nThese descriptions invoke different connotations to the\nterms used in the Eurobarometer survey and demonstrate\nhow the heterogeneous adaptation of physical activity mea-\nsures in different settings may limit comparisons between\nstudies.\nMethods for assessing happiness have also been subject\nto ongoing debate and in 2011 there were more than\n1,200 measurement items listed on the World Database of\nHappiness [34]. The question we used was derived from\nthe widely utilised SF-36 Health Survey, but had not been\nvalidated in isolation. Despite continued conjecture about\nthe use of a single-item self-report measure of happiness,\nthe early work of Fordyce (1977) demonstrating this to be\nthe most psychometrically valid approach is yet to be\nTable 3 Multiple binary logistic regression of probability\nUnadjusted OR Adjusted OR\nPhysical activity volume (reference: inactive)2\nIntensity specific physical activity (unit: hours)3\nPhysical activity domain4\nVocation physical activity level (reference: little/none)5\nTransport physical activity level (reference: little/none)\nDomestic physical activity level (reference: little/none)\nLeisure physical activity level (reference: little/none)\n1All participants who had no physical activity data or were \"severely restricted\nto physical activities\" were excluded.\n2Adjusted for sex, age, country, general health, relationship status,\nemployment status, age finished full-time education.\n3Adjusted for sex, age, country, general health, relationship status,\nemployment status, age finished full-time education, other categories of\nphysical activity intensity.\n4Adjusted in separate models for sex, age, country, general health, relationship\nstatus, employment status, age finished full-time education, physical\nactivity volume.\n5Only participants reporting current employment were included in the\nrefuted [35]. However, there is evidence to suggest that\nthe construct of happiness is inconsistent across languages\nand this may have implications on the validity of the find-\nings in this multi-country study [34]. Furthermore, the\nrelationship with mental health outcomes may vary de-\npending on whether physical activity is measured subject-\nively (e.g. self-report) or objectively (e.g. accelerometer)\n[36,37]. The limitations of self-report data for physical ac-\ntivity are well documented and although this has not been\nexamined when assessing associations with positive con-\nstructs of mental health, it weakens our conclusions and\nmay be an important consideration in future studies.\nAnother limitation of our study is the cross-sectional\ndesign. There has been limited research to establish the\nexistence and direction of a causal relationship between\nphysical activity and happiness. Wang et al. (2012) linked\ndata from consecutive National Population Health Surveys\nin Canada and found that leisure physical activity was as-\nsociated with a decreased likelihood of becoming unhappy\nand may help maintain happiness over time [38]. Similar\nconclusions were drawn from a survey of 438 Norwegian\nadults that found that retrospectively reported adolescent\nexercise levels were correlated with positive mood and\nhappiness in adulthood [39]. However, the relationship\nbetween adolescent physical activity and adult happiness\nwas no longer significant after adjustment for adult phys-\nical activity levels [39]. Consequently, further investigation\ninto the direction of causation and the longitudinal\nrelationship between physical activity and happiness is\nwarranted.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrate for the first time\nthat happiness is associated with physical activity participa-\ntion across multiple countries. This study adds impetus to a\npotential paradigm shift for physical activity and mental\nhealth towards promoting positive outcomes that may be\nmore appealing to the population and increase resilience to\nmental health disorders. However, further longitudinal re-\nsearch is indicated to dissect the direction of causation and\nthe specificity of physical activity domain and intensity for\ndifferent mental health constructs.\nAbbreviations\nGDP: Gross domestic product; IPAQ: International physical activity\nquestionnaire; OR: Odds ratio; PSU: Primary sampling unit; WHO: World\nHealth Organisation.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare they have no competing interests.\nAuthor contributions\nAll authors contributed to conceptualising the study and editing drafts of\nthe manuscript.
