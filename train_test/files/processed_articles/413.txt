Exclusion of subjects with extreme energy\nintake is commonly used in nutritional epidemiologic studies,23,24\nbecause implausible reported energy intake suggest likely inaccurate\nestimation of other dietary exposure intakes, ie, added sugar or\ndrinks in this case.\nAssessment of Dietary Intakes and Covariates\nsingle 24-hour recall from each participant. Data were available from\n2 data sets: individual food files25 which provided nutrient data (eg,\ntotal energy and alcohol), and pyramid servings intake data for\nNHANES,26 which provided standard serving size information for 5\nmajor pyramid food groups (grains, dairy, fruit, vegetables, meat,\nand beans), as well as added sugar and discretionary fat (ie, excess\nfat). Details about calculation of added sugar are described\nInformation on age, gender, race/ethnicity, body measurements\n(including weight and height), smoking status, vitamin and mineral\nsupplement use, medication use (including diuretics, -blockers,\naspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and medical\nconditions (including self-reported diabetes) was collected by self-\nreport. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kilo-\ngrams)/height (meters)2. Subjects who had smoked 100 cigarettes\nin their lifetimes were considered never smokers; subjects who had\nsmoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes were considered former\nsmokers if they answered negatively to the question, \"Do you smoke\nnow?\" and current smokers if they answered affirmatively.28 Sub-\njects were identified as having diabetes if they reported that they had\ndiabetes or that they used medications for diabetes (insulin or oral\nmedicines). Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure\n140 mm Hg, and/or diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg, and/or\nuse of medicine for hypertension.\nSerum Uric Acid Measurement\nSerum uric acid concentrations were measured with a Beckman\nSynchron LX20 using a timed end point method. Uric acid is\noxidized by uricase to produce allantoin and hydrogen peroxide. The\nhydrogen peroxide reacts with 4-aminoantipyrine and 3,5-dichloro-\n2-hydroxybenzene sulfonate in a reaction catalyzed by peroxidase to\nproduce a colored product. The system monitors the change in\nabsorbance at 520 nm at a fixed time interval. The change in\nabsorbance is directly proportional to the concentration of uric acid\nStatistical Analyses\nAll of the statistical analyses were performed with SUDAAN,\nversion 9.0 (Research Triangle Institute) using techniques appropri-\nare representative of the US community-dwelling population. All of\nthe P values are 2 sided. Dietary variables were analyzed in quartiles\nof the whole population. This conservative approach has the advan-\ntage that it greatly reduces the chance that a small number of extreme\nobservations will have undue influence on the results. Because a\nlarge proportion of subjects did not report sugar-sweetened drinks or\nfruit juice, we assigned them into the lowest intake quartile. We then\nevenly divided the rest subjects into 3 categories based on reported\nintakes and treated them as quartiles 2 to 4. A linear regression\nmodel was used to evaluate associations between dietary variables\nand serum uric acid. Linear trends were tested for significance by\nusing the median value for each quartile of intake and treating this\nvalue as a continuous variable. We adjusted for age (year), gender,\nsmoking (never, past, current: 1 to 14 or 15 cigarettes per day),\nBMI, ethnicity, hypertension (yes/no), diabetes (yes/no), intake of\ntotal energy (megajoules per day), alcohol (grams per day), dietary\nvitamin C (milligrams per day), fruit (servings per day), vegetables\n(servings per day), meat and seafood (servings per day), whole grains\n(servings per day), and use of antioxidant supplements (vitamin E,\nvitamin C, and carotenoids), -blockers, or diuretics (each yes/no).\nWe also examined whether correlations of added sugar and\nsweetened drink intakes with serum uric acid were modified by\ngender, alcohol (none versus 0 g/d), smoking status (never versus\never), and BMI (25 versus 25 kg/m2). To test these correlations,\nwe included multiplicative terms in the linear regression models with\nadjustment for other potential confounders. To examine robustness\nof the results, we conducted sensitivity analyses by excluding\nsubjects with hypertension or diabetes. Because losartan has been\nshown in humans to decrease serum uric acid30 and to prevent\nfructose-induced hypertension in the rat model,31 we also did a\nsensitivity analysis excluding subjects who reported use of losartan.\nResults\nThere was a 10-fold difference in the median added sugar\nintake between the highest and lowest quartiles (Table 1).\nThose with the greatest added sugar intakes tended to be\nyounger, male, and current smokers; were less likely to have\ndiabetes and hypertension; were less likely to report use of\nantioxidant supplements or the assessed antihypertensive\nmedicines; and had higher intakes of total energy and meat\nand lower intakes of fruit and alcohol relative to those in the\nlowest intake quartile.\nSubjects with the highest added sugar intake had signifi-\ncantly higher serum uric acid concentrations relative to those\nP0.05), after adjustment for smoking; BMI; intake of total\nenergy, dairy, and alcohol; hypertension; and other potential\nconfounders (Table 2). Exclusion of participants with diabe-\ntes or hypertension did not change the associations (P for\ntrend 0.05 for both). Similar significant associations were\nseen after excluding subjects who reported use of losartan\n(data not shown). Consistent with the results on added sugars,\nsubjects in the highest sweetened drinks intake category had\nsignificantly higher serum uric acid relative to those in the\nlowest intake category; the difference in uric acid concentra-\nassociations between intakes of 2 major sugar-sweetened\ndrinks, soft drinks and fruit drinks, and serum uric acid. We\nfound a significant positive association for soft drinks (P for\nThere was no significant relationship between fruit juice\nintake and serum uric acid. We further examined the associ-\nations between intake of citrus juice and noncitrus juice and\nserum uric acid, but neither was significant. Intake of apples\nand pears, which are rich sources of naturally occurring\nfructose, was also not significantly associated with serum uric\nacid (data not shown). Further adjustment for coffee intake\ndid not materially change any of the findings.\nBecause sex hormones may modulate the metabolic re-\nsponse induced by fructose, we further explored possible\ninteractions of added sugar or beverage intake with gender in\nrelation to serum uric acid concentrations. Associations\nbetween added sugar or beverage intake and plasma uric acid\nconcentration were significantly modified by gender (P for\ninteraction 0.01 for both). Greater intake of added sugar or\nsweetened drinks was significantly associated with plasma\nuric acid among men (P for trend0.0008 for added sugar\nand 0.0003 for sweetened drinks) but not among women (P\nfor trend 0.2 for both; Figure). We did not see significant\nassociations between intakes of apples and pears or of fruit\njuice and serum uric acid concentrations in men (P for trend\nGao et al Uric Acid and Added Sugar 307\n0.1 for both). No significant interactions were found with\nage, smoking status, or BMI (P for interaction 0.05 for all)\ncompared with serum uric acid.\nDiscussion\nIn this national sample of men and women, we found that\ngreater intake of added sugars or sugar-sweetened drinks was\nassociated with higher plasma uric acid concentration in men\nbut not in women (P for interaction 0.01). Intake of fruit\njuice, which contains a large amount of naturally occurring\nsugar, was not associated with plasma uric acid.\nThese findings could have important clinical and public\nhealth implications. High serum uric acid has been suggested\nas a possible risk factor for hypertension, metabolic syn-\ndrome, and cardiovascular disease, independent of the tradi-\ntional risk factors.4,7,32 Associations between hyperuricemia\nand hypertension have been reported in several studies.33\u00ad35\nProspective data within 1 study indicated that hyperuricemia\nprecedes onset of hypertension.34 Several studies, in vivo and\nin vitro, have examined the pathophysiological links between\nhyperuricemia and hypertension. Hyperuricemia has been\nassociated with higher renal vascular and total peripheral\nresistances.36 In 1 study, uric acid infusion in humans led to\nimpaired endothelial NO release, which was reversed by\nallopurinol, which inhibits uric acid production.5 Hyperurice-\nmia may also increase salt retention.37 In addition, elevated\nuric acid concentration is associated with insulin resistance,\nall of which may affect the development of hypertension.40,41\nOn the other hand, consumption of added sugars, especially\nhigh-fructose corn syrup, has been increasing rapidly during\nthe past few decades in the United States. Economic disap-\naverage intake of added sugars increased from  64 to 80\nkg/y per person, whereas high-fructose corn syrup has in-\nHowever, because economic disappearance data come from\nmeasuring the amount of all the foods that were produced or\nimported and then subtracting all the nonfood uses, consump-\ntion of added sugars could be overestimated. Using the same\nTABLE 1. Classification of the Characteristics of the Study Population by\nCharacteristic\nQuartile of Added Sugar Intake\nEthnicity, %\nSmoking status, %\n*MeanSE, adjusted for age and gender.\nNHANES data, we have shown previously that careful\nrestriction of added sugar and fat intake is a key for\nmaintenance of appropriate energy intake of Americans.22\nOur findings that greater intake of foods with high-fructose\ncontent correlates with elevated concentrations of uric acid\nare consistent with a recent animal study in which high-\nfructose intake induced elevated blood pressure and metabol-\nic syndrome in rats; these effects were partially prevented by\nadministration of allopurinol, which lowered serum uric\nacid.4 Several animal studies have demonstrated that fructose\nhas a pathogenetic role in hypertension: overloaded fructose\nmay cause hypertension,10\u00ad12,31 whereas a high-fructose diet\nincreased mortality in hypertensive rats.42 Associations be-\ntween intakes of added sugar and sugar-sweetened drinks and\nserum uric acid are also consistent with previous trials,43\u00ad47\nwhere the administration of a high dose of fructose, either\nintravenously or orally, led to increases in serum uric acid\nconcentration.\nUse of ATP in the phosphorylation of fructose and seques-\ntration of phosphate in fructose-1-phosphate could be an\nunderlying mechanism by which greater intake of added\nsugar, especially of high-fructose corn syrup in sweetened\ndrinks, is associated with high serum uric acid concentra-\ntions.2 ATP and phosphate are inhibitors of enzymes of\nadenine nucleotide degradation (eg, 5-nucleotidase and\nadenosine monophosphate deaminase). Removal of this inhi-\nbition, may, therefore, increase the generation of uric acid.2\nGreater intake of fructose has also been shown to decrease\nuric acid excretion because of an association with increased\nlactate production.4\nFructose-induced metabolic abnormalities could be another\nreason for hyperuricemia. Greater intake of fructose or\nTABLE 2.

Animal studies showed that\ncastration of male rats decreased synthesis of nucleotides,\nguanosine monophosphate, and adenosine monophosphate\nand nucleotide catabolism, which was restored by adminis-\ntration of testosterone.55,56 In a sample of obese children aged\n10 to 16 years, Denzer et al57 reported a significant positive\nassociation between plasma testosterone and uric acid con-\ncentrations. Furthermore, animal studies have demonstrated\ngender differences in uric acid transporters, such as urate\ntransporter 1 and organic anion transport.58 The expression of\nthese transporters is higher in male mice than in female mice.\nTherefore, male mice have a higher reabsorption of uric acid\nthan female mice. Interestingly, epidemiologic studies have\nshown that dietary fructose was associated with disadvanta-\ngeous plasma lipid profiles in men but not in women.59,60 A\nseries of animal studies has demonstrated that effects of\nfructose on plasma insulin and insulin resistance differed by\ngender.19,52 Fructose feeding had a deteriorative effect only in\nmale rats but not in female rats. As discussed above, blood\nlipid and insulin status are associated with serum uric acid.\nThese data, together with our study, suggest that sex hor-\nmones or other gender-related factors may influence fructose\nor uric acid metabolism.

Further investiga-\ntion of these may increase our understanding of uric acid\nmetabolism.\nWe did not observe a significant association between\nintake of fruit juice, a major source of naturally occurring\nfructose, and serum uric acid concentrations. One could\nspeculate that fruit juice is also a good source of antioxidants,\nincluding vitamin C and carotenoids. Vitamin C has been\nshown to have an uricosuric effect, ie, increasing uric acid\nexcretion.61,62 These components could offset the deleterious\neffects of fructose. Another possible explanation for this\ndiscrepancy is that, in the current population, variation in fruit\njuice intake was smaller than that of sugar-sweetened drink\nintake; the difference between the 2 extreme fruit juice intake\nquartiles was 2.7 servings per day relative to 5.7 servings per\nday of sugar-sweetened drinks.\nOur study has several limitations. We cannot claim cau-\nsality because of the cross-sectional nature of this study.\nSubjects may change their diets because of conditions related\nto elevated serum uric acid concentrations. However, we\nobtained similar significant associations after exclusion of\nthose with hypertension or diabetes. A single 24-hour recall\nwas used to assess dietary intake. This method may not\naccurately estimate the true variation in added sugar intake in\nthe population. Furthermore, it cannot capture the long-term\ndietary intake pattern for each subject because of high\nday-to-day variation. The resulting misclassification in expo-\nsure measurement may lead to an inaccurate estimation of the\nassociations between added sugars and serum uric acid.\nPerspectives\nWe found positive associations between intake of added\nsugar and sweetened drinks and serum uric acid concentration\nin men but not in women. If the association is causal, it could\nimply a potential method to prevent certain chronic diseases,\nsuch as gout and cardiovascular disease. In addition, an\nindividual with high dietary fructose intake might need closer\nscreening for the onset of cardiovascular disease. Associa-\ntions of intake of added sugar and sweetened drinks with\nserum uric acid and possibly with hypertension and metabolic\nsyndrome are needed to be confirmed by well-designed\nclinical trials. Further research is also needed to understand\nthe differences in association between hyperuricemia and\nhigh dietary intake of fructose in men and women.\nSources of Funding\nThe study was supported by National Institutes of Health/National\nDisclosures\nNone.\nReferences\n1.
