    "abstract": "Abstract\nFirst responders are often exposed to multiple potentially traumatic incidents over the course of their career. However,\nscientific research showed that first responders are more resilient compared with the general population. In addition,\nexperience of life-threatening situations and acute stress may lead first responders to the development of posttraumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD) or posttraumatic stress symptoms. Current clinical research and practice has developed evidence-\nbased treatments shown to be effective in helping first responders ameliorate their PTSD symptoms and perform their\nduties effectively. Literature showed that cognitive\u00adbehavioral therapy (CBT) entails multiple evidence-based techniques\nthat lead those suffering from PTSD toward symptom improvement and trauma recovery. The current article aims to (a)\nprovide readers with rigorous information about stress and trauma experienced by first responders, (b) present PTSD\nsymptomatology as well as risk and protective PTSD factors prevalent among first responders, (c) provide information about\nthe psychophysiology of PTSD, and (d) explore the efficacy of CBT treatment for first responders diagnosed with PTSD. The\nauthor highlights the necessity for psychophysiological measurement of CBT treatment efficacy for first responders diagnosed\nwith PTSD; also, potential gaps in the current scientific literature regarding this issue are highlighted. Recommendations for\nfuture research and clinical practice are discussed so that health professionals and researchers continue to serve those who\nserve our communities.\n",

(Capt. Greg Davis,\nLos Angeles, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] survivor)\nThe Unique Job of First Responders:\nOscillating Between Life Threat and\nEthics of Care\nMost people, if asked about the actual work involved in\nbeing a police officer, firefighter, or an emergency medical\nservices (EMS) worker, would probably suggest that police\nwork mainly focuses on crime investigations, patrol, and\narrest of criminals; that a firefighter's work is primarily\nrelated to extinguishing fires; and that the EMS worker's job\nis aimed at providing first aid services. Nevertheless, the\nreality of what first responders' work entails is more com-\nplex than many people may presume. Undeniably, police\nofficers are often crime fighters and, as such, they are sworn\nand mandated to respond to virulent crimes (i.e., terrorism\nattacks, murders) and arrest the criminal(s) (Haugen, Evces,\n& Weiss, 2012). Similarly, firefighters are mandated to\nrespond, among other things, to residential and commercial\nfires, explosions, spills, and large-scale natural disasters (Del\nBen, Scotti, Chen, & Fortson, 2006). Analogously, EMS\nworkers are trained to respond to a variety of emergency situ-\nations, medical crises, and community disasters, to name but\n1University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nKonstantinos Papazoglou, Department of Psychology, University of\nToronto Mississauga Campus, Deer Field Hall, Room #4044, Toronto,\nEmail: kons.papazoglou@mail.utoronto.ca\nExamining the Psychophysiological\nEfficacy of CBT Treatment for First\nResponders Diagnosed With PTSD: An\nUnderstudied Topic\nKonstantinos Papazoglou1\n Keywords\nfirst responders, trauma, stress, PTSD, cognitive\u00adbehavioral therapy, psychotherapy, clinical psychology, psychology, social\nsciences, psychophysiology of PTSD\n2 SAGE Open\na few of the critical situations in which they may find them-\nselves (Corneil, Beaton, Murphy, Johnson, & Pike, 1999;\nVan der Ploeg & Kleber, 2003).Apart from the importance of\ntheir own bodily survival on the street, the value of \"hero-\nism\" in the first responders'subcultures is salient, because its\nmembers are expected to approach situations and be pre-\npared to sacrifice their lives where average individuals would\nhave escaped (Lucas & Kline, 2008). For instance, during\nthe 9/11 terrorist attacks, firefighters and police officers,\nrisking their own lives, entered in and stayed in the ready-to-\ncollapse buildings to save civilians who were otherwise\nunable to escape; they remained in the buildings saving civil-\nians until the buildings collapsed on them (Dwyer &\nNotwithstanding, the other side of the coin reveals that\nfirst responders often support victims of crimes (i.e., abused\nchildren, battered women) as well as victims of natural disas-\nters and accidents, being more often among the first respond-\ners present at the crime scene (Andersen, Papazoglou,\nwhen the mass school shooting occurred in Newtown,\nConnecticut, first responders were the first present at the\nscene (Draznin, 2013). As a result, they were the ones hold-\ning the wounded children and providing them with first aid\nas well as psychological support. What many may--con-\nsciously or unconsciously--ignore, is that first responders\nare exposed to a plethora of life-threatening and potentially\ntraumatic situations--over the course of their careers.\nTherefore, what makes first responders' work unique is that\nthey are expected to diligently maintain a dual role, oscillat-\ning between \"critical incident responder\" and \"social service\nworker\" (Manzella & Papazoglou, 2014). Some police psy-\nchologists and scholars have argued that first responders may\nencounter--not surprisingly--hundreds of potentially trau-\nmatic events during their careers (Rudofossi, 2009).\nPsychological Trauma Among First\nResponders\nPsychological trauma refers to any sudden, uncontrollable,\nand disruptive incident that negatively affects one's physical,\nemotional, behavioral, and cognitive processes, and conse-\nquently, that may beget various forms of psychopathology\n(i.e., posttraumatic stress reaction, major depression; Van der\nKolk, 2003). The origin of the term trauma can be traced back\nto the Greek word \"\" or \"\" which literally\nmeans \"to wound\" (Oxford English Online Dictionary, 2015).\nIn the area of psychological trauma, the etymology of the\nverb \"to wound\" insinuates the \"psychological wounds\" that\nmay emanate from exposure to any traumatic incident.\nPsychological research of the impact of trauma on police offi-\ncers has shown that the experience of trauma may be debili-\ntating for first responders' physical (i.e., high blood pressure,\ncardiovascular diseases) and psychological health (i.e., anxi-\nety disorder, depression) over the course of their careers\n2006). Furthermore, exposure to traumatic incidents may\naversely affect first responders' behavior (i.e., impatience,\nanger outbursts), cognitive processes (i.e., memory, informa-\ntion processing), and emotional reactivity to daily life (i.e.,\nsadness, feeling like a failure; Andersen et al., 2015). As\naforementioned, trauma experience by first responders is\ncumulative, long term, and complex (Papazoglou, 2013,\n2016). The complexity of first responders' trauma refers to\nthe fact that first responders may experience trauma directly\n(i.e., loss of a partner) or indirectly (i.e., by asking a victim of\nabuse to describe what happened; May & Wisco, 2016).\nAmong first responders, trauma is often experienced through\nsome or all the human senses. For instance, a life-threatening\nsituation (i.e., shooting) experienced by a police officer in the\nline of duty, may involve the following senses: sight (officer\nwas at the incident), sound (officer listened to the sounds of\nshots being fired), smell (officer smelt the smoke of the firing\nbullet), and touch (officer held the weapon during the inci-\ndent). It is possible that either direct or indirect exposure to\npotentially traumatic incidents may lead first responders to\nthe experience of many incapacitating mental and physical\nhealth-related conditions (Marmar et al., 2006; May & Wisco,\ntially traumatic incidents may lead to the onset of PTSD\nIn the scholarly literature, it is appeared that trauma expe-\nrienced between first responders and military personnel has\ncertain commonalities as well as distinctions. Both first\nresponders and military personnel are exposed to numerous\npotentially traumatic incidents during their career on the\ngrounds that they often respond to violent incidents, and are\neven prepared to sacrifice their own lives for social welfare\nand freedom. Furthermore, both military personnel and first\nresponders may vicariously experience trauma and loss\nwhen, for instance, their comrades (or colleagues) are\nwounded or even die; also, they may often support civilians\nwho have been wounded or lost family members and friends\nby deplorable actions (e.g., terrorist attacks, crimes; Walker,\nMcKune, Ferguson, Pyne, & Rattray, 2016). Nevertheless,\nthere are some distinct differences between military and first\nresponders' trauma. Military personnel may be exposed to\nhorrific incidents in the combat zone; however, exposure to\nsuch incidents is expected to end upon completion of deploy-\nment and return to their home country. However, first\nresponders serve for almost three decades, and exposure to\npotentially traumatic incidents (even though as intense as in\nthe combat zone) may occur any time until retirement\nkillings, and violent situations is more prominent and fre-\nquent among military personnel who are deployed in the\nresponders are mandated to maintain peace and order in the\ncommunities they serve and may often experience satisfac-\ntion in the line of duty by supporting traumatized individuals\nPapazoglou 3\n(e.g., victims of crimes; Andersen & Papazoglou, 2015;\nThe Enemy Within the \"Fortress\":\nPTSD Among First Responders\nPTSD Diagnosis and Symptomatology\nThe scientific literature emphasizes the complex nature of\nPTSD among first responders following exposure to traumatic\nThe complexity of PTSD among first responders derives from\nthe fact that first responders may experience multiple trau-\nmatic incidents over the course of their careers (Papazoglou,\nmay vary in terms of their intensity, frequency, and level of life\nthreat that may entail against first responders. For instance,\nSpecial Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) officers may be exposed\nto hundreds of potentially life-threatening situations over the\ncourse of their career. Also, an officer who serves in a child\nexploitation unit is probably exposed to a plethora of cases of\nabused children over a calendar year. The author posits that\nwhat renders first responders' trauma idiosyncratic compared\nwith the general public who may or may not experience trauma\nis the exposure to a myriad of life-threatening situations that\nmay be present (e.g., violent criminal shoots a cop) or eminent\n(e.g., officers respond to a domestic violence call). However,\nresearchers found that increased number of deployment tours\nof military personnel in the combat zone is related to higher\nrisk of PTSD development because exposure to potentially\ntraumatic incidents is accumulated over multiple deployments\n(Conard & Sauls, 2014; Reger, Gahm, Swanson, & Duma,\ndefined trauma as a horrific event that is beyond the scope of\nthe normal human experience. More specifically, a person\nexperiencing trauma is likely to perceive the incident as life\nthreatening, leading to the experience of helplessness, fear,\nhorror, or disgust. However, one needs to consider certain\nparameters to define an event as traumatic (Greenwald, 2007;\nWeathers, Marx, Friedman, & Schnurr, 2014). The severity\nand personal impact of the event appear to be the most impor-\ntant factors in the consideration of an event as traumatic. For\ninstance, during the Holocaust, millions of people were killed\n(severity of event) and many survivors lost their family mem-\nbers and their friends (personal impact of the event). Other\nparameters may also be related to the proximity of the experi-\nence and the after-event impact (Greenwald, 2007; Weathers\net al., 2014). For instance, a family may have experienced a\nnatural catastrophe (i.e., earthquake) and, as a result of the\nnatural catastrophe, find themselves homeless (after-event\nimpact). In addition, first responders may experience trauma\ndirectly or indirectly. In the first case, an officer, for instance,\nmay experience a life-threatening situation (e.g., shooting) in\nthe line of duty. In the second case, first responders may\nexperience trauma indirectly when, for instance, they respond\nto critical incidents and they support traumatized individuals.\nThis type of indirect traumatization among frontline profes-\nsionals has received considerable attention in research. To this\nfatigue\" to put emphasis on the indirect trauma experienced by\ncaregiving professionals who often support traumatized indi-\nviduals (e.g., victims of crimes, survivors of natural disasters)\nin the line of duty. A concise description of the Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5;APA,\n2013) diagnostic criteria for PTSD is as follows: (a) experi-\nence of the stressor (e.g., direct or indirect exposure), (b) intru-\nsive symptoms (e.g., intense or prolonged distress), (c)\navoidance (e.g., trauma-related external reminders), (d) nega-\ntive alterations in cognition and mood (e.g., persistent dis-\ntorted blame of self or others), and (e) alterations in arousal\nand reactivity (e.g., hypervigilance, sleep disturbance). These\nsymptoms need to have persisted for more than a month to\nqualify as diagnostic criteria for PTSD.\nIt is estimated that the prevalence of PTSD among the\ngeneral population is 1.5% to 5.5% (Frans, Rimm\u00f6, \u00c5berg,\nUnlike the general population, the prevalence of PTSD\namong first responders is reported as follows: 7% to 19%\nnoted that the these numbers are not conclusive but rather\nsuggestive, considering that different researchers estimated\ndifferent PTSD prevalence rates among first responders;\nhowever, their estimated PTSD prevalence rates for first\nresponders approximate the above-mentioned PTSD preva-\nlence rates' ranges. For instance, Skogstad and colleagues\ncontended that PTSD prevalence among police officers is\nless than 10% as opposed to a rate of 20% among firefighters\nand EMS workers. In her article published in the issue on\n\"Diagnostic Cracks\" in the journal of the National Center for\nPTSD, Schnurr (2014) emphasized that although many cli-\nents appear to have multiple PTSD-related symptoms, clini-\ncians are yet unable to diagnose them with PTSD on the\ngrounds that these clients lack the required symptoms to sat-\nisfy the diagnostic criteria for a full PTSD diagnosis.\nConsidering the abovementioned issue, Schnurr (2014)\npointed out the catalytic role of \"partial,\" \"subthreshold,\" or\n\"subsyndromal\" PTSD in helping in the diagnosis and treat-\nment of individuals with PTSD-related symptoms who did\nnot meet all the PTSD diagnostic criteria.\nThe Relationship Between PTSD, Suicide Risk,\nand Alcohol Consumption\nApart from the psychiatric diagnostic criteria, research\nshowed that PTSD has a profound impact on first respond-\ners'psychosocial and professional lives. Specifically, in their\nsystematic review of the literature, Stergiopoulos, Cimo,\n4 SAGE Open\nCheng, Bonato, and Dewa (2011) found that work-related\nPTSD resulted in increased sick leave and had further mali-\ncious effects on workers'productivity, leading in many cases\nto burnout and even unemployment (Van der Ploeg & Kleber,\n2003). In addition, there is a myriad of studies in the scien-\ntific literature that emphasize on the relationship between\nPTSD, alcohol consumption, and suicide risk among first\nresponders (e.g., Chopko, Palmieri, & Facemire, 2014;\nstudy with police officers (n = 1,734) in Finland, Leino,\nEskelinen, Summala, and Virtanen (2012) inferred that\nincreased alcohol consumption, psychological distress, and\nfear for future retraumatization were prevalent among those\nwho experienced work-related violence and injury.\nFurthermore, Violanti and his colleagues (2011) found that\nsignificantly more male officers compared with female offi-\ncers were more at risk of higher levels of hazardous alcohol\nuse. Researchers in this study highlighted the officers' haz-\nardous alcohol use was not related to police work stress per\nse; however, it was found to be significantly related to offi-\ncers' personal life stressors (e.g., divorce, separation) and\nbelieved that personal and family life stressors are related to\npolice work-related stressors' impact on officers' personal\nand family lives. Even though some studies showed that\npolice officers' alcohol consumption is not significantly\nhigher than that of the general population (Lindsay, Taylor,\nies found that exposure to critical incidents is associated with\nincreased PTSD symptomatology as well as alcohol con-\nsumption among police officers (M\u00e9nard & Arter, 2013). To\nthis end, many researchers emphasized on the strong associa-\ntion between PTSD and increased alcohol consumption\n(Chopko, Palmieri, & Adams, 2013). Moreover, PTSD\nsymptomatology was found to mediate the relationship\nbetween alcohol dependence and suicide risk among fire-\nfighters (C. E. Martin et al., 2017). In his research with a U.S.\nnational police sample, Violanti, Robinson, and Shen (2013)\nconcluded that police officers indicated significantly higher\nsuicide risk compared with the general population. In addi-\ntion, in another empirical study with police officers (n =\nPTSD and increased alcohol use appeared to increase the\nodds of suicide ideation approximately 10 times. In addition,\nViolanti's (2010) findings in this area of research revealed\nthat police suicides outnumbered police homicides by 2.36\ntimes. Analogous findings in research with firefighters\nrevealed the association between PTSD and suicide risk\n(Henderson, Van Hasselt, LeDuc, & Couwels, 2016).\nPTSD: Risk and Protective Factors\nScientific research has extensively explored factors that play\na salient role in leading first responders to PTSD or prevent-\ning them from the onset of it (i.e., Kehl, Knuth, Hulse, &\n(2015) argued that risk factors for PTSD are distinguished in\ntwo categories: objective factors (i.e., tension of incident,\nfatalities) and subjective ones (i.e., perceived life threats,\nperitraumatic distress). Furthermore, researchers have\nattempted to distinguish predictors of PTSD by establishing\nthree categories: pretraumatic, peritraumatic, and posttrau-\nmatic (Marchand, Nadeau, Beaulieu-Prevost, Boyer, &\nMartin, 2015). However, it seems that the aforementioned\nfactors often overlap within the abovementioned categories.\nFor instance, prior psychopathology (i.e., depressive symp-\ntoms), poor communication among peers, and poor emotional\ncoping strategies, may be pre- and posttraumatic risk factors\nfor PTSD (Armstrong, Shakespeare-Finch, & Shochet, 2014;\ntheir systematic review of the literature (n = 4,301 articles),\nSkogstad and colleagues concluded that first responders often\nexperience work-related PTSD, and they further found that\nmental health problems prior to traumatic incident exposure\nas well as lack of social support are factors that may increase\nthe risk of PTSD. What is noteworthy is that lack of social\nsupport and poor communication within the organization rel-\native to the traumatic experience were argued by many\nresearchers as risk factors associated with the onset of PTSD\namong first responders (Armstrong et al., 2014; Stephens &\nwhat seems to be effective (protective factor) in terms of\nsocial support and communication, specifically, is humor and\nnonjudgmental and empathic listening between first respond-\ners and their supervisors (M. Martin, Marchand, Boyer, &\nexpression between first responders and their family mem-\nbers (Evans, Pistrang, & Billings, 2013). Furthermore, lack of\nresources (i.e., psychological services) and the peritraumatic\nsense of uncontrollability and unpredictability were also\nfound to be risk factors that may lead to the onset of PTSD\namong first responders (Armstrong et al., 2014; Regambal\net al., 2015). In addition, peritraumatic dissociation (e.g.,\nemotional numbness, derealization, depersonalization, lack\nof awareness in one's surroundings) has been found to be one\nof the risk factors that may trigger PTSD symptoms (M.\nFrom the organizational perspective, elevated organiza-\ntional and operational stress among first responders may\ntrigger or deteriorate the PTSD symptoms (Armstrong et al.,\ntional and organizational stress and a strong sense of confi-\ndence in their cognitive processing of a traumatic incident as\nchallenging (vs. threatening) were found to be protective fac-\ntors against the onset of PTSD among first responders\nfirefighters (n = 397), Pinto and colleagues found that per-\nceived threats relative to the critical incident significantly\npredicted PTSD symptomatology. Moreover, the intensity of\nthe traumatic incident and prior psychopathology (i.e., anxi-\nety or depressive symptoms) and/or previous exposure to a\nPapazoglou 5\ntraumatic incident seem to be integral in the later onset of\nPTSD (Armstrong et al., 2014; Asmundson & Stapleton,\nspecifically, in their phenomenological study with EMS\nworkers (n = 77) and firefighters (n = 103), de Soir and col-\nleagues (2012) noted that the death of a colleague, the\ninvolvement of a family member or friend in the incident,\nand the pain and screaming of burned victims were major\ncharacteristics of a traumatic incident that profoundly\naffected both EMS personnel and firefighters.\nPTSD and Psychophysiology: Heart Rate (HR)\nReactivity\nA synthetic approach of the voluminous research work in the\npsychophysiology of PTSD has indicated the close relation-\nship between PTSD and HR. In their theoretical analysis of\nheart\u00adbrain interactions and psychophysiological coherence,\nMcCraty,Atkinson, Lipsenthal, andArguelles (2009) pointed\nout that the natural fluctuations in HR (\"so-called heart rate\nvariability [HRV]\") emanate from the heart\u00adbrain interac-\ntions as well as the interplay of the sympathetic and the para-\nsympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system\n(ANS). Therefore, any fluctuation in psychological pro-\ncesses--as occurs in negative emotions such as sadness--\nwas found to be directly associated with changes in HR\nreactivity because the human body tends to maintain or\nrestore a harmonious state (Buckley, Holohan, Greif, Bedard,\nAnalogously, dysregulation of the ANS--increased sympa-\nthetic and decreased parasympathetic activity--resulting\nfrom a traumatic experience is often caused by depressed--\nor maladaptive--HRV, indicating trauma survivors' reduced\ncapacity to regulate PTSD symptomatology (i.e., emotional\narousal, hypervigilance, stress; Tan et al., 2009). It is argued\nthat PTSD is akin to survivor's inability to restore the afore-\nmentioned harmony due to the intense psychophysiological\nreactivity to the traumatic experience; hence, survivors of\ntrauma diagnosed with PTSD manifest an elevated HR when\nexamined in their resting baseline levels, compared with\nnon-PTSD\u00addiagnosed individuals (Buckley et al., 2004;\nNevertheless, although research findings in measuring the\npsychophysiology of PTSD showed that HRV was less\nadaptable among veterans diagnosed with PTSD, HRV was\nincreased and PTSD symptoms reduced at the end of the\nPTSD biofeedback treatment (Tan, Dao, Farmer, Sutherland,\nstudy with individuals (n = 19) with PTSD diagnosis, Norte\nand colleagues (2013) found that individuals diagnosed with\nPTSD experienced persistently elevated HR and lowered\nHRV during and after the reexperiencing of the traumatic\nincident (researchers employed traumatic incident cues). In\nsimilar ways, observational studies with veterans diagnosed\nwith PTSD indicated the relationship between PTSD and\nelevated baseline resting HR (found 6.63 increased beats per\nminute--BPM; Buckley et al., 2004) as well as depressed\nHRV (Tan et al., 2009). What is also noteworthy is that indi-\nviduals exposed to a traumatic event had elevated HR\n(greater than one standard deviation above the age and sex\nmean) 24 hr following exposure to trauma, and were signifi-\ncantly more likely to experience PTSD symptoms in the\naftermath (6 months) of their traumatic experience (De\nBased on the previously discussed findings relative to the\ndirect association between PTSD and HR reactivity, many\nresearchers have suggested that HR reactivity be employed\nas a way to predict the onset of PTSD following exposure to\na traumatic incident (De Young et al., 2007; Keane, Long,\nas well as to measure the reduction of PTSD symptomatol-\nogy following PTSD treatment (Rothbaum, Ruef, Litz, Han,\nment of physiological measures in addition to the extant psy-\nchological scales may endorse accuracy and reliability in the\nassessment of PTSD among first responders (Orr & Roth,\nphysiological measures (HR, skin conductance, and electro-\nmyogram) and contrasted them with the Clinician-\nAdministered PTSD Scale (CAPS) in assessing a group of\nparticipants (n = 46) diagnosed with PTSD at the beginning\nof treatment and 6 months posttreatment. Their results indi-\ncated a significant association between physiological mea-\nsures and CAPS.\nPTSD and Psychophysiology: Cortisol Hormone\nResearch indicated that hypothalamus\u00adpituitary\u00adadrenal\n(HPA) axis dysregulation--hence cortisol secretion abnor-\nmality--is associated with numerous psychological disorders\n(Johnson, Kamilaris, Chrousos, & Gold, 1992; Tsigos &\nChrousos, 1996). Furthermore, chronic fatigue syndrome,\nPTSD, and depressive symptomatology were found to be\nrelated to cortisol level dysregulation (Morgan et al., 2000;\nTsigos & Chrousos, 1996); that is, cortisol dysregulation is\nindicative of what McEwen (2000) referred to as \"allostatic\nload,\" a condition that manifests as a maladaptive response to\ntrauma exposure. In this direction, other research findings\nsuggested that cortisol secretion abnormality is also associ-\nated with immune system dysregulation, which increases the\nrisk of a number of diseases (i.e., vulnerability to influenza\nvirus and infectious illnesses; Padgett & Glaser, 2003; Wirth\net al., 2011). In their systematic review article, Chida and\nSteptoe (2009) found that the cortisol awakening response\n(CAR) phenomenon was positively associated with job stress\nand general life stress. Therefore, individuals occupied in\nhighly stressful professions (i.e., elite athletes, soldiers;\nMorgan et al., 2001; Skoluda, Dettenborn, Stalder, &\nKirschbaum, 2012) and specific population groups who expe-\nrience extreme stress and trauma (i.e., veterans; Baker et al.,\n6 SAGE Open\n2005) have elevated CAR values compared with the general\npopulation. Various stressors over one's daily life may induce\nelevated cortisol levels (Chida and Steptoe, 2009; Dickerson\n& Kemeny, 2004), that is, stress reactivity cortisol levels.\nAnalytically, when an individual perceives a stressor--either\nphysical or psychological--the hypothalamus produces the\ncorticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), which then leads to\nthe synthesis of the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)\nby the pituitary gland, which, in turn, stimulates the adrenal\ncortex to release cortisol (Shalev et al., 2009).\nResearch with PTSD-diagnosed individuals inferred that\ncortisol dysregulation and PTSD are closely associated (Dekel,\nEin-Dor, Gordon, Rosen, & Bonanno, 2013; McFarlane,\nspecifically, PTSD-diagnosed individuals manifested sup-\npressed diurnal cortisol levels (Yehuda, Halligan, Golier,\nGrossman, & Bierer, 2004). The inexorable relationship\nbetween cortisol dysregulation and PTSD is emphasized by\nYehuda and Golier (2009) who argued that\nit is often stated that cortisol-related alternations in PTSD are\n\"controversial.\" It is perhaps more accurate to conclude that\nsuch alterations have not always been detected; perhaps\nreflecting that cortisol levels are dynamic and subject to a large\ndegree of measurement error and individual variation. (p. 1113)\nObservational studies with first responders (Witteveen et al.,\nshowed that both first responders and veterans who partici-\npated in the studies had \"flat-like\" diurnal cortisol patterns\ncompared with the regular ones. Analogously, Neylan and\ncolleagues (2005) studied police officers (n = 30) exposed to\na traumatic incident, and their findings showed the significant\nrelationship between elevated CAR and PTSD. Conversely,\nin their study with police officers (n = 100) diagnosed with\nPTSD (mild, moderate, and severe type of PTSD), Violanti\nand colleagues (2007) contended that an association between\nPTSD and cortisol dysregulation existed among their study\nparticipants. They also found that officers diagnosed with\nsevere PTSD symptomatology manifested elevated CAR.\nTheir findings come in contradiction with other studies in this\narea; however, Violanti and colleagues (2007) interpreted\ntheir findings on the grounds that police trauma--as opposed\nto other traumatized groups previously studied--is multifac-\neted, chronic, and complex; yet, research knowledge of the\nbiological impact of trauma or threat on police officers is still\nlimited. However, it is argued that HPA axis dysregulation--\nprior to trauma exposure--seems to be a predictor in the\npathogenesis of PTSD following traumatic experience\nies with police officers demonstrated that short-term after-\nnoon or night shift employment is associated with lower CAR\n(Wirth et al., 2011); in addition, lower CAR before exposure\nto a potentially traumatic incident was associated with post-\ntrauma negative moods, anxiety symptoms, and physiological\nreactivity (HR and skin conductance) among police officers\nand firefighters (Pineles et al., 2013). Randomized clinical tri-\nals (RCTs) with individuals diagnosed with PTSD--and also\nwith those who manifested lower cortisol levels before treat-\nment--indicated that PTSD psychotherapy treatment (brief\neclectic) was effective in increasing cortisol levels among\nthose who received the treatment (Olff, de Vries, G\u00fczelcan,\nAssies, & Gersons, 2007). Analogous outcomes (RCT) were\nfound with mindfulness-based treatment delivered to veterans\ndiagnosed with PTSD compared with those who participated\nin the control group (Bergen-Cico, Possemato, & Pigeon,\n2014). However, Gerardi, Rothbaum, Astin, and Kelley\n(2010) reported that prolonged exposure therapy or eye\nmovement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) treat-\nment significantly reduced elevated cortisol levels among\nrape victims diagnosed with PTSD. The aforementioned\nresearch findings indicate the effectiveness of PTSD evi-\ndence-based treatment in significantly reducing HPA (and\ncortisol) dysregulation.\nCognitive\u00adBehavioral Therapy (CBT):\nAn Overview\nCBT was developed as a psychotherapeutic approach in the\nlate 1950s by Albert Ellis, who developed the rational-emo-\ntive therapy (RET), and Aaron Beck, who developed cogni-\ntive therapy (CT; Corey, 2008). Ellis argued that the\nphilosophic origins of RET can be traced back to the writ-\nings of Stoic philosophers and, more specifically, the work\nof Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius who believed that indi-\nviduals are not disturbed by events per se but by the way\nthey view the events around them (Corey, 2008). Based on\nthe previously mentioned assumptions of CBT, clients are\nencouraged to identify, dispute, and constructively change\nany thoughts, beliefs, assumptions, and emotions that seem\nto cause distress in their lives (Rector, 2010). Such dis-\ntorted assumptions or core beliefs may be related--but not\nlimited--to all-or-nothing thinking (e.g., if she calls me she\nloves me or if she does not she hates me), overgeneraliza-\ntion (e.g., the world is against me), and catastrophizing\n(e.g., there is no future for me). The major role of the CBT\ntherapist is to help her or his client target and evaluate the\ndistorted automatic thoughts or core beliefs related to cer-\nhuman beings are often trapped in the horrific context of\nthe irrational \"shoulds\" and \"musts\" (\"Must-arbation\"),\nand the therapist's role is to dispute the client's irrational\nbeliefs and help them transform irrational beliefs into ratio-\nnal ones. Taking into consideration that distorted beliefs\nabout specific situations are associated with (negative)\nemotions and behavioral patterns, any positive change of\nthe distorted beliefs may lead to positive emotional and\nadaptive behavioral patterns within a subjectively \"prob-\nlematic\" situation for the client (Corey, 2008). Therefore,\nPapazoglou 7\nCBT sets a goal-oriented, teleological, problem-focused,\nwell-structured--in the here and now--approach, which\nalso focuses on therapeutic alliance and rapport between\nthe CBT therapist and the client (Rector, 2010).\nCBT: An Evidence-Based PTSD Treatment\nA simple search on Google Scholar about the CBT treatment\nfor PTSD leads to more than 18,800 results for published\narticles, training materials, and commentaries related to the\ntopic. In PTSD treatment, CBT has been identified as one of\nthe most effective approaches (Koucky, Dickstein, & Chard,\n2013) and is argued by many to complement pharmacother-\napy for PTSD symptomatology reduction (Ramirez-Basco,\nGlickman, Weatherford, & Ryser, 2000). In their systematic\nreview of the literature on the efficacy of the CBT treatment\nfor PTSD, Harvey, Bryant, and Tarrier (2003) found that\nCBT proved to be effective in helping individuals who had\nsurvived traumatic situations (assault, terrorism, traffic acci-\ndents, refugees, child abuse) as well as in helping survivors\nstruggling with multiple PTSD symptoms: improved social\nadjustment, decreased catastrophic cognitions, reduced\navoidance, better quality of sleep, decreased muscle tension,\nand decreased hypersensitivity. Trauma-focused CBT (or\nCBT-PTSD) can be alternatively delivered in the form of\nweb-based therapy and/or telemedicine to clients residing in\nremote areas with limited access to a CBT therapist (Foa,\nGillihan, & Bryant, 2013).Analogously, research has showed\nthat returning veterans were amenable to PTSD treatment\nand achieved PTSD symptoms' reduction after the delivery\nof a brief CBT intervention (one session) via telephone\n(Stecker, McHugo, Xie, Whyman, & Jones, 2014). Another\nstudy examined the effectiveness of CBT group therapy (6\nweeks) in helping military personnel (n = 496) suffering\nfrom PTSD; the study outcomes demonstrated that PTSD\nsymptomatology reduction was effective during follow-up\nassessments (3, 6, and 12 months postintake; Khoo, Dent, &\nOei, 2011). The trauma-focused CBT approach has been\neffectively applied to different victims/survivors of trauma,\nsuch as rape survivors (Jaycox, Zoellner, & Foa, 2002), New\nYork City Transit employees (Lowinger & Rombom, 2012),\npsychotic patients who have experienced PTSD (Callcott,\nviolence trauma survivors (Iverson et al., 2011), and survi-\nvors of the 2005 London bombings (Wilson, d'Ardenne,\nScott, Fine, & Priebe, 2012). From an international perspec-\ntive, Kagoo, Suh, and Naidoo (2004) reported that all their\nparticipants considered CBT as an appropriate treatment for\ntheir traumatized clients in their training work with South\nAfrican trauma therapists.\nIn their RCT with adult female survivors of childhood\ntheir participants in CBT, into present-centered therapy\n(PCT), and wait-listed (WL) condition. In their 6-month fol-\nlow-up assessment with the CAPS, they found that 76.5% of\nthe CBT group participants had no PTSD symptomatology\nand that the CBT group was superior to the WL group. In\nanother RCT with patients who experienced PTSD due to\nsevere motor vehicle crash, Wu, Li, and Cho (2014) random-\nized their participants (n = 60) in a CBT and self-help pro-\ngram (SHP) group. In a 6-month follow-up, they found that\nthe patients from the CBT group had significantly decreased\ntheir anxiety symptoms, their depressive symptoms, their\nintrusive thoughts, and their hyperarousal compared with the\nSHP group patients. Similar results have been found with\nother RCTs with veterans who experienced military sexual\ntrauma (CBT group vs. PCT group), showing the high effec-\ntiveness of CBT trauma-focused treatment compared with\nother treatments (Sur\u00eds, Link-Malcolm, Chard, Ahn, &\nNorth, 2013). Furthermore, an RCT of CBT-PTSD treatment\nfor severely mentally ill patients showed that the CBT group\nwas more effective compared with the control group in\nCAPS score (PTSD symptomatology) and depressive symp-\ntoms reduction.\nFrom an international perspective, an RCT for war-\naffected Congolese boys (n = 50) showed that the CBT group\nhad a significant PTSD symptomatology reduction--com-\npared with the control group--at the end of the treatment pro-\ngram (McMullen, O'Callaghan, Shannon, Black, & Eakin,\n2013). In a very similar study with war-affected Congolese\ngirls, researchers found significant reduction in trauma symp-\ntoms between the CBT and the WL group (O'Callaghan,\nMcMullen, Shannon, Rafferty, & Black, 2013). Other RCT\nstudies showed significant effectiveness of CBT-PTSD treat-\nmentwithregardtothefollowingminoritygroups:Cambodian\nrefugees (Hinton, Hofmann, Pollack, & Otto, 2009), Latino\nwomen (Hinton, Hofmann, Rivera, Otto, & Pollack, 2011),\nVietnamese refugees (Hinton et al., 2004), and Black females\nDiscussion: What Is Missing?\nIn a study conducted by Becker et al. (2009) with first\nresponders (n = 379) from a southern state of the United\nStates, participants were asked to identify their preference\nfor psychotherapeutic treatment in a potential situation from\nwhich they might experience PTSD. What is interesting is\nthat almost 90% of the participants chose CBT as their first\nor second most preferred treatment compared with other\noffered treatments (e.g., pharmacological, brief eclectic,\nEMDR). Nevertheless, as Flannery (2015) argued, \"research\non the treatment interventions of first responders has been\nlimited\" (p. 261). Literature in the area of CBT-PTSD treat-\nment for first responders is sparse; researchers have con-\nducted case studies examining the effectiveness of CBT\ntreatment in one police officer diagnosed with PTSD (Tolin\n& Foa, 1999) and chronic PTSD (Cornelius & Kenyon-\nJump, 2007). What is noteworthy is that there are almost no\nRCTs of CBT treatments for PTSD among first responders\nand, hence, the effectiveness of CBT in reducing PTSD\n8 SAGE Open\nsymptomatology among first responders is unknown (Harvey\ntematic review of the literature, Haugen et al. (2012)\nattempted to identify RCTs for PTSD among first respond-\ners; researchers inferred that from the 845 peer-reviewed\narticles found, only two--equal to 0.002% of all the stud-\nies--were RCTs of PTSD treatment among first responders.\nFollowing the abovementioned systematic review, from\nthose two RCTs found, the first (Gersons, Carlier, Lamberts,\n& van der Kolk, 2000) examined the effectiveness of brief\neclectic therapy (EBT) delivered to police officers (n = 42)\nand the second one (Difede et al., 2007) explored the effec-\ntiveness of a 12-week CBT treatment program delivered to\ndisaster workers who responded to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\nTo date, there are no RCTs to study the effectiveness of CBT-\nPTSD treatment for first responders using psychophysiologi-\ncal assessment. In this direction, Lindauer and colleagues\n(2006) have attempted to psychophysiologically assess the\nefficacy of script-driven imagery for individuals diagnosed\nwith PTSD. However, a considerable limitation of their study\nis that police officer participants (n = 15) were only exam-\nined in the pretest phase because they all discontinued their\nresearch participation.\nNevertheless, some scholars and professionals may argue\nthat police and military tasks are quite overlapping. For\ninstance, in both fields, military personnel as well as first\nresponders are mandated to respond to critical incident situa-\ntions and most--if not all--of the times the danger against\ntheir own lives is omnipresent. Thereby, one may contend that\nthe evidence-based outcomes of CBT-PTSD treatment among\nmilitary soldiers and veterans may give us enough evidence\nthat the effectiveness of CBT-PTSD treatment is also perva-\nsive among first responders. At this point, the author posits\nthat first responders' work is unique and in many ways dis-\ntinct from military mission. CBT-PTSD treatment may be\neffective for--most--first responders and, hence, after the\nsuccessful completion of CBT-PTSD treatment, they may not\nexperience any PTSD-related symptomatology. Nonetheless,\nthe author contends that what distinguishes first responders\nfrom military personnel and other populations is that first\nresponders may have significant elevated risk to relapse to\nPTSD after successful completion of CBT-PTSD treatment.\nThe last assumption is emanated from the fact that first\nresponders'work is singular and distinct from that of military.\nAfter successful completion of CBT-PTSD treatment, first\nresponders are expected to return to the line of duty and,\nhence, they are mandated to respond to critical incident situa-\ntions. Undeniably, some of those critical incident situations\nare expected to be life-threatening ones. The challenging--\nand even iconoclastic for the traditional PTSD treatment tra-\nditions--query may be the following: Is CBT-PTSD treatment\nsufficient enough so that it effectively prevents PTSD relapse\namong first responders, who returned to the line of duty after\nsuccessful completion of CBT-PTSD treatment? In addition,\nis PTSD psychosocial assessment a sufficient indicator of\nfirst responders' readiness to return to the line of duty after\ncompletion of CBT-PTSD treatment? Currently, there is no\nevidence-based finding that would provide us with substan-\ntial answer to the previous questions. For instance, Longmore\nand Worrell (2007) highlighted the scarcity of data that cogni-\ntive change in CBT treatment is the one that leads to symp-\ntomatic improvement. This last challenging perspective\n(cognitive change during CBT treatment) may be even more\npervasive among first responders because their cognitive\nfunctioning in the line of duty is incumbent to the rationale of\nbeing alert and well-prepared to respond. Literature showed\nthat various populations (i.e., incarcerated women, veterans)\nwho successfully completed CBT-PTSD treatment relapsed\nin a certain period of time after completion of treatment\ntheir systematic review of the efficacy of prolonged exposure\ntherapy among anxiety disorder\u00addiagnosed clients, Craske\nand colleagues (2008) emphasized the salient role of measur-\ning physiological reactivity as a way to assess efficacy of\ntreatment outcomes. What is also essential is that Craske and\ncolleagues (2008) contended that physiological measurement\nshould not be restricted to one variable specifically (e.g.,\nHR); instead, it should include more than one physiological\nreactivity variables (e.g., HRV, skin conductance, cortisol), so\nthat researchers employ a more holistic approach in the way\nthey measure the psychophysiological efficacy of prolonged\nexposure treatment in clients diagnosed with anxiety-related\ndisorders. Consequently, it is paramount that we study the\npsychophysiology of those first responders who may not be\ntreated successfully by CBT-PTSD treatment as well as those\nfirst responders who--even though completed CBT-PTSD\ntreatment successfully--have relapsed to PTSD symptom-\natology after return to the line of duty.\nConclusion: Recommendations for\nFuture Research\nThe introductory section illustrates the complexity and\ncumulative form of trauma experienced by first responders in\nthe line of duty. As it was mentioned, trauma exposure may\nlead first responders to the onset of PTSD, among other\nsevere mental and physical health issues. Nevertheless,\npolice organizations invest millions of dollars to make sure\nthat first responders receive the highest quality of training,\nadvanced technological equipment, and other necessary\nmeans to efficiently maintain peace and order in the com-\nmunities they serve (Andersen et al., 2015). However, first\nresponders' efficacy in the workplace may be thwarted by\ncomplex mental health issues, such as PTSD. To this end,\nmany scholars have emphasized on the efficacy of trauma\nprevention and resilience promotion programs that may sup-\nport first responders' mental preparedness in the face of\nadversities (e.g., Andersen et al., 2015; Skeffington, Rees,\nMazzucchelli, & Kane, 2016). That is, it is essential that\nmost organizations invest on first responders' training and\nPapazoglou 9\nequipment; however, author suggests that organizational\ninvestment with additional funds and resources for first\nresponders' mental preparedness (e.g., trauma preventative\ntraining) should also be prioritized as a way to equip first\nresponders against the risk to develop PTSD and other\ncomorbid disorders.\nOne of the challenges that should be highlighted is first\nresponders'reintegration back into the operational units after\nCBT-PTSD treatment completion. The author suggests that\nfuture research should also emphasize on first responders'\nreintegration procedures and develop evidence-based prac-\ntices that can facilitate first responders' reintegration in their\nagencies. For instance, would a police detective be ready to\nreturn to his previous tasks right after successful completion\nof CBT-PTSD treatment? Perhaps, this kind of reintegration\nprocedure needs to occur gradually until both health profes-\nsionals and high-ranking managers feel confident that detec-\ntive is fully prepared to return to the previous position. That\nis, mental health professionals (e.g., psychiatrists, psycholo-\ngists, mental health counselors) are expected to work closely\nwith agencies' high-ranking managers to facilitate reintegra-\ntion procedures (e.g., assessments on a systematic basis)\nthrough a multidisciplinary collaboration. The Israeli mili-\ntary has developed exemplary policy programs that assist\nsoldiers who experience PTSD to attend adequate treatment\nprograms and then return back to their service successfully\n(Cobb, 2013). Toward this direction, Israeli military has\ndeveloped army-based psychoeducation programs to destig-\nmatize the experience of PTSD in the military and also estab-\nlished \"mental health gyms\" that allow mental health\nprofessionals to be present in the military training arenas and\nunits so that resilience promotion prioritized (Cobb, 2013).\nFurthermore, research with U.S. combat veterans indicated\nthat awareness of PTSD-related early help seeking might\nprevent the incapacitating impact of PTSD on veterans'\nhealth (Mittal et al., 2013). Such practices may be transferred\nand applied to first responders' agencies. For instance, men-\ntal health professionals may train high-ranking managers as\nwell as first responders to identify cues that indicate the pres-\nence of PTSD symptomatology. That way, help seeking can\nbe better coordinated and CBT-PTSD treatment be more effi-\ncient if provided in early stages of PTSD development\n(Adler, Bliese, McGurk, Hoge, & Castro, 2009; Ehlers et al.,\nHowever, if first responders diagnosed with PTSD remain\nuntreated, they will be unable to properly provide their ser-\nvices and the government's expenditures for first responders'\npreparedness and training will be in vain; that is, PTSD pre-\ncludes them from properly providing their services. Even\nthough CBT has been proved to be effective in treating\nPTSD, research--especially RCTs--in examining the effi-\ncacy of CBT in ameliorating PTSD symptomatology among\nfirst responders is sparse. The current article aimed to intro-\nduce an innovative idea: Specifically, it attempted to discuss\na synthesis of psychological and physiological measures so\nthat the CBT-PTSD effectiveness among first responders is\nexamined and justified via empirical research. Finally, the\nauthor hopes that the present article will draw attention to the\nnecessity of future empirical research in relation to psycho-\nphysiological improvement among first responders who\nreceive CBT-PTSD treatment.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAdler, A.
