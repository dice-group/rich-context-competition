As a result, the purpose of this study was to examine psychosocial risk\nfactors for purging for weight control in a nationally representative sample of adolescents. Data were extracted\nfrom the restricted-use data sets of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Waves I-III), selecting\nfemales with valid demographic and purging information (N = 5,670).\nResults: The prevalence of purging was 0.88% at Wave II and 0.56% at Wave III. In multivariable multinomial logistic\nregressions, purging at Wave II was predicted by parental poverty and low levels of self-esteem at Wave I; purging\nat Wave III was predicted by body mass index and the frequency of delinquent behaviors at Wave I.\nConclusions: Individuals with high body mass index, individuals with low self-esteem, and individuals in families\nexperiencing economic hardship appear specifically at risk for the development of purging behaviors in later years\nand may benefit from more targeted prevention efforts.\n",

Experts have also noted, however,\nthat the research is limited by the dearth of prospective\nstudies with samples large enough to detect small or\nmedium sized effects, the inclusion of demographically\nlimited samples, and the lack of follow-up periods that\nare long enough to fully capture the period of develop-\nment when the risk of the onset of eating disorder symp-\ntoms is highest [1,2].\nThe present study focused on purging (vomiting or\nabusing laxatives) to lose weight or keep from gaining\nweight as a clinically relevant symptom and as a possible\nproxy for the presence of an eating disorder. Purging\nbehaviors have received increasing scientific attention\nnot only in the context of a full syndrome eating dis-\norder but also as symptoms of clinical relevance in their\nown right [3-5]. Only a few studies have explored risk\nfactors for purging using longitudinal designs, and most\nof these studies have focused on just one risk factor. For\nexample, two studies of adolescent girls found that eat-\ning dinner [6] or eating meals with their families [7] was\nassociated with a decreased risk for onset of purging or\nextreme weight control behaviors.\nDue to skip patterns used in most epidemiological\nstudies of adults, information about purging behaviors\ntypically was collected only in individuals who scored\npositively on the core symptom of anorexia nervosa (re-\nfusal to maintain a minimum adequate body weight) or\nbulimia nervosa (recurrent episodes of purging and\nbinge eating) [8]. In contrast, studies of adolescents typ-\nically have measured disordered eating symptoms among\nall participants, thus affording the opportunity to ex-\nplore correlates of these behaviors.

For example, in a community sample of\nincidence of purging was 1.3% in girls and 0.3% in boys\n[6]. In a school-based sample of over 2,500 boys and\ngirls, \"extreme weight control behaviors\" (which in-\ncluded purging) were also reported to be more common\nin girls than boys [10]. The present study capitalized\nupon the availability of data collected as part of the\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add\nHealth), which affords the unique opportunity to exam-\nine the prevalence and incidence of, as well as risk fac-\ntors for, purging in a nationally representative sample of\nUnited States' (US) youth. Because of the low base rate\nof males who purged in our sample (only 0.55% of young\nmen reported purging at any wave of study whereas\n1.96% of young women reported purging), we excluded\nmale participants from our sample.\nOur approach to and selection of potential risk factors\nwas informed by Kraemer and colleagues' conceptual\nframework and by a corresponding review paper of the\nempirical studies of risk factors for eating disorders\n[2,11]. Specifically, to test whether a variable confers risk\n(rather than merely representing a correlate), data are\nneeded that were either collected prior to occurrence of\nthe behavior or are of a nature where one may reason-\nably infer that, even when collected after occurrence, the\ndata are not contaminated by the outcome in question\n(e.g., gender, race/ethnicity). Therefore, in our study, we\ndefined occurrence, or \"incidence cases\", as participants\nwho reported purging at a subsequent wave of study,\ncontrolling for purging behaviors at Wave I. Given our\ninterest in identifying adolescent risk factors for purging,\nwe limited our sample to adolescent girls who, at study\nentry (Wave I), were age 18 or younger.\nOur study included a considerable range of potential\nadolescent risk factors including demographic variables,\nearly onset menarche, body image concerns, adverse\nchildhood experiences, coping, and health or mental\nhealth problems [2]. We hypothesized that, after control-\nling for age, race, parental education, and purging at\nWave I, higher scores on each of these risk factor con-\nstructs (and, in the case of self-esteem, lower scores)\nwould confer greater risk for the occurrence of purging\nbehaviors in young adult women.\nMethods\nParticipants\nThe sample comprised 5,670 female participants whose\ndata were extracted from the restricted-use Add Health\nAmerican adolescents starting in grades 7\u00ad12 over the\ncourse of fourteen years, with four waves of data collection\nthroughout this time period (Wave IV did not collect data\nabout purging and, therefore, was not used for the present\nstudy). The initial sample was established by sampling\nstudents from 132 schools in the United States. Due to\noversampling of some population subgroups, Add Health\ninvestigators developed sampling weights to be used in\nstatistical analyses so findings can be generalized to be rep-\nresentative for region, urbanicity, and ethnicity. Further de-\ntails about the Add Health study design can be found\nInclusion criteria for the present study were those par-\nticipants who were reported as female at all three waves\n(in a few instances, gender information was not consistent\nacross study waves), had valid age information, were age\n18 or younger at Wave I, reported responses to purging\nbehaviors at Wave I, and had valid data required for apply-\ning sampling weights (see Data Analysis section). Of the\nmet the inclusion criteria required for our analyses (54%\nWave I sample, 75% of Wave II sample, and 71% of Wave\nIII sample). Most of the girls that we excluded did not\nhave information needed for applying sample weights at\nall waves. However, because we used the sample weights\ndeveloped by Add Health in our statistical models to ac-\ncount for attrition and oversampling, our findings are rep-\nresentative of young women in the United States.\nabout one-third (30.97%) of the weighted sample was\nnon-White. Highest parental education was reported by\nparticipants' parents or guardians as follows: less than\nhigh school, 11.65%; high school diploma or equivalent,\nmore, 33.87%. All results reflect adjustment for sampling\nInstruments and procedures\nThe Add Health survey measures a wide range of psy-\nchological and physical health issues and behaviors, a\nsubset of which was used in this study. Some constructs\n(e.g., depressive symptoms) were measured using un-\nequal numbers of items across waves; in such cases, we\nfollowed the practice of prior investigators of using only\nthose items that were administered in all three waves,\nand we calculated Cronbach's alpha based on the un-\nweighted sample included in the present study.\nBecause, by definition, exposure to a risk factor must\noccur prior to occurrence of the dependent variable of\ninterest, predictor variables collected at Wave I were\nused to investigate purging at Wave II and Wave III.\nAttention-deficit hyperactivity symptoms and childhood\nabuse were the only predictor variables used in this\nstudy that were collected at Wave III, as they were mea-\nsured retrospectively at Wave III with a focus on experi-\nencing them in early childhood.\nhttp://www.jeatdisord.com/content/2/1/1\nDemographic information\nFollowing work by Brown and colleagues, [15] partici-\npants' self-reported race/ethnicity was coded into a\nbinary variable representing White vs. non-White, and\nhighest parental education achieved by either parent or\nadult guardian was coded as an ordinal variable repre-\nsenting less than high school, high school or equivalent,\nsome college, and college graduate or postgraduate edu-\ncation. Age was recorded as age at last birthday. (Age at\nWave I needed to be calculated because only birth year\nand birth month were available in Wave I. To calculate\nage, information given on birth date was subtracted\nfrom date of interview).\nBody image and eating behaviors\nBody Mass Index (BMI) was calculated by dividing\nweight (in pounds) by the product of height (in inches)\nsquared times the value 703 [16]. Weight perception was\nmeasured using a single item \"How do you think of\nyourself in terms of weight?\" with response choices ran-\nging from \"1 = very underweight\" to \"5 = very overweight\".\nPurging status was determined based on participants' re-\nsponses to the question of whether, in the past 7 days, the\nparticipant had been trying to lose or maintain weight. If\nthe respondent answered yes, Add Health asked a series\nof follow up questions to determine what method the in-\ndividuals were using to lose or maintain weight. Partici-\npants could select multiple options that were provided,\nincluding diet, exercise, vomiting, diet pill use, laxative\nuse, or other. Those who reported that they had, in the\nlast 7 days, tried to lose or maintain weight through the\nuse of vomiting and/or laxative misuse were coded as pur-\nging. Questions did not address frequency of occurrence.\nDiet pill use in the absence of purging was coded as\npresent if respondents reported use of diet pills but denied\nvomiting or laxative use.\nClassification of participants as current purgers\nA three-level polyotomous variable was created to clas-\nsify current purging. The first group was comprised of\nparticipants who did not report purging at either Wave\nII or Wave III. The second group was comprised of\nthose reported purging at Wave II. Finally, all individuals\nwho did not report purging at Wave II but did report\npurging at Wave III were coded into the third group. A\nsmall number of individuals reported purging at both\nWaves II and III (0.04% of the weighted sample), and\nwere placed into the Wave II group.\nReproductive health related variables\nEarly onset menarche was coded as present in girls\nreporting having their first menstrual period before age\n11 years [17]. Pregnancy was coded as present if the re-\nspondent reported having been pregnant, including any\npregnancy that ended in abortion, stillbirth, miscarriage,\nor live birth after which the baby died.\nSelf-esteem\nFour questions based on Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale\n[18] were used to measure self-esteem, including \"You\nhave many good qualities\", \"You have much to be proud\nof\", \"You like yourself just the way you are\", and \"You\nfeel you are doing things just right\". Participants rated\neach item on a scale from 1 to 5, and, consistent with\nKort-Butler et al., [19] a total score was calculated by\nadding across the items, where higher numbers indicate\nhigher self-esteem. (Cronbach's alpha = 0.80).\nActive coping\nFour questions were used to measure active coping, in-\ncluding \"When you have a problem to solve, the first\nthing you do is get as many facts about the problem as\npossible\", \"When you are attempting to find a solution\nto a problem, you usually try to think of as many differ-\nent ways to approach the problem as possible\", \"When\nmaking decisions, you generally use systematic methods\nfor judging and comparing alternatives\", and \"After carry-\ning out a solution to a problem, you usually try to analyze\nwhat went right and what went wrong\". Each item was\nrated on a scale from 1 to 5; a total score was created by\nsumming across the items, and higher scores reflected\nmore active coping. [15] (Cronbach's alpha = 0.75).\nMental health related variables\nDepressive symptoms were measured using a modified ver-\nsion of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression\n(CES-D) scale [20]. Participants rated symptom frequency\nin the past week on a scale from 0 (never or rarely) to 3\n(most of the time). In the present study we used the\nnine items that were asked at all three waves, and cre-\nated a total score for Wave I. [21] (Cronbach's alpha =\n0.81). In addition, participants were asked, \"During the\nlast 12 months, how many times did you actually at-\ntempt suicide?\" A binary variable (attempted suicide)\nwas created contrasting those who had not attempted\nsuicide during the past 12 months with those who had\nattempted suicide one or more times. Participants were\nasked (no/yes) whether, in the past 12 months, they had\n\"received psychological or emotional counseling\" (psy-\nchological counseling). Attention-deficit/hyperactivity\nDisorder (ADHD) was measured in Wave III. Partici-\npants were asked to \"Think back to when you were be-\ntween 5 and 12 years of age. For each of the following\nstatements, which answer best describes your behavior\nwhen you were that age?\" A list of all but one of the symp-\ntoms for ADHD as described in the 4th edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders\n(DSM-IV) [22] was then presented, and participants rated\nhttp://www.jeatdisord.com/content/2/1/1\nhow frequently the symptoms were experienced (\"never\nor rarely\", \"sometimes\", \"often\", or \"very often\"). The\nimpulsivity symptom \"often interrupts or intrudes on\nothers\" was not measured in Add Health. Consistent with\nMcClernon and colleagues, [23] each symptom was coded\nas present if the frequency rating was \"often\" or \"very\noften\". Two severity subscales were created by summing\nthe nine binary inattention symptoms (ADHD-IN; Cron-\nbach's alpha = 0. 80) and the eight binary hyperactivity-\nimpulsivity items (ADHD-HI; Cronbach's alpha = 0.72).\nDelinquency\nSeven questions measuring delinquent behavior were\navailable at each wave. Specifically, participants were\nasked \"In the past 12 months, how often did you: (1) dam-\nage property that didn't belong to you; (2) steal something\nworth more than $50; (3) go into a house or building to\nsteal something; (4) use or threaten to use a weapon to get\nsomething from someone; (5) sell marijuana or other\ndrugs; (6) steal something worth less than $50; (7) take\npart in a fight where a group of your friends was against\nanother group\". Consistent with previous studies, re-\nsponses to each individual question were dichotomized by\nrecoding the original 4-point Likert format (never, one or\ntwo times, three or four times, five times or more) into\nnever versus  1. The recoded items were then summed,\ngenerating a Delinquency Scale total score with a range\nfrom 0 to 7. [24] The reliability of this scale was modest\nChildhood adversity\nFamily poverty was measured using a parent's responses\nto three questions (no = 0, yes = 1): receiving public as-\nsistance, aid to families with dependent children, or food\nstamps; responses were summed for a total family poverty\nscore with higher scores indicating greater economic\nhardship (Cronbach's alpha = 0.86). Binary variables were\ncreated indicating whether the participant had experi-\nenced these events for at least one parent: never lived with\nparent and parental death. In Wave III, participants were\nasked to retrospectively report (no/yes) whether, before\nthe 6th grade, they had experienced childhood abuse\n(from parents or other adult caretakers): \"not taking care\nof your basic needs, such as keeping you clean or provid-\ning food and clothing?\" (childhood neglect) or \"slapped,\nhit or kicked you?\" (childhood physical abuse).\nData analysis\nAll data analyses were performed using Stata 12.1 [24].\nAs part of Add Health's survey design, certain demo-\ngraphic subgroups were sampled with unequal probability.\nIn order to generate nationally representative estimates,\ntherefore, Add Health investigators developed a weighting\nsystem which includes a stratum variable to adjust for\ngeographic stratification, a cluster variable to adjust for\nthe primary sampling unit (PSU; i.e. the school identifier),\nand a weight variable (using Wave III weights) to adjust\nfor the oversampling of certain demographic characteris-\ntics within each PSU [13,25]. All analyses and estimates\nwere performed using the weighted sample.\nFor each hypothesized risk or protective factor, multi-\nnomial logistic regression analysis was conducted, adjust-\ning for the potentially confounding effects of age, race,\nparental education, and purging at Wave I. In the next\nstep, a multivariable multinomial regression model was\ntested including only those risk or protective factors that\nhad been shown to significantly differ (p < 0.05) between\nany two groups within the univariable comparisons.\nResults\nPrevalence and incidence of purging across the three\nwaves\nUnweighted frequencies and weighted proportions for\npurging are provided in Table 1. Regarding the weighted\nsample, the prevalence of purging was 0.40% at Wave I.\nThe prevalence of current purging, as it was defined\nRisk factors for the development of current purging\nAs shown in Table 2, among the variables pertaining to\nbody image and eating behavior, overweight self-perception\nwas found to be significantly associated with purging at\nWave II: a significantly higher percentage of young women\nwith purging at Wave II reported that they felt overweight\nat Wave I compared to those who were not purging at\nWave II. Purgers at Waves II and III had significantly\nhigher BMI at Wave I. However, BMI at Wave I did not\npredict differences in the likelihood of purging between\nWaves II and III. Using diet pills as weight control was not\nTable 1 Sample demographic characteristics (n = 5670)\nVariable N Unweighted % Weighted %\nPurging occurrence,\nWave II\nPurging occurrence,\nWave III\nRace Other Than\nWhite\nEducation\nUnweighted\nmean\nUnweighted SD\n1Weighted descriptives unavailable for quantitative variables.\nhttp://www.jeatdisord.com/content/2/1/1\nTable 2 Association of risk and protective factors with likelihood of purging at Waves II and III\nVariable Purging behavior Coefficient Std. error p-value CI\nhttp://www.jeatdisord.com/content/2/1/1\nassociated with purging at Waves II or III, nor was early-\nonset menarche or teenage pregnancy.\nSeveral significant effects were found in the mental\nhealth domain. Those who purged at Wave II had lower\nlevels of self-esteem at Wave I; interestingly, those who\npurged at Wave III had higher levels of self-esteem at\nWave I than those who purged at Wave II, but self-\nesteem was not associated with purging at Wave III.\nHigher scores on the depressive symptom scale at Wave\nI were significantly associated with purging at Wave II\nas well as purging at Wave III. Those who purged at\nWave II were more likely to have attempted suicide, re-\nceived psychological counseling, or engaged in delin-\nquent behaviors at Wave I. Regarding the measures of\nADHD symptoms, no significant associations were found\nfor the inattentiveness scale; however, participants who\npurged at Wave II high higher levels of hyperactivity/im-\npulsiveness at Wave I than those who did not. Finally, no\nsignificant relationships were found regarding the active\ncoping scale variable.\nOf the measures of childhood adversity, having never\nlived with one (or both) parent (s) and parental poverty\nwere associated with an increased likelihood of purging\nat Wave II. Not eating with parents, losing a parent to\ndeath, childhood neglect, and childhood physical abuse\nwere not significantly associated with purging.\nTable 3 shows the multivariable multinomial regres-\nsion model that included only variables that had a sig-\nnificant relationship with purging at Wave II and/or\nWave III. In this model, suicide attempts, body image,\ndepression symptoms, hyperactivity, having psycho-\nlogical counseling, and never having lived with one or\nboth parents were not significantly associated with pur-\nging at either wave.\nHowever, parental poverty and self-esteem were asso-\nciated with an increased likelihood of purging at Wave\nII. Specifically, those who purged at Wave II had higher\nlevels of parental poverty and lower self-esteem. BMI\nwas not significantly associated with purging at Wave II,\nbut those who purged at Wave III had significantly\nhigher BMI levels at Wave I.\nContrary to what we had hypothesized, it was found\nthat those who purged at Wave III had significantly\nlower rates of delinquent behavior at Wave I. Addition-\nally, those who purged at Wave III had lower rates of de-\nlinquency than those who purged at Wave II.\nDiscussion\nThe overall aim of this study was to examine a broad\nrange of potential adolescent risk factors for developing\npurging behaviors in a nationally representative sample of\nU.S. young adult women. Demographic variables did not\ndifferentiate risk for the development of purging behav-\niors. In univariable analyses, several childhood variables\nwere identified to increase risk for purging. Higher BMI,\nsuicide attempts, overweight self-perception, parental pov-\nerty, depression symptoms, hyperactivity-impulsivity, de-\nlinquent behaviors, low self-esteem, and never having\nlived with one (or both) parent (s) were associated with\npurging at Wave II. Higher BMI and depressive symptoms\nwere associated with purging at Wave III. Finally, lower\nlevels of self-esteem were associated with an increased\nlikelihood of purging at Wave II compared to Wave III.\nOf the demographic variables controlled for in our\nstudy, purging at Wave I was the only variable that was\nassociated with purging at either follow-up time point.\nNeither participants' age, race/ethnicity, nor highest level\nof parental education was found to be associated with\nTable 2 Association of risk and protective factors with likelihood of purging at Waves II and III (Continued)\nNote: All risk factor variables were measured at Wave I except those marked 3; the latter were measured at Wave III via self-reported retrospective recall. Those re-\nported in bold are significant at p<0.05.\nhttp://www.jeatdisord.com/content/2/1/1\npurging at Wave II or III. The lack of age differences\nacross the two groups is not particularly surprising given\nthe fact that the Add Health sample has a restricted age\nrange. Consistent with a growing literature that reports\nthat girls or women from various racial/ethnicity back-\ngrounds are equally likely to develop disordered eating,\n[26,27] our results suggest that purging may be a prob-\nlem across various racial or ethnic groups. Our finding\nthat highest level of parental education, an indicator\noften used in the literature as a proxy for parental socio-\neconomic status, did not differ when comparing purging\ngroups warrants comment in light of our result that\nfamily poverty did differentiate the two groups. Both var-\niables were measured using parent/guardian self-report.\nWhile parental education does not appear to increase risk\nfor purging, experiencing economic hardship may elevate\nsuch risk as will be discussed in more detail below.\nRegarding the purging variable, it was found that those\nwho reported purging at Wave I were less likely to also\nreport purging at Wave II or III, and purging at Wave I\nwas not associated with a difference in the likelihood of\npurging between Wave II and III. It is possible that this\ninverse relationship is a byproduct of how purging was\nmeasured in this study, given that the variable only\nreflected purging behavior over the last seven days.\nMore frequent longitudinal assessments might better\ncapture the extent to which purging behavior is stable\nbetween adolescence and young adulthood.\nTable 3 Multivariable comparison of purging at waves II and III using measures significant at univariable level\nVariable Purging behavior Coefficient Std. error p-value CI\nNote: All risk factor variables were measured at Wave I except those marked 3; the latter were measured at Wave III via self-reported retrospective recall. Those\nreported in bold are significant at p<0.05.\nhttp://www.jeatdisord.com/content/2/1/1\nAdditionally, our study confirmed several risk factors\nfor purging that have been shown to predict risk for eat-\ning disorders in previous studies, and identified previ-\nously understudied time varying effects for several of\nthese variables. For example, self-perception of being\noverweight significantly predicted purging at Wave II\nbut not at Wave III. Research consistently has found that\nbody image concern (operationalized in a variety of ways\nin different studies) contributed to increased risk for eat-\ning disorder symptoms [2,28] and, therefore, has been\ntargeted as a key risk factor to be addressed in preven-\ntion programs [29]. However, our results suggest that\nthis may only be a risk factor over a certain time range.\nGiven the stability of these risk factors over time, it's\nsurprising that some Wave I predictors that showed sig-\nnificant relationships at Wave II did not predict Wave\nIII purging behaviors. Again, more intensive longitudinal\ndata collection would be useful to more clearly deter-\nmine how risk factors may affect the likelihood of pur-\nging between adolescence and young adulthood.\nSimilarly, consistent with previous studies, low self-\nwere significantly associated with increased risk for pur-\nging. In addition, we found significant relationships be-\ntween purging and self-reported suicide attempts as well as\nbetween purging and having received psychological coun-\nseling. In a series of case control studies, Fairburn and\ncolleagues found that \"parental separation\" (e.g., due to\nprolonged illness) and \"parental loss\" (e.g., due to death)\nwere risk factors for developing an eating disorder [35,36].\nIn our study, never having lived with one (or both) parent\n(s) was a risk factor for purging, but having lost a parent to\ndeath was not. We cannot answer whether these discrep-\nant findings are a function of methodological differences\n(e.g., case\u00adcontrol design versus longitudinal design; differ-\nences in how the target groups were defined). As noted by\nFairburn and colleagues (35), parental separation and loss\nare also risk factors for other psychiatric problems. There-\nfore, these parental risk factors may be indirectly associated\nwith the development of eating disorders. For example,\nparental separation or loss may increase the risk of devel-\noping psychiatric problems, which in turn, could increase\nthe likelihood of eating disorders. Future research that ex-\namines the nature of the association between these paren-\ntal factors and eating disorders is important to determine\nhow parental separation and loss might influence eating\ndisorder risk in terms of being mediated or moderated by\nother risk factors, such as depression. Finally, in our\nsample, family poverty was found to be predictive of\npurging onset. This bolsters emerging literature that\nsuggests a relationship between socioeconomic hardship\nand unhealthy weight control behaviors [37].\nSeveral limitations need to be acknowledged. Although\nAdd Health is a large epidemiological study, the sample\nstill was not large enough to test hypotheses about risk\nfactors for purging in young adult men. Therefore, our\nfindings should not be generalized to boys or men. As is\ncommon in large-scale epidemiological studies, key study\nvariables were measured using self-report questionnaires,\nwhich tend to be less reliable than interview based mea-\nsures. Childhood abuse variables as well as the ADHD-IN\nand -HI scales were collected retrospectively and were,\ntherefore, subject to recall errors. Additionally, because\nfrequency information was not available for the purging\nbehaviors, we were unable to study severity of the behav-\niors. Interval censoring may also be an issue, given that\nquestions only addressed purging in the last seven days,\nwhich did not allow us to identify whether those reporting\npurging during those days were new onset purgers or\nwhether they may have purged prior to the assessment\nperiod. As a result, purging is likely to be underestimated.\nFinally, information was not available regarding binge eat-\ning behaviors or other extreme weight control behaviors,\nsuch as extreme dietary restrictions or excessive exercise.\nFurther studies would be needed to compare our results re-\ngarding purging to these similar unhealthy behaviors.\nThese limitations were offset by several strengths. The\nstudy involved a community sample, thus not featuring\nthe limitations inherent in studies of patient samples.\nThe relatively large sample size afforded us the oppor-\ntunity to use multivariable modeling of risk factors for\npurging, a relatively uncommon yet clinically important\nbehavior. As well, Add Health collected data on numer-\nous psychosocial variables, allowing us to explore factors\nthat have been considered in psychopathology research re-\ngarding other disorders but less so in studies of eating dis-\norders. Finally, our study covered a considerable period of\ntime (8 years) from adolescence into early adulthood.\nConclusions\nThis study prospectively examined risk factors for young\nadult purging in a large nationally representative sample\nof adolescent females. Results provided support for sev-\neral risk factors for purging that have been shown to\npredict risk for eating disorders in previous studies.
