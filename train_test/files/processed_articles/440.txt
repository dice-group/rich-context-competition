A marked interest in\nmonitoring the vitamin B-12 status of the US population was\ntriggered by the 1996 implementation of the national folic acid\nfortification of cereal grains because of concerns that an improved\nfolate status could adversely affect persons at risk of vitamin B-12\ninsufficiency, particularly the elderly, for whom a relatively high\nprevalence has been reported (1, 2). NHANES has measured 3\nbiomarkers of vitamin B-12 status over the past 3 decades: serum\nvitamin B-12, methylmalonic acid (MMA), and total homo-\ncysteine (tHcy) (3). Serum vitamin B-12 directly reflects the range\nof circulating vitamin B-12 concentrations in individuals, although\nnot necessarily tissue concentrations. MMA accumulates in the\nabsence of adequate vitamin B-12 and is therefore a functional\nindicator of vitamin B-12 status (2, 4). Like MMA, tHcy accu-\nmulates in the absence of vitamin B-12. However, tHcy is less\nspecific for vitamin B-12 deficiency than is MMA because it also\naccumulates in the absence of other nutrients, such as folate.\nThe primary challenge with using all biomarkers of vitamin\nB-12 status is the lack of scientific consensus regarding cutoffs to\ndetermine low status. This limitation is particularly critical for\nidentifying individuals with subclinical vitamin B-12 deficiency\nwho lack clinically relevant endpoints and often depend on other\nbiomarkers for comparison and validation (3, 5). For serum vi-\ntamin B-12 and MMA, commonly used cutoffs often come from\nstatistical distributions of different populations. Thus, the reference\nintervals may be both population and method dependent, and\nresearchers have published many different cutoffs in the literature.\nAnother complication is that each biomarker is subject to\nsensitivity and specificity limitations. These limitations are par-\nticularly challenging for accurately identifying subclinical vitamin\nB-12 deficiency, which is more common than the more severe\nclinical deficiency (6). To minimize the effect of these vitamin\nB-12 biomarker limitations, experts recommend concurrently\nexamining a functional biomarker and a biomarker that directly\nmeasures blood vitamin content when assessing vitamin B-12\nstatus (7). However, to our knowledge, NHANES data have not\n1 From the Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health,\nBethesda, MD (RLB, CTS, and EAY); the Department of Medicine, New\nYork Methodist Hospital, Brooklyn, NY, and Weill Medical College, Cornell\nUniversity, New York, NY (RC); the Department of Pathology and Labora-\ntory Medicine, University of California Davis Medical Center, Sacramento,\nCA (RG); and the National Center for Environmental Health (CMP and\nJDO) and the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health\nPromotion (MEC), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.\n2 The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and\ndo not necessarily represent the views of the Office of Dietary Supplements,\nthe National Cancer Institute, the National Institutes of Health, Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention/the Agency for Toxic Substances and Dis-\nease Registry, or any other entity of the US Government.\n4 Address reprint requests and correspondence to RL Bailey, Office of\nDietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health, 6100 Executive Boule-\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nbeen analyzed previously to evaluate the combined use of serum\nvitamin B-12 and MMA for assessing vitamin B-12 status in the\ncombined application of several commonly used cutoffs for serum\nvitamin B-12 and MMA to create metabolic profiles to assess the\nprevalence of low vitamin B-12 status in the US population.\nSubjects\nNHANES is a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of\nthe noninstitutionalized US population. The survey uses a complex,\nstratified, multistage probability cluster sampling design. The Na-\ntional Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention administers NHANES. NHANES personnel first\ninterview survey participants in their homes. During this household\ninterview, interviewers collect information on demographic char-\nacteristics, dietary supplement use, and some health-related issues.\nParticipants undergo a physical examination and blood collection in\na mobile examination center '1\u00ad2 wk after the household interview.\nThey also complete a 24-h dietary recall. Survey personnel obtain\nwritten informed consent from all participants or proxies, and the\nResearch Ethics Review Board of the National Center for Health\nStatistics approved the survey protocol. Interview and examination\nresponse rates for each survey year are publically available (8).\n(ie, lacking mobile examination center data, n = 1160), lactating (n =\n145) and pregnant (n = 801) women, and those with missing MMA\ndata (n = 918). We also excluded data for individuals with high\ncreatinine concentrations (.120 lmol/L for men, .110 lmol/L for\nwomen; n = 548) because impaired kidney function increases MMA\nand tHcy independent of vitamin B-12 status (9). Thus, the final\nanalytic sample consisted of 12,612 adult participants.\nVitamin B-12 exposure\nDietary supplement information was collected via the\nNHANES Dietary Supplement Questionnaire to determine a sam-\nple person's use of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary\nsupplements over the past 30 d. Detailed information about name\nand type, consumption frequency, duration of use, and amount\ntaken was collected for each reported dietary supplement. We\ncalculated the average daily intake of vitamin B-12 from all dietary\nsupplements using the number of days of reported consumption of\nthe supplement, the reported amount that respondents took per day,\nand the serving size unit from the product label, as we described\nData on one 24-h dietary recall are available for each par-\ndata for within-person variability to use these data in conjunction\ncomposition databases, estimates of vitamin B-12 intake in 1999\u00ad\n2004 do not account for bioavailability differences between\nnaturally occurring and added vitamin B-12 sources. Added\nvitamin B-12 is more bioavailable and is present in fortified foods\nand dietary supplements (11). We combined data on the average\ndaily intake of vitamin B-12 from supplemental sources with the\ndaily estimates of vitamin B-12 intake from foods to reflect total\nvitamin B-12 exposure.\nCognitive test scores\nWe used a single measure of cognitive function, the Digit\nSymbol-Coding (DSC) subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence\nScale III (The Psychological Corporation) (12); this instrument,\nwhereas sensitive, is not comprehensive or indicative of all\ndomains of cognitive function. The DSC score is the total number\nof symbols that participants draw correctly in 120 s. To obtain\na high score on the test, participants must have an adequate speed\nof response, attention, and memory (13). We used , 20th per-\ncentile (scores , 34 on the DSC) to indicate cognitive impair-\nment as previously used by Morris et al (14) in NHANES. DSC\nscores were only available for those aged 60 y in NHANES\nMedications\nWe used data from the NHANES prescription drug ques-\ntionnaire to evaluate the use of prescription medications that may\nadversely affect vitamin B-12 status. Within users of NHANES\nClass 87 drugs, we identified participants who reported the use of\nproton-pump inhibitors and H2\n-receptor antagonists (15). No\ndata were collected on the length of time that participants took\nthese medications.\nBiochemical methods\n(RBC) folate, and serum vitamin B-12 using the Quantaphase II\nradioassay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). NHANES measured plasma\ntHcy using a fluorescence polarization immunoassay reagent kit\n(Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) (16). NHANES assayed\nplasma MMA by gas chromatography\u00admass spectrometry after\ncyclohexanol derivation of the extracted MMA. NHANES 1999\u00ad\n2000 measured serum creatinine by the Jaffe method using the\nused the Jaffe rate method (kinetic alkaline picrate) with the\nBeckman Synchron LX20 modular chemistry analyzer. We ad-\nnine (mg/dL) as the analytic note recommends (17). Complete\ndetails and documentation for each of these methods are pub-\nlically available on the NHANES website (18\u00ad20).\nWe applied several cutoff values to the biomarker data to\ndetermine sufficiency and illustrate changes in status (ie, categories\nacross status). We reviewed serum vitamin B-12 concentrations to\ndetermine the sufficiency using cutoff values of ,148 pmol/L (21\u00ad\nused vitamin B-12 status based on the cutoffs that Stabler et al\n(30) originally proposed and that we modified for this analysis.\nThe original criteria had 3 concentrations of vitamin B-12 status:\nadded an additional cutoff of .296 pmol/L (.400 pg/mL) to the\noriginal Stabler et al criteria (30). We classified elevated MMA\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\ncentration .13 lmol/L (4, 16). High serum folate was defined as\na concentration .59 nmol/L.\nMetabolic profiles\nWe defined 4 metabolic profiles based on combinations of\n\"normal\" and \"abnormal\" vitamin B-12 and MMA concen-\ntrations, applying the most frequently used cutoffs for vitamin\nMMA . 210 nmol/L may falsely elevate prevalence estimates\nfor deficiency in the elderly because the cutoff was developed\nin a younger reference population, whereas the use of .376\nnmol/L may underestimate prevalence because it was based\non 3 SD limits and/or patient samples with known low vitamin\nB-12 concentrations (1). Profile 1 consisted of a low serum vi-\ntamin B-12 concentration together with an elevated MMA\nconcentration, profile 2 consisted of a low serum vitamin B-12\nconcentration without an elevated MMA concentration, profile 3\nconsisted of an elevated MMA concentration without a low vi-\ntamin B-12 concentration, and profile 4 consisted of normal\nvitamin B-12 and MMA concentrations.\nStatistical analysis\nWe performed all statistical analyses using SAS (version 9;\nSAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and SAS-callable SUDAAN\n(version 9; Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park,\nNC) software. We used sample weights with SUDAAN to rep-\nresent the US population, account for differential nonresponse\nand noncoverage, and adjust for the planned oversampling of\nsome groups. We estimated SEs for all statistics of interest by\nTaylor series linearization.\nWe estimated descriptive statistics (means, medians, and\npercentages/prevalences) for all variables using proc crosstab,\nproc descript, and/or proc regress in SAS-callable SUDAAN. We\nadjusted for the covariates of sex, age, and race-ethnicity. We also\ncontrolled all group comparisons of biochemical measures for\nlength of food fasting before blood collection, session of sample\ncollection, and serum creatinine concentration.\nWecomparedleast-squaresmeansbyexaminingthelineartrend\nacross the 4 vitamin B-12 and MMA status groups.

The mean age\nof the sample was 45 6 1 y, and '10% of the participants were\naged .60 y (data not shown). About 25% of the sample reported\nthe use of a dietary supplement containing vitamin B-12.\nThe prevalence of low vitamin B-12 status ranged from 3% to\n26%, depending on the serum vitamin B-12 cutoff (Table 1).\nWhen we used ,148 pmol/L as the cutoff, the prevalence of low\nvitamin B-12 status was 2.9% and increased significantly with\nage, was higher in women than in men, and did not differ by race-\nethnicity. When we used ,200 pmol/L as the cutoff, the preva-\nlence of low vitamin B-12 concentrations was '10.6% and\nremained higher in those aged 60 y than in those aged 19\u00ad39 y\nbut did not differ from the prevalence in those aged 40\u00ad59 y.

We also excluded data for lactating (n = 145) and pregnant (n = 801) women. The analytic\nsample included data for 12,612 respondents. NHANES assessed serum vitamin B-12 by using the Quantaphase II radioassay from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA),\nplasma MMA by using gas chromatography\u00admass spectrometry, and plasma homocysteine with a fluorescence polarization immunoassay reagent kit from\nAbbott Laboratories (Abbott Park, IL). The analysis was controlled for age, sex, race-ethnicity, serum creatinine, session of blood collection, and hours of\nfasting before blood collection. Values within age, race-ethnicity, and sex groups for a given status category with different superscript letters are significantly\ndifferent, P  0.05. Nonnormal variables were log transformed before statistical analysis.\n2 Least-squares mean 6 SE (all such values).\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nblacks or Mexican Americans, and women were more likely to\nhave a low vitamin B-12 status than were men. When ,258\npmol/L was used as the cutoff, 25.7% were classified as having\nlow vitamin B-12 status; however, the prevalence differed sig-\nnificantly between all 3 racial-ethnic groups and no longer dif-\nfered by age. The higher prevalence of low vitamin B-12 in\nwomen remained constant across all the vitamin B-12 cutoffs.\nThe prevalence of elevated MMA was 2.3% at a cutoff of 376\nnmol/L and 5.8% at a cutoff of 271 nmol/L (Table 1). Regardless of\nthe cutoff we used, the prevalence of elevated MMA significantly\nincreased with age, was lower in non-Hispanic blacks than in the\nother 2 race-ethnicity groups, and did not differ by sex. About 6%\nof the US adult population had elevated tHcy concentrations. The\nprevalence of high tHcy concentrations increased with age, was\nlower in Mexican Americans than in the other 2 race-ethnicity\ngroups, and was lower in women than in men.\nVitamin B-12 status groups (modified Stabler approach)\nAmong the ,3% of the US adult population with vitamin\nMMA concentrations (depending on the cutoff), and only 32%\nhad elevated tHcy concentrations (Table 2). Another 13% of US\npmol/L, and an additional 22% had vitamin B-12 concentrations\nB-12 concentrations .296 pmol/L. Of this group, only a small\npercentage (,10%) had elevated MMA or tHcy concentrations.\nEach successive cutoff rise showed a significant inverse linear\ntrend across the vitamin B-12 groups with regard to MMA and\ntHcy; the prevalence of elevated MMA (regardless of the cutoff\nused) and tHcy decreased with increasing vitamin B-12 cutoff.\nRBC and serum folate concentrations increased with increasing\nvitamin B-12 status. We observed a trend toward increasing\nprevalence of high serum folate concentrations with increasing\nvitamin B-12 concentrations.\nThe use of vitamin B-12\u00adcontaining dietary supplements and the\namount of vitamin B-12 that users consumed was highest in\nrespondents with serum vitamin B-12 concentrations .296 pmol/L.\nVitamin B-12 intake from the diet and total vitamin B-12 intake\n(from diet + supplements in users and nonusers combined) in-\ncreased with serum vitamin B-12 status. The use of proton pump\ninhibitors and H2\n-receptor antagonists had no relation with vitamin\nB-12 status. Cognitive function scores increased, and the preva-\nlence of impairment decreased across increasing serum vitamin\nB-12 concentrations for adults aged 60 y. We found no sig-\nnificant differences in mean corpuscular volume (MCV) or in the\nprevalence of macrocytosis across vitamin B-12 groupings (data\nnot shown).\nMMA status groups\nWe examined the data for 4 groups defined by their MMA\nconcentrations (Table 3). Very few people had MMA concen-\na low serum vitamin B-12 concentration (depending on the vi-\ntamin B-12 cutoff); another 3% had MMA concentrations of 272\nnmol/L; of this group, '2% had low vitamin B-12 concen-\nAs MMA increased, so did the mean age of the groups and the\nprevalence of those aged .60 y. The percentage of the group that\nwas of non-Hispanic black ethnicity decreased as MMA con-\ncentrations increased. The prevalence of low vitamin B-12 status\nincreased across increasing MMA concentration categories with\nall cutoffs. Similarly, tHcy and the percentage of US adults with\nelevated tHcy concentrations increased with increasing MMA\nconcentration categories. We found no differences in MCV con-\ncentrations or in the prevalence of macrocytosis (data not shown).\nBoth serum and RBC folate concentrations decreased across in-\ncreasing MMA categories. We observed a trend toward increasing\nprevalence in those with high serum folate with decreasing MMA\nconcentrations.\nUse of dietary supplements containing vitamin B-12 and vi-\ntamin B-12 intake from supplements increased with decreasing\nMMA concentration categories. Dietary vitamin B-12 intakes\nhad no relation with MMA concentrations, but total vitamin B-12\ndietary exposure had a significant inverse relation with MMA\nconcentrations. The use of proton pump inhibitor or H2\n-receptor\nantagonist medications had no relation with MMA concentration\ncategories. Cognitive function scores decreased and the preva-\nlence of impairment increased with increasing MMA categories.\nAbout 40% of those with the highest MMA concentrations (.376\nnmol/L) had cognitive impairment.\nMetabolic profiles based on MMA and vitamin B-12\nbiomarkers together\nAbout 1% of the adult US adult population had low serum\nvitamin B-12 and elevated MMA concentrations (profile 1; Table\n4); in addition to the very high MMA concentration (mean 6\nlmol/L); 65% had concentrations .13 lmol. This profile thus\nreflected vitamin B-12 deficiency, often of more than a mild\ndegree. Profile 2 (low vitamin B-12 with normal MMA con-\ncentrations, 2%) and profile 3 (normal vitamin B-12 with ele-\nvated MMA concentrations, 5%) were slightly more common.\nProfile 4, making up 92% of the study population, had both\nnormal vitamin B-12 and MMA, which suggests that this profile\nreflected normal vitamin B-12 status.\nFalling between the 2 poles, profile 2 (low vitamin B-12 with\nnormal MMA) and profile 3 (normal vitamin B-12 with elevated\nMMA) accounted for 2% and 5% of the population, respectively.\nDemographically, profile 3 resembled the vitamin B-12\u00addeficient\nprofile1inmeanage,proportion.60yofage,sexdistribution,and\nethnic distribution, including a low proportion of non-Hispanic\nblacks. Profile 2, on the other hand, resembled the vitamin B-12\u00ad\nsufficient profile 4 in having the fewest subjects .60 y of age and in\nethnic distribution; profile 2 also had the lowest proportion of men in\nthe study.\nSerum vitamin B-12 and MMA differed significantly, in part, as\nexpected from selection, but also unexpectedly because even the\n\"normal\" values inprofiles 2 and 3 differed from the normal valuesin\nprofile 4 and the \"abnormal\" values differed from profile 1 (Table 4).\nProfiles2and3hadsimilarconcentrationsoftHcy,withameanwithin\nthe reference interval, but differed significantly from both profiles 1\nand 4.

We\nextend that existing information by exploring in greater depth the\ninfluence of cutoffs on population outcomes and characteristics\nand by analyzing the interactions between concurrent vitamin\nB-12 and MMA changes more closely because of the diagnostic\nlimitations of every biomarker when it stands alone.\nFour metabolic profiles have emerged from an examination\nof the concurrent use of serum vitamin B-12 and MMA con-\ncentrations to assess vitamin B-12 status in NHANES (Table 4,\nFigure 1).

Profiles 2 and 3, each\nwith one normal and one abnormal biomarker, were more prob-\nlematic but also presented a more important challenge to resolve\nbecause their respective 2% and 5% prevalences far exceeded the\n1% prevalence of profile 1.

Cognitive function scores\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nwas higher and the frequency of non-Hispanic blacks was lower.\nAs summarized elsewhere, 22% of individuals with vitamin\nB-12 concentrations ,148 pmol/L in surveys had no deficiency, as\nmeasured by other metabolic tests, and thus were likely to have\nlow vitamin B-12 concentrations secondary to another cause (5, 7).\nProfile 2 may include individuals with an often genetic TC I de-\nficiency, the frequency of which may be higher than that of per-\nnicious anemia, and in whom serum vitamin B-12 is low but\nMMA and tHcy are not abnormal (39) or individuals who lack the\ncommon fucosyltransferase polymorphism associated with higher\nvitamin B-12 concentrations (43). Given the high proportion of\nyounger women in profile 2, many of the low vitamin B-12 con-\ncentrations may have been affected by hormonal factors unrelated\nto functional vitamin B-12 status. For example, in women aged\n19\u00ad39 y, oral contraceptive users had significantly lower mean\nserum vitamin B-12 concentrations than did nonusers (290 com-\nheterogeneity must also be considered; 17% of profile 2 subjects\nhad elevated tHcy, and some may have had mild vitamin B-12\ndeficiency, despite having normal MMA concentrations.\nProfile 3 was characterized by a high MMA concentration\nalone; serum vitamin B-12 concentrations were within the de-\nfined normal range. This group may have reflected the superior\nsensitivity of MMA to vitamin B-12 in mild, purely biochemical\nvitamin B-12 deficiency (44), which may predominate in profile\n3, as also suggested by the demographic similarities of profile 3 to\nprofile 1; the significantly lower MMA elevation than in profile 1\nsuggests that the vitamin B-12 deficiency, if present, was milder.\nHowever, others in profile 3 may also have represented falsely\nelevated MMA concentrations for reasons not related to vitamin\nB-12 status (5). Our results indicate that only 22% of profile 3 had\nan elevated tHcy concentration. It is also notable that, within\nprofile 3, those with elevated tHcy were older (63 compared with\nwere more likely to be non-Hispanic black (6% compared with\ncompared with 309 pmol/L) compared with those without ele-\nvated tHcy (differences were statistically significant, data not\nshown). Taken together, these findings suggest that individuals\nwith vitamin B-12 insufficiency may represent only a minor\nfraction of those with metabolic profile 3. Vogiatzoglou et al (9)\nfound that identified determinants (age, creatinine, and serum\nvitamin B-12) accounted for ,17% of the variation in plasma\nMMA concentrations are highly dependent on kidney function\nand serum creatinine (9), even within the normal range (45). We\nexcluded those with high serum creatinine concentrations, which\nare indicative of serious renal impairment, but also recognized\nthat some residual effect on MMA concentrations might occur in\npersons with milder renal impairment. For this reason, we also\nstatistically controlled every analysis for serum creatinine\nconcentrations.\nMisclassification of vitamin B-12 status\nThe consequences of extending the cutoff for serum vitamin\n6\u00ad26% (depending on demographic subset) of the added cohort\nhad abnormal MMA concentrations and only 14% had elevated\ntHcy concentrations, and the loss of diagnostic specificity was\neven greater for the added cohort with vitamin B-12 concentrations\ntHcy). Approximately 80% of the subjects in the 2 extended vi-\ntamin B-12 interval categories did not have an elevated MMA\nconcentration (based on .271 nmol), and 79% did not have an\nelevated tHcy concentration. The findings suggest an unacceptable\ndegree of false-positive misclassification of vitamin B-12 in-\nsufficiency when a vitamin B-12 cutoff . 148 pmol/L is used.\nCutoff challenges\nThe use of biomarker cutoffs of vitamin B-12 to estimate the\nprevalence of inadequate nutrient status is challenging. As our\ndata show (Table 1), different cutoffs result in very different\nprevalence estimates (3\u00ad26% for low serum vitamin B-12 and\n2.3\u00ad5.8% for elevated MMA); the prevalence estimates change to\na greater degree for serum vitamin B-12 than for plasma MMA.\n25.7%, respectively (Table 1). Moving MMA cutoffs down by\na similar percentage from 376 to 271 nmol/L had smaller effect\non rates of subjects identified as \"high MMA\" (from 2.3% to\nnmol/L did the rate of abnormality reach 13.8% (Table 3). The\nFIGURE 1. The prevalence of different metabolic profiles of biomarkers\nof vitamin B-12 (B12) status. Shaded bars show least-squares means for\nrespondents with low vitamin B-12 (,148 pmol/L) and normal methylmalonic\nacid (MMA; ,271 nmol/L) concentrations, elevated MMA (.271 nmol/L)\nand normal vitamin B-12 (.148 pmol/L) concentrations, and low vitamin B-\ndata only (ie, no mobile examination center data, RIDSTATR = 1; n = 1160),\nhigh creatinine concentrations (.120 lmol/L for men, .110 lmol/L for\nwomen; n = 548), and missing MMA data (n = 918). We also excluded data\nfor lactating (n = 145) and pregnant (n = 801) women. The analytic sample\nincluded data for 12,612 respondents. NHANES assessed serum vitamin B-\n12 by using the Quantaphase II radioassay from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA),\nplasma MMA by using gas chromatography\u00admass spectrometry, and plasma\nhomocysteine with a fluorescence polarization immunoassay reagent kit\nfrom Abbott Laboratories (Abbott Park, IL). Our analysis controlled for\nage, sex, race-ethnicity, serum creatinine concentration, session of blood\ncollection, and hours of fasting before blood collection.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nMMA cutoff shift also did not shift the demographic distribution\nas much as did changes in vitamin B-12 cutoff.\nCognitive function\nIn older adults, the prevalence of cognitive impairment was\nhigher with lower vitamin B-12 status and elevated MMA\nconcentrations. We saw a significant linear trend with both raw\nscores on cognitive function and the prevalence of cognitive\nimpairment across vitamin B-12 and MMA status (Tables 2 and\ncognitive impairment (Table 3). The 2 metabolic profiles with\nelevated MMA concentrations had lower cognitive scores and\na higher prevalence of impairment than did the profiles without\nelevated MMA concentrations (Table 4). On this basis, it is\ntempting to conclude that MMA may be a better biomarker for\ncognitive function than serum vitamin B-12 in older adults.\nHowever, these data must be interpreted with caution. First,\nNHANES data are cross-sectional in nature, so we cannot infer\na cause-and-effect relation between MMA concentrations and\ncognitive function. Second, important confounders may be at-\ntributed to the relations; individuals in the profiles with poorer\ncognitive function were also older. Third, cognitive status is\ncomplex and difficult to measure; it is related to educational and\nsocioeconomic status--neither of which were examined here.\nThus, more data are needed before we can accurately interpret\nthe relation between MMA and cognitive function in older\ncognitive function tests will be available.\nStudy limitations\nThe ideal approach for defining appropriate cutoffs for\nNHANES and other applications would be to conduct clinical\ntrials in which a quantitative relation between biomarker con-\ncentrations and the appearance of clinical outcomes of presumed\nvitamin B-12 inadequacy is established and in which the mea-\nsurement of the biomarkers is traceable to a higher order reference\nmethod (46). Unfortunately, this type of information cannot be\nobtained from a cross-sectional study such as NHANES, which\ncannot establish causality between biomarker concentrations\nand outcomes. However, our findings may prove useful for\ninforming the design of interventional population-based trials\ndesigned to assess the effects of vitamin B-12 repletion through\nsupplementation.\nCurrently, no consensus exists on the appropriate cutoffs for\nassessing serum vitamin B-12 and MMA status, particularly for\npopulation-based monitoring purposes. The approach and criteria\nused, the study population, and the measurement procedure can\nall affect the relevance of published cutoffs. The most appropriate\ncutoffs for assessing vitamin B-12 status when using NHANES\ndata remain elusive, which has resulted in considerable un-\ncertainty about the vitamin B-12 status of the US population.\nFuture studies should seek to determine a definable clinical\nendpoint to achieve this goal. Until this is established, we cannot\naccurately estimate the public health burden of vitamin B-12\ndeficiency in the United States.\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows--All authors contributed to\nthe concept development and manuscript preparation and read and approved\nthe final version of this manuscript.
