Emerging from the study is strong evidence of\ncoercive practice as an inherent component of caucusing thus posing a challenge to the positive benefits.\n",

However, its use may not be popular\nwith all practitioners, since according to Taylor (2002, pp.\n161-166), the utilization of private sessions arises from users\nof \"problem-solving/negotiative\" approaches to mediation\npractice, whereas practitioners holding to a \"systems\" per-\nspective often eschew its use.\nIn the main, discussions on the need for a private session\narises as a result of consultation between mediator(s) and\ndisputants, usually during sessions, but also range from\nbeing scheduled prior to the mediation session proper, fre-\nquently as part of the intake process (Swaab & Brett, 2007)\nto a type of shuttle between disputants in caucus following a\npreliminary joint session, when upon settlement a final joint\nsession is held (Calkins, 2006). Despite there being only a\nsmall amount of published research on the nuances associ-\nated with private sessions, there are available enlightening\ndescriptions and reviews of caucus use. For example, Jacob\n(1991) discussed the use of private sessions with postdecree\ndisputants where extensive caucus use was seen as beneficial\nin exposing \"blockages\" to gain understanding of the nature\nof the conflict. Significantly, most of the family mediation\nmodels reviewed by Bowen (1999) used caucusing at least\nonce per session, ideally equal time being allotted to each\ndisputant. In addition, Parkinson (1997) observed that the\ndecision to include a caucus stage varies according to the\nmediation model used, as a function of agency practice,\ndirected at the perceived needs of participants, or as a result\nof mutual consultation between mediators and disputants.\nFurthermore, mediators might assume that each disputant\nmay need to disclose or discuss their concerns in a private\nsession (Tillett & French, 2006) or for each client to examine\ntheir separate positions (Rifkin, Millen, & Cobb, 1991). In\naddition, Fisher and Brandon (2009) indicated that mediators\nmay identify concerns that might benefit from exploration,\nor issues that appear to be contributing to repetitive loops, a\ndeadlock, or an impasse. Interestingly, Fisher and Brandon\nvalue of caucus is in promoting negotiating equality and\npositive negotiating strategies and also to allow participants\nemployment of caucus in circumstances where disputant\nsafety issues are identified as a significant feature of the rela-\ntionship. Although Haynes and Charlesworth (1996) saw\nlimited use for private sessions except where specific diffi-\nculties presented, a study by Swaab and Brett (2007) con-\ncluded that pre-family mediation caucuses contributed to a\nreduction of interpersonal conflict. Importantly, the authors\nalso asserted that caucusing should be used to establish trust\nbetween disputants and practitioners rather than to work\nthrough \"agreement issues.\" Bush and Folger (1994, pp.\nparties are able to raise concerns that they feel unable to in\njoint session, but at the same time, the authors were critical\nof sessions dedicated to the urging of disputants toward spe-\ncific courses of action.

Reviewing issues likely to\nbenefit from caucusing, Moore (1987) and later Moore\nsures arising out of preexisting problems in the clients' rela-\ntionship to those emerging from the session in progress or as\na result of the negotiation process. Pope (2001, p. 93) listed\nseveral general uses for caucusing such as reflection on the\nfuture and the importance of settlement, discussions around\nalternative options for settlement, ventilation of emotions\narising from the dispute, mediator(s) acting as a \"sounding\nboard\" prior to rejoining joint session, and examination of\npremature concessions or commitments. Significantly, co-\nmediators may also benefit from a private session to \"take\nstock\" of the joint session's progress, according to Fisher\ndifficult dimension likely to emerge in a session was identi-\nviewed separately from each other or their parents.\nViews vary as to the most appropriate time to hold a caucus\nwho break proceedings for a private session with one party\nshould time the break appropriately: not too early, particularly\nwhere there is still the possibility of a productive settlement;\nand not too late when all is virtually settled. However, an early\ncaucus is often indicated when it is considered that ventilation\nof an issue or emotional concern might aid negotiation flow.\nDespite there being no ideal time for a caucus break, the loca-\ntion, duration, and order in which the disputants are \"seen\" are\ngenerally subject to an agreed standard.\nThis study attempted to add to the relatively small amount\nof published research on the efficacy of caucusing by focus-\nsing on a critical review of its use in a family mediation con-\ntext. The views of practitioners were explored on their\nrationale for using caucus and the potential for ethical con-\ncerns or dilemmas likely to arise. Accordingly, the central\nquestion addressed was \"What are the special characteristics\nassociated with the use of caucus?\" An associated question\nwas \"Are there ethical implications inherent to caucusing?\"\nMethod\nThe study was part of a larger project using mixed-method\nresearch (Hall, 2008), which utilized two sources of qualita-\ntive data collection: (a) a large 56-question questionnaire\ndivided into 12 topic areas, 1 being the subject of this article;\n(a) several in-depth semistructured interviews.\nFor the questionnaire, the unit of analysis was family\nmediation practitioners and the sampling, as defined by\npurposive. Invitations to participate in the project were\nposted to mediation agencies known to provide family medi-\nation services (Bowen, 1999). In the invitation, the project\nwas presented as involving a self-completion postal ques-\npractitioners' opinions on a range of topics associated with\nfamily mediation practice. The 56-question questionnaire\n101) 1 of which being the subject of this article. There were\npackages being sent to agencies for distribution to willing\npractitioners. Each of the packages contained a covering let-\nter introducing the researcher and the institution, an outline\nof the project and its significance, appreciation of respon-\ndents' cooperation in the project and assurance of confiden-\ntiality, and the questionnaire (with completion instructions)\nand a return envelope preaddressed to the investigator. Of the\n129 packages mailed out, there were 47 completed question-\nnaires received by the investigator who was blind to the\nidentity of respondents. The response rate was therefore\nCanada (2), Puerto Rico (1), the United Kingdom (7), and\nthe United States (10). The topic area reported here was\ntitled \"Use of Caucus\" and consisted of two principal pre-\ncoded questions.\nSeven Australian mediation practitioners were also\nrecruited as volunteer participants to participate in semis-\nducted by the investigator. As with the questionnaire, the\nsampling was purposive, the participants being known to the\ninvestigator through his work in family mediation and cho-\nsen for their \"first hand experience and knowledge,\" an attri-\ncritical to a successful investigation. Inclusionary criteria\nwere formal mediation training and participation in 400 or\nmore mediation sessions post-training. The interviewees\nprovided informed consent based on the cautionary elements\naudio recorded more than 1.5 to 2 hr. When the tapes were\ntranscribed, the content was subjected to a form of thematic\nstyle of interview was used, described by Roulston (2010,\npp. 122-129) as useful in generating detailed explanation and\nmeaning to interviewee experiences and permitting opportu-\nnities to explore special points of significance identified by\ninterviewer and interviewees. Participants were asked to dis-\ncuss their perception of the family mediation process and\nreflect on their experiences and understanding of the topic\narea. Discussion allowed for clarification, exploration, and\ncongruent discussion of meanings and interpretations of\nemergent issues, which, in the case of this article, were asso-\nciated with private meetings (caucus).\nResults of the Questionnaire\nThis topic area (\"Using Caucus\") involved two precoded\nquestions, grouped according to response category.\nIn the first question, practitioners were asked whether\nthey used private sessions (caucus) \"routinely,\" \"some-\ntimes,\" \"never,\" or \"rarely.\" All 47 participants answered\n(45%) \"sometimes,\" with 3 (6%) stating they either \"never\"\nor \"rarely\" used caucus. The prominent feature of these\ncus \"sometimes\" or \"routinely.\"\nIn the second question (consisting of two parts), the inten-\ntion was to survey the respondents' view of the value of\ncaucusing.\nPart 1: Do you consider that the use of the caucus is valu-\n(55%) stated that using caucus was \"always\" valuable or\n\"sometimes\" valuable, respectively, with 1 respondent stat-\ning \"mostly\" and another stating \"rarely.\"\nPart 2: The mediators were asked whether they consid-\nered it valuable, to whom was it valuable? Of the 44 who\nanswered the question, 39 (89%) considered caucus was\nvaluable to the mediation process, 36 (82%) considered it of\nvalue to clients, and 30 (68%) of value to the mediator(s).\nThe survey exposed limitations on the use of the ques-\ntionnaire tool in this case. For example, problems were asso-\nciated with the rigid parameters set by the questions with\nsome respondents stating that they opted for the nearest to\ntheir preferred answer.\nResults of Interviews\nFollowing transcription and thematic analysis, key inter-\nviewee assertions and opinion arising from discussions and\nselected dialogue were coded for like or linked responses and\nCluster 1--Aims, Benefits, andValues of\nCaucus and Caucusing\nDespite some reservations, there was consensus among\ninterviewees on the benefits caucus could offer disputants,\nsuch as to allow them to express their views without fear of\ninterference or intimidation from the other disputant, enable\na client to ventilate emotions in a safe environment, or\n\"rehearse\" for a return to joint session. In addition, there was\nagreement among interviewees that a major aim of caucus-\ning was to gather information with a view to facilitating the\nmanagement of difference or tension between disputants in\njoint session. Moreover, some interviewees observed that a\ntopic discussed in private session often assumes a different\nmeaning or connotation in joint session. An amalgam of sug-\ngestions as to the aims of caucus use included (a) to explore\n\"real\" differences between disputants, and how they are to\nbe managed; (b) how disputants felt about each other; (c)\nhow they regarded discussion of their concerns in joint ses-\nsion; and (d) what has been the reaction to those same con-\ncerns prior to attending mediation. Some mediators added\nthat they utilize caucus to discover what compromises par-\nties are prepared to make in agreement setting. In responding\nto questions about the value of caucusing, three interviewees\nasserted that they might be unable to facilitate moves toward\nresolution of issues if they could not equate what transpired\nin the joint session with discussion in private sessions. For\nexample, one person stated that\nif you hear similar stories and they appear consistent\nin both cases, then you have a good idea that whatever\nis resolved, is going to be valid. If you have a person\npresenting differently than in joint session, then you\nhave to pursue a different approach.\nResponding to questions from the interviewer on the role\nof the practitioner, without exception all interviewees\nacknowledged the central role of \"controlling the process.\"\nCluster 2--When to Introduce a Caucus\nSession and forWhat Length ofTime?\nInterviewees stated repeatedly that they offered parties equal\ntime in caucus sessions, regardless of the discussion sub-\nstance. Two people described how and when private sessions\nwere used in their model, with one person noting that a\n\"small\" caucus lasting about 10 min was usually introduced\n15 to 20 min into the session, whereas the other interviewee\nstated that if the decision was made to use a caucus break,\nshe would do so about 30 min into session. Referring to the\nlength of private sessions, an interviewee said that typically,\nabout 15 min per person was offered once, sometime during\na session. On the other hand, another person reported that in\nher agency, caucus was made available whenever needed.\nShe said that if there was seen to be a power imbalance, for\nexample, it might be appropriate to explore individual views\non what disputants had tried previously. A mediator stated\nthat he asks participants whether they would like a \"break\"\nor \"to caucus.\" He would suggest a caucus where there was\nan impasse in the proceedings or any suggestion of abusive\nbehavior in the relationship that might be \"notifiable under\nlaw,\" for example, child abuse. Another interviewee agreed\nand added that the model she used usually had a private ses-\nsion, sometimes two, during the assessment stage: \"For\ninstance, if we decided not to go ahead with mediation, fur-\nther down the track we would be inclined to have another\nprivate session to check how each person is going to handle\nthis.\" Also in her model, an aim might be to find out what\nthe disputants really wanted: \"If we think counseling is a\nbetter option, be it separate or couple counseling, one person\nmight say, `maybe we'll be better off seeking counseling.'\nUnder these circumstances, you would need to hold a private\nsession with the other party.\" Answering the question of\nwhen and where he would use caucus, an interviewed\nmediator responded thus:\nI have used caucus in the beginning, in the middle, and\nat the end. The reasons were: in the beginning you use\nit in order to establish a reason for \"shock remediation\";\nin the middle you might use it if there is expression of\n4 SAGE Open\nextreme emotion, or a \"disposition\" that needs to be\nclarified and perhaps confronted.\nHe explained that\nyou can't really have people crying and the other party\nexploiting the situation, or also becoming upset. If you\ndiscover that the person is experiencing difficulties in\naccepting the system that you are using and maybe\nquestioning it or the validity of the process, you have\nto suggest a caucus session. It often means that one\nhas to start from the beginning and ask what's bother-\ning them and why they feel the way they do \"please\ntell us because we need to understand it.\" A caucus\ntowards the end might be utilized in order to test the\nvalidity of what has been resolved or to discover how\ndisputants feel about the session's content.\nAnother interviewee elaborated on the occasions for the\nuse of caucus, noting that most often mediator(s) agree it is\ntime for a session, although there is often conflict between\npractitioners as to the appropriateness of temporarily stop-\nping the joint session at a particular spot, and holding sepa-\nrate sessions with the clients. When asked how she would\nmanage conflict, she stated that if she wanted to delay the\ncaucus, or needed to ask another question of the client(s), she\nwould press ahead and delay caucus until she considered a\nmore appropriate time! There was consensus among inter-\nviewees regarding additional situations likely to precipitate\ncaucusing, including (a) a history of inadequate communica-\ntion where one party habitually acquiesces to the other, or (b)\na superficial level of communication where continuance of\nthe relationship requires agreement at all costs. In private\nsession, the other partner being absent might upset the\narrangement thus allowing for concerns or fears to be\nverbalized.\nCluster 3--Empowering Mechanisms\nAssociatedWith Caucus\nOne interviewee was circumspect in describing her use of\ncaucus; nevertheless, she emphasized the importance of the\ncaucus tool as being one of empowerment for participants\nwho are then in a strong position in caucus to review aspects\nof their status. Yet another person also alluded to empower-\nment as a recurrent theme, stressing the usefulness of private\nsessions when an impasse has occurred:\nIt is a very powerful strategy if we are \"stuck,\" or if\nsomething happens which is inflammatory, or we've\nnowhere else to go but separate the disputants . . .\nwe're in a better position to say I don't understand\nwhat's happening or what's going on, or it seems\nwe're stuck . . . what's your view . . . So, it gives us a\nchance to check things out with people without doing\nso in joint session where they may not tell you what\nwas going on without losing face. (emphasis added).\nBy adding the \"loss of face\" aspect, she underlined the\nway caucusing enhanced disputant empowerment. Similarly,\nshe reassured the disputant of her impartiality: \"That's where\nengagement (with clients [emphasis added]) comes in . . .\nbeing able to proceed in a way that the person isn't going to\nfeel you're not on their side or that you're advocating for the\nother person.\" She stressed the value of caucus to elicit sig-\nnificant information: \"Since you don't know what's happen-\ning with people until you ask them, it becomes a problem\nwhen they are reluctant to reveal much in joint session.\"\nAnother interviewee's comment was similar when referring\nto the case of a couple who appeared to have settled the dis-\npute and had merely come to mediation to have it written\nout! However, he and his co-mediator decided to continue\nwith the mediation protocol anyway. It transpired that there\nwere underlying issues that had not been addressed. It was in\ncaucus that these were identified. His views were consistent\nwith those of the other six interviewees with regard to the\nempowering effects of caucusing. Emphasizing its role in\nreassuring clients, he asserted that if used carefully, caucus\nhad considerable ability to empower and afford the practitio-\nner the opportunity to demonstrate their neutrality and\nimpartiality. In addition, another interviewee added that by\nasking whether disputants would like to take a particular\npath or even a different approach was facilitating some sense\nof empowerment for disputants.\nCluster 4--Disadvantages in the Use of\nCaucus\nAlthough mediators interviewed were, in varying degrees,\nsupportive of the use of caucus, some saw cause for concern\nwith its use. The concerns ranged from some negative\naspects in specific circumstances through to significant con-\ncerns, prompting references to it being tantamount to uneth-\nical practice. One interviewee thought there were few\nnegative aspects to using caucus and because it was enabling\nan ultimate agreement then, \"the end might be said to justify\nthe means.\" Conversely another interviewee was somewhat\nuncomfortable with the use of private sessions, having been\ninitially trained in a model that used them only if considered\nnecessary. She was critical of its use from the perspective of\nits potential for eroding the trust between mediators and\ndisputants:\nI think that if you're encouraging parties to speak\nopenly and honestly with each other, by separating\nthem and then offering disputants opportunity to talk\nprivately with me because there may be things you\ndon't want to say in front of the other person, you're\nactually creating an element of distrust. It can be seen\nby the other party as quite destructive, and they might\nthink \"well, here am I being open and honest and I've\nbeen asked by the mediator to be so, while at the same\ntime the mediator's saying, you don't have to be open\nand honest really, because you can tell me whatever\nyou like, and it will stay confidential.\" So there's\nsomething in the whole process of private sessions that\nmight break down that element of trust that you're\nhoping to build up.\nTwo interviewees acknowledged the positive aspects of\ncaucusing but were also forthright on the negative perspec-\ntives, one person suggesting that the whole idea of caucusing\nwas unethical and \"smacked\" of unprofessional practice, a\nview echoed by the other interviewee with particular con-\ncerns, who considered its use as a violation of the spirit of\nmediation where \"everyone worked in concert aiming for a\nresolution to the dispute.\" Another interviewed participant\nalso had reservations on the use of caucus, stating that it was\n\"underhand to some extent and possibly contrary to basic\ntenets of mediation.\" One interviewee added that the whole\nidea was that everyone works toward a resolution \"in the\nsame room . . . and in an `open manner.'\" Significantly,\nanother interviewee saw disadvantages that particularly\nrelated to the feelings of the party not in the private session,\nthus creating the possibility of erosion of trust: \"I think it can\ncontribute to suspicions being raised such as, `what are they\ngoing to say when I'm out there.'\" She also voiced concern\nabout unilateral decisions to enter \"caucus\" (i.e., by one\nmediator): or held at the wrong time. She said that\nan example might be if one mediator suddenly say's\n\"oh look, I think we'll have a private session now\" and\nhasn't checked with the co-mediator who might feel\nthe session is just getting somewhere. Sometimes we\ndon't say we are going to have a private session, we\npromptly call a break!\nWhen pressed by the interviewer as to why, having such\nnegative views, interviewees continued to use private ses-\nsions, typical responses ranged from it being part of the\nagency model through to stating that in most (not all) situa-\ntions, the positive aspects outweighed the negative ones!\nCluster 5--Confidentiality During Caucus\nSessions\nAll interviewees asserted that discretion and confidentiality\nare central to the spirit and ethos of mediation practice. This\nwas an important aspect of the interviews because (a) confi-\ndentiality of proceedings is a criterion for successful, ethical\nfamily mediation; (b) most codes of ethics of professional\nbodies emphasize confidentiality. While all interviewees\nacknowledged the central importance of neutrality and\nimpartiality to the caucus milieu, questions about client\nempowerment and preservation of confidentiality during\nand after sessions garnered some specific observations. For\nexample, two people interviewed noted that there was no\ncontrol on out-of-session disclosure of confidential material\nfrom either joint or separate sessions, confidentiality being\nlimited by the desire of all participants to preserve it.\nAnother interviewee observed that after a private session\nand upon resumption of joint session, it might be beneficial\nfor disputants to disclose those key aspects of the caucus,\nwhich may be of assistance in the formation of settlement.\nIn contrast, a particular interviewee emphasized that in her\nmodel, breaking of private session confidences was not tol-\nerated, with the exception of statutory notification of child\nabuse. Another person also cited statutory obligations,\naffirming her strong belief in the value of confidentiality\nthus explaining her reluctance to use the caucus tool, hold-\ning that its use should be discretionary. She said that\nthose who favor private sessions will say that there\nmay be many people (disputants [emphasis added]) in\nmediation who feel quite intimidated by the other\nparty who, despite being encouraged to be as open and\nhonest as possible, don't feel they can be so because\nof: a troubled \"history,\" feeling too nervous, not being\nat their \"best,\" or the other party being constantly\ndominant.\nShe continued by observing that \"there may be a number\nof reasons why in a private session, one party opens up in a\nway that they haven't been able to in a joint session.\" She\nsaid that\nno matter how skilled a mediator is, if there is a behav-\nioral aspect present, recent \"history\" between the par-\nties, or simply a concern for the future, some parties\nfeel that they cannot \"disclose\" in a joint session with\ntheir former partner present, a private session may\nthen be beneficial.\nHowever, she said that she left the option open ended, by\ncontrast to those who applied subtle pressure to include cau-\ncus: \"There are some mediators who will say that we can\nhave a private session if you wish; or one party might request\none.\"\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nResponses to the questionnaire demonstrate that most\nrespondents used caucus and that they regarded it as valu-\nable to the mediators, the clients, and also to the mediation\nprocess. Results from the interviews indicated that despite\nsome strong reservations, there was mainly agreement that\nadroit use of private sessions enables mediator(s) to perform\nsupportive functions such as exploration of disputants' con-\ncerns; in this, the results were sympathetic to existing litera-\nture, such as discussed by Pope (2001). Private sessions\n6 SAGE Open\nwere seen to create a \"safe\" environment which was defined\nas a discussion forum without interference from their co-\ndisputant, possible \"loss of face,\" or an erosion of the nego-\ntiation phase as is possible in joint session. Interviewees\nindicated that any concerns disputants may hold about the\nconfidential nature of caucus are to a large degree contingent\non adequate explanation to them by mediators, about its use\nand the reasons why it may be used. Concern surrounding\npreservation of confidentially was identified by some media-\ntors as in need of cautious treatment. A private session may\nbe at the behest of one or all of the participants in a session.\nSome mediators who participated in this study used caucus-\ning to consider strategies to influence the course of the ses-\nsion, to learn what compromises parties were prepared to\nmake in the process of agreement setting, or to better under-\nstand an individual disputant's perspective. It emerged from\nthe study that private sessions enable examination and\nexploration of concerns surrounding, for example, future\ncare of children which may be seen by a disputant to be more\nappropriately aired privately before revealing options in\njoint session. The absence of a dominating partner allows the\nparty in caucus to be heard by a mediator without pressure\nfrom the other party to precipitate a decision or agreement\nunder duress. Important additional benefits to be derived\nfrom caucus include improvement in the negotiation pro-\ncess, often by the relief of tension between clients and the\nprevention of premature concessions, and using it as a\n\"sounding board\" to check out what the parties are willing\nto agree to in the journey to a fair and just outcome.\nModeling of skills such as active listening by practitioners is\nalso likely to be noted by disputants. Although there are\noccasions where disputants may call for a private conference\nbreak, the mediator(s) in \"controlling\" the process are the\nmost likely of the participants to actually do so. It is impor-\ntant to recognize the point behind caucusing in this context.\nThe evidence from this study and the literature suggests that\ncaucusing is focused to a large extent on the pursuit of jus-\ntice for disputants, with justice being seen as a central tenet\nof mediation. Importantly, caucus can be exploited by a\nparty to reassess their position, even though sometimes as a\nprelude to undermining session progress. More positively,\nthey may use it to evaluate the way the session is proceeding\nfor their co-disputant, or to consider ways of establishing a\nmore conciliatory approach to issues. A constructive aspect\nof caucus is that its skilful use by practitioners aids the\nfacilitation of empowerment. This is accomplished by\nallowing each party to clarify their goals and desired out-\ncomes, reinforce their position, and explore options and\nfeasibility of implementation through reality testing, without\nexposure to possible intimidation from the other party.\nIn addressing the associated research question, a range of\nquestions emerged from the study relating to the use of cau-\ncusing. Not least of these is in fact connected with empower-\nment of disputants. If the aim of caucus sessions is to provide\na safe and informal avenue for ventilation of concerns, or\ndisclosure of sensitive material, and because the disputants\nbelong to an informal system, how does it affect the other\nparty? This might explain the reluctance of mediators from a\n\"systems\" perspective embracing the tool (Taylor, 2002, pp.\nparty may be at the expense of the other? How can mediators\nbe certain that by seeing both parties separately in a non-\nthreatening (safe) environment where the discussion is con-\nfidential, the parties will be empowered as an automatic\nresult of caucusing? In addition, some ethical concerns sur-\nfaced from the study. For example, there may be a form of\ncoercion involved if caucusing is either used routinely or\neven suggested to clients, however, gently. Furthermore,\nsuch coercion may be instrumental in the erosion of trust\nengendered during or prior to the engagement phase of the\nprocess. This might compound the coercive effects from\nsubtle pressure applied to a disputing party such as suggest-\ning that it might be in their best interests to negotiate a settle-\nment rather than pursue a particular path. It is worthwhile\npondering on the possibility that coercive processes might be\ninitiated involuntarily prior to a session being planned,\nbecause pressure is on both parties to attend mediation to\navoid the risk of \"losing out.\" Coercive practice is thus likely\nto continue throughout the whole session with caucusing\nplaying a significant part, particularly where mediators initi-\nate one or more breaks during a session. Indeed, it is equally\nplausible to argue that mediators interrupting sessions to\ncaucus is redolent of disarray or dissent when viewed from\nthe disputant position, or even a level of disrespect for the\nspirit of the process. In the interviews, confidentiality fea-\ntured strongly difficult since it relies on all participants pre-\nserving it. Conversely, it may be argued that caucusing\nallows for the modeling of dynamic resolution procedures.\nThis then begs the question \"Is mediation even applicable in\ncases where private sessions are considered necessary?\"\nPerhaps counseling is more appropriate. A significant aspect\nof private sessions is that since family mediation is regarded\nas an open and honest negotiation process where issues of\nconflict are mutually aired and ideally, resolved, private ses-\nsions may well be seen as the antithesis of conciliation or\nreconciliation.\nAddressing the basic questions set for this study, the con-\nclusions are encapsulated by stating that caucus includes fea-\ntures that are crucial to the ethos of family mediation with\nimpressive support from respondents and interviewees. In\nthe pursuit of justice for clients, there is a constant focus on\nthe clients' potential autonomy. Caucus helps create a situa-\ntion in which autonomy is recognized, facilitating disputants'\narrival at a firmly and fairly negotiated agreement with cli-\nents being encouraged in independent decision making.\nCaucusing at best allows for free autonomous expression in\na safe environment and as a mediator of equity in social jus-\ntice terms. At worst, it is an opportunity for the erosion of\ntrust and is the antithesis of empowerment and a perpetrator\nof unethical practice, with its extended use appearing\nto create a series of ethical dilemmas. Family mediation is\nconcerned with the pursuance of informed, joint decision\nmaking; accordingly, it behooves practitioners to be aware of\nthe potential for negative unethical effects associated with\nprivate sessions.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research and/or authorship of this article: The research for\nthis study was supported by the Department of Sociology at\nMacquarie University, Sydney, Australia.\nReferences\nBowen, D.
