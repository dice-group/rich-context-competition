The importance of\nvisual cues is illustrated by the preoccupation that humans have with faces and the\nspecialized neural mechanisms dedicated to facial recognition. Faces are featured\nprominently when it comes to interpersonal attraction and mate choice, and ratings of facial\nattractiveness are consistent across different cultures (Cunningham, Roberts, Barbee,\nDruen, and Wu, 1995). Even neonates spend significantly more time looking at faces rated\nby adults as being more attractive (Langlois et al., 1987; Langlois, Ritter, Roggman, and\nVaughn, 1991). These findings suggest that selection has operated to influence our\nperception of faces because they contain embedded cues to individual fitness.\nWhat you see is what you get\nConsistent with this position, it has been shown that people with lower fluctuating\nasymmetry (i.e., higher bilateral symmetry) have faces that are rated as more attractive\n(Thornhill and Gangestad, 1993) and deviations from bilateral symmetry are inversely\nproportional to genetic, physical, and mental health (Thornhill and Moller, 1997). Indeed,\nmore symmetrical faces are found to be more attractive in their own right (Grammer and\nsymmetry even when facial symmetry is masked by only presenting half of the face\n(Scheib, Gangestad, and Thornhill, 1999).\nPeople with attractive faces also live longer (Henderson and Anglin, 2003),\nproviding more opportunity for offspring and grandchildren investment. Ratings of facial\nattractiveness have been shown to predict sperm count, sperm motility, and sperm\nmorphology in males (Soler et al., 2003) and estrogen levels in females (Law Smith et al.,\n2006). Ratings of facial attractiveness peak in females when they are in the ovulatory\nphase of the menstrual cycle (Roberts et al., 2004). Men who are heterozygotic at the\nMajor Histocompatibility Complex, and are therefore more disease resistant, are also\njudged by women as being more attractive (Roberts et al., 2005).\nLittle has been done, however, to examine how well faces reflect other sexually\ndimorphic traits, such as strength and body configuration. Body configuration also signals\nunderlying fitness. Singh (1993) has shown that males prefer females with low waist-to-\nhip ratios (WHR), a signal of increased fertility. Hughes and Gallup (2003) extended this\nanalysis by suggesting that low WHR also signals 1) the absence of pregnancy and 2)\npelvic skeletal morphology conducive to easy childbirth. More recently, Lassek and Gaulin\n(2006) gathered evidence for a neurodevelopmental effect of differences in the distribution\nof body fat as measured by WHR. Fat stores in the hips and thighs are comprised of long\nchain polyunsaturated fatty acids essential for brain growth and development. Mobilization\nof these fatty acids is conserved for gestation and lactation, times of primary brain growth\nin offspring. Consistent with this idea, women with low WHR (more lower-body fat), and\ntheir offspring, have higher cognitive ability scores (Lassek and Gaulin, 2008).\nWhen it comes to short term sex partners females tend to prefer testosterone driven\ntraits in males, such as broad shoulders and narrow hips indexed by high shoulder-to-hip\nratios (SHR) (Evans, 1972; Franzoi and Herzog, 1987). The importance of these gender\nspecific body types is highlighted by the finding that individuals with ideal body\nproportions evoke more intrasexual jealousy (Dijkstra and Buunk, 2001). Furthermore, a\nrecent eye-tracking study has shown that WHR is the primary morphological cue used to\ndetermine the gender of figures in motion (Johnson and Tassinary, 2005).\nMales with wedge-shaped torsos (high SHR) have sex at earlier ages, more sexual\npartners, and more extra-pair copulations (Hughes, Dispenza, and Gallup, 2004). High\nSHR males are also more prone to high school aggression and show enhanced handgrip\nstrength (Gallup, White, and Gallup, 2007). Handgrip strength is a ubiquitous measure of\nhuman health and vitality that is associated with postoperative recovery (Klidjian, Foster,\nKammerling, Cooper, and Karran, 1980) and longevity (Rantanen et al., 1999). In males,\ngrip strength is positively correlated with number of sexual partners and negatively\ncorrelated with age of first sexual intercourse (Gallup et al., 2007). Although handgrip\nstrength is influenced by environmental (Geliebter et al., 1997) and developmental (Hunt,\nRowlands, and Johnston, 1985) factors, 65% of the individual differences in grip strength\nare due to underlying differences in genes (Reed, Fabsitz, Selby, and Carmelli, 1991),\nWhat you see is what you get\nmaking it a prime candidate for fitness research. The relationship between handgrip\nstrength, promiscuity, and body morphology (SHR) among males recently reported by\nGallup et al. (2007) casts a new light on handgrip as a mate choice characteristic.\nThe current study was designed to determine if female ratings of facial\nattractiveness in males predict independent measures of strength, body configuration, and\nsexual behavior.\nMaterials and Methods\nStimuli\nAll subjects were undergraduate college students fulfilling course research\nrequirements. Thirty-eight males (mean age = 19.1, SD = 2.1) agreed to provide\nmorphological data including shoulder and hip circumferences, and hand grip strength\nmeasurements. Subjects were asked to squeeze a hand held dynamometer (Lafayette\nInstruments Model 78010) as hard as they could. Grip strength (in kilograms) was defined\nas the maximum of three dynamometer readings for each hand. Shoulder and hip\ncircumference measurements were obtained following the method of Hughes and Gallup\n(2003). A digital photograph was taken of each male's face from the neck up. Facial\nphotographs were taken against a white background under the same lighting conditions\nfrom a distance of approximately one meter. Males were asked to remove their hats,\nglasses, and other accessories that would be visible in the photograph. Subjects also\ncompleted an anonymous questionnaire to determine their age, number of sexual partners,\nand age of first sexual intercourse. All participants reported being heterosexual.\nRaters\nSixteen female college students viewed a PowerPoint slideshow of a series of male\nfaces. At a designated computer, females were free to spend as much time as necessary to\nview and rate each photograph for attractiveness. All ratings were recorded on a five point\nLikert-type scale. To minimize fatigue effects, half of the photographs were presented in\nrandom order to half of the female raters and the other half of the photos were rated by the\nremaining females. This resulted in two groups of eight females each rating 19 facial\nphotographs. Females in both groups were instructed not to rate photographs of individuals\nthey recognized. Menstrual cycle phase and use of birth control among the raters were\ntreated as random variables. Cronbach's alpha inter-rater reliability of male facial\nattractiveness was .88 for both groups of females.\nResults\nDescriptive statistics for the different measures and ratings are presented in Table 1.\nMorphological measurements and survey data were initially analyzed using two-tailed\nPearson correlations.\nMorphology and behavior\nGrip strength scores varied as a function of body morphology. Males with more\naccentuated wedge shaped torsos (high SHRs) had significantly higher grip strength scores.\nFigure 1 depicts the relationship between grip strength and SHR (r = .381, p < .02). Grip\nWhat you see is what you get\nstrength was also correlated with number of sexual partners (r = .317, p < .05).\nMorphology and ratings\nMales with higher grip strength scores were independently rated by the females as\nhaving more attractive faces (r = .323, p < .05) (see Table 2 and Figure 2). As shown in\nFigure 3, males with broad shoulders and narrow hips (high SHR) were also rated by\nfemales as having more attractive faces (r = .512, p < .01). Females also rated males who\nreported more sexual partners as having more attractive faces (r = .360, p < .03).\nA multiple regression was employed to determine the unique contributions of each\nvariable while controlling for all others. Semi-partial correlations between facial\nattractiveness and SHR, grip strength, and number of sex partners are shown in Table 3.\nWhen controlling for all other variables, the correlations remain in the predicted direction\nand SHR correlates significantly with facial attractiveness.\nTable 1.

Shoulder-to-hip ratio (SHR) in males as a function of ratings of facial\nattractiveness.\nFacial Attractiveness Rating\nSHR\nDiscussion\nThese results show that the way women rate men's faces accounts for a substantial\nproportion of the variance in body morphology, grip strength, and sexual behavior among\nmale college students. Ratings of facial attractiveness accounted for 26% of the variance in\nbody configuration (SHR) and 10% of the variance in grip strength. Fink, Neave, and\nWhat you see is what you get\nSeydel (2007) also found a relationship between grip strength and ratings of male facial\nattractiveness.\nIt is important to note that our facial photographs were taken from the neck up and\ndid not include the participants' shoulders or any other body features, suggesting that\nhormonal and genetic factors that shape morphological indicators of fitness also influence\nfacial features. Thornhill and Grammer (1999) found that ratings of female faces were\npositively correlated with ratings of their bodies, suggesting that faces signal body features\nin both sexes. Both the neck and hair were included in the photographs we used to\nmaintain realistic depictions of the subjects. Whereas it may be possible that the inclusion\nof the neck could have affected the results, subjects were given explicit instructions to rate\nthe face. Future work will be needed to determine whether and to what extent (if any) the\nneck may contribute to such ratings.\nConsistent with findings reported by Rhodes, Simmons, and Peters (2005), our\nresults also show that female ratings of male facial attractiveness accounted for a\nsignificant proportion (13%) of the variance in male promiscuity (i.e., number of sexual\npartners). Rhodes et al. measured both short-term and long-term sexual partners, body\nattractiveness (height and symmetry in males), and facial attractiveness to show that\nattractive males have more short-term mating partners. Although not significant, age of first\nsex among the males in our sample was related to handgrip strength and SHR in the\npredicted negative direction (see Table 2). Because the mean age was only 19.1 (SD =\n2.1), the magnitude of these correlations may have been affected by the truncated range of\nvalues for self-reported age of first sex (range = 7 years). We also found a negative (but\nagain non-significant) correlation between number of sexual partners and the age of first\nOur findings parallel those reported by Hughes et al. (2004) for voice attractiveness.\nBoth men and women with voices rated as more attractive by members of the opposite sex\nreported more sexual partners, more extra-pair copulation partners, and an earlier age of\nfirst sexual intercourse. In addition, having an attractive voice predicted a more masculine\n(high) SHR in males, a more feminine (low) WHR in females, as well as lower fluctuating\nasymmetry in both sexes (see Hughes, Harrison, and Gallup, 2002). Considered in\nconjunction with our results, it would appear that the interplay between hormones and\ngenes plays a substantial role in molding a `package' of characteristics that signal\ndifferences in fitness. This package includes body morphology (as in SHR and WHR),\nphysical strength, bilateral symmetry, vocal characteristics, and facial attractiveness.\nDo these effects generalize to women? Contrary to Thornhill and Grammer (1999)\nwho failed to find a relationship between WHR and ratings of facial attractiveness in\nfemales, Brewer, Archer and Manning (2007) recently found that male ratings of women's\nfacial attractiveness were negatively correlated with WHR. Robust negative correlations\nbetween WHR and ratings of voice attractiveness in females have also been obtained\nAccording to our results and those of Gallup et al. (2007), handgrip strength fits\ncomfortably into this package. Our findings replicate theirs, showing that handgrip\nstrength predicts SHR as well as number of sexual partners among men. We also found\nthat males with a stronger grip had faces that were consistently rated as being more\nattractive. This is particularly interesting in light of evidence showing that handgrip\nstrength is correlated with serum testosterone levels (Page et al., 2005). It is well\nWhat you see is what you get\nestablished that females in the fertile phase of their menstrual cycle find masculine male\nfaces more attractive (Johnston, Hagel, Franklin, Fink, and Grammer, 2001; Penton-Voak\net al., 1999) and that masculine male facial features are largely testosterone driven (Penton-\nVoak and Chen, 2004). These results suggest that handgrip strength is a reliable proxy for\ncirculating testosterone levels in men. It is important to note that although environmental\nfactors do affect grip strength, both handgrip strength and testosterone levels are highly\nprime candidates for screening during mate selection.\nGiven the historical and cross-cultural prominence of handshake greetings between\nmen, handgrip strength could also function as a means of assessing intrasexual competition.\nArcher and Thanzami (2007) report that males with high grip strength, score higher on\nphysical aggression and direct aggression scales. They discuss their findings in terms of\nthe Resource Holding Power theory (Parker, 1974), in which males assess their rival's\nabilities prior to making decisions regarding competition strategies. If handshakes enable\nmales to assess the health, strength, and vitality of newly encountered individuals then grip\nstrength would be positively selected in males. Unlike males, Gallup et al. (2007) found no\ncorrelations between female grip strength and measures of reproductive fitness, including\nWHR, number of sexual partners, and age of first sexual intercourse. They also found that\nthe distribution of grip strength scores between males and females were virtually non-\noverlapping.\nIn conclusion, our results add to a growing amount of evidence for important\nconnections between appearance and underlying dimensions of fitness. In addition to\nreplicating several relationships between morphology, behavior, and attractiveness, we\nreport a novel relationship between facial attractiveness and SHR, suggesting that these\ncharacteristics should be interpreted as a package that, collectively and individually, signal\nfitness. Therefore in a very real sense what you see is what you get when it comes to faces\nand bodies, and what you hear is what you get when in comes to voices.\nReferences\nArcher, J., and Thanzami, V.
