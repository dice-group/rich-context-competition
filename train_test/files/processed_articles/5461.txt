This study compares participatory approaches used by a national park and a state forest plantation\nin Tanzania. It shows how in similar settings, various parts of the State pursue various policies that affect communities in\ndifferent ways. The extent of participation and amount of benefits accrued are found to have a paramount role in determining\nlocal people's attitude to conservation. Local communities do not generally regard the national park as being beneficial, while\nthe forest plantation is regarded as an important means for their survival. The failure of the park to allow meaningful local\nparticipation and equitable sharing of the park's benefits with affected local people, is leading to hatred, resentment, and illegal\nharvest of natural resources from the park.\n",

Many national governments, develop-\nment partners, and conservation multinationals argue for\nparticipatory approaches (Inamdar, De Jode, Lindsay, &\nCobb, 1996) as they engender win-win outcomes through\nenvironmental management and economic development\nParticipatory approaches have been implemented for\nabout three decades, however they seem to have yielded\nmixed results (Barrett, Lee, & McPeak, 2005; Gibson &\nCurtis, 2006). The extent to which these approaches secure\nlocal people's support for conservation may depend on the\ndegree of involvement and the scale of benefits accrued\n(Child, 2003). In addition, success will depend on the\nprotected area goals, objectives, methods, and mission\n(Mannigel, 2008), and the ability of protected area \"manag-\ners to reconcile biodiversity conservation goals with social\nand economic issues\" (Andrade & Rhodes, 2012, p. 1).\nIn Tanzania, the Ministry of Natural Resources and\nTourism (MNRT) adopted locally based and decentralized\napproaches to natural resources management from the late\nearly 1980s and the resulting declining capacity of govern-\nment agencies (Nelson & Blomley, 2010). The intention was\nto involve local people in the management of natural\nresources and for them to influence management decisions\nwhile benefiting directly from conservation. The two sectors,\nforests and wildlife, underwent policy reform processes in\nthe 1990s. They used various techniques and approaches\nwith the intention of creating good relationships through\ninfluencing local people's attitudes and perceptions, to\nengender support for biodiversity conservation (Hulme &\n1Norwegian University of Life Sciences, \u00c5s, Norway\nCorresponding Author:\nSayuni B.

Mariki1\n Keywords\nbenefit sharing, conservation, local communities, participation, Tanzania\n2 SAGE Open\nstudies from these sectors reveal that success so far has been\nlimited (e.g., Benjaminsen & Bryceson, 2012; Brockington,\nThere are few studies that have closely compared the perfor-\nmance of these sectors in meeting participatory objectives\nfocus more on community-based forestry and community-\nbased wildlife management. Studies that compare both sec-\ntors by focusing on national parks and forest plantations,\nespecially when they affect the same people, are lacking in\nthe academic literature.\nThis article investigates how participatory approaches\nused by the Kilimanjaro National Park (KNP) and the West\nKilimanjaro Forest Plantation (WKFP) influence local com-\nmunities' reactions toward the study areas. KNP is managed\nby the Tanzania National Park Authority (TANAPA), while\nWKFP (60.19 km2) is managed by the Tanzania Forest\nServices Agency (TFSA)--formerly the Forest and\nBeekeeping Division (FBD). The national park was signifi-\ncantly expanded in 2005 after the inclusion of a forest reserve\n(1,078 km2) that had been managed by the FBD through\nJoint Forest Management (JFM). The inclusion of the forest\nreserve was associated with changes in institutions, the legal\nframework, distribution of powers, authority, resources, and\nchanges in natural resource management agents. This transi-\ntion reflected substantial changes in the relationships\nbetween people and the State, and between people and the\npark, in terms of natural resource access and rights.\nThe reason for selecting these two areas is that they have\nmore or less the same location and therefore concern some\nof the same local people. Both areas experienced the para-\ndigm shift from fortress conservation to community conser-\nvation (Hulme & Murphree, 2001). According to the\nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)\nclassification, KNP is classified in category II (an area man-\naged mainly for ecosystem protection and recreation) and\nWKFP is not included in the IUCN category system.\nAccording to Dudley (2008), forests that are commercial,\nthat is timber plantation of exotic species and as such, do not\nconstitute a forest protected area. Exploring the performance\nof these two areas in terms of participatory approaches can\nshed light on how they can improve the relationship with\nadjacent local communities.\nThe park and forest plantation involve and benefit local\npeople in very different ways. At KNP the withdrawal of\nnatural resources is prohibited, however the park benefits\nlocal people through community development projects. For\nexample, park management involves local people in extin-\nguishing a fire during any incident of fire outbreak in the\npark. At WKFP the management allows local people to;\ncollect some forest products, participate in the logging busi-\nness (for registered customers), provide casual labor for vari-\nous activities in the plantation, and engage in farming\nactivities through the taungya1 system (commonly known as\nthe shamba system in East Africa). As with KNP they are\nalso involved in helping during fire incidents in the forest\nplantation. This article argues that the level of participation\nand benefits applicable to the livelihoods of local people\naffect the way local communities react toward the national\npark and the forest plantation.\nThe next section discusses the concept of \"participation,\"\nfollowed by a description of the study area, the methods of\ndata collection and the data analysis. Then the findings are\npresented before moving on to the discussions and\nconclusions.\nWhat Is \"Participation\"?\nThe term participation is well debated and discussed in\ndevelopment and conservation literature (e.g., Agarwal,\nStokke, 2000). The term has been used in many contexts and\nis understood in a variety of ways (e.g., Reed, 2008; Rowe,\nparticipation is defined following Hoben, Peters, and\nRocheleau (1998) definition as a process through which dif-\nferent stakeholders influence, share, and keep control over\ndevelopment initiatives and over decisions and resources\nthat affect them.\nLocal people's participation in development and conser-\nvation has enjoyed general acceptance among various actors\nin recent decades. Nevertheless, despite its acceptability, par-\nticipation in development continues to attract criticism (e.g.,\nHickey & Mohan, 2004). For example, some scholars who\nsupport the concept (e.g., Diamond et al., 2004; Mannigel,\ntion can be used as a means (method) to promote more effi-\ncient (effective, cheap) management or as an end to enhance\nequity and empowerment. Cooke and Kothari (2001), how-\never, argue that not only is participation unable to facilitate\nmeaningful social change it largely maintains existing power\nrelations through masking this power behind the rhetoric and\ntechniques of participation. Mohan and Stokke (2000) fur-\nther argue that participatory approaches tend to neglect local\npower relations and inequalities (as they consider local com-\nmunities as homogeneous entities), and underplay the role of\nbroader political and economic forces.\nThere are several degrees of participation ranging along a\ncontinuum from nominal, passive, informing, giving options,\nactive functional, interactive, and taking responsibility\nthe logic of \"acting together\" or \"taking part,\" the extremes\n\"nominal,\" \"passive,\" and \"taking over management respon-\nsibility\" are not considered particularly participatory. This is\nbecause at those levels, local people and institutions are only\ndistantly involved in management and decision-making\nthat, in rural development and in nature conservation studies,\nthe activities on these three levels are commonly referred to\nas participatory.\nIn terms of natural resources management, participatory\napproaches assume that, if local communities participate in\nthe management of natural resources and/or benefit they will\nbe more likely to support conservation (McNeely, 1995;\nWells & Brandon, 1992). However, several studies have crit-\nicized participatory approaches in natural resources manage-\nment for failing to achieve their goals in terms of devolving\ndecision-making powers to and/or benefiting local people\nwhile promoting conservation (e.g., Barrett, Brandon,\nThe extent to which people participate in natural resources\nmanagement depends on the approach used by conservation\ninstitutions, which largely is determined by the extent of\npower sharing, in this case, between the State and commu-\nWeber (1919) defines a State as the \"human community that\n(successfully) claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of\nphysical force within a given territory.\" The same author\nnotes that the State may ascribe to other institutions or to\nindividuals the right to use physical force only to the extent\nto which it permits such use. For example, power can be\nascribed to natural resources institutions to regulate access\nand control of resources, or provide rules defining the distri-\nbution of benefits. Thus, the State controls the activities of\ninstitutions and their members through legislation, policies,\nregulations, and strategies that encompass binding rules\nWith regard to State and local participation in natural\nresources management in Tanzania, the government2 through\nits parliament makes official decisions concerning natural\nresources management policies, and Acts that legalize the\nmanagement of natural resources, and participation of differ-\nent stakeholders. Different institutions under the MNRT\nmanage all renewable natural resources. For instance, wild-\nlife resources fall under three conservation institutions:\nTANAPA that manages national parks and has its own ordi-\nnance and policy; Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority\nthat manages Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) and has\nits own guideline; and Wildlife Division that manages wild-\nlife outside national parks and NCA and has its own policy\nand guidelines. All responsible institutions for wildlife man-\nagement use the Wildlife Act of 2009. However, the TFSA\nmanages the forest sector and has its own Act and policy. All\nthese legal documents have aspects of how local people\nshould participate and benefit from natural resources.\nThe common participatory approaches used by these\ninstitutions include protected area outreach program prac-\nticed by TANAPA, community-based natural resources man-\nagement practiced by Wildlife Division and TFSA, and\nco-management regimes practiced by TFSA. Tumusiime and\nVedeld (2012) argue that success of these participatory initia-\ntives may depend on the extent of involvement, amount of\nbenefits accrued, and distribution. Studies elsewhere reveal\nthat benefit sharing initiatives face a number of challenges\nsuch as corruption, lack of transparency (Cooksey, 2011;\ngenerate significant benefits or deliver sustainable alterna-\ntive local livelihoods (Cernea & Schmidt-Soltau, 2006;\nHackel, 1999). Additionally they are not always equitably\nshared within communities (West, Igoe, & Brockington,\n(Norton-Griffiths & Said, 2010), and Madagascar (Ferraro,\nThis article considers these issues in theory and in prac-\ntice by exploring the case of KNP and WKFP.\nMethod\nThe Study Area\nKNPis one of 15 parks inTanzania managed by theTANAPA.\nThe park was formerly known as Mount Kilimanjaro Forest\nand was protected by the German Colonial Government\nunder the Forest Conservation Ordinance of 1904 (Kivumbi\nreserve by the British Colonial Government under the Forest\nOrdinance of 1921 for water catchment and forest products.\nIn 1941, the colonial government approved a half-mile forest\nzone between the forest reserve and the more densely popu-\nlated villages along the southern lower slopes of the moun-\ntain. The motive was to provide local people with firewood,\nfodder, building poles, wood and non-wood products. This\nstrip was managed by the local Chagga Council (Kivumbi &\nreclassified as a national park, covering an area of 753.81\ncontinued to be managed by the FBD without local participa-\ntion. However their management was ineffective and led to\ncontinual deforestation. In response to this problem and fol-\nlowing the decentralization policies in the 1990s, the New\nForest Policy was formulated in 1998, which among other\nissues emphasized participatory management and decentral-\nization (United Republic of Tanzania [URT], 1998). Thus,\nFBD established Community-based Forest Management in\nwhich communities are managers and owners of forests, and\nJFM in which local communities co-manage forest reserves\nwith central and local government authorities (URT, 1998).\nSubsequently, JFM was adopted in the Kilimanjaro Forest\nReserve with local people participating in management and\nbenefiting from the reserve (Tanzania Specialist Organization\non Community Natural Resources and Biodiversity\nConservation [TASONABI], 2001 ). However, in September\n2005, the forest reserve and some parts of the HMFS were\nannexed to the park after the survey report that revealed\n4 SAGE Open\nmajor threats to Mount Kilimanjaro in the form of logging,\nfires, charcoal burning, shamba (farm) practices, livestock\ngrazing, forest villages (squatters), and landslides\n(Lambrechts, Woodley, Hemp, Hemp, & Nnyiti, 2002, p. 5).\n(Kilimanjaro National Park Authority [KINAPA], 2006).\nThe main activities allowed in the park are non-consumptive\ntourism, education, and research. Mount Kilimanjaro\n(5,963 m altitude) is one of the major attractions in the park.\nThe park borders 90 villages, all of which are included in the\npark's outreach program. The TANAPA outreach program\nalso known as Community Conservation Services (CCS)\nwas initiated in 1988 with the help from the African Wildlife\nFoundation. The aim was to build good relationships between\nparks and the local communities surrounding them. The CCS\nprogram is based on the motto \"good neighborliness\"\nPolicy stresses that \"the outreach program will be accompa-\nnied by mechanisms to ensure that the benefits of conserva-\ntion are shared with local communities in appropriate ways\"\nTo the north and north-west of Kilimanjaro, beneath the\nnatural forest and village land, there were forest plantations\nnial period (for timber and poles production) and expanded\nafter independence in 1961. The total area of plantations to\nthe north-west of Kilimanjaro (WKFP) is 60.19 km2 (Ngaga,\ntrees (TASONABI, 2001). The remaining area consists of\ncatchment forest areas, steep slopes, valley bottoms, hills\nand water sources (WKFP, 2008). WKFP was established\nthrough the taungya system to licensed cultivators. It is\nowned by the Government of Tanzania and managed by the\nTo incorporate the participatory aspects in WKFP after\nthe Forest Policy of 1998, the plantation management in col-\nlaboration with FBD explored JFM opportunities\n(TASONABI, 2001). However, interviews with forest plan-\ntation management revealed that the mode of operation of\nthe plantation did not support JFM. In addressing the partici-\npatory issues, the management objectives of the plantation\nwere modified to include: the production of non-wood prod-\nucts, which are harvested by local communities; local par-\nticipation in management; and benefiting from the plantation\nMount Kilimanjaro is characterized by a bimodal rainfall\npattern, with long rains from March to May, and short rains\nfrom October to December. The rainfall varies with altitude\nand ranges from 2,300 mm at lower altitudes (the forest belt)\nto less than 200 mm at the summit (The United Nations\nEnvironment Programme-World Conservation Monitoring\nThe Chagga are the largest ethnic group on the southern\nand eastern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro. Ethnic groups,\nsuch as the Maasai, the Safa, the Pare, and other small groups\nare found on the western and northern parts of the mountain.\nThe slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro are now occupied by more\nthan one million people (Hemp, 2006). The annual popula-\ntion growth rate for the Kilimanjaro region was 2.9% during\n2005). Due to the high population density and land scarcity\nalong the mountain slopes, zero-grazing is practiced by many\npeople, which means that the forest is the main source of fod-\nder for domestic animals.\nThis study was conducted in three villages, namely,\nNamwai, Engare Nairobi, and Matadi. They are located on\nthe western side of Mount Kilimanjaro in the Siha Division.\nThese villages (former squatters) were officially registered\nby the government in the 2000s. All the villages are adjacent\nto KNP and close to WKFP. They are included in the park's\nneighborliness list. Some members of these villages were\nevicted from the natural forest in 2006 and from the forest\nplantation in 2007. The population of the three villages was\nfarming, small-scale livestock keeping, small-scale business,\ntimber/log business, casual labor in plantations, formal\nemployment, and a few villagers assisting tourists as porters.\nMany villagers practice the taungya system in the forest\nplantation (Figure 1).\nData Collection and Analysis\nEmpirical data was collected during different periods\nInitially, the study sought to investigate the KNP outreach\nprogram and therefore first interviewees were purposefully\nselected such as village government leaders, villagers (males\nand females aged 18 years old and above), the park's out-\nreach warden, the park's protection warden, and tourist por-\nters. The local people who were interviewed reported a\nnegative relationship with the park and indicated the forest\nplantation as a good neighbor. This observation prompted to\nstudy theparticipatory approaches and benefit sharing\nschemes used by the KNP and WKFP. In the follow-up field-\nwork villagers, village government leaders, the forest planta-\ntion manager, forest plantation staff, former forest reserve\nstaff, and former village natural resources committee mem-\nbers were purposefully selected and interviewed. The inter-\nviews were qualitative, semi-structured, prepared specifically\nfor the interviewees, and conducted in Swahili, i.e. a lan-\nguage understood by most of the people in the study area.\ninterviewed in this study. The interview sessions lasted\nbetween 1 and 2 hr each. Saturation point was reached when\nconsequent interviews revealed no new information regard-\ning the study topic. Interviews were supplemented with\ninformal discussions with different people, participant obser-\nvation, and focus group discussions with 6 to 10 people in\neach study village. In addition, the researcher attended the\nvillage assembly at Engare Nairobi village, and reviewed rel-\nevant literature and several studies conducted in the area. On\nthis basis a lot was learned on how local communities are\ninvolved and benefit from each area.\nEach interview began by informing the interviewees about\nthe research project and seeking their consent to participate in\nthe study. The participants were encouraged to express them-\nselves freely, and were guaranteed anonymity and confidenti-\nality. A notebook was used to record information from the\ninterviewees, and when permission was granted a tape\nrecorder was used to record data, which was later transcribed.\nThe collected data was analyzed by identifying themes and\npatterns, organizing them into coherent categories, and link-\ning them to the aims of the study. In addition, statements were\nwritten that could be supported by appropriate illustrative\nquotes from the interviews to explain each theme.\nResults\nThe analysis of field data revealed five main themes: the pro-\ncess of expansion of KNP, access to natural resources after\ninclusion of the forest reserve in the park, local people par-\nticipation in managing the KNP and WKFP, benefit sharing\nschemes, and the relationship between local communities,\nKNP and WKFP. A description and discussion of each theme\nis in the following sections and a comparison summary of the\nKNP and WKFP is presented in Table 1.\nThe Process of Expansion of the KNP\nAs elaborated in the \"Method\" section, the Kilimanjaro Forest\nReserve and some parts of the HMFS were annexed to KNP in\nMount Kilimanjaro. However, the analysis of field data reveals\nthat KNP did not fully involve local people during the inclu-\nsion of the forest reserve into the park. As one interviewee\nstated, \"the park officials did not conduct any meeting with us;\nthey passed in some households and took some individuals'\nopinions and then considered these as the opinions of all vil-\nlagers; something which is false\" (Interview no. 7, 2011). The\nprocess was not clear about changes in user rights, restrictions\non entry to the forest, and access to forest resources.\nFigure 1. Overview map showing study villages, Kilimanjaro National Park, and the West Kilimanjaro Forest Plantation.\n6 SAGE Open\nThe park demarcated the area without the local people's\ninvolvement, and unfortunately included portions of people's\nfarmland into the park boundaries. This intensified the con-\nflict, which was later resolved by positioning some beacons\nin cooperation with villagers and district officials (Interview\nno. 7, 2011). The park did not consider the provision of a\nbuffer zone where communities could harvest forest prod-\nucts (Interview no. 9, 2011). Furthermore, the park manage-\nment dissolved the village natural resources committee and\ndecided to handle all matters of park management without\nthe participation of local people (Interview no. 8, 2009).\nWhilst the process of expansion of the KNP annexed only the\nKilimanjaro Forest Reserve, the WKFP continued to be man-\naged by FBD under the same objectives as before (Interview,\nAccess to Natural Resources After Inclusion of\nthe Forest Reserve in the Park\nAfter the forest reserve was annexed to KNP, entry or har-\nvesting any natural products from the park without permis-\nsion is considered to be illegal. The park is patrolled by park\nrangers. Some women who entered the park illegally\nreported being raped, sexually harassed, or had their prop-\nerty confiscated. Likewise, men reported instances of being\nFurthermore, restrictions have even been imposed on\nsearching for lost children or livestock in the forest.\nThe park staff demands that villagers must wait for them to\ncome before entering the forest, and in most cases, their\nresponse is not timely (Interview no. 19, 2009). The lack of\ncooperation in handling illegal activities in the park seemed\nto tarnish the image of the villages and negatively affect\ntheir fund application for development projects as the park\nmanagement demands that villages should abstain from ille-\ngal activities. Villagers describe this system as \"arrest and\nwho were caught in the forest were mainly: collectors of\nfirewood, fodder, poles, and plants for traditional medicine;\ntraditional hunters; farmers (cannabis); and timber splitters\nto respect permits stamped by village governments and\nissued to plumbers working on irrigation canals (Interview\nTable 1.

Villages and nearby towns depend\non the plantation for their firewood needs. The local people\nare allowed to collect firewood during thinning and harvest-\ning periods. Fodder harvesting is also allowed, if it does not\ntake place at water sources. Moreover, people purchase con-\nstruction poles, participate in the logging business (for regis-\ntered customers), and are involved in farming opportunities\nin the plantation, and seasonal employment.\nThe Involvement of Local People in Managing the\nPark and the Plantation\nAt KNP local people are involved in park management\nthrough fire extinguishing exercises. However, they are not\nallowed to enter the park before the park rangers arrive. It is\nworth noting that fire extinguishing is on a voluntary basis;\nthus, no payment or incentive is given other than food. The\nvillagers claimed that in such exercises they work as a team\nwith park officials and, thereafter, the relationship ends\nrangers are paid for fire extinguishing duty the local people\nfeel that they should also be paid, since they do not have any\nshare in the forest (Interview no. 4, 2009). To emphasize the\nsituation, the villagers claimed that the park recognizes them\nonly in the event of catastrophes (Interview no. 4, 2009).\nSuch a relationship has caused many people to turn away\nfrom cooperating with the park because they do not regard\nthemselves as stakeholders in the management of the forest.\nThe local people compare the current management of the for-\nest reserve with the former management under the FBD, as\none village leader asserted,\nIn those days, many people turned up to extinguish fire because\nthey knew the reserve belonged to them, . . . but now we have to\nconvince and force them because they are not paid and do not\nAt WKFP the situation is different. The plantation man-\nagement has created awareness in the surrounding villages\nabout conservation, fire control, and prevention measures. In\ncases of fire outbreaks the communities react quickly to\nextinguish the fire and do not demand payment (Interview\nWKFP, 2012). However, some interviewees revealed that the\nWKFP structure is rigid and they lack participation in deci-\nsion making. The following section describes the benefit\nsharing schemes used by KNP and WKFP.\nBenefit Sharing Schemes\nCriteria and procedures.The benefit sharing scheme of the\nCCS involves support for community-initiated projects\n(SCIP), conservation education, and income generating proj-\nects. SCIP was initiated in 1992 to support social projects of\nvillages bordering or close to national parks (Goldstein,\nTo obtain support from the park, KNP's neighboring vil-\nlages have to comply with a set of criteria. These criteria\ninclude: the village should be free from poaching; it should\nnot have previously been supported by the park; conserva-\ntion education has been provided; the village is in close prox-\nimity to the park; and the project should be of importance to\nthe community (Nyeme & Nilsen, 2010). However, the inter-\nviews revealed that most of the studied villages lack aware-\nness about the criteria used for selecting projects for support.\nThe main criterion known by villagers was \"proximity to the\npark,\" which they defined as having a \"patch of natural for-\nest\" bordering the park. There was generally a lack of aware-\nness on park matters because the park has not conducted any\nmeeting in the study villages.\nApart from the criteria, there are established procedures\nto follow that include holding a village assembly to select a\nproject, submitting minutes of the meeting, and presenting\nan application letter outlining the reason for the request, the\namount requested, project description, drawings and cost\nestimates, while being able to meet about 30% of the project\ncosts (Nyeme & Nilsen, 2010). The district authorities must\nbe involved in these procedures, and the SCIP committee\nshould approve the project before it is forwarded to national\nparks headquarters to be considered for funding. Before proj-\nect implementation a memorandum of understanding has to\nbe signed between the community, the park and district\nauthorities (Nyeme & Nilsen, 2010). The interviews revealed\nthat some of these procedures are known by village govern-\nment, however they are rarely followed because they are\nbureaucratic and top-down. In most cases district level offi-\ncials initiate the procedures rather than the communities in\nneed. For instance, applications for construction of water\nintake and a water storage tank in Matadi village, as well as\na secondary school library in Namwai village, were initially\nnegotiated between the District Commissioner and KNP\nbefore the villages were involved. Other procedures were not\nKNP has only one Park Outreach Warden who has a large\nworkload in visiting 90 villages and consequently has insuf-\nficient time to assist villagers with any SCIP applications.\nAt WKFP the criteria for benefiting includes closeness to\nthe plantation, and the criteria for the allocation of taungya\nplots include: health-related aspects (e.g. long periods of\nsickness, HIV/AIDS affected persons), age-related factors\n(e.g. elderly people), orphans, widows, poor people, planta-\ntion staff, and casual laborers who work in the plantation.3\nThe local people in need of plots register their names with\nthe respective hamlet leaders. In some instances HIV/AIDs\naffected persons, disabled and widows go directly to the\nplantation management to seek further attention. No fee is\nrequired to acquire a plot (cf. Dean, 2011).\n8 SAGE Open\nAs in the case of KNP, at WKFP the process also has some\nweaknesses. The interview responses revealed some aspects\nof favoritism in the process of plot allocation. First, the vil-\nlage leadership registered the names of villagers according to\nthe set criteria, however the plots were allocated to other per-\nsons. Even though plantation management sometimes cross\nchecked the process the problem remained in some villages,\nas one widow lamented:\nI have been to plantation headquarters and in our village\ngovernment office for more than 4 times applying for a plot. I\nwas given a promise but during the plot allocation exercise, my\nname was not in the list . . . I am tired; I have lost hope. (Interview\nSecond, some villagers reported that the management in\nthe forest plantation favors relatives, friends, or influential\npeople in the community during the allocation of plots; and\nsome staff engage in corruption by allocating plots to them-\nselves where they later sell the user rights,rent out, or give to\nrelatives or friends.\nBenefit sharing. KNP does not share monetary benefits with\nlocal communities. Instead it benefits local communities\nthrough SCIP. During implementation of these projects the\npark contributes up to 70% of the project costs and the com-\nmunity contributes the remaining 30%. Although KNP is not\nthe most visited national park in Tanzania, it ranks number\none in terms of generating revenue. It generates about 38%\nof the total revenue of Tanzania National Parks, followed by\nthe Serengeti National Park (33%; Kessy, n.d.).This is\nbecause tourists stay in the park longer (while climbing\nMount Kilimanjaro) than those visiting the other national\nparks in the northern tourist circuit. Tourists spend money on\naccommodation, transport, food, and souvenirs. The infor-\nmation from the Tourism Department shows that from 2002\nper year).\nThe revenues collected from KNP and other parks go to\nthe National Park's headquarters where the \"park's opera-\ntional budget\" is allocated. Only 7.5% of the budget goes\nto communities for SCIP. From its inception in 1994 to\nneighboring the park. The types of social projects sup-\nported include: construction of public schools and pur-\nchase of furniture; construction of cattle troughs, cattle\ndips, water tanks, bridges, dispensaries and staff houses;\nmaking energy saving stoves; establishing tree nurseries;\nbeekeeping projects and women's sewing projects. The\ninformation from National Parks headquarters shows that\nUS$ (1.8%) was allocated to 15 national parks for out-\nreach program activities (TANAPA, 2007, cited in\nIn the study villages only Matadi village was supported in\nsupport to complete a student hostel project, however it was\nnot considered by the CCS Department (Interview no. 34,\n2009). According to the CCS Warden, the department does\nnot prioritize projects that had already started claiming that\n'they do not know their quality'. The village leadership\nreported that the outreach department did not take any initia-\ntive to evaluate whether the building project was worthy of\nsupport. Similarly, Namwai village applied for support to\nconstruct a secondary school library. However, the applica-\ntion was unsuccessful as the park claimed that it faced finan-\ncial constraints (Interview CCS Warden, 2011). From the\nhad not been informed about the park's decision on their\napplications. This was a second attempt for Namwai village\ninterviewees stated that they have lost hope in requesting\nhelp from the park.\nThe analysis of revenue sharing data from the CCS\nAlthough Moshi Urban District does not border the park or\ndirectly bear the costs of conservation, it had received more\nfunds than other districts that do directly bear the costs of\nconservation. A good example is Rombo District who had\nschool.\nNyeme and Nilsen (2010) point out another example in\nMwanga District that does not border the park. This was\nmade possible through the then MNRT Minister, who was\nalso a Member of Parliament for that district (Nyeme &\nNilsen, 2010). Not only does the deviation of revenues to\nother areas adversely affect the benefits for park neighbors,\nthe revenue from the higher earning parks, such as KNP, sup-\nports lower earning parks. Furthermore, mishandling and\nmismanagement of revenues received by the National Park's\nheadquarters also adversely affects benefit sharing schemes.\nFor example, in 2009 the Opposition in Parliament sought a\ndetailed explanation on the reported misuse of about 5.6M\nUS$ by National Park's headquarters (Juma, 2009). In addi-\ntion, after their 3-year term, the 12 Board of Trustee Directors\neach received a lump sum of money (Anonymous, 2006).\nRecent criticism of the National Parks headquarters has led\nthe former Director General to resign.\nAt WKFP local communities benefit from the forest plan-\ntation through forest products such as logs (for registered\ncustomers), fodder, firewood, construction poles (during\nthinning), farming opportunities, and casual labor. Logs are\nsold to registered customers from the Kilimanjaro region, the\nArusha region, and some as far away as Kenya. From 2010\npublic institutions and the plantation's neighbors purchase\nlogs mainly for construction purposes. For instance, in\nThe fee for softwood logs ranges from 1.7 to 32 US$/m3\ndepending on diameter, length and species type. Softwood\nthe diameter and length. This revenue belongs to the govern-\nment. Customers are also charged 7 US$/m3 for softwood\nlogs for silvicultural activities and road maintenance in the\nplantation. This revenue is deposited into the Logging\nMiscellaneous Account, managed by the forest plantation.\nThe forest plantation does not sell logs to community\ngroups because second and third pruning and tree felling\nactivities are conducted by the customers themselves. Often,\ncommunity groups deny responsibility when these activities\nare conducted improperly. Villages in need of logs for social\ndevelopment activities obtain them from the forest plantation\nafter seeking permission from TFSA. For individual con-\nstruction purposes the villagers are expected to purchase tim-\nber from sawmills (Interview WKFP, 2012).\nVillagers benefit through casual labor by participating in\nvarious activities that take place in the plantation. For exam-\nple, during the tree planting season people from the sur-\nrounding villages, and from further afield, are involved.\nThey are usually paid 2.5 US$/day and the exercise can take\nup to a month. The villagers also participate in security activ-\nities. There are 19 men and 1 woman from the neighboring\nvillages of Matadi, Engare Nairobi, and Namwai who have\nbeen used as security guards in the plantation. Casual labor is\nalso needed to water the seedlings planted in the nurseries.\nFor this exercise the plantation management considers neigh-\nboring villages because people are needed to work on a daily\nbasis and whenever such labor is required. The local people,\nmainly men, are also involved in the construction and main-\ncasual laborers for various activities in the forest plantation.\nOther benefits associated with the forest plantation include\noffering transport during sickness and burial ceremony when\nthe need arises.\nThe forest plantation also provides farming plots to local\npeople. The availability of plots depends on the extent of\nland available after tree harvesting. Plots vary in size from\ncannot cultivate their plots and those in need of immediate\nmoney sell their plots to rich farmers, while some agree with\nothers to cultivate the plots on their behalf sharing what is\nharvested between them. However, such arrangements are\nusually outside of plantation management control.\nSmall-scale farmers own one to two plots, while large-\nscale farmers may own up to 20 plots. Small-scale farmers\nand persons who do not have plots are sometimes hired by\nlarge-scale farmers. The small-scale farmers manage to\nattend their own plots by setting aside time before or after\nworking as casual laborers for the large-scale farmers.\nFarming is ongoing throughout the year with the main crops\nbeing potatoes, carrots and garden peas and the output from\none plot varies from 5 to 20 sacks. Tree species determine the\nlength of time a farmer can use the plot. For instance, in plots\ngrowing eucalyptus species a farmer could cultivate crops\nfor 2 to 3 years. In plots with pines and cyprus species a\nfarmer could cultivate for up to 4 years, while in less fertile\nareas the time could be extended up to 5 years.\nOverall, the taungya system has benefited many people\nby providing food, cash and employment opportunities. As\none man stated,\". . . through the taungya system many peo-\nple have become rich . . . large-scale farmers earn about\nOctober 2011). However, the local people do not have any\nsecurity in terms of the land. In case of destruction of tree\nspecies, the right to use the land could be terminated and\nthere is no assurance of plot allocation in the future after the\nfirst allocation expires (cf. Dean, 2011). Besides, most per-\nsons interviewed expressed fear and insecurity about their\nlivelihoods in the future. They are concerned that if planta-\ntion management should change or the plantation is priva-\ntized (accompanied by different policies) they may no longer\nhave permission to use the land.\nThe Relationship Between Local Communities,\nthe Park, and the Forest Plantation\nIt is beyond doubt that local people depend on KNP for their\nlivelihood needs, as one interviewee stated, \"We want to get\nour immediate needs like firewood and fodder first before\ndevelopment projects . . .\" (Interview no. 31, 2011). The lack\nof alternatives for their livelihoods results in illegal with-\ndrawal of natural resources from the forest, as one inter-\nviewee remarked:\n. . . is it possible for a poor person to live next to the forest\nwithout a buffer zone and watch the forest without extraction of\nany resource? . . . it is obvious that extraction will occur illegally\nResentment and hatred toward the park have led people to\nenter the forest and withdraw natural resources, including\ngreen wood, as one interviewee stated,\nThey have taken the forest, no entry, no access to forest\nresources, and there is no buffer zone . . . it is a big problem . . .\nthe park has a difficult task to control us from withdrawing the\nforest products, and we have a job of watching them--when\nthey leave we must harvest the resources . . . since we are not\nfree to access the resources, we do things we were not doing\nThe village government leader asserted,\n. . . We cannot convince villagers to stop illegal activities. We\nhave to keep quiet because it is not our property. If villagers\nbenefit from it, they become guards, but now the park restricts\nus from entering the forest . . . If someone enters with a saw, will\nyou arrest such a person? The forest is the way it is today\nThe costs of conservation, such as crop raiding and lack\nof compensation, also contribute to resentment toward the\npark, as one interviewee stated, \"Wild animals destroy our\ncrops so much. If you dare to say or complain they tell you,\nyou are living in a wildlife corridor. We are not allowed to\nFurthermore, there is a lack of communication between\nthe park and the people as one interviewee stated, \"KNP\nworks like military army \". . . there is no communication. We\ndon't know what is going on inside . . . \" (Interview no. 45,\n2011). These voices imply that the relationship between the\npark management and the local people is poor.\nManagement at WKFP reported that the relationship with\nlocal communities is good. Confirming this, many people\ninterviewed stated that the forest plantation is a \"savior\" and\na \"true neighbor\" who cares for their livelihood needs and\nthe less privileged in the community. However, some inter-\nviewees reported instances of favoritism from community\nand plantation management during the allocation of farming\nplots.\nComparison of the Park's and the\nForest Plantation's Participatory\nApproaches\nThe results presented above illustrate the process of the\nexpansion of KNP and its impacts on local people, and dif-\nferent strategies used by KNP and WKFP to involve and ben-\nefit local people. However, the performance of the two areas\nis different despite the fact that they fall under the same min-\nistry. In the following section, I elaborate on the underlying\nfactors contributing to the differences.\nLegal Framework\nThe performance of KNP and WKFP is partly affected by\nsectoral policies and legislation. The legal documents spec-\nify the manner in which local participation and benefit shar-\ning should occur in terms of natural resources management.\nHowever, this study found that the local participation and\nbenefit sharing strategy used by KNP is more rhetoric than\nreality. In practice, the park operates closely under the\n\"fences and fines\" strategy. The park's approach does not\nconsider the needs of local people and, to a large extent, is a\ntrade-off where tourism and conservation goals are met at the\nexpense of local persons livelihood needs. At WKFP the per-\nformance of the plantation clearly reflects a win\u00adwin situa-\ntion where plantation goals, government benefits and local\npersons needs are met.\nAs previously stated, KNP is classified in category II by\nIUCN while WKFP does not fall under any IUCN category.\nWhile this may partly explain the difference in the extent of\nnatural resource access by local people in each area, much is\nleft to consider in terms of benefit sharing, participation in\ndecision making, and management of the two areas.\nTherefore, these aspects are elaborated further below.\nBenefit Sharing\nGiven the KNP's high income levels one would expect more\nbenefit sharing and well established relationships with local\npeople. However, this study finds that several factors have\nshaped the benefit sharing scheme. Firstly, National Park's\nheadquarters applies a set of criteria and procedures for SCIP\napplication, which are bureaucratic, complex, and lacking\ntransparency (cf. E. G. C. Barrow, Gichohi, & Infield, 2000).\nIt is difficult for local communities to follow the required\nprocedures and in most cases education or assistance is\nrequired, particularly for illiterate groups.\nSecondly, the bulk of collected revenues from all national\nparks in Tanzania is remitted to National Park's headquarters.\nHeadquarters channel the operational budget to national\nparks and only up to 7.5% of its operational budget is set\naside for outreach programs to surrounding villages that bear\nthe cost of conservation (see Goldstein, 2005). This system is\ndifferent from other countries like Uganda and Kenya where\nrevenue for local people is derived directly from tourists'\nentry fees (e.g. Tumusiime & Vedeld, 2012).\nThirdly, external political influence affects benefit shar-\ning with funds being diverted to areas not directly affected by\nthe park. Moreover, SCIP applications are sometimes influ-\nenced by district level leaders for political gain and credit\n(Borgerhoff Mulder, Caro, & Msago, 2007).\nFourthly, the mismanagement and misuse of funds by\nNational Park's headquarter officials adversely affects the\nbenefits for local people and the amount of revenue left for\npark outreach programs. Inappropriate leakages and corrup-\ntion in the wildlife sector have previously been reported\n(e.g., Benjaminsen & Bryceson, 2012; Benjaminsen &\nContrary to the KNP benefit sharing scheme, WKFP has\nhad a more positive impact on neighboring villages. Local\ncommunities benefit through; the logs business (for regis-\ntered customers), collection of forest products, engaging in\nincome-producing casual labor activities, and the taungya\nsystem. The demand for (fertile) agricultural land has been\nmet, to some extent, through the plantation's taungya sys-\ntem. The application criteria for taungya plots are much sim-\npler than the KNP's criteria and guidelines for SCIP\napplication. Since the inclusion of the forest into KNP, the\nneed for forest products has been partly met by the forest\nplantation. However, the only type of employment offered is\ncasual labor and casual laborers are paid very little.\nCommunities have opted to accept low pay because they lack\nalternatives and working for the plantation increases their\nchance of obtaining farming plots. Unfortunately, the alloca-\ntion of plots has been adversely affected by favoritism.\nSimilar cases of favoritism in taungya system have also been\nreported in Ghana (Agyeman et al., 2003).\nParticipation in the Management of the Park and\nthe Forest Plantation\nKNP focuses strictly on its structure and has no consider-\nation to local persons contributions toward conservation.\nThere is no local community member that plays an active\nrole in park administration or temporary employment. The\npark considers local people only when there is a fire out-\nbreak; thus, local people claim that they are used as \"tools.\"\nAs a result few turn up to help with fire incidents while oth-\ners demand payment. KNP's exclusion of local people from\npark management contributes to the negative relationship\nthat exists between the park and the people. Paraskevopoulos,\nKorfiatis, and Pantis (2003) found that social exclusion neg-\natively affects conservation attitudes. WKFP does involve\nlocal people in plantation management through different\nactivities, and has created positive interaction with sur-\nrounding communities. In this case local people participate\nwillingly to help with fire incidents. However, in both areas\nparticipation is used as a means to improve efficiency in\nproduction and/or conservation. Both areas operate on the\nlowest level of the \"participation ladder,\" although the par-\nticipation level of WKFP seems to be higher than that of\nKNP. Many of KNP failures/shortcomings coincide with\nother protective management studies elsewhere where focus\nis on structural barriers toward successful public participa-\ntion (e.g., Lachapelle, McCool, & Patterson, 2003; Wilson,\nParticipation in Decision Making\nKNP and WKFP share a centralized structure in terms of\ndecision making on matters pertaining to the management of\nnatural resources and benefit sharing. It is difficult for com-\nmunities to influence or challenge the operation of the cen-\ntral structure. The park management system does not allow\nspace for local people's opinions because of its top-down and\nparamilitary nature. This was revealed during the inclusion\nof the forest reserve into the park, as there was no awareness\nraising or sensitization about changes of user rights and\nhence the process took people by surprise (see Lerkelund,\n2011). In addition, only district leaders who make decisions\nhave been involved in choosing development projects for\nThere has not been any opportunity for villagers to contrib-\nute to the park's planning and decision-making processes nor\nhas there been dialogue with park staff to express their prob-\nlems and seek solutions (cf. Anthony, 2007; E. G. C. Barrow\net al., 2000). Moreover, most of the revenue collected has\nbeen retained by the National Park's headquarters and local\npeople have no power or influence over its allocation.\nIn the case of WKFP, local persons have no power or share\nin the revenue collected from logs and poles sold, apart from\npayments received for casual labor (cf. Agyeman et al., 2003;\nAmoah, 2009). Additionally, they have no influence over the\namount paid for casual labor, nor do they receive any incen-\ntive for tending trees. The income from logs sold is remitted\nto the central government. Although local people in the forest\nplantation are viewed as beneficiaries, they are not involved\nin decision making over forest use (cf. Alden Wily, 2002).\nGillingham and Lee (1999) point out that the lack of partici-\npation in decision making shapes local persons perceptions of\nprotected areas and affects their relationships with govern-\nment conservation institutions and other stakeholders.\nAndrade and Rhodes (2012) found that local community par-\nticipation in the protected area decision-making process is\nsignificantly related to the level of compliance with protected\narea polices. Silori's (2006) study in India found that lack of\ninvolvement of the local people in the decision-making pro-\ncesses and in forest management groups were major causes of\nnegative attitudes toward protected areas.\nCommunication and Awareness\nThere is generally a lack of communication between KNP\nand villagers. There has not been any awareness raising\nactivities to increase public awareness and participation in\nconservation efforts. Local persons mainly experience the\nnegative side of the relationship with the park through fines,\nimprisonment, and restrictions (cf. Durrant, 2004). This lack\nof communication and conservation awareness about the\npark's objectives and mission may contribute to the negative\nrelationship between the park and local persons. Holmes's\n(2003) study in western Tanzania found that the number of\nvisits of national parks personnel to the village was associ-\nated with positive attitudes. Fiallo and Jacobson's (1995)\nstudy in Ecuador found that low level of awareness regarding\nconservation issues was associated with negative attitudes\ntoward protected areas. Nevertheless, Heinen and Shrivastava\n(2009) found that higher level of awareness on regulations\nwas associated with negative attitudes toward conservation.\nContrary to KNP, the WKFP plantation staff visit villages\nand raise awareness about environmental issues and fire con-\ntrol measures.\nRelationship\nSome studies argue that the fear of law enforcement officials\nreduces anti-conservation behavior (e.g., Aipanjiguly &\nJacobson, 2002). However, this study found that people are\nengaged in illegal withdrawal of resources from the park\nregardless of patrols by park rangers for the following rea-\nsons: lack of, or very few benefits; denial of access to natural\nresources; lack of buffer zones to harvest natural resources;\nill-treatment when found in the park; and lack of compensa-\ntion for crop raiding. In addition, villagers referred to the\npark staff as \"enemies\" who do not care about their liveli-\nhoods (cf.Anthony, 2007). Given the fact that land is a scarce\nresource in villages surrounding the park (see Hemp, 2006),\ndependence on the park's natural resources for livelihood\nneeds is unavoidable. Silori's (2006) study in India found\nthat restricted access to forest resources for local persons\nlivelihood needs resulted in negative attitudes among them\ntoward the biosphere reserve. Similarly, Arjunan, Holmes,\nPuyravaud, and Davidar (2006) found that exclusion of peo-\nple from a forest to protect biodiversity often antagonizes\nlocal communities.\nWhile local communities bear the costs of conservation\nthey do not receive any tangible benefits to offset these costs\n(cf. Kideghesho, 2006). In addition, the target of benefits\nfrom the park is not immediate nor does it address felt needs.\nThe scheme tends to focus on infrastructure, which remains\nthe only testimony of support provided (Redford & Fearn,\nin western Tanzania, revealing that individuals who perceived\nactive extension services from national parks held more posi-\ntive attitudes toward the park than those who did not.\nAt WKFP benefits obtained by the local people seem to\naffect the relationship positively. This is revealed through\nlocal persons responses in cases of fire outbreaks, during tree\nplanting activities and their corresponding attitude toward\nplantation staff. In cases of fire outbreaks, their responses are\nquick and they do not demand payment. The community\nregards the forest plantation as a \"savior\" as far as their live-\nlihoods are concerned. This is because the plantation is the\nmain alternative for their livelihoods since the inclusion of\nthe forest reserve into the park.\nWhy Do the Park and the Forest Plantation\nPerform Differently?\nThe findings and explanation given above show that KNP\noffers limited opportunities for local people to participate\nand benefit from natural resources, compared with WKFP.\nThe difference observed is related to the legal framework\nreforms that took place in the 1990s following the country's\neconomic crisis in the 1980s and the loss of resources and\ndeclining capacity of the central government. Institutional\nchanges in both sectors (forestry and wildlife) have contin-\nued since the 1990s, however they have not necessarily been\nin ways proposed or intended by local proponents of reforms\nand/or donors (Nelson & Blomley, 2010). The reforms have\nfaced resistance due to the interests and incentives that politi-\ncal elites, central agencies, and private commercial interests\npose for expanding and/or maintaining control over land and\nnatural resources (Nelson & Agrawal, 2008). Consequently,\nreforms were not carried out as intended because competing\nstate and private commercial interests considered the\nresources \"too valuable to allow ordinary citizens to own\"\nAccording to Nelson and Blomley (2010), the economic\ncrisis of the1980s prompted policy makers to implement\nwide-ranging policy changes that were more community-\nbased and decentralized. The process of policy formulation\nwas dominated by international donors, NGOs, technical\nadvisors, and government officials within the MNRT. The\nsame authors argue that, in the forestry sector, donors man-\naged to leverage the process due to FBD's lack of alternative\nsources of political power and financial capital. Nevertheless,\nin the wildlife sector, donors had very little influence due to\nthe ability of policy makers to acquire rents from tourism\nthat provided them with financial assets that enabled them to\ndeflect reform pressure from donors (Nelson & Blomley,\n2010). Consequently, donors failed to bring about the reforms\nnecessary for positive and direct impacts on rural livelihoods\nAlthough the two sectors are under the same ministry, the\nexisting legal framework causes them to work in different\ndirections indicating that the outputs might be different in\nterms of participation levels and benefits channeled to local\ncommunities. Blomley and Iddi (2009) conclude that the\n\"legal uncertainty caused by the parallel and disconnected\ndevelopment of wildlife and forest policies and laws results\nin inefficiencies and wasted opportunities for poverty reduc-\ntion and sustainable land [natural resources] management\"\nConclusions and Recommendations\nThis article has presented findings on participatory\napproaches used by a national park and a forest plantation in\nTanzania. How the park and plantation work and how they\naffect the relationship with local people and the resulting\nattitudes toward the study areas has been presented.\nConservationists, government officials, and development\npartnershavepresentedthenotionofparticipatoryapproaches\nas a \"win-win\" strategy where conservation and local bene-\nfits can be combined. Many conservation institutions have\nused this strategy to win local people's support for conserva-\ntion. However, this study shows that although some aspects\nof participatory approaches seem to be typical in KNP, it is\nevident that the park operates closely under the \"fences and\nfines\" strategy. This is contrary to the other case of WKFP\nwhere local people are involved and benefit through various\nactivities in the forest plantation. In both cases, we have seen\nthat the extent of local participation and the amount of ben-\nefits accrued seem to determine the communities' relation-\nship with the study areas.\nMany factors affect the level of participation and extent of\nbenefits for local people, which can be summarized as fol-\nlows. At KNP the factors include bureaucratic procedures for\nSCIP applications; lack of, or few benefits; lack of transpar-\nency; deviation of funds; lack of decision making; minimal/\npassive participation; and lack of communication and aware-\nness. At WKFP, the factors include lack of decision making,\ntoo little payment for casual labor, corruption in allocating\ntaungya plots, and lack of revenue sharing from logs sold.\nThis article highlights that the differences observed between\nthe park and forest plantation are related to sectoral legal\nreforms that occurred in the 1990s following the economic\nSome issues were raised in the interviews (Table 1) that\nthe management of the KNP and WKFP can consider to\nenhance positive relationships and thus reduce the costs of\nconservation. In the case of KNP local people desire regular\npositive communication with park staff, tangible benefits\nfrom the park's tourism revenues, and some degree of deci-\nsion making over park conservation issues. They also seek\npayment in case of fire, if they cannot harvest natural\nresources, and a buffer zone in which they can collect natural\nresources. At WKFP local people desire the plantation man-\nagement to allow community groups to participate in logging\nbusiness deals, to benefit in the form of income from logs and\npoles sold, and join hands in the plantation management.\nThe findings of this article show the failure of the park's\nparticipatory approach to create good relationship with adja-\ncent communities through local participation in management\nand benefit sharing, and the plantations'efforts to build good\nrelationship with adjacent local people. The findings also\nindicate that the extent of benefits received and the degree of\nparticipation used are associated with the negative/positive\nattitudes toward the study areas. This article concludes that\nfor local people to support conservation efforts and resist\nillegal activities, the park should allow meaningful local par-\nticipation in park management and equitable sharing in the\npark's benefits.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The\nauthor acknowledges financial support from the EKOSIASA proj-\nect funded by the Norwegian Programme for Development,\nResearch and Education (NUFU) and the PAPIA project (Protected\nAreas and Poverty in Africa) funded by the Research Council of\nNorway.\nNotes\n1.
