In sub-\nSaharan Africa (SSA), MNS are largely neglected, misdiagnosed, or mistreated [4]. The process\nof integrating mental health services into primary health care has been delayed in part by con-\nstraints in health infrastructure in rural areas, and service availability is usually limited to ter-\ntiary psychiatric facilities [5,6]. In South Africa, 16.5% of adults suffered from a common\nmental disorder (anxiety, depression, substance abuse) in the past year; only 5.6% of those\nwith a disorder received allopathic health treatment [7]. MNS services are now being intro-\nduced in primary care facilities in an effort to engage patients with lower incomes and those\nliving in rural areas, yet integration is slow [4]. The recognition of the paucity of allopathic\nmental health care providers in South Africa's public sector--there are only 0.4 psychiatrists\nand 0.3 psychologists per 100,000 people [8]\u00adhas led to innovative solutions, including task\nsharing models being proposed and recently adopted in the government's Mental Health Pol-\nicy Framework and Action Plan (2013\u00ad2020)[9]. However, even with these innovative policies,\nchallenges in implementing the integration remain [10].\nIt is widely believed in SSA that traditional healers have the unique ability to diagnose and\ntreat physical and emotional conditions brought about by such causes as social misconduct,\nspirits, spells, and sorcery, which allopathic clinicians lack the ability to treat [11\u00ad14]. Addi-\ntionally, healers typically speak patients' preferred local languages, are often living closer to\nand more readily available to attend to patients, and allocate more time to explain diagnoses,\ncauses of illnesses, and treatments with patients [15]. Traditional healers may be able to pro-\nvide therapy and services that allopathic health systems are not able to provide. Motivated by\nthese factors, as well as limitations amidst the allopathic workforce and infrastructure, patients\nexperiencing a variety of acute and chronic mental and physical health concerns often frequent\na traditional healer instead of, or in conjunction with, seeking allopathic services [15\u00ad19]. This\ntype of medical pluralism, combined with the present divide between the traditional and allo-\npathic systems, results in patients \"ping-ponging\" between the two systems, often receiving\ninsufficient care to sustainably improve their health and well-being [7,17]. Among patients\nwho do receive mental health services, few receive counseling or support for long-term treat-\nment adherence. Widespread social stigma surrounding mental health illness and lack of per-\nceived appropriate biomedical care results in avoidance of health-seeking behaviors for\nsuspected MNS disorders [20,21]. Little community outreach is done to educate affected fami-\nlies. These barriers often lead to delayed, intermittent or abandoned biomedical care resulting\nin increased morbidity and mortality [1,14,22\u00ad29]. Traditional healers, given their respected\nposition within the community, physical proximity to patients and cultural understanding\nHealer's treatment of mental, neurological and substance abuse in South Africa\nmay be able to overcome a number of these traditional barriers to support the provision of\nintegrated mental health care.\nAmong South Africans with a chronic DSM-IV diagnosis in 2009, 29% reported seeking\nallopathic care, 9% sought traditional care, and 11% saw a spiritual or religious advisor. Predic-\ntors for seeking traditional care were older age, black race, lower education level, unemploy-\nment, and experiencing anxiety or substance abuse issues [30]. Patients continue to seek\ntraditional care for MNS ailments, and healers continue to treat patients for these disorders\n[30,31]; however, there is a paucity of information available regarding the frequency and types\nof treatments for MNS illnesses offered by traditional healers working in South Africa. More\ninformation is needed concerning which MNS conditions healers elect to treat, beliefs about\ndisease etiology, treatment methods undertaken, and the cost for treatment. We conducted\nthis mixed-methods study with a sample of local traditional healers to investigate which MNS\nconditions traditional healers treat and the cost of treatment as well as the traditional healers'\nwillingness to work with the allopathic health care system.\nMethods\nStudy location\nWe conducted this study in the sub-district of Agincourt located in the Bushbuckridge area of\nMpumalanga province in South Africa, roughly 500 km northeast of Johannesburg. The MRC/\nWits Agincourt Research Unit (www.agincourt.co.za) manages the Agincourt Health and\nSocio-Demographic Surveillance Site (HDSS), which since 1992 has continuously undertaken\npopulation-based health and demographic research [32\u00ad34]. The Agincourt HDSS population\n31 research villages. About one-third of the HDSS population, which is mainly xi-Tsonga-\nspeaking, is made up of Mozambican refugees (or descendants of) who had immigrated to\nSouth Africa in the 1980s. The research site includes seven government-run health clinics\n(providing free, basic outpatient care, including immunization, family planning, testing and\ntreatment for sexually transmitted infections, minor trauma and chronic disease care), one\npublic-private community health center (focusing on HIV and tuberculosis treatment as well\nas chronic non-communicable disease treatment), and one sizeable public health center,\nwhich provides 24-hour maternity care as well as acute care and 48-hour patient observation.\nPatients seen at the health centers are referred, when needed, to three district hospitals, each\nlocated roughly 25\u00ad55 km from the site, generally requiring public transport for travel.\nStudy population\nWe used this registration list of the Kukula Traditional healer organization to randomly sam-\nple participants through the random selection function in Stata1 (StataCorp, LP, College Sta-\ntion, Texas, USA).[35] The Kukula Traditional Healer organization is an organization of\nroughly 300 registered traditional healers who work within the Bushbuckridge area and is the\nonly organized group of healers living in the region. Out of a total of 280 registered healers,\n169 were randomly selected to participate (using Stata1 13); of these four no longer lived in\nthe research area, and five had since died (95% response rate). Each of the remaining 160 heal-\ners who were approached accepted to participate in the study (i.e., 100% acceptance rate). We\nconducted qualitative interviews until data saturation around attitudes towards mental health\ntreatment practices was reached. We enrolled 133 participants in the quantitative portion of\nour study to ensure we could estimate (with 95% confidence) the proportion of healers who\ntreated HIV (the focus of a related study with the same population of healers) with a precision\nHealer's treatment of mental, neurological and substance abuse in South Africa\nData collection\nWith the random sample of traditional healers from the Bushbuckridge area we conducted 27\n(IDIs) were completed first in order to gather data regarding the illnesses healers treated,\nwhich they felt they had treated most effectively, causes of those illnesses, their preferred treat-\nment methods, service fees charged to patients, and their thoughts about the ability of allo-\npathic medicine to treat these illnesses. Specifically, healers described the symptoms they could\neffectively treat or cure, and were asked the xi-Tsonga and English word for that illness (if\nknown). All interviews and surveys were conducted using the xi-Tsonga disease name identi-\nfied by the healers during qualitative interviews.\nThe IDIs were conducted in the language the traditional healer was most conversant in\n(mainly xi-Tsonga) in the location of the traditional healer's choosing (generally, in the tradi-\ntional healer's home or place of work) by a trained qualitative study team member (SN). Inter-\nviews lasted an average of 61 minutes during which we asked healers, what types of traditional\nmental illnesses they treated, the symptoms associated with each illness, what treatments they\ncould provide, patient prognosis, and what, if any, allopathic diagnosis they associated with\nthe traditional diagnosis.\nBased on findings from the IDIs, we developed quantitative surveys to determine which ill-\nness(es) healers treated, their thoughts on the effectiveness of treatments they provide, and fees\ncharged. MNS-specific illnesses focused on included: (1) seizure disorders; (2) patients who\nhave lost touch with reality; (3) paralysis on one side of the body, and (4) substance abuse\n(drug and alcohol abuse). Data was also gathered regarding the number and type of patient\ndiagnoses within the previous seven and 30-day time periods.\nData availability\nData are available on the Harvard dataverse at http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TAJKBK.[36]\nData analysis\nParticipant characteristics, service provision, and cost per service were presented as frequen-\ncies with percentages, means, and medians with interquartile ranges (IQR). Multivariable\nlogistic regression was used to model the odds of treating select MNS disorders, including sei-\nzure disorders, patients who have lost touch with reality, substance abuse, and paralysis on one\nside of the body, which is often associated with stroke. All regressions reported in this study\nwere adjusted for age, level of education, immigrant status, number of patients per month, and\ntype of healer.\nWithin two weeks of conducting the interview the qualitative data were transcribed into the\nlocal language and were then translated into English (as needed). Two research team members\nwith considerable experience conducting qualitative research completed the thematic analysis\nusing MAXQDA1 (VERBI GmbH, Berlin, Germany) software. Coding was carefully\nreviewed for agreement; comparison of coding for the first five interviews found 90% agree-\nment using Cohen's Kappa in MAXQDA1. Any incongruities in coding were resolved\nthrough consensus.\nEthical approvals\nApproval was received for this study from the Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board (IRB #\nstudy participants provided written informed consent.\nHealer's treatment of mental, neurological and substance abuse in South Africa\nResults\nTraditional healer demographics\nHealers sampled from the rural Bushbuckridge area were predominantly female (77%), older\n(58 years; interquartile range [IQR]: 50\u00ad67), had long-term experience practicing traditional\n4.2). Ninety-two healers (69%) self-identified primarily as an Inyanga (herbalist) healer, while\n34 (26%) self-identified as a Sangoma (divine treatment) healer, and 5% identified as \"other\".\nParticipating healers who were actively treating patients at the time of the study reported see-\ning a median of three patients in the previous week. Slightly more than half the responding\nhealers reported no association with any particular religion (n = 68, 52%), while the most com-\nmon self-identified affiliations were Zion (n = 19, 15%), Apostolic (n = 11, 9%), and Bandla\nLama Nazaretha (n = 10, 8%). Healers were asked if they, their parents and/or grandparents\nhad emigrated from Mozambique, to which 94 (71%) responded positively; however, only 4\n(3%) reported fluency in Portuguese. Healers reported their most commonly spoken languages\nDiagnosis and treatment\nPerceived ability to diagnosis and treat. Healers claimed the ability to successfully treat\nthe following MNS illnesses: seizure disorders (47%), patients who had lost touch with reality\n(47%), patients with depressive symptoms (22%), patients with paralysis on one side of the\nbody (59%), and substance abuse (21%) (Table 1). Collectively, healers reported that in the\nmonth prior to their survey interview, they treated two adults and three children with seizure\ndisorders, five adults and one child who had lost touch with reality, two adults who had experi-\nenced paralysis on one side of the body, and six adults who were `possessed by an evil spirit'. In\naddition, healers provided medications to seven infants to prevent the development of seizure\ndisorders.\nMany interviewees alluded to a long-standing history of healers treating mental illness and\nrelated disorders; as one healer explained, \"It is a natural illness and even in the past the tradi-\ntional healers were treating patients with mental illness and even now they are still treating them\nand they get cured\" (male, 59 years). Some healers acknowledge that they are able to diagnose\nand know the cause of their patients' illnesses without testing: \"we have been given that gift as\nseer\" (female, 54 years). For others, the possibility of curing a mental illness depends on how\nlong the patient has had symptoms, for example, \"if . . . it has started last month or two months\nback, I will cure that person but if it's after some years, no I will not able to cure that person\nTable 1. Percentages of healers treating MNS disorders and associated costs.\n% Treat Cost (median, IQR)* Cost (mean, SD)*\n*All costs are reported in South African Rand (US$1 = ~14 Rand).\nHealer's treatment of mental, neurological and substance abuse in South Africa\nbecause the illness is very strong in his body\" (male, 31 years). Further still, not all healers are\nconfident in their ability to treat, or may lack any desire to attempt to treat mental illness or\nMNS disorders; as one healer revealed, \"I am scared of people with mental illness . . . my father\nwas treating people with mental illness and when he try to teach me I said no, I don't want to do\nthis\" (female, 74 years). Some healers intimated that certain mental illnesses cannot be cured:\n\"What I can tell you is that mental illness is incurable; there are times when it will come again\"\n(female, 43 years), but may be controlled with recurrent traditional treatments: \"When you\nhave mental illness you have to go to the healer who treated you after a year so that he can give\nyou the treatment again\" (male, 67 years).\nSeizure disorders (xi-Tsonga name: Mavabyi ya ku wa). Forty-seven percent of healers\nbelieved they could successfully treat adults experiencing Mavabyi Ya Ku Wa. There was\nstrong agreement about the symptoms and cause of seizure disorders. On healer explained\n\"It's a snake that causes it, you find that the snake that is inside turn and it cause him to have\nseizure. People live with many organs in their body, there is a snake that allows food to enter\nand there is a snake that gives life; the one that allow food is working together with the one in\nthe brain. If the snake can turn and look down and then it will cause seizure to a person. . .\nWhen a person has the illness he will start by looking like he is lonely, after that he will have\nseizure.\" (male, 67 years) The snake is also thought to cause seizures in children, although the\nsymptoms were described slightly differently. \"When the child is born you find that she has\nhiccups and most of the time and it is a snake that is inside her that makes the hiccups, when\nthe snake starts you will hear the sound inside and the child will vomit in most of the time.\nThen you will take the child to the hospital to consult, and by the time you are doing that the\nsnake is growing inside the child. And when she grow up and stop breastfeeding you find that\nshe starts to have seizure and collapse. It caused by a snake\" (female, unknown age). Many\nhealers conveyed confidence in treating seizure disorders, particularly in children. Treatment\noptions included a mixture of trees given in a tea, the mixture of herbs mixed with porridge,\nand mixing a patient's blood with that of a pig. Still, some healers express hesitation to treat sei-\nzure disorders, as one noted when asked regarding the cause of the disorder: \"I don't know. I\ndidn't want to treat it because I was scared of those people when they have seizure\" (female, 74\nyears).\nEach additional year of formal education received by healers was associated with lower\nodds of treating seizure disorders (OR: 0.83 p = 0.017). Each additional patient a healer saw in\nthe previous week was associated with greater odds of treating seizure disorder (OR: 1.10\np = 0.033). Gender, type of healer, and immigration status were not associated with different\ntreatment practices (Table 2).\nLosing touch with reality (xi-Tsonga name: Nhlanyi). Forty-seven percent of healers\nbelieved they could successfully treat an adult who had lost touch with reality (xi-Tsonga\nTable 2. Odds of treating seizure disorders (xi-Tsonga name: Mavabyi ya ku wa).\nOdds Ratio Standard Errors 95% CI\n*statistically significant: p-value <0.05\nHealer's treatment of mental, neurological and substance abuse in South Africa\nname: Nhlanyi) There was agreement among healers that this condition could manifest itself\ndifferently among patients, but one healer best described the symptoms of Nhlanyi: \"You will\nsee him/her counting numbers that doesn't exist, laughing and do[ing] things that are not nor-\nmal; they differ on their illnesses. There are some those when they are mental ill they will be\nrunning around, some will walk naked and some will always be laughing (woman, 45 years).\nHealers explained the cause of the illness to be a source outside the patient: \"Some you find that\nthey have demons and [they] are the ones that are making her to be [mentally] ill. And then if\nyou give her treatment for the calling, you find that she will be cured\" (female, 37 years). Others\nconveyed that while they are able to minimize associated behaviors and psychosis, they may\nnot always be able to cure the disorder: \"When a person comes being mentally ill, you find that\nhe is running around . . . I am able to give him treatment that will help him to have less power\nand he will stop fighting people. Then when I realize that I am failing to treat him, I will take him\nto hospital\" (male, 31 years). Herbal remidies were delivered via drops into the patient ears and\neyes to ensure the treatment directly reached the brain. Female healers demonstrated lower\nodds of treating Nhlanyi than their male counterparts (OR: 0.26 p = 0.024), while those who\nhad emigrated from Mozambique had greater odds of treating this illness (OR: 2.86 p = 0.032).\nEach additional patient a healer cared for was associated with higher odds for treating Nhlanyi\n(OR: 1.17 p = 0.010). Formal education was not associated with willingness to treat Nhlanyi\n(Table 3).\nParalysis on one side of the body (xi-Tsong name: Ku Oma Rihlanguti). Fifty-nine per-\ncent of healers believed they could successfully treat an adult patient who had experienced a\nparalyses on one side of the body (xi-Tsong: Ku Oma Rihlanguti; Table 4). None of the healer\ncharacteristics examined were found to have a statistically significant association with differ-\nence in odds for treating paralysis symptoms (Table 5). Paralysis on one side of the body was\nthought to either be caused by \"a nerve that has blocked the movement of blood\" (female, 54\nyears) or \"by thinking a lot. . .the nerves on the head get tired and start to ache; you will be\naffected by stress and it will be followed by Ku Oma Rihlanguti\" (male 59 years). The traditional\nsolution was to \"cut that nerve.. .. Then we are able to trick the ku oma rihlanguti not to con-\ntinue and attack other nerves in the body and she will be cured on the paralyzed side.\" (female, 54\nyears). This same healer explained the challenge of working with Ku Oma Rihlanguti patients\nwho go to the health clinic, \"they are doing physiotherapy, injecting and give them tablets but she\nwill never be cured. She is going to walk because they are training her but it will not be the same\nas when she is at the traditional healer . . . It's about consulting early to us because if you went to\nthe clinic and they inject you for a long time, it is hard to treat you and get well\" (female, 54\nyears).\nSubstance use. Twenty-one percent of healers believed they could treat an adult patient\nwith active substance abuse. Healers were hesitant to treat patients who used drugs or alcohol,\nTable 3. Odds of treating some who has lost touch with reality (Nhlanyi).\nOdds Ratio Standard Errors 95% CI\n*statistically significant: p-value <0.05\nHealer's treatment of mental, neurological and substance abuse in South Africa\nbelieving that the patient will continue to use drugs or alcohol regardless of the treatment pro-\nvided. Female healers were less likely to treat substance abuse disorders (OR: 0.25 p = 0.012),\nwhile each additional year of education completed was associated with lower odds of treating\nsubstance abuse (OR: 0.81 p = 0.032). No significant association was found between a healer's\nage, healer type, immigration status, or the number of patients they attended to in a week and\ntheir odds for treating substance abuse disorders (Table 5).\nCost for treatment. According to interview responses regarding cost for services pro-\nvided to adults, median reported fees charged for treating (i) substance abuse was 500 South\nAfrican Rand (~US$35), (ii) 1000 Rand (~US$70) for treating seizure disorders and paralysis\non half of the body, and (iii) 1500 Rand (~US$105) to treat patients who have lost touch with\nreality. Many healers see their profession as not only important, but lucrative: \"In the past there\nwas no money when you are a healer but nowadays it's better because there is money . . . and they\nare very expensive when they charge\" (female, 75 years). Another healer described an incentive\nto treat patients while not charging more than necessary, \"If I have treated someone, his relative\nwill tell other people that their patient has been cured then I will get more money after that. They\ntold us in our organization not to overcharge a person\" (male, 78 years). Healers often recognize\nthe financial constraints of poorer patients, and may choose to lower fees or accept payment(s)\nin-kind; as one healer noted, \"Maybe you come to the healer with a blanket, they will allow it\nbecause [our ancestors] were not after money and we are following their footsteps,\" and patients\nmay even \"pay by credit until you finish your installment\" (female, unknown age). Another\nhealer supported this notion: \"This illness is very expensive because not everyone is able to treat\nand cure them, I can charge R1500 but when you don't have it we don't force you to pay because\nwe want you to be cured\" (female, 37 years). Many healers acknowledge that treating mental\ndisorders is challenging, and some only charge patients if and when their illness has been\ncured, as one stated, \"I don't charge a patient if he is not cured\" (male, 31 years).\nReferral to allopathic care. Some healers perceive the importance of allopathic care and\nreport initially referring (at least adult) patients to the clinic to be tested for HIV before they\nTable 4.

As one explained, \"We don't give treatment to the patient when she arrives but we\nhave to refer her to the clinic to be tested [for] everything . . . if they say [she] needs Western treat-\nment then we will not give the patient our treatments. Then we allow the hospital to do their job\nand when they are done then the patient can come to us to be treated [for] illnesses that are\nrelated to traditional\" (female, unknown age). Another healer explained the difficulty that,\n\"According to the law from Kukula association [the local Bushbuckridge traditional healers' asso-\nciation] says we have to refer the patient to the clinic but I didn't refer anyone because I didn't\nhave the forms to refer the patient with\" (male, 78 years). Many other healers suggested that\nrelying on allopathic medicine for mental illness is fruitless, as treatments from clinicians\nwould at best only control symptoms but never cure the disorders, which they believe could\nonly be achieved through traditional care.\nDiscussion\nAbout half of the traditional healers in the Bushbuckridge region of South Africa were confi-\ndent in their ability to treat seizure disorders, patients who had lost touch with reality, and\nparalysis. Health care providers have reason to be concerned, given the potential negative\nimpact on the prognosis of patients who delay or interrupt allopathic services. Patients with\nuntreated seizure disorders risk severe brain injury [37]depression [38] and increased risk of\nmortality [39,40], while often being restricted from participating in normal daily activities,\nincluding school or employment. Given that capacity to effectively control many seizure disor-\nders exists locally at no cost (specifically treatment for epilepsy), patients seeking traditional\ntreatment for uncontrolled seizure disorders may be delaying effective biomedical treatment.\nThe provision of traditional treatment of patients who have lost touch with reality is also\nconcerning, as they may be suffering from psychosis, dementia, or bipolar depression. Early\nidentification and treatment could improve the lives of many of these patients [40] as these ill-\nnesses are associated with high risk of early mortality[41\u00ad43], disability[44,45], and decreased\nquality of life and depression[46,47] [48]. Finally, the delay in care seeking among people who\nhave experienced paralysis could result in additional risk of sensory disturbance and vertigo/\ndizziness if the symptoms were caused by a stroke and increase the risk of mortality [49,50]\nand reduced quality of life among survivors who do not receive effective rehabilitation[51].\nConsidering the low median income and the accessibility of free primary health care, the\ncost of healers' traditional treatment is comparably high [52]. A recent South African study on\ncost for epilepsy treatment found that compared to allopathic care, the costs for traditional\nmedicine was appreciably higher and varied in terms of cost by patient, with one patient\nreporting to only have to pay if the epilepsy is cured [53]. Our study and other research con-\nducted in the Bushbuckridge area lead us to presume that many local patients with MNS symp-\ntoms do seek out, accept and pay for traditional treatments [17]. While our study did not\naddress the question of healer qualifications or success in reducing or eliminating patient\nsymptoms, a recent systematic review suggests healer treatment may improve acute relapses of\nmajor mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but has little impact on the\nlong term progression of the disease [54]. In contrast, common mental disorders, including\ndepression, anxiety, and social difficulties seem more likely to respond to traditional treat-\nApproximately 20% of healers reported treating substance abuse (alcohol and drugs). Given\nthe high prevalence of alcohol in the rural South African context [55,56], the hesitancy of heal-\ners to provide treatment for these conditions is surprising. Interestingly, there is little allo-\npathic treatment for substance abuse in rural Bushbuckridge, perhaps indicating local\nperception that this behavior cannot be modified. Healers expressed the belief that patients\nHealer's treatment of mental, neurological and substance abuse in South Africa\nwith substance abuse problems could only be treated if they expressed the desire stop abusing\ndrugs or alcohol; few community members appear to seek traditional support for substance\nabuse issues.\nWhile our study found Inyanga healers more likely to treat paralysis and substance abuse,\nthey have also been found to be less likely than other healers to refer patients with mental\nhealth concerns to allopathic care [57]. A recent study among South African traditional healers\nfound healer attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and past referral behavior to be predictive\nof healers' intention to refer mentally ill patients to allopathic care [57]. South African healers\nare, in fact, already routinely and often successfully partnering with the biomedical health sys-\ntem to care for patients suspected of or known to have HIV and/or TB, especially in providing\nsuch patients referral services to clinical centers, which the government requires and healers\nare extremely cautious of breaking this regulation [58]. This referral process remains informal\nand unrecorded. Yet competency with and completion of the referral process remain an\nimportant skill and behavior, and transferring this to the identification of patients with MNS\ndisorders is both practicable and socially acceptable [58].\nWhile our study allows for potential extrapolation of results to the region's broader tradi-\ntional practitioner population, we also recognize potential limitations of our findings. We\ndo not know how healer diagnoses translate to allopathic categories of disease. Healers\nwould often volunteer the corresponding allopathic name for the traditional illness, but\nthere was no way to verify that their perception was accurate. Because of this limitation we\nhave used illnesses descriptions or the xi-Tsonga name for illnesses described by the healers,\nnot the biomedical name. While our sample was a random sample of traditional healers in\nthe Kukula organization, we recognize that our sample may not reflect the behavior of heal-\ners outside of Bushbuckridge. Healers' memory from the previous month of the number of\npatients treated, diagnoses and treatments given, payments received and treatment out-\ncomes may all have been affected by recall bias. Furthermore, it possible is that social desir-\nability bias influenced some healers to under report their treatment of MNS-related\ndisorders, if concerned about criticism from the biomedical system. Attempts were made to\nreduce the potential for this bias by having the interviewer inform participating healers that\nresponses would not be reported to local or other government or health authorities. Finally,\nthis study recruited participants who were members of the Kukula association. There are\nlikely some traditional healers in the area who are not members of this association but we\nhave no data about these individuals.\nConclusion\nIn rural northeastern South Africa many practicing traditional healers are continuing to see\npatients and offer treatments for MNS disorders and related symptoms, and often charge high\nfees compared to the otherwise free or reduced costs of care at public health facilities. While\nhealers were able to link traditionally defined mental illness to allopathic diagnoses, about half\nwere confident in their ability to cure seizure disorders, patients who have lost touch with real-\nity, and paralysis on one side of the body. Given the negative long-term health implications of\ndelayed health seeking among people suffering with any of these conditions, there is a signifi-\ncant need to better understand areas for possible collaboration in the care of patients with\nMNS illnesses. Through identifying effective and affordable MNS treatments, promoting\napplicable communication strategies between the systems, and supporting practitioners within\nboth systems to offer patients the best-suited therapies, treatment and management of MNS ill-\nnesses can be vastly improved in this region, the burden of disease reduced and patients' qual-\nity of life improved.\nHealer's treatment of mental, neurological and substance abuse in South Africa\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization: Carolyn M.
