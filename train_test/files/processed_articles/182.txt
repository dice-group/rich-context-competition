Proportional hazards regression was used to\nestimate hazard ratios for the lowest quintile of serum folate compared with the\nhighest quintile for selected causes of death and disease incidence.\nnmol/1 compared with other participants.\nConclusions Low levels of serum folate may be associated with mortality from all-causes and\ncardiovascular disease. However, the study lacked power to adequately examine\nthe association between folate and disease-specific endpoints. Additional studies,\nusing serum and other measures of folate nutritional status, are needed to\nexamine the relationship between folate nutrition and other more specifically\ndefined health outcomes.\nKeywords Cohort study, cardiovascular diseases, folic acid, mortality, neoplasms, risk factors\nVarious studies, mostly of case-control design, have suggested\nthat a higher intake of folate is associated with a reduced risk\nof all-cause mortality,1 cervical dysplasia and cancer,2\"4 breast\ncolorectal adenoma12\"14 and hyperplastic colon polyps,15 and\nmyocardial infarction.16 Furthermore, studies of folate supple-\nmentation have shown improvements in the cytological appear-\nance of cervical dysplasia,17 bronchial squamous metaplasia in\nsmokers, and reduced colon adenoma recurrence.19 Some\nstudies with suggestive but statistically insignificant results also\nsupport a beneficial role for folate on adenocarcinoma of the\na Division of Nutrition, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and\nHealth Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4770\nb Department of Preventive Medicine and Biostatistics.

Folate plays an important\nrole in the transfer of methyl and formyl groups to organic com-\npounds. Observations have suggested that deficient methylation\nof DNA may play a role in carcinogenesis. It is speculated that\nfolate's importance in the transfer of methyl groups may\naccount for its purported beneficial effects against cancer.13\nFolate's potential role in preventing coronary heart disease is\nlargely indirect by helping to determine homocysteine concentra-\ntions. After adjustment for plasma homocysteine concentrations,\nthe magnitude of the measures of association in two of these\nstudies was greatly reduced.46'\nTo examine whether serum folate concentrations affects\nfuture occurrences of mortality and chronic disease incidence,\nwe analysed data from a nationally representative cohort of US\nadults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey I (NHANES I) Epidemiologic Follow-up Study. Spe-\ncifically, we examined whether serum folate concentrations\nwere predictive of all-cause mortality, major circulatory disease\nmortality or incidence, and cancer mortality or incidence.\n \nyears at the baseline examination were subsequently followed\nup. The methods of the original NHANES I survey and the\nNHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study have been presented\nin detail elsewhere.58\"62 Cohort members were followed\nthrough 1992. Serum folate determinations were limited to the\n3059 participants in one of the nationally representative sub-\nsamples of NHANES I. Serum folate was measured with a micro-\nbiological method with a coefficient of variation of 10-20%.63\nFour waves of follow-up data collection were undertaken in\nparticipants was determined during each of these periods. Death\ncertificates were obtained for deceased participants. Deaths\nwere classified as being due to diseases of the circulatory system\nif the underlying code listed one of the International Classi-\nfication of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-\nmalignant neoplasm of skin). During the follow-up interviews,\nstudy participants or proxies for diseased participants or those\nincapable of participating in the interview were asked about\nhospitalizations. Subsequently, hospitals were contacted and\nhospital discharge sheets were abstracted.\nIncidence of diseases of the circulatory system was defined as\neither a death based on the underlying code or a hospitalization\n10 possible diagnoses. Incidence of cancer was defined as either\na death based on the underlying code or a hospitalization with\nof the 10 possible diagnoses. We excluded from the analyses for\ndiseases of the circulatory system participants who reported at\nbaseline that they had had a previous heart attack or stroke. We\nexcluded from the analyses for cancer participants who reported\nat baseline that they had had cancer.\nFor all-cause mortality and for circulatory disease, the poten-\ntial confounders we included in the analysis were age, sex, race,\neducation, cigarette smoking, systolic blood pressure, use of\nanti-hypertensive medication, serum cholesterol, body mass\nindex, recreational and non-recreational physical activity, self-\nreported diabetes, and alcohol consumption. For cancer, the\npotential confounders we included in the analysis were age,\nsex, race, education, cigarette smoking, physical activity and\nalcohol consumption. For cigarette smoking, we used a variable\nthat was constructed in part from responses obtained during the\nbaseline interview and in part from the first follow-up interview\ndemonstrated.64-65 Using the two questions 'Have you smoked\nat least 100 cigarettes during your entire life?' and 'Do you smoke\ncigarettes now?', three categories of smoking were constructed:\ncurrent smokers, former smokers, and never having smoked.\nBecause no dietary data were collected for our analytic sample,\nwe were unable to adjust for potential dietary confounders.\nWe adjusted mortality rates (all-cause and cause-specific) for\nage and sex by the direct method to the 1980 US residential\npopulation using three age groups. We performed proportional\nhazards regression analyses with the software SUDAAN which\naccounts for the complex sampling design of the study.66 Pro-\nportionality assumptions were checked with the SAS procedure\nProc PHREG by creating time-dependent covariates for the inde-\npendent variables. We also conducted lagged analyses whereby\nwe excluded individuals who died within periods of up to\n5 years from entry into the study.\nResults\nThe number of participants available for each analysis and the\nnumber of health events are shown in Table 1. Mean serum\nfolate concentrations for variables included in this analysis are\nshown in Table 2. Women had higher folate concentrations\nthan men, current smokers had lower folate concentrations\nthan former or never smokers, participants with a cholesterol\nconcentration <200 mg/dl had lower folate concentrations than\nTable 1 Algorithm for determining analytic sample size.

Because the associations between serum\nfolate concentrations and disease endpoints were similar for\nmen and women, we present only data for the combined group\nof study participants. We examined crude and age-adjusted\ncorrelation coefficients between serum folate and continuous\nvariables. The largest correlation (r = 0.15) was found between\nage and serum folate.\nAge- and sex-adjusted mean folate concentrations for those\nwho subsequently were diagnosed with or died from various\ncauses and those who did not are shown in Table 3. No sig-\nnificant mortality differences were observed. Participants who\nlater experienced incident circulatory disease had lower mean\nconcentrations of serum folate than did those who remained\nfree of circulatory disease. Age- and sex-adjusted mean serum\nfolate concentrations were 8.3 nmol/1 for 21 participants who\nfor 13 participants who died of colon cancer (ICD-9-CM 153),\nand 9.5 nmol/1 for 43 patients with a respiratory cancer (ICD-9-\nCM 162). Age-adjusted means of serum folate concentrations\nwere 7.9 nmol/1 for 11 women who died of breast cancer (ICD-\ndie of cancer and 9.5 nmol/1 for 15 men who died of prostate\ndid not die of cancer. None of the differences were statistically\nsignificant (P > 0.10).

Age-adjusted means of serum folate con-\ncentrations were 7.3 nmol/1 for 47 women with breast cancer\ncompared with 8.5 nmol/1 for women who did not have cancer\nand 7.7 nmol/1 for 42 men who died of prostate cancer (ICD-9-\ncancer. None of the differences were statistically significant\nMortality and incidence rates are presented in Table 4. The\nproportional hazards analyses which included only participants\nwith complete data failed to support any significant relationship\nbetween serum folate concentrations and any of the endpoints\n(Table 4). We also repeated the cancer mortality analyses by ex-\ncluding malignant neoplasms of lymphatic and haematopoietic\nfor all cancers.\nAlthough we failed to find a significant relationship between\nserum folate and all-cause mortality and circulatory disease,\nplots of the log relative hazard and serum folate concentration\nsuggested a J-shaped relationship between the risk of disease\nand serum folate concentration with the lowest risk occurring\naround serum folate concentrations of 18-23 nmol/1.

We found no interaction between age, sex, race, education,\nor smoking status and serum folate concentration for mortality\nfrom and incidence of the various health events. However, the\ninteraction term between serum folate, modelled as a continu-\nous variable, and diabetes status was a significant predictor of\nall-cause and circulatory disease mortality. For people without\ndisease mortality, respectively, and for those with diabetes, they\nrespectively.\nDiscussion\nIn this nationally representative sample that was followed for\nabout 14 years, low serum folate (<9.3 nmol/1) was associated\nwith small increases in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular\ndisease mortality but not cancer mortality. However, the size of\nthe hazard ratios was small and only for the post-hoc analysis for\nall-cause mortality did the 95% CI exclude unity. Because\nthe sample size for site-specific cancers was small, we were un-\nable to examine whether serum folate may have had a pro-\ntective effect on the incidence of those cancers for which\nprevious research supports a possible relationship.\nSeveral limitations may affect the findings of our study. It is\npossible that our findings may be due to some other unmeas-\nured confounding factor among those with low serum folate\nconcentrations. In addition, folate may be protective for par-\nticular conditions that form only a small part of total mortality\nor the broad groupings of disease we used in this analysis. Thus\nthe effect of folate may have been diluted by broad disease\ngroupings. Measuring serum folate concentrations may not be\nthe best indicator of folate status in individuals. Body stores of\nfolate can be measured in several ways: serum or plasma folate\nconcentrations represent shorter term, whereas red blood cell\nfolate represents intermediate stores. Liver biopsies are perhaps\nthe best measurement of body stores of folate. Potischman\nconcluded that the concentration of red blood cell folate was a\nbetter predictor of cervical dysplasia than were either serum\nfolate concentration or dietary intake.67\nWe estimate that we had power of ^80% to detect hazard\nratios on the order of 1.7 comparing the lowest with the highest\nquintile of serum folate for all-cause mortality, coronary\nheart disease mortality and incidence, and all cancer incidence.\nHowever, it was impossible for us to conduct analyses with suf-\nficient power for particular categories of cancer. Because some\nmisclassiDcation of exposure is likely, due both to true within\nperson variability and to laboratory assessment variability,\nactual power may have been lower. Given our findings, we also\nperformed post hoc confidence limit analyses that showed like-\nlihood estimates of less than 5% for finding true hazard ratios\nRecently, a study of elderly Italians suggested that dietary in-\ntake of folate determined from a 24-hour recall was an inde-\npendent predictor of mortality over a 6-year period.1 Several\nstudies have suggested that plasma folate concentrations are\nassociated with coronary artery disease and carotid artery\nstenosis after adjustment for traditional risk factors. 16'46~48\nHowever, additional adjustment for homocysteine concentra-\ntions usually results in substantial attenuation of these associ-\nations. These observations are perhaps not surprising, since\nfolate determines homocysteine concentrations in part. In our\nstudy, we noted a non-significant 41% increase in mortality\nfrom circulatory diseases for participants in the lowest quintile\nof serum folate concentration.\nIn conclusion, we found low serum folate to be weakly\nassociated with an increased risk for mortality from all causes\nand diseases of the circulatory system but not cancer. Additional\nresearch to better define the specificity of the protective health\neffect of folate is dearly needed. Nevertheless, foods rich in\nfolate such as dark green vegetables, orange juice, and whole\ngrains, have been found to be assodated with reduced risk of\ncancer and coronary heart disease and should, therefore, be part\nof everyone's diet.\nReferences\n1 Magni E, Bianchem A, Rozzini R, Trabucchi M.
