Theory suggests that the foreign expansion of\nmultinational enterprises (MNEs) may lead to a downward pressure on real wages for\nrelatively scarce types of labor in the home country. However, besides cost reductions,\nan important motive for outward foreign direct investment (FDI) is market expan-\nsion. In fact, a major part of MNEs' foreign operations is concentrated in high- rather\nthan low-income countries. In 2000, 63 percent of the foreign labor force of German\nMNEs worked in industrialized countries. Similarly, in 2002, 77 percent of the foreign\nlabor force of Swedish MNEs worked in industrialized countries (ITPS 2004). The\nco-existence of both market-seeking and cost-reducing forces makes theoretical pre-\ndictions about the effect of outward FDI on real wages ambiguous. Moreover, even\nwhen considering exclusively cost-reducing FDI, the theoretical prediction about the\neffect on parent employment is ambiguous. The effect depends on whether the cost\nreduction allows the MNE to expand its market share, and whether the parent retains\nactivities at home that are complementary to foreign operations.\nTo what extent FDI may lead to reduced labor demand at home and downward\npressure on home country wages is therefore inherently an empirical issue. We use\ndata on German and Swedish MNEs at the parent and affiliate level to assess the\nFDI effects. We ask: (i) What factors determine where MNEs choose to operate their\nforeign affiliates? (ii) How is the firm's employment in different locations affected by\nwages in those locations?\nOur German data combine information on domestic firms' balance sheets (Un-\nternehmensbilanzstatistik, ustan) with information on German firms' foreign affili-\nate holdings (Direktinvestitionenstatistik, direk). Both sets of data are collected by\nDeutsche Bundesbank Frankfurt and matched in this paper for the first time. The\nGerman data on outward FDI cover the foreign affiliates of German MNEs (above a\ncertain size threshold and with a ten-percent ownership share). We restrict our at-\ntention to majority-owned affiliates of German MNEs to make the data comparable\nacross countries. The Swedish data (collected by the Research Institute of Industrial\nEconomics IUI Stockholm) cover around 75 percent of all Swedish manufacturing\ncompanies above a certain size threshold with at least one majority-owned foreign\naffiliate in manufacturing. To construct comparable data for the two countries, we\nchoose the year 2000 for Germany, the first year for which we have a full match of do-\nmestic parents and foreign affiliates, and the year 1998 for Sweden, the last currently\navailable year of Swedish MNE data.\nWe run regressions of location choice with a large set of parent-level controls and\nlocation-specific variables. We also estimate multi-location translog cost functions\nfrom which we can infer the degree of substitutability between parent and affiliate\nemployment. Our results show that German MNEs are attracted to host countries\nwith relatively abundant supplies of skilled labor. This confirms recent findings for a\nsample of German MNEs with affiliates in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) (Marin\n2004). However, we find no such evidence for Swedish MNEs, suggesting that this\ntendency may indeed be particular to Germany.\nMulti-location cost function estimates show that affiliate employment tends to\nsubstitute for employment at the parent firm both at German and Swedish MNEs.\nAt the margin, this substitutability between parent and affiliate employment is most\npronounced for affiliates in other Western European countries. However, we also find\nsubstitutability between parent employment and affiliate employment in Central and\nEastern Europe (CEE). Because of the larger wage differential between Germany\nand Sweden on the one hand and CEE on the other hand, than between different\nWestern European countries, this may be the economically more important effect. An\nevaluation of our multi-location cost function estimates at the sample mean shows\nthat a one percent larger wage gap between Germany and locations in CEE may\ndestroy around 900 jobs in German parents and create around 5,0000 in affiliates\nlocated in CEE. A similar evaluation for Sweden shows that a one percent larger\nwage gap between Sweden and CEE may destroy 140 jobs in Swedish parents and\ncreate around 260 jobs in affiliates located in CEE.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We document overall employ-\nment trends for MNEs operating in Sweden and Germany in section 2 and discuss\nthe related literature. Section 3 presents our econometric frameworks, and section 4\ndescribes the data on MNEs used. We present the empirical analysis of location\nchoice in section 5 and the analysis of employment responses to wages across differ-\nent locations in section 6. Section 7 concludes.\n2 German and Swedish FDI and Related Litera-\nture\nIn 2001, German MNEs employed about 2.5 million workers abroad, and Swedish\nMNEs around one million workers (see figures 1 and 2). Whereas employment at Ger-\nman parents roughly matches in size the employment at foreign affiliates, employment\nat Swedish parents is only about half of their employment at foreign affiliates.\nAffiliate employment of German and Swedish MNEs roughly doubled over the\ncourse of the 1990s. In Germany, employment at the parent firms increased over this\nperiod as well. At face value, these facts do not provide evidence in support of the\nwidely held opinion that German MNEs have shifted employment to foreign locations.\nIn contrast, Swedish parent employment fell during the same period--lending more\nsupport to the notion that MNEs contribute to a relocation of jobs abroad. Our\nanalysis will show, however, that when we study employment patterns at the level of\nfirms, employment responses to wage differentials between home and host countries\nare very similar for Swedish and German MNEs.\nEmployment (Millions)\nCalendar year\nforeign affiliates of German MNEs German parents\nforeign-owned firms in Germany\nSource: Own calculations (foreign employment at majority-owned affiliates only). Data: direk\nand ustan Deutsche Bundesbank, all sectors.\nFigure 1: Employment at German MNEs\nRecently, outward FDI from Germany and Sweden to CEE has surged. Both\ncountries are close to recent accession countries to the European Union (EU); Ger-\nmany to the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary; Sweden to the Baltic states and\nPoland. Firms in both Germany and Sweden may realize potentially large labor\ncost reductions by relocating activities to CEE. The focus of this paper on manu-\nfacturing activities notwithstanding, a large share of recent outward FDI from both\nGermany and Sweden has taken place in the service sector. At both German and\nSwedish MNEs, roughly 40 percent of their foreign employees work in service indus-\ntries (Becker, Ekholm, J\u00a8\nGermany has long been an important host country of foreign MNEs, whereas Swe-\nden received little inward FDI until the mid 1990s. Figures 1 and 2 show, however,\nthat Germany's and Sweden's recent experiences tend to partly reverse this pat-\ntern. Employment of foreign-owned firms in Germany has fallen while employment\nof foreign-owned firms in Sweden has risen. Both countries have a long history as\nhome countries of globally successful MNEs (including corporations such as Siemens,\nVolkswagen, Electrolux, Ericsson, and Volvo). The work force of Swedish manufac-\nturing MNEs is, however, more international than that of German manufacturing\nMNEs. Table 1 shows that the foreign share of the Swedish manufacturing MNEs'\nwork force was 59.4 percent in 1998, while the corresponding share for German man-\nufacturing MNEs in 2000 was 39.4 percent. A likely explanation for this difference\nis that the larger size of the German market makes Germany a relatively more at-\ntractive production base for domestic as well as foreign firms compared to Sweden,\nEmployment (Millions)\nyear\nforeign affiliates of Swedish MNEs Swedish parents\nforeign-owned firms in Sweden\nSource: Own calculations. Data: ITPS (2004), all sectors.\nFigure 2: Employment at Swedish MNEs\nwhich has a very small domestic market.\nPrior research into the effect of FDI on home-country labor markets mostly focuses\non the effect of locating low-skill-intensive production abroad. Feenstra and Hanson\n(1999) find that foreign outsourcing of U.S. firms to affiliates or unrelated firms\nabroad contributed substantially to the observed increase in the wage premium for\nskilled labor in the U.S. Slaughter (2000) studies the same issue focusing exclusively\non FDI. He does not find that shifts of production activities from U.S. parents to\nforeign affiliates has a significant wage impact. This finding has been interpreted as\nevidence that the effects found by Feenstra and Hanson's (1999) is mainly related to\nTable 1: Home and Foreign Employment at Manufacturing MNEs\naGermany for German MNEs, Sweden for Swedish MNEs.\ntrade at arm's length, sub-contracting or licensing. Head and Ries (2002) estimate\nthe impact of a foreign expansion of Japanese MNEs on the skill-intensity of the\nwork force at Japanese parents and find that foreign expansions lead to an increased\nskill-intensity and higher wages at the parent firm, and that this effect is stronger\nwhen firms expand into low-wage countries.\nFor Sweden and Germany, some studies report evidence that MNEs tend to lo-\ncate relatively high-skill intensive rather than low-skill intensive activities abroad.\nEvidence of skill seeking among Swedish MNEs is presented by Blomstr\u00a8\nom, Fors and\nLipsey (1997). However, Hansson (2001) disputes their result and finds in a study sim-\nilar to Slaughter (2000) that shifts of production activities within Swedish MNEs to\nnon-OECD countries have a negative effect on the relative wage of unskilled Swedish\nworkers. Marin (2004) presents recent evidence of skill seeking among German MNEs.\nShe uses detailed data on German (and Austrian) MNEs and their activities in CEE\nand finds that the foreign affiliates tend to employ workers with higher educational\nattainment and offer more R&D related occupations than the German (and Austrian)\nparents.\nFor an assessment of the effects of outward FDI on the home economy it is in-\nstructive to know what factors attract FDI to foreign locations in the first place.\nA few studies analyze how host country factors affect the location choice of MNEs.\nHead and Mayer (2002) examine whether market potential is an important factor\nfor the location choice of Japanese MNEs. Based on the same affiliate-level data\nas we use, Buch, Kleinert, Lipponer and Toubal (2004) study the location choice of\nGerman MNEs and argue that, on average, market access is a stronger motive than\ncost reduction for firms to conduct FDI. We extend their work by augmenting the\naffiliate-level data for Germany and Sweden with a large set of parent-level variables.\nWe control for both relative endowments of skilled labor and labor cost differentials\nbetween the home and host country, and find that German MNEs tend to seek skill\nabundant foreign locations while, conditional on skill endowments, high labor costs\ndeter FDI.\nWe complement the evidence on location choice with an investigation into whether\nparent and affiliate employment tend to substitute or complement each other. Slaugh-\nter (1995) proposes the estimation of multi-location translog cost functions in order\nto test whether employment at foreign affiliates tends to substitute for or be a com-\nplement to employment at domestic parent firms. Brainard and Riker (2001) and\nKonings and Murphy (2001) apply the translog framework to U.S. and European\ncorporations, respectively. Brainard and Riker (2001) find that foreign affiliate em-\nployment substitutes modestly for U.S. parent employment. However, substitutability\nis stronger between workers employed in different low-wage locations than between\nparents and affiliates. Konings and Murphy (2001) find weaker substitutability be-\ntween parent employment and affiliate employment in CEE than between parent\nemployment and affiliate employment in the EU-15. We follow this literature and\nestimate translog cost functions for German and Swedish MNEs, distinguishing be-\ntween high-income and low-income foreign locations.1\n3 Empirical Models\nAn MNE's location choice and its subsequent employment decision could be viewed\nas a two-stage process. The MNE first chooses the location of its fixed assets--taking\ninto account expected wage levels across regions and market prospects. Then, the\nMNE employs foreign workers to operate the fixed assets across locations, taking\ninto account the prevailing wage levels in those locations and realized demand for the\nfirm's output. We follow the existing literature closely and analyze the determinants\nof these decisions in two separate empirical models: A logit location choice model to\ncapture investment in fixed assets, and an independent multi-location cost function\nmodel that considers the location choice as given.\nIn modeling location choice, we start from individual FDI decisions. MNEs can\nlocate in up to J countries. We follow the prior literature in that we treat location\nchoices as independent of one another, using a multinomial choice model for the\nanalysis. This setup rests on the implicit assumption that an MNE management\nboard delegates the location choice to I members, who individually select a location\nfor investment out of the J alternatives. While this assumption is unlikely to be\nstrictly accurate, the setup has advantages over a simpler binomial choice model that\nwould not allow for an analysis of host country effects on location choice. From\nseveral alternative multinomial logit models, we select the conditional logit (CL)\nframework. We adopt the CL framework after testing, in a more general nested logit\nmodel, whether we can reduce the number of parent-location interactions. We do not\nfind estimates to be significantly different when reducing the number of interactions\nfrom seven to three groups of locations. A subsequent test whether the nested logit\nmodel should be adopted in lieu of the more parsimonious conditional logit model\nfails to reject homoskedasticity (a likelihood ratio test), suggesting that the CL model\nis appropriate.\n3.1 Multinomial location choice\nThe benefit to a firm (or rather decision maker) i (i = 1, . . . , I) of investing in country\nj (j = 1, . . . , J) can be described with the latent variable\nU\nij\n= Vij\n+ ij\n1Related evidence is presented by Braconier and Ekholm (2000) and Marin (2004), who estimate\nwage elasticities without using translog cost functions. Castellani and Navaretti (2004) also study\nthe effect of FDI on parent employment. Using propensity score matching techniques for Italian\nmanufacturers, they find that a foreign expansion has no significant effect on employment.\nwhere Vij\nis the deterministic part and ij\nis the stochastic part. Vij\ncan, in general,\nbe written as\nVij\n= xir\n + zj\nwhere zj\ndenotes a vector of location-specific variables and xir\nstands for a vector of\nfirm characteristics, interacted with country group indicators r (r = 1, . . . , R), that\nmay influence the relative attractiveness of the alternatives.\nThe decision maker in multinomial choice models selects one out of J mutually ex-\nclusive alternatives, picking the option that provides the highest benefit. The econo-\nmetrician only observes the outcome. The probability of observing firm i choosing\nalternative j is\nPij\n= P(yi\n= j) = P(U\nij\n> U\nim\n m = 1, . . . , J : m = j)\n= P( im\n- ij\n Vij\n- Vim\n m = 1, . . . , J : m = j). (3)\nGiven the deterministic parts Vi1\n, . . . , ViJ\n, the probability Pij\nto observe out-\ncome j for decision maker i depends on the distribution of the stochastic error term\n, . . . , iJ\n.\nThe CL framework suggests an interpretation of estimation results along the fol-\nlowing lines.\n1. For country-specific variables zj\n, the odds ratio (i.e. the relative probability\nratio) of choosing a host country m relative to not choosing the location is:\nm|m =m\n(xir\n, zj\n) =\nP(yi\n= m|xir\n, zj\n)\n= m|xir\n, zj\n)\nBased on m|\u00b7=m\n, we generate relative risk ratios (RRR) as ratios of the calcu-\nlated odds ratios, where the variable of interest is increased by  in the numer-\nator. Using, for example, the location-specific variable GDPm\n, RRR becomes:\nm|m =m\n+ , xir\n, zj\n)\nm|m =m\n, xir\n, zj\n)\n= exp(^\nGDP\nFor an increase of  in GDPm\n, the relative probability of investing in country\nm versus not investing in country m changes by a factor of exp(^\nGDP\n\u00b7 ),\nholding everything else constant. For logarithmic variables one can state more\nexplicitly that an increase in GDPm\nby one percent (i.e. log(GDPm\nlog(GDP) + .01) changes the relative probability of investing in country m\nversus not choosing this location by a factor of exp(^\nGDP\n2. The RRR with respect to the (interacted) parent-specific variables, xir\n, needs\nto be calculated relative to a reference region B. Applied to domestic sectoral\nwages wiC\n(domestic wages interacted with country group indicator C), for\ninstance, the RRR becomes:\nc|b\n(wi\n+ , xir\n, zj\n)\nc|b\n(wi\n, xir\n, zj\n)\n= exp(^\nwiC\nwhere ^\nwiC\nis the estimated parameter of domestic sectoral wages (wiC\n) for\ncountry group C, and b and c refer to any country belonging to region B and\nC, respectively. A natural interpretation of equation (6) therefore implies, that\nan increase in sectoral wages by  changes the odds of choosing a location in\nregion C compared to investing in one of the countries belonging to region B\nby the factor exp(^\nwiC\n3.2 Employment responses to wages\nGiven their long-term location choice across countries, we consider MNEs to be price\ntakers in the labor markets of their domestic and foreign affiliates. A short-run\ntranslog cost function, in which installed capital is considered a quasi-fixed factor,\nenables us to assess how outward FDI affects home employment. We treat labor\nemployed in a location r as a distinct factor and output produced at that location as\na distinct output. So, a firm i produces R region-specific outputs Qir\n(r = 1, . . . , R).\nConsidering labor as immobile across multinational locations, the parent i employs\nR different types of labor Lir\n(r = 1, . . . , R) across locations given its quasi-fixed\ncapital stocks Kir\n.\nUnder a common short-run translog cost function,3 firm i's cost share of labor in\nlocation r is then given by\nir\n= r\n+\nR\nArm\nln wim\n(r = 1, . . . , R) (7)\n+\nR\nrm\nln Qim\n+\nR\nrm\nln Kim\n+ ir\n,\nwhere ir\n wir\nLir\n/( R\nwim\nLim\n) and ir\nis a normally distributed error term with\nmean zero.\nThe signs of the Arm\ncoefficients do not immediately indicate whether labor em-\nployed in one location is a substitute for or a complement to labor employed at\n2Again, using logs translates the statement into: An increase of local wages by one percent\n(i.e. a wage increase by .01) increases the odds of investing in C, compared to B, by the factor\nexp(^\nwiC\n3Burgess (1974) extends Christensen, Jorgenson and Lau's (1973) single-product translog cost\nfunction to a long-run multiproduct translog cost function.

However, we can infer Hicksian factor price elasticities rm\nof labor\ndemand responses at location r to wages at location m from coefficient estimates in\n(7) and mean cost shares.

All\nforeign affiliates fulfilling either of the following criteria are reported: (i) the parent\ncontrols at least 10 percent of equity and the balance sheet total is at least 5 million\nEUR; (ii) the parent controls at least 50 percent of equity and the balance sheet is at\nleast .5 million EUR. We relegate further details on these FDI data to appendix A.\nTo obtain comparable data to Sweden, however, we only use information on majority-\nowned affiliates in the present paper. We match these FDI data with information on\nthe German parent's domestic operations from BuBa's ustan data through string\nmatches based on company names and addresses. ustan is a balance-sheet data set\nthat includes employment information. Appendix B describes the data and our string\nmatching procedure in more detail.\nThe data for Sweden are part of a firm-level database on Swedish manufacturing\nfirms with foreign production affiliates. These data derive from a comprehensive sur-\nvey by the Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IUI) in Stockholm. The survey\nhas been repeated about every fourth year since 1970. The most recent available sur-\nvey covers the year 1998 (for a description of the data from this survey, see Ekholm\nand Hesselman 2000). The survey samples all manufacturing firms headquartered\nin Sweden, with at least 50 employees (world-wide) and at least one foreign affiliate\nwith some manufacturing activity.\nThere are some inherent differences between the two datasets. The German\ndataset is much larger than the Swedish one. In the cross-section analyses we carry\n4In our tests whether labor at location r is a substitute (rm\n> 0) or complement (rm\nlabor at location m, we use the symmetric confidence interval around the estimate ^\nrm\n: ^\nrm\n\u00b1Z(\u00b7) as\nproposed by Anderson and Thursby (1986) along with confidence intervals based on a bootstrapping\nprocedure.\nout in this paper, we can use information on 463 German parents while we can only\nuse information on 94 Swedish parents. The Swedish dataset, on the other hand,\ncontains some information which is unavailable for the German firms. In the Swedish\ndataset, total labor costs and employment are reported by the firms at both parent\nand affiliate level. Information about labor costs per employee can thus be obtained\nfrom the dataset. For German firms, we have information about employment of par-\nents and affiliates, but no information about wage bills. This implies that we have\nto use information about wages from other sources when dealing with the German\nfirms.\n5 Location Choice\nWe estimate location choice with a conditional logit (CL) model (section 3.1), using\nas dependent variable the presence of affiliate activity by country. We carry out the\nanalysis for one year: 2000 in the case of Germany and 1998 in the case of Sweden.\nThe dependent variable, the presence indicator per country, takes a value of one if\nthere is at least one majority-owned foreign manufacturing affiliate in the country.\nWe use parent-specific variables xir\n, interacted with location characteristics, and\nlocation-specific variables zj\nas regressors. Parent-specific variables include employ-\nment, (non-financial) fixed assets per employee (capital-labor ratios), profits over\nequity, and the wage in the parent's home sector (for Germany) or the parent's av-\nerage wage per employee (for Sweden). Following Buch et al. (2004) we also include\na count of the number of countries in which an MNE operates to partly control for\npotential unobserved parent-level effects.\nThe parent-specific variables are interacted with indicators of three broad country\ngroup indicators. These regional groupings are the following: Central and Eastern Eu-\nropean countries (CE), industrialized countries (IN ) and developing countries (DV )\n(see table 8 for definitions).5 We choose industrialized countries as our reference\ngroup.\nOur location-specific variables are intended to capture four different aspects of\nthe host country: its market size, its relative supply of skilled labor, its labor cost\nlevel, and costs associated with trading and investing in the country. Market size\nis an important determinant for the market-seeking motive behind horizontal FDI.\nTheoretically, the effect of relative skill supplies is ambiguous (see e.g. Carr, Markusen\nand Maskus 2001). Theory predicts that a large difference in relative skill endowments\nbetween the home and host country promotes vertical FDI, while a small difference\n5We adopt the CL model after estimating a seven-region nested logit model (not reported)\nand testing whether further restrictions significantly alter estimates. We are unable to reject that\nparameter estimates for seven regions differ significantly from those for three more aggregate regions\n(p-value of .16), and are unable to reject that nesting the remaining three foreign regions (IN, CE\nand DV ) into industrialized (IN ) and non-industrialized countries (CE and DV ) changes parameter\nestimates.\nin skill endowments favors horizontal FDI. Moreover, the effects of skill endowments\ndepend on the size of the market in the host country, since vertical FDI is most\nattractive when the host country has a large market at the same time as it is relatively\nabundant in unskilled labor (has cheap labor). Horizontal FDI, on the other hand,\nis most attractive when the home and host countries are similar both in terms of\nrelative skill endowments and market size. These insights call for the inclusion of\ninteraction terms between skill endowments and market size in a regression.\nRelative labor and other factor costs may interact with location choice through an\nadditional channel. One reason for cost differentials of factor inputs is that agglom-\neration forces may push up the price of immobile factors in agglomerated regions.\nThis may create incentive for vertical FDI to low-cost locations unrelated to the rel-\native endowments of unskilled labor in the host country (Ekholm and Forslid 2001).\nHowever, it may equally well be the case that MNEs are attracted by the location\nadvantages that give rise to agglomeration in the first place.\nAccording to theory, the effect of trade costs is ambiguous as well. High trade\ncosts promote horizontal FDI since they make exports from the home country costly,\nwhile low trade costs promote vertical FDI since they make exports from the host\ncountry back to the home country inexpensive.\nWe proxy market size with a country's GDP, and trade and investment costs with\ngeographical distance between the capital cities of the host and home countries.6\nWe use a country's share of population with completed higher education to measure\nrelative skill endowments (taken from Barro and Lee (2001) data). The level of labor\ncosts is approximated by the wage cost for skilled blue-collar workers.7 The choice\nof this particular type of labor has been motivated by the desire to find a group that\nmight be considered reasonably homogenous and one that is likely to be important\nfor all firms in the sample.\nGDP per capita is included as an additional location-specific variable. This vari-\nable may partly capture the host country's relative abundance of physical and human\ncapital, partly its level of technology and infrastructure, and partly income effects\non consumer demand. Because of the so-called Balassa-Samuelson effect, it may also\ncapture the host country's relative cost level and thereby be an alternative proxy for\nthe wage level. Furthermore, GDP per capita correlates with the quality of economic\nand political institutions--such as property rights protection, checks on corruption\nand political stability. The measures of GDP and GDP per capita for are obtained\nfrom the IMF's International Financial Statistics series.\n6Geographical distance is measured as the greater circle distance from Berlin and Stockholm,\nrespectively.\n7This measure has been obtained by using information on occupational wages from the Occupa-\ntional Wages around the World (OWW) database (Freeman and Oostendorp 2001). See appendix C\nfor a more detailed description of the calculations.\n5.1 Location of Foreign Affiliates of German MNEs\nTable 2 presents conditional logit estimates for Germany. Investments made by the\nsame MNE in different countries should probably not be treated as mutually inde-\npendent decisions. We therefore control for potential correlations in the error terms\nby allowing for clustering over parent observations.8 In table 2 we have defined skill-\nscarce (skill-abundant) countries as countries with a lower (higher) share of high\nschool attainment than Germany (the share of higher school attainment in Germany\nis 17.5 percent). To increase the number of observations, we remove median foreign\nwages from specifications (2) and (4).\nTo assess the effect of relative skill endowments, we interact endowments with\nan indicator of whether the country is skill abundant or skill scarce compared to\nGermany. As discussed previously, theory predicts that differences in relative skill\nendowments promote vertical FDI, while similarity in relative skill endowments pro-\nmotes horizontal FDI. If FDI were mainly vertical, we would expect a negative effect\nof skill endowments for both groups. If it were mainly horizontal, we would expect a\npositive effect of skill endowments for the skill scarce group and a negative effect of\nskill endowments for the skill abundant group. Since theory suggests that the effect\nvaries depending on the size of the country, we also augment the specifications with\nfurther interactions between relative skill endowments and GDP for the two groups\nof skill scarce and skill abundant countries.\nHost-country regressors are highly significant across specifications, the only ex-\nception being GDP per capita in some specifications. In particular, GDP levels and\ngeographical distance serve as strong predictors of FDI (at the one-percent confi-\ndence level), reflecting the importance of standard gravity variables for explaining\n2000). Larger GDP (market size) attracts FDI, while geographical distance deters\nFDI. In specification (1), for example, a one percent increase in a country's GDP,\nceteris paribus, raises the relative probability of choosing it as a location versus not\ninvesting in this country by about half a percent in a skill scarce country and about .8\n8We have also used specifications including region-specific constants. However, the inclusion of\nthese constants did not alter the results in any important way, which is why we do not report them\nin the paper.\nTable 2: Conditional Logit Estimates of German FDI Presence in 2000\nParent interactions with Central and Eastern European (CE) countries\nParent interactions with developing (DV) countries\nobs. in col. 2 and 4). Standard errors in parentheses:  significance at ten,  five,  one percent.\npercent in a skill abundant country.9 An increase in a country's geographical distance\nby one percent, decreases the odds of locating in that country by about .6 percent\n(specification 1).\nThe estimated coefficient of relative skill endowments for skill scarce countries is\npositive and significantly different from zero at the one percent level in all specifica-\ntions. The estimate for skill abundant countries is also positive, but only significance\nin specifications (1) and (3). This finding suggests that German MNEs are skill trac-\ning, i.e. they seek skill-abundant locations in their selection of destinations. Skill\nseeking in the group of skill scarce countries is consistent with German FDI being\nmainly of the horizontal type. The evidence of skill seeking in the group of skill\nabundant countries is weaker. However, the fact that we find evidence of skill tracing\nin this group is interesting and may be interpreted in various ways. One possible in-\nterpretation is that German MNEs engage in a kind of inverted vertical FDI - instead\nof locating parts of the value added chain which are intensive in unskilled labor in\nlow-wage countries they locate parts intensive in skilled labor in high-wage countries.\nAnother interpretation is that the result is in fact consistent with German FDI being\nmainly of the horizontal type. It might be argued that formal education is a poor\nindicator of skill endowments in the case of Germany, since Germany has a more\ndeveloped system of apprenticeship than other countries. Taking this into account,\na large part of the group of countries defined as skill abundant vis-`\na-vis Germany\nmight be better thought of as skill scarce.\nAs for the interaction terms between skill endowment and country size (measured\nby GDP), all estimates are negative. They are all significant for the group of skill\nscarce countries, but only significant in specifications (1) and (3) for the group of skill\nabundant countries. Higher GDP levels thus seem to be associated with a smaller\nimpact of skill endowments. This finding is consistent with the predictions of the\nknowledge capital model (see Markusen 2002) and the idea that large skill scarce\ncountries might be as attractive as small skill abundant ones. Applying the point\nestimates from specification (1) to numbers for Hungary and India; two examples of\n9The relative risk ratio with respect to the coefficient estimate on (log) GDP must account for\nall interaction terms. The RRR is (see section 3):\n+ ^\n+ ^\n)],\nwhere zm,3\ndenotes the variable skill-scarce location and zm,4\nstands for skill-abundant country, and\nthe estimated coefficients 1\nrefer to the variables GDPm\nand the interactions between\nskill endowment and log GDPm\n. Looking at a skill-scarce country (zm,4\n= 0) with a high school\nattainment rate of 15 percent (zm,3\n= 15), for instance, our results for specification (1) indicate\nthat a one percent increase in GDPm\nincreases the odds of choosing location m versus not choosing\nGDP in country m increases by one percent, the relative probability of choosing that country versus\nnot choosing it as a location increases by approximately .5 percent. Considering a skill-abundant\ncountry (zm,3\n= 0) with 20 percent higher school attainment (zm,4\n= 20), on the other hand, results\nrelatively skill-scare countries with small and large market sizes, respectively; we find\nthat a unit increase in the skill level (i.e. an increase in the higher school attainment\nby one percentage point) in Hungary (India) raises the relative risk ratio of locating\nproduction there by about 15 (7) percent. The same increase in the skill level would\nthus have a stronger impact on the relative risk ratio of locating production there for\nsmall Hungary than for large India.\nAs explained above, we have also included the median wage level of skilled blue-\ncollar workers to capture the effects of labor costs on the relative attractiveness of\na location (specifications 1 and 3). Conditioning on the availability of labor skills\nin the country, an increase in a country's median wage of skilled blue-collar workers\nby one percent reduces the odds that a German MNE chooses it as a location for\nmanufacturing activities by approximately .3 percent. Thus, while there is evidence\nof skill tracing conditional on wage levels, higher labor costs still deter German firms\nfrom investing in a country.\nIn the specifications excluding labor costs, we have many more observations at\nhand (specifications 2 and 4). In these specifications, the coefficient estimates for\nGDP per capita become negative and significant. This result may reflect the fact that\nGDP per capita tends to be highly correlated with wages and therefore may capture\nthe negative effect of wages found in specifications (1) and (3). Taken together, the\nresults for median wages of skilled blue-collar workers and GDP per capita suggest\nthat high wage and cost levels deter German MNEs, controlling for the availability\nof skilled labor.\nParent-specific variables need to be interpreted relative to our reference group\nof industrialized countries. We exclude German sectoral wages and capital-labor\nratios from specifications (1) and (2) but use a full set of parent-specific variables\nin specifications (3) and (4). A parent active in many locations is more likely to be\npresent in developing countries and less likely to have invested in CEE (CE) compared\nto the reference group. Note that the positive estimate for developing countries is\nlikely to merely reflect the fact that this is the country group with most countries.\nThis variable has been included only to serve as a control. Generally, the results for\nthe parent-specific variables should be viewed as descriptive. They all relate to choice\nvariables at the level of the firm and are therefore endogenously determined along\nwith location choice.\nThe parent employment coefficient with respect to CEE countries only becomes\nsignificant when German sectoral wages are excluded. A positive sign indicates that\nlarger firms are more likely to invest in CEE compared to industrialized countries.\nThe estimated coefficient in specification (1) implies that an increase in the odds of\nan MNE's presence in CEE (compared to its presence in industrialized countries) by\nhigher employment at the German parent. This correlation is consistent with the\nhypothesis that an MNE's presence in low-cost locations in CEE may increase its\ncompetitiveness vis-`\na-vis firms without such presence and therefore creates scope\nfor an expansion of its activities at home. However, it should be noted that this\ncorrelation is not robust across specifications. Moreover, it would also be consistent\nwith the hypothesis that large firms expand into CEE countries more frequently than\nsmall firms.\nEstimated coefficients of the profits per equity ratio are negative and significant\nin the CEE country group in specifications (1), (3) and (4). This suggests that\nparents with currently relatively low profits compared to domestic competitors are\nmore likely to have sought cost savings by locating manufacturing production in CEE.\nThe wage rate in the parent's sector in Germany, included in specifications 3 and 4,\ndoes not exhibit a conclusive correlation pattern with the choice of foreign locations.\nIts estimated coefficient is insignificant unless foreign wages are excluded from the\nregression.\n5.2 Location of Foreign Affiliates of Swedish MNEs\nTable 3 presents conditional logit estimates for Sweden. The variables included are\nsimilar to the ones in Table 2. A difference is that instead of sectoral wages in the\nhome country, we have included the average wage in the Swedish parent. Another\nimportant difference is that parent variables now refer to the entire Swedish part of\nthe corporation, not just the actual investing firm.\nIn general, fewer of the estimates based on the Swedish data set turn out signif-\nicant; a reflection of the fact that the Swedish data set is much smaller. The only\nlocation-specific variables that are significant across most specifications are the stan-\ndard gravity type variables; GDP and geographical distance. In specification (1), a\none percent increase in a country's GDP, ceteris paribus, raises the relative proba-\nbility of locating affiliate activity versus not locating affiliate activity in this country\nby about .4 percent in a skill scarce country and about .5 percent in a skill abundant\ncountry.10 An increase in a country's geographical distance by one percent decreases\nthe odds of operating an affiliate there by about 1 percent.\nThe estimated coefficients of the host country wage level have the same negative\nsign as in the German case, although here they are insignificant. The estimated\ncoefficients of relative skill abundance have the opposite sign compared to the German\ncase, although again the estimates are insignificant. Still, the latter result implies\nthat, unlike in the German case, there is no evidence of skill tracing by Swedish\nmultinationals.\nMost of the estimated coefficients of the parent-specific variables are insignificant\nas well. One apparent difference compared to the results for Germany, however,\nis that there is a positive estimate for the profit-equity ratio with respect to CEE\n10Here skill abundance has been defined in relation to Sweden, whose share of \"higher school\nattainment\" is 23.1 percent. Calculating the RRR for a skill abundant country yields exp[.01 \u00d7\nusing the median share of higher school attainment in the two groups of countries.\nTable 3: Conditional Logit Estimates of Swedish FDI Presence in 1998\nParent interactions with Central and Eastern European (CE) countries\nParent interactions with developing (DV) countries\nin 3; 11,152 in 4). Standard errors in parentheses:  significance at ten,  five,  one percent.\ncountries, while it is negative in the German case. It should be noted here, however,\nthat in the Swedish case the profit-equity ratio relates to the whole corporation\nrather than the Swedish parent. Thus, while we found that higher profitability at the\nGerman parent was associated with a decreased probability of being located in CEE\ncompared to other regions, here we find that higher profitability at the level of the\nentire Swedish corporation is associated with an increased probability of being located\nin CEE compared to other regions. However, whether higher corporate profitability\nis a cause or consequence of production in CEE remains to be investigated.\n6 Employment and Wages Across Locations\nTo assess employment effects of wages across locations, we estimate wage elasticities\nof labor demand across locations where the MNEs operate affiliate. The German\ndata provide no information on firm-level employment by skill groups or occupations.\nWe therefore only consider total employment at location r. We calculate the factor\nshare in the total wage bill of MNE i as i,r\n= wr\nLi,r\n/ R\nwr\nLi,r\n, where wr\nis the\nemployment-weighted regional average of the country-level wages and Li,r\nthe firm's\nemployment in region r.11 The Swedish data include the wage bills for both Swedish\nparents and foreign affiliates. We divide wage bills by total employment to calculate\ncountry-level wages and to infer wage shares by location.\nTo obtain interpretable results, we lump the host countries into four country\ngroups: Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), Developing countries (DEV ), Overseas\nIndustrialized countries (OIN ), and Western European countries (WEU ) (see table 8\nin the appendix for definitions). So, together with the home country, we consider\nlabor demand in five distinct regions. We estimate the resulting system of R - 1 = 4\nindependent labor share equations for the four foreign regions in iterated seemingly\nunrelated regressions. The iterations remove a potential sensitivity of estimates to\nour choice of four out of five equations, and seemingly unrelated regressions yield\nstandard errors that account for cross-equation correlations. We assume labor to be\nhomogenous within but not across regions. The four-equation system is\ni,r\n= r\n+\nR\nAr,m\nln wm\n+\nR\nr,m\nln Qi,m\n+\nR\nr,m\nln Ki,m\nThe definition of cost shares implies that R\ni,r\n= 1, so that the system can only\nbe identified for R - 1 independent equations.\n11Since individual firms in our samples of 451 German and 92 Swedish parents contribute little\nto overall affiliate employment in a region, we consider the potential endogeneity of employment\nshares in our weighting procedure as negligible.\nTable 4: Estimates of Factor Elasticities for Germany 2000\nWage change (by 1%) in\nSources: direk and ustan data. Stacked Observations based on OWW wages and firm-level\ncost shares. Standard errors in parentheses:  significance at ten,  five,  one percent. Upper\nentries in parentheses are standard errors from Anderson and Thursby (1986) confidence interval\nestimates (appendix D). Lower entries in parentheses are standard errors from 1,000 bootstraps.\nWe approximate the MNE's value added at a location with total affiliate turnover.\nPotential presence in up to four foreign regions implies that there are up to 15 regional\npresence patterns for an MNE (permutations of the absence from none, one, two, or\nthree regions). Rather than estimating separate equations for each location pattern,\nwe choose to restrict the coefficients to be equal across all groups of potential patterns\nof foreign presence. To do so, we stack the observations by setting all variables to zero\nfor an absent MNE and add according region indicators. The indicators take a value\nof one for all regions from which an MNE is absent to correct the intercept accordingly.\nThis procedure improves efficiency, collapses the up to 15 sets of estimates into one\nconsistently estimated four-equation system, and ultimately provides us with one\nsingle matrix of estimates for wage elasticities of regional labor demands.\nTables 9 and 10 in the appendix show the labor share estimates from the four-\nequation system, and table 11 presents the coefficient estimates of absence indicators\nfor both countries. When significant, the estimates of the absence indicators reveal\nthat absence is correlated with high regional wage bills (among the present MNEs).\nIn neither firm sample are there any MNEs with a simultaneous presence in all four\nTable 5: Estimates of Factor Elasticities for Sweden 1998\nWage change (by 1%) in\nSource: IUI data. Stacked Observations based on observed affiliate wages and firm-level cost\nshares. Standard errors in parentheses:  significance at ten,  five,  one percent. Upper entries\nin parentheses are standard errors from Anderson and Thursby (1986) confidence interval estimates\n(appendix D). Lower entries in parentheses are standard errors from 1,000 bootstraps.\nTables 4 and 5 present cross-wage elasticities of labor demand derived from the\nmulti-location cost function estimates (tables 9 and 10). The estimates show the\npercentage responses of regional employment to one-percent wage increases by region.\nThe upper standard errors reported in tables 4 and 5 are from Anderson and\nThursby (1986) confidence interval estimates (see appendix D), based on hypothesized\nGaussian errors. We also obtain standard errors from 1,000 bootstraps to remove\ndependence on distributional assumptions and report those as the lower entries in\ntables 4 and 5. We judge the significance of point estimates on the basis of the\nbootstrapped standard errors.\nConcavity of the cost function in wages requires that labor demand elasticities on\nthe diagonal be negative. Assuringly, tables 4 and 5 do exhibit negative elasticities\non the diagonal (except for one insignificant point estimate for affiliates of German\n12Outside manufacturing, there is a total of 63 omnipresent MNEs in Germany in 2000 (in direk\nand ustan).\nMNEs located in developing countries (DEV )). Elasticities off the diagonal can have\nmixed signs and provide an indication of factor substitutability (positive sign) and\nfactor complementarity (negative sign) across locations.\nElasticities of home-country employment with respect to foreign wages (first row)\nand elasticities of foreign employment with respect to home country wages (first col-\numn) are all positive in (tables 4 and 5). In both the German and Swedish sample,\nthe estimated cross-wage elasticities are significant at least at the ten percent level\nfor all regions except developing countries. In the larger German sample, several esti-\nmates are significant at the one-percent level. The positive and significant estimates\nsuggest that jobs at foreign locations substitute for employment at the German and\nSwedish parents. Parent employment seems to be the most sensitive to wages in\nWestern European host countries. At the sample mean, a one percent lower wage\nin Western European host countries is associated with .11 percent smaller employ-\nment in German parents. Similarly, a one percent lower wage in Western European\ncountries is associated with .23 percent smaller employment in Swedish parents.\nThe finding that affiliate employment in other high-income countries is the stron-\ngest substitute for parent employment is in line with results from previous studies\nSweden, home employment is most sensitive to wages in Western European host\ncountries. Whereas Konings and Murphy (2001) find no or only weak evidence of\nsubstitution between parent employment in EU-15 and affiliate employment in CEE,\nour results do suggest such a relationship. German MNEs that face a one percent\nhigher wage at home are estimated to increase their employment in CEE by 2.2\npercent. Swedish MNEs that face a one percent higher wage at home are estimated\nto increase their employment in CEE with 1.8 percent. A one percent wage reduction\nin host countries in CEE reduce German parent employment by about .05 percent\nand Swedish parent employment by about .09 percent.\nFor both German and Swedish MNEs, a one-percent larger wage gap between\nCEE and the home country results in significantly stronger employment effects in\nCEE than in the home country. The different magnitudes reflect labor productivity\ndifferences between the home country and CEE as captured by the estimated multi-\nlocation cost function. A substitution of parent jobs for affiliate jobs in CEE requires\na more than proportional number of hires of lower-productivity workers in CEE.\nMoreover, a one-percent change in German or Swedish wages implies a considerably\nlarger absolute change in wage levels and can therefore have a stronger effect on\naffiliate employment in CEE than a one-percent wage change in CEE has on parent\nemployment.\nMost of the cross-wage elasticities between different foreign locations are insignifi-\ncant. For German MNEs, there are a few instances of negative cross-wage elasticities\nsignificant at the 10 percent level: the elasticities of affiliate employment in develop-\ning countries with respect to wages in Western Europe and CEE, and the elasticity\nof affiliate employment in CEE with respect to wages in developing countries. These\nTable 6: Employment Effects of a One-Percent Increase in the Wage\nDifferential Relative to Foreign Locations\nGermany (wages)\nSweden (labor costs)\nestimates could be taken as evidence of complementarity between workers employed\nin different host countries. Since they all involve developing countries and Europe,\nthis suggests that the activities carried out by German MNEs in developing countries\nmight be vertically related to the operations at foreign affiliates in Europe.\nIn order to relate elasticities to absolute employment responses, we calculate the\nimplied change in employment from a one percent larger wage gap between regions.\nTo do so, we multiply the elasticities of labor demand with the respective total sample\nemployment figures from table 1.13 Focusing on CEE, we find that a one percent larger\nwage gap between Germany and locations in CEE reduces employment in German\nparents by 930 jobs and increases employment in CEE affiliates by 5,060 jobs. A\none percent larger gap between Sweden and locations in CEE reduces employment\nin Swedish parents by 140 jobs and increases employment in CEE affiliates by 260\njobs.\n7 Conclusion\nThe analysis of location choices and employment responses among German and\nSwedish MNEs reveals striking differences as well as similarities. For both firm\nsamples, the strongest predictors of location choice are host country GDP and geo-\ngraphical distance from the home country. This result underscores the importance of\nstandard gravity factors for the pattern of FDI. For both samples, the foreign wage\nlevel is negatively associated with the presence of foreign affiliates, controlling for the\ncountry's relative endowment of skilled labor. A noteworthy difference in location\nchoices between German and Swedish MNEs is that German MNEs tend to be at-\n13Formally, we calculate absolute employment responses to one-percent wage changes at the sam-\nple mean by multiplying the elasticities of labor demand with the respective sample average em-\nployments by region and the number of respective observations in the sample. The latter product\nequals total employment.\ntracted to countries with relatively abundant supplies of skilled labor, while there is\nno evidence of such skill tracing for Swedish MNEs. In this sense, our results lend\nsome support to recent findings that German firms locate relatively skill-intensive\nactivities abroad (Marin 2004). However, our German data lack explicit information\non the skill composition of labor forces and do not permit a more detailed analysis.\nGiven their respective location choices, German and Swedish firms exhibit sim-\nilar responses of labor demands to international wage differentials. For both home\ncountries, we find only positive estimates of the cross-wage elasticities. This implies\nthat jobs at parent firms and jobs at foreign affiliates tend to substitute for one an-\nother. For both sets of firms, we find that parent employment is most responsive\nto wages in other Western European countries. However, our results also indicate\nsignificant substitutability between parent workers and affiliate workers in Central\nand Eastern Europe. While parent employment is less responsive to a one-percent\nwage change in CEE than to a one-percent wage change in Western Europe, the\nemployment effects of the wage differentials between the home countries and CEE\nmay be economically the more important effects. The wage differential between the\nhome countries Germany and Sweden on the one hand and CEE on the other hand\nis considerably larger than the wage differential between these countries and other\nWestern European countries.\nThe estimated labor demand elasticities apply to marginal wage changes across\nlocations in which MNEs own manufacturing affiliates. An evaluation as to how large\nwage changes would affect employment in different locations is beyond the scope of\nthis paper. Such an assessment would require the treatment of endogenous location\nchoices in estimating the employment responses of MNEs.\nAppendix\nA The BuBa FDI data\nWe use FDI data for the years 1989 through 2001 at the firm level from BuBa's direk\n(Direktinvestitionenstatistik) database. Panels of both individual parents and affiliates are\nidentifiable during the sub period 1996 through 2001. Exchange rate information at the\nbalance sheet closing dates is available. We derive two data sets from the original data.\n1. Raw data. The raw fdi data are available as a three-dimensional panel, where ob-\nservations can be thought of as indexed by parent i, foreign affiliate u, and year t.\nEvery observation in the raw data corresponds to a single \"K3 questionnaire\" (K3\nmeaning reported outward FDI from Germany).\n2. Parent-host-country aggregates. Using the raw fdi data, we derive a three-dimensio-\nnal panel indexed by parent, host country of affiliate and year. Whenever a parent\ncarries out multiple investments in a particular country, we aggregate these invest-\nments into one observation. We interpret investments of the same parent firm in\ndifferent countries as independent location decisions conducted by independently op-\nerating parts of the firm (but restrict standard errors to by clustered by parent\ncompany). Every observation in this data set can be thought of as indexed by i, j, t\nwhere i denotes the German parent, j denotes the host country, and t the year.\nCurrency conversion and deflation. We convert all economic data of foreign affiliates\ninto euro (EUR) and deflate them. In BuBa's original direk data, all information on\nforeign affiliates is reported in German currency, using the exchange rate at the closing\ndate of the foreign affiliate's balance sheet. We apply the following deflation and currency\nconversion method to all financial variables. (i) We use the market exchange rate on the\nend-of-month day closest to an affiliate's balance sheet closing date to convert the DEM\nfigures into local currency for every affiliate. This reverses the conversion applied to the\nquestionnaires at the date of reporting. (ii) A deflation factor for every country deflates the\nforeign-currency financial figures to the December-1998 real value in local currency. (iii) For\neach country, the average of all end-of-month exchange rates vis-`\na-vis the DEM between\nJanuary 1996 and December 2001 is used as a proxy for the purchasing power parity of\nforeign consumption baskets relative to the DEM. All deflated local-currency figures are\nconverted back to DEM using this purchasing-power proxy. The resulting deutschmark\n(DEM) figures are then converted into euro figures at the rate 1.95583 (the conversion rate\nWe use the foreign countries' CPIs (Consumer Price Indices from the IMF's Interna-\ntional Financial Statistics) to deflate the figures. Whenever a country's CPI is not available\nfrom IFS but the main currency used in that country is issued in some other country, we\nuse the CPI of the currency-issuing country. The CPI deflation factors for all countries are\nB String matches and the BuBa USTAN data\nWe string-match companies in the BuBa ustan (Unternehmensbilanzstatistik) data set by\nname to companies in the Buba fdi data set in order to obtain information on the domestic\noperations of German MNEs. Every firm in Germany who draws a bill of exchange in a given\nyear is required by law to report its balance sheet to BuBa, who collects this information in\nits ustan database when the bill of exchange is rediscounted. The database is considered\nthe most comprehensive source of balance sheet data for companies outside the financial\nsector in Germany, and includes companies from the financial sector. The draft of bills of\nexchange remains a common form of payment in Germany. However, increases in BuBa's\nvalue threshold for reporting resulted in several drops of the sample and a marked decrease\nin the year 2001. For the year 2000, on which we base the current paper, we successfully\nstring match a total of 1,731 ustan firms to fdi firms. However, only 108 of those firms\nprovide consolidated balance sheet information.\nWe extract ustan information on the balance sheet total, equity (including retained\nprofits), profits, (non-financial) fixed assets, liabilities, the number of employees, and\nturnover. We use the German CPI (from the IMF's International Financial Statistics)\nto deflate the DEM (EUR) financial figures in the ustan data set. The CPI deflation fac-\ntor is rebased to unity at year-end 1998. Deflation to year-end 1998 values makes financial\nfigures comparable to the purchasing-power-parity inspired conversion method for our for-\nthe introduction of the euro in early 1999 makes December 1998 a natural reference date.\nFor robustness checks, we are interested in German MNEs who have only foreign but\nno domestic affiliates (`stand-alone' parents). For this purpose, we string-match companies\nin the BuBa fdi data set by name and location to companies in the firm register of the\nassociation of German credit agencies Verband der Vereine Creditreform, as available in\nits database markus. We use the information on ownership shares from markus to infer\nwhether and how domestic firms form part of corporate trees to which BuBa Outward fdi\nfirms belong. If no domestic affiliate is found for a BuBa Outward fdi firm, we label the\nfdi firm a `stand-alone' parent.\nC Occupational Wages\nWe use wage data from the Occupational Wages around the World (OWW) database\ncountries from 1983 to 1999 (the OWW data in turn are based on the ILO October Inquiry\ndatabase). The OWW wages refer to average monthly wage rates for male workers. We\nuse the 1999 data, multiply the monthly wages by twelve to approximate annual earnings\nfor our annualized translog estimation, and aggregate the 161 occupations into five broad\noccupation categories comparable to those in Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999).14 The\noccupational categories are: O1 engineers, professionals, and managers; O2 technicians\nand technical white-collar workers; O3 other white-collar workers; O4 skilled blue-collar\n14We follow Freeman and Oostendorp's (2001) recommendation and use their base calibration\nwith lexicographic weighting for the aggregate wages.\nworkers; and O5 unskilled blue-collar workers.
