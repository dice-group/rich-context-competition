In the\nUnited Kingdom, and many other countries, National\nStatistical Institutes (NSI) have proposed standardised meas-\nures to classify individuals into ethnic groups. This has often\nbeen driven by legal requirements associated with evaluating\nanti-discrimination policies, the need to monitor change in\nthe social and economic circumstances of ethnic minorities\nand the need to have accurate information about the size and\nnature of the ethnic minority population (Bulmer, 1985). The\nstandardised measures advocated by NSIs are frequently\nincluded within social surveys, but they are also common for\nalternative measures that are connected to the concept to be\nincluded (or constructed post-hoc). Indeed, researchers are\nsometimes interested in specific aspects of ethnicity that are\nnot well captured by NSI standards, and/or the design of a\nparticular survey may push researchers away from using NSI\nstandards for pragmatic reasons, such as very low coverage\nof some relevant minority groups.\nNandi and Platt (2012) describe two main perspectives in\nthe measurement of ethnicity.1 First, social surveys often\nplace individuals into mutually exclusive ethnic group cate-\ngories. These are sometimes based upon a taxonomy that can\nbe defined through objective characteristics (e.g. country of\nbirth or parental country of birth). Alternatively, they may\ninvolve asking respondents (or even interviewers or proxy\nrespondents) to allocate an appropriate category on substan-\ntially subjective grounds. In either case, to many analysts,\nthe specification of categorical ethnic group measures is a\nnecessity for studying ethnic inequalities using social survey\ndata (Platt, 2011: 74). Second, social survey data collections\nmay include multiple questions on different aspects of an\nindividual's ethnic identity and use an analytical approach\nthat draws upon data from more than one measure (see\nBurton et al., 2008).As a heuristic device, we will refer to the\nfirst perspective as the `mutually exclusive category'\napproach and the second perspective as the `multiple charac-\nteristics' approach.\nThe mutually exclusive category approach\nIn this approach, the aim is to place individuals into the most\nappropriate ethnic group category based on their characteris-\ntics (Burton et al., 2008). These characteristics may include\nskin colour or nationality (for example, Burton et al., 2008,\nStates), the most commonly used measures of ethnic group\ninvolve presenting individuals with a list of ethnic group cat-\negories which make reference to national origins and to skin\ncolour and asking them to indicate which category they feel\nis most appropriate for them.2\nIn the United Kingdom, the Office for National Statistics\n(ONS) recommends ethnic group measures for use in social\nsurveys (see Table 1 for the most recent measure, based on\nthe 2011 census). These recommendations are based on the\nmeasures designed for the United Kingdom decennial cen-\nsuses, which themselves have been constructed on the basis\nof wide consultations with a range of stakeholders and\nNational Institutes. The measures are different in the four\nUK territories, reflecting the nature of the minority ethnic\npopulation, different legal requirements and variations in the\nprominent terminology used (ONS, 2013). Clear guidelines\nare also produced for researchers who are analysing ethnicity\nacross the whole of the United Kingdom on recommended\nways to combine the different ethnic groups into higher level\nethnicity categories suitable for the UK-level analysis (see\nThe ONS recommended standard includes provision for\nvarious `mixed' categories, and it also allows individuals to\nclassify themselves as belonging to `other' unspecified eth-\nnic groups and to write in their chosen description (see\nTable 1). The use of this `write-in' section has been shown\nto improve perceptions of the acceptability of this question\nto respondents and to improve response rates (ONS, 2013).\nIn line with the aims of the `mutually exclusive category'\napproach, data collectors may seek to re-allocate those indi-\nviduals who have written-in their ethnic identity to one of\nthe existing ethnic group categories based on objective\nThe ONS standardised measures have been adopted in a\nnumber of large-scale social surveys (for a review, see\nAfkhami, 2012). The use of these existing standardised\nmeasures can facilitate the comparability of analyses across\nstudies. For many social science investigations using large-\nscale social survey data, the use of these measures within a\nmultivariate analysis, along with other key variables, will\nfulfil the requirement of providing increased control for the\nethnic group composition of the United Kingdom. The ONS\nstandard measures represent an extensively considered and\ntransparent approach (e.g. ONS, 2013), and although there\nmay sometimes be special circumstances that provide a com-\npelling reason for a specific study to depart from the ONS\nstandard categories, for theoretical or operational reasons,\nsuch departures should generally be discouraged without\ngood reason.\nA common complication in the United Kingdom survey\nresearch arises when analyses are conducted using non-\nstandard ethnic group categories. This sometimes happens\nbecause a standard format ethnicity measure is not available\nin the survey data. In the case of analysis using large-scale\nsurveys, it more commonly arises because the researcher has\ndecided to re-code the measure of ethnicity into a non-stand-\nard format. Often this decision is made because of small\nsample sizes in the different ethnic group categories.\nGenerally speaking, we would argue that researchers should\nresist the impulse to generate derived and variant measures\nwhen standardised taxonomies are available (see Lambert\net al., 2009). If standardised measures are not available in the\nsocial survey used, and/or there are operational reasons that\nConnelly et al. 3\npreclude the use of standard categories (e.g. an analytical\nfocus on an ethnic division that is not captured by the stand-\nard measure), researchers should provide clear justification\nfor, and documentation and metadata about, how the meas-\nures were derived, in order that other researchers can test the\nmeasures and adequately replicate results.3\nAn additional complexity arises when researchers seek\nto use ethnic group measures from surveys collected at dif-\nferent periods in time. In the case of comparisons across\ndifferent time points (e.g. using repeated cross-sectional\nsurveys), finding equivalent measures might be difficult. In\nthe United Kingdom, the standard measures used in large-\nscale social surveys are usually based on those of the UK\nCensus, and these are revised decennially4 (for a discussion\nof the comparability of the ethnicity measures used in the\nlar measures are collected over time, they may have only\n`nominal equivalence' and lack `functional equivalence',\nbecause the relative meaning of being in a certain category\nmay not be the same from one time point to another (Van\nDeth, 2003). There are some published recommendations\nof good practice for using standard ethnicity categories for\nlongitudinal comparisons (see Afkhami, 2012; Platt et al.,\nthat previous comparative studies provide the most appro-\npriate benchmarks for further endeavours. In the special\ncase when longitudinal data allow for records to be linked\nfor the same people at different time points, it is sometimes\npossible to derive consistent ethnicity measures by focus-\nsing upon the measures used at a particular agreed time\nAs well as challenges of temporal consistency, survey\ndata analysis projects often experience difficulties because\nthe survey data itself have coverage of ethnic groups that is\nTable 1.

Large-scale nationally representa-\ntive social surveys may have only a small numbers of cases\nfrom certain ethnic minority groups. This sparsity can inhibit\nsome statistical analyses. A commonly used strategy to\nrespond to data sparsity when analysing ethnic group pat-\nterns is to merge together smaller ethnic groups into com-\nbined categories or to drop the groups from the analysis\naltogether. These steps are usually taken for pragmatic rather\nthan theoretical reasons. This approach may be plausible in\nsome situations, but it is obvious that there are also risks that\nmore complex empirical patterns might be overlooked.\nSome modern social surveys (e.g. the UK Millennium\nCohort Study and the UK Household Longitudinal Study)\nhave complex sampling designs, such as `boost' samples that\nare designed to increase coverage of selected minority cate-\ngories. This is not a simple solution to the problem of sparsity\nas it adds complexity to the survey sample which should be\nappropriately taken into account in analyses (for an accessible\nis common for survey researchers to generate summary statis-\ntics from data with complex sampling designs that use meth-\nods which do not take account of the complex survey design.\nThis practice has the potential to introduce bias and/or ineffi-\nciency into statistical results (i.e. the inaccurate estimation of\nstatistical parameters and/or inaccurate conclusions about\ntheir generalisability).\nTo bypass such complications, researchers interested in\nstudying ethnicity often deliberately focus on datasets that\nmaximisecoverageofethnicminoritygroups.Nevertheless,\nwhile there are many possible strategies for dealing with\nsurvey data that have sparse coverage of minority groups\nand/or that have a complex sampling design, it is always\ndesirable to clearly communicate the approach taken (such\nas merging categories), and when possible to explore dif-\nferent analytical strategies through theoretically grounded\nsensitivity analysis (such as generating results with and\nwithout sampling design controls or different merged\ncategories).\nThe multiple characteristics approach\nPlacing survey respondents in a single, mutually exclusive\ncategory may overlook some important dimensions of eth-\nnicity. In many accounts, ethnicity is a multidimensional\nconcept which includes a number of elements (e.g. ancestry,\nnational identity, religion and country of birth) (see Aspinall,\n2011), and there is some evidence that the importance of dif-\nferent dimensions of ethnicity may vary between people. For\nexample, when providing descriptions of their ethnicity in\nCensuses were found to emphasise their national identity\n(i.e. being British) as a central element of their ethnic iden-\ntity (ONS, 2006). South Asian groups, however, have been\nfound to emphasise their religion as a central element of their\nAttention to multiple dimensions of ethnicity can be\nimportant, for instance, when investigations require more\ninsight into how individuals view their own ethnic identity,\nwhat characteristics make up this identity, or how important\nthis identity is to the individual (Burton et al., 2008). For\nexample, researchers might be interested in how an ethnic\nidentity is formed and how this changes over the life course\nethnicity relates to well-being (Mossakowski, 2003; Phinney\net al., 2001) or how self-esteem is influenced by ethnicity\nand Shin, 2007) will probably require measures which cap-\nture more nuanced aspects of ethnicity.\nThe use of multiple measures within a social survey,\nwhich examine different aspects of the concept of ethnicity,\noffers an effective approach to the measurement of ethnicity\nin more detail, since multiple responses across differing\ncharacteristics allow respondents to provide more nuanced\ninformation about their particular circumstances (Burton\net al., 2010). The measures developed for Understanding\nSociety (the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal\nStudy5) are a prime example of this approach (see Table 2 for\nselected examples of the ethnicity questions used in the sur-\nvey). In addition to measuring ethnicity using standardised\nethnic group measures, described above, a suite of measures\nwere also developed to provide information on various\naspects of ethnicity (e.g. country of birth, language, national-\nity, religion), and also the extent to which the respondents\nfelt these characteristics were important to their identity.\nNandi and Platt (2012) developed these questions to offer a\ncomprehensive set of measures suitable for the specialist and\ndetailed study of ethnicity in the United Kingdom. The use\nof multiple measures has also been advocated as a solution\nto comparability in cross-national survey research (see\nIn many analyses, a standardised categorical ethnicity\nmeasure, for example, the ONS measure described above\nwill be sufficient when included in a multivariate analysis\nwith other key variables because this will provide suitable\nadditional statistical control to help to represent the demo-\ngraphic structure of the United Kingdom. Indeed, despite\ntheir recognition of the relevance of multiple subjective\nidentities, Burton et al. (2008) point out that just as in most\nsituations, it is possible to study social class inequalities\nwithout the need to measure class consciousness, therefore,\nethnic group inequalities can be studied using social survey\ndata without capturing an individual's conscious ethnic\nidentity.\nIn other analyses, using a standardised categorical ethnic-\nity measure may be less suitable. There are circumstances\nwhere the analytical focus on ethnic inequalities involves\nimportant divisions that are not well captured by the standard\nethnicity variables. Well-documented examples in the United\nKingdom include the importance of immigrant `generation'\nConnelly et al. 5\nto analyses of social inequality (e.g. Heath and Cheung,\n2007) or the specific interest in `East African Asians' in the\nUnited Kingdom in the late 20th century (e.g. Modood et al.,\nand, more recently, Aspinall (2012) have suggested that eth-\nnicity is a changeable, complex and multidimensional con-\ncept which cannot be measured by allocating individuals to a\nsingle mutually exclusive category.\nRelationships with other variables\nAlongside definitional issues, an important consideration in\nmost analyses of ethnicity is the way in which ethnic catego-\nries are linked to other key differences between people. In\nmultivariate analyses, a common statistical objective is to\nisolate the relative influence of background factors in order\nto identify the distinctive empirical associates with a variable\nof interest, net of other factors. In the case of measures of\nethnicity, there are strong correlations between ethnic cate-\ngories and other socio-demographic differences, so particu-\nlar care is needed in order to avoid drawing spurious\nconclusions about ethnic differences. The key point is that a\nmisleading understanding of the influence of ethnicity might\nemerge if measures are not considered in the context of other\ncorrelations (see, for example, Heath and Martin, 2013).\nSurvey data analysts should place a suitable amount of\nthought, into which key variables and demographic meas-\nures, they include within models that contain measures of\nethnicity and should develop their multivariate analyses\nfrom theoretically guided exploratory data analyses.\nOne important issue to consider is that in the United\nKingdom, there are strong cohort demographic patterns that\nare linked to ethnic minority groups due to concentrated\ndifferences arise between ethnic groups that reflect their\nimmigrant-cohort background (including some regional set-\ntlement patterns that have led in time to disproportionate resi-\ndence of some minority groups in areas of high deprivation).\nSome social outcomes and many health outcomes vary\nsubstantially according to age. Because certain ethnic groups\nhave younger age structures than others, there is a pressing\nneed to control for these differences in age when analysing\ndata (for details on the age profiles of ethnic groups in the\nstatistical modelling approaches, additional controls for the\nmain effects of age may often be adequate. It is also plausible\nthat an ageing process itself may vary by ethnic group, these\npatterns could ideally be explored by testing for statistical\ninteractions between measures of age and ethnicity.\nFor many ethnic minorities in the United Kingdom, data\nthat can be measured in relation to immigration may also be\nvery important to build into an analysis. For example, whether\nor not individuals are born in the country of residence, how\nlong their family has lived in the country, their proficiency in\nthe host country language and whether their educational par-\nticipation was in the host or origin country, may be relevant to\nsome analyses. These patterns may affect important outcomes\nsuch as chances and choices in the labour market.\nIn the social sciences, there is an analytical literature on\nthe differences between the experiences and outcomes of\nimmigrants, and those born in the host society (e.g. Algan\n2007). One common approach is to characterise survey\nrespondents into different `immigrant generations'. Typically\nTable 2. Examples of questions that are suited to a\nmultidimensional approach.

Other categories are occa-\nsionally identified such as the `third' and `subsequent gener-\nations'. In some cases, researchers also define the `1.5\ngeneration', which are those who were born abroad but\nmoved to the host society as young children and had the bulk\nof their schooling in the host country (e.g. Allensworth,\nof ethnic inequalities in the United Kingdom have not taken\naccount of characteristics linked to immigration or differ-\nences between immigrant `generations'. However, large-\nscale social surveys do often include measures related to\nimmigration, and some writers argue that these should be\nincreasingly central to research on ethnicity (Platt, 2005).\nIn the United Kingdom and in many other nations, some\nethnic minority groups exhibit sustained differences in pat-\nterns of family formation and living arrangements in com-\nparison with other groups. Most well-known in the United\nKingdom are patterns of larger household size and younger\naverage ages at marriage and family formation, among South\nAsian ethnic minority groups (e.g. Coleman and Salt, 1996).\nDifferences in family patterns are often presumed to reflect\nthe influence of cultural heritage, but there are also complex-\nities to demographic differences between ethnic groups\nwhich defy a characterisation based on cultural heritage\nalone (e.g. Shaw, 2014). Family circumstances do have a\nsubstantial influence on many other social outcomes within\nthe United Kingdom, including employment arrangements,\nsocio-economic circumstances and patterns of lifestyle and\nsocial support. Accordingly, the association between ethnic-\nity and average variations in family circumstances is another\nissue to consider. It might often be unsatisfactory to analyse\ndifferences by ethnic group without considering other varia-\ntions in average family circumstances.\nThere are pronounced ethnic differences in settlement\npatterns within countries such as the United Kingdom\nwith other areas of the United Kingdom, some urban areas in\nLondon, the North West of England and the English Midlands\nhave much higher ethnic minority populations. Ethnic minor-\nity groups are often clustered in areas of high deprivation,\nand this may be particularly relevant to studies of social net-\nworks and neighbourhood effects (see, for example, B\u00e9cares\nSimpson (2009) argue that the extent and consequences of\nregional segregation are sometimes exaggerated.\nFrom a survey data analytical perspective, there is a per-\nsuasive argument for considering geographical issues when\nstudying patterns of ethnic difference. Conventionally,\nhigher level regional measures can be entered into analyses\nto attempt to separate geographic from ethnicity effects. In\nsome applications, different regional settlement patterns by\nethnic groups in the United Kingdom are thought to occur\nbecause of differential industrial and employment sector\nopportunities (see Iganski and Payne, 1999). In this scenario,\nan appropriate response to the recognition of regional settle-\nment differences may be to include measures of industrial\nsector or employment circumstances in analyses rather than\ncrude measures of geography.\nAll of these additionally relevant factors have an influ-\nence on the interpretation of patterns of difference linked to\nmeasures of ethnicity. Clearly, it is important for the\nresearcher to consider whether and how the relationship\nbetween ethnicity and other measures is best represented\nwithin the analysis. It may be a priority to `control for' sepa-\nrable differences, for example, by using a multivariate statis-\ntical technique that isolates the distinctive effect of one\nvariable (e.g. a measure of ethnicity) from any patterns that\nmight arise due to correlations with another variable (e.g.\nage). Regression models are routinely used for this purpose\nin social statistics, although both simpler and more compli-\ncated, alternative statistical methods can also be used. The\nimportant point to appreciate, however, is that the connec-\ntions between ethnicity and other social differences (as\ndescribed above) are such that, in the United Kingdom at\nleast, it will ordinarily be the case that the pattern of effects\nlinked to ethnicity will not be the same with or without `con-\ntrols' of this nature.\nIt is also important to recognise that `controlling for' other\nfactors is not the only plausible approach to summarising\nsocial patterns related to ethnicity. First, in some scenarios, it\nmay be theoretically irrelevant that another measureable fac-\ntor is in some way driving some or all of a measured ethnic\ndifference. In this situation, the bivariate pattern of difference\nbetween ethnic group categories may be all that a researcher\nis interested in, and bivariate analytical techniques will be\nappropriate tools of analysis. Second, there is increasing rec-\nognition and interest in the social sciences given to communi-\ncating the distinctive experiences of individuals that arise due\nto their unique constellation of circumstances according to a\nnumber of different measurable factors. An extensive theo-\nretical literature on `intersectionality' stresses, in particular,\nthat ethnic inequalities often work in complex combination\nwith other social differences (e.g. Anthias, 2001). From this\nperspective, the best way to summarise ethnic inequalities is\noften to regard the situations defined by important combina-\ntions of circumstances (such as ethnicity, social class, gender\nand age) as being of distinctive importance. For applied\nresearchers, an `intersectional' approach can potentially be\nfollowed by summarising statistical patterns for different\ndistinctive social groups. In a statistical modelling approach,\nthe estimation of interaction terms between measures of eth-\nnicity and other relevant measures of circumstances also has\nconsiderable potential to communicate the average influences\nassociated with `intersectional' combinations.\nIn summary, when researchers are seeking to describe the\nrelationship between ethnicity and a key outcome of interest\n(e.g. health or educational outcomes), the relatively strong\nempirical relationship between measures of ethnicity and\nConnelly et al. 7\nother measureable aspects of individuals' circumstances, can\nbe responded to through at least three analytical approaches.\nThe relationship might be deliberately ignored on theoretical\ngrounds, leading to reports of bivariate summary patterns\nbetween ethnicity measures and the outcome of interest.\nAlternatively, efforts might concentrate upon `controlling\nfor' other measurable differences, such as by using regres-\nsion models or other methods to isolate the effect of ethnicity\nnet of other correlated factors (such as age, region or family\ncircumstances). Last, analysts might, on the contrary, try to\nprioritise the description of the intersection between ethnic-\nity and other factors, such as by communicating interaction\neffects or using other summarising devices that focus on par-\nticular combinations of circumstances. Researchers might\nmake a choice, ideally with theoretical justification, over\nwhich approach to follow. We would argue that the most\ncompelling approach in a scientific sense should be to under-\ntake and understand analytical patterns according to all three\nof these frameworks. This should be expected to give the\nresearcher the most insight into the ethnic patterns that they\nare exploring and should best equip them to make an appro-\npriate judgement over the empirical patterns that should be\nfocussed upon.\nCross national comparisons\nAn emerging feature of contemporary social sciences is the\ninterest in conducting cross-nationally comparative analyses\nwith survey data (see Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik and Harkness,\nanalysis of ethnicity is an intrinsically international theme,\ngiven its relationship with international migration. One dif-\nficulty arises because different countries have different histo-\nries of immigration, meaning that it is unlikely that\ncomparative studies of ethnicity will be dealing with compa-\nrable minority groups in different countries.Astrategy some-\ntimes followed is to identify and compare minorities from\nthe same background in different countries (e.g. Crul and\nunsatisfactory because it is likely that there are differences\nbetween migrants from the same nation who settled in differ-\nent countries. An alternative comparative strategy is simply\nto study different ethnic minority groups in different coun-\ntries and make only carefully qualified comparisons (e.g.\nSome reviews have suggested ways for specific measure-\nment instruments to be applied consistently to facilitate\ncross-national comparisons (e.g. Aspinall, 2007; Hoffmeyer-\nond major challenge for cross-national comparative research\non ethnicity, namely that different nations have strong tradi-\ntions of difference in the measures related to ethnicity that\nthey collect in surveys. In many countries, the measurement\nof ethnicity is highly politicised, and an approach used in one\nnation might never be considered acceptable in another. To a\nlimited extent, recent social survey instruments are begin-\nning to negotiate this problem, usually by collecting data on\nmultiple measures that could be subsequently adapted to the\nresearcher's needs. For example, Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik and\nWarner (2010) encourage survey designers to collect meas-\nures of characteristics such as citizenship, country of birth,\nparents' country of birth and language, regardless of national\ntraditions in measuring ethnicity.\nConclusion\nMost nationally representative large-scale social surveys col-\nlect information on ethnicity. We have provided an account\nof how ethnicity is measured in social surveys and reflected\non the relationship between ethnicity and other social ine-\nqualities. Researchers undertaking survey data analyses must\ntypically deal with a number of options and challenges that\nrelate to using ethnicity measures as key variables in their\nresearch.\nWe argue that when studying ethnicity from the `mutually\nexclusive category' approach, researchers should always use\nexisting measures that have agreed upon and well-docu-\nmented standards, and which will facilitate comparability\nand replication. We also advise researchers not to develop\ntheir own ethnicity measures without strong justification or\nuse existing measures in an un-prescribed or ad hoc manner.\nWe have highlighted that general social surveys often con-\ntain categorical measures of ethnicity based on the mutually\nexclusive category approach. For many sociological research\nquestions, these measures will be adequate, especially when\nall that is required is improved control for underlying pat-\nterns in the data that are linked to ethnicity.\nWe have highlighted the potential impact of the inter-rela-\ntionships between ethnic groups and other variables. When\nexploring statistical patterns linked to ethnicity variables, we\nadvise researchers to be cognisant of the potential associa-\ntions between ethnicity and a number of other variables (for\ninstance age, family situation, regional location and socio-\neconomic situation). This may help to better elucidate impor-\ntant patterns in social outcomes. If unrecognised, such\nundetected associations can lead to spurious interpretations\nof ethnicity effects. Contemporary data analysis software\npackages make it relatively straightforward to estimate sta-\ntistical models that include multivariate controls for other\npotentially related factors, and which can test interaction\neffects between ethnicity and other variables. Controls and\ninteractions can often have an important effect on the conclu-\nsions drawn from research, and we would advise any\nresearcher working on ethnic inequalities to consider a wide\nrange of controls and interactions when developing their ana-\nlytical findings. As we have also said with regard to using\nother social science variables, many of the different options\navailable when analysing measures of ethnicity can usefully\nbe explored by conducting additional sensitivity analysis,\nsomething that is made relatively easy by contemporary\n8 Methodological Innovations\nsoftware capabilities. For instance, it is sensible to run a\nseries of analyses with and without different alternative ver-\nsions of measures of ethnicity, and with and without different\nadditional controls and interaction terms.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1.
