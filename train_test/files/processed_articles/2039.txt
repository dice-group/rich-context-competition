The study populations for risk factors were adults aged 25\u00ad74 years\nrates in the Twin Cities and nationally between 1980 and 2000. Similar decreasing rates of change in risk factors\nacross survey years, parallel to the CHD mortality rate decline, were observed in MHS and in NHANES. Adults in\nMHS had generally lower levels of CHD risk factors than NHANES adults, consistent with the CHD mortality rate\ndifference. Approximately 47% of women and 44% of men in MHS had no elevated CHD risk factors, including\nsmoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, and obesity, versus 36% of women and 34% of men in NHANES. The\nbetter CHD risk factor profile in the Twin Cities may partly explain the lower CHD death rate there.\ncardiovascular diseases; coronary disease; Minnesota; population surveillance; risk factors\nAbbreviations: BRFSS, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System; CHD, coronary heart disease; CVD, cardiovascular disease;\nMHS, Minnesota Heart Survey; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\nThe national rate of death due to cardiovascular disease\nhad one of the lowest age-adjusted CVD death rates nation-\ning the question of whether Minnesota may have better\nCVD risk factor levels from preventive management and/\nor cardiovascular care than other states (2, 3).\nMonitoring the trends in CVD risk factors in popula-\ntions enhances our understanding of mortality trends,\nsince these trends are dynamic and are influenced by the\nhealth environment, personal health behaviors, and med-\nical care. According to a previous report, 44% of the de-\ncline in CVD mortality among US adults between 1980\nand 2000 was due to changes in CVD risk factors (4).\nSpecifically, reductions in total cholesterol, blood pres-\nsure, smoking, and physical inactivity contributed 24%,\n20%, 12%, and 5%, respectively, to the decreased CVD\nmortality rate (4). However, the national obesity epidemic\nhas been associated with increased prevalence of diabetes\nand elevations in blood pressure and lipid levels (5, 6).\nChanges in eating patterns have also been demonstrated\n(7). There is already evidence that the prevalence of hy-\npertension is increasing in adults and children (8, 9). Such\nempirical data on population risk factor levels and trends\nare required for appropriate public health and medical\npolicy.\nSurveillance provides an integrated assessment of health\nand risk trends in populations. The National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), for example,\nprovides a picture of the nation's health and has been ac-\ntively conducted since the 1960s (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/\nnhanes.htm). Although NHANES assesses many diseases\nand health characteristics, the sampling frame and sample\nsize do not allow detailed analysis of specific geographic\nareas, even those with large populations. The Minnesota\nHeart Survey (MHS), which has been ongoing since 1980,\nprovides a more detailed and specific look at CVD risk in\nvolving consistent measurement methods over a 20-year\nIn this study, we compared the trends in CVD risk factors\nin the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area with those in\nthe United States as a whole using data from the MHS\nthis comparison, we aimed to better understand why Min-\nnesotans have a lower CVD mortality rate than the US gen-\neral population. We hypothesized that both coronary heart\ndisease (CHD) mortality and risk status are generally more\nfavorable in Minnesota than in the United States as a whole\nand that Minnesotans have had a somewhat greater rate of\ndecline in both risk factors and CHD mortality.\nStudy design\nThe MHS, approved by the University of Minnesota In-\nstitutional Review Board, has been described previously\n(10, 11). Briefly, MHS is a population-based surveillance\nstudy of trends in CVD risk factors. The study population\nincludes independent probability samples of noninstitution-\nalized adults in a defined geographic area: the 7-county\nmetropolitan area of Minneapolis/St. Paul. Surveys were\nclusters, and from each cluster, households were randomly\nselected to generate a sample size of approximately 5,000\nadults. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.\nParticipants were asked to complete a home interview and to\nundertake a clinic visit. Home interviews comprised ques-\ntions about demographic characteristics and health behav-\niors. In the clinic, more detailed information about medical\nhistory, diet, and physical activity was obtained. Anthropo-\nmetric and blood pressure measurements were taken, and\na nonfasting blood specimen was drawn.\nNHANES is a population-based survey of the health and\nnutritional status of the noninstitutionalized US population\naged 2 months or older. Information is obtained through\na home interview and clinical examination. Surveys were\n1994, named NHANES I, II, and III, respectively. Since\n1999, the surveys have been conducted on a continuous\ncensus cycle, a multistage, stratified sampling design is used\nto select a nationally representative sample of civilian, non-\ninstitutionalized residents of the United States. Details about\nthe NHANES sampling strategies are available online\n(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm).\nStudy population\nEligibility criteria for participation in MHS risk factor\nsurveys included being aged 25\u00ad74 years for surveys con-\nyears were included in order to determine the CVD risk\nfactor distribution among children and adolescents.

Mortality data for the residents of the Minne-\napolis-St. Paul metropolitan area were obtained through link-\nage with the Minnesota Death Index, a system that has 98%\nagreement with the National Death Index (14). US mortality\ndata were obtained from the National Death Index. These\ndata were age-standardized to the 2000 US population.\nMeasurements\nDemographic characteristics, health habits, and medical\nhistory were assessed by means of interviewer-administered\nquestionnaires in MHS and NHANES. Health insurance in-\nformation was also obtained.\nIn MHS, height was measured with a rigid ruler attached\nto a wall and a wooden triangle while the participant stood\nin stocking feet on a firm floor. In NHANES, height was\nmeasured using a fixed stadiometer while the participant\nstood with his or her heels, buttocks, shoulder blades, and\nback of the head against the wall.\nIn MHS, weight was measured on a balance-beam scale\nwith participants wearing lightweight clothing and no\nshoes. In NHANES II, body weight was measured using a\nTrends in CVD Risk Factors in MHS vs. NHANES 527\nself-balancing scale, while in later NHANES examinations,\nparticipants were measured on a Toledo digital scale while\nwearing only underwear.\nWaist circumference was not measured in MHS in 1980\u00ad\nstanding in lightweight clothing, waist circumference was\nmeasured at the narrowest part of the torso using an anthro-\npometric tape aligned horizontally with the floor. In\nNHANES III, waist circumference was measured at the\njunction of the iliac crest and the midaxillary line, whereas\nfrom 1999 onward, it was measured at the natural waist\nmidpoint between the lowest aspect of the rib cage and\nthe highest point of the iliac crest.\npressure was measured with a Hawksley random-zero\nsphygmomanometer (Hawksley, West Sussex, United King-\nSystems Information Technologies, Inc., Milwaukee, Wis-\nconsin) was also used in addition to the random-zero device;\nThe average of 2 measurements taken at rest was calculated\nand was calibrated to the mercury sphygmomanometer. In\nNHANES, measurements were performed using a mercury\nsphygmomanometer according to a standardized procedure.\nThe result was generated from the average of 3 measure-\nments for each subject (15).\nIn MHS, nonfasting serum cholesterol level was measured.\n(TechniCon Corporation, Emeryville, California) with a non-\nenzymatic method was used and calibrated against the refer-\nence Abell-Kendall method. An enzymatic method was used\nLiebermann-Burchard reaction method was used to analyze\nserum samples, and equivalent Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention reference values were adjusted. In NHANES\nIII, serum cholesterol was measured on a Hitachi 717\nAnalyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana) using\ncommercial reagents (Roche/Boehringer Mannheim\nDiagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana) on the basis of an\nTable 1.

Both stud-\nies used laboratories that participated in the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention Lipid Standardization Program.\nLevels of glucose, triglycerides, and low density lipopro-\ntein cholesterol were not assessed in MHS, because blood\nwas drawn under a nonfasting status.\nStatistical analyses\nData were analyzed with SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Institute\nInc., Cary, North Carolina) and SUDAAN, version 10.0 (Re-\nsearch Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North\nCarolina). The multistage sampling strategies were taken\ninto account for both MHS and NHANES. To account for\nthe oversampling in NHANES, unequal probabilities of se-\nlection, and nonresponse, we used appropriate sample\nweights to estimate mean values and standard errors (17).\nTo combine data from 2 or more 2-year cycles of the con-\ntinuous NHANES, we calculated new sample weights.\nWe created variables representing abdominal obesity (waist\ncircumference >102 cm for men and >88 cm for women),\nhypercholesterolemia (serum cholesterol level !6.2 mmol/L\nor !240 mg/dL or current use of cholesterol-lowering\nmedication), and hypertension (defined as !140 mm Hg\nand !90 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure and diastolic\nblood pressure, respectively, or current use of antihyperten-\nsive medication) according to the definitions of the American\nHeart Association and the National Cholesterol Education\nThe means and frequencies of study variables were calcu-\nlated for each survey. Since men and women have clinically\nrelevant differences in CVD risk factors and CVD-related\nchronic disease, all analyses were stratified by gender (20). A\nsingle generalized linear mixed model for each risk factor was\nused to estimate level and linear trend across survey years for\nMHS with neighborhood cluster as a random effect, and to\nestimate level and linear trend for NHANES with strata and\nprimary sampling unit pairings as random effects and appro-\npriate sample weights. Survey year was represented as time\nof the generalized linear mixed model represent the estimated\nlevel in 1990 and the average annual change in each CVD risk\nfactor, respectively. The MHS and NHANES intercepts and\nslopes for each of the risk factors were compared, resulting\nin a difference in level (MHS intercept \u00c0 NHANES intercept \u00bc\nleveldiff\n) and a difference in slope (MHS slope \u00c0 NHANES\nslope \u00bc slopediff\n). We estimated the P value for the difference in\n) and the P value for the difference\nbetween slopes (Pslope, diff\n). In subgroup analyses, we restricted\nthe MHS and NHANES samples to Caucasian participants to\ncontrol for racial/ethnic differences between samples.\nRESULTS\nDeclining trends in CHD mortality\nCHD mortality rates have declined over time in both the\nUnited States generally and the Minneapolis-St. Paul met-\nropolitan area (the MHS area), with a lower rate being seen\nCHD mortality rates in MHS and NHANES for women fell\nand 61%, respectively.\nDemographic characteristics of survey participants\nThe mean age of MHS subjects increased across survey\nyears, while the ages of NHANES participants were similar\nacross surveys (Table 1). Fewer racial/ethnic minorities par-\nticipated in MHS than in NHANES; however, participation of\nminorities across survey years doubled in MHS and increased\n2.5-fold in NHANES. Overall education levels among both\nMHS and NHANES participants consistently increased over\ntime. Although the proportions of men and women graduat-\ning from college significantly increased across all survey\nyears, more Minnesotans were college graduates in each\nsurvey year than were members of the general population.\nDeclining trends in CHD risk factors\nTrends in adverse CVD risk factors declined over 20\nyears in both surveys. The declines were similar in the 2\nstudies for women (Table 2 and Figures 1A and 2A) and\nmen (Table 3 and Figures 1B and 2B). There were 2 excep-\ntions. Systolic blood pressure in men declined faster in\nNHANES than in MHS, and obesity increased, although\nat a similar rate between the 2 studies (Figure 3). Energy\nintake significantly increased across survey years in all\nadults, except for men enrolled in MHS; however, total\nand saturated fat intake decreased over time.\nLower levels of CHD risk factors in MHS\nSince the annual rates of decline were similar for each\nrisk factor, we compared overall risk factor levels between\nthe 2 surveys in women and in men. Generally, MHS women\nhad a better CVD risk factor profile than women in\nNHANES (Table 4). Although the men in MHS had a higher\nbody mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2) than those en-\nrolled in NHANES, Minnesotans had a smaller waist cir-\ncumference, lower blood pressure and total cholesterol, and\nlower prevalences of smoking, hypertension, and high cho-\nlesterol than men in NHANES (Table 5). Because of a faster\nrate of decline, the general difference in systolic blood pres-\nsure in men between the studies disappeared by 2000.\nWe created a risk factor score representing the number of\nadverse risk factors for individuals, including current smok-\ning, obesity, hypertension, and high cholesterol.

Study results\nwere similar for analyses of Caucasians only.\nDISCUSSION\nThe ecologic data presented here suggest that both\nCHD mortality rates and CHD risk factor levels were\ndecreasing continuously during the study period in both\nMinnesota and the United States as a whole, with Min-\nnesota generally being at a lower level. According to\nboth MHS and NHANES findings, the patterns of most\nCVD risk factors have improved over the past 25 years,\nwith a lower overall CVD risk profile in Minnesotans.\nMore adults in MHS than in NHANES were free of\nadverse CVD risk factors or had only 1 CVD risk factor.\nSmoking, known to increase CHD risk at least 2-fold,\nwas lower among women and men in MHS than in the\ngeneral US population, even though these rates have\nbeen on the decline in both populations. As previously\nreported by MHS investigators, systolic and diastolic\nblood pressure levels and serum total cholesterol con-\ncentrations have declined over the past 2 decades, de-\nNotably, the prevalences of hypertension and high cho-\nlesterol were lower across survey years among MHS\nFigure 1.

First, the Minnesota and national CHD mortality\ntrends have been continuous, with little change in slope\nfor many years and with Minnesota rates generally being\nlower than national rates. Second, risk factor levels declined\nboth in Minnesota and nationally, generally at similar rates\n(contrary to our hypothesis that risk factors would be de-\nclining faster in Minnesota than nationally), again with Min-\nnesotans generally having lower risk. Because there was no\nclear change of slope in the CHD mortality curve and be-\ncause the number of surveys was small, it was not possible\nto perform an analysis of lag time between risk factor\nchange and CHD mortality change. However, the pattern\nof decline in mortality and risk factors between Minnesota\nand the nation overall is consistent with a role for declining\nCHD risk factor levels in determining a decline in CHD\nmortality. Investigators who have modeled risk factors and\nCVD mortality in prospective studies have attributed the\ndecline in CHD mortality, in part, to reductions in the mod-\nifiable CVD risk factors (4, 22). For example, investigators\nfrom the British Regional Heart Study concluded that 46%\nof the decline in incident myocardial infarction over 25\nyears among men could be explained by reduced prevalence\nof smoking and improved levels of blood pressure, high\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol, and non-high density lipo-\nprotein cholesterol (22). Although blood pressure and lipid\nlevels were not measured in the Nurses' Health Study,\nFigure 2.

Normal-weight and obese middle-aged men and\nwomen who maintained their weight over 9 years of\nfollow-up had improved blood pressure and lipid levels,\nand in this study, the change was not due to medication\nuse (31). However, excessive weight gain over 9 years was\nassociated with unfavorable changes in CVD risk factors.\npressure and cholesterol levels improved in adults regard-\nless of diabetes status, although many were treated with\nmedication (32). Unlike other CVD risk factors, the prev-\nalences of overweight and obesity (body mass index !25)\nand abdominal obesity have been on the rise since the\n1980s; the latter is thought to better predict CVD risk\nthrough its relation with insulin resistance and the meta-\nlence of obesity in MHS men than in NHANES men, waist\ncircumference and abdominal obesity were consistently\nlower in MHS than in NHANES across survey years.\nHigher educational achievement and better eating patterns\nmay also explain the better CVD risk profile among Min-\nFigure 3.

Bars, standard error.\nDespite these generally promising trends, hypertension\nand dyslipidemia remain a burden among US adults (37\u00ad\n40), which may be due in part to disparities in diagnosis,\nmanagement, and treatment among race/ethnicity, gender,\nfindings among Caucasians in MHS and NHANES were\nsimilar to those observed in the primary analysis, which\nincluded minority participants.\nFew studies have compared CVD risk factor trends\namong regional and national samples. Using data from the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral\nRisk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) (45), Greenlund\net al. (46) demonstrated an increased prevalence of multiple\nCHD risk factors in the 1990s. Although CHD risk factor\nlevels declined in our NHANES data, this inconsistency\nbetween studies may be due to the self-report nature of data\ncollected in the BRFSS, a telephone-based surveillance sys-\ntem, as compared with the objectively measured CVD risk\nfactors in NHANES. The observed increases in multiple\nCVD risk factors, however, may actually reflect increases\nin awareness of CVD risk factors, although Greenlund et al.\nclaimed that the BRFSS estimates were comparable to\nNHANES estimates for some CVD risk factors (46).\nLimitations of the present study include the separate sur-\nveillance systems. NHANES and MHS use different mea-\nsurement methods and sampling strategies, which have been\ndescribed elsewhere (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm;\n11). For example, the method of measuring blood pressure\nchanged over time, despite the overlap in study periods and\ncorrective adjustments (11). Only 1 self-report, 24-hour di-\netary recall was used in each study, which may not represent\nusual dietary intake. Thus, misclassification of nutrient in-\ntake may exist in both studies, but misclassification is likely\nto be similar for both. Some differences in MHS and\nNHANES participants may be related to age and race/eth-\nnicity, though all analyses were adjusted for age and strat-\nified by gender. The results of subgroup analyses were\nconsistent with those of the primary analyses, suggesting\nthat differences in race/ethnicity had a minimal effect on\nthe results.\nTable 4.

The 2 studies\nhad similar designs, including the use of population-based\nserial cross-sectional surveys. Rarely have studies been con-\nducted to describe and compare the levels of multiple risk\nfactors across populations over long time periods. In addi-\ntion, with inclusion of laboratory and clinic assessments in\nboth MHS and NHANES, misclassification is probably\nsmaller than in other surveillance studies, such as the\nBRFSS, where participants are asked to report their own\nweight, blood pressure, and cholesterol status (45).\nThese findings of a better CVD risk factor profile are\nconsistent with Minnesota's lower rates of CHD. Earlier\nreports provided evidence of improved cardiac disease prev-\nalence through downward trends in hospitalization rates for\nCHD, congestive heart failure, and stroke (21, 47, 48). Hos-\npitalization rates are substantially lower in Minnesota than\nin the US generally (47). Another potential explanation for\nfavorable outcomes may be the high quality of health care in\nMinnesota (49). Thus, we have demonstrated that Minnesota's\nlower rates of CHD may be explained by better CVD risk\nfactor profiles and, we surmise, greater access to high-quality\nhealth care as well (50).\n"
