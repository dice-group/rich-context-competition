It is, therefore, not surprising\nthat chronic pain is the most common symptom\nfor which patients seek medical care [3]. Chronic\npain is associated with substantial psychological\ndistress, functional impairment, and disability\n[4\u00ad6]. For example, chronic back pain is one of the\nmajor causes of absence from work in people\nunder 45 years of age [7], and over a quarter of\npatients with chronic widespread pain receive\nsome form of disability or injury compensation [8].\nIn the  , 13% of the working popula-\ntion experienced pain in the last 2 weeks that\nreduced their ability to work [9], and chronic pain\nresults in an estimated annual $61bn of lost pro-\nductivity [9]. Although there are some successful\ntreatments for chronic pain caused by cancer,\ntreatment for other chronic pain is often difficult\nand unsuccessful [10\u00ad12]. This is especially true\nfor chronic widespread pain [13].\nReviews of the literature have documented\nstriking variations in the prevalence of chronic\npain all over the world (e.g., [6,14]), including a\nWorld Health Organization multicenter study\nthat reported baseline estimates of nonminor pain\nranging from 5% to 41% for women and from 4%\nbetween different countries, prevalence estimates\nare heavily influenced by the methods used to\nassess pain and the conditions under which data\nReprint requests to: Jochen Hardt, PhD, University of Dues-\nseldorf, Psychosomatics, Rheinische Kliniken, Bergische\ngmx.de.\nare collected. For example, telephone surveys tend\nto result in lower rates of pain than mailed ques-\ntionnaires [17\u00ad20]. Self-reported pain in the\n  also differs by race and ethnicity,\nwith most studies showing higher rates of pain for\nAfrican Americans compared with non-Hispanic\nwhite people [21\u00ad23], but lower rates in African\nAmericans and Hispanics have also been reported\n[2]. The underlying reasons for this variation are\nnot well understood [24,25]. A study examining\nfour methods of experimentally induced pain did\nnot detect any difference in the pain threshold\nbetween African Americans, Hispanics, and non-\nHispanic white people, although pain tolerance\nwas somewhat higher in the latter group [26]. For\nexample, non-Hispanic white people left their\nhands in very cold water (5\u00b0C) for an average of 47\nseconds, compared with 42 seconds for African\nAmericans and Hispanics. Most likely, a variety of\ncultural, socioeconomic, and biological factors, as\nwell as interactions with the health care system,\nconverge to affect the pain experience among\nPrevious population-based estimates of pain\nin the   have relied on data from\nthe National Health and Nutrition Survey\n(NHANES), a series of surveys initiated in 1971 to\nassemble national data on health and nutrition\noutcomes. Based on the NHANES data collected\nlence of musculoskeletal or joint pain lasting 1\nmonth during the previous year was estimated at\n14% [27]. When the same cohort was reinter-\nviewed 8\u00ad10 years later, the prevalence of muscu-\nloskeletal or joint pain was 20%, with higher rates\nin women than men, and in older compared with\nyounger respondents [28]. No differences by race/\nethnicity were noted in either analysis. We used\npopulation prevalence of nonminor chronic local-\nized and widespread pain in the  , and\nto examine whether the pattern of chronic pain\ndiffers by age, sex, or race/ethnicity.\nMethods\nSurvey and Sample\nThe NHANES is a series of large population-\nbased health surveys that have been administered\nto representative samples of Americans since 1971\nand made available for public use. All surveys\nhave oversampled racial/ethnic minorities to\nensure adequate representation in the datasets, but\nthe NHANES does not oversample women. The\nfirst three surveys are referred to as NHANES I\nNHANES has been administered continuously,\nwith data released to the public every 2 years.\nrespondents 20 years old completed an addi-\ntional miscellaneous pain questionnaire in English\nthrough personal interviews. With respect to sex,\nage, socioeconomic status, and rural vs urban resi-\ndence, the NHANES is a representative sample of\nthe general   population, with an\noversampling of ethnic minorities. It should be\nnoted, however, that the NHANES is a household\nsurvey, and institutionalized subjects are excluded.\nIn addition, homeless people and households\nwithout telephones are less likely to be included.\nThe miscellaneous pain questionnaire, the dataset,\nNHANES cohorts are available at http://\nwww.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm.\nDemographics\nreport information on age in years, sex, and race/\nethnicity (non-Hispanic white people, African\nAmerican, Mexican-American, and Other). The\nOther category includes non-Mexican Hispanics,\npeople reporting >1 race/ethnicity, and diverse\nsmall subgroups with insufficient numbers for reli-\nable analysis. We have included the Other cat-\negory primarily to provide complete data [29].\nAssessment of Pain\nThe miscellaneous pain questionnaire collected\ninformation on the location and duration of self-\nreported pain. Respondents were first asked if they\nhad a problem with pain within the last month\n(yes/no). Those endorsing pain were asked about\nthe duration of the pain (<1 month, 1 month but\n<3 months, 3 months but <1 year, 1 year), and\nwhich of 32 body regions were affected. They were\ninstructed to only report pain that lasted 24 hours\nand was not \"fleeting or minor.\" For this analysis,\nwe defined chronic pain according to the American\nCollege of Rheumatology criteria as pain of 3\nmonths duration [4]. Hence, all outcomes in this\nanalysis refer to current, chronic, nonminor pain.\nWe analyzed the following seven specific pain\nlocations from the miscellaneous pain question-\nnaire: [1] back pain (lower back, upper back, spine,\nshoulder, and neck) [2], pain in the legs/feet [3],\npain in the arms/hands [4], headache [5], abdomi-\nnal pain [6], pain in the face/teeth, and [7] chest\nHardt et al.\npain. These seven NHANES pain location out-\ncomes were coded as binary variables (present/not\npresent). Additionally, we created a three-level\nvariable based on American College of Rheuma-\ntology criteria (no chronic pain, localized but not\nwidespread pain, widespread pain) [4]. Localized\npain was defined as pain in 1 of the 32 body\nregions that did not meet the American College of\nRheumatology criteria for widespread pain. Pain\nwas classified as widespread if it was experienced\nabove and below the waist, on both sides of the\nbody, and at 1 axial location (spine, chest, upper\nor lower back). The full wording of the question-\nnaire is available on the Internet ([30], and a short\nversion is provided as an appendix).\nStatistical Analyses\nWe calculated unweighted means and percents to\ndescribe the demographic and pain outcomes for\nthe NHANES sample, and weighted means and\npercents to make inferences to the total United\nStates population. We also described all pain out-\ncomes stratified by sex and race/ethnicity, and\ncalculated prevalence estimates for the seven\nNHANES localized pain locations and three\nAmerican College of Rheumatology pain types\nstratified by 10-year age categories and sex. All\ninferential prevalence rates and means are pre-\nsented as point estimates with 95% confidence\nintervals.\nWe used regression models to test the associa-\ntion of sex and race/ethnicity with each pain\noutcome, adjusting for age. Because previous\nresearch has suggested a nonlinear relationship\nbetween age and pain [31], we included a quadratic\nterm for age in all models. Men were the reference\ncategory for sex comparisons, and the non-\nHispanic white group was the reference category\nfor race/ethnicity comparisons. We used binary\nlogistic regression to evaluate the association of\nsex and race/ethnicity for the seven binary\nNHANES pain location outcomes, and multino-\nmial logistic regression for the three-category\nAmerican College of Rheumatology pain type\noutcome. We considered an a rate of 0.05 as the\nthreshold for statistical significance.\n2002) weight strata and masked variance units\n(pseudo-primary sampling unit [PSU]) variables\navailable in the NHANES public release data. All\nanalyses were conducted with the SVY commands\nin Stata version 8.1 [32], which use the Taylor\nseries method to calculate properly weighted vari-\nance estimates for the general population.\nResults\nTwenty cases were excluded due to incomplete\nshows the unweighted demographic and chronic\npain characteristics of the respondents who com-\npleted the miscellaneous pain questionnaire,\nand the weighted inferential statistics for the\nU.S. general population. The unweighted age and\nsex distributions in the sample were similar to\nthe weighted population estimates. NHANES\nrespondents were, on average, 50 years old, com-\npared with a population mean of 45 years of age.\nApproximately 50% of respondents and of the\noverall population were female. Due to the over-\nsampling of racial/ethnic minorities, the sample\ncontained higher percentages of black people\nand a lower percentage of white people (50% vs\n72%) than the general population. The highest\npopulation prevalence estimates for the seven\nNHANES pain location outcomes occurred for\nback (10%) and legs/feet (7%), followed by arms/\nhands and headache (both 4%). Abdominal, face/\nteeth, and chest pain had the lowest prevalence\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics for demographic and chronic\npain outcomes\nCharacteristic\nNHANES\nUnweighted\nValue\nWeighted\nDemographics\nRace/ethnicity, %\nPain location, %\nACR pain type, %\nThe NHANES column displays unweighted sample means and percentages;\nthe   columns display weighted inferential statistics for the\ngeneral population.\n* Includes non-Mexican Hispanics and people reporting >1 race or ethnicity;\n Any chronic pain that does not qualify as widespread; CI = confidence\ninterval.\nACR = American College of Rheumatology.\nPrevalence of Chronic Pain in the   805\n(all 1%).

In general, Mexican-\nAmericans had a lower prevalence than other\nracial/ethnic groups. The NHANES pain location\noutcomes for both men and women were lower\namong Mexican-Americans than among non-\nHispanic white people and non-Hispanic black\npeople for back pain, pain in the legs/feet, and pain\nin the arms/hands. For the American College\nof Rheumatology pain types, Mexican-American\nwomen and men had a lower prevalence of both\nchronic localized and chronic widespread pain\nthan non-Hispanic white and black people. Point\nestimates of localized and widespread chronic pain\nwere lower in non-Hispanic black people than in\nnon-Hispanic white people, except for chronic\nwidespread pain in men.\nTable 3 shows the results of the logistic regres-\nsion models for the pain outcomes, simultaneously\nadjusting for sex, race/ethnicity, and age. Women\nhad higher odds than men for all pain sites, but\nthese were statistically significant only for head-\nache, abdominal pain, and chronic widespread\npain. Mexican-Americans had lower odds for all\npain outcomes compared with the other races.\nThe differences were statistically significant com-\npared with non-Hispanic white and black people\nfor chronic back pain, pain in the legs/feet, and\npain in the arms/hands, as well as for chronic\nlocalized and widespread pain.\nA nonlinear age effect was evident in all pain\noutcomes except for those with very low preva-\nlence estimates (abdomen, face/teeth, and chest).\nIn general, pain rates increased up to 50\u00ad59 years\nof age, then declined for people 60 years of age\nand older. The exception to this pattern was\nheadache, which showed the highest rates for 30-\nto 59-year-olds, with lower rates for respondents\nin their 20s and 60s, and the lowest rates\nreported by people 70 years of age. Figure 1\ngraphs the trends for chronic localized and wide-\nspread pain across 10-year age categories, strati-\nfied by sex.\nDiscussion\nWe found that the overall population estimates for\nnonminor current localized and widespread pain\nof 3 months duration were low compared with\nprevious reports. This holds true in the interna-\nsurveys [2,33], and with reports from previous\nof the generally lower prevalence rates, the confi-\ndence intervals around our estimates do not\nexplicitly rule out rates that correspond to the\nrange of values observed in these other studies.\nThe low rates detected in our analyses could be\nexplained by the method of data collection used by\nthe NHANES. For instance, in-person interviews\nas opposed to mailed questionnaires [17\u00ad20], or\nthe wording of the questions, could result in lower\npain rates. Furthermore, the rates reported here\nreflect estimates for current chronic pain. Other\nstudies typically did not require pain to be current\nor even recent, and likely captured any lifetime\noccurrence of chronic pain, resulting in higher\nrates. Finally, the NHANES items focused on\nnonminor pain. Previous epidemiological investi-\ngations that inquired about pain intensity and dis-\nability found that only 8\u00ad30% of participants rated\nWe found that the associations with age were\nnonlinear for almost all chronic pain conditions.\nThe prevalence for both localized and widespread\npain increased from younger to middle ages, then\nleveled (localized pain) or decreased (widespread\npain) among older people. This pattern has been\npreviously reported for back pain, shoulder/arm\npain, headache, and chronic widespread pain\ndescribed an almost linear increase of pain preva-\nlence with age [41,42]. Our analysis might not\nreflect older adults who suffer from nonminor pain\nand do not live in private homes, because the\nNHANES is a household survey and does not\nsolicit information from institutionalized indi-\nviduals or those in assisted living situations. Thus,\nour results are not necessarily inconsistent with\nthe observation that pain increases with age.\nExcept for headaches, we did not observe mean-\ningful differences in the rates of pain between\nwomen and men, even though some other differ-\nences were statistically significant. This pattern\ncorresponds to most previous studies, which have\nobserved a 2:1 female predominance for headache,\nWomen also more often experienced abdominal\nand facial pain, but these differences were less pro-\nnounced, inconsistent, and not always significant.\nLikewise, only one other study has detected sex\ndifferences for all pain regions [46]. However,\nour results did not reflect the striking female\nHardt et al.\nTable 2 Population prevalence estimates in the   by sex and race/ethnicity\nWomen Men\nPain location\nBack\nLegs/feet\nArms/hands\nHeadache\nAbdominal\nFace/teeth\nChest\nACR pain type\nRegional\nWidespread\n* Includes non-Mexican Hispanics and people reporting >1 nationality.\n Any chronic pain that does not qualify as widespread.\nCI = confidence interval; ACR = American College of Rheumatology.\nPrevalence of Chronic Pain in the   807\npredominance reported in virtually all previous\ninvestigations of chronic widespread pain\nhad significantly higher odds of chronic wide-\nspread pain than men, the sex-related difference\nwas less than in other surveys. The reasons for this\nare unclear, but the personal interview and focus\non nonminor pain may differentially influence the\nreporting of pain in men and women.\nBack pain is the most frequently cited region of\nnonminor pain, affecting at least half of those who\nreport any localized pain [6,38]. This pattern was\nevident in our analysis. Chronic pain in other loca-\ntions typically occurs less frequently; however,\nprevalence estimates are strongly dependent on\nthe criteria or definitions used [7,53,54], preclud-\ning direct comparisons of our rates to those\nreported by others. Finally, although not entirely\ncomparable in terms of pain duration or severity,\ndata from previous NHANES cycles are notewor-\nthy. The population prevalence of low back pain of\nduration in these studies was less stringent than the\n3 months required by the American College of\nRheumatology criteria, and is probably responsible\nfor the higher prevalence of pain in the earlier\ndata. Pain of 1-month duration may not be chronic,\nand our lower rates represent more accurate esti-\nmates of current, nonminor, chronic pain.\nOne aspect of this study that deserves special\nmention is our estimates for pain syndromes by\nrace/ethnicity. Mexican-Americans had lower\nodds of reporting chronic pain in the limbs and\nback than either black or non-Hispanic white\npeople. Black and non-Hispanic white people did\nnot have significantly different odds of reporting\nTable 3 Regression models evaluating the association of chronic pain with sex and race/ethnicity, adjusting for age\nSex* Race/Ethnicity\nFemale Non-Hispanic Black Mexican-American Other\nPain location\u00a7\nACR pain type\u00b6\n* Reference group is composed of males;  Reference group is non-Hispanic white people;  Includes non-Mexican Hispanics and people reporting >1 nationality;\n\u00a7 Individual binary logistic regression models evaluating odds of reporting pain at each location vs not reporting pain; \u00b6 Multinomial logistic regression with\nthree-category outcome--no chronic pain (reference), regional but not widespread chronic pain, and widespread chronic pain.\nOR = odds ratio; CI = confidence interval; ACR = American College of Rheumatology.\nFigure 1 Regional and widespread chronic pain preva-\nlence by 10-year age categories and sex.

In a comparable study,\na cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted\non a nationally representative probability sample\nof non-Hispanic white subjects, non-Hispanic\nblack subjects, and Hispanic subjects of any race\nto explore relationships between chronic pain and\nrace/ethnicity [36]. About 33% of each group\nreported \"frequent or persistent pain\" for 3\nmonths during the past year, but the pain experi-\nence and treatment preferences differed by race/\nethnicity. Others have observed differences in the\nrates of pain in various regions between white,\nblack, and Mexican-American adults [2,2,36], and\ninternational investigations have reported that\npain differs by race/ethnicity or cultural group.\nFor example, one study reported that the preva-\nlence of back pain was lower among Mexicans and\nNew Zealanders than among Americans, Japanese,\nColombians, and Italians [57]. In contrast to our\nfindings, British researchers found that muscu-\nloskeletal pain was more common among ethnic\nminorities than among white people [25], and\nwhite people more often experienced face/jaw pain\nthan black people, a finding we cannot address\nas NHANES did not include an analogous pain\nquestion. Lastly, another study in the United\nStates found that rates of headache, back pain and\npain in various other sites did not differ between\nwhite and black people [58]. Taken together,\nthese studies underscore the need to incorporate\nmethods into survey research to better understand\nthe meaning of pain and the pain experience in\nwell-described, diverse, population-based samples.\nThis study has several limitations. First, our\nresults may not be directly comparable to previous\nefforts, as estimates vary as a function of the inten-\nsity, duration, episodic or recurrent nature of the\npain, and the number of body sites involved.\nRegarding the latter, individuals with localized pain\nmay have had pain in >1 area, but did not meet\nthe American College of Rheumatology criteria\nfor widespread pain. A related issue is that the data\ncollected did not allow us to ascertain the intensity\nor frequency of the pain or its impact on function.\nNHANES by personal interview--a method not\noften used in epidemiological studies of chronic\npain and thus may not be directly comparable to\ndata obtained from other study designs. Third,\nbecause the NHANES did not perform physical\nexaminations or medical chart reviews, subjective\ncomplaints could not be correlated with objective\nfindings. Fourth, some individuals with recurrent\nchronic pain, such as migraine headaches, were\nlikely not detected by the definition of chronic pain\nused in the NHANES. Fifth, some observations,\nsuch as the lower rates of chronic pain among\nMexican-Americans, could not be attributed to a\nsingle component cause or easily explained by the\ndata collected by the NHANES [59]. Sixth, smaller\nethnic groups were collapsed by the NHANES into\nthe category \"Other,\" and we could not analyze\nthem separately. Nonetheless, our estimates of\nclearly defined current, nonminor, chronic pain\nwere based on a large and representative American\nsample and are likely to be among the most stable\nestimates available for many of these conditions\noverall, as well as by race/ethnicity.\nIn conclusion, this is a large national epidemio-\nlogical survey that encompasses diverse nonminor\nchronic localized and widespread pain conditions\nand includes adequate numbers of minority\nrespondents. Our findings suggest that the preva-\nlence of chronic pain at various locations is lower\nthan previously reported. Over 85% of the popu-\nlation did not report any current, nonminor,\nchronic localized or widespread pain. Further-\nmore, in contrast to previous reports, we found\nstrikingly fewer sex differences, and with the pos-\nsible exception of Mexican-Americans, generally\nsimilar rates of chronic pain among racial/ethnic\ngroups. Future research should use more stringent\nand carefully crafted pain assessments to facilitate\ncomparisons across pain severity, duration, and\nbody sites.\nReferences\n1 Croft P, Rigby AS, Boswell R, Schollum J, Silman A.\nThe prevalence of chronic widespread pain in the\n2 Portenoy RK, Ugarte B, Fuller I, Haas G.\nPopulation-based survey of pain in the United\nStates: Differences among white, African American,\n3 Cherry DK, Burt CW, Woodwell DA.
