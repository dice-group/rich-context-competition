Anemia in\nchildren, in the age group 1\u00ad19 years, may be defined as\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) norms. The\nprevalence of anemia in children ranges from 31.2% in\npublication of trials evaluating the optimal hemoglobin\nlevel in adult CKD patients has generated considerable\nuncertainty about the target Hgb level in children with\nCKD. It is unclear whether generalizing of results from\nthese trials in adults to children is appropriate. Adequately\npowered, randomized, controlled studies have not been\nconducted on children, and none to our knowledge are\ncurrently planned. The Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA) offers scant guidance on the Hgb target level for\nchildren, other than implying that it should be no different\nfrom that for adults. The purpose of this editorial is to\ncritically scrutinize whether there is a benefit to the\nnormalization of anemia in children with CKD and whether\nadoption of the results from adult studies is appropriate.\n",

Pediatric .\nHemoglobin\nThe benefits and risks of normalizing the hemoglobin\nlevel for children with chronic kidney disease\nProponents of the normalization of hemoglobin levels in\nchronic kidney disease (CKD) have argued for the diverse\nbenefits of correcting anemia in children. These benefits\ninclude improvements in quality of life, cognitive function,\nexercise capacity, scholastic performance, growth and\nnutrition, and cardiovascular function [1]. Quality of life\n(QOL) and its components have frequently been used as\nsurrogate outcome measures for children, since they\ninfluence physical performance, exercise tolerance, and\neven school attendance. However, studies demonstrating\nthese benefits have largely been small in sample size, non-\nrandomized in design, of short duration, and have used non-\nvalidated instruments [2\u00ad5]. In a multi-center interventional\ntrial that evaluated intelligence quotient (IQ) using the\nWeschler intelligence test, treatment of anemia was associ-\nated with a significant increase in IQ [6]. However, the\ndesign was limited by a single-arm and a sample size of\nonly 22 children with CKD. With respect to growth, many\ntrials have demonstrated a lack of effect of anemia\ncorrection on growth in children with CKD [1]. Recent\nstudies have not only demonstrated a high prevalence of\ngrowth retardation in children with chronic kidney disease\nbut have also suggested that initial hemoglobin (Hgb) level\nand early treatment with erythropoietin is associated with\nimproved growth [7]. While these studies have limitations,\nincluding retrospective design and small numbers (47\nchildren), they have been influential in supporting normal-\nization of Hgb level in children with CKD. The evidence\nS. R. Keithi-Reddy\n:A. K. Singh\nRenal Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital\nand Harvard Medical School,\nBoston, MA, USA\nA. K. Singh (*)\nDialysis Services, Brigham and Women's Hospital,\ne-mail: asingh@partners.org\nfor improvement in cardiovascular co-morbidity in children\nwith treatment of anemia rests on the results of a single,\nrandomized, placebo-controlled trial comprised of only 11\nchildren undergoing dialysis. In that study, patients were\nassigned to therapy with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents\n(ESAs) or to placebo for 24 weeks. ESA therapy was\nassociated with partial correction of an elevated cardiac\nindex at 6 months and a significant reduction in left\nventricular mass at 12 months [8]. The subjects in that\nstudy were severely anemic, with baseline Hgb of 7.3 g/dl.\nIt was suggested that these data were concordant with those\nfrom two observational studies providing further resonance\nto the importance of anemia treatment [9]. A recent study\nexamined 677 adolescents on hemodialysis for the rela-\ntionship between Hgb level and the risk for death or\nhospitalization [10]. Patients with Hgb 11 g/dl consistently\ndemonstrated a 60% to 70% decrease in the risk of death.\nHowever, mortality was similar for patients with Hgb levels\nthose with Hgb <10 g/dl, and no significant difference in\nrisk for hospitalization was observed between the various\nHgb categories. Warady and Ho, using data from the North\nAmerican Pediatric Renal Transplant Cooperative Study\n(NAPRTCS), reported an association between a baseline\nhematocrit less than 33% at 30 days after initiation of\ndialysis and increased risk for prolonged hospitalization and\ndeath in patients with incident end-stage renal disease\n(ESRD) who were younger than 18 years of age [11]. A\nstudy by Furth et al. suggested an association of greater\ndecline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with hematocrit\nless than 36%, reiterating the importance of correction of\nBalanced against the potential benefits of epoetin in\ncorrecting CKD are the risks of hypertension, thrombosis\nand atherosclerosis [13]. Exacerbation of hypertension has\nbeen reported by several authors in both non-dialysis CKD\nand children on dialysis [14\u00ad19]. However, many of the\nstudies excluded children with moderate or uncontrolled\nhypertension, either before or during the trial period. Vaziri\nand co-workers, in both humans and animal models, have\nexplored the mechanism of hypertension. Vaziri has\nsuggested that erythropoietin-induced hypertension is a\nnitric oxide-mediated complication [20]. Consequently, the\nuse of lower doses of epoetin (approximately 150 U/kg per\nweek) is recommended. In light of studies supporting a\nprothrombotic potential of epoetin in children, it has been\nsuggested that epoetin administration be deferred for at\nleast 2 weeks after surgery for arteriovenous (AV) fistula to\nThe mechanism by which epoetin might increase\ncardiovascular risk remains unclear, even though studies\nin the adult CKD and dialysis population demonstrate either\nno benefit or increased cardiac events and mortality when\nhigher doses of epoetin are used to achieve a higher Hgb\nconcentration [22\u00ad24]. The reason for the higher incidence\nof adverse events remains obscure; however, the presence\nof erythropoietin receptors in organs other than the bone\nmarrow, such as the vascular endothelium, the myocardium,\nthe kidneys, and the central nervous system, raises the\npossibility that there may be non-erythropoetic effects of\nerythropoietin that might explain the adverse risk [20, 25].\nSince there have been no large randomized controlled\ntrials in children, the correction of the risk of anemia in\nchildren is largely based on extrapolation from adult\nrandomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two RCTs have been\ncited by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in their\nblack box warning: one in hemodialysis patients--the\nNormal Hematocrit study (NHS), and the other in non-\ndialysis patients--the Correction of Hgb and Outcomes in\nRenal Insufficiency (CHOIR) study. The NHS trial ran-\ndomly assigned 1,223 symptomatic hemodialysis patients\nto a hematocrit of 42% versus 30% with high-dose and\nlower-dose epoetin treatment, respectively [24]. Patients\nwere considered to be at high risk of cardiovascular disease,\nbecause they were required to have congestive heart failure\nor ischemic heart disease on enrollment. The primary\nendpoint was the length of time to death or a first non-\nfatal myocardial infarction. The study was terminated early\nby the data monitoring committee, at the third interim\nanalysis, because of the higher risk observed in patients\nrandomly assigned to the higher hematocrit arm of the trial.\nThe study demonstrated increased risk for patients assigned\nto the higher hematocrit [relative risk (RR) of 1.3]. The\nstudy also reported a higher rate of vascular thrombosis in\npatients treated to the higher hematocrit. However, the\nstudy did not address the benefit or harm of maintaining\nhematocrit between 30% and 42%. The CHOIR study was\nan open-label, randomized trial that studied 1,432 patients\npatients were randomly assigned to receive epoetin alpha\nrandomly selected to receive epoetin alpha targeted to\nachieve an Hgb level of 11.3 g/dl [22]. Eligibility criteria\nincluded age > 18 years and an estimated GFR of 15\u00ad\nendpoint was a composite of death, myocardial infarction,\ncongestive heart failure (CHF) hospitalization (excluding\nhospitalization during which renal replacement therapy\noccurred) and stroke. Secondary endpoints included the\ncomponents of the primary endpoint, as well as cardiovas-\ncular and total hospitalizations, QOL and the time-to-\nHgb group and 97 in the low Hgb group [P=0.03, hazard\n1.74]. The higher rate of composite events was explained\nlargely by a higher rate of death (48% higher risk, P=0.07)\nor CHF hospitalization (41%, P=0.07). The QOL improved\nin both groups but did not differ significantly. These trials\nwere supported by a recent meta-analysis that concluded\nthat, when an Hgb level > 12 g/d is aimed for, there is a\n17% higher risk of mortality. The higher mortality was\nattributed to higher risk of cardiovascular complications\n[26]. Despite these studies in adults, higher doses of epoetin\nare being used in children to achieve normalization of\nhematocrit based on data from the NAPRTCS 2001 and\n2004 registry reports [27]. In this report, younger children\nare being given higher doses of erythropoietin (EPO), with\ninfants requiring the highest dose, ranging from 275 U/kg\nRecommendations for the optimal Hgb level in children\nBased on RCTs in adults and largely observational studies\nin children, an opinion-based minimum Hgb level of 11 g/\ndl has been recommended by the European Pediatric\nPeritoneal Dialysis Working Group (EPPWG) and National\nKidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcome Quality\nInitiative (NKF-K/DOQI) with the rationale of improved\nquality of life and better survival [2, 29, 30]. In addition,\nthe EPPWG has recommended the use of iron as an adjunct\nto epoetin in the treatment of anemia. Studies of adults have\nalso suggested that, among adult patients suffering inflam-\nmation and on permanent hemodialysis, when an increase\nin the dose of epoetin is contemplated, administration of 1 g\nof ferric gluconate is effective in improving hemoglobin\nlevels [31, 32]. The EPPWG did not recommend an upper\nlimit for the Hgb level, while NKF-K/DOQI has most\nrecently suggested that Hgb levels should be 11 to 12 g/dl\n[29, 30]. The FDA has most recently stated that the optimal\nHgb level in adults (and children) with CKD should be in\nthe 10 g/dl to 12 g/dl range. The optimal target level of Hgb\nin children is compounded by the age-related variation in\ndefining the normal Hgb concentration and, consequently,\nthe anemic range [33]. Additionally, the variability in Hgb\nconcentration--a phenomenon called Hgb cycling--results\nin quite considerable difficulty in maintaining Hgb targets\nbetween 11 g/dl and 12 g/dl. Hgb cycling is defined as a\nnon-physiological oscillation or periodic fluctuation in the\nHgb level by more than 1.5 g/dl from an equilibrium point.\nOver 90% of adult hemodialysis patients demonstrate at\nleast one Hgb cycle in a year [34]. To our knowledge,\nhemoglobin cycling has not been studied in children.\nIn conclusion, there are limited data that address the\nhemoglobin target levels in children with CKD. Since\nchildren have important physiologic differences from\nadults, and since the effects of the complications of CKD,\nincluding anemia, may be different in children than in\nadults, RCTs in children are desperately needed. However,\nuntil randomized controlled studies of children with CKD\nare conducted, adult studies should help guide the decision\nin children. At this point we recommend aiming for an Hgb\nlevel of 10 g/dl to 12 g/dl in children, commensurate with\nthe FDA guidelines.\nReferences\n1.
