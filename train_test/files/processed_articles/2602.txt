Philip Schumm, MA;\nVictoria Gillet, BS; G. Caleb Alexander, MD, MS\nIMPORTANCE Prescription and over-the-counter medicines and dietary supplements are\ncommonly used, alone and together, among older adults. However, the effect of recent\nregulatory and market forces on these patterns is not known.\nOBJECTIVES To characterize changes in the prevalence of medication use, including\nconcurrent use of prescription and over-the-counter medications and dietary supplements,\nand to quantify the frequency and types of potential major drug-drug interactions.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Descriptive analyses of a longitudinal, nationally\nrepresentative sample of community-dwelling older adults 62 to 85 years old. In-home\ninterviews with direct medication inspection were conducted in 2005-2006 and again in\nuse as the use of at least 1 prescription or over-the-counter medication or dietary supplement\nat least daily or weekly and defined concurrent use as the regular use of at least 2\nmedications. We used Micromedex to identify potential major drug-drug interactions.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Population estimates of the prevalence of medication use\n(in aggregate and by therapeutic class), concurrent use, and major drug-drug interactions.\nmedications increased from 30.6% to 35.8% (P = .02). While the use of over-the-counter\nmedications declined from 44.4% to 37.9%, the use of dietary supplements increased from\n51.8% to 63.7% (P < .001 for both). There were clinically significant increases in the use of\n(P < .001). Most of these interacting regimens involved medications and dietary supplements\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, the use of prescription medications and dietary\nsupplements, and concurrent use of interacting medications, has increased since 2005, with\n15% of older adults potentially at risk for a major drug-drug interaction. Improving safety with\nthe use of multiple medications has the potential to reduce preventable adverse drug events\nassociated with medications commonly used among older adults.\nInvited Commentary\nRelated article\nSupplemental content at\njamainternalmedicine.com\nAuthor Affiliations: Author\naffiliations are listed at the end of this\narticle.\nCorresponding Author: Dima M.\nQato, PharmD, MPH, PhD,\nDepartment of Pharmacy Systems,\nOutcomes, and Policy, College of\nPharmacy, University of Illinois at\n(dimaqato@uic.edu).\nResearch\nOriginal Investigation\n(Reprinted) E1\n \nDownloaded From: http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc.

A\nrecent study25 using the National Health and Nutrition Exami-\nnation Survey (NHANES) indicates that the use of prescrip-\ntion medications and polypharmacy has increased between\nfindings may underestimate medication use and potential ad-\nverse effects because they do not capture information on OTC\nmedications and dietary supplements.\nHerein, we use nationally representative data from Wave\nof medication use, concurrent use, and drug-drug interac-\ntions among community-dwelling older adults in the United\nStates. In addition to comparing rates of medication use be-\ntween the 2 periods, we also examined changes in the risk of\ndrug-drug interactions.\nMethods\nParticipants\nThe NSHAP is based on a nationally representative probabil-\nity sample of community-dwelling adults born between 1920\nsampling of blacks, Hispanics, men, and older individuals\n(75-85 years). As has been previously described,26 a sample of\n4400 individuals was drawn from households screened in\ntermined to be eligible and 3005 successfully interviewed be-\nin this first wave (baseline), calculated using the American As-\nsociation for Public Opinion Research's response rate 2, was\nMay2011,duringwhichsurvivingWave1respondentsandtheir\nspouses or partners (if married or cohabiting) were inter-\nviewed. In addition, respondents sampled in Wave 1 but who\ndeclined to participate were approached again, with 161 (26%)\nbeing interviewed. The overall weighted response rate in Wave\n2 was 74%, and the conditional response rate among those in-\nterviewed in Wave 1 was 89%. All respondents provided writ-\nten informed consent. The institutional review boards of the\nUniversity of Chicago and the National Opinion Research Cen-\nter approved the NSHAP research protocol.\nTo facilitate comparisons between waves, we limited our\nanalytic sample to respondents who were sampled in Wave 1\n(ie, we excluded spouses and partners) and who were 62 to 85\nyears old at the time of the interview. These criteria yielded\nrespondents being interviewed at both waves.\nMedication and Supplement Data\nField interviewers collected data on medication and supple-\nment use during the household interview by direct observa-\ntion using a computer-based medication log.8 In brief, respon-\ndents were asked to show the containers of all medications,\nprescription and nonprescription, including OTC medicines\nand supplements used on a \"regular schedule, like every day\nor every week.\" Medication and supplement names were then\ncoded and linked by generic drug name to a proprietary drug\ndatabase(LexiconPlus;CernerMultum,Inc)tofacilitateanaly-\nses. Additional details on the internal and external validity of\nthis method of data collection and coding have been previ-\nMedications and supplements were defined by type (pre-\nscription or OTC medications or dietary supplements), thera-\npeutic drug class (for prescription and OTC medications), and\nsupplement type (nutritional product or alternative therapy).\nNonprescription medications included OTC medications and\ndietary supplements. We defined any medication use as the\nregular use of at least 1 prescription, OTC, or dietary supple-\nment.Similartoourgroup'spreviousanalyses,8 wedefinedcon-\ncurrent use as the regular use of 2 or more medications at least\nKey Points\nQuestion How has the use of prescription and over-the-counter\nmedications and dietary supplements among older US adults\nFinding In this national population-based study, we found that\nolder US adults were increasingly using multiple medications and\nsupplements, with 36% regularly using 5 or more medications or\nsupplements and 15% potentially at risk for a major drug-drug\ninteraction.\nMeaning Efforts that focus on improving the safe use of multiple\nmedications have the potential to reduce preventable adverse\ndrug events associated with medications commonly and\nincreasingly used among older adults in the United States.\nResearch Original Investigation Prescription and Over-the-counter Medication and Dietary Supplement Use\nE2 JAMA Internal Medicine Published online March 21, 2016 (Reprinted) jamainternalmedicine.com\n \nDownloaded From: http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc.

We also identified potentially major drug-\ndrug interactions using a drug interaction software program\n(Micromedex;TruvenHealthAnalytics)fromalistofthe20most\ncommonly used prescription and OTC medications and the 20\nOther Variables\nAge at the time of the interview was calculated for all respon-\ndents based on date of birth. Race and Hispanic ethnicity were\nassessed via self-report. Respondents were then classified as\nnon-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic (any race),\nor other. Education was grouped into the following 4 mutu-\nally exclusive categories: less than high school, high school di-\nploma or general equivalency diploma, some college, or bach-\nelor's degree or higher. Household income was translated into\na percentage of the federal poverty level (FPL) based on house-\nhold size. Respondents were classified as poor if their house-\nhold income was at or below 100% of the FPL, near poor if their\nor nonpoor if their household income was above 200% of the\nFPL. Insurance status was measured using the question, \"Are\nyou currently covered by any of the following health insur-\nance programs: Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, Vet-\nerans Administration, or other?\" Respondents were catego-\nrized as having a usual source of care if they responded\naffirmatively to the question, \"Do you have a routine place you\ngo when you are sick?\" Respondents were also asked to rate\ntheir physical health using a standard 5-point scale with the\nresponses excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe prevalence of use of any prescription medications, OTC\nmedications,anddietarysupplements,aswellasspecificmedi-\ncations, was estimated separately for each wave, both overall\nand separately by sex. In addition, the prevalence of use by\ntherapeutic class and for the 20 most commonly used medi-\ncations and supplements and interacting drug regimens was\nestimated. All prevalence estimates are weighted using the\nsample weights distributed with the data set to adjust for un-\nequalprobabilitiesofselectionanddifferentialnonresponse.29\nVariance estimates were obtained using the stratum and pri-\nmary sampling unit variables distributed with the data set via\nthe linearization method.30 Confidence intervals were com-\nputed on the logit scale and then transformed to the corre-\nsponding prevalence.\nComparisons between waves were performed in 2 ways.\nInitially, a Wald test of the 2 prevalence estimates was con-\nducted, which provides a test of the null hypothesis that the\nprevalence among those 62 to 85 years old is equal at both pe-\nriods. However, because the use of many medications is as-\nsociated with age, changes in the age distribution within the\nsubpopulation 62 to 85 years old may affect the overall preva-\nlence of use. To allow for this possibility, a logistic regression\nwas fit to the pooled data set (ie, both waves), including age,\nwave,andaninteractionbetweenthe2.Fromthefittedmodel,\nage-specific differences in the predicted prevalence between\nwaves were computed (on the logit scale) and averaged over\nthe observed ages. The resulting predictive margin was tested\nagainst the null hypothesis that the population value was\nzero,31 thus providing a comparison between waves unaf-\nfected by changes in the age distribution. Note that in both\ncases, the design-based covariance matrix of the estimators al-\nlows for the dependence between observations from the same\nrespondent at both waves because both observations are taken\nfrom the same primary sampling unit.32 The dates of the analy-\nsis were March to November 2015.

Most of the interacting regi-\nmens we identified involved statins, antiplatelets (eg, clopi-\ndogrel and aspirin), NSAIDs, or omega-3 fish oils, which may\nnot only lead to adverse drug events due to drug-drug inter-\nactions but also worsen cardiovascular risk.20-24,42 For ex-\nample, the use of clopidogrel in combination with omeprazole\nor NSAIDs is associated with an increased risk of myocardial\ninfarction, hemorrhagic complications, or cardiovascular\nmately 1.8% of older adults (or 1 million) regularly use clopi-\ndogrel in interacting combinations.\nRecent implementation of treatment guidelines promot-\ning statins in the primary prevention of cardiovascular\ndisease,45 as well as the availability of both clopidogrel and\natorvastatin as generics,46,47 may further increase the use of\nthese interacting regimens.
