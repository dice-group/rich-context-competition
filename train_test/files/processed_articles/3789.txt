The common\nconsensus about SS is that there is the tendency in some\nindividuals for blood pressure (BP) to decrease during salt\nrestriction and increase during salt repletion.2 Despite the\ndifficulties comparing different studies, the prevalence of\nSS is approximately 20% in non-hypertensives and about\nnon-hypertensive and 52% of hypertensive subjects.5\nAlthough there is great interest in SS, the underlying\nmechanism has not been fully elucidated. Among the vari-\nous risk factors such as genetic factors, ethnicity, age, body\nmass index, or disease status, including insulin resistance,\ndiabetes mellitus, hypertension and chronic kidney dis-\nease,6,7 the renin\u00adangiotensin\u00adaldosterone system (RAAS)\nis a key player in the development of SS.\nThis dietary interventional study was designed to dem-\nonstrate the specific responses and roles of renin and\naldosterone, and reveal the relationship between these hor-\nmonal changes and the amount of sodium intake in normo-\ntensive and hypertensive SS and sodium-resistant (SR)\nsubjects.\nThe unique response of renin and\naldosterone to dietary sodium\nintervention in sodium sensitivity\nSung Joon Shin1, ChiYeon Lim2, Sang Woo Oh3 and\nMoo-Yong Rhee4\n Keywords\nRenin, aldosterone, sodium sensitivity, hypertension\n1Department of Internal Medicine, Dongguk University Ilsan Hospital,\nDongguk University-Seoul, Republic of Korea\n2Department of Medicine, Graduate School, Dongguk University Ilsan\nHospital, Dongguk University-Seoul, Republic of Korea\n3Center for Obesity, Nutrition, and Metabolism, Department of Family\nMedicine, Dongguk University Ilsan Hospital, Republic of Korea\n4Cardiovascular Center, Dongguk University Ilsan Hospital, Dongguk\nUniversity-Seoul, Republic of Korea\nCorresponding author:\nMoo-Yong Rhee, Dongguk University Ilsan Hospital, Cardiovascular\nRepublic of Korea.\nEmail: mooyong_rhee@dumc.or.kr\nArticle\n118 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(2)\nMaterials and methods\nDetails of the study methodology have been described pre-\nviously.5 Briefly, this study enrolled only normotensive\nand stage I hypertensive participants. Hypertension was\ndefined as follows: 1) a previous diagnosis of hypertension\nwith or without the current use of antihypertensive medi-\ncations; or 2) a systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140 mmHg,\nor a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 90 mmHg.8\nIndividuals were excluded if they were taking medications\nthat affect BP and urinary electrolyte excretion during the\nstudy period. Pregnant or breastfeeding women were also\nexcluded.\nStudy design\nAll participants maintained their usual dietary pattern and\nphysical activity for 2 weeks before they were hospitalized\nfor the dietary intervention. During the 2 weeks of dietary\nintervention, they were confined to the hospital and per-\nmitted to eat only the food provided by trained dieticians.\nOn the first day of hospitalization, the usual diet without\ncontrol of sodium content was given for baseline measure-\nments. During the next 7 days, participants were placed on\na low-sodium dietary approaches to stop hypertension\n(LSD DASH) diet (100 mM NaCl/day) and a high-sodium\nDASH diet (HSD; 300 mM NaCl/day) for the following\n7 days. The amount of sodium in the diets was calcu-\nlated based on food composition tables compiled by a\ngovernment-related organization.9 Fourteen different diet\ntypes of 2300 kcal/day meals were offered to the subjects.\nA 24-h urine specimen was collected to measure the\namount of excreted creatinine, sodium, and potassium dur-\ning the first day of hospitalization and the last day of each\ndiet period. Fasting blood samples were obtained prior to\nthe study period, and on the last day of the LSD and HSD\ndiet periods. A complete blood cell count, total protein,\nalbumin, calcium, phosphorus, bilirubin, glucose, blood\nurea nitrogen, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, tri-\nglycerides, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, low-\ndensity lipoprotein-cholesterol, and total cholesterol levels\nwere measured. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldoster-\none were checked at the same time in the supine position.\nPRA was measured by an immunoradiometric assay,10\nwhereas aldosterone was determined by radioimmu-\nnoassay.11 Twenty-four hour ambulatory BP monitoring\n(24 h ABPM) was measured during the first day of hospi-\ntalization and on the last day of each diet period using an\nautomated, non-invasive oscillometric device (P6\nPressurometer; Del Mar Reynolds, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA)\nwith 30-min intervals for 24 h. SS was defined as an\nincrease in the MAP of >4 mmHg (p < 0.05) in response to\nthe HSD, with reference to previous studies.7,12 The mean\narterial pressure (MAP) was calculated according to the\nfollowing equation: MAP = (2DBP + SBP)/3.\nStatistical analysis\nAll statistical tests were two-sided, and the level of signifi-\ncance was 0.05. Continuous variables are expressed as\nmean \u00b1 SD, and categorical variables are described by\nnumbers with percents in parentheses. Demographic and\nclinical characteristics are expressed by descriptive statis-\ntics for the 101 subjects. The summary statistics are pre-\nsented by the SS and SR groups and also stratified\naccording to all, hypertensive, and normotensive subjects.\nWe performed an independent two-sample t-test to test the\nmean differences between the SS and SR groups. All cat-\negorical data were analyzed using Pearson's chi-square\ntest. The paired t-test was used to analyze the effect of the\nLSD and HSD on the SS and SR subjects. Pearson's cor-\nrelation test was used for the correlation analysis.

The PRA analyses demonstrated a significant correla-\ntion between SR normotensives (correlation coefficient =\ncorrelated significantly with the change in dietary salt\nintake in SR normotensives, (correlation coefficient =\nwere shown in SS normotensive and hypertensive\nparticipants.\nDiscussion\nAmong various studies investigating the effect of dietary\nsalt on BP, almost all were conducted to determine SS\nprevalence or to reveal the different BP responses in hyper-\ntensive and normotensive individuals based on dietary salt\nintake. Despite great interest in SS, the underlying mecha-\nnisms of this condition have not been completely identi-\nfied.13 Although the RAAS regulates BP and controls\nsodium balance, the critical role of PRA and aldosterone in\nSS or SR hypertensive and normotensive subjects has been\nvery rarely revealed. We revealed the role of PRA and\naldosterone systematically in various states of participants\nas a whole; SS with normotension or hypertension, and SR\nwith normotension or hypertension.\nAccording to the results of our study, SR subjects\nshowed a significant decrease in PRA and aldosterone\nregardless of hypertension but based on salt intake. In con-\ntrast, the response of PRA and aldosterone was not signifi-\ncant in SS normotensives. However, only renin, not\naldosterone, decreased markedly in SS hypertensives after\nconsuming the HSD compared with the LSD. Besides that,\nARR was not affected significantly by the amount of die-\ntary sodium between SS and SR group whether they had\nhypertension or not. Although ARR has been used to eval-\nuate hypertension and primary aldosteronism,14 the value\nof ARR is somewhat controversial and is not thoroughly\nevaluated in SS with hypertension or normotension.15\nSimilar results have been reported in other studies. Gerdts\net al. designed a study in which salt was restricted for 6\ndays with a single dose of 80 mg furosemide perorally, and\nthen salt was repleted with 9 g of sodium chloride per day\nfor 6 days.16 At baseline, the mean casual BP of the 30\nh ABPM was 149/86 mmHg. Significant changes in PRA\nand aldosterone were observed between SS and SR hyper-\ntensive subjects at different levels of sodium intake. Egan\net al. studied cardiovascular, neurohumoral, and metabolic\n27 men with normotension or stage 1 hypertension.17 PRA\ndecreased markedly after eating the HSD compared with\nthe LSD in both SS and SR participants. However, the\neffect of hypertension was not analyzed. The PRA and\naldosterone response has not always been consistent in\nother studies. Fujita et al. studied 18 patients with idio-\nresults showed that SS hypertensives and SR subjects had\na significant decrease in both PRA and aldosterone during\nsodium loading (244 mEq/day). Comparing the absolute\nlevel of PRA and aldosterone during sodium intervention,\nSullivan and Ratts reported that during SR, PRA and\naldosterone are significantly lower in SS than that in SR\ngroups.3 This inconstancy could be explained by differ-\nences in the definition of SS, the amounts of dietary salt,\nintervention periods, and ethnicity or baseline characteris-\ntics of participants, particularly whether they had hyper-\ntension or not.\nThe clinical meanings of these specific responses to\nrenin and aldosterone have been reported. He et al. dem-\nonstrated that from an HSD of 350 mmol/d for 5 days to\nan LSD of 10 to 20 mmol/d for 5 days, patients with\nhypertension have a greater fall in BP with a smaller\nincrease in PRA and aldosterone.18 They suggested that\nthe greater fall in BP in patients with hypertension under\na SR was due to decreased responsiveness of the RAAS\nin hypertensives. Krekels et al. reported that the degree of\nBP change was not determined by sodium status, but\nrather renin after 1 week of sodium restriction (55 mmol/\nTable 4.

Aldosterone plays multiple roles in salt and water\nhomeostasis, left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with\narterial hypertension, disturbances in the vascular matrix,\nand endothelial dysfunction.21 Aldosterone also contrib-\nutes not only to the development of SS hypertension, but\nalso in cardio-renal injury caused by metabolic syn-\ndrome.22 Considering the high mortality of SS in normal\nand hypertensive humans,23 the unresponsiveness of\naldosterone to the LSD vs. the HSD might be a reason for\nthe unfavorable and detrimental prognosis, particularly\nin SS subjects. Moreover, this complex phenomenon of\nrenin and aldosterone in SS or SR will go far toward\nidentifying subjects who will be more susceptible to\nRAAS-blocking agents.24\nThere are several limitations of this study. First, the\nPRA and aldosterone data were limited. Hormonal\nchanges were only checked on the last day of each diet\nperiod and were not measured at the beginning of diet\nintervention as a baseline. Second, the study period was 2\nweeks, consisting of a 1-week LSD period and a 1-week\nHSD period. Thus the PRA and aldosterone changes in\nthis study cannot predict long-term responses. Third, the\nresults cannot be extrapolated to subjects with severe\nhypertension and other medical problems such as diabe-\ntes mellitus,25 because this study enrolled only partici-\npants with normotension and stage 1 hypertension\nwithout other health problems. Fourth, the small sample\nsize should borne in mind and the results interpreted\nappropriately. This was, however, unavoidable to some\ndegree considering the limitation of research funding and\na difficult study design in which all participants were\nadmitted to the hospital and permitted to eat only the spe-\ncial study food for 2 weeks.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated the important role\nand different responses of renin and aldosterone in SS and\nSR subjects based on dietary salt intake. RAAS can be\ninhibited or blocked by several pharmaceutical agents, so\nif the exact role of renin and aldosterone could be identi-\nfied in SS or SR subjects, whether normotensive or hyper-\ntensive, more individualized therapy could be applied for\nthose who would receive more benefits by specific thera-\npeutic approaches including a low-salt DASH diet.\n"
