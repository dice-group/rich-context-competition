    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe primary purpose of this study was to explore the influences of training on specific quality of work outcomes of job\nsatisfaction, pay satisfaction, and intentions to leave within high school sports officials. Evidence suggests that there is a\nshortage of high school officials in all categories of high school sport. Via a web-based survey, we explored the effects of\ntraining on the individual outcomes under study. Results indicated that the level of training had a significant effect on job\nsatisfaction, pay satisfaction, and turnover intentions. Analyses indicated that officials with less training had higher turnover\nintentions and lower job satisfaction than officials who had more training. Conversely, officials who engaged numerous\ntraining hours had lower pay satisfaction. This exploratory study supports the importance of training high school officials but,\nmore importantly, provides an initial assessment on the reverse effects of training on pay satisfaction.\n",

As such, these programs have a direct\nimpact on the youth who participate and their families within\ncommunities. General participation from youth in sport\nseems as if it is a common rite and part of American culture\nas the numbers of participants within youth sport continually\ngrow (Coakley, 2009). Although some may argue, reasons\nfor the increased numbers of participation stem from the\npositive traits received from individuals participating within\nthese athletic programs. Such positive traits learned within\nthese programs are proper sport instruction, character build-\ning, and the avenue of sport as a bridge between childhood\nand adulthood (Hansen, Larson, & Dworkin, 2003).\nFurthermore, one's involvement within youth sport as an\nadministrator, coach, or official may increase the positive\ntraits received from overall involvement within youth sport.\nHowever, anecdotal evidence suggests that turnover and\nstaffing may be a significant issue for youth sport officials\n(Yu, 2007). Therefore from a management perspective,\nrecruitment, training, and retention of youth sport officials\nare salient to the continual growth of youth sport within our\nsociety.\nThe existence of these youth programs depend on proper\nmanagement from administrators who oversee finances,\nfacilities, and most importantly the human resources needed\nto execute these programs (Quinn, 1999). More specifically,\nit is pertinent that these administrators recruit individuals\nwho can attempt to continually build a positive youth sport\nculture. Such a task has proven to be difficult, as budgetary\nconstraints do not allow for a surplus of income for those\nwho choose a career in youth sport (Wilcox, 2003). To over-\ncome financial constraints, youth sport officials often turn to\nindividuals who are willing to become involved in youth\nsport as an avocation. An avocation is briefly defined as a\nsubordinate occupation an individual chooses to participate\nin, in addition to one's primary employment (Eitzen, 1989).\nFrom this definition, many individuals who become involved\nin youth sport (e.g., officials) have professional careers out-\nside of the avocation of choice. In addition, it can further be\nassumed that many of these individuals work in industries\nthat demand attention and time resulting in minimal attention\nto other avenues of employment. As such, the primary\ndemands of their professional careers often interfere with the\nsecondary demands of the avocation resulting in high turn-\nover in youth sport.\nMany sport organizations, to a great extent, dedicate their\nplanning hours into recruiting individuals who choose youth\nsport as an avocation (Eitzen, 1989). In addition, administra-\ntors in youth sport spend a great deal of time focusing on the\ncoaching and player development. As a result, opportunities\n1University of Memphis, TN, USA\n2Rice University, Houston, TX, USA\n3Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nTimothy D.

Thornton3\n Keywords\nhigh school sport, coaching, sport officials, part-time worker, pay satisfaction, training, turnover\n2 SAGE Open\nto play and receive formalized training in coaching seem to\nbe readily available in many youth sport organizations.\nHowever, one such area of formalized training that is often\nneglected is that of officiating (i.e., referees). Arguably, offi-\ncials are most important to youth sport contests aside from\nthe coaches and the participant, as their primary focus is to\nprovide an atmosphere of safety and fair play. Practitioners\nare not alone in their under examination of youth sport offi-\ncials, scholars in sport management to a great extent have\nalso focused much of their related works on coaches and\nplayer dynamics (Clopton, 2011; Cunningham & Sagas,\nis scant literature devoted to the individual outcomes of\nyouth sport officials and their influence on the overall orga-\nnization within youth sport. In general, it is relevant to these\norganizations to understand the attitudes and behaviors of\nyouth sport officials whose primary careers are not in youth\nsport.\nTo that end, the primary focus of this study is to identify\nthe influence of formalized training on quality of work out-\ncome of youth sport officials. More specifically, it was the\nintent of this study to explore the influence of levels of for-\nmalized training on job satisfaction, pay satisfaction, and\nintentions to leave high school sports officiating. Presently,\nretaining individuals whose avocation of choice is officiating\nhas proven difficult to many sport organizations (Kellet &\nShilbury, 2007). Following relevant works within manage-\nNatarajan & Nagar, 2011), training is linked to influencing\nthe aforementioned quality of work outcomes. Yet, these\nlinkages have been studied in the general management con-\ntext of full-time employees and have yet to be explored\nwithin an avocation. To that end, we intended to analyze the\neffects of formalized training on job satisfaction, pay satis-\nfaction, and turnover intentions of high school sport\nofficials.\nConceptual Framework\nTo examine the influence of training on job satisfaction, pay\nsatisfaction, and turnover intentions, it is important to come\nto an understanding of each of these constructs. In addition,\nwe intend to identify some of the relevant works completed\nutilizing these constructs and their association within the\nmanagement literature. To date, there are many works dedi-\ncated to these constructs within and out of sport, but there is\na dearth of literature dedicated to examining these constructs\nin the avocational context. We contended that there may be\ndifferences in attitudes and behaviors in the context of the\navocation of youth sport officiating compared with those\nofficials who choose to officiate as full-time employment.\nFormalized Training\nSport organizations are heavily dependent on their human\nresources as the sport industry is very much a service\nprovide optimal service in all facets of the sport industry,\neach organization is vying for the best employees to create a\npremium product or service. The same holds true within\nyouth sport as these organizations actively seek employees\nwho can create an environment for safe youth sport partici-\npation. To offer an opportunity for youth to become involved,\nthere is a need for everyone within the organization to work\ntogether as cohesively as possible. As such, the focus of\nmany organizations and its managers should be the employ-\nees or those who are vested within the organization (Eys &\nCarron, 2001). To that end, formalized training of employees\nwithin the organization seems necessary in controlling qual-\nity, creating organizational culture, and retaining employees\n(Anderson, Rungtusanatham, Schroeder, & Devaraj, 2007).\nFurthermore, training employees leads to tenure and organi-\nzational commitment, which are both positive outcomes that\nimprove quality and productivity within the organization\nwho are committed to the organization and have intentions to\nstay within the organization for an extended period of time\nseek training opportunities. These outcomes of training have\nbeen studied within a perspective of full-time employees\nwithin organizations in and outside of sport. Within the con-\ntext of this study, it was the purpose to explore levels formal-\nized training on individuals who are employed within an\navocation of choice. Therefore, it is important to assess the\namount of time dedicated to training on the avocation of\nyouth sport officials in attempts to understand the influences\nof formalized training on quality of work outcomes. Job sat-\nisfaction, pay satisfaction, and intentions to leave the organi-\nzation are pertinent quality of work outcomes that have been\nfound to influence the individual and the overall quality and\nproduction of the overall organization (Judge, Thoresen,\nBono, & Patton, 2001). As such, each of the aforementioned\nconstructs will be outlined in an attempt to illustrate the\nrationale of importance of training on these quality of work\noutcomes.\nJob Satisfaction and Intentions to Leave\nScholars and practitioners alike have an esteemed interest in\njob satisfaction due to its association to the individual and\norganizational outcomes (Judge, Locke, Durham, & Kluger,\nthe most relevant construct used to measure the individual's\nattitudes toward the job position, organization, and outside\nopportunities within the industry. From this, job satisfaction\nglobally encompasses the individual's attitudes and well-\nbeing gleaned from the job. Within the sport officiating con-\ntext, the demands may be quite intense as officials not only\nadhere to the internal demands of the contest (e.g., fairness\nand player safety) but also the environmental extensions\n(e.g., coaches and fans) of the contest as well (Dale &\nWeinberg, 1990). As such, relevant works dedicated to job\nsatisfaction have suggested that those who report lower\nRyan et al. 3\nlevels of job satisfaction have higher absenteeism and are\nmore likely to leave the organization (Nagy, 2002).\nFurthermore, job satisfaction relates to overall firm perfor-\nmance as those firms who maintain a higher level of job sat-\nisfaction within their employees generally have higher\nproductivity rates (Harter, Schmidt, & Hayes, 2002). Yet,\nwithin the context of this study, it was important to identify\nthe influence of job satisfaction of individuals who were\ninvolved in youth sport officiating as an avocation. To date,\nthere is a dearth of literature dedicated to this area of sport.\nWithin the general business management literature, part-time\nworkers are generally more dissatisfied with their jobs than\nfull-time workers (Steffy & Jones, 2006). As such, it was\ndeemed timely to identify job satisfaction levels of officials\nwhose avocation is in youth sport. Reasons as to why part-\ntime workers, or those employed within an avocation, may\nbe understudied, is due to the general focus of scholars on\nfull-time management and those positions occupied by full-\ntime employees (e.g., coaches). Within the avocation of offi-\nciating, turnover of officials may create instability from\nseason to season resulting in diluting the quality of officiat-\ning within youth sport. As aforementioned, officiating is dire\nto the safety and overall execution of the contest, thus quality\nand experience are a necessity. Within this sport context, it is\npertinent to identify the levels of job satisfaction of youth\nsport officials, as differential management strategies may be\nneeded for the development and retention of qualified\nofficials.\nPay Satisfaction and Intentions to Leave\nSimilar to job satisfaction, pay satisfaction of an individual\nhas been a principal focus of work quality outcomes of many\norganizational behavior researchers. Griffeth, Hom, and\nGaetner (2000) contended that pay satisfaction is linked to\nindividual turnover intentions, which is of much concern to\nyouth sport organizations as many individuals within the\navocation of youth sport have low retention rates. In addi-\ntion, relevant works within pay satisfaction suggest that the\nindividual utilizes social referents to determine satisfaction\nwith pay (Ryan & Sagas, 2009; Williams, McDaniel, &\nNguyen, 2006). For example, individuals assess their pay\nsatisfaction based on their individual contributions (e.g.,\nhours worked) and compensation to those of other employ-\nees who perform similar job duties. Furthermore, pay satis-\nfaction is often a measure of what one receives in comparison\nwith what they would like to receive (Tang, 1995). As such,\npay satisfaction is heavily reliant upon distributive justice\nwithin the profession. This example of pay satisfaction fits\nwell when analyzing individuals who are in a job that is out-\nside their primary career choice, as these individuals may\nvalue their extra time expecting to be compensated according\nto their hours devoted to officiating in youth sport.\nAlternatively, within the framework of this particular study,\nthese individuals choosing to officiate as an avocation may\nhave different perspectives in pay satisfaction. For example,\na sport official whose primary profession is in litigation may\nnot be concerned with the amount of money earned within a\nseason of officiating, and may not use social referents as a\nbasis of pay satisfaction. This individual may be involved in\nyouth sport officiating as an escape from the rigorous\ndemands of their primary employment, but still may have an\noptimal level of pay that will satisfy their efforts within the\navocation of officiating. As such, it is important to explore\npay satisfaction within the avocation of sport officials and its\nrelationship, if any, to formalized training of sport officials.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThis study was part of a larger investigation that examined\nperceptions of high school officiating as an avocation. In this\nportion of the study, only volleyball and basketball officials\nwere selected as an appropriate sample due to similarities in\nseasonal play, the number of opportunities to officiate games,\nand the total number of officials available to officiate during\nthese seasons. Furthermore, basketball and volleyball serve\nas ideal sports because opportunities to officiate for women\nare higher than other sports such as high school football\n(Casey, 1992). A large Southwestern state was chosen for its\navailability and size. The state high school officiating asso-\nciation's member database was used to contact officials via\nbroadcast email asking them to respond to the web-based\nsurvey (n = 1,075). After 2 weeks had passed, a second\nbroadcast email was sent out as a reminder and prompt to\nrespond to the web-based questionnaire. Of this sample,\nbetween volleyball and basketball officials, n = 926 usable\nresponses were gathered, resulting in an approximate 86%\nresponse rate. A large portion of those officials who\nresponded were male 83% (n = 770). In addition, a large\nnumber of the respondents classified themselves as Caucasian\nMeasures\nAll participants who completed the questionnaire were asked\nto respond to demographic questions (sex, ethnicity, age) and\nto respond to items related to satisfaction with their jobs, pay,\nand intentions to leave the avocation of officiating. All multi-\nitem measure items were measured utilizing a 7-point Likert-\ntype scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). In\naddition, respondents were asked to approximate the number\nof hours per season dedicated to training within their avoca-\ntion. Forty hours was used as the dividing time as it most was\nclosest to the middle point for dividing officials into two\ngroups. Those officials who dedicated less than 40 hr were\ncategorized into a \"low training group\" (n = 492), whereas\n4 SAGE Open\nthose officials who spent 40 or more hours were categorized\ninto a \"high training group\" (n = 434).\nJob satisfaction was assessed with three items based on\nHackman and Oldham's (1975) measure. An example item\nfrom the scale is \"All in all I am satisfied with my job.\" The\nreliability estimate produced by the scale for this sample was\n( = .81) and is considered acceptable.\nTo assess pay satisfaction, the Pay Satisfaction\nQuestionnaire (Judge & Welbourne, 1994) was utilized. An\nexample item from the four-item scale is \"All in all I am\nsatisfied with my take home pay.\" As with the job satisfac-\ntion construct, the reliability of the multi-item scale for this\nsample was ( = .77) and is considered acceptable (Nunnally\nFinally to measure individual respondent's intentions to\nleave the avocation of officiating, turnover intentions were\nmeasured through a three-item scale (Jaros, 1997). An exam-\nple item of the turnover intentions scale is \"All in all I often\nthink about leaving the avocation of officiating.\" The con-\nstruct reliability for this particular sample was ( = .88).\nData Analysis\nAs noted above, reliability estimates (Cronbach's ) were\ncomputed for each of the multi-item measures on the ques-\ntionnaire, and means and standard deviation were calculated\nfor the multi-item measures. See Table 1 for these descriptive\nstatistics, including correlations and reliability estimates. To\nexplore the relationships between levels of formalized train-\ning on the quality of work outcomes, we conducted a three-\nway MANOVA. This analysis was deemed appropriate due\nto the number of the dependent variables (DVs) under study,\nand the differences in levels of formalized training (Hair,\nBlack, Babin, Anderson, & Tatham, 2006). The level of for-\nmalized training served as the independent variable (IV),\nwhereas job satisfaction, pay satisfaction, and intentions to\nleave were operationalized as the DVs.\nResults\nThe MANOVA procedures revealed a significant multivari-\nate effect for the three latent variables as a group in relation\nto the level of training of the officials within the data set\ncated significant effects for level of formalized training with\nand intentions to leave the avocation of officiating, F(1, 916)\nidentify officials who were in the high-level training groups\ntion, than those who were in the low training group (M =\n6.18, SD = 0.58). In addition, officials who were in the high\ntraining group (M = 3.29, SD = 1.12) were less satisfied with\ntheir pay, whereas those in the low training group (M = 3.56,\nSD = 1.14) showed signs of higher pay satisfaction. Finally,\nin regard to intentions to leave the avocation, officials in the\nlikely to leave officiating, whereas those in the low training\navocation.\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study suggest that formalized training cor-\nrelates with various meaningful work outcomes. Small but\nsignificant effects were observed between an official's train-\ning amount and their job satisfaction, pay satisfaction, and\nintention to leave the officiating profession. These results\nsuggest some alignment with past research, and should be of\nsome significance to administrators. One possible interpreta-\ntion of the results is that those officials with higher level of\ntraining experience significantly more job satisfaction, have\nlower turnover intentions, but also greater dissatisfaction\nwith pay.\nIn inspecting the results for each DV, the outcome aligns\nwith past research in that individuals who receive more train-\ning often report greater job satisfaction, and thus, lower turn-\nover intentions (Natarajan & Nagar, 2011). Moreover, and of\ninterest, is that referees who have logged more hours in train-\ning may feel that they should be paid more. This can be seen\nas confirmation with some organizational justice theories in\nsatisfaction (DeConick & Stillwell, 2004), where individuals\nfeel satisfaction when their inputs are approximately equal to\nwhat they receive. Likewise, those officials who are in the\nlower training group reported greater satisfaction with pay.\nUnfortunately, the relationship between training and the\nthree examined outcomes need to be evaluated together, and\nnot individually. This justifies looking at the unusual find-\nings of those in the higher training group reporting lower pay\nsatisfaction. However, as might be expected, higher training\ncorrelated with higher job satisfaction. This unusual relation-\nship may be partially due to the avocation nature of officials,\nas referees may enjoy the work they are doing, but may not\nfeel they are adequately rewarded for the hours and training\nthat they put into their work. In addition, it is worth noting\nthat officials, like many volunteers, have some amount of\nTable 1. Correlations Between Measures.\nNote. Cronbach's alpha on diagonal.\nRyan et al. 5\ncontrol of when they work, and as important, when they do\nnot work. In this way, they may act as free agents, as they\nmay have some autonomy in selecting the schools, confer-\nences, and sports that they work with. From a theoretical per-\nspective, this research is significant as it looks at pay and job\nsatisfaction in jobs that are avocations, and it is suggested\nhere that from a theoretical and practical perspective, the\nlevers that motivate and satisfy workers will not be similar.\nIn addition, this research is quite meaningful in sport\norganizations as many operate with a significant number of\nvolunteers or part-time workers (Chelladurai, 2006). It is\nquite possible that many workers within sport enter to be\ninvolved with the teams, kids, organizations, or sport, and\nwhile pay might not be necessary to retain these employees,\ntraining may improve satisfaction for these workers.\nTherefore, a meaningful application for this research is for\nmanagers to invest in training for officials, coaches, and vol-\nunteers, especially when pay is limited or control by school\nor organizational limits.\nFurthermore, it is suggested that much of this research\ncould be replicated to youth, high school, and college coaches\nwho enjoy investing time and energy into a sport organiza-\ntion, and find their work satisfying, yet might find that the\npay received for their job is not aligning with their percep-\ntions of their inputs (Covell, 2012). Again, it is suggested\nthat for these individuals, when pay is limited, training and\nother items may help compensate, and further research could\nbe done on what areas help satisfy coaches, officials, and\nothers in avocation-type jobs when pay is limited. In addi-\ntion, it would be interesting to see what effect role salience\nhas on officials as we suggest that individuals who identify\nstronger with their role of official also are the ones more\nlikely to receive extra training and greater satisfaction in the\njob they do. It is suggested that future research examine simi-\nlar constructs among high school coaches as many of these\ncoaches will work a full-time job in teaching, but identify\nwith, further training in, and find more satisfaction within\ntheir part-time coaching role (Ryan & Sagas, 2006).\nA main strength to this research is the examination of a\nprominent cog of the athletic event--the official. While other\nresearchers have examined the athlete and the coach, exami-\nnation of officials has not been undertaken. We hope that this\nresearch is foundational, not only for officials but also for\nstudying quality of work factors for those in a part-time job\nor avocation. An additional strength is the large sample size\nand high response rate from the officials. However, as with\nany research, limitations should be considered when evaluat-\ning results. One limitation is the limited amount of variance\nexplained for each of the DVs as R2 = 2% for largest value.\nIn addition, the cross-sectional nature of web-based survey\nwould suggest stronger results may be found with longitudi-\nnal research.\nAs mentioned above, future research should consider\nexamination of other groups within sport who work full-time\njobs, but work part-time jobs within sport. Within this, an\nexamination of role salience might be a meaningful area to\nconsider, especially when considering quality of work out-\ncomes like job satisfaction, organizational and occupational\ncommitment, and turnover intentions.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAnderson, J., Rungtusanatham, M., Schroeder, R., & Devaraj, S.\n(2007).
