Serum selenium was measured by using inductively cou-\npled plasma-dynamic reaction cell-mass spectrometry. Peripheral arterial disease was defined as an ankle-\nbrachial blood pressure index <0.90. The age-, sex-, and race-adjusted prevalence of peripheral arterial disease\ndecreased with increasing serum selenium (P for linear trend \u00bc 0.02), but there was an indication of an upturn in\nrisk in the highest quartile of serum selenium.

Glutathione peroxidase synthesis and activity,\nhowever, plateau at selenium levels above 70\u00ad90 ng/mL\n(4). In the United States compared with other countries,\nselenium intake is substantially higher (5), and most\nadults have serum selenium levels above 95 ng/mL (4).\nAt these high concentrations, selenium is incorporated\nnonspecifically as selenomethionine in the synthesis of\nother plasma proteins, with unknown health effects (4).\nIt is thus unclear whether increased selenium levels con-\nfer additional benefit for atherosclerosis prevention in the\nUnited States.\nA recent meta-analysis of 14 prospective cohort studies\nfound a modest, but statistically significant inverse associa-\ntion between selenium levels and coronary heart disease (3),\nbut the 2 US studies in this meta-analysis found no associ-\nation (3, 6, 7). Moreover, serum selenium levels were not\nassociated with cardiovascular disease mortality in a pro-\nspective study in a representative US sample, although\na U-shaped relation was suggested (8). Given the current\ninterest in selenium supplements for chemoprevention of\ncancer (5), it is important to understand the overall impact\nof increased selenium intake on other health endpoints, in-\ncluding vascular disease.\nPeripheral arterial disease, which affects about 8 million\nAmericans, is characterized by flow-limiting atherosclerosis\nCorrespondence to Dr. Eliseo Guallar, Departments of Epidemiology and Medicine and the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and\n(e-mail: eguallar@jhsph.edu).\nin the muscular arteries of the lower extremities and is an\nimportant marker of generalized atherosclerosis (9\u00ad11).\nData on the association of selenium levels with peripheral\narterial disease are very limited (12, 13). The objective of\nthe present study was to assess the association between\nserum levels of selenium and reduced ankle-brachial\nblood pressure index (ABI), a specific subclinical marker\nfor peripheral arterial disease, in the National Health and\nvalues below 0.90 are considered diagnostic of peripheral\narterial disease. Furthermore, a low ABI is an independent\npredictor of cardiovascular risk after adjusting for traditional\nNHANES is conducted by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics (Hyattsville, Maryland) by using a com-\nplex multistage sampling design to obtain a representative\nsample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US popula-\ncause it was the first NHANES survey to measure\nselenium and ABI levels simultaneously. In NHANES\noverall response rate was 76%. Serum selenium and\nABI measurements were restricted to participants aged\nwomen, 183 participants without selenium measure-\nments, 514 participants without ABI measurements in\nboth legs, and 314 participants with missing information\non any adjustment covariate. We finally excluded 11 par-\nticipants with left or right ABI measurements of more\nthan 1.5, usually due to vessel stiffness. The final sample\nwere approved by the National Center for Health Statis-\ntics institutional review board. Oral and written informed\nconsent was obtained from all participants.\nSerum selenium\nCollection materials were screened for potential selenium\ncontamination. After blood collection, serum aliquots were\nobtained, frozen at \u00c020\u00b0C, and shipped to the Trace Ele-\nments Laboratory at the Wadsworth Center of the New York\nState Department of Health for analysis. Serum selenium\nlevels were measured by using inductively coupled\nplasma-dynamic reaction cell-mass spectrometry. The lab-\noratory procedures and quality control methods for serum\nselenium measurement have been described in detail else-\nwhere (17). The between-assay coefficients of variation for\nquality-control pooled samples analyzed throughout the du-\nration of the survey ranged from 2.5% to 2.9%.\nPeripheral arterial disease\nA specific protocol was used to measure ABI in\npressure used for ABI were additional to and different from\nother measurements of blood pressure used to evaluate hy-\npertension. Systolic blood pressure was measured on the\nright arm (brachial artery) and both ankles (posterior tibial\narteries) with a Doppler device, the Parks Mini-Lab IV, model\n3100 (Parks Medical Electronics, Inc., Aloha, Oregon). If the\nparticipant had a condition that would interfere with blood\npressure reading in the right arm, the left arm was used.\nSystolic blood pressure was measured twice at each site for\nparticipants aged 40\u00ad59 years and once at each site for\nparticipants aged 60 years or older. The left and right\nABI measurements were obtained by dividing the mean\nsystolic blood pressure in each ankle by the mean systolic\nblood pressure in the arm. Peripheral arterial disease was\ndefined as an ABI value of less than 0.90 in at least one leg\nOther variables\nInformation about age, sex, race-ethnicity, education,\nfamily income, menopausal status for women, cigarette\nsmoking, alcohol consumption, use of dietary supplements,\nand use of cholesterol- and blood-pressure-lowering medi-\ncations was based on self-report. Body mass index was cal-\nculated by dividing measured weight in kilograms by\nmeasured height in meters squared. Three to 4 systolic blood\npressure measurements were taken and were averaged by\nusing standardized protocols. Diabetes was defined as a fast-\ning serum glucose concentration of 126 mg/dL or higher,\na nonfasting serum glucose concentration of 200 mg/dL or\nhigher, a self-reported physician diagnosis, or current med-\nication use. Glomerular filtration rate was estimated by us-\ning the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study\nequation with serum creatinine values (19).\nStatistical methods\nParticipants were grouped in quartiles of serum sele-\nnium levels based on the weighted population distribu-\ntion. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for\nperipheral arterial disease prevalence comparing the 3\nhighest quartiles of serum selenium with the lowest quar-\ntile were estimated by using logistic regression. Tests for\nlinear risk trend across serum selenium quartiles were\nperformed by including an ordinal variable with the\nmedian selenium level of each quartile in the logistic re-\ngression models. To further explore the shape of the dose-\nresponse relation between serum selenium levels and\nperipheral arterial disease prevalence, we used restricted\nquadratic splines with knots at the 5th, 50th, and 95th\npercentiles of serum selenium distribution. These spline\nmodels require the same number of parameters as the\nquartile analysis, but they can accommodate a wide vari-\nety of smooth risk trends (20). Sensitivity analyses using\ndifferent numbers and locations of the knots, with cubic\ninstead of quadratic splines, and log-transforming serum\nselenium levels gave similar results (not shown). Statisti-\ncal analyses were performed with the survey package in R\nsoftware (to account for the complex sampling design in\nunits, and examination sample weights were used to ob-\ntain unbiased point estimates and robust linearized stan-\ndard errors.\nSelenium and Peripheral Arterial Disease 997\nRESULTS\nThe weighted prevalence of peripheral arterial disease in\nthe study population was 4.9%. Compared with participants\nwithout peripheral arterial disease, those with disease were\nmore likely to be older, black, ever smokers, nondrinkers, and\ndiabetic; to have a lower educational level and family in-\ncome; and to use cholesterol- and blood-pressure-lowering\nmedications (Table 1). Participants with peripheral arterial\ndisease, compared with those without disease, also had higher\naverage levels of body mass index, systolic blood pressure,\nand C-reactive protein and lower high density lipoprotein\ncholesterol levels and glomerular filtration rate.\nParticipants in the highest quartile of serum selenium\nlevels, compared with those in the lowest quartile, were\nmore likely to be older, men, white, and nonsmokers and\nto use dietary supplements and cholesterol-lowering med-\nications (Table 2). Serum selenium levels were also positive-\nly associated with total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein\ncholesterol, and systolic blood pressure and were inversely\nassociated with body mass index and serum cotinine levels.\nThe age-, sex-, and race-adjusted prevalence of peripheral\narterial disease decreased with increasing serum selenium\nlevels (P for linear trend \u00bc 0.02) (Table 3). However, there\nwas an indication of an upturn in risk trend in the highest\nquartile of serum selenium, particularly after adjusting for\ncardiovascular risk factors.

Selenium intake varies around the world\nprimarily because of geographic variation in the amount of\nselenium in the soil (1, 23). In the United States, estimated\nhigher than the recommended dietary allowance for healthy\nadults (55 lg/day) (4). As a consequence, serum selenium\nlevels in the United States are high: in NHANES 2003\u00ad\nof study participants had serum selenium levels above 95\nng/mL. These concentrations are considerably higher than\nin other countries. In Europe, for instance, average serum\nVery limited data are available on the association of\nselenium with peripheral arterial disease. Two small studies\nfound similar selenium levels in patients with peripheral\narterial disease compared with controls, but the dose-\nresponse relation was not evaluated (12, 13).

These studies tended to report\ninverse associations between serum selenium levels and cor-\nonary heart disease incidence, but their sample sizes were\ntoo small for detailed dose-response analyses.\nFindings from the only 2 prospective studies of serum\nselenium levels and coronary heart disease conducted in\nthe United States, however, are consistent with a U-shaped\nrelation (6, 8). In the Physicians' Health Study, the relative\nrisks for incident myocardial infarction comparing quintiles\n2\u00ad5 of plasma selenium with the lowest quintile were 0.87,\nquintiles 1 and 5 of serum selenium in this study were 92\nng/mL and 134 ng/mL, respectively. In the NHANES III\nMortality Study, the relative risks for cardiovascular dis-\nease mortality comparing tertiles 2 and 3 of serum sele-\nrespectively; for stroke mortality, the corresponding rel-\nserum selenium tertiles in NHANES III were 117.3 ng/mL and\n130.4 ng/mL, respectively. In this study, a dose-response anal-\nysis showed that cardiovascular and coronary heart disease\nmortality decreased with increasing serum selenium levels\nup to 120 ng/mL followed by an increase at higher levels,\nalthough the U-shaped relation was not statistically significant\n(8). Finally, in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, the\nodds ratios for incident coronary heart disease comparing\nquintiles 2\u00ad5 of toenail selenium levels with the first quintile\ndose-response relation (7). Both serum and toenail selenium\nlevels reflect selenium status, although toenails reflect longer-\nterm exposure. It is unclear, however, whether both biomarkers\nare comparable in their ability to capture the different types of\nselenium compounds.\nFew randomized trials have evaluated the effect of selenium\nsupplementation on cardiovascular outcomes or atherosclero-\nsis progression, and most of these studies combined selenium\nwith other vitamins and minerals (3, 37). Only 2 of these trials\nwere conducted in the United States, both reporting null results\n(38, 39).

Overall, limited evidence from randomized trials\nhas not shown a protective effect of selenium supplementation\nin US studies. With respect to observational studies, those in\nthe United States have not been able to detect a significant\nlinear association between serum selenium and cardiovascular\noutcomes, but the dose-response associations in these studies\nwere U-shaped.\nThe biologic mechanisms underlying a potential effect of\nselenium on cardiovascular disease are likely complex, but\nthey may be related to the dual role of selenium as an es-\nsential and toxic element. Selenium is an essential micro-\nnutrient that is incorporated into glutathione peroxidases\nand other selenoproteins (4). Increasing serum selenium\nlevels increase the concentration and activity of glutathione\nperoxidases, but this dose-response relation reaches a pla-\nteau at serum selenium levels of 70\u00ad90 ng/mL (4). As a con-\nsequence, higher selenium levels could potentially prevent\natherosclerosis development and progression in populations\nwhose selenium exposure is below the levels needed to\nmaximize glutathione peroxidases (1\u00ad3). In selenium-\nreplete populations such as in the United States, in which\nvirtually all participants have serum selenium levels above\n70\u00ad90 ng/mL, the mechanisms underlying a potential ben-\neficial effect of increased selenium levels are unclear. Since\nselenium supplementation is actively promoted in the\nUnited States, and large randomized controlled trials testing\nthe efficacy of selenium supplementation in prostate cancer\nprevention are under way (40, 41), mechanistic studies are\nurgently needed to establish the biologic basis for a protec-\ntive effect of selenium in populations whose selenium status\nis already high.\nSelenium, however, has a narrow therapeutic range (4),\nand it may even be harmful at intake levels below the current\ntolerable Upper Intake Level of 400 lg/day (2). In fact,\nsome selenium compounds have been documented to gen-\nerate reactive oxygen species (42\u00ad44), and the upturn in\nperipheral arterial disease prevalence that we observed at\nselenium levels above 160 ng/mL could be associated with\nselenium-induced increased oxidative stress. This upturn in\nrisk is also consistent with recent reports showing increased\nrisk of diabetes (45, 46) and elevated lipid levels (47) with\nhigh selenium levels in US populations. For instance, the\nNutritional Prevention of Cancer trial showed an increased\nrisk of diabetes for participants receiving 200 lg/day of\nselenium compared with placebo (hazard ratio \u00bc 1.50,\nthe excess risk was limited to participants in the upper tertile\nof the serum selenium distribution (>121.6 ng/mL), who\nhad a hazard ratio for diabetes of 2.70 (95% confidence\ninterval: 1.30, 5.61). Further research is needed to establish\nthe mechanisms underlying the association of high-normal\nselenium levels with peripheral arterial disease and with\nmetabolic abnormalities, and to determine whether the\nchange point in risk associated with elevated selenium levels\ndepends on genetic polymorphisms in candidate genes for\nselenium metabolism (48).\nSeveral limitations of our study need to be considered.\nThe use of a cross-sectional design and of prevalent cases of\nperipheral arterial disease limited our ability to determine\nthe direction and the causality of the observed association. It\nis possible that the pathophysiologic changes of atheroscle-\nrosis could modify serum selenium levels or that partici-\npants with peripheral arterial disease change their health\nbehaviors, including selenium intake through diet and di-\netary supplements. As a consequence, our findings must be\nconfirmed in prospective studies with incident cases of pe-\nripheral arterial disease. Another limitation of our study is\nthe use of a single measurement of serum selenium, which\nreflects short-term selenium intake and may be subject to\nhigh within-person variability (49). Furthermore, our study\nmeasured only total serum selenium, and we did not have\ninformation on selenoprotein levels or activity or about non-\nspecific incorporation of selenium as selenomethionine in\nother plasma proteins. More detailed analysis of different\ncompartments of serum selenium will be needed to better\nunderstand the association of selenium with peripheral\narterial disease. The strengths of our study come from\nthe rigorous sampling design and the quality of the study\nmeasurements used in NHANES; the representativeness of\nthe NHANES sample; and the use of ABI, a noninvasive\nmeasure of subclinical atherosclerosis.\nIn summary, the association between serum selenium lev-\nels and the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease in\nalthough a U-shaped relation was suggested. Other sources\nof evidence (6, 8) also suggest a U-shaped relation between\nserum selenium levels and cardiovascular outcomes in the\nUnited States, a selenium-replete population. In many pop-\nulations worldwide, selenium intake is lower than in the\nUnited States (1, 23). At these lower levels of selenium\nintake, the association of selenium with peripheral arterial\ndisease remains unknown. Prospective studies of selenium\nstatus across populations with different levels of selenium\nintake and randomized trials stratified by baseline sele-\nnium status are needed to establish the optimal selenium\nlevels to minimize the risk of cardiovascular and other\nchronic diseases.\n"
