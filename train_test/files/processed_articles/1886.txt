The IDF definition led to higher estimates of prevalence in all of the\ndemographic groups, especially among Mexican-American men. The two definitions similarly\nclassified 93% of the participants as having or not having the metabolic syndrome.\nCONCLUSIONS -- In the U.S., the use of the IDF definition of the metabolic syndrome\nleads to a higher prevalence estimate of the metabolic syndrome than the estimate based on the\nNCEP definition.\ntion (WHO) was the first organization\nto provide a definition of the metabolic\nsyndrome (1). In response, the European\nGroup for the Study of Insulin Resistance\ncountered with a modification of the\ntional Cholesterol Education Program\n(NCEP) released its definition (3). Subse-\nquently, the American Association of\nClinical Endocrinologists offered its views\nregarding the definition of the metabolic\nsyndrome (4). The proliferation of defini-\ntions suggested that a single unifying def-\ninition was desirable (5). In the hope of\naccomplishing this, the International Di-\nabetes Federation (IDF) proposed a new\ndefinition of the metabolic syndrome in\nThe main focus in this new definition\nis central obesity. To have the metabolic\nsyndrome, a person must have central ad-\niposity defined on the basis of waist cir-\ncumference and two or more of the\nfollowing four factors: elevated concen-\ntrations of triglycerides, reduced concen-\ntrations of HDL cholesterol, elevated\nblood pressure, and dysglycemia.\nThis new definition requires a fresh\nassessment of the prevalence of the meta-\nbolic syndrome as well as of the magni-\ntude of the morbidity and mortality\nassociated with the metabolic syndrome.\nThe objectives of this article were 1) to\nestimate the prevalence of the metabolic\nsyndrome using the new IDF definition\namong U.S. adults, 2) to compare the\nprevalence of the metabolic syndrome\nwith that based on the NCEP definition,\nand 3) to examine the concordance of the\ntwo definitions.\nMETHODS -- In the National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey\nrecruited using a multistage, stratified\nsampling design. The survey was specifi-\ncally designed to produce results that are\nrepresentative of the civilian, noninstitu-\ntionalized U.S. population. The partici-\npants were interviewed at home and were\ninvited to attend the mobile examination\ncenter, where they were asked to com-\nplete additional questionnaires, to un-\ndergo various examinations, and to\nprovide a blood sample. Details about the\nsurvey may be found elsewhere (7).\nAccording to the IDF definition,\nsomeone has the metabolic syndrome if\nhe or she has central adiposity plus two or\nmore of the following four factors (6): 1)\nraised concentration of triglycerides:\ntreatment for this lipid abnormality; 2) re-\nduced concentration of HDL cholesterol:\nspecific treatment for this lipid abnormal-\nity; 3) raised blood pressure: systolic\nblood pressure 130 mmHg or diastolic\nblood pressure 85 mmHg or treatment\nof previously diagnosed hypertension;\nand 4) raised fasting plasma glucose con-\npreviously diagnosed type 2 diabetes.\nThe IDF lists the following ethnic\ngroup\u00adspecific thresholds for waist cir-\ncumference to define central adiposity:\nEuropid, sub-Saharan African men, and\nEastern- and Middle-Eastern men, 94\ncm; South Asian, Chinese, and ethnic\nSouth- and Central-American men, 90\ncm; Japanese men, 85 cm; women ex-\n                                                \nFrom the Division of Adult and Community Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and\nHealth Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Earl Ford, MD, MPH, Centers for Disease Control and\nThe findings and conclusions in this article are those of the authors and do not represent the views of the\nCenters of Disease Control and Prevention.\nAbbreviations: IDF, International Diabetes Federation; NCEP, National Cholesterol Education Program;\nNHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; WHO, World Health Organization.\nA table elsewhere in this issue shows conventional and Syste\n`me International (SI) units and conversion\nfactors for many substances.\n\u00a9 2005 by the American Diabetes Association.\nThe costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.

In this analysis,\nthe following thresholds for waist circum-\nference were used: white men, 94 cm;\nAfrican-American men, 94 cm; Mexi-\ncan-American men, 90 cm; white\nwomen, 80 cm; African-American\nwomen, 80 cm; and Mexican-American\nwomen, 80 cm. For participants whose\ndesignation was \"other race\u00adincluding\nmultiracial,\" thresholds that were once\nbased on Europid cut points (94 cm for\nmen and 80 cm for women) and once\nbased on South Asian cut points (90 cm\nfor men and 80 cm for women) were\nused. For participants who were consid-\nered \"other Hispanic,\" the IDF thresholds\nfor ethnic South and Central Americans\nwere used.\nAccording to the NCEP report, partic-\nipants who had three or more of the fol-\nlowing criteria were defined as having the\nmetabolic syndrome (3,8): 1) abdominal\nobesity (waist circumference 102 cm in\nmen and 88 cm in women), 2) concen-\nmmol/l), 3) concentration of HDL choles-\nor a diastolic blood pressure 85\nmg/dl (5.6 mmol/l). The participants\nwho currently reported using antihyperten-\nsive or antidiabetic medication (insulin or\noral agents) were counted as having high\nblood pressure or diabetes, respectively.\nThe waist circumference was mea-\nsured at the high point of the iliac crest at\nminimal respiration to the nearest 0.1 cm.\nSerum triglyceride concentration was\nmeasured enzymatically after hydrolyza-\ntion to glycerol, and HDL cholesterol was\nmeasured after the precipitation of other\nlipoproteins with a heparin-manganese\nchloride mixture. Plasma glucose concen-\ntration was measured using an enzymatic\nreaction.\nUp to four blood pressure readings\nwere obtained in the mobile examination\ncenter. The average of the last two mea-\nsurements of blood pressure for the par-\nticipants who had three or four\nmeasurements, the last measurement for\nthe participants with only two measure-\nments, and the only measurement for the\nparticipants who had one measurement\nwere used to establish high blood pres-\nsure status.\nThe prevalence of the metabolic syn-\ndrome was examined according to strata\nof BMI, degree of glucose impairment, hy-\npertension, smoking status, hypercholes-\nterolemia, concentrations of C-reactive\nprotein, and coronary heart disease sta-\ntus. BMI was calculated from measured\nheight and weight. Four categories of\nglucose impairment were created: normo-\nglycemia (fasting plasma glucose concen-\ntration 100 mg/dl), impaired fasting\nglucose (fasting plasma glucose concen-\ndiabetes (fasting plasma glucose concen-\ntration 126 mg/dl without self-reported\ndiabetes), and diagnosed diabetes (based\non self-report). Hypertension was defined\nas a systolic blood pressure 140 mmHg\nor a diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg\nor the current use of antihypertensive\nmedication. Current smokers were de-\nfined as participants who had smoked\n100 cigarettes during their lifetime and\nwere still smoking. Former smokers were\ndefined as participants who had smoked\n100 cigarettes during their lifetime but\nhad stopped. Participants who had\nsmoked 100 cigarettes during their life-\ntime were classified as never having\nsmoked. Participants whose concentra-\ntion of total cholesterol was 200 mg/dl\nor who reported currently using choles-\nterol-lowering medications were defined\nas having hypercholesterolemia. C-reac-\ntive protein was measured by a high-\nsensitivity assay (latex-enhanced\nnephelometry). Questions about doctor-\ndiagnosed coronary heart disease, myo-\ncardial infarction, and angina pectoris\nwere used to determine the presence of\nthese conditions.\nConcentrations of plasma glucose\nand serum triglycerides were measured\nusing reference analytic methods only for\nthe participants who attended the morn-\ning examination. Therefore, the analyses\nwere limited to men and nonpregnant\nwomen aged 20 years who attended the\nmorning medical examination and who\nhad fasted for 8 h. Because of limited\nsample size for the racial or ethnic groups\ndesignated as \"other race\u00adincluding mul-\ntiracial\" and \"other Hispanic,\" no results\nwere reported separately for these sub-\ngroups. To age adjust statistics, direct ad-\njustment to the U.S. population aged 20\nSUDAAN (Software for the Statistical\nAnalysis of Correlated Data) was used for\nthe analyses to account for the complex\nsampling design.\npants attended the morning mobile exam-\nination center.

The largest difference\nin prevalence was found among Mexican-\nAmerican men, among whom the age-\nadjusted prevalence was 40.3% using the\nNCEP definition and 50.6% using the IDF\ndefinition. When the IDF criteria for waist\ncircumference are used with the NCEP\ndefinition, the unadjusted prevalence of\nthe metabolic syndrome was 40.3%,\nwhich was similar to the estimate pro-\nduced by the IDF definition. Using NCEP\ncriteria for waist circumference in con-\njunction with the IDF definition yielded\nan unadjusted prevalence of 29.4% (Ta-\nThe two definitions identified 92.9%\neither having or not having the metabolic\nsyndrome.

In addition, participants\nwith hypercholesterolemia had a higher\nprevalence of the metabolic syndrome\nthan participants who had concentrations\nof total cholesterol 200 mg/dl (P \n0.005 for both of the definitions). How-\never, the prevalence of the metabolic syn-\ndrome did not vary by smoking status (P\nfor all comparisons  0.05 for both of the\ndefinitions). In addition, the participants\nwho reported having coronary heart dis-\nease had more than twice the age-adjusted\nprevalence as did those who did not re-\nport having coronary heart disease (P \n0.001 for both definitions). However, the\nparticipants who had experienced a myo-\ncardial infarction had a similar prevalence\nof the metabolic syndrome as participants\nwho had not had a myocardial infarction\n(P  0.05 for both definitions). The par-\nticipants who reported having angina\npectoris were also more likely to report\nhaving the metabolic syndrome than the\nparticipants who did not have it (P \nCONCLUSIONS -- With the most\nrecent national data from U.S. adults and\nthe definition of the metabolic syndrome\nproposed by the IDF, almost 40% of U.S.\nadults were classified as having the meta-\nbolic syndrome, a prevalence that is\nhigher than that estimated by the NCEP\ndefinition (34.5%). The IDF criteria for\ndefining central obesity appeared to ac-\ncount for much of this difference. The\nchange was larger among men than\namong women and can be explained by\nthe fact that the NCEP thresholds for\nwaist circumference of 102 cm for men\nand 88 cm for women reflect much differ-\nent percentiles of the distribution among\nU.S. adults than the IDF thresholds of 90\nThe use of thresholds for waist circumfer-\nence that are specific to different popula-\ntions around the globe has been\nthe differences in estimates of prevalence\nwere especially pronounced for Mexican\nAmericans, the application of the IDF def-\ninition to estimate the prevalence of the\nmetabolic syndrome will probably have a\nsubstantial effect on the estimates in Asian\nand Latin American countries. In general,\nthe sociodemographic patterns in preva-\nlence were similar for the two definitions.\nThe two definitions similarly classi-\nfied 93% of the participants as having or\nnot having the metabolic syndrome. The\nhigh degree of overlap is not surprising\nconsidering the fact that the two defini-\ntions use the same five components and\nthat four of the five criteria are defined\nidentically or nearly identically. However,\nthere are several noteworthy differences.\nThe IDF definition requires the presence\nof central obesity. In contrast, the NCEP\ndefinition makes central obesity one of\nthe five equally weighted criteria. Fur-\nthermore, the thresholds for central obe-\nsity under the IDF definition are far lower\nthan those under the NCEP definition and\nvary according to ethnicity. The thresh-\nolds for concentrations of triglycerides,\nHDL cholesterol, and glucose and for sys-\ntolic and diastolic blood pressure are the\nsame. However, the IDF definition explic-\nitly allows for the treatment of hypertri-\nglyceridemia, a low concentration of HDL\ncholesterol, and hypertension to be\ncounted. Furthermore, under the IDF\ndefinition people who have diagnosed\ntype 2 diabetes are automatically consid-\nered to have hyperglycemia even if their\nconcentration of glucose is 100 mg/dl.\nOnly three major ethnic groups in the\ncient numbers to allow for results to be\npresented separately.

Although the Eu-\nropid waist circumference thresholds\nwere used for this ethnic group to gener-\nate the results shown in this article, the\nunadjusted prevalence estimate changed\nfor men and 80 cm for women were used.\nOnly time will tell whether medical\nprofessionals and researchers will em-\nbrace this new definition of the metabolic\nsyndrome. Prospective studies will be\nneeded to determine the risks for adverse\nevents associated with the metabolic syn-\ndrome as defined by the IDF. Because of\nthe similarities between the NCEP and\nIDF definitions, risk estimates for all-\ncause mortality, cardiovascular disease,\ndiabetes, and other adverse events based\non the IDF definition are likely to be sim-\nilar to those observed for the NCEP defi-\nnition. The evolution of definitions of the\nthat the future will probably bring further\nchanges. In addition, the development of\na classification scheme of the metabolic\nsyndrome that correlates with the degree\nof risk of experiencing adverse events and\nthe development of a formal pediatric def-\ninition merit consideration. Regardless of\nwhich definition is used, large numbers of\nU.S. adults have the metabolic syndrome.\nThis fact underscores the importance of\npromoting healthy lifestyles (proper nu-\ntrition, weight management, and ade-\nquate physical activity) among U.S. adults.\nReferences\n1.
