However, the findings\nhave been inconsistent. The present meta-\nanalysis was designed to give a more precise\nestimation of the strength of this\nassociation.\nMaterials and methods\nIdentification of studies\nThis meta-analysis followed the preferred\nreporting items for systematic reviews and\nmeta-analyses (PRISMA) criteria.6 Eligible\nwere identified by searching the electronic\nliterature databases PubMed\u00d5, Embase\u00d5,\nWeb of Science, CBMdisc and CNKI.\nThe following keywords and search strate-\ngies were used: (``interleukin-10'' OR ``IL-\n10'') AND (``polymorphism'' OR ``muta-\ntion'' OR ``variant'' OR ``genotype'') AND\n(``cervical cancer'' OR ``cervical intraepithe-\nlial neoplasia'' OR ``CIN''). In addition,\nreference lists of reviews or original articles\nanalysing the association between IL-10\ngene \u00c01082 G/A polymorphism and cervical\ncancer and/or CIN were also searched, to\nidentify additional relevant articles. No lan-\nguage restrictions were set in this meta-\nanalysis.\nInclusion criteria\nTo be included, studies had to meet all of the\nfollowing criteria: (i) human studies;\n(ii) studies on the relationships between IL-\nvical cancer and/or CIN; (iii) unrelated case\u00ad\ncontrol studies; (iv) genotype frequency\ndetails provided; (v) not republished data.\nData extraction\nData were extracted from eligible studies by\ntwo authors (S. Z. and Y.W.Y.) independ-\nently in duplicate, using a standard data\ncollection form. The results were reviewed\nby a third author (Y-L.K.). The following\ninformation was collected from each study:\nlast name of the first author; publication\nyear; ethnicities and countries of partici-\npants; source of controls; number of cases\nand controls; genotype and allele data; the\nresult of Hardy\u00adWeinberg equilibrium\n(HWE) testing in the control group\n(P < 0.05 was considered to be a significant\ndeviation from the HWE).\nMeta-analysis\nThe strength of associations between IL-10\ngene \u00c01082 G/A polymorphism and cervical\ncancer and/or CIN were measured using\nodds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence\nintervals (CIs). Pooled ORs were combined\nfor the allelic model (A allele versus G\nallele), the additive model (A/A versus G/\nG), the recessive model (A/A versus\nG/A\u00feG/G) and the dominant model (A/\nA\u00feG/A versus G/G). Between-study het-\nerogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q\nstatistic and the I2 statistic, with a\nPheterogeneity\nthe existence of heterogeneity.7,8 If\nbetween-study heterogeneity existed, the\nrandom-effects model was used to calculate\nthe pooled ORs; otherwise the fixed-effects\nSubgroup analysis was performed, based\non ethnicity. In addition, sensitivity analysis\nwas conducted to confirm the reliability of\ncombined analyses (based on studies show-\ning HWE only). Publication bias was\nassessed using Begg's funnel plot and\nEgger's regression test (P < 0.05 was con-\nsidered to be representative of statistically\nsignificant publication bias).11 All statistical\nanalyses were performed using STATA\u00d5\nsoftware version 11.0 (StataCorp LP,\nCollege Station, TX, USA).\nResults\nCharacteristics of eligible studies\nThe study selection process is shown in\nFigure 1. In total, eight articles containing\nidentified that met the inclusion criteria.12\u00ad19\nThree studies were performed in Europeans,\nfour in Asians, and one in Africans.\nSubgroup analysis based on ethnicity was\nperformed for Asians and non-Asians.

Significant\nheterogeneity existed in the allelic model\n(Pheterogeneity\ninant model (Pheterogeneity\nI2 \u00bc 76.6%); therefore, the random-effects\nmodel was used to synthesize these data. No\nheterogeneity was found in the additive\nmodel (Pheterogeneity\nrecessive model (Pheterogeneity\nI2 \u00bc 0%), so the fixed-effects model was\nused to analyse these data. Overall, there\nwere no significant associations between\ncervical cancer and/or CIN in any of the\ngenetic models (Table 2). When analysed by\nethnicity, there were again no significant\npolymorphism and cervical cancer and/or\nCIN in either Asians or non-Asians\n(Table 2).\nSensitivity analysis\nSensitivity analysis was performed to evalu-\nate the stability of the overall results. When\nthe study of Yu et al.,17 which was the only\nstudy that did not meet the HWE, was\nexcluded, the corresponding pooled ORs\nwere not materially altered in any of the\ngenetic models (Table 2), suggesting that the\nresults of the meta-analysis were stable and\nthat the study without HWE was not\ninfluencing the overall results.\nPublication bias\nThere was no evidence of publication bias\nusing Begg's funnel plots (Figure 3). In\naddition, there was no statistical evidence\nof publication bias among studies using\nEgger's regression test (P ! 0.05 for all four\ngenetic models).\nDiscussion\nThe associations between IL-10 gene\ncancer and/or CIN have been intensively\nstudied, but the results have been inconsist-\nfound that, compared with the IL-10 A\nallele, the IL-10 G allele was associated\nwith a significantly higher risk for develop-\ning cervical cancer in Zimbabwean popula-\nresported that the IL-10 G allele was asso-\nciated with a higher cervical cancer risk in\nJapanese populations compared with the\nZoodsma et al.,19 Farzaneh et al.,12 Wang\nmorphism was not associated with cervical\ncancer or CIN in Korean, Dutch, British,\nChinese and Argentinean populations,\nrespectively.

Because the inclusion\nof studies without HWE might influence the\nresults of the meta-analysis,20 a sensitivity\nanalysis restricted to the studies with HWE\nTable 1.

Similar results to those of\nthe full meta-analysis were found. Thus, the\nresults of subgroup and sensitivity analyses\nfurther strengthened the finding that IL-10\ngene polymorphism is not associated with\ncervical cancer and/or CIN.\nSignificant between-study heterogeneity\nexisted in the allelic and dominant models.\nHeterogeneity is a potential problem that\nmay affect the interpretation of the results. It\nhas a wide range of potential sources, such\nas case definition and sampling, sample\nsizes, methods of genotyping, and differ-\nences in ethnicity. The subgroup and sensi-\ntivity analyses performed were unable to\nidentify the sources of heterogeneity.\nFurther analyses were not performed due\nto the lack of original data. Therefore, all\nthe potential reasons for heterogeneity\nshould still be taken into account.\nPublication bias did not exist in the overall\ncomparisons, indicating that the results of\nthe present meta-analysis were statistically\nrobust. However, certain limitations of this\nwork should be acknowledged. First, the\nsample size in most of the included studies\nwas small, which could increase the prob-\nability of false positives or false negatives.\nSecondly, significant between-study hetero-\ngeneity existed in the allelic and dominant\nmodels, indicating that the findings should be\ninterpreted with care. Thirdly, cervical\ncancer and CIN are complex diseases that\ncan be affected by a number of factors such as\nHPV infection, HPV subtype, infectious\nstate, the balance of pro- and anti-inflamma-\ntory cytokines, and other conditions that\ninfluence cytokine levels. However, many of\nthe eligible studies included in this meta-\nanalysis did not present sufficient original\nFigure 3.

In addition, meta-\nanalyses have some inherent limitations in\nthat their retrospective nature, meaning that\nthey are subject to the methodological defi-\nciencies of the included studies.\nDespite these limitations, the present\nmeta-analysis had some strengths. First,\nthe process of meta-analysis has the ability\nto detect small effects in human genetic\nassociation studies.21 In the present study,\ndata were extracted from as many different\nstudies as possible, which increased the\nstatistical power of this analysis. Secondly,\nthe corresponding pooled ORs were not\nmaterially altered in any of the genetic\nmodels when subgroup and sensitivity ana-\nlyses were performed, and no publication\nbias was found, indicating that the results of\nthis meta-analysis were stable and reliable.\nIn conclusion, findings of the present\nstudy suggest that there is no association\nism and cervical cancer and/or CIN.\nHowever, this result should be interpreted\nwith caution because of the limitations of\nthis meta-analysis. Further studies with\nlarger sample sizes, especially multicentric\ncase\u00adcontrol studies, will be needed to con-\nfirm these findings.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
