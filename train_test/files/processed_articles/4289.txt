Several lines of evidence point toward multiple competition stages through\nthe visual pathway involving eye-dependent and eye-independent mechanisms (Blake & Logothetis,\nnisms is still debated.\nAttention modulates rivalry dynamics (e.g., Dieter & Tadin, 2011; Paffen & Alais, 2011), and\nrecent evidence suggests that it might play an important role in allowing competition to take place\n(Brascamp & Blake, 2012). The effect of selective attention on binocular rivalry is commonly evi-\ndenced by enhancing the relative predominance of the attended stimulus (Chong, Tadin, & Blake,\n2005; Meng & Tong, 2004), although some studies have also reported a decrease in predominance of\nthe unattended stimulus (e.g., Hancock & Andrews, 2007). Attention modulation is likely to depend on\nstimulus complexity (Alais, van Boxtel, Parker, & van Ee, 2010) and to increase with ascending visual\nIn 1996, Logothetis and coworkers reported an influential study in which observers were pre-\nsented rival visual stimuli that switched between eyes at a regular and fast rate of 3 Hz (i.e., every\n333 ms). Under this \"swapping\" paradigm, the observers experienced either perceptual periods of\nswapping, aligned with the effective stimulation of each eye, or, more surprisingly, perceptual sta-\nbility or dominance with durations extending beyond 333 ms (Logothetis, Leopold, & Sheinberg,\n1996). The remarkably slow changes in image dominance, occurring when rival flickering stimuli are\nswapped between each eye, refer to the so-called stimulus rivalry. Although restricted to some spatial\na Pion publication\nAttention modulation of stimulus rivalry under\nswapping paradigm\n*Corresponding author.\n148 Doualot A, Simard M, Saint-Amour D\nand temporal frequencies (Lee & Blake, 1999), these slow changes show similar characteristics with\nexclusive image alternations, as found in conventional binocular rivalry (Logothetis et al., 1996).\nMore specifically, they exhibit similar unimodal, asymmetric distribution of relative phase durations\nwith a fast growth and long tail gamma distribution fitting. Furthermore, similar changes in mean\nduration dominance are observed when the strength of one of the rival stimuli is manipulated. Stimu-\nlus rivalry is thought to be solved at eye-independent levels (Freeman, 2005; Leopold, & Logothetis,\nIn the current study, we tested the hypothesis that attention increases image predominance during\nstimulus rivalry under a swapping paradigm, and that attention modulation varies as a function of the\nspatial characteristics of the stimuli. To this end, we used, similarly to Bonneh, Sagi, and Karni (2001),\ntwo different sizes of stimuli that may determine the level of processing at which rivalry occurs: Large\northogonal gratings designed to elicit the receptive fields of extrastriate areas, and small orthogonal\ngratings to preferentially involve early visual processing (see Methods for details).\nCatch trials in attention conditions were first analyzed to detect subjects with potential response bias.\nSignificant differences (p  .05) between leftward and rightward ratios (perceived-time divided by\ndisplayed-time, see Methods for details) were found for three participants, which were therefore ex-\ncluded from the analysis. In accordance with Bonneh et al. (2001), stimulus size resulted in distinct\npatterns of perception: Large stimuli generated significantly longer periods of stability (leftward and\nrightward dominances together) than swapping, whereas the opposite pattern was found for small\nstimuli (Figure 1).\nVery similar patterns were found between passive and attention conditions. The following\nrepeated-measure ANOVA was conducted: Session (passive or attention)  Size (1.4\u00b0 or 10\u00b0)  Per-\ncept (stability or swapping). Results revealed a significant Size  Percept interaction, F(1,8) 5 37.71,\nods, which corresponded to about half of the total cumulative time, did not differ between the passive\nand attention conditions. Although no significant interaction between attention and stimulus size was\nnot found, it is noteworthy that the attention effect tended to be higher for large stimuli (Figure 2B).\nIndeed, the cumulative time between leftward and rightward percepts was larger for large (M 5 8.9,\np 5 .08) was likely due to the more unstable and variable percepts evoked by the small stimuli.\nTo assess the effect of attention on the stimulus-cumulated dominance time, the following repeated-\nmeasure ANOVA was conducted: Session (passive or attention)  Size (1.4\u00b0 or 10\u00b0)  Percept (left-\nward or rightward) (Figure 2). A significant Session  Percept interaction was found (F(1,8) 5 20.02,\nFigure 1.

This pattern was the same regardless of the stimulus size.\nFigure 3 illustrates the distribution of the mean normalized duration in the passive and attention\nconditions. The gamma function fittings in the attention conditions have a lower peak and broader\nupper tail than those in the passive condition. The Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov Test revealed that the dis-\ntributions of the attended stimulus differed significantly between the passive and the attention condi-\ndifference was found for the unattended stimulus between the passive and the attention conditions,\n3 Discussion\nIn agreement with the results of Bonneh et al. (2001), we found different patterns of percept as a\nfunction of the stimulus size in the passive viewing condition. The same pattern was present under\nthe endogenous attention condition, so that attending to one stimulus did not change the swapping\nduration or the stability as a whole. However, attention modulated the slow changes (stability periods)\nduring stimulus rivalry by increasing the cumulated perceived time and mean dominance duration of\nthe attended stimulus compared to the unattended one. This attention effect was not dependent on the\nsize of the stimulus.\nChanges in effective stimulus contrast have been suggested to account for attention control of\nrivalry (see Paffen & Alais, 2011 for review). In accordance with Levelt's (1968) second law, increas-\ning the contrast of one rival stimulus decreases dominance durations of the other stimulus. While\nHancock and Andrews (2007) reported a decrease in the dominance duration of the unattended stimu-\nlus, other reports (e.g., Chong, Tadin, & Blake, 2005) found the opposite effect, i.e., an increase in\nthe predominance of the attended stimulus with no significant change to the unattended stimulus. The\nlatter type of effect was found in the current study.\nWilson (2003) proposed that eye-independent competitive mechanisms are recruited during stim-\nulus rivalry because the stimulus flickering used in the swapping paradigm defeats the eye-dependent\nFigure 2.

Such an eye-independent feature of stimulus rivalry is thought to rely on high-\nlevel processing involving extrastriate areas (e.g., Bonneh et al., 2001; Freeman, 2005), in which the\nstrength of the visual competition processing is likely to be higher (Desimone & Ducan, 1995; Dieter\n& Tadin, 2011). Interestingly, previous reports have shown an increase of attention modulation in\ndisentangling and prioritizing alternative percepts while ascending the hierarchy of visual processing\n(Alais et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2007).Although no significant interaction between attention and stimulus\nsize was found in the current study, it is noteworthy that the attention effect tended to be higher for\nlarge stimuli (Figure 2B), which preferentially solicit extrastriate processing.\nRecently, Brascamp, Sohn, Lee, and Blake (2013) challenged the notion that stimulus rivalry\nresides at an eye-independent level. Without totally precluding binocular contribution, they proposed\na model in which the slow changes in image dominance during stimulus rivalry could be explained by\ncompetition at eye-dependent (monocular) level. The model proposes two main types of orientation-\ntuned inhibition: Inhibition between pools of neurons coding for different eyes but the same orienta-\ntion, and inhibition between pools of neurons coding for the same eyes but the opposite orientation.\nBoth are characterized by different strengths and scale decays that can be unbalanced by stimuli flick-\nering. Such a stimulus-flickering imbalance tends to favor changes in ocular dominance, resulting in\nperception of stability periods. In this framework, stimulus rivalry and swapping rely on the same\nunderlying mechanisms in early visual cortex, but with varying strength.\nIf attention can affect stimulus rivalry, one could predict, according to Brascamp et al. model\n(2013), an attention modulation on the swapping percept as well, either directly or indirectly through\nchanges of ambiguity; this was not observed here. One may argue, however, that swapping peri-\nods cannot be influenced by attention since there is no stable stimulus to attend to when the images\nalternate at 3 Hz. Although this is indeed a major challenge for attention modulation, it has been\nreported that even an unaware stimulus can be influenced by attention (e.g., Hancock and Andrews,\n2007; Kaunitz, Fracasso, & Melcher, 2011). Therefore, our findings invite future research with other\ndesigns to better assess attention modulation in stimulus rivalry as a function of eye-independent and\neye-dependent processing.\nFigure 3.

(1996), circular orthogonal gratings (\u00b145\u00b0), flickering at 15 Hz,\nwere swapped between eyes at 3 Hz. To favor the occurrence of exclusive stimulus rivalry, stimuli,\ndisplayed on a grey background (60 cd/m2), were colored in red in one eye and in green in the other.\nEquiluminance was ensured by heterochromatic flicker photometry. Color and orientation were coun-\nterbalanced between eyes. Stimulus size was either 1.4\u00b0 or 10\u00b0 in diameter with spatial frequencies\nof 5.7 or 0.8 cycles/degree, respectively, to keep the duty cycle constant. Stimuli were created with\nPsykinematixTM and presented through OLED stereoscopic goggles (eMagin Z800, Bellevue, WA).\nDioptic catch trials mimicking the time course of binocular rivalry were used in order to control/\ncorrect understanding of the task and potential response bias induced by attention instructions. They\nwere randomized with experimental rivalry trials. On average, perceptual-dominance durations varied\naccording to the stimulus size from 1.6 to 3 s, whereas swapping periods ranged from 10 to 35 s for\nlarge and small stimuli, respectively. There were two catch trials in the passive viewing condition\n(one per type of stimulus) and four catch trials in the attention condition (two per type of stimulus).\nTo assess the performance for each participant in the catch trials, we calculated the ratios between the\nperceived time and the physically displayed time for both leftward and rightward stability periods.\nA paired t-test between leftward and rightward duration in the attention condition was conducted for\neach participant.\nAfter 3 min of training, participants started the experiment, consisting of 30 trials of 60 s each\nsplit in two sessions. The first session was a passive viewing condition followed by a pause of 10 min.\nIn the second session, observers were instructed to pay attention to the rightward stimulus (+45\u00b0)\nand, once perceived, to try to maintain the percept as long as possible. The cumulative time and the\nmean normalized duration (in s) were used as dependent variables in the ANOVA analyses. For each\nobserver, normalized dominance durations were calculated by dividing the duration of each reported\npercept (leftward or rightward) by the mean dominance duration (all stability percepts in all viewing\nconditions) for that observer. Gamma distribution fitting was applied to the data using mean-normal-\nized dominance durations in accordance with the literature. All the statistical analyses were performed\nusing SPSS 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois).\n"
