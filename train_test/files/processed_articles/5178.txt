Many different health issues have\nbeen considered such as hypertension and asthma, yet few\nstudies have looked at the specific associations between\npsychological factors and eye conditions. This study set out\nto explore the psychological, biomedical and socio-demo-\ngraphic factors in childhood and adulthood associated with\nself-reported eye conditions in adulthood using a large birth\ncohort in the United Kingdom.\nPersonality factors are related to health beliefs and\nbehaviours which have long-term consequences, yet com-\nparatively few studies have examined personality corre-\nlates of eye problems. It is possible that personality\nvariables lead to behaviours that may influence the cause of\neye problems, but also that eye problems could have a\ndirect effect on personality. Thus, for instance, those who\nare prone to adventurousness and risk-taking may be more\nlikely to incur eye (and other) injuries which may in turn\nreduce their risk-taking behaviours. In order to explore\nthese relationships, it is therefore necessary to conduct lon-\ngitudinal studies, not just cross-sectional research.\nHowever, most of the results have been limited in terms of\nsample and personality measures.\nPerhaps the first study in the area of personality and\nperception done almost 70\nyears ago was by Hibbeler\n(1947) who was interested in helping glaucoma patients\ndeal with their affliction. He compared the personality of\n27 glaucoma patients with a control group on a\nPersonality traits neuroticism and\nopenness as well as early abnormal\neye conditions as predictors of the\noccurrence of eye problems in adulthood\n Keywords\nearly eye conditions, eye conditions in adulthood, personality traits, longitudinal\n1University College London, UK\n2University of London, UK\n3BI Norwegian Business School, Norway\nCorresponding author:\nAdrian Furnham, Research Department of Clinical, Educational and\nHealth Psychology, University College London, London WC1E 6BT, UK.\nEmail: a.furnham@ucl.ac.uk\nReport of empirical study\n2 Health Psychology Open \nwell-known questionnaire of that period (Minnesota\nMultiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)) (Schiele\netal., 1943). He found evidence that the male patients\ntended to be high on depression and hysteria and the\nwomen on paranoia. Later Warrian etal. (2009) looked at\npersonality factors in 148 patients with glaucoma or ocu-\nlar hypertension using a new validated personality test\n(NEO PI-R) (Costa and McCrae, 1992). They found that\nthe visual function questionnaire score of these patients\nwas related to their Neuroticism, Extraversion and\nConscientiousness. They argued that personality factors\ndetermine both how patients attach value to the treat-\nments they receive and how they report the effects of\ntreatment.\nCooke etal. (2003) compared keratoconic and myopic\npatients in terms of their personality, finding that myopes\nscored higher than keratoconics only on the Psychoticism\nscale, measuring tough-mindedness. However, the effect\nwas small and became non-significant when corrected with\nBonferroni procedure. In the same year, Spahn etal. (2003)\nlooked at the personality profile of 24 patients with central\nserous chorioretinopathy. They found that the patients had\nelevated scores with regard to emotional instability (i.e.\nneuroticism) and insecure but also spontaneous and flexible\ncompared to population norms. They recommended a lon-\ngitudinal study with a bigger sample to understand the role\nof personality in this condition.\nGiedd etal. (2005) aimed to define the personality pro-\nfile of keratoconus patients with the Millon Behavioural\nHealth Inventory (MBHI) (Sweet etal., 1985). Keratoconus\nis a corneal disease that manifests itself in young adult-\nhood and decreases vision. The findings show that kerato-\nconus patients scored lower than the normative population\non the respectful coping style scale, suggesting that they\ncould be less respectful towards practitioners, uncoopera-\ntive and noncompliant with treatment plans. However,\ntheir scores were not associated with a history of penetrat-\ning keratoplasty or their rating of the effect of keratoconus\non their lives.\nWoods etal. (2008) assessed whether tolerance to diop-\ntric spherical defocus is related to measures of personality\nusing NEO PI-R and the CaliforniaAdult Q-sort, finding that\ntwo perfectionism scales were significantly correlated with\nblur tolerance. Two clusters, `low self confidence' and `dis-\norganisation', were positively related to blur tolerance. The\nfindings show that people who lack self-confidence may\nneed stronger evidence of blur before they have visual symp-\ntoms, while disorganised people may have better tolerance to\nblur because it is simply another manifestation of their untidy\npersonal environments. This finding was replicated by the\nsame authors and they argue that psychologically high-func-\ntioning (adjusted) people do not tolerate blur well, whereas\nlow-functioning people may tolerate blur to their detriment\nbecause they lack the psychological resources to positively\nchange their environments (Woods etal., 2010).\nNa etal. (2015) looked at correlates of women suffer-\ning with dry eye disease. Controlling for age, lifestyle and\nmedical factors, they found patients were much more\nlikely to have experienced severe psychological distress,\ndepressive moods, anxiety problems and a history of psy-\nchological counselling though the study was unable to\nexamine whether these were causes or consequences of\nthe problems.\nIn a recent cross-sectional study, Ichinohe etal. (2016)\nexamined the associations between symptoms of dry eye\ndisease and personality traits in a clinical sample (n=56)\nusing a Japanese version of the Big Five Personality\nInventory based on the NEO Personality Inventory (Costa\nand McCrae, 1985). They found that among the Big Five\npersonality factors, only neuroticism showed a significant\ncorrelation to the Dry Eye\u00adRelated Quality-of-Life Score\n0.01) and Ocular Surface Disease Index\nConscientiousness has been found to be associated with\nvarious health outcomes. In a meta-analysis, Bogg and\nfound that conscientiousness-related traits were negatively\nrelated to all risky health-related behaviours and positively\nrelated to all beneficial health-related behaviours. Similar\nfindings were reviewed in Friedman and Kern (2014) study.\nSome studies demonstrated the negative associations\nbetween intelligence and a number of health outcomes,\nfor example, between childhood cognitive function and\nType 2 Diabetes (Olsson etal., 2008) and between child-\nhood intelligence and mortality (Batty et\nHowever, intelligence has also been found to be positively\nassociated with excessive alcohol intake (Kanazawa and\nHellberg, 2010). Previous studies have also established\nthe link between socioeconomic conditions and health\nfar fewer studies on the relationship between intelligence\nand demography on eye problems.\nHypotheses\nThis study has two strengths compared with many previ-\nous studies in the area. First, it used a large prospective\nbirth cohort. Second, it looked at two main aspects of\nindividual difference (personality and intelligence) and\ntheir associations with the health outcome in question.\nBased on the previous findings, it is hypothesised that\n(H1) abnormal eye conditions before puberty diagnosed\nby medical professionals would be significantly associ-\nated with self-reported eye conditions in adulthood; (H2)\nemotional stability would be significantly associated with\nthe eye disorders in adulthood; (H3) conscientiousness\nwould be significantly associated with the outcome vari-\nable; (H4) early eye impairment, traits emotional stability\nand conscientiousness would be independent predictors of\nthe occurrence of eye conditions in adulthood.\nCheng and Furnham 3\nMethod\nSample\nThe National Child Development Study 1958 is a large-\nscale longitudinal study of the 17,415 individuals who were\nborn in Great Britain in a week of March 1958 (Ferri etal.,\n2003). The following analysis is based on data collected\nwhen the study participants were at birth and at ages 11, 16,\nparental social class, gestational age and birth weight. At\nage 11years, children completed cognitive ability tests. At\nyears, mothers provided information on whether\ncohort members ever had eye conditions by the age of 16\nyears. At age 33years, cohort members provided informa-\ntion on educational qualifications obtained. At age 50years,\nparticipants completed a questionnaire on personality traits.\nParticipants also provided information on their current\noccupation and whether they were having eye conditions at\nyears. The analytic sample comprises 5706 cohort\nmembers (50.3% females) with complete data. Analysis of\nresponse bias in the cohort data showed that the achieved\nadult samples did not differ from their target sample across\na number of critical variables (social class, parental educa-\ntion and gender), despite a slight under-representation of\nthe most disadvantaged groups (Plewis etal., 2004).\nMeasures\nChildhood measures: parental social class at birth was meas-\nured by the Registrar General's measure of social class\n(RGSC). RGSC is defined according to occupational status\nand the associated education, prestige or lifestyle (Marsh,\n1986) and is assessed by the current or last held job. When the\nfather was absent, the social class (RGSC) of the mother was\nused. RGSC was coded on a six-point scale from unskilled to\nprofessional occupations (Leete and Fox, 1977). At birth,\nmothers were interviewed and provided information on gesta-\ntional age and birth weight. Childhood cognitive ability tests\n(Douglas, 1964) were accessed when cohort members were at\nyears consisting of 40 verbal and 40 non-verbal items\nand were administered at school. At age 16\nyears, mothers\nwere interviewed and provided information on whether cohort\nmembers ever suffered from abnormal eye conditions diag-\nnosed by medical professionals. Adulthood measures: at age\n33, participants were asked about their highest academic or\nvocational qualifications. Responses are coded to the six-point\nscale of National Vocational Qualifications levels (NVQ)\nwhich ranges from `none'to `university degree/higher'/equiv-\nalent NVQ 5 or 6. Personality traits were assessed by the 50\nquestions from the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP)\n(Goldberg, 1999). Responses (five-point, from `Strongly\nAgree' to `Strongly Disagree') are summed to provide scores\nonthe`BigFive'personalitytraits:Extraversion,Emotionality/\nNeuroticism, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness and Intellect/\nyears, participants provided information\non their current or last occupation levels coded according to\nthe Registrar General's Classification of social class (RGSC),\ndescribed above, using a six-point classification described\nyears, participants provided information on\nwhether they were having eye conditions (other than wearing\nglasses or contacts such as age-related macular degeneration/\nvisual disturbances/glaucoma/cataracts) since previous inter-\nview five years ago with Yes/No response. In addition, 7.4per\ncent of the total cohort members who had eye conditions also\nanswered a question on eight specific eye problems: that they\nhad diabetes-associated eye disease (6.4%); glaucoma (9.8%);\ncataracts (13.3%); age-related macular degeneration (3.5%);\nvisual disturbances (1.4%); permanent loss of vision due to\ntrauma (1.6%); blindness or loss of vision (3.8%); and another\neye problem (58.7%). The response of general (non-specific)\neye conditions was used as the outcome variable.\nStatistical analyses\nTo investigate the set of psychological, biomedical and\nsocio-demographic factors associated with the occurrence\nof self-reported eye conditions in adulthood, first, the char-\nacteristics of the study population were examined; second,\ncorrelation analysis was conducted and all the variables\nused in the study were examined; third, logistic regression\nanalysis was conducted using STATA version 14, and the\nresponse of self-reported eye conditions in adulthood was\nthe dependent variable.\nResults\nDescriptive analysis\nTable 1 shows the characteristics of the study population\naccording to the occurrence of eye conditions at 54\nyears.\nThe rate of eye conditions appears to be slightly higher\namong managerial of professionals than other groups in\nparental social class but current professional occupation\ntended to report less such health outcome. There were also\ngender differences: females reported more than males on\neye conditions. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed\nthat the differences were statistically significant (F(1,\nCorrelational analysis\nThe correlation matrix is shown in Table 2, which shows\nthat eye impairment by the age of 16years and emotional\nstability were significantly associated with eye condi-\ntions in adulthood in the expected direction. Parental\nsocial class, childhood intelligence, agreeableness and\nopenness as well as sex were also significantly associated\nwith the outcome variable. Thus, hypotheses 1 and 2\nwere supported and hypothesis 3 was refuted, that there\nwas no significant association between conscientiousness\nand the outcome variable.\n4 Health Psychology Open \nRegression analysis\nTable 3 shows the results of logistic regression. The model\nshows that abnormal eye conditions before puberty and\ntraits emotional stability and openness as well as sex were\nsignificant and independent predictors of adult eye condi-\ntions. Thus, hypothesis 4 was partially supported, that early\neye impairment and trait emotional stability were inde-\npendent predictors of the occurrence of eye conditions in\nadulthood, but conscientiousness was not a significant pre-\ndictor of the outcome variable.\nDiscussion\nThis study looked at a set of psychological, biomedical and\nsocio-demographic factors associated with self-reported eye\nconditions in adulthood using a large birth cohort in the\nUnited Kingdom. The correlational results showed seven\nmodest correlates of eye conditions in adulthood: emotion-\nally less stable, being females, with higher scores on parental\nsocial class and intelligence and higher scores on agreeable-\nness and openness with eye impairment before puberty were\nmore likely to report eye problems at age 54years.\nThe results of the regression highlighted five factors: eye\nimpairment 38years earlier, gender, social class, emotional\nstability and openness. The fact that eye conditions at age\nyears were predictive of those 38\nyears later indicates\npossible genetic factors as well as issues with treatment. It is\nknown that many eye conditions are chronic, slowly deterio-\nrating over time even with treatment.\nThe association with social class may be due to various\npossible factors. Compared with unskilled manuals, cohort\nmembers who came from non-manual professional family\ntended to report more eye conditions in adulthood. It could\nbe that middle-class people are more health conscious,\nmore likely to have eye and other health check-ups and\nconsequently more aware of, and likely to report, their eye\nconditions. Equally it may be that middle-class jobs involv-\ning considerable reading and detailed visual processing tax\nthe eyes more and lead to more eye strains and problems.\nThe significant effects for sex and neuroticism on the out-\ncome variable may have different possible explanations. The\nsex differences in self-reported eye conditions might be, in\npart, explained by the positive associations between females\nand depression (Beck, 1979) and between neuroticism and\nsymptoms of anxiety and depression (Cheng and Furnham,\nbetween neuroticism and physical illness has been explained\nin terms of two factors. First is that neurotics over-report ill-\nness and are more prone to hypochondriasis. That is, while\nneurotics may have similar acute and chronic conditions com-\npared to non-neurotics, the former are significantly more\nTable 1.

Variables were scored such that a higher score indicated being female, the presence of eye conditions at teen and in adulthood, a more professional occupation for\nparents or cohort members, higher scores on childhood intelligence, highest educational qualification, higher scores on traits extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness and\nopenness. Associations between eye problems in adulthood and other variables are in bold.\n6 Health Psychology Open \nlikely to report the condition than the latter. Second, the anxi-\nety and depression which are at the heart of neuroticism lead to\na set of social and self-medication behaviours that are less\nadaptive and exacerbates the illness. Certainly, these confirm\nmany of the studies mentioned above which, though they used\ndifferent personality tests and were concerned with different\neye conditions, all showed that anxiety/depression/distress are\nassociated with eye conditions (Cooke etal., 2003; Hibbeler,\nThe hypothesised association between conscientiousness\nand eye conditions, however, was not confirmed, either from\nthe correlation analysis or regression analysis, which is not in\nline with previous findings which demonstrated the associa-\ntion between conscientiousness and a number of health out-\nFurthermore, it is not clear why openness marked by curiosity\nand imagination should be related to eye problems though it\ndoes confirm the findings of Spahn etal. (2003) study.\nLimitations\nThis study is based on available variables in the data set\nrather than being based on the study designed for the\npurpose; thus, variables included in the study do not\nhave a wide scope in investigating correlates of the\noutcome variable. For example, the outcome variable\nis vague without specific medically defined terms,\nthough it is not uncommon to use lay terms rather than\nprofessional ones in large population-based surveys.\nFurthermore, the outcome variable is self-report rather\nthan examined by medical professionals. However,\nresearch in self-reported heath has found to be linked to\nmortality (Heistaro etal., 2001; Kaplan and Camacho,\n1983). Also, personality traits were measured only once.\nOnly with repetitive measures accessed periodically\ncan the mechanisms and processes of these associations\nbe better understood. Therefore, future studies should\nbe conducted to confirm or refute the findings in\nthis study. Nevertheless, this study did highlight the\nimportance of studying personality factors in eye\ndisorders.\n"
