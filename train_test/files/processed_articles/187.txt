We examined the relation\nbetween survival and three types of activities separately:\nsocial, productive, and fitness. While several previous\nstudies provide tentative evidence for a link between\nsocial activities and mortality,7 8 no study has examined\nthe impact of social and productive activities on the risk\nof mortality among elderly people independent of\nphysical activities.\nThe exact mechanisms through which activity acts\non health and survival are not known, although several\nmechanisms have been suggested. Activity has been\nfound to be associated with more optimal lipid metabo-\nlism,9 high density lipoprotein concentrations,10 and glu-\ncose metabolism.11 It also seems that inactivity is\nassociated with a greater likelihood of behavioural risk\nfactors for cardiovascular disease, including obesity,\npoor diet, and smoking.12 Whether or not additional\npsychosocial mechanisms associated with the affiliated\naspects of activity also contribute to the survival\nadvantage enjoyed by more active people is not yet\nknown. Recent evidence suggests that psychosocial\nfactors may influence some of these physiological\nvariables, raising questions as to whether the benefits of\nactivity may operate through a wider range of\nmechanisms.13 14 Social activities have been previously\nshown to be associated with several risk factors for\ncardiovascular mortality including fibrinogen,15 blood\npressure,16 and presence of coronary heart disease.17\nThis study contributes to a growing body of research in\ngerontology that recognises the importance of social\nengagement and productive activity as essential features\nof successful ageing.18\nMethods\nParticipants\nParticipants for this study come from the New Haven\nsite of the established populations for epidemiological\nstudies of the elderly (EPESE). Data collection began in\nface interviews were conducted in participants' homes\nand 1990. All data were collected from participants by\ntrained lay interviewers who were blinded to study\nhypotheses.\nSampling\nAt baseline the cohort comprised 2812 men and\nwomen age 65 years and older living in the community.\nAll provided informed consent. The baseline response\ndata from the 1980 United States census the sample\nwas designed to be similar to the local population with\nrespect to age, sex, marital status, living arrangements,\nand race/ethnicity. Men and those living in housing for\nelderly people were oversampled to increase the\nsampling efficiency.

All analyses\npresented are corrected to take account of this\nsampling design. Further details of the sampling\ndesign have been described elsewhere.19\nMeasures\nThe outcome measure, death, was assessed by using\nseveral methods including daily review of newspapers\nand hospital admissions records and annual recontact\nwith all study participants or their next of kin and by\nusing the national death index. We were able to achieve\nnearly complete mortality surveillance on all partici-\npants regardless of whether they dropped out of the\nstudy. Vital status could not be confirmed in 27 partici-\npants (1%) who, because they were not found in the\nindex search, were assumed to be alive at the end of\nfollow up. The interview schedule was a 75 page struc-\ntured interview that took just over an hour to complete.\nVariables used in the analyses\nSociodemographics--Items on age (years at 1982\ninterview), marital status (married versus non-\nmarried), education (years of schooling completed),\nand race/ethnicity (white versus other) were included\nin the present analysis. Annual family income was cat-\negorised into two dichotomous variables for low\n(\u00a315 000)) serving as the reference group. To retain\nsubjects who refused to report income (13%) a\nseparate dichotomous variable was created for missing\nvalues.\nSocial, productive, and fitness activities--Information\non the extent of engagement in three types of activities,\nour primary independent variables, was ascertained\nduring a structured interview at home in 1982. In the\ncurrent study, only baseline assessments of activity\nwere used. Subjects were asked about the frequency of\nperformance of 14 common activities (see table 2 for\ndetails) in the past month. Response options were\n\"often\" (code 2), \"sometimes\" (code 1), \"never\" (code 0),\n\"refused,\" and \"don't know.\" Full or part time\nemployment was coded 2, and participation in groups\nwas coded 1. Separate indices were constructed by\nsumming responses across the three types of activity.\nEach index was set to missing if answers to two or more\nof the component questions were missing.\nHealth status measures--These measures included\nself reported medical conditions, a functional disability\nindex, and relative weight. Subjects were asked if a doc-\ntor had told them that they had any of seven chronic\nhealth conditions (myocardial infarction, stroke, hyper-\ntension, hip fracture, diabetes, liver disease, and cancer\nor tumour). Relative weight was assessed by body mass\nindex and then divided into approximate thirds to\ncreate dichotomous variables for low ( < 23 kg/m2),\nmass index. As for income a dichotomous variable for\nmissing values was created to permit inclusion of sub-\njects with missing values (6%). Final analyses were\nrepeated after exclusion of cases with missing data on\nincome and body mass index, and the interpretation of\nthe results did not change. Functional health status was\nassessed by three commonly used, self reported meas-\nures of disability: a seven item Katz index of basic\nactivities of daily living; a three item measure of gross\nmobility based on the work by Rosow-Breslau; and a\nfive item measure of basic strength and range of\nmotion developed by Nagi.20 This disability infor-\nmation was summarised into a Guttman scale of 5\nlevels (0-4), ranging from no disability in any item of\neach measure (0) to disability in at least one item of\nData analysis\nThe analysis consisted of a series of proportional haz-\nard models to estimate the effect of activity on risk of\ndeath. Kaplan-Meier life tables were computed to\nverify the proportionality assumption across quarters\nof each activity index (not shown). For the main analy-\nsis a continuous time model was specified with\nduration of survival as the dependent variable, and\neach activity subscale was entered as a continuous pre-\ndictor variable. Participants who were still alive at the\nend of observation were considered censored. Esti-\nmates of model variables and their standard errors\nwere accomplished through construction of a partial\nlikelihood function. Results are presented in two ways:\nfirst as regression variables, which represent the\ngradient effect on the risk of death of a one unit incre-\nment in each activity subscale, and, secondly, hazard\nratios were computed by comparing the scores of those\non or above the 75th centile and on or below the 25th\ncentile in the baseline distribution of each activity\nindex. These comparisons do not constitute a separate\ntest but are presented for heuristic purposes as an indi-\ncation of the relative magnitude of each effect. To\naccount for the complex sampling design all bivariate\nand multivariate models were computed with sudaan\nResults\nTable 1 summarises levels of the three types of activities\nat baseline, and table 2 gives weighted baseline propor-\ntions of participants reporting activities within each\ngroup. Activity level was slightly to moderately\ncorrelated with several other covariates included in the\nfinal models, including age, functional disability,\nmarital status, missing body mass index, and history of\nstroke, diabetes, and cancer. The three activity types\nwere only modestly correlated with each other, with\nSpearman (non-parametric) correlation coefficients\nand productive), suggesting that these type measure\nrelatively independent domains of activity.\nTable 3 shows the proportion of participants who\ndied between their baseline interview and the end of\nobservation (August 1995) with correction for the\ncomplex sampling design. Of the entire cohort, 62%\ndied during follow up. There was a clear mortality\ngradient across levels of reported activity for each type\nof activity. Those in the least active quarter were 34.7%\nmore likely to die than those in the most active quarter\nin productive activity; the figures being 20.3% for social\nactivity and 18.8% for fitness activity.\nPapers\nTable 4 shows how the proportional hazards mod-\nels (unadjusted and adjusted) predict the hazard of\ndeath over the 13 years of follow up. Preliminary mod-\nels and previous research were considered when we\nselected covariates for this model to control for\npossible confounding by variables extraneous to the\nactivity-mortality relation. Additional factors available\nin the dataset that were included in previous models\nbut were rejected because they showed no impact on\nrisk of mortality and did not modify the effect of activ-\nity level included education, history of hypertension,\nhip fracture, and angina, depression, cognitive func-\ntion, and number of chronic conditions. Both the\nunadjusted and the fully adjusted results show that\neach of the three activity types examined was\nsignificantly associated with longer survival in these\nprospective data. Older age, male sex, high body mass\nindex, longer history of smoking, and history of stroke,\ndiabetes, myocardial infarction, and functional disabil-\nity were all significantly related to mortality. Several\nother variables including income, marital status, and\nrace or ethnicity did not reach significance but were\nretained in the models because of their associations\nwith both the outcome and with the primary\nindependent variable of interest.\nAfter we controlled for other factors related to sur-\nvival, social activity was significantly associated with\nsurvival. In the adjusted model those who were more\nsocially active had longer survival compared with those\nwho were less socially active. Fitness activities were also\nsignificantly associated with mortality in both the\nadjusted and unadjusted models. Finally, productive\nactivities were also found to be protective against the\nrisk of all cause mortality in both unadjusted and\nadjusted models.\nBecause of concerns about the independence of\nthe effect of non-physical activities we conducted addi-\ntional analyses to examine the extent to which social\nand productive activities were protective against\nmortality across the highest, middle, and lowest thirds\nof fitness activity. The trend toward lowered risk of\nmortality was fairly stable (table 5). The effect of\nproductive activity was weakest among those who were\nmost active in terms of fitness activities. Because of\nfluctuations in the standard error the significance level\nof social activities fell below the 0.05 threshold in the\nmost and least active thirds; as can be seen from the\ncoefficients, however, the trend toward consistently\nlower mortality was evident in each case. Indeed, the\neffect of social and productive activity on mortality was\nthe strongest among the least physically active (as\nmeasured by the hazard ratio)--that is, the most active\nquarter enjoyed the strongest survival advantage com-\npared with the least active quarter among those least\nphysically active. Because of decreased efficiency in the\nestimates these values dip below significance. The\ndirection and strength of the association, however, is\nquite consistent.\nDiscussion\nThis study reports on the impact of activity on risk of\nall cause mortality among elderly people. More active\nelderly people were less likely to die than those who\nwere less active. Social and productive activities were\nobserved to confer equivalent survival advantages\ncompared with fitness activities. This observation is\nimportant because it suggests that activities that entail\nlittle or no physical exertion may also be beneficial. A\nwider range of mechanisms, both physiological and\npsychosocial, may be involved in the association\nbetween activity and mortality than had been\npreviously thought.\nLimitations and strengths\nThere were several limitations of this study. We asked\nabout only a limited number of activities. In addition,\nour ability to grade the frequency of participation in\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics for index of social, fitness, and productive activities at baseline in elderly people in New Haven, CT,\nUnited States\nActivity\nFull sample\nMean (SD) for\nmen\nMean (SD) for\nwomen\nP value* for\ndifference between\nsexes\nRange Mean (SD) Median (25th, 75th centiles)\n*t Test.\nTable 2 Details of activities and proportion (percentage) of participants who engaged in\nthem at baseline in 2812 elderly people in New Haven, CT, United States\nDetail of activity Sometimes Often\nNo of participants with\nmissing data\nSocial:\nFitness:\nProductive:\nNA=not applicable.\nTable 3 Mortality over 13 years in elderly people in New Haven, CT, United States*\nby quarter of distribution of each type of activity\nQuarter Social activity Productive activity Fitness activity\n*Sample size at baseline was 2761 after deletion of cases with missing data. Percentages and sample sizes\ncalculated with SUDAAN to account for complex sampling design.\nPapers\neach activity was somewhat crude. For that reason, our\nmeasures of activities convey more information about\nthe number of activities in which people participate\nthan information about the extent of that participation.\nFor this reason the survival advantages of a heavy\ninvestment in only one or two activities would not have\nbeen observed. It may have been possible to find more\nsubstantial effects had we been able to assess more fully\nthe frequency and extent of participation. In addition,\nthe number of activities assessed was not consistent\nacross the three types of activity. Questions were asked\nonly about activities in the previous month, which may\nhave introduced some measurement error.\nStrengths of this study included the use of a cohort\ndesign that involved a representative sample of elderly\npeople living in the community. Response rates were\nhigh, and complete mortality surveillance was\nachieved.\nOne possible explanation for these findings is that\nactivity levels measured at baseline were actually meas-\nuring health status in ways not otherwise controlled\nfor. If this were the case, the elimination of those who\ndied within the first 5 years of follow up would attenu-\nate the relation seen between activity and survival. We\nconducted subsequent analyses to check for this possi-\nbility and found that the protective effects of social and\nproductive activity remained consistent and significant\n(results available from the authors). The beneficial\nimpact of fitness activity was reduced in this model and\nfell below significance.\nAlso, despite the fact that the activity types were\nweakly correlated, social and productive activities may\nbe acting as proxy measures of physical activity. To test\nthis hypothesis we ran an additional model in which all\nthree types of activity were entered simultaneously. In\nthat model (which contained the same covariates as\nsignificant independent predictors of survival and\nThis may be due to the fact that fewer questions were\nasked about fitness activities. None the less, these\nresults add to our confidence that social and\nproductive activities exert an independent protective\neffect not due exclusively to the impact of physical\nactivity.\nAnother potential criticism is that several of our\nindicators of productive activity may make a substantial\ncontribution to an individual's overall level of\ncardiovascular fitness. To check for this possibility we\nran similar models in which shopping and gardening\nwere dropped from the productive activity index. The\nresults indicated that the beneficial impact of\nFurther analyses revealed that no single activity was\ndriving the association of activity types and mortality.\nIn unadjusted analyses all the individual activities with\nthe exception of the rarest (paid community work) was\nassociated with a lower risk of mortality.\nBeyond physical activity\nPrevious studies of activity and mortality have assumed\nthat physiological pathways mediate this association.\nThis has led to substantial investment in exercise inter-\nventions in older people. The activities in which older\npeople engage, however, result in a complex array of\neffects beyond improved fitness. Social activities may\ninvolve a broad range of goals, including leisure and\nenjoyment, reinforcement of social status and sense of\nworth, social engagement, and productivity. It is worth\nnoting that the initial studies that showed the benefits\nof activity were not based on laboratory experiments of\nexercise but rather on observational studies of activity\nembedded within a social context.7 22\nTable 4 Adjusted and unadjusted results of survival models comparing social, productive, and fitness activities at baseline in elderly\npeople in New Haven, CT, United States*\nStatistic\nSocial activities Fitness activities Productive activities\nUnadjusted Adjusted Unadjusted Adjusted Unadjusted Adjusted\nRegression coefficient\n(SE)\nHazard ratio\u00b6 (95% CI)\nbetween highest and\nlowest quarter\n*Sample size at baseline 2812 after deletion of missing data, 2761 cases included in analysis.\nAdjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, body mass index, current smoking status, income, functional status, and history of smoking, cancer, stroke,\ndiabetes, and myocardial infarction.\nRegression coefficients are estimates of population effect variables representing effect of 1 unit increment in each activity index on log of hazard (risk) of death\nadjusted for other factors in model.

Recent research has shown\nthat social contacts influence several biological factors.\nSubstantial evidence indicates that social contacts may\nreduce the deleterious effects of psychological stress\nthrough enhancement of both cellular and humoral\nimmune response.23 Secondly, social and productive\nactivity involves the performance of meaningful social\nroles. These roles may have important consequences\nthat go beyond the benefits of fitness alone. Meaningful\nsocial role performance promotes a sense of self\nefficacy that has been linked to several important\nhealth outcomes in later life.24 25 Social and productive\nactivity may result in a sense of meaning and purpose\nin life, which has been linked to survival in at least one\nstudy.26 Finally, social and productive activity reinforces\nrelationships as well as norms of reciprocity and mutu-\nality. Social and productive activity may enhance social\nnetworks and social support, which have been linked to\nOur findings corroborate those of a small number\nof studies that have found a link between survival and\nsocial activities that entail little or no physical\nexertion.29 This finding has important implications for\npublic policy and clinical practice. Clinicians might\nrecommend a broader range of activity options for\nolder people. For patients with chronic conditions such\nas arthritis social activity may promote wellbeing more\neffectively than physical activity.30 Evidence from the\nnational health and nutrition examination survey and\nother population studies suggests that the prevalence\nof inactivity is considerable among adults in the United\nStates and that it increases substantially among those\naged 65 and older.31 Public policy measures that reduce\nbarriers to continued social engagement would be\nimportant interventions--for example, public invest-\nment in transport and day centres for elderly people.\nAmong people in institutions these results suggest the\nimportance of alternative programmes of activity as a\ncomplement to exercise programmes. Several trials of\ninterventions in occupational therapy have shown the\nfeasibility of increasing levels of leisure and social\nSummary\nIn summary, these findings build on a substantial body\nof studies that show the benefits of remaining active in\nlater life. Furthermore, an exclusive emphasis on exer-\ncise and fitness activity may be overly narrow. While it is\nrecognised that all social activity has the potential to\ninclude physical activity, as has been argued by Yates,33\nit is important that clinicians and policymakers recog-\nnise that the physical actions in which humans engage\nare inherently social in nature as well. Clinicians can\nadd powerful new intervention tools by recognising\nthe health benefits of social and productive activities as\ncomplements to exercise. On their own, social and\nproductive activities may have independent health\nbenefits as well.\nWe acknowledge the helpful comments of Dr Steve Gortmaker\nin the preparation of this manuscript.\nContributors: TAG initiated the study, conducted the analy-\nses of the data, was the primary author of the paper, and had\nprimary responsibility for correspondence with the editors.\nCMdeL assisted in the data analysis, conducted several subsidi-\nary analyses, and participated in the writing and editing of the\npaper.

Perinatal\nwere admitted for special care. No deaths were\ndirectly attributable to delivery in water, but 2\nadmissions were for water aspiration. UK reports of\nmortality and special care admission rates for babies\nof women considered to be at low risk of complications\nduring delivery who delivered conventionally ranged\nlive births respectively. Compared with regional data\nfor low risk, spontaneous, normal vaginal deliveries at\nterm, the relative risk for perinatal mortality associated\nwith delivery in water was 0.9 (99% confidence interval\nConclusions Perinatal mortality is not substantially\nhigher among babies delivered in water than among\nthose born to low risk women who delivered\nconventionally. The data are compatible with a small\nincrease or decrease in perinatal mortality for babies\ndelivered in water.\nIntroduction\nBy 1993 all maternity units in England and Wales had\nmanaged labour or delivery in water and nearly half\nhad installed birthing pools.3 Perceived advantages\ninclude women feeling relaxed4 and more autonomous\nthan in conventional deliveries5--although a review of\nthree randomised controlled trials4 6 7 of labour in\nwater showed no clear beneficial or adverse effects on\nmother or baby.8\nThe main advantage claimed for delivery in water\nis a gentler experience for the baby. Reports of possible\nadverse effects--hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy9\nand one death attributed to labour taking place in\nwarm water10 and infection due to delivery in\nwater11\u00ad13--raise theoretical causal links. Only one\nreport of a baby who died with waterlogged lungs14 is\nclearly attributable to delivery in water. No studies,\nhowever, have yet compared maternal or paediatric\noutcomes in similar groups of women delivering in\nwater and delivering conventionally (not in water).\nWe conducted national surveys of maternity units\nand paediatricians to determine the risks of death or\nadmission for special care for babies delivered in water\nand identified clinical findings that might relate to the\nuse of water. We compared these results with rates for\nwomen at low risk of complications during labour or\ndelivery who delivered conventionally.\nMethods\nconsultant paediatricians in the British Isles were\nsurveyed each month by the British Paediatric Surveil-\nlance Unit15 and asked to report whether or not they\nPapers\nDepartment of\nEpidemiology and\nPublic Health,\nInstitute of Child\nHealth, London\nRuth E Gilbert,\nsenior lecturer in\nclinical epidemiology\nPat A Tookey,\nsenior research fellow\nCorrespondence to:\nDr Gilbert\nr.gilbert@ich.ucl.ac.uk"
