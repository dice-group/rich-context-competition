Hunt, MA\nBackground: Large numbers of convicted drunk driv-\ners are entering alcohol treatment programs, yet little in-\nformation is available about their need for psychiatric treat-\nment. This study of convicted drunk drivers estimates\nlifetime and 12-month prevalence of DSM-III-R psychiat-\nric disorders (alcohol and drug abuse and dependence, ma-\njor depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, generalized\nanxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and anti-\nsocial personality disorder) and compares rates with es-\ntimates from a US population-based survey.\nMethods: Six hundred twelve women and 493 men, aged\n23 to 54 years, convicted of driving while impaired, who\nhad been referred to a screening program in Bernalillo\nCounty, New Mexico, were located and interviewed us-\ning the Diagnostic Interview Schedule between January 25,\npared with findings from the National Comorbidity Sur-\nvey for the western region of the United States, con-\nResults: Eighty-five percent of female and 91% of\nmale offenders reported a lifetime alcohol-use disor-\nder, compared with 22% and 44%, respectively, in the\nNational Comorbidity Survey sample. Thirty-two per-\ncent of female and 38% of male offenders had a drug-\nuse disorder, compared with 16% and 21%, respec-\ntively, in the National Comorbidity Survey sample.\nFor offenders with alcohol-use disorders, 50% of\nwomen and 33% of men had at least 1 additional psy-\nchiatric disorder other than drug abuse or depen-\ndence, mainly posttraumatic stress disorder or major\ndepression.\nConclusion: Drunk-driving offenders need assess-\nment and treatment services not only for alcohol prob-\nlems but also for drug use and the other psychiatric\ndisorders that commonly accompany alcohol-related\nproblems.\nthan 1.4 million Americans\nwere arrested annually for\ndriving while impaired\n(DWI).1 Offenders are\nentering alcohol treatment programs in\nrecord numbers,2 and, for many, the\nDWI conviction presents an opportu-\nnity for early intervention.2 But DWI\ntreatment programs have shown disap-\npointing results, with neither recidivism\nnor alcohol-related crashes substantially\nSeveralfactorscontributetothesefind-\nings. Typically, offenders are coerced into\ntreatment programs and may not be moti-\nvated to change their drinking habits. The\nprograms offered often are abstinence-\noriented, an end point many offenders be-\nlieve is inappropriate.5 Also, offenders are\nlikely to have emotional and psychiatric\nproblems in addition to alcohol-related\nproblems, making treatment more chal-\nlenging.6,7 Finally,\"treatments\"forDWIof-\nfenders often include short-term pro-\ngrams5 that focus primarily on educating\noffenders about the effects of alcohol or\nabout drunk-driving laws.8\nTreatment programs should be tai-\nlored to clients' specific offense histories,\nthe severity of their drinking problems, and\ntheir other psychiatric problems.8,9 But\nlittle systematic research has examined the\nlevel of severity of drinking problems or\nother psychiatric problems among ar-\nand often conclusions rely on self-\nreported information from coerced sub-\nmethodological problems, inconsisten-\ncies in defining alcohol problem sta-\ntus,2,11 and use of samples with more se-\nvere alcohol-related problems than are\nfound in the overall population of con-\nFrom the Behavioral Health\nResearch Center of the\nSouthwest, Albuquerque, NM.\nDeceased.

All rights reserved.\nIn a review of 22 studies on drinking-driving of-\nfenders and alcoholism, the percentage of offenders con-\nsidered to be \"alcoholic\" ranged from 4% to 87%.11 This\nwide range in the estimated prevalence of alcohol prob-\nlems among DWI offenders creates uncertainty about how\nto deal effectively with these populations.11 The Insti-\ntute of Medicine2 draws the rather unhelpful conclu-\nsion from the literature that convicted drunk-driving of-\nfenders referred to treatment have higher rates of alcohol-\nuse disorders than are found in the general population\nand lower rates than clinical populations.\nLess is known about the prevalence of this popula-\ntion's drug-use or non\u00adsubstance-abuse psychiatric dis-\norders. Researchers have examined the bodily fluids of\ncrash-involved drivers, finding high rates of drug preva-\nabout offenders' drug-use disorders. Studies suggest that\ndrunk-driving offenders have high rates of antisocial be-\npeat offenders are particularly likely to exhibit antiso-\ncial tendencies and other psychopathologic conditions.21-23\nHowever, this literature provides an inadequate psychi-\natric profile of the DWI-offender population.\nThis study, by systematically collecting diagnostic\ndata, strives to determine (1) the prevalence of DWI of-\nfenders' alcohol use and comorbid psychiatric disorders\nand (2) how much this differs from that of the general\ncommunity. We argue that primary care and mental health\ncare professionals need to understand DWI offenders' al-\ncohol use, drug use, and other non\u00adsubstance-abuse psy-\nchiatric disorders. Only then can more appropriate and\neffective treatment interventions be designed.\nRESULTS\nEighty-five percent of women and 91% of men reported\nlifetime alcohol-use disorders (abuse or dependence)\nof men had a 12-month diagnosis of alcohol dependence.\nAbout one third of offenders met criteria for lifetime drug-\nuse disorders (abuse or dependence) (Table 2), most hav-\ning drug dependence. Ten percent of women and 12% of\nmen reported a 12-month drug dependence disorder. The\npercentage of interviewees reporting neither alcohol nor\ndrug diagnoses was 13% for women and 8% for men.\nLifetime major depressive disorder was found in 28%\nof women and 13% of men. Major depressive disorder\nSUBJECTS\nThe sample was drawn from a database of convicted DWI\noffenders referred to and screened by the Lovelace Com-\nprehensive Screening Program (LCSP).24 This program con-\ntracted with the Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court, Al-\nbuquerque, NM, to provide screening services to convicted\nfirst offenders. Although the LCSP was a first-offender pro-\ngram, about 20% of referrals were repeat offenders at the\ntime of their referral.25\nDetails about the LCSP have been published.24 Previ-\nous studies in this population found characteristics similar\nto those of DWI-offender populations described elsewhere\nin the United States with respect to age, sex, and marital sta-\ntus,24-26 but this population has higher proportions of His-\npanics and American Indians than those in other geographi-\nThe mean blood alcohol concentration at arrest for offend-\ners in the LCSP is 0.16 g/dL, which is in the middle range of\nmean blood alcohol concentrations for drunk drivers ar-\nrested elsewhere in the United States.28\nThe sample for the present study included 1208 con-\nsecutive women referrals from April 4, 1989, through March\nscreening during the study. Subjects were selected weekly,\ncorresponding to the 5-year anniversary of their LCSP refer-\nral.Menwerefrequencymatchedtowomenbydateofscreen-\ning referral and ethnicity and were oversampled, as a previ-\nous survey conducted in a New Mexico community revealed\nInformation about nonlocated subjects was sent to the\nNational Death Index to match against death certificates\nfiled in all states (excluding New York, NY), identifying 18\nNew Mexico; the remainder lived in 37 other states. Two\nwomen and 5 men were excluded because of incomplete\ninformation. Analyses to determine differences between in-\nterviewed and noninterviewed subjects showed that, after\ncontrolling for demographic factors, the interviewed and\nnoninterviewed subjects had similar blood alcohol con-\ncentrations at arrest and similar diagnoses of alcohol abuse\nand dependence at screening.30\nwere not either white or Hispanic and 19 women and 31\nmen older than 54 years. These limitations were imposed\nto enable comparisons with the national sample. This yielded\nparisons revealed that they were similar with respect to age,\nethnic distribution, and educational level, but differed with\nrespect to marital status, income, and number of prior DWIs\n(Table 1).\nComplete methods for locating and interviewing sub-\njects are published.30 The primary data source for locating\nclients was LCSP record data; other databases also were used.\nAcomprehensivelocationprotocolwasusedbybilingual(En-\nglish and Spanish) staff, including a letter sequence, tele-\nphone calls, and home visits. (Subjects were mailed a series\nof letters at 2-week intervals. A letter sequence included 5\nidentical letters explaining the study and asking the client\nto participate, and 1 \"pleading letter\" emphasizing the im-\nportance of the study.) About 32% were telephone inter-\nviews, conducted with out-of-state subjects and those un-\nwilling or unable to be interviewed in person. In-person\ninterviews were conducted at our office, at a neutral loca-\ntion, or in the subjects' own home. Once located, willing par-\nticipants provided written informed consent and were given\na monetary incentive to complete the interview. The proto-\ncol was approved by an institutional review board.\n\u00a92001 American Medical Association.

A higher proportion of\nwomen than men experienced lifetime and 12-month dys-\nthymic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and PTSD.\nA higher proportion of men than women met criteria for\nantisocial personality disorder.\nThe prevalence of lifetime alcohol abuse and depen-\ndence, and drug dependence for both sexes was much\nhigher in the DWI than in the matched NCS sample (Table\n2). For example, at 61% for women and 70% for men,\nthe rates of lifetime alcohol dependence among DWI of-\nfenders were more than twice those of the respective NCS\nsamples. Reported 12-month symptoms of alcohol and\nother drug dependence diagnoses in the DWI popula-\ntion also exceeded those in the NCS population.\nAmong offenders with alcohol abuse or dependence,\nsimilarproportionsofwomenintheDWIandNCSsamples\n(about half) reported at least 1 additional psychiatric dis-\norder (Table 3). The 3 most common additional disor-\ndersweredrugdependence,majordepressivedisorder,and\nPTSD. Compared with the NCS sample, a lower percent-\nage of men (DWI sample, 33%; NCS sample, 42%) had at\nleast 1 additional psychiatric disorder, the most common\nbeing drug dependence, major depressive disorder, anti-\nsocial personality disorder, and PTSD.\nCOMMENT\nCommon sense and previous research have already in-\nformed researchers that the DWI-offender population has\nhigh rates of alcohol\u00aduse disorders. What is significant\nabout this report's findings is how high these rates are,\nespecially when compared with those of the general com-\nmunity sample. In addition to the high rates, most indi-\nviduals involved with alcohol or other drugs in the DWI\nsample met criteria for lifetime dependence, whereas in\nthe general population sample there was a higher pro-\nportion with abuse (without dependence). These data\nsuggest that as a group the population of DWI offenders\nis closer to a clinical than a nonclinical population.\nFurthermore, 12-month diagnoses indicate a high de-\ngree of symptoms in the ensuing years following the\nDWI referral, which underscores the need for effective\ntherapies in this population.\nSome studies suggest that the proportion of alco-\nholics in DWI-offender populations is lower than that\nreported in the present study. Fine and colleagues44\nRates of substance abuse and other psychiatric disor-\nders in the general adult population from the National Co-\nmorbidity Survey (NCS)31 were compared with those of DWI\noffenders. The NCS is based on a stratified, multistage area\nprobability sample of noninstitutionalized civilians aged 15\nto 54 years living in the 48 contiguous states and includes\nmore than 8000 respondents. The survey was conducted\nsubjects who lived in the western region of the United States\n(Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Ari-\nzona, Utah, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, California,\nAlaska, or Hawaii) were included for comparison with the\nDWI sample. The NCS assessed DSM-III-R32 criteria using\nthe Composite International Diagnostic Interview,33 which\nis derived from, and a refinement of, the Diagnostic Inter-\nview Schedule (DIS).31\nDIAGNOSIS\nInterviewers were trained by one of us (E.S.) and met weekly\nto monitor consistency and discuss coding issues. Inter-\nincluded demographic information and a computerized ver-\nsion of the DIS.34,35 The DIS, structured and designed for\nuse by lay interviewers, has good to acceptable levels of va-\nlidity and reliability with general population samples.36-41\nThe interviewers read the DIS questions to subjects and en-\ntered their responses into the computer. The DIS deter-\nmines symptoms of disease, diagnoses, and age when the\nsubject met criteria for the diagnosis corresponding to the\nDSM-III-R.35 Disorders assessed for the present study in-\nclude rates of lifetime and 12-month alcohol and drug abuse\nand dependence, major depressive disorder, dysthymic dis-\norder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress dis-\norder (PTSD), and antisocial personality disorder. Life-\ntime prevalence is the percentage of persons who met\ndiagnostic criteria for a disorder at any time in their lives\nand 12-month prevalence is the percentage of subjects who\nexperienced the disorder within the 12 months before the\nfollow-up interview.\nNational Comorbidity Survey data were obtained from the\npublic-use data file, downloaded from the Internet site main-\ntained by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and\nSocial Research. Neither the NCS data nor the DWI data in-\ncludedinformationthatwouldallowidentificationoftheHis-\npanic subgroup (eg, Mexican American, Cuban American,\nor Puerto Rican). However, most Hispanic populations in\nthe western United States are Mexican American.42\nComparisons between the 2 samples were made by weight-\ning the NCS sample to match the DWI-offender sample by\nsons between the 2 samples were made separately for men\nand women. For the NCS sample, all observations in a spe-\ncific age, ethnic group, or educational level stratum were\nassigned a weight, computed as the ratio of the proportion\nof DWI offenders to the proportion of NCS respondents\nin that stratum. Weights for all observations in the DWI-\noffender sample were set to 1.0. All proportions, SEs, and\ntests of significance were computed using the SUDAAN pro-\ncedure CROSSTAB.43 The sampling design was specified\nas stratified sampling with replacement.

Stewart et al45 studied more than\non the Alcohol Dependence Scale.46 However, no diag-\nnostic interviews were conducted in this population.\nConversely, several studies find rates approaching\nthose in the present study. A longitudinal study17 of a com-\nmunity sample of young men reports that among those\nlater convicted of drunk driving, about half were alco-\nhol dependent at follow-up. Clinical evaluations of con-\nsecutive first offenders in a Massachusetts court found\nsuggests that 50% of all first-time, 70% of second-time,\nand 100% of third-time DWI offenders are alcoholics. Re-\nsults of these studies support our suggestion that any his-\ntory of conviction for drunk driving should alert the ex-\namining physician to evaluate the patient for alcohol abuse\nand dependence.\nOnly 2 previously published studies have used struc-\ntured diagnostic interviews to determine diagnoses of al-\ncohol abuse or dependence in DWI-offender popula-\ntions. The first was conducted among 617 New York\nreferred for alcohol evaluation.49 The authors' findings\nwere similar to ours with respect to the proportion of\nwomen with alcohol dependence (61%) but higher for\nmen (82%). Another New York study,50 conducted among\n184 convicted DWI-offender volunteers, found alcohol\ndependence in 66% of first and 87% of repeat offenders.\nThis is the first study to evaluate rates of drug abuse\nand dependence in a DWI-offender sample. Findings dem-\nonstrate a high degree of involvement with drugs other\nthan alcohol. Drug abuse or dependence was reported\nby an estimated 32% of women and 38% of men. These\nrates greatly exceed those in the general community\nsample. Findings are consistent with research showing\nthat a high percentage of crash drivers15 and drivers sus-\npected of impaired driving51,52 have used other drugs in\naddition to alcohol. It also is consistent with investiga-\ntions done in community and clinical samples of per-\nsons with alcohol-use disorders, finding high rates of drug\nproblems.53 These data suggest that all persons with\ndrunk-driving offenses should also undergo evaluation\nfor drug-use disorders.\nStudy limitations include the low participation rates\nand the procedures used to assign diagnoses. Low par-\nticipation rates are addressed in another report,30 which\nshowed that alcohol diagnosis and blood alcohol con-\ncentration at arrest of subjects interviewed were similar\nTable 1.

Pos-\nsible biases with respect to other psychiatric disorders,\nhowever, were not evaluated.\nComparison between the DWI and NCS surveys in-\ndicates that although both used the same diagnostic cri-\nteria (DSM-III-R), the interviews were not identical, with\nthe NCS interview perhaps yielding higher prevalence es-\ntimates than the DIS.31 Also, the DWI and NCS surveys\nwere administered by lay interviewers. Neither inter-\nview yields results as accurate as those of clinicians skilled\nin assigning diagnoses.31 The study limitations would be\nexpected to lead to conservative prevalence estimates for\nmost diagnoses in the DWI sample.\nNew Mexico is notorious for its high alcohol-\nrelated traffic fatality rates,54 which may suggest that these\noffenders may have higher rates of psychiatric problems\nthan offenders from other states. This concern is miti-\ngated by the similarities of our sample to other DWI-\noffender populations and by our sample's nonclinical na-\nture. If anything, these factors would lead to projected\nunderestimates of the true rate of alcohol diagnoses, com-\npared with national rates.\nThis study is also unique in its inclusion of a large\nsample of female offenders. Because women constitute\na small proportion (13%-18%) of all DWI arrests nation-\nally, only a few studies55-58 have focused on female of-\nfenders. We found that rates of alcohol-use disorders are\nhigher for male than female offenders. This is inconsis-\nwomen arrested for DWI may have higher levels of sub-\nstance-use disorders compared with male offenders. But\nrates of alcohol dependence among female offenders. In\nthe present study, there were no sex differences among\nsubjects in drug abuse or dependence.\nOur findings also agree with study results from a non-\nclinical sample of DWI offenders that found women who\nare alcohol dependent report higher levels of depres-\nsion symptoms than men who are alcohol dependent.23\nOther sex differences in the offender population are con-\nsistent with characteristics of the general population.62\nHowever, our findings that female offenders are more\nlikely than male offenders to have affective disorders and\nPTSD, but not antisocial personality disorder, do not sup-\nport the conclusion of Argeriou and Paulino59 that fe-\nmale DWI offenders may have higher levels of \"social\npathologic conditions\" than men. Our data suggest that\nfemale DWI offenders diverge more from the general\npopulation of women with respect to overall psychiatric\nmorbidity than male offenders diverge from the general\nmale population.\nConsidering the high rate of alcohol and other drug\ndependence diagnoses in the DWI-offender population,\na high level of comorbidity is expected, because indi-\nviduals with alcohol-use disorders, in clinical and com-\nmunity samples, often have additional comorbid disor-\nders.63 A study50 conducted among DWI offenders using\nthe SCL-90-R64 self-report inventory for psychopatho-\nlogic conditions found that the prevalence of psychiat-\nric symptoms was strongly related to whether the indi-\nvidual had a DSM-III-R diagnosis of alcohol dependence.\nComparison of overall rates of these disorders in the sub-\nset of DWI offenders with alcohol-use disorders in a com-\nparable NCS sample reveals high rates of other co-\noccurring disorders in both samples.\nStudies5,9,21 have pointed to the heterogeneity of\nDWI-offender populations and the need for typologies\nto better match offenders with treatments geared to\ntheir specific needs. Our study suggests that, while\nthere is a great deal of heterogeneity with respect to\npsychiatric comorbidity, only a small percentage (men,\n9%; women, 15%) did not meet lifetime criteria for\nalcohol-use disorders, far exceeding the rates in the\ngeneral population. Our findings also indicate that\ntreatment providers for DWI populations should be\nprepared to evaluate for and address psychiatric prob-\nlems commonly co-occurring in populations with\nalcohol-use disorders. This is especially important\nbecause studies of comorbid psychiatric disorders\namong persons with alcoholism find that the severity of\npsychiatric symptoms is often predictive of poor treat-\nment outcome for those who are substance abusers.65,66\nFurthermore, more intense interventions at an early\nstage may reduce recidivism and crash rates.3 Early\ndetection is particularly important for women, who are\nmore likely to experience psychiatric comorbidity and\nless likely to seek early help for drinking problems.67\nTable 3.
