    "abstract": "Abstract\nMedia, in its diverse forms, has become a powerful tool for construction and portrayal of the \"shoulds, oughts, and musts\"\nof a woman's body. As a result of \"thinning\" of beauty ideals in the media, the real woman finds the representations of\nideal woman to be increasingly unattainable. This exploratory study examined the effect of acute media images for a sample\nof young adult Indian woman (N = 60). A 2 (intervention group) \u00d7 2 (time) mixed-group design was used where half the\nparticipants were presented with thin-ideal media images, whereas the other half were presented with control images.\nThe participants were examined on body image dissatisfaction, thin-ideal internalization, and self-esteem. Results of the\nstudy indicate a significant increase in thin-ideal internalization and body dissatisfaction and a significant decrease in self-\nesteem scores as a result of exposure to the thin-ideal media images. The findings of the study indicate that, similar to their\ncounterparts in Europe and North America, young urban Indian women experience body image disturbances when exposed\nto thin-ideal images. The findings have been examined in light of the spread of global media and homogenization of beauty\nstandards among non-Western countries.\n",

These\nimages form an essential component of our body image, that\nis, how we think, feel, and behave with regard to our physical\nattributes (Grogan, 2007). The images we hold of our bodies\nare not always accurate nor are they static; sensitive to\nchanges in mood, environment, and experiences, these\nimages are ever changing. Among the variety of social expe-\nriences that potentially influence an individual's body image,\nmass media has been most extensively studied. Media tech-\nnologies (magazines, newspapers, television [TV], movies,\nand now social networking websites) provide a platform to\nportray, communicate, and construct how an ideal body\nlooks like. Although, both genders are exposed to ideal body\nmedia images, studies report that women are more vulnera-\nble to body image disturbances than men (Makowski, Mnich,\nAngermeyer, L\u00f6we, & von dem Knesebeck, 2015).\nOver the years, the Western media has propagated almost\nunattainable body images as ideal for women. The unattain-\nability of the images is evident in the omnipresence of \"size\n0\" models and celebrities in media who often resort to\nextreme measures such as unhealthy diet, exercise or even\nuse of drugs or plastic surgery to maintain almost \"sickly-\nthin\" body shape and size. Furthermore, the images we see\nare often artificially enhanced by use of excess makeup and\ncomputerized tools such as Photoshop (Field et al., 2005).\nUnfortunately, these images are readily consumed by women\noften without any awareness of the artificial nature of these\nimages, that is, women tend to engage in upward social com-\nparisons processes (Festinger, 1954). Consequently, negative\nself-evaluations made through social comparisons with\nmedia dictated ideals often leads to self-deprecation, reduced\nself-esteem, and in extreme cases, even eating disorders\n(Thompson & Stice, 2001). Thus, ideal body images and\nobjectification of women as is done in the mass media, puts\nwomen at risk for negative affect, body shame, body image\ndisturbance, eating disorders, and depression (Fredrickson &\n1University of Delhi, India\nCorresponding Author:\nItisha Nagar, Department of Psychology, Kamala Nehru College,\nUniversity of Delhi, August Kranti Marg, New Delhi 110049, India.\nEmail: itisha.n@knc.edu.in\nThe Struggle Between the Real and Ideal:\nImpact of Acute Media Exposure on Body\nImage of Young Indian Women\nItisha Nagar1 and Rukhsana Virk1\n Keywords\nthin-ideal internalization, self-esteem, body image, Indian women, body dissatisfaction, media and society, mass communication,\ncommunication, social sciences\n2 SAGE Open\nRoberts, 1997). A bulk of correlational, prospective, and\nexperimental researches have supported the now largely\naccepted truism that media contributes negative mental\nhealth consequences for the women in the West (Stice, 2002).\nIn the context of globalization and the consequent prolifera-\ntion of Western cultural ideals through global media, an\nimportant question arises: How does the thin-ideal body\nimage affect women in non-Western countries such as India?\nPrevious studies examining the body image of urban and\neducated Indian girls/women present a dismal picture.\nAlthough epidemiological evidence is lacking with respect\nto prevalence of eating disorders in India, a survey among\npsychiatrists in Bangalore found that two thirds of psychia-\ntrists reported seeing at least one case of eating disorder,\nindicating that eating disorders are not uncommon in urban\nIndia (Chandra, Abbas & Palmer, 2012). Furthermore, emer-\ngent studies indicate that an increasing number of women in\nIndia display body image disturbances. For instance,\nGoswami, Sachdeva, and Sachdeva (2012) reported high\nbody image dissatisfaction in a sample of college-going\nyoung adult women. They found that overweight students\nwith high body mass index (BMI) had a significantly higher\nprevalence of dissatisfaction relative to students with low\nBMI. Bodily dissatisfaction was also reported in urban ado-\nlescent Indian girls aged 14 to 19 years; not only were the\noverweight girls dissatisfied with their bodies but also many\nnormal-weight girls perceived themselves as overweight and\nattempted to lose weight (Som & Mukhopadhyay, 2015). In\na study that examined both school- and college-going girls/\nticipants desired to be \"slim.\" Furthermore, they reported\nthat a perception of a weight problem but not BMI contrib-\nuted significantly to higher scores on General Health\nQuestionnaire, a psychiatric screening tool (Latha, Hegde,\nBhat, Sharma, & Rai, 2006). Dixit, Agarwal, Singh, Kant,\nand Singh (2011) examined the role of age and urban living\nas variables influencing bodily dissatisfaction in adolescent\ngirls (10-19 years); younger age groups and urban residents\nexpressed significantly more dissatisfaction relative to older\nage groups and rural residents.\nIn addition to Indian sample of women, dissatisfaction\nwith body shape and size has also been reported for other\nnon-Western countries such as Fiji (Becker, Burwell, Herzog,\nHamburg, & Gilman, 2002), Croatia (Rukavina & Pokrajac-\nBulian, 2006), UAE (Eapen, Mabrouk, & Bin-Othman,\nunderdeveloped and developing countries face severe nutri-\ntional challenges affecting their physical and mental health,\nexistence of eating disorders and body image disturbances in\nnon-Western context is surprising. In addition, \"thinness\" is\nusually not a traditionally ideal physical characteristic for\nmany Eastern cultures including India. This is because being\nthin is seen as sickly, indicative of poverty, and a lack of\nprivileged upbringing. Thus, body image disturbance in non-\nWestern women is a special case that merits close attention.\nPresent Study\nIndian magazines, movies, TV shows, and social media\nhave bombarded the 21st-century Indian women with\nWestern beauty ideals: fairness and thinness. For instance,\nin spite of having a range of skin color, almost all Indian\nactresses and models are (portrayed) overwhelmingly fair\ninterviewed 26 Indian women who reported that social com-\nparisons with friends and family members as well as\nBollywood actresses play a role in their dissatisfaction with\ntheory body shape and size. They also revealed that they\nhave noted a trend for women in Bollywood to become\nslimmer over time. Indian media overwhelmingly portray\nWestern ideals when it comes to images of women. For\ninstance, even though MTV aimed to \"Indianise\" its pro-\nfound that the channel promoted many Western values nota-\nbly the beauty ideal of thinness.\nThe link between proliferation of Western beauty ideals\nand rise of body image disturbances in non-Western\n(Indian) women makes for an important topic of research.\nGiven the role played by this socioculturally acquired vul-\nnerability on the general well-being of women, the need to\naddress this topic becomes pertinent. Therefore, the present\nstudy aimed to explore the effect of exposure to acute thin-\nideal media images on college-going urban Indian women's\nbody image. Especially, the study examined the effect on\n(a) thin-ideal internalization, (b) body dissatisfaction, and\n(c) self-esteem of young Indian women. It was hypothe-\nsized that the thin-ideal media images would lead to\nincrease in internalization of the thin-ideal, increase in\nbody dissatisfaction, and decrease in self-esteem of col-\nlege-going urban Indian women.\nMethod\nParticipants\nSixty female students from different colleges in Delhi\nbetween the ages of 18 and 22 were selected for the study.\nAll participants were randomly assigned to one of two con-\nditions: media intervention and control group. As can be\nseen, the participants in the two treatment conditions were\nmatched on the following self-reported variables: age,\neducation, BMI, and social media consumption (Table 1).\nAn effort was made to minimize the influence of these\nvariables.\nDesign\nA 2 (intervention group) \u00d7 2 (time) mixed-group design was\nused. All participants were assessed twice: once before expo-\nsure to the treatment condition (pretreatment) and once after\nthe treatment condition (posttreatment).\nVirk and Nagar 3\nMaterials\nFor the media intervention condition, the participants were\nexposed to a video of models displaying the famous lingerie\nbrand, \"Victoria's Secret.\" The video lasting a minute was\nchosen to facilitate the aim of the study, that is, to examine\nthe role of Western thin-ideal media on body image of Indian\nwomen. The video chosen shows lingerie models thereby\nprominently displaying the thin beauty ideal. For the control\ncondition, a cartoon video was deliberately selected to avoid\nany references to body image. Control participants were\nexposed to a cartoon movie also for duration of 1 min.\nMeasures\nThe effects of intervention were observed on body dissatis-\nfaction, thin-ideal internalization, and self-esteem. The\nmeasures used in the present study have also been used in\nprevious studies examining media-related body image\ndisturbances.\nBody dissatisfaction.The Figure Rating Scale (Stunkard,\nS\u00f8rensen, & Schlusinger, 1983) is an instrument used to\ndetermine body dissatisfaction in males and females. The\nscale comprises nine male or female schematic silhouettes of\nvarying shapes, ranging from extreme thinness to extreme\nobesity. The respondent is required to select the silhouette\nthat she feels is reflective of her current body size and the\nsilhouette that represents her ideal body size. The discrep-\nancy between the two is considered the quotient of the\nrespondent's dissatisfaction with his or her body. As the scale\nonly makes use of figures and is nonverbal, it has been effec-\ntively used to assess body dissatisfaction with non-Western\nsamples (e.g., Swami et al., 2010; Thomas, Khan, & Abdul-\nThin-ideal internalization.\nThin-ideal internalization was\nassessed using the Ideal Body Stereotype Scale\u00adRevised\n(Stice, 2001). It is an eight-item instrument that asks partici-\npants to indicate their level of agreement with six statements\nconcerning what attractive women look like, on a 5-point\nscale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. For\nexample, \"Tall women are more attractive\" and \"Women\nwho are in shape are more attractive.\"\nSelf-esteem.The Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale (Rosenberg,\n1965) is a 10-item Likert-type scale that assesses global self-\nesteem of an individual. The responses are answered on a\n4-point scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree.\nExamples of items include \"I feel that I am a person of worth,\nat least on an equal plane with others\" and \"On the whole, I\nam satisfied with myself.\" High scores on this scale suggest\ngrater self-esteem.\nProcedure\nInformed consent was taken from all participants at the\nbeginning of the study and confidentiality and privacy were\nensured and maintained. Pretreatment data for all three mea-\nsures\u00adFigure Rating Scale, Ideal Body Stereotype Scale, and\nRosenberg Self-Esteem scale were collected from all partici-\npants. After 1 week, participants were randomly assigned to\none of two conditions. They were then shown the video clip-\nping associated with the condition. After a 5-min interval,\nposttreatment measures were collected. The entire procedure\nwas done in person, in laboratory setting. Finally, debriefing\nwas done for all. It was ensured that there were no long-last-\ning effects of the media intervention.\nStatistical Analysis\nFirst, preliminary information regarding, age, education,\nBMI, and social media consumption, collected from the par-\nticipants across two conditions, was compared to make sure\nthat there were no significant differences across the partici-\npants (Table 1). Second, descriptive statistics were obtained\nnoting ranges, means, and standard deviations for the depen-\ndent variables. After which the data was screened for normal-\nity, outliers, fit between distribution and assumptions of\nparametric statistics. Next, a 2 (intervention group) \u00d7 2 (time)\nmixed-group ANOVA was used to determine effects of expo-\nsure to the different treatment conditions on level of\nbody satisfaction, thin-ideal internalization, and self-esteem.\nAdditional analysis using paired samples t test was performed\nindividually for both conditions (control and intervention) to\ncheck for significant differences between the pretreatment\nand posttreatment scores on each of the three measures.\nResults\nThe 2 \u00d7 2 mixed-group ANOVA (Table 2) shows that group\nby time interaction was significant for all the three measures,\nindicating that the pattern of responses to media exposure\ndiffered according to whether the participants were in the\nmedia intervention group or the control group.\nTable 1.

That is, after viewing the images\nof attractive models (thin-ideal), participants felt signifi-\ncantly worse about their body. Furthermore, the significance\nof difference across treatments was associated with large\neffect sizes for all the three measures (Table 3). However,\nthere were no significant differences between pretreatment\nand posttreatment on the three measures of body image for\nthe control group.\nDiscussion\nThe objective of the exploratory study was to investigate the\neffect of acute media interventions on body dissatisfaction,\nthin-ideal internalization, and self-esteem of urban Indian\nfemales. The findings were in line with our hypothesis, that\nis, acute exposure to thin-ideal media images was related to\nbody image disturbances. Furthermore, the findings repli-\ncated previous work done on Western sample (e.g., Cattarin,\nThompson, Thomas, & Williams, 2000; Groesz, Levine, &\nempirically linking body dissatisfaction, self-esteem, and\nthin-ideal internalization with media's endorsement of the\nthin-ideal on an Indian sample.\nHomogenized beauty ideals, specifically the hegemony of\nWestern beauty standards in non-Western countries (Brewis,\nWutich, Falletta-Cowden, & Rodriguez-Soto, 2011; Yan &\nBissell, 2014), has been attributed to be the reason behind the\nincrease of bodily dissatisfaction and increase in global prev-\nalence rate of eating disorders (Gordon, 2001). In an interest-\ning study, Becker and colleagues (2002) examined impact of\nthe introduction of TV in a rural community in Western Fiji.\nThey reported that prior to the advent of TV, \"thin\" people\nwere considered to be sickly, incompetent, but advent of TV\nhas led to discontent with being \"fat\" in adolescent ethnic\nFijian girls. A recent large-scale study that surveyed over\nIndia, reported that BMI and Western media exposure pre-\ndicted body dissatisfaction among women. Furthermore, the\nstudy found that body dissatisfaction and desire for thinness\nis commonplace in high socioeconomic status (SES) settings\nacross world regions (Swami et al., 2010). Erskine,\nWhiteford, and Pike (2016) predicted that eating disorders\nare going to \"potentially rise\" even in low- and middle-\nincome countries as a result of the cultural changes.\nToday, an increasing number of young Indian women are\nroutinely exposed to Indian and Western media, which\nembody the iconic thin-ideal and communicate uniform \"you\ncannot be too rich or too thin\" belief (Cullity, 2002; Talukdar,\nfashion photography, and selected textual material from the\nTable 2. Factorial Analysis of Variance.\nMeasure Source df F p\nTable 3.Paired t Test for Pre- and Posttreatment for Control (N = 30) and Intervention Group (N = 30).\nMeasure Group\nPretreatment Posttreatment\nt p Cohen's d\nVirk and Nagar 5\nIndian women's magazine Femina and found that the \"new\"\nIndian woman is being rapidly constructed, shaped, and\nredefined as a commercialized product along the lines simi-\nlar to the images of women in the Western media. Negative\nself-evaluations made as a result of upward social compari-\nsons (Festinger, 1954) with these unattainable (Western) ide-\nals--in the case of present study, extremely thin and beautiful\nlingerie models--can lead to dissatisfaction and reduced\nself-esteem (Engeln-Maddox, 2005). The Western beauty\nideals unattainable even for the Western women are excep-\ntionally challenging for Indian women. Biological differ-\nences in terms of body shape, size, and skin color of their\nethnicities are often overlooked when an Indian girl com-\npares herself with a \"size-0 White\" model. Consequently, a\nnumber of recent studies examining body dissatisfaction in\nIndian adolescents and young adults have found that increas-\ning number of Indian women tend to experience negative\nthoughts, feelings, and beliefs about their body size, shape,\nappearances, and so forth (e.g., Goswami et al., 2012; Latha\nThe findings are indeed disturbing in a society where\ntraditionally being thin was related to lower SES and being\nfat communicated financial prosperity. Beauty ideals are\nrapidly undergoing a change in response to the idealized\nimages of global womanhood. Thus, once thought to be a\n\"culturally bound syndrome\" limited to Western popula-\ntion, body dissatisfaction and eating disorders has become\na major concern for women across the globe. Any woman\nfalling short of the unrealistic ideals often finds herself ren-\ndered psychologically vulnerable, struggling between the\nreal and ideal as the lines increasingly become blurred.\nThapan (2004) regarded this struggle as \"recolonisation of\nIndian woman's embodiment.\"\nLimitations\nThe findings of the study need to examined in light of the\nfact that the exploratory study had a small sample size con-\nsisting of English speaking, university-educated representa-\ntive of the urban middle-class population of Delhi National\nCapital Region (NCR). Future researches should focus on\ninvestigating the long-term effect of media images on differ-\nent population samples such as adolescent and preadolescent\ngirls from both urban and rural settings. In addition, the mea-\nsures used have not been standardized on Indian population.\nImplications and Conclusion\nThe findings of the study indicate that young urban Indian\nwomen experience body dissatisfaction and reduced self-\nesteem when exposed to Western thin-ideal images to the\nsame extent as their counterparts in Europe and North\nAmerica. Furthermore, the findings suggest that media\nimages of duration as little as a minute can lead to increased\nacceptance (internalization) of socially defined ideals.\nAlthough, the sample of the study was small, it is the first in\nempirically linking media exposure and body image con-\ncerns for an Indian sample.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBecker, A.
