Widowhood transitions\nare particularly consequential and fraught with risk where\npension and social welfare systems are weakly developed\nand older adults are primarily dependent upon children to\nprovide instrumental, emotional, and economic support.\nOne such context is China, a country that will experience\na dramatic rise in its elderly population, consequently cre-\nating multitudes of widows and widowers in the process\ntion to the declines in social support and economic resources\nthat widows and widowers may encounter, widowhood has\nbeen associated with heightened risks of morbidity and mor-\ntality, a pattern observed in Hong Kong, mainland China, and\nsuch, parent\u00adchild coresidence support traditions appear to\nbe particularly important at this point in the life course. Some\nscholars find that depression among bereaving widows and\nwidowers in China is buffered by socially supportive adult\nchildren (L. Li, Liang, Toler, & Gu, 2005). And recent analy-\nses find that household and emotional support, especially\nwhen delivered by coresident and proximate children, lessen\nmortality risks among rural elderly Chinese, suggesting that\nintergenerational coresidence may be protective of older well-\nbeing in widowhood (W. Zhang, Li, & Silverstein, 2005).\nA range of studies have examined marital status as a\nstatic independent variable in cross-sectional analyses of\nolder adult living arrangements (e.g., Cooney & Shi, 1999;\nhave utilized longitudinal approaches to consider how tran-\nsitions into widowhood affect adaptations in living arrange-\nments. Moreover, although past studies have deliberated\nupon the endurance of child coresidence in the context of\nchanging demographics, the fates of vulnerable subsets of\nChina's elderly population, including widows and widow-\ners, have not been sufficiently addressed. The current study\nassumes that adjustments in coresidence are shaped by wid-\nowhood transitions in conjunction with other characteris-\ntics, such as gender, health, social status, and structures of\nfamilial networks. We draw upon the Chinese Longitudinal\nvide a dynamic analysis examining whether the onset of\nwidowhood triggers shifts in intergenerational coresidence.\nLong extolled as the upmost virtue in Chinese society,\nfilial piety is thought to be expressed most clearly in adult\nchildren's provision of care to their elderly parents (Ikels,\n1993).

Transitions from marriage to widowhood are consequential and fraught with risk in developing country\ncontexts. We investigate whether transitions to widowhood, as well as transitions to worsened functional health, predict\ntransition into coresidential living arrangements with children in a rapidly aging China. We also inquire whether coresi-\ndence transitions vary by older adults' gender and the presence of grandchildren in skip generation households.\nMethods. Longitudinal prospective analyses of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Surveys (1998\u00ad2005)\nassess whether transition to widowhood and transition to relatively poor functional health influence elderly coresidence\nwith children. Several logistic regression models are estimated using robust standard error estimation to address data\nclustering at the person level.\nResults. When coresidence shifts occur, they are shaped by the needs of older adults. Specifically, a significant rise in\ncoresidential living follows widowhood as well as deterioration in functional health. Among older adults coresiding with\ngrandchildren, shifts to coresidence with own children following widowhood and worsened functional health are attenu-\nated, suggesting that skip generation households may be supportive arrangements for older adults.\nDiscussion. Results are interpreted in light of the adaptability of living arrangements, novel forms such as skip gen-\neration households, and intergenerational support for China's elderly population.\nKey Words: China--Comparative demography--Life changes--Living arrangements--Widowhood.\naccomplished through coresidential living (L. Li et al., 2005).\nMuch research has shown that obligations to older adults\nremain pervasive, guiding values among Chinese, and that\nthese values are, in many instances, reinforced by the Chinese\ncommunist state (Chen & Silverstein, 2000; Davis & Harrell,\nThe strong value placed on filial piety in Chinese society, espe-\ncially the emphasis on demonstrating loyalty and support to\nparents over and above the service of one's own needs, is con-\nsistent with a family altruism orientation to intergenerational\nsupport and specifically to a coresidence transition when an\nelder parent is widowed or otherwise experiences heightened\nAs in much of the Asian-Pacific region, population aging is\nproceeding at a rapid pace in China, and as a result, sizable\nsegments of the population will encounter widowhood in the\ncoming decades (Zeng & George, 1999). In addition, increas-\ning longevity and the one-child policy are resulting in a\nso-called \"4-2-1\" situation, that is, family structures consisting\nof four older grandparents, two adult children, and one younger\ndescriptive of China's family structural diversity under the\none-child policy, the tendency toward this structure predicts\nthat large numbers of older adults will rely on support from\nrelatively small numbers of adult children and grandchildren.\nThis raises questions as to the durability of families in\nfulfilling elderly support needs and the potential demand for\nalternative forms of assistance in coming decades. Al-\nthough the welfare of parents has long been considered to\nbe a primary concern of adult children, emerging demo-\ngraphic realities threaten to strain these deeply entrenched\nfilial obligations. Voices from academic and policy circles\nhave raised concerns that changes in Chinese society, in-\ncluding rapid declines in fertility, and changing attitudes,\nconsumption behaviors, and living arrangements associated\nwith marked urbanization and globalization will lead to iso-\nlation and abandonment of older adults by children whose\nfilial piety is diminished (D. Gu, Dupre, & Liu, 2007; Zhan,\nLiu, & Bai, 2006). Correspondingly, some studies have doc-\numented a secular decline in parent\u00adchild coresidence in\nChina in recent decades (Xin & Chuliang, 2008).\nAnticipated growth of the widowed population in China\nplaces these concerns about weakened intergenerational\nsupport and rising caregiving burdens into sharp relief. If\ncoresidence is a reliable form of intergenerational support\nin China, it should emerge most visibly in contexts\nwhen older adults become more vulnerable and less self-\nsufficient, such as when functional health worsens, when\nwidowhood leaves an older adult alone and bereaving, and\nespecially when these marital and health transitions over-\nlap.An examination of the period following spousal death is\ncritical for deciphering whether child coresidence remains a\nviable form of elderly support as it is at this point that we\nexpect parental need to be great, filial children to be respon-\nsive, and living arrangements to change accordingly.\nA \"family altruism\" framework has been articulated and\nempirically supported in previous analyses that find that in-\ntergenerational support receipt is predicted by certain\n\"markers of dependency,\" such as physical disabilities and\nhealth problems (Frankenberg, Lillard, & Willis, 2002;\nLogan & Bian, 2003). The onset of widowhood and poor\nhealth is among the times in which supportive ties, such as\nthose expressed by movement into a coresidential arrange-\nment, are likely to be activated (Frankenberg et al., 2002).\nfunctional limitations, as markers of dependency, are asso-\nciated with living arrangement transitions, with transitions\nmore likely to follow for women and those not married. The\ncurrent analyses further explore late-life coresidence transi-\ntions, expanding the time frame of analysis and highlighting\nthe transition to widowhood as it alters dependency and\ninfluences shifts in coresidence arrangements.\nMoreover, the analysis considers that transitions in co\nresidence in response to widowhood in China are likely to\nvary across several other dimensions. One is gender. Older\nfemales are more likely to be reliant upon the economic re-\nsources of spouses and to experience financial instability\nwhen their spouses die (S. Gu & Liang, 2000; L. Li et al.,\n2005). Still, men's networks of support, in particular ties to\nchildren, are thought to be fostered by the kin-keeping roles\nolder men's kinship ties may be rendered more tenuous\nwhen a wife dies. It is estimated that within the next 20\u00ad30\nyears, approximately one quarter of Chinese women will be\nelderly. Gender-differentiated health, education, and labor\nmarket outcomes in China suggest that this elderly female\npopulation will be disproportionately widowed, poorly edu-\ncated, and financially insecure as compared with their male\nAnother key dimension is the structure of an older adult's\nhousehold. Because ensuring the well-being of the older\ngeneration is a fundamental priority under family altruism,\nthe presence and availability of other potential family care-\ngivers need to be considered. A particularly important com-\nponent that has received limited attention in past literature\nis the presence or absence of grandchildren. The expression\nof filial piety is not limited to acts toward one's parents but\nrather extends across multiple generations. Under such val-\nues and where family economies are increasingly dispersed\nacross space through labor migration, one might expect\ngrandchildren to be coresiding with grandparents in order to\nmeet support needs. Yet much past literature has cast the\n\"skip generation household\" as one in which grandparents\nserve as caregivers in the wake of absent migrant parents.\nHowever, especially in the case of the very old, grandchil-\ndren may themselves be old enough to act as caregivers and\nthus may substitute for older adults' own children in this\ncapacity (Zeng & George, 2000). Given the increased labor\nmigration occurring out of rural areas and small cities, the\nskip generation household, that is, a household with older\nadults and grandchildren but no middle generation, may\nevolve as a living situation that offers various forms of infor-\nmal support to older adults in lieu of child coresidence. In this\nsense, the skip generation household may be one that buffers\nthe effect of widowhood, and other shifts in need, on living\narrangement transitions. Thus, grown children may provide\nsupport to their aged parents indirectly, through extended\nfamily relations, by assuring that daily care and companion-\nship are provided to parents in need by their own children.\nIn rural China, the coresidence of older adults with grown\nchildren is often a stable status, rooted in cultural expecta-\ntions of filial piety as well as social and economic interde-\npendence across generations. Yet, not all coreside with\nchildren. Our perspective on the Chinese extended family\nand family altruism leads us to formulate several hypothe-\nses on older adult living arrangement transitions. For those\nwho have lived apart, we hypothesize that older adults will\nbe most likely to enter into coresidential arrangements with\nadult children when their circumstances are reflective of\nneed for support. Deteriorating functional health, the ab-\nsence of other kin relations in the household, and most im-\nportantly for the current analysis--becoming a widow or\nwidower--are the conditions or events that our study exam-\nines as indicators of relative need and dependence upon as-\nsistance. Widowhood, when accompanied by poor or\ndeclining health, suggests a situation of great parental de-\nmand for assistance, implying that coresidential living with\na child is practically a necessity (see also Ikels, 1993,\np. 318). Alternatively, grown grandchildren may be able to\nassist in meeting the needs of older adults. Thus, per the\ncontext of household structure discussed earlier, we further\nhypothesize that the tendency to shift into coresidence with\nchildren will be lessened for those older adults experiencing\nheightened need but already coresiding with grandchildren in\nskip generation households. Finally, given the gendered\nquality of kin relations in China, we expect that elderly\nwomen will experience relatively greater odds of transition to\nchild coresidence when faced with widowhood or functional\nhealth decline as compared with their male counterparts.\nMethods\nWe analyze data from the CLHLS, which began in 1998\nand 2005. Follow-ups included reinterviews of the baseline\nsample plus add-ons to account for attrition. The sample\ncomes from 22 Han ethnicity\u00addominated provinces where\nhalf of the counties were randomly selected as part of the\nsample. This results in an extensive sample covering 80% of\nChina's total population (Zeng & Gu, 2008). Beginning in\ninclude those aged 65\u00ad79 years in addition to the ongoing\npanel of oldest old. The current study uses the entire longi-\ntudinal sample, including those aged 80 years and older\nThat 65\u00ad79 year olds were included in only two of the four\nCLHLS waves under consideration results in a sample age\ndistribution that is nonrepresentative. It should also be noted\nthat the CLHLS oversampled male oldest old, nonagenari-\nans, and centenarians, further shaping the age distribution\nof the analytic sample. Neither of these sampling particu-\nlarities influence the results of multivariate analyses that\nadjust for age.\nBesides allowing us to analyze a large probability sample\nof older adults in China, the CLHLS has features that are\nwell suited to the questions at hand. First, the longitudinal\nnature of the data provides a framework whereby reinter-\nviews allow for measurement of changes in marital status\nand functional health and for linking these changes across\ntime with transitions in residential arrangements across the\nsame points in time. Second, the CLHLS systematically uti-\nlizes child and household rosters across waves of data collec-\ntion, allowing delineation of numbers of living children as\nwell as numbers and types of resident kin (e.g., grandchildren)\nwhose presence may either encourage or lessen child coresi-\ndence. Third, measures of activities of daily living (ADLs)\nallow for the linking of disability with transitions in living\narrangements in the context of changes in marital status.\nIn order to measure changes in child coresidence, we\ntreat each segment of time between successive waves as an\nobservation period and prepare a stacked data set. The\nmethod of reinterview means that older adults may have up\nto three person-interval records in the stacked data set, gen-\nerating a total of 15,039 person-intervals. Although exten-\nsive clustering at the individual level does at times warrant\nmultilevel models to address error structure in the data, the\nCLHLS data does not result in such a situation. In fact,\nthe average number of intervals respondents contributed to\nthe data was 1.7, with the mean number of survey intervals\nbeing almost identical for male and female respondents.\nThis indicates only a moderate degree of nesting, with\nmany respondents (62%) contributing only one interval of\nobservation. Given this, a multilevel approach is not only\nunnecessary but also untenable, and we instead treat our\nquestion of residential shifting using a logistic regression\nmodel with robust standard error estimation to account for\nclustering at the individual level. Such an approach is well\nsuited to the data and its error structure and offers a straight-\nforward means to address the contribution of multiple ob-\nservations by a minority of respondents. When presenting\ndescriptive statistics (Table 1), we use individuals as the\nanalysis unit, rather than person-intervals, to reflect the\nsample of 9,650 older adults who appear in the CLHLS and,\nin our analysis, for at least two consecutive waves.\nCoresidence with a child is the outcome of interest, and\ngiven the age of the sample, in all cases this means coresi-\ndence with an adult offspring. Coresidence is constructed as\na dichotomous variable by referring to the household roster\nin each CLHLS wave. Among older adults who were non\ncoresident at baseline, we assess whether they did coreside\nwith a child (or children) by follow-up. By accounting for\ncoresidence at baseline, we are modeling a \"transition\" in\ncoresidence.\nOur focal independent variable is a dynamic measure of\nmarital status. As can be seen in Table 1, widowhood is a\nprevalent status among older adults surveyed in the CL-\nHLS, and it is a status that is especially prevalent among\nTable 1.

As we are interested in marital\nstatus transitions as events that evoke change and poten-\ntially risk, we compare marital status at baseline and again\nat follow-up and define marital status transitions as follows:\n(a) married at follow-up (reference category), (b) married at\nbaseline and widowed at follow-up, and (c) widowed at\nbaseline and follow-up.\nOur secondary independent variable, assessed at baseline\nand subsequently, is a dummy variable indicating whether\nthe respondent experienced functional health decline. Spe-\ncifically, for baseline and follow-up, we construct a score,\nranging from 0 to 12, to indicate the number of ADLs with\nwhich the older adult reports experiencing difficulty and the\nseverity of that difficulty (Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson,\n& Jaffee, 1963). ADLs are specific tasks necessary for the\nmaintenance of independence. The six ADLs considered\nhere are bathing, dressing, toileting, getting out of bed, con-\ntinence, and feeding oneself. Specifically, for each ADL, if\nthe respondent reports no difficulty, a score of zero is as-\nsigned; if some difficulty is reported, a score of one is as-\nsigned; and if the respondent reports difficulty so great as to\nrequire assistance of another person or device, a score of\ntwo is assigned. These scores are summed. Respondents\nwith high scores are seen as being relatively dependent\nupon others for handling one's own day-to-day functioning\nand self-care. We assess functional health decline in those\nrespondents who have a higher ADL score at follow-up than\nthey had at baseline.\nThe test of our hypotheses about child coresidence re-\nsponsiveness hinges on observed changes to living arrange-\nments that accompany transitions from married to widowed\nas well as shifts from positive to poor functional health and\nwhether relatively debilitating outcomes (i.e., the experi-\nence of widowhood and the increase in functional health\nlimitations) emerging jointly incrementally increase the\nodds of transitioning to coresidence with an adult child.\nOur multivariate analyses consider a series of additional\ncovariates pertinent to elderly living arrangements. As the\npresence of other kin is likely to influence the propensity of\nolder adults to coreside with children, we use the household\nroster to derive a measure of grandchildren in the household\nat baseline. As elaborated earlier, the grandchildren in ques-\ntion are rarely children, given the age of the respondents\nand their own childbearing patterns as well as those of their\nchildren. Rather, of grandkids residing in respondents'\nhouseholds without own children coresident (i.e., skip gen-\neration households), fewer than 12% are under the age of 15\nyears, and their mean age is 34 years. Although skip gen-\neration households, consisting of grandchildren, older\nadults, and no middle generation, are small in number, we\nfocus on this household form as it is likely an important\nemerging living situation in China.\nControl variables in the models include the number of\nliving sons and daughters at baseline, the older adult's age\n(measured categorically so as to capture nonlinear associa-\ntions), highest educational attainment, main occupation\nprior to age 60 years, and geographic location of residence\n(i.e., whether rural village, town, or city). Finally, we incor-\nporate the older adult's gender into the models to assess\nwhether coresidence shifting diverges for men and women.\nResults\nTable 1 presents descriptive statistics for the analytical\nsample. Note that we present baseline characteristics for\nthose individuals who appeared in at least two consecutive\nwaves of the CLHLS (N = 9,650). Highlighting marital sta-\ntus and marital status transitions, nearly 40% were married\nat baseline (i.e., the first time they entered the sample). De-\nspite the relatively small window of time that we use to as-\nsess transitions (i.e., 2\u00ad3 years), we observe over 7% of\nmarried adults at baseline becoming widowed by follow-up\n(N = 688). Functional health also fluctuates across survey\nwaves, with greater than 20% of individuals in the analyti-\ncal sample experiencing declining ability to perform ADLs\nat follow-up (N = 2,025). The upcoming analysis addresses\nwhether these transitions contribute to significant rear-\nrangement of older adults' residential situations with re-\nspect to child coresidence.\nWe provide transition matrices for parent\u00adchild coresi-\ndence situations in Table 2, panels A through C. Each tran-\nsition matrix also considers changes in the coresidence\nstatus of grandchildren. Specifically, the first row of each\nmatrix establishes whether at least one child coresides at\nbaseline, and subsequent child coresidence status at follow-\nup. The latter two rows establish whether a grandchild, or\nneither child nor grandchild, resides in the household at\nbaseline and whether these arrangements prevail at follow-\nup. We delineate living arrangement status transitions for all\nsurviving older adults in the sample (panel A) and then for\nthe subsets of older adults who experienced a shift to wid-\nowhood (panel B) or a worsening of functional health situ-\nation (panel C). As compared with Table 1, here the unit of\nanalysis is not individuals but person-intervals. Each re-\nspondent may contribute up to three intervals, but the aver-\nage for the analytical sample is 1.7.\nA brief inspection of Table 2 panel A indicates that co\nresidence with one's own child(ren) is a relatively stable\nstatus. Yet, both transitions into and out of coresidence oc-\ncur on a quite frequent basis. For instance, of the approxi-\nmately 62% of older adults coresiding with a child at\nbaseline, about 83% of those were also coresiding at\nfollow-up. The balance either resided with a grandchild\nonly or without a grandchild or child. For those not residing\nwith a child at baseline, most do not have a grandchild\npresent either. In the 32% of older adults in this situation,\nover 25% live with a child by follow-up. Approximately\n6% of older adults were living without a child but with a\ngrandchild present at baseline. Not only relatively uncom-\nmon, this latter arrangement is relatively unstable; between\n30 and 40% of such older adults are coresiding with a child\nby follow-up.\nInspecting panel B, which represents the living arrange-\nment transitions of older adults who experience widowhood\nbetween survey intervals, we see that for those without a\nchild present at baseline (52.6%), a far more sizable share\ntransitioned to coresidence over the interval (84.1%) than\nwas the case for the full sample (only 57.4% in the analyti-\ncal sample overall experienced such a shift). Recent widow-\nhood, too, is associated with greater movement out of\ncoresidence situations that involved a grandchild but no\nown child.\nPanel C, which considers changes for those experiencing\nfunctional health declines, indicates that older adults in this\ncategory are least likely to transition out of child coresident\narrangements across survey intervals. Specifically, about\n86% living with a child at baseline and who experience a\ndeterioration of functional health remain coresident. Of\nthose co-residing with just a grandchild but no child, func-\ntional health deterioration appears to increase the likelihood\nof remaining in such a state rather that transitioning to a\nsituation in which no grandchild or no child coresides.\nIn Table 3, we model living arrangement transitions by\nassessing predictors of a change to child coresidence for\nolder adults who, at baseline, were not coresiding with a\nchild. Model 1 results are consistent with our hypotheses\nregarding transitions reacting to parental need. Specifically,\nolder adults who have recently been widowed are substan-\ntially and significantly more likely (odds ratio [OR] = 3.69)\nthan those who remain married to enter into a coresidence\nsituation by the end of the survey interval. The OR for those\nremaining widowed (OR = 1.93) suggests an increasing\nlikelihood of adopting a coresidential living arrangement\nwith at least one adult child with the passage of time as a\nwidow or widower.\nResults also indicate that older adults in China are more\nlikely to enter into a coresidential living arrangement with a\nchild if they have recently experienced a decline in their\nfunctional health status (OR = 1.49). This is attributed to the\npositive and significant association between shifts to cores-\nidence and rise in the disability status score within the sur-\nvey interval, controlling for the disability status score at\nbaseline. This pattern is consistent with our overarching\ntheoretical perspective as greater limitations faced in han-\ndling tasks of daily living represent an entrance into greater\nphysical dependency and thus greater need for support.\nAdditional variables in the models warrant mentioning as\nthey illustrate the set of social and demographic factors as-\nsociated with transition into coresidential living with adult\nchildren. First, and contrary to expectation, we do not find\ngender to be a significant factor in transition to intergenera-\ntional coresidence. However, additional analyses indicate\nthat the relationship between gender and coresidence transi-\ntion is moderated by the high correlation between gender\nand marital status, specifically women's greater likelihood\nof being widowed between baseline and follow-up. Place of\nresidence is significant, with older adults in urban areas\n(i.e., cities and towns) being significantly less likely than\ntheir rural counterparts to enter coresidence arrangements.\nThese latter results are consistent with a picture of move-\nment away from coresidence traditions among populations\nin relatively modernized regions of the country. Finally, we\nfind that main occupation prior to age 60 years is not a sig-\nnificant predictor of coresidence transitions.\nBy adding interactions, Models 2 and 3 further assess the\neffects of becoming widowed, worsening functional health,\nand the presence of grandchildren on shifts in coresidence.\nThe interactions are significant, and the model goodness of fit\nimproves, indicating that the effects of being or becoming\nwidowed and ADLs are conditional on grandchild presence.\nTable 2.

Results for adults age 65+ with functional health decline between baseline and follow-up\nFirst, examining marital status by grandchild presence, the\ncontrast category is the case of a continuously married re-\nspondent with no coresident grandchild. All other situations\nincrease the ORs. For instance, when one remains married,\nthe probability of shifting to a coresidential situation in-\ncreases (OR = 2.09) with the presence of a grandchild.\nWhen a grandchild is not present, marital statuses other\nthan continuously married increase the probability of shifts\ninto coresidence. The OR is particularly robust for those\nwhose status changes from married to widow. The most no-\ntable effect of the interactions in Model 2 is to signify that\nwhen there is a change in marital status from married to\nwidowed, the presence of a grandchild decreases the OR of\na shift into coresidence from 3.96 (main effect) to 3.31 (the\nproduct two main effects and the interaction effect). Thus,\nalthough becoming widowed greatly increases the probabil-\nity of moving to a coresidential situation, grandchild pres-\nence influences the magnitude of this probability.\nSecond, looking at ADL limitations in Model 3, the im-\nportance of grandchild presence is again important in deter-\nmining the impact on a change in coresidence. Specifically,\nwhen no grandchild is present, an increase in ADL limita-\ntions during the interval increases the probability of a\nchange. But, when a grandchild is present, the impact of\nADL limitations is tempered. Here, the presence of a grand-\nchild decreases the OR of a shift into coresidence from 1.78\n(main effect) to 1.21 (the product two main effects and the\ninteraction effect). The interacted models convey that al-\nthough a tendency persists toward parent\u00adchild coresidence\nin those situations where older adult need is heightened\n(i.e., widowhood and worsened functional health), that ten-\ndency is weaker in skip generation households.\nFigures 1 and 2 are provided to further clarify the condi-\ntionality of coresidence shifts on residence in a skip gen-\neration household at baseline. Specifically, in Figure 1, we\nsee that for those who have recently been widowed, the\nTable 3.

The converse is observed for older adults\nwho remain married over the observation interval; in such\ncases, residing in a skip generation household actually\nslightly increases the probability of shifting to coreside with\na child at follow-up.\nFigure 2, which presents predicted probabilities for cores-\nidence shifting by change in functional health status, condi-\ntional on grandchild presence, further conveys this pattern.\nThat is, among older adults with worsening ADLs, the prob-\nability of shifting into coresidence is lessened among those\nwho coreside with grandchildren at baseline, as compared\nwith those who do not coreside with grandchildren. Together,\nthese results suggest that grandchildren in skip generation\nhouseholds may be providers of informal care when needs\narise, potentially substituting for older adults' own children.\nIn other words, in the face of pervasive outmigration and\nheightened longevity, emerging old age support relations in\nChina may bridge not just two but three generations.\nFigure 1.

Again, in support of the main hy-\npotheses, the results show that older adults who coreside\nwith a child are much less likely to change to living without\na child by follow-up when their spouse dies in comparison\nwith those whose spouse remained living. Similarly, coresi-\ndence status is less likely to change for those remaining\nwidowed over the survey interval as compared with those\nwho were married at follow-up. With respect to other co-\nvariates, we observe that older adult women are more likely\nto transition out of child coresident households between\nbaseline and follow-up, and movement out of child co-\nresident situations is less likely for those who also have a\ngrandchild coresiding at baseline. As compared with the\nsignificant interactions between grandchild presence and\nmeasures of older adult need (widowhood and declining\nfunctional health) in Models 2 and 3, the results in Models\n5 and 6 do not suggest that the effect of widowhood and\nworsening ADLs on shifting out of coresidence depends on\nthe presence or absence of grandchildren. Apparently, the\nmovement into coresidence is qualitatively different from ex-\niting a coresidence situation. Taken together with the results\nfrom Models 2 and 3, this suggests that coresident grandchil-\ndren may substitute for own children as caregivers for ailing\nor bereaved older adults, yet when such changes occur in\nhouseholds that contain three generations, the presence of\ngrandchildren does not appear to free the parents to leave.\nFollowing on our logic of coresidence and older adult\nneed, we might expect that a shift to child coresidence\nwould be even more likely in those cases where widowhood\nand declining functional health overlap in the survey inter-\nval. Such time periods would likely be highly fraught with\nneed for informal support, especially if the deceased spouse\nhad served as caregiver. However, additional analyses, in\nwhich worsening ADLs and entrance into widowhood were\ninteracted, did not yield significant results. Finally, it is no-\ntable that we conducted a series of additional equations es-\ntimating interactions between gender and changes in marital\nstatus and functional health, but these did not yield signifi-\ncant results or substantial improvement in model fit and\nthus are not presented here.\nDiscussion\nThe current article explored the impact of widowhood on\nthe probability that older adults not coresiding with a child\nin China at time of baseline measurement have changed ar-\nrangements and are living with a child at follow-up. We also\nexplored the reverse possibility--remaining coresident af-\nter experiencing widowhood. The results of our analysis al-\nlow us to comment on whether there is cause for pessimism\nregarding the viability of intergenerational support systems\nand family-based oldage security in a China facing rapid\npopulation aging, urbanization, and a host of modernizing\ninfluences. Other recent studies have taken up this question,\nand their results frequently suggest that although child co\nresidence with elderly parents is on the decline, there is rea-\nson for cautious optimism that support traditions will\nsurvive and elders will remain secure and supported. For\ninstance, recent studies (e.g., Shengming, Chen, & Yang,\ntigating the transfer of support from both coresident and\nnoncoresident children to parents in China and elsewhere in\nAsia suggest patterns consistent with a \"modified extended\nfamily\" in which care and support of elders are ensured,\nalbeit increasingly by children living at a distance (Litwak &\nKulis, 1987). Furthermore, several have observed that inter-\ngenerational obligations and an \"unwritten contract of\nentitlement\" between generations to coreside when one\ngeneration is perceived as incapable of adequately provid-\ning for itself override desires for nuclear households and\nresult in persistent multigenerational living (Davis, 1993;\nOur article contributes to this base of knowledge by high-\nlighting the experiences of subgroups deemed particularly\nneedy. Although the average picture of older adulthood in\nChina is characterized by stability in residential context, we\nfind that such residential stability predominates among\nolder adults whose lives are otherwise stable. Movement\ninto particular life states, such as widowhood or disable-\nment, is often accompanied by shifts in living arrangements.\nBy highlighting residential change around these critical late\nadulthood turning points, we gain greater understanding of\nthe durability of intergenerational support and responsive-\nness of grown children to aging parents' needs.\nOur results are cause for cautious optimism. Our findings\non widowhood transitions as precursors of adult\u00adchild co\nresidence are robust across gender and completed family\nsize of older adults. This pattern suggests that older adults,\nboth men and women, and those with many children and\nfew continue to turn to child coresidence when they have\nlost the support and companionship of their spouse. Like\nthose presented here are not consistent with modernization\ntheory's predictions about eroding intergenerational sup-\nport and coresidential living arrangements. Although par-\nent\u00adchild coresidence may be on the decline overall, it does\nnot appear to have been wholly undermined as an institu-\ntion. It rises sharply following widowhood and otherwise\nremains pervasive among relatively \"needy\" elders, such as\nthose who have a number of and severe ADL limitations.\nOur study, like others (e.g., Roan & Raley, 1996), reveals\nthe insights gained through the use of panel data. Here, we\ndelineate the attendant rise in coresidential living that fol-\nlows rather rapidly in the wake of widowhood, a change\neven more likely when the widowhood transition occurs\nconcurrently with deterioration in functional health.\nThe results presented here only begin to explore how\nhealth and other life transitions influence parent\u00adchild sup-\nport relations, specifically as captured through coresidence.\nAlthough the current analysis adds to a growing body of\nliterature on coresidence with children, there has been far\nless exploration of coresidence with grandchildren, a situa-\ntion likely to increase with the progression of population\naging and migration. We begin to explore the potential im-\npact of living with grandchildren, hypothesizing that living\nwith a grandchild might attenuate the association of child\ncoresidence with widowhood and ADLs. Grandchildren in\nthe household in most instances promote moving from non\ncoresidence to coresidence with children regardless of the\nother characteristics in place.Yet, we consider that one of our\nmost important findings is that grandchild coresidence sig-\nnificantly lessens the shift to child coresidence following the\nevent of widowhood or worsening functional health, suggest-\ning that the pull to return to provide care may be absorbed, in\npart, by the younger generation. Although tentative, our re-\nsults on grandchild coresidence suggest an alternative route\nthrough which families in China are seeing to the care of\nolder adults in need. A picture thus emerges of family altru-\nism as a product not just of one's children's decisions and\nacts but of multiple generations of family members acting\ntogether to look after the well-being of other members' needs.\nThe current study has several limitations, which should\nbe addressed in further research. First, to gain a more com-\nprehensive understanding, analyses of additional dimen-\nsions of intergenerational support to widows and widowers\n(e.g., economic exchange, instrumental support, and visits)\nare necessary (Frankenberg et al., 2002). In future work,\nadditional modules of the CLHLS can be combined to ex-\namine whether marital status transitions contribute to\nchanges in older adults' instrumental and emotional support\nrelations with children as well as changes in the net flow of\nfinancial resources between older adults and their children.\nSecond, a few words on potential bias due to survey attri-\ntion are warranted.Virtually, all panel data sets are impacted\nby some degree of attrition related to nonresponse or loss to\nfollow-up linked to migration or death. The CLHLS is no\nexception to this. However, missing data related to the ail-\ning health of respondents is addressed and practically elim-\ninated through the use of proxy respondents. The extent of\nattrition due to loss to follow-up is minor (i.e., ranging from\n9 to 12% across each of the survey intervals). Because the\nsurvey includes the oldest old, a far greater share of attrition\nacross waves occurs due to death, with a full 30\u00ad50% of\nrespondents dying between waves of CLHLS data collec-\ntion. Rather than constructing a model that controls for se-\nlectivity of attrition due to death (an approach complicated\nby the difficulty of arriving at a suitable instrumental vari-\nable that predicts mortality but not coresidence shifting), we\nnote that our analysis likely underestimates the extent of co\nresidence shifting associated with transition into widow-\nhood and worsening functional health.As shown in previous\nanalyses of survivors and decedents in the CLHLS data\n(Zimmer & Korinek, 2010), older adults who have died (an\noutcome positively correlated with widowhood and rela-\ntively poor functional health) are more likely to have shifted\ntheir coresidence situation during the survey interval than\nthose who have survived. However, these earlier analyses\nalso indicate that the determinants of coresidence shifting\nare virtually the same for survivors (those captured in the\ncurrent study) and decedents.\nAlso worthy of further exploration is the question of how\ncaregiving varies by proximity of children and other kin.\nAlthough coresidence reflects traditional arrangements and\npreferences, it is the proximity of kin and children specifi-\ncally, which matters for provision of care (Ikels, 1993;\nZimmer & Korinek, 2008). Especially as housing construc-\ntion has expanded, functions once performed by coresident\nkin may now be performed by adult children in nearby inde-\npendent households. Adult children's perspectives and the\ncompeting demands on their time and financial resources as\nopposed to those of other family members are also an im-\nportant part of the equation (Ikels, 1993). Finally, although\nlongitudinal approaches provide a much needed dynamic\nview of living arrangements in older adulthood, the line of\nquestioning and timing of survey waves in the CLHLS does\nnot provide a definitive picture of the causal ordering of\nfunctional health, marital, and living arrangement transi-\ntions. Theory serves as a useful guide, but alternative expla-\nnations and interpretations are indeed possible.\nMuch interest in the fate of China's elderly population is\nbeing generated by the overwhelming consequences of Chi-\nna's enormous social experiment initiated by its \"one-child\npolicy,\" enacted in 1979. Even the youngest elderly persons\ntheir childbearing years prior to the policy, and most have\nthree or more surviving children. Thus, analyses of the im-\npacts of the one-child policy on supports for the elderly\nmust await the aging of the 1980s childbearing cohorts and\nfuture data collection efforts. Nevertheless, conservative in-\nterpretation of the current and other similar studies implies\nthat coresidence, whether with a child or grandchild, may\ncontinue to be an important aspect of social structure for\nolder adults in China well into the future.\nCorrespondence\nCorrespondence should be addressed to Kim Korinek.
