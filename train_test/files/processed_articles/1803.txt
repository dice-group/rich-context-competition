Posner\n Key words: BMI, ethnic groups, childhood obesity,\nepidemiology, gender\nIntroduction\nThe definitions of obesity and overweight in children and\nadolescents are complex and have resulted in much confu-\nsion and controversy (1,2). Ideally, these definitions should\nbe based on their ability to predict morbidity and mortality\n(3). However, in the cases of children and adolescents, this\napproach is impractical, as most obesity comorbidities de-\nvelop later in life. Even though the long-term health con-\nsequences of obesity among adolescents have been well\ndocumented (4,5), most definitions are not based on the\npredictive value of childhood weight status. The next best\noption would be to use measurements of adiposity to clas-\nsify children and adolescents as obese, but these measure-\nments either require extensive training (e.g., skinfold thick-\nness) or expensive tools that are sometimes difficult to\ntransport to the field (e.g., DXA, air displacement plethys-\nmography, bioimpedance); thus, although reference data are\navailable, these are difficult measurements to obtain accu-\nrately and are not commonly used. Furthermore, no clear\nage- and sex-specific adiposity cut-off points are widely\nrecognized to define pediatric obesity. Therefore, BMI is\nwidely recognized as an appropriate tool to screen obese\nchildren and adolescents and to define overweight status, as\na state of excessive weight relative to height, regardless of\nbody composition (1,2,6,7). Because BMI does not measure\nbody composition and adiposity, it only is a screening tool\nto identify obesity, as defined by excessive adiposity (8).\nBMI cut-off points for sex and age have been defined either\nThe costs of publication of this article were defrayed, in part, by the payment of page\ncharges.

For example, in most emergency departments, weight\nis measured but not height. Similarly, some clinical or\nsurvey databases only include weight. In telephone surveys,\nchildren's weight can easily be measured by parents, but\nheight measurements are more difficult to obtain. These\nsituations are problematic for researchers or public health\nofficials who need to identify obese subjects in large pop-\nulations. Furthermore, reliable height measurement requires\nmore training (3) than weight measurement and may not be\neasily obtained under circumstances where resources are\nlimited and when the goal is only to identify large numbers\nof obese children and adolescents for research or public\nhealth purposes. In these circumstances where height is not\navailable, the question arises of whether weight-for-age\ncut-off points can be used to predict the likelihood of\nidentifying overweight pediatric subjects.\nLow weight-for-age is a reasonable assessment of under-\nnutrition, as children with either acute (low weight-for-\nheight) or chronic (low height-for-age) under-nutrition are\nlikely to have a low weight-for-age. However, acute and\nchronic under-nutrition cannot be differentiated by weight-\nfor-age alone and assessments of height-for-age and weight-\nfor-height are needed to distinguish these two conditions.\nLower percentile weight-for-age cut-off points have been\nrecommended by the World Health Organization to iden-\ntify under-nutrition in some situations (7). However, less\nis known about the predictive value of weight-for-age at\nthe upper end of the spectrum. Many, but not all, over-\nweight children are tall for their age because of advanced\nmaturity and puberty; and in countries in nutritional\ntransition, overweight is actually associated with short\nstature for age (11).\nThe primary aim of this study was, therefore, to assess the\npredictive value of weight-for-age to identify population\nsubgroups with large numbers of overweight children and\nadolescents (as defined by a BMI 95th percentile) (9)\nusing a representative sample of U.S. children and adoles-\ncents. Sensitivity and specificity, as well as positive and\nnegative predictive values of selected weight-for-age per-\ncentile cut-off points, were determined. The secondary aim\nwas to assess if the predictive value of these cut-off points\ndiffered between sex, age, and race/ethnicity. The aim of\nthis study was not to assess if weight-for-age cut-off points\ncould replace BMI-for-age as a screening tool for obesity, as\nit is widely recognized that BMI-for-age would perform\nbetter than weight-for-age to assess adiposity, but rather to\nprovide researchers and public health professionals with\nscreening tools to identify subpopulations likely to contain\na high proportion of overweight children and adolescents\n(with high BMI), in situations where height measurement is\nnot available. Therefore, we chose to use the Centers for\nDisease Control definition of overweight, based on BMI,\nrather than a definition of obesity based on measurements of\nadiposity for primary analyses. In secondary analyses, how-\never, the predictive values of weight-for-age cut-off points\nfor excess subcutaneous adiposity were also calculated.\nTable 1.

Children and adolescents, as\nwell as black and Mexican-American subjects, are over-\nsampled to enable analyses among these population sub-\ngroups.\nsubscapular skinfold, age, sex, and race/ethnicity were as-\nsessed in 12,382 children and adolescents between the\nages of 2 and 19 years using standardized protocols and\nequipment. For the present study, the numbers of subjects\nby sex, age groups, and racial/ethnic groups are reported in\nTable 1. Weight was measured using a Toledo digital scale\n(Mettler-Toledo, Inc., Columbus, OH) with subjects wear-\ning only underwear, disposable paper gowns, and foam\nslippers. Standing height was measured with a fixed Seca\nelectronic stadiometer (Seca GmbH & Co., Hamburg, Ger-\nmany) with a vertical backboard and a moveable headboard\n(12). Skinfold thickness was measured using a Holtain\nskinfold caliper (Holtain, Crymych, U.K.). Self-identifica-\ntion of ethnicity and race resulted in 4 categories: Mexican-\nAmerican, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and\nother. Mexican-American, non-Hispanic white, and non-\nHispanic black constituted the three racial/ethnic groups\nlarge enough to conduct subgroup analyses.\nAll analyses were conducted with Stata 8.2 (StataCorp\nLP., College Station, TX) using the survey commands (svy)\nto account for non-response and the complex sampling\nprocess used for NHANES. A p value 0.05 was consid-\nered statistically significant. BMI was calculated as weight\nin kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Subjects\nwith a BMI at or above the sex- and age-specific 95th\npercentile of the Centers for Disease Control growth charts\nwere considered overweight (9). The sum of triceps and\nsubscapular skinfolds was calculated, and overfat status was\ndefined as a sum of skinfolds at or above the sex- and\nage-specific 95th percentile of a U.S. representative popu-\nlation measured before the obesity epidemic (13), similar\nto the population used to derive the Centers for Disease\nControl BMI growth charts. Height-for-age, weight-for-age,\nand BMI-for-age z-scores were also calculated using Stata\n\"zanthro\" command and averaged. The following sex- and\nage-specific weight-for-age cut-off points were considered,\nas they represent the percentiles seen on various versions of\nthe Centers for Disease Control growth charts: 3rd, 5th,\nreference population used to derive these growth charts (9).\nFor each weight-for-age cut-off point, the following char-\nacteristics were calculated, with 95% confidence intervals:\nprevalence of subjects at or above this cut-off percentile,\nthe probability of a weight at or above the weight-for-age\ncut-off point among overweight subjects; specificity, as the\nprobability of a weight below the weight-for-age cut-off\npoint among non-overweight subjects; positive predictive\nvalue (PPV), as the probability of being overweight among\nsubjects with a weight at or above the weight-for-age cut-off\npoint; and negative predictive value (NPV), as the proba-\nbility of being non-overweight among subjects with a\nweight below the weight-for-age cut-off point (14). It\nshould be noted that sensitivity and specificity are indepen-\ndent of the prevalence of overweight in the population\nstudied, while prevalence of subjects at or above the weight-\nfor-age cut-off percentile, PPV, and NPV are dependent on\nthe prevalence of overweight in the study population and are\nThe PPV and NPV, however, can easily be calculated in a\ndifferent population with known prevalence of overweight\nusing Bayes' rule (14). For selected weight-for-age cut-off\npoints, prevalence at or above the cut-off point, sensitivity,\nspecificity, PPV, and NPV were examined for homogeneity\nbetween sexes, and among age groups, and racial/ethnic\ngroups, using the 2 test. The analyses were repeated using\noverfat status instead of overweight status as the criterion\nmethod.\nResults\nThe prevalence of overweight status is reported in\nTable 1. Overall, 15.7% of the subjects had a BMI at or at\nor above the 95th percentile (overweight), while only 7.2%\nhad a sum of skinfold thickness at or above the 95th per-\ncentile (overfat).

This is not\nsurprising, considering that tall children can have an ele-\nvated weight-for-age without being overweight and that\nshort children can have a low weight-for-age while still\nbeing overweight. This finding reinforces the recommenda-\ntion to measure height systematically to calculate, plot, and\ntrack BMI in the routine pediatric healthcare setting, as\nrecommended by the Institute of Medicine and the Centers\nfor Disease Control (2,9). Outside of the clinical setting, in\nparticular in the research, epidemiological, and public\nhealth setting, some weight-for-age percentile cut-off points\nmay, however, be useful to identify groups of children with\na high prevalence of overweight. The implications of our\nfindings for emergency care, where height is typically not\nmeasured, or for telephone surveys are more difficult to\ndefine.\nThis study shows that for situations, mostly outside of the\nclinical setting, in which height cannot be readily measured,\neliminating the possibility of calculating BMI, some of the\ncut-off points of weight-for-age can be used as initial\nscreening tools to identify subgroups of children who are\nlikely to be overweight and who should be evaluated\nthrough formal assessment of BMI. For example, if the goal\nis to ensure that most overweight children are identified\n(high sensitivity), even if the specificity is low and many\nnon-overweight children are included, the 90th weight-for-\nage percentile may provide a useful cut-off point. In con-\ntrast, if the goal is to ensure that children who are identified\nusing weight-for-age are very likely to be overweight, i.e.,\nhigh PPV, even if the sensitivity is low and many over-\nweight children are not included, the 95th and 97th percen-\ntiles may provide useful cut-off points. However, as PPV\nand NPV are dependent on the prevalence of overweight in\nthe population under study, these conclusions may not be\nvalid in every population.\nEven within the U.S. population of children and adoles-\ncents, the predictive value of various weight-for-age per-\ncentile cut-off points may differ significantly. Therefore, the\npredictive values of the 3 selected percentile cut-offs were\ncompared between subgroups of the U.S. pediatric popula-\ntion. The weight-for-age percentile cut-offs exhibited simi-\nlar characteristics between the subgroups. Even if some of\nthe subgroup comparisons were statistically significant, due\nto the large sample size, the between-group differences in\nsensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were relatively small\nwithin each weight-for-age percentile cut-off, in general\n10% between extreme values. Furthermore, with few ex-\nceptions in the extreme values, the distribution of sensitiv-\nity, specificity, PPV, and NPV between subgroups within a\nweight-for-age percentile cut-off point did not overlap with\nthe subgroup distribution within the next percentile cut-off.\nTherefore, the choice of weight-for-age percentile cut-offs\nfor various uses is unlikely to differ between the population\nsubgroups investigated here. For example, the PPV of the\n95th weight-for-age percentile cut-offs was above 74%, and\nthe PPV of the 97th percentile above 84% in every subgroup\nstudied. As the largest differences in predictive values were\nobserved between racial/ethnic groups, our findings may\nnot apply to populations with different racial/ethnic com-\nposition from the U.S. population. As expected in this\ncontemporary sample of U.S. children and adolescents, av-\nerage height-for-age, weight-for-age, and BMI-for-age z-\nscores were above 0, reflecting the secular trend in height,\nearly maturation, and the obesity epidemic.\nIn general, when using overfat status instead of over-\nweight status as criterion variable to assess the predictive\nvalue of weight-for-age percentiles, the sensitivity and spec-\nificity were lower, but in a similar range, with a maximum\ndifference of 7% between the two analyses. As expected,\nbecause the prevalence of overfat status was about half the\nprevalence of overweight status, the PPV of weight-for-age\npercentiles was much lower and the NPV much higher for\noverfat status than for overweight status.\nThis study had some limitations. For example, other\nracial/ethnic population subgroups were not studied. The\nsample size for other racial/ethnic groups is too small in\nNHANES to provide meaningful results. Analyses by sub-\ngroup of height status, i.e., comparing the predictive values\nfor short and tall children, were not performed, as the\npremise of this study was to examine use of weight-for-age\nin the absence of height measurement. Although BMI is a\ngood tool to identify overweight children and adolescents,\ndefinitions based on BMI alone clearly are not gold stan-\ndards because, in the pediatric age, body composition can\nvary greatly at similar BMI levels (15). Using the sum of\ntriceps and subscapular skinfolds at or above the 95th per-\ncentile of a reference population in secondary analyses\nprovided similar results as using the Centers for Disease\nControl definition of overweight. However, this definition\nof overfat status also has important limitations, as it ac-\ncounts only for subcutaneous fat, as skinfold thickness can\nbe difficult to measure in obese individuals, and as no\ncut-off points are widely recognized. Furthermore, unlike\nthe Centers for Disease Control BMI growth charts, the\navailable skinfold thickness percentiles that were used in the\npresent study have not been statistically smoothed (13),\nwhich may have resulted in misclassification. These limita-\ntions highlight the need for a clear and widely recognized\ndefinition of excess adiposity in the pediatric age, against\nwhich other assessment methods can be compared. This\nstudy also had unique strengths, such as the large nationally\nrepresentative sample, rigorous measurement methods, in-\nWeight-for-Age to Identify Overweight, Stettler et al.\ncluding measured rather than self-reported weight and\nheight, and the possibility of comparing various subgroups\nof the U.S. pediatric population.\nIn summary, weight-for-age percentiles cannot be used as\nsurrogates for BMI-for-age percentiles to screen for over-\nweight among children and adolescents. In the circum-\nstances where height is not available, such as existing da-\ntabases, some of the weight-for-age percentile cut-off points\ncan be used as screening tools to identify population sub-\ngroups more likely to be overweight. These cut-off points\nmay be useful in research or public health projects to\nidentify large numbers of overweight subjects but should\nnot be used clinically in individual patients.\n"
