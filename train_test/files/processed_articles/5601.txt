PCR products were assessed via UV\nvisualization of products electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels.\nResults: The groups differed significantly in genotype distributions (p < 0.05). The primary knee OA group showed a\nconsiderably higher incidence of the DD genotype and the D allele compared to the control group (OR = 2.14, 95% CI:\nConclusion: The ACE gene polymorphism I28005D was found to be associated with primary knee OA in Asian Indian\npopulations.

The I allele has been associated with certain\naspects of endurance performance and functionally asso-\nciated with reduced ACE serum levels and activity.1,2 The\nsize and is located on chromosome 17q23.3. The I allele\nrepeat sequence that is absent from the D allele, resulting\nin II, ID, and DD genotypes.3 The D allele has been shown\nto be associated with higher levels of circulatory ACE\nenzyme in a dose-dependent manner. Despite being an\nintronic variation, it accounts for approximately half of\nthe observed variance in plasma levels of the ACE pro-\ntein.4 The role of ACE polymorphism has been investi-\ngated as a risk factor for several diseases. Worldwide\nestimates indicate that 9.6% of men and 18% of women of\n60 years of age have symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA).\npolymorphism of the angiotensin\nI converting enzyme gene is a\nrisk factor for osteoarthritis\nin an Asian Indian population\nSubhadra Poornima1, Krishna Subramanyam2, Imran Ali Khan3\nand Qurratulain Hasan1*\n Keywords\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), Asian Indian population, I28005D gene polymorphism, osteoarthritis\nDepartment of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Kamineni Hospitals,\nHyderabad, India\n2Department of Orthopedics, Kamineni Hospitals, Hyderabad, India\nDepartment of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical\nSciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nCorresponding author:\nQurratulain Hasan, Department of Genetics and Molecular Medicine,\nOriginal Article\nOA is a multifactorial disease and is the most common\nform of arthritis with a clear genetic component, affecting\n40% of individuals across age groups; it is also one of the\nmost common disabling diseases worldwide.5 It is charac-\nterized by the progressive loss of articular cartilage in the\nsynovial joints and changes in the adjacent bone.6 OA is a\npolygenic disease and its pathogenesis is influenced by\nseveral environmental factors such as ageing, hormones,\nmechanical factors, and lifestyle. Results of family-based\nand candidate gene studies have demonstrated that a\ngenetic component is implicated in its pathophysiology.7\nACE is a candidate gene for the development of OA, and it\nis known to play an important role in several inflammatory\nand immune-related disorders. ACE polymorphisms have\nbeen shown to be related to rheumatic and autoimmune\ndiseases in particular.8,9 Based on these prior studies, we\nhypothesized that studies of ACE in OA patients could be\nused for determining the risk factors involved in the patho-\ngenesis of this disease. To improve our understanding of\nthe importance ofACE in the pathology of OA, we directly\ninvestigated the I28005D polymorphism of the ACE gene\nin OA patients from an Asian Indian population.\nMaterials and methods\nEthics\nEthical approval (KHL No. e374/07) for this research\nwas obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee,\nHyderabad, India.\nAssortment of subjects\nDepartment of Orthopedics, Kamineni Hospitals,\nHyderabad, India who were clinically and radiologically\ndiagnosed with primary knee OA based on the criteria that\nder-matched healthy controls with no history of OA or any\ncomplications of metabolic disorders.\nCollection of blood\nTwo milliliters of venous blood was collected in EDTA\nvacutainers from each subject (n = 200). Personal and fam-\nily histories were taken simultaneously using a well-\ndesigned proforma.\nGenotyping of polymorphism\nGenomic DNA was isolated from blood samples using a\nsalting-out technique. For DNA extraction, EDTA (300\n\u00b5L) was added to the blood, and further dissolved in 50 \u00b5L\nof tris-EDTA buffer.11 The quality of the isolated genomic\nDNA was quantified using a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo\nFisher Scientific, MA, and USA). The oligonucleotide\nsequences of the PCR primers for the I28005D alleles\nwere selected from our previous studies, which had been\nperformed in the same population.11,12 Genotyping for the\ndirect PCR, and successful amplification was confirmed\nby electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. PCR reactions\nwere performed in a thermal cycler, with initial denatura-\ntion at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 35 amplification\ncycles, each of which consisted of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for\ncated that the allele contained the 287-bp Alu sequence;\ndetection of a 190-bp band indicated the short allele, which\ndoes not contain the Alu sequence. Individuals with both\nidentified as heterozygotes (Figure 1). Genotype frag-\nments were imaged using a gel documentation system\n(Kamineni Life Sciences, Moula Ali, Hyderabad, India).\nStatistical analysis\nAssociations between genotype and OA were examined\nby odds ratio analysis, with 95% confidence intervals\n(CIs) and chi-square analysis, using the software OpenEpi.\nThe allele frequencies of the ACE gene were tested to\ndetermine whether they were in Hardy\u00adWeinberg equilib-\nrium (HWE). Allelic frequencies were calculated accord-\ning to the number of different alleles observed and the\nFigure 1.

In controls, the genotype\nwhereas in OA patients, the distribution was 18% (I/I),\n38% (I/D), and 44% (D/D). Significant variation was\nobserved in the distribution of the D allele (OR = 2.08,\ncompared to the control subjects. The D allele was signifi-\ncantly associated with the disease according to the domi-\nrecessive models of inheritance (OR = 2.78, 95% CI:\nOA, and the obese population is more prone to the disease\n(Figure 2(a)). Hence, the study group was categorized as\nobese (>30 BMI) based on BMI. The prevalence of the D\nallele was higher in OA cases compared to controls, as\nshown in Table 3 (Figure 2(b)).\nBoth overweight and obese individuals with the D allele\nwere more prone to OA. The controls did not show any\nassociation between BMI and genotype (Figure 3(a) and\n(b)). Neither allele nor genotype showed an association\nshown in Table 4 (see also Figure 3(c)).\nOther confounding factors, such as hypertension, type 2\ndiabetes mellitus (T2DM), and thyroid dysregulation were\nalso investigated, and it was found that hypertensive indi-\nviduals are more prone to OA.\nDiscussion\nSevere OA is a cause of social, economic, and personal\nburden, and is the main cause of an increasing need for\nknee joint replacement.

The biological mechanism of ACE\nhas been shown to involve a metalloenzyme that converts\nangiotensin I to a potent vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II,\nand inactivates bradykinin, which is a vasodilator of the\nkallikrein\u00adkinin system and has major implications in\ninflammatory processes including OA.8 The RAS has been\nshown to be involved in the pathogenesis of several dis-\neases, including fibrosis in the heart, kidney, lung, and\nliver during chronic inflammation, through regulation of\ncell growth, inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to\nassess the association of polymorphisms of the ACE gene\nI28005D with OA in an Asian Indian population.

We have previously reported an asso-\nciation of ACE polymorphism with T2DM with neuropa-\nthy and gestational diabetes.11,12 Narne et al. showed that it\nis associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and myo-\ncardial infarction (MI),15 Ganesan et al. showed an asso-\nciation with CAD and T2DM,16 and Reddy et al. showed a\nsignificant association between MI and the DD genotype\nin our population.17\nBecause weight and BMI primarily affect the knee joint,\nwe categorized the OA cases into normal, overweight, and\nobese groups, based on BMI. It was observed that 68% of\nOA cases were obese and 26% were overweight.

Our data indi-\ncated that the D allele potentiates the effect of BMI in both\noverweight and obese patients. We observed that >80% of\noverweight and obese patients possessed the D allele,\nwhereas all patients with a normal BMI possessed the del-\neterious allele.

In conclusion, angiotensin I converting\nenzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism is associated with\nprimary knee OA in Asian Indian populations.\n"
