Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic blacks were over-\nsampled to produce reliable estimates for these groups.\nMain Outcome Measures.--Episodes of weekly vigorous activity and daily\nhours of television watched, and their relationship to body mass index and body\nfatness.\nResults.--Eighty percent of US children reported performing 3 or more bouts of\nvigorous activity each week. This rate was lower in non-Hispanic black and Mexi-\ncan American girls (69% and 73%, respectively). Twenty percent of US children\nparticipatedin2orfewerboutsofvigorousactivityperweek,andtheratewashigher\nin girls (26%) than in boys (17%). Overall, 26% of US children watched 4 or more\nhours of television per day and 67% watched at least 2 hours per day. Non-Hispanic\nblack children had the highest rates of watching 4 or more hours of television per\nday (42%). Boys and girls who watch 4 or more hours of television each day had\ngreater body fat (P.001) and had a greater body mass index (P.001) than those\nwho watched less than 2 hours per day.\nConclusions.--Many US children watch a great deal of television and are inad-\nequately vigorously active.

Increasingly, leisure time ac-\ntivities are more sedentary, with televi-\nsionwatching,videogames,andpersonal\ncomputing among the most popular pas-\ntimes. Further, people in industrialized\ncountries are expending less energy in\nactivities of daily living, and at work.6,7\nSeveral studies suggest that an active\nlifestyle during childhood and adoles-\ncence can play an important role in op-\ntimizinggrowthanddevelopment.7,8 The\nCentersforDiseaseControlandPreven-\ntion recently recommended that com-\nprehensive school and community pro-\ngrams be developed to promote physical\nactivity among children and adoles-\ncents.9 The goals of these programs are\ntoincreaseknowledgeaboutactivityand\nexercise, develop behavioral and motor\nskills that promote lifelong activity, and\nencourage physical activity outside of\nphysical education classes.\nUsingdatafromNHANESIII,thisar-\nticleprovidesestimatesofdailytelevision\nwatching habits and weekly bouts of vig-\norousphysicalactivityinanationallyrep-\nresentative sample of US children aged 8\nthrough 16 years.

The plan and operation of\nNHANES III have been described else-\nsigned to produce a nationally represen-\ntative sample of the US population. One\nof its main goals was to estimate the na-\ntional prevalence of selected health con-\nditions and risk factors.\nTheNHANESIIIrepresentsa6-year\nconstitutes a national survey, the sur-\nveywasdesignedsothateachphasewas\nalso a nationally representative sample.\nThe NHANES III oversampled Mexi-\ncanAmericans,non-Hispanicblacks,and\nyoung children to ensure weighted, re-\nliable estimates for these groups. Ap-\nproximately 16 % of those interviewed\nranged in age from 8 through 16 years.\nCombined data from phases I and II are\nreported in this article.\nThe interview was conducted in the\nchild's home and a detailed clinical exami-\nnation was performed in a mobile exami-\nnation center.

Interview forms were available\nin both languages. All staff attended\nyearly training sessions to ensure main-\ntenance of effective interviewing skills.\nInformation on self-reported race and\nethnicity was used to classify persons as\nnon-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,\nor Mexican American (persons of Mexi-\ncan origin living in the United States).\nAge was defined as age in years at the\ntime of the household interview, which\nprecededtheexaminationby2to3weeks.\nDependent Variables\nParticipating children were asked how\nmany times per week they \"played or ex-\nercised enough to make them sweat or\nbreathehard.\"Theseactivitiesdidnotex-\ncludeschool-relatedinvolvementssuchas\nphysical education.

Multi-\nvariate analyses revealed no interaction\nbetween television watching and physi-\ncalactivity.Furthermore,significantef-\nfects were seen for television watching\nbut not for physical activity.\nCOMMENT\nWe found that US children are cur-\nrently more active than their adult coun-\nterparts, with almost 80% reporting 3 or\nmore bouts of vigorous activity each\nweek.16 However, there are several wor-\nrisome trends among adolescent females\nand ethnic minority groups. Of concern,\n26% of all girls and 31% of non-Hispanic\nblack girls report 2 or fewer bouts of vig-\norous activity per week. Our data recon-\nfirm that vigorous activity among ethnic\nminority children is lower than in non-\nHispanicwhitechildren.17,18 Suchinforma-\ntionmustbeconsideredwhendeveloping\nphysical education curricula and commu-\nnity-based intervention strategies aimed\nat increasing physical activity among dif-\nferent target populations.\nOneoftheobjectivesofHealthyPeople\n2000 is to increase vigorous physical ac-\ntivity to at least 3 days per week for 20\nminutes or more per occasion in at least\nall ages appear to be meeting this crite-\nrion. However, a decrease in physical ac-\ntivity seems to occur as girls move from\nfewer bouts of vigorous physical activity\neach week. These data are consistent\nSurvey - Youth Risk Behavior Survey,\nwhich reported that 8.7 % of 15- year-old\nfemalesreportednoparticipationinmod-\nerate or vigorous activity,16 and that\ntary.Malina20 hassuggestedthattheado-\nlescent decline in physical activity that\noccursafterthegrowthspurtisprobably\nrelated to the social demands of adoles-\ncence, changing interests and the transi-\ntion from school to work or school to col-\nlege. However, the level of physical ac-\ntivity in our study may be optimistically\nhigh because children who lived in north-\nernstatesweresurveyedduringthesum-\nmerwhenphysicalactivityisknowntobe\nat its peak. Furthermore, the question\nabout physical activity did not assess\nmoderateactivityordurationofvigorous\nactivity, so a brief bout of vigorous activ-\nity could have been reported as a single\nbout of exercise.\nBecause a sedentary lifestyle is con-\nsidered a risk factor for coronary artery\ndisease,21 parents and health care pro-\nfessionals need to encourage adolescent\nfemales in particular to maintain active\nlifestyles throughout adolescence. The\nInternational Consensus Conference on\nPhysical Activity Guidelines for Adoles-\ncents recommends that \"all adoles-\ncents . . . be physically active daily, or\nnearly every day, as part of play, games,\nsports,work,transportation,recreation,\nphysical education, or planned exercise,\nin the context of family, school, and com-\nmunity activities\" and that \"adolescents\nengage in three or more sessions per\nweek of activities that last 20 minutes or\nTable 2.--Unadjusted andAge-Specific Prevalence (per 100) of Hours of Television Watched per DayAmong\nPopulation Group,\nSample\nSize, No.\nPrevalence (SE)\nNon-Hispanic white\nNon-Hispanic black\nMexican American\nBMI, kg/m2\nBoys\n\nSessions of Vigorous Activity per Week\nGirls\nSum of Trunk Skinfolds, mm\nSessions of Vigorous Activity per Week\nFigure 1.--Mean body mass index (BMI) (A) and the mean sum of the subscapular and suprailiac skinfolds\n(B) in relation to the number of vigorous activity sessions completed weekly among US children aged 8 to\n\u00a91998 American Medical Association.

This information may partially ex-\nplain the lower bouts of vigorous activity\nandhigherprevalenceoftelevisionwatch-\ning reported in non-Hispanic black and\nMexican American children. Successful\nimplementation of policies to address this\nproblem may help to increase physical ac-\ntivity in these 2 groups. For example,\nneighborhood watch programs and in-\ncreased policing in high crime areas may\nhelp alleviate fears and foster an environ-\nment where parents feel it is safefor their\nchildren to play. Furthermore, Healthy\nnityavailabilityandaccessibilityofphysi-\ncal activity and fitness facilities.19 Thus,\nstudies that specifically attempt to pro-\nmote enjoyable, lifetime activities among\nethnic minorities should receive high pri-\nority in the public health arena.\nTroiano and colleagues1 reported that\nthe prevalence of overweight is increas-\ning among boys and girls of all age groups\nand suggested increasing physical activ-\nity as a means to address this important\nhealth problem. Physical activity is in-\nverselyrelatedtobodyweight,bodycom-\nposition, and the waist-to-hip ratio in\nadults. Sedentary leisure time activities\nsuchastelevisionwatching,playingvideo\ngames,andpersonalcomputinghavecon-\ntributed to the increasing prevalence of\nshows that television watching was asso-\nciated with increased skinfold thickness\nand BMI among US youth.\nOverall, we found high rates of televi-\nsion watching, with 26% of US children\n(and43%ofnon-Hispanicblackchildren)\nwatching 4 or more hours per day.\nStrasburger28 hascalculatedthattheav-\nerage high school graduate will likely\nNexttosleeping,televisionwatchingoc-\ncupies the greatest amount of leisure\ntime during childhood.27 We found that\nskinfold thicknesses increased in both\nboys and girls as the amount of televi-\nsion watched increased. This finding is\nconsistent with an earlier study that\nfound a significant relationship between\ntelevision watching and the prevalence\nof obesity in children.26\nWe also found a relationship between\ntelevision watching, physical activity,\nand body composition. Children who\nwatched more television and were less\nlikely to participate in vigorous activity\ntended to have higher BMIs. This is con-\nsistent with the findings of Durant et\nal.29 Two studies have reported strong\ninverserelationshipsbetweentelevision\nwatchingandphysicalactivityaftertele-\nvisionwasintroducedintosmallcommu-\nnities in Canada30 and Scotland.31 Addi-\ntionalresearchisneededtofurtheriden-\ntifytypesofphysicalactivitiesthatcould\nserveasalternativeactivities,especially\nfor minority children, among whom tele-\nvision watching is greatest. Studies\namongpersonsoflowsocioeconomicsta-\ntusandamongcertainracialgroupshave\ndemonstratedspecificdeterminantsand\nactivity preferences. This information\nhas been used to effectively tailor cul-\nturally appropriate physical activity\npromotion programs.\nCurrently, 45% of Mexican American\nand 49% of non-Hispanic black adult\nwomen are overweight.2 Low levels of\nvigorous activity and increased televi-\nBMI, kg/m2\n \nBoys\n\n \n\n\n\nHours of Television Watched per Day\nGirls\nSum of Trunk Skinfolds, mm\nHours of Television Watched per Day\nFigure 2.--Mean body mass index (BMI) (A) and the mean sum of the subscapular and suprailiac skinfolds\nAsterisk indicates significantly greater (P.001) than the less than 2-hour group; dagger indicates signifi-\ncantly greater (P.001) than the 2- to 3-hour group.\nHigh\nMiddle Low\nLow\nHigh\nMiddle\nThirds of TVW\nBMI, Boys\nThirds of VA\nHigh\nMiddle Low\nLow\nHigh\nMiddle\nThirds of TVW\nThirds of VA\nHigh Middle Low\nLow\nHigh\nMiddle\nThirds of TVW\nThirds of VA\nHigh\nMiddle Low\nLow\nHigh\nMiddle\nThirds of TVW\nThirds of VA\nBMI, Girls\nSum\nof TS,\nmm\nSum\nof TS,\nmm\nSum\nof TS,\nmm\nSum\nof TS,\nmm\nSum of Trunk Skinfolds, Boys\nSum of Trunk Skinfolds, Girls\nA\nC\nB\nD\nFigure 3.--Mean body mass index (BMI) (A, B) and the sum of the subscapular and suprailiac skinfolds (C,\nD) by combinations of daily hours of television watched (TVW) and weekly sessions of vigorous play or ex-\n\u00a91998 American Medical Association.

This under-\nscores the work of Epstein and col-\nleagues,37 who reported that decreasing\nsedentary behaviors is a key ingredient\nto the successful treatment of childhood\nobesity. Moreover, repeated exposure to\ntelevision commercials for food may\nprompt children to increase food con-\nsumption, which ultimately leads to\nweight gain.38 Sedentary activities that\nare regularly associated with eating also\ncan become conditioned cues for eating,\nsuch that a child who is not hungry and\nbegins television watching may find that\nthe television watching cues eating.39\nFor young people, learning to be\nphysically active may be a more potent\nmotivator for physical activity than the\nknowledge about why being physically\nactive is important.40,41 Health care pro-\nfessionals,parents,andeducatorsshould\nencourage children and adolescents to\nbe active before, during, and after the\nschool day. Recent guidelines for the\npromotion of lifelong physical activity\nrecommend that health care profession-\nals routinely assess levels of physical ac-\ntivityintheiryoungpatients.Physicians\ncan play a key role in encouraging sed-\nentary children and their families to\nadopt more active lifestyles.42,43 Inactive\nchildren and adolescents should be\nguidedtowardschoolorcommunitypro-\ngrams that encourage physical activity.\nChildren and adolescents who regularly\nparticipateinphysicalactivityshouldbe\nencouraged to continue and maintain\ntheir active ways.\nIn summary, although many American\nchildren (80%) are regularly active, rates\nof inactivity among adolescent girls, non-\nHispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans\nare cause for concern. One quarter of all\nUSchildrenwatch4ormorehoursoftele-\nvisioneachday,asdo43%ofnon-Hispanic\nblacks.Hoursoftelevisionwatchingisre-\nlated to both BMI and skinfold thickness.\nPhysicians and other health care profes-\nsionals should counsel children and their\ncaregivers on the importance of regular\nphysical activity and decreasing seden-\ntary activities. Intervention strategies\ndesigned to promote lifetime physical ac-\ntivity represent a major public health\nchallenge and priority.\nThe authors thank Ellen Smit, PhD, of the Johns\nHopkins School of Public Health for expert analyti-\ncal assistance and advice.\nReferences\n1.
