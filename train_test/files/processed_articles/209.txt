Unfortu-\nnately, no proper study is now available to deter-\nmine whether the conjectures of a Delphi panel are\ncorrect. Regardless, in the opinion of many, these\nreports are sobering enough to warrant the perform-\nance of properly designed large-scale multicenter\nclinical studies to determine the exact indications\nfor endarterectomy and the maximal complication\nrate permissible for benefit to exceed risk.\nReferences\n1.
