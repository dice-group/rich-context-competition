He noted that in many parts of\nthe world, girls and women are so much more likely to be neglected, abused and even\nkilled that female life expectancy is much lower than it is for boys and men. As a result, by\nhis estimate, 100 million women who would have been alive - had males and females\nreceived\" roughly similar treatment in matters of life and death\" - were dead.\nSince 1990, the spread of new technologies has granted progressively easier and\nearlier sex-determination of fetuses, paving the way for sex-specific abortion. Pre-\nimplantation genetic diagnosis and sperm sorting now also make sex selection via In-Vitro\nAsia's missing women\nFertilization possible, raising the prospect of even more efficient son selection in the near\nfuture.\nThe immense human tragedy of neglect, infanticide and unnecessary abortion\nmakes Asia's missing women one of the most pressing humanitarian issues of our time. But\nthat is only half the story. The profoundly male-biased sex ratios leave millions of young\nmen unable to find a mate or have a family, causing problems of crime, human trafficking\nand violence that threaten the cohesion and security of entire regions (Edlund, Li, Yi, and\nIn this article I argue that evolutionary theory offers important insights into both the\norigins and the consequences of this \"missing women\" problem. Asia's missing women\nare, in economic terms, an aggregate outcome of millions of parenting decisions. The\nindividual drivers behind those decisions emerge from interactions between our evolved\nparenting preferences and social and economic circumstances. Applied evolutionary\npsychology must take its place alongside economics and sociology if this complex problem\nand its tragic consequences are ever to be mitigated (Brooks, 2011).\nScope of the Problem\nBirth sex ratios in societies without sex-biased abortion consistently sit between 105\nages, this ratio drops to about 101.6 males per 100 females because boys and men generally\nexperience greater mortality in childhood, adolescence and early adulthood, than girls and\nwomen.\nIn countries where girls and women enjoy the same health care and food and in\nwhich they are not aborted, killed, or neglected as a consequence of their sex, population\nsex ratios vary between even (100) and very slightly female biased (98). But across large\nparts of North Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia, population sex ratios are\nstrikingly male-biased. By comparing national sex ratio data with data from countries\nwhere women enjoy more equitable circumstances, it is possible to infer the number of\n\"missing\" women and girls - females who should be alive but are not. Hesketh and Xing\n(2006) estimate that between 67 and 92 million females are missing in total from just eight\nmillion) and South Korea (0.2-0.3 million). In figure 1, I show the sex ratio bias in these\ncountries relative to the rest of the world, for the most male-biased cohort \u00ad infants and\nchildren.\nCauses of Biased Sex Ratios\nSex biases can arise due to unequal rates of male and female conception, unequal\nprobabilities of fetuses being carried to term, and unequal age-specific survival rates. At\neach of these stages, inequalities can be introduced via parental behavior, but other factors\nsuch as disease also play a role.\nAsia's missing women\nFigure 1. Childhood sex ratios in eight countries responsible for the largest number of\nmissing women and girls, compared with the childhood sex ratio for the rest of the world\n(dashed line)\nNote: Data from CIA World Factbook.\nSome diseases alter the probability of a woman giving birth to a boy or girl.\nInfection with the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, for example, can cause sex ratios\n150 boys are born for every 100 girls to mothers with Hepatitis B. The economist Emily\nOster (2005) suggested that Hepatitis B infection rates might explain as much as half of the\n\"missing women\", but she has since admitted that she was wrong about the potential for\nHepatitis B infection rates to explain a large proportion of Asia's missing women, based on\nbetter estimates of the effects of Hepatitis B infection on sex ratios (Oster, Chen, Yu, and\nThroughout the region where population sex ratios are so strikingly male biased,\nparents express very strong son preferences (Hesketh and Xing, 2006), and the lives of\nwomen and girls are often less valued by both families and communities as a whole than\nthey are in other parts of the world (Bandyopadhyay, 2003; Hesketh and Xing, 2006).\nSon preferences can bias the sex ratio toward males in a number of ways. Most\nAsia's missing women\ndramatically, female infants are sometimes killed at birth upon the wishes of the parents or\ntheir family. But the systematic neglect of daughters and women whose families don't feed,\nimmunize, seek medical attention and care for them as well as they do for brothers and\nhusbands has long been the main cause of elevated female mortality (Hesketh and Xing,\nIn the last three decades, differences in male and female mortality have shrunk in\nmost of the countries concerned, probably due to improved sanitation and childhood\nhealthcare (Hesketh and Xing, 2006; Zhu, Lu, and Hesketh, 2009). But in India, China, and\nSouth Korea, these gains have been undone by other losses. Since the advent of\namniocentesis in the mid-1970s and the spread of affordable ultrasound mid-1980s - both\ntechnologies that allowed pre-natal sex testing - sex-specific abortion has become a major\ndriver of contemporary skews in birth sex ratios (Das Gupta et al., 2003; Hesketh and Xing,\nIn India, the phenomenon is referred to as \"female feticide\" in English and khanya\nbhronn hatya (literally \"the killing of young girls\") in Hindi (Goldberg, 2010). Although\nabortion is a legal means to ending unwanted pregnancies in India, the law prohibits\nabortion for sex selection, mandating up to 10 years imprisonment (Sudha and Irudaya,\n1999), but there has never been a successful prosecution (Bandyopadhyay, 2003). Reports\nof fetuses aborted at clinics suggest that well over 99 percent of them are female (Goldberg,\nIn India and China, sex-biased abortion usually manifests in the second and\nsubsequent parity after the birth of a daughter (Hesketh and Xing, 2006; Zhu et al., 2009).\nFamilies let nature take its course for the first child, but become less likely to do so at\nhigher parities. When in the past child-bearing continued until the desired number of sons\nhad been born, declining fertilities (due to urbanization, the fertility decline phase of the\ndemographic transition, and, in the Chinese case, the one-child policy) place greater\nurgency on selecting the sex of the second and subsequent children.\nEvolutionary Theories of Son Preferences\nEvolutionary theory can help us understand why son preferences are so strong in\nsocieties like India, China, and South Korea, and how social and economic factors lead\nboth to the expression of strong son preferences and the under-valuation of girls and\nwomen. Selection has driven the evolution of a deep parental devotion to the safety and\nwelfare of offspring (Hrdy, 2009). Yet humans are capable of both infanticide and lethal\nneglect of their own genetic offspring, and there are a number of adaptive reasons that\nSelection usually acts to equalize parental investment in the sexes (Fisher, 1930).\nBecause every offspring has exactly one father and one mother, the total number of\noffspring sired by males always equals the total number borne by females. This is the\nFisher condition, and under most circumstances it mandates that negative frequency\ndependent selection will favor any mechanisms that bias parents toward rearing and caring\nfor the rarer sex, restoring the sex ratio to approximate parity (see Jennions and Kokko,\nAsia's missing women\nEven though the population-wide aggregate effect of selection should be for parents\nto invest equally in sons and daughters, under some circumstances parental biases toward\nbearing or investing in offspring of one sex rather than the other might be adaptive. These\nadaptive scenarios fall into three categories: local competition, local resource enhancement,\nand the Trivers-Willard effect.\nWhen one sex does not disperse far from their natal range, same-sex relatives can\ncompete for local resources such as mates, territories or food. Hamilton (1967) first argued\nthat under these circumstances, selection would favor those parents who invested more in\nthe dispersing sex and less in the philopatric sex in order to avoid local competition among\nrelatives. Female parasitoid wasps, for example, lay mostly female (i.e., fertilized) eggs\nwhen they are first to parasitize a host and her sons are likely to compete only among\nthemselves. But the second and subsequent females that lay on a host increase the number\nof male (i.e., unfertilized) eggs they lay (e.g., Werren, 1980).\nLocal resource enhancement occurs when offspring of the philopatric sex help the\nparents to defend their territories and rear offspring, providing fitness returns both through\ntheir own reproduction and by directly enhancing the parents' reproductive success. In\nmany cooperatively breeding bird species, sons stay in their natal territory and help their\nparents breed. Under such circumstances, parents adaptively bias their investments toward\nsons (Emlen, Emlen, and Levin, 1986) creating male-biased adult sex ratios.\nThe third adaptive pathway to sex ratio bias was outlined forty years ago by Bob\nTrivers and Dan Willard (1973). They noted that the human practice of hypergyny (women\nmarrying into families wealthier than their natal families) could make the benefits of\ninvesting in sons and daughters dependent on wealth. The stronger the hypergyny, the more\nsexual competition girls from the wealthiest families would face from less wealthy\ncontemporaries to mate with the few wealthy eligible men. At the other end of the\nspectrum, daughters from poor families have more options to marry upward into slightly\nwealthier families, whereas their brothers have fewer prospects of starting a family of their\nown. Trivers and Willard predicted that wealthy parents that bias conception or the\ninvestments they make in care toward sons, and the poorest families that conceive or invest\nmore in daughters would enjoy greater fitness returns than similar parents who invested\nequally in daughters and sons.\nThey predicted that in those mammals in which males compete to be among the few\nwinners who win a harem or territory and thereby enjoy a paternity bonanza, a pregnant\nmother's condition might influence the size, strength and thus the fitness prospects of her\nsons more than it alters the prospects of her daughters. In such species, mothers in good\ncondition should produce more sons and invest more in post-natal care (e.g. lactation) when\nthey have a son than a daughter. This prediction has been verified in a large number of\nmammal species (see Cameron, 2004a for review; Wild and West, 2007). The predictions\nare also often upheld in studies of humans living in historic (Voland, 1984; Voland and\nDunbar, 1995) societies and in contemporary industrialized (Cameron and Dalerum, 2009)\nand subsistence farming (Pollet, Fawcett, Buunk, and Nettle, 2009) societies.\nAsia's missing women\nPatrilineal patrilocality\nMuch of the literature on Asia's missing women considers factors special to each\ncountry. Those circumstances peculiar to each country (e.g. Indian dowries and Chinese\none-child policy) have given each a unique trajectory, but as Das Gupta et al. (2003) argue,\n\"the striking similarities in patterns of son preference stem from commonalities in the\nkinship systems in these [countries]\". These shared kinship features are the key to\nunderstanding son preferences, gender inequality, and the observed sex ratio biases. They\ndo so in ways that are consistent with local resource enhancement and Trivers-Willard\ntheories for the adaptive biasing of sex ratios.\nDas Gupta et al. (2003) argue that Han Chinese, Northern and Northwest Indian,\nand South Korean societies, while different, are all among the most rigidly patrilineal\nsocieties in their organization and patrilocal in their spatial structure. In each of these\nsocieties, it is highly unusual for daughters to inherit land. And the patriline is crucial in\nimportant funerary rites in North-west India and in ancestor worship in Korea and China\nPatriliny is reinforced by patrilocality, with women leaving both their home and\ntheir lineage to marry, whereupon they are absorbed into their husband's lineage and their\nniche in their natal lineage ceases to exist. According to Das Gupta et al. (2003), \"Thus it is\nthat only men constitute the social order, and women are the means whereby men\nreproduce themselves\".\nPatrilocality leaves newlywed women without allies once they move into their\nconjugal village - often into a home populated by their husband's parents and brothers. It is\nthe sons and their wives who support and care for parents in their old age. And women only\never rise to positions of prestige and prominence as the mothers of sons (Das Gupta et al.,\n2003). The mother's power and influence depends on the sons' loyalty to her, over and\nabove his loyalty to his wife or either's relationship with his unmarried sisters.\n\"Unfortunately, the successful self-assertion of women in a such a kinship system is at the\nexpense of younger women, which helps perpetuate the cycle of female subordination\"\nIn general, women in matrilocal societies tend to enjoy greater autonomy, more\npower within the home and society, lower levels of violence and spousal abuse, and more\nopportunity to do visible work outside the home than women in patrilocal societies (Hrdy,\n2009). These differences manifest not only at national levels, but also among ethnic groups,\nbetween regions, and, presumably, among clans, families and individuals. In non-Han\nChinese minorities, for example, where kinship is less rigidly patrilineal, son preferences\nare weaker or not detectable (Hua, 2001).\nIn India, population and especially childhood sex ratios are most dramatically male-\nbiased in the northern and northwestern regions (Chandramouli, 2011; see Figure 2) and\nleast male-biased in southern regions (like Kerala), some central states (notably\nChhattisgarh) and the northeast (e.g., Arunachal Pradesh).\nAsia's missing women\nFigure 2. Sex ratio for children 0 to 6 years in age in Indian States and Territories\nNote: Data come from the 2011 Indian Census.\nIn general, North and Northwest India have historically been wheat-based agrarian\neconomies with higher fertilities and more developed dowry customs than in the central,\nnortheastern and southern regions (Bandyopadhyay, 2003). Throughout India, a newlywed\ncouple is more likely to settle near to the man's parents and other relatives, but this\nAsia's missing women\npatrilocality is much more pronounced in the North and Northwest where the movement of\nbrides between villages is also less likely to be reciprocal than in the South (Das Gupta et\nal.; Hudson and den Boer, 2004). Thus, new brides move a considerable distance into a\nvillage where they know nobody and have no allies, but live close to the groom's parents\nand male relatives who prosecute his interests at the expense of hers. In these male-\ndominated economies, women are less educated, experience lower status, and are more\noften secluded than in the other regions.\nIn the southern and eastern regions, women generally enjoy more status, better\neducation, higher literacy and better healthcare as well as more prominent roles in the rice-\nbased agrarian economy (Bandyopadhyay, 2003; Das Gupta et al.; Hudson and den Boer,\n2004). Brides move shorter distances from their natal villages to marry, have more\nopportunities to return to their natal villages, and maintain mutually supportive\nrelationships with their parents. Kerala is also notable for its history of educating girls and\nfor its matrilineal inheritance system among some castes (Sen, 1990). All of these\ndifferences make for weaker son preferences by reducing the difference in value between a\ndaughter and a son, and for overall less rigid construction of gender in South Indian kinship\nExtreme patrilineal customs and patrilocal living, when they arise, tend to reinforce\none another and consistently marginalize and devalue women and girls. But can\nevolutionary theory reveal any useful insights into how this occurs?\nThe broad patterns are certainly not consistent with Hamilton's (1967) ideas about\nlocal competition for mates or other resources. The dispersing sex, females, is\ndiscriminated against. Instead, the pattern is consistent with local resource enhancement as\nthe sex that remains close to the parents is favored and outnumbers the dispersing sex. Sons\nalso deliver direct benefits to the parents in terms of status, economic support and\nlegitimacy through funerary and ancestor worship customs. Thus far, we know of no\nattempts to measure the economic or fitness benefits of having sons versus daughters\nwithin the framework of Hamilton's (1967) local resource enhancement hypothesis.\nWealth and Urbanization\nThe strength of son preferences in India is also linked to the intensity of hypergamy\nand the relative wealth of parents. Dickemann (1979b) suggested, on the basis of evidence\nthat early colonial female infanticide was practiced largely by the highest castes and\nwealthiest families, that historic son preferences and male-biased sex ratios may have\noriginated from the kind of wealth- or state-dependent selection first proposed by Trivers\nA similar dynamic may be at play in modern India and elsewhere. In addition to the\nNorth/Northwest versus South/East divide, rural Indian sex ratio is less male-biased than in\nwealth significantly predicts the odds of having a son in contemporary India. Both before\nand after the spread of ultrasound, the odds of having a son rose with socioeconomic status,\nbut this effect of wealth has become much stronger in the post-ultrasound period as\nAsia's missing women\ntechnology made it easier for parents to discriminate by aborting female fetuses\nThe importance of wealth and urban living as determinants of Indian sex ratio\nbiases might be understood simply as urban and wealthy families having the best access to\nsex-determination and abortion clinics. Furthermore, both wealth and urbanization depress\nfertility, and so the need to have at least one son early on is more pressing in urban and rich\nfamilies. On the other hand, one might also expect wealthy and urbanized families to have\nmore progressive attitudes regarding gender, and for their daughters to have employment\nprospects more similar to those of their brothers than daughters of rural and poor families.\nThe Hindu caste system and associated marriage practices might also contribute to\nthe higher rates of sex-bias in urban and relatively wealthy families. Making a good\nmarriage for one's daughter is an important source of social prestige (Rao, 1993; Roulet,\n1996). India's Hindu caste system virtually enforces hypergyny, with the mere idea of a\nyoung woman marrying a man of lower sub-caste considered unacceptable (Dickemann,\n1979b). It is also desirable, in making a good marriage, to marry into a wealthier family. As\na result of this double-barreled hypergyny, the marriage prospects of girls born into wealthy\nand high-caste families are much worse than those of their brothers, because there are\nlikely to be more eligible women competing to marry sons of families that are wealthier\nand from higher sub-castes than their own. The stratification caused by the caste system\nreinforces considerable hypergyny within castes.\nThis strong hypergyny is almost certainly the main engine behind Hindu India's\ndowry system. Parents from wealthy and powerful families and castes, especially in the\nnorthwest, have long had to compete via the payment of lavish dowries to marry their\ndaughters to the sons of higher-born and wealthier families (Dickemann, 1979b; Hudson\nand den Boer, 2004). This dynamic placed a strong incentive on wealthy families to raise\nsons and avoid raising daughters, which historically led to strong links between caste,\nwealth, and poor survival among daughters (Dickemann, 1979b).\nWhen hypergyny intensifies female competition for the wealthiest grooms, then\naccording to Trivers and Willard's model, the wealthiest families should have\ndisproportionately more sons. The evidence suggests that this is exactly what happened in\nIndia. Pre-colonial infanticide was most noticeable in the wealthy castes of the northwest,\nsuch as the Rajputs of Rajastan (Dickemann, 1979a, b). Contemporary sex ratios, especially\nsince abortion replaced neglect as the main process skewing sex ratios, increase steadily\nwith wealth (Subramanian and Selvaraj, 2009) and with caste. In rural Haryana, the poor\nlaboring Harijan caste has sex ratios of 102, whereas the land-owning Jats and Yadavs have\nIn the 20th Century, dowry customs spread \u00ad probably by imitation and the growth\nof the middle class - from the high castes of the northwest to other regions and to less\nwealthy families and lower castes. While 1961 legislation attempted to limit the spread of\ndowries, dowry payments remain a widespread practice and an arena of social prestige\n(Patel, 2007; Roulet, 1996). Dowries have also become more materialist in nature and more\nfinancially crippling for the bride's family. Part of the cause for the spread of the dowry\nsystem can be found in India's ballooning middle class of avid status-conscious consumers,\nkeen to imitate the elites. According to Michelle Goldberg (2010), \"in recent years, with\nAsia's missing women\nIndia suddenly awash in consumerist bounty, dowry demands have exploded, turning the\nwhole thing into a materialistic free-for-all\". Even when there is no negotiated dowry\npayment to the groom or his family, lavish weddings, associated gifts and materialistic\nshows of status can financially cripple a bride's natal family (Roulet, 1996).\nThe inflating dowry and wedding customs make the economic cost of raising\ndaughters ever more extortionate, even when the original scarcity of marriageable men that\ngave rise to the dowry custom within the elite castes no longer applies. In doing so, these\ncustoms create strong incentives among a growing segment of the population to abort\nfemale fetuses; reports suggest that clinics sometimes advertise that the financial cost of\nterminating a pregnancy today is outweighed by the expense saved on a dowry later on.\nIt appears likely that Trivers-Willard effects feed into the vicious cycle of\nhypergyny, dowries, gender-related violence, and son preference in India. Evidence also\nsuggests that changing economic circumstances and cultural imitation might mediate the\nstrength of these effects. The evolutionary and economic factors behind this cultural\nimitation, as well as the consequences for sex-selection and the potential to reverse current\nharmful sex-selection practices, remain to be formally explored.\nDickemann (1979b) also argued that strong hypergamy and dowries led to the well-\ndocumented infanticide of pre-20th Century China, as well as infanticide, infant\nabandonment, and female claustration (e.g. in nunneries) in late mediaeval and early\nmodern Europe. Independent support for a similar Trivers-Willard dynamic with society-\nwide consequences comes from Boone's (1986) analysis of inheritance and reproduction in\n15th and 16th Century Portuguese nobility, in which patriarchal family structure and\ninheritance arises from the wealthiest elite parents investing preferentially in sons.\nFixing the Problem\nThe problem of Asia's missing women appears to be a complex aggregate outcome\nof several individual and family-level behaviors. These behaviors emerge from interactions\nbetween economic circumstances, cultural traditions and values, and evolved parenting\nbiases and mating preferences. I have only touched lightly here on some of the areas where\nevolutionary biology impinges on this complex tragedy.\nBoth the local resource enhancement and Trivers-Willard theories of sex ratio bias\nare consistent with the observed patterns of son preference and gender discrimination,\nespecially under the strong patrilineal and patrilocal customs throughout the afflicted parts\nof Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. Evolved son preferences may contribute to the\nstrength of patriliny and patrilocality, which may in turn reinforce the strength of son\npreferences in a positive feedback loop.\nComplex problems of this nature do not yield to exclusively evolutionary thinking.\nInstead, the unique predictions from evolutionary theories (like local resource enhancement\nand Trivers-Willard) will need to be integrated with economic and socio-cultural theories\nand tools; this is no time to be shoring up outdated \"last wall\" (sensu Pinker, 2002)\ndichotomies between evolution and culture, nature and nurture, or genes and social\nenvironment.\nThere are many good reasons for trying to break the self-reinforcing evolutionary-\nAsia's missing women\neconomic-cultural cycle responsible for Asia's missing women: reducing the suffering\ncaused by neglect and infanticide, eliminating the parental grief associated with\nunnecessary terminations or infanticide, and as we shall shortly see, ameliorating the\nsociety-wide problems caused by excess men. But a problem of this scale requires social\nand cultural change on a continent-wide scale, which, even with appropriate political will,\npresents an immense challenge.\nHere are some brief recommendations informed by the evolutionary ideas I have\nmentioned here. In many cases one doesn't need to be an evolutionary scientist to\nunderstand the positive effects they will have. The root causes of patriliny and patrilocality\nand the massive discrimination against women and girls that they engender in India, China\nand Korea will need to be challenged in order to make any serious progress.\n1. Raise the economic value and prospects of women by subsidizing female\neducation and promoting the role of women in society. Daughters and wives who earn good\nsalaries are valued by their natal and marital families, and have more to aspire to than being\nthe mothers of sons. This must happen society-wide, not just in higher castes or wealthier\ngroups.\n2. Change and enforce laws on property ownership and inheritance that discriminate\nagainst wives, daughters and granddaughters.\n3. Challenge, where possible, burial and worship customs that require the agency of\nsons or male relatives.\n4. Educate society to warn of the dangers of male-biased sex ratios, the shortage of\nbrides and the consequences of hypergyny.\n5. Reduce the dependence of aging parents on sons by building retirement savings\nand old age support, and by making it easier for daughters to support parents equally.\n6. Strictly enforce laws forbidding sex selective abortion and IVF-based sex\nselection. Governments should be careful, however, not to simply raise the cost of sex\nselection technology or to allow loopholes that elites can use to choose sons, as it is the\nvery richest and most powerful people that have the greatest evolutionary incentives to\nprefer boys, and who are most imitated by the middle class.\n7. In India, there is a more pressing need than ever to strictly enforce the ban on\ndowries or dowry-like payments across society, reducing the economic burden of having\ndaughters as well as the incentive for the wealthiest and most powerful families to raise the\nintensity of hypergyny.\n8. In China, there needs to be recognition that the one-child policy has had a\nperverse effect on sex ratios. In particular, the rules allowing families with one or two\ndaughters to have another child might improve the lot of those daughters but they probably\nworsen sex ratios in general. The government might find that improving the education and\nempowerment of women might have the dual effect of reducing fertility and improving the\nsex ratio.\nThe Korean Example\nEvidence from South Korea supports the case for several of these recommendations.\nSouth Korea was the first country in which access to sex-testing and abortion skewed sex\nAsia's missing women\nratios dramatically, reaching 116 (Hesketh and Xing, 2006). But several recent changes\nhave effected a dramatic reversal such that by 2007, the birth sex ratio had returned to 107.\nThese changes included a strictly-enforced 1987 government ban on sex-selective abortion\n(Kim, 2004), greater education and workforce participation for women, parents\nimprovements in the legal status of women (greater autonomy, recognizing their property\nrights, rights to head their own households), and the `Love your Daughter' public\nawareness campaign warning of the dangers of biased sex ratios and the shortage of women\nConsequences of Male-Biased Sex Ratios\nWhen sex ratios become dramatically male-biased, large numbers of men have little\nor no prospect of finding a mate and starting a family of their own (Hudson and den Boer,\n2004). In India, South Korea, and China, marriage and having children are considered\nessential steps toward status and acceptance as a full member of society (Hesketh and Xing,\n2006). In China, male-biased sex ratios constrain so many men from ever taking this step\nthat these men are called \"bare branches\" \u00ad limbs of the family tree that will never bear\n\"Bare branches\" are seldom the offspring of the wealthy and powerful families who\ncontribute the most to the problem, but rather the offspring of the poorest peasant families.\nThis has a number of negative consequences for the society as a whole and for those\nunlucky men in particular. It also highlights the fact that the decisions made by a family to\nterminate a female fetus or kill a newborn daughter create a massive externality, impacting\npoorer families far more profoundly than their own (Brooks, 2011).\nSeveral times in Chinese history, female infanticide and neglect created large\nsurpluses of males. These men drifted into criminal gangs that terrorized other citizens;\nsometimes, these men formed larger militias that wreaked large-scale havoc. The Nien\nrebellion in 19th Century China was one such event that resulted in the death of 100 000\ntroops and civilians over a 15-year period; the rebellion devastated the economy and\neventually contributed to the demise of the Qing dynasty (Hudson and den Boer, 2004).\nAlthough spectacular sex-ratio biases on the scale of Asia's missing women are\nrelatively rare, polygynous traditional societies are more likely to experience between-\ngroup and within-group violence because poor young men have little prospect of finding a\nsingle wife (Ember, 1974; Ember et al., 2007). Similarly, the renowned lawlessness of the\nearly American West is often attributed to strongly male-biased sex ratios (Courtwright,\n1996). The intense jockeying by young men for status, respect and economic success that\nso often spills over into violence and, occasionally, homicide (see Daly and Wilson, 1988b)\nis made all the more intense by the fact that the prospect of never finding a mate is higher\nin polygynous and, by extension, male-biased societies.\nIn a similar vein, in late medieval and early modern Europe, elite titled and landed\nfamilies proliferated beyond the number of titles and area of land available. The younger\nsons of these families, jockeying for status and titles, regularly threatened the political\nstability of their societies, becoming the \"spearhead of feudal aggression\" (Duby, 1977).\nAsia's missing women\nExpansionist campaigns, from the Crusades (Duby, 1977) to colonialism (Boone III, 1986),\nwere driven, at least in part, by this surplus of ambitious and aggressive younger sons with\notherwise poor reproductive prospects.\nMale-biased sex ratios trigger the phenotypically plastic hyper-competitive\nmasculine traits that allow young men - especially poor and low-status young men - to\ncompete furiously for status and wealth in order to win a mate. They also appear to be\ntriggering related behaviors: risk-taking, violence, gambling, alcohol and drug abuse,\nkidnapping and trafficking of women, and the use and abuse of prostitutes. All of these\nmaladies are on the steep rise in India, China and elsewhere where sex ratios are male-\nNot only can we trace the causes of Asia's missing women to interactions between\nevolution, economics and culture, but the direst consequences are also evolutionary in\norigin. Even if childhood sex ratio biases can be eliminated, societies with skewed sex\nratios will continue to experience high rates of violence and crime for at least one\ngeneration. Those disaffected gangs of young men also make perfect fodder for\nfundamentalism and violence of a more global nature. An important future challenge for\napplied evolutionary psychology will be to recognize and ameliorate the frustrations and\nchallenges created by male-biased sex ratios.\n"
