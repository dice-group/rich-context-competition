Anstey1\n1 Centre for Research on Ageing, Health and Wellbeing, The Australian National University, Australia,\n2 Institute for Ageing and Health, Newcastle University, United Kingdom\n* Kimberly.ashby-mitchell@anu.edu.au\n Introduction\nCognitive impairment (CI) is a condition where a person has trouble remembering, learning\nnew things, concentrating or making decisions that affect their everyday life [1]. CI can be mild\nor can be severe enough to affect an individual's ability to live independently [1]. The rising\nprevalence of CI is an increasing challenge with the ageing of our populations but little is\nknown about the burden in low- and middle- income countries. This is a particular concern\nsince low-and middle- income countries, including Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC),\nare aging more rapidly. At present, over 60% of the world's population 60 years and older live\nin these countries and this projection is expected to rise to a high of 80% by 2050 [2].\nAge is currently the strongest known predictor of cognitive decline [3, 4]. As such, because\nof the rapid increase in demographic ageing in all world regions, global prevalence of dementia\nis predicted to double every 20 years to over 80 million people by 2040 [5]. Since CI has been\nshown to negatively affect quality of life including functional status [6] countries that are age-\ning most rapidly will face considerable challenges.\nEarly life education has been associated with reduced risk of dementia [7, 8] but education\ninfluences health in varied ways [9, 10], including by encouraging health-seeking behaviours\nand healthy lifestyles [9]. The role of education in screening and detection tests has however\nbeen controversial since it may influence the ease with which a respondent is able to answer\nquestions asked and display the necessary skills to be measured [11].\nAs the older population grows in both size and proportion it is important to find out wheth-\ner the additional years lived are spent with more disease and disability [2]. Health expectancies,\nwhich combine information on mortality and morbidity are useful population indicators to as-\nsess whether the extra years of life expectancy are in good or poor health [12]. The most widely\nreported health expectancy is disability-free life expectancy and, while there have been some\npublished studies on mental health expectancies in a number of developed countries [13\u00ad18],\ndata on the older population, particularly on cognitive status, is not routinely collected in Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean. This paper is the first to report life expectancy with and without\nCI in LAC, utilising data from a survey conducted in seven LAC countries (Argentina, Barba-\ndos, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Mexico and Uruguay) between the period 1999\u00ad2000. In addition we\nundertake cross-national comparisons to investigate burden of CI at various ages and examine\nthe role education plays in determining cognitive status.\nMethod\nStudy Design and Sample\nThe study draws on secondary data derived from The Survey on Health, Well-being and Age-\ning in Latin America and the Caribbean (SABE). SABE data are freely available from the Inter-\nuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research and data was accessed using the search\nterms `ICPSR & SABE & Latin America and the Caribbean.' SABE, conducted during the peri-\nod 1999\u00ad2000, represents the most comprehensive study conducted in the Region on the elder-\nly population. As a multi-centre project it involved the collection of baseline data in the capital\nMental Health Expectancies in Latin America and the Caribbean\nCzech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany,\nGreece, Italy, The Netherlands, Sweden, United\nKingdom), the European Commission, DG SANCO\nand two French institutions: DREES and CNSA.\nProfessor Kaarin J.

The proj-\nect aimed to examine health conditions and functional limitations of persons aged 60 and older\nin the countries under study and placed special emphasis on those over 80 years old\nfrom 85% in Bridgetown, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Mexico City to 60% in Buenos Aires, 84% in Santiago,\n95% in Havana, and 66% in Montevideo. Sampling was based on censuses conducted in 1998\nand 1997 in Montevideo [19]. Surveys were administered to representative samples in each\ncountry with samples being drawn from recent census data or from nationally representative\nA multistage, clustered sampling with stratification of the units at the highest levels of aggre-\ngation was used [20]. The primary sampling unit was a cluster of independent households\nwithin predetermined geographic areas grouped into socioeconomic strata and then divided\ninto secondary sampling units, each containing a smaller number of households [20].\nHouseholds and target individuals (persons age 60 and older) were randomly selected and\ntarget individuals contacted to schedule an interview at home. The interviews were conducted\nin English, Portuguese or Spanish depending on the official language of the country in which\nthe survey was administered. If a person who agreed to be interviewed failed the cognitive test,\na proxy was selected to respond to some parts of the questionnaire [20].\nDefinition of CI\nThe Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) [21] was used to establish cognitive status in all\nstudy samples. The MMSE is a sum-score evaluating various dimensions of cognition (memo-\nry, attention and language) and is an index of global cognitive performance [21]. In the SABE\nStudy, a regression analysis had been carried out prior to identify the MMSE questions that\nwould be best to determine cognitive impairment. The Modified MMSE was developed with\nnine variables instead of the 19 original MMSE variables in a bid to lessen the low literacy bias\n[22]. Each respondent's score was then computed, with a score of <12 (out of a maximum of\n30) indicating cognitive impairment [20].\nThe Pfeffer Scale measures functional capacity, taking into consideration ability to perform\ndaily tasks as well as instrumental activities such as conduct of simple fiscal transactions, doing\nlaundry and comprehension of current events and it is used to assess and compare normal and\ndemented adults [23]. The modified MMSE was used in conjunction with the Pfeffer Scale for\nthose persons who obtained a score of 12 or less in the modified MMSE and was administered\nto an informant or carer accompanying the participant with cognitive deterioration in order to\nconfirm that their level of cognitive decline affected functional capacity [20]. A participant\nscoring 12 or less on the Modified MMSE and 6 or more on the Pfeffer Scale was considered\nunable to be interviewed and a proxy of the participant was asked to respond instead [20].\nLevel of education\nIn this study, a high education level was defined as any learning that occurred after completion\nof secondary school while a low education level was defined as having either primary and/or\nsecondary school education only.\nStatistical Analysis\nLogistic regression analysis using Stata version 12 was carried out to assess the relationship of\ngender, age and education on cognitive status. The Sullivan Method was used to calculate life\nMental Health Expectancies in Latin America and the Caribbean\nexpectancies with and without CI (CILE and CIFLE) for each country (and gender) by applying\ncountry and age-specific CI prevalence from the study outlined above to country-specific life\ntables. CIFLE reflects the number of remaining years, at a particular age, which an individual\ncan expect to live on average in the absence of CI [24]. Life tables were calculated from mortali-\nty rates and population figures obtained from the World Health Organisation. Five year age\nintervals were used during analysis except for the final age-grouping which was recorded as\n85+ years [24]. The curvature of the true survival curve over each age interval (ax\n) was estimat-\ned as 0.5 since this is generally a reasonable assumption [24, 25]. The standard error of the esti-\nmates of CIFLE was calculated for all age and sex groupings in each country [24]. Men and\nwomen were analysed separately. We fitted meta-regression models [26] to all 7 countries to-\ngether to investigate the relationship between education level and CIFLE at age 60 for men and\nwomen separately. The analyses conducted and results presented are unadjusted.\nResults\nThe mean age of all persons in the study was 70.8 years (SD = 8.2). Overall 58.7% of study par-\nticipants were female and there were proportionately more females than males in all countries.\nAround 80% of men and women overall had a low education level though this ranged from\n16.8%). Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for the populations under study in the\nseven countries.\nThe prevalence of CI ranged from a low of 8.9% (Argentina) to 21.3% (Barbados) (Fig. 1). A\ngreater proportion of females were recorded as having CI in all countries.

At age 60 years, TLE for males varies from a low of 17.6 years (Brazil\nand Uruguay) to a high of 19.7 years (Cuba). For females, TLE is generally longer than males\nand at age 60 varied from a high of 22.8 years (Chile) to a low of 20.2 years (Brazil). By the age\nof 80, the longest TLE and CIFLE for males were observed in Mexico (TLE: 7.2 years, CIFLE:\n6.9 years) while the shortest TLE and CIFLE were observed in Barbados (TLE: 6.0 years,\nCIFLE: 4.8 years). For females at age 80, Chileans and Cubans recorded the longest TLE (8.2\nyears) while Mexicans recorded the longest CIFLE (7.1 years). See Fig. 2 below.\nAt age 60, males in Uruguay (97.0%) and Cuba (96.6%) spend the greatest proportion of\ntheir remaining lives free of CI when compared to those at other study sites despite males in\nUruguay having the shortest TLE at age 60.

This conclusion remained when the\nanalysis was repeated excluding Cuba which had by far the largest percentage with high educa-\ntion (S1 and S2 Figs).\nFig 2.

Total Life Expectancy (TLE) and Cognitive Impairment-Free Life Expectancy (CIFLE)\ncomparisons can be made among each of the seven countries included in the study.\nMental Health Expectancies in Latin America and the Caribbean\nDiscussion\nIn the LAC countries under study, the odds of CI increased with age in all countries except\nUruguay. A significant gender effect was observed only in Mexico with males having lower\nodds of CI compared to females. For males TLE at age 60 years was highest in Cuba and lowest\nin Brazil and Uruguay. CIFLE at age 60 for males was highest in Barbados, Chile and Mexico\nand lowest in Brazil. However, although Uruguay had the lowest TLE and did not have the\nhighest CIFLE at age 60, Uruguayan men experienced the greatest proportion of their remain-\ning life free of CI (97.0%). For females at age 60 years, TLE was highest in Chile and lowest in\nBrazil. CIFLE for females at age 60 was highest in Barbados and lowest in Brazil. Although\nhigher odds of CI were observed in those with low education in Brazil, Chile, Cuba and\nMexico, level of education did not appear to explain the differences in CIFLE at age 60 in\nLAC countries.\nThe differences observed among countries in our study are noteworthy and future research\nis necessary to determine the exact cause. Possible explanations include the effect of confound-\ning factors not controlled for such as race/ethnicity, or differences in the application of the sur-\nvey instrument at each study site. In addition, published research indicates that among the\nstudy countries there is great variation in the structure of the healthcare systems and the role\nplayed by the public health sector in protecting the health of the older population and these\ncould account for the differences observed between countries [27].\nWorth noting is that while the Uruguay sample had a higher mean age than Mexico (70.94\nand 64.71 respectively), TLE at age 60 in Mexico is much higher. This may be explained by the\noversampling of the target population in Mexico where all eligible individuals found in a target\nhome were interviewed compared to Uruguay where only one individual was selected per\nhousehold [20]. It is also possible that in Uruguay stratification and subsequent sampling was\ndefined by socioeconomic as well as geographic and global indicators while in Mexico stratifi-\ncation may have been based solely on geography [27]. Reports on cognitive impairment of\nolder people in developing countries are rare. However, the Mexican Health Ageing Study has\nproduced data estimating prevalence of CI (no dementia) that can be used for comparison with\nresults obtained in the present study. Published data from the Mexican Study estimates CI\nprevalence at 28.7% [28]. These estimates are higher than those obtained in the present study\nfor the Mexican population (approximately 10.8%) and may reflect the fact that SABE data was\ncollected from city dwellers only who may have greater access to health care, belong to higher\nsocio-economic groupings and have a healthier diet. Additionally, differing methodologies\nused for diagnosis of CI may have led to variations in results.\nStudies on dementia-free life expectancy (DFLE) for some Latin American countries (Uru-\nguay, Chile and Brazil) have been published and estimates range from 3.4% to 7.1% [28]. The\nresults of the present study provide CI prevalence estimates in these countries between 1.9%\nComparisons with developed countries such as Australia, Canada and England and Wales\nprovide much needed perspective. An analysis of DFLE in Australia during the period 2004\u00ad\nyears respectively [14]. Of these years, males could expect to have a DFLE of 17.1 years and fe-\nmales 19.5 years [14]. Figures for the Canadian population are similar, Canadian males and fe-\nmales aged 65 are expected to live a further 16.4 years and 19.4 years respectively. Of these\nyears, 13.8 years for males and 17.2 years for females are expected to be lived free from CI [18].\nWhen compared to Australian and Canadian males, TLE and CIFLE are lower in all LAC\ncountries. For example in Cuba, the country with the highest TLE and CIFLE at age 65, a male\nis expected to live a further 15.9 years of which 15.3 would be spent CI-free. When\nMental Health Expectancies in Latin America and the Caribbean\ncomparisons are made among females, the TLE and CIFLE for Australian females are higher\nthan those in Canada but LAC countries record the lowest estimates. In Australia, a female\naged 65 is expected to live a further 21.5 years of which 19.5 would be spent free of CI while in\nChile, the LAC country with the highest TLE at age 65, a female is expected to live a further\nThe Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (MRC CFAS) allows\nfor comparisons between LAC countries and the older population in England and Wales in\n1991 [29]. In both settings, men live shorter lives than women. Among both sexes, TLE is\nhigher across all age-groups in LAC countries when compared to that observed in England and\nWales. For instance, males in Cuba and Barbados at age 65 can expect to live a further 15.9 and\n15.7 years respectively while those in England and Wales can expect to live a further 14.1 years.\nIn the case of females at 65 years of age those in England and Wales have a TLE of 17.8 years\nand a CILE of 1.2 years. This is lower than the CILE for the same age in all LAC study coun-\ntries. It must be noted though these comparisons are based on estimates over a decade apart\nThe effect of education on health outcomes including cognitive impairment has been pub-\nlished in relation to previous studies [10, 30]. The results of this study, which show that the\nodds of CI are greater in persons with low education levels, support previous research from the\nUnited Kingdom which concluded that there is a substantial burden of life expectancy with CI\nAmong the limitations of this current study is the inability to disaggregate CI by type of de-\nmentia. However, SABE represents the only comprehensive cross national study on the health\nof elders in the LAC region and while likely to have underestimated prevalence estimates due\nto its focus on city dwellers, its results are useful. Secondly, no data were collected from adults\nliving in institutions in any of the study countries and so may not be representative of that pop-\nulation. Research indicates though that the percentage of the population in institutions in LAC\ncountries is quite small and so this bias is also likely to be small [31].\nThe main strength of this study is the fact that CI and CI free life expectancies have not\nbeen published for such a wide range of LAC countries prior to this and provide useful data for\npolicy makers to assess healthy ageing trends.\nConclusion\nThe results from this study are consistent with other published findings which have indicated\nthat age, sex and education level are significant predictors of cognitive status. Novel though is\nthe comparison of healthy life expectancies among Latin American and Caribbean countries\nand these show substantial differences in the absolute years lived and the proportion of remain-\ning life spent free of cognitive impairment. These results provide a greater understanding of the\nburden of CI in Latin America and the Caribbean and highlight the need for follow-up surveys\nto be conducted as their populations continue to age.\nSupporting Information\nS1 Fig. Meta-regression Results--Relationship between Education Level and CIFLE at Age\n60 Males.
