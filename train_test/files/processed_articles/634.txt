    "abstract": "Abstract: Changes in use of health services by the uninsured, when covered after health reform, are\na key to the costs of reform. From data on persons under age sixty-five in the 1989 National Health\nInterview Survey, we estimated their expected use of hospitals (excluding obstetric deliveries) and\ndoctor visits, adjusting for age, sex, and self-reported health status. If uninsured persons obtained\nprivate coverage distributed by the plan type of other persons in their home regions, nonobstetric\nhospital days for the formerly uninsured would increase 28 percent, and their visits to physicians'\noffices would increase 52 percent. If instead the uninsured enrolled entirely in group- or staff-model\nhealth maintenance organizations (HMOs) in their home regions, their nonobstetric hospital days\nwould actually decrease 17 percent, and their visits to physicians' offices would increase 60 percent.\nOne key goal ofhealth system reform is to provide health care coverage\nto those who now lack it. Estimating the cost of providing such\ncoverage is an important policy issue. These estimates depend\ngreatly on how much the volume of health care services used by the\nuninsured would change if they were to enroll in various types of private\nhealth coverage. Obviously, somebody in the system is paying the costs of\ncare already obtained by the uninsured. If the uninsured were covered, these\ncosts would appear explicitly instead of remaining hidden. Regional patterns\nof health care use also affect the changes in cost incurred when coverage is\nextended to the uninsured. However, much of our current knowledge of\nrelative utilization by persons with various types of private coverage depends\non data gathered ten to twenty years ago. A study based on a more recent\nnationally representative sample should provide further insights for policy-\nmakers on how to resolve this tough issue.\nThe 1989 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) included a supple-\nmentary set of questions that asked for considerable detail on types of\nhealth coverage for the survey population. This information, combined\nwith the regular NHIS questions concerning health status and use of\nphysician and hospital services, made it a very promising source of compre-\nhensive factual information on the issues mentioned above.\nThe major objective of this study was to use information from the 1989\nMark Blumberg recently retired as director ofspecial studies for the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan,\nInc., in Oakland, California.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

For this reason we used a deflator for the\nNational Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)-assigned weights, which\nweights by this constant (2,082.734), which preserved the relative weight\nfor each respondent due to the sampling procedure.\nWe omitted all persons age sixty-five and older, because their health\ninsurance status is dominated by Medicare in combination with other\npublic and private coverage, and all respondents who had any public\ncoverage. We grouped the relatively small number of persons with no\nprivate coverage at the time of the survey who had Medicaid at any time in\nthe prior six months with those having public coverage. This left a study\npopulation made up of persons with either private coverage only or no\ncoverage, public or private.\nAll who responded to questions on their health care coverage were asked\nto name the plan or plans covering them. Each respondent also was asked if\nhis or her plan was \"an HMO,\" based upon the following brief description:\n\"Health Maintenance Organizations, or HMOs, sometimes called Individ-\nual Practice Associations, or IPAs, are plans whose members are required to\nuse only those health care providers who work for the HMO or IPA. Also,\nmembers do not have to submit claims for costs of medical care services.\"\nAs part of the development of the public-use tapes, the NCHS recoded\neach of the plans named by respondents against a master list distinguishing\ngroup- or staff-model HMOs from IPAs. In this study, those with a plan\nidentified by name as a group- or staff-model plan or an IPA were coded\naccordingly. However, persons who said that they were in an HMO but\ngave plan names that could not be identified were classified as being in\n\"other HMOs.\" About 90 percent of those with plan names confirmed as\nIPAs or group/staff-model HMOs had correctly stated that they were in an\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

We do not know much about the plan characteristics of people\nclassified as being in \"other HMOs,\" but these plans are less likely to be\nlarge or long-established plans with well-known names.\nThe other (non-HMO) types of private insurance were divided into\nthose described as \"Blues\" and \"other private.\" The latter was the largest\ncategory and included self-insured plans offered by employers, labor and\nwelfare trust plans, and commercial indemnity plans. An HMO plan owned\nby Blue Cross and Blue Shield or a commercial insurance company was\nclassified as an HMO based on the specific plan name.\nAbout 10-15 percent of those with some private coverage indicated that\nthey had more than one type of private coverage. We prioritized such\npersons in the following order: group/staff-model, IPA, other HMO, Blues,\nand other coverage. Those with no private coverage were designated as \"no\ncoverage,\" since this analysis is limited to those with no public coverage.2\nThe weighted sample size used in this study totaled 90,668, representing\nstaff-model sample was in the West, while 36 percent of the Blues sample\nwas in the Northeast. About 44 percent of the \"no coverage\" sample was in\nthe South. These uneven regional distributions highlight the problems that\ncan arise from using aggregate national data to estimate the changes in costs\nof providing coverage to the uninsured.\nIn our analysis of hospital use we omitted obstetric deliveries for several\nreasons. Nearly all deliveries occur in hospitals, and hence there is virtually\none hospital discharge for each delivery. The propensity to have a baby is\ncertainly influenced by age and sex, but the relative utilization rate of\nhospital episodes per delivery is essentially the same for all populations and\nis influenced little by self-reported health status. Obstetric deliveries in this\nstudy population accounted for 19.4 percent of all of their reported annual\nhospital discharges. To enlarge on the number of deliveries, we used those\nWeighted Number Of Persons Under Age Sixty-Five Without Public Coverage, By\nPrivate Coverage Status And Region, 1989\nRegion\nNortheast\nMidwest\nSouth\nWest\nTotal\nPercent\nGroup/\nstaff\nmodel\nIPA\nOther\nHMO\nBlues\nOther\nprivate\nNo\ncoverage\nTotal\nPercent\nSource: National Health Interview Survey, 1989.\nNote: IPA is individual practice association; HMO is health maintenance organization.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Our data also exclude well (but not sick)\nnewborn admissions. This, however, still leaves other hospitalizations re-\nlated to pregnancy, such as those for some miscarriages, ectopic pregnan-\ncies, false labors, postpartum complications, and sick newborns. The omis-\nsion of obstetric deliveries only partially adjusts for risks of hospitalization\nrelated to pregnancy and newborns. (Our measure of use of physician\nservices includes all office care related to pregnancy and newborns.)\nWe analyzed the following measures of utilization: (1) Hospital: episodes\nof care with at least one night in the hospital, with the patient discharged\nat some time in the year prior to the interview (excluding discharges for\nobstetric delivery and well newborns); and number of hospital days for\nthese nondelivery episodes. (2) Visit to physician's office: number of per-\nsons reporting at least one office visit in the past year; and number of visits\nreported by the respondent in the year prior to the interview.\nThe basic method of analysis here is indirect standardization. In all\nexamples, standards for expected rates were based on the aggregate experi-\nence of the entire population under age sixty-five without public coverage\n(the 90,668 weighted persons). We divided this population into eight age\nand two sex categories, and into four self-reported health status groups.\nA few respondents had very long short-term hospital stays, which could\nhave had a disproportionate impact on any cell in the standard in which\nthey occurred. For this reason we truncated the number of hospital days per\nperson according to the number of hospital episodes the person had re-\nported in the prior year. The following tabulation shows the total number\nof hospital days allowed by the number of episodes the person had in the\nprior year: One discharge, 45 days; two discharges, 70 days; three discharges,\nOverall, this truncation reduced the total volume of hospital days for this\nstudy group less than 5 percent.\nSimilar but separate tables were prepared to obtain expected values for\nthe number of nondelivery hospital discharges in the prior year, the number\nof doctor visits in the year prior to the interview, and the proportion with\nat least one doctor visit in the prior year.\nStudy Results\nPersons with no coverage had by far the highest expected hospital days\nrate in each region and overall (Exhibit 2).

There is\nlittle difference in the ratio of observed to expected visits by type of private\ncoverage, but, not surprisingly, those with no coverage had a low ratio\n(0.808). The annual number of doctor visits was truncated at fifty (that is,\npersons with more than fifty visits were recoded as having fifty visits). The\nindirectly standardized ratio of observed to expected annual visits is under\n0.8 in each region for those with no coverage. Overall differences in the\nratio by type of private coverage are small.\nWe can now use the data presented above to estimate the changes in\nhospital and doctor visit use that are likely to occur if those without private\ncoverage are given private coverage. This requires assumptions about the\ntypes of health coverage that the uninsured would obtain. We also assume\nthat uninsured persons residing in a given region would obtain their private\ncoverage in plans available in their home region, which should be obvious.\nA person without coverage in the South could hardly be expected to enroll\nin an HMO in the Northeast, or even an average U.S. HMO. Our key\nassumption is that an uninsured person obtaining private coverage of a\nparticular type would have a utilization pattern similar to that of persons\nalready covered by this type of plan in the region in which the uninsured\nIndirectly Standardized Ratio Of Doctor Visits In Prior Year, By Region\nRegion\nNortheast\nMidwest\nSouth\nWest\nTotal\nNortheast\nMidwest\nSouth\nWest\nTotal\nGroup/staff\nmodel\nProportion\nNumber of\nIPA\nwith any\nvisits in\nOther\nHMO Blues\nvisit in prior year\nprior yeara\nOther\nprivate\nNo\ncoverage\nTotal\nSource: National Health Interview Survey, 1989.\nNotes: Based on 1989 NHIS population under age sixty-five with no public coverage.

For this reason, the\nestimates presented below may be improved by further adjustments for\nincome, education, race, employment, and marital status, as well as for\nother health status factors that may influence utilization.\nExhibit 5 illustrates different assumptions about the types of coverage\nthat persons without private coverage might obtain in the future. In all\nthree examples we assume that persons without private coverage enroll in\nprivate plans in the same region in which they reside. First, we assume that\nall persons without private coverage in the South enroll in \"other private\"\nplans in the South. If they had the same utilization patterns of persons\nalready in \"other private\" plans in the South, then their risk-adjusted\nwithout private coverage in the South have (Exhibit 3). The ratio of 1.116\nto 0.847 is 1.32, the number that appears in the hospital days column on\nthe top line of figures in Exhibit 5. If all persons with no private coverage in\nthe South enrolled in \"other private\" plans in the South, their nondelivery\nhospital days would increase 32 percent.

In\nthe South, for example, nondelivery hospital days equal 0.60, which implies\nthat under this assumption hospital days for persons not now privately\ninsured would decline 40 percent;hospital discharges would decline 22\npercent. Doctor visits under this assumption would increase 73 percent.\nComparable data for the Northeast, Midwest, and West similarly assume\nthat residents of these three regions enroll in group/staff-model HMOs in\nthe region in which they reside. In these three additional regions there\nwould be little change in use of nondelivery hospital days by the uninsured\nbut substantial increases in their doctor visits. National data are calculated\nby weighting each of the index numbers by the percentage of the U.S.\npopulation located in each region. Nationally, having persons without\ninsurance join group/staff-model HMOs in their respective regions would\nincrease their hospital discharges by 2 percent, lower their use of hospital\ndays by 17 percent, and increase their doctor visits by 60 percent.\nThe lowest section of Exhibit 5 uses the assumption that persons with no\nprivate coverage in each region will join plans in their region in proportion\nto those who are already enrolled in plans of each type within their region.\nNationally, this assumption would lead to a 50 percent increase in hospital\ndischarges, a 28 percent increase in nondelivery hospital days, and a 52\npercent increase in doctor visits for those without private insurance. From\na similar calculation that considered the entire United States as one region,\nthe resulting ratio was 1.36 for hospital days and 1.53 for doctor visits.\nThus, the more realistic assumption that those with no coverage will use\ncare like those in their home regions (as in the lowest section of Exhibit 5)\ngave results that differed from the more typical assumption, which ignores\nthe regions in which the uninsured live.\nAs noted before, there are no data here to estimate the volume of\nphysician services rendered to inpatients. This volume is more likely to be\nbetween the estimates developed for nondelivery hospital days and dis-\ncharges than to be similar to doctor visits.\nThe per birth volume of hospital care for obstetric and well newborn\nservices delivered to uninsured persons is unlikely to change much if the\nuninsured obtain private coverage. The data on doctor visits already in-\nclude visits relating to pregnancy and well newborns and probably account\nfor part of the increase in such use that we have estimated above.\nDiscussion\nA recent paper compared the physician office use of those with and\nwithout insurance using the 1989 NHIS.4 However, this paper made no\ndistinctions by type of private coverage.

[the uninsured] will\nincrease under managed competition to levels reported by insured persons\nwith similar age, sex, income, and self-reported health status charac-\nteristics.\" Using this approach, they estimated that the costs of care for the\nuninsured after provision of private insurance would increase 56 percent for\nhospital inpatient care and 117 percent for hospital emergency room/\noutpatient and physician services. This is about double the increase we\nderived in our estimates (Exhibit 5). They also estimated from their NHIS\ndata that \"on average, [all types of] HMOs reduce utilization by 2 percent\n(versus 8 percent for group models).\" This reduction for group models is\nmuch less than our data for group/staff-model HMOs. The small increase\nwe found for doctor visits, shown in Exhibits 3 and 4, should not be used to\nestimate changes in physician inpatient care costs.\nA third study, done by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), led to\nthe assumption that group/staff-model HMO care would reduce spending\nfor persons with private or public coverage (exclusive of Medicare or\nMedicaid) by 15 percent over programs with no managed care.6 This\nestimated reduction also appears to be low, but the CBO assumptions were\nnot based on a risk-adjusted database comparable to the NHIS.\nNeither the Lewin-VHI nor the CBO papers apparently considered\nregional differences in health care use and private health coverage. While\nthe causes of such regional differences are not well understood, they have\npersisted since at least the 1950s. Hence, any forecasts need to include some\nassumption about whether or not these differences will persist. If there is\ninterregional convergence, one will have to decide whether it will be\ntoward the national average or, as seems more probable, toward the regions\nwith the lowest utilization rates.\nTwo other studies have developed regression models of hospital and\ndoctor use based on the 1989 NHIS data for those under age sixty-five. A\n1992 Lewin-VHI study estimated the additional use associated with giving\nthe uninsured private coverage.7 (It is not clear whether this report was the\nbasis for the estimates given above for Lewin-VHI.) They distinguished\nHMOs from other private plans. Their results are somewhat similar to ours\nbut difficult to compare because they have separate models for those under\nage eighteen and those ages eighteen to sixty-four. Regions were included\namong the many prediction variables. A 1993 study also estimated the\ndifference in doctor visits and hospital use of the uninsured and insured\npopulations under age sixty-five.8 No distinctions about type of private\ninsurance were made, nor was any geographic variable included as a risk\nfactor in these regression models. However, both reports provide many\nuseful insights for researchers and policymakers interested in this subject.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Comparisons of utilization volume can avoid distortions al-\nleged to be the result of the greater ability of some plans to shift costs.9 In\naddition, utilization data avoid interregional differences in costs that are\nthe result of variations in factor prices. Compared with studies that are\nbased upon claims from insurers, this analysis gives more complete doctor\nvisit utilization data, regardless of whether or not a claim was made. Utili-\nzation, from claims experience also is distorted by persons with overlapping\ncoverage. This analysis includes all of the utilization for members enrolled\nin various plans, regardless of who paid for it. Thus, the data are not biased\nby use of \"out-of-plan\" services. These advantages are traded for the greater\ndetail of services found in claims data.\nThis analysis updates an earlier study of hospital use by type of coverage\nbased upon the 1975 NHIS, which was limited to populations under age\nsixty-five in western metropolitan statistical areas but lacked some of the\ndetail on type of coverage that is available in the present study.10 However,\nthe types of private coverage were somewhat simpler in 1975, which pre-\nceded the rapid growth of a variety of managed care programs. The earlier\nstudy adjusted not only for age and sex but also for various measures of\ndisease-specific morbidity, which should be even more accurate than the\ngeneric morbidity measure used in this study (self-reported health status).\nThe NHIS tapes of 1989 do provide the opportunity of making more\ndisease- or condition-specific adjustments, although the sample sizes are\nsomewhat limited for the various chronic diseases. Furthermore, the 1989\nNHIS provides information on surgical procedures performed in both in-\npatient and outpatient settings, which would be a useful adjunct to the\ninformation on hospital episodes and days and doctor visits analyzed in this\nDataWatch. Doctor visits can be further disaggregated into visits for sick-\nness and injury and visits for checkups or preventive services.\nSelf-reported health status is well correlated with both hospital and\ndoctor use and is certainly an improvement over age and sex risk adjust-\nment alone. However, there is at least a good likelihood that a person's\nperception of health status is an interaction between objectively measured\nmorbidity and various cultural, educational, and attitudinal factors.11\nAlthough self-assessed health status was a useful risk adjustment variable\nrelated to morbidity in this analysis, we do not recommend its use to assess\nrisks for insurance rate setting or budgeting. Not only is it expensive to\nobtain adequately high, unbiased response rates, but there is no way to\nverify the information. The context in which it is sought could bias respon-\ndents (for example, respondents who fear that poorer health status would\ndecrease their opportunity for coverage might deliberately misreport it).\nRisk adjustment for insurance and budget purposes should rely on the\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Local variations in practice\npatterns and health status variations not adequately adjusted in this analysis\nalso may contribute to these large area variations.\nIn any event, the assumptions made about the types of coverage that the\ncurrently uninsured will have in the future are an important factor in\nestimating the change in costs of providing them with coverage.\nNOTES\n1.
