The Urals are also notoriously known as a site of the Soviet military industrial complex, the\nbirthplace of the Soviet nuclear program, and the most polluted region in Russia. The evolving Urals' imagery as Russia's\n\"treasure box\" and \"Russia's defender\" has been a continual theme through the region's identity and economic progression\nover the period of 300 years. At different times and by different powers, the Urals was glorified or ostracized, however,\npreserving its iconic image.

Geographers view places not only as envi-\nronmental spaces but also as subjective \"processes,\" that are\nhumanly produced and humanly changeable, thus represent-\ning the evolution and condensation of a complex history of\nenvironmental, economic, political, and social processes\nthe identities of places and of people inhabiting these places.\n\"Representative landscapes\" constitute visual encapsulation\nof a shared past, with such major cultural identifiers as\nnationality, language, religion, and ethnicity (Norton, 2000).\nThe dynamics of cultural identity are crystallized through\nregion-building institutions, and how these places are repro-\nduced is often regulated by a state or regional government\n(Frers & Meier, 2007). These intricate processes are embed-\nded in material culture \"from above,\" in the form of region-\nbuilding institutions such as economy or governance (Paasi,\n2004) and are preserved in visual culture \"from below\" in the\ncollective memory of people through folklore, mass media,\nfilms, and artistic narratives (Paasi, 2003).\nRussia, with its vast size, uneven population distribution,\nand relatively low population mobility, is extremely hetero-\ngeneous. Although Russia has always been a center-periph-\nery structured country, the fragmentation of the periphery\nintensified in the last two decades since the collapse of the\nSoviet Union in 1991. Although each Russian region is a\nproduct of long economic, social, and political development,\nmany regions were formed on a rather artificial basis, which\nwhen the major ideological basis for the region delimitation\nwas the premise of their objective existence (Givental, 2009).\nThe Urals region, however, has been uniquely different in its\nintrinsic vastly recognizable features that lie deeply within\nits natural resource base and its deep ties with the history of\nthe entire Russia spanning over 300 years and cutting across\nthe variety of economic and political regimes.\nThe Ural Mountains in Russia stretch north-to-south for\nthe Kazakhstan border. The medieval name for the moun-\ntains was the \"Stone Belt\" or simply the \"Stone\" (Kamen in\nRussian), reflecting the stone beauty and the harshness of the\nregion (Figure 1).

This region, although just 5%\nof the country's territory, is the home to almost 20 million\npeople or 13.7% of the total Russian population (Russian\nSince the times of Tsar Peter the Great, when Russia\nevolved as a novel metal-producing center in the early 18th\ncentury and gained its dominance on the Baltic Sea, and\nreconstruction, the Urals region has been perceived in\nRussia as the country's mineral treasury and its military\nstronghold. In Russia's industrialization efforts, from the\npowers maintained the stronghold image of the Urals.\nOutside Russia, however, the Urals is notoriously known as\nthe heart of the Soviet nuclear industry and an area of\nextreme environmental degradation. A 2008 online book on\ncomparative regional geography paid sufficient attention to\nthe region contrasting the Russian Urals with the American\nAppalachia (Braden, 2008). The authors, a team ofAmerican\nand Russian geographers, described the Urals as \"these\ngloomy mountains,\" \"a region out of sync with time and sur-\nrounding space,\" and \"a forgotten place . . . populated by\npeople not wanted elsewhere\" (Rogachev & Brunn, 2008,\np. 21). In a few strokes, the authors created a visual image of\na depressing, polluted Urals, with its centuries-long dark\nindustrial past and equally dark and hopeless present. \"The\nSoviet galvanization of the nearly stiffened corpse of the\nantiquated industrial region has considerably worsened the\nunattractive features of the Urals\" (Rogachev & Brunn,\nFigure 1.

This contradic-\ntory character of the Urals region has produced an array of\ncontested images, both inside and outside Russia. The eco-\nnomic history of Russia over the last 300 years has been\nclosely intertwined with the development of the Urals\nRegion, and reducing the region's image to a polluted, out-\ndated, and largely forgotten smudge on the face of the Earth\nis factually incorrect and unfair to the Uralian people.\nMethod\nThe cultural landscape is a material record of human activ-\nity, and as such we can gather information on the landscape\ncreation and meaning through both visual sources, such as\ndirect and indirect observations, and historical records. As\n\"raw appearances\" can be deceptive, it is necessary to move\nbeyond the mere reliance on empirical observations and\nunearth the repositories of human meaning and interpreta-\ntion that underpin lived realities. Approaching the land-\nscape as a palimpsest, a manuscript that has been written,\nscraped, and rewritten many times allows us to analyze a\ncontemporary landscape as an accumulated human occu-\npance in a particular location (Givental, 2011; Rhoads &\nThis article explores the roots of the long-lasting unique-\nness of the Urals region through the historic records and the\nUrals' imagery. While the former contribute to analyzing the\nforces that propelled that distinctiveness from \"above,\" the\nlatter helps to recognize the role of written and visual art as a\nliving testimony to the evolution of the Urals' identity in the\ncontemporary Russian psyche. Although not the native of the\nUrals, the author gained a deep familiarity with the region\nduring the years of geological fieldwork spanning the period\nand economic upheaval and changes. While the method of\ndirect observations is quite reliable for cross-sectional stud-\nies, the goal of this research is to show the longitudinal\ndimension of the formation of the Urals cultural identity in\nthe minds of the Russian people. This task is accomplished\nby combining the historical records with the artistic narra-\ntives, both written and visual, that may serve as a proof of the\nlong-lasting imagery which differentiates the Urals region\nfrom any other region in the vast Russian domain. As the\nlongitudinal study spans the period over 300 years, the narra-\ntive has to move from the prerevolutionary Russia (before\n1991) characterized by the command economy and the tragic\nthen moves to the post-Soviet Russia, which emerged after\nthe dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.\nThe Mountain Range As a \"Treasure\nBox\"\nThe rich variety of mineral resources is the most characteris-\ntic feature of the Urals region and was the root for its indus-\ntrial development during the last 300 years. The Russians\noften proudly cite that more than 1,000 minerals and more\nthan 12,000 mineral deposits have been discovered in the\nUrals, including 48 out of the most important 55 chemical\nelements used in human economic activity (Vinokurov,\nGlushkova, Makar, Plisetskaya, & Simagina, 2004). While\nthe western slope of the mountain range is rich in nonmetal-\nlic deposits (oil, natural gas, and mineral salts) the eastern\nslope bears a remarkable variety of valuable metallic ores,\nespecially iron, copper, chromium, vanadium, gold, plati-\nnum, and a variety of precious stones. This distinctive geo-\ngraphical dichotomy of the Urals' mineral resources has\ndetermined the location of chemical industries in the western\nUrals and metallurgy in the eastern Urals.\nIron and copper ore deposits were discovered in the Urals\nat the beginning of the 17th century and became the basis for\nthe region's emergence as one of the first heavy industry\nregions in Europe. Gold was discovered in the Urals in the\nearly 18th century, triggering a Gold Rush. A 36-kilogram\n(80 pound) gold nugget from the Urals is still exhibited in the\nRussian Diamond Fund in Moscow's Kremlin. The Central\nUrals region also became famous in the 18th and 19th centu-\nries for its unique stocks of malachite, associated with cop-\nper ore deposits. The solid blocks of malachite from this area\nwere extensively used for decorating the Versailles Palace in\nFrance as well as the winter and summer palaces of the\nRussian tsars in St. Petersburg.\nAlthough the Urals economic region combines the eastern\nand western parts of the mountain range, it is mainly the\nareas of the eastern slope of the Urals (Sverdlovsk and\nChelyabinsk regions, Figure 3) with metallic ores and pre-\ncious stones that have been traditionally recognized as \"the\ntreasure box\" of Russia.

Bazhov's first collection of stories, \"The Malachite\nCasket\" was published in the Soviet Union in 1939 and\ntranslated into English in the 1940s. The central tale of the\ncollection, \"The Stone Flower,\" is a romantic love story\nstaged in the Uralian village of the 19th century. A gifted vil-\nlage stone-cutter Danila is enchanted by the Mistress of the\nCopper Mountain who guards the secret of creative beauty;\nhe is obsessed with the idea of cutting a malachite flower\nwhich would be more beautiful than a real one.\nThe mountain goddess guided him through caverns, each one\nmore beautiful than the last. Their walls shone with outcroppings\nof gems, and more jewels covered the ground. One cavern had a\nceiling so low that Danila could hardly stand upright--the\namethyst walls were lit from by an unseen light source and he\nfelt as if he and the Mistress of Copper Mountain were held for\na moment in the jewel's heart.

This romantic story\nwas turned into one of the first Russian color films in 1946.\nIn 1950, the famous Russian composer Sergey Prokofiev\ncreated a ballet \"The Tale of the Stone Flower\" based on\nBazhov's narrative. The Urals' \"treasure box\" identity has\nleft a strong imprint in the minds of the Russian people.\nThe Urals As a Military Stronghold\nIf the Urals' \"treasure box\" image was created by a popular\nperception of its enormous mineral treasures, its \"military\nstronghold\" identity was promoted during the most trying\ntimes linked to Russia's two controversial leaders: Peter the\nPeter's imperial policy and strategic decision making\nlaunched the first Russian industrialization \"from above,\"\nfacilitating Russia's victory in the war with Sweden in 1721\nand moving Russia forward into the ranks of the most\nadvanced European monarchies.

By 1750, Russia was the world's leading producer\nof iron, with an annual output of 53,000 tons with the Urals'\nshare being 72%.

Thus, the Urals entered\nthe 20th century as an old industrial region, with partially\nexhausted mineral resource base and obsolete equipment.\nThe Russian industrialization during the Soviet regime,\nin the 1930s under the leadership of Joseph Stalin, marked\nthe period of the second rise of the Urals region. Earlier, the\nBolshevik Revolution of 1917 and the ensuing Civil War of\nof the 1920s, Stalin designed a centrally planned command\neconomy with the goal of erasing all traces of capitalism\nand transforming the Soviet Union into an industrialized\nstate, which would be able to effectively compete with the\ncapitalist world.

By the 1990s, the Urals held\nnotorious \"first place\" in the levels of industrial air pollu-\ntion, including 50% of all mercury, 40% of chlorine, and\n30% of fluorine air emissions in Russia. Many rivers in the\nUrals contained the amounts of oil, ammonia, zinc, chro-\nmium, phenols, and other chemicals that significantly\nexceeded the permissible state limits (Gramolin & Yevseev,\nSulfur air pollution as a result of the metallurgical techno-\nlogical process, which turned iron sulfide ores into pig iron\nand steel, was blamed for widespread cases of respiratory\ndiseases and asthma among the residents of the Urals' major\nindustrial centers.

Regional disparities\nin the Urals regions are great; however, here, more than any-\nwhere else in Russia, one can see a direct relationship\nbetween the \"treasure box\" status and the rate of capital\ninvestment. Due to Russian government's policy of promot-\ning clusters of growth rather than investing in depressed\nregions, the Urals resembles a mosaic of industrial and com-\nmercial high-tech hubs alternating with the depressed and\neconomically underdeveloped areas (Giannias, Liargovas, &\nUnexpectedly, the traditional old mining areas of the\nUrals' eastern slope, especially Sverdlovsk and Chelyabinsk\nprovinces (Figure 3), became the \"winners\" in the process of\ndisintegration of the Soviet Union. While the breakdown\nresulted in Russia losing a significant part of its metal-pro-\nducing capacities and raw-material base in the new post-\nSoviet countries of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Central Asia, it\nalso increased Russia's demand for metals produced in the\nUrals, thus providing an incentive for the modernization of\nthe Urals' existing mining and manufacturing capacities\nprogram \"The Ore\" and the regional program \"The Ore of\nthe Urals\" have amplified the \"treasure box\" identity of the\nUrals region by directing a large volume of federal and for-\neign investments necessary to the recovery of the Urals min-\ning activity. Under these new programs, the Urals Geological\nSurvey has intensified ore prospecting in the underexploited\nnorthern parts of the Urals. The first years of the program's\nimplementation have clearly shown that the Urals' \"treasure\nbox\" of mineral resources is not depleted. In fact, the poten-\ntial reserves of manganese, chromium, copper, and bauxite in\n40% of the total Russia's reserves of these metals, respec-\ntively (Koroteev et al., 2006; Yakovlev, Burykin, &\nStakheyev, 1999). As a result of revived mining activity in\nthe Urals, capital investments in industrial enterprises, based\non the utilization of mineral resources, have grown tremen-\ndously since the beginning of market reforms. The invest-\nments come from American, European, and East Asian\ncompanies, among them Philips, Lufthansa, Ford, Audi, and\nVolvo. The region has become the site of an exceptional\ngrowth of technopolises, many of them based on the former\nmilitary\u00adindustrial R&D complexes.

The only above-mentioned refer-\nence to the Urals region in the western geographical litera-\nture (Braden, 2008) projected a highly unattractive image of\nthe Urals. There is, however, strong evidence that the\nRussians themselves are far less negative in their perceptions\nof the Urals. \"Only the rocky Urals have turned out to pro-\nvide fertile soil for a cultural blossoming,\" writes a literary\ncritic in her assessment of the latest developments in Russian\nliterary art (Margolina, 2007).

However,\nthe romantic \"treasure box\" sense is still present among\nUralians themselves, nurtured by the environmental and cul-\ntural realities of the mountain region. In the above-mentioned\nbook on regional geography of Russia and the United States,\nthe Appalachian region, a counterpart of the Urals in the\nUnited States, is portrayed as a tradition- and identity-\npreserving area, in spite of the years of neglect \"from above.\"\nTradition is an appropriate term to describe the peoples of\nAppalachia. It is not difficult to understand the strong sense of\npride and identity the residents have to their region, nor to\nunderstand why many people believe that the region has changed\nlittle for the better in recent decades. (Rogachev & Brunn, 2008,\nIf the economic comparison of the Urals with the\nAmerican Appalachia is valid, it might be reasonable to\nexpect parallels in people's perceptions. Similar to the\n8 SAGE Open\npeople of Appalachia, the Uralians have a strong sense of\npride and identity mixed with bitterness. While the bitterness\nstems from the many unresolved socioeconomic issues that\nstill plague the region, the source of the pride is the Urals'\nlong glorious history as the country's manufacturer and\ndefender.

Whether it is the harsh climate and hostile living\nconditions of the Urals, or the natural beauty of its landscape\nand the mineral richness of the interior, the recent changes\nhave not altered the traditional \"treasure box\" image. The\nindisputable evidence rises from the works of art following\nthe century long tradition of embracing the Urals' natural\nbeauty and wealth.\n"
