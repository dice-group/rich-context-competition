However, half of all current smokers in 1987 could not recall having been advised by a physician to stop smoking.\nConclusion As advice  from  physicians to stop smoking is effective, physicians must heed the recent call by the Amer\u00ad ican Medical Association that they advise all their smoking patients to stop at every contact.\n\n",
    "reduced_content": "L\nTrends in physicians' giving advice to stop smoking, United States, 1974-87\nElizabeth Gilpin, John Pierce, Jerry Goodman, Gary Giovino, Charles Berry, David Burns\n\n\n\n Introduction\nConvincing smokers to stop smoking has been a major public health goal in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries for more than 25 years. 1 2 Efforts have been somewhat successful : the number of former smokers in the United States is increasing by approximately I million each year.3 However, approximately 50 million people in the United States are still smokers, so we are still far from the goal of a smoke free society.4 The public\n\nrates, if each of 200 000 physicians spent a brief time counselling each patient who smokes the proportion of smokers who successfully stop smoking each year might double.19\n  Surveys of physicians indicate that they are interested in helping their patients to stop smoking and that a  considerable  majority  (52 % to 97 %) think that they have incor\u00ad porated giving advice about stopping smoking routinely into their practice. 20 27 However, the perceptions of the patients and the physicians about the advice given might differ. In this paper we present data on patients' reporting of advice given by physicians over time and identify demographic subgroups that are more or less likely to report receiving such advice.\n\nSubjects and methods\nInformation about physicians' advice to stop smoking was collected in national health interview  surveys  (1974  (n = 25565),  1976\nthe   1986  adult   use  of  tobacco  survey   (n =\n13031).3031 The three national health interview surveys were mainly household personal in\u00ad terviews with response rates exceeding 85 %, and the adult use of tobacco survey was a telephone survey (each number dialled at random) with a response rate of 74 %.\n  This study included 40466 ever-smokers aged 20 years or older who had indicated whether they had received advice to stop smoking from a physician.\n\n\nMEASURES\nIn each survey year ever-smokers were defined as those who had smoked over 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. Current smokers were defined as those who answered \"yes\" to the question,\n\n32Gilpin, Pierce , Goodman, G\u00b7 iov ino, Berry, Burns\n\n\n\"Do you smoke cigarett es now?\" In the 1986 and 1987 surveys only the date of smoking cessation was available.\n  In the 1974 and 1976 surve ys responde nts were asked, \"Have you ever been advised by a doctor to quit smoking?\" In the 1986 survey , respondents were asked, \"Did any doctor ever advise you to quit smoking ?\" Finally, in the 1987 survey the question was, \" Has a doctor ever advised you to quit smoking?\"\n  Demographic variables examined includ ed age, sex, race, education, and marital status. Age (at the respondent's last birthday) was coded as an ordinal variable with the following four values : 20-29 years , 30-44 years, 45-64 years , and 65 years and more. Educational attainment was divided into four ordinal levels according to the number of years of completed schooling: less than 12 years (not a high school graduate), 12 years (high school graduate), 13-15 years (some education at college), and 16 years or more (college graduat e). Race was coded as a three category nominal variable indicating white, black, or other.\n\n\nANALYSES\nAll analyses used unweighted data because the data needed to be grouped across study designs. Separate analyses of changes in re\u00ad ported advice with time were performed in three groups : (a) former smokers, (b) current smokers, and (c) both current smokers and former smokers for whom we knew the date of smoking cessation (from survey years 1986 and 1987). Advice rates over survey years and the\ntime since former smokers had smoked were compared by using the x test for trend.32\n  To examine the relation of demographic factors to the reported rates of advice received among current smokers two groups were used: one group from the early period (1974 and 1976) and one group from the more recent period (1986 and 1987). A log linear analysis was used to examine the likelihood of reporting advice received with respect to time  period, sex, age, race, and educational level.33  The main effects and interactions of demographic factors with time period and selected sig\u00ad nificant higher order interactions were in\u00ad cluded in the model.\n\nResults\nThe overall percentages of former and current smokers who had been advised to stop smoking as reported in each survey year increased between the mid-l 970s and the late 1980s, especially when the last two survey years were\n\nof advice similar to the levels shown in figure I for current smokers in 1974. Reporting of advice increased with the recency of stopping smoking: those who had stopped within the past year reported nearly the same level of advice as did current smokers.\n\n\nsurveys reported receiving advice 1\u00b78 times more frequently than did those in the 1974 and 1976 surveys (table). In both periods women reported receiving advice more frequently than did men, but the increase over time for both sexes was nearly the same. Although in both survey periods the rate of reported advice increased with age, this increase tended to even out in the later time period because the increase was greater for the younger age groups. Black subjects reported receiving advice less fre\u00ad quently than did white sub jec ts, but they showed a slightly higher increase over time than did white subjects. People of other races\u00ad for example, Asian, Native American-showed the largest increase. Smokers with more than a high school education reported receiving ad\u00ad vice more often than those with a high school education or less, and all educational levels showed about the same degree of increase with time.\n  In the log linear analysis all the main effects (sex, age, race, and education) were significant, but none of the interactions of these factors and time period proved significant ; this finding indicated that the pattern of advice in the later time period was substantially the same as that in the earlier period. In a preliminary analysis within each time period and in the final analysis significant interaction was shown between the rates of advice given and sex and age. In both periods the percentage of younger men who reported receiving advice to stop smoking was much lower than the percentage of younger women who reported receiving such advice; older men reported receiving advice slightly more frequently than did older women (figure 3). When the increases in advice over time were compared women aged 20 to 29 years showed a 2\u00b73-fold increase, but in the other groups the factor increase ranged from l\u00b77 to 1\u00b79.\n\nDiscussion\nIn the period from 1986 to 1987, 80 % more current smokers reported that a doctor had advised them to stop smoking than had reported such advice in the mid- l970s.

In  1974,  26-4 % of  current  smokers  reported  receiving advice\nto stop smoking, and this percentage increased to 50\u00b79 % in 1987. The temporal differences among former smokers depended on  the  year in which the smoker stop smoking. The  effect of this relation is seen in the 1986 and 1987 data (figure 2): smokers who had stopped more\nthan 10 years  before the survey  reported levels\n\nincrease  follows   the   trend   over   time noted\nearlier.4  For the   1964  adult   use   of   tobacco survey   15 %    of   current  smokers   reported.. receiving advice.34 By 1966 the percentage had\n\n\n\n\n}/:C;;\nE\n\"'\nkQ)\n\u00b7 s(J:\n\n\nfor women than for men, higher for older smokers than for younger smokers, higher for white subjects than for black subjects, and higher for smokers with more than 12 years of education than for those with less education.

In the New York study 68 % of the patients said that they would try to stop smoking if their physicians advised them to do so; however, only 41 % of the patients in that study reported having been given advice to stop by the resident physician who saw them at the centre.38 In seven studies that relied on self reports by physicians (including   two  national   surveys  of  family\npractitioners ) the percentage of doctors report\u00ad ing that they regularly advised their patients\n\nRace:\n\n\n\nwho smoked to stop ranged from 52 % to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,._ _\n\n\n>\n.._\n\nEducation (years):\n\n  Our results showed several differences be\u00ad tween demographic groups in how often they reported receiving advice to stop smoking from their physicians. Overall, percentages of those reporting they had received advice were higher\n  \nSeveral factors may account for the dis\u00ad crepancy in the advice rates reported by patients and physicians . Firstly , physicians who do not respond to voluntary surveys about how often they advise patients to stop smoking may be the physicians who do not routinely give such advice. Secondly, the types of physicians seen most often by smokers may not be specialists in cardiopulmonary medicine, may not be as aware of the importance of advising patients to stop smoking, and there\u00ad fore may not advise their patients as often .23 Thirdly, physicians may be more likely to\n\n34Gilpin, Pierce, Goodman, Giovino, Berry, Burns\n\n\n:C;.\nE\na.\nt,\na,\n\u00b7 :;\n\ncians perceive that such advice has much less impact than standard treatments for other ailments. Physicians need to understand that the success of their efforts is not measured in how many patients become secure ex-smokers in the year after the advice was given; on this scale a stopping rate of something less than\n\n\n\n..-..\n\n.:,\n\n10 % is  to be expected.Rather, physicians\n\n\u00b7 -Ce\na,\nCl\na,\nac.;,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge group (years)\n\nshould realise that their advice will lead the patient along the normally circuitous path to stop smoking: smokers generally cycle through stages of not thinking about stopping, thinking about it, and making an attempt followed by relapse and another period of disinterest.46 However, repeated advice to stop smoking plus similar messages from other sources will help the process along so that at some point the smoker will make the attempt that succeeds\n\nFigure 3 Rate of reported advice showing differences in  partern by sex, age, and time period\n\nadvise patients who have smoking related illnesses.3840 Smokers in the Michigan survey who had previously suffered a myocardial infarction or stroke reported a  much  higher rate of receiving advice than did other smokers.36 Results from a national survey of resident physicians indicated that 82 % report counselling more than 75 % of smokers with heart disease, but only 52 % report counselling more than 75 % of all patients who smoke. 23 Although we know of no studies which com\u00ad pare actual with recalled advice to stop smok\u00ad ing, several intervention trials aimed at im\u00ad proving the rate of physicians giving advice have relied on patients' reports as the means of evaluation. 16 414 2 This method was chosen de\u00ad spite the possibility that smokers who ignored the advice or failed in an attempt to stop that was prompted by the advice may deny being advised. Finally, the manner in which the advice is given may determine whether a patient remembers receiving the advice. A simple statement to a patient by a  physician that he or she should stop smoking may not have the same impact as more active counsel\u00ad ling or multiple messages.11 43\nSuch  counselling  may  include  information\nabout the dangers of tobacco use and the benefits of stopping, personalised advice on cessation, selection of a target stopping date, written self help materials, appropriate refer\u00ad ral, and, when indicated, a pharmacological aid to stopping smoking. Follow up visits or telephone calls, especially during the first four to eight weeks of an attempt to stop smoking make attempts more likely to  succeed.11 15 44 Use of office reminder systems can increase both the rate of effective advice by providers (by indicating in the appointment schedules which patients smoke) and  the rate of success in stopping (by scheduling follow up con\u00ad tacts).1745 Although the number of smokers receiving advice from their physicians to stop smoking in recent years is larger than it was 10 to 20 years ago, many smokers still are not being reached by this important form of intervention. Physicians may hesitate to advise patients  to  stop  smoking   because  the physi-\n\nand become one of the successful former\nsmokers.\n  Also, more physicians might take an active role if (a) they were adequately trained and financially reimbursed and (b) the climate for priorities in time, space, and for preventive rather than curative approaches to disease could be established. 47 Thus advocacy groups must increase their efforts to reach physicians and to provide them with the information, the materials, and the confidence to assume an assertive role in the protection of this area of their patients' health. Recently the American Medical Association launched a new initiative to encourage and assist physicians to help their patients stop smoking recommending a phys\u00ad ician delivered message \"at every available opportunity.\" 48\n  One limitation of our study is that we do not know how long before the survey the respon\u00ad dents received the advice to stop smoking. Another limitation is that we do not know to what extent individual demographic sub\u00ad groups report receiving more or less advice because they visit a physician more or less frequently than people in other subgroups. Further surveys to assess more fully the current extent of reported physicians' advice to stop smoking are needed to overcome these limitations.\n\nThis study was supported by grant number NO!-CN-95182 from the National Cancer Institute to ROW Sciences under a subcontract to the University of California Cancer Center and grant number !RT 245 from the Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program to the Cancer Center at the University of California, San Diego.

Au cours de ces deux periodes, la probabilite d'avoir re u des conseils d'un medecin etait superieure pour les femmes, Jes personnes agees, Jes personnes beneficiant d'un meilleur niveau d'education, et Jes personnes de race blanche. Au cours de ces memes periodes  le  nombre  d'hommes  jeunes  declarant  avoir r u des conseils les avisant d'arreter de fumer etait inferieur ii celui d'hommes plus ages ou de femmes de tous ages. En 1987 cependant, la moitie des fumeurs reguliers ne se rappelle pas qu'un medecin leur ait conseille d'arreter de fumer.\nConclusion : Puisque Jes  conseils  du  medecin  pour arreter de fumer soot efficaces, les  medecins  doivent suivre l'appel  de  !'American  Medical  Association  qui leur  demande  de  systematiquement  recommander   ii leurs patients d'arreter de fumer.\n\nTendencias en cuanto a  medicos  que dan asesoramiento para dejar de fumar, Estados Unidos, 1974-87\nElizabeth Gilpin et al\n\nResumen\nObjetivo : Calcular la tasa de notificaci6n de  los pacientes que han recibido asesoramiento de un medico para cesaci6n de tabaquismo desde 1974 a 1987, e identificar diferencias entre los subgrupos demo\u00ad graficos.\nDiseiio: Analisis de los factores demograficos y de los casos notificados de asesoramiento para dejar de fumar en personas que fumaron alguna vez,  identificadas  en las encuestas nacionales de salud realizadas por entre\u00ad vistas en 1974, 1976 y 1987 y en la encuesta de 1986 sobre tabaquismo entre adultos.\nEntorno: Encuestas en grupos grandes de problaci6n. Estados Unidos.\nSujetos : 40,466 sujetos de mas de 20 a:fios que habian fumado por lo menos 100 cigarrillos en su vida.\nPrincipales resultados: La probabilidad de que una\npersona que hubiere fumado alguna vez en su vida, notificara haber recibido asesorfa para dejar de fumar en 1974-o y 1986-7 por edad, sexo, raza y nivel de educaci6n .\nResultados: El porcentaje de fumadores que noti\u00ad ficaron haber recibido asesoria aument6 de un 26,4 % en 1974 a un 50,9 % en 1987. La tasa notificada de haber recibido asesoramiento fue 18 veces mayor en 1986-7 comparada con 1974-o. En ambos peridos la pro\u00ad babilidad de que alguien notificara haber recibido asesoria medica era mas alta para las mujeres, las personas mayores, las mas instruidas y para los blancos. En ambos periodos los hombres j6venes notificaron haber recibido asesoramiento para dejar de fumar a una tasa mucho mas baja que la correspondiente a hombres\nde mas edad o a mujeres de cualquier edad. Sin embargo, la mitad de todos los fumadores actuales en 1987 no podia recordar haber recibido asesoria medica para dejar de fumar.\nConclusion : Puesto que el asesoramiento de los medi\u00ad cos para dejar de fumar es eficaz, estos profesionales deben atender el llamado reciente de la Asociacicin Medica de Estado Unidos (AMA) que recomienda aconsejar a todos los pacientes que dejen de fumar cada vez que tengan contacto con ellos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>\n\n\n... --\n/\n\n\n\n.;,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,\u25ba,\n\n\n, .,.,.\n\n\n>\n..,....\n\n,  -\n\n\n\n-,.fflf s \u2022 a i,4\n  :Wf!fVdll-&ti   tJltffil lJl!tr1\u00a51it$, :1Ht:t,i-Jltlt$t\u00a3 fil_A.ffip :1! :fHE:I!#. iii+: ill\u2022l!lffil=fffCJA.r:attrt\u00a7\u2022&.\u2022fr lt\u2022m-&(!(Jt:t*, if A.ff:f.J:a: 1974, 1976 \u00ae 1987$   E.BitllUil\u2022 bl 1986 $RlA.1fffjtftJIJW\u2022 Ifill1-JIHI-# e9 A..\nRA\u2022: \u2022s* \u2022ill\u2022t\u00a5J_A.ff.\n -ft: .tf 1974  ~76$ 1986  ~ 87$M&lt-tfll1Jti,  fiij$t,t,  ff.jiJ,x-fMUt 1\u00a5JmtfJ=fMfi-ll{lJl!fr:litfJffCJtt$.  ta\u2022:  U;fMfi-lti  ffil fr1\u00a5J lt$,  1B 1197t4\u2022if-\u20221\u00a5\u00b71 T t.8 ,m:. t\u00a3 it ifijfl:lf;jraJ Bl, :fcf\u00a3,  $A.,   x-ft:ffl tfiffCJA.lPs .A.Mfr-EJllfJ,3/J tr ffCJtt$*1i, imif-Q.A.ti lJl!frl\u00a5Jlt$ZZ T if.\u00a5-RtJ!1H'!lll!Tf:ff:fctt1\u00a51 tt$.  \u2022  ffl 1987\nif.i1ftrft*.-$Ue -ram!\u00a3 tt mtr\u2022ftMnltffil.\nM :!fffCJ0,3/Jfrec_i.- -m!fffCJ.\n\u2022 lJIJ.41 fl .A.JllfJ.(1P IIt!IU!tllif Mm\u00a5@ffi!Jif'.t:  Jl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,?
