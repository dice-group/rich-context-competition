    "abstract": "Abstract\nThere are high levels of family and sexual violence (FSV) in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Many businesses in PNG, like an\nincreasing number of organizations worldwide, want to address the effects of FSV on their employees and operations to\nminimize human suffering and to maximize productivity. To date, a range of workplace strategies designed to address related\nforms of violence (FSV, domestic and family violence, sexual violence, intimate partner violence, violence against women, and\ngender-based violence) have been developed and implemented, albeit mainly in Western contexts. This article considers the\nextent to which these workplace strategies can or should be modified for workplaces in PNG. Findings from participatory\naction research undertaken with FSV service providers, advocates, businesses, and their employees in PNG strongly indicate\nthat workplace strategies should be modified to reflect cultural and other contextual specificities. In particular, workplace\nstrategies should reflect local understandings about what constitutes FSV, who may perpetrate and who may be victimized\nby FSV, and what supports are available to victims of FSV. It is important to note that while the supports examined are\nnecessarily culturally and contextually specific to PNG, they have subsequently provided important insights relevant for\nworkplace responses in other developing and industrialized countries, thereby extending the evidence base of possible\nworkplace strategies generally.\n",

Over the\nlast two decades, an increasing number of organizations, pre-\ndominantly in Western countries, have promoted workplace\nstrategies that address the ways in which gendered violence\nor distinct subsets of GBV--including domestic violence\n(DV), sexual violence (SV), intimate partner violence (IPV),\nviolence against women (VAW), and family and sexual vio-\nlence (FSV)--can influence the performance and productiv-\nity of employees in their workplace.\nDifferent approaches to employee disclosures of gendered\nviolence may include various combinations of a range of\norganizational responses, including, but not limited to, devel-\noping specific changes to employment, occupational health\nand safety, and antidiscrimination legislation; workplace enti-\ntlements secured through collective bargaining; the unilateral\nadoption and application of policies and procedures by\nemployers; and workplace-based awareness raising programs\n(Hameed, 2014a). Specific workplace strategies may be\ndeveloped and tailored to support individual employees who\nare victims of gendered violence within the workplace such\nas safety planning; referral to medical, psychosocial, legal,\nand protective services; (paid) time off work to access those\nservices; financial support; and provisions to ensure nondis-\ncrimination and employees' privacy. Potentially, workplace\nstrategies may also be implemented to manage employees\nwho are perpetrators of violence. However, to date, little work\nhas been undertaken in this area. Together, these various\nworkplace strategies, their distinct approaches, and various\ncomponents benchmark current and evolving workplace\n1Factive Consulting, New South Wales, Australia\n2University of New South Wales, Australia\n3Massey University, New Zealand\n4Pacific Adventist University, Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea\nCorresponding Author:\nShabnam Hameed, Consultant, Factive Consulting, New South Wales,\nAustralia.\nEmail: shabnam@factive.com.au\nLocal Context Matters: Developing Good\nPractice in Workplace Responses to\nFamily and Sexual Violence in Papua\nNew Guinea\nShabnam Hameed1, Jan Breckenridge2, Paula Bennett2,\nTracie Mafileo3, Lalen Simeon4, and Hennah Steven4\n Keywords\nfamily and sexual violence, workplace, Papua New Guinea, workplace strategies and responses, cultural context\n2 SAGE Open\npractice in addressing the effects of gendered violence on the\nworkplace.
