    "reduced_content": "Data Descriptor: Spatiotemporal\ndatabase of US congressional\nHigh-quality historical data about US Congressional elections has long provided common ground for\nelectoral studies. However, advances in geographic information science have recently made it efficient to\ncompile, distribute, and analyze large spatio-temporal data sets on the structure of US Congressional\ndistricts. A single spatio-temporal data set that relates US Congressional election results to the spatial\nextent of the constituencies has not yet been developed. To address this, existing high-quality data sets of\nelections returns were combined with a spatiotemporal data set on Congressional district boundaries to\ngenerate a new spatio-temporal database of US Congressional election results that are explicitly linked to\nthe geospatial data about the districts themselves.\nDesign Type(s) data integration objective \u00b7 time series design\nMeasurement Type(s) spatiotemporal region\nTechnology Type(s) digital curation\nFactor Type(s)\nSample Characteristic(s) United States of America \u00b7 administrative region\n1Spatial Analysis Research Center, School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning, Arizona State University.\nS.

With the publication of\nKing1, high-quality data on US Congressional elections at constituency level was made available for\nvarious studies of redistricting, voter behavior, and electoral system analysis. For instance, a series of\ninfluential studies on the impact of redistricting on the electoral system uses this data2,3. In the decade\nafter it was published, many other studies of American elections also used this data.\nHowever, later studies of elections have not provided data to extend King1 directly. In most cases, these\nstudies both extend and enrich the original data set, providing a superset of the original Congressional\nelections data. Often, these analyses focused on sociodemographic study of redistricting's impact on various\naspects of the electoral system4\u00ad6 or are general studies of the social and demographic structure of American\nCongressional geography7,8. While privately-owned data exists for this purpose, the price of obtaining\ncoverage comparable to (ref. 1) is high. Thus, the Constituency-Level Electoral Archive (CLEA) was\ndeveloped in part to provide an extended, more detailed, and open data set on legislative electoral\ngeography9. For US Congressional elections, this data set also provides much more data about minor parties\nand candidates themselves, and has been used in a variety of contemporary electoral studies10\u00ad13. Since the\nCLEA is a multi-country data set, it is used often for comparative studies that examine the extent to which\nparticular theories about politics or polimetric techniques hold across electoral contexts. For US elections,\nthe CLEA has been used for longitudinal analysis of electoral structures, examining how specific electoral\nproperties, like effective number of political parties or competitiveness, change over time.\nFor the geospatial research on US Congressional elections, work has focused on the development and\npropagation of macro-scale sectionalism and the construction of ideological and geographic voting blocs\nover time14\u00ad16, as well as the analysis of scale-sensitive political alignments17,18. Recently, calls for a\nrevitalized quantitative electoral geography, focusing on electoral systems analysis and voter behavior,\nhave been made19,20, and many foundational problems in the spatial analysis of electoral systems, such as\nthose articulated by Gudgin and Taylor21, have been explicitly reclaimed by contemporary authors22,23.\nThis has seen an explosion of spatio-temporal analysis of the electoral geography of the US Congress24,25,\nas well as analyses at non-Congressional spatial scales26\u00ad28, and non-American electoral systems29,30.\nAltogether, the literature on electoral analysis has become both robust and wide ranging.\nComplementing the revitalization of electoral systems analysis, most of the data generated in this\nliterature has been openly shared under permissive licenses. However, the construction and maintenance\nof spatially-referenced data sets for Congressional analysis can be a more difficult process than analysis of\nelections at a state or county level. Indeed, King1 and the CLEA only provide spatial information in terms\nof the states in which districts are found. They do not provide information about the shape or extent of\nthe districts, nor the neighborhood & topological relations between districts. Geography & spatial effects,\nare much richer than nesting relationships alone, however, so longitudinal study of spatial effects in\ncongressional districts is quite restricted31. While the CLEA provides a selection of `georeferenced\nelections data' (the GRED), this data set is not comprehensive, with limited temporal scope when\ncompared to US elections coverage in the CLEA. To remedy this, I have constructed a general-purpose\nspatial database that extends King1 forward in time using data from the CLEA and novel data on\nincumbency. With this extended dataset, I connect the individual district geometries compiled by Lewis\net al.32 to yield a single spatio-temporal database of US Congressional elections. In what follows, I discuss\nthe process for constructing this data set, compare the relative values of the source data sets, and briefly\ndiscuss potential use cases or novel analyses that this new data may provide.\nMethods\nTo extend King1 using the CLEA and bind both to Lewis et al.32, a common key across all data sets was\nneeded. This required a coherent data modeling strategy that could encompass the abstractions in each of\nthe data sources. Thus, the data set I construct is a collection of the results of general elections to the US\nCongress. Elections to a Congress are composed of some number of contests, which are electoral challenges\nin which some number of winning candidates are declared. Each contest occurs within some territorially-\nbound constituency, or district, which may or may not be unique in each Congress. Relating the three data\nsets required disambiguating the relationship between contests, districts, and the Congresses. To do this, the\nInter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) numerical codes for states used in\nKing1 were converted to US Census Bureau Federal Information Processing Standard Codes (FIPS codes).\nThese codes are contained in column state_fips of the example table segment shown in Table 1.\nThen, a composite database key was constructed to refer uniquely to a contest's Congress, state, and\ndistrict. The first three characters of the composite index reflect the Congress number of the record, with\nzero-padding on the left if the Congress number is less than three digits. The second three digits of the\ncomposite index are the zero-padded state FIPS code. The third three digits of the composite index are the\nzero-padded district number. Finding a common district indexing scheme was the first design challenge for\nthis data set. In all cases, the sources used different conventions to refer to `at-large' districts, districts that\nare the entire state. In the CLEA, at-large districts were variously referred to as the first district (vermont\n01), as the `zeroth' district (vermont 00), or having no number (vermont). In all cases, Lewis et al.32\nreferred to at-large districts as the `zeroth' district. In both data sets, district numbers refer to the spatial\nconstituency in which the contest occurs, so multiple contests may have the same district number. In\ncontrast, King1 constructs multiple district indexes in the case of a multi-member district. In at-large\nwww.nature.com/sdata/\ncontests, the district index is labeled decreasing from 98. So, if two candidates run at-large in a state, their\ndistrict numbers are 98 and 97. In general, this means that a single district, in the sense of a territorial entity,\nmay have multiple indices if there is more than one contest in the district.\nThe Lewis et al.32 convention is the most simple and robust for this application since it treats the district\nconsistently as a spatial object, rather than as a hybrid of contest and district concepts. In addition, the Lewis\net al.32 indexing strategy retains an advantage of King's1 index, since at-large contests can be separated\nefficiently. At-large contests can be structurally different from typical Congressional elections that occur at\nthe sub-state level, and at-large occasionally merit separate consideration. So, the CLEA records were made\nconsistent with the Lewis et al.32 convention, and the King1 records were converted to this convention as\nwell. The final index is contained in the geom_id column of Table 1, and the original indices retained in\nking_dist and lewis_dist, which reflect the two consistent styles of district numbers.\nIn addition, a unique index for the geometries themselves, the index from Lewis et al.32, is retained in\neach record. This is composed of four three-digit codes. The first component is the zero-padded state\nFIPS code. The second component is the Congress in which the district shape first appeared. The third\ncomponent is the last Congress in which the district shape was used. The final component reflects the\ndistrict number assigned to the district during its lifetime. This index uniquely identifies the geometries of\nconstituencies in US Congressional elections, whereas the other index provides a unique identifier for the\ncontests, referring to their Congress, state, and constituency. In addition, this index allows for the\nconstruction of a high-quality redistricting indicator variable since a contest in a `new' district is one\nwhose congress variable matches the second triplet in the component index.\nFor elections before 1992, the vote_share and turnout, delsouth, and inc covariates are\ntaken directly from King1. For later elections, vote_share, delsouth, and turnout is constructed\nfrom the CLEA and inc is coded by hand. All variables aim to replicate the method used to generate King1.\nThe simplest to replicate is delsouth, a binary variable indicating that a record is in a southern state. The\nvote shares, in this case, are the share of the two-party vote cast for Democratic candidates. To construct this\nfrom the CLEA, the total number of votes cast for the candidate endorsed by the major party candidates is\nrecorded. Thus, in cases of `fusion voting,' where the same candidate appears on multiple party tickets, these\ncounts are added to the major party's total. The sum of these votes is turnout. Then, the share of\nturnout that the Democratic candidate receives is the vote_share. To match the structure of King1,\nthe detail in the party identification in the CLEA was reduced to three parties: Democrat, Republican, and\nOther. In most cases, the reduction in parties was not significant. However, one case should be mentioned:\nFarmer-Labor candidates before the Democrat Farmer-Labor merger in 1944 were considered to be\nDemocrats. This decision does not affect the resulting data product, since only King1 was used during this\nperiod, but will be apparent in the validation plots shown below. The CLEA does not contain incumbency\ninformation, so the inc variable was derived by hand from Congressional rosters. The post-1992 inc\nvariate was coded to match King1: a Republican incumbent who runs for reelection is coded as -1, a\nDemocrat who runs for reelection is coded as 1, and a zero is recorded when there is no single incumbent.\nTogether, this comprises the dataset produced from the CLEA. It provides similar data to King1 in addition\nto extending past 1992 and enriching the data with spatial information. The period of overlap in King1 and\nthe data derived form the CLEA, all US elections from 1896 to 1992, will be analyzed in the validation\nsection to ensure that the CLEA data after 1992 comports with the data sourced from King1.\nAfter this, all data was inserted into a SQLite database and a outer join conducted, retaining all\ndistrict shapes. The join resulted in over 98% of matches on keys, so only a tiny fraction of the districts in\nLewis et al.32 did not find matches in the extended King1. Most of the remaining missing entities reflected\nduplications, malformed original entries that slipped through the data cleaning process, or non-voting\nconstituencies that were not recorded in the CLEA or King1. The geometry information was stored in a text\nformat in a column, wkb, of the resulting comma-separated table. This column is shown truncated in\nTable 1. The example schema of the final data product, broken into two lines. The column containing\nthe shapes encoded in well-known binary is truncated for brevity.\nwww.nature.com/sdata/\nTable 1, and contains Polygons or MultiPolygons (as defined by Open Geospatial Consortium33) encoded in\nwell-known binary (WKB), stated in hexidecimal. This more concise statement of WKB-encoded geometry\nis common in database software (such as PostGIS), but still results in a column with long elements. The\ncoordinates are stored without a coordinate system using the NAD83 datum, inherited from Lewis et al.32.\nCode availability\nThe methods used to generate the data set will be made available through the Open Science framework.\nAll scripts were implemented in Python, and requires a few Python data analysis libraries: pandas, a\ntabular data processing library, geopandas, a geospatial tabular processing library, numpy, a numerical\ncomputation library, and SQLite, used for the final out-of-core database join. In addition, a makefile is\nprovided for convenience, to ensure the build process executes in the correct order.\nWhen run in the correct order, the scripts generate intermediate data and final data products from a\ncollection of sources. First, Kollman et al.9, King1, and the manually-constructed collection of incumbency\ninformation for elections beyond 1992 are contained in a sources directory. The first script, 00_get_all_-\nshapes.py, collects all district shapes from the repository maintained by Lewis et al.32, placing them in the\nsources directory as well. Two intermediate data products are constructed. First, after running 01_data_-\nmunge_clea.py, a cleaned and party-reduced version of the CLEA data is stored in intermediates/\nclean_clea.csv. Second, the next script in the sequence, 02_rebuild_database.py, combines all of\nthe district shapes together in a single table in a SQLite database. Then, the fourth script,\n03_extended6311.py, concatenates the original King1 with the cleaned CLEA data. This first product,\nthe extended_6311.csv data set, has the same schema as the final data set constructed by\n04_final_merge.py, which accesses the SQLite database and merges the extended King1 with the\ncollection of district shapes. In this merge, two final outputs are generated, products/pre1948.csv and\nproducts/post1948.csv, which split the results of the merge in two parts. The split divides the series\nroughly in half, and corresponds to the divsiion between full Congresses organized by the Legislative\nReorganization Act of 1946. Finally, if if more columns from the Lewis dataset are required by analysts, the\nretained columns of the merge in 04_final_merge.py can be changed without affecting the merge process.\nData Records\nAs discussed in the Code Availability, three data products are combined within Data Citation 1. The\nspatial dataset due to Lewis et al.32 is split into pre-1948 and post-1948 components to reduce the size of\nthe resulting product. To join these pieces together, the latter table's header must be removed and the\ntables concatenated. Both tables have the schema discussed above in Table 1 with columns in the same\norder. To assist those who have no need for the spatial referencing, products/extended_6311.\ncsv, named for the original ICPSR numerical designation of King1, contains the complete elections data\nwith the geometric column omitted.\nTechnical Validation\nAfter merging and validation, the resulting two-party vote shares constructed from the CLEA were\ncompared to the original source King1 duting the period of overlap in Data Citation 1, from 1896 to 1992. In\nthis period, the CLEA data is not retained in the final product. But, comparisons over this period of overlap\nillustrates how closely the method constructs a dataset from the CLEA with the same semantics as King1.\nFirst, the comparison shown in Fig. 1 presents the scatterplot of the Democratic party vote shares in\nCongressional elections constructed using the CLEA and that from King1 (ICPSR-6311). The plot for the\nearly period of overlap is shown on the left, and the comparison over the latter period is shown on the right.\nThe early period of overlap contains all Congresses conducted before the Legislative Reorganization Act of\n1946, and the latter period contains all full Congresses that take place after the passage of the Act. The\ncorrespondence in the two data sets is high, but is much better in the second half of the data than in the first.\nThis is likely both due to the way the Democrat-Farmer-Labor faction was processed and the relative\ndisappearance of minor factional party classifications in the CLEA in the period after 1948. In addition, the\nprevalence of fusion voting declines in this period, which makes tabulation of the two-party vote much\nsimpleer. Thus, this comparison indicates that using the data derived from the CLEA should provide an\naccurate post-1992 extension of King1, since accuracy is better for the contemporary Congresses.\nHowever, this plot does clearly show cases where the CLEA and King1 are almost perfectly negatively\ncorrelated. When isolated, these cases occurred when the two source data sets disagreed about the party\nidentification of the legislators in a contest. Upon further examination, these cases were determined to be errors\nin the CLEA and were reported. However, since these coding errors are detected only in the pre-1992 portion\nof the CLEA-derived data, these few coding errors do not propagate into the derived spatiotemporal database.\nA second verification step, comparing the share of votes Democrats receive and the share of seats\nDemocrats win in the US Congress between the two data sets was conducted. This comparison is shown\nin Fig. 2. Both sources generate similar estimates in these two cases, and again tend to track better in later\nCongresses. Notably, however, the two most recent CLEA releases (versions 8 and 9) omit elections in the\nUnited States for 1918, which this graph makes clear. Since the derived dataset uses King1 for all years\nbefore 1992, this missing data does not affect the final data product. Thus, with these two comparisons, it\nseems the two-party vote data generated from the CLEA is sufficient to extend King1 past 1992, and the\nfinal spatio-temporal database of US Congressional elections since 1896 is coherent.\nwww.nature.com/sdata/\nUsage Notes\nTo use this enhanced version of King1, the data must first be loaded correctly into an efficient\nspatial format. The format chosen here is standards-compliant and can be read by any tabular data\nreader with access to GDAL, the Geographic Data"
