We used data from 3,329 women\nrelationship between BMI and age at first intercourse, number of sexual partners, condom use during sexual activity,\nhistory of sexually transmitted disease (STD), herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) seropositivity, and HPV prevalence. BMI\nwas not associated with the prevalence of HPV. Mildly obese women (BMI 30.0\u00ad34.9kg/m2) were least likely to report a\nSTD history (9%vs. 13% in normal weight) and 2 sexual partners in the previous year (8%vs. 13%) while overweight\nwomen (BMI 25.0\u00ad29.9kg/m2) were least likely to report 10 lifetime partners; among those with multiple partners, BMI\nwas not associated with sexual activity without condoms in the past month. After adjustment for age, race/ethnicity,\nand education, women with higher BMI were less likely to report sexual behavioral risk factors than normal-weight\nwomen; however, odds ratios were only significant for mildly obese women for reporting a STD history (0.74, 95%\nassociated with HSV-2 seropositivity after adjustment. HPV and sexual behavioral risk factors for HPV and cervical\ncancer are not more prevalent in obese than normal-weight women and unlikely to account for higher-observed\ncervical cancer mortality in obese women.\nObesity is associated with a higher risk of cancer death includ-\ning deaths from cervical cancer (1). Each year, almost 10,000\nwomen in the United States are diagnosed with invasive cervi-\ncal cancer and another 4,000 women die from the disease (2).\nWomen who are moderately to severely obese are more than\nthree times as likely to die from cervical cancer as women with\nnormal body weight (1).\nThe excess mortality from cervical cancer associated with\nobesity is especially astounding given that cervical cancer is\nlargely a preventable disease. Regular screening using the\nPapanicolaou test has been effective in reducing the incidence\nof this disease in developed countries (3,4). However, despite\ntheir higher cancer risk, evidence suggests that women with\nobesity are less likely to report timely screening for cervical\ncancer (5,6). Hence, lower adherence to screening recommen-\ndations may contribute to the higher risk of premature death\nfrom cervical cancer observed among obese women.\nThe human papilloma virus (HPV) is central to the develop-\nment of cervical cancer (7) and has become increasingly preva-\nlent (8). Some of these infections are transient but a fraction\nof these do lead to cervical changes that progress to cervical\ncancer if not detected and treated early. There are also several\nserotypes of HPV, some conferring higher risk of malignancy\nthan others (9,10). HPV is transmitted through sexual activity,\nand several modifiable factors have been identified that place\nwomen at higher risk for contracting HPV and in turn lead to\nhigher risk of cervical cancer. These factors include many ame-\nliorable behaviors such as early onset of sexual activity, having\nmultiple sexual partners, and previous sexually transmitted\ndisease (STD) (11\u00ad16). Few studies have examined whether\nthe psychosocial consequences of obesity impacts the sexual\nbehaviors of obese individuals, particularly high-risk behav-\niors that might place women at risk for HPV infection and thus\ncervical cancer (17).\nIn this context, we examined the association between obesity\nand the prevalence of several cervical cancer risk factors reported\nExamination Study (NHANES) to understand better the contri-\nbution of sexual behavioral risk factors to the higher-observed\ncervical cancer mortality among women with obesity.\n1Division of General Medicine and Primary Care, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.\nCorrespondence: Christina C. Wee (cwee@bidmc.harvard.edu)\nbrief reports\ngenetic analysis\nMethods\nNHANES is a stratified multistage probability sample of the noninsti-\ntutionalized civilian population of the United States conducted by the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Center\nfor Health Statistics (18). NHANES is designed to assess the health and\nnutritional status of adults and children and combines both interviews\nand physical examination. Beginning in 1999, the study was redesigned\nto be an ongoing continuous program. Data are released in 2-year\ncycles. Design weights and sampling information are provided so that\nanalyses that account for the complex sampling design can be general-\nized to the US population.\nAs part of the interview, participants aged 20\u00ad59 years were asked a\nseries of questions about their health and sexual behavior. We restricted\nour study sample to women participants in this age group (n = 4,132).\nQuestions elicited whether women ever had sexual intercourse, the age\nat which they first had sexual intercourse, and the number of sexual part-\nners in the past month, in the past year, and in their lifetime. Among\nwomen who reported sexual activity in the previous month (n = 408),\nthey were asked the number of times they had intercourse without using a\ncondom. Participants were also asked about having been diagnosed with\na STD, namely genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, and chlamydia\n(\"Has a doctor ever told you that you had ...\"). In addition, women were\nalso asked about demographic information including age, race and eth-\nnicity, and educational level.\nAll participants underwent physical and laboratory examinations in\nmobile examination units. Height and weight were measured, which\nwe used to calculate BMI. We then categorized participants accord-\ning to standard weight categories (19): normal weight or BMI of\nII\u00adIII obesity or BMI 35.0kg/m2 and higher. We excluded women\nwho were missing either height or weight (n = 52) as well as women\nwho were underweight (BMI <18.5kg/m2) (n = 80) or who were preg-\nnant by history (n = 661) because body weight in these situations\nmay not reflect stable baseline weights. Blood samples were collected\nand tested for herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) antibodies in women\naged 20\u00ad49 years. HSV-2 is the cause of most cases of genital herpes,\na STD. A positive antibody test (seropositivity) indicates previous\ninfection.\nsubmit self-collected cervicovaginal swabs. DNA was extracted using\nmodifications of the QIAmp Mini Kit protocol within one month of\n\nsample collection, and HPV detection and typing was conducted as\nwere performed for 27 HPV serotypes including those that were high\nserotypes were probed.\nData analysis\nWe used bivariable and multivariable statistical analytic methods to\nexamine the relationship between BMI category and several risk fac-\ntors of HPV infections and cervical cancer: age at first intercourse, hav-\ning any history of STD (genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, and\nchlamydia), number of lifetime partners (10 partners), whether or not\nwomen had two or more partners in the previous year. Among those\nwith two or more partners in the previous year who were also sexually\nactive in the preceding month, we examined the relationship between\nBMI and reporting not using condoms at least one or more times in the\npreceding month. Finally in the subgroup who submitted adequate cer-\nvicovaginal swabs, we studied the association between BMI and HPV\ninfection. Models were adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and education\nlevel. We weighted analyses to reflect US population estimates and used\nSUDAAN analytic software (20) to account for the complex stratified\nsampling scheme so that appropriate standard errors are derived.\nResults\nTable 1 characterizes our study sample. Of 3,329 nonpregnant\nwere normal weight, 27% were overweight, and 34% were\nobese. Normal-weight women were significantly younger, were\nmore likely to be non-Hispanic white, and completed more\nyears of formal education.\nFigure 1 characterizes women's sexual behavioral risk factors\naccording to BMI before adjustment. Compared to normal-\nweight women, women with higher BMI were significantly less\nlikely to have two or more sexual partners in the previous year.\nthe least likely to report a prior history of STD, P = 0.04; how-\never, women with higher-than-normal BMI had higher rates\nof HSV-2 seropositivity.

BMI was also not significantly associated with active\nHPV prevalence; these results were consistent when we limited\nthe outcome to include only high-risk HPV serotypes.\nAfter adjustment for age, race and ethnicity, and educational\nlevel (Table 2), women with higher-than-normal BMI in gen-\neral were less likely to report higher-risk sexual behaviors.\nThese results, however, did not achieve statistical significance\nwere less likely to report a history of STD or having two or\nmore sexual partners in the previous year. HPV prevalence did\nnot differ by BMI after adjustment.\nDiscussion\nOur study found that the prevalence of HPV did not vary by\nBMI. Women with a higher BMI were no more likely to report\nsexual behavioral risk factors that might predispose them to\nacquiring HPV infection and developing cervical cancer.\nCompared to normal-weight women, women with a higher\nBMI were as or less likely to report previous STD, had compa-\nrable numbers of lifetime partners, and were as or less likely to\nhave two or more sexual partners in the previous year; among\nthose with multiple partners in the previous year, heavier\nwomen were no more likely to have sexual intercourse without\ncondoms in the previous month. After adjusting for sociode-\nmographic factors, heavier women were also no more likely\nthan normal-weight women to demonstrate objective evidence\nof previous genital herpes infection.\nBeyond its association with adverse health consequences,\nobesity has been shown to result in profound psychosocial con-\nsequences (21). Studies suggest that obese individuals are often\nviewed as less desirable dating and courtship partners (21\u00ad24)\nand have difficulty entering into romantic and marriage rela-\nmarry less desirable partners even though they do not have\nlower marital aspirations than thinner women (28). However,\nfew studies have examined whether the social stigma associated\nwith obesity actually affects sexual behavior, particularly high-\nrisk sexual behavior. A recent analysis by Nagelkerke et al. (17)\nmen reported fewer lifetime sexual partners than thinner men\nbut did not find a similar relationship in women; however,\ntheir sample was only a third the size of ours. Nagelkerke et al.\nalso examined the relationship between BMI and HSV-2 sero-\npositivity, but because of limited sample size, could not exam-\nine obesity's relationship with other STDs or other high-risk\nsexual behaviors. Our study confirms the lack of relationship\nbetween obesity and the number of lifetime sexual partners in\nNagelkerke et al.'s earlier work and extends this earlier work\nin a larger national sample to include other sexual behaviors\nsuch as the age of first intercourse, common STDs, and the\nlikelihood of sexual activity without using a condom. We also\nfound that the prevalence of HPV did not vary by BMI. The\nhigh prevalence of HPV in the general population (8) may\nhave masked any variation by BMI.\nGiven our findings, higher death rates from cervical can-\ncer in obese women compared to normal women are unlikely\nto be due to a higher underlying risk of HPV infection which\nis a necessary precursor to developing cervical cancer. Rather,\nhigher mortality from cervical cancer among obese women\nlikely reflects lower rates of screening documented by other\nstudies (5,6). Although the absolute difference in screening rates\nare modest, we estimated previously (5) that a reduction of 3.5\nand 6% in screening in overweight and obese women during a\n3-year screening interval would lead to ~1,200 cases of missed\nor delayed diagnoses of invasive cervical cancer, highlighting the\nimportance of targeting efforts at improved screening.\nAlthough HPV infection is a necessary precursor to the\ndevelopment of cervical cancer, women who are exposed and\nbecome infected with HPV do not necessarily develop the dis-\nease. In many women, especially those who were exposed at\nyounger ages, the infection becomes undetectable over time\n(29,30). Moreover, the cervical changes that are produced\nby HPV progress through several stages before malignancy\nresults (30). Hence, cervical cancer can be avoided if these cer-\nvical changes are detected early enough and intervened upon\nthrough biopsy and colposcopy procedures before the lesions\ndevelop into cervical cancer (30). Whether obese women are\nless likely than thinner women to obtain proper follow-up\nevaluation and treatment once either HPV or HPV-associated\ncervical changes are detected has not been studied.\nTable 2Odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for sexual behavioral risk factors\nage at first\nintercourse\npartners\n2 Partners\nlast year\nSex without\ncondom in\nthe past month\nHistory\nof STD\nseropositivity\nResults adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and education.\nbrief reports\ngenetic analysis\n8.

Audio computer assisted\ninterviewing to measure HIV risk behaviours in a clinic population.\nOur study should be interpreted in the context of its limita-\ntions. First, the cross-sectional and observational design pre-\nvents us from drawing causal inferences about the relationship\nbetween obesity and high-risk sexual behaviors. This is par-\nticularly the case in the outcome of prior behaviors and STDs\nbecause we have no information on respondents' BMI at the\ntime of the past behaviors, although there is likely a strong\ncorrelation between past weight and current weight. Second,\nsexual behavioral characteristics were assessed exclusively by\nself-report and consequently there is likely under-reporting of\nsocially undesirable behaviors such as high-risk sexual behav-\niors; the NHANES does, however, use an audio computer-\nassisted survey interviewer which has been shown to improve\nthe quality of self-reported data on socially undesirable\nbehavior (31). Moreover, there is no evidence that any under-\nreporting should occur differentially by BMI and given that\nthe estimates for high-risk behavior for higher-weight women\nwere consistently lower than their normal-weight counterpart,\nit is unlikely that a strong enough weight-related reporting bias\nexists that would have altered our conclusions.\nIn summary, despite the higher risk of death from cervical\ncancer observed among women with higher BMI, obesity was\nnot associated with a higher prevalence of HPV or with sexual\nbehavioral risk factors that might predispose women to devel-\noping HPV infection and cervical cancer. Higher risk of death\nfrom cervical cancer among obese women are more likely to\nbe due to previously described disparities in cancer screening\nthan to differences in underlying behavioral risk factors.\n"
