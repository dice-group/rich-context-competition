Having purpose in life may\nmotivate reframing stressful situations to deal with them more productively, thereby facilitating recovery from stress and\ntrauma. In turn, enhanced ability to recover from negative events may allow a person to achieve or maintain a feeling of\ngreater purpose in life over time. In a large sample of adults (aged 36-84 years) from the MIDUS study (Midlife in the U.S.,\nhttp://www.midus.wisc.edu/), we tested whether purpose in life was associated with better emotional recovery following\nexposure to negative picture stimuli indexed by the magnitude of the eyeblink startle reflex (EBR), a measure sensitive to\nemotional state. We differentiated between initial emotional reactivity (during stimulus presentation) and emotional\nrecovery (occurring after stimulus offset). Greater purpose in life, assessed over two years prior, predicted better recovery\nfrom negative stimuli indexed by a smaller eyeblink after negative pictures offset, even after controlling for initial reactivity\nto the stimuli during the picture presentation, gender, age, trait affect, and other well-being dimensions. These data suggest\na proximal mechanism by which purpose in life may afford protection from negative events and confer resilience is through\nenhanced automatic emotion regulation after negative emotional provocation.\nCitation: Schaefer SM, Morozink Boylan J, van Reekum CM, Lapate RC, Norris CJ, et al.

Ryff defined psychological well-being in terms of six key\ndimensions: autonomy (capacity for self-determination), environ-\nmental mastery (ability to manage one's surrounding world),\npersonal growth (realization of potential), positive relations with\nothers (high-quality relationships), purpose in life (meaning and\ndirection in life), and self-acceptance (positive self-regard) [3,4].\nHigher levels of purpose in life, personal growth, and positive\nrelations have been linked to lower cardiovascular risk (lower\nglycosylated hemoglobin, lower weight, lower waist-hip ratios, and\nhigher ``good'' cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein (HDL)) as well\nas better neuroendocrine regulation (lower salivary cortisol\nthroughout the day) [5]. Higher profiles on purpose in life and\npositive relations with others have also been linked to lower\ninflammatory factors: interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its soluble receptor\n(sIL-64) [6], providing empirical support linking these well-being\ndimensions to better health profiles.\nRecent evidence suggests that relative to other dimensions of\nwell-being, purpose in life appears to be particularly important in\npredicting future health and mortality. In a prospective, longitu-\ndinal, epidemiological study of community-dwelling older persons\nwithout dementia (Rush Memory and Aging Project), greater\npurpose in life was associated with better ability to perform day-to-\nday activities and less mobility disability in the future [7]. Those\nwho reported greater purpose in life exhibited better cognition at\nfollow-up, had a reduced risk of mild cognitive impairment, and a\nslower rate of cognitive decline [8]. In fact, people who reported\nhigh levels of purpose in life (90th percentile or higher) were 2.4\ntimes more likely to remain free of Alzheimer Disease than people\nwho reported low levels (10th percentile or lower). Moreover, on\npostmortem examination of the brain for Alzheimer Disease-\nrelated pathology, purpose in life modified the associations\nbetween cognition and both global pathologic change and plaque\naccumulation [9], suggesting that having greater purpose in life\nmay protect against the detrimental effects of aging-related\nchanges in the brain that have been linked to Alzheimer Disease.\nFinally, greater purpose in life was associated with a reduced risk\nof mortality from all causes [10]. Collectively, these findings\nsuggest that the ability to find meaning and direction in life may\nhelp buffer or slow the effects of aging and even the ultimate\noutcome: death.\nBesides healthier biomarker levels, slowed effects of aging, and\nincreased longevity, higher levels of psychological well-being have\nalso been associated with lower rates of depression [3,4,11], with\nthe dimension of purpose in life consistently showing negative\nrelations with depressive symptomatology. In fact, people in their\n50s who report low psychological well-being are more than twice\nas likely to suffer from depression when in their 60s, even after\ncontrolling for previous depression history, personality, demo-\ngraphic, economic, and physical health variables [12], suggesting\nthat low well-being is a substantial risk factor for future depression.\nDepression is characterized by high levels of brooding, and often is\nassociated with a ruminative thinking style, and attentional biases\nsuggesting impaired attentional disengagement from negative\ninformation (see [13,14] for review), which may contribute to\nthe prolonged responses to negative emotional stimuli that have\nbeen observed both in psychophysiological and neuroimaging\nmeasures, such as prolonged pupil dilations and amygdala\nactivation [15\u00ad18]. The link between low psychological well-being\nand the dysregulated emotion observed in depression is further\nsupported by findings from the neuroimaging literature: those\nreporting higher levels of purpose in life show better regulation of\nthe amygdala (a brain region involved in fear and anxiety-related\nprocesses) by the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, such that\nactivity in the amygdala is reduced and the ventral anterior\ncingulate cortex is activated to a greater extent for negative relative\nto neutral pictures [19]. Moreover, high purpose in life was\nassociated with slower judgments of the valence of negative\nrelative to neutral pictures, suggesting that persons having goals\nand a sense of direction in life appraised the negative pictures as\nless salient and potentially less threatening than did persons with\nlower levels of purpose in life. Finally, whereas depressive\nsymptomatology has been linked to decreased gray matter volume\nin the insula [20], purpose in life (as well as the other well-being\ndimensions of personal growth and positive relations with others)\nare positively associated with right insular gray matter volume\nHow might purpose in life protect against depression, the body\nand brain ravages of growing older, and the accumulated toll of\nstress and challenges over the years? Based on the accumulating\nevidence, we hypothesize that one mechanism through which high\npurpose in life may protect against depression and the wear and\ntear of life stress is by providing a buffer from negative events,\npromoting reappraisal and motivated coping processes, decreasing\nbrooding and ruminative thinking styles, supporting faster and\nbetter recovery, and thus increasing resiliency. Therefore, we\nhypothesize that higher levels of self-reported purpose in life will\nbe associated with laboratory measures of emotional recovery,\nspecifically, better automatic regulation of negative emotion as\nexhibited by better recovery from negative emotional stimuli.\nImportantly, this hypothesis combines phenomenologically-expe-\nrienced aspects of well-being with objectively measured laboratory\nassessments of the time course of emotional responses, as this\ncombination may offer unique windows on adaptive human\nfunctioning.\nHeterogeneity is the rule in emotion research, characterized by\nlarge individual differences in how people react to the same\nemotional event or stimulus, and in how quickly and easily they\nrecover from that stimulus (see Figure 1 for a hypothetical\ncharacterization of different emotional time course profiles to the\nsame stimulus). While one person may briefly feel the effect of an\nunpleasant event, another may suffer a lingering and pervasive\neffect on mood. These individual differences in emotional\nreactivity and regulation constitute a person's affective style (see\n[22,23] for theoretical reviews), may be critically influenced by a\nperson's sense of life purpose, and may also shape how much\npurpose and meaning one feels, suggesting bi-directional influ-\nences between these constructs\nAffective psychophysiological research provides tools to measure\nan individual's affective state without many of the demand\ncharacteristics biasing self-report (for review see [24,25]), allowing\nfor objective characterization of the time course of an individual's\nemotional reactivity to and recovery from an emotion-eliciting\nstimulus [26]. Eyeblink reflex magnitude (EBR) measured to an\nacoustic startle probe from the orbicularis oculi muscle is emotion-\nmodulated, such that activity is potentiated in the presence of an\naversive stimulus and is diminished in the presence of a pleasant\nstimulus [27,28]. Just as facial musculature recordings reflect a\nperson's affective state and their emotional response to stimuli, the\ntemporal resolution possible with the EBR allows for differenti-\nation of aspects of the emotional response from regulation of that\nresponse [26,29,30], providing objective estimates of both the\nmagnitude and time course of emotional responses during and\nfollowing incentives and challenges.\nIn the current paradigm, EBR measurements were obtained\nduring the picture presentation period and after picture offset. We\ndefine emotional reactivity as reflected in measurements during the\naffective picture presentation when the emotionally evocative\nstimulus is present, and emotional recovery as measurements\nobtained after picture offset when the stimulus is no longer present.\nParsing the time course in this way allows us to investigate\nindividual differences in both reactivity and recovery. By including\nboth the measures of reactivity and recovery in the same analytic\nmodels, we can examine individual differences in our measures\nduring the recovery period unconfounded by variations in\nreactivity. Referring back to Figure 1, imagine two people who\nshow similar reactions to the negative stimulus when it is present.\nOne person's regulatory capacities may facilitate quick recovery\nfrom a negative stimulus after it is removed (hypothetical subject\nB), while another may perseverate and show delayed recovery\n(hypothetical subject A), such as that observed in depression and\ndifferential relationships between emotional reactivity and recov-\nery with higher levels of purpose in life. We predicted that those\nsubjects who reported higher levels of purpose in life would exhibit\ngreater emotional recovery from the negative pictures, controlling\nfor their initial reactivity to these pictures, thereby indicating a\nmore adaptive emotion regulatory profile.\nMethods\nEthics Statement\nEthical approval for telephone and mail surveys was obtained\nfrom the Social and Behavioral Science Institutional Review\nBoard at the University of Wisconsin \u00ad Madison. All participants\ngave verbal consent, which included assurance of voluntary\nparticipation and confidentiality of data. The ethics committee\napproved the waiver of written consent. Such passive consent is\ncustomary for survey research by telephone and mail question-\nnaire. Ethical approval for the follow-up psychophysiological\nsession was obtained from the Health Sciences Institutional\nPurpose in Life Predicts Emotional Recovery\nReview Board at the University of Wisconsin \u00ad Madison and all\nparticipants provided written consent.\nParticipants\nThe Survey of Midlife Development in the United States\n(MIDUS) began in 1995 with a national sample of Americans\nrecruited through random digit dialing (RDD). The remaining\nrespondents included siblings of the RDD sample and a large\nsample of twins (N = 1,914). Data collection focused on socio-\ndemographic and psychosocial assessments obtained through\nphone interviews and self-administered questionnaires. In 2004,\nthese survey assessments were repeated (MIDUS II). The retention\nrate from MIDUS I to MIDUS II was 75% (adjusted for\nmortality).\nPsychophysiological data were collected on a subset of MIDUS\nII participants living in the Midwest who were able and willing to\ntravel to our laboratory. The psychophysiology experiment\nfollowed the survey assessment on average over two years later\nyrs) agreed to participate in our experiment. For a variety of\ntechnical, responsivity, and other data quality issues, 253 (147\nbecause they completed the psychological well-being questionnaire\nin the survey assessment and provided a total of 10 or more\nquantifiable eyeblink responses to the startle probes during the\npsychophysiological paradigm.\nData and documentation for MIDUS I and II, including all\nMIDUS projects, are publically available at the Inter-university\nConsortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR; www.icpsr.\numich.edu/icpsrweb/landing.jsp).\nWell-being\nGiven the growing focus on purpose in life as a key predictor of\nlong-term health outcomes and underlying neurophysiology, our\nhypotheses targeted this particular dimension of well-being,\nalthough we included examination of all six scales of well-being\ncollected in the survey assessments in MIDUS II (Scales of\nPsychological Well-Being; [3,4]). Purpose in life refers to the\ntendency to derive meaning from life's experiences and possess a\nsense of intentionality and goal directedness that guides behavior.\nThe other five dimensions of psychological well-being included\nautonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive\nrelations with others, and self-acceptance. Each scale had seven\nitems (internal consistency for these scales ranged from.69 to.85).\nOther Covariates\nOther variables used in the analyses included age at the\npsychophysiological session, gender, the total number of valid\neyeblink responses to the startle probes over the course of the\npsychophysiology experiment, the lag between the survey and\npsychophysiological assessments in days, trait positive and negative\naffect measured with the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule\n(PANAS; [33]), and subjective well-being measures including the\nSatisfaction with Life Scale [34] and an abbreviated version of the\nGratitude Scale [35] asking participants to rate the following two\nstatements: ``I have so much in life to be thankful for'' and ``I am\ngrateful to a wide variety of people.'' The affect and subjective\nwell-being measures were collected at the time of the psychophys-\niology session.\nFigure 1. Hypothetical emotional response time courses from four different individuals to an emotionally provocative stimulus,\nsuch as a negatively-valenced picture displayed for 4 s as in the present study. Note that although subjects A and B have similar initial\nreactivity during the 4 s picture presentation period, after picture offset they differ in emotional recovery. Subject A shows a prolonged poor recovery,\nwhereas Subject B recovers more rapidly. Subject C demonstrates greater initial reactivity with rapid recovery, whereas Subject D exemplifies an\nindividual who may show smaller, blunted emotional reactivity but severely impaired recovery.\nPurpose in Life Predicts Emotional Recovery\nStimuli\nA total of 90 International Affective Picture System pictures\n(IAPS; [36]) were presented in a randomized sequence. According\nto the IAPS normative ratings, 30 negative (mean (SD) = 2.89\n(SD) = 7.24 (0.44)) pictures were selected, with the positive and\nnegative pictures matched on arousal (negative pictures mean\n(SD) = 5.23 (0.73)). All valences were matched on luminosity,\ncomplexity, and number of pictures with social content.\nPsychophysiological Procedure\nThe psychophysiological procedures have been described\npreviously (see [30] for additional details). After informed consent\nwas obtained, the participant completed questionnaires. The\nparticipant watched the positive, neutral, and negative pictures,\nand heard acoustic startle probes (50 ms, 105 dB, white noise\nbursts with very rapid onset time) presented through headphones.\nEach picture had either a yellow or purple border around it during\nthe first 500 ms of the picture presentation, and participants\nresponded as quickly as possible to the color of the border by\npressing one of two keyboard buttons marked with the color with\neither their index or middle finger of their dominant hand. This\ncolor border identification task was used to keep subjects' attention\non the task and ensure they looked at the pictures. Pictures were\npresented on the screen for 4 s and were preceded by a 1 s fixation\nscreen (see Figure 2 for a schematic of the psychophysiological\nparadigm's design). Acoustic startle probes were inserted at three\ntime points (randomized across trials to maintain an average inter-\nprobe interval of , 16 s). One probe occurred during the picture\npresentation (2900 ms following picture onset), a 2nd probe\nonset), and a 3rd probe occurred 1900 ms after picture offset\n(5900 ms following picture onset). A total of nine probes at each of\nthe three time points were presented for each picture valence\ncategory, resulting in three non-probed trials for each picture\nvalence. Because preliminary data analysis revealed reduced\nmagnitude EBRs at the 2nd probe (across all valences), these data\nwere dropped from all further analyses because it suggests the 2nd\nprobe was affected by prepulse inhibition due to too close temporal\nproximity to the picture offset [37]. Participants who did not\nrespond with a perceptible EBR on 10 or more of the 81-probed\ntrials were excluded from EBR analyses as they were considered\nnon-responders to the startle probe.\nAnalytic Strategy\nManipulation check. We used a linear mixed-effects model\nto test the expected valence (negative, neutral, positive) modulation\neffect, a main effect of probe time (reactivity, recovery), and a\nvalence x probe time interaction on EBR magnitude. The model\nincluded a family-specific random effect to account for within-\nfamily dependence between twins and siblings, as well as a\nparticipant-within-family-specific random effect to account for the\nwithin-person dependence between EBR measurements. Pairwise\ncomparisons between valences (negative, neutral, and positive) and\nprobe times (reactivity, recovery) were adjusted for multiple\ncomparisons using the Bonferroni correction.\nTests of purpose in life and the other psychological\nwell-being dimensions predicting EBR measures of\nemotional reactivity and recovery to negative stimuli.\nFirst, zero-order correlations were calculated between purpose in\nlife and the other five psychological well-being dimensions with\nEBR magnitude measures obtained (1) at the reactivity probe, (2)\nat the recovery probe, and (3) with a recovery residual reflecting\nEBR magnitude at the recovery probe regressed on EBR\nmagnitude at the reactivity probe to remove variation due to\ndifferences in reactivity (EBR magnitude at the reactivity probe\nand the recovery probe are inversely correlated, r = \u00ad0.15,\nBecause age and gender have previously been shown to\ninfluence measures of emotional reactivity and recovery [29,30],\nlinear mixed-effects models were used to test the ability of each of\nthe psychological well-being dimensions to predict EBR magni-\ntude at the reactivity probe as well as EBR magnitude at the\nrecovery probe on negative trials, while controlling for EBR\nmagnitude at the reactivity probe (only included in the recovery\nmodels), age, gender, the total number of valid eyeblink responses\nto the startle probe over the course of the psychophysiology\nexperiment, and the lag between the survey and psychophysio-\nlogical assessments in days (A Models). The total number of valid\neyeblinks was included as a covariate so that the results were not\nconfounded with the reliability of the estimated EBR magnitude.\nThen to ascertain the specificity of purpose in life's ability to\npredict recovery, we added the other five psychological well-being\ndimensions, both trait positive and negative affect (PANAS: mean\npositive affect and mean negative affect) and subjective well-being\nmeasures (Satisfaction with Life Scale mean and abbreviated\nGratitude Scale mean) as covariates in one linear mixed-effects\nmodel (B Model) while including all of the covariates included in\nthe earlier models. All models included a family-specific random\neffect to account for within-family dependence between twins and\nsiblings. Finally, we used linear mixed effects models to control for\ndata dependencies due to twins and siblings being included in the\nsample rather than randomly pick one person from each family\ncluster because the latter reduces the sample size, thereby\ncompromising effect size estimates and power.\nResults\nManipulation Check\nEmotion significantly modulated EBR magnitude. A significant\nmain effect of valence was found across probe times, F(2,1527)\nprobe times on negative (mean (SE) = 0.08 (0.03)) compared to\nboth neutral (mean (SE) = \u00ad0.04 (0.03)) and positive (mean (SE)\n= \u00ad0.06 (0.03)) trials. A significant main effect of probe time was\nmagnitude was greater across valences during the recovery probe\ntime after picture offset (mean (SE) = 0.05 (0.02)) than the\nreactivity probe time during the picture presentation (mean (SE)\n= \u00ad0.06 (0.02)), consistent with previous reports that startle\nresponses are larger for humans in darkness than in light [38],\nreflecting the change in room light levels between a picture on the\nscreen compared to a black computer screen. The valence x probe\np = 0.09. See Figure 3 for the EBR averages by valence and probe\ntime.\nEffects of Purpose in life and the other Psychological\nWell-being Dimensions\nThe zero order correlations between each of the psychological\nwell-being dimensions with EBR magnitude measures obtained (1)\nat the reactivity probe, (2) at the recovery probe, and (3) with a\nrecovery residual reflecting EBR magnitude at the recovery probe\nregressed on EBR magnitude at the reactivity probe to remove\nvariation due to differences in reactivity are presented in Table 1.\nThese correlations reveal that both purpose in life and positive\nrelations with others predicted larger EBR magnitude during the\nPurpose in Life Predicts Emotional Recovery\npicture presentations indicating greater reactivity to the negative\npictures. Both purpose in life and self-acceptance also predicted\nsignificantly smaller EBR magnitude at the recovery probe, but\nonly purpose in life predicted significantly smaller recovery\nresiduals, when EBR magnitude at the recovery probe is regressed\non EBR magnitude at the reactivity probe, controlling for\nFigure 2. Psychophysiology paradigm. 30 positive, 30 negative, and 30 neutral pictures were displayed individually on separate trials.\nParticipants responded as quickly as possible to the border color (purple or yellow) presented during the first 0.5 s of the picture presentation in\norder to maintain attention during the task. Startle probes were presented at 2900 ms after picture onset (assessing reactivity) and 1900 ms after\npicture offset (assessing recovery). Note: to avoid publication of an IAPS picture, the example negative picture was selected from the author's personal\ncollection to be representative of a prototypical IAPS picture. As the mother of the baby in the photograph, she has given written informed consent,\nas outlined in the PLOS consent form, to publication of their photograph.\nFigure 3. Manipulation check. Emotion modulation was observed in the EBR measures with a significant main effect of valence: EBR magnitude\nwas greater on negative compared to both neutral and positive trials across probe times. A main effect of probe time showed larger EBR magnitude\nacross valences in response to the recovery probe after picture offset when the computer screen was black than to the reactivity probe during the\npicture presentation (consistent with findings of larger responses to startling stimuli in darkness than in light). Mean EBR magnitude was significantly\ngreater on negative than both neutral and positive trials at the reactivity probe, and greater on negative than positive trials at the recovery probe.\nPurpose in Life Predicts Emotional Recovery\ndifferences in reactivity. See Figure 4 for a scatterplot of the linear\nrelations between purpose in life and the EBR recovery residual.\nWhen demographic and data quality variables were included as\ncovariates, the linear mixed-effects models testing the ability of\neach of the well-being dimensions to predict reactivity were not\npresented in Table 2 show that when demographic, data quality,\nand EBR magnitude at the reactivity probe were included as\ncovariates in the models with EBR magnitude at the recovery\nprobe, purpose in life still predicted smaller EBR at the recovery\ngrowth and self-acceptance also predicted EBR magnitude at the\nrecovery probe in the A Models, however only purpose in life\nremained at trend level when all of the above covariates were\nincluded as well as all of the psychological well-being dimensions,\ntrait positive and negative affect, and subjective well-being\np = 0.064 (see Table 2). Thus, the findings from the linear\nmixed-effects model, which adjusts for the potential dependencies\nin the data from twins and siblings, show that when all of the\npsychological well-being dimensions, subjective well-being, and\ntrait positive and negative affect are included in the same analytic\nmodel, purpose in life still predicts at trend level lower EBR\nmagnitude at recovery. Therefore, higher levels of purpose in life\nare associated with better recovery from negative emotional\nstimuli even with the effect of the other well-being dimensions and\npositive and negative trait affect removed.\nFinally, as seen in Figure 4, there was one outlier on EBR\nmagnitude at the recovery probe. All of the analyses reported\nabove include the outlier. When the outlier participant's data is\nFigure 4. Purpose in life predicts smaller EBR indexing greater recovery after negative picture offset. Note: (1) EBR values are log-\ntransformed and then z-scored within each participant.

(3) The relation remains significant if the outlier is removed:\nPurpose in life x EBR negative magnitude residual at recovery r = \u00ad0.15, p = 0.03.\nTable 1. Zero order correlations between the individual dimensions of psychological well-being and EBR magnitude measures of\nemotional reactivity and recovery on negative picture trials.\nDimension of Well-Being EBR Magnitude @ Reactivity EBR Magnitude @ Recovery EBR Recovery Residual*\nNote: Correlations with the r (p) values in bold indicate p,0.05.\n*The EBR recovery measure here reflects EBR magnitude at the recovery probe regressed on EBR magnitude at the reactivity probe, removing variation due to\ndifferences in reactivity. (EBR magnitude at the reactivity probe and the recovery probe are inversely correlated, r = \u00ad0.15, p = 0.02).\nPurpose in Life Predicts Emotional Recovery\nexcluded from the linear mixed-effects models, purpose in life still\nsignificantly predicted EBR recovery in each of the models: A\nnone of the other well-being dimensions predicted EBR recovery\nin the B Model when all of the well-being dimensions were\nincluded in the same model, regardless of whether the outlier was\nincluded or not, all ps . 0.43.\nDiscussion\nHigher levels of purpose in life, self-reported on average over\ntwo years prior, predicted better recovery from a negative stimulus\nmeasured with the eyeblink startle response (EBR), such that those\npersons reporting greater life purpose exhibited smaller EBR\nmagnitude after picture offset. The significant association between\npurpose in life and EBR magnitude measures of recovery were\nobserved even when differences in EBR magnitude at the\nreactivity probe during the stimulus presentation were statistically\nremoved. Moreover, the relations between purpose in life and\nemotional recovery from negative stimuli were still significant\nwhen controlling for participants' age, gender, the five other\npsychological well-being dimensions, self-reported trait positive\nand negative affect, and measures of their subjective well-being.\nThe better recovery exhibited after stimulus offset by those with\nhigh life purpose reflects a more healthy emotional time course\nprofile. Davis has demonstrated a crucial role of the central\nnucleus of the amygdala in the fear potentiation of the startle\nresponse in rats [39], and human studies suggest a similar role for\nthe amygdala in emotion-modulated startle [40\u00ad42]. Thus the\ncurrent finding of reduced startle during recovery is consistent with\nprevious reports from our laboratory [19] showing better\nregulation of the amygdalar response to negative pictures in\npeople with high levels of purpose in life.\nPurpose in life stood out among the well-being measures in its\nability to predict EBR measures of recovery, suggesting that feeling\npurpose and meaning in one's life may contribute to a more\nhealthful and adaptive regulation of negative emotional responses.\nTaubitz, Robinson, and Larson (2013) recently examined the time\ncourse of EBR emotion-modulation in dysphoric women by\nexamining both reactivity to the picture presentation and recovery\nafter picture offset [33]. Dysphoric females, compared to non-\ndysphoric females, exhibited blunted EBR for negative relative to\nneutral pictures during the picture presentation (less reactivity), but\nheightened EBR for negative relative to neutral pictures after\npicture offset (poorer recovery), as demonstrated by hypothetical\nParticipant D in Figure 1. In other words, dysphoric females\nexhibited a recovery profile comparable to that which persons with\nlow purpose in life exhibited in the current study. However, it is\nimportant to point out that in the current study, the significant\nrelations between purpose in life and recovery were observed even\nwhen gender and both trait positive and negative affect were\ncontrolled.\nPoor recovery from negative stimuli has been observed in\ndepressed individuals who display sustained pupil dilation and\namygdala activation to negative words [15\u00ad17]. While nonde-\npressed individuals increase dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activa-\ntion and decrease amygdala activation when reappraising emo-\ntional pictures, depressed persons do not [18]. Depression is also\ncharacterized by working memory and attentional biases, includ-\ning increased elaboration of negative information, problems\ndisengaging from negative material, and deficits in cognitive\ncontrol when processing negative information [13,14]. Individuals\nwith depression usually report high levels of rumination [43] and\ngreater use of emotional suppression [44]. Both rumination and\nsuppression are ineffective emotion regulation techniques that can\nactually increase negative emotions [45] and the associated\nsympathetic nervous system activity [46,47], suggesting a potential\nmechanism underlying the physical burden of the dysregulated\nnegative affect characterizing the disorder. According to the\nWorld Health Survey, depression has a greater impact on overall\nhealth than arthritis, diabetes, angina, and asthma [48]. Because\nlower levels of psychological well-being, including lower levels of\npurpose in life, are correlated with higher rates of depression\nliterature further supports the linkage between emotional regula-\ntory skills and purpose in life.\nHow might higher levels of purpose in life contribute to the\nability to recover from aversive and unpleasant events? Additional\nresearch is needed. However, having greater purpose in life may\nprovide motivation to constructively learn from and reappraise\nnegative events in an adaptive manner and avoid brooding and\nruminative tendencies, so as to quickly refocus on one's goals and\npurpose. Possessing higher levels of well-being, especially purpose\nin life, may provide a wealth of resources one can use to cope with\nthe current situation, motivating an adaptive and proactive\nhandling of the situation, buffering the effect of adverse\nexperiences, and thereby facilitating and fostering the learning\nand development of even greater emotion regulation skill over\ntime. This idea is supported by reports that purpose in life is a key\nfactor associated with better recovery from trauma in at-risk\nAfrican American populations [50] as well as Pakistani earthquake\nsurvivors [51], such that those reporting higher levels of purpose in\nlife had decreased rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\nafter suffering trauma. Purpose in life might be a ``resilience\nfactor,'' protecting against the development of psychopathologies\nsuch as PTSD and depression after stress and trauma exposure, or\neven the repeated minor stresses experienced over the course of a\nTable 2.

The current study suggests a mechanism through which\npurpose in life may confer protection is by facilitating automatic\nemotion regulation after negative emotional provocation.\nIn turn, the reverse may also be true, to experience high well-\nbeing and purpose, individuals may need to be able to flexibly\nmodify their emotional responses depending on the situation [52]\nwhether it is to (i) temporarily up-regulate and increase a negative\nemotion to empathize with another or (ii) quickly down-regulate\nand decrease a negative emotion to refocus attention and\nconcentrate on a task after experiencing an unpleasant event.\nThus, people more skilled and adept at emotion regulation may\nhave advantages in work and family life that nurture greater life\nsuccess, including a greater sense of mastery, growth, and\nespecially purpose in life. Moreover, the connections between\npurpose in life and emotional recovery/regulation are likely\nreciprocal in nature over time. Those with a greater sense of\npurpose in life may be better prepared to respond to emotional\nchallenges more quickly and efficiently as our data show.\nHowever, better emotional recovery from negative stimuli,\nparticularly cumulatively through development, might also lead\nto greater purpose in life. Our study tested the ability of purpose in\nlife, measured about two years prior, to predict emotional\nrecovery, underscoring the need for additional studies to test\nwhether the relationship between purpose in life and emotion\nregulatory abilities are uni- or bidirectional, especially at different\nstages in the life span.\nIn conclusion, this longitudinal investigation combined phe-\nnomenologically-experienced aspects of well-being with automatic,\nobjectively measured assessments of emotional reactivity and\nrecovery obtained in the laboratory over two years after the well-\nbeing assessment. The MIDUS study features a remarkably large\nsample with a wide age range, unique for an experiment utilizing\npsychophysiological measures. Our findings suggest that higher\nlevels of self-reported purpose in life predict a person's future\nability to recover from exposure to negative stimuli. Persons with\nhigher purpose in life showed a facilitated recovery with smaller\neyeblink startle responses after negative stimuli offset, suggesting a\nhealthier overall emotional time course. Additional research\ntesting potential mechanisms by which purpose in life may be\nrelated to emotional recovery skills [12] and confer resilience from\ntrauma [50,51], as well as how better emotional recovery skills\nmay contribute to purpose in life is warranted. Purposeful life\nengagement has increasingly been linked to better health\noutcomes, including assessments of morbidity and mortality\nUnderstanding brain-based emotion regulation processes that\ncontribute to these outcomes are important next steps.\n"
