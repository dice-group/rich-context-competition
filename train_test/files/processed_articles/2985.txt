Increased serum uric acid levels had a\npositive relationship to cardiovascular mortality in men and women and in black and white\npersons. Deaths due to ischemic heart disease in both men and women increased when\nserum uric acid levels were in the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile (men,\nshowed that for each 59.48-\u00b5mol/L increase in uric acid level, cardiovascular mortality\nand ischemic heart disease mortality increased. Hazard ratios for men were 1.09 (95%\nmass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, cholesterol level, history of hyperten-\nsion and diabetes, and diuretic use. Further analysis, stratifying by cardiovascular risk sta-\ntus, diuretic use, and menopausal status, confirmed a significant association of uric acid\nand cardiovascular mortality in all subgroups except among men using diuretics (n=79)\nand men with 1 or more cardiovascular risk factors (n=1140).\nConclusion Our data suggest that increased serum uric acid levels are indepen-\ndently and significantly associated with risk of cardiovascular mortality.\nnaires that addressed a variety of health-\nrelated topics. Low-income persons, the\nelderly, and women of childbearing age\nwere oversampled. The total NHANES\nwere medically examined. A sub-\nwere examined in greater depth, which\nrendered additional data including se-\nrum uric acid levels.11\nNHEFS is a longitudinal follow-up of\nparticipantsinNHANESIwhowereaged\n25 to 74 years at the time of survey. The\npersonal interviews and physical and\nlaboratory examinations of NHANES I\nprovided the baseline data for NHEFS.\ntailed sample, information on serum\nuric acid was available in 6651. Of these,\nsubjects were excluded if they re-\nported myocardial infarction, stroke,\nand gout or were pregnant at baseline\n(439); if their racial or ethnic back-\nground was other than non-Hispanic\nwhite or non-Hispanic black (63); and\nif their vital status was missing in the\nBaseline Measurements\nBlood samples were obtained from non-\nfasting persons, and frozen serum was\nsent to the Centers for Disease Con-\ntrol and Prevention for analysis. Se-\nrum uric acid was measured using an\nautomated colorimetric phosphotung-\nstic acid procedure, which had been\nvalidated against a uricase assay, on a\nstruments, Tarrytown, NY). The base-\nline medical history questionnaire pro-\nvided information about history of\nselected conditions, eg, diabetes, heart\ndisease, hypertension, and gout, as well\nas history of using any medicine. At the\nbeginning of the baseline physical ex-\namination, blood pressure was mea-\nsured by a physician once while the ex-\naminee was seated. Smoking status and\nthe number of cigarettes smoked for\ncurrent smokers were obtained at base-\nline for 50% of the detailed subsample\nsmoking status at baseline was deter-\nsmoking history, which applied to both\nsubject and surrogate interview. The va-\nlidity of this approach has been docu-\nmation used in this analysis therefore\ncombines the 2 interviews, which in-\ncreased the available information on\nsmoking to more than 95% of the study\npopulation. Current smoking was de-\nfined as answering yes to both ques-\ntions, \"Did you ever smoke at least 100\ncigarettes or more in your lifetime?\"\nand, \"Do you smoke cigarettes now?\"\nFor women, pregnancy and menstrual\ncycle status also were obtained from the\nmedical history. Menopause was de-\nfined by the answer \"yes\" for the ques-\ntion,\"Havethecyclesentirelystopped?\"\nOf note is the missing data for some im-\nportant baseline characteristics. For ex-\nample, serum creatinine concentra-\ntion was absent in about 60% of records,\nand menopause status information was\nmissing for about 60% of women.\nOutcome Measures\nFollow-up data, based on interviews,\nhealth care facility medical records, and\ndeath certificates, were collected in 4\ntained by either death certificate, a\nproxy interview, or both. In the former\ncase, the underlying cause of death was\ncoded according to the International\nClassification of Diseases, Ninth Revi-\nsion (ICD-9). Deaths were analyzed for\nall causes, total cardiovascular disease\nYears of follow-up for each individual\nwere calculated from baseline to the\ndate of death for decedents and to the\ndate of follow-up for those still alive.\nStatistical Analysis\nSubjects were then stratified into quar-\ntiles of baseline serum uric acid level\nby sex. The baseline characteristics of\ncontinuous variables were measured by\nquartiles of serum uric acid level, and\nthe differences across quartiles were\ntested with analysis of variance for men\nand women separately. For dichoto-\nmous variables, such as history of dis-\nease, diuretic use, and substance abuse,\nthe mean levels of uric acid were mea-\nsured for each group (\"yes\" vs \"no\").\nStatistical significance was tested us-\ning the t test, specifying by sex and race.\nAge- and race-adjusted ischemicheart\ndisease mortality rates, expressed as per\neach quartile of serum uric acid for both\nsexes, using the direct method of stan-\ndardization with the total sample serv-\ningasthestandardpopulation.Themor-\ntality ratio, using the lowest quartile as\nreference for each other quartile of se-\nrum uric acid, was calculated with Man-\ntel-Haenszel method.

The interaction term of uric acid\nlevel and diuretic use was tested in the\nCox regression models.\nThe association of mortality to se-\nrum uric acid level was also estimated\nafter stratifying by age into 3 groups\nby cardiovascular risk status (those with\nany 1 of the risk factors: hypertension\n[with history of hypertension, blood\nantihypertensive medication], choles-\nmg/dL]; with history of diabetes; and\nthose with any 2 of these conditions; as\nwell as those without any of these\nconditions).Theinteractiontermofuric\nacid level and diuretic use was tested in\nCoxregressionmodel.Inaddition,asdi-\nuretic use is related to both serum uric\nacid level and cardiovascular events, the\nsubjects were stratified into 2 groups by\ndiuretic use.

The 729 black\nsubjects (12.3%) had serum uric acid\nlevelsthatwerehigherthaninwhitesub-\njects, and the relative risk of an el-\nevated serum uric acid level was greater\nin black persons than in white persons.\nAfter controlling for potential risk\nfactors, the association of serum uric\nacid levels with cardiovascular mortal-\nity persisted. Even among subjects with\nlow cardiovascular risk (ie, those with-\nout an increased cholesterol level, hy-\npertension, or diabetes), we found that\nincreased serum uric acid levels were\na predictor of cardiovascular mortal-\nity. This association is unlikely to be\nconfounded by other factors in these\nlow-risk subjects.\nRecently, Culleton et al,9 using\nFraminghamHeartStudydata,reported\nthat an elevated serum uric acid level at\nbaseline was not independently associ-\nated with increased risk of cardiovascu-\nlar mortality. They concluded that the\napparent association of serum uric acid\nto cardiovascular events was probably\ndue to confounding by other cardiovas-\ncularriskfactors,particularlybydiuretic\nuse. In our study, however, both after\nstratification and multivariate analysis,\ndiuretic use only affected the associa-\ntion of serum uric acid level with mor-\ntality in the 84 men taking diuretics.\nThe different results seen in these 2\nstudies may be due to differences in the\npopulations studied. The homoge-\nneous Framingham population is al-\nmost exclusively white, while NHANES\nis a vastly more heterogeneous repre-\nsentation of the US population; 12.3%\nof the study subjects were black. Al-\nthough follow-up was similar (17.3 vs\n16.4 years), the mortality rates be-\ntween the 2 studies differed. Most no-\ntably, NHANES participants had a sub-\nstantially higher all-cause mortality rate\nand they had a higher cardiovascular\nson-years) than did Framingham resi-\ndents. Even among whites only, the\nNHANES population had substan-\ntially higher crude all-cause mortality\nyears), as well as a crude cardiovascu-\nlar disease mortality rate (7.0 vs 3.7 per\nham residents. That cardiovascular\nmortality was twice as frequent in the\nNHANES population than in the\nFramingham study provides strong evi-\ndence that the 2 populations are not the\nsame. These population differences may\nhave substantially influenced the dif-\nferent results observed. Besides differ-\nences in survival rates, the 2 groups dif-\nfered in mean age, with NHANES\nparticipants being slightly older than\nyears), and age influenced the relation-\nship of uric acid levels to cardiovascu-\nlar disease mortality.\nThe question then is how to inter-\npret these conflicting results. Both stud-\nies have strong internal validity. Thereal\nissue therefore may be which of the 2\nstudies has greater general applicabil-\nity. We would argue that NHANES,\nwhich represents the total US popula-\ntion, may have broaderrelevance. Inany\nevent, no single observational study can,\nby itself, finally settle the issue. How-\never, the findings in this large national\nsample, together with that of other stud-\nies with similar findings,1-8,10 suggests\nthat perhaps failure to identify an asso-\nciation in Framingham may be an ex-\nception, rather than the rule.\nUric acid is the major product of pu-\nrine metabolism and is formed from\nxanthine by the action of xanthine oxi-\ndase.
