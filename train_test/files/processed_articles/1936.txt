In cohort studies of US health profes-\nsionals, both measured and estimated baseline plasma 25(OH)\nD levels were inversely associated with risk of incident hyper-\ntension separately in men and women.1,2 Participants from\nthe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) in the highest quintile of serum 25(OH)D had\nsignificantly lower mean systolic BP compared with those in\nthe lowest quintile, after adjusting for body mass index (BMI).3\nA recent report from a cross-sectional survey of Hispanics and\nAfrican Americans observed inverse associations between\nplasma 25(OH)D and both systolic and diastolic BP, which\nwere no longer significant after adjusting for BMI.4 In contrast,\nvitamin D supplementation (with calcium) did not lower BP\nin the Women's Health Initiative study,5 probably because of\nthe low vitamin D dose and poor compliance.6\nIt is currently unclear whether the inverse association\nbetween vitamin D status and BP is mediated by blood lev-\nels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Both PTH and vitamin D\nare calciotrophic hormones and their metabolisms are closely\nrelated, such that a decrease in serum 25(OH)D leads to a rise\nin serum PTH.7 Elevated level of PTH has long been linked to\nHowever, only a few epidemiological studies of BP have\nexamined both 25(OH)D and PTH together. Although a US\nprospective study has reported a significant inverse associa-\ntion between baseline 25(OH)D levels and subsequent risk\nof hypertension that is independent of PTH,2 other studies,\nwhich have reported findings for both hormones, have gener-\nally found that BP is more strongly associated with PTH (posi-\ntively) than with 25(OH)D (negatively);14\u00ad16 suggesting that\nthe effect of vitamin D on BP is indirect through to its suppres-\nsion of serum PTH. Moreover, it is unclear whether the find-\nings from these studies apply to the general adult population as\nthey have recruited samples from older age groups,14 wealthy\n1School of Population Health, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.\nCorrespondence: Robert K.

Results were adjusted for these plus\ndemographic variables.\nResults\nSerum 25(OH)D was more strongly associated (inversely) with systolic\nthan diastolic BP. Adjusted mean (standard error) difference in BP\nfor systolic BP and 1.8 (0.6) mm Hg for diastolic BP, compared with\nthe highest quintile (30ng/ml).

However, the\nassociations between 25(OH)D and BP were attenuated, with mean\n(standard error) difference between the highest and lowest quintiles\ndiastolic BP.\nConclusion\nPTH may mediate most of the association between 25(OH)D and BP,\nwhich was not significant when also adjusting for body mass index.\nKeywords:25-hydroxyvitaminD;bloodpressure;hypertension;\nparathyroidhormone;populationsurvey;vitaminD\nAmericanJournalofHypertension, advance online publication 28 April 2011;\noriginal contributions Vitamin D, PTH, and Blood Pressure in NHANES\ncommunities,15 or patient clinics with pre-existing comorbidi-\nties such as obesity.16\nexamining the association between 25(OH)D, PTH, and the\nmetabolic syndrome in fasting participants, found that serum\n25(OH)D was inversely associated with systolic BP (P = 0.005)\nbut not diastolic (P = 0.3), while PTH was not associated with\neither (P = 0.3, 0.2, respectively).17 However, the authors did\nnot indicate whether they simultaneously adjusted for 25(OH)\nD and PTH when analyzing BP, so it is unclear if there were\nany confounding effects between 25(OH)D and PTH on BP. In\nthis article, which also comes from the NHANES surveys, we\nhave made BP the primary outcome variable; and increased the\nsample size several fold from the earlier report by using data\nfor the full survey periods for which PTH data are currently\nfasting participants in our analyses. The increased sample\nsize has allowed us to determine with much greater statistical\npower whether-or-not 25(OH)D and PTH are independently\nassociated with BP.\nMethods\nData in this report come from participants aged 20 years\nCentre for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention. A stratified, multistage sampling design was\nused to recruit participants from household clusters, with\noversampling of non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans.\nThe surveys included a face-to-face interview and a medical\nexamination carried out in a mobile examination center. Full\ndetails have been published of all survey methods, including\nsampling, interview at home, examination at mobile cent-\ners and laboratory measurement of blood samples, ethical\napproval and informed consent.18\nIn the home interview, demographic information regarding\nage, race\u00adethnicity (divided into non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, Mexican American, and other), and gender\nwas collected.18 Participants were also asked whether they\nwere currently taking prescribed antihypertensive drugs, the\nnumber of cigarettes they currently smoked, and the number\nof times they had undertaken common leisure physical activi-\nties in the past month. Metabolic equivalents were assigned\nto each physical activity and totaled; a score of 3.5\u00ad7.0 was\nclassified as doing moderate activities for participants 20\u00ad59\nyears of age, a score of 3.0\u00ad6.0 was classified as doing moderate\nactivities for participants over 60 years of age.19\nThe medical examination was taken within 2 months of\nthe home interview.18 Weight was measured in pounds (later\nconverted to kilograms) using digital scales with participants\nwearing underwear, disposable gowns, and foam slippers.\nStanding height was measured against a vertical backboard\nto the nearest millimeter. BMI was calculated as weight (kg)\ndivided by standing height (m) squared.\nBP was measured at the mobile examination centers by\nphysicians with mercury sphygmomanometers using a stand-\nard protocol. Cuff size was selected according to a standard\nprotocol to ensure that the length and width of the bladder\ninside the cuff encircled 80 and 40% of the upper arm, respec-\ntively. Up to three BP measurements were collected from each\nparticipant while in the sitting position, and averaged after\nexcluding the first measurement if more than one measure-\nment was collected. Systolic BP was defined as the point at\nwhich the first Korotkoff sound was heard; while diastolic BP\nwas the level of mercury 2mm below where the last sound\nwas heard.18 Pulse pressure was calculated as the difference\nbetween systolic and diastolic pressures.\nBlood samples collected during the examination were centri-\nfuged, aliquoted and frozen to -70\u00b0C on site, and shipped on\ndry ice to central laboratories where they were stored at -70\u00b0C\nuntil analysis. Serum 25(OH)D was measured by a radioim-\nmunoassay kit after extraction with acetonitrile (DiaSorin,\nStillwater, MN) by the National Center for Environmental\nHealth, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta,\nGA). PTH was analyzed on an Elecsys 1010 analyzer using\nan electrochemiluminescent process at the University of\nWashington, Seattle, WA.18 The coefficient of variation dur-\nand 2.2\u00ad5.3% for PTH.

The sampling weights\nfor each 2-year survey period were halved so that results\nwere applicable to the current US population. Multiple linear\nregression was performed using PROC REGRESS with BP as\nthe dependent variable. BP (systolic, diastolic, and pulse pres-\nsure), serum calcium, and serum creatinine were all analyzed\nas continuous variables. All had normal distributions except\ncreatinine, which was transformed to the natural logarithm\nin data analyses. Values for the categories of other continuous\nvariables (age, BMI) are shown in Table 1. The P values from\nall statistical tests were two sided.\nResults\nTable1 shows mean levels of serum 25(OH)D and PTH, by level\nof demographic variable, physical activity, cigarette smoking,\nBP medication status, and BMI, adjusted for all variables in the\ntable. Older participants had lower 25(OH)D and higher PTH\nlevels than those who were younger. Non-Hispanic whites had\noriginal contributions\nVitamin D, PTH, and Blood Pressure in NHANES\nthe highest 25(OH)D and the lowest PTH level, whereas non-\nHispanic blacks were the opposite, with Mexican Americans in\nbetween. Physical activity was strongly related (positively) with\nserum 25(OH)D, but had a much weaker (inverse) associa-\ntion with PTH. Participants taking BP medication had signifi-\ncantly (P = 0.0001) higher PTH levels than those not, with no\n\ndifference in mean 25(OH)D level between these two groups.\nBMI was associated inversely with serum 25(OH)D and posi-\ntively with serum PTH. In contrast, participants who smoked\n20 cigarettes per day had lower serum levels of both 25(OH)D\npared to those who had never smoked cigarettes, adjusting for\nall variables in Table 1.\nTable 2 shows mean systolic BP by quintile of serum 25(OH)\nD and PTH for four models. In model 1, which adjusted for age,\ngender, ethnicity, physical activity, cigarette smoking, BP medi-\ncation status, serum calcium, and serum creatinine, systolic BP\nvaried across 25(OH)D quintiles being 3.5mm Hg higher in\nthe lowest vitamin D quintile compared with the highest (P <\n0.0001). Adding PTH to the model decreased the mean differ-\nences in the higher 25(OH)D quintiles compared to the low-\nest (model 2), although there was still a significant difference\nA similar pattern was seen when BMI was added (model 3).\nHowever, in model 4, which contained both PTH and BMI, the\nassociation between 25(OH)D and systolic BP was attenuated so\nthat the difference in BP between the highest and lowest 25(OH)\nD quintiles was no longer significant (P = 0.07).\nTable 3 shows the same four models for diastolic BP, which\nwas significantly raised in the two lowest serum 25(OH)D\nquintiles compared with the highest, adjusting for the vari-\nables in model 1 (P = 0.007). However, adding PTH (model\n2) attenuated the association between 25(OH)D and diastolic\npressure so that the mean difference between the highest and\nA similar pattern was seen after adding BMI (model 3).\nIn contrast, because serum 25(OH)D was more strongly\nassociated (inversely) with systolic than diastolic BP, there was\na significant inverse association between 25(OH)D and pulse\npressure, which was significantly raised in the lowest 25(OH)\nD quintile compared with the highest, with the P value from\nThe association between serum 25(OH)D and BP did not\nvary with age. When 25(OH)D was modeled as a continuous\nvariable and age as a dummy variable categorized as 1 for 50\nyears and 0 for below, the P value for the interaction term from\nthe product of these two variables was not significant for all\nthree BP measures (for systolic P = 0.86, diastolic P = 0.31,\nA different pattern was seen for serum PTH than for 25(OH)\nD. In model 1, which did not include BMI or serum 25(OH)\nD, there was a significant positive association in both systolic\nand diastolic BP with increasing PTH quintile (P < 0.0001),\nwith mean differences in BP between the lowest and highest\nquintiles being 5.9 and 4.5mm Hg, respectively (Tables 2 and\n3). These differences in systolic and diastolic BP between PTH\nquintiles decreased with the addition of 25(OH)D (model 2)\nand of BMI to the model (model 3), but still remained very\nsignificant. Because PTH had associations of similar magni-\ntude with systolic and diastolic BP, it was unrelated to pulse\npressure in all four models in Table 4.\nTable 1| Mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and\nparathyroid hormone (PTH), adjusted for all other variables in\nthe table, by level of demographic variable, physical activity,\ncigarette smoking, blood pressure medication and body mass\nVariable Number\nD (SE), nmol/l\nMean PTH\n(SE), ng/l\nGender\nEthnicity\nPhysical activity (per month)\nCigarette smoking\nBlood pressure medication\nBMI (kg/m2)\nBMI, body mass index; NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys.\noriginal contributions Vitamin D, PTH, and Blood Pressure in NHANES\nDiscussion\nWe have shown in this representative sample of the US popula-\ntion that serum PTH is associated positively with both systolic\nand diastolic BP independently of serum 25(OH)D and BMI.\nIn contrast, serum 25(OH)D is associated inversely only with\nsystolic BP (and not with diastolic), after controlling for either\nPTH or BMI but not both; and with pulse pressure independ-\nently of both PTH and BMI.
