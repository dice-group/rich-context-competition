Research shows that people feel sadness in response to losses\nbut it's unclear whether sad expressions function to communicate losses to others and if so, what makes these signals credible.\nHere we use economic games to test the hypothesis that sad expressions lend credibility to claims of loss. Participants play the\nrole of either a proposer or recipient in a game with a fictional backstory and real monetary payoffs. The proposers view a\n(fictional) video of the recipient's character displaying either a neutral or sad expression paired with a claim of loss. The proposer\nthen decided how much money to give to the recipient. In three experiments, we test alternative theories by using situations in\nwhich the recipient's losses were uncertain (Experiment 1), the recipient's losses were certain (Experiment 2), or the recipient\nclaims failed gains rather than losses (Experiment 3). Overall, we find that participants gave more money to recipients who\ndisplayed sad expressions compared to neutral expressions, but only under conditions of uncertain loss. This finding supports the\nhypothesis that sad expressions function to increase the credibility of claims of loss.\n",

Drooping eyelids, downcast eyes, lowered lip corners,\nand slanting inner eyebrows have an arresting effect on observ-\ners. However, the social functions of sad expressions are not well\nunderstood. We test whether sadness functions to enhance a\nperson's credibility when they claim to have suffered a loss.\nWe can better understand sad faces by considering the evo-\nlutionary functions of facial expressions more generally.\nDarwin (1998) proposed that facial expressions serve mainly\nphysiological functions by changing the configuration of facial\nmuscles in response to environmental stimuli. For example,\nfear expressions widen the eyes and raise the eyebrows to\nincrease peripheral vision (Susskind, Lee, Cusi, Grabski, &\nAnderson, 2008), and disgust expressions protrude the tongue\nand constrict the nose to reduce exposure to pathogens\n(Chapman, Kim, Susskind, & Anderson, 2009). Furthermore,\nDarwin's antithesis principle holds that some emotions cause\nthe opposite facial movements of opposite emotions. For exam-\nple, happiness causes raised cheeks and lip corners because\nnegative emotions depress (sadness), dimple (contempt), or\nMore recently, evolutionary theorists proposed that some\nemotional expressions serve communicative functions by\nshowing how initial physiological responses later evolved as\nWhat messages might sad expressions function to commu-\nnicate? People feel sadness in response to losses such as losing\nresources, status, friends, or romantic partners (Nesse, 1990).\nFurthermore, sadness is more intense when the lost resources\nhad greater value for biological fitness (Tooby & Cosmides,\n1990). For example, parents experience more intense grief in\nresponse to the death of a child when they are closer to repro-\nductive age (Crawford, Salter, & Jang, 1989).

By drawing attention\ninward, an individual can dwell on misfortunes in order to\ninvest cognitive resources toward learning to avoid similar\nhardships in the future and developing plans to mitigate the\nloss in the present. The sad expression could complement this\nfunction by signaling losses to others in order to recruit help\ntoward recovering from the misfortune. Related, one theory\nproposes that the chronic state of sadness found in depression\nfunctions in part to communicate losses (Fridlund, 1994) in\norder to solicit help from other people (Ekman, 2003; Lewis,\nThe theory that sad expressions signal losses raises two\nimportant questions. The first question is why receivers might\naltruistically help a sad signaler who has experienced a loss.\nSeveral theories can potentially explain a desire to compensate\nlosses. Direct and indirect reciprocity theories imply that com-\npensating a loss could create a debt that the creditor can redeem\nwelfare-tradeoff theory is a version of reciprocity theory in\nwhich people are more likely to help a person who has suffered\na loss when there is a favorable ratio of costs to self versus\nbenefits to the recipient, creating a good opportunity to invest\nin valuable social relationships (Delton & Robertson, 2016;\npooling theory holds that humans help others who suffer mis-\nfortunes in order to pool risk and smooth consumption over\ntime (H. Kaplan, Hill, Lancaster, & Hurtado, 2000; H. S.\nKaplan, Schniter, Smith, & Wilson, 2012).\nThe second question, and our primary interest, is why recei-\nvers should take sad expressions at face value. If the function of\nsad expressions is to solicit resources, then individuals could\nfake the signal in order to manipulate receivers into providing\nresources even when a loss did not occur. That is, receivers can\nbenefit from helping cooperative partners, but only at the risk\nof being duped by cheaters who fake or exaggerate their losses\n(Dawkins & Krebs, 1978). This presents a difficult adaptive\nproblem. Receivers who indiscriminately share resources with\nrequesters are vulnerable to cheaters. On the other hand, recei-\nvers who shun all requesters could damage their reputations\nand lose valuable partners who have honestly suffered a loss.\nThis reasoning suggests that people should be moderately skep-\ntical toward claims of loss in order to distinguish honest from\ndeceptive pleas for help.\nPrevious research has addressed this issue by arguing that\nemotional expressions are designed to increase the credibility\nof the messages they accompany (R. H. Frank, 1988; Hirshlei-\ntially fake emotions such as anger, sadness, or disgust which\nwould lead receivers to eventually ignore the associated\nexpressions as deceptive \"cheap talk\" (Dawkins & Krebs,\n1978). However, emotional signals can still be favored by evo-\nlution if they are difficult or costly to fake (R. H. Frank, 1988;\nevolutionary theories of communication (Maynard Smith &\nHarper, 2003) have shown how honest signals can be main-\ntained by evolution in multiple ways including when (a) the\nsignaler and receiver have the same goals instead of conflicting\ninterests, (b) the signal is an index of the underlying trait that is\ndifficult to fake (e.g., when a roar is an index for body size), (c)\nthe signal is more costly to send for one type than another,\ngenerating a separating equilibrium (the same can occur for a\nconstant cost with a differential benefit); importantly, these\ndifferential costs can be costs of producing the signal or costs\nassociated with the consequences of faking the signal, for\nexample, if liars are punished when detected.\nFor emotions, it is clear that emotional expressions are, at\nleast, difficult to consciously fake (which is not the same as\ndifficult for faking to evolve, see below). A characteristic fea-\nture of emotions is that they are mostly involuntary and diffi-\ncult to consciously control. Even with professional training,\nactors often find it difficult to fake realistic emotional expres-\nsions. Studies show that people's emotional expressions reli-\nably coincide with their self-reported feelings as well as\nphysiological states (Ekman, Levenson, & Friesen, 1983;\nRosenberg & Ekman, 2005). Furthermore, the facial muscles\nused in expressions are difficult to activate in the absence of\nrelevant emotions and difficult to inhibit in the presence of\nrelevant emotions (Ekman & Friesen, 1982; Ekman, Levenson,\n& Friesen, 1985). These include two facial actions involved in\nthe expression of sadness: the inner eyebrow raiser (medial\nfrontalis) and the lip corner depressor (triangularis). Finally,\nfacial expressions have been shown to accurately reflect both\nemotional experiences (Izard, 1971) and action tendencies (Fri-\nImportantly, the fact that emotions are difficult to con-\nsciously fake does not by itself mean that it is difficult for faked\nexpressions to evolve. Hence, additional arguments are\nrequired to explain why emotional expressions might remain\noutside of conscious control, rather than natural selection\nfavoring mutants who can fake them. Several of the standard\nevolutionary arguments about signals could apply to emotional\nexpressions, including common interests, reliable indices, or\ndifferential costs (or benefits).\nMost commonly, credibility theories hold that evolution\nfavored emotional expressions that were both honest and dif-\nficult to consciously fake because individuals with these char-\nacteristics attracted better social partners than their more\nrational competitors (R. H. Frank, 1988; Tooby & Cosmides,\n1996). Hence, the basic idea is that liars suffer greater social\ncosts by losing quality partners. For example, in the context of\nromantic love, people prefer mates who are emotionally and\ninvoluntarily attached to them, since this predicts that the mate\nis less likely to desert the individual for a romantic competitor\nsignal their irrational romantic emotions thereby gain an advan-\ntage in competing for mates. In contrast, cheaters who fake\ntheir attachment while in fact courting additional mates are\ntypically found out and abandoned. The same idea applies to\naltruism and cooperation: People prefer partners who help\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nbased on involuntary altruistic feelings rather than partners\nwho only calculate the future benefits to themselves for help-\ning. In this social world, people who help based on involuntary\nemotions gain an evolutionary advantage in the competition for\nquality partners.\nEvolution could also favor honesty if liars suffer greater\ncosts of punishment. Punishments could come in the form of\nwithheld resources, direct attacks, or reputational damage. If\nthese costly consequences outweigh the immediate benefits of\ndishonesty, then evolution can favor honest emotional expres-\nAdditionally, an emotional expression could potentially be\nan index of an underlying emotional state that is difficult to\nfake. This could occur if emotional expressions are components\nwithin a larger suite of processes included in an emotion that\nare together activated involuntarily (Cosmides & Tooby,\n2000). There are good functional reasons why basic emotions\nlike fear and disgust remain outside of conscious control--so\nindividuals cannot easily override them to engage in damaging\nbehaviors like jumping off of cliffs or eating rotten corpses. If\nemotional expressions are contained within the larger cogni-\ntive architecture of an emotional program, then they would be\ninvoluntary by default and hence reliable indices of the emo-\ntional state. Of course, in principle, evolution could favor a\nmutant with a dissociated emotional expression that is under\nconscious control; however, this might be unlikely to occur\ndue to developmental constraints. By analogy, although it\ncould be advantageous and is certainly possible for a human\nto mutate a third eye on the back of the head, this possibility is\nlimited by developmental constraints (Williams, 1997). For\nsimilar reasons, it might be difficult for mutations to dissoci-\nate a complex facial expression from its origin within an\ninvoluntary emotional program. If so, this would maintain\nemotional expressions as reliable indices of underlying\nemotional states.\nHence, there are several possible evolutionary pathways that\ncould theoretically maintain honest emotional expressions.\nHowever, whether a particular emotional expression in fact\ntends to be honest and whether it is interpreted by receivers\nas honest (at least more likely to be honest) are empirical\nquestions that need to be addressed case by case for each\nemotional expression.\nCredibility theories have been investigated in several studies\nof specific facial expressions. Reed, Zeglen, and Schmidt (2012)\nmeasured participants' facial expressions during their promises\nto cooperate in an anonymous, one-shot, prisoner's dilemma\ngame. Receivers judged participants who smiled during their\npromises to be more likely to cooperate. Furthermore, the recei-\nvers were correct: Smiles were associated with increased rates of\ncooperation. Similar findings for smiles were found in other\nstudies examining the dictator game (Brown & Moore, 2002)\nand trust game (Berg & McCabe, 1995; Centorrino, Djemai,\nHopfensitz, Milinski, & Seabright, 2015).\nAngry expressions, on the other hand, were found to\nincrease the credibility of threats. Using an ultimatum game,\nReed, DeScioli, and Pinker (2014) found that a responder's\nwritten threats paired with an angry facial expression resulted\nin higher proposer offers in comparison to threats paired with a\nneutral expression. Furthermore, the effects of anger were\ngreater when the responder's demand was excessive (70% of\nmoney) and hence doubtful, compared to a fairer and inherently\ncredible demand of 50%. This suggests that angry expressions\nhave particularly potent effects on a receiver when the resolve\nof the sender might otherwise be in doubt.\nHere we propose the credibility hypothesis for sad facial\nexpressions. This hypothesis holds that signalers use sad\nexpressions to add credibility to claims of loss in order to solicit\nhelp. In response, receivers attribute greater credibility to\nclaims of loss that are bolstered by sad expressions. This\nhypothesis predicts that receivers will be more willing to share\nresources with requesters who show sad versus neutral expres-\nsions. In contrast, a cheap-talk hypothesis that sad faces are\nunreliable and manipulative signals predicts that a receiver's\ncontributions will not be swayed by a show of sadness. We test\nthese possibilities in Experiment 1.\nThe Current Investigation\nWe designed an economic game to investigate the communi-\ncative functions of sad expressions. In this game, one partici-\npant is the proposer who has 90 cents and another participant is\nthe recipient who can ask the proposer for money after facing a\nrisk of losing their own 90 cents (see below). The recipient\nsends a message to the proposer about whether they lost their\nmoney, which might or might not be true. Then the proposer\ndecides whether to send up to 30 cents to the recipient, based on\nwhether they want to help and whether they believe the reci-\npient's message. This is a variant of the dictator game in which\na proposer decides how much money to transfer to a recipient\nThe credibility hypothesis predicts that proposers will be\nmore likely to believe and send money to the recipient when\ntheir message is paired with a sad face compared to a neutral\nface. In contrast, if participants view a sad face as only cheap\ntalk, then we will observe no effects on how much money\nparticipants send to recipients.\nExperiment 1\nMethod\nParticipants were proposers or recipients in a modified dictator\ngame. Proposers were paired with a real participant as the\nrecipient, but they viewed a video and message that were actu-\nally from a confederate actor. This allowed us to control and\nmanipulate the content of the video and message. The video\nclips showed either a neutral or sad facial expression paired\nwith a written message stating that the recipient suffered a loss\nof their endowment (see below). Proposers did not know\nwhether this message was true.\nWe presented the game to participants using a fictional story\nwith real payoffs. We used a fictional scenario to provide a\nReed and DeScioli 3\nconcrete situation in which an individual could be uncertain\nabout another person's claim of loss. Participants played the\nroles of two people going fishing to earn money. Participants\nread that they usually catch 90 fish but might not catch any if\nthey are unlucky. Furthermore, the fishers knew that a storm\nwas coming and there was a 50% chance that the storm would\nmake them lose any fish they caught. Participants read that\neach fish was worth 1 cent in real money.\nThe proposer learned that they caught 90 fish without losing\nany in the storm. Then the proposer viewed a brief, prerecorded\nvideo along with a written message from the recipient. In real-\nity, the message was preset and the video was previously\nrecorded with a confederate actress. The video showed either\na sad or neutral facial expression. The written message paired\nwith the video stated: \"I caught 90 fish, but I lost them all in the\nstorm.\" According to the scenario, the proposer could not know\nfor sure if this message was true and whether the recipient\nreally lost their fish. The proposer had to decide for themselves\nwhether to believe the recipient's message. Finally, the propo-\nser decided whether to send up to 30 of their own fish to the\nrecipient.\nParticipants\nusing Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), an online crowd-\nsourcing website in which individuals sign up to complete tasks\n(Buhrmeister, Kwang, & Gosling, 2011; Horton, Rand, & Zec-\nkhauser, 2011). We chose a sample size with sufficient power\nto detect a medium effect size (d \u00bc 0.5, power \u00bc 0.86). Parti-\ndistribution was: 87.7% Caucasian, 5.3% African American,\n6% Asian American, and 1% other.\nProcedure\nParticipants were randomly assigned as proposer or recipient.\nParticipants read a consent form followed by a description of\nthe fishing scenario. Each participant was paid US$0.50 for\ncompleting the study and could earn extra money (paid in\nMTurk bonus payments) depending on their decisions. Partici-\npants read the instructions describing the interaction between a\nproposer and a recipient in a fictional fishing scenario. Impor-\ntantly, participants read that although the scenario was fic-\ntional, their partner and the payments were real. Participants\nwere required to correctly answer three comprehension ques-\ntions in order to proceed. Each question presented a hypothe-\ntical number of fish that were caught and shared and then asked\nhow much money the participant would earn (e.g., \"Say that\nyou catch 30 fish. Let's also say that the other participant\ncatches 70 fish. If you give 15 fish to the other participant,\nhow much money will you earn?\"). Participants were given\nas many opportunities to answer these questions as needed and\ncould only proceed after each was correctly answered. No par-\nticipants were excluded on this basis. After the game, partici-\npants reported demographic information and were debriefed.\nFor the bonuses from the game, proposers received US$0.90\nminus the amount that they sent to the recipient, and recipients\nreceived the amount that their partner sent to them (in addition\nto the base pay of 50 cents). Each participant completed a\nsingle trial of this task in 5\u00ad7 min.\nIn the game, proposers decided how much of their 90 cents\nto send to recipients, and recipients did not make a decision.\nBefore deciding, proposers viewed a written message and brief\nvideo purportedly sent by their partner (see Figures 4 and 5 for\nstill images of the neutral and sad clips, respectively). The\nwritten message stated \"I caught 90 fish, but I lost them all\nin the storm.\" The videos showed the same, female, college-\naged confederate with either a sad or neutral expression. For\nthe sad expression, we trained and instructed the confederate\nto create the facial action units (AUs) described for sadness in\nthe Facial Action Coding System (Juslin & Scherer, 2005).\nThese consisted of AU1; inner eyebrow raiser, AU4; brow\nfurrower, AU15; lip corner depressor, AU43; upper eyelid\nlowerer; and AU64; eyes down (Ekman, Friesen, & Hager,\n1978). We showed video clips instead of static pictures\nbecause they provide richer emotional content (Ambadar,\nframes per second and lasted 6 s in length. This duration is\nsimilar in length to the average 4\u00ad6 s reported for spontaneous\nexpressions (M. G. Frank, Ekman, & Friesen, 1993; Schmidt,\nAmbadar, Cohn, & Reed, 2006). After viewing the video and\nmessage, proposers decided how many fish to send to the\nrecipient and how many to keep for themselves. Proposers\nthen rated how happy, sad, angry, fearful, and disgusted their\npartner appeared in the video on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1\n\u00bc not at all to 7 \u00bc extremely).\nResults and Discussion\nWe analyze only the proposers' (n \u00bc 151) decisions, since\nrecipients did not make a decision in the game. As a manipula-\ntion check, we first examined participant ratings of the (con-\nfederate) recipient's emotions depicted in the video clip (see\nTable 1). Importantly, participants rated the sad clip as more\nparticipants rated the sad clip as less happy (M \u00bc 1.25,\nTable 1.

How-\never, an alternative interpretation of these results is that sad\nexpressions automatically evoke empathy and helping, whether\nor not the loss is uncertain. Experiment 2 distinguishes these\ntwo accounts by testing the effects of sad faces when the pro-\nposer is certain about the recipient's loss. The credibility\nhypothesis predicts that in this case, sadness will no longer\nboost contributions because there is no uncertainty to resolve,\nwhereas the automatic-empathy hypothesis predicts similar\neffects of sadness when loss is certain.\nParticipants\nfemales), choosing a sample size with sufficient power to\ndetect a medium effect size (d \u00bc 0.5, power \u00bc 0.86).

Following data collection,\nproposers and recipients were randomly matched and the pay-\nouts were calculated accordingly.\nResults and Discussion\nWe analyze only the proposers' (n \u00bc 151) decisions, since\nrecipients did not make a decision in the game. As in Experi-\nment 1, participants rated the sad clip as more sad (M \u00bc 6.40,\nclip as less happy (M \u00bc 1.11, SD \u00bc 0.26) than the neutral clip\nTable 2 for additional emotion ratings). Proposers' offers did\nnot differ by gender or ethnicity (all ps > .05), so we aggregated\nacross these categories in subsequent analyses.\nFigure 2 shows the main results. Proposers' contributions\nto the recipient with a sad expression (M \u00bc 13.12, SD \u00bc\n17.11) did not differ from the recipient with a neutral\nNeutral Sad\nEXPRESSION\nFigure 1.

This indicates that when a message was\nalready credible for other reasons, sad expressions had little\neffect on proposer offers, rather than automatically boosting\nempathy and helping.\nExperiment 3\nMethod\nIn Experiment 3, we test whether sad faces elicit compensation\nfor losses, specifically, or if they also elicit compensation for\nfailed gains. Previous theories of sadness focus on losses\n(Nesse, 1990). However, people are also harmed by failing to\nrealize gains which could be another source of sad signals. For\nexample, a person who failed to find a job could be in just as\ndire of a situation as someone who lost their job.\nEven so, there are a few reasons why sadness might elicit\ngreater help for losses than failed gains. One reason is that\nlosses are often due to misfortunes outside of the person's\ncontrol, whereas failed gains can result both from misfortune\nand also low effort. Someone who lost a resource must have at\nleast made enough effort to acquire it in the first place, whereas\nsomeone who never had the resource might have made little or\nno effort at all. Hence, individuals who compensate failed gains\ncould be more vulnerable to cheating by those who expend\nlittle effort. A second reason is that a person's possible losses\nare limited to what they have, whereas someone's possible\nunrealized gains are unlimited. People's compensation beha-\nvior might be less attuned to failed gains because they are too\nopen ended and numerous to practically manage.\nTo test for specificity, we use the same methods as Experi-\nment 1 except that proposers are presented with a recipient's\nuncertain failed gain rather than loss. The general-\ncompensation hypothesis predicts that sad faces will show the\nsame effect for claims of failed gains, whereas the loss-specific\nhypothesis predicts that sad faces will have a lesser effect for\nclaims of failed gains.\nParticipants\nfemales), choosing a sample size with sufficient power to\ndetect a medium effect size (d \u00bc 0.5, power \u00bc 0.87).

The results support the\ncredibility hypothesis that sad expressions add credibility to\nclaims of loss and motivate receivers to share more resources.\nIn contrast, we did not find evidence for the automatic empathy\nTable 3.

Error bars represent +1 standard\nerror.\n6 Evolutionary Psychology\nhypothesis: Sad expressions did not elicit greater sharing when\nthere was no uncertainty to resolve. Furthermore, we found that\nthe effects of sadness are specific to losses and did not extend to\nfailed gains. Overall, we find that sad expressions elicit help\nfrom others mainly under conditions of uncertainty and loss.\nThese results dovetail with previous studies finding that\ncertain emotional expressions affect a viewer's behavior in\nstrategic interactions. For instance, participants showed greater\ncooperation with partners who smiled (Berg, & McCabe, 1995;\n& Schmidt, 2012) and they made greater concessions to part-\nners who flashed an angry grimace (Reed, DeScioli, & Pinker,\n2014). Furthermore, they provide additional support for cred-\nibility theories for emotional expressions more generally (R. H.\ncould test this idea with other emotional expressions. For\nexample, fearful expressions may increase the credibility of\nwarnings about danger, while disgust expressions may increase\nthe credibility of claims that a substance is contaminated or\nthat the sender opposes a moral violation (Tybur, Lieberman,\nIn the present experiments, we examined situations in which\nparticipants were uncertain about whether a loss occurred. We\nnote that sadness could also convey credibility about how\ndamaging the loss is to the signaler. For example, even if\nsomeone is certain that a worker lost their job, they could still\nbe uncertain about the severity of the unemployed worker's\nhardship. For instance, the worker might have savings or family\nto rely on, they might have found temporary unreported work,\nand they might have passed up possible jobs. In this situation,\nthe unemployed worker's sad expression could add credibility\nto claims of urgent hardship, distinguishing from less urgent\nneeds. Hence, a sad expression could communicate information\nthat reduces uncertainty about the extent of threat posed by the\nloss even when there is little uncertainty about whether the loss\noccurred.\nThe stimulus expressions in these experiments were actually\nfaked by the confederate which perhaps makes it even more\nsurprising that participants attributed credibility to them. How-\never, we note that our confederate actress had several advan-\ntages compared to a typical person who displays an emotional\nexpression. Unlike typical signalers, the confederate received\nspecific training using the Facial Action Coding System that\nhelped them learn to give a convincing display. She had mul-\ntiple opportunities and multiple takes to make a convincing\npitch. And, she had to be convincing only for a few seconds,\nwhereas in a real interaction, the signaler would need to main-\ntain a convincing display for longer and under scrutiny and\npossibly even interrogation by a receiver. Hence, given these\nadvantages, it might be less surprising that the confederate's\nposed expression appeared believable to participants. Even so,\nfuture research could examine spontaneous expressions to test\nwhether they are even more potent (though this is likely to pose\ndifficult challenges for experimental control).\nFuture research can also vary other characteristics of sad\nexpressions including the individual's characteristics such as\ngender, age, ethnicity, attractiveness, formidability, and other\nkey factors. For instance, we used a female actress and a male\nactor might elicit different responses, for example, a male's sad\nface might be less convincing or could also be associated with\nweakness.\nAlthough the current findings shed light on the communi-\ncative functions of sad expressions, they do not address why a\nsad expression (characterized by drooping eyelids, downcast\neyes, lowered lip corners, and slanted inner eyebrows) involve\nthe specific changes in facial musculature that they do. Past\nresearch has studied the specific muscular configurations of\nother expressions. For example, fear expressions increase sen-\nsory exposure (Susskind et al., 2008) and approximate\n\"babyish\" faces (Marsh, Adams, & Kleck, 2005; Marsh,\nAmbady, & Kleck, 2005), disgust expressions reduce exposure\nto pathogens (Chapman et al., 2009), and angry expressions\nexaggerate cues of formidability (Sell et al., 2009). Similar\nwork on the functions of sad expression may shed more light\non this question.\nThese findings help understand the ways that sad expres-\nsions affect how people request and share resources in per-\nsonal, face-to-face interactions, and possibly why people\nmight be less likely to help in response to impersonal requests.\nSimilarly, these results could help charities, foundations, and\nfundraisers solicit resources through the media. Many charities\nFigure 5. Apex frame of sadness clip.\nFigure 4. Single frame of neutral clip.\nReed and DeScioli 7\nhave discovered that advertisements that pair a worthy cause\nwith an image of a helpless, sick, or endangered person dis-\nplaying a sad expression can increase donations. The present\nfindings suggest that these images, in addition to promoting\nempathy, could unconsciously boost the viewer's perception\nof the victim's credibility. Charities might be able to make\nrequests for aid even more effective by further enhancing cues\nof credibility. Finally, these findings show some of the uncon-\nscious processes behind our own choices about whether or not\nto help others in need.\nAuthors' Notes\nLawrence Ian Reed, Department of Psychiatry, McLean Hospital Har-\nvard Medical School; Peter DeScioli, Department of Political Science,\nStony Brook University.\n"
