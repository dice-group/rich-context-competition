Although attempts to analyse brand placements have been made\nin the past, the same needs more attention in the Indian context. Given the exposure of\nIndian audiences to both national and international entertainment industry, it is only\nreasonable to expect the entertainment event context to have an impact on consumers'\nevaluation of the brands placed in each context.\nThe present research attempts to extend the applicability of the idea of fit, which was\ntill now largely confined to sponsorship and subjects it to the exploration of finding a\nfit between brands and specific events, in particular, movies. Because the link between\ncountry of origin of the entertainment event (national/international) and brand, place-\nment is a relevant area of speculation, the present research aims to study this relation-\nship within the national/international context. Results of an experimental study among\n120 respondents are as follows:\n\u00b7 Brands placed in a national event will create more positive brand evaluations in\nterms of positive attitude towards the placed brand and intention to purchase than\nbrands that are placed in an international event.\n\u00b7 When the presence of a brand is consistent with the context in which it is placed, it\nwould evoke more positive attitudes and behaviour than an incongruent placement.\n\u00b7 Evaluation of results further reveals that although a brand that fits well with the\ncontext in which it is placed generates a positive evaluation of the placed brand, the\ncondition of a brand-event misfit in a Hollywood context will create more negative\nevaluations among the Indian audiences than if such a disconnect appeared in a\nHindi film. In other words, a brand may have more to lose in case of a misfit with the\ninternational entertainment event than with a national entertainment event.\nBased on the findings of the present study, it is suggested that multinational brands\nmust look at the Indian movies as a suitable medium for reaching out to the prospective\nbuyers as Indians have become consumers of global brands and thus pose to be a huge\nmarket for global brands.\nVIKALPA\nThe Journal for Decision Makers\nManagement, Ahmedabad\nSAGE Publications\nsagepub.in/home.nav\nhttp://vik.sagepub.com\nExecutive\nSummary\nAs the line between entertainment and marketing\ncommunication gets increasingly blended or\neven erased (de Gregorio & Sung, 2010; Eagle,\nof brand placement in an entertainment context receives\nconsiderable attention from scholars and practitioners\nalike. Although there are many definitions of the term,\nbrand or product placement have often been used inter-\nchangeably and generally refer to the use of a prod-\nuct's name, packaging, signage, or other trademarks in\nScreening thousands of films every year, the film industry\nis fast emerging as the medium with the maximum\npotential to capture and convert audiences to potential\nconsumers. Tag Heuer in Don (2006), Coke in Dhoom 2\nin Pearl Harbour (2001), product placements have a very\nsignificant role in Indian1 and international2 movies. Such\nplacements have also started to appear in television series\neven books (Kretchmer, 2004; Moser, Bryant, & Sylvester,\nplacement in these media, however, remains the same:\ngenerating additional income for the producer while\ncreating an opportunity for the advertisers to present\ntheir offering in an entertainment context (Russell &\nBelch, 2005). By doing so, not only does the offering reach\na larger audience, but it also gets a much longer life than\na 30-second commercial.\nWhile product placement is riskier than conventional\nadvertising, it is becoming a common practice to place\nproducts and brands into mainstream media, including\nfilms, which are an extremely popular medium among\nadvertisers. Also, with the traditional media getting\novercrowded and nearly saturated, the concept of\nproduct placement has become even more popular\nas a communication technique, which is now being\nused more than ever by advertisers (Karrh, Mckee,\n& Pardum, 2003). A lot of research has focused on\nproduct placement in all its forms (Gupta & Gould,\nplacement in movies (Karrh, 1998). Brand placement\nin movies seems to be well accepted (O'Reilly, Cripps,\nKazani, Patel, & Zarra, 2005) and is sometimes consid-\nered less expensive and more effective than a 30-second\nTV spot (Jaffe, 2005), resulting in a more frequent use of\nthis communication technique.\nHowever, in the era of expanding global competition,\nwhere companies are trying hard to reach out to their\ncustomers effectively and efficiently to market their\nproduct and services to different national cultures,\nan important yet lurking question that remains unan-\nswered is: To what extent have marketers been able\nto successfully reach their customers? Although\nproduct placement utilizes the global reach of movies,\nminimal research has been conducted to study the\neffects of product placement across cultures. Therefore,\nof particular interest in this study is the influence of\nbrand placements in an entertainment event, especially\nmovies that represent two different cultures. How do\nviewers perceive brands placed in movies? Do brands\nplaced in Indian movies have a different impact on\nviewers than brands placed in international movies?\nShould the advertisers and marketers, therefore, view\nthe placement of their brands in national and interna-\ntional entertainment contexts differently? To answer\nthese questions, the study focuses on the opinions of\npeople who are viewers of both Indian and interna-\ntional movies.\nA review of brand placement studies indicates a major\ngap in the literature. Previous studies of brand place-\nment were largely conducted in the US with little focus\non it as a global phenomenon (DeLorme, 1998; Grein\n& Grould, 1996) given the fact that many movies play\nto and are often produced for multinational audiences,\nraising the issue of how consumers in other countries\nperceive product placements. Also, while product\nplacement has been researched extensively (Karrh,\nin studies that have focused on one or more of the\nplacement's characteristics, in particular, its prom-\nplot connection (d'Astous & Chartier, 2000; Fontaine,\nstudies if a brand placed in a matching context would\nhave any effect on consumer's evaluation behaviour.\nAnd till date no study, either at the national or the inter-\nnational level, has examined the effects of brand place-\nment's fit/misfit within movies. Being the first of its\nkind, the present study finds its need and relevance by\ninvestigating congruence between entertainment event\nand brand.\nFurthermore, given the exposure of Indian audiences\nto both national and international entertainment\nindustry, it is only reasonable to expect the country of\norigin of the entertainment event to have an impact\non consumer's evaluation. Because the link between\nthe country of origin of the entertainment event and\nbrand placement is a relevant area of speculation,\nthe present research aims to study this relationship\nincluding national/international context. And even\nthough measures of product placement evaluation\nhave been problematic, product placement is a fast\ngrowing multi-billion dollar industry (McDonnell\n& Drennan, 2010) making the present study relevant\nfor both, advertisers and marketers. A great deal of\nresearch has already been devoted to product place-\nment in movies; however, this article strives to present,\nfor the first time, the effect of fit between brand and the\nentertainment event on consumer's brand evaluation.\nThere are enough reasons that suggest the growth of\nproduct placement. The erosion of traditional media\naudience and its fragmentation on the one hand\n(Deloitte, 2005) and the use of alternate media such as\nthe internet, allowing consumers to skip ads (O'Neill &\nBarrett, 2004) on the other hand, has forced the adver-\ntisers to seek a more reliable media to re-establish the\nlink between their offering and their consumers. In\nsuch a scenario, product placement has surfaced as\nan important tool for the advertisers and marketers,\nposing as competition to the traditional commercial\nmedium of advertising.\nIn movies, the role of brand placement has increased\nin recent times. Initially, brands were typically featured\nin movies in three ways: the product itself was shown,\na logo of the brand was displayed, or a brand was\ndisplayed as a background prop (Smith, 1985). The role\nhas changed ever since, from the brand being a mere\nprop in the background to being a central part of the\nmovie, thereby increasing its prominence. The promi-\nnence of brand placement is defined as `the capacity of\nthe brand to attract the spectator's attention' (Fontaine,\n2001). Among other factors, such as the size and dura-\ntion of the brand's placement on screen (Fontaine,\n2002), this capacity can be linked to the brand's location\nin the scene (Gupta & Lord, 1998) and the number of\ntimes the brand appears on the screen (Bressoud, Lehu,\nNo matter how the brand is placed in the movie, by\nusing brand placement, marketers hope to gain an\nadvantage in comparison with the traditional commer-\ncial advertising format. The availability of a captive\naudience with greater reach than traditional advertise-\nments and the advantage of showing brands in their\nnatural environment (Stephan & Coote, 2005) provide\nmotivation for product placements (Deigh, 1985;\nplacement provides an opportunity where the involved\naudience gets exposure to the brands and products\nduring the natural process of narration of the movie.\nThe audience can undertake multiple tasks while\nwatching a television programme in a home setting,\nwhich may affect the level and degree of the attention\nspan of the audience and hence reduce the overall effec-\ntiveness of the medium for enhancing brand memory.\nIn the case of watching a movie in the theatre, the\naudience makes a voluntary choice for viewing (expo-\nsure) at a cost (financial, time, and opportunity cost)\nfor the purpose of entertainment, which makes him\nmore receptive to the information provided. Further,\nthe trend of zapping and change in television usage\nbehaviour due to surfing during commercial breaks has\nreduced the effectiveness of television commercials.\nAnd clearly, brand placements in movies also result\nin a longer lifespan for the brands than typical adver-\ntisements (Brennan, Dubas, & Babin, 1999; d'Astous &\nWhile brand placement has obvious advantages, it is\nnot without its disadvantages. Such disadvantages\nstem from the marketer's general lack of control over\nthe brand placement process. Exposure does not actu-\nally guarantee that the placement will be noticed (Van\nder Waldt, 2005). Also, there is little control over how\nand when the brand will be shown or whether it will be\nshown at all, as the risk of the scene featuring the brand\nbeing edited runs high (Bergman, 1989) and the risk of\na negative portrayal of the brand in the movie setting\n(Fleming, 1990). However, despite the pitfalls which\nmay not allow brand placements to stand as the lone\nmarketing tool, it is becoming an increasingly impor-\ntant part of the integrated marketing strategy.\nOver a period of time, researchers have used a number\nof terms for the same purpose that somewhat overlap\neach other. The term advertainment (Russell, 2007) was\ncoined to reflect the increasingly intertwined connec-\ntions between advertising and entertainment and\nrefers to the promotional practices that integrate brand\ncommunications within the content of entertainment\nproducts. The increased mingling of advertising with\nthe entertainment world has generated a slew of newly\ncoined terms to reflect the trends, such as hybrid adver-\ntisement (Balasubramanian, 1994), branded entertain-\nment (Hudson & Hudson, 2006), and brand placement\nand product placement. In one of the first reviews of\nbrand placement, Karrh (1998) argues that although\nproduct placement is the most commonly used descrip-\ntion, brand placement would be more correct. He argues\nthat it is a brand (e.g., Ray-Ban) and not a product\n(e.g., sunglasses) that is placed. However, not many\nresearchers distinguish between the two and, therefore,\nthe terms brand placement and product placement have\nbeen used interchangeably throughout the study.\nDespite the widespread use of brand placements to\nreach audiences, it is difficult to ascertain its effective-\nness because much of the related data is proprietary\n(Yang, Roskos-Ewoldsen, & Roskos-Ewoldsen, 2004).\nConsequently, too little is known about the effect of\nbrand placements given the dynamic nature of this prac-\ntice (Bhatnagar, Aksoy, & Malkoc, 2004). For example,\nhow the brands are placed in the movies may influence\ntheir effectiveness (Ong & Meri, 1994). Indeed, scholars\nhave tested the effect of different types of brand place-\nments, such as whether the placement is visual or verbal\n(Russell, 2002), the visual prominence of the placement\n(Law & Braun, 2000), and if the placement is involved in\nthe plot of the story or not (Russell, 2002).\nWhile all these past studies on brand placement have\nbeen informative, research in the area of product place-\nment is still not widespread in the Indian context and is\nconcentrated on studying the impact of product place-\nments on a wide, general audience. India, which has a\nhuge and growing section of young consumers who are\npoised to begin their consumption journey, offers a big\nfuture growth market for branded products making it\neven more important to discover, clarify, and check the\neffectiveness of brand placements.\nFilms are a noticeable medium of entertainment in India\n(Panda, 2004), communicating among other things,\nthe changing fashion trends and promoting market-\ner's products and services. Indian audience has always\nbeen emotionally involved with onscreen actors and\nthe impact is evident from the fact that stars have iconic\nstatus in India. The audience depends heavily on these\nactors for setting new trends, fashions, and hairstyles\n(Kripalani, 2006), and it was, therefore, not astonishing\nwhen advertisers and marketers started exploiting\nmainstream Indian cinema as an opportunity to adver-\ntise their products and started relying on stars to set\ntrends for costumes, accessories, and other products and\nservices. When the audience watch a movie star with the\nproduct placed in the movie, they connect the product\nwith the actor, thus, increasing the intrinsic expressive-\nness of the placement messages (Morton & Friedman,\n2002) such that when the consumers see the movie star\nusing a certain product, they try to associate the credi-\nbility of the actor with the product placed in the movie\nand build a positive behaviour towards the product.\nIndia's popular Hindi film industry, commonly known\nas Bollywood, being the largest producer of films in the\nworld (Minocha & Stonehouse, 2006), is fuelled by a\nlarge audience eager for consumption (Akram, Dwight,\ndisplay of national brands, Hollywood's `big players'\nof product placement also appear in Indian movies.\nCoca-Cola, for instance, has benefited from placement\nin movies in India along with celebrity endorsement\nby Indian movie star, Amir Khan, helping it increase\nits market share (Business Week, 2003). Display of both\nforeign and local brands in the contemporary Indian\nfilms is, therefore, a reflection of the globalization\nforces at play within India, with a number of Indian\nfilms being packed with loads of non-Indian product\nplacements. Since Indian or Hollywood movies mostly\nremain unchanged across countries, international\nbrands, even if placed in local media through cable-\ncast or broadcast, may serve as a global marketing\nstrategy (Gould, Gupta, & Grabner-Krauter, 2000). It is\nfor this reason that since the last few years, multina-\ntional brands have looked to Indian movies to reach the\nIn addition to placing foreign brands in Indian films,\nproducers of movies have also started exploring different\ntypes of product placements, on the lines similar to its\nHollywood counterpart. Apart from just a brand place-\nment in a movie or a prominent character talking about\nit, they have started placing products integral to the sto-\nryline. The 2002 film, Road, shot mostly on roads with the\nlead characters driving the cars, featured Tata Motors'\nSafari 4-wheel SUV. For this placement, Tata Motors\n2006). Such a trend of weaving a product into the sto-\nryline has become common in the Hindi3 film industry\nin the past few years. In fact, a recent film Heroine\n(2012) included several brands that were integral to the\nmovie's theme. After the release of the movie, Lakme\nlaunched Heroine branded makeup under the Absolute\nrange, endorsed by Kareena Kapoor (an Indian actress)\nwhile apparel brand Jealous 21 introduced a special\nclothing line inspired by the clothes worn by Kareena in\nthe movie, which narrates the behind-the-scenes life of an\nactor. Given the efforts made by the advertisers and the\nenthusiasm with which the audiences are accepting brand\nplacements in the Indian movies, this practice has a huge\npotential to grow.\nHypotheses\nBrand placements are, by definition, brands placed\nwithin a medium (Nelson & Deshpande, 2013). How\naudience members respond to the medium likely\nimpacts their responses to the brands within that\nmedium, too. The body of research studying the influ-\nence of context on advertising effectiveness leads to the\nfinding that advertising context consists of two impor-\ntant concepts: receiver context and medium context.\nWhile the receiver context is described as the situa-\ntional circumstances in which a person is exposed to\nan advertisement (Pieters & Van Raaij, 1992), such as\nthe person's physical environment (e.g., `at home, at\nthe dining table'), the social environment (e.g., `in the\ncompany of friends'), the time frame (e.g., `during\nlunch'), and the mental state a person is in prior to expo-\nsure to the medium content (e.g., `an early morning\nmood'), the medium context concerns the environment\nof the ad provided by the vehicle carrying it, such as a\ntelevision programme, a book, a video game, or a film.\nAlthough studies on context effect are not found in\nthe brand placement literature, there is some sugges-\ntion that the medium context can have an effect on\nconsumers' responses to an embedded ad (Moorman,\nNeijens, & Smit, 2005). Some authors have even found\na congruency effect between context and embedded\nad (priming effect, e.g., Yi, 1990). Therefore, we expect\nthat the medium context should have an effect on the\nresponses to brand placements too. Further, while the\nmedium context may be the same (e.g., films), they may\nstill differ on the basis of culture, such as films made in\nIndia and abroad, both of which depict widely different\npresent study, we conceptualize and explain the clas-\nsification of film industries into foreign film industry\n(Hollywood) and domestic film industry (Bollywood),\nbased on their country of origin and term them as the\nfilm industry context. Films represent a very typical\nentertainment medium and each film industry across\nthe globe is influenced by its culture and environment\nas a whole; therefore, understanding of the film\nindustry context will help understand the differences\nbetween domestic and foreign consumer behaviour. In\nthe present study, the film industry context has been\nused as one of the independent variables that have two\nlevels, Indian and American. Films that were made in\nIndia have been defined as Indian movies while those\nthat were made in America have been classified as\nAmerican movies.\nUntil recently, placement of branded products in\nmovies was considered an American concept (Segrave,\n2004). However, the Indian mainstream Hindi films\nhave caught up with the trend with the Indian audi-\nence not only being exposed to product placement in\ndifferent media but also being exposed to it in both the\nnational and international entertainment industry. Just\nas the Indian motion pictures have a huge overseas\nmarket, Hollywood movies is a huge craze with the\nIndian masses. With the coming of video-on-demand\nand DTH, access to any kind of movies has become\neasier than before; therefore, like many other countries,\nHollywood movies have a significant viewership in\nIndia too. Also, interest in Hollywood movies is high,\nwith several Hollywood movies releasing in Indian\ntheatres every month. Given the massive exposure of\nthe Indian audiences to movies, it is a question of legit-\nimate curiosity to find out the impact that brand place-\nments in movies have on the audiences.\nHall's (1959) theory aims to explain culture on the basis\nof high and low context which varies across cultures\n(Hall, 1984). Indian culture, being a high context culture,\naims to communicate messages through symbols\n(deMooij, 1998), including brands which may com-\nmunicate the social standing. Hall (1976) also empha-\nsizes that in a high-context culture, greater confidence\nis placed in the nonverbal aspects of communication\nthan the verbal aspects. On the other hand, Hollywood\nfilms are rooted in a low-context culture. The literature\non product placement demonstrates that cultural dif-\nferences exist vis-\u00e0-vis attitudes towards product place-\nThis is primarily because cultural values and communi-\ncation styles influence advertising persuasion (Aaker &\nMaheswaran, 1997) and are also likely to influence the\nway consumers process product placements. In other\nwords, how brand placements communicate is dictated\nby the cultural context in which they are put. We argue\nthat consumers' interpretation of brands placed in dif-\nferent contexts, namely, domestic versus foreign films\nwill show a potential bias. For example, Coca-Cola has\nbeen widely used in several international as well as\nIndian movies. In each of the two scenarios, the same\nbrand might be looked at differently due to its place-\nment in two culturally different contexts. An Indian\nconsumer will be able to relate with Coca-Cola more\nin Rang De Basanti (2006), an Indian film, rather than\nCoca-Cola in Falling Down (1993). This implies that\ndifferences exist in terms of consumers' response to\nbrands placed in the two different contexts.\nIn addition to the difference in consumers' response\nto brand placements in national and international\nfilms due to cultural diversity, we also argue, based\non research, that an increase in the number of ads in\nthe environment will have a negative influence on the\neffectiveness of the target ad or the placed brand (Kent,\n1995). Given that Hollywood films contain a greater\nnumber of brands overall (Kureshi & Sood, 2011) as\ncompared to Indian films, it is likely that the reaction\nof viewers towards brands placement in Hollywood\nmovies would be more negative as compared to their\nreaction towards brand placement in Indian films. In\nview of the literature on the medium context, cultural\ndifferences and the effect of number of brands placed in\na movie, we predict that\nH1: Brands placed in a national event will create\nmore positive brand evaluations than brands placed\nin an international event.\nAssociations between a brand and an event that trigger\npositive attitudes towards the brand may be an effec-\ntive marketing strategy, leading to increased sales\nwhich could potentially generate a sustainable compet-\nitive advantage. However, not all brand\u00adevent rela-\ntionships result in a positive outcome for the brand.\nIt has been suggested that when there is congru-\nence between the brand and the event, consumers are\nmore likely to respond favourably (Hamlin & Wilson,\ncongruity reflect the extent to which the sponsored\npartner is seen as predictable. Therefore, it is highly\nlikely that congruence will allow the brand to generate\npositive returns, whereas a non-congruent relation-\nship may even be detrimental to the brand (Gray, 2000;\nthat congruity between brand and event can have a\npositive influence on consumer responses so that there\nis a positive attitude towards the event and the brand\nThe concept of fit, built on congruity theory (Osgood\n& Tannenbaum, 1955), has been extensively applied to\nthe sponsorship arena and holds that sponsors should\nseek events that have a logical congruence or fit with\nthe sponsors' products. There is, however, no evidence\nof congruence/fit studies in the context of product\nplacements. Nevertheless, given the similarity between\nproduct placement and sponsorship, such that both\nconsist of a triangular relationship--a company willing\nto support a certain activity (the sponsor), a sponsored\nactivity or the target (the sponsee), and in a majority\nof cases also the different media covering the event or\nactivity (Burnett, 1993)--it is only reasonable to consider\nthat brands being placed in movies are, in a way, spon-\nsoring a part of the movie. For example, brands such as\nLakme, Head & Shoulders, Jealous 21, Cera, and so on\ncollectively spent roughly ` 250 million on in-film place-\nment in the movie Heroine. Therefore, application of fit\nin the context of product placement may be built on the\nsame logic as that in the context of sponsorship.\nSponsorship literature confirms the importance of\ncongruence on the relationship between brand and\nevent, exemplified by brand image beliefs (Gwinner &\npractitioners have long relied on fit to explain sponsor-\nship (Olson & Thjomoe, 2011; Quester & Thompson,\nhigh-fit sponsorships (sponsor partner is perceived as\ncongruent with sponsored event) can increase brand\nvalue, whereas low-fit (sponsor partner is perceived\nas incongruent with sponsored event) can dilute\nbrand value. Several studies have shown the impor-\ntance of a strong link between the sponsor and the\nsponsored event or entity: the greater the perceived fit\nof brand associations between the sponsor/endorser\nand the brand, the greater the impact on the sponsor's\nimage and the attitudes towards sponsoring itself\nfound to successfully transfer between parent brands\nand brand extensions when perceived fit between\nthe two is high (Aaker & Keller, 1990), based on the\nsame argument, it is expected that the degree of fit or\ncongruence between brands and the context in which\nthey appear will determine the extent to which atti-\ntudes towards the context transfers onto the placed\nbrand. Additionally, when consumers elaborate on\nthe sponsorship and discover a level of congruence,\nthey experience a sense of cognitive satisfaction that\ninfluences their evaluation of the sponsoring brand\nLikewise, strong sponsor\u00adprogramme congruity sug-\ngests that the sponsor's products and activities are\nclearly related to the contents of the programme, that is,\nthe product placement is likely to be natural and con-\nsistent with the programme. However, when sponsor\u00ad\nprogramme congruity is weak, the product placement\nmay be seen as inconsistent and not credible. Therefore,\nextending this basic finding to brand placement in\nmovies, we expect that brands that are perceived as\nconsistent with the event in which they are placed will\nlead to positive evaluation of the brand. We therefore\nhypothesize that\nH2: When the presence of the brand is consistent\nwith viewer expectations of the event (high fit),\nit would create significantly more favourable\nconsumer evaluations than brands that are incon-\nsistent (low fit) with the event.\nForeign films, being viewed by the Indian audiences in\naddition to the contemporary Indian films, are sugges-\ntive of the global forces within India. Films, being a\nproduct of culture, reflect the cultural values of the\npeople such that the practices, behaviour, and brands\nfrom other cultures flow into the domestic culture\n(Appadurai, 1996). Just as brands are categorized\nas foreign or domestic in terms of country of origin,\nfilms, as a medium of entertainment, are also labelled\nas foreign and local (Schaefer & Kavita, 2011). When\npeople are exposed to films, they gather information\nfrom them in terms of brand schemas and compare\nthem, which determine their judgement with respect\nto the appropriateness of the event (McDaniel, 1999).\nTherefore, we can assume the same forces to play a\nrole in consumers' evaluation of films that affect their\njudgement about brands. A match leads to more posi-\ntive evaluations because affect moves from the event\nschema to the brand schema (Perrachio & Tybout, 1996).\nHowever, the influence of films/media on consumers\nis not automatic. Consumers in emerging markets, such\nas India, may readily accept nonlocal brands due to\ncountry-of-origin (COO) effects where foreign brands\nconvey quality or status. Conversely, they may reject\nforeign brands or their depictions based on consumer\nethnocentrism, that is, preference for one's own coun-\ntry's products (e.g., Zhou & Russell, 2004).\nWe hope to examine consumers' responses in terms of\ntheir attitude towards the placed brand and their inten-\ntion to purchase the brand within the context of COO\nof the event (and not the brand). Given the individual\ndifferenceswithrespecttoforeignanddomesticbrands/\nfilms based on consumer ethnocentrism or openness to\nother cultures (Batra et al., 2000), we assume the rela-\ntionships of these factors to have an influence on atti-\ntudes towards the brand. Past research also suggests\nthat a congruity between the brand and the context in\nwhich it is placed has an effect on consumers' evalu-\nation. Specifically, a brand\u00adevent fit will draw more\nfavourable responses. Therefore, brand placement and\ncongruity literature suggests that based on cultural\naffect the way consumers process product placements\n(Aaker & Maheswaran, 1997), a low fit between the\nevent and the brand is expected to create more positive\nevaluation in case of the event being a national event\nrather than an international event. Therefore,\nH3: The low fit between the brand and the event\nwill create more favourable evaluation in a national\nevent context than a low brand\u00adevent fit in the\ncontext of an international event.\nPrior research suggests that the manner in which the\nbrands are presented in the movies, namely in the\nbackground, used by the main character or as an inte-\ngral part of the unfolding story, might lead to different\nresponses from the audience (Russell, 2002). Therefore,\nthe current study focused on only one type of brand\nplacement, that is, the effect of visual brand place-\nments, used by the main character in the movie. Visual\nproduct placement means that the product is shown\nprominently in the movie without the mention of the\nbrand name. For the present study, four different movies\nwere selected, each using product placement such that\nthe placement was visual in nature. Second, the study\nexplored the influence of brand placement using both\nAmerican and Indian movies so as to study the effect of\nthe link between COO of the entertainment event and\nbrand placement in the movie. For the present study,\nfour different movies were selected--two American\nand two Indian--each using brand placement which\nwas visual in nature. Experimental design was chosen\nas the method of study in the present research work\nbecause of the ability of such designs to test theoretical\nTwo pilot studies were conducted prior to the main\nexperimental study. The participants for all of the studies\nwere recruited from the same research participant pool\nat a large university in North India for no extra credit\nfor their participation.\nPilot Study 1: Selection of the   for the\nExperiment\nTen subjects were asked to list five American and five\nIndian (Hindi) movies that used brand placement.\nSubjectswereinformedthatused-by-main-characterbrand\nplacement should be part of the movies and should be\nvisual brand placement. Used-by-main-character brand\nplacement involved one of the main characters using\nthe brand in some manner such as opening the packet of\nTata Tea in the movie, Baghban (2003), by one of the lead\ncharacters in that movie while visual brand placement\nwas the one in which no mention of the brand name\nwas made. The subjects were given enough time to\nthink and were allowed to discuss among themselves.\nPilot Study 2: Fit/Misfit Test\nThe second pre-test was conducted to select the brand\u00ad\nevent combination. Out of the list of 50 American and\n50 Hindi movies generated by the subjects from the\nfirst pre-test, the subjects were asked to separate those\nmovies where the presence of the brand in the movie\nwas a misfit in the movie scene and those where the\nbrand placement and movie scene fitted well. For\ndoing this, the participants were asked to indicate how\nmuch they considered the brand\u00adevent (movie) fit\nusing a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (complete misfit)\nto 7 (complete fit) for each of the movies listed. Using\nthis data, two American and two Hindi movies were\nselected (Table 1) with the most fit and least fit.\nTable 1: Brand Fit and Misfit with the Event\nEntertainment Industry Event\u00adBrand Fit Event\u00adBrand Misfit\nAmerican Top Gun Twilight\nHindi Jab Tak Hai Jaan Student of the Year\nSource: Author's analysis.\nThe two movies selected with the most brand\u00adevent\nfit were Top Gun (Ray-Ban) (1986) and Jab Tak Hai Jaan\n(Canon) (2012) while the movies selected for the least\nbrand\u00adevent fit were Twilight (2008) and Student of the\nPilot Study 3: Brand Stature, Brand Perception,\nand Brand Familiarity\nThe third pilot study was conducted to establish if the\nthree selected brands, namely Ray-Ban, Canon, and\nApple, had the same stature, were similarly perceived,\nand had the same level of familiarity. The pre-test was\nconducted on 30 participants and analysis of vari-\nance (ANOVA) results reflect no significant difference\nbetween the three brands, based on stature/importance\nMain Study\nDesign\nThe study used a 2X2 between-subjects experimental\ndesign with two levels of events (American/Hindi\nmovies) and two levels of brand\u00adevent fit (high fit/low\nfit). Each subject was assigned to only one of the four\nconditions in the experiment.\nParticipants\nFor the purpose of this research, a non-probability\nsamplingapproachwasused.Non-probabilitysampling\nis arbitrary and subjective, due to the fact that a partic-\nipant does not have a known non-zero chance of being\nThe sample chosen for the study was roughly comparable\nin terms of occupation (all were post-graduate students),\ngender, and age. A total of 120 students participated in\nthe study (78 females and 42 males) and was drawn from\nthe subject pool of a large Indian university for no extra\ncourse credit for their participation. The motivation for\nthis selection was that respondents were thought to be\nan appropriate sample since young adults (18 to 24 years\nof age) are passionate film-goers. Moreover, attending\nmovies is a common activity for the age range of the\nsample (Nebenzahl & Secunda, 1993). Also, many social\npsychological research studies have used college students\nas participants but they are usually labelled as `adults'\n(Arnett, 2000) who possess enough disposable income to\nattend films (Gough, 2003), making product placement in\nfilms an effective way to target young and well-educated\nconsumers. The 120 respondents were divided into four\ngroups such that each group consisted of 30 respondents.\nEach group was shown one of the four stimuli in the form\nof a movie clip and their responses were recorded with a\nstandardized scale.\nStimulus\nBefore the final experiment, five respondents (who\nwere not part of the final study) viewed the four movies\nwhich were selected from the pre-tests, on a videotape\nto identify and list the names of all the brands placed in\nthe movie scenes (Table 2).\nTable 2: List of  , Name of Entertainment Industry, and\nBrand Placed\nName of the Movie Entertainment Industry Brand Placed\nTop Gun American Ray Ban\nTwilight American Apple\nJab Tak Hai Jaan Hindi Canon\nStudent of the Year Hindi Ray Ban\nSource: Author's analysis.\nSince all the movies had numerous brand placements,\nwe asked the subjects to identify the scenes where only\none brand was placed in a scene. It was also mentioned\nthat the brand should only be a visual prop being\nused by one of the leading characters of the film but\nshould not be mentioned in the scene. Scenes from the\nfilms, where the branded products were featured, were\nselected. Last, the respondents were also asked if the\nfour movies were comparable in terms of their release\ntime such that none of the films was either too old or\ntoo new. It was done to avoid the potential confound of\npromotional tie-ins and sponsorships that could have\ndrawn the audience's attention to the brand (Ong &\nAlso, in order to control for star association with the\nbrand, those brand placements were not selected for\nthe final study in which the star of the movie was also\nendorsing the brand in traditional advertisements, such\nas Kareena Kapoor was seen holding a Sony Vaio in a\nscene in Bodyguard (2011) while she is also an endorser\nof the same brand and can be seen in television adver-\ntisement as well. It was done to avoid clouding the\nrespondents' judgement based on their assessment of\nthe celebrity\u00adbrand association.\nIn the brand\u00adevent fit for the international event,\nRay-Ban sunglasses worn by the protagonist appears\nprominently in the centre of the screen in one scene\nfrom the movie Top Gun (1986). Tom Cruise's char-\nacter in the movie, a US Naval Lieutenant Maverick,\nembodied the image of a cool jet-fighter pilot, and due\nto the natural cosmetic effects and military look of the\nsunglasses donned by him in the movie, the brand was\nconsidered to be an overall fit in the movie. The event\u00ad\nbrand misfit condition selected from the American\nmovie was a scene from the movie Twilight (2008) in\nwhich the female lead of the film was seen working on\nan Apple computer. The brand was seen to be a misfit\nwith the story of the film which was based on a young\nadult vampire's romance with a human.\nThe movie selected from the Indian panorama in the\nbrand\u00adevent fit category was Jab Tak Hai Jaan (2012)\nin which one of the lead characters of the movie was\na Discovery Channel filmmaker and was seen taking\nshots from her Canon camera. The brand seems to fit\nperfectly in the movie as the use of the camera is justi-\nfied by the character in the film. On the other hand,\nthe movie Student of the Year (2012) was selected in the\nbrand\u00adevent misfit category. The sunglasses brand\nRay-Ban was being used by one of the male leads whose\ncharacter was a boy from a middle-class background\non scholarship, but was seen wearing expensive clothes\nand branded sunglasses. The audience took notice of\nthis apparent disconnect between the character and the\nbrand and categorized it as a misfit.\nManipulation Check\nIn order to determine the success of the experimental\ndesign, it was necessary to check whether the manip-\nulation remained hidden or visibly obvious to the\nrespondents. The present study manipulated fit\nbetween the event and the brand, and this manipula-\ntion was checked by measuring the subjects' response\nto five items by Speed and Thompson (2000) that\nwere used to measure brand\u00adevent fit in this study\n(Table 3). This manipulation check was carried out by\nshowing the respondents both the high brand\u00adevent\nfit and low brand\u00adevent fit formats. The manipula-\ntion check, brand\u00adevent fit, was assessed by indexing\ntwo measures, that is, high and low brand fit. Scores\nof subjects in the high fit setting (6.3) on a 7-point scale\nwere compared with the scores of subjects in the low-fit\nsetting (3.2). The data supports the intended manipula-\nmanipulation was effective in creating required experi-\nmental conditions.\nResearch Design\nThis study was presented as a movie entertainment\nstudy and each session was conducted with 30 partic-\nipants. The methodology adopted for this study is\ncomparable to the one used by Gupta and Lord (1998).\nSubjects participated in small groups. Stimulus tapes\nfor the four treatment conditions were randomly\nassigned to sessions. Upon arrival at the assigned\nexperimental session, subjects were informed that\nthey would be shown a videotape of a movie excerpt\nand then asked some questions about the movie. The\nparticipants were informed about the purpose of the\nexperiment and were allowed to watch the movie clip.\nThe clips of the movies listed above were edited to 30\nminutes. The scenes with the target brand placement\nwere placed roughly in the middle of each 30-minute\nclip and were shown to the subjects.\nAfter watching the movie, subjects completed a ques-\ntionnaire measuring demographic information, pre-\nvious exposure to the movie, and enjoyment of the\nmovie they watched. Prior to the testing, respondents\nwere not made aware that the questionnaire was con-\ncerned with product placements in the films. To check\non the cover story, respondents were asked to write\ndown what they thought was the purpose of the study\nimmediately after viewing the movie, with none of the\nrespondents indicating the true purpose.\nRespondents completed the questionnaire on brand\nevaluation by asking them their attitude towards\nthe brand and their intention to purchase. Attitude\ntowards the brand and intention to purchase were\nmeasured using a 7-point scale. The entire task took\napproximately 20 minutes. Another personality scale\nwas given as a distraction task. After this distraction\ntask, the participants were thanked for their participa-\ntion and dismissed from the study.\nVariable Operationalization\nSeveral measures were modified from existing vali-\ndated scales and in some cases measures were devel-\noped for use in this study based upon the related liter-\nature. All measures were subjected to confirmatory\nfactor analysis to assess their psychometric properties\nand unidimensionality. The final scale items used in the\nanalysis, standardized factor loadings, and reliability\nestimates are listed in Table 3.\n /Misfit\nIn the present study, the event was operationalized as\nthe appearance of a product in the released film and\nthe context (national event/international event) of its\nappearance. The fit was conceptualized on a variety\nof dimensions in the marketing literature. Consistent\nwith Speed and Thompson (2000), however, we did not\nattempt to tease out the different dimensions of fit in\nour measure. Rather, we adopted a five-item measure\nthat allowed respondents to consider fit on their own\nterms without restricting the basis used to define fit. The\nfive items to measure fit, used by Speed and Thompson\n(2000), were modified to fit the context of this study\n(Table 3). All items on the perception of event\u00adbrand fit\nwere ranked on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = totally disa-\ngree, 7 = totally agree).\nUnderstanding brand placements requires that\nresearchers measure event attendees' (i.e., viewers')\nperceptions. The two dependent variables measured\nin the study are the attitude towards the brand placed\nin the movie and viewers' intention to purchase the\nplaced brand. The measurement of these constructs has\nbeen summarized below.\nAttitude towards the Placed Brand\nThis construct was measured with a three-item scale\nusing the traditional attitudinal aspects of liking and\nfavourable disposition on a 7-point agree\u00addisagree\nTable 3: Confirmatory Factor Analysis Results\nScale Items Factor Loadings\nEvent\u00adBrand Fit (Cronbach's  = 0.89)\nThere is a close fit between the placed brand and\nthe movie\nThe placed brand and the movie have many\nsimilarities\nIt makes sense that this brand appears in the movie 0.732\nThere is a logical connection between the placed\nbrand and the movie\nMy image of the placed brand is consistent with my\nimage of the movie\nAttitude towards the Placed Brand (Cronbach's  = 0.97)\nI like the brand placed in the movie 0.874\nThe brand placed in the movie is a very good brand 0.851\nI have a favourable disposition towards the brand 0.817\nPurchase Intentions (Cronbach's  = 0.91)\nI would buy the brand placed in the movie 0.890\nThe next time I want to buy a product of this type, I\nwould consider buying this brand\nSource: Author's analysis.\nPurchase Intention\nThe behaviour intention measure used in this study\nconsisted of two items. It allows for a more robust\ntest of the paths from attitude to purchase intentions.\nResponses were operationalized using a 7-point scale\nranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree.\nBefore the final administration of the questionnaire,\npre-testing of the questionnaire was carried out for\nqualitative investigation. Ten respondents were admin-\nistered the questionnaire for this purpose. Subsequently,\nthe language of one of the questions was simplified.\nBefore the final data collection, respondents were\nbriefed about the purpose of the study and all queries\nof the respondents were clarified.\nRESULTS\nA one-way multivariate analysis of variance (one-way\nMANOVA) was used to determine whether there were\nany significant differences between the independent\ngroups (brands placed in Indian and American movies)\nonthedependentvariables--attitudetowardsthebrand\nand intention to purchase. The two dependent varia-\nbles were found to be highly correlated with each other\npositive correlation, MANOVA was applied to examine\nwhether there were differences in the respondents'\nattitude towards the placed brand and their intention\nto purchase on two different levels of entertainment\nevent (Indian movies versus international movies).\nThe multivariate effect (Table 4) was found to be signif-\nicant, F\n0.05; indicating a statistically significant difference in\nbrand evaluation based on entertainment event levels\n(brands placed in Indian and American movies).\nGiven the significance of the overall test, the univar-\niate main tests were examined. As indicated in Table 5,\nthere are significant differences across the levels\nof entertainment event, indicating that significant\nunivariate main effects exist for attitude towards the\nplaced brand (A\nb\n), F\ntion to purchase, F\nysis indicates that mean scores for `Overall evaluation\nof brands appearing in Indian movie' (M = 5.06) and\n`Overall evaluation of brands appearing in American\nmovie' (M = 4.37) are statistically different for two\nentertainment event is significantly predictive of an\nincrease in the evaluation of brands placed in movies\nsuch that when a brand appears in an Indian movie,\nthe brand evaluation, measured in terms of A\nb\nand\npurchase intention, is more as compared to when a\nbrand appears in an American flick. These results indi-\ncate an overall support for H1.\nTable 4: MANOVA Test Results\nEffect Value F Hypothesis df Error df Sig.

The multivariate effect (Table 4)\nis significant (F\nsuggests that the consumers' evaluation of the brand\nplaced in the movie varies significantly depending on\nthe level of fit (high or low) between the brand and the\nevent, irrespective of the type of event, Indian movies\nor international movies. There are significant differ-\nences across the levels of brand\u00adevent fit on brand\nevaluation indicating that significant univariate main\neffects exist for attitude towards the placed brand,\nF\n=\ncase the respondents evaluated the placed brand more\nfavourably, mean scores for brand\u00adevent fit (M = 5.01)\nand brand\u00adevent misfit (M = 4.427) were measured and\nwere found to be statistically different for the two inde-\nwhen a brand that fits well with the movie appears,\nthe brand evaluations, measured in terms of A\nb\nand\npurchase intention, is more favourable as compared to\nwhen a brand does not fit well with the movie. These\nresults support H2.\nFurther, a 2X2 (high/low brand\u00adevent fit X international\nmovies/Indian movies) between-subjects MANOVA\nwas used to determine if there was a significant effect of\nbrand\u00adevent fit and type of event on brand evaluation.\nAs shown in Table 6, the MANOVAresults reveal signif-\nicant main effects of brand\u00adevent fit (F\n< 0.05) and entertainment event type (F\n< 0.05), which indicate that the differences in brand\u00ad\nevent fit are not equal across the event types for both\nthe dependent variables (A\nb\nand intention to purchase).\nThe multivariate effects show that there is a significant\ninteraction effect of the brand\u00adevent fit X event type\ninteraction term on both the dependent variables (F\nthe intervening effects of the two independent varia-\nbles may obscure comparisons between the means of\none independent variable. In this research, the combi-\nnation of the two independent variables played a more\nimportant role in explaining the variability of attitude\ntowards the brand and intention to purchase.\nAdditionally, specific mean comparisons (Table 7)\nsuggest that the effect of brand\u00adevent fit on brand\nevaluation will be larger when the brand appears\nin a national event. A significant difference is found\nb\nbetween American (cell mean\nbrand\u00adevent fit condition. It suggests that in a low\nbrand\u00adevent fit condition, brand evaluations will be\nmore positive in case of an Indian movie than when a\nlow fit condition occurs in an American movie. Also,\npurchase intention in the low brand\u00adevent fit condition\nfor both Hollywood (cell mean = 3.72) and Hindi (cell\nmean = 4.92) movies. However, there is no significant\nb\nbetween Hollywood\nwhen the brand\u00adevent fit was high. Also, there is no\nintention in the high brand\u00adevent fit condition for both\nHollywood (cell mean = 3.89) and Hindi (cell mean =\n4.21) movies. Therefore, support is found for H3.\nTable 7: Mean Comparisons\nAmerican Movie\nLow fit\nIndian Movie\nLow fit\nt-values\n(Sig.)\nAmerican Movie\nHigh fit\nIndian Movie\nHigh fit\nt-values\n(Sig.)\nAttitude towards Brand (A\nb\nSource: Author's analysis.\nNote: *Significant at p < 0.05 level.\nTable 6: Results of MANOVA\nSources\nMANOVA\nWilk's\nLambda Effect Size F (p value)\nMain Effects\n \n(B-EF)\nInteraction Effects\nSource: Author's analysis.\nNote: *Significant at p < 0.05 level.\nTo have a better understanding of the effects of the\ntwo independent variables, graphs were constructed\nshowing the mean responses for both of them for each\nof the dependent variables Figures 1a & 1b.\nFigure 1a: Plot for Attitude towards Brand (Ab)\nEvent Type\nHollywood Bollywood\nfit\nlow fit\nhigh fit\nEstimated Marginal Means of Ab\nFigure 1b: Plot for Intention to Purchase\nEvent Type\nHollywood Bollywood\nfit\nlow fit\nhigh fit\nEstimated Marginal Means of PI\nSource: Author's analysis.\nThe significant interaction for each dependent variable\nis visually demonstrated by the absence of parallelism\nof the lines in each of the plots. The `attitude towards\nthe placed brand' plot (Figure 1a) shows that brands\nwith low fit with the movie tend to draw lesser posi-\ntive attitude towards the placed brand than brands that\nfit well with the movie. Also, brands placed in Hindi\nmovies generated much more positive attitude towards\nthe placed brand than when brands were placed in\nAmerican movies. The interaction effect shows that\nalthough there is little difference in the A\nb\nwhen the\nbrand\u00adevent fit is high, the low fit condition leads to\nmore positive attitude towards the placed brand when\nthe brand appears in Hindi movies than when the low\nbrand fit condition appears in Hollywood movies. The\nplot of `purchase intention' (Figure 1b) shows similar\nresults suggesting that intention to purchase is high\nwhen the brand fits well in a Hindi movie while it is\nless when the brand is a low fit in a Hollywood movie.\nAs one of the first attempts to analyse brand placements\nin the context of Hollywood and Hindi movies vis-\u00e0-vis\nbrand fit, this study suggests that the idea of fit, match,\nor congruence between the brand and the event can be\nused as a key criterion when explaining brand evalu-\nations. Our research takes us one step closer to devel-\noping fitting brand placements, as the study extends the\napplicability of the idea of fit, which was till now largely\nconfined to sponsorship, and subjects it to the explora-\ntion of finding a fit between brands and specific events,\nin particular, movies. Results of the present study reveal\nthat such relationships between brand placement and\nthe outcome variables is linked with another construct,\nperceived fit between the brand and the event.\nIn this context, the purpose of the study was to examine\nthe extent to which matching the brands and the movies\nin which they were placed would succeed in generating\npositive consumer responses in terms of positive brand\nattitude and intention to purchase the placed brand. The\nstudy also hoped to find out the difference in the effect\nof brand placements, if any, based on the context of the\nentertainment industry in which they were placed.\nResults of this study reveal that brands placed in a\nnational event, which in this case is Hindi movies,\nwill create more positive brand evaluations in terms\nof positive attitude towards the placed brand and\nintention to purchase than brands that are placed in\nan international event, that is, American movies. One\ncan attribute a number of reasons for this result to\nbe true. The Indian film industry has always been a\nreflection of the customs and traditions of the Indian\nsociety (Kripalani, 2006) where the audience has been\nexpressively involved with onscreen actors, trying\nto imitate their styles. A plausible explanation for the\nIndian cultural values and communication styles being\nan influence on message persuasiveness (Aaker &\nMaheswaran, 1997) is that India is a collectivist society\n(Hofstede, 2001) where individuals operate as part of\none or more collectives, such as family or peers. Triandis\n(1995) argues that Indians are not just collectivist but\nalso score high on vertical collectivism, which means\nthat their desire to stand out from others and admira-\ntion of status and celebrity is high (Sivadas, Bruvold, &\nNelson, 2008). As a result of this verticality, individuals\nlook up to successful people in the hierarchy, such as\nmovie stars. And, since passion among the Indian audi-\nences for celebrities is no lesser than idol worshipping\n(Bhatia, 2000), the impact of such emotional attachment\nis that when an actor performs in a film, the audience\nwants to emulate their style and image. What it means\nin a product placement context is that when a celebrity is\nseen communicating explicitly through endorsements or\nimplicitly through non-verbal or indirect communication,\nsuch as brand placements in movies, the consumers view\nthe brand to be associated with the celebrity whom they\nadmire. Without further investigation of the brand, they\nmake a connection between the film, the actor, the product\nand its consumption, and look at product placement as\na perceptual clue which directs behaviour to purchase a\nproduct to satisfy a need or reinforce a social status.\nOn the other hand, results of the study show that brands\nplaced in Hollywood were not as successful in gener-\nating positive consumer reactions as brands placed\nin Hindi movies. Although, in the product placement\nliterature, the impact of context effects has not yet been\nthoroughly explored, it may be argued that the level of\ninvolvement of the Indian audience with a foreign film,\nwhich may not be very high given the cultural differ-\nences, may have affected the processing of brands tied\nto the plot. Brands placed in Hollywood movies may be\nat a disadvantage in terms of their being embedded in\na context which is culturally very different from that of\nan emerging economy like India. Much like the Indian\nfilm industry, Hollywood movies too are a reflection of\ntheir society. However, unlike India, the US has an indi-\nvidualistic culture characterized by individual bene-\nfits and preferences, personal success, and independ-\nence. Evidently, brands placed in such a context are less\nsuccessful in generating the desired response from an\naudience which is culturally more collectivist in nature.\nFurthermore, findings of the present research have con-\ntributed to an increased understanding of consumers'\nreactions to congruity in brand placement literature. In\nconjunction with the results of past researches in the\nfield of brand placement (Nelson & Deshpande, 2013),\nthis study reveals that when the presence of a brand\nis consistent with the context in which it is placed, it\nwould evoke more positive attitudes and behaviour\nthan an incongruent placement. Evidently, when people\nare faced with incongruity in a message, they begin to\nwonder why seemingly disparate elements are paired\ntogether in a message for no apparent reason, leading\nto frustration and negative evaluations (Mandler, 1982).\nJust as the viewers have become weary of excessive\nexposure to advertisements in the traditional medium,\nit is feared that unwarranted and obtrusive brand place-\nments that do not fit well with the plot of the movie, is\nlikely to do more harm than good to the sponsors. Also,\nbrands that are subtly placed in the movie and those\nthat are not glaringly forced in the face of the viewer are\nconsidered to enjoy a more fitting relation in the film.\nBy doing so, the sponsors are not taking the fun out of\nthe main plot of the movie by focusing too much on\nbrands placed. The brand, therefore, does not become\nthe hero of the movie but is strategically made a part of\nthe scene like a supporting actor.\nThe direct implication of such a result is that spon-\nsors need to be very selective in identifying movies\nin which to place their brands. With both, American\nand Indian movie business, being multibillion dollar\nenterprises where hundreds of movies in all genres are\nproduced every year (Minocha & Stonehouse, 2006),\nit should not be too difficult for sponsors to choose\nthe right film for brand placement. A brand like Aston\nMartin, used by the protagonist in the James Bond\nmovies, helped the business because the character in\nthe film clearly identified with the brand. The result\nsuggests that the connection between the brand and\nthe film is of significance and needs to be considered\nfor improving brand evaluations.\nEvaluation of results further reveals that although\na brand that fits well with the context in which it is\nplaced generates a positive evaluation of the placed\nbrand; the condition of a brand\u00adevent misfit in a\nHollywood context will create more negative evalua-\ntions among the Indian audiences than if such a discon-\nnect appeared in a Hindi film. A study by Kureshi\nand Sood (2011) reveals that American films contain a\ngreater number of brands overall. The likelihood that\nall the brands featured in the film will have the same\nlevel of fit with the character and plot of the movie is\nnot very high. As a result of excessive brands being\nplaced in the movie, two possible outcomes are likely:\nfirst, viewers will look at the placement as conspicuous;\nand second, the misplacement of the brands, if any, in\nthe film will become prominent. With too many brands\nsharing the screen space in a single exposure or spread\nout throughout the film, it is likely to draw consumers'\nattention much more and perhaps more negatively as\ntoo much exposure of brands will lead the viewer to\nthink of the movie as yet another long commercial.\nIn the Bollywood context, however, where the brand\nplacement in movies is still growing as a new medium\nof advertising, exposure to brands is relatively less,\nleading to lesser chances of a misfit.\nAdditionally, the reason for a misfit leading to less\nadverse brand evaluations in Indian movies as\ncompared to Hollywood is that while an Indian film\nis a three-hour long affair, the Hollywood flicks are of\na much shorter duration. As a result, the brands that\nare placed in the Hindi movies are spread over the\nentire length of the movie and even if there are times\nwhere the brand is a misfit with the context, it is likely\nto be overlooked because of the length of the movie.\nThe same is not true for Hollywood movies where in\na much shorter window of exposure, the movie carries\na number of brands. And if the brand is perceived to\nbe disconnected from the film, it is likely to be noticed\nmore, generating more negative evaluations. It implies\nthat not only should sponsors be careful in choosing\nwhat type of film to place their brands in, but they\nshould also put more emphasis on placing brands in\nthe national entertainment event when trying to reach\nthe Indian audience. As one of the BRIC (Brazil, Russia,\nIndia, and China) countries, India presents an impor-\ntant emerging market with an enormous and affluent\nmiddle-class (Bose, 2006). Ever since the global brands\nhave been introduced since 1991, Indians have become\nconsumers of global brands, and thus, India poses to\nbe a huge market for global brands. Based on the find-\nings of the present study, it is suggested that multina-\ntional brands must look at Indian movies as a suitable\nmedium for reaching out to the prospective buyers.\nContribution to Research\nAlthough brand placement has been vastly researched\nin different contexts, the present research has taken\na fresh approach to investigating the effects of brand\nplacements in national and international entertain-\nment contexts. And the questions, thus, undertaken\nto be answered make the research contemporary and\nuseful for marketers who are faced with the ever\nperplexing question of how and when to use brand\nplacements for greatest effectiveness. Although a few\nstudies have focused on examining the fit between\nbrands and movies, fewer have done so in the context\nof the Indian film industry and none of the previous\nstudies focused on exploring consumers' evaluation of\ncongruent and incongruent brand placements, espe-\ncially within Hollywood movies, which have a huge\nviewership among the Indian audiences. By studying\nthe main and interaction effects of fit and entertainment\nevent type on consumers' brand evaluation, this study\noffers useful insights to sponsors who are looking at the\ngrowing India market for their brands by gauging the\nway Indian audiences feel about brand placements.\nLimitations and Future Research\nThe present research has advanced our understanding\nof the fit between the event and the brand in the inter-\nnational and national contexts and its role in the frame-\nwork of brand evaluations. However, the findings of\nthe present research need to be considered in light of\nsome limitations. Any study employing student popu-\nlation is at risk of external validity shortcomings.\nAlthough the critical role of external validity in research\nprocess is significant (McGrath & Brinberg, 1983), yet\nthis being a pioneering research study, we placed a\nheavier emphasis on the internal validity, which can\nbe achieved by employing a relatively homogeneous\nstudent sample (Cook & Campbell, 1979). While we\naimed at higher levels of internal validity, we recognize\nthat a broader and more robust subject pool needs to be\nexamined before drawing generalizations.\nThe product placement stimuli were presented outside\nof the actual movie context. Viewing several placements\nin isolation is an artificial situation and it is not clear\nthat the effects observed in this research would be repli-\ncated in a real film-viewing context. The respondents\nsurveyed were not aware of the researchers' intention of\ntesting respondents' perceptions of product placements\nin films. The motive behind this was to recreate a natural\nviewing environment. Unfortunately, this may have\nresulted in many respondents regarding the viewing\nsession as purely a form of entertainment and, therefore,\nfailed to notice the placed products in the film clips.\nOne should also understand that a very narrow stimuli\nbase was used in the present study where the focus was\nonly on the visual placement of brands in the scenes.\nWhile used-by-main-character is only one of the types\nof brand placements used in movies, it is not the only\none. As such, these results should be verified for other\ntypes of brand placements. In addition, future research\nshould attempt to include additional factors in exam-\nining relationships investigated in this article. For\nexample, future researchers may want to find out the\noutcome of brand evaluations if the brand is used by\nthe villain in the movie and if there will be any effect,\npositive or negative, on the brand image.\nAlso, researchers need to find answers to the relevant\nquestion of what will be the impact on brand place-\nment if multiple brands are a part of the same entertain-\nment show, such as when a number of brands are used\nas background props in a movie. An interesting avenue\nfor future research would also be to examine what\nwill happen if the character endorsing a brand in the\nmovie is also a brand ambassador for the same brand\nand appears in traditional advertising medium? For\nexample, Shah Rukh Khan in Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani\n(2000) is seen driving a Hyundai car of which he is also\nthe brand ambassador and can be seen endorsing the\nbrand in TV ads as well.\nFinally, it is necessary to investigate the extent to which\nplacement findings do not generalize across mediums.\nFor example, consumers may be more tolerant of\nproduct placements in television because broad-\ncast television is an advertising-supported medium.\nThus, differences in television and film viewing habits\n(Russell & Stern, 2006) may also alter the factors that\ndrive the success of brand placements. Studies exam-\nining the results of this study with different samples\nand in different settings are certainly another appro-\npriate direction for future research.\nNOTES\n1 Here we are referring to so-called Bollywood movies.\n2 Hollywood.\n3 Bollywood.\nREFERENCES\nAaker, D.
