Piquero et al. (2004) reviewed research on career\nduration and found that it was typically between five and 15 years for\noffender samples.

Because official records are only the tip of the\niceberg of offending, it might be expected that, in self-reports, the age of\nonset would be earlier, the age of desistance would be later and the duration\nof criminal careers would be longer. It would also be expected that the\nprevalence and frequency of offending would be higher according to self-\nreports.\nIn the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development (CSDD, described\nlater), criminal career duration based on convictions has been measured\nseveral times. When convictions were studied up to age 40, the average\n(Farrington et al., 1998). When the follow-up was extended to age 48, the\n(Farrington et al., 2006).

There has been no previous comparative study of\ncareer duration in convictions and self-reports beyond the twenties. The\nkey questions addressed in this article are:\n1. How does the duration of criminal careers according to self-reports compare\nwith the duration of criminal careers according to convictions?\n2. To what extent is a man's career duration according to self-reports related to\nhis career duration according to convictions?\n3. How do prevalence, frequency, ages of onset and ages of desistance compare\nin self-reports and convictions?\n4. How does the order of committing different types of offences compare in self-\nreports and convictions?\n5. What is the probability of a self-reported offence leading to a conviction?\n6. What is the probability of a conviction offence being self-reported?\nMethod\nThe Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development\nThe CSDD is a prospective longitudinal survey of the development of offending\nand antisocial behaviour in about 400 London males from age 8 onwards. The\nCSDD began in 1961, and for the first 20years, it was directed by Donald West.\nDavid Farrington started working on it in 1969 and began directing the CSDD in\n1982. The most recent data collections have been jointly directed by David\nFarrington and Jeremy Coid. The CSDD has been funded primarily by the Home\nOffice and secondly by the Department of Health. Results of the study have been\nliving in a working-class area of South London. The vast majority of the sample\nwas chosen by taking all the boys who were then aged 8\u00ad9 and on the registers of\nsix state primary schools within a one mile (1.6km) radius of a research office,\nwhich had been established. In addition to 399 boys from these six schools, 12 boys\nfrom a local school for educationally subnormal children were included in the sample,\nin an attempt to make it more representative of the population of boys living in the\narea. Therefore, the boys were not a probability sample drawn from a population, but\nrather a complete population of boys of that age in that area at that time.\nMost of the boys (87%) were White in appearance and of British origin, in the\nsense that they were being brought up by parents who had themselves been\nbrought up in England, Scotland or Wales. On the basis of their fathers'\noccupations when they were aged 8, 94% of the boys could be described as work-\ning class (categories III, IV or V on the Registrar General's scale, describing\nskilled, semi-skilled or unskilled manual workers), in comparison with the na-\ntional figure of 78% at that time. The majority of the boys were living in conven-\ntional two-parent families with both a father and a mother figure; at age 8\u00ad9, only\n6% of the boys had no operative father and only 1% had no operative mother.\nThis was, therefore, overwhelmingly a traditional White, urban, working-class\nsample of British origin.\nmales who were still alive, and it was always possible to interview a high propor-\nall the convicted males and an equal number of randomly chosen unconvicted\n85 males were interviewed, so results obtained in that interview are not used in\nthis article.\nOnset, desistance and criminal career duration 243\nCriminal record searches\nUp to 1994, searches were carried out in the central Criminal Record Office or\nNational Identification Service (CRO/NIS) at Scotland Yard in London to try\nto locate findings of guilt of the males and their biological relatives. The mini-\nmum age of criminal responsibility in England is 10. The Criminal Record Of-\nfice contained records of all relatively serious offences committed in Great\nBritain or Ireland and also acted as a repository for records of minor juvenile of-\nfences committed in London. In the case of 18 males who had emigrated outside\nGreat Britain and Ireland by age 32, applications were made to search their\ncriminal records in the eight countries where they had settled, and searches\nwere actually carried out in five countries. Only seven males were counted as\nnot at risk of conviction, because they emigrated permanently before age 21,\nwere not convicted and were not searched abroad.\nConvictions were only counted if they were for `standard list' (more serious)\noffences, thereby excluding minor crimes such as traffic infractions and simple\ndrunkenness. The most common offences included were thefts, burglaries and\nunauthorised takings of vehicles, although there were also quite a few offences\nof violence, vandalism, fraud and drug abuse. Twenty males were considered to\nbe missing on the age of desistance and on the duration of criminal careers, be-\ncause they died or emigrated before age 32.\nFurther searches of criminal records of the Study males took place in July\naged 51. The Home Office report (Farrington et al., 2006) and many previous\nanalyses were based on the criminal records up to age 50 derived from these\nsearches. A further search of the PNC was completed in March 2011, when\nmost males were aged 57. The criminal records of the males are therefore known\nIt was decided to count officially recorded cautions as well as convictions in\nthe PNC, because cautions were routinely recorded on a national basis from\n1995. We have now gone back and included cautions that were recorded in\nthe files at earlier ages. The definition of what is a `standard list' offence changed\nover time. In particular, common assault became a standard list offence in July\nand disorderly offences were added in April 1997. We have included all these\ntypes of offences in our analyses.\nSelf-reported offending\nasked to self-report offences that they had committed that had not necessarily\ncome to the notice of the police. The median ages at interview were 14 years\n3 months and 47 years 8 months. (The last interview was considered to be at age\n48 because the average age at interview was 48.0.)\nThe self-report offences were presented on cards, and the males were initially\nasked to sort the cards according to whether or not they had committed each act\nduring a specified reference period. Where the males had reading difficulties, the\ncards were read out to them. More detailed questions were then asked about the\noffences reported, such as how many times the person had done it, the age he had\nfirst done it and the age he had last done it. The reference periods were: ever\n5 years (ages 32 and 48). The self-reports at the oldest age are termed self-reports\nTen types of offences were enquired about on most occasions: burglary, theft\nof motor vehicles, theft from motor vehicles, shoplifting, theft from machines,\ntheft from work, fraud, assault, drug use and vandalism. Questions about theft\nfrom work and fraud were first asked at age 21, whereas questions about the other\neight types of offences were asked from age 14. The exact wording of the items at\nthe different ages are shown in Farrington (1989). These 10 types of self-reported\noffences have been compared with the corresponding 10 types of offences leading\nto convictions (Farrington et al., 2013a). However, assault and drug use are not\nstudied in this article because the males were not asked to report the first and last\nages at which they had committed these offences.\nFor each offence, the earliest age of onset and the latest age of desistance that\nwere reported in the six interviews were recorded. Two males who were missing\nfrom both of the first two interviews (at ages 14 and 16) were considered to be\nnot known on age of onset, whilst 21 males who were missing from both of the\nlast two interviews (at ages 32 and 48) were considered to be not known on\nage of desistance (and on duration). In total, 32 males were not known on dura-\ntion according to either self-reports or convictions, and consequently our analy-\nses focus on the remaining 379 males who were known on both. In the interests\nof comparability, only convictions up to age 48 are compared with the self-\nreports up to age 48. Also, where offences were self-reported at two ages with a\nhave committed these offences during the intervening years at the average rate\nat which they committed them during the known age ranges.\nResults\nCriminal career features according to self-reports\nTable 1 shows the average ages of onset and desistance, together with the average\ncareer duration, for the eight offences according to self-reports. It also shows the\npercentage of males who admitted each offence (prevalence) and the average\nnumber of offences committed by each offender (frequency). For example,\nOnset, desistance and criminal career duration 245\nTable 1: Criminal career duration in self-reports\nOffence Prevalence Frequency Onset Desistance Duration\nOnset-percentiles Desistance-percentiles\nNote: Based on 379 males up to age 48. All figures, except prevalence and frequency, show ages. Six offences exclude theft from work and fraud.\n30.3% of males admitted at least one burglary, and the average burglar committed\n7.5 burglaries up to age 48. The average age of onset of burglary was 14.4, the\naverage age of desistance was 18.1 and the average burglary career duration was\n3.7 years. Table 1 also shows percentiles for onset and desistance. For example,\nthe median age of onset for burglary was 14, whilst the median age of desistance\nThe offences with the earliest average ages of onset were vandalism (10.6) and\nshoplifting (11.3). These also had the earliest average ages of desistance: 15.2 for\nvandalism and 16.5 for shoplifting. Both offences had a median age of onset of 11\nand a median age of desistance of 14. The offences with the latest average ages of\nonset were theft from work (20.3) and fraud (22.7), and both also had the latest\naverage ages of desistance: 32.1 for theft from work and 38.2 for fraud. The\nshortest criminal careers were for theft of vehicles (2.5 years) and theft from au-\ntomatic machines (2.6 years), whilst the longest careers were for theft from work\nAlmost all males (98.2%) committed at least one of these eight offences at\nsome stage, and the average offender committed 112 offences of these eight types.\nThe average criminal career of 24.9 years began at age 10.3 and finished at age\n35.2. However, these results are greatly affected by the rather atypical offences\nof theft from work and fraud. Focusing only on the other six offences, 95.8% of\nmales admitted at least one of them, and the average offender committed 30\noffences. The average criminal career of 9.6 years began at age 9.9 and finished\nat age 19.5. According to self-reports, most males began between ages 8 and 12\nCriminal career features according to convictions\nTable 2 shows prevalence, frequency, onset, desistance and duration information\nbased on convictions. In all cases, conviction careers were shorter than self-report\ncareers. As expected, in all cases, ages of onset were later according to convic-\ntions than according to self-reports. However, apart from theft from work and\nfraud, ages of desistance were also later according to convictions, which was\nnot expected. Theft from machines (17.2) and theft of vehicles (17.5) had the\nearliest average ages of onset in convictions, whilst vandalism (25.9) and fraud\n(28.1) had the latest average ages of onset. Theft from machines (17.6) and theft\nfrom vehicles (19.1) had the earliest average ages of desistance, whilst vandalism\n(27.9) and fraud (28.9) had the latest average ages of desistance.\nOver all eight offences, the results were as expected: a shorter criminal career\naccording to convictions (from 19.1 to 25.1) than according to self-reports\n(from 10.3 to 35.2). However, excluding theft from work and fraud, the results\nwere not as expected, because the age of desistance in convictions (23.4) was\nlater than in self-reports (19.5). Over all 18 types of offences that were included\nas convictions, the average criminal career lasted 9.2 years, from age 18.9 to age\nOnset, desistance and criminal career duration 247\nTable 2: Criminal career duration for convictions\nOffence Prevalence Frequency Onset Desistance Duration\nOnset-percentiles Desistance-percentiles\nNote: Based on 379 males up to age 48.

However, based on six offences, the results\nmore in self-reports, compared with 8 out of 117 offenders (6.8%) in convictions.\nTable 4 directly compares career durations in self-reports and convictions for\neach offender, based on six types of offences. For 117 offenders in both self-\nreports and convictions, it is obvious that durations in self-reports tend to be re-\nlated to durations in convictions. For example, 95% of males with a self-report\nduration of 0\u00ad5 years also had a conviction duration of 0\u00ad5 years, compared with\nonly 43.5% of males who had a self-report duration exceeding 20 years. Con-\nversely, only 5% of males with a self-report duration of 0\u00ad5 years had a convic-\ntion duration exceeding 10 years, compared with 30.4% of males who had a\nself-report duration exceeding 20 years. As expected, the percentage of males\nwho were convicted increased with the duration of criminal careers according\nto self-reports.\nTable 5 shows the probability of a self-reported offence being convicted, and\nthe probability of a convicted offence being self-reported, in five age ranges.

This probability decreased\nConclusions\nIt was expected that the prevalence and frequency of offending would be higher\naccording to self-reports than according to convictions, and this was indeed\nfound. Over eight offences, there were 112 self-reported offences per offender\non average, compared with 3.3 convictions, a ratio of 34 to 1. Between 1%\nand 28% of different types of offences led to convictions.\nIt was expected that, in self-reports, the age of onset would be earlier, the age\nof desistance would be later, and the criminal career duration would be longer.\nThis was indeed found over all eight offences studied in this article. The age of\nonset in self-reports was 9 years earlier, the age of desistance was 10 years later\nand the career duration was 19 years longer. However, when the analysis was re-\nstricted to six offences, the average age of desistance was later in convictions.\nThis may have been caused by increasing concealment of offences as the men be-\ncame older. Studies of the validity of self-reports of offending suggest that they\nare extremely valid for young males but less valid for other demographic groups\n(e.g. older people and females: see Farrington, 2001). In the present analysis,\nthe probability of a convicted offence being admitted decreased from 86% at\nUp to now, virtually nothing is known about the duration of criminal careers\nbased on self-reports.

However, this is the first article to study the duration of criminal careers in\nboth convictions and self-reports up to middle age.\nEven based on six offences, the age of onset was 8 years earlier in self-reports\nand the career duration was over 4 years longer.
