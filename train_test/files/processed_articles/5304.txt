Her concerns are\nmainly social and not political. Unlike Bapsi Sidhwa (An\nAmerican Brat, 1993) and Mohammed Hanif (A Case of\nExploding Mangoes, 2008), Shahraz is not interested in the\nravages of General Zia's military regime and its tailored\nIslamization in the late 1980s Pakistan. Similarly, her fiction\nalso stands apart from the ramifications of 9/11 unlike\nMohsin's Hamid's critique (The Reluctant Fundamentalist,\n2007) on the Muslim fundamentalist discourse which pre-\ndominantly surfaced as an aftermath of the said tragedy. This\nindeed is something which distinguishes Shahraz's writings\nfrom the mainstream Pakistani fictions written in English\nwhich are predominantly political (Siddiqui, 2011). The tra-\njectory of Shahraz's literary sensibility is overwhelmingly\nsocial with an exclusive focus on the woman question as it\nstands in the postcolonial milieu of rural Pakistan. This\nexplains her interest in the social positioning of Pakistani\nwomen especially in relation to practices like enforced mar-\nriage and celibacy, violence in marriage, divorce, female\nsexuality, hijab, inheritance, childbearing, and so on. In the\ncontext of Pakistani fiction written in English, Shahraz, like\nmany of her contemporaries, can be categorized as a dias-\npora writer who displays an increasing sense of postcolonial-\nity featuring the lives of Pakistani masses in general. This\nexplains why her fiction essentially features the dynamics of\nstruggle, identity, representation, and the problems of the\nindigenous culture as it functions through a post(-)colonial\nsociety which is still holding on to the remnants of a by-gone\nShahraz's texts, especially her novel The Holy Woman\n(2001), are deeply embedded in the intricacies of tradition,\ncustom, and passion that feature the present-day Pakistan.\nHer characters apparently deal with situations, which are\nmostly mundane and quite day-to-day. Nevertheless, they\neventually embark upon circumstances that bring out queer\nstories. Shahraz opts for rural settings where lives of people\nare intense but filled with tradition and humility. With this\ncomes in the problem of tribal tradition which stands in the\nway of change--a fact not new to Muslim rural culture since\nthe tribal society of 7th-century Arabia too resisted changes\nthat had been brought about by Islam (Haddad & Esposito,\n1997). Such a fixation with tradition poses extraordinary\nchallenges to women in rural Pakistan. This explains why the\nlives of Shahraz's characters comprise several complexities,\nthus provoking the readers' minds. Besides the rural plane,\nShahraz's text also operates at the global level where she\ndepicts Muslims being citizens of a world which is now most\n1Kinnaird College for Women, Lahore, Pakistan\nCorresponding Author:\nNausheen Ishaque, Department of English Language, Literature and\nApplied Linguistics, Kinnaird College for Women, 93 Jail Road, Lahore\nPakistan.\nEmail: nausheenishaque@gmail.com\nViolence Ritualized: The Chemistry of\nTradition and Religion in Qaisra\nShahraz's The Holy Woman\nNausheen Ishaque1\n Keywords\nreligion, tradition, postcolonialism, the Quran, haqbakhswana, hijab, female sexuality, celibacy, veiling\n2 SAGE Open\nglobalized and urbanized. Human suffering and agony at the\nhands of a perverted fate is one of her favorite themes. This\ncan be seen in case of Zari Bano, her protagonist in The Holy\nWoman. Shahraz fixes her authorial focus on her country of\norigin, which is a tradition-bound Muslim society.\nShahraz's affiliation with \"Muslim\" feminism has brought\nher under the spotlight both among her Muslim and non-\nMuslim readers. It is therefore imperative to critically study\nher position as a Muslim feminist in a post-9/11 world that\nhas witnessed huge shifts in socio-literary allegiances of\nMuslim authors, especially the ones with diasporic identities.\nlike that of Shahraz as these are based on representational\npolitics using the feminist agenda and reinforce Western\nhegemonic discourse. This reminds one of the views upheld\nby Hamid Dabashi (2011) who attaches the term \"comprador\nintellectuals\" with the highly feted writers originating from\nthe East but celebrated in the West for their undaunted show\nof dissent from within the Muslim world (p. 72). Dabashi is\nintensely critical of such writers as their literary and intel-\nlectual output justifies the demonization and dehumanization\nof Arab world in particular and Muslim world in general.\nUndoubtedly, on a superficial reading, the politics of\nfemale representation in Shahraz's text is sensational. Zari\nBano's destiny associated with haqbakhshwana1 (which is\ntoday a rare thing happening anywhere in rural Pakistan) has\nbeen made so overwhelming that it appears to be the story of\nevery feudal's daughter in the countryside. This may be\nextended to Md. Mahmudul Hasan's (2005) thesis of the ore-\nintalization of gender, as he critiques the tendency of charac-\nterizing the women from the East as backward, domesticized,\ntradition-bound, ignorant and poor. Such caricaturing was\nlong ago initiated by the West and is now kept in continuum\nby both the Western and Eastern writers. This homogeniza-\ntion and essentialization of the women of postcolonial\nnations is what one may regard as part of the oreintalization-\nof-gender project. It is on account of such notions that one,\nwhile reading texts like Shahraz's The Holy Woman, must\nsee whether these establish the authors as native \"infor-\nmants\" or \"informers.\" This is for such writers, as argued by\nDabashi (2011), may prove an assistance to the imperialist\nproject in substituting the \"black demon with a brown one\nand a Jew with a Muslim\" (p. 36).\nIt is popularly upheld that many of the writers, especially\nwith diasporic or postcolonial identity, write for the Western\naudience. This carries the reservation that such works may\nascribe normative value to Western standards of looking at\nand criticizing the non-Western cultures and lifestyles.\nShahraz's cultural narratology in her The Holy Woman may\nbe seen in light of her reflection on the Western conception\nof Muslim cultural identity. Kidwai (2011) however puts for-\nward the idea that The Holy Woman can be read in the larger\ncontext of globalization and modernity with respect to con-\nventional Muslim rural society of Pakistan. It can be safely\nargued that the main plot dwelling on Zari Bano's marriage\nwith the Quran in The Holy Woman unavoidably creates sen-\nsationalism. Shahraz's reporting on the cultural realities of\nrural Pakistan carry an essential resonance of violence, a fact\nwhich may endanger her position as a cultural critic. Her\nplots are featured by melodrama too, something which may\narguably posit her as a \"native informer.\" Men, in Shahraz's\nworld, both jeopardize women's destinies (in case of Habib\nKhan and Siraj Din in The Holy Woman) as well as rescue\nthem (in case of Haroon in Typhoon). Critically speaking,\nthis further stamps women's helplessness, making them\nmore subalternized and adding to their othering thus sub-\nscribing to the orientalization of gender as discussed by\nHasan (2005). Nonetheless, her way of looking at Islam as a\nremedy to all these and many other socio-domestic problems\n(as can be seen through her fiction and interviews) is what\nestablishes her as a Muslim feminist who refuses to be part of\nthe contemporary Islamphobia.\nA simple subscription to Dabashi's critique of the role of\nbrown authors as \"native informers\" essentially carries a\nquestion: Just out of the fear of betraying one's inherited\nlegacy, should one stop speaking the truth? Shahraz's work\nmay be orientalist in the representation of Pakistani women's\nsituation in the postcolonial rural context. It exposes the feu-\ndal lord acting as a surrogate to the departed colonizer thus\nbecoming the indigenous colonial bourgeois. Moreover, it\nmay be too excessive a portrayal of fatalism on the part of\nwomen like Zari Bano who are remarkably urbanized in their\napproach toward life. Nevertheless, all this is countered and\nthen nullified in the face of Shahraz's foregrounding of Islam\nas the ultimate authority in every facet of life among\nMuslims. To illustrate, Zari Bano, Shahraz's protagonist in\nThe Holy Woman, has been placed at the center of a situation\nwhere Islam has been shown misappropriated to the maxi-\nmum. Certainly, religious values affect cultural beliefs and\npractices and vice versa as religion is a discursive tradition\nwhich is always already relived and embedded in relations of\npower in the society. Declaring religion key to history,\nDawson believes it to be a life-giving force which shapes the\ndynamism of not only a culture but also determines various\nsocial classes that feature a society (Dawson, 2013, p. 38).\nThe problem nevertheless occurs when customary tribal\npractices are confused with religion (in this case Islam) for\nappropriating power relations in favor of men. The worst of\nthe worst comes when these tribal or folk practices are legiti-\nmized and ritualized in the name of religion. This may in fact\nbe taken as an effort on the author's part to defend Islam's\nposition which, in its episteme, is considered misogynist.\nThis article aims at laying bare the dangerous chemistry\nof religion and tradition as designed against women in feudal\nhierarchies in particular and postcolonial rural set ups in gen-\neral. The Holy Woman by Qaisra Shahraz stands as a repre-\nsentative text in this connection as it highlights the way\nreligion is wrongfully twisted into the melting pot of tradi-\ntional ritual, something which is bound to serve the andro-\ncentric order prevailing in places like rural Pakistan. In this\nconnection, issues like female sexuality, enforced celibacy\nand hijab surface through Shahraz's novel. Nevertheless,\nwhat is needed is an endeavor to probe into the kind of space\ngranted by Islam to its female followers, something, which\nhas unfortunately been made to subsume into misogyny.\nReview of Related Literature\nDiscourse on gender in Islam is indeed not a new subject.\nNonetheless, even an extensive search tells one that it is hard\nto find literature that exists on gender and Islam in exclusive\nrelation to literature. In the context of Muslim female per-\nspective appearing in literature, Women Claim Islam by\nMiriam Cooke (2001) is a rare yet seminal contribution. The\nbook revisits literature, fiction and memoirs by contempo-\nrary Muslim feminist authors while focusing how these\nwomen through their narrative and social activity have chal-\nlenged their being ruled out of the discourses on religion,\nwar, history, exile and emigration. The book offers the devel-\nopment of a whole episteme of a gendered ideology based on\nIslam which questions patriarchy and male authority at\nindigenous levels (in terms of the interpretation of the Islamic\ndoctrine) as well as the biased and colonial narratives about\nMuslim women. The book serves twofold purposes: It histo-\nricizes Islamic feminism and analyzes the fiction and autobi-\nographies of Arab Muslim women writers as different as\nNawal El Saadawi and Zaynab al-Ghazali.\nDiah Ariani Arimbi's (2009) Reading Contemporary\nIndonesian Muslim Women Writers looks at the writings of\npopular Indonesian Muslim women authors in relation to\nhow gender is constructed and in turns determines the roles,\nstatus and identity of the Muslim women in the Muslim soci-\nety of Indonesia. For Arimbi, literary representation in\nIndonesia has now become one of the many ways through\nwhich women carve out their own ways for looking at their\nown selves. It is thus a medium portraying women's strate-\ngies to take maximum control of their lives and bodies. The\nbook serves a number of purposes: First, it projects how\ngender-related issues are brought forth in the narratives of\ncontemporary Muslim women writers in Indonesia; second,\nit shows how Muslim women of Indonesia are shown in\nthese narratives; third, it investigates a variety of aesthetic\nstyles and narrative structures while recognizing how issues\nof aesthetics are intertwined inseparably with those of gender\nconstruction, identity, power, representation, and prevailing\nreligious ideology; and finally, it investigates how these nar-\nratives by Indonesian Muslim women authors have sus-\ntained, challenged, worked, and reworked the perceptions,\nroles, and status of women in the Muslim societies.\nSuch a woman-centric sensibility takes one on a journey\nto reading Qaisra Shahraz's The Holy Woman. Sana Imtiaz\nand Shirin Haider (2011) discuss the recolonization of the\nfemale mind and body by ritualizing violence. They also\naddress the structure of representation of the female charac-\nters in Shahraz's The Holy Woman. To Imtiaz and Haider, the\nprocess of making a woman \"holy\" is part of colonial behav-\nior which involves ritual for legitimizing violence. Ironically,\nthe protagonist Zari Bano in Shahraz's text materializes her\nfree will and negates androcentricity by accepting confine-\nment and giving up her rights as a woman. Becoming \"holy\"\nis synonymous to being devoid of any physical, bodily, or\nemotional needs. Nevertheless, being a woman adds more to\nthis so-called \"holiness\" - a fact bound to culminate in the\nsupposed passivity of the female sex. To Imtiaz and Haider,\nthe politics of representation and issue of gender are inter-\ntwined thus shaping the spirit of Shahraz's text.\nDiscussing Shahraz's themes and concerns, Sherin\nShervani (2011) asserts that Shahraz mainly addresses the\nissues featuring contemporary society. She is highly con-\nscious of the relation of such issues with the norms of Islam.\nSherani appreciates Shehraz's texts in the sense that they\nencapsulate the severity and complexity of simple lives of\nthe people in the countryside in Pakistan. However, Shahraz\nis also interested in the metamorphosis of life and fate which\nmay give out horrific experiences. Shahraz manages to direct\nher protagonist to an Islamic stance ironically by means of an\nold feudal norm (marriage with the Quran) which is most\nunIslamic in itself. Maintaining the balance between the\nproblems of the present-day world and a Muslim perspec-\ntive, Shahraz welcomes Islamic values as a remedy to the\nproblems plaguing the contemporary Muslim world today.\nKidwai (2011) establishes that the \"newly emerging\nMuslim woman of our time\" is what is most characteristic of\nShahraz's cultural narratology in The Holy Woman (p. 85).\nShahraz, in a most dexterous manner, makes the old order\ncollapse under its own weight. This naturally helps synchro-\nnize the lives and situations of Pakistani women in relation to\nmodernity and globalization. To illustrate, Zari Bano turns\nher suffering (of being pushed into the role of a holy woman)\ninto an enlightening experience since becoming a holy\nwoman ironically exempts her from the traditional roles (of\nwife and mother) and gives her liberty to travel and study\nabroad. It is from her study in Egypt that she learns the real-\nity of Islam in terms of the space it grants to women. What,\naccording to Kidwai, adds more to the place of a Muslim\nwoman in Shahraz's text is the fact that the women in her\nworld tend to acquire their rightful position while avoiding\nthe \"hysterical harangue against the clergy\" (p. 81).\nReferring to Shahraz's The Holy Woman, Abu Bakar Ali\n(2013) reminds his readers that Muslim nationalism and its\nconsciousness are remarkably significant for Pakistani\nfemales. They aptly respond to the challenges proposed by\nthis religion-based ideology, especially in terms of its impli-\ncations for the gendered agency. While one talks of popular\nmass media in Pakistan, ranging from television drama to\nprinted fiction, romance is the pivot of everything. In case of\nSharhaz's The Holy Woman, however, romance goes even\nbeyond the limits ascribed to it. Today, the genre of romance\nis providing a platform where Pakistani women writers are\ncodifying and reconfiguring their potential part that they\n4 SAGE Open\nmay play in the nationalist milieu. Shahraz, through her\nnovel, expresses her concerns against the manipulation of\nthese nationalistic and cultural politics which put themselves\ninto practice across the lives and bodies of the women of\nrural Sindh in Pakistan. The intricacies of religion, gender,\nculture, and sex (which are inscribed on Zari Bano's body)\ncan thus be studied well in this regard, especially in unison\nwith the complexities of representation.\nAli Ahmed Kharal (2007) appreciates Shahraz's art as a\nnovelist as she effectively brings forth her characters to the\ncentre-stage. It is through her female characters that Shahraz\nspeaks for the female sensibility and consciousness of their\nrights among women. Her women characters assert their will\nby cutting loose the limitations, which circumcise the lives\nof Pakistani women. This acts as a marker of a change for the\nill-fated women of rural Pakistan as it allows them at least\nsome breathing space in a social order which is clearly\nmisogynistic.\nControlled Female Sexuality and the\nPolitics of Misogyny\nShahraz's text is essentially a saga of the politics of female\nsexuality which is manipulated and perpetuated against\nwomen's bodies especially in rural Pakistan. This is done\nboth at familial and public levels as can be seen in Shahraz's\nnovel where the men surrounding Zari Bano in her family are\nall inclined to control her sexuality both before and after her\nmarriage with the Quran. The story revolves around the trag-\nedy, which befalls Habib Khan (Zari's father) and his family\nwhen his only son and heir to his estate passes away in an\naccident. Zari is the eldest of Habib Khan's three children\nwhose education at university in Karachi has made her bold\nenough to decide about her marriage independently, though\nthis too turns out to be illusory later. Habib Khan receives a\nmarriage proposal for Zari by young and eligible Sikander\nwho happens to like Zari the moment he sees her.\nNevertheless, Zari's decision to visit and stay at Sikander's\nhouse (with an aim to know him in person before deciding to\nmarry) is no less than a thunderbolt for her aged grandfather\nSiraj Din (Habib Khan's father) who considers Zari's actions\nabhorring as he pronounces this to Shahzada (Zari's mother):\n\"Are you telling me, Shahzada, that my young unmarried\ngranddaughter has gone to stay all alone on a strange fami-\nly's home and is in the company of a single young man?\"\nyoung daughter in a kind of family where a girl cannot take\ncharge of her will regarding marriage before her elders, espe-\ncially the male ones. Habib Khan decides to wed Zari with\nthe Quran after the death of Jafar, his only son. He does this\nfollowing the feudal tradition of \"haqbakhshawana\" (girls'\nmarriage with the Quran for withholding land and estate\nwhich are considered fundamental for the dignity and socio-\neconomic survival of Pakistani feudal elite). This enables\nZari to act as a proxy to Jafar since marrying the Quran\nmeans celibacy for the rest of her life. Habib Khan takes the\ndecision in consultation with Siraj Din since the stratagem of\nthe Pakistani feudal families believes in withholding the\nestate through their male heirs. In absence of a male heir,\ntherefore, the entire estate goes away with girls once they are\nmarried (as Islam gives property rights to women). Zari Bano\nis thus ordained to become \"shehzadi ibadat\" or a holy\nwoman. Unfortunately, all this is achieved in the name of\ntradition which, in a most unjust manner, conspires with\npatriarchy under the shelter of religion. Thus, one sees Zari's\nwedding with the Quran as the only \"culturally legitimate\"\nway Habib could save his ancestral estate slipping out of his\nhands. Sikander, on the contrary, is forced by his parents to\nmarry Zari's younger sister Ruby who is lucky enough not to\nspend a life of celibacy unlike her elder sister. Sikander\nunwillingly marries Ruby but develops frustration against\nZari for succumbing to the gruesome order of her family.\nZari Bano clearly knows what it means to be a holy\nwoman. She fears a life of celibacy and being a Muslim fully\nowns her right to get married and that too with her own con-\nsent. Habib knows how to repress her voice and restrain her\nsexuality by putting her down in a most embarrassing man-\nner. The shared values between the father and the daughter\nmake Zari Bano succumb to her father's order. Being mar-\nried is a foil for \"holiness\" and this is what Habib enforces\nupon his daughter. Zari, on the contrary, launches her humble\nprotest against this:\nI want to be a normal woman, Father, and live a normal life! I\nwant to get married! I am not a very religious person, as you\nknow. I am a twentieth century, modern, educated woman. I am\nnot living in the Mughal period--a pawn in a game of male\nchess. Don't you see, Father, I have hardly ever prayed in my\nlife, nor opened the Holy Quran on a regular basis. How can I\nthus become a Holy Woman? I am not suited to that role.\nAnd Habib's pungent response to her appeals goes in\nthese words: \"What you are trying to say is that you want a\nman in your life\" (Shahraz, 2001, p. 62). He pressurizes her\nfurther by putting her into the same mold of tradition and\nblood ties which ensnare nearly every Pakistani woman:\nYou can shout as much as you like, my proud, beloved daughter,\nbut you will do as I say--I know you will. We are two of a kind.\nYou will never let me down, I know, nor our traditions, nor your\ngrandfather. If you cannot abide by my decision, at least think of\nIt is evident that Habib perpetuates his patriarchal and\nmisogynist order on the body, mind, and soul of his daughter.\nHe, on account of his position as a father and authority as a\nfeudal lord, successfully attaches the concept of honor to the\ndismissal and negation of the bodily side of his daughter's\nbeing. It is Habib's remark of desiring for a man which com-\npels Zari Bano to give up. He exploits her womanly self by\nassaulting her ego. Furthermore, a lot of manipulation is\ndone in the name of religion. As Fatima Mernissi (1987)\nimparts awareness to her readers about these situations while\ndrawing upon history and concludes that,\nNot only the sacred texts have been manipulated, but the\nmanipulation of them is the structural characteristic of the\npractice of power in Muslim societies. So all power, from the\nseventh century on, was only legitimized by religion, political\nforces and economic interests pushed for the fabrication of false\ntraditions. (p. 9)\nZari Bano's marriage with the Quran is an idea which\nfinds absolutely no space in Islam. Habib Khan considers the\nrejection of this tyranny as the betrayal of values and blood.\nFrom a structuralist point of view, one feels the compulsion\nof looking at the word \"holy\" in terms of its opposite which\nis \"unholy.\" From this standpoint, it is the latter of the binary\nwhich defines and qualifies the former. It is therefore Habib's\nemphasis on a woman's desire for marriage or man which\nmakes Zari highly conscious of becoming \"unholy\" in the\neyes of her father. And indeed, it is this fear of \"unholy\"\nwhich in turn convinces her to take up the life of a \"holy\"\nwoman. So, it is the fear of becoming \"unholy\" in her father's\neyes to which Zari succumbs. Jafar's (Zari's brother) death is\nan irreparable loss to the family. Habib and his father Siraj\nDin look at the tragedy in terms of the demise of not only\ntheir child but also that of their feudal domain. The fear of\nlosing the inheritance by making their daughter marry is an\nact which is \"unholy.\" Lands, to the feudal hierarchy, are as\nsacred as mothers, as it is commonly said and believed\namong feudal and land owners in Pakistan that, \"Selling\naway one's lands is tantamount to selling away one's mother.\"\nIt is again the horror of the \"unholy\" which makes Zari\nBano exercise a strict control over her own sexuality. Her jour-\nney to becoming a holy woman can be critically seen in two\ndistinct phases. The first phase entails her struggle against her\ncoded and emblematic disposition as the most devout woman.\nThis is the period when she strives to reclaim her right to mar-\nriage. The latter phase, which develops after her journey and\nstudy abroad, brings out the side of her character she herself is\nnever aware of. It is in this phase that Zari Bano confronts and\nthen learns how to control her sexuality. Initially, this control\nhad been something not more than an imposition on her by her\nfather. Later, however, the same control becomes the articula-\ntion of her liberty and free will, both as a woman and a scholar\nof Islam. Zari Bano is driven by this control so much so that\nshe shows reluctance in running a normal matrimonial relation\neven after her marriage with Sikander. She is afraid of the\nbodily drives she experiences and so prays to Allah:\nAllah pak, please heed the prayers of a weak woman, a sinner.\nGuide me back on to Your path of peace and religious devotion.\nTear out this ugly human emotion that is renting me apart and\ntorturing my soul. Douse this longing, that fire that is engulfing\nmy body. I am supposed to be a pure woman. How can I be that\nwhile I harbor such base feelings? Enfold me in Your holy\nmantle of female modesty. Rid my mind and heart of this man\nwho haunts me at this moment. Show me Your path; for that is\nFrom a cultural point of view, as Aslam (2005) asserts,\nlives of women in Pakistan always remain subject to issues of\nmorality and immorality. Thus, Pakistani women fear their\nown sexuality. They do this to obtain social acceptance,\nsomething denied to them if they act otherwise. This is what\nis evident in Zari Bano's character also. Her past as a feminist\ndemonstrating resistance to the patriarchal order of her soci-\nety is altogether a contradiction to what she takes up later in\nher life--a life of enforced celibacy and religious devotion.\nShahraz's text is in fact defensive in its composition. She is\nnot only vocal about how women's lives are encroached upon\nin the name of tradition and religion but also brings into lime-\nlight the global perspective upheld about Muslim women in\ngeneral and those in Pakistan in particular.This is for Muslims,\nall over the world, believe Islam to be not only a code of faith\nbut also a complete code of life. For Kharal (2007), Shahraz's\ntext significantly marks the change that has already been\nthere all over the world, that is, the question of women rights\nand their status. This is achieved effectively by her protago-\nnist by challenging the constraints imposed by gender biases\nupon a woman's will and life.\nFemale Celibacy\nThe Holy Woman presents a certain dialectic process ongoing\nbetween the \"oppressor\" and the \"oppressed\" (Imtiaz &\nHaider, 2011). This can be seen in terms of a dialogic rela-\ntionship between the two where the oppressed is traditionally\nsupposed to be mute or passive. Shahraz, however, develops\nher characters in a way that the oppressed challenge and\nquestion the way they are treated. This is for the binaries of\nsubject and object share each other's qualities. This encour-\nages the oppressed to hold the oppressor at least ethically\naccountable for all his wrongdoings. In addition to this, it\nalso creates a kind of hope since the oppressed are somehow\nin a position to at least question the injustices done to them.\nThis is especially true in the case of women who are canoni-\ncally believed to be doubly disadvantaged.\nKristen Holst and Ana Rutherford (1986) use the term\n\"double colonization\" while referring to the destiny of women\nwho simultaneously undergo the tyranny inflicted by the col-\nonizer and patriarchy. There is an entire series of male-ori-\nented myths which, according to Holst and Rutherford, are\ncelebrated by colonialism. These include missionaries, mate-\nship, freedom fighters, and so on. This establishes the fact that\nwomen are twice enslaved as long as the colonizer sustains\nwho even perpetuates the tyranny by transferring his powers\nto the indigenous patriarchal order. Gayatri Spivak's (1988)\nCan the Subaltern Speak? provoked a massive response\nwhich Spivak (1996) discusses in The Spivak Reader. The\n6 SAGE Open\nword \"speak,\" as used in her essay, has been commonly mis-\nunderstood. Spivak suggests that the usage of the word does\nnot imply that women never actually talked. What Spivak\ntends to highlight is the failure of their words to conduct\n\"transaction\" between the speaker and the listener.\nNow when it comes to the relationship between gender and\nsubalternity, one of the constructs in operation has been reli-\ngion. Religion is one of the constituents subsumed by culture as\na macroscopic entity. Whereas religion draws its energy from\nculture and vice versa, gender is dependent on both culture and\nreligion. While qualifying culture, Kuper (1999) takes it as \"a\nway of talking about collective identities\" (p. 3). Culture pri-\nmarily owes to what is indigenously sound and credible and the\nway people are organized. It is generally believed by the post-\nmodernists that gender is the product of the normative behavior\ndemonstrated toward men and women by culture and religion.\nThe history of religion (especially the monolithic religion) and\nthe traditional culture gives out stories of subordination of\nwomen to men. Traditional and religious practices are academ-\nically separable though they do interact and overlap each other\ninvariably. This is what occurs in Shahraz's text where misog-\nyny and patriarchy, especially in rural Pakistan, are legitimized\nin the name of tradition and religion.\nThe tradition of \"haqbakhshawana\" is what Zari Bano's\nlife orbits around. This entails the authority demonstrated by\nthe feudal class over their daughters and other women of\nfamily to keep the feudal legacy preserved within the family,\nespecially in case of the absence of a male heir. This is how\nHabib Khan justifies his wrongdoings he intends to commit\nagainst his own daughter in the name of tradition:\nWell, now that I have no son, who is going to be my heir,\nShahzada? To whom am I going to bequeath all this land? I am\nnot going to hand it over to some stranger who just happens to\nmarry my daughter. This is our land, accumulated and paid for\nby the sweat and toil of my forefathers, down the centuries by\ndifferent generations. Tell me what would you do in my position?\nSikander, in the course of his argument with Zari Bano,\ntends to explain this injustice. The same religion which is\nexploited to tyrannize women in fact gives them the right to\nlive and choose. Sikander's words actually hold a mirror to\nthe tradition-bound Pakistani society. He places the man-\nmade culture in opposition to the revealed word, thus expos-\ning the horrors of the former:\nHoly Quran! What nonsense is this? No woman is to be denied her\nnatural role as a wife and a mother. Who has invented these\ntraditions? Have they studied the Holy Quran, where it categorically\nstates that widows and divorcees should be encouraged to remarry\nat the first opportunity? So how can a beautiful young maiden be\ndeliberately denied marriage? (The Holy Woman, p. 89)\nIronically, Zari Bano is fully conscious of the rights given\nto her by Islam as a woman. Yet, what seems to be more\nimportant is to abide by all that has been decided by the males\nof her family. Even in her freedom, Zari Bano experiences\nsubjugation as she cannot succumb to the idea of the denial of\nher right to marry. Zari refers to the \"pinjra\" (cage) in which\nall women are destined to live. The key of this cage stays in\nthe hands of fathers or other male members of the family.\nZari's pain aggravates as she is fully aware of the rights her\nreligion has given to her. This creates irony as Zari Bano, who\nherself is denied the fundamental rights by her family,\nexplains what position Islam reserves for women. Zari Bano's\nidentity as a holy woman, when seen as a subject-constitutive\nreality, brings out a number of facts that feature the complex\nhermeneutics of religion in relation with identity, space and\nsexuality of the female. It is her father who ascribes the status\nof holy woman to her. Zari Bano is thereof exposed to a situ-\nation where her elevation accounts for her subjugation. This\ndichotomy subverts the subject position Zari Bano proclaims\nin general. Habib, her father, articulates the expected out-\ncomes of her so-called sacred position where one finds ritual\nin conspiracy with tradition and a society which is both com-\nplex and hypocritical. Michel Focault's famous proposition\nthat knowledge is a product of power fits right into this situa-\ntion. Pakistani women are hardly aware of what rights they\nenjoy being Muslim women. This particularly owes to our\npassivity as women never try to acquire any knowledge of\nSharia' (Islamic law). However, it also alludes to the role of\nPakistani males, especially the scholars on religion. who\nnever let the body of knowledge out which favors women.\nVeil: A Mechanism of Serving or\nDismantling Patriarchy\nMookherjee (2005), on the issue of hijab and veiling, holds the\nview that it involves certain controversy as it deals with two\nproblems of distinct nature. The issue arises from both feminist\nand postcolonial camps, respectively.As for the feminist stand-\npoint, women and young girls, in no way, must be forced to\nconform to any community's religious or conventional norms.\nIn terms of a postcolonial perspective, however, the increasing\nfocus on hijab is a matter of establishing biases against\nMuslim value systems. Mookherjee further refers to Elizabeth\nBadinter's (1989) universal feminist concern about the possi-\nbilities of female subjugation within the cultural communities.\nIn her debate over the headscarf issue of the young girls in\nFrance, she holds the view that the choice of adopting veil is\nsynonymous to giving up one's individual and personal auton-\nomy. She asserts that even if the Muslim girls take veiling as\nan expression of their autonomy, they are abiding by the\nMuslim values of female restraint, confinement and modesty.\nBadinter however fails to penetrate the spirit and episteme\nleading the Muslim women to cover their heads and bodies.\nMojab (2001) discusses the policing of women's bodies as a\nprominent site of debate for both feminism and postcolonial-\nsim. The idea of liberal recognition, favorite with the Western\ndiscourses is problematic when put under the postcolonial lens\nas, \" . . . it often presumes a stable world of public meanings\nand symbols. It relies on a settled public private distinction\nwhich frequently fails to engage with the third world women's\nstruggle for emancipation\" (Mookherjee, 2005, p. 2). Mojab\nthe veiling of Muslim women:\nThe veil, which since the nineteenth century has symbolized for\nthe West the inferiority of Muslim cultures, remains a powerful\nsymbol both for the West and for Muslim societies . . . Veiling is\na lived experience full of contradictions and multiple meanings.\nWhile it has clearly been a mechanism in the service of\npatriarchy, a means of regulating and controlling women's lives,\nwomen have used the same social institution to free themselves\nfrom the bonds of patriarchy. (p. 5)\nFor Zari Bano and her status as a holy woman, veil serves\nmultiple purposes. To illustrate, her marriage ceremony calls\nfor the bride to dress up with splendor and then cover this\nsplendor with veil. This carries a certain symbolism suggest-\ning the split of personality and the role Zari Bano is put into.\nShe surrenders her womanhood and even matrimony by get-\nting married to the Quran. Zari Bano, in her exasperation,\ncuts the locks of her hair which is a declaration of her readi-\nness to be a combatant in the politics of power and changing\nof roles. However, she shifts back to her female self (some-\nthing she has never been able to give up completely) at the\nwedding ceremony of her sister Ruby where she dances with\nother girls while going against her role of a holy woman. Zari\nBano's identity is thus fluid and remains in constant flux.\nZari Bano once again falls prey to the schism of her per-\nsonality after her marriage with Sikander. She is indecisive\nabout what to wear as it becomes difficult for her to cope\nwith \"marriage.\" She does not know whether she should\nwear dull colors as she used to 5 years ago or the pastel\nshades when now she is married:\nUntil now, I have gone everywhere in my burqa; now I am\nrequested to discard it at home. I am so used to the burqa, feel so\ntotally happy and safe behind it, Mother that without it I feel\nnaked and disoriented, very conscious of my body and its shape.\nZari Bano successfully recodes veil as a means of transcen-\ndence from the spatial boundary it conceptually and tradition-\nally connotes for women. Ali (2013) lays stress on the need to\nlook whether Shahraz's text \"[A]cts as a spring board for a vis-\nible (re) configuration\" (p. 197). As a matter of fact, it is the\n\"veiled\" persona of Zari Bano which \"enlightens\" her so much\nso that she dares to interrogate her formerly \"liberal\" position.\nHer veiling essentially challenges her vanity she carried with\nher and which was no more than a site serving the sexually\ncharged gaze of the males in her society. Unfortunately, how-\never, Zari's new role also serves the same patriarchy, which\nshe willfully negates by shunning her vanity. Her shrouded\nappearance materializes the socio-capitalist motivations of her\nfather Habib Khan which are tactfully given the garb of reli-\ngion. Therefore, \"The role Zari Bano now occupies is one that\nis consciously aware of the precondition of its feudal existence,\nwhere myth cannot transcend its own materiality\" (Ali, 2013,\np. 198). With her veiled identity, Zari happens to visit Egypt,\nEngland and the Far East as a student and an ambassador of\nreligion. It is thus interesting to note here how the capitalistic\nand feudal motives get turned on their own heads and impart\nZari the same authority which had been denied to her. She\ncomes to embrace and internalize her veiled identity as a reli-\ngiously rooted opportunity. This gives a political nuance to her\nposition as a holy woman which, at the same time, also empow-\ners her. Patriarchy thus comes to betray itself as Zari Bano tri-\numphantly closes the circle of misogyny. And so the readers\nsee how the same patriarchy, compelling Zari dump her essen-\ntial female sexuality, betrays itself as she refuses to marry\nSikander (for the sake of Ruby's young son after her death) on\naccount of being a \"holy woman.\" Even later, when she con-\ncedes to her elders'requests to marry Sikander, she agrees thor-\noughly on her own terms. Subscribing to her position as a\nveiled priestess, Zari first gives up her body and sexuality and\nreclaims it later. Sikander is denied any sexual access (which\nevery man considers his foremost right) for a considerably long\ntime after his marriage with Zari Bano. In fact to Zari Bano,\nhijab blesses her with a sense of self-worth, dignity and respect.\nShe dauntlessly criticizes the West for its critique on hijab:\nThe veil has always perplexed and tantalized the Western world,\nboth men and women alike. It is a disconcerting phenomenon\nfor them as much now as it ever was. Westerners have always\nmisunderstood the reason why women wear it. To add insult to\ninjury, they see it as a symbol of male oppression--a widely\naccepted stereotyped myth. They think that women are forced to\nConclusion\nShahraz's narrative reflects on the dangerous chemistry of\nreligion and tribal tradition especially when it is manipulated\nagainst women. It also proposes balance and understanding\nbetween Islam and the modern, day-to-day realities of human\nlife, especially that of Muslim women. The orientalist biases\nestablished against Islam as a religion and Muslims as a peo-\nple can be countered only if the scholarship on Islam is just\nand unprejudiced. Muslim women, from across the globe,\nform an unavoidable part of this polemics. This implicitly\nemphasizes that they must equip themselves with the stance\nupheld by Sharia' as Islam does not comprise only a set of\nrituals to be followed; it rather establishes itself as a com-\nplete code of life where there are clear-cut specifications of\nwhat status each of the two sexes enjoys, respectively, in\nterms of social position and interpersonal relationships.\nShahraz's cultural critique on the rural Sindh in Pakistan\nessentially brings the woman question and female space as it\n8 SAGE Open\nexists in an unbreakable relation with the looming postcolo-\nniality. Her female characters like Zari Bano are the conspic-\nuous reminders of how women can be the combatants for\ntheir own rights and learn to survive both within the tribal or\nindigenous order and the global plane they are part of. The\nrelation between tradition and religion, especially when\nplaced within the postcolonial order, gives out circumstances\nwhich are generally designed against women thus naturally\nfavoring men. The need therefore is to reconsider and revisit\nthe relation that exists between the tribal and the religious.\nThis is what is likely to guarantee some breathing space for\nwomen like Zari Bano who experience intense suffocation\nwhen violence or tyranny is ritualized in the name of religion\nin places like rural Pakistan.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nNote\n1.
