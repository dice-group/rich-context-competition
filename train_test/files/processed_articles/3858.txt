These studies reported that the\naddition of various antioxidants, such as\nvitamin E, vitamin C, b-carotene, melato-\nnin, propofol, and tannic and caffeic\nacids, as protective solutions had a positive\nWe hypothesize that the antioxidant\nproperties of resveratrol and serotonin\n(phenolic compounds) 11,12 may benefit the\nsusceptibility to oxidation and antioxidant\ncapacity of RBCs in stored blood. This is\nbecause reactive oxygen species (ROS),\nsuch as hydroxyl radical (OH\u00c0), superoxide\n\u00c0), and hydrogen perox-\n), increase oxidative stress in a\noxidation in membrane lipids and proteins,\nand antioxidants in the phenolic structure\ncan scavenge the factors that cause oxida-\ntive stress.14,15 Therefore, the lifespan of\nstored RBCs can be extended by reducing\noxidative stress.\nResveratrol is a natural compound that\nacts on various intracellular messengers11\nand is found in edible plant leaves and red\nwine, as well as in fruits, such as mulberry,\ngrapes, and peanuts.16,17 Because of the\nbeneficial effects of resveratrol on humans,\nresveratrol has become the focus of atten-\ntion worldwide. Gu\n\u00a8 lc\u00b8 in reported that\nresveratrol inhibited peroxidation of a lino-\nleic acid emulsion by 89.1% and was more\neffective than standard antioxidants, such\nas butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hy-\ndroxytoluene, a-tocopherol, and Trolox.16\nThis author also demonstrated that resver-\natrol was effective for its 1,1-diphenyl\n2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-Azino-bis\n[3-ethyl benzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid]\n(ABTS\u00fe), N, N-dimethyl-p-phenylenedi-\namine radical cation (DMPD\u00fe), and\n\u00c0 scavenging activity, H2\nreduction\npower, and Fe2\u00fechelating activity. Gu\n\u00a8 lc\u00b8 in\nalso reported that resveratrol exhibited ben-\neficial effects on cardiovascular diseases by\npromoting vasodilatation and inhibiting\noxidative damage and platelet aggregation.16\nSerotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) is syn-\nthesized in Drosophila by tryptophan-\nphenylalanine hydroxylase activation,\nwhich hydroxylates phenylalanine and tryp-\ntophan.18 Serotonin is an important neuro-\ntransmitter that has several biological\nroles.19 ABTS\u00fe radical scavenging activity\nand antioxidant properties of serotonin and\nsome of its derivatives have been tested.\nGu\n\u00a8 lc\u00b8 in found that melatonin and serotonin\nexhibited effective DMPD\u00fe radical\nscavenging and cupric ion (Cu2\u00fe) reduction\nactivity.12 The molecular structures of\nresveratrol and serotonin are shown in\nIn this study, we investigated the protec-\ntive effects of resveratrol and serotonin on\nlipid peroxidation and sensitivity to oxida-\ntion of RBCs in stored blood. We aimed\nto develop protective solutions and increase\nthe viability of RBCs. The effects of\nresveratrol and serotonin on total carbonic\nanhydrase (CA), catalase (CAT), and gluta-\nthione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, as\nwell as reduced glutathione (GSH) levels\nand pH, were also investigated.\nMaterials and methods\nThis study protocol was performed in ac-\ncordance with the ethical rules in human\nexperiments in the context of the World\nMedical Association Ethics Rules in the\nHelsinki Declaration. For this study,\nethics committee approval was obtained\nfrom the Yuzuncu Yil University Non-\nPharmaceutical Clinical Practices Local\nEthics Committee (REC number: 06/\nsary information was provided to the vol-\nunteers of the study.\nResveratrol and serotonin were obtained\nfrom Sigma Aldrich Company (St Louis,\nMO, USA). Four-way paediatric bag sys-\ntems connected to the main bag for blood\nsamples were purchased from Kansuk\nraethoxy propane, methanol, ethanol,\nhydrogen peroxide, and other chemicals\nwere obtained from Merck (Istanbul,\nTurkey).\nObtaining blood samples from\nvolunteers and preparing for\nmeasurements of parameters\nBlood from each healthy volunteer (n \u00bc 10)\nwas collected in four different paediatric\nbag systems (Kansuk) containing 70 mL of\nCPD at the Yuzuncu Yil University\nMedical Faculty Blood Center. Blood was\ntransferred to three paediatric bags at-\ntached to the main bag and categorized\ninto three groups (n \u00bc 30). One group was\nthe control group; 60 mg/mL resveratrol\n(resveratrol group) or 60 mg/mL serotonin\n(serotonin group) was added to blood for\nthe other groups. Blood was stored at \u00fe4C\nin a blood bank during the study.\ntaken from stored blood in each group at\nMeasurement of pH was performed using\n2 mL of whole blood. The remaining\n10 mL of whole blood samples were centri-\nwas discarded. Upper leucocytes and other\nimpurities were carefully removed using a\ndropper. An equal volume of isotonic solu-\ntion was added to the underlying erythro-\ncyte (RBC) solution and was slowly\noverturned. The supernatant was discarded\nFigure 1. Apparent molecular structure of resveratrol and serotonin\nafter centrifugation at 2500 \u00c2 g. This proce-\ndure was repeated three times and thorough\nwashing of the RBCs was achieved. The\nsusceptibility to oxidation of RBCs was\nmeasured in an erythrocyte suspension\nthat was prepared in azide buffer solution.\nThe remaining RBC packages were haemo-\nlysed with distilled ice water and frozen at\n\u00c080C until measurement of GSH levels,\nand GSH-Px, CAT, and CA activity.\nHaemoglobin measurement\nin RBC packages\nHaemolysate (20 mL) was added to a 5-mL\ndrabkin solution and incubated at room\ntemperature for 10 min. The absorbance\nof the mixture was measured colourimetri-\ncally on a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu\nHaemoglobin concentrations are expressed\nMeasurement of MDA by\nhigh-performance liquid\nchromatography (HPLC)\nwater were added to the 50-mL RBC suspen-\nsion in a test tube and the mixture was incu-\nbated for 60 min in a boiling water bath\n(total volume: 1.5 mL). After cooling in ice\nwater, the same volume of alkaline methanol\n(1/1 v/v) was added to the test tube and cen-\ntant (200 mL) was transferred to a vial and\ninjected into an HPLC apparatus (Agilent,\nBoblingen, Germany).

Measurements were made\nagainst standard samples of different con-\ncentrations at an excitation wavelength of\n527 nm and an emission wavelength of\nnmol/gHb.\nDetermination of susceptibility\nto oxidation of RBCs\nThe susceptibility to oxidation of RBCs\nin vitro was determined using the method\nof Stocks et al.21 The RBC suspension was\nprepared with azide buffer. A volume of\npared in buffered saline solution) was then\nadded to the same RBC suspension, and the\nmixture was incubated for 2 h at 37C for\noxidation. After 2 h, MDA levels were mea-\nsured on the HPLC apparatus,22 and the\nhaemoglobin concentration of the RBC\nsuspension was determined. MDA values\nare expressed as nmol/gHb.\nMeasurement of GSH-Px activity in RBCs\nErythrocyte GSH-Px activity was deter-\nmined using the method described by\nPaglia and Valentin.23 In this method,\nGSH reductase transforms oxidized GSH\nto reduced GSH in the presence of\nNADPH, accompanying the conversion of\nNADPH to NADP\u00fe. For this purpose, a\n970-mL reaction mixture (mixture of Tris,\nEDTA, GSH, NADPH, sodium azide,\nand GSH reductase) was added to 20 mL of\nsample and incubated for 5 min at 37C.\nsolution\nwas added to initiate the reaction, and de-\ncreasing absorbance values were measured\nPx activity is expressed as IU/gHb.\nMeasurement of CAT activity in RBCs\nCAT activity in RBCs was measured\naccording to the colourimetric method of\n(prepared in phosphate buffer\nRBC package. After 1 min, 1 mL of ammo-\nnium molybdate solution (32.4 mmol/L)\nwas added to the test tube to terminate\nthe reaction. Absorbance of the yellow\ncomplex formed by molybdate and H2\nwas measured spectrophotometrically at\n405 nm on a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu\nUV mini 1240). CAT activity is reported as\nkU/gHb.\nMeasurement of reduced GSH in RBCs\nGSH values in RBCs were measured spec-\ntrophotometrically according to the method\nof Fairbanks and Klee.25 The non-protein\nsulfhydryl groups in RBCs are normally in\nthe form of reduced GSH. DTNB, a disul-\nphide chromogen, is reduced to a yellow\ncompound by the sulfhydryl groups of the\nGSH in RBCs. Absorbance of the reduced\nchromogen shows maximum absorbance at\n412 nm. The concentration of this complex\nis directly proportional to the GSH concen-\ntration. Although the DTNB method meas-\nures all free sulfhydryl groups (protein-\nbound or protein unbound), the sulfhydryl\ngroups are thought to reflect the GSH\nvalue in RBCs because GSH levels are\nhigh in RBCs. GSH values are expressed\nas mg/gHb.\nDetermination of total CA activity in RBCs\nTotal CA activity in RBCs was measured\nusing the method described Rickly et al.26\nand modified by Wilbur and Anderson.27\nPurified water (0.55 mL), bromothymol\n(50 mL enzyme solution) were added to\ntubes containing 1 mL of veronal buffer\nthe conversion from the blue colour of the\nindicator to the yellowish-green (pH 6.8)\ncolour was determined by addition of\nsolution (total volume:\n4.2 mL) as the substrate (tc\n). As a reference\nmeasurement, we used the elapsed time for\nthe colour change using distilled water in-\nstead of haemolysate (t0\n). CA activity\n\u00c0hydratase activity) was calculated\nusing the (t0\n\u00c0 tc\n)/tc\nexpressed as U/gHb.\nMeasurement of pH\nValues of pH were measured with a commer-\ncially purchased blood gas kit (ABL90\nFLEX PLUS, Radiometer, Denmark) on\nan ABL 90 apparatus (Radiometer Medical\nMaterials Industry and Trade Ltd. Inc.,\nIstanbul, Turkey).\nStatistical analyses\nDescriptive statistics for continuous varia-\nbles are expressed as the mean and standard\ndeviation. Following analysis of variance,\nDuncan's multiple comparison test was\nused for inter-group comparison within\nthe same week and for intra-group compar-\nison between weeks. Statistical significance\nwas considered at 5% (p < 0.05). The SPSS\n15 statistical package program (Chicago,\nIL, USA) was used for calculations.\nResults\nVolunteers involved in the study (n \u00bc 10)\nwere people who had lived in Van city\ncentre in Turkey for at least 2 years. Four\nof the volunteers were Kurdish and six of\nthem were of Turkish origin. Volunteers\nwere healthy men between the ages of 21\nMDA levels in RBCs in all of the groups\nincreased in a time-dependent manner\n(p < 0.05). However, this increase was\ngreater in the serotonin group from week\npared with the other groups (p < 0.05)\n(Figure 2). We also tested the susceptibility\nof RBCs to oxidation in vitro. Two hours\nafter in vitro oxidation with H2\nMDA levels were increased in all groups in\na time-dependent manner during 5 weeks.\nHowever, after in vitro oxidation, MDA\nlevels in the resveratrol group were signifi-\ncantly lower than those in the other groups\nvitro oxidation with H2\n, MDA values on\ndays 21 and 28 in the serotonin group were\nsignificantly higher than those in the con-\ntrol and resveratrol groups (p < 0.05)\n(Figure 2).\nWe also compared changes in GSH-Px\nand CAT activity and levels of GSH,\nwhich function as antioxidants in RBCs,\nover time. GSH-Px and CAT activity, as\nwell as GSH levels, were decreased in the\ncontrol and serotonin groups, but were sig-\nnificantly preserved in the resveratrol group\nGSH-Px and CAT activity, as well as\nGSH levels, in the resveratrol group were\nalso significantly higher than those in\nand CAT activity, as well as GSH levels,\ndid not significantly change in the serotonin\ngroup, and were similar to those of the con-\ntrol group.\nWe further examined the change in CA\nactivity, which provides pH and ionic bal-\nance in RBCs over time.

We found that\npH was decreased in all groups time-\ndependently (p < 0.05). However, pH\nvalues on day 28 in the resveratrol group\nwere partially preserved according to the\ncontrol group, although this was not signif-\nicant (Figure 4). Additionally, pCO2\nvalues\nrapidly increased during the first 3 weeks,\nand then began to fall (p < 0.05). However,\nvalues in the resveratrol group were\nlower than those in the other groups on day\nDiscussion\nWe investigated the effects of resveratrol and\nserotonin on antioxidant defence status and\noxidative alterations that distort the physio-\nlogical functions of RBCs. We also exam-\nined their protective effects on CA enzyme\nactivity, which plays important roles, such\nas pH and ion balance in the body.\nStorage lesions are defined as changes\nthat result in irreversible damage and\ndecrease post-transfusion survival of blood\nor RBCs.30 The most obvious changes that\naffect RBCs during storage are an increase\nin lipid peroxidation levels and a decrease in\nthe activity of enzymes that play a role in\nthe antioxidant defence system, such as\nsuperoxide dismutase (SOD), CAT, and\nGSH-Px. Additionally, there are haemo-\nrheological changes, such as an increase in\nRBC sphere membrane deformation and\nmean Hb concentrations, and osmotic\nMost irreversible events occur as a result\nof long-term oxidative stress under non-\nphysiological storage conditions. One of\nthe most important reasons for an increase\nin oxidative stress is decreased antioxidant\ncapacity of RBCs or stored blood.32 ROS,\nwhich result from increasing oxidative\nstress in stored RBCs, lead to impaired\nmembrane integrity and cell death by\nattacking lipids and proteins in mem-\nbranes.30 Therefore, cells possess enzymatic\nor non-enzymatic antioxidant defence\nHowever, researchers have suggested that\nthese negative changes occur even if stored\nRBCs or blood are maintained under suit-\nable conditions. Various studies have been\nFigure 4.

Additionally, numerous studies\nhave shown that lipid peroxidation is atten-\nuated by the addition of metal chelators\nand antioxidant substances to stored\ntaken, donors are provided various antiox-\nidant preparations in their diet. Racek\net al.37 showed that stored blood was\nmore resistant to free radical damage if var-\nious antioxidant tablets were provided to\nvolunteers before blood collection.\nMelatonin is one of the strongest antiox-\nidants.38 Allegra et al.38 demonstrated that\nerythrocyte membrane proteins and lipids\nincreased the susceptibility to oxidation\nwith a cytotoxic effect of MDA in vitro.\nHowever, addition of melatonin to stored\nblood resulted in a protective effect of\nRBCs against these adverse events.\nSekeroglu et al.5 found that addition of\nmelatonin to stored blood significantly\npreserved the levels of erythrocyte MDA,\nglutathione, GSH-Px, and SOD in a time-\ndependent manner. In previous studies,\nMDA levels in erythrocytes increased in a\nshowed that MDA levels increased in\nRBCs in a time-dependent manner, consis-\ntent with these previous studies. We also\ntested the susceptibility of RBCs to oxida-\ntion in vitro. The susceptibility to oxidation\nof RBCs was increased under conditions\nof oxidative stress by addition of H2\nover time. This result supports the hypothe-\nsis that some changes occur in RBC mem-\nbranes because of oxidative damage\nduring the waiting period and that RBCs\nbecome less stable. In our study, resveratrol\nadded to stored blood significantly preserved\nthe susceptibility to oxidation of RBCs\ncompared with the control group.\nHowever, serotonin showed an adverse\neffect.\nIn addition to the endogenous antioxi-\ndant systems that play a protective role\nagainst oxidative stress in RBCs, there\nare other factors, such as SOD, GSH-Px,\nprimary antioxidant defence system and\nperforms decomposition of H2\nat high\nconcentrations.40 CAT completes\nthe detoxification reaction of H2\ninitiated\nby SOD to H2\ninitially low and increases with storage\ntime.5,32 This situation may be due to activ-\nity of GSH-Px that scavenges H2\nat low\nconcentrations. Previous studies have\nshown that an increasing storage time\ndecreases GSH-Px activity.5,31 Our study\nsuggested that GSH-Px activity in RBCs\nwas attenuated with increasing storage\ntime, in accordance with previous stud-\nies.5,31 However, addition of resveratrol\nand serotonin to stored blood increased\nGSH-Px activity in RBCs during the first\n2 weeks and significantly protected RBC\nin the following weeks compared with the\ncontrol group.\nCAT and NADPH protect RBCs against\nacute and high exogenous H2\nlevels,\nwhile GSH protects RBCs against endoge-\nnously produced low H2\nprevious study conducted by our group,\nCAT activity and GSH levels increased\nduring the first 2 weeks and decreased in\nthe following weeks.5,32 Our current study\nshowed that CAT levels in the resveratrol\nand serotonin groups increased during the\nfirst 3 weeks and were then attenuated in\nthe following weeks, consistent with previ-\nined total CAT levels at the end of day 28,\nCAT levels in the control and serotonin\ngroups were significantly lower compared\nwith the resveratrol group. Additionally,\nsimilar changes in GSH and CAT levels\nshowed a significant association between\nthese two parameters. The higher levels of\nCAT and GSH in the resveratrol group on\ndays 21and 28 may be due to the antioxi-\ndant properties of resveratrol.\nrepresent a large family of Zn-containing\nenzymes.43 A total of 16 different CA iso-\nenzymes have been identified in mam-\nmals.44,45 In various tissues, different CA\nisoenzymes participate in many important\nbiological processes, such as respiration,\ngas balance, calcification, photosynthesis,\nbone resorption, lipid synthesis, urea\nsynthesis, glucose synthesis, body fluid\nexchange, tumour cell growth, electrolyte\nrelease, CO2\nand ion transport, and acid-\nbase balance by regulating pH in the\neye and inner ear.46,47 CAs contribute to\npH balance in the human body and other\ntissues by catalysing two steps: providing\nH\u00fe and HCO3\n\u00c0 with hydration of CO2\nand converting HCO3\nin acidic\nmedium.48 CA activity is important because\na drop in pH has a negative effect on stored\nRBCs.32 There have been few studies on\nstored blood or RBCs concerning how CA\nactivity changes over time. In a previous\nstudy carried out by our group, CA activity\ndecreased in a time-dependent manner.32 In\nthe current study, CA activity was attenu-\nated in a time-dependent manner, similar to\nour previous study.32 The decrease in CA\nenzyme activity over time may be due to a\nloss of function of proteins depending on\nthe elapsed time, as in other enzymes.\nHowever, resveratrol may protect stored\nblood and RBCs against time-related acido-\nsis, as indicated by the partially preserved\nCA activity, and pH and pCO2\nvalues on\ndays 21 and 28 in the resveratrol group. In\nour previous study, resveratrol (30 mg/mL)\nsignificantly preserved the change in pH in\nstored RBCs.29 We believe that the reason\nwhy resveratrol did not exhibit a protective\neffect on the change in pH in this study may\nbe because resveratrol was used at a higher\nConclusions\nOur study shows that the antioxidant capac-\nity of RBCs is attenuated because of their\nincreasing susceptibility to oxidation and\ndecrease in GSH levels, and GSH-Px and\nCAT activity, in a time-dependent manner.\nFurthermore, the decrease in GSH-Px and\nCAT activity and GSH levels in RBCs is\nnegatively associated with CA enzyme activ-\nity and antioxidant capacity with susceptibil-\nity to oxidation over time. However,\naddition of resveratrol to stored blood pro-\ntects their antioxidant capacity and partially\npreserves CA enzyme activity and pH and\nlevels by decreasing the susceptibility\nto oxidation of RBCs. For this reason, low\nconcentrations of resveratrol that are added\nto stored blood may positively contribute to\nthe shelf life of stored RBCs. However, the\ndose of resveratrol that should be added to\nstored blood or RBCs must be adjusted ac-\ncordingly. More detailed studies are required\nto determine the mechanism by which sero-\ntonin increases the susceptibility to\noxidation.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe Authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by the Department of\nBiochemistry, Yuzuncu Yil University, Faculty\nof Medicine.\nReferences\n1.
