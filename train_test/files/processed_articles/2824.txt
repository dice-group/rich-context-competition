This paper sys-\ntematically documents the cyclical properties of these moments of the cross-section of firms.\nUsing the balance sheet data set of Deutsche Bundesbank (USTAN) \u00ad a private sector, annual,\nsections of the panel have over 30,000 firms per year on average \u00ad, we show that the cross-\nsectional standard deviations of the firm-level innovations in the Solow residual, value added\nand employment are robustly and significantly countercyclical, as measured by the contempo-\nraneous correlation with the cyclical component of aggregate output. In contrast, the cross-\nsectional standard deviation of firm-level investment rates is robustly and significantly pro-\ncyclical. These results hold when different filtering methods are used, as well as the cross-\nsectional interquartile range as a measure of dispersion. They are also robust to using cyclical\nindicators other than aggregate output and to various changes in the sample selection criteria.\nFigure 1 illustrates these two new business cycle facts (see Appendix A.5 for a time series graph\nof the investment rate dispersion):\nFigure 1: Cross-sectional Dispersion of Firm-Level Investment Rates and Solow Residual Inno-\nvations\nCyclical Component of GDP - HP(100)\nInvestment Dispersion\nCyclical Component of GDP - HP(100)\nSolow Residual Change Dispersion\nIt is clear that this finding is incompatible with a simple frictionless model of the firm with\nex ante homogeneous firms, as the latter would imply that the stochastic properties of the driv-\ning force \u00ad in this case dispersion in the innovations to firm-level Solow residuals \u00ad are at least\nqualitatively inherited by the outcome variables. Indeed, we show that such a model would\nlead to a counterfactual correlation of -0.54 between investment dispersion and aggregate out-\nput, compared to 0.45 in the data. We propose a heterogenous-firm RBC model with persistent\nidiosyncratic productivity shocks and lumpy capital adjustment to explain both qualitatively\nand quantitatively the procyclicality of investment dispersion, even in the presence of coun-\ntercyclical second-moment shocks in the driving force. The basic intuition, why lumpy capital\nadjustment is at least qualitatively a suitable candidate to explain this fact, can be glanced from\nthe simple Ss-model in Caplin and Spulber (1987):\nProposition:\nIn a one-sided Ss-model a la Caplin and Spulber in steady state with a uniform gap- distri-\nbution, fixed optimal adjustment policy S - s and shock z > 0, the variance of adjustments is\nincreasing in z if and only if the fraction of adjusters is smaller than 0.5.\nProof:\nAs is well known, average adjustment in this environment is z. From this, it follows that\nthe variance of adjustment is given by: (0-z)2 1- z\nS-s\n+ (S -s)-z 2 z\nS-s\n= z(S -s -z),\nwhich is increasing in z if and only if z\nS-s\nS-s\nis the fraction of adjusters.\nThis example shows that with sufficient inertia the comovement of the extensive margin\nwith the cycle leads to a procyclical dispersion of adjustment, as in this simple model all the\ndynamics are driven by the extensive margin. The intensive margin of adjustment, S-s, is fixed\nby assumption. We will show that in a more realistic model a positive extensive margin effect is\nstill operative and can explain the observed procyclicality of investment dispersion.\nFigure 2 displays sectoral variation that provides further suggestive evidence for this mech-\nanism. It plots two correlation coefficients for the six one-digit sectors we observe in the USTAN\ndatabase against each other. On the x-axis it displays the correlation coefficients of investment\nrate dispersion with the cyclical component of its own sectoral output. On the y-axis it displays\nthe correlation coefficients of the fraction of adjusters with these same output measures.1 The\nplot shows that there is a positive association between the procyclicality of investment disper-\nsion and the procyclicality of the extensive margin. Incidentally, the contemporaneous cor-\nrelation between the extensive margin and output for the aggregate USTAN data set is 0.73, a\nnumber even higher than for investment rate dispersion.\n1Using the convention of Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006), we define investing firms as those with annual invest-\nment rates of absolute value larger than 1%.\nFigure 2: Sectoral Variation in the Procyclicality of the Extensive Margin and Investment Rate\nDispersion\nNotes: AGR: Agriculture; MIN: Mining & Energy; MAN: Manufacturing; CON: Construction; TRD: Trade (Retail &\nWholesale); TRA: Transportation & Communication. HP(100)-Y refers to the cyclical component of the output\nof the corresponding sector. Both investment dispersion and the fraction of adjusters are linearly detrended.\nWe find more suggestive evidence that it is most likely lumpy capital adjustment that is gen-\nerating this result: 1) we show that in a sector like manufacturing (see again Figure 2, left panel),\nwhere we would expect non-convex factor adjustment to be most prevalent, procyclicality of in-\nvestment dispersion is particularly pronounced, even though the driving force is most starkly\ncountercyclically disperse in this sector; 2) we also show that for smaller firms, i.e. firms that\nare likely incapable of outgrowing adjustment costs, investment dispersion is significantly more\nprocyclical than for the largest firms. In contrast, conditional on firm size, finance variables\ndo not seem to have a large impact on the cyclicality of investment dispersion. We conclude\nfrom this that the explanation does not lie in a financial friction. We also find no evidence of\na composition effect in the sense that some large sectors or large firms have actually procycli-\ncal second-moment shocks that make the overall investment dispersion likewise procyclical. 3)\nFinally, we find that the dispersion of investment rates is countercyclical \u00ad -0.549 \u00ad just like the\ndriving force, once we condition on large and lumpy investments as defined by a 20%-threshold\n(see Cooper and Haltiwanger, 2006), in order to measure the dispersion of the intensive margin.\nThis is further evidence that the procyclicality of the unconditional investment rate dispersion\nis driven by movements in the extensive margin.\nWhy is this important? First, in our view explaining the business cycle dynamics of the\nhigher cross-sectional moments of the underlying macroeconomic aggregates is just as impor-\ntant for our understanding of the business cycle as explaining these aggregates themselves. A\nfully fledged business cycle theory has to speak to these cross-sectional dynamics as well. This\npaper systematically documents the relevant facts and explains the most striking of them: pro-\ncyclical investment dispersion in the presence of countercyclical second-moment shocks (see\nFigure 1 and Table 3 in Section 2.2). Secondly, heterogenous-firm models have seen increased\nuse both in the macroeconomic as well as international finance literature. We show in this pa-\nper that cross-sectional dynamics impose tight restrictions on structural parameters as well as\non the nature and stochastic properties of the driving forces in these models.2 For instance, we\nshow that procyclical investment dispersion \u00ad generated by a procyclical extensive margin effect\nas in the above proposition \u00ad requires a large capital-curvature of the revenue function of the\nfirm, for this procyclical extensive margin effect to be strong enough in the presence of coun-\ntercyclical second-moment shocks. Only with a large capital-curvature rely firms mostly on the\nextensive margin for their capital adjustment (see Gourio and Kashyap (2007) for a related ob-\nservation). We also document that the volatility of the countercyclical second-moment shocks\nmust not be too strong to be compatible with procyclical investment dispersion. In particular,\ncountercyclical second-moment shocks as large as suggested by Bloom (2009) and Bloom et al.\n(2009) and large enough to generate interesting business cycle dynamics are incompatible with\nthis cross-sectional business cycle fact. That means cross-sectional dynamics have also strong\nimplications for the nature of aggregate dynamics.\nRelated Literature\nThe empirical part of this paper, section 2, is most closely related to a series of papers by\nCompustat data, study empirically the cyclicality of the standard deviation, skewness and kur-\ntosis of the sales growth rate distribution and find them to be countercyclical, countercyclical\nand procyclical, respectively. Higson and Holly et al. (2004) repeat this analysis for UK data on\nquoted firms, and Doepke and Holly et al. (2005) for Germany, using the USTAN database, with\nsimilar findings. Doepke and Weber (2006) study, again using USTAN data, the cyclicality of\ntransitions between sales growth regimes in firm-level data. In contrast to these papers, we fo-\ncus on the cyclicality of cross-sectional second moments only, but include value added, Solow\nresiduals, investment rates and employment change rates into the analysis.3 The quantitative-\n2Khan and Thomas (2005), in an earlier version of their 2008-paper, make a similar observation on the impor-\ntance of general equilibrium in understanding cross-sectional firm dynamics. We confirm their conjecture here.\n3Holly and Santoro (2008) as well as Doepke and Holly et al. (2008) start from the aforementioned empirical\ntheoretical part of this paper \u00ad sections 3, 4 and 5 \u00ad draws heavily on the recent literature\non heterogenous-firm RBC models, developed in Khan and Thomas (2008), Bachmann et al.\nwork is related to the work by Eisfeldt and Rampini (2005), who show that capital reallocation\nis procyclical and explain this in a two-sector model with costly capital reallocation.\n2 The Facts\nIn Section 2.1 we briefly describe the USTAN data set and the main sample selection criteria\nwe use. Details are relegated to Appendix A.1. In Section 2.2 we present the baseline facts: the\ncontemporaneous correlations of cyclical aggregate output and the cross-sectional standard\ndeviations of firm-level Solow residual and real value added innovations as well as employment\nchange rates are negative, while the contemporaneous correlation of cyclical aggregate output\nand the cross-sectional standard deviation of firm-level investment rates is positive. In Sec-\ntion 2.4 we perform extensive robustness checks and also show, how these facts depend on\nobservable firm characteristics.\n2.1 A Brief Data Description\nUSTAN is a large annual firm-level balance sheet data base (Unternehmensbilanzstatistik) col-\nlected by Deutsche Bundesbank. It is unique in its combination of size and coverage as well as\ndetail of available variables. It provides annual firm level data from 1971 to 1998 from the bal-\nance sheets and the profit and loss accounts of over 60,000 firms per year (see Stoess (2001),\nvon Kalckreuth (2003) and Doepke et al. (2005) for further details). In the days when the dis-\ncounting of commercial bills were one of the principal instruments of German monetary policy,\nBundesbank law required the Bundesbank to assess the creditworthiness of all parties backing\na commercial bill put up for discounting. The Bundesbank implemented this regulation by re-\nquiring balance sheet data of all parties involved. These balance sheet data were then archived\nand collected into a database.\nAlthough the sampling design \u00ad one's commercial bill being put up for discounting \u00ad does\nnot lead to a representative selection of firms in a statistical sense, the coverage of the sample\nis very broad. USTAN covers incorporated firms as well as privately-owned companies, which\nwork and explore them in a monopolistically competitive model with financial frictions \u00ad the former \u00ad and in a\nmonopolistically competitive model with simple Calvo-type price-stickiness \u00ad the latter.\ndistinguishes it positively from Compustat data.4 Its sectoral coverage \u00ad while still somewhat\nbiased to manufacturing firms \u00ad includes the construction, the service as well as the primary\nsectors. This makes it different from, for instance, the Annual Survey of Manufacturing (ASM)\nin the U.S.5 The following table 1 displays the sectoral coverage of our final baseline sample.\n1-digit Sector Firm-year observations Percentage\nMoreover, while there remains a bias to somewhat larger and financially healthier firms, the\nsize coverage is still fairly broad: 31% of all firms in our final baseline sample have less than\n20 employees and 57% have less than 50 employees (see Table 21 in Appendix A.1 for details).\nFinally, the Bundesbank itself frequently used the USTAN data for its macroeconomic analyses\nand for cross-checking national accounting data. We take this as an indication that the bank\nconsiders the data as sufficiently representative and of sufficiently high quality. This makes the\nUSTAN data an exceptionally suitable data source for the study of cross-sectional business cycle\ndynamics.\n2.1.2 Selection of the Baseline Sample\nFrom the original USTAN data, we select only firms that report complete information on payroll,\ngross value added and capital stocks. Moreover, we drop observations from East German firms\nto avoid a break of the series in 1990. In addition, we remove observations that stem from\nirregular accounting statements, e.g. when filing for bankruptcy or when closing operations.\nWe deflate all but the capital and investment data by the implicit deflator for gross value added\nfrom the German national accounts.\nCapital is deflated with one-digit sector- and capital-good specific investment good price\ndeflators within a perpetual inventory method. Even though USTAN data can be considered as\nparticularly high quality data, we cannot directly use capital stocks as reported. Tax motivated\n4Davis et al. (2006) show that studying only publicly traded firms can lead to wrong conclusions, in particular\nwhen higher cross-sectional moments are concerned. See Appendix A.1 Table 23 for ownership coverage in our\nfinal sample.\n5An additional advantage of these data is easy access: while access is on-site, it is practically free for researchers,\nso that results derived from this data base can be easily tested and checked.\ndepreciation and price developments of capital goods lead to a general understatement of the\nstock of capital a firm holds. Thus, capital stocks have to be recalculated using a perpetual\ninventory method (see Appendix A.2, for details). Similarly, we recover the amount of labor\ninputs from wage bills, as information on the number of employees (as opposed to payroll data)\nis only updated infrequently for some companies (see Appendix A.3, for details). Finally, the\nfirm-level Solow residual is calculated from data on gross value added and factor inputs.\nWe remove outliers according to the following procedure: we calculate log changes in real\ngross value added, the Solow residual, real capital and employment, as well as the firm-level in-\nvestment rate and drop all observations where a change falls outside a three standard deviations\ninterval around the year-specific mean.6 We also drop those firms for which we do not have at\nleast five observations in first differences. This leaves us with a sample of 854,105 firm-year\nobservations, which corresponds to observations on 72,853 firms, i.e. the average observation\nlength of a firm in the sample is 11.7 years. The average number of firms in the cross-section\nper year is 32,850. We perform numerous robustness checks with respect to each of the selec-\ntion criteria and measurement choices: we use sectoral deflators for value added, an aggregate\ninvestment good price deflator, change the cut-off rule to 2.5, 5 and 10 standard deviations and\nleave all firms in the sample with two and twenty observations in first differences, respectively.\nNone of these choices change our baseline results.7\n2.1.3 Calculating the Solow Residual and Factor Adjustments\nWe compute the firm-level Solow residual based on the following Cobb-Douglas production\nfunction in accordance with our model:\nyi,t = zt i,t k\ni,t\nn\ni,t\n,\nwhere i,t is firm-specific productivity, and zt is aggregate productivity. We assume that\nlabor input ni,t is immediately productive, whereas capital ki,t is pre-determined and inherited\nfrom last period. In our main specification, we estimate the output elasticities of the production\nfactors,  and , as median shares of factor expenditures over gross value added within each\nindustry.8\nFor factor adjustment, we use the symmetric adjustment rate definition proposed in Davis\net al. (1996). We thus define firm-level investment rates as ii,t\n9 and firm-level em-\n6This outlier removal is done after removing firm and sectoral fixed effects. Centering the outlier removal\naround the year mean is important to avoid artificial and countercyclical skewness of the respective distributions.\n7See Appendix B for details. There we also discuss briefly the issue of sample selection.\n8To check the robustness of our results, we try alternative specifications with predefined elasticities common\nacross sectors. We also change the timing assumption to include a predetermined employment stock, as well as\nimmediate adjustment in both factors. All results are very robust to the various ways of generating the firm-specific\nSolow residual (for a detailed discussion, see Bachmann and Bayer, 2009).\n9Appendix A.1 compares the USTAN aggregate and manufacturing investment rate histogram with the U.S. one\nployment adjustment rates as ni,t\n.10 We use log-differences in the Solow residual to\ncapture Solow residual innovations, as the persistence of firm-level Solow residuals exhibits\nbehavior close to a unit root. We remove firm fixed and sectoral-year11 effects from these first-\ndifference variables to focus on idiosyncratic fluctuations that do not capture differences in\nsectoral responses to aggregate shocks or permanent ex-ante heterogeneity between firms.\nWhen combining this micro data with aggregate data, we have to take a stance on what sectoral\naggregate we view as the empirical counterpart to our model. We chose to include firms from\nthe following six sectors in our analysis: agriculture, mining and energy, manufacturing, con-\nstruction, trade (both retail and wholesale) as well as the transportation and communication\nsector. This aggregate can be roughly characterized as the non-financial private business sector\nin Germany. Whenever we use the term aggregate in the following, we mean this sector.\nGerman national accounting data per one-digit sector (see Appendix A.1 for a detailed de-\nscription of the data sources used) allow us to compute real value added, investment, capital\nand employment data for this sectoral aggregate, and therefore also an aggregate Solow resid-\nual. Our USTAN sample captures on average 70% of sectoral value added, 44% of sectoral in-\nvestment, 71% of its capital stock and 49% of sectoral employment.12\nIn addition to representing a large part of the non-financial private business sector in Ger-\nmany, USTAN also represents its cyclical behavior very well, as the following Table 2 shows:13\nCross-sectional Moment (\u00b7,HP(100)-Y )\nmean( ii,t\nmean( ni,t\nNotes:\n: correlation coefficient.\nHP()-Y : Cyclical component of GDP after HP-filtering using smoothing parameter .\nmean: cross-sectional average, linearly detrended.\nfrom the Longitudinal Research Database, LRD. The similarities are remarkable, which suggests the generalizability\nof our results also to the U.S.\n10The baseline within-transformed cross-sectional dispersion data for factor adjustments can be found in Ta-\n11The sectoral fixed effects are essentially computed at the 2-digit level, see Table 20 in Appendix A.1 for details.\n12The sectoral aggregate, in turn, captures 59% of real aggregate value added, 39% of aggregate investment, 26%\nof aggregate capital and 65% of aggregate employment.\n13We further document the good representation properties of USTAN in Appendix A.1.\nThe following Table 3 presents the main new stylized facts about the cross-sectional dynamics\nof firms. Firm-level investment rates display procyclical dispersion, whereas the cross-sectional\nstandard deviations of the (log)-changes in Solow residuals, output and employment are coun-\ntercyclical.\nCross-sectional Moment (\u00b7,HP(100)-Y ) 5% 95% Frac. w. opposite sign\n( ii,t\n( ni,t\nNotes:\n: cross-sectional standard deviation, linearly detrended.\nThe columns 5% and 95% refer to the top and bottom 5-percentiles in a parametric bootstrap of the correlation\ncoefficient. The last column displays the fraction of simulations with the opposite sign of the point estimate. See\nfurther notes to Table 2.\nThe first column of Table 3 shows the contemporaneous correlation of the cyclical com-\nponent of aggregate output14 with the cross-sectional standard deviations of the firm-level in-\nvestment rates, the percentage changes in the firm-level Solow residual and real value added\nas well as employment changes. The first is clearly procyclical, the latter three countercyclical.\nThe next two columns show the 5% and 95% confidence bands from 10,000 parametric boot-\nstrap simulations.15 The last column displays the fraction of negative correlations for the stan-\ndard deviation of the firm-level investment rates, and the fraction of positive correlations for\nthe remaining three standard deviations in these bootstrap simulations. These three columns\ntogether show that the sign of all correlations is significant. In the following, we show that find-\ning a procyclical investment rate dispersion is robust to the specific choices we have made in\ncalculating the numbers in Table 3.\nTable 4 shows that procyclical investment dispersion is robust to the choice of the cyclical indi-\ncator.16 The result stands irrespective of whether we choose as cyclical indicators output filtered\n14For the baseline scenario we use log-output with an HP-parameter 100.\n15We use a pairwise unrestricted VAR with one lag as the parametric model. The results from a nonparametric\noverlapping block bootstrap with a block size of four are similar to the parametric bootstrap.\n16This is also true for the three other variables, and for (log i,t ) and (log yi,t ), we have documented this\nand other robustness tests elsewhere: Bachmann and Bayer (2009).\nCyclical Indicator (( ii,t\n),\u00b7)\nmean( ii,t\nNotes: See notes to Tables 2 and 3. I refers to aggregate investment, N to aggregate employment.\nusing a smaller smoothing parameter for the HP filter, following Ravn and Uhlig (2002), apply a\nlog-difference filter to output, or use the linearly detrended average cross-sectional investment\nrate, or the HP(100)-filtered aggregate investment, employment or aggregate Solow residuals.\nCross-sectional Moment (\u00b7,HP(100)-Y )\nIQR( ii,t\n( ii,t\n( ii,t\n( ii,t\n( ii,t\n( ii,t\n( ii,t\nNotes: See notes to Tables 2 and 3. IQR stands for interquartile range, which is linearly detrended.\nVice versa, our finding is also robust to the choices we have made for the other part of the\ncorrelation, see Table 5. One can use the interquartile range (IQR) as the dispersion measure,\nand one can study the firm level net percentage change in capital as opposed to the investment\nrate.17 Moreover, it is not the removal of firm-level and sectoral fixed effects that induces this\nprocyclicality, as row three of this table shows. The next three rows show that the choice of\n17This variable has the advantage that it corresponds to the percentage innovations in the stock of capital. We\ncan use a permanent-transitory decomposition to separate measurement error from true innovations to the capital\nstock. The resulting correlation coefficient of the standard deviation of these purified innovations with the cycle is\n0.449, and thus the procyclicality of the dispersion of capital innovations is not driven by measurement error.\na linear trend for investment rate dispersion is conservative: using quadratic detrending and\nespecially an HP-filter makes the procyclicality much stronger. This holds nearly uniformly for\nall the other variations and robustness checks as well as the significance numbers in Table 3.\nFinally, the last two rows demonstrate that the result is neither driven alone by the German\nreunification, nor by the strong recession in 1975.\nTables 6 and 7 show how the cyclicality of cross-sectional investment dispersion manifests\nitself across sectors and firm sizes. For the sectoral numbers we use the cross-sectional stan-\ndard deviation of the firm-level investment rate and the HP(100)-filtered log-output of the cor-\nresponding sectors as inputs into the correlation measure. For the firm size numbers we use\nHP(100)-filtered log-output from the sectoral aggregate.\n1-digit Sector (( ii,t\nNotes: See notes to Tables 2 and 3. See Figure 2 for the sectoral acronyms.\nTable 6 shows that procyclicality of investment dispersion is strongly prevalent in the goods-\nproducing sectors, in particular manufacturing. The trade sector exhibits a smaller effect, whereas\nin the primary sectors investment dispersion is nearly acyclical or weakly countercyclical.18 To\nput these findings in perspective, we also display the cyclicality of the cross-sectional innovations-\nto-Solow-residual dispersion, which \u00ad despite the procyclicality of investment dispersion \u00ad is\nstrongly countercyclical in the manufacturing and trade sectors. To sum up: manufacturing,\na sector where nonconvex adjustment technologies can be expected to be most prevalent, has\nboth the strongest countercyclically disperse driving force and the strongest procyclicality of\ninvestment dispersion.\nAs Table 7 shows, procyclicality of investment dispersion is driven mainly by the smaller\nfirms, especially when size is measured by employment or value added. Large firms, in contrast,\ndisplay only weakly procyclical to acyclical investment dispersion. This distinction is significant\nin the sense that at least if size is measured in terms of employment or value added, neither the\n18Had we used the sectoral aggregate instead of own sector output as cyclical indicator, the results would be by\nand large the same, except that the procyclicality of investment dispersion in the trade sector would more than\ndouble with only half the countercylicality in the dispersion of the driving force.\nSize Class / Criterion Employment Value Added Capital\npoint estimate for the smallest size class lies in the [5%,95%]-bands of the largest size class nor\nFinally, the last Table 8 shows that conditional on firm size \u00ad as measured by capital \u00ad the\nfinancial situation of a firm \u00ad as measured by the equity-asset-ratio \u00ad hardly matters for the\ncyclicality of investment dispersion:\nEquity-Asset-Ratio Tercile Smallest 95% - Capital Largest 5% - Capital\nTables 6 to 8 together with the finding that the Solow residual processes for small and large\nfirms hardly differ both on average over time and in terms of cyclicality of their innovations,20 at\nleast suggests that the friction necessary to explain the differential cyclicality of the dispersions\nof firm-level innovations-to-Solow-residual and investment rates, respectively, can neither be\nfound in financial constraints nor principally in different shock processes. It also does not ap-\npear to be driven by certain sectors and large firms. We relegate a discussion of potential cyclical\nsample selection to Appendix B and show there that it is not an issue.\nInstead, we show in this paper that the presence of lumpy capital adjustment is a plausible\ncause for this aspect of the cross-sectional firm dynamics. Indeed, the fact that procyclical in-\nvestment dispersion is mostly prevalent in the manufacturing sector as well as in smaller firms,\ni.e. firms where we would a priori expect non-convexities in the adjustment technology to be\nmost relevant, is at least consistent with our explanation.\n19See Appendix A.1 for detailed information on the size distribution of firms in our sample.\n20See Bachmann and Bayer (2009) for an in-depth discussion of this fact.\nOther Data Sources\nNaturally the question arises whether it is specific to the German data used that we find\nthe dispersion of investment rates to be procyclical. To asses this we compare to data from\nthe UK DTI-database and to Compustat data from the US. The UK data comprises 10,966 firm-\nyear observations after removal of outliers and constraining the sample to firms with at least 5\nobservations, applying the same criteria as for the USTAN data. The UK data covers the period\n1977-1990 and stems from a representative sample of firms (but over-sampling large firms) in\nthe manufacturing and some selected non-financial service sectors in Britain.

The results are much in line with our\nfindings for the USTAN data: For the UK data set, which comprises a larger fraction of smaller\nfirms, we find a robust positive correlation of the dispersion of investment rates with the cycle,\nirrespective of how we measure dispersion and cycle.\nFor the Compustat sample, we find a lower (though positive) correlation of the investment\nrate dispersion with the cycle. This reflects that, in contrast to both the DTI data base and\nthe USTAN data, Compustat covers only large, publicly traded companies. The firms in the\nCompustat sample are typically larger than even the top 5% largest firms in the USTAN data\nand we have seen for the USTAN data that for larger firms the correlation coefficient drops.21\nCyclical Indicator   iit\n)\n,\u00b7  IQR iit\n)\n,\u00b7\nNotes: Aggregate output data, Y , for the US refers to real gross value added in the non-financial private business\nsector. For the UK we use aggregate real gross-value-added instead, as the corresponding sectoral data is not\npublicly available for the corresponding time period. Dispersion measures are linearly de-trended.\n21All results are robust to alternative detrending methods for the dispersion of investment rates such as fitting\nquadratic or cubic time-trends or HP-filtering. Results are available upon request.\n2.4 The Extensive Margin\nAs we have argued in the Introduction, the mechanism by which the model generates a pro-\ncyclical dispersion of investment rates is the procyclicality of the extensive margin of invest-\nment. Table 10 provides direct evidence on this. It displays the numbers for Figure 2 in the\nintroduction as well as some robustness. The aggregate features strong procyclicality of the ex-\ntensive margin,22 as does the manufacturing sector. The service sectors have a middle place,\nwhereas the primary sectors by and large display low and non-robust or zero procyclicality of\nthe extensive margin. For the construction sector the results are somewhat mixed, but overall\nstill show procyclicality.\nNotes: See notes to Tables 2 and 3. See Figure 2 for the sectoral acronyms. The fraction of adjusters (Frac. of adj.) is\ndefined as firms with an investment rate of: | ii,t\n| > 0.01. The fraction of lumpy adjusters (Frac. of lumpy\nadj.) is defined as firms with an investment rate of: | ii,t\nrefers to the cyclical component of aggregate output in the first row, thereafter to the output of the corresponding\nsector.\n3 The Model\nIn this section we describe our model economy. We start with the firm's problem, followed by\na brief description of the households and the definition of equilibrium. We conclude with a\nsketch of the equilibrium computation. We follow closely Khan and Thomas (2008) and Bach-\nmann et al. (2008). Since the model set up is discussed in detail there, we will be rather brief\nhere.\nThe main departure from either papers is the introduction of a second exogenous aggregate\nstate, the standard deviation of the distribution of idiosyncratic productivity shocks tomorrow,\n( ). The motivation for this is both realism, as we find these second-moment shocks in the\ndata, but also conservatism: we will show in Section 5.1 that without countercyclical second-\nmoment shocks the investment rate dispersion is very procyclical, more so than in the data,\neven with very small fixed costs to adjustment. This comes as no surprise, as without counter-\ncyclical second-moment shocks there is no countervailing force that would undo the extensive\nmargin effect that in turn causes the investment rate dispersion to be procyclical. Thus, since\nthis is a quantitative exercise using the correct amount of second-moment volatility and coun-\ntercyclicality in the driving force is important. Following Khan and Thomas (2008), we approxi-\nmate this now bivariate aggregate state process with a discrete Markov chain.\nThe economy consists of a unit mass of small firms. We do not model entry and exit decisions.\nThere is one commodity in the economy that can be consumed or invested. Each firm produces\nthis commodity, employing its pre-determined capital stock (k) and labor (n), according to the\nfollowing Cobb-Douglas decreasing-returns-to-scale production function ( > 0,  > 0,  + <\ny = z kn, (1)\nwhere z and denote aggregate and firm-specific (idiosyncratic) technology, respectively.\nThe idiosyncratic technology process has autocorrelation I . It follows a Markov chain,\nwhose transition matrix depends on the aggregate state of its time-varying standard deviation,\n( ). In contrast, its support is independent of the aggregate state. To also capture observed\nexcess kurtosis in the idiosyncratic productivity shocks, we use a mixture of two Gaussian dis-\ntributions in the Tauchen-approximation algorithm instead of the usual normal distribution.23\nWe denote the trend growth rate of aggregate productivity by (1-)(-1), so that aggregate y\nand k grow at rate -1 along the balanced growth path. From now on we work with k and y (and\nlater C) in efficiency units. The linearly detrended logarithm of aggregate productivity levels as\nwell as linearly detrended ( ) evolve according to a VAR(1) process, with normal innovations v\nthat have zero mean and covariance :\nlogz\n( )- \u00af\n( )\n= A\nlogz\n( )- \u00af\n( )\nwhere \u00af\n( ) denotes the steady state standard deviation of idiosyncratic productivity inno-\n24Specifying this process in terms of log ( ) , in order to avoid negativity of the standard deviation of idiosyn-\nProductivity innovations at different aggregation levels are independent. Also, idiosyncratic\nproductivity shocks are independent across productive units. In contrast, we do not impose\nany restrictions on  or A  R2\u00d72.\nEach period a firms draws from a time-invariant distribution, G, its current cost of capital\nadjustment,   0, which is denominated in units of labor. G is a uniform distribution on [0, \u00af\n],\ncommon to all firms. Draws are independent across firms and over time, and employment is\nfreely adjustable.\nAt the beginning of a period, a firm is characterized by its pre-determined capital stock, its\nidiosyncratic productivity, and its capital adjustment cost. Given this and the aggregate state,\nit decides its employment level, n, production and depreciation occurs, workers are paid, and\ninvestment decisions are made. Then the period ends.\nUpon investment, i, the firm incurs a fixed cost of , where  is the current real wage rate.\nCapital depreciates at rate . We can then summarize the evolution of the firm's capital stock\n(in efficiency units) between two consecutive periods, from k to k , as follows:\nFixed cost paid k\nGiven the i.i.d. nature of the adjustment costs, it is sufficient to describe differences across\nfirms and their evolution by the distribution of firms over ( ,k). We denote this distribution by\n\u00b5. Thus, z,( ),\u00b5 constitutes the current aggregate state and \u00b5 evolves according to the law\nof motion \u00b5 = (z,( ),\u00b5), which firms take as given.\nNext we describe the dynamic programming problem of each firm. We will take two short-\ncuts (details can be found in Khan and Thomas, 2008). First, we state the problem in terms of\nutils of the representative household (rather than physical units), and denote by p = p(z,( ),\u00b5)\nthe marginal utility of consumption. Second, given the i.i.d. nature of the adjustment costs,\ncontinuation values can be expressed without explicitly taking into account future adjustment\ncosts.\nLet V 1( ,k,;z,( ),\u00b5) denote the expected discounted value--in utils--of a firm that is in\nidiosyncratic state ( ,k,), given the aggregate state (z,( ),\u00b5). Then the expected value prior\nto the realization of the adjustment cost draw is given by:\nV 0( ,k;z,( ),\u00b5) =\n\u00af\n\nV 1( ,k,;z,( ),\u00b5)G(d). (3)\ncratic productivity shocks is \u00ad given its high steady state value and relatively low variability (see Bachmann and\nBayer, 2009) \u00ad an unnecessary precaution that does not change the results.\nWith this notation the dynamic programming problem is given by:\nV 1( ,k,;z,( ),\u00b5) = max\nn\n{CF+max(Vno adj,max\nk\n[-AC+Vadj])}, (4)\nwhere CF denotes the firm's flow value, Vno adj the firm's continuation value if it chooses inaction\nand does not adjust, and Vadj the continuation value, net of adjustment costs AC, if the firm\nadjusts its capital stock. That is:\nCF = [z kn -(z,( ),\u00b5)n]p(z,( ),\u00b5), (5a)\nVno adj = E[V 0( ,(1-)k/;z ,( ),\u00b5 )], (5b)\nAC = (z,( ),\u00b5)p(z,( ),\u00b5), (5c)\nVadj = -ip(z,( ),\u00b5)+E[V 0( ,k ;z ,( ),\u00b5 )], (5d)\nwhere both expectation operators average over next period's realizations of the aggregate and\nidiosyncratic productivity states, conditional on this period's values, and we recall that i = k -\n(1-)k. Also,  denotes the discount factor of the representative household.\nTaking as given prices (z,( ),\u00b5) and p(z,( ),\u00b5), and the law of motion \u00b5 = (z,( ),\u00b5),\nthe firm chooses optimally labor demand, whether to adjust its capital stock at the end of the\nperiod, and the optimal capital stock, conditional on adjustment. This leads to policy functions:\nN = N( ,k;z,( ),\u00b5) and K = K ( ,k,;z,( ),\u00b5). Since capital is pre-determined, the optimal\nemployment decision is independent of the current adjustment cost draw.\nWe assume a continuum of identical households that have access to a complete set of state-\ncontingent claims. Hence, there is no heterogeneity across households. Moreover, they own\nshares in the firms and are paid dividends. We do not need to model the household side in\ndetail (see Khan and Thomas (2008) for the details), and concentrate instead on the first-order\nconditions to determine the equilibrium wage and the marginal utility of consumption.\nHouseholds have a standard felicity function in consumption and (indivisible) labor:\nU(C,Nh) = logC - ANh, (6)\nwhere C denotes consumption and Nh the household's labor supply. Households maximize the\nexpected present discounted value of the above felicity function. By definition we have:\np(z,( ),\u00b5) UC (C,Nh) =\nC(z,( ),\u00b5)\nand from the intratemporal first-order condition:\n(z,( ),\u00b5) = -\nUN (C,Nh)\np(z,( ),\u00b5)\n=\nA\np(z,( ),\u00b5)\n3.3 Recursive Equilibrium\nA recursive competitive equilibrium for this economy is a set of functions\n,p,V 1,N,K ,C,Nh, ,\nthat satisfy\n1. Firm optimality: Taking , p and  as given, V 1( ,k;z,( ),\u00b5) solves (4) and the corre-\nsponding policy functions are N( ,k;z,( ),\u00b5) and K ( ,k,;z,( ),\u00b5).\n2. Household optimality: Taking  and p as given, the household's consumption and labor\nsupply satisfy (7) and (8).\n3. Commodity market clearing:\nC(z,( ),\u00b5) = z kN( ,k;z,( ),\u00b5)d\u00b5 -\n\u00af\n\n[K ( ,k,;z,( ),\u00b5)-(1-)k]dGd\u00b5.\n4. Labor market clearing:\nNh(z,( ),\u00b5) = N( ,k;z,( ),\u00b5)d\u00b5 +\n\u00af\n\nJ K ( ,k,;z,( ),\u00b5)-(1-)k dGd\u00b5,\nwhere J (x) = 0, if x = 0 and 1, otherwise.\n5. Model consistent dynamics: The evolution of the cross-section that characterizes the econ-\nomy, \u00b5 = (z,( ),\u00b5), is induced by K ( ,k,;z,( ),\u00b5) and the exogenous processes for\nz, ( ) as well as .\nConditions 1, 2, 3 and 4 define an equilibrium given , while step 5 specifies the equilibrium\ncondition for .\nAs is well-known, (4) is not computable, since \u00b5 is infinite dimensional. Hence, we follow\nKrusell and Smith (1997, 1998) and approximate the distribution \u00b5 by its first moment over\ncapital, and its evolution, , by a simple log-linear rule. In the same vein, we approximate the\nequilibrium pricing function by a log-linear rule, discrete aggregate state by discrete aggregate\nstate:\nlog \u00af\nk =ak z,( ) +bk z,( ) log \u00af\nlogp =ap z,( ) +bp z,( ) log \u00af\nwhere \u00af\nk denotes aggregate capital holdings. Given (8), we do not have to specify an equilibrium\nrule for the real wage. As usual with this procedure, we posit this form and check that in equi-\nlibrium it yields a good fit to the actual law of motion. In contrast to models without second\nmoment shocks, where it has been extensively shown that the first moment suffices, we show\nhere that the pure R2 goodness-of-fit metric does not perform as well anymore: R2 below 0.9\nare possible, as we shall see in Section 5.2. Nevertheless, Bachmann and Bayer (2009) show that\nthe aggregate dynamics of such an economy are hardly affected, when higher moments of the\ncapital distribution are included and the R2 are pushed closer to unity (see Bachmann et al.\n(2008) for a similar observation). We show here that also the cross-sectional dynamics are af-\nfected only to a small degree. And since we consistently find that not including higher moments\nleads to a slight underestimation of the procyclicality of investment dispersion, we prefer the\nincrease in computational speed and report our results, unless otherwise noted, with the first\nmoment only as a state variable.\nCombining these assumptions and substituting \u00af\nk for \u00b5 into (4) and using (9a)\u00ad(9b), we\nhave that (4) becomes a computable dynamic programming problem with policy functions\nN = N( ,k;z,( ), \u00af\nk) and K = K ( ,k,;z,( ), \u00af\nk). We solve this problem via value function\niteration on V 0.\nWith these policy functions, we can then simulate a model economy without imposing the\nequilibrium pricing rule (9b), but rather solve for it along the way. We simulate the model\neconomy for 1,600 time periods and discard the first 100 observations, when computing any\nstatistics. This procedure generates a time series of {pt } and {\u00af\nkt } endogenously, with which as-\nsumed rules (9a)\u00ad(9b) can be updated via a simple OLS regression. The procedure stops when\nthe updated coefficients ak z,( ) and bk z,( ) , as well as ap z,( ) and bp z,( ) are\nsufficiently close to the previous ones. We skip the details of this procedure, as this has been\n4 Calibration\nThe model period is a year \u00ad in congruence with the data frequency in USTAN. The following\nparameters have standard values:  = 0.98 and  = 0.094, which we compute from German\nnational accounting data for the sectoral aggregate that the USTAN sample corresponds to: the\nnon-financial private business sector. Given this depreciation rate, we pick  = 1.014, in order to\nmatch the time-average aggregate investment rate of 0.108. This number is also consistent with\nGerman long-run growth rates. The log-felicity function features an elasticity of intertemporal\nsubstitution (EIS) of one. The disutility of work parameter, A, is chosen to generate an average\ntime spent at work of 0.33: A = 2 for the baseline calibration.\nwhich correspond to the measured median labor and capital shares in manufacturing in the\nUSTAN data base (see Appendix A.4). While our data also include a considerable amount of\nfirms from other sectors, any weighted average or median of these shares would still be close to\nthe manufacturing values, which is why we decided to use them in our baseline calibration. We\ndiscuss robustness to this parameter choice in Section 5.1 and Appendix A.4.25\nNext, we have to choose the parameters of the two-state aggregate shock process. Here we\nsimply estimate a bivariate, unrestricted VAR with the linearly detrended natural logarithm of\nthe aggregate Solow residual26 and the linearly detrended ( )-process from the USTAN data.27\nThe parameters of this VAR are as follows:28\nA =\n =\nThis process is discretized on a [5\u00d75]-grid, using a bivariate analog of Tauchen's procedure.\nWe measure the steady state standard deviation of idiosyncratic technology innovations as\n\u00af\nour time horizon \u00ad,29 and since the adjustment cost parameter \u00af\n will be identified by the kurto-\nsis of the firm-level investment rate (in addition to its skewness), we want to avoid attributing\n25If one views the DRTS assumption as a mere stand-in for a CRTS production function with monopolistic com-\npetition, than these choices would correspond to an employment elasticity of the underlying production function\n+\n= 1.31. Given the regulated product markets in Germany, this is a reasonable value.\nThe implied capital elasticity of the revenue function, \nis 0.47. Finally, model simulations show that using the\ncapital share as an estimate for the output elasticity of capital under the null hypothesis of the model leads to a\nsmall overestimation of the latter, which, as we will show in Section 5.1, leads to the the baseline calibration being\nconservative relative to the main result: procyclicality of investment dispersion.\n27After firm-level and sectoral fixed effects have been removed.\n28With a slight abuse of notation, but for the sake of readability,  displays standard deviations on the main\ndiagonal and correlations on the off diagonal.\n29We find no skewness.\nexcess kurtosis in the firm-level investment rate to nonlinearities in the adjustment technology,\nwhen the driving force itself has kurtosis. Hence, we incorporate the measured excess kurtosis\ninto the discretization process for the idiosyncratic technology state.30 Finally, we set I = 0.95,\nin accordance with the high persistence of Solow residual innovations we find in the data. This\nprocess is discretized on a 19-state-grid, using Tauchen's procedure with mixed Gaussian nor-\nGiven the aforementioned set of parameters ,,, A,,, A,, \u00af\n( ),I , we then calibrate\nthe adjustment costs parameter \u00af\n to minimize a quadratic form in the normalized differences\nbetween the time-average firm-level investment rate skewness produced by the model and the\ndata, as well as the time-average firm-level investment rate kurtosis:32\nmin\n\u00af\n\n(\u00af\nT t\nskewness(\nii,t\n)(\u00af\n+\nT t\nkur tosis(\nii,t\n)(\u00af\nAs can be seen from (11), the distribution of firm-level investment rates exhibits both sub-\nument a similar fact for U.S. manufacturing plants. They also argue that non-convex capital\nadjustment costs are an important ingredient to explain such a strongly non-Gaussian distribu-\ntion, given a close-to-Gaussian shock process. We therefore use the deviation from Gaussianity\nin firm-level investment rates to identify \u00af\n.\nThe following Table 11 demonstrates identification of \u00af\n, as cross-sectional skewness and\nkurtosis of the firm-level investment rates are both monotonically increasing in \u00af\n. The mini-\nmum of the distance measure  is achieved for \u00af\n = 0.3, our baseline case.33 This implies costs\nconditional on adjustment equivalent to 15.4% of annual firm-level output on average, which\nis well in line with estimates from the U.S. (see Bloom, 2009). A description of the aggregate\ndynamics of the baseline calibration is relegated to Appendix C.\n31The cross-sectional results do not change significantly with either an increase in the fineness of the aggregate\ngrid to [9\u00d79], nor with one in the idiosyncratic grid to a 35-state-grid.\n32The normalization constants in (11) are, respectively, the time series standard deviation of the investment rate\nskewness and the time series standard deviation of the investment rate kurtosis.\n33We searched over a finer grid of \u00af\n than displayed in the table, in order to find the optimal \u00af\n.\n\n\u00af\n Skewness Kurtosis (\u00af\n) Adj. costs/\nUnit of Output\n5.1 Baseline Results\nCan a thus calibrated DSGE model with idiosyncratic productivity shocks, fixed adjustment\ncosts to capital and countercyclical innovations to the dispersion of firm-level Solow residuals\nreproduce the cyclicality of the cross-sectional dynamics observed in the data?\nTable 12 summarizes our main result numerically: in our baseline calibration the model\nmatches the procyclicality of firm-level investment rate dispersion as well as the extensive mar-\ngin reasonably well, even though it was calibrated to the steady state Non-Gaussianity of the\ninvestment rate distribution.34 We use HP(100)-filtered aggregate model output as the cyclical\nindicator.

By contrast, the frictionless case merely replicates the countercyclicality of the dis-\npersion of the driving force.\nMoreover, the second column of this table shows that without second moment shocks, a\nvery low level of non-convexity immediately generates procyclicality in investment dispersion\n\u00ad the gradient of procyclicality in the adjustment cost factor, \u00af\n, is extremely steep without coun-\ntercyclical second moment shocks.35 But it also makes the model overshoot this number con-\nsiderably. Thus, countercyclical second moment shocks are an important part in understanding\ncross-sectional firm dynamics, both in generating countercyclical dispersions of value and em-\nployment changes, but also to generate realistic procyclicality in investment dispersion. With-\nout them, it would simply be too easy to generate the latter. We view this as an important\nconfirmation of our calibration and our mechanism: in the presence of quantitatively real-\nistic countercyclicality of the dispersion of the driving force, it is a level of adjustment costs\nthat matches best the nonlinear average moments of the investment rate distribution that also\ngenerates about the right correlation coefficient between the standard deviation of investment\nrates and aggregate output. Table 13 shows that this identification is rather tight.\n35Notice that the proposition in the introduction suggests that for low enough adjustment cost parameters and\nfor an important enough role of the extensive margin we should expect countercylicality of investment rate dis-\npersion even without countercyclical second moment shocks.\nTable 14 illustrates how the procyclicality of the investment dispersion and the procyclical-\nity of the extensive margin interact with the curvature of the revenue function in capital.\n( ii,t\nNotes: See notes to Table 12. `Rev. Ela.' stands for the revenue elasticity of capital in a reduced form revenue\nfunction, after labor has been maximized out. It is given by \n. Using the convention of Cooper and Haltiwanger\n(2006), we define the fraction of adjusters as those firms that have annual investment rates of absolute value larger\nThe results in columns two and three refer to setups with factor elasticities  = 0.5333,  =\nline scenario.36 It is clear that larger revenue elasticities in capital after labor has been maxi-\nmized out, imply a lower procyclicality of the extensive margin and thus for the investment rate\ndispersion. Smaller revenue elasticities or higher curvature of the production function imply\nthat the intensive margin of investment becomes less flexible: the range of the optimal capital\nogy. To achieve the optimal path for aggregate investment, the extensive margin becomes more\nimportant for the firms, the higher the curvature of the revenue function. This effect of curva-\nture is well known and explained in detail in Gourio and Kashyap (2007).\nFinally, Table 15 shows the effect of general equilibrium on both the procyclicality of the\nextensive margin as well as the procyclicality of investment dispersion. Real wage and interest\nrate movements lead to aggregate coordination and therefore to procyclicality of the fraction of\nadjusters. This in turn increases the cyclical comovement of both the investment rate disper-\nsion, as the following Table 15 shows. As we have shown above, both quantities are strongly\nprocyclical in the data. We thus confirm the conjecture in Khan and Thomas (2005) that gen-\neral equilibrium price movements are important to quantitatively account for cross-sectional\nbusiness cycle dynamics.\nTo sum up, the extent of both, the procyclicality of investment dispersion as well as the\ncountercyclicality of the dispersion of firm-level Solow residual innovations, impose important\n36In a monopolistic competition framework, column two implies a scenario with a CRTS-one-third-two-third\nproduction function and a markup of 1.25, column three a markup of 1.20.

More generally, this makes the study of cross-\nsectional business cycle dynamics important for the structure and calibration of heterogenous-\nfirm models. We also confirm the conjecture in Khan and Thomas (2005) that general equilib-\nrium price movements are important to quantitatively account for the cross-sectional business\ncycle dynamics observed in the data.\nIn the following Table 16 we document robustness of our baseline result to some of the choices\nwe have made in the baseline calibration.\nScenario (( ii,t\nNotes: See notes to Table 12.\nIn order to check robustness of our results to a potential underestimation of the volatility\nof the countercyclical second-moment shock, we double (and quadruple) it, while keeping its\nsteady state value fixed at \u00af\n( ) = 0.1201. To this end, we rescale the ( )-process by a factor of\ntwo (four) when simulating the model. As expected, now the ability of the procyclical exten-\nsive margin effect to overcome the countercyclical second-moment shocks is limited, because\nthe latter fluctuates more. This drives down the correlation of the investment rate dispersion\nand the cyclical component of aggregate output to zero and approximately -0.3, respectively.\nNotice, however, that it is still the case that non-convexities in capital adjustment cause an ex-\ntensive margin effect that partially offsets the countercyclical second-moment shocks, as the\nfrictionless counterparts of these two high volatility specifications feature correlation coeffi-\ncients of investment dispersion with output of -0.551 and -0.535, respectively. But it is also clear\nfrom this exercise that the strongly procyclical investment dispersion that we find in the data\n\u00ad +0.451 \u00ad is at odds with the even more, eightfold as volatile countercyclical second-moment\nshocks proposed in Bloom (2009) and Bloom et al. (2009) as important drivers of the business\ncycle. Next, we check whether our unity CRRA is driving our result by increasing the CRRA to\n3. This leads to hardly any change.37 Furthermore, we check whether the result is sensitive to\nthe timing assumption about the revelation of the dispersion of the firm-level Solow residual\ninnovation. The baseline model assumes that ( i,t+1) is revealed today in t, concomitantly\nwith zt and t , aggregate and idiosyncratic technology, which means investors know about the\nactual productivity risk tomorrow at the time of the investment decision. There is another plau-\nsible timing assumption: only ( i,t ) is revealed today in t, and both zt and ( i,t ) predict\nthe dispersion of the firm-level Solow residual innovation tomorrow through persistence in the\nVAR in equation (10). As the fourth row shows, this increases somewhat the procyclicality of in-\nvestment dispersion, as the corresponding number from a frictionless model would be -0.3845,\ncompared to the -0.5432 in the frictionless counterpart of the baseline timing assumption. The\neffect through the countercyclical driving force in this case is simply more indirect. The next\nto last row shows that using a normalized calibration criterion, (\u00af\n), in (11) as opposed to, say,\nlog-deviations between model simulated skewness and kurtosis of investment rates, was a con-\nservative choice. Had we used the latter \u00ad and therefore calibrated \u00af\n = 0.5 \u00ad, we would have\nfound an even stronger procyclicality of the investment rate dispersion. Finally, we replace the\naggregate Solow residual with the average firm-level Solow residual from USTAN in the bivariate\naggregate driving force, which somewhat increases the procyclicality of investment dispersion.\nMeasurement Error\nMeasuring Solow residuals is potentially fraud with error. Indeed, when we take measure-\nment error in our firm-level Solow residual calculation into account, we find that the average\nstandard deviation of the innovations to this Solow residual, \u00af\n37Technically, with the separable felicity specification in (6) there is no balanced growth path with CRRA=3. The\nmodel remains consistent with balanced growth, if the disutility of leisure grows with the steady state growth rate,\n, and the fundamental discount rate is accordingly adjusted.\n38Assuming additive classical measurement error in firm-level log-Solow residuals and a time-invariant mea-\nsurement error variance, we can use the time-average of the difference between the one-period innovation to ob-\nserved firm-level log-Solow residuals and half the variance of the two-period innovations to estimate the variance\nof measurement error. Subtracting this number (twice) from the observed variance of one-period innovations to\nWe therefore recompute and recalibrate our model with a driving force that is corrected for this\nmeasurement error. The adjustment cost parameter is lowered to \u00af\nthis increases dramatically the procyclicality of investment dispersion. The model overshoots.\nThe next two lines explain why. We keep the fluctuations of the computed Solow residual inno-\nvation dispersion as in the baseline model, but lower mechanically its long-run average and\nrecalibrate the adjustment cost parameter, respectively to \u00af\ntwo effects to consider: for a fixed adjustment cost parameter lowering the long-run average\nof the second-moment driving force mechanically increases the coefficient of variation of the\nlatter, which in isolation drives down the procyclicality of investment dispersion. At the same\ntime, lowering the long-run average dispersion of idiosyncratic productivity shocks also means\nthat the adjustment costs parameter is relatively high compared to the remaining idiosyncratic\nuncertainty, which strengthens the extensive margin effect and on net the procyclicality of in-\nvestment dispersion. The second effect means that this too high adjustment cost parameter\novershoots now the optimal level to match skewness and kurtosis of the long-run investment\nrate distribution. That is why we recalibrate \u00af\n downward. However, this is not enough to offset\nthe positive net effect on the procyclicality of investment dispersion.\nScenario (( ii,t\nThree quarter \u00af\nHalf \u00af\nMeasurement Error + Double volatility of ( i,t ) 0.414\nMeasurement Error + Quadruple volatility of ( i,t ) -0.078\nNotes: See notes to Table 12.\nOne concern with this calibration is that we have treated idiosyncratic and aggregate Solow\nresiduals differently, specifying the former with measurement error and the latter not. The fifth\nrow addresses this concern which is reflected by the fact that aggregate volatility in our baseline\ncalibration is too high (see Appendix C). If this high volatility was due to measurement error,\nthen we would unduly increase the relative importance of first-moment shocks versus second-\nmoment shocks. A calibration where we re-scale the volatility of aggregate Solow residuals \u00ad by\na factor of 0.6 \u00ad to match the observed volatility of aggregate output in the German NIPA data in-\nfirm-level log-Solow residuals yields an estimate of the true variance of the innovations to firm-level log-Solow\nresiduals.\ndeed lowers again the simulated procyclicality of investment dispersion. However, it is still very\nmuch in line with the data, in fact very close to our baseline calibration, where measurement\nerror at any level was ignored.\nThe last two lines of Table 17 finally show that when we again take into account measure-\nment error in the microeconomic driving force only, the procyclicality of investment dispersion\nstill puts a sharp upper bound on the relative importance of countercyclical second-moment\nshocks proposed in Bloom (2009) and Bloom et al. (2009). They basically cannot exceed an\nunconditional time-series percentage standard deviation of twice 4.72%, where the latter is the\npercentage volatility of ( ) after measurement error is taken into account. Notice that rescaling\nthe aggregate Solow residual would only lower that number and make the bound sharper.\nHigher Moments in the Krusell and Smith Rules\nIt remains to be shown that our result is not driven by the choice of only the average capital\nstock in the Krusell and Smith rules (9a) and (9b). While it is the case that in the presence of\ncountercyclical second-moment shocks the conventional R2-measure is fairly low \u00ad at least in\nsome combinations of the discrete aggregate states, the minimum is 0.8701 \u00ad, and while it is also\ntrue that including the skewness of the capital distribution39 leads to an average increase of the\n(2009) for details) nor the cross-sectional dynamics of the model are significantly altered: the\ncorrelation between investment dispersion and cyclical aggregate output raises slightly from\nconservative with respect to our main finding.41 The bottom line, however, is that better fore-\ncasts do not necessarily induce the agents to behave differently (see Bachmann et al. (2008) for\na similar finding).\nThe scatter plots in Figure 4 make this point graphically: the positive relationship between\ninvestment dispersion and cyclical aggregate output is nearly indistinguishable between a nu-\nmerical specification where only average capital is used as a state variable and one, where also\nthe skewness of firm-level capital is included in the forecasting rules.\n39Including the standard deviation of capital does not yield any significant improvements in R2. The average R2\nover all discrete states for the skewness regression, that is analogous to (9a), is 0.9261.\n40We find even somewhat better improvements in the R2 and a similarly small increase in the procyclicality of\ninvestment dispersion, when instead we include the standard deviation of log firm-level Solow residuals as an\nadditional moment in the Krusell and Smith rules. Numbers are available on request.\n41Our finding that the procyclicality of investment dispersion puts a sharp upper bound on the countercyclicality\nof the dispersion of firm-level Solow residual innovations is also robust to including higher moments. Numbers\nare available on request.\nFigure 4: Cross-sectional Dispersion of Firm-Level Investment Rates and Solow Residual Inno-\nvations: Higher Moments\nCyclical Component of GDP\nInvestment Dispersion - Mean Only\nCyclical Component of GDP\nInvestment Dispersion - Skewness\nNotes: Dispersion refers to the cross sectional standard-deviation.\n5.3 Results from Sectoral Calibrations\nTo test our mechanism further, we use the 1-digit sectoral variation in the procyclicality of in-\nvestment dispersion and the extensive margin from Figure 2 in the introduction. We view this as\nan additional and suggestive exercise, given that for computational feasibility we have to make\nan important shortcut. Instead of calibrating and computing a realistic six-sector general equi-\nlibrium model of the German economy, we run six separate specifications of our baseline DSGE\nmodel, where we adjust crucial parameters to sectoral statistics, but otherwise treat the corre-\nsponding sector as the aggregate economy. Specifically, we calibrate the factor elasticities in\nthe production function to sectoral income shares and use our sectoral USTAN results both for\nthe long-run standard deviation (and the kurtosis)42 of the innovations to the firm-level Solow\nresidual, \u00af\n( ), as well as the time series process of the latter. We set the sectoral long-run growth\nrates to zero and calibrate the sectoral depreciation rates to match the sectoral long-run aggre-\ngate investment rate. In the baseline exercise we also use sectoral Solow residuals as the first\nmoment shock in the VAR in equation (2).43 Finally, given all these parameters we calibrate the\nadjustment costs parameter, \u00af\n, to match a variance-weighted quadratic form in sectoral skew-\nness and kurtosis of the firm-level investment rates, analogous to (11). Table 30 in Appendix D\n42As in the aggregate data we find mild excess kurtosis and no skewness across the one-digit sectors. The exact\nnumbers are available from the authors on request.\n43The exact specifications of these VARs for each sector are available from the authors on request. Table 31 in\nAppendix D displays the results, when we use aggregate Solow residuals in the estimation of the driving process\nand aggregate output as the cyclical indicator.\ndisplays the main calibration parameters for each sector. For computational reasons we leave\nout the agricultural sector in this sectoral exercise. There we estimate the revenue elasticity of\ncapital to be 0.935, which requires infeasibly fine and large grids for firm-level capital, a compu-\ntational burden that is beyond the scope of this simple sectoral exercise. Given this high revenue\nelasticity of capital and our results in Table 14 in Section 5.1 about how curvature of the revenue\nfunction relates to the cyclicality of investment dispersion, the low and slightly negative corre-\nlation of investment dispersion in the agricultural sector \u00ad -0.192 (with own sectoral output, see\nTable 6 in Section 2.4) and 0.151 (with aggregate output) \u00ad should come as no surprise and, in\nfact, supports our mechanism without the aforementioned computational burden.44\nSector (( ii,t\nModel Data Model Data\nNotes: See notes to Tables 12. See Figure 2 for the sectoral acronyms. HP(100)-Y refers to the cyclical component\nof aggregate output in the first row, from the second row onwards to the cyclical component of the output of the\ncorresponding sector.\nTable 18 displays the results for the correlations of investment dispersion and the extensive\nmargin, respectively, with own sector output.45 The correlation coefficients between model\nsimulations and data are 0.446 for investment rate dispersion and 0.901 for the extensive mar-\ngin. The corresponding rank correlations are 0.4 and 0.9, respectively. The model captures the\noverall variation with mining and energy not displaying any cyclicality of either investment rate\ndispersion or the extensive margin, the transportation and communication sector featuring a\nmiddle position and manufacturing and construction having the strongest procyclicality. The\nmodels for the latter sectors slightly overestimate procyclicality, for the former one it is underes-\ntimated. The biggest exception is the trade sector, where the models produce an almost perfect\nprocyclicality of both investment rate dispersion and the extensive margin, which is inconsis-\ntent with the data. The explanation is simple: as can be gathered from Table 30 in Appendix D,\n44For similar reasons, in the computation for the mining and energy sector we scale down the measured factor\nelasticities by a factor of 0.9. This facilitates the numerics considerably without compromising our results.\n45Tables 31 and 32 in Appendix D show the results with aggregate output and the own sector average cross-\nsectional investment rate, respectively. The latter show a higher congruence between data and model numbers.\nwe estimate the lowest revenue elasticity of capital in the trade sector \u00ad 0.403. This enormously\nfacilitates the extensive margin mechanism to an extent that is obviously at odds with the data.\nIt appears that we neglected a significant factor in trade that can be adjusted but does not ap-\npear in our specification of the production function. One advantage of using the cross-sectional\ndynamics of investment is that it helps to identify this flaw. Yet, it is beyond the scope of this\npaper to offer a remedy for this discrepancy. We nevertheless view the overall sectoral results\nin support of our basic mechanism, especially given the simplicity of the sectoral exercise, and\nleave the trade \"puzzle\"for future research.\n6 Final Remarks\nThis paper studies the cyclical behavior of the second moments of the cross-sections of firm-\nlevel innovations to value added, Solow residuals, capital and employment. We show that even\nin the presence of countercyclically disperse Solow residual innovations the dispersion of in-\nvestment rates is significantly and robustly procyclical. We also show that this can be quantita-\ntively explained by realistically calibrated non-convex adjustment costs: a procyclical extensive\nmargin effect dominates the countercyclical dispersion in the driving force. Other potential ex-\nplanations, such as financial frictions, are ruled out. We finally argue that the understanding of\nthe cross-sectional business cycle dynamics imposes important restrictions on structural pa-\nrameters and driving forces. In particular, large countercyclical second moment shocks that\ncould generate sizeable business cycle dynamics would be incompatible with procyclical in-\nvestment dispersion.\nWe view this as just the beginning of a new research program that attempts to understand\nmore comprehensively the time-series behavior of the entire cross-section of firms, not merely\nthe cyclicality of second moments. This will ultimately lead to a better microfoundation of\nstructural heterogeneous-firm models and contribute to making them suitable for policy anal-\nysis. We also plan to corroborate these new findings for more countries, in particular the U.S.\nReferences\n[1] Bachmann, R. and C.

When a commer-\ncial bank wished to pledge a commercial bill of exchange to the Bundesbank, the commercial\nbank had to prove the creditworthiness of the bill. For that purpose the bank had to provide\nthe Bundesbank with balance sheet information of all parties who backed the bill of exchange.\nBy law, the Bundesbank could only accept bills backed by at least three parties known to be\ncreditworthy. This procedure allowed the Bundesbank to collect a data set with information\nstemming from the balance sheets and the profit and loss accounts of firms (see Stoess (2001),\nQuality standards of the data are particularly high. All mandatory data collected for USTAN\nhave been double-checked by Bundesbank staff. Hence, the data should contain unusually few\nerrors for a micro-data set. One drawback of USTAN is that with the introduction of the EURO,\nthe Bundesbank stopped buying commercial bills and collected firm balance sheet data only\nirregularly and from publicly available sources. For this reason, the data set stops being useful\nThe coverage of the sample is broad, although it is technically not a representative sam-\nple due to the non-random sample design. It was also more common to use bills of exchange\nin manufacturing and for incorporated companies, which biases our data somewhat towards\nthese kinds of firms. And, of course, the Bundesbank would only rediscount bills with a good\nrating, so that the set of firms in USTAN is also somewhat biased to financially healthy and\nlarger firms.\nNevertheless, USTAN covers a wide range of firms, since short-term financing through com-\nmercial bills of exchange was common practice for many German companies across all busi-\nness sectors (see Table 20 below for the detailed sectoral composition of our final sample). US-\nTAN also has a broad ownership coverage ranging from incorporated firms as well as privately\nowned companies, which distinguishes it from the Compustat data. Within the former group\nUSTAN covers both untraded corporations (e.g. limited liability firms, GmbH) as well as pub-\nlicly held companies (AG) \u00ad see Table 23 below. Finally, USTAN features also a relatively broad\nsize coverage, as we will show in Table 21 below for our final sample, the creation of which we\ndescribe in some detail now.\nWe start out with the universe of observations in the USTAN data, merging the files for\ne.g. bankruptcy or closing balance sheets, or stem from a group/holding (Konzernbilanz). This\nleaves us with only regular balance sheets (Handelsbilanz or Steuerbilanz). We also drop all\nfirms with missing payroll data or missing or negative sales data, which are basically non-\noperating firms. A small amount of duplicate balance sheets is removed as well. And finally, we\ndrop the following sectors: hospitality (hotels and restaurants), which has only a small amount\nof firms in the database, financial and insurance institutions, the mostly public health and ed-\nucation sectors, as well as other public companies like museums, etc. and some other small\nservice industries, such as hair cutters, dry cleaners and funeral homes;46 or when sectoral in-\nformation was missing. The sectoral aggregate we are studying can be roughly characterized as\nthe non-financial private business sector in Germany. This leaves us with an initial data set of\nFrom this initial data set we remove step-by-step more observations, in order to get an eco-\nnomically reasonable data set. We first drop observations from likely East German firms to\navoid a break of the series in 1990. We identify a West German firm as a firm that has a West\nGerman address or has no address information but enters the sample before 1990. Then we\nrecompute capital stocks with a modified perpetual inventory method (PIM) and employment\nlevels. In the modified PIM we drop a small amount of observations from the top and bottom\nof the distribution of correction factors for the initial capital stock, see Appendix A.2. Extreme\ncorrection factors indicate that constant depreciation is not a good approximation for this par-\nticular firm. Such a firm will have had an episode of extraordinary depreciation (e.g. fire, a\nnatural disaster, etc.) and the capital stocks by PIM will be a bad measure of the actual capital\nafter the disaster. We remove observations that do not have a log value added and a log capital\nstock after PIM. Another large part is removed due to not featuring changes in log firm-level\nemployment, capital and real value added, which obviously requires us to observe firms for two\nconsecutive years. Then we remove outliers in factor changes and real value added changes.\nSpecifically, we identify as outliers in our sample a firm-year in which the firm level investment\nrate or log changes in firm-level real value added, employment and capital stock fall outside\na three standard deviations band around the firm and sectoral-year mean. Then we compute\nfirm-level Solow residuals (see Appendix A.4 for details) and similarly remove observations with\nmissing log changes in Solow residuals as well as outliers therein. We finally remove \u00ad before and\n46The number of firms from the public sector and these small industries is tiny to begin with, as they did not use\ncommercial bills as a financing instrument. We left out financial and insurance institutions, as they arguably have\na very different production function and investment behavior.\nafter each step of the outlier removal \u00ad firms that have less than five observations in firm-level\nSolow residual changes. We conduct extensive robustness checks of our results to the choices\nfor the outlier and observation thresholds (see Appendix B). Table 19 summarizes, how much\nobservations are dropped in each step.\nCriterion Drops of Firm-Year Observations\nThe final sample then consists of 854,105 firm-year observations, which amounts to obser-\nvations on 72,853 firms and the average observation length of a firm in the sample is 11.7 years.\nand 23 show the average sectoral 47 and the size distributions in our sample, as well as the dis-\ntributions over the number of observations and legal forms, respectively.\n(Volkswirtschaftliche Gesamtrechnung, VGR) uses.\nID Sector Observations Frequency WZ 2003\nNumber of\nCapital Stock\nReal Value Added\nObs. per Firm Firms Percent Cum.

Table 24 shows that USTAN represents on average 70% of the value added\nof the NFPBS, which, in turn, comprises 59% of the aggregate real value added, 44% of its invest-\nment, etc. Moreover, USTAN replicates the capital-output ratio of NFPBS rather well, somewhat\nless so the other canonical ratios, such as the investment rate, average labor productivity and\nthe labor share, which has obviously to do with our larger firm bias in the sample.48\nFigure 5 shows that except for a certain overrepresentation of manufacturing and a certain\nunderrepresentation of the transportation and communication sector, USTAN represents the\nsectoral composition in NFPBS rather well.\nFigure 6 demonstrates that also the cyclical behavior of USTAN and NFPBS is close. The\ncorrelation of the cyclical components of value added is 0.7671 and for the investment rate it is\n48 To compute these time-average statistics we only average over the data from 1973 to 1990, because from then\non German national accounting does no longer report West and East Germany separately. For the business cy-\ncle statistics we use the post-reunification data, but filter separately before and after this structural break. NFPBS\nvalue added is taken from Bruttowertschoepfung in jeweiligen Preisen, table 3.2.1 of VGR, deflated year-by-year by\nthe implicit deflator for aggregate value added, table 3.1.1 of VGR (we apply the same deflator to USTAN data).\nThe base year is always 1991. We experiment also with implicit sector-specific deflators for value added from\ntable 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 of VGR, and results are robust to this. NFPBS investment is Bruttoanlageinvestitionen in jew-\neiligen Preisen from table 3.2.8.1, deflated with the implicit sector-specific investment price deflators given by\nBruttoanlageinvestitionen - preisbereinigt, a chain index, from table 3.2.9.1, VGR.

Finally, payroll is taken from Arbeitnehmerentgelt, table 3.2.10., VGR, deflated\nby the same general implicit deflator for aggregate value added that we use to deflate value added numbers.\n49We take first differences of log value added and then take out both for it and the investment rate a deterministic\nFigure 5: Sectoral Composition in USTAN and NFPBS\nSectoral Composition: VA\nUSTAN\nNFPBS\nSectoral Composition: I\nUSTAN\nNFPBS\nSectoral Composition: K\nUSTAN\nNFPBS\nNotes:\nGraphs display the fraction of the sum of real value added, investment and capital, respectively, over all firms by\n1-digit sector within the USTAN sample over the NFPBS aggregate.\nFinally, how does the USTAN investment rate cross-section compare to known data from\nthe U.S.?

The first step is to compute\nfirm-level investment series, ii,t , from the corporate balance sheets, which contain data only\non accounting capital stocks, ka\ni,t\n, and accounting total depreciation, da\ni,t\n. The following accu-\nmulation identity allows to back out nominal firm-level investment:50\nka\n= ka\ni,t\n-da\ni,t\n+ pI\nt\nThe next step is to recognize that capital stocks from corporate balance sheets are not di-\nrectly usable for economic analysis for two reasons: 1) accounting depreciation, da\ni,t\n, in cor-\nporate balance sheets is often motivated by tax reasons and typically higher than economic\ndepreciation, e\ni,t\n, expressed as a rate; 2) accounting capital stocks are reported at historical\ni,t\nis the sum of balance sheet items ap65, Technische Anlagen und Maschinen, and ap66, Andere\nAnlagen, Betriebs-und Geschaeftsausstattung, for equipment; and balance sheet item ap64, Grundstuecke, Bauten,\nfor structures. Since balance sheet data are typically end-of-year stock data, notice that ka\ni,t\nis the end-of-period\ncapital stock in year t -1. da\ni,t\nis profit and loss account item ap156, Abschreibungen auf Sachanlagen und imma-\nterielle Vermoegensgegenstaende des Anlagevermoegens. In contrast to ka\ni,t\n, da\ni,t\nis not given for each capital good\nseparately. For the solution of this complication, see below.\nprices. Both effects would lead to an underestimation of the real firm-level capital stock, if one\nwere to simply deflate the current accounting capital stock, ka\ni,t\n, with a current investment price\ndeflator, pI\nt\n(assuming that pI\nt\nincreases over time). We therefore apply a Perpetual Inventory\nMethod (PIM) to compute economic real capital stocks:\n= ka\nt\ni,t\n+\npI\nt\npI\nka\nis the accounting capital stock in prices of 1991 at the beginning of an uninterrupted\nsequence of firm observations \u00ad if for a firm-year we have a missing investment observation,\nthe PIM is started anew, when the firm appears again in the data set. We estimate e\nt\nfor each\nyear from national accounting data, VGR, separately for equipment and non-residential struc-\ntures (table 3.1.3, VGR, Nettoanlagevermoegen nach Vermoegensarten in jeweiligen Preisen, Aus-\nruestungen und Nichtwohnbauten; table 3.1.4, VGR, Abschreibungen nach Vermoegensarten in\njeweiligen Preisen, Ausruestungen und Nichtwohnbauten). VGR contains sectoral and capital\ngood specific depreciation data only after 1991, which is why we decided to use only capital\ngood specific depreciation rates for the entire time horizon. For the data sources for invest-\nment price deflators see footnote 48. The drawback of this procedure is that we do not observe\ndirectly capital-good specific da\ni,t\nin the balance sheets (differently from ka\ni,t\n), so that (12) is not\ndirectly applicable for the two types of capital goods separately. We therefore split up da\ni,t\nac-\ncording to the fraction that each capital good accounts for in the book value of total capital,\nweighting each capital good by its VGR depreciation rate. Creating a capital series for both cap-\nital goods this way is mainly meant to provide a better estimate for total capital for each firm,\nbecause we finally aggregate up both types of capital into a single capital good at the firm-level.\nThere is a final complication, which comes through relying on ka\nas the starting value of\nthe PIM. It is typically not a good estimate of the productive real capital stock of the firm at that\ntime. Therefore, we calculate the time-average factor  (for each sector), by which k(1)\ni,t\nis larger\nthan ka\ni,t\n, and replace ka\nby ka\nin the perpetual inventory method. We do this iteratively,\nuntil  converges, i.e. we calculate:\nk(n)\nt\nk(n)\ni,t\n+\npI\nt\npI\nk(n)\n(n) = (NT )-1\ni,t\nk(n)\ni,t\ni,t\nwhere k(0)\ni,t\n= ka\ni,t\n, (0) = 1. We stop when for each sector and each capital good category  < 1.1.\nSince for our purposes we want to compute economic, i.e. productive, capital stocks, we\nthen \u00ad as a final step \u00ad add to the capital stock series from this iterative PIM the net present\nvalue of the real expenditures for renting and leasing equipment and structures.51\nA.3 Labor Inputs\nA more particular difficulty with USTAN data is that information on the number of employees is\nonly updated infrequently for some companies, as it is not taken directly from balance sheets,\nbut sampled from supplementary company information. Being no balance sheet item, the em-\nployment data is not constrained by legal accounting rules and did not undergo consistency\nchecks by Bundesbank staff. However, in order to compute firm-level Solow residuals, we need\nsome measure of employment.\nWe base this measure on the payroll data (wagebilli,t ) from the profit and loss statements\n(item ap154, Personalaufwand). Payroll data is regulated by accounting standards and is checked\nfor consistency by the Bundesbank using accounting identities. In contrast to the direct em-\nployment data, the payroll data is generally considered of high quality. Therefore, we exploit\nthis data to construct a proxy measure for (log) employment ni,t as follows (with a slight abuse\nof notation, we use ni,t here for log employment).\nThe idea behind our proxy measure is that we can determine sectoral average wages even\nthough firm level employment is measured with error. Since wage bargaining in Germany is\nhighly centralized, the sectoral average wage is all we need then, since it is a good proxy for firm\nlevel wages. Therefore, dividing firm level payroll by the sectoral average wage recovers true\nfirm level employment.\nSpecifically, we assume that the measurement error in reported log employment, n\ni,t\nclassical and additive:\nn\ni,t\nThen we decompose the wage per employee, i,t , of firm i at time t into two effects. One is\ndetermined by a firm-time-specific wage component wi,t , and the other one being region-,\nr (i,t), sector-, j (i,t), and size-class-specific, s (i,t), where j (i,t), r (i,t) and s (i,t) denote that\n51 Specifically, we take item ap161, Miet- und Pachtaufwendungen, from the profit and loss accounts, deflate it by\nthe implicit investment good price deflator, which we compute, in turn, from tables 3.2.8.1 and 3.2.9.1 from VGR,\nand then divide it by a measure of the user cost of capital. The latter is simply the sum of real interest rates for a\ngiven year, which - courtesy of the Bundesbank - we compute from nominal interest rates on corporate bonds and\nex-post CPI inflation data (the series is available from the authors upon request), and the time-average, accounting\ncapital-good weighted depreciation rate per firm.\n52We use item ap34, Beschaeftigtenzahl im Durchschnitt des Geschaeftsjahres, to measure n\ni,t\n, where available.\nfirm i belongs to sector j, region r and size-class s at time t, respectively.53 Thus, we write\ni,t = \u00af\nwj(i,t),r(i,t),s(i,t),t + wi,t . (19)\nWe denote all firms that belong to sector j, region r and size-class s at time t by I j,r,s,t . Then\nwe can estimate a sector-region-size wage component, \u00af\n\u00af\nwj,r,s,t =\n#I j,r,s,t\niI(j,r,s,t)\nlog wagebilli,t -n\ni,t\nWe then use this estimate of the average wage rate to estimate employment on the basis of the\nfirm's wage bill:\n^\nnit = logwagebillit - \u00af\n= nit +it -\n#I j,r,s,t\nhI(j,r,s,t)\nnh,t\n+h,t\n- nh,t\n+h,t\n= nit + wit -\n#I j,r,s,t\nhI(j,r,s,t)\nwh,t\n-h,t\n= nit + wit +\n#I j,r,s,t\nhI(j,r,s,t)\nh,t\nThe second equality stems from using (18). The next to last equality holds, because one can\nreplace it by (19), realizing that the \u00af\nw, which do not depend on a specific firm, cancel. The\nlast equality holds, because, by construction, the average firm-level deviation from a sector-\nregion-size bin is zero in every year. For #I j,r,s,t large, the average measurement error term\n#I(j,r,s,t) hI(j,r,s,t) h,t\nis negligible. In addition, since wage bargaining is highly centralized\nin Germany, also the firm specific wage component, wit , can be expected to be of lesser impor-\ntance, i.e. the variance 2\nw\nis small. In particular it can be expected to be smaller than the initial\nmeasurement error in employment stocks. Therefore our measure of employment, ^\nni,t , should\nfollow real employment, ni,t , more closely than n\ni,t\n.\nTo corroborate this claim, we checked our procedure using data from the German social\n53Specifically, for sectors we use the 2-digit classification in Table 20 in Appendix A.1. For size classes we use\nterciles of the capital distribution in each year. For the region-specific wage component we proceed as follows: we\ndivide West Germany into three regions, according to zip codes: South with zip codes starting with 7,8,9, except for\nwell as 48 and 59. However, not all balance sheets feature zip code information, which is why we compute \u00af\nwj,r,s,t\nwith and without a region component. For those firms that do not have zip code information or for those firms\nthat are in sector-region-size bins with fewer than 50 observations in a given year, we take the estimate without the\nregion component.\nwj,r,s,t we of course use only those observations, where n\ni,t\n, i.e. item ap34, Beschaeftigtenzahl im\nDurchschnitt des Geschaeftsjahres, is available.\nsecurity records at the Institut fuer Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung (IAB), which provide in-\nformation on the wage bill and employment at the establishment level. There we observe true\nemployment and wage bills for all plants and the time 1975-2006. Constraining ourselves to the\nthe one of the USTAN data, we find the correlation between ^\nni,t and ni,t as well as between  ^\nni,t\nand ni,t to be fairly high (98% and 94%, respectively). This means that the cross-sectional vari-\nance of the firm specific wage innovations 2\nw\nvariance of employment changes (2\nn\n ^\nn\nbetween mean(ni,t ) in the USTAN data and the log-change in aggregate NFPBS employment\nof 0.653 shows also the quality of our employment measure.\nA.4 Solow Residual Calculation\nWith the estimated firm-level capital stocks and employment levels we can now compute firm-\nlevel Solow residuals from the logged production function (1). In our baseline specification we\nestimate the factor elasticities,  and , as 1-digit sector-specific median, pooled over all firm-\nyear observations in a sector, expenditure shares.55 Table 26 displays the estimated elasticities.\nSimulations show that under the null hypothesis of the model the labor elasticity is very accu-\nrately estimated by the labor share, whereas the capital elasticity is slightly overestimated by the\ncapital share, which makes our simulations conservative, as we have shown that a lower capital\nelasticity, i.e. more curvature in the revenue function, will lead to a stronger extensive margin\neffect, that will make investment dispersion more procyclical (see Section 5.1 for details). No-\ntice that for the aggregate Solow residual calculation in the baseline scenario, for which we use\nthe data sources specified in Footnote 48 in Appendix A.1, we simply use the expenditure shares\nfrom manufacturing, as manufacturing is still the largest sector within NFPBS (had we used any\nweighted median of expenditure shares the result would have been the same). We experiment\nalso with weighted average expenditure shares, both weighted with value added and with em-\nployment/capital and using USTAN and NFPBS weights. To come up with a single number\nfor each factor elasticity, we simply take the median of these four weighted averages and use\nbut the baseline result is not changed: the resulting procyclicality of investment dispersion is\n55We use profit and loss account item ap153, Rohergebnis, for firm-level value added and deflate it in the baseline\nscenario with the aggregate value added deflator, but experiment also with sector-specific value added deflators,\nsee Footnote 48 in Appendix A.1 for details. To compute firm-level expenditure shares, we proceed as follows:\nthe labor share is simply total payroll divided by value added (ap154/ap153); capital expenditures, which are then\nagain divided by value added, are the sum of the PIM capital stock and the net present value of renting and leasing\nexpenditures multiplied by the user cost of capital as specified in Footnote 51 in Appendix A.2.\nID Sector labor share  capital share \nA.5 Two More Graphs\nFigure 7: Data: Time Series of Investment Dispersion and Cyclical Component of GDP - Nor-\nmalized by their STD\nstd(IK)\nNotes:\nDispersion refers to the cross sectional standard-deviation.

No detrending. The corresponding\ndata for (log i,t ) and (log yi,t ) can be found in Bachmann and Bayer (2009).\nB Robustness of Cross-sectional Cyclicality\nIn this appendix we check the robustness of the main empirical finding of this paper \u00ad the pro-\ncyclicality of investment dispersion \u00ad to sample selection and variable construction. First, we\nuse an aggregate price deflator for investment goods (see Footnote 48 in Appendix A.1 for de-\ntails) in the perpetual inventory method instead of sectoral deflators separately for equipment\nand structures. Second, we employ a stricter outlier removal criterion of 2.5 standard deviations\naround the firm- and year-specific mean in Solow residual and value added innovations, as well\nas investment rates and employment changes. Third, we use two more liberal outlier criteria us-\ning 5 and 10 standard deviations instead of 3.56 Fourth, we employ a specification, where we\nassume that an outlier above 3 standard deviations means a merger and, subsequently, treat\nthese firms as new firms in addition to removing them in the year, where the outlier occurs.\nFifth, we restrict the sample to firms with at least 20 observations in first differences, in order\nto make sure that the cyclical effects we find are not due to cyclical variations in the sample\ncomposition.57 Sixth, we use all the firms that we observe at least twice with first differences.58\nFinally, we carry out a more standard PIM that simply uses the reported capital stocks in the\nfirst year of observation for a firm, instead of solving a fixed point problem in correction factors\n(see Appendix A.2 for details). As one can see from Table 28, the results are robust to all these al-\nternative sampling procedures; in particular, the robust procyclicality of investment dispersion\nis not driven by a change in the cyclicality of the dispersion of the driving force.\n56The latter variant lowers the number of dropped firm-year observations due to outliers in factor and value\nThis leaves the total number of firm-year observations at 934,315 and the total number of firms in the sample at\n57Consistent with the slightly lower correlation of investment dispersion with aggregate output in this case, we\nfind the same correlation coefficient to be 0.382, when we control for sample selection in the following way: we\nestimate a simple selection model, where lagged firm-level Solow residuals determine selection and the firm-level\ninvestment rate is modeled as a mean regression. We use the maximum likelihood estimator by Heckman (1976)\nto infer the selection-corrected variance of the residual in the firm-level investment rate equation. The latter is\nvery close to the sample variance of firm-level investment rates, indicating that our results are not influenced by\nsystematic sample drop-outs.\n58This lowers the number of dropped firm-year observations due to not satisfying the minimum observation\nTreatment (( ii,t\nC Aggregate Statistics\nMoment/Aggregate Quantity Y C I N\nNotes:\nBusiness cycle statistics of aggregate output, Y , consumption C, investment I and employment N.

The first numbers in a column refer to a simulation of the model over T =\n1500 periods. Numbers in brackets refer to German aggregate NFPBS data. Persistence refers to the first order\nautocorrelation.\nAll variables are logged and then HP-filtered with a smoothing parameter of 100. The num-\nbers in brackets are the statistics from the data, from the sectoral aggregate that corresponds\nto the USTAN data: the non-financial private business sector (NFPBS). They are gathered from\nGerman sectoral national accounting data (see Footnote 48 in Appendix A.1 for details). Real\nprivate consumption data are private Konsumausgaben, a chain index with base year in 1991,\nfrom table 3.2 in the VGR. The model employment variable includes the amount of labor used\nto adjust the firms' capital stocks.\nIn our baseline calibration, the economy is overall too volatile, which we attribute partly to\nthe fact that we compute the aggregate Solow residual process from the private non-financial\nbusiness sector and not from the overall economy. Nevertheless, both the too high volatility\nnumbers, as well as the too low persistence numbers as well as the discrepancy between model\nand the data in the relative standard deviations \u00ad relative to std(Y ) \u00ad of aggregate consumption\nand aggregate investment show that there is not enough smoothing in the baseline calibration,\nwhich is a well-known problem of the standard RBC model. Our baseline model cannot improve\nthat, as the level of non-convexities essentially puts it in a parameter range, where the Khan and\nThomas neutrality result still holds (see Khan and Thomas, 2008). Since this paper is exclusively\nconcerned with cross-sectional dynamics, for which \u00ad as we have shown \u00ad non-convexities mat-\nter already at a level, where they would be near-neutral for aggregate dynamics, we do not view\nthis as a problem for our main result. More smoothing could be implemented through a stan-\ndard quadratic adjustment cost element on top of the fixed cost, however at both a substantial\ncomputational burden and at the expense of cleanness of exposition. In fact, quadratic adjust-\nment costs would work very similarly to an increase in curvature in the maximized-out revenue\nfunction, which, as we have shown, puts more emphasis on the procyclical extensive margin\nand would only strengthen our mechanism. Our robustness checks include a case, where we\ndecrease the volatility of the aggregate Solow residual in order to match the volatility of aggre-\ngate output. This puts relatively more weight on the second-moment shocks, i.e. the counter-\ncyclicality of the dispersion in the Solow residual innovations, and would make it \u00ad all things\nequal \u00ad harder for the extensive margin effect in the lumpy model to generate procyclicality of\ninvestment dispersion. Row five in Table 17 in Section 5.2 shows that this does not invalidate\nour baseline result. To summarize: the aggregate shortcomings of the model are similar to the\none in the standard RBC model, but based on our robustness checks we view them as mainly\northogonal to the cross-sectional dynamics that this paper focusses on.\nD Sectoral Calibration\nSector \u00af\n \u00af\n( ) skew( ii,t\n) kur t( ii,t\n)   \nNotes: See Figure 2 for the sectoral acronyms. \u00af\n is the calibrated adjustment cost parameter. \u00af\n( ) is the long-run\nstandard deviation of the innovations to the firm-level Solow residual.  and  are the capital and employment,\nrespectively, elasticity in the production function.
