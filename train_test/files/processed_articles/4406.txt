We find that, though democracies are some-\ntimes established in the wake of coups, more often new\nauthoritarian regimes emerge. Further, we show that coups\nfrequently increase state-led violence, particularly follow-\ning coups that lead to new autocratic regimes.\nIn a recent critique of our study, Miller (2016) chal-\nlenges one particular finding: that coups rarely lead to\ndemocratization. He argues that our use of a regime-case\nfixed-effects (FE) model to estimate the impact of coups on\nthe likelihood of transitions to democracy drops a number\nof key observations from the sample, biasing our estimates.\nHe emphasizes that when a country FE model is used\ninstead, there is a positive relationship.\nIn our original analysis, we find that there is no asso-\nciation between post-Cold War coups and democratiza-\ntion in a regime-case FE model, but show in the online\nappendix to our published results (Figure A-2) that there\nis a positive association between post-Cold War coups and\ndemocratic transition when using a country FE model.1\nMiller (2016) re-reports and expands on the country FE\nmodel of democratic transitions that we report in the\nappendix to our original analysis. In fact, the conclusions\nof Miller (2016) are identical to those drawn from one set\nof tests we report in the original appendix. We thank the\neditors of Research and Politics, however, for allowing\nus to further the discussion of the points articulated in\nIn the analysis that follows, we first offer background on\nthe key issues that underlie Miller's critique. We then re-\nstate Miller's critique in a slightly different way and\ndemonstrate visually the differences between regime-case\nand country FE models in this application. In doing so, we\nfocus on the post-Cold War period because Miller's only\npoint of disagreement about the consequences of coups\npertains to the relationship between post-1989 coups and\ndemocratic transition.\nBackground\nMiller's (2016) main argument is that a country FE estima-\ntor is preferable to a regime-case FE estimator when mod-\neling the effect of coups on the chance of democratic\nAre coups good for democracy?\nGeorge Derpanopoulos1, Erica Frantz2,\nBarbara Geddes1 and Joseph Wright3\n Keywords\nCoups, democratization, authoritarian regimes, regime change\n1University of California at Los Angeles, USA\n2Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA\n3Pennsylvania State University, University Park, USA\nCorresponding author:\nJoseph Wright, Pennsylvania State University, 203 Pond Lab, University\nEmail: josephGwright@gmail.com\nResearch Note\n2 Research and Politics \ntransition. Yet, all modeling choices have advantages and\ndisadvantages, and the \"optimal\" approach is up to scholars\nto assess. It is for this reason that we presented the results\nof both in our study (the regime-case FE model in the main\ntext and the country FE model in the appendix). Here, how-\never, we provide a more in-depth discussion of the logic\nunderlying both approaches and their strengths and draw-\nbacks in light of the Miller (2016) critique.\nA FE estimator isolates the over-time variation in the\ndata, allowing inferences that are not contaminated by\nunobserved unit (or cross-sectional) heterogeneity. When\nestimating FE models, researchers must determine the\ncross-sectional unit over which to isolate the time trends. In\nour original paper, we reported results from two sets of\nmodels that make different assumptions about the appropri-\nate cross-sectional unit: the country and the regime-case.\nA country FE model isolates variation over time within\ncountries; that is, it uses information about movement over\ntime in the independent and dependent variables to identify\nthe estimated parameter of interest (in this application, the\nmarginal effect of a recent coup on the probability of transi-\ntion to a new autocratic regime or to democracy). This\napproach accounts for time-invariant heterogeneity across\ncountries, such as colonial history and geographic endow-\nments. When a country contains more than one autocratic\nregime \u00ad for example in the Democratic Republic of Congo\n(DRC), Guinea, or Thailand \u00ad a country FE estimator com-\npares periods of no recent coup with periods of recent coup\nwithin the same country to inform an estimate of how\nrecent coups influence regime instability.\nIn this application, a regime-case represents a continu-\nous spell of years under the rule of a single autocratic\nregime. In some instances, regime-cases are preceded and\nsucceeded by periods of democratic rule. For example,\n2014, each time ushering in a new autocratic regime. In\nother instances, we see successive autocratic regime-cases\nduring the period of analysis. Examples include the DRC\n(former Zaire), where a rebellion led by Laurent Kabila\ntoppled the long-standing Mobutu regime in 1997, and\nGuinea, where a junior officer coup led by Dadis Camara\nA regime-case FE model therefore enables a within-\nregime comparison of what follows a coup, while condi-\ntioning out all differences between autocratic regimes\n(e.g. level of development, how the regime seized power,\nthe types of leaders the regime selects to rule). Thus,\nperiods of no recent coup are compared with periods of\nrecent coup within the same regime-case. Critically, this\napproach takes into account autocratic regime type, such\nas whether the incumbent regime is ruled by the military.\nThis is crucial because of strong empirical evidence that\ncoups are more frequent in military dictatorships and\nthat military dictatorships are more likely, all else equal,\nEmploying a regime-case fixed effects estimator implies\nthat: (1) the baseline likelihood of a democratic transition\nand coup varies by the regime as well as by country; and (2)\nshort-lived regimes may not have sufficient variation in the\nkey explanatory variable (recent coup) to inform the esti-\nmated parameter of interest. In this application, the latter\nfeature of the regime-case fixed effect estimator has the\neffect, as Miller (2016: 2) notes, of \"effectively remov[ing]\nmost recent coups from the sample.\" While Miller focuses\non the fact that the regime-case FE estimator drops some\ncases where the short-lived autocratic regime is always in a\nstate of having had a recent coup, the substantive benefit of\nthis design choice is that the baseline likelihoods of democ-\nratization and coups are not constrained to be the same for\nall regimes within the same country.2\nThe issue that Miller raises regarding the bias of the\nregime-case FE modeling approach is largely not present\nwhen employing a country FE estimator in this application\nbecause, when there are multiple regimes within the post-\nCold War period, at least one of them has a period where\nthe recent coup indicator is equal to 0.3 There are, therefore,\ntrade-offs in choosing between regime-case FE and country\nFE estimators. Our published analysis included both types\nof tests for interested readers to compare the differing\nresults for democratic transition.\nOne way to summarize the Miller (2016) critique is as fol-\nlows: in some short-lived autocracies, the main explanatory\nvariable (recent coup) does not vary over time within the\nregime-case. For example, if a coup occurs in time t - 2\nbut the regime only lasts one year, then recent coup will\nhave a value of 1 for the entire period of regime rule. A\nregime-case FE estimator does not draw support from these\ncases to estimate the parameter of interest because it iso-\nlates the \"within\" variation, and these regimes have no\n\"within-case\" variation in the recent coup indicator.\nConsider a second way to illustrate the same point in a\nmodel specification that separates the \"within\" and\n\"between\" variation in the explanatory variables4\nPr Y Y X X\ni t i t i t i\ni i t i t\n-\n+ -\n+ + + +\n \n    \nIn this equation, Xi\nis the mean value of the main explanatory\nvariable and i can be either the country or the regime-case.\nThus X X\ni t i\n,\n- is the deviation from the unit mean (i.e. the\n\"within\" variation) and Xi\nis the unit mean (i.e. the \"between\"\nvariation). In our application, the parameter of interest is \n,\nwhich is the estimate of the marginal effect of recent coup\n( X X\ni t i\n,\n- ) on the probability of democratic transition.\nThe concern that Miller raises with respect to fixed\neffects models can be illustrated by noting that, for cases in\nDerpanopoulos et al. 3\nwhich there is no \"within\" variation \u00ad those where the\nregime is always in a state of recent coup \u00ad the mean level\nof coups, Xi\nis 1. Thus Xi t\n,\n=1 for all t and Xi\ni t i\n,\n- =0 in these cases.\nNote that, if there is more than one autocratic regime per\ncountry, then Xiregime\nis not necessarily equal to Xicountry\n.\nThus while the regime-case mean for recent coup may be 1,\nthe country mean for the same variable may be less than 1.5\nFigure 1 shows the distribution of regime-case Xi\ns and\ncountry Xi\ns for the post-1989 sample. The left plot shows\nthe entire sample, while the right plot shows only regimes\nwith at least one successful coup during this period. The\ngray bars represent the regime-case Xi\ns for recent coup,\nwhile the un-shaded bars with blue outlines represent the\ncountry Xi\ns for recent coup. The right plot shows that there\nare substantially more regime-case Xi\ns equal to 1 than\ncountry Xi\ns. The regimes where the regime-case Xi\ns equal\n1 are effectively dropped from the estimating sample for\nlack of within-case variation in the recent coup indicator.\nTable 1 lists the 16 cases of short-lived autocratic\nregimes where the regime-case mean for recent coup is\nalways equal to 1. Half of these cases, or eight in total,\ndemocratize after the regime collapses. Miller's argument\nis that the regime-case fixed effects model does not draw\nsupport from these sixteen cases to estimate the main\nparameter of interest. While we agree with Miller's larger\npoint that regime-case FE in this application effectively\nremove short-lived regimes from the analysis, we note that\nmany of these short-lived dictatorships dropped from the\nanalysis are coded as dictatorships precisely because a\nrecent coup toppled an incumbent democracy. The cases\nhighlighted in gray are those in which the historical coup\nevent that makes the indicator of recent coup equal to 1 is a\ncoup that ended a democracy. One practical effect of using\na regime-case estimator that does not draw support from\nshort-lived autocracies is that this approach does not count\nthe \"democratic reversal\" coups in Table 1 as potential can-\ndidates for coups that enhance democracy.\nMore to Miller's point, there are four cases where recent\ncoups in short-lived dictatorships are followed by demo-\ncases do not inform the estimate of interest; however, in a\ncountry FE model they are included because the country\nXi\nis less than 1. Thus the key difference, in this applica-\ntion, between a regime-case FE estimator and a country FE\nestimator, is that the latter allows those four `positive'cases\nto inform the estimate of interest.\nRemarks\nWe acknowledge that there are trade-offs in choosing\nbetween different estimators (regime-case FE and country\nFE in this application). In our original analysis, we reported\nthe results from both FE estimators for both of our depend-\nent variables: transition to democracy and transition to new\nautocracy. Results from both FE estimators yielded consist-\nent results for coups and transitions to new autocratic\nregimes. This gives us confidence that these results are not\ndependent on the choice of cross-sectional `unit'. The tests\nfor transitions to democracy, however, were mixed.\nThe larger point of our original study and the main point\nwe emphasize here is that coups in dictatorships increase the\nrisk of a new autocracy taking power; indeed, most coups in\ndictatorships are followed by new autocratic regimes. This\nfinding is not dependent on the time period under analysis\ntion between post-1989 coups and democratic transition is\nless robust than prior studies have suggested, as we showed in\nour replication of Thyne and Powell (2016).\n4 Research and Politics \nWe do not anticipate that our analysis will be the last\nword on this issue because our results \u00ad and all results using\nless than 30 years of data (post 1989) \u00ad are based on only a\nhandful of instances when coups in dictatorships coincide\nwith subsequent democratic transition.As more coups occur\nin the real world, additional data may alter our conclusions.\nTherefore, we urge policy-makers to digest evidence\nfor the \"good coup\" hypothesis with some skepticism. We\nalso encourage researchers to dig deeper in terms of better\nunderstanding why some post-Cold War coups precipitate\ntransitions to democracy, while other coups simply unleash\nnew forms of authoritarianism, often accompanied by\nincreased state-led violence (Derpanopoulos et al., 2016).\nGaining a more solid grasp of why it is that coups can lead\nto such disparate outcomes seems like an important step\nfor moving forward.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency\nin the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nSupplementary material\nThe appendix (Table A-1) is available at: http://journals.\nFigure A-2 appears in the online appendix to original article and\ncan be found at http://sites.psu.edu/wright/wp-content/uploads/\nNotes\n1. As readers may know, Research and Politics has a strict, low\nword count of 4000 words. This necessitates putting some of\nthe discussion of robustness tests in an online appendix.\n2. The issue that Miller underlines also arises when estimating the\nrelationship between coups and autocratic transition. For exam-\nple, half (10 out of 20) of the cases in which the coup variable\ncoincides with autocratic transition during the post-1989 period\nare in a state of recent coup during their entire (short) duration\nand therefore do not inform the estimates. Thus, the models\nwith regime-case FE reported in the main text of our original\nstudy are difficult tests of the hypothesis because the estimates\nfrom these models do not draw support from these short-lived\nregimes. In contrast to democratic transitions, the findings for\nautocratic transitions are robust to this difficult test.\n3. The one exception is Thailand.\n4. This equation is analytically equivalent to one that includes\nthe non-demeaned variables as well as the mean variables as\ncovariates. The estimates for 1\nin equation (1) are the same\nas those in a model that includes Xi t\n,\n+ Xi\nas covariates.\n5. In the estimating sample, there are three observations \u00ad all\nfor Thailand \u00ad for which the country Xi is equal to 1.
