    "abstract": "Abstract. In stimulus-parity synaesthesia, a range of stimuli--for example, letters, numbers,\nweekdays, months, and colours (the inducers)--elicit an automatic feeling of oddness or evenness\n(the concurrent). This phenomenon was first described by Th\u00e9odore Flournoy in 1893, and has\nonly recently been \"rediscovered.\" Here, we describe an individual who experiences a comparable\nphenomenon, but uses the labels negative and positive rather than odd and even. Stimulus-parity\nsynaesthesia may be broader than first supposed, and it is important that assessments are sensitive\nto this breadth.\n",

Is it odd or even? These questions, rather than the word\nNovember, will likely strike many readers as odd. And yet, for individuals with certain subtypes of syn-\naesthesia, the questions elicit an automatic response. In ordinal linguistic personification (OLP: Simner\n& Holenstein, 2007), also referred to as sequence\u00adpersonality synaesthesia (Simner, G\u00e4tner, & Taylor,\n2011), members of ordinal linguistic sequences are personified; for example, they may be ascribed\ngender, appearance, and personality. Thus, the word November may elicit the image of a handsome,\nextroverted man. In stimulus\u00adparity synaesthesia (White & Plassart, in press), stimuli elicit an auto-\nmatic feeling of oddness or evenness. Thus, the word November may feel \"very odd\" or \"slightly even.\"\nThe term synaesthesia--from syn- (joining) and -aesthesia (sensation)--stresses sensation, but\nthe phenomenon is remarkably broad, and comprises atypical merging of cognitive and sensory con-\nstructs (Simner, 2012). The triggering stimulus is called the inducer and the resulting experience is\ncalled the concurrent (Grossenbacher & Lovelace, 2001). There are at least 63 reported subtypes of\nsynaesthesia (Day, 2014), with different conceptual and perceptual inducer-concurrent pairings. The\nmost widely-investigated subtype is grapheme\u00adcolour synaesthesia, in which numbers and letters are\nassociated with an experience of colour. Thus, a grapheme\u00adcolour synaesthete may perceive the letter\nN as orange and, due to the letter-to-word transference effect (Calkins, 1893; Simner & Holenstein,\n2007; Simner & Hubbard, 2006), she may also perceive the word November as being orange.Although\nat first glance, grapheme\u00adcolour synaesthesia may appear to be a purely perceptual phenomenon--\nseeing graphemes elicits an experience of seeing colours--for the vast majority of synaesthetes, it\nis the conceptual notion or categorisation of the grapheme that elicits the colour experience (Sim-\nner, 2007), rather than low-level features of the grapheme (see also Ward, Li, Salih, & Sagiv, 2007).\nIndeed, Simner (2012) notes that the \"overwhelming majority of synaesthesiae appear to be triggered\nby the high-order cognitive constructs involved in language comprehension and production\" (p. 3, see\nalso Simner, 2007). In OLP and stimulus-parity synaesthesia, high-order cognitive constructs serve as\nboth the inducing stimulus and the concurrent experience. Some researchers have questioned whether\nthe term synaesthesia should be reserved for phenomena involving perceptual concurrents.1 However,\nStimulus-parity synaesthesia versus stimulus-dichotomy\nsynaesthesia: Odd, even or something else?\n1For recent discussions about the breadth of phenomena that may constitute synaesthesia, and how\nthese phenomena relate to normal crossmodal perception in non-synaesthetic individuals, see: Cohen\n46 White RC, Plassart A\nthe less prototypical subtypes--such as those pairing conceptual inducers and conceptual concur-\nrents--exhibit the hallmarks of synaesthesia. OLP associations have been shown to (1) co-occur with\nother subtypes, (2) be highly consistent, (3) have the characteristic of letter-to-word transference and\n(4) be automatically generated (Simner & Holenstein, 2007). And likewise, stimulus\u00adparity associa-\ntions have been shown to (1) co-occur with other subtypes, (2) be highly consistent and (3) elicit a\nsubjective impression of automaticity (White & Plassart, in press).\nWhereas OLP is a relatively well-known phenomenon, which has been the focus of historical (e.g.\nstein, 2007; Simner et al., 2011), stimulus\u00adparity synaesthesia is virtually unknown. The phenomenon\nwas described by Flournoy in his 1893 book Des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes de synopsie [\"Of synoptic phenom-\nena\"]. Flournoy observed that many individuals attribute oddness and evenness to non-numerical\nstimuli, and he suggested that the attribution of oddness and evenness to weekdays may occur \"even\nmore frequently\" (p. 222) than the attribution of gender to weekdays (as in OLP). Thus, it is surpris-\ning that 120 years passed without further discussion or observation of the odd\u00adeven phenomenon. We\nrecently identified two individuals (R and M) who reported that a range of stimuli--for example, let-\nters, numbers, weekdays, months, colours--elicited a feeling of oddness or evenness, and we offered\nthe term stimulus\u00adparity synaesthesia to describe this \"forgotten\" subtype of synaesthesia (White &\nPlassart, accepted manuscript).\nSubsequently, we have identified another individual, W (a 63-year-old right-handed female), who\nexperiences a near-identical phenomenon. Many stimuli--for example, letters, numbers, weekdays,\nmonths, seasons, city names--elicit an automatic feeling of belonging to one of two conceptual cat-\negories, and this occurs when W reads, hears or thinks about the stimulus; thus, it is the high-level\nconceptual stimulus that serves as the inducer. Crucially however, the two categories are \"negative and\npositive,\" rather than odd and even. When she uses the labels negative and positive, W is not referring\nto things as being bad or good. Some of her favourite seasons and places elicit the description nega-\ntive. W explains that negative things elicit an automatic feeling of being \"soft, subtle, gentle, unclut-\ntered, delicate, transient, and with fuzzy edges\" whereas positive things elicit an automatic feeling\nof being \"strong, defined, inflexible and structured\". We assessed W on two occasions, separated by\n2.5 months. At each testing session, we presented W with a list of 67 stimuli (letters = 26, numbers =\n10, weekdays = 7, months = 12, seasons = 4, city names = 8), and asked her to indicate whether each\nstimulus was negative or positive. Responses were highly consistent at the two time points, with iden-\nW's associations have the hallmarks of synaesthesia. Individuals with one form of synaesthesia\nare likely to have another (Simner, 2012), and W also experiences OLP. Synaesthetic associations\ntend to be consistent across time, and W demonstrates highly consistent negative\u00adpositive associa-\ntions. Concurrent experiences in synaesthesia are perceived as involuntary, and W reports that stimuli\nelicit an immediate feeling of being negative or positive. In addition, early onset is characteristic of\nsynaesthesia, and W reports having experienced stimuli in this way for as long as she can remember.\nDo W's negative\u00adpositive associations constitute a new subtype of synaesthesia? Although this\nis possible, a more parsimonious explanation is that the odd\u00adeven phenomenon that Flournoy (1893)\nfirst described, and that we have recently termed stimulus\u00adparity synaesthesia (White & Plassart,\nin press), may be broader than first supposed. Individuals with this subtype of synaesthesia may\nascribe all manner of dichotomous labels to eliciting stimuli: the labels that we have uncovered--odd\nand even, negative and positive--may only scratch the surface.\nReferences\nAmin, M., Olu-Lafe, O., Claessen, L.
