It also\nremains unknown as to whether there is an\noptimal cut-off value for COMP that is able\nto discriminate patients with RA from\nhealthy subjects, which would be a key\nfeature for standardizing the use of COMP\nfor the diagnosis of RA. This present case\u00ad\ncontrol study investigated the role of COMP\nin the diagnosis of patients with RA by\ncomparing it with anti-cyclic citrullinated\npeptide antibody (anti-CCP) level, which is\nanother laboratory marker that has been\nshown to be valuable in the early diagnosis\nPatients and methods\nStudy participants\nThis case\u00adcontrol study enrolled consecutive\npatients with RA, who satisfied the revised\nAmerican College of Rheumatology,25\nin the Department of Rheumatology and\nImmunology, Weifang People's Hospital,\nWeifang City, Shandong Province, China.\nThe inclusion criteria were as follows: (i)\nconfirmed diagnosis of RA; (ii) RA routine\ntreatment nai\u00a8ve; (iii) !18 years; (iv) willing-\nness to participate in the study; (v) resident\nin Weifang City for >6 months; and (vi) lack\nof osteoarthritis or any other inflammatory\narticular diseases. The exclusion criteria\nwere as follows: (i) patients with osteoarth-\nritis, rheumatic arthritis, or gouty arthritis;\n(ii) those who had received RA routine\ntreatment; (iii) <18 years; (iv) resident in\nWeifang City 6 months; (v) did not agree\nto participate in the study; (vi) suffered from\na severe form of the disease or other\nsevere diseases and could not participate in\nthe study.\nThe healthy control subjects were recruited\nfrom the Health Evaluation Clinic of Weifang\nPeople's Hospital during the same study\nperiod. They were healthy subjects with no\nhistory of rheumatic disease or autoimmune\ndisease, no other history of infectious or\nchronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases\nand they were unrelated to the patients. They\nwere matched to the patients with RA based\non sex and age ( \u00c62 years).\nThe study protocol was approved by the\nEthical Committee of Weifang People's\nwere interviewed and informed of the\nnature of the study. Each study participant,\nor their legal representative, provided writ-\nten informed consent.\nPhysical examinations and laboratory tests\nAll study participants underwent a routine\nmedical history and physical examination,\nwhich were undertaken by three Associate\nChief Physicians (F.L., X.W. & X.Z.) under\nthe supervision of an independent rheuma-\ntologist in the Department of Rheumatology\nand Immunology, Weifang People's Hospital.\nThe patients' age, disease duration, the dur-\nation of morning stiffness, joint tenderness\nindex, joint swelling index, joint activity pain\nindex, and joint resting pain index were\nrecorded.26 X-rays of the hands were under-\ntaken using an Axiom Aristos VX Plus digital\nradiography system (Siemens, Erlangen,\nGermany) in order to identify the extent of\njoint bone damage so that the stage of the\ndisease could be recorded. The stages of joint\nbone damage were defined as follows (where *\nidentifies items that are necessary for classifi-\ncation):27,28 stage I (early stage) includes (i) no\nabnormal change on X-ray examination and\n(ii) visible osteoporosis under the joint sur-\nface; stage II (interim stage) includes *(i)\nregional osteoporosis, with mild cartilage\ndamage, with or without mild subchondral\nbone destruction, *(ii) visible restricted joint\nactivities with no joint deformities, (iii) adja-\ncent muscle atrophy, and (iv) abarticular soft\ntissue lesions, e.g. nodules and tenosynovitis;\nstage III (severe stage) includes *(i) osteopor-\nosis, bone and cartilage destruction, *(ii) joint\ndeformities, such as subluxation, feet lateral\ndeflection, with no joint stiffness, (iii) a wide\nrange of muscle atrophy, and (iv) abarticular\nsoft tissue lesions with nodules and tenosyno-\nvitis; and stage IV (late stage) includes *(i)\njoint stiffness and (ii) each item included in\nstage III.\nA 5-ml sample of venous blood was\nTechnology, Guangzhou, China) before the\npatients started treatment with prednisolone\nand/or disease modifying anti-rheumatic\ndrugs. Blood samples were centrifuged at\na BY-320 C centrifuge (Baiyang Medical\nInstrument Company, Beijing, China)\nand stored at \u00c080C until analysis. The\nblood samples were analysed by routine\nmethods for erythrocyte sedimentation rate\n(ESR) (Westergren's blood sedimentation\ntube; Hull Medical Science and Technology,\nHefei, China), platelet count (PLT) (SYSMEX\nSYSMEX, Kobe, Japan) and C-reactive pro-\ntein (CRP) (IMMAGE\u00d5 800 Turbidimetric\nInhibition Immunoassay System; Beckman\nCoulter, Brea, CA, USA). Rheumatoid\nfactor (RF) was measured using the latex\nagglutination test (Rheumatoid Factor\nReagent Kit; Rongchuan Biotechnology\nCompany, Shanghai, China) and a positive\ntitre was >1/20. Anti-CCP levels were\nanalysed using an ImmunoscanCCPlus\u00d5\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\n(Euro Diagnostica, Malmo\n\u00a8 , Sweden) according\nto the manufacturer's instructions and the\nminimum detectable concentration was\n0.1 U/l. Serum COMP levels were measured\nusing the Human COMP ELISA assay\n(Kamiya Biomedical Company, Seattle,\nWA, USA) according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions. The minimum detectable\nconcentration was 0.4 ng/ml, and the\nintra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of\nvariation were both <5%.\nPatient subgroups\nThe patients with RA were divided into two\ngroups according to the information\nobtained from the physical examination,\nPatients were considered to have active\ndisease if four of five of the following items\nwere satisfied: (i) there was moderate joint\npain at rest; (ii) the duration of morning\nstiffness was !1 h; (iii) there was swelling\nof > three joints; (iv) there was pressing pain\nin > eight joints; (v) ESR > 30 mm/h or\nCRP > 8 mg/l. Patients were considered to\nbe in remission if ! five of the following\nitems were satisfied and had been in exist-\nence for !2 months: (i) the duration of\nmorning stiffness was 15 min; (ii) there is\nno lack of strength; (iii) there was no joint\npain at rest; (iv) there was no joint pain or\npressing pain when undertaking activity; (v)\nthere was no joint or sheath soft tissue\nswelling; (vi) ESR 30 mm/h (for females)\nor 20 mm/h (for males).\nThe patients with RA were divided into\ntwo groups according to the information\nthat was obtained from the X-ray imaging of\nthe patient's hands: patients with joint bony\ndamage as demonstrated by abnormal\nchanges observed on the X-ray examination\n(stages II\u00adIV); and patients without joint\nbony damage as confirmed by the lack of\nabnormal changes on the X-ray examination\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nthe SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version 19.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. Continuous data are presented\nas the mean \u00c6 SD. Differences in continuous\nvariables between groups were determined\nusing Student's t-test or the Mann\u00adWhitney\nU-test. Categorical data are presented as n of\npatients (%). Differences between categor-\nical variables were analysed using Pearson's\n2-test or Fisher's exact test. The sensitivity,\nspecificity, and positive and negative pre-\ndictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively)\nof COMP and anti-CCP for the diagnosis of\nRA were assessed. Optimum cut-off values\nare calculated to optimize sensitivity and\nspecificity (i.e. the Youden index). Receiver-\noperating characteristic (ROC) curves were\nplotted and the areas under the ROC curves\nwere calculated to assess the performance of\neach marker to distinguish RA. A P-value\n< 0.05 was considered statistically signifi-\ncant (two-tailed).\nResults\nThis case\u00adcontrol study enrolled 82 patients\nwith RA and 34 healthy control subjects.\nThere was no significant difference in the\nmean \u00c6 SD age of the group of patients with\nRA compared with the control group\nrespectively; Student's t-test).

Based\non the above findings, this present study\ndemonstrated that COMP could be a useful\nlaboratory marker for discriminating\nbetween patients with RA and healthy indi-\nviduals, and it could also be used to judge\nthe severity of the disease; findings that were\nin accordance with other research.8 A pre-\nvious study concluded that serum COMP\nwas significantly higher in patients with RA\ncompared with healthy subjects; and it was\nalso significantly higher in patients with\njoint destruction compared with those\npatients in the early stages of the disease,\nbut its levels were affected by age, disease\nduration, and body mass index.29 In con-\ntrast, another study reported a sensitivity of\nCOMP as a marker for RA.20 It has also\nbeen suggested that the usefulness of testing\nfor COMP as a marker of joint damage\nshould be confirmed by additional and\npreferably longitudinal studies.21 In add-\nition, this present study is the first to\ndemonstrate the optimal cut-off value of\nCOMP for discriminating between patients\nwith RA and healthy individuals.\nThis present study found that the serum\nCOMP level was not only a useful labora-\ntory marker for discriminating between\npatients with RA and healthy control sub-\njects, but it also discriminated between the\ndifferent stages of joint bone damage. Other\nmethods exist for the diagnosis of RA and\nfor the determination of disease severity,\nsuch as RF, CRP, ESR, anti-CCP and bone\nimaging.30,31 In this present study, the RF,\nCRP, ESR and anti-CCP levels were also\nmeasured. Although the anti-CCP levels\nwere significantly higher in the patients\nwith RA compared with the healthy control\nsubjects, its predictive accuracy was not as\nversus 0.836, respectively). There were no\nsignificant differences in RF, CRP, and ESR\nbetween the patients with RA and the\nhealthy control subjects. Anti-CCP levels\ndemonstrated a high specificity (0.824) and\nlow sensitivity (0.610) for discriminating\nbetween patients with RA and healthy con-\ntrol subjects. Another study reported that\nCRP and ESR may not reflect the early stage\nof bony damage in RA and their sensitivity\nand specialty were low when used for RA in\nclinical practice.32 The imaging features\nof bones often change during the bone\ndestructive stages of RA and bony damage\noften causes deformation.7 Thus, an early\ndiagnosis based on the results of a physical\nTable 3.

Therefore, a method with high sensitivity\nand specificity is needed for the early stage\nevaluation of bone joint dysfunction.\nIn this present study, the serum COMP\nlevel demonstrated an acceptable diagnostic\nperformance for discriminating between\npatients with RA and healthy control sub-\njects. A COMP level of 21.51 ng/ml was the\noptimal cut-off value for discriminating RA\npatients from healthy individuals. The AUC\nand when using the COMP cut-off of\npresence of RA, the percentage of correctly\nclassified patients was 81.7% (i.e. sensitivity)\nand the percentage correctly classified as not\nhaving RA was 88.2% (i.e. specificity).\nHowever, it should be noted that COMP\nlevels can be influenced by factors such as\nmuscle mass, sex, age and diet.7\nThis present study had several limita-\ntions. First, the sample was selected from a\ncity-level hospital, which may cause some\nlimitations in the extrapolation of results;\nthus, when extrapolating the results of this\nstudy, the representativeness of the sample\nshould be considered. Secondly, the patients\nin the study had RA with a relatively long\ndisease duration, so the individual's COMP\nvalues may have been affected by multiple\nfactors, which might have then influenced\nthe optimal cut-off value.\nIn conclusion, this present study demon-\nstrated that serum COMP levels have the\npotential to be used as a biological marker\nof cartilage metabolism in RA. To our\nknowledge, this is the first study to demon-\nstrate the diagnostic ability of COMP for\ndifferentiating between patients with RA\nand healthy individuals. These findings\nalso indicated that a cut-off value of\nuseful for the discriminating between\npatients with RA and healthy individuals.\nThe monitoring of COMP levels in serum\ncould also be a helpful method for assessing\nthe presence and progression of RA.\n"
