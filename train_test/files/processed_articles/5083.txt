However, the potential anti-cancer activity and mechanism of H cordata for human liver cancer cells is not well understood.\nRecently, we identified hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1A, Forkhead box (FOX)O3, and MEF2A as proapoptotic factors induced\nby H cordata, suggesting that HIF-1A, FOXO3, and MEF2A contribute to the apoptosis of HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells.\nFOXO3 transcription factors regulate target genes involved in apoptosis. H cordata significantly increased the mRNA and protein\nexpression of HIF-1A and FOXO3 and stimulated MEF2A expression in addition to increased apoptosis in HepG2 cells within 24\nhours. Therefore, we determined the potential role of FOXO3 on apoptosis and on H cordata\u00adinduced MEF2A in HepG2 cells.\nHIF-1A silencing by siRNA attenuated MEF2A and H cordata\u00admediated FOXO3 upregulation in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, H\ncordata\u00admediated MEF2A expression enhanced caspase-3 and caspase-7, which were abolished on silencing FOXO3 with siRNA.\nIn addition, H cordata inhibited growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts in nude mice. Taken together, our results\ndemonstrate that H cordata enhances HIF-1A/FOXO3 signaling, leading to MEF2A upregulation in HepG2 cells, and in parallel, it\ndisturbs the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins (Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL), which results in apoptosis. Taken together, these findings\ndemonstrate that H cordata promotes the activation of HIF-1A\u00adFOXO3 and MEF2A pathways to induce apoptosis in human\nHepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells and is, therefore, a promising candidate for antitumor drug development.\n",

The data herein\nclearly showed that H cordata triggers the activation of HIF-\n1A\u00adFOXO3 and MEF2A pathways and the caspase-3- and\ncaspase-7-mediated pathways to cause cancer cell death.\nMethods\nPlant Material, Extraction, and Fractionation\nThe dried whole plant of H cordata Thunb was procured\nfrom Hanwoori Herbs Company (Seoul, Korea). A voucher\nCollection for Type Cultures and Biological Resource\nCenter in the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and\nBiotechnology (Jeongeup, Jeollabuk, Korea). Dried whole\nplants of H cordata (100 g) were extracted with 1 L of\nmethanol (MeOH) in a shaking incubator at room tempera-\nture for 24 hours. The residue was re-extracted twice under\nthe same conditions. The resulting extract was filtered\nthrough a 0.45-\u00b5m filter, evaporated to dryness using a vac-\nuum rotary evaporator (Rotavapor, Switzerland) at 80\u00b0C,\nand weighed (6.002 g W/W, dry base) to determine the yield\nof soluble constituents. The crude dried MeOH extract was\nthen suspended in water and partitioned by ethyl acetate\nLC-MS Analysis of H cordata Extract\nAgilent 6410B Triple Quadrupole liquid chromatography\nmass spectroscopy (LC MS; Agilent Technologies,\nWilmington, DE) equipped with an Electrospray ionization\n(ESI) source was used for the analysis. Sample weighing 100\nmg was mixed with 1 mL of MeOH and centrifuged.Aliquots\nof 5 \u00b5L of the processed samples were injected into the HPLC\nsystem (1200 Series LC, Agilent Technologies) fitted with\nand a source temperature of 380\u00b0C. Capillary voltage, cone\nvoltage, and source offset were set at 3 kV, 30 kV, and 30 V,\nrespectively. The gas flow of desolvation and the cone was set\nmobile phase composed of 0.1% formic acid in distilled water\n(buffer A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (buffer B) was\nused to separate the analysis specimens and pumped into the\nESI chamber at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min for 20 minutes.\nFragmentor voltage and collision voltage were set at 90 and\n20 V, respectively. Detection of the sample was carried out in\nthe multiple-reaction monitoring mode (MRM) by monitor-\nCell Culture\nHuman liver HepG2 hepatocellular cells were purchased from\ntheAmerican Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA).\nCells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v)\nFBS (Gibco/Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and 1% (w/v)\npenicillin-streptomycin (Gibco/Invitrogen) in a 37\u00b0C incuba-\ntor with 5% (v/v) CO\nin a humidified atmosphere. Cells were\ngrown to confluence, trypsinized, and then sub-cultured.\nFluorescence-Assisted Cytometric Spectroscopy\nTo detect apoptosis, propidium iodide (PI)-annexin-V stain-\ning was performed using an Annexin-V-FLUOS Staining\nKit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly,\nHepG2 cells were treated with 1 and 10 \u00b5g/mL of H cordata\nEtOAc fraction for 24 hours, harvested, and washed twice\nwith phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The cell suspension\nthen incubated with 0.2 mg/mLAnnexin-V-FLUOS and 1.4\nmg/mL PI for 15 minutes at room temperature. Staining was\nmeasured using an Image Cytometer (NUCLEOCOUNTER\nNC-3000, ChemoMetec, Copenhagen, Denmark) at an\ndetect Annexin-V and a 670 nm high-pass filter to detect PI.\nAcquired Nuclear Fraction\nHepG2 cells were prepared by incubation with a medium\nfor 2 days. The cells were scraped, and 2 mL was added per\ndish of homogenization buffer A (25 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 2\nmM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitor\nhomogenized 15 times using a 15-mL Dounce homogenizer\nThe supernatant cytosolic fraction was transferred into a\nnew tube, and 500 \u00b5L of homogenization buffer B (homog-\nenization buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100) was added\nto the pellet. The pellet was resuspended by sonication,\nincubated for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C by rocking, and centrifuged\ntion was transferred into a fresh tube. The protein contents\nof the cytosolic and nuclear fractions were determined\nusing a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (Thermo\nScientific, Rockford, IL) and analyzed by western blotting\nagainst anti--catenin antibodies.\nWestern Blot Analysis\nHepG2 cells were treated with H cordata EtOAc fraction (1\nand 10 \u00b5g/mL) for 24 hours, harvested, and washed twice\nwith PBS. The cells were lysed using a lysis buffer from\niNtRON (Seoul, Korea), and protein concentration was\ndetermined using a BCAprotein assay kit (Pierce Chemical,\nRockford, IL, USA), according to the manufacturer's proto-\ncol. Then, 30 \u00b5g of denatured proteins were separated using\n10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred\nonto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were\nblocked for 1 hour with 5% (w/v) skimmed milk in 0.1%\nTween-20 and Tris-buffered saline (TTBS). They were then\nincubated with diluted (1:1000) primary antibodies against\nBax, Bcl-2, Bid, tBid, caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-9,\np-AKT, and PARP (all from Cell Signaling Technologies,\nBeverly, MA) and AKT, FOXO3, HIF-1A, MEF2A, and\np-FOXO3 (all from Abcam, Cambridge, MA). The mem-\nbranes were washed thrice with TTBS for 5 minutes, fol-\nlowed by incubation with diluted horseradish\nperoxidase\u00adconjugated goat antimouse or rabbit antigoat\nroom temperature for 1 hour. The membranes were then\nrinsed thrice with TTBS for 5 minutes, and an enhanced\nchemiluminescence system (Thermo Scientific, San Jose,\nCA) was used to visualize the bands on a ChemiDoc MP\nsystem (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).\nRNA Extraction\nTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life\nTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufactur-\ner's protocol. RNase-free DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI)\nwas used to reduce the DNA contamination. Total RNA\nconcentration and purity were determined by measuring the\n(RNA samples with ratios greater than 1.8 were used for the\nanalyses). The integrity of the RNA samples was also ascer-\ntained by analyzing 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA using a\nBioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Santa\nClara, CA).\nGene Expression Profiles\nFor microarray analysis, HepG2 cells (1 \u00d7 106 cells) were\nseeded into 100-mm-diameter cell culture dishes. After 24\nhours, the cells were treated with 1 or 10 \u00b5g/mL H cordata\nextract for 6 hours. For control and test RNAs, synthesis of\ntarget cRNAs and hybridization were performed using the\nLow RNA Input Linear Amplification Kit PLUS (Agilent\nTechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nBriefly, 0.5 \u00b5g total RNA from each sample was mixed with\ndiluted Spike Mix and T7 Promoter Primer Mix followed\nby incubation at 65\u00b0C for 10 minutes. cDNA Master Mix\n(5\u00d7 first-strand buffer, 0.1 M DTT, 10 mM dNTP mix,\nRNase-Out, and M-MLV reverse transcriptase enzyme) was\nprepared and added to the reaction mixture. Amplified and\nlabeled cRNA was purified on RNase Mini Spin Columns\n(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's\nprotocol. The labeled cRNA target was quantified using an\nND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies,\nWilmington, DE). After checking labeling efficiency, each\n750-ng sample of cyanine 3\u00adlabeled and cyanine 5\u00adlabeled\ncRNA target was mixed, and cRNA fragmentation was per-\nformed by adding 10\u00d7 blocking agent, 25\u00d7 fragmentation\nbuffer, and incubating at 60\u00b0C for 30 minutes. The frag-\nmented cRNA was resuspended in 2\u00d7 hybridization buffer\nand directly pipetted onto an assembled Agilent Human GE\n4x44K microarray. The arrays were hybridized at 65\u00b0C for\n17 hours using an Agilent hybridization oven. The hybrid-\nized microarrays were washed according to the manufac-\nturer's washing protocol (Agilent Technology).\nData Acquisition and Analysis\nThe hybridized images were analyzed by an Agilent DNA\nmicroarray scanner, and data quantification was performed\nusing the Agilent Feature Extraction software. The average\nfluorescence intensity for each spot was calculated, and\nlocal background was subtracted. All data normalization and\nselection of fold-changed genes were performed using\nGeneSpring GX 7.3 (Agilent Technology). Genes were fil-\ntered by removing the flagged-out genes in each experiment.\nIntensity-dependent normalization (Lowess) was performed,\nwhere the ratio was reduced to the residual of the Lowess fit\nof the intensity versus ratio curve. The means of the normal-\nized ratios were calculated by dividing the average of nor-\nmalizedsignalchannelintensitybytheaverageofnormalized\ncontrol channel intensity. Functional annotation of genes\nwas performed according to criteria of the Gene Ontology\nConsortium (http://www.geneontology.org/index.shtml)\nusing GeneSpring GX 7.3. Gene classification was based on\nsearches performed on BioCarta (http://www.biocarta.\ncom/), Database for Annotation, Visualization, and\nIntegrated Discovery (DAVID; http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.\ngov/), and MEDLINE databases (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.\ngov/). Bioinformatic gene network analyses were performed\nusing IPA (http://www.ingenuity.com) to examine the bio-\nlogical functions of differentially regulated genes and pro-\nteins according to ontology-related interaction networks.\nIPAprovides protein interaction networks based on the regu-\nlarly updated \"ingenuity pathways knowledgebase.\" The\nnetwork is optimized to include as many proteins from the\ninput expression profile as possible and aims to produce\nhighly connected networks.\nReal-Time PCR\nThe sequences of forward and reverse primers for FOXO3\n5-ACA TGG GCT TGA GTG AGT CC-3 and (reverse)\nward) 5-TGCATC TCCATC TCC TAC CC-3 and (reverse)\nward) 5-TCA GCT CTC TTG TTG CTG GA-3 and\n(reverse) 5-AAA TCG GTT CGG ACT TGA TG-3. The\n5-GGT CTC CTC TGA CTT CAA CA-3, and the reverse\nprimer sequence was 5-AGC CAA ATT CGT TGT CAT\nAC-3. Total RNA (1 \u00b5g) was reverse transcribed to cDNA\naccording to the manufacturer's instructions (M-MLV\nReverse Transcriptase; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Reactions\nwere carried out on an ABI Prism\u00ae 7900HT Sequence\nDetection System (PEApplied Biosystems, Foster City, CA),\nand relative transcript levels were determined using GAPDH\nas the endogenous control (SYBR Green method). Each reac-\ntion was performed in triplicate. Thermal cycling conditions\nusing the Sequence Detection System software (SDS version\n2.0, PE Applied Biosystems).\nBiochemical Analysis\nSmall interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were purchased from ST\nPharm (Seoul, Korea). The nucleotide sequence for HIF-1A\nwas performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in accordance with the manufac-\nturer's instructions. Cells were then treated with 10 \u00b5g/mL H\ncordata for 48 hours.\nTumor Xenograft Experiment\nFor tumor xenograft experiments, 1 \u00d7 106 HepG2 cells sus-\npended in DMEM were injected subcutaneously into the\nhind limb of 5-week-old nude (nu/nu Balb/c) mice, which\nwere then treated with PBS (6mice) or 20mg/kg H cordata\nEtOAc fraction (6\nmice) once daily for 20\ndays. The mice\nwere housed in a facility approved by the Association for\nAssessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care\non a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle with food and water\nad libitum. The mice were killed humanely 21 days postin-\njection. Tumors were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in\nPBS. The animal study was reviewed and approved by the\nInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Korea\nBasic Science Institute.\nImmunohistochemistry\nA 5-mm-thick section was cut across the dorsoventral diam-\neter of the tumor and fixed in ice-cold 10% paraformalin\novernight and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections (4-\u00b5m\nthick) were cut and processed for immunohistological stain-\ning. Paraffin sections on the microslides were deparaf-\nfinized in xylene and rehydrated in sequential ethanol baths.\nAntigen retrieval was achieved by incubation with 10mM\ncitrate buffer (pH\n6.0) in a domestic microwave oven at\n700W for 30minutes. The slides were quenched in hydro-\ngen peroxide (3%) to block endogenous peroxidase activity\nM, pH\n7.6). The slides were\nblocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1hour at room tempera-\nture and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies\nBiotin kit (Dako) based on the avidin-biotin peroxidase\ncomplex method was used for detection, and slides were\ncounterstained with hematoxylin. Slides were dehydrated in\nsequential ethanol baths, rinsed with xylene, and mounted\nwith Permount (ThermoFisher, Pittsburgh, PA).\nImage Acquisition and Protein Quantification\nSamples were analyzed with a Zeiss AxioImagerZ1 micros-\ncopy system with a charge-coupled device camera and the\nTissueFAXS automated acquisition system (TissueGnostics,\nVienna, Austria). The percentages of antibody-positive and\nstemness marker\u00adpositive tumors were determined and\ndepicted as scattergrams. Images were digitalized, and pro-\ntein expression was quantified. Statistical analysis was per-\nformed with the HistoQuest software (TissueGnostics).\nStatistical Analysis\nFor gene expression profiles obtained by microarray, data\nanalysis was performed using GeneSpring GX version 7.3\n(Agilent Technologies). Differentially expressed genes\nwere identified using the Student's t-test with a P-value cut-\noff of .05 and a fold-change threshold of 2.0. One-way anal-\nysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine significant\ndifferences between untreated control and treated samples.\nReverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction\n(RT-PCR) results were expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD from at\nleast 3 independent experiments. Data were analyzed using\nStudent's t-test. P values <.05 were considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nQuantification of H cordata Extract\nLC-MS/MS analysis of H cordata extract revealed the pres-\nence of 5 compounds in the EtOAc, including neochlorogenic\nacid, myricitrin, 2-O-acetylquercitrin, 6-O-acetylgenistin,\nand thalifendine (Figure 1).\nEffect of H cordata Extract on Cell Death\nThe effect of H cordata extract on cell death was analyzed\nquantitatively using PI staining followed by flow cytometry\n(Figure 2A). Specifically, the relative proportion of viable\nand apoptotic cells can be measured on costaining with\nannexin V. Treatment of HepG2 cells with 1 and 10 \u00b5g/mL\nH cordata extract led to the induction of late apoptosis. The\nproportion of apoptotic cells increased dramatically from\nmL of H cordata extract. However, no changes were\nobserved after treatment with 1 \u00b5g/mL of H cordata extract\napoptotic cells). Thus, HepG2 cells appeared to be sensitive\nto H cordata extract when used at 10 \u00b5g/mL.\nEffect of H cordata Extract on Expression of\nApoptotic Proteins\nHepG2 liver carcinoma cells expressed Bax, Bcl-2, Bid,\ntBid, caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-9, and PARP. Based on\nthe observation that H cordata extract induces apoptosis in\nHepG2 cells, we examined the expression of apoptosis-\nrelated signaling proteins using western blot analysis\n(Figure 2B). H cordata extract treatment activated cas-\npase-3- and caspase-7-mediated apoptosis. The expression\nof inactive caspase-3 (35 kDa) was decreased and that of\nactive caspase-3 (17 kDa) increased with increasing con-\ncentrations of H cordata extract (Figure 2B). Other pro-\napoptotic markers, such as Bax, increased slightly, whereas\nthe antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 showed decreased expres-\nsion following H cordata extract treatment.\nEffect of H cordata Extract on Gene Expression\nProfiles\nTo identify the potential genes involved in the anticancer\nactivity of H cordata, we performed a gene expression\nmicroarray in HepG2 hepatocellular cancer cells after treat-\nment with H cordata extract. Among the 41\ngenes (using Agilent's Human GE 4x44K Microarray)\nFigure 1. Quantification of Houttuynia cordata extract. Multiple reaction monitoring is the most common mode of using a triple\nquadrupole LC-MS for quantitative analysis; 100 mg of extract was mixed with 1 mL of methanol.

Among these 18\nwith both 1 and 10 \u00b5g/mL H cordata extracts compared\nwith the untreated control at 6 hours. Conversely, these\nThe genes that were upregulated or downregulated by more\nthan 2-fold were significantly handled in data mining\ncategories.\nBiologically relevant features were constructed using the\nDAVID tools (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/). Gene lists cor-\nresponding to 2-fold up- and downregulation in the H cordata\nextract\u00adinduced liver cancer cells were uploaded to DAVID\nforGeneOntologyanalysis(Figure3Aleftpanel).Upregulated\ngenes included those involved in the regulation of mRNAtran-\nscription, cell cycle, apoptosis, and chromosome segregation.\nDownregulated genes included those involved in chromosome\norganization, negative regulation of cell proliferation, and\nresponse to stress. To compare the results obtained on H cor-\ndata extract treatment with potential genes that are involved in\napoptosis, we identified candidate genes using the GeneCards\ndatabase (http://www.genecards.org/). The intersection\nobtained by hierarchical clustering is presented along with the\ngene lists in Figure 3A (right panel). The signal network of\napoptotic genes in response to glucose is shown in Figure 3B.\nFigure 2. Analysis of apoptosis in HepG2 cells using flow cytometry and western blotting. (A) Effect of Houttuynia cordata extract\non cell death. The proportion of apoptotic cells increased dramatically from 25.7% in control (Ctl) cells to 86.6% in cells treated with\n10 \u00b5g/mL of H cordata extract. However, no changes were observed after treatment with 1 \u00b5g/mL of H cordata extract (13.4%-15.7%\nearly apoptotic cells and 24.4%-25.7% late apoptotic cells). Cells were double stained with propidium iodide and annexin V.

A dendrogram of\nhierarchical clustering revealed the apoptosis genes induced by H cordata extract at 1 and 10 \u00b5g/mL compared with the control (ctl).\nThe red and green colors represent >2-fold up- and downregulated genes, respectively. (B) Colored nodes as determined by IPA\n(Qiagen) are the genes in the apoptosis regulatory network in HepG2 cells (A).\nEffect of H cordata Extract on Expression of\nTranscriptional Regulators\nUpstream regulator analysis using IPA identified the\nupstream regulators (transcription regulators) of the apop-\ntotic network (eg,AHR, BRCA1, FOXO3, HIF-1A, MDM2,\nMEF2A, and MEF2C) when comparing H cordata extract\ntreatment to untreated cells (control; Figure 4A). Based on\nthe microarray results, the expression levels of 3 upstream\nregulators (transcription regulators: FOXO3, HIF-1A, and\nMEF2A) were evaluated using RT-PCR. RT-PCR evalua-\ntion indicated that the expression levels of these upstream\nrespectively) in a time-dependent manner on treatment with\n1 and 10 \u00b5g/mL of H cordata extract, especially FOXO3 at\n6 and 24 hours, when compared with controls (Figure 4B).\nH cordata Regulated the Expression and\nIntracellular Localization of FOXO3\nTo investigate whether H cordata affected the expression of\nFOXO3 and HIF-1A, we analyzed the levels of HIF-1A,\nFOXO3, and MEF2A in HepG2 cells under treatment with H\ncordata. Western blot assay revealed that H cordata signifi-\ncantly enhanced the expression of HIF-1A, FOXO3 (all\nnucleus and cytosol), and MEF2A in a time-dependent man-\nner within 6 to 24 hours (Figure 5A). Akt can phosphorylate\nFOXO transcription factors, which stimulates proteasomal\ndegradation. Therefore, we investigated the levels of Akt\nphosphorylation (p-Akt) and also examined whether p-Akt\naffected FOXO3 activation. p-Akt was significantly decreased\nin HepG2 cells under H cordata treatment (Figure 5A).\nFOXO3 Affects the Expression of Bcl-2 Family\nof Proteins in HepG2 Cells Treated With H\ncordata\nTo assess the apoptotic process, we performed western blot\nanalysis to evaluate the potential effect of FOXO3 on protein\nlevels of the Bcl-2 family. Our results revealed that FOXO3\nsilencing increased Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression, whereas it\ndecreased Bax, indicating that FOXO3 regulated the transcrip-\ntion levels of the Bcl-2 protein family (Figure 5B). These data\nsuggested that the HIF-1A FOXO3 pathway is responsible for\nH cordata\u00adinduced disturbance of Bcl-2 family of proteins.\nHIF-1A Modulated H cordata\u00adInduced FOXO3\nExpression in HepG2 Cells\nTo investigate the effect of HIF-1A on H cordata\u00admediated\nexpression of FOXO transcription factors, we inhibited\nHIF-1A activation by siRNA. Western blot results revealed\nthat HIF-1A expression increased rapidly in HepG2 cells\nFigure 4. Gene expression of transcriptional regulators of apoptotic genes. Relative expression levels of Forkhead box (FOX)O3\n(A), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1A (B), and MEF2A (C) genes were determined by RT-PCR. Each value represents mean \u00b1 SD of\ntriplicate experiments. *P < .05, **P < .01 compared with control (ctl).\nunder H cordata treatment, which was reduced after tran-\nsient transfection with HIF-1A siRNA (Figure 6A). Western\nblot assay demonstrated that H cordata increased FOXO3\nand p-FOXO3 protein levels, which were abolished on\nHIF-1A silencing (Figure 6A), indicating that HIF-1A\nincreased FOXO3 transcription. Moreover, FOXO3\nincreased Bax expression, whereas decreasing Bcl-2 and\nBcl-xL expressions were also reversed by HIF-1A silencing\n(Figure 6A). These data indicate that H cordata\u00adinduced\nFOXO3 expression in HepG2 cells was modulated at least\nin part by HIF-1A and that HIF-1A increases FOXO3 tran-\nscription during apoptosis.\nFigure 5.Houttuynia cordata promotes activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1A Forkhead box (FOX)O3 pathways by\nregulating Akt/PKB signaling.

These data indicate that FOXO3 contributes to H cor-\ndata\u00adinduced MEF2A expression. We analyzed the\nexpression of MEF2A and apoptotic proteins in HepG2\ncells transfected with FOXO3 siRNA. As shown in Figure\n6B, FOXO3 silencing significantly reduced MEF2A, cas-\npase-3, and caspase-7. MEF2A silencing also reduced cas-\npase-3 and caspase-7 expression. These data indicate that\nFOXO3 upregulates MEF2A expression, resulting in apop-\ntosis induced via caspase-3 and caspase-7 activation.\nEffect of H cordata EtOAc Fraction on\nExpression of MEF2A, HIF-1A, and FOXO3 in\nHuman Hepatocellular Carcinoma Xenografts\nWe next assessed whether there was increased expression of\nMEF2A, HIF-1A, and FOXO3 in in vivo xenograft models.\nTheexpressionsofMEF2A,HIF-1A,andFOXO3wereslightly\nincreased by H cordata EtOAc fraction in HepG2 xenografts at\n20days compared with untreated controls (Figure 7).\nDiscussion\nThis study examined the biological effects of H cordata on\nhuman liver HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. We per-\nformed a cytotoxicity test to calculate the 50% growth\ninhibitory (GI\n) concentration of H cordata using an MTT\nassay to determine the challenging dose for microarray\nanalysis. After 24 hours of incubation, the H cordata extract\nFigure 6. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1A promotes the activation of MEF2A pathway directly and indirectly via Forkhead box\n(FOX)O3.

We determined the effects of H cordata on the cell\ncycle and on cell death after incubation of HepG2 cells with\nthe H cordata extract for 24 hours. H cordata extract at 10\n\u00b5g/mL induced a significant increase in HepG2 apoptosis\n(Figure 2A). Apoptosis of HepG2 cells by H cordata extract\nwas also associated with downregulation of antiapoptotic\nBcl-2 and upregulation of proapoptotic Bax protein expres-\nsion. H cordata extract treatment induced proteolytic acti-\nvation of caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9 protein\nexpression (Figure 2B). These results were inconsistent\nwith those of a previous study demonstrating that H cordata\nextract induces proteolytic activation of caspase-36 in\nhuman lung cancer A549 cells. The apoptotic signaling\npathway was also observed in HepG2 cells treated with H\ncordata extract in a microarray (Figure 3). Interestingly,\nmany kinds of transcriptional regulators were induced after\ntreatment with H cordata extract (Figure 4A). The expres-\nsion levels of these transcriptional regulators--such as\nFOXO3 (red-colored node in Figure 4A), HIF-1A (red-col-\nored node in Figure 4A), and MEF2A--in the H cordata\nextract\u00adtreated HepG2 cells were confirmed by RT-PCR\nand western blot in a dose- and time-dependent manner\n(Figure 4B, 5A). The expressions of MEF2A, HIF-1A, and\nFOXO3 were also slightly increased in xenografts (Figure\n7). These findings suggest the possibility that HIF-1A,\nFOXO3, and MEF2A function are significant regulators in\nH cordata\u00admediated apoptosis of HepG2 cells. Parody\net al20 reported that FOXO3, a member of the FOXO family,\ntriggers the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in the rat pre-\nneoplastic liver through modulation by interferon 2b. To\nour knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the role of\nHIF-1A and FOXO3 in H cordata\u00adinduced cancer cell\napoptosis.Thus, the underlying mechanism of HIF-1A and\nFOXO3 pathways in H cordata\u00adinduced cancer cell apop-\ntosis is still not fully understood. In this study, we revealed\nthat FOXO3 upregulated Bax and downregulated Bcl-2\n(Figure 5B) and that HIF-1A increased FOXO3 expression\nunder H cordata treatment (Figure 6A). Furthermore, acti-\nvation of the transcription factor FOXO3 causes MEF2A to\ninduce the activation of casapse-3, caspase-7, and Bax, in\naddition to disturbing the expression of Bcl-2 family pro-\nteins, which are critical mediators of apoptosis in HepG2\ncells (Figure 5B, 6B). In mammals, the ability of FOXO\nfactors to mediate cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apop-\ntosis makes them attractive as tumor suppressor candi-\ndates.17,19 In this study, we investigated FOXO3 expression\nin HepG2 cells and identified a novel connection between\nFOXO3 and H cordata\u00adinduced apoptosis. siRNA-medi-\nated HIF-1A inhibition also attenuated p-FOXO3 (Figure\n6A). FOXO transcription factors can be phosphorylated by\nAkt, a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase. p-Akt atten-\nuates FOXO3 translocation into the nucleus, its binding\nwith 14-3-3 protein, and eventual proteasomal degradation.\nOur results revealed that H cordata attenuated p-Akt in a\ntime-dependent manner (Figure 5A) and that H cordata\nFigure 7.

Tumor tissues were collected in 10% ice-cold paraformaldehyde and paraffin-embedded blocks were prepared for\nimmunohistochemistry of MEF2A, HIF-1A, and FOXO3.

Based on these results and previous\nstudies, we speculated that MEF2A functions as a signifi-\ncant regulator in H cordata\u00admediated apoptosis of HepG2\ncells. Thus, activation of the ROS-p38 axis is responsible\nfor MEF2A expression, suggesting that the ROS-p38-\nMEF2 pathway becomes proapoptotic on excessive cas-\npase-3 and caspase-7 activation. Taken together, the\nmultipathway proapoptotic function and the unique acti-\nvation of HIF-1A\u00adFOXO3 and MEF2A pathways suggest\nthat H cordata may be a promising natural product extract\nfor potential use in liver cancer. We found that H cordata\ninduces apoptosis through the activation of transcription\nregulators, such as HIF-1A, FOXO3, and MEF2A. It will\nalso be important to identify the precise cellular targets of\nH cordata, which may help further elucidate the mecha-\nnisms of its antitumor functions and contribute to the\ndevelopment of more effective anticancer drugs.\nConclusions\nOur results demonstrate that H cordata\u00admediated HIF-1A\nupregulates MEF2A directly and also indirectly via\nFOXO3 in HepG2 cells. Thus, we have demonstrated\nthat H cordata shows anticancer activity in liver cancer\ncells by inducing apoptosis through activation of tran-\nscription regulators, such as HIF-1A, FOXO3, and\nMEF2A. These findings not only suggest that an EtOAc\nfraction derived from H cordata is a promising natural\nextract for potential use in liver cancer therapy, but also\ndemonstrate that exploring compounds capable of induc-\ning apoptosis and activity of upstream transcription regu-\nlators is a promising strategy for drug discovery against\nliver cancer.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: this\nwork was supported by a grant from the Wonkwang University in\nReferences\n1.
