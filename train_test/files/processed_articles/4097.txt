    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground. Lower breast density (BD) is associated with lower risk of breast cancer and may serve as a biomarker for the\nefficacy of chemopreventive strategies. This review explores parameters that are thought to be associated with lower BD. We\nconducted a systematic review of articles published to date using the PRISMA strategy. Articles that assessed change in BD\nwith estrogen-receptor modulators (tamoxifene [TAM], raloxifene [RLX], and tibolone) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs), as well\nas cross-sectional and longitudinal studies (LSs) that assessed association between BD and physical activity (PA) or diet were\nreviewed. Results. Ten studies assessed change in BD with TAM; all reported TAM-mediated BD decreases. Change in BD with\nRLX was assessed by 11 studies; 3 reported a reduction in BD. Effect of tibolone was assessed by 5 RCTs; only 1 reported change\nin BD. AI-mediated BD reduction was reported by 3 out of 10 studies. The association between PA and BD was assessed by\n21 studies; 4 reported an inverse association. The relationship between diet and BD was assessed in 34 studies. All studies on\ncalcium and vitamin D as well as vegetable intake reported an inverse association with BD in premenopausal women. Two RCTs\ndemonstrated BD reduction with a low-fat, high-carbohydrate intervention. Conclusion. TAM induces BD reduction; however,\nthe effect of RLX, tibolone, and AIs on BD is unclear. Although data on association between diet and BD in adulthood are\ncontradictory, intake of vegetables, vitamin D, and calcium appear to be associated with lower BD in premenopausal women.\n",

Regardless of these conten-\ntions, high mammographic BD (MBD) has been shown to\nbe associated with BC risk and interval cancer.4 Importantly,\nBD is regarded as a modifiable risk factor for BC8,9 and,\ntherefore, may be an important biomarker for the effect of\ninterventions on BC risk.\nIdentifying the relationship between MBD and interven-\ntions that modify BD requires reliable and reproducible\nmethods for MBD assessment. Currently, area-based and\nvolumetric approaches exist for MBD assessment.6,7 The\nqualitative area-based methods classify MBD into different\ncategories based on subjective opinion, using features such\nas area covered by dense tissue and ductal prominence.

Ekpo, BSc (Hons)1,2, Patrick C. Brennan, PhD1,\nClaudia Mello-Thoms, PhD1, and Mark F. McEntee, PhD1\n Keywords\ntamoxifene, raloxifene, tibolone, letrozole, anastrozole, exercise\ninclude the Wolfe, Boyd and Tabr methods, along with the\nVisual Analogue Scale and breast imaging reporting and\ndata system (BI-RADS).6,7 Semiautomated area-based\nmethods such as planimetry, Cumulus, and Madena use\nthresholding and segmentation techniques to measure per-\ncentage mammographic density (PMD). Automated area-\nbased methods use thresholding and/or statistical modeling\nto estimate PMD and include texture-based approaches,\nAutodensity, and MedDensity.6 Volumetric approaches use\nstatistical or physical modeling to calculate volumetric BD\n(VBD). Volumetric approaches include calibration tech-\nniques, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, Cumulus V, and 3\nphysics model\u00adbased volumetric techniques: Standard\nMammographic Form, Volpara, and Quantra.6,7\nMany studies have attempted to assess the relationship\nbetween BD and specific clinical interventions such as\nestrogen-receptor modulators,8-11 aromatase inhibitors\nthe nature and magnitude of the relationship between BD\nand these interventions is unclear. Furthermore, the cate-\ngory of women (age, ethnicity, body mass index [BMI], and\nmenopausal status) in which these parameters are more\neffective is unclear. This lack of clarity underscores the\nneed for a review of interventions that are thought to have\nan impact on BD, given the role of BD as an intermediate\nand potentially modifiable risk factor for BC.5,8,9\nIncreasingly, BD notification legislations have been passed\nin 22 states in the United States,32 and BD details are being\nmade available to screened women. The benefit of BD noti-\nfication to women will only be accrued when such data are\naccompanied with clear information about BD and cancer\nas well as information about parameters that are associated\nwith lower BD and cancer risk. Therefore, this review\nexamines the effect of estrogen-receptor modulators such as\ntamoxifene (TAM), raloxifene (RLX), and tibolone as well\nas AIs such as letrozole, anastrozole, and exemestane on\nBD. It also explores the association between BD and param-\neters such as PA and diet.\nMaterials and Methods\nSearch Strategy\nThe Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and\nMeta-Analysis (PRISMA) strategy was used to search for\narticles published to date using MEDLINE, EMBASE,\nCINAHL (Ebscohost), PubMed, Cochrane library, Web of\nScience, and Scopus databases. We also conducted a Google\nsearch, and reference lists of published articles were exam-\nined to identify additional articles not found in the database\nsearch. The search was conducted in the English language.\nTo systematically search for literature of interest, a combina-\ntion of search terms was used; these were thematically\nrelated to our hypothesis and also common themes identified\nthrough preliminary search of the literature. These were\n\"breast density reduction interventions,\" \"breast density\nmodifiers,\" \"breast density and estrogen-receptor modula-\ntors,\" \"breast density and tamoxifene,\" \"breast density and\nraloxifene,\" \"breast density and tibolone,\" \"breast density\nand letrozole,\" \"breast density and anastrozole,\" \"breast\ndensity and exemestane,\" \" breast density and aromatase\ninhibitors,\" \"breast density and physical activity,\" \"exercise\nand breast density,\" \"breast density and diet.\"\nInclusion Criteria\nArticles were included if they were randomized controlled\ntrials (RCTs), case-control studies (CCSs), or cohort studies\n(CSs) that investigated change in BD with interventions.\nLongitudinal studies (LSs) and cross-sectional studies\n(CSSs) that assessed association between BD and parame-\nters such as PA and diet were also included. Articles were\nalso included if they were published in the English lan-\nguage. Articles that did not fulfill the above criteria were\nexcluded, as were reviews and case reports.\nData Synthesis\nData extraction was performed independently by 2 review-\ners, with differences of opinion resolved by discussion. No\narticle needed to be excluded for reasons of differences of\nopinion between reviewers; however, had consensus not\nbeen reached, articles would have been excluded. For each\nstudy, reviewers extracted information using the Participant\nIntervention Comparator and Outcomes (PICOS) method\n(Table 1). Studies that assessed BD from RCTs or were a\nsubset of RCTs were considered RCTs in the current review.\nStudies were qualitatively assessed for quality and risk of\nbias based on study-specific design (clarity of protocol,\nassessment and report of compliance, blinding of outcome\nassessors, and outcome measures); this enabled us to\nappraise the conduct of each study. Table 1 shows eligibility\ncriteria for inclusion of studies.\nResults\nThe search strategy identified 1853 publications, from\nwhich 156 eligible articles were found. Of these, 48 were\nduplicates, and 21 did not fulfil the inclusion criteria and\nwere excluded, resulting in 87 articles that fulfilled the\ninclusion criteria. Of the articles that fulfilled inclusion cri-\nteria, 22 were on selective estrogen-receptor modulators\n(SERMs), 2 were on SERMs and AIs, 8 were on AIs alone,\nOf the studies on estrogen-receptor modulators, 10\nassessed change in BD with TAM intervention and included\nof RCTs.33-38 The sample sizes of the 10 studies ranged from\nmenopausal and postmenopausal women, with heterogene-\nity in criteria for ascertaining menopausal status. Most of\nthe studies administered 20 mg of TAM per day, and total\nduration of TAM administration varied from 1.5 to 6 years.\nAlso, 7 studies used area-based qualitative and/or quantita-\ntive approaches for MBD assessment, and 1 assessed fibro-\nglandular volume with MRI. Only 4 studies adjusted for\nconfounding factors that affect BD.8-10,35 All studies reported\nTAM-mediated BD decreases (Table 2).\nA total of 9 studies assessed change in BD with RLX\nalone,39-47 and 2 studies assessed tibolone and RLX inter-\nwomen. Most of the studies administered 60 mg of RLX per\nday, and the duration of the RLX administration varied\nfrom 3 months to 3 years. Area-based methods were used\nfor MBD assessment in a majority of the studies, and 1\nstudy measured fibroglandular volume with MRI. There\nwas a paucity of information on BD confounders in most of\nthe studies. Of all RLX studies reviewed, only 3 reported a\nThere were 5 RCTs that assessed change in BD with\ntibolone intervention.48-52 Ages of participants ranged from\n= 665). Tibolone administration was 2.5 mg/d, and duration\nof administration was 1 year. Three studies performed sub-\njective MBD assessment, 1 used Cumulus, and 1 performed\nVBD assessment. Only the study that measured VBD\nadjusted for confounders and reported a significant tibo-\nlone-mediated BD reduction.49\nChanges in BD with AIs (letrozole, 2.5 mg/d; anastro-\nzole, 1 mg/d; exemestane, 25 mg/d) were assessed in 10\nthere was 1 study each on anastrozole and exemestane, and\nothers combined 2 of the 3 AIs. Of these, 4 were prospec-\ntive arm trials and 3 were RCTs. The sample size varied\ning postmenopausal women alone. The duration of admin-\nistration ranged from 6 months to 2 years. Among the\nstudies, 7 assessed MBD using area-based computer-\nassisted methods, and the remaining studies used an area-\nbased subjective approach alone or in combination with\narea-based computer-assisted methods. There was little or\nno adjustment for BD confounding factors in most of the\nstudies.

(continued)\npostmenopausal women alone (P < .05)92 and the other\ndemonstrating higher BD in premenopausal women but not\nin postmenopausal women (Table 4).24\nDiscussion\nOne encouraging attribute of BD is that it can be altered.8\nBecause most determinants of BD and BC are interrelated and\ninterdependent,5 it is logical that parameters that lower BD\nmay lower BC risk. Many parameters are thought to alter BD;\nhowever, this review focuses on SERMs, AIs, PA, and diet.\nEstrogen plays a critical role in BD and increased BC\nrisk5; therefore, it is intuitive that interventions that decrease\nestrogen bioavailability may lower BD. A few substances\nwith strong binding affinity for estrogen receptors such as\nSERMs have been identified to antagonize the action of\nestrogen on breast tissue through inhibition of 17-estradiol\nactivity.97 SERMs also decrease insulin-like growth factor\n(IGF)-1 levels and increase IGF binding protein (IGFBP)\nand sex hormone binding-globulin.8,9,15 Other substances\n(AIs) inhibit the production of estrogen by aromatase.15,56\nEvidence shows that TAM mediates BD reduction in both\npremenopausal and postmenopausal women, but no con-\ncrete evidence exists for BD reduction with RLX, tibolone,\nletrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane (Table 2). The BD\nreduction in TAM studies might be explained by the preva-\nlence of premenopausal women as shown by the stronger\nBD decreases in premenopausal women. Most of the AIs,\ntibolone, and RLX studies were performed in postmeno-\npausal women. Because menopause is associated with tis-\nsue involution,98 postmenopausal breast tissue may not be\nresponsive to AIs and RLX therapies.\nA few limitations are noted in studies on antiestrogen\nagents. About 80% of the studies on TAM and tibolone did\nnot adjust for BD confounders. Two of the studies on estro-\ngen modulators had very small sample sizes,11,17 and 1\nstudy99 reported duration of treatment but not dosage\nadministered. There was variability in age, populations, and\nsample size between studies, thus making comparison of\nstudies difficult. A majority of the studies did not assess the\nconsistency of MBD assessments, and 90% of the studies\nused area-based approaches for MBD assessment, which\nmay not detect change in BD when the quantity of dense\ntissue changes but the dense area remains unchanged.\nSignificant changes in BD with 3 different estrogen-\nreceptor modulators were demonstrated where VBD assess-\nther studies using volumetric methods to assess the effect of\nRLX, tibolone, and AIs on BD in premenopausal women.\nThus, variability in MBD assessment continues to be a con-\nfounding factor in studies assessing the impact of interven-\ntions on BD, as demonstrated by the heterogeneity in results\nobtained in the same patients when different MBD mea-\nPA alters BMI by reducing adiposity and increasing\nmuscle mass, and the association between BMI, BD, and\ncancer is well established.100 However, the evidence for the\nassociation between PA and BD is conflicting. Of the 21\nstudies, 81%, including a RCT of aerobic exercise on BD,23\nfound no association between PA and BD. It is well estab-\nlished that BMI and postmenopausal status are negative\nconfounders for BD.100 BMI was found to attenuate the\nassociation between PA and BD, but only 9 studies adjusted\nfor menopausal status; 95% of the studies did not report\nwhether participants were premenopausal or postmeno-\npausal at the time of PA, and 1 study70 did not specify the\ntiming of PA. There was heterogeneity in the type, duration,\nand intensity of PA, making comparison of results difficult.\nThe only RCT that assessed change in BD with aerobic\nexercise was in postmenopausal women. Involution of the\nbreast and depletion of sex hormones and growth factors is\ncommon in postmenopausal women.5,98 Because exercise\nacts through these hormonal agents, it is unsurprising that\nno change was noted in BD with aerobic exercise in post-\nmenopausal women. About 90% of the studies assessed\nCaucasian women, limiting the generalization of results to\nother ethnic populations.As yet, there is no evidence to sug-\ngest that PA is associated with lower BD. Nonetheless,\nbecause PA is inversely related to serum IGF-1, estrogen,\nand progesterone bioavailability and reduction in their\nserum concentration reduces cell proliferation and exposure\nto carcinogens, PA is a controllable, important BC risk miti-\ngation agent.\nAlthough evidence for the association between diet and\ncalcium; a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet; and vegetables\nappears to be associated with lower BD, mostly in pre-\nmenopausal women (Table 4). Calcium and vitamin D play\nan important role in the modulation of epithelial cell growth,\nproliferation, and differentiation.101 The inverse association\nbetween these food sources and BD in premenopausal\nwomen is stronger at higher threshold consumption and\namong women with high concentrations of IGF-I or IGFBP-\n3.77 Lower BD from calcium and vitamin D intake has been\nattributed to antioxidant activity101 and inhibition of IGFs.77\nPremenopausal, compared with postmenopausal, women\nhave more proliferating cells and mitogens implicated in\nBD increases,5,8,77 which is perhaps the reason for the\ninverse association between calcium and vitamin D with\nBD in premenopausal women only. Isoflavone consump-\ntion has been shown to be associated with lower cancer\nproduct consumers who metabolize daidzein manufactured\nby intestinal bacteria to equol (a nonsteroidal estrogen)\ndemonstrate slightly lower BD than non\u00adequol producers.91\nThis suggests that the metabolism of a specific diet may\ninfluence its association with BD and needs to be explored.\nIsoflavones reduce the effects of mitogens and mutagens\nthrough increases in antioxidant activity and sex hormone\u00ad\nbinding globulin serum bioactivity,102 and these 2 properties\nreduce cell proliferation associated with BD increases.\nIsoflavone studies are limited by the area-based assessment\nof MBD and inadequate adjustment for BD confounders.\nThe literature on the association between carbohydrates\nand proteins with BD also presents conflicting outcomes:\ndirect association,82 inverse association,80 and no associa-\ntion.81 However, RCTs on low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet\nhave shown an inverse association with BD in premeno-\npausal and postmenopausal women.25,29 There is evidence\nthat the fiber make-up of carbohydrates influences the IGF/\nIGFBP sequence and oxidative stress.103 Therefore, varying\nfiber content in the different sources of carbohydrates may\ndifferentially influence growth factors responsible for BD\nvariations, and this may be the reason for the inconsistent\nrelationship between carbohydrate intake and BD.\nVegetables and carotene inhibit cell proliferation and\nIGF-1,104 and these may be the reasons for their association\nwith lower BD in premenopausal and postmenopausal\nwomen.26,73 Although regular use of M-M supplements has\ngenerated different outcomes, these supplements contain\nantioxidants that reduce the activity of mitogens responsi-\nble for BD increases24 and, therefore, need to be further\ninvestigated.\nGenerally, the reliance of CSSs on questionnaires whose\nreliability can be diminished by memory deficiency makes\nit difficult to measure the extent of exposure to dietary fac-\ntors.105 The association between a specific diet and BD may\nalso be attenuated if such food is consumed in combination\nwith other counteracting food substances and if intake\noccurred before mammogenesis. Therefore, RCTs using\nVBD measurement approaches may provide more accurate\nevidence for the impact of interventions on BD. The litera-\nture demonstrates that antidiabetes agents such as metfor-\nmin inhibit IGF-1 and insulin/IGF chain and alter metabolic\nprocesses.106 These processes are associated with reduction\nin cell proliferation,106 which may lower BD. Thus, it may\nbe important to assess the effect of antidiabetes agents and\nchanges in glucose homeostasis on BD. Finally and encour-\nagingly, change in BD over time is consistent with change\nTherefore, BD may have potential utility as a biomarker for\nthe efficacy of chemopreventive interventions.\nConclusion\nThere is substantial evidence that BD is potentially reduc-\nible. Tamoxifen reduces BD; however, the effect of RLX,\ntibolone, and AIs on BD is still unclear. There is no evi-\ndence for association of PA and childhood or adolescent\ndiet with BD. Although data on the association between\ndietary factors and BD are conflicting, intake of vegetables,\nvitamin D, and calcium in adulthood is associated with\nlower BD in premenopausal women. It is hoped that lower-\ning BD with interventions may lower BC risk and improve\nearly detection of BC with mammography. However, these\nbenefits can only be amassed if women are adequately\ninformed about BD and BC risk mitigation strategies.\nImplementation of these strategies may hold the key to\nreducing the risk of BC.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\n1.
