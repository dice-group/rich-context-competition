Efforts to reduce the inap-\npropriate use will need to be evaluated against current\ntrends in the outpatient use of antibiotics.\nObjectives: To examine national trends in the use of\nantibiotics by primary care physicians in the care of adult\npatients with cough and identify patient factors that may\ninfluence antibiotic use for these patients.\nMethods: This study was based on a serial analysis of\nresults from all National Ambulatory Medical Care Sur-\nveys beginning in 1980 (when therapeutic drug use was\nfirst recorded) to 1994 (the most recent survey year avail-\nable). These surveys are a random sampling of visits to\nadults presenting to general internists, family practition-\ners, or general practitioners with a chief complaint of\ncough. A total of 3416 visits for cough were identified\nover the survey years. Survey results were extrapolated,\nbased on sampling weights in each year, to project na-\ntional rates of antibiotic use for patients with cough. Ad-\nditional analyses examined the rates of antibiotic use strati-\nfied by patient age, race, and clinical diagnosis.\nResults: Overall, an antibiotic was prescribed 66% of the\ntime during office visits for patients with cough: 59% of\n.002 for trend).

Whether these efforts at improv-\ning physician knowledge about the risks\nof excessive antibiotic use will ultimately\nlead to any reductions in antibiotic use is\nunknown. However, an understanding of\ncurrent trends in antibiotic prescribing will\nbe useful for interpreting any future trends\nin antibiotic use.\nThis study focuses on the use of anti-\nbiotics for patients presenting with cough\nratherthanpatientsdiagnosedashavingspe-\ncific acute respiratory diseases.

Additional work19 based on\nthis survey demonstrated that as recently as 1992, most\npatients diagnosed as having colds, upper respiratory tract\ninfections, and bronchitis were treated with antibiotics.\nWe hypothesized that this pattern of rising antibiotic use\nwould be even more apparent in the management of pa-\ntients with cough, despite the recent increase in aware-\nness regarding the rise in antibiotic resistance. The spe-\ncific aims of this study were (1) to examine national trends\nin the use of antibiotics by primary care physicians in the\ncare of adult patients with cough and (2) to identify fac-\ntors that may influence antibiotic use for these patients.\nRESULTS\nThe frequency of visits to primary care physiciansbyadults\nwith a chief complaint of cough rose steadily from 1980\nthrough 1994.

During\nthis study period, the frequency of other primary reasons\nfor visits did not demonstrate the same pattern of in-\ncrease. For example, sore throat represented 2.6% of pri-\nin 1994, and a chief complaint of lung congestion or chest\ncough included additional reasons for visit. The leading ad-\nditional reasons for visits were nasal congestion, fever, and\nits, respectively.\nMost patients who presented with cough were\nnon-Hispanic (82%).

We began with 1980 because it was the first sur-\nvey year in which drug prescribing information was in-\ncluded at each sampled visit. We included all subsequent\nNAMCS survey years through 1994, the most recent year\navailable at the time of this study. The sampling process\nmakes use of the American Medical Association and Ameri-\ncan Osteopathic Association master lists of all US primary\ncare physicians. A sample of physicians from these lists was\nthen selected by random, stratified sampling by geo-\ngraphic area and specialty. Among eligible physicians, an-\n(1981). For each participating physician in each year, pa-\ntient visits during a randomly selected week were sampled\nsystematically.\nFor each selected patient visit, physicians completed\nencounter forms detailing the specific clinical services pro-\nvided during the visit, as well as patient demographics, rea-\nsons for visit, and diagnoses. The first listed reason for visit\nand first listed diagnosis represent the principal reason for\nvisit and associated principal diagnosis, respectively. We\nchose to focus on cough as the principal reason for visit\nbecause of its explicit linkage to the principal diagnosis,\nthus permitting a better understanding of the clinical in-\ndications for antibiotic use. In fact, secondary reasons for\nvisits were listed in only 37% of all visits and a third rea-\nson for visit was listed in only 11% of all visits to primary\ncare physicians. Continuing and newly ordered over-the-\ncounter and prescribed medications also were listed for each\nvisit. For each visit record, the National Center for Health\nStatistics provided a visit weight calculated from the phy-\nsician and visit sampling rates, adjusted for nonresponse.\nStatistical aggregation using these visit weights allows ex-\ntrapolation to national patterns of practice.\nWe restricted this study to visits by adults (aged 18\nyears) to primary care physicians, defined as physicians iden-\ntified in 1 of the following 3 American Medical Associa-\ntion categories: internal medicine, family practice, or gen-\neral practice. This portion of the NAMCS database includes\nits by adults to primary care physicians.\nVisits by adults to primary care physicians for cough were\nidentified based on the coding of patient reason for visit.\nThose visits in which cough was coded as the first (pri-\nmary) reason for visit were identified as primary care vis-\nits for cough.

We did not exclude parenteral\nforms of antibiotics, although they contributed only a small\nproportion of all antibiotics prescribed since only outpa-\ntient visits are included in the NAMCS.\nPrimarydiagnosesforpatientswithvisitsforcoughwere\nidentified based on the International Classification of Dis-\neases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)21\n\u00a91998 American Medical Association.

In particular, bronchi-\ntis, including acute bronchitis and bronchitis not speci-\nfied as acute or chronic, remained the leading diagnosis in\neach study year (average, 42% of visits). Other leading di-\nagnoses included upper respiratory tract infection, asthma,\nsinusitis, and pneumonia. Fifty-nine percent of the visits\nfor cough had only a single diagnosis listed.\nThe number of antibiotics prescribed as a result of visits\nfor cough to primary care physicians increased over the\nin frequency of visits for cough (Table 1).

For\nexample, in the most recent year (1994) physicians pre-\nscribed antibiotics for cough 74% of the time for pa-\nyears or older. Similarly, white, non-Hispanic patients\nwere more likely to receive antibiotics compared with all\nother patients in each study year. There was no differ-\ndiagnostic code listed as the first diagnostic code for each\nvisit. Based on the frequency of ICD-9-CM codes, we iden-\ntified the following primary diagnoses for visits by pa-\ntients with cough: bronchitis, acute or not otherwise speci-\ninfluenza (code 487), acute upper respiratory tract infec-\ntion (code 465), acute nasopharyngitis (common cold) (code\nthe cough visit as an initial visit for the problem or a fol-\nlow-up visit based on whether the physician identified the\nprimary reason for visit as a new problem (or a first visit\nwith the patient) or as a problem for which they had pre-\nviously seen the patient.\nA number of patient characteristics reported in the\nNAMCS were evaluated to determine their association with\nantibiotic use. Particular characteristics that were tested in-\nand 65 years), sex, and race and ethnicity (categorized\nas white, non-Hispanic vs other).\nNational estimates of the number of visits by adults to pri-\nmary care physicians for cough and the number of antibi-\notics recorded at those visits were calculated based on the\nsampling weights provided by the National Center for Health\nStatistics. For each estimate, a 95% confidence interval was\ncalculated based on the relative SEs provided in the docu-\nmentation for each survey year. These relative SEs are pro-\nvided for visit estimates and drug estimates for individual\nphysician specialties. Because our study of primary care phy-\nsicians merged 3 specialties (internal medicine, family prac-\ntice, and general practice) in each year, we chose the larg-\nest relative SE associated with one of these specialties to\ndetermine the confidence intervals around the aggregated\nsample. As recommended by the National Center for Health\nStatistics, significance of linear trend for the annual fre-\nquency of visits for cough and the annual frequency of an-\ntibiotic drug prescriptions at these visits was based on a 2-\nsided t test for trend, incorporating the relative SEs for each\nyear in the calculation.22\nNational patterns in the rate of patients with cough\nreceiving antibiotics were assessed by cross-tabulation of\nmedication information by year of visit, weighted by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics visit-sampling weights.\nRates of antibiotic use were expressed as the proportion of\nvisits for cough in which any antibiotic was listed. Both un-\nadjusted and adjusted tests for significance of trends over\nthe study years were based on logistic regression analysis\nwith the natural logarithm of the odds of antibiotic use in\npatients with cough as the dependent variable. These analy-\nses were performed with SAS statistical software (Release\n6.11, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) using modified sample\nweight to reflect the actual-sampling probabilities of each\nvisit and the original sample size of the final study group.\nIn the logistic regression analysis, calendar year was en-\ntered as a continuous variable to test for significance of lin-\near trend.\nAll analyses used the patient visit as the unit of analy-\nsis and did not adjust for the clustering effect within indi-\nvidual sampling units (eg, physician practices) because\nunique physician identifiers were not available for this study\nfor years prior to 1991. However, using general estimating\nequations and the physician identifiers for years 1991-\n1994 demonstrated that adjustment for the clustering ef-\nfect in those years had minimal effect on the parameter es-\ntimates and increased the SEs for each predictor by 20%\nto 30%.

Overall, patients with a diagnosis of bronchitis were\nprescribed antibiotics at 81% of office visits, which was\nmore than patients with upper respiratory tract infec-\ntions and all other diagnoses combined, who were pre-\nscribed antibiotics at 68% and 51% of office visits, re-\nspectively. In addition, patients who were seen for an\ninitial visit for cough were more likely in every study year\nto receive an antibiotic compared with patients with cough\nwho had been seen previously by the physician for this\nproblem (Table 3).\nFinally, we considered the independent effects of\neach of these predictors of antibiotic use in a multivar-\niate logistic regression analysis model. Younger pa-\ntients, white patients, and patients diagnosed as having\nbronchitis were significantly more likely to receive an-\ntibiotics for their cough (Table 4). In addition, the in-\ncreased rate of antibiotic prescribing for patients seen dur-\ning an initial visit for cough compared with patients\npreviously seen for this problem remained significant in\nthe multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% confi-\ndence interval, 1.3-1.8). After adjusting for these clini-\ncal and demographic variables, the increasing trend of\nantibiotic use during the survey years remained statisti-\ncally significant, although the adjusted size of the in-\ncrease itself was modest (odds ratio, 1.03 for antibiotic\nuse for each unit increase in year; 95% confidence inter-\nas fever and sore throat had only minimal effects on the\ncalculated odds ratios for the factors listed in the table\n(data not shown).\nCOMMENT\nThe rate of visits by adult patients with cough to pri-\nmary care physicians and the rate of antibiotic use for\nresult, the absolute number of antibiotic prescriptions for\n1994.
