The school environment is defined through a social-ecological perspective which takes\ninto account the hierarchical nature of schools. Teacher dissatisfaction was quantified through a composite of variables\nthat asked teachers about their overall feelings regarding the profession.A logistic regression was performed with teacher\ndissatisfaction as the criterion variable, and school environment variables and teacher background variables as predictors.\nSchool environment played a statistically significant role in the dissatisfaction of teachers. Specifically, teacher autonomy and\nprincipal leadership decreased the odds of teacher dissatisfaction,while student and community problems increased the odds\nof teacher dissatisfaction. Once school environment was taken into account, the log odds of teacher race, middle school\nstatus, and rural school locale increased while remaining statistically significant.\n",

As states look for ways to balance their budgets and\nincrease accountability for student achievement, more\nemphasis has been placed on teachers and schools to carry\nthe burden. Several states, including Wisconsin, Ohio, and\nMassachusetts, have passed or introduced bills limiting col-\nlective bargaining among teachers. States such as Tennessee,\nFlorida, Colorado, and Nevada have recently passed legisla-\ntion that reforms the teacher tenure process. What was once\na stable and predictable career has become volatile and ten-\ntative because of high-stakes measures, changing legislative\ndemands, and increased pressure to improve outcomes.\nThere is no doubt that teachers are enduring higher levels\nof stress because of increased demands and pressure.\nOccupational stress coupled with demands to improve stu-\ndents' standardized test scores place teachers at risk for being\ndissatisfied with their jobs. Teacher satisfaction is important\nto study and consider for several reasons. Teaching has been\nreported to be one of the most stressful jobs in the United\nStates (Dworkin, Haney, Dworkin, & Telschow, 1990;\nJohnson, Cooper, Cartwright, Donald et al., 2005). Teachers\nhave a high rate of turnover, and new teachers are quitting at\nalarming rates. Estimates suggest that 12% of all teachers\nleave teaching every year, with only 25% of cases due to\nteacher retirement (Alliance for Excellent Education, 2008;\nhigh-poverty schools, as many as 20% of teachers leave every\nyear; some transfer to other schools while others leave the\nhas called the high rate of teacher attrition among new teach-\ners, approximately one third in the first 3 years, a \"revolving\ndoor\" and has linked this problem to teaching shortages that\nexist in the United States (p. 23). Such turnover costs money\nfor districts and schools that already have constrained bud-\ngets. Moreover, the overall level of satisfaction and attitudes\nof teachers are related to school performance.\nSchools with more satisfied teachers are more effective\n(Ostroff, 1992). In addition, teachers heavily influence the\nschool community, morale among staff and students, and the\noverall school climate. Teachers who experience high levels\nof stress are more likely to miss days of work (Kyriacou,\n1980), which could potentially lead to falling behind in the\ncurriculum. Teachers who are dissatisfied could negatively\naffect the morale of their students and fellow teachers, which\ncould result in decreased motivation of students and staff\n(Ostroff, 1992). Teachers who experience burnout, which\ncomes from prolonged periods of stress, not only suffer\n1University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nCara M.

An ecologi-\ncal perspective was used to define the environment where\nteachers work (Bronfenbrenner, 1977). Schools are organized\nwithin a system with many layers. Each layer, such as the\nclassroom, the school, the neighborhood and city where\nthe school is located, the school system, the state, and the\nnational government, contributes to the overall environment\nwhere teachers experience some degree of satisfaction or\ndissatisfaction.\nSeveral features of school environments have been\ndirectly tied to teacher dissatisfaction. For example, negative\nschool climate, poor administrative leadership, and the qual-\nity of the school building have each been associated with\nincreased rates of teacher dissatisfaction (Buckley, Schneider,\n2002). In addition, the racial and economic composition of\nthe student body has also been shown to play a role in the\nsatisfaction of teachers (Litt & Turk, 1985; Zembylas &\nPapanastasiou, 2006). The factors that contribute to teacher\ndiscontent are important to understand due to increased\nemphasis on education, the increasing demands on teachers,\nand the current costs of replacing teachers.\nThe research question is as follows: To what degree do\nschool environmental factors and teacher background char-\nacteristics explain teachers' discontent? This question was\nanswered through an empirical study which drew on data\nfrom the School and Staffing Survey (SASS). The U.S.\nDepartment of Education sponsors this surveys through the\nNational Center for Education Statistics (NCES). This large\nscale survey regularly assess districts, principals, and teach-\ners based on their perceptions of issues pertinent to educa-\ntion and consist of five types of questionnaires: district\nquestionnaires, principal questionnaires, school question-\nnaires, teacher questionnaires, and school library media center\nquestionnaires. Moreover, extensive background data on the\ndistricts, schools, and teachers are collected. The public\nschool version of the SASS includes 38,240 public school\nteachers representing all 50 states. The most recent iteration\nof the teacher surveys measured teachers' education and\ntraining, teaching assignment, certification, workload, pro-\nfessional development, perceptions about teaching, income,\nand many other factors related to teaching and schools. Both\npublic and private schools are included in that national sur-\nvey; only the public teacher portion of the survey was\nanalyzed.\nSchool Environment\nThe school environment was defined by using social-ecological\ntheory as a guide. Social-ecological theory was described in its\nmost popular form by Urie Bronfenbrenner (1977) and\nemphasizes the complex environmental system where peo-\nple live and operate. In essence, social-ecological theory is a\nsystems approach that carefully defines the multilayered envi-\nronment in which individual actions occur. To emphasize the\ncomplex and dynamic nature of the environment where peo-\nple live and work, Bronfenbrenner depicts the environment\nthrough four unique subsystems, each one nested within the\nother. This approach allows for interactions between the\nindividual and each subsystem and for interactions between\nsubsystems to be studied (Harney, 2007). Social-ecological\ntheory is a useful tool for the study of schools because of the\ncomplex hierarchy in which schools exist.\nBronfenbrenner's social-ecological theory has been applied\nto the study of teachers in previous research studies, specifi-\ncally studies of special education teachers by Miller,\nBrownell, and Smith (1999). The adaptation used in this\nstudy is slightly different from that used by Miller et al. In\nadapting Bronfenbrenner's theory to the study of teacher dis-\nsatisfaction, the unit of analysis is the teacher. The four sub-\nsystems are defined as follows: the microsystem is the\nimmediate classroom where the teacher works and carries\nout the majority of his or her activities; the mesosystem is the\nschool where the teacher works; the exosystem is the larger\nschool district and community where the teacher operates,\nlives, and interacts with others; and the macrosystem includes\nthe larger structure of schooling, the various laws and stat-\nutes that regulate schools, and aspects of American culture.\nAll four subsystems combine to form the ecological school\nsystem. Each subsystem of the ecological school system\nallows for identification of factors that could affect teacher\nattrition and satisfaction.\nThis systems approach defines the different components\nthat make up a school's environment. To study teachers\neffectively, the complex environment in which they work\nmust be taken into consideration and carefully analyzed.\nMoreover, because teacher dissatisfaction is a complex phe-\nnomena with a myriad of causes, each subsystem should be\nconsidered carefully for its particular influence, be it directly\nor indirectly through another source, such as teacher stress,\nburnout, or teacher efficacy.\nThe next section will provide a review of the literature as\nit relates to factors shown to cause teacher dissatisfaction. In\naddition, social-ecological theory will be discussed as a tool\nto describe the school environment, which will be examined\nas a contributor to teacher dissatisfaction.\nReview of Literature\nSeveral different factors have been shown to influence\nteacher satisfaction. Liu and Ramsey (2008) examined the\nto determine teachers' satisfaction with different aspects of\ntheir jobs. It was found that race and years of teaching expe-\nrience were related to job satisfaction among teachers.\nSpecifically, minority teachers were less satisfied with\nteaching, and teachers with more years of experience were\nmore satisfied with teaching. Moreover, Liu and Ramsey\nfound female teachers were more satisfied than male teach-\ners. This gender difference has been confirmed by several\nMenon, Papanastasiou, & Zembylas, 2008). This study will\ndetermine if Liu and Ramsey's findings have been main-\ntained over the past 8 to 9 years or whether they have\nchanged post No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB).\nGreen-Reese, Johnson, and Campbell (1991) conducted a\nstudy with 229 physical education teachers in urban schools\nto determine how age, teaching experience, and school size\nwere related to job satisfaction and stress. It was found that\njob satisfaction is severely affected by job stress. However,\nage and years of teaching were not significantly related to\njob satisfaction. This finding contradicts Liu and Ramsey's\n(2008) study, which found the years of teaching experience\nwas significantly related to job satisfaction. The authors\nnoted the discrepancy between their results and those of pre-\nvious studies and determined that subgroups of teachers\nshould be examined in future studies rather than all teachers.\nThis article will serve to clarify the role of gender in teacher\njob satisfaction and will also examine various subgroups of\nteachers.\nThe literature suggests that teachers' perceptions about\ntheir schools and administrators are related to their satisfac-\npublic school teachers in the state of New York to determine\nthe relationship between three dimensions of job autonomy\nand job satisfaction. The three dimensions were (a) teachers'\nperceived autonomy within the classroom, (b) autonomy\noutside the classroom but within the school, and (c) an over-\nall sense of autonomy. Perception of autonomy within the\nclassroom was significantly related to job satisfaction, but\nno other perceptions of autonomy were significantly associ-\nated. Thus, teachers' ability to control their own classrooms\nwas found to be important for teachers to be satisfied with\ntheir jobs.\nSimilarly, Pearson and Moomaw (2005) conducted a\nquantitative study with 171 Florida teachers to determine the\nrelationship between teacher autonomy and four other con-\nstructs: job stress, work satisfaction, empowerment, and pro-\nfessionalism. Teacher autonomy was separated into two\ndimensions, curriculum autonomy and general teaching\nautonomy. Correlations revealed curriculum autonomy was\nsignificantly and negatively related to job stress; moreover,\ngeneral teaching autonomy was significantly and positively\nassociated with empowerment and professionalism. Quaglia,\nteachers from 20 rural Maine communities to determine dif-\nferences between satisfied and dissatisfied teachers regard-\ning their perceptions of school organization, empowerment,\nstatus, and attitude toward students. The researchers\nfound that satisfied teachers experienced significantly more\nempowerment within their schools than dissatisfied teachers;\nthe differences found in empowerment were greater than any\nother factors examined. This study expands on the studies\ncited above by examining the role of teacher autonomy with\na national sample of teachers.\nRebora (2009) reviewed a series of Met Life surveys on\nthe teaching profession to determine changes in teacher sat-\nisfaction over time. It was found that overall satisfaction\nabout negative aspects of teaching, twice as many teachers\nsaid the number of Limited English Proficiency (LEP) stu-\nlearning abilities challenge their ability to effectively teach.\nFurthermore, 50% of teachers reported poverty as a problem.\nPositive findings from the review include the following: two\nthirds of teachers said they were well prepared for the pro-\nfession and more teachers report that resources are available\nto them. Moreover, the percentage of teachers who were sat-\nin 2008. This study will examine how classroom composi-\ntion such as percentage of students with special needs, per-\ncentage of students who are learning English, and percentage\nof minority students affect teacher satisfaction.\nSchoolwide factors and variables have also been shown to\naffect teacher dissatisfaction. Kearney (2008) found that among\nteachers sampled from a midwestern school district, less than\nhalf were satisfied with class size, support from parents, school\nlearning environment, and availability of resources. These fac-\ntors were also cited as causes of teacher attrition. Retention\nrates (3 years in the classroom) were between 74.77% and\nBlack teachers during a 5-year time span.\nCulver, Wolfle, and Cross (1990) surveyed public school\nteachers in Virginia and determined that school climate and\ncommitment to teaching were significant factors in explain-\ning job satisfaction. School climate included factors such as\npoverty status, race of students, and available resources. It\nwas found that teaching experience and other teacher back-\nground factors such as race and sex had little effect. Culver\net al.'s study also supports findings by Kearney (2008) that\nschool resources and learning environment are significant\nfactors for teachers in regards to job satisfaction.\nMenon, Papanastasiou, & Zembylas (2008) conducted a\nstudy among schoolteachers in Cypress to determine the\nrelationship between teacher variables, organizational vari-\nables, and job satisfaction. The researchers sampled more\nthan 450 teachers in a quantitative study using surveys. The\nmajor findings were lower school levels (i.e., primary\nschools) were associated with increased job satisfaction;\nteachers in primary schools were more satisfied than teach-\ners in secondary schools. Other findings suggested that\nincreased job satisfaction is related to school climate and\nprofessional goal attainment. An examination of sources of\nsatisfaction and dissatisfaction of teachers in Cypress by\n4 SAGE Open\nZembylas and Papanastasiou (2006) suggested primary\nsources of satisfaction for teachers were working with chil-\ndren, contributing to society, collaborative work with col-\nleagues, professional growth, salary, and work schedule. In\ncontrast, primary sources of dissatisfaction were social prob-\nlems, student failure, lack of discipline, lack of respect and\nstatus in community, and lack of autonomy.\nin primary and secondary schools in the United Kingdom.\nThe researchers aimed to identify factors that were dissatis-\nfying for teachers in an effort to increase teacher retention.\nThe findings suggested the most dissatisfying components of\nteaching were workload, balance between work and home,\nadministrative tasks, society's views of teachers, and pupil\nbehavior issues. The most satisfying features of teaching\nwere friendliness of staff, classroom atmosphere, climate of\nachievement, and recognition of efforts by leadership.\nCrossman and Harris (2006) conducted a quantitative study\non schoolteachers in Surry, England, to examine how the type\nof school affects the satisfaction of secondary school teachers.\nIt was found that teacher satisfaction varied by type of school.\nSpecifically, independent and privately managed schools had\nmore satisfied teachers, whereas foundation schools and\nAnglican schools had less satisfied teachers. The authors noted\nthat possible causes for the results were differences in resources\navailable, differences in oversight, differences in academic\ncontrol, and differences in community status.\nThe aforementioned studies examined the relationship\nbetween schoolwide factors and teacher dissatisfaction but\nshowed very similar results. However, many of the samples\nwere either from teachers outside of the United States or\nwere limited to a single state. This study seeks to determine\nthe role school climate plays in the job satisfaction of public\nschool teachers in the United States. Furthermore, in this\nstudy, school climate will be considered a part of the overall\nschool environment. This study will add to the literature on\njob satisfaction by looking at schoolwide factors on a national\nbasis. The United States is an important context because of\nunique national foci, such as federal laws and the increasing\nstakes of standardized testing.\nOverall, the review of literature reveals that several con-\nstructs and variables should be included as potential predic-\ntors of teacher dissatisfaction. Specifically, constructs such\nas teacher efficacy, school climate, and teacher autonomy\nshould be included. Other variables such as classroom man-\nagement, principal support, highest degree earned, and certifi-\ncation status should also be considered as potential predictors\nas they have been shown to affect teacher satisfaction.\nMethod\nThe data were drawn from a survey conducted on a national\nscope by the NCES and the SASS. The SASS was developed\nin the mid-1980s after a review was completed on several\nsurveys that were administered to teachers separately. The\nSASS was created to combine the data collected from teach-\ners and school personnel on those surveys with additional\ninformation on teacher demand, school conditions, and per-\nceptions of school climate and problems in schools. There are\nfour different components to the SASS: the School\nQuestionnaire, the Teacher Questionnaire, the Principal\nQuestionnaire, and the School District Questionnaire. This\nstudy used data from the public school version of the\nTeacher Questionnaire (NCES, 2010). This version was\nselected because it included teachers in public and charter\nschools from kindergarten through 12th grade. Moreover,\nthe data from the survey include information about the\nschools in which the teachers work, which is also of impor-\ntance to the researcher.\nThe SASS is a powerful data set not only because of its\nbreadth and large sample size but also because it allows\nresearchers to conduct a wide variety of analyses. Researchers\ncan compare data across sectors, such as private, public, and\ncharter schools; analyze data at the state level; compare sub-\ngroups of respondents; analyze change over time; and link to\nother data sources (NCES, 2010). For these reasons, this data\nset is particularly suitable for the current study. The teacher\nversion of the SASS provides data on both the teachers and\nthe schools in which the teachers work. Both levels of data are\nimportant because they correspond to the two subsystems that\nare central to the study--the microsystem and mesosystem.\nAlthough different versions of the survey, such as the district\nversion, provide data at higher levels, those surveys will not\nbe used for this study.Additional information about the SASS\nis available online at http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/sass/\nThe Sample\nOne of the positive aspects of the SASS is its large scope and\nsample size. It is the largest teacher survey conducted in the\nUnited States (National Center for Educational Statistics,\n2010). Table 1 shows the unweighted sample sizes for dis-\ntricts, teachers, and schools that completed the SASS.\nAccording to the table, more than 38,000 teachers were\ndistricts. It is important to note that not all of these teachers\nare regular, full-time teachers. Thus, the researcher removed\nany teachers who were not classified as full-time or regular\nteachers from the sample prior to data analysis leaving 34,870\nteachers in the sample. The sampling strategy by the NCES\nwas such that districts were identified first, then schools, and\nthen teachers within schools.\nThere are some challenges to using a large secondary data\nset. With this particular data set, one challenge is the nested\nstructure of the data, specifically teachers within schools,\nwithin districts. There is the possibility that schools within\ndistricts are similar to each other because of commonalities\nin governance, central administration, and procedures.\nMoreover, teachers within schools can be similar to each\nother because of the common administration, procedures, and\nnorms within each school. This potential for error was\naddressed by calculating the intraclass correlation (ICC) and\nthen using that value to calculate the design effect. The nor-\nmalized sample weight was then divided by the design effect\nto reduce the sample size. (For more information on design\neffects see Johnson & Elliott, 1998.) Other limitations\ninclude potential errors with data entry and the inability to\ncompare the actual surveys with the codebook. Nevertheless,\nthe benefits of using the SASS outweigh the limitations for\nthe purpose of this study.\nVariables in the Study\nThe first phase involved an analysis of the survey items by\nthe researcher to determine which items corresponded to\nconstructs relevant to the research question. Items were con-\nstrued using the concept model based on Bronfenbrenner's\ntheory of ecological systems. Survey items that related to the\nschool environment were identified by careful analysis of the\nsurvey and cross-referencing survey items to the literature.\nThe survey items were then factor analyzed to build con-\nstructs, such as teacher control, job satisfaction, student prob-\nlems, and community problems. The second phase involved\nusing the constructs identified in Phase 1 to statistically\ndetermine which ones predicted teacher job dissatisfaction.\nUsing the review of literature, the researcher reviewed the\nsurvey items and cross-referenced them to previously\nreported causes of discontent among teachers. Variables that\nmight be relevant to dissatisfaction but were not previously\nresearched in the literature, such as highly qualified teacher\nstatus and union membership, were also included.\nAppendix A lists the continuous variables identified for\nuse in this study. The sample sizes, means, and standard\ndeviations for each variable are provided. Teacher charac-\nteristics include age, years of teaching experience, and sal-\nary. According to the data, the mean age for teachers in the\nsample is 42.77 years and the mean number of teaching years\nis 13.82. Some variables were used to limit the sample, such\nas main assignment and full-time status, while the remaining\nvariables were used to explore teacher dissatisfaction.\nSchool context variables include student/teacher ratio, the\npercentages of minority teachers and students, the percentage\nof students taught with Individual Educational Programs\n(IEPs), and the percentage of students taught with LEP.\nSimilar to the teacher perception and background variables,\nschool context variables were explored as possible predictors\nof attrition and teacher dissatisfaction. Many of the variables\nconsidered as important for the study were categorical in\nnature.\nAppendix B provides unweighted descriptives for con-\ntinuous variables in the study. Some expected and unex-\npected findings were revealed. First, the frequencies reveal\n68.9% of the teachers in the sample are female whereas\nteachers are White whereas 6.1% are Black and 1.6% are\nAsian. These findings are consistent with previously reported\nstatistics regarding the teacher workforce (Ingersoll, 2002).\nThe table also reveals 91.2% of the teachers in the sample\nare full-time, regular teachers. This finding is important as\nthe study will exclude teachers who are not full-time regular\nteachers. Interesting to note is that 17.9% of the teachers in\nthe sample have 3 years or less of total teaching experience,\n87.6% of sampled teachers are highly qualified as defined by\nthe state where they work, and 88.1% of teachers have stan-\ndard or advanced certificates.\nTeacher Dissatisfaction CompositeVariable\nA series of ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regressions\nwere planned to determine predictors of dissatisfaction\namong teachers. An analysis of the skewness and kurtosis of\nthe dissatisfaction composite variable revealed that it was\nnot normally distributed (skew/SE skew = 57.03). Typically\nvalues greater than 1.96 are considered problematic for\nOLS. In lieu of an OLS regression, a logistic regression was\nperformed because it does not require normality of criterion\nvariables and is more robust.\nTo conduct a logistic regression, the dissatisfaction com-\nposite variable needed to be dichotomized, that is, changed\nfrom a range of numbers to two values that correspond to\n\"yes\" and \"no.\" First, the variable was recoded as a categori-\ncal variable with five categories. A frequency was run to\ndetermine the range of values for the variable. Then the val-\nues were recoded so that all values between 0 and 1 were\ncoded as 0, values between 1 and 2 were coded as 1, values\nbetween 2 and 3 were coded as 2, values between 3 and 4\nwere coded as 3, and values of 4 or greater were coded as 4.\nA value of 0 corresponded to low dissatisfaction (being\nhighly satisfied) and a value of 4 corresponded to being\nhighly dissatisfied. A second frequency was run on the cate-\ngorized variable to check for accuracy. Unweighted and nor-\nmalized weighted frequency data for categorized teacher\ndissatisfaction are listed in Table 2.\nBecause of the potential for overestimation of teacher dis-\nsatisfaction, only the most extreme cases of dissatisfaction\nwere considered for the dichotomous variable, values 3 and 4.\nGroup n\nSource: National Center for Education Statistics, 2007\nNote: SASS = School and Staffing Survey.\n6 SAGE Open\nThus, the categorical variable was dichotomized with val-\nues 0, 1, and 2 recoded to 0 (not dissatisfied) and values\n3 and 4 recoded to 1 (dissatisfied) seeTable 3.The dichotomized\nvariable, therefore, is a conservative measure of teacher dis-\nsatisfaction; moderately dissatisfied teachers were not\nincluded to address potential error.\nCombining the unweighted percentages of the cases with\nvalues 3 and 4 gives a total of 15.5% of cases that are mod-\nerately or very dissatisfied with their jobs. It is sufficient to\nrun a logistic regression with 15.5% of the sample as the\ncriterion variable without additional problems. Moreover,\nbecause logistic regressions do not rely on normality of vari-\nables, the nonnormality of the predictor variables becomes a\nnonissue.\nThe procedures used to analyze the data included the\nidentification of relevant survey items and statistical proce-\ndures to group them into constructs that corresponded to dif-\nferent school environment variables. The school environment\nvariables, along with teacher background and school context\nvariables were regressed with teacher dissatisfaction as the\ncriterion variable. The next section describes the results of\nthe factor analysis and logistic regression in detail.\nResults\nPhase 1 of the study involved a factor analysis to assist in the\nconstruction of teacher dissatisfaction along with school\nenvironment variables that would be used to predict teacher\ndissatisfaction. The public teacher version of the SASS was\nused to obtain data used for the analysis. This survey is\ndeveloped by the NCES and administered by the U.S.\nCensus Bureau.\nThe SASS sample was limited to full-time, regular teach-\nteachers, including part-time and substitute teachers, were\nexcluded from the sample. The revised sample included\nteachers from kindergarten through 12th grade from all\nsubject areas. Special education teachers and specialists,\nsuch as art, physical education, and music teachers, were\nalso included.\nThe first analysis was a principal components factor\nanalysis with varimax rotation; it was completed to reveal\nfactors that would be used to construct school environ-\nment variables. The school environment was defined using\nteacher perceptions of their students, classrooms, schools,\nand principals as measured by the survey. Only items that\ndescribed the teaching environment were included; teacher\nbackground and school background variables were omit-\nted from the factor analysis. The results are listed in\nAppendix C.\nThe exploratory factor analysis revealed potential com-\nposite variables to be examined for the study. The categories\nwere identified by looking at similarities between the items\nthat loaded at .400 or higher. This value coefficient cutoff is\nmodest and is frequently used to eliminate variables in\nexploratory factor analyses. Variables with value coefficients\ngreater than .400 in more than one category were categorized\nby factor score; the variable was placed in the category with\nthe greater value coefficient.\nAll categories were then analyzed for reliability using\nCronbach's alpha to ensure accuracy of the variable place-\nment and the consistency of the overall constructs. Cronbach's\nalpha was computed for each category, and variables that\ngreatly lowered the overall reliability were eliminated.\nReliability data are reported in Table 4.\nVariable Construction Using Exploratory\nFactor Analysis\nThe five variables which were constructed from this analysis\nand modeled as covariates in the multivariate analysis were:\n(a) teacher perceptions of administrative and colleague sup-\nport, (b) teacher perceptions of school problems, (c) teacher\nperceptions of community problems (includes parents), (d)\nteacher dissatisfaction, and (e) teacher control in the class-\nroom. These items respond to the school environment as\ndefined in the study. Many of the items that were used to\nconstruct the composite variables were reverse coded or\nrecoded to allow for interpretation of the analysis. This pro-\ncedure is similar to that used by Renzulli, Macpherson-\nThe teacher dissatisfaction composite variable required\nrecoding of item categories so that the composite measured\ndissatisfaction rather than satisfaction. Five variables were\nreverse coded so that \"strongly agree\" was changed from a\nTable 2.

Those items were \"teaching not worth it,\"\n\"would leave for better pay,\" \"would transfer to another\nschool,\" \"less enthusiasm for teaching,\" and \"too tired for\nschool.\" Moreover, the \"remaining in teaching\" variable\ncontained several responses that were similar in nature and\ncould be combined. The variable was recoded so that those\nsimilar responses (i.e., until I am eligible for retirement, until\nI am eligible for social security) had the same score. In addi-\ntion, responses of \"uncertain\" were omitted. This recoding\nprocedure is similar to that used by Renzulli et al. (2011).\nA logistic regression with teacher dissatisfaction as the\ncriterion variable was run in a series of models to control for\nteacher background and school context variables. The\ndichotomized form of the variable was used. A design effect\nadjusted weight was applied to the sample to correct the\nsample size for the interclass correlation, which was .023.\nInterclass correlation was a potential source of error in this\nanalysis because teachers were sampled based on the schools\nin which they worked. Sampled members of the same group\n(in this case school) present the potential that the group\nmembers will answer survey questions similarly. The\n8 SAGE Open\ninterclass correlation measures the association of the\nresponses given by members of the same group for a par-\nticular variable. High correlations are problematic and need\nto be addressed. The design effect reduced the sample size\nteachers. Results of the logistic regression are provided in\nThe results of logistic regressions are provided as a log\nodds ratio () of the event occurring. They are typically con-\nverted to exp(B)s by raising e to the power of the log odds.\nExp(B) values give the change in odds for a one unit change in\nthe predictor variable. For dichotomous variables, a one-unit\nchange corresponds to group membership. The formula\n[exp(B) \u00ad 1] \u00d7 100% is used to change the exp(B) values to\npercentages that are easier to interpret. Moreover, probability\ncan be calculated from exp(B) with the following formula:\nprobability = odds / (1 + odds). For example, the log odds ratio\nof female teachers being dissatisfied is 0.072.

(See DeMaris, 1995, for additional information about\nlogistic regression.)All results discussed are based on the third\nmodel of the regression unless otherwise noted.\nThe results of the logistic regression indicate that teacher\nbackground, school context, and school environment signifi-\ncantly change the odds of dissatisfaction among teachers.\nAmong teacher background predictors, being Black signifi-\ncantly increased the odds of being dissatisfied, exp(B) =\ners have a 28% increase in the odds of being dissatisfied\ncompared with non-Black teachers; the probability of a\nBlack teacher being dissatisfied is 56.2%.\nOther teacher background variables significantly\ndecreased the odds of being dissatisfied. Total years of teach-\ning experience, union membership, new teacher status,\nhigher salary, and highly qualified teacher status all signifi-\ncantly decreased the odds of teacher dissatisfaction.

In addition, teaching in a rural school increased the\nLarger student\u00adteacher ratios, larger percentages of minority\nteachers in a school, and larger percentages of LEP2 students\neach increased the odds of teacher dissatisfaction although\nthe changes in odds were small. A unit increase in student/\nteacher ratio, that is the addition of one student in a class-\nroom, increased the odds of dissatisfaction by 1.9%.

The model can be\nrepresented as a formula using the constant and the regres-\nsion coefficients. Putting data for a particular teacher into the\nformula will yield the logit of the probability of that teacher\nbeing dissatisfied. The logit of the probability is equivalent\nto the natural log of the odds of the event occurring. The\nstandard logistic regression formula takes the form:\nLogit(p) = b\n+ b\nX\n+ b\nX\n+ b\nX\n+ . . . + b\nk\nX\nk\n,\nwhere p is the probability of the event in question, b is the\nregression coefficient (), and X refers to the predictor vari-\nables.

The equation based on the\nlogistic regression results is as follows:\nLogit(p\ndissatisfaction\nnity problems) + -.369(class control).\nDiscussion\nIt is important to note most teachers surveyed were satisfied\nto a high or moderate degree. About 15.5% of teachers in the\nsample were moderately or very dissatisfied. This finding\nsupports the studies that suggest that most teachers are satis-\nfied with their jobs (Kyriacou & Sutcliffe, 1979; Quaglia et al.,\nmany studies that examine teacher dissatisfaction fail to\nmention the overall satisfaction and dissatisfaction rates of\nteachers. Moreover, this finding suggests that the positive\naspects of teaching, such as helping students and community\ninvolvement, outweigh the negative aspects of the job.\nNevertheless, there are aspects of teaching that can increase\ndissatisfaction. Discussion of the salient factors that negatively\naffect teacher job satisfaction are discussed below.\nSchool Environment\nIn consideration of the factors that contribute to dissatisfac-\ntion, the results suggest that school environment plays a\ncrucial role in the experience of dissatisfaction among public\nschool teachers. When school environment is considered,\nthe study suggests that positive environment and teacher\ncontrol decrease teacher dissatisfaction; thus teachers who\nperceive a more positive environment and have more control\nover their classrooms are more satisfied with their jobs. The\nstudy further suggests that teachers' perceptions of student\nproblems and teachers' perceptions of community problems\nincrease teacher dissatisfaction.\nA reexamination of the composition of the school envi-\nronment variables clarifies the findings further. A positive\nschool environment comprised the following components:\na supportive administration, enforcement of rules by the\nprincipal and other teachers, shared beliefs and values,\ncommunication among the principal and staff, cooperation\namong staff, recognition of achievement and hard work by\nthe principal, general overall satisfaction, general satisfac-\ntion with salary, and the belief that the school is well run.\nBased on the composition of the positive school environ-\nment variable, having a positive school environment is\nheavily dependent on the administration and other staff\nmembers. Having a school leader who communicates with\nstaff members and sets the tone for cooperation, and a\nshared sense of purpose is critical to teachers' perception of\na positive school environment and being satisfied with their\nTeacher control is another aspect of the school environ-\nment that affects teacher dissatisfaction. The teacher control\nvariable in this study comprised control over teaching prac-\ntices, control over grading, control over discipline, and con-\ntrol over homework. These four components typically occur\nwithin a teachers' classroom and correspond with the micro-\nsystem of the teachers' school environment. Thus, control\nand autonomy over classroom decisions are very important\nfor teachers to be satisfied with their jobs. Again, the admin-\nistration determines how much autonomy and control teach-\ners have over the affairs of their classroom. This study\nsuggests that more control helps teachers to be satisfied with\ntheir jobs.\nTeachers' perceptions of the problems students have\nwithin their school and classroom affect teacher dissatisfac-\ntion; the more problems that are perceived by teachers, the\nmore dissatisfied they are with their jobs. The perceptions\nof student problems variable includes student tardiness, stu-\ndents who are absent frequently, class cutting, student drop-\nouts, and student apathy. It is important to note that the\nteachers' thoughts about these issues were important for\ndissatisfaction; the actual numerical rates of students' drop-\nout, absence, tardiness, and so on were not. Thus, if teach-\ners' perceptions of student problems were to improve, then\ntheir job satisfaction could also improve. This finding is\nvery important because teachers' perceptions may be easier\nto change than students' actual behaviors, which are often-\ntimes out of their control and affected by extraneous\ncircumstances.\nTeachers' perceptions of community problems also\naffected their job satisfaction. When teachers perceived\nmore problems with the community in which they worked,\nthey were more likely to be dissatisfied. The variable\nincluded teachers' perceptions about parental involvement,\npoverty, student preparation, and student health. As teach-\ners perceive lower levels of parental involvement, student\npreparation, and student health and higher levels of pov-\nerty, they are more likely to be dissatisfied with teaching.\nParental involvement and poverty have been widely stud-\nied as factors that are important for teachers, students, and\nschools, especially in terms of student achievement (Hoover-\nand student preparation have been studied mostly in terms\nof student achievement but have not been widely studied as\nfactors that affect teachers. It is very possible that these\nfactors cause decreases in teacher satisfaction due to their\nroles in student achievement. Teachers are increasingly\nassessed in regard to how well their students perform (see,\nfor example, McCaffrey, Lockwood, Koretz & Hamilton,\n2004). Nevertheless, this conjecture is outside of the scope\nof the research conducted in this project and requires fur-\nther study.\nOne of the strengths of Brofenbrenner's theory is that the\nsystem levels are not self-contained; rather there is interac-\ntion between system levels. This research study makes it\nclear that the different system levels do interact with each\nother; specifically, school environment serves to mediate the\neffects of variables in other levels of the system. Recall that\nthree out of the four school environment variables are located\nwithin the mesosystem. One school environment variable,\nteacher control, is located within the microsystem.\nTeacher Background\nIn examination of teachers' personal characteristics, ethnic-\nity played a role in the dissatisfaction of teachers. Before\nschool environment was added to the model, Hispanic\nteachers were more likely to be dissatisfied. However, once\nschool environment was added to the model, the effect\nceased to exist. This result suggests that the issues that cause\nHispanic teachers to experience dissatisfaction with their\njobs have more to do with the school environment than\ncommon experiences based on their ethnicity. Again, posi-\ntive school environment and classroom control increased\nteachers' levels of satisfaction; both of these variables relied\nheavily on school leadership and administrative decisions.\nThus, it is possible that school administration efforts can\nprevent Hispanic teachers from becoming dissatisfied with\ntheir jobs.\nSimilarly, when race was examined, Black teachers\nwere highly dissatisfied with their jobs before school envi-\nronment was added to the model. After school environ-\nment was added, the effect decreased, but race still\nremained significant. This result was not the case with\nHispanic teachers. This finding indicates that even if the\nschool environment was ideal, there is still a large chance\nthat Black teachers will be dissatisfied with their jobs. This\nfinding is perplexing and is worthy of additional study,\nespecially because the effect cannot be explained by school\nbackground or school environment. It is unknown whether\nthe dissatisfaction of Black teachers is a new phenomenon\nor whether Black teachers' have been dissatisfied with\nteaching as a profession over a long period of time. Further\nstudy is warranted to examine this finding and to determine\nwhat underlying factors could cause higher levels of dis-\nsatisfaction among Black teachers. As there is an increased\neffort to recruit and retain Black teachers, it is very impor-\ntant to understand their common experiences within the\nsystem of education.\nSchool environment did not mitigate union membership,\nnew teacher status, or highly qualified teacher status. Thus,\nthese school context variables are important for teachers,\neven if their environments are perceived as ideal. Each of\nthese three variables raised the odds of teacher satisfaction,\neven in schools where teachers perceived negative student\nbehaviors and negative community factors, such as poverty.\nBecause many states are making changes to the functions of\nunions, it is important to monitor how teacher satisfaction\nchanges in areas where unions are being challenged.\nMicrosystem\nRecall that the microsystem is defined as the teachers'\nclassroom. Examination of the microsystem in light of the\nschool environment reveals that the student\u00adteacher ratio\nremains an important component of teacher dissatisfaction,\neven when the school environment is taken into account. In\nfact, the importance of the student\u00adteacher ratio actually\nincreased once school environment was added to the model.\nAs school budgets decrease and the numbers of students\nincrease, it is critical that school districts continue to invest\nin efforts that will keep class sizes from becoming too large.\nPerhaps smaller class sizes allow teachers to work with\nstudents who show problematic behaviors or students with\ncommunity challenges such as poverty and underprepared-\nness more effectively; this idea will need to be explored\nthrough further study. Nevertheless, smaller class sizes help\nteachers to be more satisfied with their jobs and smaller\nclass sizes have also been shown to positively affect student\nachievement (Stecher, Bohrnstedt, Kirst, McRobbie, &\nAnother interesting interaction between the school envi-\nronment and the microsystem is the effect of the percentage\nof minority students on teacher dissatisfaction. When the\nmodel included only teacher background and school back-\nground, the percentage of minority students slightly increased\nteacher dissatisfaction. However, once school environment\nwas added to the model, the percentage of minority students\nbecame nonsignificant to the satisfaction of teachers. This\nindicates that the actual race of the students taught is not as\nimportant as teachers' perceptions about the students they\nteach.All school environment variables were based on teach-\ners' perceptions. Although the effects were small, this finding\nindicates that helping teachers to perceive minority students\ndifferently could increase their satisfaction with teaching large\nnumbers of minority students.\nConversely, the percentage of LEP students taught\nbecame more important once school environment was fac-\ntored into the model. Although the effect is small, the find-\ning is interesting and worthy of additional study. A\ncommunication barrier between linguistically diverse stu-\ndents and teachers could be related to this finding. Moreover,\nteachers may not have the resources or training to effec-\ntively teach LEP students. The School environment did not\ncapture the resources that a school had or training that the\nteacher might have received. In addition, the data did not\ninclude the types of programs that were offered in schools\nto support LEP students and teachers of these students,\nsuch as dual-language programs. It is possible that more\ntraining, more resources, or specific types of bilingual pro-\ngrams could help teachers to work more effectively with\nthese students. Thus, more research is needed to examine\nthe interactions between linguistically diverse students and\ngeneral education teachers.\nMesosystem\nThe mesosystem was defined as the school and immediate\ncommunity where teachers work. Within the mesosystem,\nurban school locale decreased in importance and became\nnonsignificant once school environment was added to the\nmodel. Conversely, middle school designation and rural\nschool locale increased in importance when school environ-\nment was added to the model. When considering urban and\nrural schools, the results of the study suggest that differences\nin teachers' perceptions of school environment better explain\nwhy urban schools cause dissatisfaction among teachers.\nUrban schools typically have challenges such as student pov-\nerty, funding concerns, and large percentages of minority\nstudents. This study suggests that teachers' perceptions about\nsuch challenges are more important than the actual school\nbeing designated as \"urban.\" This difference is important to\nnote because many studies include urban school location as a\nvariable when studying teacher dissatisfaction and other con-\nstructs such as teacher stress. Future studies should carefully\nexamine teachers'attitudes about their school environment as\nwell as locale to ensure accurate results.\nRural schools, however, do have a quality that contrib-\nutes to teacher dissatisfaction that cannot be attributed to\nthe school environment. This finding indicates that more\nstudy is needed to determine what factors cause rural teach-\ners to be more dissatisfied with their jobs. Similarly, middle\nschool designation also increased in importance once school\nenvironment was added to the model. This finding sug-\ngests that there are other aspects about middle schools that\nwere not captured by teachers' perceptions about the school\nenvironment that cause teachers dissatisfaction. It is impor-\ntant to note that student challenges such as tardiness,\nabsences, class cutting, and apathy were included in school\nenvironment and, thus, do not account for teacher dissatis-\nfaction in the model.\nImplications\nThe implications of this study are numerous because of the\nlarge number of variables examined. The most significant\nimplications will be noted. First, the results of this study\nsuggest that the school environment plays a major role in\nthe dissatisfaction of teachers. Efforts to understand teacher\nsatisfaction should include measures of the school environ-\nment to fully understand the phenomenon. In regards to\nspecific findings, Black teachers need to be examined in\nmore detail to better understand their unique experiences\nand insights that may cause increased dissatisfaction among\nthem as a group. Qualitative studies may be particularly\nhelpful at identifying the concerns and challenges of being\na Black teacher. Along the same lines, rural schools and\nmiddle schools should be examined in more detail to deter-\nmine why these schools in particular cause higher rates of\ndissatisfaction among teachers. Moreover, because teacher\nunions are being threatened in the current political climate,\nfuture studies might want to examine how teacher satisfac-\ntion is affected by the weakening and loss of unions.\nLimitations\nSome findings could have sociopolitical ramifications if\ntaken out of context. All findings need further study to\nuncover new data that will illuminate the nuances. The\nLikert-type questions that were used to construct variables\nwere written in such a manner that a large majority of the\nteachers fell to one extreme. Skewed variables violate the\nassumptions of multiple regression and can be a source of\nerror. Because of the skewness of several variables, an OLS\nregression could not be completed for dissatisfaction; rather,\na logistic regression was performed. Transforming the crite-\nrion variable to make it dichotomous resulted in the loss of\nvariability within the data which might have affected the\nfinal results.\nAppendix A\nUnweighted Descriptives for Continuous SASSVariables in the Study\nVariable n M SD\nNote: SASS = School and Staffing Survey; LEP = Limited English Proficiency; IEP = Individual Educational Program; NSLP = National School Lunch Program;\nFTE = Full Time Educator.\nAppendix B\nUnweighted Descriptives for Categorical SASSVariables in Study\nVariable Category Frequency %\nHighest degree earned Associate's/no degree 520 1.4\n Certificate that requires a certification program 940 2.5\n(continued)\nAppendix C\nSummary of Exploratory Factor Analysis Results of School Environment\nVariable Category Frequency %\nNote: SASS = School and Staffing Survey.\nAppendix B (continued)\nFactor loadings\nSupportive administration .761 \nPrincipal enforces rules .744 \nStaff share beliefs/values .483 \nLack of parent involvement .740 \n(continued)\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1.
