The results of cross-sectional community surveys\nin the UK showed that 7.4% of patients with diabetes had\na history of active or previous foot ulcers.3 They have up\nto 25% lifetime risk of developing foot ulcers,4 which\nhave a high risk of deteriorating and ultimately leading\nto major lower limb amputation. DFUs precede 84% of\namputations, and nearly one in six patients with DFUs\neventually require an amputation.5,6 The incidence of\nmajor lower limb amputation in people with diabetes is\nmajor lower limb amputation is poor, with a periopera-\nEvaluation of DFUs includes vascular and neurologi-\ncal examinations as well as accurate wound assessment.\nSuccessful management of DFUs consists of offloading\nwith appropriate devices, management of infection,\nwound care including debridement and revascularisa-\ntion when indicated. DFUs are usually associated with\ninfection and inflammation which lead to oedema of\nthe foot. Currently, most appliances use function only\nto alleviate mechanical load on ulcers and do not\nactively address the associated oedema, which can\npotentially be detrimental to ulcer healing. The objec-\ntive of this article is to review the association of foot\noedema and DFUs, including the role of appliances\nwhich reduce oedema.\nAetiology and classification of\ndiabetic foot ulcers\nThe pathogenesis of DFUs is complex and has multiple\ncontributing factors.

The incidence of neuroischaemic\nulcers is 52.3%, neuropathic ulcers 36% and ischaemic\nulcers 11.7%.8 Neuropathy includes sensory, motor and\nautonomic components. Deficient protective sensation\nleads to ulceration on high pressure areas; motor neu-\nropathy results in biomechanical abnormalities and\nautonomic neuropathy causes decreased sweating and\ndry skin which is more prone to hyperkeratosis and\nulceration. Ischaemia is caused by peripheral arterial dis-\nease, resulting in decreased blood supply and tissue per-\nfusion, which significantly compromise ulcer healing.\nPeripheral arterial disease in patients with diabetes\ntends to be multifocal and commonly affects the infra-\npopliteal vessels. Furthermore, disease progression is\nusually accelerated,9 and together with microvascular dis-\nease, results in poor outcomes. Endothelial dysfunction\nappears to be the main cause of both the macrovascular\nand microvascular disease and mechanisms which\ncontribute to this include persistent hyperglycaemia,\nincreased advanced glycation end-products, oxidative\nstress, endothelial inflammation and reduced nitric oxide\nactivity.10,11 In addition, an increase in thromboxane A2, a\nvasoconstrictor and platelet aggregation agonist, has been\nassociated with hyperglycaemia in diabetes, leading to an\nincreased risk of plasma hypercoagulability.12\nImpaired wound healing has also been implicated in\npatients with diabetes. The normal wound healing pro-\ncess entails a complex interplay between connective tis-\nsue formation, cellular activity, and growth factor\nactivation. All three of these physiologic processes are\naltered in the diabetic state and contribute to the poor\nhealing of DFUs.13 Instead of progressing through the\nnormal stages of wound healing, it is now clear that dia-\nbetic ulcers remain in the inflammatory phase of the\nwound healing process. During this delay, there is a ces-\nsation of epidermal growth and migration over the\nAnalysis of fluid from these chronic wounds has dem-\nonstrated elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases\ndirectly resulting in increased proteolytic activity and\ninactivation of the growth factors that are necessary for\nproper wound healing. Additionally, these chronic\nwounds have been found to exhibit deficiencies in growth\nfactors and cytokines along with elevated levels of inhib-\nitory proteases.13 Therefore, impaired wound healing is\nmanifested in aberrant protein synthesis, cellular activity\nand growth factor secretion.\nClassification systems have been developed to grade\nthe severity of diabetic foot ulcers, provide prognosis on\nhealing and aid in the formulation of treatment plans.\nThe widely used Wagner classification for diabetic foot\nulcers (table 1) assesses ulcer depth and the presence of\nosteomyelitis or gangrene.16 The University of Texas sys-\ntem assesses ulcer depth, the presence of wound infec-\ntion, and the presence of clinical signs of lower-extremity\nischaemia.17 This system uses a matrix of grade on the\nhorizontal axis and stage on the vertical axis (table 2). A\nprospective study of 194 patients comparing the two dia-\nbetic foot ulcer classifications concluded that the\nUniversity of Texas classification is a better predictor of\noutcome.18 Increasing stage, regardless of grade, is asso-\nciated with increased risk of amputation and prolonged\nulcer healing time. Recently, the Kobe classification has\nbeen proposed which focuses on the main aetiology of\nulcers and proposes appropriate treatment (table 3)19.\nThese classification systems illustrate the complexity\nand multi-aetiological nature of diabetic foot ulcers.\nTable 1.Wagner classification for diabetic foot ulcers\nGrade Description of ulcer\n0 intact skin in patients who are at risk\nI superficial ulcers with exposed subcutaneous tissue\nII exposed tendon and deep structures\nIII ulcers extend to the deep tissue and have either\nassociated soft tissue abscess or osteomyelitis\nIV ulcers include feet with partial gangrene\nV feet ulcers with more extensive gangrenous tissue\nTable 2.The University of Texas system\nGrade Description of ulcer\n0 an epithelialised wound\n1 superficial ulcers not involving tendon, capsule, or bone\n2 ulcers penetrate to tendon or capsule\n3 ulcers penetrate to bone or joint\nWithin each wound grade there are four stages: stage A are clean\nwounds which are not infected and non-ischaemic; stage B ulcers are\ninfected but not ischaemic; stage C ulcers are ischaemic but not infected;\nand stage D ulcers are both infected and ischaemic. Increasing stage,\nregardless of grade, is associated with increased risk of amputation and\nprolonged ulcer healing time.\nTable 3. Kobe classification\nType Aetiology and treatment of ulcer\n1 ulcers are mainly caused by peripheral neuropathy and\nare treated by pressure relief\n2 ulcers mainly result from peripheral arterial disease\nand the main treatment is revascularisation\n3 ulcers have infection as the main aetiology and require\nearly debridement\n4 ulcers are caused by a combination of all three factors,\ni.e. peripheral neuropathy, peripheral arterial disease\nand infection, and are treated by revascularisation and\ndebridement on a case-by-case basis\nHowever, none of the many grading systems take into\naccount any associated oedema of the foot, illustrating\nthat this remains a poorly understood aspect of DFUs.\nDiabetic foot ulcers and oedema\nThe involvement of the microcirculation in diabetic\nmicroangiopathy contributes to foot ulceration. In addi-\ntion, diabetic microangiopathy, characterised by an\nincrease in skin flux at rest, decreased veno-arteriolar\nresponse, and increased capillary permeability results in\noedema, reduced skin partial oxygen tension and\nincreased carbon dioxide tension.20 In this condition,\ncapillary exchange is altered and nutritional alterations\neventually lead to skin lesions and ulcers.\nThe postural regulation of blood flow is impaired in\npatients with diabetic neuropathy. This disturbance is\ncompatible with a loss of sympathetic vascular tone and\narteriovenous shunting.21,22 In particular, the capability\nof effective precapillary vasoconstriction on standing is\nreduced. This exposes the capillary bed to a high hydro-\nstatic load, resulting in hyperperfusion and increased\nshear force in the microcirculation on dependency which\nin turn leads to thickening of the capillary basement\nmembrane and oedema of the feet and lower legs.23\nIn a prospective study of 314 patients with DFUs, the\npresence of oedema indicated a poorer prognosis24:\nperipheral oedema was more common in patients who\nrequired amputation (58%) or died (55%) than in patients\nposing factor was identified in 95% of the patients, the\nmost common factors being neuropathy, congestive heart\nfailure, and previous deep venous thrombosis.\nThe principles of management of DFUs include\nproper assessment and treatment of different lesions of\nthe foot, including infection control, debridement,\nwound management, revascularisation, other surgery,\nmetabolic control and off-loading. Compression therapy\nmay be used to reduce lower limb oedema to aid ulcer\nhealing.Layeredcompressiontherapyand,morerecently,\ndiabetic socks with mild compression have been found\nto be safe and effective in diabetic patients with adequate\nor mildly reduced arterial blood supply.25,26 The follow-\ning sections further discuss the two methods associated\nwith oedema reduction, offloading and compression\ntherapy, in the management of DFUs.\nOffloading devices in the\nmanagement of DFUs\nAppropriate offloading is a key component in the man-\nagement of diabetic foot disease. The use of TCCs has\nbeen reported to result in excellent ulcer healing rates\nand associated with faster healing compared to other\nremovable devices in a randomised controlled trial.27\nThe TCC is considered to be the gold standard offload-\ning device for plantar neuropathic ulcers, yet it is still not\nwidely used in clinical practice.28 It works by transmit-\nting load from the forefoot to the heel and directly to the\nleg via the cast walls.29 Its main disadvantage is that its\napplication is time-consuming and often associated with\na learning curve. Most centres do not have a physician or\ncast technician available with adequate training or expe-\nrience to safely apply TCCs. Moreover, TCCs do not\nallow assessment of the foot or wound on a daily basis\nand are therefore often contraindicated in cases of soft\ntissue infections or osteomyelitis.\nIatrogenic ulceration where ulceration occurs whilst\nwithin the cast due to pressure or friction from cast\nmaterials is a concern, but the risks are reduced by proper\ncasting techniques.30,31 Other patient complaints include\nimpaired activities of daily living, such as difficulty sleep-\ning comfortably, and bathing difficulties while trying to\navoid getting the cast wet, which reduce patient concord-\nance. Certain designs of TCCs may also exacerbate pos-\ntural instability.32\nRemovable cast walkers are cast-like devices that are\nremovable to allow inspection of the wound and applica-\ntion of topical therapies. Further, removable cast walkers\ncan be easily converted into instant total contact casts by\nwrapping the removable cast walker with cohesive band-\nage or plaster of Paris.33 Wound healing efficacy of\ninstant TCCs has been demonstrated to be comparable\nto TCCs in several randomized controlled trials.34,35\nAlthough these standard offloading devices are\nbelieved to reduce oedema by enabling patients to remain\nrelatively mobile, there has been no objective published\ndata confirming this. Instead, immobilisation of the\nankle with reduced function of the calf muscles which\nact as a venous pump, can theoretically impair venous\nreturn and potentially result in increased foot oedema.\nReducing oedema in the\nmanagement of DFUs\nIn managing DFUs, foot elevation has generally been\nrecommended to reduce oedema and prevent other\nsequential problems. However, foot elevation may\ndecrease tissue oxygenation of the foot relative to the\ndependent position, which allows an increase in blood\nflow within the arterial system. The transcutaneous par-\ntial oxygen tension has been shown to be reduced on foot\nelevation of patients with DFUs.36\nIn diabetic patients with lower limb oedema, mild\ncompression therapy (18\u00ad25 mmHg) applied via socks\nor hosiery during the day was found to decrease calf and\nfoot swelling by reducing oedema, without compromis-\ning vascularity in a study of 18 patients who have normal\n48 The British Journal of Diabetes and Vascular Disease 13(1)\narterial circulation.26 In the treatment of DFUs, compres-\nsion therapy has been used effectively and safely to\nreduce oedema in a diabetic population with adequate\narterial circulation whilst reduced compression was ben-\neficial in patients with arterial compromise in a prospec-\ntive clinical case review involving 44 patients.25 Patients\nwith adequate arterial circulation were treated with a\nfour-layer compression bandage system while the highly\nelastic third layer was excluded in the patients who had\ncompromised peripheral arterial circulation. Healing\noccurred in 81% of patients with adequate peripheral\narterial circulation and 67% of patients with compro-\nmised peripheral arterial circulation. There was no acute\nprogression of lower limb ischaemia in the study.\nHowever, patients with diabetes have a high risk of devel-\noping peripheral arterial disease and many clinicians\nmay be reluctant to use compression therapy.\nThe use of intermittent pneumatic compression by\nthe A-V Impulse System has been shown to be safe and\neffective in other clinical areas such as the reduction of\nposttraumatic swelling and postoperative swelling fol-\nlowing ankle and femoral neck fractures where the rate\nof proximal deep vein thrombosis was also reduced.37-39\nThe A-V Impulse System was developed to mimic the\nnatural physiological processes which maintain blood\nflow and has been shown to improve venous return and\narterial blood flow in the extremities.40,41\nThe proposed mechanism of action is that intermit-\ntent pneumatic compression leads to improved emptying\nof the lower extremity veins and lowered venous pressure\nwhich in turn results in an increase in arterio-venous\npressure gradient and an increase in lower extremity\nlimbs of 30 subjects, the application of intermittent\npneumatic compression to calf and foot greatly enhanced\npopliteal artery blood flow. It was suggested that the flow\nincrease is due to a dramatic drop in the peripheral vas-\ncular resistance as the peak systolic and end diastolic\nflow velocities increase and the reverse-flow component\ndiminishes.45 A direct reduction in peripheral resistance\nhas also been postulated with intermittent pneumatic\ncompression via release of nitric oxide, secondary to\nshear stress increase in the venous radicles. The action of\ndiffused nitric oxide on adjacent arteriolar resistance\nvessels causes them to dilate transiently with concurrent\nAs discussed previously, there is evidence that in\npatients with diabetes, peripheral arterial disease is more\naggressive, difficult to manage and associated with poorer\noutcomes.47 A systematic review demonstrated that\nan intermittent pneumatic compression programme\nappeared promising and may be used in patients\nwith severe peripheral arterial disease who were not can\ndidates for surgical or endovascular revascularization.\nClaudication distance, rest pain, and rates of limb salvage\nwere improved across the spectrum of trials performed,\nassociated with increased arterial blood flow, peak systolic\nvelocity, end diastolic velocity and pulse volume.48 A small\nrandomized study with 12 months follow-up (n=30) in\npatients with stable intermittent claudication concluded\nthat walking distance improved in these patients.49 In\naddition to improved walking distance in stable claudi-\ncants, a prospective randomised controlled study with 1\nyear follow-up found an improvement in the ankle bra-\nchial pressure index, which is a measurement of periph-\neral haemodynamics, and improvement in quality of life.50\nA more recent study in patients with chronic lower\nlimb ischaemia found a significant improvement in\nwound healing and limb salvage rates in the treated\ngroup. The intermittent pneumatic compression was\ndelivered at an inflation pressure of 85\u00ad95mmHg, applied\nfor 2 seconds with rapid rise (0.2 seconds), three cycles\nper minute, for three 2-hourly sessions per day.51\nIn DFUs, a double blind randomised controlled trial\nwith 12 weeks follow-up also showed that oedema reduc-\ntion by a pneumatic foot compression system increased\nthe proportion of wound healing.52 Fifty-nine patients\nwith diabetes were allocated to receive a functioning pul-\nsatile pneumatic foot compression system achieved by\nway of a pump and wrap system following debridement\nof infected foot ulcers. The system included a bladder\ncontaining a foot wrap and a pump that intermittently\nfired bursts of air through tubing to the wrap, thereby\nemptying the foot veins. This group was compared\nagainst a placebo group of 56 patients who received a\nnon-functioning device. Patients were asked to use the\ndevice 8 hours a day, in addition to weekly standard\nwound care that included wound debridement and off-\nloading. Patients treated with active foot compression\nhad a 75% healing rate compared with 51% in the pla-\ninterval, 1.2\u00ad6.8) and a greater degree of oedema reduc-\ntion as shown by mean foot circumference measure-\nplacebo group. However, a substantial number of patients\nin both groups found that it was inconvenient to have the\ndevice on and elevate their legs for 8 hours a day.\nIt would therefore appear that an intermittent pneu-\nmatic compression device with offloading property will\nhave a potential combined effect of oedema reduction\nand offloading of high pressure areas, both of which are\nlikely to improve diabetic foot ulcer healing. Randomised\nclinical trials, looking at a range of DFUs, are warranted\nto assess these effects on ulcer healing.\nConclusion\nTreatment of oedema may further improve the outcomes\nof DFUs, over and above standard therapy. A device\nwhich is comfortable to increase concordance, able to\nprovide intermittent pneumatic compression to actively\nreduce oedema, and allow offloading can be useful for\nthis purpose but further investigation will be required to\nprovide a strong level of evidence.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding\nagency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nConflict of interest Statement\nJ.T. and R.D.L. provide clinical advice to the Diabetic Boot\nCompany Ltd.\nReferences\n1.
