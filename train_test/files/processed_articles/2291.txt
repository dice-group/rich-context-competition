Using a special wave of the Eurobarometer survey, we analysed\nthe general population's perception of health care quality and patient safety in a cross-country setting.\nMethods: We used ordered probit, ordinary least squares and probit analysis to estimate the determinants of\nhealth care quality, and ordered logit analysis to analyse the likelihood of being harmed by a specific medical\nprocedure. The models used population weights as well as country-clustered standard errors.\nResults: We found robust evidence for the impact of socio-demographic variables on the perception of quality of\nhealth care. More specifically, we found a non-linear impact of age on the perception of quality of health care and\npatient safety, as well as a negative impact of poverty on both perception of quality and patient safety. We also\nfound robust evidence that countries with higher corruption levels were associated with worse perceptions of\nquality of health care. Finally, we found evidence that income inequality affects patients' perception vis-\u00e0-vis safety,\nthus feeding into the poverty/health care quality nexus.\nConclusions: Socio-demographic factors and two macro variables (corruption and income inequality) explain the\nperception of quality of health care and likelihood of being harmed by adverse events. The results carry significant\npolicy weight and could explain why targeting only the health care sector (without an overall reform of the public\nsector) could potentially be challenging.\n",
    "reduced_content": "Corruption, inequality and population perception\nof healthcare quality in Europe\nZlatko Nikoloski* and Elias Mossialos\n Keywords: Quality of healthcare, Access to healthcare, Corruption, Inequality, EU\nBackground\nThe health care systems of the European Union (EU)\nmember states have been subject to continuous reform over\nthe last twenty years, mainly stemming from the pressures\nof aging populations and challenges in reforming public\nbudgets. Over the same period, the EU witnessed its biggest\nenlargement (the so called big bang) that brought in\nten new countries \u00ad almost all of which belong to the\ngroup of `transition' countries. The enlargement in 2004\n(and the subsequent one in 2007)a also allowed for the\npossibility of both patients and medical staff to migrate\nacross borders, thus adding further layers of complexity to\nthe extant national health care systems. Given this back-\nground, an evaluation of people's perception of health care\nquality (and of patient safety) is a high-priority task, not\nleast because a careful examination of factors that influence\nperceptions of health care quality could provide the basis\nfor effective policy action aimed at improving access to\nservices and the quality of national health care. Having\nsaid that, evaluating the quality of health care is not a new\ntopic. Indeed, to date, there have been many systematic\ncross-country reviews (and subsequent ranking) of health\ncare systems. Some of them have tried to understand\nthe quality of national health care from a comparative\nperspective, while others (relying on surveys of patient\nsatisfaction/perception of quality) help to provide a\ndeeper understanding of the determinants of health care\nquality at national level.\nat the general population's perception of health care quality\nand patient safety in a cross-country EU setting.

While doing so, we employ additional\nrobustness checks. It is important to note that there are\ntwo limitations to our findings: the lack of control variables\nvis-\u00e0-vis personal-level health care utilisation rates and\nsubjective health evaluations. We have addressed these\nshortcomings by using macro-proxy variables for health\ncare utilisation (health care expenditure as a percentage\nof gross domestic product (GDP)) as well as controlling for\nage, which is usually strongly correlated with subjective\nhealth status evaluation.\nA substantial literature focuses on the issue of quality of\nhealth care (both qualitative and quantitative). The existing\nqualitative body of research can be divided into two main\ngroups, one relying on medical professionals' perceptions of\nquality (see, for example, Robinson et al [1]) and the other\nsolely focusing on patientsb. Patient surveys could offer\na better overview of perception of health care quality\nand safety [2]. According to the authors, evidence\nshows that patient perceptions are distinctive, and often\nconflicting, compared with those of the health care pro-\nviders, which ultimately leads to different assessments of\nhealth care quality. Given that patients are the final users\nof health care services, considering their perceptions\nwould be more important. Furthermore, most of the\nstudies using patient surveys are small-scale studies\nthat use patient interviews and focus groups (Anderson\net al [3], Attree [4], Concato and Feinstein [5], Gerteis\net al [6], Irurita [7], Jun et al [8], Larrabee and Bolden\n[9], Ngo-Metzger et al [10], Radwin [11], Stichler and\nWeiss [12], and Ware and Stewart [13]). Finally, within\nthe body of research that focuses on patients, a sub-section\nconcentrates on patient satisfaction with health care services\nas the only measure of health care quality (Taylor and Cronin\nthis subsection of literature has been fairly controver-\nsial and has received significant criticism from the research\ncommunity (for a detailed discussion , see Crow et al [17]).\nAnother strand of literature has looked at perceptions of\nquality of health care from a quantitative and cross-country\nperspective. To date, there have been two papers that have\nlooked at the issue of patient quality from this perspective.\nCleary et al [18] analysed the quality of health care using\npatient-reported measures of quality in the United States,\nAustralia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\nWendt et al [19] used a truncated sample of 14 EU coun-\ntries to assess the preferences for state involvement, and\nsubsequently, quality of health care across the EU.\nIn addition, a significant body of literature has looked\nat the determinants of what constitutes the core attributes\nof health service quality. Gronroos [20] argues that these\nattributes can be divided into two groups: functional\n(ambience, i.e. description of the form in which the\nservice is delivered) and technical (outcome, i.e. the\nquality of what is delivered). Similar reasoning is found\nin other studies on the topic (Zifko-Baliga and Krampf\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is one study concern-\ning patient safety in a cross-country setting, assessing the\nlikelihood of medication and medical errors in five OECD\ncountries (Cleary et al [18]). Finally, in the context of the\nUS, a burgeoning literature has looked at various aspects of\nquality and performance of HMOs (Health Maintenance\nOrganisation). The overall finding of that sizeable litera-\nture points to a negative link between age and perception\nof quality as well as a negative link between chronic illness\nand perception of quality (Miller and Luft [23,24],).\nFollowing the strands of literature outlined above, in\nthis paper we answer the following three questions:\n(i) What individual and macro-level variables drive the\nperception of quality of healthcare among EU nationals?;\n(ii)What attributes of healthcare play the biggest role\nwhen evaluating the quality of healthcare?;\n(iii)What individual and macro-level variables drive the\nperception of the likelihood of being harmed by\nhospital or non-hospital care?\nMethods\nData\nThe empirical analysis in this paper is based on data from\nthe special Eurobarometer Survey 327, which is part of\na set of surveys conducted on behalf of the European\nCommission. This special Eurobarometer survey was con-\nducted during September and October 2009 and features\nattitudes towards quality of health care as well as the\nlikelihood of experiencing adverse events. Most na-\ntional samples were drawn with a multi-stage, random\nprobability sampling design from the population aged\nstandardised face-to-face interviews were conducted\n(for the smaller countries, like Luxembourg, Malta and\nCyprus, the number was about 500). The German and\nUK samples consist of 1500 respondents. The total size\nof the sample was around 26,000 people. In this paper\nwe analysed data for the 27 countries that currently make\nup the European Union. Data were weighted according to\nthe national weighting procedure with sex, age, region and\nsize of locality entering the iteration procedure. The data\nused in the paper are widely available.\nDependent variables\nIn order to analyse respondents' perceptions vis-\u00e0-vis the\nquality of health care and the likelihood of being harmed\nby hospital or non-hospital care, we focused on two ques-\ntions. The first was: \"How would you evaluate the overall\nquality of health care in our country? Answers were: (1)\nvery good; (2) fairly good; (3) fairly bad; and (4) very bad\"c.\nThe question was used in an ordered probit and OLS\nanalysis. As a robustness check we also constructed an\nalternative measure (0\u00ad1) that was subsequently used\nin a probit analysis. Table 1 provides a snapshot of the\naverage values for this variable. As expected, the Nordic\ncountries and the oldest welfare states of Western Europe\ntend to show perceptions of the highest levels of health\ncare quality. Incidentally, these are the countries with the\nhighest health expenditures both, per capita and as a per-\ncentage of GDP.\nSecond, to analyse the possibility of being harmed by\nhospital or non-hospital care, we relied on the question:\n\"How likely do you think it is that patients could be\nharmed by hospital (or non-hospital) care in our country?\nAnswers were: (1) very likely; (2) fairly likely; (3) not very\nlikely; (4) not at all likely\". Following established practice\nin analysing questions of likelihood, an ordered logit\nmodel was usedd.\nIndependent variables \u00ad individual characteristics\nAs in previous studies (Carlson et al [25], Cleary et al [26],\nHaviland et al [27], Roohan et al [28]) we use age as one of\nthe main explanatory variables. Rather than using dummies\nfor age categories (Wendt et al [19]), we use age and an\nage-squared term to test the possibility of a non-linear\neffect of age on health care quality perception. The\nEurobarometer does not include variables on health status\nand thus we cannot control for ite. As in other studies, we\nTable 1 Patients' perception of quality of healthcare and selected healthcare systems variables\nRank Country Eurobarometer mean\nscore for perception of\nquality of healthcare\nHealth expenditure per\ncapita (current USD)\nTotal health expenditure\n(as % of GDP) average\nNumber of physicians\nSources: Eurobarometer special survey on health (2010), World Development Indicators. The perception of quality of healthcare variable takes values from 1 - very\ngood to 4 - very bad.\nalso control for level of education (Roohan et al [28],\nCarlson et al [25]). Previous research attempts to con-\ntrol for respondents' gender although the results from\nthe extant research, as well as meta-analysis, tend to be\ninconclusive (Cleary et al. [18]).\nIn addition to the variables above, we also control for\nmarital status, differences between rural and urban dwellers\nand size of households. Differences between income groups\nare an important determinant (Schoen et al [29]), especially\nin health care in the context of EU countries, which\nrely on high levels of redistribution. For this purpose,\nwe constructed a category called poor (corresponding\nto the people who have difficulty paying bills most of\nthe time over the last 12 months). Finally, to capture\nthe relative standing of the people in the country, rather\nthan using subjective income assessment, we used an asset\nindex, constructed using factor analysis (for a detailed\nexplanation of asset index creation and usage in survey\nanalysis please refer to Nikoloski and Ajwad [30]).\nIndependent variables \u00ad macro level variables\nEven though the EU comprises countries that are at a\nhigh level of economic development, there is significant\nvariation among countries in terms of macro (economic)\ndevelopments. Hence, it is important to control for them.\nThe level of development is captured by the log of the\nWe also control for the level of economic inequality\n(3-year average Gini coefficient). There is also significant\ninstitutional variation among the countries. Given that all\nof them are, more or less, democratic, while there are\nsignificant differences in terms of bureaucratic quality,\nInternational's Corruption Perception Index. Finally, we\nexperiment with different health care variables. To capture\nthe monetary input, we use data on total health care ex-\npenditure (per capita and as a percentage of GDP). The\nextant research uses the level of health care expenditure\nas an indication of the interventionist power of the state\nin the field of health care. As an indicator for real input, we\nincluded the number of physicians in relation to the popu-\nlation (per 1,000). Physicians are often the first point of\ncontact for patients and make decisions affecting a major\npart of total health care resources. In many countries, they\nact as gatekeepers and are often responsible for transferring\npatients to specialist health care and further care givers.\nAdditional file 1: Table A2 provides a more detailed de-\nscription of the macro level independent variables.\nTable 2 provides a snapshot of the basic macro-level vari-\nables used in our analysis. As mentioned previously, for the\nanalytical purpose of our exercise we used ordered probits,\nOLS and probits (for perception of quality of health care)\nand ordered logits (for likelihood of being harmed by\nhospital or non-hospital care).\nIndependent variables \u00ad criteria for selecting a doctor\nBuilding on this, we then analysed the importance of\ndifferent criteria when assessing the quality of healthcare.\nFor this purpose we used the question: \"Of the following\ncriteria, which are the three most important criteria when\nyou think of high quality healthcare in our country?: (a)\nproximity of hospital and doctors; (b) free choice of doctor;\n(c) respect of a patient's dignity; (d) medical staff that is well\ntrained; (e) a clean environment at the healthcare facility;\n(f) treatment that works; (g) free choice of hospital; (h)\nhealthcare that keeps you safe from harm; (i) no waiting\nlist to get seen and treated; (j) a welcoming and friendly\nenvironment and (k) modern medical equipment\".\nResults\nPerception of quality of care\nThe results of the ordered probit analysis are captured\nin Table 3. We find a non-linear relationship between age\nand perception of quality of health care (the inflection\npoint of the curve occurs around the age of 40 years). In-\ndividuals living in households with a higher wealth index\n(and therefore enjoying a better socio-economic status)\ntend to be associated with better perceptions of health\ncare quality. When it comes to gender, we find evidence\nthat females are more negative (vis-\u00e0-vis perceptions of\nquality of health care) than males (although the magnitude\nof the coefficient is minuscule). Finally (and closely corre-\nsponding to our wealth index findings), the poor tend to\nhave more negative perceptions of health care quality than\nthe non-poor. Of the macro-level variables the Corruption\nPerception Index is the one which is the most interesting,\nlending evidence to the fact that in more transparent\ncountries, the perception of the quality of health care\ntends to be higherf.\nAs a robustness check, we repeated the analysis using\nan OLS and probit methodology, respectively. Additional\nfile 2: Table A1 presents these results, which, confirmed\nour main hypotheses distilled from the ordered probit\nanalysis outlined aboveg,h.\nWe also conducted a secondary robustness check by\nincluding an interaction term between the age category and\nthe proxy for corruption in order to test if the perception of\nquality of healthcare stems from the older generation (i.e.\nthe one which is the heaviest user of healthcare services).\nWhile informative, the results did not yield statistically\nsignificant resultsi.\nDeterminants of quality of healthcare\nBuilding on the analysis and findings above, we pro-\nceeded with determining the statistical significance of\ndifferent quality of health care determinants, while alternat-\ning between models that include individual characteristics,\nmacro-level variables, and/or country dummies. Our results\nare presented in Table 4. It is important to note that the\nindividual characteristics are binominal variables which\nare included as separate independent variables in the\nmodel. The robust results that emerge from this exer-\ncise lend evidence to the statistical significance of the\nfollowing few determinants: choice of doctor, well-\ntrained staff, and, in the majority of instances, proximity\nof doctor and modern medical equipment. The control\nvariables (individual and macro-level variables) tend to\nmaintain the same sign and significance as in the per-\nception of quality exercisej.\nLikelihood of experiencing an adverse event\nWe then proceeded with analysing the likelihood of\nexperiencing a hospital or non-hospital adverse event.\nThe results of our ordered logit analysis are captured\nin Table 5. First, the results suggest that the statistical\nsignificance of the likelihood of experiencing a non-hospital\nadverse event is lower compared with the results of\nthe analysis conducted on the likelihood of experien-\ncing a hospital-related adverse event. However, there\nare some interesting results associated with individual\nsocio-demographic characteristics. As in some of the\ncases above, we find evidence for the existence of a\nnon-linear relationship between age and the likelihood\nof experiencing an adverse event. This relationship,\nhowever, is exhibited only in the context of hospital-\nrelated adverse events (the results are insignificant in\nthe case of non-hospital care). As in some of the exercises\nconducted above, here as well, the poor tend to have\nhigher expectations for the possibility of experiencing\nan adverse event. Interestingly, we find evidence that\nin countries with higher inequality, the perceived like-\nlihood of experiencing adverse events among respon-\ndents tends to be higher. In a way, this finding is a\nvariation of the poor people-likelihood of experiencing\nhospital/non-hospital adverse event nexus, which we\nestablished above.\nWe then repeated the exercise above for all individual\ntypes of adverse events \u00ad hospital infections, incorrect\ndiagnosis, surgical errors, medication related errors, and\nmedical device errors. The results of that analysis broadly\nconfirm our findings and are available upon request.\nIn addition to the analysis we conducted two more\nrobustness checks. The first one assessed the likeli-\nhood of a person suffering an adverse event contingent\nupon their assessment of the quality of healthcare. The\nstoryline that emerges from this analysis confirms our\nmain findings from above. The second robustness check\nwas conducted in order to establish if preferences for\naccess versus treatment increase the likelihood of be-\ning exposed to an adverse event. Our results did not\nfind statistically significant evidence for this, whilst\nproviding evidence for our conclusions from above. As\nin the previous case, the results of this analysis are\navailable upon requestk.\nAdditional robustness checks\nIn addition, we conducted a few overall robustness\nchecks. In the first one, we ran a probit analysis using\nthe dichotomised perception of health care quality as a\ndependent variable and the individual socio-economic\ncharacteristics as independent variables and then sum-\nmarised the fitted values on a country by country basis.\nUltimately, we conducted a simple correlation exercise\nbetween the obtained fitted values and the macro-\neconomic variables used in the analysis above. Our\nresults are reported in Additional file 3: Panel 1. The\nanalysis broadly confirms our findings vis-\u00e0-vis corruption\nand inequality.\nWe conducted similar robustness checks for the like-\nlihood of adverse events variables (both for hospital\nand non-hospital-related harm) and the results of our\nanalysis are presented in Additional file 3: Panels 2 and 3.\nAs in the case above, our results broadly confirm our\ninitial conclusionsl.\nOur additional robustness check includes running\ncorrelations of the perception of quality of health care\nand individual health care attributes (both obtained as\nfitted values from a probit analysis on individual socio-\neconomic and demographic characteristics). The results\nTable 2 Summary of statistics\nVariable Obs Mean Std. Dev. Min Max\nSource: World Development Indicators (WDI), Eurostat and Transparency International.\nare presented in Additional file 3: Panel 4. Here we find\nevidence for a strong correlation between preferences\nfor well-trained doctors and cleanliness of health care\nfacilities on the one hand, and perceived quality of the\nhealth care on the other.\nInteraction between quality of health care and likelihood\nof adverse events\nOur final analysis incorporated the perception of health\ncare quality and likelihood of occurrence of adverse events.\nIn other words, in our last exercise we tried to ascertain\nwhether people with a higher opinion of the health care\nsystem also believe that the likelihood of an adverse\nevent occurring is lower. In conducting the analysis we\nused a similar approach to the one described above \u00ad we\nplotted the fitted values obtained from a probit analysis on\nsocio-economic and demographic characteristics for both\nperception of health care quality and the likelihood of\nadverse events occurring. Our results are presented in\nAdditional file 1: Charts 1, 2 and 3. This analysis un-\ndoubtedly confirms the link between the two variables,\ni.e. people with better perception of health care quality\nalso believe that the likelihood of adverse events is\nsmaller and vice versa, for respondents with a negative\nperception of health care quality, the perceived likeli-\nhood of adverse events increases.\nDiscussion\nThe main aim of this paper is to examine the percep-\ntion of quality of health care, the main determinants\nof health care quality and to examine the perception\nof the likelihood of being harmed by different adverse\nevents (both hospital and non-hospital-related).\nA starting assumption underpinning our analysis was\nthat both individual and macro-level characteristics\nwould determine respondents' perceptions of health\ncare quality as well as the likelihood of being harmed\nby specific adverse events. We find evidence that age\nand socio-economic status, and to some extent, gender,\nact as main determinants of individuals' perception of\nhealth care quality. Moreover, we find robust evidence\nfor a non-linear impact of age on both the perceived\nquality of health care and the perception of being harmed\nby an adverse event. In that respect, our research feeds\nTable 3 Perceptions of quality of healthcare - ordered probit\nTotal health expenditure\nLog of number of doctors per 1000 people\nTable 3 Perceptions of quality of healthcare - ordered probit\n(Continued)\nCountry dummies No yes No\nadj. R-sq\nStandard errors in parentheses.\ninto an emerging body of social sciences research that\nfinds a U-curve relationship between overall satisfaction\nwith services and age.\nSecond and most important, we find evidence that two\nmacro-level variables play a significant role in determining\nthe perception of health care quality and the likelihood\nTable 4 Determinants of quality of healthcare\nOrdered probit Ordered probit Ordered probit Ordered probit OLS OLS OLS OLS\nIndividual socio-economic\ncharacterestics\nNo Yes Yes Yes No Yes Yes Yes\nMacro level variables No No No No No No No No\nContry dummies No No Yes No No No Yes No\nStandard errors in parentheses.\nTable 5 Likelihood of experiencing hospital and non-hospital harm, ordered probit\nof being harmed by hospital and non-hospital care. Our\nanalysis provides evidence for a positive association\nbetween transparency and the quality of health care. In\nother words, in countries with higher public sector\ntransparency and lower corruption, the general public\nseems to be more satisfied with the quality of health\ncare services. More importantly, the perception of the\nlikelihood of being harmed by medical errors increases\nin countries that are more unequal, which is suggestive\nof the possibility of inadequate access to health care,\nand especially to quality health care, for lower socio-\neconomic groups.\nAs noted previously, there are limitations to our analysis\nthat mainly stem from a lack of variables that could help\nus control for the individual level of utilisation of health\ncare services and for subjective health care evaluation.\nThere are, however, ways to deal with these shortcomings\nand we believe that we have addressed them. First, we use\na macro-level aggregate proxy for health care utilisation\n(total healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP). In\naddition, while the survey does not contain a measure of\nsubjective health assessment, given the strong correlation\nbetween age and subjective health assessment, we believe\nthat age could be used as a proxy for health status.\nConclusions\nThere is a possibility for our results to be distilled\ninto policy actions. Improving transparency and fight-\ning corruption across all echelons of the public sector\n(but especially in the health care sector) would help\nto improve peoples' perception of the overall quality\nof health care. Moreover, improving access to health\ncare, especially access for the poorest socio-economic\ngroups would help to improve not only their percep-\ntion of overall health care quality, but it would also\nboost their confidence that they are entitled to good\nhealth care, and more importantly, care that is safe\nand free from harm.\nFinally, our results also point to the fact that there is no\npanacea for an instantaneous improvement in perceptions\nof health care quality. Indeed, our analysis suggests that\nthe perceptions of health care quality and safety are tied\nto much more endemic problems, such as corruption,\nlow transparency and income inequality. This also points\nto the impossibility of a successful reform that would\nonly target the health care system, or, even less so, a\ncertain sector of the health care system. Reform that is\nall-encompassing, that would target all the echelons of the\npublic sector and that would also promote equitable and\ninclusive growth could improve Europe's general public\nperception of health care quality and patients' safety.\nEndnotes\naIn May 2004, ten new countries became EU members:\nCyprus, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, Poland,\nEstonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Hungary. In 2007,\nBulgaria and Romania also joined.\nbFor the purpose of this literature review, the term\n\"patients\" also comprises the general public that uses\nhealthcare services.\ncA detailed description of the variables used in the model\nis provided in Additional file 1: Table A2.\ndAdditional file 4: Table A3 provides a detailed account\nof the questions used as dependent variables.\neHowever, there are proxies that could be used in this\ninstance, such as, for example, age.\nfThe conclusions that stem from this exercise closely\ncorrespond to our findings that rely on the usage of\ncountry dummies. The country dummies suggest a strong\nlink between quality of care and countries that are more\negalitarian and have a better institutional set up. The results\nof this exercise are available upon request.\ngIn addition, we employ a secondary robustness check,\ni.e. we experiment with using age as a categorical variable.\nThe results that we obtain broadly correspond to our main\nfindings.
