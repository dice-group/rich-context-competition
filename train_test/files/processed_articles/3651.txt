    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe 2011 Australian federal budget included a large investment in youth mental health and early intervention services. In\nthis article, we focus on the critical role of agenda setting in the preceding 4 years to examine how and why these services\nwere given such a high priority at this time. We undertook a systematic review of relevant literature, including parliamentary\nHansard transcripts from the House of Representatives and Senate, the final reports of all available parliamentary committees,\ngovernment policy documents, other pertinent documents held by the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aging,\nand media reports from five widely circulated Australian publications/news outlets. We used Kingdon's multiple streams\nframework to structure analysis. We highlight three factors that were influential in getting youth mental health issues onto\nthe policy agenda: (a) the strategic use of quantitative evidence to create a publicly visible \"problem,\" (b) the marshalling of\nthe \"public\" to create pressure on government, and (c) the role of serendipity. Overall, we found the decision to prioritize\nyouth mental health resulted from a combination of advocacy for a well-articulated policy solution by high-profile, influential\npolicy entrepreneurs, and political pressure caused by an up swell of national support for mental health reform. Our findings\nhighlight the socio-political factors that influence agenda setting and health policy formulation. They raise important ethical\nand strategic issues in utilizing research evidence to change policy.\n",

EPPIC is an integrated mental health service\naimed at youth aged 15 to 24 years with a first episode of\npsychosis.

Each stream contains its own\nprocesses and actors and operates independently of the others\naccording to its own set of rules and dynamics. Kingdon argued\nthat, at certain times, the actions of advocates, or policy entre-\npreneurs, can lead to the coupling of these three streams to open\na \"policy window\" that leads to action in the form of policy\nrecent iterations of the multiple streams approach have relaxed\nthe condition that the streams are independent and argued that\nthis approach is best viewed as a conceptual device to help the\nanalyst identify the elements that contribute to policy \"rational-\nity\" (Zahariadis, 1999). A summary of key concepts that under-\npin a multiple streams analysis is outlined below.\nProblems\nThe problem stream encapsulates any problems that could\ncome to hold decision makers' attention. At any one time,\nthere are many potential problems that decision makers\ncould address but, for a small subset of these, there will be a\ngrowing belief that something can and should be done.\nPossible reasons for the ascendency of such a belief include\na focusing event such as a crisis or disaster, publication of\nnumeric or other indicators that suggest a worsening of the\nproblem, or feedback that an existing policy or program is\nPolicy Solutions\nKingdon conceptualizes potential policy proposals or \"solu-\ntions\" as undergoing development, recombination, discussion,\nand debate within a policy community comprising a usually\nsmall group of influential people inside and outside of govern-\nment. This process yields a limited number of technically fea-\nsible, and/or affordable policy contenders. These need to be\nfrequently advocated and discussed within the policy commu-\nnity if they are to gain traction. Kingdon argues that consensus\non a policy contender can facilitate its diffusion. Furthermore,\nhe suggests that a \"problem\" is more likely to rise to the top of\nthe policy agenda if a well-defined, widely accepted policy\nPolitical Context\nThe political stream is an entity that comprises elements such\nas: public mood, pressure group campaigns, election results/\nchanges of government, and ideological divides within and\nbetween the major political parties. For a policy solution to\nbe seriously considered, it must be politically palatable for\nthe government of the day.\nPolicy Entrepreneurs\nPolicy entrepreneurs are individuals who invest time and\nresources in seizing opportunities where change is more\nlikely and push for their particular policy solution to a per-\nceived problem in the political sphere. Policy entrepreneurs\nare important actors in coupling a problem with a policy\nsolution so as to facilitate its political adoption that results in\npolicy change.\nPolicy Windows\nPolicy windows are the final major element of Kingdon's\nframework. They are defined as opportunities that make deci-\nsions and action more likely. Policy windows can open expect-\nedly (with a change in government and federal budgets) or\nunexpectedly (as a result of a pressing problem or disaster, or\nby a shift in national mood that makes government action seem\nimperative; Kingdon, 2003). Windows are often open for a\nshort period of time, so policy entrepreneurs must be ready\nwith their problem well-defined and framed, an acceptable\npolicy solution to that problem and have political support for\nthe solution.An opportunity may quickly pass if it is not seized.\nMethod\nData Collection\nOur analysis is based on a two-stage literature review of key\ntexts in the public domain. First, relevant documents were\ncollected from the following sources: (a) transcripts of par-\nliamentary proceedings (recorded in Hansard) from the\nAustralian House of Representatives and Senate, (b) the final\nreports of all available Australian government parliamentary\ncommittees, (c) Australian government policy documents,\nFigure 1. The Kingdon multiple streams model.\nWhiteford et al. 3\nand (d) other pertinent documents held by the Commonwealth\nDepartment of Health. We also reviewed media reports from\nfive widely circulated Australian publications/news outlets:\nThe Australian, the Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, The\nCanberra Times, and Australia's ABC network.\nParliamentary records were searched for the period May\nmonth post 2011 budget. This date range was set both for\npragmatic reasons, because of the large amount of data that\nwere collected and to isolate the political debate relating spe-\ncifically to the 2011 budget. Other sources (media articles,\ngovernment documents, and the final reports of parliamen-\ntary committees) were examined across a wider period\ntrends.\nTexts were included in our study if they explicitly men-\ntioned \"youth mental health services,\" Headspace or EPPIC,\nor \"early intervention services.\" While early intervention for\nmental health is applicable across the lifespan, in this par-\nticular context, \"early intervention\" was often used in con-\njunction with youth mental health. Prominent or repeated\nmentions of media coverage and constituent concerns by\npoliticians in Hansard were also identified and the articles\nretrieved.\nThe second stage of review involved a search of academic\nliterature to refine findings drawn from primary sources and\nprovide context. Electronic databases searched included\nMEDLINE, PsycINFO and Embase (searched via Ovid),\nAustralian Public Affairs Full Text (APAFT), Humanities\nand Social Sciences Collection, TV NewsArchive, Rural and\nRemote Health Database,Australasian Medical Index (AMI),\nAustralian Public Affairs Information Service-Health\n(APAIS-Health), Health Issues in Criminal Justice (CINCH-\nHealth), Health and Society Database, Health Collection,\nand Media Scan (via Informit).\nUsing this search strategy, we identified 143 Hansard\ntranscripts, 110 media articles, 11 non\u00adpeer-reviewed publi-\ncations (grey literature), and 20 peer-reviewed journal arti-\ncles relevant to Australian youth mental health policy over\nthe period of interest.\nData Analysis\nFor the first step of analysis, we carried out a content analy-\nsis of Hansard to provide a rough proxy measure of changes\nin the importance of youth mental health on the political\nwords, mental health, youth mental health, headspace, and\nEPPIC, were counted over the 4-year period and for the year\nprior and afterward.\nFor the second stage of analysis, a deductive approach\nwas employed, using Kingdon's multiple streams frame-\nwork (Kingdon, 2003) as a means to operationalize/code\ndata. This approach was partly guided by the pragmatic need\nto sort large volumes of data, which rendered an inductive,\ngrounded-theory approach (Strauss & Corbin, 1990) infea-\nsible (J. Smith, Bekker, & Cheater, 2011).\nAll documents identified in the first and second stages of the\nreview process were reviewed and their contents categorized in\nan Excel\u00ae spreadsheet template according to whether they\nrelated to (a) policy problems, (b) policy solutions, and/or (c)\npolitical issues, based on Kingdon's framework, as defined\nabove. \"Problem\" representations were further categorized as\nindicators, feedback, or focusing events (Kingdon, 2003).\nUsing this method, the major problems, policy solutions,\nand political events between January 2008 and the end of\nMay 2011, relating to youth mental health, were identified\nand described. Finally, we drew conclusions about cause and\neffect relationships between different spheres of influence\n(i.e., different \"streams\").\nResults\nChange Over Time in Mention of (Youth) Mental\nHealth in Hansard\nMentions of mental health rose sharply in Hansard docu-\nmental health,\" \"EPPIC,\" and \"Headspace\" also increased\nover the time in the lead up to the funding announcement in\nProblems, Policy Solutions and Political Context in\nYouth Mental Health\nKey themes were found in all data sources relating to prob-\nlems, policy solutions and political issues relevant to youth\nmental health, the role of policy entrepreneurs and the char-\nacter of the policy window. These are described below and\nsummarized in Table 1.\nFigure 2. Mental health key words in Senate and House of\nNote. EPPIC = Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centres.\n4 SAGE Open\nThe Problem Stream\nThere were two ways in which the problem of youth mental\nhealth was constructed in public and policy spheres:\nIndicators that quantified the extent and burden of youth\nmental health were used to highlight the seriousness of the\nissue while evidence to suggest that youth were underserved\nby existing mental health services promoted the need for spe-\ncialized youth mental health services. Although there was no\nsingle focusing event to spur action, advocates and the media\nused statistical data to quantify the burden of youth mental\nhealth and suicide and highlight the crisis of youth mental\nhealth. However, there were constraints on how government\n\"clean-up\" bill, and at the same time, the Labor government\nwas under sustained pressure from the Liberal dominated\ncoalition, in opposition, over its financial management.\nUse of indicators.Hansard transcripts of speeches often\nincluded data on the population prevalence of mental disor-\nders in youth (Commonwealth of Australia: House of Repre-\nsentatives, 2010). For example, Hansard excerpts that framed\nmental health and suicide as a problem of youth included\nphrases like: \"half of the Australians aged between 12 and 25\nwill experience a diagnosable episode of mental illness\"\n(Commonwealth of Australia: House of Representatives,\nunder 44\" (Commonwealth of Australia: House of Represen-\nMedia stories also focused on the burden of youth mental\nillness reporting statistics that \"75 percent of mental health\nproblems will appear by age 25\" (\"A Man on a Timely\nMission,\" 2010) and \"one in three young Australians will\nexperience mental illness by their 25th birthday\" (Australian\nAssociated Press, 2008). In addition, the media emphasized\nthe high level of youth need for mental health services (Jones,\nIndicators of persistently low levels of mental health ser-\nvice utilization among young people were reported in the\nHealth and Wellbeing Survey (Slade, Johnston, Browne,\nAndrews, & Whiteford, 2009). This issue was identified as a\nmajor concern in Senate enquiries in 2008 (The Senate\n(The Senate Finance and Public Administration References\nCommittee, 2010). It also featured in parliamentary debate\n(Commonwealth of Australia: House of Representatives,\n2011) and numerous academic articles (Boyd, Hayes, Wilson,\nInitiatives: Headspace--National Youth Mental Health\nEconomic losses from untreated mental illness, in general,\nwere also highlighted in parliamentary debate, the academic\nliterature, and the media. The cost to the economy of untreated\nmental illness was estimated at A$30 billion in lost productiv-\nity and lost lives. Mental illness was identified as a major con-\ntributor to unemployment and to long-term receipt of welfare\n(Australian Associated Press, 2008; Butterworth, Burgess, &\nWhiteford, 2011; Commonwealth of Australia: House of\nRepresentatives, 2010; Commonwealth of Australia: Senate,\nTable 1.

Political turmoil within Labor ranks before the election\n(culminating in a change in prime minister) and an opposition with a strong policy on certain youth\nmental health services made it politically expedient to act.\nPolicy entrepreneurs High-profile mental health advocates, primarily represented in the public domain by Pat McGorry, Ian\nHickie, and John Mendoza engaged in continuous media and public criticism of the status quo and\nlobbied both political parties for change.\nThe opening of a window The 2011 Australian federal budget represented a rational and predictable window for action to be\ntaken on mental health.\nNote. EPPIC = Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centres.\nWhiteford et al. 5\nChant, Lloyd, & Harris, 2011). At the same time, the federal\nLabor government was under pressure to return the budget to\nsurplus following the 2008 global financial crisis\n(Commonwealth of Australia: House of Representatives,\n2010) so parliamentary debate focused on increasing youth\nparticipation in employment or training and education by\ninvesting in mental health services (Commonwealth of\nAustralia: House of Representatives, 2010).\nFeedback from existing programs.In parliamentary debates\n(Commonwealth of Australia: House of Representatives,\nmainstream mental health services were described as inap-\npropriate for youth with emerging mental health problems.\nAmong the explanations offered for this situation were that\nparents and mainstream mental health professionals often\nmistook youth mental illness for a normal part of adoles-\ncence (Commonwealth of Australia: House of Representa-\ncare professionals were not equipped to deal with youth\nproblems (Commonwealth of Australia: House of Represen-\ntatives, 2011) and that negative first experiences of seeking\nhelp discouraged further efforts to obtain assistance (Cohen,\nMedlow, Kelk, & Hickie, 2009). Parliamentarians identified\nthe following major barriers to adequate services for young\nmental health consumers: fragmentation of the mental health\nsector, lack of collaboration and co-ordination, and poor\nintersectoral linkages (Commonwealth of Australia: House\nThe research literature identified multiple reasons why\nyoung people did not seek help for their mental health.

Parliamentarians agreed that these\nbarriers to youth access could not be overcome using exist-\ning mainstream health services (Commonwealth ofAustralia:\nvices found that much of the 2006 Council of Australian\nGovernnments (COAG) National Action Plan funding had\nbeen provided to generic services.

They argued through the media that\nthere was a moral imperative for government to urgently act\non youth mental health to prevent a generation being lost to\nchronic illness or premature death.\nAdvocates argued that mental health suffered from a\nsocial neglect that would be unacceptable in treatment of\nphysical conditions (Australian Associated Press, 2010a;\nMcGorry was quoted as saying,\nFailure to invest in early psychosis reform will result in another\nlost generation of young Australians consigned to unnecessary\ndisability as well as premature death from suicide and\nMedia claims were repeated in parliamentary debates and\nfocused political and public attention on the tragedy of youth\nmental illness and suicide (Commonwealth of Australia:\nHouse of Representatives, 2010; Commonwealth of\nAustralia: House of Representatives, 2011).\nCompeting \"problems.\" Governments often find it difficult to\nprioritize spending on programs, such as early intervention\nand preventative programs, where the benefits are arguably\nlong-term while the costs are immediate (Head & Redmond,\n2011). The Labor government faced a number of political\nand financial constraints on their capacity to invest in youth\nmental health. These included large clean-up bills after\nunprecedented natural disasters along much of Australia's\nsubject to persistent criticism from the Opposition over\nwasteful spending and demands that they honor their elec-\ntion commitment to return the budget to surplus by 2012-\nThe Policy Solutions Stream\nHeadspace and EPPIC were the primary policy solutions\nadvanced to address the youth mental health \"problem.\"\nAdvocates argued that these programs were effective, had\n6 SAGE Open\nevidence of prior success, and were ready to be scaled up to\nmeet needs. The option of taking no action (by either invest-\ning in other mental health services or not investing in mental\nhealth at all) and proposals to mainstream youth care were\nnot advocated. The proposed \"one-stop\" policy solutions\n(Headspace and EPPIC) were clearly defined and conceptu-\nally simple. They also had the advantage of having been pre-\ntested in a small-scale pilot study domestically and on a\nlarger scale, internationally. Headspace had received some\nEPPIC had been operating in Australia since 1992 but on a\ngeographically limited scale. Similar models of care had,\nhowever, been adopted in other countries, most notably in\nthe United Kingdom, where there had been significant\ninvestment in early intervention services for psychoses\nHeadspace and EPPIC also had high-profile policy advo-\ncates lobbying politicians and policy makers. These included:\nIan Hickie, a founder and later director of Headspace; Pat\nMcGorry, Executive Director of Orygen Youth Health, the\nmental health organization that developed and ran EPPIC,\nand a director of Headspace; and John Mendoza, CEO of\nwhat was then the Mental Health Council of Australia, the\npeak mental health advisory body to the federal government.\nTheir proposed policy options received endorsement in the\nmedia and parliament as a \"solution\" to youth mental illness\npart of a \"collaborative continuum of care\" (Commonwealth\nwas better able to meet the needs of young people than exist-\ning overburdened mainstream services that prioritized care\nforpeoplewithsevereandchronicmentalillnesses(McGorry,\nThe Political Stream\nThe political context in the 4 years preceding the 2011 bud-\nget was characterized by the political upheaval of replacing a\nfirst-term Labor Prime Minister in June 2010 followed by a\nclosely fought election that produced a minority Labor gov-\nvictory had raised expectations that youth mental health\nwould be part of the new government's \"revolutionary\"\nnational health reforms (Commonwealth of Australia:\nMinister & Minister for Health and Ageing, 2010). These\nvided little new funding commitments to mental health\nTranscripts of parliamentary debate around this time\nreveal that politicians were conscious of the growing public\ncriticism about the lack of funding for mental health in the\nnational health reforms (Commonwealth of Australia: House\nof Representatives, 2010; Commonwealth of Australia:\nSenate, 2010). The media initially reported that government\naction was pending, for example, \"[that Headspace would]\nbe well positioned to make the most of our health reform\ndecisions\" (Jenkins, 2009). However, later media comments\nby the then health minister after the 2010 federal budget sug-\ngested that mental health reform would occur as part of\nnational health reform at an unspecified future date (B.\nPoliticians acknowledged increasing criticism that the\noverall level of funding to mental health was low compared\nwith physical health, with mental health labeled a \"poor rela-\ntion\"(CommonwealthofAustralia:HouseofRepresentatives,\nThe resignation of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and his\nreplacement by Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard on the\nof a letter signed by over 60 of the nation's peak mental\nhealth organizations, demanding that greater attention be\npaid to mental health in the wider health care reforms.\nHowever, the sustained high media profile achieved by men-\ntal health advocates, combined with the unflattering media\ncomparisons of the Labor and previous Liberal Government's\nrecords on mental health, positioned mental health as an\nissue to which the new Gillard-led government needed to\nrespond.\nThe Labor government was being criticized by the oppo-\nsition who strongly advocated for mental health investment,\nincluding in youth services, both before the August 2010\nelection, and after their narrow election loss.

They included the highly visi-\nble public presence of 2010 Australian of the Year, Pat\nMcGorry (Commonwealth of Australia: House of\nRepresentatives, 2010), John Mendoza, and Ian Hickie.\nThe naming of Professor McGorry as Australian of the\nYear in 2010 provided important exposure for mental health\nissues and enabled other mental health advocates to argue for\nbetter youth mental health and mental health services more\ngenerally(AustralianAssociatedPress,2011a;Commonwealth\nofAustralia: Senate, 2010). Professor McGorry used his status\nto highlight the low commitments to mental health in 2010 and\nwas quoted as saying: \"[the] Government . . . is pumping all its\nprecious fuel into acute health while mental health is left to run\non fumes\" (McGorry, 2010b). McGorry was also quoted in\nparliament as describing the funding for EPPIC in the 2010\nbudget as \"[only enough to build] a heavily diluted cardboard\ncut-out service lacking many of the core features of EPPIC\"\n(Commonwealth of Australia: House of Representatives,\nof the house responded to media appearances and comments\nby this core group of policy entrepreneurs and also attempted\nto obtain experts' approval for their policies (Commonwealth\nof Australia: House of Representatives, 2010).\nPolicy entrepreneurs were engaged in creating a further\nfocusing event to publicize their criticism of Labor's commit-\nment to mental health: John Mendoza's public resignation on\nCommission on Mental Health, a Commission that the Labor\ngovernment itself had established. In his resignation letter,\nMendoza (2010) argued that \"it is now abundantly clear that\nthere is no vision or commitment from the Rudd Government\nto mental health\" and that the government was \"publicly\nclaiming credit for the increased investment in mental health\nwhen almost all of this is a consequence of the work of the\nHoward Government.\" The contents of his letter were reported\nnationally (Fyfe & Star, 2010). Mendoza's resignation ensured\nthat mental health received media coverage in the lead up to\nthe August 2010 election and Hansard records an extensive,\noften vituperative debate after Mendoza's resignation. His\ncomments were seized on by the opposition as an indication of\nwider problems within the Rudd's Labor Government\n(Commonwealth of Australia: House of Representatives,\nMental health was further promoted as an issue by the\nhighly visible public advocacy organization GetUp! It coop-\nerated with Mendoza after his resignation to highlight mental\nhealth issues, generally, and youth mental health, specifi-\ncally. In the months before the August 2010 election, GetUp!\nran a campaign that included candlelight vigils across the\ncountry, National TV ads, three full-page newspaper ads\nfunded by donations, a mass emailing campaign to politi-\ncians, and the delivery to the Government of a petition signed\nCohesiveness and unity among professionals in the men-\ntal health sector was publically acknowledged as important\ngroup of advocates, the Independent Mental Health Reform\nGroup (comprising Monsignor David Cappo, Professors\nPatrick McGorry and Ian Hickie, Sebastian Rosenberg, John\nMoran, and Matthew Hamilton), released a report \"Including,\nConnecting, Contributing: A Blueprint to Transform Mental\nHealth and Social Participation in Australia.\" This report\nstrongly encouraged the Government to invest in services\nthat were ready for immediate implementation (Independent\nMental Health Reform Group, 2011). The coalition's August\n2010 plan and final budget announcement broadly accorded\nwith the Blueprint's recommendations (Boxall, 2011).\nThese policy entrepreneurs successfully constructed and\nmaintained youth mental health as a problem demanding\npolitical attention. The policy solution--two early interven-\ntion programs for youth--was attached to a problem in ways\nthat resonated nationally. These solutions were just as well\npublicized as the problems they addressed and advertised as\nready to be rolled out. Professor Hickie argued in a radio\ninterview hours before the 2011 budget announcement on\nMay 10th, that these programs were \"shovel-ready\" and so\nshould be funded immediately (Australian Associated Press,\n2011a). Widespread lobbying by policy entrepreneurs,\nincluding their partnership with GetUp!, was critical to open-\ning the policy window. So was bipartisan support for mental\nhealth reform.\nDiscussion\nAll five main elements of Kingdon's framework--problems,\npolicies, politics, policy actors, and policy windows--could\nbe identified at work in this analysis. A social condition,\nyouth mental illness, was identified as a problem requiring\naction, using data from suicide rates, burden of illness, ineq-\nuity in access to services, economic costs of not treating men-\ntal illness, and through the argument that existing programs\nwere not fit for purpose in dealing with the problem. This\n8 SAGE Open\neffort was aided by focusing events such as the public resig-\nnation of a key advocacy figure. Early intervention was the\npolicy solution claimed by these high-profile policy entrepre-\nneurs as effective, having demonstrated success and being\nreadily scalable to meet the recognized need.\nThe Role of Evidence in Achieving Reform\nEvidence was used for policy advocacy, but it was not the\nsole reason why youth mental health reform reached the\nthreshold where a policy solution was adopted. The way the\nproblem was framed, in terms of the high prevalence and low\ntreatment rates of mental illness, was not new; the data had\nbeen available for many years. However, this research evi-\ndence was marshaled to construct the problem, and refer-\nences to the effectiveness of the proposed programs were\nused to justify their adoption. Evidence was presented in the\nmedia by highly effective advocates and supported by media\nadvocacy campaigns by GetUp! These effectively generated\na perceived change in national mood that convinced politi-\ncians that something should be done. Widespread dissemina-\ntion of early intervention as a policy persuaded them that\nsomething could be done.\nThe debate, including dissent, within academic and pro-\nfessional communities about the evidence base for the long-\ntermeffectivenessandcost-effectivenessofearlyintervention\nin reducing the overall burden of mental health is well docu-\nmented (see, for example, Bosanac, Patton, & Castle, 2010;\nPelosi, 2008; The RoyalAustralian and New Zealand College\nof Psychiatrists, 2009; The Senate Finance and Public\nAdministration References Committee, 2010), but beyond\nthe scope of this article to address. Interestingly, however,\nthis debate did not appear to significantly affect the political\ntrajectory of the publicised problem or its solution and was in\nfact primarily publicized in the media after the federal gov-\nernment had announced its decision to implement their\npolicies.\nThe Role of the (Media-Savvy) \"Public\" in\nCreating Political Pressure\nAn important factor in this case study was the increasing\npolitical will for change. The political stream was dominated\nby Government reactions to a perceived overwhelming pub-\nlic pressure for change, as evidenced by public support for\nthe GetUp! campaign, and the endorsements of Opposition\npolicies by highly influential mental health advocates. Public\npressure, however, did not necessarily reflect the views of a\nrepresentative section of the voting public. Rather, it was a\ngroup that could be termed \"the conspicuous public,\" those\nwho most effectively utilized social media to make their\nviews known, and thus became important influencers of\nagenda setting on this issue. A recent study has suggested\nthat the \"youth vote\" (below 35) may have decided the out-\n(Brooker, 2011). If this is so, then support for youth issues\nmay have increased a political party's chances of success.\nSerendipity\nThe role of serendipity in policy processes should not be\nunder-estimated. The unexpected change in leader of the\nLabor party in 2010 and the election of a new government in\nthe same year provided an opportunity for a new leader to\nmove away from the previous leader's non-committal stance\non investing in mental health. This support's Kingdon's\nargument that political timing and context, not all of which\ncan be predicted, are essential for policy change (Hall, 2004;\nLimitations\nThe findings of the study should be viewed in light of its\nlimitations. First, the short time period used to analyze this\ncase study does not take account of policy developments\nover the span of decades. A short time period may fail to\ncapture some of these explanatory elements, particularly in\nthe policy stream. The benefit of examining a short policy\ntime frame is that it can examine the role of short-term politi-\ncal pressures and focusing events. Second, the conclusions\ndrawn from an analysis of information in the public domain\nis almost certainly incomplete. Under recent amendments\nmade to the Archives act of 1983, Cabinet records are now\npublically available after 20 years rather than the previous\nfuture analysis with benefit of access to cabinet documents\nand the recollections of key policy actors will enable a better\nassessment of the accuracy of the conclusions we have\ndrawn. Third, the Kingdon framework describes agenda set-\nting rather than the implementation of policy. It was beyond\nour scope to examine the extent to which the new services\nactually created the outcomes intended by policy. This is an\nimportant area for future study.\nConclusion\nWe analyzed the case study of youth mental health reform\nusing Kingdon's multiple streams approach to investigate when\nand how evidence may have informed agenda setting. Our\nfindings suggest that the policy solutions most likely to succeed\nare those that are pre-packaged and publicized, are seen to\naddress an identifiable and quantifiable problem, and are sup-\nported by high-profile and credible public figures. However,\nthe fact that some research evidence (e.g., the evidence base for\nthe cost-effectiveness of early intervention) did not enter the\npublic debate, or did not feature prominently, raises a number\nof issues that require careful consideration in terms of the effec-\ntive use of research evidence to achieve long-term mental\nhealth reforms. Our analysis also identified an increasing \"dou-\nble-role\" of scientific researcher and policy advocate. The\nWhiteford et al. 9\npoliticized use of evidence by policy entrepreneurs for the\nadvancement of funding to one part of the mental health system\nhas been shown in this study to be a successful approach; how-\never, the scientific community should be conscious that selec-\ntive reportage of research evidence runs the risk of reinforcing\na piecemeal and ad-hoc approach to reform (Whiteford, Harris,\n& Diminic, 2013). We suggest that the path toward strategic,\nlong-term, evidence-informed mental health governance is per-\nhaps better served by developing and building upon an open\npolitical culture, fluid knowledge flow across research and\npolicy realms, and the development of a skilled bureaucratic\nworkforce enabled to make the best use of evidence to inform\nThe success of policy advocates increased the visibility of\nyouth mental health in the political sphere but only future\nresearch will establish whether this policy change has pro-\nduced lasting changes for the better or perpetuated a cycle of\nad-hoc reform prompted by the need to address a perceived\ncrisis created by policy advocates.\n"
