Participants were 206 male serious juvenile offenders interviewed as\npart of the Pathways to Desistance Study. The model explained between 35% and 47% of variance in gang reengagement intentions.\nHowever, only three variables made a unique statistically significant contribution to the model (punishment if gang rules are broken,\nimportance of gang membership, and moral disengagement), with the strongest predictor being importance of gang membership.\nThe results suggest that challenging young offenders' perceptions about the importance of gang membership might be particularly\neffective in reducing gang reengagement intentions after incarceration.\n1. Introduction\nResearch to date has largely focused on identifying the\nfactors associated with initial gang involvement and the\ncriminological outcomes of gang membership [1]. Although\npast research has established that self-reported intentions to\nremain in a gang is a correlate of continued gang involve-\nment, factors associated with the intention to rejoin a gang\nafter being incarcerated, however, have not been studied\nsystematically. Intentions are self-instructions to perform\nparticular behaviours or to obtain certain outcomes [2]\nand are, according to the theory of planned behaviour [3],\nthe theory of reasoned action [4, 5], and the model of inter-\npersonal behaviour [2], the most immediate and important\ndeterminants of behaviour. Bagozzi [6] further suggested\nthat intentions or self-predictions were superior predictors\nof behaviour than desires, attitudes, subjective norm, and\nperceived control over behaviour. Given the robust associ-\nation between gang membership and delinquency [1], the\ndetrimental effects of prolonged gang membership (e.g.,\nincreased violent behaviour, precocious transitions, violence\nvictimization, suicide ideation, and unemployment), and the\npotential for these negative effects to accumulate over time\n(e.g., [7, 8]), it is imperative that researchers and practitioners\nalike learn more about this behavioural intention.\nAlthough hampered by a lack of consensus about how\nto define \"gangs\" and \"gang membership\" [9, 10], recent\nresearch estimates that in the United States there are an\n40% of those are adolescents [11]. Previous research exam-\nining what motivates youth to join gangs has identified a\nmultitude of intersecting variables, including the community\nor neighbourhood context (e.g., availability or perceived\navailability of drugs, community arrest rate, and availabil-\nity of firearms), family dynamics (e.g., parental proviolent\nattitudes, child maltreatment, low attachment, and poor\nmonitoring), socioeconomic variables (e.g., low education,\npoverty, and ethnic minority status), peer influences (e.g.,\nassociation with peers who engage in delinquency or other\nproblem behaviour), school factors (e.g., low academic\nachievement and aspirations, low commitment), and indi-\nvidual characteristics (e.g., violence involvement, antisocial\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nJournal of Criminology\n2 Journal of Criminology\nbeliefs, substance use, and conduct disorder) (see [12, 13]).\nResearchers, however, have advised that the factors associated\nwith initial gang joining may not prove useful in predicting\nsustained gang involvement and continued gang involvement\nafter reentry to the community following incarnation [14].\nConsequently, research examining the factors associated with\nthe intention to rejoin a gang after incarceration is an\nimportant direction for research so that policy can be directed\nat youth most likely to remain in a gang for extended periods\nof time, in an effort to prevent the detrimental physical,\nbehavioural, and psychological outcomes that prolonged\ngang involvement has on both individuals (e.g., involvement\nin delinquent activity, high risk sexual activity) and society\n(i.e., serious and violent offences, homicides, sale and distri-\nbution of drugs, and perceptions of disorder and fear).\nA small number of studies have linked having run away\nfrom home to youth gang involvement. For instance, in a\nsample of gang involved youth, three quarters of girls and\none-third of boys reported having run away from home at\nleast once [15, 16], while other research has found that many\ngang-affiliated youth have run away from home and joined\ngangs to obtain protection from dysfunctional and/or abusive\nfamily environments [17]. Research to date has not examined\nthe relationship between having run away from home and\nduration of gang involvement/desistance. However, assuming\nthat youth join gangs to escape from dysfunctional family life,\nit seems likely that such youth are more likely to intend to\nrejoin a gang after incarceration.\nEthnic minority youth are disproportionately represented\nin gangs, particularly Hispanic/Latino and African American\nyouth [13, 18]. Indeed, recent figures provided by law enforce-\nment agencies indicate that approximately 46% of gang\nmembers are Hispanic/Latino, 35% African-American/black,\n11% white, and 7% other race/ethnicity (The National Youth\nthat ethnic minorities' gang involvement persists longer. A\nhigher rate of gang affiliation among minority youth has been\nsuggested to be in part a by-product of population migration\n[20, 21]. Vigil [22], for instance, suggested that immigrant\nyouth may experience difficulties in dealing with life in a new\nculture, as well as language, cultural, and economic barriers,\nand as a result, they may perceive that they have \"few options\nor resources to better their lives\" and \"seek a place where they\nare not marginalized\" (p. 7).\n1.1. Characteristics of Family. Although the family character-\nistics (structural variables and social process variables) of\ngang involved youth have not been well documented [23],\nsolace from a violent family life, including frequent conflict\nand abuse among parents, has been found to be a major moti-\nvation for gang joining [24]. Furthermore, Patterson et al. [25]\nsuggested that when family members use violence to control\nthe behaviour of others within the family unit, children learn\nto control others in a similar manner and carry this forward\ninto their interactions with others, which leads to rejection\nby more conventional peers and the weakening of prosocial\nbonds (see also [26]). As a result of this rejection, individuals\nmight have to cope with adverse circumstances on their\nown, thus making them more vulnerable to both short- and\nlong-term pressures from antisocial influences (e.g., delin-\nquent peers, which may include youth gang members)\nand the internalisation of antisocial values (e.g., delinquent\nbeliefs).\n1.2. Peer Influences. Research indicates that peer delinquency\n(which may result in incarceration) is one of the strongest\npredictors of individual delinquency [27], and that gang\ninvolvement is related to affiliation with delinquent peers\n(e.g., [28]). However, gang membership has also been\nobserved to be a significant predictor of individual delin-\nquency while controlling for associations with delinquent\npeers [29], suggesting that gangs might be distinct from other\ndeviant peer groups, and indicating the need to examine the\nimpact of delinquent peer associations (as indexed by number\nof incarcerated friends, in this case), on the intention to rejoin\na gang after incarceration.\n1.3. Gang Membership Characteristics. Extensive research\nsuggests that even in the presence of money sharing, gang\nmembership is unlikely to offer any substantial monetary\nrewards. Papachristos [30], for instance, found that gang\nmembers typically make around $50 per day by selling drugs.\nGiven the hazards associated with drug dealing (i.e., the\npossibility of being arrested, robbed, or assaulted), Venkatesh\n[31] suggested that lucrative financial rewards are often not\nrealised by gang-involved youth, and, consequently, pro-\nlonged gang affiliation is unlikely if money was a driving\nforce behind the decision to join a gang. Thus, given the low\nprobability of gang members making substantial amounts of\nmoney, it is unlikely that money sharing will significantly\ninfluence the intention to rejoin a gang after incarceration,\nregardless of the gang's capacity to fulfil the social needs of\nyouths.\nIt is well documented that gang members face the risk\nof violence from within their own gang for breaking rules.\nDecker and Van Winkle [32], for instance, reported that\nrule violators were expected to walk through a line of other\ngang members who took turns beating the transgressor for\nrule transgression. Although the impact of rule-breaking\npunishment has on the intention to rejoin a gang following\nincarceration in unclear, research by Putnam [33] suggested\nthat gang members who violate rules may be less able to\nreturn to familiar communities to take advantage of family\nties and the social capital accumulated. Thus, this potential\nconsequence may increases the relative cost of leaving a gang\nand result in the intention to rejoin a gang following release\ninto the community subsequent to incarceration in prison.\nAn important characteristic of organized groups, such\nas gangs, is meetings. Meetings serve variety of func-\ntions, including enhancing group cohesion, communicating\nresponsibilities, and disseminating information. More fre-\nquent gang contact has been suggested to lead to a decline\nin prosocial networks, resulting in reduced information\nflow, opportunities to fill structural holes, and the ability to\naccumulate prosocial capital (e.g., [19, 34]). Consequently,\nincreased frequency of gang contact might reasonably be\nexpected to be associated with an increased intention to\nrejoin a gang after incarceration.\nJournal of Criminology 3\nThe intention to rejoin a gang following incarceration\nmay also vary according to level of social embeddedness/\nposition within a gang. Horowitz [35], for instance, found\nthat it was more difficult for core members (or those in a\nleadership position) to leave a gang than peripheral members,\na finding consistent with Klein's [36] research in Los Ange-\nles which found that core members were more criminally\nactive and better integrated into, and perhaps dependent\non, the group than peripheral members. In line with this,\nPyrooz and colleagues [19] reported a robust relationship\nbetween \"embeddedness\" and continuity of gang member-\nship. Specifically, individuals weakly embedded in gangs were\nfound to desist at a faster rate than those more deeply\nembedded in gangs. Embeddedness was defined as an indi-\nvidual's \"immersion within an enduring deviant network,\nrestricting involvement in prosocial networks\" (p. 241) and\nincluded items assessing frequency of gang contact, position\nin the gang, importance of gang membership, proportion of\nfriends in the gang, and frequency of gang-involved assaults.\nImportantly, however, Pyrooz and colleagues looked at the\nfactors associated with desistance for both males and females\nsimultaneously.\nAlternatively, rather than core members intending to\nrejoin a gang because of attenuated connections to more\nprosocial networks, core members may be more likely to\nfeel the need to reassert their status within a gang following\nrelease from prison than more peripheral members [37].\nWhatever the case may be, however, the pull back into a\ngang can be seen as amplified for more central members. By\ncontrast, members at the fringe of a gang may find it easier\nto drift in and out of the gang because of less allegiance\nor weaker bonds to the group or other gang members [38].\nGiven this research, it is expected that youth who report that\nthey have more central roles in their gangs (i.e., a leadership\nposition) will be more likely to report intentions to rejoin a\ngang than those reporting regular membership.\nSince membership is structured and gangs typically have\nboth core and peripheral members, level of commitment\nand importance of gang membership may plausibly affect\nreengagement intentions. In general, the more favourable an\nindividual's attitude towards a given behaviour, the stronger\ntheir intention to perform it [39]. Thus, individuals who view\ngang membership as more important should be more likely\nto report greater intentions to rejoin following incarceration.\nResearch by Moffitt [40] has also found that the importance\nof gang affiliation to individuals can lead to the \"knifing-off\"\nof previously held prosocial attachments (i.e., conventional\npeers, school, and parents), which are robust correlates of\ndelinquency.\nThe attenuation of prosocial bonds is also important\nbecause of the effect such ties have on conventional beliefs\n[26]. In light of this, we suggest that importance of gang\nmembership will be inversely related to the likelihood of\ndesistance from gangs (i.e., those individuals who view\ngang membership as particularly important should be the\nindividuals least likely to report not intending to rejoin a gang\nfollowing incarceration).\nOver time, group processes and related functions\nlead gang members to shed their nongang friends and\nacquaintances [32]. Indeed, Thornberry et al. [14] referred\nto gangs as \"social networks that embed their members in\ndeviant routines and isolate them from prosocial arenas\"\n(p.7). Consequently, as a result of a decline in alternative\nsources of support and resources, times spent with a gang\nmight reasonably be expected to be associated with an\nincreased intention to rejoin a gang following a period of\nincarceration and release back into the community.\nResearch on the friends of gang members has found that\ngangs do not typically encourage active members to have\nfriends, particularly close ones, outside of the gang (e.g.,\n[41]). As positive peer relationships (nongang friends, in\nthis case) may be an important component of the identity\ntransformation that may prevent juvenile offenders from\nwanting to return to the lifestyle, which may have included\ngang membership, which resulted in their incarceration [42],\nwe expect that having fewer nongang member friends will\nbe associated with intentions to rejoin a gang after incarcer-\nation. Conversely, and in line with Wood and Alleyne [10],\ndesistance, or the intention to not rejoin a gang, might occur\nwhen prosocial opportunities and institutions are restored\n(i.e., stable nongang relationships) or remained intact during\ngang membership.\n1.4. Moral Disengagement. When individuals encounter sit-\nuations requiring immoral behaviour to obtain benefits, they\nexperience moral conflicts [43]. This may lead them to engage\nin what Bandura [44] described as moral disengagement\nstrategies, which consist of \"cognitive restricting of inhu-\nmane conduct into a benign or worthy behaviour\" [44, p.\n101]. Social cognitive theory [44], much like neutralization\ntheory [45], describes eight strategies that individuals may\nemploy to rationalise and justify their harmful acts against\nothers. \"Moral justification,\" \"euphemistic labelling,\" and\n\"advantageous comparison\" refer to mechanisms that serve to\ncognitively restructure harmful acts so that they appear less\ndamaging. \"Dehumanization,\" \"distortion of consequences,\"\nand the \"attribution of blame\" mechanisms serve to reduce or\neliminate the distress one perceives to be causing a victim.\nThere is some data to suggest that gang members employ\nthese techniques to cope with the negative consequence of\ntheir actions [46, 47]. Alleyne and Wood [9], for instance,\nfound that moral disengagement strategies were more preva-\nlent among gang-involved adolescents than their non-gang-\naffiliated peers. Furthermore, results of Alleyne and Wood's\nstudy indicated that although moral disengagement as a\nwhole did not have a significant main effect, at an individual\nstrategy level, gang members used more euphemisms and\nblamed their victims more than nongang youth.\n1.5. Psychopathy. Research has shown that certain psycho-\npathic traits (e.g., low empathy and poor impulse control)\nmay be important in determining who will join a gang\n(e.g., [48, 49]). Indeed, youth with psychopathic traits have\nbeen found to be five times more likely to join a gang than\nyouth without such traits [50]. Youth with greater levels of\npsychopathy have been noted to be less sensitive to informal\nsocial controls (e.g., parental supervision), which have been\nobserved to contribute (albeit modestly) to gang membership\n4 Journal of Criminology\n[51]. Furthermore, Valdez et al. [49] reported that gang\nmembers have greater Psychopathy Checklist-Screening Ver-\nsion (PCL-SV; [52]) total scores, as well as higher scores\non the Interpersonal-Affective and Antisocial-lifestyle sub-\nscales of the measure. Similarly, another study comparing\nthe criminal attitudes and psychopathic traits of gang- and\nnon-gang-affiliated offenders ( = 168) recruited from\nyouth correctional institutions in Singapore found that gang-\naffiliated youth scored significantly higher on the Impulsive-\nirresponsible subscale of the Youth Psychopathic Trait Inven-\ntory (YPI; [53]) than their non-gang-affiliated counterparts\nin univariate analysis. However, when criminal attitudes (as\nindexed by the Measure of Criminal Attitudes and Associates;\n[54]) and attitudes toward gangs were controlled for, this rela-\ntionship became nonsignificant [48]. Thus, although research\nhas shown that certain psychopathic traits may be important\nin determining who will join a gang, it is unclear whether\nsuch traits may influence gang reengagement intentions.\n1.6. The Present Research. Given the risks associated with\nlengthier gang membership, the current study adds to\nthe literature by focusing on isolating the specific factors\nassociated with juveniles' intentions to rejoin a gang--an\nimportant predictor of continued gang involvement [19],\nto inform intervention efforts in detention facilities. The\npresent study uses cross-sectional data from the Research on\nPathways to Desistance (RPD) project--a large-scale study of\nserious adolescent offenders--to investigate the relationship\nbetween gang characteristics (money sharing, punishment\nfor rule breaking, frequency of contact, position in the\ngang, importance of gang membership, number of nongang\nfriends, and time with gang), number of incarcerated friends,\nand family characteristics, having run away from home and\nparental physical fights, controlling for ethnicity, and gang\nreengagement intentions. The focus of the current research is\nnot on the effects of incarceration, because participants were\ninterviewed within 75 days after their adjudication (for those\nin the juvenile system) or 90 days after their decertification\nhearing, but instead on previously mentioned predictors of\ngang reengagement after incarceration.\n2.1. Sample. As described in more detail elsewhere (e.g., [55]),\nparticipants were serious adolescent offenders from Philadel-\nphia, Pennsylvania, and Phoenix who were interviewed as\npart of the Pathways to Desistance Study. Participants were\nincluded in the study if they (a) had been adjudicated guilty\nof a serious felony (excluding less serious property crimes),\nmisdemeanour weapons, or misdemeanour sexual assault\noffense in juvenile or adult courts in Philadelphia or Phoenix\nand (b) were between the ages of 14 and 17 at the time\nof their offence. A total of 3,807 youths met the inclusion\ncriteria, 1,799 of whom were excluded because of operational\nor design constraints. Of the youths that were located and\ncontactable, 80% agreed to take part in the study (N =\n1,355). Participants were administered a baseline interview\nover 2 days in two, 2 h sessions within 75 days after their\nadjudication (for those in the juvenile system) or 90 days\nafter their decertification hearing in Philadelphia or an adult\narraignment in Phoenix (if in the adult system). Interviewers\nand participants sat side by side facing a computer, and\nquestions were read aloud to avoid any potential difficulties\narising from reading difficulties. Participants could answer\nthe questions aloud or, to maximize their privacy, enter their\nresponses on a keypad (although in some facilities, this option\nwas not available). Of 1,335 participants included in the study,\nwe selected only those reporting having been part of a gang\nbefore incarceration. Furthermore, due to very small number,\nwe excluded females ( = 28) from the analysis, which\nresulted in a sample of 206 male gang members.\n2.2.1. Gang Membership Characteristics. A series of questions\nadapted from studies by Thornberry et al. [56] and Elliot\n[57] were used to assess characteristics of gang membership.\nConsistent with a long line of gang research, self-nomination\nwas used to operationalize gang membership (i.e., partic-\nipants were asked if they were \"ever in a gang\"). If gang\ninvolvement was endorsed, additional items were asked to\nexplore individual's subjective experience of the gang and\ngang cohesiveness. For this study, we focused on the following\nitems: \"does your gang/posse share money?\" (yes/no); \"does\nyour gang/posse have punishments for breaking the rules?\"\n(yes/no); \"in the past six months, before you came into the\nsystem on this charge, how often did you have contact with\nthe gang/posse?\" (less than monthly, once per month, less\nthan weekly but more than monthly, once per week, twice per\nweek, 3\u00ad6 times per week, and daily); \"what is/was your posi-\ntion in the gang/posse?\" (leader/member); \"how important is\nthe gang/posse to you?\" (1 = not at all to 5 = extremely); \"how\nmany of your friends are not members of the gang/posse?\"\n(none, a few are not members, half are not members, most\nare not members, and all). The item \"do you expect to be a\nmember when back on the street?\" (yes/no) was used to assess\nthe intention to rejoin a gang following incarceration.\n2.2.2. Number of Incarcerated Friends. Participants were\nasked to report the number of friends that they had who have\nbeen in prison (count variable).\n2.2.3. Run Away from Home. Participants were asked to\nrespond to a single item which asked, \"Have you ever run\naway from where you were living?\" (yes/no).\n2.2.4. Characteristics of Family. Family characteristics were\nassessed using two binary coded (yes/no) items which asked\n\"has anyone in your family been in jail or prison?\" and \"did\nyour parents have physical fights?\"\n2.2.5. Psychopathy. The Psychopathy Checklist-Youth Ver-\nsion (PCL-YV; [58]) was used to assess youths' psychopathic\ntraits. This 20-item rating scale is based on two sources: (1)\nan interview with the youth and (2) charts and collateral\ninformation. The original semistructured interview guide\nwas adapted for use in this study and reviewed with the\nJournal of Criminology 5\nTable 1: Descriptive statistics for age, number of incarcerated\nfriends, gang characteristics, moral disengagement, and the two\npsychopathy factors.\nVariable Minimum Maximum M SD\nNumber of\nincarcerated friends\nFrequency of contact\nwith gang members\nImportance of gang\nmembership\nNumber of friends\n(nongang members)\nAge of initiation to\ngang\nFrequency of contact with gang members was categorised as 1 = less than\nmonthly, 2 = once per month, 3 = less than weekly but more than monthly, 4\n= once per week, 5 = twice per week, 6 = 3\u00ad6 times per week, and 7 = daily.\nImportance of gang membership was rated as 1 = not at all to 5 = extremely.\ninterview's developer. Following the interview and a review\nof records/collateral information, the interviewer used\na 3-point ordinal scale to indicate how well each of the\n20 items applied to the youth (0 = does not apply, 1 =\napplies to a certain extent, and 2 = applies). A two-factor\nsolution (Factor 1: Interpersonal-Affective and Factor 2:\nAntisocial-lifestyle) to the PCL-SV was adopted in the\npresent research, although 3- and 4-factor solutions have\nbeen found to provide better model fit (see [59]) due to these\nresearchers being unable to access all PCL-SV item scores (see\nhttp://www.pathwaysstudy.pitt.edu/codebook/pcl-sb.html).\nInternal consistency of Factor 1 ( = .76) and Factor 2 ( =\n2.2.6. Moral Disengagement. The Mechanisms of Moral Dis-\nengagement [60] was used for this study to measure ado-\nlescent's attitudes concerning the treatment of others. The\nself-report measure contains 32 items to which participants\nrespond on a 3-point Likert scale (1 = Disagree to 3 = Agree),\nwith higher scores indicating a greater moral detachment.\nMean item total scores were used as an overall scale measure\nof moral disengagement ( = .88).\n2.2.7. Demographics. We control race/ethnicity (dummy\ncoded as Hispanic or Non-Hispanic) and gender. To control\nfor gender, we excluded females from the analysis, since they\nexhibited much lower levels of gang activity.\n3. Results\n3.1. Descriptive Statistics. Descriptive statistics for all con-\ntinuous variables are presented in Table 1, while descriptive\nstatistics for all categorical variables are presented in Table 2.\nThe mean age of participants at the time of adjudication was\nTable 2: Frequencies of endorsement for all categorical variables.\nVariable Frequency %\nEthnicity\nHave you ever run away from where you\nwere living?\nDid your parents have physical fights?\nDoes gang share money?\nDoes gang have punishment if rules are\nbroken?\nPosition in gang\nIntention to rejoin the gang after\nincarceration\nleaders/top men in a gang, more than half (53.4%) reported\nthe intention to rejoin a gang following incarceration.\n3.2. Binary Logistic Regression. Direct binary logistic regres-\nsion was used to assess the impact of ethnicity, having run\naway from home, parental fighting, number of incarcerated\nfriends, gang characteristics (money sharing, punishment for\nrule violation, frequency of contact, position, importance\nof gang membership, time spent with gang members, and\nnumber of nongang friends), moral disengagement, and\nthe two psychopathy factors on the likelihood of reporting\nintentions to rejoin a gang following incarceration. Prelimi-\nnary analyses were conducted to ensure no violation of the\nassumption of multicollinearity (see Table 3). Little's MCAR\ntest (1998) indicated that data was not missing completely at\nmissing values were problematic and regression analysis was\nconducted without imputation being made (missing cases\nwere removed from final analysis).\nA test of the full model containing all predictor variables\nagainst a constant-only model was statistically significant\n6 Journal of Criminology\nTable 3: Correlations between all independent variables.\n(1) Ethnicity --\n(2) Have you ever run away from where you\nwere living?\n(3) Did your parents have physical fights? -.03 .24 --\n(6) Does gang have punishment if rules are\nbroken?\nTable 4: Logistic regression model of the predictors of gang reengagement intentions.\nVariable  SE OR (95% CI)\nNote.

The Cox and Snell R2 value was .35 and\nNagelkerke R2 was .47. The model displayed satisfactory\npositive predictive value correctly classifying 80.1% of cases.\nAs shown in Table 4, only three of the variables made\na unique statistically significant contribution to the model\n(punishment if gang rules are broken, importance of gang\nmembership, and moral disengagement). The strongest pre-\ndictor to belonging to the gang reengagement intention group\nwas importance of gang membership (OR = 2.55,  <\n.001). This result indicates that for every unit increase in\nimportance of gang membership, an individual was 2.55 times\nmore likely to express the intention to rejoin a gang group,\nwhile controlling for all other factors in the model. Moral\ndisengagement was also positively related to reengagement\nintentions (OR = 1.11,  < .05), while number of nongang\nfriends was negatively related to reengagement intentions\n(OR =.67,  < .05), while controlling for all other factors in\nthe model. This suggests that for every unit increase in moral\ndisengagement, an individual was 1.11 times more likely to\nendorse the intention to rejoin a gang group, while for every\nunit increase in nongang friends, individuals were less likely\nto rejoin the gang.\n4. Discussion\nAlthough research has established that intentions are the\nmost immediate and important determinants of behaviour\naction (e.g., [4, 5]), and work by Pyrooz et al. [19] established\nJournal of Criminology 7\nthe relevance of behavioural intentions for continued gang\ninvolvement, the correlates of this important indicator have\nnot been previously examined. The aim of this research,\ntherefore, was to specify and test a model to explain why\nyoung offenders intend to reengage with gangs to which\nthey previously belonged. The model explained between 35%\nand 47% of variance in gang reengagement intentions and\nsuccessfully distinguished rejoiners from those not signalling\nan intention to rejoin.\nAlthough the model overall explained a sizeable about of\nvariance of gang reengagement intentions, only punishment\nif gang rules are broken, importance of gang membership, and\nmoral disengagement made unique statistically significant\ncontributions to the model. The significant influence of fear\nof retribution for gang rule infringements on intentions\nto remain a gang member supports the hypothesis that it\nmay be perceived by gang members to be safer and less\ncostly to rejoin rather than to leave [33]. It is not clear,\nhowever, if respondents expressing this view had knowingly\nbroken the rules or were concerned that if they refrain from\nrejoining the gang on release, this would feed the suspicion\nthat information about the gang had been disclosed to the\nauthorities whilst in custody putting them at even greater risk.\nNeither psychopathy factor significantly influenced the\nintention to rejoin the gang postincarceration. Consequently,\ndespite research suggesting that youths with psychopathic\ntraits are five times more likely to join a gang than those\nwithout [50], results of the present research indicate that\npsychopathy is neither a risk factor for reengagement nor an\ninfluence on the intention to sever links. This suggests that\nprioritising working with young offenders displaying psy-\nchopathic traits would be an ineffective means of attempting\nto prevent reengagement with gangs following incarceration.\nThis is a useful finding, particularly if it is replicated in other\nstudies, in that it potentially spares criminal justice and social\nwork practitioners from concentrating their efforts and scarce\nresources on psychopathic young offenders who are at no\ngreater or lesser risk of resuming gang membership, following\nrelease from prison, than any other gang member.\nBy contrast, the number of friends of young offenders\nhad, who were not involved with gangs, was, as hypothesised,\na significant factor in the extent to which offenders were likely\nto reengage with gangs following incarceration. The lack of\n\"normal\" friends meant a greater likelihood of rejoining a\ngang. This suggests that the exposure of young offenders\nto lifestyles and behaviours other than those associated\nwith the close-knit culture and daily experience of gang\nmembership reduced their need to rejoin gangs following\nrelease from prison. It is interesting to speculate on how this\neffect arises. One explanation might be that commitment\nto a gang is somewhat weaker among young offenders with\nnon-gang-involved friends and that this is later reflected\nin a diminished desire to rejoin postincarceration. Youth\ndiversion programmes that steer youth away from gangs and\nboost their exposure to a wider range of lifestyles and role\nmodels may have some success, even among gang members,\nin severing their links with gangs after release [9]. This\nbegs a question about the presence of nongang members\nand prosocial role models among peer groups within the\ncommunities in which the young offenders live. It may be\nmore difficult to avoid recruitment by gangs or escape their\ninfluence in highly criminogenic ethnically segregated poorer\nneighbourhoods [61]. Within the prison environment, the\nimplication of this finding suggests that there might be some\nmerit in ensuring that gang-involved young offenders are not\nplaced in the same cells.\nThe positive relationship between moral disengagement\nand reintegration suggests that this cognitive mechanism\nis a particularly effective \"moral shield\" for gang-involved\nyoung offenders, whether on the streets, during imprison-\nment, or following release. This relationship is also entirely\nconsistent with the negative association between the number\nof non-gang-involved friends and the decision to rejoin.\nThe moral disengagement of young offenders from society,\nat large, is likely to be preserved within a close-knit gang\ncommunity, isolated from prosocial influences and governed\nby strict rules, but challenged and potentially weakened,\nwhen exposed to the cultural norms, values, and behaviour\nof nongang members.\nEven though risk factors for rejoining a gang may be\nidentifiable, knowing how and when to intervene to neu-\ntralise or reverse them is a considerable challenge. The\ntimeline for intervention is potentially lengthy, involving\naction preincarceration, during imprisonment and following\nrelease. Ideally, the most desirable outcome would be to\nprevent gang formation and recruitment at the outset but\nthere may be options to intervene during a period of incar-\nceration to reduce the likelihood of reintegration after release.\nIdentifying which factors influence young offenders to rejoin\ngangs, as this paper has demonstrated, does not automatically\nlead to the implementation of appropriate interventions and\ncountermeasures. The success of interventions in reducing\nrecidivism generally is mixed and the evidence base of \"what\nworks\" is sparse, although there is evidence that incarcerating\ngang members, curriculum-based prevention programmes,\nand using adult prison visits to scare minor juvenile offenders\ndo not reduce the chances of reoffending and in some cases\ncan be harmful [62, 63]. However, the findings from this\npaper do provide some clues about the general direction\npreventive approaches might take.\nThe most significant finding is the discovery that psy-\nchopathy among young offenders has no influence on their\nintention to reengage with gangs, once they have left prison.\nThis is important because it suggests that psychopathy would\nnot be an obstacle to steering young offenders away from\nreengagement with gangs. Unlike psychopathy, other drivers\nof reengagement may be more amenable to attenuation\nthrough targeted projects and interventions.\nThe intention to reengage with gangs, and indeed their\nperceived importance, indicates that they fulfil a need in\nyoung people for belonging and identity. But their attraction\nalso signals that there is a lack of alternatives to gang\nmembership and opportunities for young people, which\nbecome particularly marked at the point of release. It is at\nthis stage, that they need help with resettlement, health, and\nhousing needs, support with skills and training, access to\nemployment opportunities, and other forms of assistance\nthat provide attractive alternatives to gang membership. A\n8 Journal of Criminology\nrecent systematic review of \"focused deterrent strategies\"\ntargeting gangs and criminally active groups suggests that\noffering gang members job training, employment, substance\nabuse treatment, housing assistance, and a variety of other\nservices and opportunities produces large statistically sig-\nnificant reductions in violent crime [64]. Other approaches,\nusing a varied menu of law enforcement sanctions to curtail\nviolent behaviour (so-called \"pulling levers\") and incentives\nfocusing social services and community resources to targeted\noffenders have shown promising results [65].\nThe findings from this study also indicate a need to\nchallenge young offenders' perceptions about the importance\nof gang membership, particularly its disadvantages and the\ncosts of membership for familial relationships and quality\nof life. The impact of having non-gang- involved friends on\nthe intention not to rejoin gangs also suggests that there may\nbe merit in demonstrating to young offenders that there are\nalternative, more rewarding lifestyles to gang culture and that\nit is possible to exit from gangs without coming to harm.\nThe findings also suggest that promoting young offenders'\nmoral reengagement would have a significant effect on the\nlikelihood that young offenders will not rejoin gangs on\nrelease. The objectives are clear but the means by which they\nmight be realised is another matter entirely.\nNotwithstanding these suggestions, it is necessary to\nhighlight some caveats surrounding the broader applicability\nof this research to policy. Firstly, additional studies are\nrequired to corroborate the findings (the sample was drawn\nfrom a limited young offender population that was primarily\nHispanic). Secondly, it would be advantageous to undertake\nan analysis with a larger array of measures to create a\nmore extensive evidence base on risk and protective factors\ninfluencing gang reintegration. Thirdly, as gang members\nwere incarcerated for no more than 90 days, further studies\nexamining gang members' responses to the intention ques-\ntion are advisable because participants' responses may change\nsignificantly after \"fully\" experiencing incarceration. Finally,\nas the question on the intention to resume gang membership\nwas dichotomous, future research might usefully explore\nconditions attached to rejoining in order to test the determi-\nnation, by the offender, to become a gang member once again.\nConflict of Interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interests\nregarding the publication of this paper.\nReferences\n[1] D.
