Here, the remittance receipt is defined as the money, goods\nor gifts received by a household from domestic migrants working\noutside of Chitwan in Nepal or abroad.\nPrevious migration research in Nepal primarily focused on the\ncauses of out-migration, in general (Bhandari, 2004, Bhandari &\n(2015) provide a detailed description of the process and the role of\nrecruitment agencies on Nepali migration. Gurung (2012) examined\nthe role social exclusion plays on destination specific out-migration\nof individuals in Nepal. A few studies provided valuable descriptive\ninformation on migrants and remittances (Adhikari, 2001; Central\nOf particular interest to this study, Thieme and Wyss (2005) explored\nmigration patterns and remittances transfer using data from a rural\nsetting of western Nepal. Specifically, they revealed that there are\nspecific ways of organizing migration for various destinations. These\ncountry specific ways of organizing migration demand specific\nassets from prospective migrants and their household members\nand, therefore, influence their choice of destination. In addition,\nThieme and Wyss (2005) also provide information on organization\nof destination specific migration by Nepali migrants and the\nprocess of transfer of remittances back home. Williams et al. (2012)\nprovide insights into the lives, work, values, beliefs, behaviors and\nintentions of Nepali migrants living in the Gulf Cooperation Council\n(GCC) countries. Particular to remittances, Williams et al. (2012)\nexamine the factors contributing to the remittances transferred by\nmigrants to their residence in Nepal. In addition, Seddon, Gurung\ndata provide descriptive insights on destination specific migration\nand the remittances sent by migrants to Nepal. Although Williams\nremittances varied by migrant's destination, these studies do not\nprovide information on remittances received by households. It is\nbelieved that the amount of remittances sent by migrants and the\namount received by a household may vary. Because migrants may\nsend remittances to different people living in multiple places e.g.\nparents, in-laws, spouse, children and others, the amount reported\nby a migrant and a household thus could vary. Bhandari and\nChaudhary (2015) explored remittance receipt and remittance use\nand examined the uses of remittances in various socio-economic and\ncultural dimensions of household activities in a western Chitwan\nvalley of Nepal. While these studies make important contributions\nto the field of migration and remittance research, yet, studies those\nexamine destination specific remittances received by households is\nan important research gap in Nepal.\nThisstudyaimstofulfiltheimportantgapinmigrationandremittance\nliterature by investigating two important research questions:Whether\nor not a household's receipt of remittances does vary by migrant's\ndestination? If it does vary, does the extent to which the amount of\nremittances is received vary by destinations? This study affords to\nanswer the questions by using the remittance receipt data collected\nin 2013 from the western Chitwan Valley - a remittance dependent\nsetting of rural Nepal. This exploratory study collected information\non migrant destinations, the amount of remittances received from\neach migrant and migrants' characteristics.\nMigration and Remittances in Nepal\nNepal has a long history of migration. Nepal was once the melting\npot of Indo-Aryan ancestry origin migrants from the South and\nMongolian origin Tibeto-Burmese from the North. The country\nexperienced a rapid growth in internal migration during 1950s when\nthe Nepali government opened the Tarai region (southern plain) for\nsettlement by clearing the dense forest. This Gangetic plain also\ntermed as `the granary of the country' is highly fertile and suitable\nfor agriculture. Since then the internal migration tremendously\n4| Prem Bhandari\nincreased especially from the hills and mountains (Gurung, 1998).\nNow, the country has turned into one of the major migrant sending\nareas.\nIn Nepal, international labor migration formally began in 1815\nAD with the recruitment of Nepali youth in The British Brigade of\nGurkha--units of the British Army that were composed of Nepalese\nthe Nepali government promulgated the Foreign Employment Act to\ndestinations other than India. This Act licensed non-governmental\ninstitutions to export Nepali workers abroad and legitimized certain\nlabor contracting organizations. This exploded large streams of\ninternational migration outside of India (Kollmair et al., 2006;\nRecent estimates suggest that there may be as many as three million\nNepalis, or about 10 percent of the total population, working abroad\npercentage of migrants is much higher for young people and for men.\nof Nepal (excluding India) (Seddon, Adhikari, & Gurung, 2002).\nThe 2011 population census reported about 2 million individuals\nas migrants (Central Bureau of Statistics, 2012). More recently,\nmigration has been a rite of passage and a matter of social status and\nmove outside of the country everyday (Kern & Muller-Boker, 2015;\nPattison, 2014). Undocumented migration is also very high and it\nis difficult to estimate precisely the number of Nepalis who have\nmigrated outside the country.\nWith the increased volume of out-migration, the volume of\nremittances is also increasing over time in Nepal. Estimates show\nthat the remittances from out-migration accounted for about 29\npercent of GDP (World Bank, 2016). This account does not capture\nthe remittances received through informal channels. Now, Nepal\nstands as the third largest remittance recipient in its contribution to\nGDP in the world, whose position was sixth in 2011 (World Bank,\nRemittances have become an important source of household income\nremittances (Central Bureau of Statistics, 2011). On average, the\nincome transfer in the form of remittances is Rs 80,436 (in nominal\nterms) per year per recipient household. The most recent Household\nBudget Survey revealed that in 2014/15 remittance was the third\n(17.61%) most important source of a household's monthly income\nafter salary, wages, allowance and pension (30.26%) and business\nthe second most important source of household income.\nMigrant Destinations and Destination Specific Earning\nPotentials\nNepali migrants are distributed worldwide. In 1997, excluding India,\nthey were reported in 25 countries (Seddon, Adhikari & Gurung,\nUntil 1990s, India was the most popular international destination for\nNepali workers. Migration to India still dominates due to its open\nborder, socio-cultural and linguistic similarities, and past migration\nexperiences. The 2009 Nepal Migration Survey estimates that\nof the total 2.1 million Nepali work migrants, 41 percent were in\nIndia, 38 percent in the Middle Eastern Gulf countries, 12 percent\nin Malaysia and 8.7 percent in other developed countries (World\nBank, 2011). However, more recently, countries in the Middle East,\nSouth East Asia, the West (Northern Europe and North America)\nand Australia have been the popular destinations. In 2009, excluding\nIndia, Malaysia, Saudi Arab, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates\naccounted for nearly 85 percent of international migrants (Ozaki,\n2012). About 75 percent Nepali international migrants are unskilled\nand are employed mainly in entry-level jobs such as cleaning and\nconstruction (Kern & Muller-Boker, 2015).\nEarning potentials of migrants vary by destinations. Destination\nsuch as India is easily accessible to migrants compared to other\ninternational destinations, but earning potentials in India are\n6| Prem Bhandari\nrelatively less. Seddon, Gurung & Adhikari (1998) reported that\nmigration to the Middle Eastern countries have relatively better\nearnings compared to India but less earnings compared to other\ndestinations such asAmerica,Australia, the United Kingdom, Japan,\nMalaysia, South Korea, and Thailand. Thus countries of Europe and\nNorth America, and East and South East Asia are generally desired\nby Nepali migrants for higher wages, better working conditions and\npossibilities for accumulation. Japan is the most favored destination\nfor Nepalis with high wages and large savings for a successful\nrevealed that even the lowest level of monthly remittances from the\nWest, and from the Far East and South East Asia are significantly\nhigher than the average sent back from the Gulf or India (Seddon et\nand Williams et al. (2012) reported that there is variation in the\namount of remittances sent by a migrant. Despite these, whether the\nreceipt of remittances or the extent to which the amount received by\na household does vary by migration destinations adjusting for other\nfactors is not clear.\nHypothesis on Destination Specific Remittances Received by\nHouseholds\nGiven the background above, this study investigates the remittance\nreceipt by migrant households using the New Economics of Labor\nMigration (NELM) framework. According to NELM, migration of\nindividuals is a family-based decision and is an attempt to diversify\nhousehold income portfolios to protect against risk and gain access\nto capital in order to finance consumer and productive purchases\nthe decision to migrate by household members is a family strategy to\nminimize risks/uncertainties. By making such decision, a household\nmakes an investment on migration. In return, the household expects\n1. There are three arguments to explain whether a migrant will remit or not:\naltruism, self-interest, and insurance and risk sharing (Agarwal & Horowitz,\nIt is assumed that migrants are concerned about their family members\nback home. Thus, they send remittances for the well-being of households\nmembers who are left behind (altruism motive) (ZaiLiang & Ma, 2013).\nIt can be expected that a household will send members to destinations\nwith high earning potentials with the expectation of receiving higher\nreturns, here, remittances. However, the destinations with higher\nearning potentials are most likely hardest to be reached (Seddon et\nal., 1998). But when the migrants are successful to get there and get\na job, the earning potentials are higher. It is known that migrant's\nearning is one of the important determinants of whether one remits or\nnot and the amount of remittances sent (Arun & Ulku, 2011). As the\nearning potentials of migration vary by destinations, it is expected\nthat the remittances received by a household from migrants will also\nvary by migrants' destinations. Thus, it is hypothesized that:\nNet of other factors, households with migrants in destinations\nwith high earning potentials (e.g. East and South East Asia, North\nAmerica, Europe and Australia or in the Middle East) will be\nmore likely to report that they received remittances from migrants\ncompared to those who are in destinations with low earning\npotentials (such as Nepal or India); and\nNet of other factors, households with migrants in destinations\nwith high earning potentials (e.g. East and South East Asia, North\nAmerica, Europe and Australia or in the Middle East) will report\nthe higher amount of remittances received from migrants than those\nwho are in countries with low earning potentials.\nMethodology\nThe setting\nThis study was conducted in the western Chitwan Valley of Nepal.\nBefore the 1950s, the valley was primarily covered with dense\nforests and was infamous for malarial infestation. In 1956, His\nNext, migrants may have interest to maintain family tie with the intention\nof returning back home. This intention will motivate them to remit. The\nthird one is the insurance and risk sharing also termed as the contractual\nagreement. According to Arun & Ulku (2011), this is basically a mutual\nagreement between the migrant and his/her family members that they will\nhelp each other in difficult times (risk sharing). Or, the agreement could be\nto pay back the cost of migration or education incurred by migrant's family.\nThese motives may overlap. This study, however, does not intend to test\nthese arguments.\n8| Prem Bhandari\nMajesty's Government of Nepal in collaboration with the United\nStates Government's International Cooperation Assistance program,\nimplemented a malaria eradication campaign and distributed land\nparcels to people coming from adjoining districts of the country.\nThe flat terrain with its highly fertile soil and warm climate offered\npromising opportunities for people who were struggling with the\nsteep hill and mountain slopes.\nChitwan, once known as a \"death valley\" soon became a melting\npot, receiving people from all over the country (Shrestha, 1990;\nShivakoti et al., 1997). Recently, Chitwan has experienced dramatic\nchanges in population mobility, transitioning from a frontier\ndestination for in-migrants from surrounding hill districts of Nepal\nto one of the country's major migrant-sending districts (Bhandari,\nmany as 29% (27% for Nepal) of the households reported that at\nleast one member was absent from household. About 9% (Nepal =\n7%) population were reported to be absent of which 16% (Nepal=\n13%) were males and 2% (Nepal=2%) were females. This absentee\npopulation includes both internal and international migrants.\nFarming remains the primary source of livelihood in the Chitwan\nValley. The valley is inhabited mostly by in-migrants, especially\nfrom pahad, i.e., the hill and mountains and other adjacent Tarai\ndistricts including India. Chitwan's central location and relatively\nwell-developed transportation network have been the catalytic\nforces for turning it into a hub for business and tourism. This has\nresulted in a rapid proliferation of government services, businesses,\nand wage labor opportunities in the district (Shivakoti et al., 1999).\nData\nThe data were collected in 2013 from migrant sending\nhouseholds. Migrant sending households come from 30 randomly\nselected geographic clusters also called the neighborhoods. The\nneighborhoods are the lowest level sampling units chosen. To select\nneighborhoods, first, the study area of western Chitwan Valley was\ndivided into three different strata based on the approximate distance\nfrom Narayanghat, the urban center of the Chitwan District, to select\na representative sample of neighborhoods. Stratum 1 included areas\nnearest to Narayanghat, stratum 3 included areas farthest from it\nand stratum 2 included areas in between. The samples were selected\nat two stages. In the first stage, in each stratum 10 settlements\nwere randomly sampled based on probability proportionate to size,\nthus making a total of 30 settlements. These settlements were then\ndivided into non-overlapping clusters called neighborhood or tol\nthat consisted of 5-15 households. For the purpose of this study, 10\nneighborhoods each from three strata were selected thus making a\ntotal of 30 communities2. The detailed discussion of the design and\nselection procedure of the neighborhoods is described in Barber et\nAltogether 394 households were enumerated in 30 neighborhood\nclusters. Of them, 187 (47 percent) households had at least one\nmember (age 12 years and above) away from home for most of the\ntime in the past six months. These are the working age individuals\nwho could earn money and send remittances back home. Proportion\nof migrant households is consistent with the results of the Nepal\nhouseholds in Nepal that reported at least one absentee living\ncurrently within or outside the country.\nA face-to-face interview was conducted to 185 eligible households\nwith a 99 percent response rate. Any household that has at least one\nmember away from home most of the time in the past six months\nwas considered eligible for the survey. Six months' time was\nconsidered to allow a migrant to earn money and send remittances\nback home. Any individual 18 years of age and over who could\nprovide information about the household, remittances and remittance\nuse was interviewed. Multiple informants from a household were\nallowed to respond the household survey. Study strictly followed the\nstandard practice of ethical codes, interviewing and data collection3.\nConsent was read to the informants and permission was obtained\n2. These neighborhoods are outside of the 151 Chitwan Valley Family Study\n(CVFS) neighborhoods (see Barber et al, 1997 for CVFS information).\n3. Ethical consideration: Ethical approval was sought from the Institutional\nReview Board (IRB) of the University of Michigan prior to implementation\nof the survey. In addition, the author is certified with the human subjects\nprotection \"Program for Education and Evaluation in Responsible Research\nand Scholarship\" at the University of Michigan.\nprior to the survey.\nThe field work collected information on migration and remittances.\nFor each migrant, place (country) of migrant's destination by month\n(for 12 months), occupation, whether the household received any\nremittances (money, goods or gifts) from the migrant during the\nstudy-year, and, if received, the amount of money or the value of\ngoods or gifts received by the household from each person each\nmonth in the past 12 months. This information was recorded for\neach migrant for each month. In addition, information about each\nmigrant's demographic characteristics such as age, gender, current\nplace of residence, marital status, migration experience, and\neducation were collected. For this study, out-migration is defined as\nany departure from the neighborhood lasting at least three months\nor more (most of the time in the past six months) for any reason. It\nincludes movement within or outside of Nepal. Other information\ncollected was household size and caste/ethnicity.\nMeasures\nThere are two outcome measures. This study utilized data from\nmigrants who were currently working at the destination as reported\nby the household informant.\nOutcome 1. Receipt of remittances. The first outcome measure is\nwhether a household received remittances or not from a migrant\nwho is working outside of Chitwan in Nepal or abroad. Information\nwas collected by asking, \"In the past 12 months, did you or your\nhousehold receive money, goods or gifts from.....?' The response\nwas recorded `1', if the household received remittance in any month\nin the past 12 months and otherwise `0.'\nOutcome 2. Amount of remittances received. The second outcome\nmeasure is the amount of remittances received by a household from\neach migrant. The information was collected by asking, \"Altogether,\nhow much money did you or your household receive in the past 12\nmonths, including the value of any goods or gifts? Please also tell\nme when did you receive?\" The amount (in Nepali Rupees) was\nrecorded in the month when the household received the remittance.\nThe amount was summed up for the year to calculate the total\namount of remittance received by the household in a year. Then,\nthe amount was divided by total number of months the migrant was\naway from home in the year to calculate migrant's months-adjusted\nremittance4. The amount of migrant's months-adjusted monthly\nremittance (natural log)5 was used as the outcome measure.\nExplanatory measure and controls: Migrant's destination was used\nas the primary explanatory measure to examine whether remittance\nreceipt varied by destination. Migration destinations are grouped as:\n(a) outside Chitwan in Nepal, (b) India, (c) Middle East, (d) Other\nAsia, and (e) America, Australia and Europe. These groupings are\nas used by Seddon et al. (1998). Those who migrated to Nepal are\nconsidered as the reference category. Individual level controls are\nand above), education (5 years or below, 6-11 years and 12 years and\nabove), marital status (currently married vs. others), and migration\nexperience (number of years). Household level controls used are the\nnumber of migrant's from the same household, household size and\ncaste/ethnicity (grouped as Brahmin/Chhetri, Dalit, Hill Janajati,\nNewar and Tarai Janajati).\nAnalytical strategy\nFirst, descriptive statistics of each measure used in the analysis are\nprovided. Next, multivariate models were estimated to examine\nthe influence destination may have on remittance received by\na household. Because migrant households were clustered in\nneighborhoods multilevel modeling (hierarchical linear modeling)\ntechniques was used to estimate the models.\nThe first outcome measure, whether a household received any\nremittances or not from each working migrant is measured as a\ndichotomy: coded \"1\" if a household received remittances from\nthe migrant and \"0\" otherwise. As migrants are clustered within\n4. Some migrants were away from home for the whole year and others\nwere away only for a couple of months. Therefore, the migrant's-months\nadjusted amount of remittances received by a household per month was\ncalculated.\n5. The actual amount of remittances was transformed to natural log to\nnormalize the data.\nneighborhoods, multilevel logistic regression models are estimated\nusing SAS GLIMMIX procedure. This strategy takes into account of\nclusteringofindividuals,hereindividualmigrants,byneighborhoods.\nResults are provided as odds ratios, which are anti-logs of the raw\nlogit coefficients. These odds ratios can be interpreted as: if the\ncoefficient is greater than 1, the effect is positive and every unit\nincrease in the independent variable increases the odds of receiving\nremittances by the household. Conversely, if the coefficient is less\nthan 1, then every unit increase in the independent variable decreases\nthe odds of receiving remittances by the household.\nThe second outcome measure, the amount of remittances (logged)\nreceived by a household from each migrant per month is a ratio\nmeasure. Thus, a multilevel OLS regression technique was used to\nestimate the models.\nFindings\nRemittance received by migrant households\nreported that the household received remittances from migrants in\nthe past 12 months (Table 1). At the national level, this figure was\nof the total) migrants remitted. Out of the total remittance recipient\nhouseholds, 93 percent households received remittances from one\nmigrant and the remaining households received it from 3 or more\nmigrants.\nTable 1: Number of migrants and remittance sending individuals by\nhousehold in western Chitwan, Nepal, 2013.\nNo. of migrants Households with migrant Households received\nremittances from migrants\nNumber % Number %\nOn average, a household with any migrant received NRs 150,562\n(median) per year (or NRs 8,333 per month).

Even from such a small\nsample of households, migrants were distributed in 20 different\ncountries outside Nepal (Table 3). Saudi Arab was the most popular\ninternational destination (12.4%) followed by India (11.7% cent),\nTable 3: Destinations of migrants from the western Chitwan,\nDestination Countries/Regions N Percent\nCharacteristics of working migrants\nNow, turn to research question: does remittance received by a\nhousehold vary by migrant destination? To answer, only those\nmigrants who were working at the destination irrespective of whether\nthe household received remittances or not from them (n=195; 69%\nof total migrants) were included in the analysis.\nDescriptive statistics of the measures are provided in Table 4.\nHousehold informant(s) reported that they received remittances\nfrom 74.4 percent of the migrants who were working in various\ndestinations. Altogether, significantly large proportions (45%) of\nthe currently working migrants were located in the Middle East,\nAmerica, Australia and Europe (10%). About 13 percent of these\nmigrants were females, nearly one-half (46%) of them were between\nthe ages of 25-34 years and four-fifths of them were currently\nmarried. Slightly over one-half of the migrants had 6-11 years of\neducation, and a migrant's average length of time at the destination\nwas slightly over 4 years.\nA migrant household had, on average, about 2 migrants who were\nworking at the destination. The size of the household was about 6.\nAbout one-half of the migrants belonged to Brahmin/Chhetri, 16\npercent each of Dalit and Hill Janajati, 13 percent Tarai Janajati and\nabout 8 percent were Newar. Table 4 also presents the distribution of\nremitters and non-remitters.\nTable 4: Characteristics of working migrants (remitters and non-remitters) of western Chitwan, Nepal, 2013.\nMeasures Definition Total\nRemitters\nNon-remitters\n%/Mean SD %/Mean SD %/Mean SD\nOutcome\nRemittance received from 1 if received, 0 otherwise 74.4\nTotal remittance received Migrant-months\nadjusted amount (NRs)\nExplanatory measure\nMigrant's current destination\nNepal\nMiddle East\nIndia\nAmerica, Australia and Europe\nOther Asia\n1 if within Nepal; 0 otherwise\n1 if Middle East; 0 otherwise\n1 if India; 0 otherwise\n1 if America plus; 0 otherwise\n1 if Other Asia; 0 otherwise\nControls: Individual characteristics\nGender\nAge categories\nMarital status\nEducation categories\n5 years or below\n1 married; 0 otherwise\n1 if 5 years or below; 0 otherwise\nMigration experience\nNumber of years outside Chitwan\nHousehold characteristics\nMigrants in the household\nHousehold size\nCaste/ethnicity\nBrahmin/Chhetri\nDalit\nHill Janajati\nNewar\nTarai Janajati\nNumber of migrant individuals\nNo. of individuals in the house\n1 if yes, 0 otherwise\n1 if yes, 0 otherwise\n1 if yes, 0 otherwise\n1 if yes, 0 otherwise\n1 if yes, 0 otherwise\nRemittance received by households from working migrants\nTable 5 shows that there is a variation in proportion of household\nreport of remittances received by migrant's destination.

Results in\nmodel 1 are the fixed effects of level-1 predictors, migrant's current\nplace of destinations (these results are similar to those in Table 5,\ncolumn 1). Results show that households were significantly more\nlikely to receive remittances from migrants who were working\nin the Middle East and Other Asian countries as compared to\nthe remittance/income of those who are working in Nepal. To be\nprecise, the odds of receiving remittances from a migrant who is\nworking in the Middle East is 4.73 times greater (odds ratio=4.73;\np<=.01; model 1) than the odds of receiving remittances/ income\nfrom migrants working in Nepal. Similarly, the odds of receiving\nremittances from a migrant who is in Other Asian countries is 3.50\ntimes higher (odds ratio=3.50; p<.10) than the odds of receiving\nremittances/income from migrants in Nepal. The unadjusted results\nshow that households are less likely to report receiving remittances\nfrom migrants who are working in India and America, Australia and\nEurope, but the results are not statistically significant.\nResults in model 2 are the effects of migrant's destination on whether\na household received remittance or not controlling for sex, age,\nmarital status, education, migration experience, number of migrants\nin the household, and household size and caste/ethnicity.

Results for the Middle East and Other Asian countries\nturned out to be statistically not significant after controlling for other\ncharacteristics particularly after the inclusion of age and education\nsuggesting that these factors were more important than destination\nitself.\nTable 6: Estimated receipt of remittances (odds ratios!) by\nMeasures Model 1 Model 2\nCurrent destination (Ref=Nepal)\nIndia\nMiddle East\nOther Asia\nAmerica, Australia and Europe\nIndividual characteristics\nGender (1=female)\nMarital status (1=married)\nEducation (Ref=5 years or below)\nMigration experience (years)\nHousehold characteristics\nNumber of migrants from the household\nHousehold size\nCaste/ethnicity (Ref=Brahmin/Chhetri)\nDalit\nHill Janajati\nNewar\nTarai Janajati\nIntercept\none-tailed, t-values in parenthesis\n# Smaller values compared to the null model values are\nconsidered better.\n!

Increased number of migrants from a household\nreduced the odds of receiving remittances at home.\nAmount of remittances received by households from working\nmigrants\nOn average, a migrant household received 12,382 NRs. in a month\nfrom a migrant who was working, individually. The unadjusted\n(descriptive) results in Table 5 show that there is a statistically\nsignificant variation in the amount of remittances received by\nhouseholds from working migrants (as well as remitters) by place of\ndestination.The unadjusted results show that on average, a household\nreceived the highest amount (NRs. 18,584, column 2) of remittance\nper month from migrants who were working in America, Australia\nand Europe. This was followed by Middle East (NRs. 15,040), Other\nreceived a least amount (NRs. 2,583) of remittances from migrants\nwhowereworkingwithinNepaloutsideofChitwan.Amongremitters\nonly, on average, a household received NRs. 24,558 (Table 5, column\n3) per month from migrants who were working inAmerica,Australia\nand Europe. This was followed by Other Asian countries (NRs.\nremitters only, a household received NRs. 3,942 from migrants who\nwere working in Nepal.\nDoes this variation in the amount of remittances received by\nhouseholds from migrants working in various destinations hold true\nafteradjustingforotherindividualandhouseholdlevelcharacteristics?\nThe results of multilevel models (Table 7) are discussed below. Two\nseparate models are estimated. Results in model 1include migrants\nwho are currently working at the destination irrespective of whether\na household received any remittance from them or not. In model 2,\nonly those migrants who are currently working at the destination\nand the household reported receipt of remittances from him/her are\nexamined.\nFirst,asdiscussedearlier,anullorunconditionalmodelwasestimated.\nThe random intercepts in both models are statistically significant\nwhich implied that there is a variation in the amount of remittances\nreceived by a household by geographic clusters suggesting for a\nmultilevel modeling (Garson, 2007). Outcome measure, the amount\nof remittances received per month, is normalized (natural log) to\navoid influence of any outliers in the data.\nThe results in model 1, among all working migrants, show that\nthe amount of remittances received from migrants statistically\nsignificantly varied by destination even after adjusting for all other\ncontrols. For instance, household report of the amount of remittances\nreceived from migrants who were working in India, in fact, was\nsignificantly less (slope=-2.43 (logged), p<.05, model 1) compared\nto those who were working in Nepal. Surprisingly, this difference\nwas wiped out (slope=0.48 (logged), p>.05, model 2) when only\nremittance sending individuals were included in the model (model\n2). This result suggests that if only migrants who send remittances\nare compared, the amount of money received from migrants working\nin India and Nepal is not significantly different. This could be\ntrue because mostly unskilled migrants work in India. However,\na household received significantly large amount of remittances\nfrom migrants who were working in Other Asian countries (2.97\ntimes logged) and Middle East (2.10 times logged) as compared to\nthose who were working in Nepal. Interestingly, the amount was\nstatistically significantly not different among migrants working in\nAmerica, Australia and Europe and in Nepal. When only remitters\nare considered (model 2), a household received significantly large\namount of remittances from migrants who were working in Other\nAsian countries (2.97 times logged), America, Australia and\nEurope (2.27 times logged) and Middle East (2.10 times logged) as\ncompared to those who were working in Nepal. These results imply\nthat the remittance received by households does vary by migrant's\ndestination.\nTable 7: Estimated amounts of remittances received per month from migrants by households of western Chitwan,\nMeasures All working migrants\nRemitters only\nCurrent destination (Reference=Nepal)\nIndia\nMiddle East\nOther Asia\nAmerica, Australia and Europe\nIndividual characteristics\nGender\nMarital status\nEducation (Ref=5 years or below)\nMigration experience (years)\nHousehold characteristics\nNumber of migrants from the household\nHousehold size\nCaste/ethnicity (Ref=Brahmin/Chhetri)\nDalit\nHill Janajati\nNewar\nTarai Janajati\nIntercept\n-2 log L (deviance) (Null)#\n-2 log L (deviance)\nAIC (Null)#\nAIC\nBIC (Null)#\nBIC\n+P<.10, * P<.05, ** P<.01, ***P<.001 all probabilities are one-tailed, t-values in parenthesis.\n# Smaller values compared to the null model values are considered better.\nA household received significantly less amount of remittances\nfrom females compared to their male counterparts (in both models\n1 and 2). Migration experience slightly increased the amount of\nremittances received. An increase in number of migrants in the\nhousehold significantly decreased the amount of remittances\nreceived by a household. This is as expected. Migrants tend to share\nthe responsibility/obligation as well as risk and therefore are less\nlikely to remit if a household has multiple migrants (ZaiLiang & Ma,\n2013). The amount of remittances received by households, however,\ndid not significantly vary by migrant's age, marital status, education,\nhousehold size and caste/ethnicity. These results are consistent with\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nNepalisexperiencingmassiveout-migrationofyouthsmorerecently.\nMigration has been a rite of passage for individuals. Households are\nincreasingly relying on migration and remittances for livelihood.\nWith the increase of out-migrants, the volume of remittances is\nincreasing over time. Now, the remittance from migrants has been\nan important source of a household's economy (Nepal Rastra Bank,\nNepali youths are scattered globally. Evidence suggests that earning\npotentials for migrants vary by destination. Some destinations such\nas America, Australia, Europe, Japan, and South Korea have high\nearning potentials. Middle Eastern countries are of medium earning\npotentials. Other destination such as India has low earning potential.\nIt was widely believed that the remittance received by households\ndoes vary by migrant's destination. However, less was known\nabout this and empirical support was scanty. This exploratory study\nprovides empirical evidence on whether the receipt of remittances\nand the amount of remittances received by households do vary by\nmigrant's destination using the recently collected data from the\nwestern Chitwan Valley of Nepal.\nFindings reveal that net of migrant's and household characteristics,\na household receipt of remittances varied by migrant's destination.\nAdjusting for other factors, if migrants are working in India, a\nhousehold is significantly less likely to receive remittances from\nthem as compared to those who are working in Nepal. This could\nbe because most migrants may bring remittances with them when\nthey return. Evidence also suggests that a household is more likely\nto receive remittances, if a member is working in the Middle East\nor in Other Asian countries. Surprisingly, if a member is working\nin America, Australia or Europe, a household is equally likely to\nreceive remittances from those who are working in Nepal. This could\nbe due to the fact that most migrants at these destinations are usually\nwith their families and may not be able to send savings back home.\nOr, because of the possibility of settlement, migrants may also spend\nearnings in order for settlement at the destination.\nTheevidencefurthersuggeststhattheamountofremittancesreceived\nby households from migrants working in India is not statistically\nsignificantly different from the amount received from those working\nin Nepal. This is as expected because India is the country with low\nearning potential. Nepali migrants are compelled to go to India due\nto several reasons. It is easy and less expensive to go to India and\nfind a job (Seddon et al., 1998). Even the unacceptable jobs (with\nless respect and low earning or so called faltukam or useless work) in\nNepal are acceptable in India (Sharma, 2011). Temporary migration\nof short duration is another reason to migrate to India. Migrants may\ngo to India during off-crop seasons in Nepal, work there for a short\nperiod of time (3-4 months) and return home with some money which\nis not possible in other destinations. Migrants escape from traditional\nwork particularly halo jotne (ploughing the field) or bharibokne\n(carrying loads) when they go to India.\nAs hypothesized, evidence show that households received\nsignificantly more amount of remittances from migrants working\nin regions with high earning potentials. For instance, households\nreceived significantly higher amount of remittances from those who\nwere working in OtherAsian countries (2.29 times logged),America,\nAustralia and Europe (2.27 times logged) and the Middle East (1.76\ntimes logged) as compared to the amount received from migrants\nworking in Nepal, net of all other factors. The largest (adjusted)\namount of remittances was received from migrants working in Other\nAsian countries (e.g. Japan, South Korea, Malaysia) followed by\nAmerica, Australia and Europe and the Middle East. These adjusted\nresults are as expected by Seddon et al. (1998).\nThe results from this study have important implications. First, there\nis variation in the amount of remittances received from migrants\nworking in various destinations. As hypothesized, the evidence\nsuggests that households received significantly higher amount of\nremittances from migrants who are working in countries with high\nearning potentials and vice versa. Such destination specific variation\nin the amount of remittance received by households will increase\nincome inequality among migrant households. Moreover, organizing\nmigration in countries with high earning potentials requires high\ninvestment and social networks in terms of education, training,\nonly resourceful individuals may migrate to countries with higher\nearning potentials. Using data from Nepal Living Standard Survey\n(privileged caste, rich, educated, land owners) were more likely\nto choose destinations where earning opportunities are relatively\nbetter. Gurung reported that individuals from richer households were\nfound to migrate to countries other than India and those from poorer\nhouseholds migrated to India or rural Nepal. On the other hand, Hill\nJanajati migrants were more likely to go to the Middle East, Malaysia\nand other developed countries. This scenario suggests individuals\nfrom households that are already privileged in Nepal will move to\ndestinations with high earning potentials. Such households receive\nhigher amount of remittances, thus further deepening the inequalities\namong households in sending areas. Similar observations were made\nby Jones and Basnett (2013) who reported that nearly one-third of the\nremittance was received by the richest quintile households.\nMoreover, evidences suggest that remittance has important effect\non household's poverty reduction and children's human capital\ndevelopment such as schooling and health (e.g. De & Ratha, 2012;\nDey, 2015). Variation in the amount of remittances received by\nmigrant households from migrants working in different destinations\nwill have important implications on the utilization of remittances by\nhouseholds. Such a variation in the amount of remittances received\nby households will have differential impact on poverty alleviation\nand children's human capital development. Again the privileged\nhouseholds will be in better-off situation. This is just one example.\nThere could be several important implications where remittances\ncould have direct or indirect effects. This will lead to a vicious cycle\nthat originates from destination specific migration. Further studies\nare needed to examine such influences.\nWhile this study has important contributions to the field of migration\nand remittance research, it is not free from limitations. The results\nare based on data from a small sample of migrant households\ncollected from a part of the southern Tarai plain of rural Nepal.\nThus, the findings may not be generalizable to other parts of the\ncountry. Moreover, the associations described earlier are based on\ncross-sectional data. Thus, the conclusions should be considered\nrather cautiously. However, this study helps generate theoretically\nimportant and policy relevant research questions for future studies.\nIt is also believed that this study will help develop hypothesis and\ntest the causality of the effects of destination specific migration and\nremittances on various aspects of household economy. The findings\nwill be useful to those who are interested in studying the long-term\nconsequences of migration and remittances such as reducing income\ninequality or poverty.\nReferences\nAcharya, C.
