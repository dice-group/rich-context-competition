In practice, however, capital inflows can rapidly turn into capital\noutflows thereby creating economic instability or even financial crises, especially in developing\ncountries.\nBroadly speaking, capital flows can be divided into foreign direct investment, portfolio\ninvestment, and bank lending. While bank lending has lost in importance as a source of finance in\ninflows. As German banks are among the major creditors to industrial as well as developing\ncountries, their lending behaviour is of particular interest.\nThis paper analyses German banks' lending behaviour towards industrial and non-industrial\ncountries. In particular, the discrepancy in bank lending to these two country groups is explained\nas about 85 percent is directed to industrial and only about 15 percent to non-industrial countries.\nThe analysis is conduced in two steps. First, the determinants of German bank lending are\nestimated using a gravity model positing that claims depend positively on recipient countries'\neconomic size and negatively on the distance to Germany as well as other factors. Second, the\nlending gap between IC and Non-IC countries is decomposed into one part stemming from\ndifferences in countries' endowments and one part that results from German banks' different\ntreatment of these country groups with respect to their fundamentals.\nThe findings are that market size proxies, distance from Germany, foreign direct investment and\ncountry risk explain most of the variation in German foreign claims. With respect to the lending\ngap between IC and Non-IC countries, it turns out that differences in countries' factor\nendowments explain more than two thirds of this gap, while less than one third is unexplained\nand hence due to different treatment of countries' fundamentals and a residual of unobserved\nfactors.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nAus theoretischer Sicht bieten internationale Kapitalfl\u00fcsse sowohl f\u00fcr Kreditnehmer als auch\nKreditgeber die M\u00f6glichkeit, Risiken besser zu streuen und die \u00f6konomische Effizienz zu\nsteigern. In der Realit\u00e4t k\u00f6nnen Kapitalzufl\u00fcsse sich jedoch schnell in Kapitalabfl\u00fcsse\nverwandeln und somit zu Instabilit\u00e4t oder sogar Finanzkrisen beitragen.\nIm Allgemeinen kann man Kapitalfl\u00fcsse in Direktinvestitionen, Portfolioinvestitionen und\nBankkredite unterteilen. Wenngleich Bankkredite in den 90er Jahren im Vergleich zu den 70er\nund 80er Jahren an Bedeutung verloren haben, machen sie immer noch etwa 20 Prozent aller\nKapitalzufl\u00fcsse aus. Da die deutschen Banken zu den gr\u00f6\u00dften Kreditgebern weltweit geh\u00f6ren, ist\nihr Kreditvergabeverhalten von besonderem Interesse.\nIn diesem Papier wird die Kreditvergabe deutscher Banken an Industrie- und Nicht-\nIndustriel\u00e4nder analysiert. Insbesondere wird das Ziel verfolgt, die Diskrepanz in der\nKreditvergabe an diese beiden L\u00e4ndergruppen, 85 Prozent aller Kredite gehen an Industriel\u00e4nder\nund lediglich 15 Prozent an Nicht-Industriel\u00e4nder, zu erkl\u00e4ren.\nDas Vorgehen unterteilt sich in zwei Schritte. Zun\u00e4chst werden die Determinanten der deutschen\nKreditvergabe unter Verwendung eines Gravit\u00e4tsmodells gesch\u00e4tzt. Aus dem Modell l\u00e4sst sich\nableiten, dass die Kreditvergabe unter anderem positiv von der wirtschaftlichen Gr\u00f6\u00dfe eines\nNehmerlandes und negativ von der Distanz zu Deutschland abh\u00e4ngt.

Opponents emphasise that capital flows\nmay result in higher economic instability and vulnerability to crises.3 To understand the\ndeterminants of capital flows and their volatility has thus been an aim of empirical studies.4\nThe focus in this paper is on the determinants of one specific form of capital, namely German\nbank lending, and on one aspect of instability that arises from banks treating countries as a group\nrather than as individual countries. In theory, claims to different country groups such as industrial\n(IC) and non-industrial countries (Non-IC) may either deviate because countries in these groups\ndiffer with respect to their characteristics (e.g. market size) or because characteristics are treated\ndifferently, i.e. market size is valued differently depending on whether a country belongs to the\nIC or Non-IC country group. As is well known, banks have regional limits for their exposures in\n# This paper is part of a project between the Department of Banking Supervision at the Deutsche Bundesbank and\nthe Chair for International Macroeconomics of Beatrice Weder at the University of Mainz.

Second,\nthe estimated gravity model is used to decompose the lending gap between industrial and non-\nindustrial countries in a \"characteristics\" and a \"treatment\" effect.\nThe paper thus contributes to the literature in two ways: Firstly, by estimating a gravity equation\nfor German bank lending using a new micro panel data-set and secondly by applying the Oaxaca\n(1973) decomposition technique to the gravity model, which has not yet been done. With respect\nto the discrepancy in lending towards IC and Non-IC countries, this technique makes it possible\nto calculate the share of the lending difference due to countries' endowments and the share\nstemming from unequal treatment of IC and Non-IC countries, respectively.\nThe findings of the paper can be summarized as follows: The gravity model shows that market\nsize proxies, distance from Germany, foreign direct investment and country risk account for 80\npercent of the variation in German bank loans. With respect to the lending gap between IC and\nNon-IC countries, I find that differences in countries' factor endowments explain more than two\nthirds of this gap, while less than one third is unexplained and hence due to different treatment of\ncountries' fundamentals and a residual of unobserved factors.\nThe paper is structured as follows. First, I review the literature relevant to the study in Section 2.\nFollowing this, the empirical methodology applied in the paper will be outlined in Section 3.\n5 Calvo et al. (1996) posit for instance that \"the Mexican crisis of late 1994 tended to make the attitude of investors\ntoward emerging markets more discriminating\". Note, however, that it is not the aim of this paper to stress the\nimpact of outstanding events, but rather to study treatment of country groups in general.\n6 This question is also related to the Lucas Paradox, i.e. why capital does not flow from rich to poor countries.\nHowever, as I do not have data on net German bank lending (inflows minus outflows) but only on German foreign\nbank lending, my results do not provide an explanation of the Lucas Paradox in the strict sense as outlined in Lucas\nSubsequently, I describe the data sources and some stylised facts about banks' foreign exposures\nin Sections 4, while results are presented in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.\n2 Review of the literature\nAs German bank lending is the focus of this study, I will briefly put it into perspective. Broadly\nspeaking, private capital flows can be divided into foreign direct investment, equity or bond\nflows and bank lending.7 Albeit bank lending has decreased in importance as a source of capital\npercent of capital inflows to emerging markets and its high volatility has been an issue of\nongoing concern.8 With regard to the importance of German bank lending in international bank\nlending, it should be noted that German banks have been among the largest creditors to emerging\nmarkets in the last decade and account, at par with the US, for about 15-20 percent of all\ninternational bank claims.9\nDue to the impact of capital flows on countries' development and economic well being,\nnumerous empirical studies have been conducted to understand foreign direct investment\npatterns, equity and bond flows as well as international banks' lending behaviour.\n7 Each form has specific benefits and drawbacks. Prasad et al. (2003) show that FDI flows are for instance much less\nvolatile than other capital flows. See also Reisen and Soto (2001) who analyse the relationship between different\ntypes of capital flows and economic growth.\n8 In the 1970s, capital flows mainly comprised bank lending. This was attributable to bank deposits stemming from\nOPEC countries' current account surpluses (see Chadha and Folkerts-Landau, 1999). In the 1980s, however, bank\nlending declined dramatically as world interest rates rose and a severe debt crisis affected many developing\ncountries. In contrast, the early 1990s are characterised by a surge of private capital flows. The financial crises in\nwhile FDI flows have steadily increased. See e.g. Alfaro et al. (2005) for a review of capital flows from 1970 and\n9 See Consolidated Banking Statistics, Bank for International Settlements.\nAn approach often used for analysing international capital movements is to estimate a gravity\nmodel.10 The basic idea behind a gravity model is related to physics and the fact that\n\"gravitational attraction between two bodies depends upon the mass of each body and the\ndistance separating them\".11 As attrition in physics, certain frictions will, however, impede the\nexchange in goods or capital.12 As a consequence, the gravity model has been augmented to\ncontrol for different sources of frictions in international capital flows.13\nThe gravity model, albeit initially an empirical approach, has been deduced from a variety of\neconomic theories on goods and asset trade, respectively. Concerning the volume of trade, for\ninstance Helpman (1998, p. 24) derives an equation in which the volume of trade depends\npositively on the trading partners' GDP levels. Martin and Rey (2004) specify a theoretical model\nto analyse the determinants of asset flows from which the gravity equation emerges.14 Buch\n(2000) outlines a portfolio model suggesting that excess returns, market size and risks determine\nforeign lending activities of commercial banks.\nAs this paper applies an augmented gravity model to analyse German bank lending, three recent\npapers using gravity models to explain bank lending are related to the present paper. First, Rose\nand Spiegel (2004) estimate a gravity model in the context of sovereign default using bank claims\nas dependent variable. Their analysis is based on the hypothesis that trade sanctions imply a\nsevere penalty following a country's default. Hence, they expect creditors with larger bilateral\ntrade flows to have a comparative advantage in bank lending as their power to penalize is ceteris\nparibus higher. Using the \"Consolidated Banking Statistics\" provided by the Bank for\n10 This methodology dates back to Tinbergen (1962) and P\u00f6yh\u00f6nen (1963), who estimated a gravity model for trade\nflows.\n11 See Baldwin (1994, p. 119). In the context of this paper, the gravity equation postulates that bank lending between\nGermany and other countries depends on countries' economic size and information costs.\n12 On this issue, Tinbergen (1962, p. 265) writes: \"Apart from purely economic variables it is likely that political or\nsemi-political factors play a part in determining the volume of trade between countries\".\n13 Rose (2000) for instance estimates a gravity model for bilateral trade controlling for currency unions, an issue also\ndating back to Tinbergen's (1962, p. 265) study, in which he controlled for \"the existence of special trade\nagreements\" by including a specific dummy variable to measure this effect.\n14 Strictly speaking, their equation depends on financial wealth, aggregate consumption, transaction costs as well as\nthe expected return of assets (see Martin and Rey, 2004, p. 352). For assets such as equities, financial wealth is\nproxied in empirical applications by stock market capitalisation, see e.g. Portes and Rey (1999). For bank lending,\nthe volume of GDP seems more appropriate (see Buch and Lipponer (2004) or Papaioannou (2005)).\nInternational Settlements (BIS), they find a statistically and economically significant impact of\ntrade flows on bank lending.15\nPapaioannou (2005) estimates a gravity model using the \"Locational Banking Statistics\", a\ndifferent data source from the BIS.16 Instead of analysing stocks of claims as Rose and Spiegel\n(2004), this author looks at currency adjusted lending flows. This study, covering flows of BIS\nreporting countries and their respective debtors from 1984 to 2002, stresses the importance of\ninstitutional quality for bank lending.17 The results point to a positive and significant as well as\nrobust impact of institutional quality on the size of absolute bank flows.\nAlso related to the present study is a paper by Buch and Lipponer (2004) using a gravity model to\nanalyse a) which German banks go abroad and b) whether banks enter new markets via\nsubsidiaries (FDI) or via cross-border financial services.18 They find that larger GDP and bilateral\ntrade flows are positively linked to German banking activities abroad, while distance exerts a\n15 A major problem of their paper is, however, whether the observed relationship is in fact due to comparative\nadvantage in penalizing sovereign defaults. An impact of trade on lending may also occur for a variety of other\nreasons. Among a number of reasons put forward in a paper by Wright (2004), one obvious channel between trade\nflows and bank lending exists because banks offer trade credits and hence countries with high bilateral trading\nvolumes also have larger bank claims on each other.\n16 Note that both data-sets (Consolidated Banking Statistics and Locational Banking Statistics) have advantages and\ndisadvantages. While the Consolidated Banking Statistics data takes for instance lending between banks at home and\ntheir subsidiaries abroad into account, there is no adjustment for changes in stocks of claims due to currency\nchanges. The Locational Banking Statistics, on the other hand, provides flow data adjusted for currency fluctuations\nbut does not control for intra-bank lending. For more information on the different BIS data sources see Wooldridge\n17 For an analysis of the impact of institutional quality on stock returns in emerging markets see Bilson et al. (2002).\nAlfaro et al. (2003) emphasize the role of institutions when explaining the Lucas Paradox. See Political Risk Services\nGroup (2003) for a description of the index.\n18 Cross-border financial services are defined as the sum of bank premiums and interest rate returns paid and\nreceived. FDI is defined as claim from a German bank to its foreign affiliate. Their analysis is based on data from the\nDeutsche Bundesbank and hence only one creditor country, Germany, and its activities abroad is subject of the\nanalysis in their as well as in this paper.\n19 It should be noted that the data used in our paper, albeit also stemming from the Bundesbank, differs from Buch\nand Lipponer (2004) in two respects: Firstly, we use the stock of foreign claims, i.e. the volume of outstanding\nclaims, rather than the volume of premiums and interest payments on these claims as dependent variable. Premiums\nand Interest rate payments are defined as the volume of claims multiplied with claim specific premiums and interest\nrates, respectively. Secondly, we concentrate on consolidated claims for the largest 15 banks instead of claims for all\nbanks, as consolidated data is not available for all banks. These 15 banks account for 75 percent of all consolidated\nclaims. Our data stem from the Department for Banking and Financial Supervision. As we consolidated the data\nourselves, we limited the coverage of banks due to time constraints to the largest banks in German foreign lending.\n3 Empirical methodology\nThe empirical part of the paper is divided into two sections. In the first section, an augmented\ngravity model along the lines of Buch and Lipponer (2004), Rose and Spiegel (2004) and\nPapaioannou (2005) is estimated. In the second part, the mean difference in claims towards\nindustrial and non-industrial countries is decomposed into an \"explained\" and an \"unexplained\"\npart by applying a technique proposed in Oaxaca (1973) including an extension suggested in Yun\n3.1 The augmented gravity model\nThe gravity model takes the following form:20\nLn(claimsb,c,t\n) = c +  *ln(gdpc,t\n)+ \u00df* ln(distc\n) +  ln(fdic,t\n) +  *ln(riskc,t\n)\n+  *mcc,t\n+ \u00b5b\n+ \u00b5c\n+ \u00b5t\n+ b,c,t\nwhere subscript b stands for creditor bank, c for the receiving country and t for time (year).\nThe dependent variable is:\n- Ln (claimsb,c,t\n): Log of real claims (stock) from bank b to country c in year t\nThe set of regressors21 include:\n- Ln(gdpc,t\n): Log of real GDP of country c in year t\n- Ln(distc\n): Log of distance of country c from Germany\n- Ln(fdic,t\n): Log of real FDI (stock) from Germany in country c in year t\n- Ln(riskc,t\n): Log of an index for country risk (combining political, economic as well as\nfinancial risk) of country c in year t\n- Mcc,t\n: Stock market capitalisation in % of GDP of country c in year t\n20 All variables are denominated in Euro or have been converted to Euro as described in Table 1 (Appendix).\nNote that the data-set exhibits three dimensions and thus three unobserved effects may exist:\nBank [\u00b5b\n], country [\u00b5c\n] and time [\u00b5t\n] specific effects. The error term b,c,t\nis assumed to have a\nmean of zero as well as a constant variance.\nI estimate this model using cluster regression, i.e. a general version of the random effects\nmodel.22 The baseline specification includes bank and time dummies to control for \u00b5b\nand \u00b5t\n. .\nControlling for \u00b5c\nis, however, not fully possible as including country dummies takes away all\nexplanatory power of the regressors.23 This can be seen by looking at Table 3, which exhibits an\nanalysis of variance of the variables across groups (defined as bank*country) and time (year).\nNote that the variance of the regressors (Xit\n) for the pooled data is by construction the sum of the\nbetween group variance and the within group variance. As can be seen, there is hardly any\nvariation of the data across time. Instead, most of the variation in the data stems from variation\nacross groups, i.e. bank country combinations, as shown by the similarity of between group\nvariation and pooled variation. Estimating a fixed effects model therefore does a priori not make\nsense as the variation within groups is very small.\nA standard random effects estimation is also not desirable due to the possible presence of\nheteroscedasticity which may stem from the fact that the regressors take on the same value for\neach bank. For example: GDP for Argentina in 1996 is the same for Deutsche Bank as well as\nDresdner Bank and all other banks, so is the value for country risk, FDI and market\ncapitalization.24 In other words, the explanatory variables only vary across country and time,\nresulting in a violation of the assumption that errors are independently distributed. Instead, errors\nmay systematically depend on specific groups, i.e. countries. This problem has been called the\n21 See Table 1 for sources and exact definitions of variables.\n22 This is done using STATA 8. For details on cluster regression see e.g. Manual [U], pp. 270.\n23 This will be shown in a regression in Section 4.\n24 Note that distance only varies across country and not time.\n\"Moulton Problem\" in the literature.25 The problem is solved by estimating cluster regressions,\nwhere the country dimension is defined as cluster.26\nA common concern in regression analysis is endogeneity of the regressors with respect to the\ndependent variable resulting in a correlation of the explanatory variable with the error term and\nthus inconsistent estimates of the \u00df coefficients. In the gravity model estimated, endogeneity is,\nhowever, not a major concern as we use individual bank data. It is unlikely that German bank\nlending significantly influences the right hand side variables such as GDP, FDI, country risk or\nmarket capitalization.\nChoice of variables\nThe determinants of German foreign lending in this paper include the \"usual\" gravity factors such\nas GDP and distance as proxies for market size and information costs. As additional controls, the\nstock of FDI, an index covering political, economic and financial country risk in the borrower\ncountry as well as stock market capitalisation in percent of GDP in debtor countries are included\nin the baseline specification. The model is estimated for the full sample as well as separately for\nIC and non-IC countries. We expect the following effects of the explanatory variables:\nGDP: GDP is commonly used in gravity models as a proxy for market size. As I only analyse\nbank lending from Germany to other countries, I only include the recipient country's GDP. On\nthe one hand, larger claims are ceteris paribus demanded to finance expenditures and on the other\nhand, German banks face more opportunities to invest, which results in a larger supply of credit.\nHence, I expect a positive coefficient on GDP.\nDistance: A priori, the effect of distance is ambiguous. Albeit most empirical studies such Portes\ndistance on capital flows or asset holdings, a positive effect of distance can be rationalised from a\n25 See Moulton (1986). Unadjusted standard errors may exhibit a large bias downwards implying the danger of\nspurious regression. The problem arises if errors are correlated within groups. In our case, a group is country.\n26 Note that standard errors estimated with a cluster regression are also \"robust\", i.e. cluster takes serial correlation as\nwell as heteroscedasticity into account.\nportfolio point of view. While the former effect is explained by rising information costs in\ncountries situated further away, the latter effect can be rationalised by deceasing business cycle\ncorrelations in more distant countries and thus an opportunity to diversify a bank's portfolio (see\nFDI: In the baseline regression, I include the stock of German FDI instead of trade flows because\nit is a stock variable as the dependent variable. Intuitively, as banks finance part of companies'\nFDI, countries receiving ceteris paribus more FDI from German companies are expected to\nreceive higher claims than others, i.e. German banks follow their customers abroad (see Buch,\n2000). Furthermore, banks may follow FDI also due to better information about the country\ngained from financing FDI or even from the knowledge of German companies abroad.28\nCountry risk: Concerning the index for country risk, which includes for instance countries'\ngovernment stability and democratic accountability as proxies for political risk, inflation and\ncurrent account deficit as economic variables, or short term debt as financial risk, among others,\nwe expect a positive coefficient: Countries with lower country risk (i.e. larger value of the\nvariable) receive ceteris paribus more foreign claims. Several studies have recently explored the\neffect of country risk on capital flows.29\nMarket capitalisation: Finally, stock market capitalisation in percent of GDP is included to\nproxy for the size of countries' financial markets as in Buch and Lipponer (2004) and Portes and\nRey (1999). It is, however, an empirical question whether market capitalisation exerts a positive\nor negative impact on German banks' foreign assets: A larger financial market implies more\ndemand for loans as well as opportunities to invest and can thus be considered an additional\nproxy for market size. However, a high ratio of market capitalisation to GDP might also mirror a\n27 Note that Tinbergen (1962, p. 263) pointed out that distance would not only proxy for transportation but also for\ninformation costs. Portes and Rey (1999) find that the coefficient of distance drops when including other measures of\ninformation asymmetries implying that distance indeed is a proxy for information costs. Note, however, that distance\nin this paper not only proxies information but to some extent for physical transport costs as long as banks are\nfinancing foreign trade (see Buch, 1999).\n28 Note that German FDI is positively and distance negatively correlated with Germany's bilateral trade flows and\nthus both variables capture trade financing activities of German banks to some extend.\nmarket-based in contrast to a bank-based system and thus a ceteris paribus lower demand for\nforeign claims if these are considered as substitutes rather than complements.30\n3.2 The decomposition analysis\nWith respect to the literature on decomposition analysis it should be noted that there is, according\nto my best knowledge, no study that has applied this technique in the context of either gravity\nmodels for trade flows or international bank lending. The technique, initially introduced by\nOaxaca (1973), allows to decompose the mean difference of the dependent variable (the average\ndifference in claims to IC and Non-IC countries) into a part stemming from different\ncharacteristics (such as market size, distance etc.), i.e. an \"explained part\" and an \"unexplained\npart\" stemming from different \u00df-coefficients obtained in separate regressions for IC and Non-IC\nThe technique, albeit initially used to decompose wage differentials between men and women or\npublic and private sector employees, is not confined to this subject area but can be applied in\nother areas as well.32 Examples include Ham, Svejnar and Terrell (1998) who study\nunemployment duration, Moore and Newman (1988) focusing on American post-war trade union\nmembership or Heitmueller (2004) analysing job mobility between England and Scotland.\nIn the present paper, the mean difference in bank claims towards industrial and non-industrial\ncountries can thus be decomposed into an explained as well as an unexplained part. I first\nestimate the augmented gravity model for the two respective groups, industrial and non-industrial\ncountries.\ng g g g\nY X  \n30 Traditionally, financial sectors are described either as market-based or bank based systems, respectively. See\nLevine (2002) for an economic assessment of the two types across countries. Note that this distinction is not only an\nissue for industrial countries but also for developing countries. Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (1996) show for\ninstance that bank and equity finance are rather complements than substitutes in developing countries.\n31 If omission of variables is not a concern, this part reflects unequal treatment of IC and Non-IC countries.\nwith Y, a vector (n x 1) of the dependent variable (ln_claims), X, a matrix (n x k) of regressors, \u00df,\na vector (k x 1) of coefficients, and an error term,  (n x 1).

The second term named unexplained is the difference between the estimated slope\ncoefficients (i.e., \u00dfs) for IC and Non-IC countries weighted by the average level of characteristics\nof Non-IC countries.35 Thus, ceteris paribus, the weighted difference in \u00df-coefficients results in a\nmean difference of the dependent variable of magnitude \"unexplained\".\n33 Y (1 x 1) is the mean of the dependent variable, X is a row vector (1 x k) of means of the explanatory variables\nand \u00df a column vector (k x 1) of estimated coefficients from (1).\nn_IC IC n_IC\nIC n_IC IC n_IC n_IC\nIC\n^ ^ ^ ^\nDefine: X (X X ) and  (  ).

Thus, the results of both weighting schemes will be\npresented.\nHaving decomposed the difference, we know how much is explained by disparities in countries'\nfundamentals and how much is unexplained and thus due to different behaviour (shown in\ndifferent \u00df-coefficients) of German banks with respect to industrial and non-industrial countries,\nrespectively.\nHence, the findings shed light on the question why bank lending from Germany to IC and Non-IC\ncountries differs. However, these are aggregate figures and we do not know yet which of the\nregressors and coefficients, respectively, contributes how much to this difference.\nFurther insights can be obtained from a detailed decomposition of the difference in the means of\nthe dependent variable. For each explanatory variable and for each \u00df-coefficient one can compute\nits share of the total explained and unexplained part, respectively.\nIC,j n_IC,j\nj IC,j\n^\nExplained (x x ) \nn_IC,j\nj IC,j n_IC,j\n^ ^\nUnexplained x (  )\nThus, Explainedj\nrepresents the fraction of the explained difference in (4) due to differences in\nthe jth mean characteristic. Take country risk as an example: Because IC and Non-IC countries\nhave different average values of country risk, the difference in mean (log) outstanding claims is\nof magnitude Explainedj\n. Similarly, Unexplainedj\nis the part of the unexplained component in\nequation (4) that is due to differences in the jth \u00df-coefficient, e.g. a different \u00df-coefficient of the\nvariable country risk, weighted by the average country risk in Non-IC countries.36\n36 Note that an identification problem has to be taken into account with respect to the detailed decomposition of the\ncoefficients effect for dummy variables. As a matter of fact, the detailed coefficients effect is sensitive to the left out\nreference group (see e.g. Oaxaca and Ransom 1999). Yun (2003) proposes a solution to the problem that was applied\nin the paper. As we apply decomposition to an OLS regression, the formulas can be directly applied as shown in Yun\nNote that by construction, the explained part in (4) is the sum of all individual explained parts in\nk\nj\nExplained =Explained\n\u00a6 . The same holds for the individual unexplained parts, i.e.\nUnexplained Unexplained\nk\nj\n=\n\u00a6 .\nPossible Caveats of decomposition analysis\nBefore turning to the data sources and results, I discuss some potential caveats when applying\ndecomposition analysis. First, some coefficients might turn out significant for one group but not\nfor the other, which is not taken into account by the analysis (see Moore and Newman, 1988). In\nour study, however, this will not pose a large problem as most coefficients are at least almost\nsignificant for both samples. Second, some variables a priori only matter for one group but not\nthe other: A dummy variable for EU membership would take the value zero for all Non-IC\ncountries prior to 2004 and hence cannot be estimated. In this paper, we encounter outliers that\ncould be controlled for by dummy variables and an interaction term, however only for the Non-\nIC sample. The dummy as well as the interaction term cannot be estimated for the IC sample and\ntherefore need to be excluded, which is dissatisfactory to some extent. Third, an identification\nproblem exists with respect to dummy variables, i.e. the estimated detailed coefficients effect\n(equation 6) attributed to a dummy variable depends on the choice of the left-out reference group\n(see Oaxaca and Ransom, 1999). To take an example, the coefficient effect of a time dummy\nin the regression. Despite the fact that we are not interested in a particular dummy variable in this\nstudy (we only include time and bank dummies), we take this problem into account by applying a\ncorrection suggested in Yun (2003). The correction approximates the \"true\" contribution of\nindividual dummy variables to the difference in claims by averaging the estimates with various\nreference groups (in the example above, the \"true\" coefficient effect is the average of one\nregression with a dummy for 1999 and one with a dummy for 2000 included in the regression).\nFourth, as we need to make predictions of the dependent variable in the decomposition analysis,\na high R2 is desirable (see Bender 2003). Thus, in the context of this paper, it is desirable to\nexplain a large fraction of the variance in foreign bank claims. As gravity models generally\nexplain a large fraction of the dependent variable, in our case around 80%, this is not a serious\nconcern in the present study. Fifth, as out of sample predictions are needed to decompose the\ndifference in average claims, we need to assume that the variables enter the model in the same\nfunctional form in IC as well as Non-IC country regressions. I use the standard functional form\nsuggested in the literature on gravity models for capital flows and thus this issue raises no major\nconcern in this study.37 As none of the other caveats has raised serious concerns, decomposition\nanalysis for the gravity model on bank claims can be performed.\n4 Data sources\nDependent Variable: The data on foreign claims of German banks, which I use in this paper, are\ncollected in the credit register of three million Deutsche Mark or more at the Deutsche\nBundesbank. German credit institutions are required to report all claims which have exceeded the\nthreshold of 1.5 million at the end of each quarter.38 To obtain an adequate measure of banks'\ntotal credit exposure, the data has been adjusted in several ways.39\nThe sample includes 15 German banks and their foreign subsidiaries covering 75 percent of total\n37 If this were not the case, a pooling of the two country groups would not be possible at all, even if one would\ncontrol for different intercepts and slope coefficients. While it makes sense that the impact of a variable varies with\nits level (e.g. decreasing importance of country size taken account of by including GDP in logarithmic form), there is\nno a priori reason why e.g. GDP should have a larger effect on Non-IC country lending provided other factors such\ncountry risk etc. are controlled for.\n38 Claims include on- and off-balance sheet activities. Off-balance-sheet items include derivatives (other than written\noption positions), guarantees assumed in respect of these, and other off-balance-sheet transactions (Deutsche\nBundesbank, 1998). The following items are deemed not to be credit exposures: shares in other enterprises\nirrespective of how they are shown in the balance sheet and securities in the trading portfolio.\n39 First, we consolidated all foreign claims to exclude inter-office positions between a head institution and its foreign\nsubsidiaries. Second, we subtracted publicly guaranteed claims from total claims to obtain a more accurate measure\nof banks' effective foreign exposure to credit risk. Hence, in comparison to other data sources the Bundesbank data\nallow a much better calculation of banks' credit exposures. However, there are also some important shortcomings.\nThere are no data available on valuation changes (for example write-downs of non-performing loans, currency\ncomposition). Furthermore, we have no information on banks' indirect exposures via their lending to other\ncommercial entities such as hedge funds. See Nestmann et al. (2004) for a detailed description and a descriptive\nanalysis of the data-set.\n40 Banks included are listed in Appendix I. For a detailed overview of the German banking system see Brunner et al.\n41 As not every bank has an exposure in all countries at all times, 5276 exposures show up in the data-set, with 3215\nobservations reported in Non-IC countries and 2061 in IC countries.\nExplanatory variables: The explanatory variables included in the regression analysis mainly stem\nfrom the World Development Indicators of the World Bank. Other sources are the Direction of\nTrade Statistics from the International Monetary Fund as well as the International Capital Links\nStatistics of Deutsche Bundesbank.\nSome stylised Facts\nSome stylised facts on German bank lending will now be highlighted. Table 2a shows total\nclaims by region for the period 1996 to 2002. Worth noting is the following: First, total claims to\nNon-IC countries, i.e. the gap between lending to IC and Non-IC countries has widened over\ntime. Second, Asia, Western Hemisphere and Emerging Europe receive the largest shares of\nlending to Non-IC countries, while exposure to Middle East and Africa is comparatively low.42\nThird, while claims to Asia have remained more or less constant, claims to Emerging Europe,\nWestern Hemisphere and Industrial countries have constantly been rising from year to year.43\nTable 2b exhibits the average annual exposure of large commercial as well as Land banks from\n1996 to 2002. As can be seen, the United States and the United Kingdom receive by far the\nlargest amount of German bank lending, followed by France and the Netherlands. Non-IC\ncountries obtaining large amounts of German credit are Brazil, Poland, Korea and Russia. About\ntwenty out of the 59 countries in our sample receive less than 1 Billion Euro per year with\nBolivia, Paraguay and Namibia each obtaining less than 100 Million Euro. It should be noted that\nthere is, however, a considerable variation of claims within IC and Non-IC countries,\nrespectively.\n42 Note that I use the regional classification of the IMF. Countries belong to Industrial countries, Asia, Africa, Middle\nEast, Western Hemisphere or Emerging Europe.\n43 Note that claims to Asia rose before the Asian crisis in 1997 and fell back to its pre-crisis level afterwards. The\nRussian crisis cannot be seen in the data, possibly because I use yearly averages of stocks of claims. Western\nHemisphere's exposure decreased after the crisis in Argentina in 2001.\nIn this section, the gravity model is estimated and tested for sensitivity. Afterwards, the\ndecomposition analysis will be carried out in Section 5.2 using the estimates of the baseline\ngravity equation obtained in Section 5.1.\n5.1 Results from estimating the augmented gravity model\nGerman bank lending can be analysed using a gravity model as described in Section 3.44 It posits\nthat bank lending depends positively on GDP, German companies' FDI, country risk as well as\nmarket capitalization in debtor countries and negatively on distance from Germany.45 Table 5a\nshows the results from estimating the baseline specification.\nTable 5a. Baseline specification\nAll countries, baseline IC countries,\nbaseline\nNon-IC countries,\nbaseline\nNotes: Dependent variable: Logarithm of claims of bank b on county c at time t. *; **; *** refer to 10%, 5%\nand 1% level of significance. Constant not reported. Time dummies as well as bank dummies included in all\nregressions, but not reported. T- values -based on robust standard errors- in parentheses: For (1) \u00ad (3), country\nis set as cluster, as described in Section 6. For definition of variables see Table 1.\nIn regression (1), all variables have the expected sign and are significant at the one percent level.\nDue to the fact that the dependent as well as all explanatory variables (apart from market\ncapitalization) are expressed in logarithms, we can interpret each \u00df-coefficient as elasticity. For\n44 With respect to the variables included in the baseline specification it should be noted that overlaps between IC and\nNon-IC countries exist for all variables.\n45 Note that country risk is scaled from 0 (very low risk) to 100 (very high risk) and thus larger values imply less risk.\ninstance, concerning the impact of market size on bank lending, we observe that a one percent\nhigher GDP leads on average to 0.76 percent higher claims. Geographical distance has the\nexpected negative sign implying that countries further away from Germany obtain ceteris paribus\nless bank lending. Note also that countries which host ceteris paribus more German FDI also\nobtain a larger amount of foreign claims and that a 1 percent lower country risk index induces a 4\npercent larger amount of claims. Finally, if the average market capitalization to GDP ratio is one\npercent higher, bank lending rises by 0.2 percent.46 As is common to gravity models, the variation\nof the dependent variable is well explained by the variation in the explanatory variables, as\nshown by the R2 value of 78 percent.\nColumns (2) and (3) from Table 5a show the baseline regression estimated separately for the two\ngroups focused on in this paper. The results are qualitatively similar to (1), i.e. coefficients have\nthe same sign. Concerning the magnitude, however, some differences stand out: Distance is not\ndifferent from zero for non-industrial countries, while it is negative and significant for the IC\nsample. This should, however, not be interpreted as if information costs do not play a role in bank\nlending to Non-IC countries. As mentioned above, the benefits of diversification may cancel\nincreased information costs out and therefore result in a neutral impact of distance on bank\nlending (see Buch, 1999). Concerning country risk, the coefficient for IC countries is not\nsignificant and slightly lower than for Non-IC countries. FDI and market capitalisation have\nalmost the same coefficient in both samples.\nI test the sensitivity of the baseline regression in several ways. First, I estimated the baseline\nusing claims adjusted for currency fluctuations (Table 5b). Second, I estimate the gravity model\nallowing for other structures of the error term as well as with and without outliers, respectively\n(Table 5c). Third, I check the sensitivity with respect to different time periods as well as\naggregated over all time periods (Table 5d). Fourth, I add banks' total assets as a bank specific\nvariable to the baseline specification (Table 5e). Fifth, I apply a Tobit regression to the gravity\n46 Note that in the Log-Lin specification, the elasticity of Y (Dependent variable) with respect to X (Regressor)\ndepends on the value of X. Here we evaluate the elasticity of Y with respect to X at the mean of mc, i.e. we multiply\nmodel (Table 6a). Finally, I include several control variables, thereby testing their impact on the\ndependent as well as interactions with regressors (Tables 6b and 6c).\nConcerning all these additional regressions, I find that the coefficients of the baseline regression\nremain almost unchanged and that none of the added covariates appears to have a significant\nimpact on German bank lending. To save space, regressions are only shown and described in\nAppendix IV.\n5.2 Results from the decomposition analysis\nTo explore the issue of lending discrepancies between IC and non-IC countries, I apply the\ndecomposition technique introduced by Oaxaca (1973). This will shed light on the question why\nNon\u00adIC countries receive significantly less foreign bank lending than IC countries. As a matter of\nfact, the mean difference between IC and Non-IC countries can be decomposed into an explained\npart (due to differences in Xs) and an unexplained part (due to differences in \u00df-coefficients) as\nshown in Section 3. Now take a closer look at Table 8 to obtain an idea of the magnitude of the\nexplained and unexplained part, respectively.\nTable 8. Decomposition of differences in mean predicted claims\nPredicted log claims Mean IC\nln_claimsIC\n- ln_claimsNIC\nExplained (weight \u00dfIC\nExplained (weight \u00dfNIC\nUnexplained (weight XNIC\nUnexplained (weight XIC\nNotes: Bootstrapped standard errors. *Significant at the 1% level.\nThe overall difference in predicted average lending (in logs) between the two groups is about 2.8.\nRegardless of the weighting scheme (\u00df=\u00dfIC\nor \u00df=\u00dfNIC\n), most of the differential in (log) mean\nloans is accounted for by differences in countries' characteristics. As can be seen, between 63 and\n76 percent of this discrepancy are due to differing characteristics, i.e. means of the explanatory\nvariables, while about 24 to 37 percent stem from differences in coefficient values which were\nestimated in separate regressions for IC and Non-IC countries. In other words, because the two\ngroups have different average levels of GDP, distance to Germany, FDI from German companies,\ncountry risk and market capitalization as percentage of GDP, the average value of claims in non-\nIC countries is lower than in IC countries.47 It is worth noting that all figures have to be\ninterpreted ceteris paribus, i.e. everything else constant, the difference in (log) lending due to the\ncharacteristics effect would be between 1.8 to 2.1, while the coefficient effect ceteris paribus\ninduces a mean difference in (log) lending between 0.7 and 1.0.48\nSince we are particularly interested in the composition of the explained and unexplained part, we\nalso perform a detailed decomposition of the average difference in bank loans.\nTable 9. Detailed decomposition of differences in mean predicted claims\nExpl. Unexpl. Expl. Unexpl.\n(weight \u00dfIC\n) (weight XNIC\n) (weight \u00dfNIC\n) (weight XIC\n)\nNotes: Bootstrapped standard errors. *Significant at the 1% level.# This figure is the sum of the individual\ntime and bank effects, respectively. Only some time and dummy variables are significant.\n47 Note that time as well as bank dummies are included but not shown. They contribute to the explained and\nunexplained part, as will be seen in the detailed decomposition further below.\n48 Since the explained and the unexplained parts are positive, their adding up increases the average difference.\nHowever, this needs not to be the case. If, on the contrary, the unexplained part would e.g. be negative, explained\nand unexplained part would balance each other out, i.e. a difference in characteristics would be compensated by a\ndifference in coefficients. See e.g. Moore and Newman (1988).\nTable 9 shows the results. Clearly, differences in GDP account for the largest fraction of the\nexplained part: The differences in GDP would, ceteris paribus, increase the gap of (log) claims\nbetween 0.85 and 0.99. With respect to another proxy for market size, mc, we only observe a low\npredicted (log) difference in claims between IC and non-IC countries of about 0.14. Additionally,\nthe fact that Non-IC countries are further away from Germany, receive less FDI and have on\naverage a lower country risk index, would ceteris paribus lead to a (log) discrepancy in bank\nscheme. Note that all estimates have been tested for their significance using bootstrap confidence\nintervals.49 For the explained part, all gaps are significant at the 1% level. To summarise: Per\ncapita GDP, FDI and country risk account for most of the observed differences in bank lending.\nBesides the explained part, the overall difference in claims is due to different \u00df-coefficients in the\nregressions for IC and Non-IC countries as well as the constant term. The second and forth\ncolumn of Table 9 show for both weighting schemes the implied gaps in average loans that\nwould, ceteris paribus, exist. Note that the constant term reflects characteristics that have not\nbeen captured by the regressors included in the model. Albeit the constant term is rather large in\nabsolute size, it is not statistically significantly different from zero. The only significant\ndifference in \u00df-coefficients concerns the country risk variable. In other words, it appears that\nbanks treat country risk in both groups not in the same way. Some caution with this interpretation\nshould be noted as country risk was not significant in the regression for IC countries and we\nomitted three countries from the Non-IC sample.50 All other coefficient effects are not\nstatistically different from zero. Thus, treatment between the two groups does not seem to be the\ndriving force for the differences in German bank lending to IC and Non-IC countries.\n49 See Efron and Tibshirani (1993) for details. The procedure can be illustrated as follows: 1000 samples of size N\nare drawn from the original data-set with replacement. For each sample, all statistics are re-estimated to derive\nstandard errors and confidence intervals. Note that three different types of confidence intervals have been computed:\nThe normal (N), the percentile (P) and the bias corrected (BC) which are similar if the bootstrap statistic is\napproximately normal. This is the case for all variables shown in Table 9. For further details see Stata7 Manual [A-\n50 The countries are Indonesia, Russia and Turkey. Hence, this is only a conclusion that can be drawn for the\ncountries in the sample.\n6 Summary and conclusion\nThis paper explores the differences in average German bank lending to industrialised and non-\nindustrial countries. This is done in two steps: First, I estimate an augmented gravity model for\nGerman bank lending including \"gravity\" factors such as GDP and distance. The augmenting\nfactors are FDI of German companies, country risk and market capitalization in percent of GDP.\nThe gravity model explains a large part of variation in German bank lending. It also provides the\nbasis for the decomposition analysis which sheds light on the lending gap between lending to IC\nand Non-IC countries. The gap is decomposed into an explained part due to countries'\nendowments and an unexplained part due to different treatment of IC and Non-IC countries by\nGerman banks.\nThe results suggest that German bank lending is to a large extent allocated according to\ncountries' fundamentals and different treatment of IC and Non-IC countries as groups appears\ncomparatively small.\nI thus conclude that IC and Non-IC countries are treated to a large extent in the same way and\nthat being allocated to one group or the other should only be a minor concern. More importantly,\nimproving country fundamentals, e.g. attracting more FDI, will lead to an increase in bank\nclaims, no matter what group a country \"belongs\" to.\nIn future research it would be interesting to test whether this result also holds for other definitions\nof country groups (e.g. sub-groups of developing countries such as Western Hemisphere,\nEmerging Europe etc.) and whether it can be sustained for a larger group of lenders, e.g. by using\ndata from the Bank for International Settlements.51\n51 Note that BIS data is aggregated on the country level. Thus while the behaviour of more countries can be analysed,\nthis comes at the cost that no information on individual banks is available.\n7 References\nAlfaro, L., S. Kalemli-Ozcan and V.

Baseline specification: Adjustment for currency fluctuation\nTable 5b reports the results for currency adjusted foreign claims. Note that the stock of claims from one year\nto another may rise or fall either due to an actual rise or fall in claims or due to a valuation effect induced by a\nchange in the exchange rate, as part of claims are denominated in Dollar and other currencies but have to be\nreported in Euro to the Bundesbank. Unfortunately, I do not know the currency composition of each claim but\nonly of the aggregate of German banks. Thus, the adjustment is only an approximation for the true change in\nclaims due to changes in exchange rates (For further details on the adjustment of claims see Nestmann et al. ,\n2004). Note that the results hardly change. The sample is slightly smaller as data on the currency composition\nis not available for Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Costa Rica and Uruguay.\nAll countries, baseline,\nadjusted for currency\nfluctuation\nIC countries, baseline,\nadjusted for currency\nfluctuation\nNon-IC countries,\nbaseline, adjusted for\ncurrency fluctuation\nNotes: Dependent variable: Logarithm of currency adjusted bank claims of bank b on county c at time t. The\nadjustment aims to correct stocks of claims for changes that are solely due to a change in the currency in which\nthe loan is denominated. The currency adjustment of claims is described in Nestmann et al. (2004). *; **; ***\nrefer to 10%, 5% and 1% level of significance. Constant not reported. Time dummies as well as bank dummies\nincluded in all regressions, but not reported. T- values -based on robust standard errors- in parentheses: For (1)\n\u00ad (3), country is set as cluster, as described in Section 3. For definition of variables see Table 1.\nTable 5c: Baseline Specification: Outliers\nIn Table 5c the gravity model is estimated allowing for different structures of the error term: In regression\n(1) an interaction between country and time is set as cluster, i.e. the variance covariance matrix allows for\nan arbitrary heteroscedasticity structure across this dimension. Note that t-values have increased\nsignificantly pointing to the Moulton problem. In column (2) we include country dummies next to time and\nbank dummies. Note that none of our variables is significant any more. This is not surprising as variables\ndo mainly vary across countries (see Table 3). Hence, including a dummy variable for each country leaves\nno more explanatory power for the regressors. The following two regressions show that country risk is\nvalued differently for three outliers, Indonesia, Russia, and Turkey. In Regression (4) we observe an\ninsignificant effect of country risk on bank lending. This surprising result is due to the impact of these\noutliers. Therefore we created a dummy variable for these three outliers (\"geo\") as well as an interaction\nterm between \"geo\" and country risk in regression (5). It turns out that country risk indeed has a positive\nand significant impact on lending to non-industrial countries in general. For the three countries of\ngeopolitical importance, however, it appears that a decrease of 1 percent of country risk even leads to a\nslight increase of 0.6 percent (2.5-3.1) in loans. This may be rationalised by the geopolitical importance of\nthese countries overcompensating a low score of country risk. It should be noted that albeit the three\ncountries obtain a significant share of all claims to non-industrial countries, our analysis remains valid for\nmost of German bank lending.\nAll countries,\nCluster\nCountry*time\nAll Countries,\nCluster Country\nwith Country\nDummies\nNon-IC Countries,\nincluding outliers\nNon-IC Countries,\nincluding outliers\nwith interaction\nterm\nNotes: Dependent variable: Logarithm of claims of bank b on county c at time t. *; **; *** refer to 10%,\n5% and 1% level of significance.

For construction of variables\nsee Table 1.\nTable 5d: Baseline Specification: Different time periods\nIn Table 5d I estimate the baseline specification for different time periods as well as aggregated over all\ntime periods. Regression (1) is performed for the period including the Asian and Russian financial crises,\nwhile regressions (2) and (3) present the estimates for the post crises period. Coefficients hardly change at\nall which again mirrors the low variability of the data across time and the large variation across countries,\nrespectively. This is further supported by regression (4) in which variables have been averaged over time\nbut coefficients remain rather stable. Obviously, the number of observations drops sharply as the sample\nkeep the time dimension for the sensitivity checks as some covariates might vary more over time than\nvariables in the baseline specification.\nAll countries,\nAll countries,\nAll countries,\nAll countries,\naggregated over\ntime\nNotes: Dependent variable: Logarithm of claims of bank b on county c at time t. *; **; *** refer to 10%,\n5% and 1% level of significance.

T- values -based on robust standard errors- in parentheses: For (1)-(4)\ncountry is set as cluster as described in Section 3. For construction of variables see Table 1.\nTable 5e. Baseline including bank size\nIn Table 5e I control for bank size next to bank dummy variables in the regression The data set consists of\nindividual bank data and banks' size might be correlated with lending behaviour. Larger banks might for\ninstance have a different portfolio structures than smaller banks. Columns (1) to (3) include the logarithm\nof banks' total assets (ln_size). It should be noted that the sample only consists of 15 banks and thus\nvariation is not as large as for a full sample of all German banks including savings and cooperative banks.\nAs neither savings nor cooperative banks are engaged to a large extend in foreign lending, they are\nexcluded. However, neither the coefficients and their significance levels nor the overall explanatory power\nof the regression change in comparison to Table 5a. As variation of banks' assets is low over time, all that\nchanges is the constant and the dummy variables for banks. As bank size does not represent a country\nspecific endowment, I do not include it in the decomposition analysis of the next section. Note that the\nresults of the decomposition analysis including bank size can be obtained from the author upon request. As\nin the regression, only the constant as well as bank dummy variables change in the decomposition analysis.\nAll countries, with bank\nsize\nIC countries, with bank\nsize\nNon-IC countries, with\nbank size\nNotes: Dependent variable: Logarithm of claims of bank b on county c at time t. *; **; *** refer to 10%,\n5% and 1% level of significance. Constant not reported. Time dummies as well as bank dummies included\nin all regressions, but not reported. In contrast to 5a, Regressions (1) to (3) include the logarithm of banks'\ntotal assets. T- values -based on robust standard errors- in parentheses: For (1) \u00ad (3) country is set as\ncluster, as described in Section 3. For construction of variables see Table 1.\nTable 6 a. Tobit Regression\nThe following regressions in Table 6a are concerned with the estimation technique applied. One problem\nthat needs to be taken into account is that banks only report claims above 1.5 million Euro. Thus, a bank\nthat does not report an exposure in fact has outstanding claims between zero and 1.5 Million Euro. This\ninformation is, however, not included in the original reports to the Bundesbank leading a priori to an\nunbalanced data-set. I therefore augment the data-set and fill in 1 where no claim is reported. In the\namount of missing values is comparatively low as we only analyse the largest German banks and most of\nthem have had exposures in almost all markets at all times considered. For IC countries, 40 exposures are\nmissing, for non-IC countries, 467 observations are needed to balance the data-set. In Tobit regression, a\nMaximum Likelihood estimation combining linear regression and a Probit analysis, I define values equal\nand below zero as censored. Table 6a shows the results of estimating regressions (1)-(3) of table 5a using\nTobit regressions. All variables keep the expected sign and remain significant in all three regressions. Note\nthat the magnitude of coefficients cannot be directly compared to the Cluster regressions in Table 5. The\ncoefficients of Tobit regressions can be interpreted in the following way: The effect of a change in the ith\nexplanatory variable on the dependent variable (ln_claims) can be divided into a) the change of those\nclaims above the limit (1.5 mn) weighted by the probability of being above the limit (1.5 mn); and b) the\nchange in the probability of being above the limit (1.5 mn), weighted by the expected value of claims\nTobit, All countries Tobit, IC countries Tobit, Non-IC countries\nNotes: Dependent variable: Logarithm of claims of bank b on county c at time t. *; **; *** refer to 10%,\n5% and 1% level of significance. Constant not reported. Time dummies as well as bank dummies included\nin all regressions, but not reported. T-values based on robust standard errors in parentheses. For\nconstruction of variables see Table 1. In regression (1)-(3): All censored observations are left-censored at\nzero.\nTable 6b. Additional covariates (1)\nIn Table 6b I first run regressions (1)-(3) including macroeconomic variables such as inflation, budget\nbalance and current account (both in percent of GDP). Note that the coefficients of the other variables\nhardly change and the interpretation is the same as in Table 5a. In the following two regressions I include\nthe prevailing exchange rate regime of country i at time t to the list of regressors. This can be rationalised\nby a preference for low exchange rate volatility outweighing the increased risk of sharp devaluations\n(Papaioannou (2005, p. 30). While column (4) includes the exchange rate classification of Reinhart and\nRogoff (2004), (5) contains the classification of Levy-Yeati and Sturzenegger (2003). In Reinhart and\nRogoff (2004), a large number is associated with more flexible exchange rate regimes, while it is the other\nway round in the classification by Levy-Yeati and Sturzenegger (2003). Note that both papers provide a\nfine and coarse classification: For Reinhard and Rogoff (2004) the fine classification contains 15 categories\nand the coarse classification 5 categories, while Levy-Yeati and Sturzenegger (2003) provide a five and a\nthree way classification. Both classifications are downloadable from the Internet. Regressions (4) and (5)\nuse the fine classification, respectively. Results for the coarse classifications are similar but not shown. For\ndefinition of the classification system see Table 1 in the Appendix. The variables for exchange rate regimes\nare neither in (4) nor in (5) significantly different from zero. Thus, either the exchange rate regime is not a\ndeterminant for German bank lending or positive and negative effects of regimes cancel each other out.\nWith Inflation With BBoGDP With CAoGDP With Ex.\nWith Ex.\nNotes: Dependent variable: Logarithm of claims of bank b on county c at time t. *; **; *** refer to 10%,\n5% and 1% level of significance. Constant not reported. Time dummies as well as bank dummies included\nin all regressions, but not reported. T- values -based on robust standard errors- in parentheses. Country is\nset as cluster as described in section 3. For definitions of variables see Table 1. In (1) and (2) outliers\n(inflation > 60% and BBoGDP>10%) are excluded.\nTable 6c. Additional covariates (2)\nIn Table 6c I include the logarithm of bilateral exports instead of FDI. Exports and FDI are highly\ncorrelated (correlation coefficient of 0.78) and can therefore not be included simultaneously. We note that\nexports are, however, not significant. Note that Buch and Lipponer (2004) find a positive and significant\nimpact of trade in their study. The result in the present study appears to stem from the negative correlation\nwith distance (-0.56) as leaving distance out of the regression turns exports significant. As exports are\nflows and not stocks such as FDI in this paper, I opt for FDI in all further specifications. The lending rate\nincluded in column (2) is not significant. This may be due to the fact that stocks of claims are analysed\nwhich depend less on interest rate differentials than flows of claims (I thank Claudia Buch for this\ncomment). Including average years of schooling, the rate of inflation as well as an indicator for the\ndisclosure requirements and another one for the toughness of banking supervisors abroad does not change\nthe picture (I thank Alexander Lipponer for providing the data on the indices for transparency and banking\nsupervision).\nAll countries,\nwith Exports\nWith Lending\nrate\nWith years of\nschooling\nWith\nTransparency\nindex\nWith Bank\nSupervision\nindex\nNotes: Dependent variable: Logarithm of claims of bank b on county c at time t. *; **; *** refer to 10%,\n5% and 1% level of significance.
