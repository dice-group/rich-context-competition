Ragland2\n1School of Public Health,\n2University of California Traffic Safety Center, and\n3Departments of Bioengineering and School of Optometry, University of California at Berkeley.\nObjectives. This report examines the role of (a) disease processes affecting vision, (b) reported troubles with vision, (c)\nphysical symptoms affecting the eyes, and (d) objective measures in reported driving limitation due to problems with\neyesight among older drivers.\nMethods. Data for this study (N \u00bc 1,840) were obtained from participants in a community-based study of aging and\nphysical performance in people age 55 or older in the city of Sonoma, California. Each of 16 visual conditions was\nassessed for impact on reported driving limitation due to eyesight by calculating a ``risk'' ratio. Then, prevalence of the\ncondition was combined with the ratio to generate an attributable risk for that condition for vision-related limitations in\ndriving.\nResults. Each condition was significantly associated with reported limitations in driving due to eyesight. ``Avoiding\nphysical activity due to vision'' (ratio \u00bc 3.4) and ``trouble seeing steps up/down stairs'' (ratio \u00bc 2.9) had the strongest\nassociation. However, ``glasses/contacts required for driving'' and ``trouble with glare from sun/lights'' had the highest\nDiscussion. The risk ratio is relevant for evaluating individuals; the attributable risk is relevant to planning\ncountermeasures in populations. Addressing specific problems related to vision should substantially reduce driving\nlimitations due to eyesight.\nAMONG older adults, increased age is associated with\nreduced and modified driving behavior (Ball, Owsley,\nStalvey, Roenker, Sloane, & Graves, 1998; Gilhotra, Mitchell,\nIvers, & Cummings, 2001; McGwin, Chapman, & Owsley,\nThere is also evidence that women are more likely to stop\nand that reductions in driving are associated with greater\ndepressive symptoms (Fonda, Wallace, & Herzog, 2001;\nProblems with vision represent one of the leading chronic\nconditions associated with reduction in or cessation of driving.\nVision difficulties have been assessed in a variety of ways that\ninclude diagnosed conditions and performance on visual tests.\nOlder drivers with cataracts and other vision difficulties are\nmore likely to restrict their own driving and to be involved in\nmotor vehicle crashes (Dellinger, Sehgal, Sleet, & Barrett-\nStalvey, Wells, & Sloane, 1999; Owsley, Stalvey, Wells,\nSloane, & McGwin, 2001). Reduced performance on standard-\nized visual assessments is also associated with a reduction in\ndriving in older adults (Ball et al., 1998; Gallo, Rebok, &\nThere is less research on self-reported vision problems or\nsymptoms associated with limitations or avoidance of driving\namong older drivers (Dellinger et al., 2001; West, Gildengorin,\nHaegerstrom-Portnoy, Lott, Schneck, & Brabyn, 2003). A\nbetter understanding of the barriers to driving associated with\nvisual deficiencies experienced by older drivers is needed. This\nwould demonstrate the extent to which a limitation or cessation\nof driving is due to a loss of confidence in the ability to drive\nand, if so, the extent to which problems with vision contribute\nto a loss of confidence. Moreover, research in this area should\ncontribute to the development of strategies to extend safe\ndriving years for older adults.\nIn a previous study of older adults in Sonoma, California,\ncurrent drivers were much more likely to identify problems\nwith eyesight as a reason for limiting their driving than any\nother medical condition (Ragland, Satariano, & MacLeod,\n2004). The current report expands on that study, examining the\nrole of (a) disease processes affecting vision, (b) reported\ntroubles with vision, (c) physical symptoms affecting the eyes,\nand (d) objective vision tests in reporting limitations to driving\nbecause of vision.\nMETHODS\nSubjects\nThe Study of Physical Performance and Age-Related\nChanges in Sonomans (SPPARCS) is a community-based\nlongitudinal study of age-related changes in physical function-\ning, physical activity, and fitness among people age 55 and\nolder that reside in and near the city of Sonoma, California. A\ncommunity-based census identified 3,057 eligible individuals,\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2004 by The Gerontological Society of America\nBased on the 1990 U.S. Census of residents in Sonoma,\n38.8% in the general population of Sonoma) and underrepre-\ndifferences existed between eligible participants and non-\nparticipants, the differences do not suggest a consistent pattern\nwith respect to functional disability and chronic illness\n(Satariano, Smith, Swanson, & Tager, 1998).\nThe study sample is also somewhat more affluent and educated\nthan the population of Sonoma residents age 55 and older.\nNevertheless, a comparison of the sample with California resi-\ndents age 55 and older indicates that the only residents who were\nunderrepresented in the sample were those with household in-\ncomes less than $10,000. Similarly, the modal income category\ncategory for the entire state. Finally, there is very little difference\namong Sonomans or Californians in the percentage of house-\nThe current analysis is based on data from the baseline\nassessment of the SPPARCS cohort. The sample was restricted\nto subjects who were current drivers who reported whether or not\nthey had personally either limited or avoided driving (N\u00bc1,840).\nDriving status was established from the participants' report of\ntheir driving behavior and driver license history. Driving status\nwas determined by the participants' answer to three separate\nquestions: (a) Have you ever had a valid driver's license? (b) Do\nyou currently have a driver's license? (c) Have you driven a car\nin the last 6 months? Participants were considered ``current''\ndrivers if they responded ``yes'' to all three questions. Current\ndrivers were distributed across three age groups: 29.4% were\nReasons for Limiting or Avoiding Driving\nParticipants also reported driving limitation for a series of 14\ncommon medical reasons (including a physician's recommen-\ndation and a family member's recommendation) and 7 common\nnonmedical reasons. Driver limitation or avoidance was asked\nin the following way: ``Do you currently limit or avoid any of\nyour driving (either before or after dark) for any of the\nfollowing reasons?'' The participant could respond by in-\ndicating ``yes,'' ``no,'' or ``don't know'' to each of 21 specific\nreasons (14 medical and 7 nonmedical; see Appendix.)\nVision Assessments, Conditions, and Symptoms\nSubjects indicated if use of corrective lenses was required for\ndriving. Visual acuity was measured using the Smith\u00ad\nKettlewell Institute Low Luminance (SKILL) Card. The score\nfrom the SKILL Card Test, which is dichotomous (i.e., within\nnormal limits, not within normal limits), is calculated based\non high-contrast and low-contrast visual acuity performance.\nThe parameters (i.e., normal, abnormal limits) are based\non conservative age norms. Scores show a linear increase for\nages older than 50. It is a particularly sensitive measure for\nreduced visual function that results from certain visual impair-\nments (e.g., optic neuritis, glaucoma, or maculopathy), some of\nwhich are age related. In older populations, the test has also\ndemonstrated a strong correspondence with driving perfor-\nmance. Also, test repeatability has proven as good as the\nstandard Snellen Acuity Test (Haegerstrom-Portnoy, Brabyn,\nSchneck, & Jampolsky, 1997; Haegerstrom-Portnoy, Schneck,\nFrom a list of 30 separate medical conditions, participants\nreported whether they had ever received a diagnosis. Vision-\nrelated diseases, cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and\nmacular degeneration were selected for this analysis. Addition-\nally, participants indicated the presence of symptoms or\nproblems within a 30-day period. Vision-related symptoms in-\ncluded watery eyes, dry eyes, and runny or itchy eyes. Vision-\nrelated problems included focusing, recognizing at distance,\nseeing up or down stair steps, seeing through glare from the sun\nor lights, reading street signs at night, experiencing constricted\nperipheral vision, and judging distances.\nAnalysis\nFor each of the 16 eyesight-related conditions (diseases,\nsymptoms, problems, and objective measures), the impact on\nreported driving limitations due to problems with eyesight was\ndetermined by calculating a risk ratio of (a) the percent re-\nporting a limitation when the condition was present to (b) the\npercent reporting a limitation when the condition was absent.\nThe significance level of this association was calculated using\na chi-square statistic.\nPrevalence of the condition was then combined with the risk\nratio to generate an attributable risk for that condition, that is, the\nimpact in the population. The population attributable risk (PAR)\nis the proportion of the outcome (in this case, driving limitations\ndue to vision) that can be attributable to the exposure (in this\ncase, specific vision-related disease, condition, or symptom).\nThis can be calculated as a percentage (PAR%) as follows:\nPAR% \u00bc (Ppop\n\u00c0 Punexp\n)/Ppop\nis the percentage of\nthose in the total population reporting limitations in driving\nbecause of vision, and Punexp\nis the percentage of those in the\n``unexposed'' group (i.e., those without the specific vision-\nrelated disease, condition, or symptom) who report limitations\nin driving because of vision. As an example, the overall per-\ncentage of those reporting limitations in driving due to vision\n(Ppop\n) is 25.4. The percentage of those reporting limitations in\ndriving due to vision that do not report cataracts (Punexp\nRESULTS\nthat they currently limit or avoid driving for one or more\nreasons. Problems with vision were the leading self-reported\nreason for driving limitation or avoidance, especially for\nwomen (Table 1). The percent of participants reporting this\nreason also increased with age for both men and women.\nApproximately 40% of the women age 75 and older cited vision\nproblems compared with about 29% of the men in the same age\ngroup. The significance of vision problems is also demonstrated\nby examining the percent of medical reasons with involvement\nof vision. For women age 75 and older, problems with vision\nconstituted nearly 84% of all medical reasons cited for\nlimitations in driving. For men, this figure was nearly 75%.\nTable 2 gives (a) the prevalence of each of the 16 vision-\nrelated conditions, (b) the percent reporting vision-related\nlimitations in driving for those with and without the condition,\n(c) the ratio of these percents, and (d) the attributable risk\ncalculated from the prevalence and the ratio. The vision-related\nconditions vary widely in prevalence, from a low of 3.4%\n(trouble with peripheral vision) to a high of 57.9% (glasses/\ncontacts required for driving).\nFor each of the 16 vision-related conditions, the risk ratios\nare all positive and statistically significant. The ratios range\nfrom a low of 1.2 (SKILL Test for visual acuity) to a high of 3.4\n(avoid physical activity due to vision).\nThe attributable risk for each of the vision-related conditions\nis a function of the prevalence of the condition as well as the\nratio. Glasses/contacts required for driving has the highest\nattributable risk (35.8%), having a moderately high ratio of\nassociation (2.0) but a very high prevalence (57.9%).\nDISCUSSION\nIn a previous study reported by this group, older drivers (age\n55\u00fe) were much more likely to identify problems with eyesight\nas a reason for limiting their driving than any other medical\ncondition (Ragland et al., 2004). In this report, we have shown\nthat specific conditions related to vision (disease processes\naffecting vision, objective vision tests, reported troubles with\nvision, and physical symptoms affecting the eye) are each\nassociated, to varying degrees, with reported limitations in\ndriving due to vision. We have calculated the impact of each of\nthe factors in two different ways: (a) as an association of each\nof the vision-related conditions to reported limitations due to\neyesight and (b) as an attributable risk. The ratio of percent\nreporting limitations among those with and without a specific\ncondition related to vision is relevant to evaluating individuals\nwith that condition; the attributable risk is relevant to planning\ncountermeasures in populations (Rose, 1985). We will discuss\nthe relevance of both measures for each of the types of vision-\nrelated conditions.\nSpecific Implications of the Findings\nFor the set of disease processes affecting vision, the ratios of\nthe association with vision-related limitations in driving were\nTable 1.

For individuals with these diseases\n(cataracts, glaucoma, and macular degeneration), the impact on\ndriving is an important consideration, and ways to mitigate this\nimpact should be developed. For example, there is evidence\nthat cataract surgery reduces crash risk associated with cataracts\n(Owsley et al., 1999). Although the degree of association is\nsimilar for the three diseases, cataracts had the highest impact in\nterms of attributable risk, as the prevalence of that condition is\nsubstantially higher than that for the other two diseases.\nBecause so few participants reported having diabetic retinop-\nathy, it was not included in this analysis.\nStandardized measures of visual capacity recorded in this\nstudy show a different pattern. The ratio of association for the\nSKILL Test is very low (1.2), showing that this measure of\nvisual acuity under light and dark conditions is not very\nrelevant for vision-related limitations of driving. Other\nstandardized measures of vision, such as the Useful Field of\nVision, although not assessed in the current study, may be more\nappropriate for assessing visual capacity for driving (Owsley et\nal., 2001). Glasses/contacts required for driving had a relatively\nhigh ratio of association (2.0). One possibility is that needing\nglasses/contacts is a marker for other vision-related problems.\nAnother possibility is that some proportion of glasses/contacts\nare not well prescribed or well suited for the complex and\nvaried visual tasks associated with driving. It may be that\nglasses/contacts could be designed to reduce vision-related\ndriving limitations. This might be an effective strategy from not\nonly an individual perspective but also a population viewpoint,\nas the prevalence and subsequently the attributable risk are high\nThe eight reported troubles with vision all had a high ratio of\nassociation with vision-related limitations in driving (ranging\nfrom 2.2 to 3.4). Most of these have specific implications with\nrespect to driving. For example, problems with focusing, depth,\nglare, peripheral vision, and nighttime vision might be correct-\nable. These same problems might be addressed by highway\ndesign through modification of signs, signals, highway markings,\nand lighting. The Federal Highway Administration has published\na Highway Design Handbook (Staplin, Lococo, Byington, &\nHarkey, 2001) that has recommendations addressing some of\nthese issues. Work is needed to extend and implement these\nrecommendations. A consideration of prevalence and subsequent\nattributable risk of these problems might be used to judge the\nrelative benefits of addressing particular troubles with vision. For\nexample, trouble with glare from sun/lights and trouble reading\nstreet signs at night have the highest attributable risk and could be\naddressed by changes in signs and lighting.\nPhysical symptoms affecting the eyes (i.e., watery eyes, dry\neyes, and runny/itchy eyes) showed very low ratios of\nassociation with vision-related limitations in driving; and even\nthough the prevalence of these symptoms was relatively high,\nthe attributable risks were also fairly low.\nGeneral Relevance of Vision to Driving\nIn general, findings support previous reports that difficulties\nwith vision are highly associated with increased age and\nmodified or avoidant driving behavior in older adults. However,\nunlike other studies, this study examined specific types of\nsymptoms and difficulties with vision in association with\nvision-related driving limitations.\nThe significance of vision to driving behavior is not\nsurprising as it has been estimated that 90% of driver in-\nformation is acquired through the visual system (Bailey &\nSheedy, 1988). Early vision (here defined to include the ocular\nmedia and the retinal transduction and processing) plays\na significant role in driving-related tasks as it interacts with\nhigher cognitive functions in crucial skills such as spatial\njudgment, timely initiation of motor responses, and attention.\nOlder adults are at risk for a variety of decreased functioning\nwithin the eye. With age, the eye changes in several ways,\nleading to several effects. The lens loses elasticity, decreasing\nthe ability to focus, and it yellows, affecting light sensitivity\nand acuity. Older adults are also more prone to difficulty with\n``light scatter'' within the eye due to either cataracts, corneal\nopacity, or vitreous defects, which cause problems with glare\n(Babizhayev, 2003). The pupil of the eye becomes smaller with\nadvanced age, losing ability to allow light in with a consequent\nreduction of both visual acuity and sensitivity. Also, many\nretinal disorders that affect acuity and peripheral vision are\nassociated with increased age (Bailey & Sheedy, 1988).\nAlthough there are a number of independent dimensions of\nvisual capacity, problems with glare and night vision are the\ntwo symptoms most likely to be associated with an older\nperson's decision to reduce or avoid driving (Theeuwes,\nAlferdinck, & Perel, 2002). It is possible to enumerate a list\nof age-related visual conditions, defects, and diseases associ-\nated with either glare or night vision deficiencies (Babizhayev,\n2003). Some of these are relatively rare, whereas others are\nmore frequently encountered.\nTo confirm these results, future studies are needed to\ninterview older drivers and former drivers about the sequence\nof events that led to a decision to reduce or avoid driving and, in\nparticular, the extent to which problems with glare and night\nvision contributed to that decision (Dellinger et al., 2001;\nassess the independent and joint effects of a variety of factors\nthat may operate in conjunction with vision, especially types and\nlevels of cognitive function, to affect driving decision making\nand performance. It may be that levels of self-efficacy or con-\nfidence in the ability to drive represent a possible pathway\nbetween visual capacity, health status, and driving behavior.\nThere is a growing body of research that suggests that self-\nefficacy is strongly associated with daily functioning in a variety\nof areas, including driving (Dobbs, 2003; Seeman, Unger,\nMcAvay, & Mendes de Leon, 1999). Although self-efficacy was\nnot assessed in the current study, future research in this area will\ncontribute to a better understanding of the effects of vision prob-\nlems on self-efficacy associated with driving in this population.\nIf these results are confirmed in such studies, clinical and\npublic health strategies to prevent or reduce the effects of these\nproblems should be considered. There is a positive societal\nbenefit that results from retaining the mobility of individuals\nof advanced age, provided that this can be done without\ncompromising their safety or the safety of others. Strategies\nrange from those taken at a societal level (e.g., headlight\nregulations that lessen glare to the oncoming driver, signage\ncharacter size and illumination at night, and licensure require-\nments) to those undertaken by individuals (e.g., decision to\nundergo cataract surgery, decision to forgo refractive surgery,\nscrupulous maintenance of vehicle windscreen clarity). Beyond\nsuch strategies, there are varieties of promising infrastructure\nimprovements under study that can become sensory extensions\nfor drivers. These include in-vehicle machine vision capabilities,\nsmart signals and signs, and infrastructure communications to\nvehicles and their drivers that complement the sensory\ncapabilities of drivers. Finally, as noted previously, it will\nbe important to determine whether changes in self-efficacy\nrepresent a possible pathway between these interventions and the\ntiming, location, and quality of driving performance in older\npopulations.\n"
