National body composition estimates have not previously been\navailable.\nOBJECTIVE: To use transformed bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) data in sex-specific, multicomponent model-derived\nprediction formulae, to estimate total body water (TBW), fat-free mass (FFM), total body fat (TBF), and percentage body fat\n(%BF) using a nationally representative sample of the US population.\nDESIGN: Anthropometric and BIA data were from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III;\n1988 \u00ad 1994). Sex-specific BIA prediction equations developed for this study were applied to the NHANES data, and mean values\nfor TBW, FFM, TBF and %BF were estimated for selected age, sex and racial-ethnic groups.\nRESULTS: Among the non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican-American participants aged 12 \u00ad 80 y examined in\nNHANES III, 15 912 had data available for weight, stature and BIA resistance measures. Males had higher mean TBW and FFM\nthan did females, regardless of age or racial-ethnic status. Mean TBW and FFM increased from the adolescent years to mid-\nadulthood and declined in older adult age groups. Females had higher mean TBF and %BF estimates than males at each age\ngroup. Mean TBF also increased with older age groups to approximately 60 y of age after which it decreased.\nCONCLUSIONS: These mean body composition estimates for TBW, FFM, TBF and %BF based upon NHANES III BIA data provide\na descriptive reference for non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans in the US population.\nKeywords: body composition; obesity; BIA; NHANES; health surveys\nIntroduction\nOverweight and obesity are increasing in the US population.1,2\nExcess adiposity is the major weight-related health concern up\nto the seventh decade of life, but an increased lifespan3\nindicates the importance of lean tissue loss and its association\nwith frailty and sarcopenia in the elderly.4,5 Fat and lean\ncomponents of the body including total body fat (TBF),\nfat-free mass (FFM), and total body water (TBW) are important\nconstituents that link obesity, aging, and chronic disease with\nsubsequent morbidity and mortality.6 \u00ad 8 There exists little\naccurate information at present on estimates of TBW, FFM,\nTBF, and percentage fat (%BF) for the US population as a\nwhole.9 \u00ad 11 Systems capable of reliably quantifying body com-\nposition under controlled conditions, such as bioelectrical\nimpedance analysis (BIA) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiom-\netry (DXA), have been introduced and subsequently validated\nover the past two decades.12,13 This technology and the\nincreasing clinical and research importance of body com-\nposition highlight the need for improved information on\npopulation estimates of TBW, FFM, TBF and %BF.\nPrior surveys and studies of body composition in the\nUS population are based largely on anthropometric data\nincluding measures of body weight, stature, skinfold thick-\n*Correspondence: SS Guo, Lifespan Health Research Center, Department\nE-mail: shumei.guo@wright.edu\nwww.nature.com/ijo\nnesses and circumferences. These provide correlates of\nfatness (ie body mass index; BMI) or approximate estimates\nof regional and total body fatness. These data for the US\npopulation collected over the past 30 y have a limited\nability to quantify body composition. The report of the\n1994 NIH-sponsored Technology Assessment Conference,\n`Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis in Body Composition\nMeasurement',14 recommended that national reference\ndistributions for body composition be developed using BIA\ndata from the Third National Health and Nutrition Exam-\nination Survey.15 BIA systems are calibrated for the popula-\ntion under study by developing prediction formulae based\non criterion methods from resistance, stature and other\neasily acquired variables.16 \u00ad 20 Most of these predictive equa-\ntions are based on limited samples and two-component\nmodels that describe fat and FFM only.21 To use the\nNHANES III BIA data to estimate national body composition\ndistributions, a set of externally derived BIA prediction\nequations were developed using isotope dilution to predict\nTBW and a multicomponent model to predict FFM.22\nThese equations provided estimates for the major body\ncompartments when applied to the NHANES III data for\nnon-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican-\nAmericans aged 12 \u00ad 80 y. This report fulfills the recommen-\nof cross-sectional estimates for mean TBW, FFM, TBF and\n%BF by sex and age for these three racial-ethnic groups in the\nUS population.\nMethods\nSample\nThe NHANES III was a nationally representative, two-phase,\nThe complex sampling plan used a stratified, multistage,\nprobability cluster design. The initial sampling of house-\nholds, identification of participants, and the collection of\ndata in mobile examination centers in NHANES III were\nsimilar to that in previous NHANES.15 An individual's\nracial-ethnic status was self-identified.\nThe total NHANES III sample consisted of 31 311 exami-\nned participants. Children younger than 12 y of age and\npregnant women were not eligible for the BIA procedure in\nNHANES III. There were also very few participants over 80 y\nor > 80 y, 798 participants with race-ethnicity other than\nnon-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black or Mexican\nAmerican and 2039 participants missing weight, stature\nand=or BIA resistance, the available analytic sample con-\ntained 15 912 participants. The developed BIA prediction\nequations22 were applied to this sub-sample, but additional\nexclusions were made when predicted TBW exceeded 80% of\nbody weight (n \u00bc 1), or when the calculated TBF was\nnegative (n \u00bc 8). These last exclusions resulted in a final\nHispanic black males, 2606 non-Hispanic black females,\nfemales, for development of the body composition distribu-\ntion data.\nMeasurements\nDocumentation for the NHANES III procedures includes\nwritten descriptions15 and a video demonstration.23 Body\nweight was measured with an electronic load cell scale to the\nnearest 0.01 kg. Participants wore only under-shorts and\ndisposable paper shirts, pants and foam slippers but no\nadjustment was made for this minimal clothing weight\n(0.18 kg) in the analyses. Stature was measured to the nearest\n0.1 cm using a fixed stadiometer. Participants were posi-\ntioned with heels, buttocks, back and head against the\nupright surface of the stadiometer with the head positioned\nin the Frankfort horizontal plane.\nParticipants had a single, tetrapolar BIA measurement of\nresistance (Res) and reactance at 50 kHz taken between the\nright wrist and ankle while in a supine position, using\nValhalla 1990B Bio-Resistance Body Composition Analyzer\n(Valhalla Scientific, San Diego, CA, USA).24 the decision\nregarding the selection of the impedance analyzer was\nmade ca 1986. The reactance values were not used in the\nbody composition prediction equations22 and, therefore,\nare not presented or discussed further. The measure-\nment accuracy of the Valhalla impedance machines used\nin NHANES III was independently certified by the\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology following\nthe survey.\nBody composition calculations\nConversion of NHANES III BIA values. The TBW and FFM\nprediction equations22 used Res data from RJL bioelectrical\nimpedance analyzers (RJL, Clinton Twp, MI, USA). The\nNHANES III BIA data were obtained with a Valhalla impe-\ndance analyzer. However, all BIA resistance data reported\nin this manuscript are converted RJL Res values because\nthere are no prediction equations from large-scale studies\nusing Valhalla bioimpedance instruments. Before applying\nthe TBW and FFM prediction equations to these data,\nthe Valhalla Res value for each NHANES III subject\nwas converted to an equivalent RJL Res value using equa-\ntions developed from a separate, independent sample.\nDetails of this conversion process are presented in the\nAppendix.\nPrediction equations. The TBW and FFM, BIA prediction\nequations listed below22 were applied to the respective\nNHANES III anthropometric and converted BIA resistance\ndata for each selected NHANES III participant to derive\nestimates for TBW and FFM. The converted NHANES III,\nRJL resistance values were used to calculated the impedance\nBody composition estimates from NHANES III\nWC Chumlea et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nindex of stature squared divided by resistance (S2=Res) in the\nTBW and FFM prediction equations.\nEstimates for TBF and %BF for each NHANES III participant\nwere derived from their corresponding estimated FFM using\nthe equations TBF \u00bc weight 7 FFM and %BF \u00bc TBF=weight.\nStatistical methods\nDescriptive statistics including means, standard deviations\nand standard errors for estimates of TBW, FFM, TBF and %BF\nwere calculated for defined age, sex and racial-ethnic groups.\nThe age groups were defined at 2 y intervals from 12 to 20 y\nof age and at 10 y intervals thereafter. These means were also\npresented graphically with the values plotted at the middle\nof each age group. The mean values for TBW, FFM, TBF and\n%BF were estimated using SAS25 and include the appropriate\nsurvey sampling weights to produce representative estimates\nfor selected groups in the civilian, non-institutionalized\npopulation of the US. The sample weights account for\nsampling variability and adjust the data for differential\nprobability of selection of persons in the NHANES III com-\nplex sample survey design.\nVariance estimation. The means presented in this report\nare based on data collected from a complex sample design,\nand techniques that account for this design were used to\nestimate the standard errors of these means (ie the square\nroot of their variance). Variance estimates based on the\ncomplex sample design are different from and generally\nlarger than those obtained under the assumption of simple\nrandom sampling. SUDAAN, a statistical software package\nthat incorporates the sample weights and accounts for the\ncomplex sample design through Taylor Series linearization\nwas used to estimate the design effects.26 Details of the\nvariance estimation process are found in the Appendix.\nResults\nTests of statistical significance were not performed because\nthe results for several of the variables are calculated esti-\nmates, and the objective of this paper was to present descrip-\ntive information only. A qualitative review of these findings\nsuggests that differences among the groups conform to\nfindings from other large and small-scale studies. Means for\nweight, stature, BMI, Res and S2=Res are shown in Tables 1 \u00ad 3.\nEstimated means for TBW, FFM, TBF, and %BF are shown in\nTables 4 \u00ad 7 and Figures 1 \u00ad 4, and they are summarized in the\nfollowing text.\nAnthropometry and BIA\nThe number of participants in NHANES III available to\nconstruct the body composition distributions by age, sex\nand racial-ethnic groups are presented in Tables 1 \u00ad 3 along\nwith descriptive statistics for the measured and calculated\nindependent variables. As expected, across racial-ethnic\ngroups at ages ! 14 y, mean statures and weights were\nlarger for males than females. Within each race-ethnic\ngroup for males and females, mean weights and BMIs\nincreased almost consistently up to age 60 y and decreased\nafterwards. The BMI means were larger among non-Hispanic\nblack and Mexican-American females than non-Hispanic\nwhite females at almost all ages, but especially in the\nadults. Non-Hispanic black adult females had the largest\nmean BMI values. Among the adult males, the BMI means\nwere approximately equal to most ages.\nThe females had larger mean estimates for Res than the\nmales. Means estimates for S2=Res were larger for males than\nthe females at all ages. This is consistent with an expected\ngreater fluid volume associated with a greater FFM among\nmales.\nThe Res means for non-Hispanic white females exceeded\nthose of non-Hispanic black females at all but one age group.\nThe non-Hispanic white females also had larger Res means\nthan the Mexican-American females at all but two of the\nyounger age groups. There was no consistent pattern\nbetween the non-Hispanic black and Mexican-American\nfemales in Res means as they varied by age groups. However,\nmean estimates for S2=Res for non-Hispanic black females\nwere consistently larger than those of non-Hispanic white\nfemales at all but one age group, and both these groups of\nfemales had mean estimates larger than those of Mexican-\nAmerican females at all age groups.\nThe non-Hispanic black males had larger Res means than\nthe non-Hispanic white males at all ages, but Res means\nvaried between the non-Hispanic black and Mexican-\nAmerican males by age groups. This variation by age\ngroups also existed for mean Res values between the\nnon-Hispanic white and Mexican-American males. Mean\nestimates for S2=Res for non-Hispanic white males were\nconsistently larger than those of non-Hispanic black males\nat all but one age group, and both these groups of males had\nlarger mean estimates than those of Mexican-American\nmales at all age groups.\nComparative distributions of body compartments\nTotal body water and fat-free mass. As shown in Tables 4\nand 5 and Figures 1 and 2, the means for TBW and FFM\nwithin racial-ethnic groups had similar patterns across age\ngroups. Among males, the estimated TBW and FFM means\nBody composition estimates from NHANES III\nWC Chumlea et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nincreased during adolescence in all racial-ethnic groups. A\nprogressive, but lesser increase in the adult male age groups\nfollowed until about age 60 y, after which the estimated\nmeans for TBW and FFM decreased. Females in all racial-\nethnic groups had comparatively lower estimates for mean\nTBW and FFM than males. Among females, the increase from\n13 to 19 y of age was not as pronounced as it was in males.\nEstimated means for TBW and FFM for females gradually\nincreased across age groups until age 45 \u00ad 55 y after which\nthey decreased for both.\nAmong males, estimated TBW and FFM means were gene-\nrally larger for non-Hispanic whites than non-Hispanic\nTable 1 Selected anthropometric and impedance measures according to age and sex for non-Hispanic white people: NHANES III\n(Res and S2=Res computed with RJL-Valhalla conversion factor)\nNon-Hispanic white males Non-Hispanic white females\nAge groups Measurements n Mean s.d. s.e. n Mean s.d. s.e.\nBody composition estimates from NHANES III\nWC Chumlea et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nblacks and then Mexican-Americans (Figures 1 and 2).

The TBW and FFM means for non-\nHispanic black males declined at an earlier age compared\nwith the means for non-Hispanic white and Mexican-\nAmerican males (Figures 1 and 2).\nThe standard deviations at all the age groups for TBW were\n$6 \u00ad 7 l for non-Hispanic white and Mexican-American males\nand $7 \u00ad 8 l for non-Hispanic black males. For the females,\nTable 2 Selected anthropometric and impedance measures according to age and sex for non-Hispanic black people: NHANES III\n(Res and S2=Res computed with RJL-Valhalla conversion factor)\nNon-Hispanic black males Non-Hispanic black females\nAge groups Measurements n Mean s.d. s.e. n Mean s.d. s.e.\nBody composition estimates from NHANES III\nWC Chumlea et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nthe standard deviations were $4 \u00ad 5 l for non-Hispanic white\nand Mexican-American females and $5 \u00ad 6 l for non-\nHispanic black females. This same pattern of larger standard\ndeviations in non-Hispanic blacks also occurred for FFM, but\nhere the standard deviations for non-Hispanic whites were\nlarger than those of the Mexican-Americans. The standard\ndeviations at all the age groups for FFM were $9 \u00ad 10 kg for\nnon-Hispanic white males, $8 \u00ad 9 kg for Mexican-American\nmales and $9 \u00ad 11 kg for non-Hispanic black males.

As presented in\nTables 6 and 7 and Figures 3 and 4, females had larger\nestimated TBF and %BF means than males at all ages.\nAcross racial-ethnic groups, TBF means for males did not\nshown any appreciable differences. In contrast, estimates for\nTBF means were largest for non-Hispanic black females,\nfollowed by Mexican-American and then non-Hispanic\nwhite females. Plots of these TBF means by sex, race and\nthe selected age groups are presented in Figure 3. Between 13\nand 19 y of age, Mexican-American males tended to have\nlarger TBF means than non-Hispanic white and black males,\nafter which these differences were small except for 25 y of age.\nTable 4 Total body water (l) according to age, sex and ethnicity: NHANES III\nNon-Hispanic white Non-Hispanic black Mexican-American\nAge (y) Mean s.d. s.e.

At the same time, Mexican-American females also had\nlarger TBF means than non-Hispanic white females at most\nages. In the plots for all age groups, mean TBF increased\nconsistently for all males and females with each older age\ncategory until about 55 \u00ad 65 y of age. Afterwards, there was a\nconsistent decline in TBF means in both sexes.\nEstimates for mean %BF were slightly larger for Mexican-\nAmerican males than for non-Hispanic white or non-\nHispanic black males where estimates for mean %BF were\nTable 6 Total body fat (kg) according to age, sex and ethnicity: NHANES III\nNon-Hispanic white Non-Hispanic black Mexican-American\nAge (y) Mean s.d. s.e.

However, estimated %BF\nmeans were noticeably similar across adult ages for non-\nHispanic black and Mexican-American females. Non-Hispa-\nnic whites had the lowest estimated %BF means at all ages.\nPlots of these %BF means by sex, race and the selected age\ngroups are presented in Figure 4. The %BF means reflect to\nsome degree the sex, ethnic and age patterns for TBF.\nThese sex differences were greatest for non-Hispanic blacks\nthen Mexican-Americans and non-Hispanic whites. At the\n25 y age category, the mean %BF for males was about\n13 y age group, girls were on average as fat as males would\never get.\nBetween 13 and 19 y of age, Mexican-American males had\nlarger %BF means than non-Hispanic white and black males\nat all ages. At most other ages, there were small differences\nbetween non-Hispanic black and white males in %BF means.\nBetween 13 and 19 y of age, Mexican-American females had\nlarger %BF means than non-Hispanic black and white\nfemales and non-Hispanic black females had larger means\nthan non-Hispanic white females. After the 19 y age group,\nthere were small differences in %BF means between\nMexican-American and non-Hispanic black females, both\nof which were larger than the %BF means for non-Hispanic\nwhite females. For all race groups, mean %BF increases with\neach older age category until about 55 \u00ad 65 y of age. After-\nwards, %BF means declined, but this decline was not as steep\nas it was for TBF means at the same ages. The exception was\nfor males between 13 and 19 y where %BF means decreased\nand then increased for Mexican-Americans or remained\napproximately stable for non-Hispanic white and black\nmales. Between the 13 and 55 y age groups, mean %BF for\nmales increased about 5 \u00ad 7 percentage points, while in\nfemales the corresponding increase was about 11 \u00ad 13\npercentage points.\nFigure 1 Estimated means for total body water (TBW) by 2 y age\nnon-Hispanic white (W), non-Hispanic black (B) and Mexican-American\n(M) males and females.\nFigure 2 Estimated means for fat-free mass (FFM) by 2 y age groups\nwhite (W), non-Hispanic black (B) and Mexican-American (M) males and\nfemales.\nBody composition estimates from NHANES III\nWC Chumlea et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nStandard deviations for TBF were $6 \u00ad 8 kg for non-\nHispanic white males, $5 \u00ad 6 kg for Mexican-American\nmales and $7 \u00ad 9 kg for non-Hispanic black males. For the\nfemales, the standard deviations were $8 \u00ad 11 kg for non-\nHispanic white females, $8 \u00ad 10 kg for Mexican-American\nfemales and $10 \u00ad 14 kg for non-Hispanic black females.\nThis same pattern of larger standard deviations in non-\nHispanic blacks again occurred for %BF, but here the\nstandard deviations for non-Hispanic whites were larger\nthan those of the Mexican-Americans. The standard\ndeviations at all the age groups for %BF were $5 \u00ad 7% for\nnon-Hispanic white males, $5 \u00ad 6% for Mexican-American\nmales and $6 \u00ad 7% for non-Hispanic black males. For the\nfemales, the standard deviations were $7 \u00ad 8% for non-\nHispanic white females $5 \u00ad 7% for Mexican-American\nfemales and $7 \u00ad 8% for non-Hispanic black females.\nDiscussion\nThe application of the selected equations22 to the NHANES\nIII BIA data presents for the first time estimates of national\ndistributions for TBW, FFM, TBF and %BF for non-Hispanic\nwhites and blacks and Mexican-Americans from 12 to 80 y of\nage. The selected equations are the most accurate and precise\navailable for predicting TBW and FFM, and they are reason-\nably generalizable for individuals with body composition\nvalues at the extremes of the distribution.22\nThe patterns of the means for TBW, FFM, TBF and %BF\nacross the age groups reflect expected associations with age\nand sex. These patterns with age demonstrate sex differences\nin the growth of these body constituents or the changes that\noccur during adulthood with the aging process. The large\nmeans for TBF and %BF reflect the high prevalence of obesity\nthat has been reported previously using the NHANES III BMI\nFigure 3 Estimated means for total body fat (TBF) by 2 y age groups\nwhite (W), non-Hispanic black (B) and Mexican-American (M) males and\nfemales.\nFigure 4 Estimated means for percentage body fat (%BF) by 2 y age\nHispanic white (W), non-Hispanic black (B) and Mexican-American (M)\nmales and females.\nBody composition estimates from NHANES III\nWC Chumlea et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\nBody composition distributions\nSimilar to other reports, males in this study generally have a\nlarger estimated mean TBW and FFM than females, who have\nlarger estimated TBF and %BF means than males.27,28 The\nestimated means values from ages 12 \u00ad 20 y demonstrate the\nsex and age relationships with body composition that occur\nduring adolescent growth.29 Mean TBF increases during\nadolescence, but the effects of the relatively greater accretion\nof FFM in males than females result in a decline in estimated\nmean %BF for males around 14 \u00ad 16 y of age. Mean TBF\nincreases through adulthood. There is also an increase in\nmean FFM through much of adulthood but a decline is\nobserved at the oldest age groups.30 These are not serial\ndata, so the contrast between means at adjacent age groups\nmay reflect actual trends in the changes in these body\ncomposition estimates or, alternatively, differences between\nthe samples comprising the several age groups.\nOverall, the racial-ethnic differences between non-\nHispanic white and non-Hispanic black females conform to\npreviously reported differences for smaller samples. Non-\nHispanic black females had slightly larger mean values for\nTBW, FFM, TBF and=or %BF than non-Hispanic white\ntended to under-estimate TBW and FFM in non-Hispanic\nblacks.22 Similar comparisons with Mexican-American\nfemales are very limited.28,34 Reported ethnic differences in\nbody composition between non-Hispanic white and non-\nHispanic black adult males differ from the present findings.\nOthers report that non-Hispanic black males have larger\namounts of TBW than non-Hispanic white males.31,35\nSimilar differences in FFM or its equivalent between non-\nHispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks have been reported\nby Ellis,28,34 but several other investigators have not found\nsuch differences to be statistically significant.9,36 Comparisons\nwith Mexican-American males have been few.28,34 Except for\npossible differences in bone mineral, racial-ethnic differ-\nences in these means for TBW, FFM, and TBF at an age or\nacross age are not clear at a population level. A reason for this\nlack of clarity is insufficient body composition data from any\nracial-ethnic group other than non-Hispanic whites.\nThe present body composition estimates were derived\nfrom prediction equations, and they are subject to estima-\ntion errors. Comparisons of these findings across racial-\nethnic groups should be judged accordingly. The standard\ndeviations for the means for TBW, FFM, TBF and %BF\napproximate the normal range for these variables in the\npopulation. This range is reasonably constant from one age\ngroup to the next within racial-ethnic groups. However, the\nstandard deviations reported are calculated for estimated not\nmeasured values and therefore may underestimate the true\nvariability in the data.\nBody composition changes in the population\nOneobservation from thesemeandistributions isthe high level\nof %BF among non-Hispanic black and Mexican-American\nfemales compared with non-Hispanic white females. The\nTBF and %BF means from NHANES III data are consistent\nwith the previously reported high prevalence of overweight1,2\nand shifts in the BMI distribution observed between NHANES\nII and NHANES III.38 However, it is not appropriate to deter-\nmine the prevalence of obesity from these mean estimates for\nTBF and %BF in the absence of definite cut-off criteria.37\nThese mean reference values are not an indication of an\nideal or desirable level of FFM, TBW, TBF or %BF, and should\nbe used cautiously as comparative reference data. The mean\ncurrently exceeds the recommended BMI threshold for\nhealthy weight (BMI < 25.0).39 Similarly, the mean %BF for\nadult men and women exceeds the threshold of %BF values\nthat indicate obesity at a BMI > 30.0 in men (%BF > 25%)\nnon-Hispanic white and black men, at age 30 \u00ad 39 y in\nMexican-American men and at age 40 \u00ad 49 y in non-Hispanic\nblack and Mexican-American women. The highest mean\nestimate for %BF in non-Hispanic white women was 37.3%\nOne new aspect of these data is the availability of TBW\nmeans. Prior to the present investigation, only small sets of\nTBW reference data were available31 and most of these\ndatabases have limited application to the general US popula-\ntion. These TBW means provide a general reference for the\nUS population by sex, age and race-ethnicity at the time the\nThe FFM means provide a limited reference to assist in\ndetermining the degree of sarcopenia or muscle loss among\nthe elderly.10 Low muscle mass is a major contributor to the\nloss of functional ability and health.40 One limitation in\ndefining or in establishing a diagnosis of sarcopenia has been\nthe absence of a sex-, age- and racial-ethnic-specific FFM\nreference.10 The present findings provide national estimates\nas a reference to compare with results from other studies of\nbody composition, particularly FFM, in the elderly and\npersons with weight-related chronic disease.\nStudy limitations\nThese reported body composition estimates are not based\non criterion measures. The mean estimates were calculated\nfrom predicted values from the bioelectrical impedance Res\nvalues and stature in NHANES III. The Valhalla Res values\nwere translated into their RJL equivalents (see Appendix),\nand then TBW and FFM were predicted through regression\nequations. In the conversion sample, there was a very small\nconsistent difference between RJL and Valhalla Res mea-\nsures of 2.5 ohms for males and 9.6 ohms for females\n(Appendix, Figure 1). The high r2 values for these conver-\nsions are identical to previously reported correlations for\nRes between Valhalla and RJL impedance analyzers.44\nOthers have reported larger systematic differences between\nValhalla and RJL analyzers for Res values45 than were noted\nin the present conversions. However, the present systematic\nBody composition estimates from NHANES III\nWC Chumlea et al\nInternational Journal of Obesity\ndifferences in Res between Valhalla and RJL impedance\nanalyzers for males and females are less than the reported\nvariation in repeated measures of Res using a single impe-\nIn the prediction equations, TBW was estimated from\nisotope dilution, and FFM was estimated with a multi-\ncompartment model based on densitometry, TBW and\nbone mineral content from dual-energy X-ray absorptiome-\ntry using pooled data from large convenience samples from\nmultiple study centers.22 TBF and %BF were then estimated\nfrom FFM and weight. In each of these steps, validity errors\ncan be potentially introduced.\nThe reported mean body composition values are estimates\nabout which there is variation as a function of the several\nmethods and samples used. The magnitude of this variation\nis difficult to quantify, but is assumed to be equivalent to the\npure errors from the cross validation of the prediction\nequations.22 Pure errors for the TBW and FFM equations are\n$4 l or kg for males and $3 l or kg for females. Cross-\nvalidation results indicated that the equations applied in\nthis study slightly over-predict TBW by $0.7 and 0.6 l and\nFFM by $0.3 and 0.6 kg for males and females, respectively.\nThe equations used to predict TBW tend to underestimate\nTBW in black males ($2 l) and females ($1.4 l) and over-\nestimate TBW in white males ($0.5 l) and females ($0.3 l).\nThe FFM equations tend to underestimate FFM in black\nmales ($2.1 kg) and females ($1.6 kg) and overestimate\nFFM in white males ($0.4 kg) and females ($0.3 kg). These\nestimates may be acceptable for comparisons within racial-\nethnic groups, but should be used cautiously in comparisons\nacross racial-ethnic groups.\nThere are other possible limitations. BIA prediction equa-\ntions have limitations similar to those of skinfold prediction\nequations including large standard errors of the estimates\nand population specificity.41 The BIA prediction equations\nwere applied to Mexican-American participants in NHANES\nIII but were neither derived nor validated independently on\nsamples of Mexican-Americans so the validity of these equa-\ntions for this group is unknown. There were also a few non-\nHispanic blacks available in the samples used to develop the\nprediction equations resulting in potential bias for estimates\namong this group. Also, the performance of the prediction\nequations when applied to the NHANES III data could not be\nindependently verified.\nConclusion\nThese mean body composition estimates (Tables 4 \u00ad 7 and\nFigures 1 \u00ad 4) are the first provided for the US population.\nNHANES III did not have criterion body composition mea-\nsures, but the availability of 50 kHz BIA data allowed the\nestimation of TBW, FFM, TBF and %BF using externally\nderived equations based on isotope dilution for TBW and\nmulticomponent models for FFM. These prediction equa-\ntions for TBW and FFM22 can be applied to other population\ngroups in the US, and the calculated TBW, FFM, TBF or %BF\nvalues compared with the mean estimates presented in this\nreport.\nThe findings in this report conform to the many existing\nrelationships of body composition with age and sex. What is\nnew, is the availability of these mean estimates for TBW,\nFFM, TBF and %BF along with their corresponding distribu-\ntions at specific age categories and the availability of these\ndata for the three racial-ethnic groups in the NHANES III.\nThese means and standard deviations provide a picture of\nspecific aspects of body composition that could only be\ninferred from the NHANES III BMI data. The newest informa-\ntion from the present analysis is the estimates for mean TBW,\nFFM, TBF and %BF for Mexican-American males and females.\nThese limited data have not been available in the past.\nMeasured values for TBW, FFM, TBF and %BF determined\nby DXA, hydrostatic weighing, or data collected using other\nreference body composition methods in other studies can be\ncompared with the means reported for the NHANES III\nsample. Systematic differences among body composition\nmethods and the between-method limits of agreement are\nshould be considered when interpreting the data or making\ninferences.\nThis study presents descriptive summary distributions for\nNHANES III. In the future, improved estimates of FFM and\nTBF may become available. The present descriptive data\nshould be regarded as interim results and should be applied\nand referenced with an awareness of the identified potential\ncaveats.\n"
