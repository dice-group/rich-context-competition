Today's environment, however, is very different from our ancestral past. Instead\nof the savannah, we now have concrete buildings and roads. This has produced a mismatch\nbetween our adaptive traits and today's environment \u00ad which can be detrimental to human\nhealth and well-being. For instance, food was not always a plentiful resource as it is for\nmost humans of today, thus hunter-gatherers were not guaranteed to eat every day. Because\nof this, hunger for calorically rich foods that were high in protein and fat was positively\nselected (Eaton et al., 2002). We still see these food preferences today, but now the\nenvironment has changed. Although we still crave calorically rich foods, most humans can\nEvolution in the office\nacquire food multiple times a day, and acquiring food is not as active of a process as it was\nfor our ancestors (i.e., hunting and gathering). Thus we see increasing rates of obesity and\nweight-related disorders such as diabetes and heart disease (Cordain et al., 2005) because\ntoday's environment is not matched with our evolutionarily adapted behaviors.\nThis phenomenon, known as the mismatch hypothesis (Eaton et al., 2002), may also\naccount for decreasing employee health, well-being, and productivity in the workplace.\nMany workplace environments provide a mismatch with our evolutionary past (Nicholson,\n2000), but research has found positive physical and psychological outcomes for employees\nwhen factors from our evolutionary past are incorporated into the workplace. In fact, some\nhave argued that our ancestors' evolution in the savannah may have also produced biophilia\n\u00ad an appreciation and longing for our natural environment (Wilson, 1984; see also Hinds\nand Sparks, 2011). Implementing facets of our natural environment, such as sunlight\npsychological benefits in the workplace. Other factors that may be related to our ancestral\npast such as social interactions (Repetti, 1993) and physical movement (Lechner, deVries,\nAdriaansen and Drabbels, 1997) also produce beneficial effects for employees.\nWhile these environmental elements are largely controllable in individual homes\nand personal spaces, people typically have little or no control over this in the workplace.\nFurthermore, the physical design of modern office spaces is developed and engineered\nprimarily by architects, interior designers, and facility managers, rather than psychologists\n(Stegmeier, 2008). Therefore, we have provided a four-part framework for redesigning the\nmodern workplace based on evolutionary psychological principles and empirical research:\n1) Our ancestral environment has shaped us to be most healthy, content, and efficient when\nspecific conditions are met \u00ad such as the presentation of sunlight and greenery, as well as\nthe availability of social interaction, exercise, and sleep. 2) Many workplace settings do not\nprovide these conditions. 3) Research has provided empirically tested ways that these\nconditions could be met in modern workplaces. 4) If employers are willing to adopt an\nevolutionary psychological approach to organizing their workplaces, they may drastically\nimprove their workers' physical and psychological health as well as their productivity.\nSunlight\nThe importance of sunlight has been well documented throughout several years of\nresearch (Holick, 2004; Ne'Eman, 1974). The human body produces Vitamin D \u00ad a vitamin\nthat is essential to human life (Beadle, 1977) \u00ad via the absorption of UVB rays from natural\nsunlight (Holick, 2004). Vitamin D has been shown to elevate mood and decrease\ndepression (Lansdowne and Provost, 1998), as well as help prevent many forms of cancer,\nType I Diabetes, heart disease, and osteoporosis (Holick, 2004). Although Vitamin D can\nbe ingested orally through certain foods (e.g., certain fish, milk) and nutritional\nsupplements, it is not usually sufficient if sunlight is limited (Glerup et al., 2000).\nMany individuals spend most of their days indoors at work with limited exposure to\nsunlight. Also, organizations have begun to rely almost solely on thermal comfort in\nbuildings (Ne'Eman, 1974). Recent work has also noted that the popular full-spectrum\nfluorescent lighting \u00ad argued to help mimic sunlight and increase mood, health, and\nEvolution in the office\ncognition in employees who work under these bulbs \u00ad does not have any positive effects\nsimilar to that of natural sunlight (Vietsch and McColl, 2001).\nEmployees strongly desire to have windows in their offices (Nagy, Yasunaga, and\nKose, 1995), and the presence of windows has been found to decrease employee discomfort\n(Aries, Veitch, and Newsham, 2010). Sunlight penetration into office workplaces also\nincreases feelings of relaxation in those who are sitting in the sunlight (Boubekri, Hull, and\nBoyer, 1991). Sunlight exposure through workplace windows has been found to be\npositively correlated with worker job satisfaction and their general well-being on the job, as\nwell as negatively correlated with their intentions to quit (Leather, Pyrgas, Beal, and\nExposure to Greenery\nRecent work using fMRI technology has found a link between increased amygdala\nactivity and urban living (Lederbogen et al., 2011). When compared to participants from\nrural environments, participants who currently lived in a city exhibited greater activation of\nthe amygdala \u00ad an area of the brain associated with anger, aggressive behavior, and\nperceiving environmental threat \u00ad when experiencing social stress. Participants who grew\nup in an urban environment (but moved away by age 15) exhibited greater activation of the\nperigenual anterior cingulated cortex \u00ad an area of the brain associated with processing and\nregulating chronic social stressors. The authors conclude that living in urban areas is\nassociated with increased neural stress responses and may help explain why certain\npsychological disorders, such as schizophrenia, are more prevalent among urban dwellers\nUtilizing images of greenery \u00ad including woods, potted plants and some frames\nwhich depict natural scenery \u00ad may be able to combat the stress experienced from urban\nsettings as it has been found to produce many physical and psychological benefits. It\nincreases one's ability to concentrate and maintain attention (Berto, 2005), as well as\ndecreases diastolic blood pressure, stress, and anxiety (Hartig, Evans, Jamner, Davis, and\ndepression and anxiety to a greater degree than jogging through urban environments (Bodin\nand Hartig, 2003). Walking through parks also improves cognitive functioning in the form\nof directed attention (Berman et al., 2008). In addition, viewing images of natural settings\nand sitting in a room with indoor plants increases prosocial behaviors (Weinstein,\nCurrent workplaces are designed to focus on efficiency rather than psychological\nwelfare (Bain and Taylor, 2000; Handy, 1990). However, with a growing body of literature\nshowing the relationship between the image of the workplace and employees'\npsychological well-being, some organizations are implementing natural images such as\npotted plants and images of outdoor settings into the workplace \u00ad with beneficial physical\nand psychological effects (Bringslimark, Harting, and Patil, 2007). Natural images can also\nbe implemented by providing a rotating set of images on computer desktop backgrounds.\nPeople seek wilderness areas and urban parks for scenery and contact with nature\n(Hartig et al., 2003). Those unable to spend time outdoors often fill their indoor\nEvolution in the office\nenvironments with symbols related to nature (e.g., plants, photos of nature; Weinstein et al.,\n2009). Plants in the workplace increase employee well-being, psychological comfort, job\nsatisfaction, physical health and comfort, creativity, and productivity (Knight and Haslam,\nThere are also direct chemical benefits that improve quality of life and\npsychological benefits that promote relaxation. Plants improve air quality by filtering the\nair, reducing indoor air pollution from chemicals such as carbon dioxide, formaldehyde,\nand ammonia \u00ad indicating that the presence of indoor plants are beneficial for one's\nphysical health (Dingle et al., 2000), and crucial in preventing Sick Building Syndrome \u00ad\nan illness that is characterized by the following symptoms: headaches, eye irritation, sore\nthroat, exhaustion, lack of concentration, nausea, dizziness, and chest pains (Finnegan,\nPickering, and Burge, 1984). Sick Building Syndrome is caused by lack of ventilation in\nthe workplace, which leads to a large concentration of contaminants in the air, such as dust\nand other microorganisms (Stolwijk, 1991).\nSleeping\nThe demands of a strict work schedule often infringe upon regular sleep, though\nthere have also been numerous psychological benefits linked to sleep, including insight\nformation, novel-language perception, visual discrimination, and motor skills (Ellenbogen,\n2005). Poor quality of sleep is also associated with an increased risk of injury at work\n(Melamed and Oksenberg, 2002), depression (Buela-Casal, Mir\u00f3, Ia\u00f1ez, and Catena, 2007),\nand poor quality of life (Ancoli-Israel and Roth, 1999). In fact, working overtime has been\nrelated to physical and psychological complaints (Nishikitani, Nakao, Karita, Nomura, and\naccident and injury rates than any other type of shift worker (Dinges, 1995).\nThe effects of missing sleep can adversely affect one's reaction time, judgment,\nshort-term memory, motivation, and physical state. Napping, however, alleviates sleepiness\nwhile improving logical reasoning, alertness, and reaction time even after nights of\nrestricted sleep (Brooks and Lack, 2006; Milner and Cote, 2009). Napping is more\nbeneficial to performance in motor tasks and verbal learning than caffeine, which is the\nusual way many individuals deal with afternoon sleepiness (Mednick, Cai, Kanady, and\nDrummond, 2008). Napping can increase the amount of tasks completed during the day and\nstrengthen information processing.\nAfternoon sleepiness is common across the lifespan and different cultures. This\nphenomenon occurs regardless of food intake or quality of sleep the night before, which\nindicates that sleepiness is most likely due to the circadian rhythm. A recent study by the\nNational Sleep Foundation (2008) found that approximately 48% of respondents had\nnapped at least twice in the last month. However, when looking at workplace behavior,\nonly 10% of respondents said they took naps at work. About one-third of employers allow\ntheir employees to nap at work, but only 16% of employers actually provide a place for\nnapping to occur. These numbers show that while napping is potentially beneficial to the\nworkplace, it is not regularly occurring.\nEvolution in the office\nExercise and Physical Activity\nResearch has established that the cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal,\nendocrine, and immune systems are all positively impacted by exercise (Bouchard,\nShephard, and Stephens, 1994; Wilmore and Costill, 1994). This is mostly attributed to the\nfact that exercise increases cardiac outputs, blood flow, oxygen uptake, energy levels,\nmetabolic rate, and hormone levels while decreasing blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood\nThere has been a growing amount of research on the positive effects of physical\nexercise interventions (e.g., adding corporate gyms, free time for gym activity, etc.). In\nfact, physical interventions have resulted in lowering participants' body mass, blood\npressure, cholesterol, and have often eliminated employee's smoking status (Shephard,\n1996). In these cases, the organization theoretically will also benefit from these\ninterventions as some studies show a strong negative correlation between the overall health\nof employees and their rates of absenteeism (Lechner et al., 1997; Tucker, Aldana, and\nFriedman, 1990). Employees' overall health is also linked to a reduction in medical care\nclaims, increased productivity, and overall job performance (Bernacki and Baun, 1984;\nSedentary lifestyles are strongly correlated with obesity (Levine, Schleusner, and\nregular everyday movements (e.g., standing up instead of sitting down) can help combat\nobesity by increasing the amount of energy expended in a day \u00ad this is known as non-\nexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT; Levine et al., 2000; Levine et al., 2005; Levine et\nal., 2011). Research into the NEAT phenomenon has found that actions such as fidgeting\nand standing are both positively correlated with weight loss (Levine et al., 2000; Levine et\nal., 2005). In fact, one study found that obese individuals tend to sit down about two hours\nmore than lean/healthy individuals, and eliminating these extra two hours of sitting may\nPeople who live in urban areas walk less than people who live in rural areas (Levine\net al., 2011). The same study found that obese urban Americans sat about four hours longer\nthan rural Jamaicans (who did not suffer an obesity problem) \u00ad indicating that walking is\nanother form of NEAT that could be used to combat obesity in urban areas. Thus, we see\nthat certain practical interventions in the workplace could be implemented to increase\nNEAT, including high-top desks allowing for people to stand instead of sit while working\nas well as increased walking distances to bathrooms, cafeterias, and parking lots.\nIntegrating a single 10-minute exercise break during work time can help provide motivation\nand adoption of a more active lifestyle for many of the otherwise sedentary individuals who\nparticipated (Yancey et al., 2004). This also helped the individuals to better understand a\nself-actualized and realistic perception of their own health and fitness levels (Yancey et al.,\nSocial Interaction\nWorkplaces vary in levels of social interaction, and the type and amount of social\nEvolution in the office\ninteraction are likely to influence worker well-being. Repetti (1993) suggests that stress\nassociated with the workplace social environment is a factor in physical and mental health\nproblems. Poor social relationships at work have been associated with several negative\nphysical symptoms in white collar workers (Kawakami, Araki, Hayashi, and Masumoto,\n1989), including aggression \u00ad which is a tremendous cost to employers via means such as\nhealth insurance coverage, lost work time, and legal expenses (e.g., Kaptein, 1999).\nInformal social relationships in the workplace have both direct and moderating\neffects on reducing depression (Chen, Siu, Lu, Cooper, and Philips, 2009). Other studies\nhave also shown the relationship between social support and positive psychological\noutcomes, such as providing a protective buffer from stress (Cohen and Wills, 1985) and\naiding in the prevention of burnout (Anderson, 1991).\nSocial interaction is not only limited to verbal exchange among humans.\nResearchers are finding that people who bring their pets to work report less stress and\ngreater physical and psychological health (Wells and Perrine, 2001). These benefits have\nalso been found at the biological level. Specifically, people exhibit higher levels of\noxytocin (the neuropeptide responsible for feelings of bonding, social interaction, and\nstress relief) after interacting with their own dog (Miller et al., 2009).\nThe domestication of dogs began approximately 15,000 years ago (Villa et al.,\n1997), which may have led to the development of bonding behaviors between humans and\ncanines. However, these benefits also generalize to the workplace as well. New data has\nrevealed that the presence of a dog \u00ad any dog, not just one's own dog \u00ad facilitates group\ncohesion, cooperation, intimacy, and interpersonal trust among participants working on a\ngroup task together (Christensen, Honts, and Colarelli, 2012). Thus, bringing one's dog to\nwork could have added benefits on overall worker efficiency.\nThe Evolutionary Workspace\nFrom reviewing these studies, we propose the evolutionary workspace as a means\nof creating a supportive environment for employees that will also increase employer profits\n(or, at the very least, decrease employer costs). The evolutionary workspace should have\nmany windows that employees can regularly open so that they may receive sunlight\nexposure, as well as several different types of plants and small potted trees, as well as\nartwork of open savannahs and other greenery. This will decrease stress while also\nimproving mood and feelings of relaxation, job performance, attention, and cooperation.\nProviding a place for employees to take naps will also increase employee attention\nand performance while decreasing the likelihood of onsite accidents \u00ad which will aid in\nkeeping down the medical and insurance costs of the employer. Providing methods to\nincrease physical activity will also help keep employees physically and psychologically\nhealthy (decreasing costs to employers by decreasing workers' absenteeism and\nhospital/doctor visits). These new methods can include the use of high-top desks that will\nrequire employees to stand instead of sitting while working. Increasing the distances to\nbathrooms, cafeterias, and parking lots will also increase the amount of exercise employees\nget. If these additions are unfeasible, employers can integrate a single 10-minute exercise\nbreak during work.\nEvolution in the office\nFinally, increasing human and animal social interaction in the workplace may help\ndecrease stress and anxiety among employees. If people can talk to each other, they can\ndevelop cooperative relationships which may facilitate greater group mentality and worker\nefficiency in the future. Allowing employees to bring their dogs to work will increase many\ncooperative and productive behaviors as well. Leading companies such as Google and\nAmazon have been allowing their employees to do this for years.\nFuture Directions\nAlthough the present review displayed many factors from our ancestral past that, if\nimplemented in the workplace, may increase worker health and efficiency, the studies cited\ndid not examine all of these factors together in one environment. In fact, no studies or\ncompanies to date have evaluated whether implementing the collection of these factors will\nactually have these positive effects. A large scale study comparing the evolutionary\nworkplace with modern workplaces in areas pertaining to employee health, psychological\nwell-being, and productivity would provide definitive evidence regarding the effects of\nimplementing all of the factors discussed in this review.\nThere are also many other potential influences from our evolutionary past that may\nimprove employee productivity which warrant further research. For instance, occupational\nnoise exposure has been associated with job stress (Leather, Beale, and Sullivan, 2003) and\nincreased cortisol levels (Spreng, 2000) \u00ad a hormone associated with stress responses and\ndecreased psychological and physical health (Lindfors and Lundberg, 2002; Wrosch,\nMiller, Lupien, and Pruessner, 2008). Yet, implementing sounds from nature that may have\nbeen prevalent in our ancestral environment aids in recovery from psychological stress\n(Alvarsson, Wiens, and Nilsson, 2010). Future studies could attempt to implement sounds\nfrom natural environments, or current hunter-gatherer tribal environments (the closest\nliving examples of our hunter-gatherer ancestors) to examine if these sounds decrease\nemployee stress and/or increase worker productivity.\nAn optimal workplace temperature has also been proposed as a means of increasing\nemployee comfort and productivity (Kosonen and Tan, 2004). Offices with temperatures\nbetween 21 \u00ad 23 degrees Celsius (69-73 degrees Fahrenheit) receive the fewest number of\nworker complaints related to thermal sensation (Federspiel, 2000). Using heating/cooling\nmechanisms, proper ventilation, and giving employees the ability to wear comfortable\nlayers of clothing so that they may adjust to any fluctuating temperatures by adding or\nremoving articles may aid in thermoregulation and increase worker productivity (Nichol\nand Humphreys, 2002). Psychological research in this area is still needed. These factors\ncould be utilized as independent variables to investigate this potential causal relationship\nthat varying levels of room temperature, ventilation, and workplace attire may have with\nemployee productivity.\nWorker health, happiness, and efficiency may also be linked to individual life\nhistory as well. Life history theory states that impulsivity is highly correlated with an\nenvironment's perceived danger and unpredictability (Kaplan and Gangestad, 2005). When\nan environment's future is uncertain, people tend to engage in behaviors that produce short-\nterm benefits over delaying gratification for a greater payoff in the future (Ellis, Figueredo,\nEvolution in the office\nBrumbach, and Schlomer, 2009). Thus, emphasizing the stability of an environment should\nlead people to believe they will live to see the future of that environment, which should\nmotivate them to care about that future (Griskevicus, Cantu, and Van Vugt, 2012). Creating\na stable and predictable work environment would help employees believe that they will\nremain in that workplace and/or company throughout the future, which would produce a\ngreater motivation to increase the future quality of that company. Implementing a policy to\nincrease employees' perceived job security, as opposed to motivating employees through\nfear of losing their jobs, may encourage workers to maintain or improve their efficiency,\nthus increasing the overall quality of the workplace and helping to sustain a pleasant\nworking environment for their future in the process.\nConclusion\nImmersing employees in a workplace setting that resembles our own savannah-style\nancestral environment may decrease this evolutionary mismatch and increase employee\nproductivity, health, and overall efficiency. This would provide great benefits to both\nemployees, in the form of job satisfaction, job performance, and overall physical and\npsychological health, and employers, in the form of greater worker efficiency and\ndecreased costs of employee healthcare and absenteeism, thus increasing company profits\nand productivity. Because employees have little control over their workplace environment,\nemployers may want to consider adopting the evolutionary workspace as a means of not\nonly increasing employee physical and psychological health, but as a means of improving\nthe overall fiscal and social quality of their companies.\nReferences\nAlvarsson, J.
