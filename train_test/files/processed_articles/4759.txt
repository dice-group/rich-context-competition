This assay demon-\nand excellent specificity (70\u00ad95%) in several\nPrompt microbiological identification of\nthe underlying pathogen in infected patients\nand the consequent adaption of the anti-\nmicrobial therapy might lead to improved\npatient outcomes in the ICU. At a time when\nthere is a growing problem of drug resistant\nmicro-organisms, there is a considerable\nneed for rapid diagnostic tests.12 The time\nadvantage for PCR diagnostics might be of\nimportance especially in patients being trea-\nted with empirical antimicrobial therapy\nthat does not target the specific causative\nspecies. However, the impact of PCR-based\npathogen identification on infection man-\nagement in the ICU setting has not been\nevaluated in randomized controlled trials\n(RCTs) to date.\nAgainst this background, the aim of the\npresent study was to determine whether\nrapid pathogen identification using a multi-\nplex PCR test in ICU patients could reduce\nthe time required for initial pathogen\nidentification and subsequent antimicrobial\ntherapy modification to target the specific\npathogen. We hypothesized that the rapid\navailability of the results of the PCR-based\npathogen identification would be accompa-\nnied by a reduced delay of antimicrobial\ntherapy modification in critically ill patients\nwith severe infections.\nPatients and methods\nStudy design\nThis double-blind, parallel-group RCT was\nundertaken at two university hospitals in\nBerlin, Germany: Charite\n\u00b4 University\nHospital Campus Charite\n\u00b4 Mitte; Charite\n\u00b4\nUniversity Hospital Campus Charite\n\u00b4\nVirchow Klinikum. A total of six ICUs\nenrolled patients between August 2010 and\nMarch 2012; five anaesthesiological ICUs\nand one surgical ICU. This study was\napproved by the local Ethics Review\nBoard (Ethics Commission, Charite\n\u00b4 \u00ad\nUniversitaetsmedizin Berlin Campus\nCharite\n\u00b4 Mitte, Berlin, Germany) and the\ndata safety authorities; it was also registered\nwith the International Standard\nRandomized Controlled Trial number\nsent was obtained from every included\npatient or their legal representative.\nPatient inclusion and randomization\nPatients were eligible for study inclusion\nwhen they presented with signs of sepsis of\nsuspected abdominal or pulmonary origin,\ncaused by an unknown pathogen when BC\ndiagnostics were indicated. Sepsis was\ndefined as suspected or proven infection\ncausing systemic inflammation with at least\ntwo of the following: (i) leucocyte count <4\nor >12 /nl; (ii) body temperature <36C or\nhyperventilation (pa\ntachycardia >90 bpm.5 Infections were\ndefined by the treating physicians using\nstandardized criteria for infection manage-\nment implemented on the participating\nincluded only once even if they had multiple\nepisodes of sepsis during their ICU stay.\nAdditionally, infection onset was required to\nbe <72 h, to reduce the risk of detecting\npersistent circulating DNA. Exclusion cri-\nteria were age <18 years, pregnancy, police\ncustody, missing or withdrawn informed\nconsent or participation in another pro-\nspective clinical study.\nPatients fulfilling the inclusion criteria\nwere asked to provide written informed\nconsent. A substantial number of critically\nill patients are unable to give consent due to\ntheir clinical status, their need for mechan-\nical ventilation, or altered mental status. In\nthese cases, patients were included in the\nrandomization process with a delayed con-\nsent procedure. Informed consent was\nobtained as soon as possible, from the\npatient or their legal representative.\nEligible patients !18 years old were\nrandomized to either the control or inter-\nvention group in a 1 : 1 ratio, according to\nconsecutive sample processing by the\nInstitute for Microbiology and Hygiene\nBerlin, Charite\n\u00b4 \u00adUniversitaetsmedizin Berlin,\nBerlin, Germany. Randomization was\nachieved using computer-generated random\nnumbers and performed in blocks of four.\nThe randomization scheme was not known\nto the treating physicians on the ICUs. To\nminimize the risk of bias, allocation was\nblinded to all clinical study participants and\nstaff members on the ICU. Furthermore, to\nachieve maximum allocation concealment,\ntreating physicians on the ICUs were not\naware of group assignment until the results\nof the multiplex PCR analysis were available\nand communicated to the study ICU wards.\nMicrobiological procedures, study\nintervention, data collection\nMicrobiological diagnostics were performed\non participating ICU wards, whenever the\npatient's clinical condition indicated\npossible systemic infection. Typically, in\npatients with suspected pneumonia, two\nBC series (each containing one anaerobic\nand one aerobic bottle) and samples from\nthe respiratory tract were taken. In sus-\npected abdominal infection, two BC series\n(each with 10 ml of blood) and at least one\nculture from the infection site (e.g. intrao-\nperative sample) were obtained. In all\npatients, an additional blood sample was\ntaken from a venous or arterial site; a sterile\nBC puncture was obtained and an add-\nitional volume of 1.5 ml of whole blood was\nadded to a 1.8 mg/ml ethylenediaminetetra-\nacetic acid sample tube. Samples were stored\nat 7C until transfer to the laboratory.\nIn patients assigned to the intervention\ngroup, biological samples were processed\nimmediately for the LightCycler\u00d5 SeptiFast\nPCR test (see below for details) and results\nwere communicated to the physician team on\nthe study ICU ward as soon as they were\navailable; in the control group, biological\nsamples were stored at \u00c080C for later ana-\nlysis. All microbiological samples were pro-\ncessed using standard methods as required by\nthe clinical care process. Positive results from\nthe BC Gram staining were immediately\ncommunicated by the microbiologist to the\ntreating physicians on the study ICU wards.\nBC bottles (BACTECTM; Becton Dickinson,\nFranklin Lakes, NJ, USA) were inoculated\nfor 6 days until growth was detected. Positive\nbottles were streaked onto a set of agar plates\nand subjected to direct Gram staining. Any\ncolonies that grew in culture were identified\nusing matrix-assisted laser desorption\nionization\u00adtime of flight equipment\n(MALDI-TOF, microflex LT; Bruker\nDaltonic, Bremen, Germany) or biochemical\nidentification tests (Vitek\u00d5 2; bioMe\n\u00b4 rieux, La\nBalme-les-Grottes, France). Commercial\nprocedures were used for antimicrobial sus-\nceptibility testing (Vitek\u00d5 2 or Etest\u00d5;\nbioMe\n\u00b4 rieux).\nThe multiplex PCR evaluated in this trial\nwas the commercially available\nLightCycler\u00d5 SeptiFast test using a sequen-\ntial semiautomatic workflow (Roche\nDiagnostics GmbH, Mannheim,\nGermany). The sample processing included\nmechanical cell lysis using SeptiFast\nMagNALyser followed by magnetic adsorp-\ntion DNA purification in the MagNA Pure\nCompact System and detection of pathogen-\nspecific DNA in a LightCycler\u00d5 PCR instru-\nment. All results were processed using the\nLightCycler\u00d5 SeptiFast identification soft-\nware provided by the manufacturer. The test\nsystem allows identification of 25 common\nBC pathogens without analysis of resistance\npatterns. The LightCycler\u00d5 SeptiFast PCR\ntest system is described in detail elsewhere.14\nClinical data were taken prospectively\nfrom all patients during their ICU stay\nbased on all available written information\nand the electronic patient chart. This system\ncontains all relevant data for every ICU day\nincluding laboratory data, physiological\nparameters (e.g. heart rate, body tempera-\nture), as well as information regarding ven-\ntilation, results from physical examinations\nand diagnostic or therapeutic intentions).\nMeasurements included the Simplified\nAcute Physiology Score II to assess severity\nof disease on admission.15 In patients receiv-\ning any immunosuppressive agents or\nchemotherapy within the past 6 weeks, an\nimpaired immune system was recorded.\nPatients fulfilled criteria for septic shock\nwhen hypotension (systolic blood pressure\n<90 mmHg) was noted or when there was\nthe need for vasopressor usage to maintain a\nsufficient blood pressure. Medical history of\npatients was also evaluated for documented\nalcohol abuse. Microbiological information\nwas taken from the main hospital patient\ndatabase.\nStudy endpoints\nThe study design was intended to be com-\nparable with the clinical situation where\nmultiplex PCR testing would be an available\ndiagnostic option, comparable with current\nstandard BCs.3 Multiplex PCR assays are\nundergoing rapid development; bedside tests\nas well as automated analyses are already\navailable. BC bottles are transported to the\nlaboratory throughout the day and are\ninoculated even during the night and at\nweekends. The multiplex PCR test analysed\nin this study required $170 min of skilled\nhands-on time and thus was only available\nduring the daytime and not at weekends.\nFor the purpose of this study, the availabil-\nity of the multiplex PCR test processing was\nrequested to be within 12 h after sampling.\nAgainst this background, patients were\ncomparable transport durations and dur-\nation until sample processing for both treat-\nment arms. Therefore, this study included\npatients with progression of infection during\nthis timeframe. However, when BC diagnos-\ntics had already been undertaken during\ndaytime hours, patients did not fulfil the\ninclusion criteria. The choice of antimicro-\nbial therapy and the clinical-care process\nwere completely under the responsibility of\nthe ICU physicians without any interference\nfrom the study team. Members of the study\nteam were not part of the clinical care staff\non ICU wards.\nThe primary aim of the study was to\ncompare the duration from sampling until\navailability of the microbiological results.\nThe time was calculated from the moment of\nsterile puncture of the vein and allocation of\nthe necessary blood sample for both tests\n(LightCycler\u00d5 SeptiFast PCR and BC bot-\ntles) until the information from the\nLightCycler\u00d5 SeptiFast PCR test or a posi-\ntive BC result were communicated by the\nmicrobiologist to the ICU physician by\ntelephone. Furthermore, this study aimed\nto assess the influence of the additional\ninformation on therapy modification, and\nto describe the corresponding time frame for\nthe bedside decision. Therefore, all related\nchanges in antimicrobial therapy were\nmonitored. Secondary endpoints included a\ncomparison of the spectrum of pathogens\nthat were detected in the two groups and\nthe sensitivity and specificity of the\nLightCycler\u00d5 SeptiFast PCR test.\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nthe SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version 19.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. Variables were analysed using\nnumbers and percentages, median and quar-\ntiles (25%\u00ad75% percentile), or mean \u00c6 SD\nbased on scale level and distribution of\nnormality, as appropriate. All tests for stat-\nistical significance were performed with a\ntwo-sided alpha < 0.05. Depending on the\nscale level, Fisher's exact 2-test, Student's\nt-test, or Mann\u00adWhitney U-test were used.\nIt was not possible to calculate the sample\nsize requirements a priori: the time demand\nfor the decision-making process on the basis\nof pathogen detection using PCR technol-\nogy was unpredictable, based on previous\ndata. Consequently, a conservative approach\nwas used by enrolling 100 patient samples.\nBased on the findings of the study in the\ncontext of its pilot nature, a power analysis\nwas performed to evaluate the number of\npatients needed to achieve a power of 80%\nwith a two-sided alpha of 5% (nonparametric\nunpaired Wilcoxon test), to demonstrate a\ndifference in the time requirement for the\nPCR technology in a future confirmatory\nRCT (nQuery Advisor\u00d5 software, version\n5.0; Statistical Solutions, Boston, MA, USA).\nA P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nDuring the study period, 100 consecutive\npatients were eligible for inclusion in the\nstudy. Of these, 22 were unable to provide\nwritten informed consent because the\npatients or their legal representatives refused\nto participate in the study or the patient\nexperienced rapid clinical deterioration and\nsubsequent death with no legal representa-\ntive being nominated. According to the\ninstitutional review board vote, all data\nfrom these 22 excluded patients were\ndeleted. As a consequence, the study fol-\nlowed-up and analysed 78 patients: 37 in the\ncontrol group and 41 in the intervention\ngroup (Figure 1).\nBaseline demographic and clinical char-\nacteristics did not differ significantly\nbetween the two groups (Table 1). The\nmost common clinical condition was sepsis\nof pulmonary origin, which was observed in\ngroup.\nintervention group, the LightCycler\u00d5\nSeptiFast PCR test identified one of the\nfollowing pathogens in the bloodstream\n(Table 2): Staphylococcus aureus,\nPseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp.,\nEnterococcus faecium, Enterobacter spp.,\nEscherichia coli, Candida parapsilosis and\nCandida albicans. In the intervention group,\ncorresponding BCs grew pathogens in five of\nS. epidermidis was detected that was not\nfound by the LightCycler\u00d5 SeptiFast PCR\ntest. In all of the other cases, all of the\nBC results were also detected by the\nLightCycler\u00d5 SeptiFast PCR test.\nIn the control group, BCs were positive in\nS. epidermidis, E. faecium, E. faecalis and\nS. aureus (Table 2). In the post-hoc\nLightCycler\u00d5 SeptiFast PCR test of\ncollected samples, eight pathogens were\nidentified (E. coli, E. faecium, E. faecalis,\nStreptococcus pneumoniae, S. aureus and\nS. epidermidis). In one case with BCs grow-\ning two pathogens (E. faecalis and\nS. epidermidis), the LightCycler\u00d5 SeptiFast\nPCR test only identified E. faecalis.\nThe concordance rate between the BC\nresults and those of the LightCycler\u00d5\nSeptiFast PCR test were analysed for\nthe intervention and control groups.\nAssessed for randomization\nAllocated to control (n = 50)\n Declined to participate (n = 13)\nAllocated to intervention (n = 50)\n Declined to participate (n = 9)\nAnalysis\nAll patients followed-up and\nAll patients followed-up and\nFigure 1.

In six control-group sam-\nples analysed after short-term frozen stor-\nage, the LightCycler\u00d5 SeptiFast PCR test\nresult had a technical signal in the test\nsummary and was not validated: in two\nsamples, no pathogens were detected but the\ninternal control was also negative; in four\nsamples, the negative control channel was\npositive, indicating potential system con-\ntamination. None of these patients had a\npathogen detected in BCs.

Using the LightCycler\u00d5\nSeptiFast PCR test shortened the duration\nfrom sampling to availability of microbio-\nlogical results by 22.2 h. Two cases of\ncandidaemia were detected in the\nintervention group, both of which were\nvalidated with subsequent standard BC\ndiagnostics.

Results\nfrom other biological samples, such as\nurine and tracheobronchial or abdominal\ndrainage secretions, may be included in the\nclinical assessment of a specific patient's\ncondition.

In this current study, two cases of\nunsuspected candidaemia were identified\nusing the LightCycler\u00d5 SeptiFast PCR test.\nIn this context, a quasi-experimental, before\nand after, observational cohort study\ndemonstrated that a conservative strategy\nwith prompt diagnostics and reluctant anti-\nbiotic prescribing was associated with\nreduced overall mortality in ICU patients.12\nThese authors also reported that their\nThe application of fast pathogen detection\nmethods might enable physicians to tailor\nantibiotic prescribing to individual patients\nin the future.\nAlthough the LightCycler\u00d5 SeptiFast\nPCR test was expected to reduce the time\nto initial pathogen diagnosis based on the\nmethodological characteristics of the test,\nthe effects on the subsequent clinical deci-\nsion making process was not predictable a\npriori. A reduction in the time to pathogen\nidentification through the use of PCR-based\ntechnology has been previously reported,\nbut the study used an open design with the\nphysicians knowing the results for all\npatients and them not reporting the time\nuntil they received the results of the BCs.19\nPCR-based methods might be particularly\nuseful in patients pretreated with antibiotics,\nas reported by a Japanese group.18 The best\nresults in terms of rapid pathogen identifi-\ncation would probably require the combin-\nation of both standard BC methods and\nPCR-based technololgy.21,22 There remains\nan element of uncertainty about PCR-based\npathogen identification because circulating\nDNA does not necessarily mean that the\npatient is infected with the pathogen. In this\ncurrent study, the risk of detecting persistent\ncirculating DNA was reduced by only\nincluding patients in the first 72 h after the\nonset of sepsis.\nThis study had a number of strengths and\nlimitations. The strengths included external\npatient randomization, which included allo-\ncation concealment and separation of clin-\nical care teams from the study team, to\nmaximize the reduction in bias.\nFurthermore, the study groups were similar\nwith regard to their baseline demographic\nand clinical characteristics. The limitations\nincluded the fact that the a priori scenario\nassumed that the availability of the multi-\nplex PCR-based test was equal to that of\nstandard BC diagnostics, which it was not.\nAs a consequence of the limited availability\nof trained staff to undertake multiplex\nPCR-based test during evenings and week-\nends, and to ensure an adequate comparison\nof the two diagnostic techniques, patients\nwere only enrolled into the study between\nPCR-based test was only available for 12 h\nduring the daytime on weekdays. This\nassumption was made because of the recent\ntechnical developments in the field.\nMultiplex PCR technology is used in plat-\nforms with improved automation and has\nalso been developed for point-of-care set-\ntings. In contrast, the workflow for standard\nBCs allowed for immediate growth of micro-\norganisms and automated incubation was\nalso available during the night and at week-\nends. This limited enrolment period led to a\nsubstantial number of patients not fulfilling\nthe inclusion criteria because of having\nalready had BCs taken during the regular\nmorning shifts on the ICU ward. The limited\nenrolment period also meant that patient\nrecruitment lasted longer than initially\nexpected. As a result of this particular\nlimitation, generalizability of these findings\nis limited to the precondition that the\nmultiplex PCR-based test was only available\nwithin a distinct time frame. Compared with\nprevious trials assessing specific clinical\nsettings,23,24 this current study focused on\na broader target population, which was\nrecruited from six different ICUs at two\nstudy sites and represented a broad spec-\ntrum of patients admitted to postoperative\nICUs. It was not in the scope of this current\nstudy to evaluate different PCR-based diag-\nnostic techniques that are currently avail-\nable.25 The current study only aimed to\nassess the use of DNA-based pathogen\ndetection using one specific assay, the\nLightCycler\u00d5 SeptiFast PCR test.\nFurthermore, this trial did not evaluate the\neconomic impact of this innovative technol-\nogy. Similarly, the impact on patient\noutcomes is one of the most important\naspects, but this was not investigated in\nthis current study. Morbidity and mortality\noutcomes should be addressed in future\ntrials, to demonstrate if advantages of\nrapid multiplex PCR-based pathogen diag-\nnosis lead to clinical benefits for patients.\nThis trial was designed to provide an\nestimate of the number of patients that\nwould be needed to be included in a con-\nfirmatory RCT with a comparable design in\nfuture. Based on these findings, with a power\nof 80%, 18 patients with therapy modifica-\ntions based on rapid PCR-based diagnostic\ninformation would be needed to demon-\nstrate a statistically significant difference on\na two-sided alpha level of 5%. If there was a\nlow pathogen detection rate of 10% in the\npopulation, 180 patients would be required.\nIn conclusion, multiplex PCR-based\nidentification of microbial pathogens might\nrepresent a fundamental change in the way\nthat physicians manage bacterial and fun-\ngal infections. PCR-based technology is\ndeveloping quickly in this field, and sample\nprocessing and workflow have already\nimproved compared with the LightCycler\u00d5\nSeptiFast PCR test platform used in this\nstudy.25 With the innovations being made\nand the growing clinical availability of these\nPCR-based techniques, a time requirement\nof <6 h from sampling to pathogen identi-\nfication could mean that infection man-\nagement shifts from modifying empirical\ntherapy to providing pathogen-specific tar-\ngeted regimens right from the initiation of\ntherapy. However, more clinical data are\nrequired to prove the reliability of PCR-\nbased technology, as well as its usefulness,\nin different clinical settings.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nAll authors declare that they have no conflicts of\ninterest concerning the specific subject of this study.\nI.N. and S.T. received lecture fees from Roche\nDeutschland GmbH and Pfizer Deutschland\nGmbH.
