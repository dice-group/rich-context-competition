This study investigated the latent structure of productive activity among middle-aged and older adults.\nWhereas most researchers have examined forms of productive activity as discrete behaviors, our approach captured the\nreality that many persons engage in more than one activity and commit varying degrees of time to these activities.\nMethods. We took the data for this study from the Americans' Changing Lives survey. The activities examined include\nformal volunteer work, informal help to others, unpaid domestic work, caregiving, and paid work. We describe the\ncomplex clusters of activities and time commitment to those activities using latent class cluster analysis.\nResults. Our results demonstrated that a four-cluster model fit the data well. Specifically, the findings showed that\nmiddle-aged and older adults fell into four clusters: helpers, home maintainers, worker/volunteers, and super helpers. We\nalso show how individual characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race) are associated with the likelihood of being in one of these\nfour groups.\nDiscussion. This measurement strategy provides a foundation for future research into how experts can employ\nproductive activity clusters to understand better well-being across the life course. This is important because our results\nshow that many activities do not occur independently but rather are linked in patterned ways.\nINTEREST in the study of productive activity in later life has\ngrown substantially over the past two decades. Butler and\nGleason (1985) are credited with putting this issue on the\nagenda of scholars and policy makers; however, scholarly\ninterest in activity in later life has had a long history (e.g.,\nthe recent interest in productive activity in later life has stem-\nmed from the sheer economic value of these activities, much of\nwhich does not result from activity in the paid labor market. For\nexample, for adults of all ages, estimates indicate that, for\nvolunteering and caregiving combined, the total economic\nvalue is more than $400 billion annually (Arno, Levine, &\nScholars tend to treat productive activities as discrete phe-\nnomena; less commonly, they have examined how one activity\nis related to another. Given that many persons are engaged in\nmore than one activity at specific stages in the life course, it is\nplausible that some activities may group together in patterned\nways. Other activities may be less likely to be engaged in at the\nsame time. If some activities are complementary and others are\nin competition with one another, it is reasonable to anticipate\nthat different types of activities may cluster together. We are\nnot aware of any attempt to understand if and how multiple\nproductive activities may be related to one another, especially\nwith the goal of determining whether there is a latent structure\nthat captures the complex way that forms of activity and time\ncommitted to these activities may be related. If these clusters\nexist, they will have conceptual interest, help researchers to\nunderstand better these socially valuable behaviors, and ulti-\nmately, allow scholars to show how this behavior is related to\nolder persons' well-being. Furthermore, if meaningful clusters\nexist, scholars may be able to increase their understanding of\nthe discretionary and obligatory nature of productive activity\n(e.g., Van Willigen, 2000) and whether certain activities are\ncompeting or complementary (e.g., Scharlach, 1994).\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate whether\nproductive activity clusters exist for a nationally representative\nsample of middle-aged and older persons. The central question\nin this study was the following: Do specific types of productive\nactivity in later life cluster together in meaningful ways? We\nassumed that some activities would be linked to one another\nsuch that participation in one type of activity may be positively\nassociated with participation in another. We saw other activities\nas being in competition with one another and thus less likely to\ncluster together. We examined data from the Americans'\nChanging Lives (ACL) survey and employed latent class\ncluster analysis (LCA) to determine whether latent classes of\nproductive activity existed. We also used logistic regression\ntechniques to investigate how these clusters were associated\nwith individual characteristics.\nResearch has shown that older Americans remain productive\ndeep into the later stages of their lives. Caro and colleagues\n(e.g., Caro & Bass, 1997) were among the first scholars to\ndemonstrate that a considerable amount of productivity occurs\nin the postretirement years, albeit largely unpaid in nature. Caro\nand Bass (1995), using the Commonwealth Foundation Survey\nof Productive Aging, found that between ages 55 and 74 older\npersons remain remarkably active in a number of dimensions of\nproductive aging (defined as volunteering, child care, informal\nhelp to friends, relatives and neighbors, caregiving, paid work,\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2007 by The Gerontological Society of America\nand education). Even after age 75, nearly 20% of their sample\nreported volunteering, helping children and grandchildren, or\nproviding care to sick and disabled persons.\nKlumb and Baltes (1999), employing data from the Berlin\nAging Study, defined productive activity as specific activities in\nwhich the respondents had engaged the day before the interview;\nthese included domestic activity (home maintenance and\nhousework), errands, gardening, paid work, and helping others\n(including caregiving and formal volunteering). Based on this list\nof activities, they found that more than 90% of persons aged 70 to\nproductive activities. Glass, Seeman, Herzog, Kahn, and Berk-\nman (1995), using panel data from the MacArthur Research\nNetwork Study and defining productive activities as housework,\npaid work, yard work, child care, and volunteering, discovered a\nsubstantial amount of stability in productive behavior over a 3-\nyear period for a cohort of persons aged 70 to 79. Herzog and\ncolleagues, using data from the ACL study, also reported that\nproductive activity is maintained throughout the adult life course\n(e.g., Herzog, Kahn, Morgan, Jackson, & Antonucci, 1989).\nThese authors defined productive activity as volunteer work,\ninformal help, home maintenance, and housework.\nOur definition of productive activity is any socially valued\nactivity that produces goods and services, whether paid or not\n(Bass & Caro, 2001). Another way to think about unpaid\nproductive activities (e.g., volunteering) is that if someone does\nnot perform an important activity, someone else would have to\nbe paid to do it (Morgan, 1986). For this study, we focused on\nvolunteering; informal help in the form of provision of goods\nand services to relatives, friends, and neighbors; informal\ncaregiving; unpaid work necessary for home maintenance; and\npaid work. We excluded child care provided to children living\nwithin the respondent's home because a very small percentage\nof persons in the age group evaluated here were involved in this\nactivity. However, we did include child care provided for\nchildren who did not live in the respondent's home when we\ndefined it as being part of informal help given to relatives,\nfriends, and neighbors.\nPaid work. --An extensive literature has documented\npatterns of participation in the paid workforce, especially\namong age and gender groups, demonstrating both gender\ndifferentiation in work behavior and a distinctive age curve in\nparticipation. Herzog and colleagues (1989) reported a typical\nfinding: Participation over the age range resembles an inverted\nU--men and women increase their paid work activities as they\napproach midlife, then reduce or eliminate paid work as they\nenter late life (see also Szafran, 2002). Paid work is less com-\nmon beyond the age of 70 or 75 but does occur among a\nsignificant minority of the population (Szafran, 2002).\nCaregiving. --Among the specific types of productive acti-\nvity, gerontologists have addressed the caregiving issue exten-\nsively. Research has demonstrated that many individuals during\ntheir lifetimes provide some caregiving to a family member or\nfriend, and that a sizable minority is extensively absorbed in\ncaregiving (Doty, Jackson, & Crown, 1998). Herzog and col-\nleagues (1989) showed that caregiving most commonly occurs\namong middle-aged individuals, who likely provide care to\ntheir parents, and among older individuals, many of whom\nprovide care for a spouse. Women are somewhat more likely\nthan men to provide direct care, with men's participation often\noccurring at the level of coordinating care for others (e.g.,\nInformal help. --Providing informal help to neighbors,\nfriends, and family members, usually on a sporadic basis and\nincluding such activities as running errands, providing trans-\nportation, and helping with chores or child care, is common\namong American adults. Researchers normally measure assis-\ntance of this type with reference to help provided to others\noutside of the household (Hogan, Eggebeen, & Clogg, 1993).\nThese activities are very common forms of productive behavior\nfor all age groups, but some research has shown a decline over\nthe adult age range (Herzog et al., 1989).\nFormal volunteering. --Persons typically do volunteer work,\ndefined as ``unpaid work on the part of an individual or a group\nof individuals with the intent of benefiting others . . . with\nwhom one has no contractual, familial, or friendship obliga-\na formal organizational structure. Formal volunteer activity of\nthis kind is considerably less common in the population than\ninformal help provided to friends and neighbors, but it occurs\namong one quarter to one half of the population among adult\nage groups (Wilson, 2000). Participation is most common among\npersons at midlife stages of the life course (Hendricks & Cutler,\n2004), but the amount of time committed to volunteering\namong the oldest volunteers is often extensive (Hendricks &\nHome maintenance and housework. --Domestic activity,\nwork done around and inside the home, is another form of\nunpaid productive activity. Many dimensions of domestic activ-\nity are not optional. For example, if a person does not perform\nsome forms of routine maintenance on the structure of the\nhousing unit, safety and security may be at risk and the economic\nvalue of the house may depreciate. Both men and women\nparticipate in unpaid work around the home, but the kinds of\nwork they do are often quite different (see Shelton & John,\n1996). In general, women tend to specialize in activities that\nmust be done routinely inside the home, such as laundry, food\npreparation, and cleaning. Men are more likely to specialize in\nactivities that are done outside of the home, such as yard\nmaintenance and home and auto repairs. Nevertheless, Herzog\nand colleagues (1989) provided evidence showing that most men\nand women across all age groups participate at some level in\nhousehold maintenance or improvement activities.\nClustering of productive activities. --The clustering of\nproductive activities in later life is conditioned in complex\nways by two characteristics: whether the activities are\ncomplementary or in competition with one another with respect\nto time commitments and opportunities and, to a lesser degree,\nwhether the participant views the activities as discretionary or\nobligatory. From a time-use standpoint, all productive activities\nare potentially in competition with one another. Given the\nconstraints of a 24-hr day, more time spent on any one activity\nimplies less time spent on others (multitasking notwithstand-\ning). However, time-use studies have also suggested a great\ndeal of variation across the life course in how people use their\ntime and in the extent to which discretionary time is available\n(Krantz-Kent, 2005). In the United States, as in other indus-\ntrialized countries, most people have a considerable amount of\ndiscretionary time available during the typical week that they\nmay commit to leisure, self-improvement, social, or productive\nactivities. When considering the question of competing versus\ncomplementary activities, the joint issues of type of activity and\ntime contributed are especially salient.\nDiscretionary activities are optional, determined in part on the\nbasis of preferences and lifestyle. Formal volunteering and\ninformal help given to persons in the community are examples of\nactivity that most people consider discretionary. Volunteering for\na religious organization or local hospital is not required, although\nsome persons may respond to normative pressures to do so\n(Wilson & Musick, 1997a). Religious persons may feel com-\npelled to volunteer at their church or synagogue, blurring the\ndistinction between obligatory and discretionary. Individuals see\nobligatory activities as compulsory, leaving them with little\nchoice about whether to participate, based in part on societal\nnorms about whether the activity should be taken on. Caregivers\nand others often characterize caregiving, especially for a close\nrelative, as a form of obligatory activity. Society expects spouses,\nfor example, to provide care directly, or to orchestrate care\nprovided by others, to a husband or wife when necessary.\nOne way to frame the understanding of which activities\ncluster together based on whether they compete with or com-\nplement each other and whether they are discretionary versus\nobligatory is to consider the social roles in which persons\nengage following from the master statuses they occupy during\nthe adult life course. A common set of social roles for predict-\ning types and levels of productive activity is linked to one's\nfamily status. Being part of a family implies a set of behaviors\nlinked to engagement in productive activity. For instance,\nmarriage implies obligations for husbands and wives to engage\nin tasks that are supportive of their family. When a person\nbecomes a parent, he or she is expected to provide care for the\nchild or arrange to have someone else provide care. Similarly,\nbeing a middle-aged child of an ailing parent implies a com-\nmitment to provide help when needed, at least on a nominal\nlevel. Most of the extant research has shown that caregiving\n(obligatory) behavior is in competition with work, especially\nfull-time work, and other activities, like volunteering (discre-\ntionary). Yet, recent evidence has shown that under some\ncircumstances, engaging in caregiving and volunteering is not\nunusual and in fact may be considered complementary to one\nanother (Burr, Choi, Mutchler, & Caro, 2005).\nAnother master status with implications for how social roles\ncondition participation in unpaid productive activities is a\nperson's relationship with the paid labor market. Through\neconomic necessity and social policy, most adults are\nencouraged (obliged) to participate in the labor market to\ngenerate income to meet basic and higher order needs, or they\ndepend on someone who does. Because paid work, especially\nfull-time work, often represents a heavy time commitment, it is\nconsidered to be in competition with many other activities,\nespecially caregiving (e.g., Doty et al., 1998). Individuals\nengaged in heavy caregiving activities--those taking primary\nresponsibility for a severely disabled parent or spouse, for\ninstance--engage in many trade-offs with respect to time\nallocation. Thus, providing extensive care to others is often\n``incompatible with full-time, paid employment at midlife''\n(Johnson & LoSasso, 2000, p. 5). Paid work and caregiving are\nexamples of two activities considered to be obligatory and in\ncompetition with one another, especially when both require heavy\ntime commitments.\nHowever, engagement in the paid labor market may\nbe complementary with discretionary activities, such as\nvolunteering for formal organizations. This is possible when\nsuch behaviors are an extension of employment-related social\nnetworks (Mutchler, Burr, & Caro 2003; Wilson & Musick,\n1997b). Persons engaging in paid work may enjoy broader and\nmore diverse networks that provide the potential to learn about\nmany different types of volunteer or informal helping\nopportunities. Gauthier and Smeeding (2000) found that\nindividuals who were employed full time spent more time on\nunpaid work (including activities such as volunteering but not\nhousework) on their off-days than did nonworkers during their\ntypical day, suggesting that paid work and volunteering in the\ncommunity complement one another. This is a case where one\nmay combine the obligatory nature of work in complementary\nways with the discretionary behavior of formal volunteering.\nThe goal of this study was to assess whether specific\nactivities are likely to cluster together and, if so, whether these\nclusters have conceptual meaning, especially with respect to\nwhether the activities are complementary or in competition with\none another and whether the activities are considered to be\ndiscretionary or obligatory. We also explored how personal\ncharacteristics, such as age, gender, race, functional status, and\neconomic status, are associated with the likelihood of being in\nspecific clusters of productive activity.\nMETHODS\nData\nWe took the data for this study from the ACL survey, a\nnationally representative panel survey with a multistage area\nprobability sample design. This survey collected information\noversampling for Blacks and individuals older than 60. For the\nLCA, the data were not weighted. However, for the multi-\nnomial logistic regression analysis, the data were weighted. For\nthis study, we used data from Wave 1 (1986). We focused on\nmiddle-aged and older adults aged 55 and older. Throughout\nthe survey, there were very few missing values (except for\nincome, for which 11.4% of cases contained missing infor-\nmation). In cases where missing data were present, the survey\nstaff at the Institute for Social Research (University of\nMichigan) employed a variety of techniques to impute values.\nOur study used the cleaned and imputed variables as re-\ncommended by the survey staff (House, 2003). The final study\nsample size was 1,896, which included all individuals in the\nsample aged 55 and older.\nThe ACL survey was appropriate for this analysis because (a)\nit includes information on a wide range of productive activities\n(including amount of time given to the activities), (b) we may\ncompare our results to the existing large number of studies that\nhave also used these data, and (c) the database includes a useful\nset of controls. Thus the ACL data are among the best available\nfor a study like this one. We based our assessment of the\nunderlying structure of productive activity on reports of partic-\nipation in these activities, as well as hours spent engaging in\neach activity annually. We evaluated both dimensions of these\nactivities because each tells us something different about these\nbehaviors. Participation in productive activities, such as volunteer-\ning for an organization or helping a neighbor, even if only\nsporadically, has important social and individual benefits. We\nassert that amount of time engaged in each activity implies\na level of commitment to the activity. Competition among activ-\nities is more likely to occur when multiple activities involve\nheavy time demands.\nMeasures\nWe included five measures of productive activity to\ninvestigate the latent structure underlying these observed\n(manifest) behaviors: paid work, volunteering, caregiving,\ninformal helping, and home maintenance. Table 1 contains\nthe relevant verbatim survey items. We defined paid work as\nemployment in the labor market for pay. Based on reported\nhours worked, we grouped paid work into three categories: 0 \u00bc\nnone; 1 \u00bc 1 to 1,999 hr (low, considered part-time work where\nrespondent worked, on average, less than 40 hr per week for 50\nweeks); 2 \u00bc 2,000 hr or more (high, considered full-time work\nwhere respondent worked, on average, 40 hr per week or more\nfor 50 weeks). In preliminary analyses, we examined other\nstrategies for categorizing work hours (e.g., 35 hr per week\nrepresenting full-time work). The coefficients from the LCA\nchanged very little, and the substantive interpretation of the\nrelationships among the productive activity variables remained\nthe same (results available upon request).\nVolunteering included committing time to schools, religious\ngroups, political entities, senior centers, and other organizations\nsuch as hospitals. Caregiving included helping or arranging for\nhelp for someone with a physical or mental illness, disability, or\nsome other health issue. Informal helping included providing\noccasional assistance to friends, neighbors, and relatives with such\nactivities as transportation and running errands. Home mainte-\nnance included doing home and auto repairs, as well as gardening\nand yard work. These types of home maintenance activities were\nsometimes more concentrated among men than women (86.5%\nand 71.3%, respectively, in our study sample). We considered\nusing housework as an indicator of productive activity. More than\n93% of our study sample engaged in this activity, and preliminary\nanalysis demonstrated that including this activity in the LCA did\nnot help to discriminate among respondents with respect to\nclustering of activities. Thus, we did not include this activity in our\nanalyses. ACL respondents reported hours spent over the previous\n12 months in volunteering, caregiving, informal helping, and\nhome maintenance in five categories. Because of the presence of\nsome small sample sizes for some categories, we reduced the\n(low); 2 \u00bc 200 hr or more (high). The ACL data include only\nbroad categories of time commitment to these activities, which\nlimited our measurement options.\nAfter estimating the latent class cluster model (see below),\nwhich resulted in a classification of individuals into one of sev-\neral types of activity patterns, we investigated whether specific\ndemographic, social, economic, and health characteristics were\nrelated to the likelihood of being in one of the productive activity\ntypes. We included age in these models, collapsed into three\ngroups: 55 to 64 (reference group in regression analysis), 65 to\n74, and 75 years old and older. We measured gender as female (1)\nand male (0). Race was White (1) and non-White (0). We cate-\ngorized marital status as married (1) or not married (0). We\ndichotomized education into high school education or more (1)\nand less than a high school education (0). Family income\nbased functional status on a dichotomous variable indicating\nwhether the respondent reported having difficulty with one or\nTable 1.

The most common productive activity reported in\nour sample of middle-aged and older persons was do-it-yourself\nhome maintenance (77.8%), followed by informal helping\n(68.3%). The least common activity was providing or arranging\nfor care for persons with chronic mental or physical health\nproblems (18.7%). Approximately one third of individuals aged\n55 and older engaged in paid work or volunteering. The mean age\nof the sample was 67.3 years, with a majority of respondents\nbeing female, White, and married, and reporting at least a high\nschool education. Only one third reported an annual family\nreported at least one limitation with activities of daily living.\nAnalytic Strategy\nWe investigated the underlying structure of productive\nactivity with an exploratory model based on LCA to determine\nempirically whether a typology existed regarding the clustering\nof home-based and community-based activities (Vermunt &\nMagidson, 2002). LCA is related to more common forms of\ncluster analysis (e.g., K-means) but has the added advantages of\nassigning individuals to classes based on probabilities estimated\nfrom the model and providing model fit statistics for choosing\namong models. LCA is less restrictive than other forms of\ncluster analysis in that it does not assume linearity, normally\ndistributed data, or homogeneity of variances. A key assump-\ntion is that the classes estimated from the models have local\nindependence; that is, within each class, the indicators are\nassumed to be independent of each other. This is another way\nof saying that the latent variable explains why the observed\nindicators are related to one another. (For a more detailed\ndiscussion of the statistical underpinnings of latent class cluster\nmodels, see Vermunt & Magidson, 2002.) The basic model is\nf \u00f0yi\n\u00de \u00bc\nX\nk\np\u00f0x \u00bc k\u00def \u00f0yi\njx \u00bc k\u00de; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere yi\nis a vector of dependent or endogenous indicators for\ncase i, x is a nominal latent variable, and k denotes a class (k \u00bc\n1,2,. . .,K). We identified the best fitting model and interpreted\nthe specific clusters from this model through an examination of\nthe conditional probabilities (similar to factor loadings in factor\nanalysis). We employed Latent Gold 3.0 software to estimate\nthe LCA models (Vermunt & Magidson, 2003).\nTo describe further the structure of productive activity, we\nestimated multinomial logistic regression models using the\ncovariates described earlier. This allowed us to demonstrate\nhow a set of common personal characteristics was associated\nwith the probability of location in one of the latent classes of\nproductive activity. We do not argue here that this is an\nexhaustive model; we include this analysis for descriptive\npurposes. We adjusted standard errors of the regression\ncoefficients to account for the complex sample design of the\nACL by employing the SVYMLOGIT routine in STATA 8.1.\nRESULTS\nThe first task was to identify a best fitting LCA model.\nPreliminary analysis showed that in one instance the assump-\ntion of local independence was violated. Evaluation of bivar-\niate residuals indicated that volunteering and working for pay\nwere likely to be directly associated with each other instead\nof indirectly through the latent class (violating the principle of\nlocal independence). This was possibly due to the influence of\nan unobserved variable or measurement error in the original\ndata. Consequently, we estimated a restricted LCA allowing\nvolunteering and working for pay to have direct effects on one\nanother. To identify the best fitting model among a group of\nlikely models, it was necessary to consider several parameters.\nTable 3 presents the parameters for this task.\nWe evaluated four parameters for choosing a model that best\nrepresents the latent structure of productive activity: p value,\nlikelihood ratio (L2) and degrees of freedom (df), Bayesian\nInformation Criteria (BIC) estimate, and classification error. An\nevaluation of these statistics showed that a one-cluster model\ndid not fit the data. The rule of thumb for choosing the best\nfitting model is that the p value be greater than .05, the\nlikelihood ratio and degrees of freedom be close in value, the\nBIC be small compared to other models with p values greater\nthan .05, and the classification errors be relatively low\ncompared to the other viable models. Using this approach, we\nfound that the best fitting model (and the most parsimonious)\nTable 2.

SD \u00bc standard deviation.\nThe four clusters (or classes) of the model required both a\nlabel and interpretation on the basis of the dominant activity\ncomponents contained within each, identified by the strength\nof the conditional probabilities (see Table 4). As with naming\nfactors in a factor analysis, labeling clusters in a LCA represents\na certain level of subjectivity. Fornaming these clusters, we relied\non an inspection of the conditional probabilities to show which of\nthe activity types and amounts of time given to the activities\ndominated in the specific cluster. The first productive activity\ncluster, which we labeled helpers, contained 46.1% (unweighted\nlatent class probability) of the cases. An inspection of the con-\nditional probabilities indicated that persons in this cluster were\nlikely to commit a moderate amount of time to volunteering\nand informal helping activities, as well as to participate in home\nmaintenance activity with a very low likelihood of participation\nin caregiving or paid work. The second productive activity\ncluster, home maintainers, contained 35.4% of the respondents.\nPersons in this cluster showed a modest likelihood of partic-\nipation in home maintenance/do-it-yourself activities (e.g.,\nyard work, auto maintenance, gardening) and a very low likeli-\nhood of participation in the other forms of activity. In fact,\nthe probability that persons in this latent class cluster participated\nin do-it-yourself home maintenance was lower than the prob-\nability for persons in the other clusters, and a subset of these\npersons did not report participation in any of the five activities\nconsidered here.\nWe labeled the third cluster worker/volunteers; it contained\n14.9% of the middle-aged and older respondents in our study\nsample. These persons demonstrated a moderate likelihood of\nparticipation in paid work, a high likelihood of participation\nin informal helping with a relatively high amount of time\ncommitted, a moderate likelihood of participation in volunteer-\ning (formal helping) with a low amount of time committed, and\na high likelihood of participation in do-it-yourself activities\naround the home with a low amount of time committed. These\npersons showed a low likelihood of participating in caregiving\nactivities. We labeled the fourth cluster of productive activity\nsuper helpers; this cluster contained 3.6% of the respondents.\nInspection of the conditional probabilities indicated that per-\nsons in this class demonstrated a high likelihood of participa-\ntion in informal helping with a high level of time commitment,\na moderate likelihood of participation in caregiving at a high\nlevel, a moderate likelihood of volunteering, and a high\nprobability of participation in do-it-yourself home maintenance\nactivities. These persons also showed a low probability of\nengagement in paid work.\nTo further investigate the latent structure of productive\nactivity, we report the results of a multinomial logistic regres-\nsion model (see Table 5), demonstrating which individual\ncharacteristics were associated with the likelihood of being in\na particular cluster (home maintainers served as the reference\ngroup). We discuss only statistically significant effects. Net of\nthe other variables in the model, increasing age was related to\na lower likelihood of being in the helpers, worker/volunteers, or\nsuper helpers clusters as compared to the home maintainers\ncluster. Women were more likely than men to be in the home\nmaintainers versus the worker/volunteers cluster. Whites were\nmore likely than non-Whites to be in the helpers or super\nhelpers clusters as compared to in the home maintainers cluster.\nMarried persons and persons with higher education were more\nlikely than nonmarried persons and persons with lower\neducation, respectively, to be in the helpers cluster as compared\nto the home maintainers cluster. Compared to persons in the\nhome maintainers cluster, persons with access to higher family\nincome were more likely than persons with lower family\nincome to be in the helpers, worker/volunteers, or super helpers\nclusters. Finally, having at least one limitation with activities of\ndaily living increased the likelihood of being in the home\nmaintainers cluster as compared to being in either the helpers or\nworker/volunteers clusters.\nIn Figure 1, we present predicted probabilities for each of\nthe four clusters of productive activity for three age groups,\nTable 3.

This approach demonstrates how the likelihood of\nbeing in one of the four productive activity types is age graded.\nThe predicted probabilities were based on results from the\nmultinomial logistic regression model reported in Table 5. The\nreference person was a White woman with at least a high school\neducation who was married with an income less than $25,000\nand no reported limitations in functional status.\nThe figure reinforces the findings from Table 4: The most\ncommon cluster of productive activity was helpers, and the\nleast common was super helpers. The figure also shows that the\nprobability of being in the helpers cluster was highest for\na ``typical'' respondent who was 65 to 74 years old, whereas the\nprobability of being in the home maintainers cluster was highest\nfor those who were 75 years old and older. The probability of\nbeing in the worker/volunteers cluster or in the super helpers\ncluster was highest for a person who was 55 to 64 years old.\nThere was a clear pattern of linear age grading (decreasing with\nage) in terms of the likelihood of being in the worker/volunteers\nor super helpers clusters, whereas age grading was also present\nfor home maintainers but in the opposite direction (increasing\nwith age). For the helpers cluster, the effect was curvilinear,\nwith the greatest likelihood of being in this group among those\nTable 5.

LCA showed\nthat a four-cluster model captured the underlying relationships\namong the productive activity indicators; the clusters included\nhelpers, home maintainers, worker/volunteers, and super help-\ners. The model indicated that activities like work and\nvolunteering are complementary, at least for some persons\n(worker/volunteers); this finding is consistent with the current\nliterature (e.g., Wilson & Musick, 1997b). Persons in this\ncluster combine obligatory and discretionary activities, imply-\ning to a degree that these are nonetheless complementary\nactivities. Also, engaging in formal volunteering and informal\nvolunteering (helpers), two discretionary activities, was com-\nmon. Interestingly, a small group of persons appeared to be\nheavily engaged in assisting others in productive ways (super\nhelpers). These persons seemed to mix obligatory and\ndiscretionary activities and did so with a fairly high level of\ntime commitment. Further study of persons in this group may\nfind that they have unusually high motivation to help others\ncombined with the resources necessary to act on this motivation\n(e.g., economic well-being).\nOur results show evidence of age grading related to location\nin specific productive activity classes. On the one hand, the\nresults demonstrate a compression, or reduction, of partici-\npation in three types of activity clusters (helpers, worker/\nvolunteers, and super helpers) as persons move from middle\nage to later life. On the other hand, the results for the home\nmaintainers cluster show that the likelihood of being in this\ngroup increases with age. To elaborate, we turn to the selective\noptimization with compensation theory of successful aging\nintroduced by Paul and Margaret Baltes (Baltes & Baltes,\n1990). This theory posits that as people age, they experience\nreductions in biological, mental, and social reserves (with the\nlevels of reduction being variable across individuals). Older\npersons adapt to this reality by reducing the number of domains\nin which they function. Our findings showed that participation\nin clusters of activities composed of activities outside the home\ndecreases as people get older and that participation in the\ncluster defined by activity around the home increases as people\nage. We believe this pattern provides some partial support for\nthe adaptive strategies predicted by the Baltes's selective\noptimization with compensation theory framework. Further\nresearch should determine if a similar latent variable of pro-\nductive activity varies in the number of activity classes across\nthe life course (e.g., analyses may yield evidence of different\nproductive activity clusters by major life course stage).\nMore generally, the field needs a better understanding of how\nolder people use their time and what factors drive these choices.\nImproved understanding of the time use of older individuals\nmay also help to shed light on their roles in the community. A\npreference among some older people to operate at a slower\npace, for example, may substantially narrow the range of activ-\nities that they carry out. If older persons prefer to devote more\ntime to basic living tasks (such as home maintenance), they\nhave less time available for other activities, such as volunteer-\ning. Furthermore, a preference for flexibility in use of time\nmay account for a reluctance to take on structured activities\nthat involve a regular commitment of time over an extended\nperiod. Preferences for certain types of activity, based in part\non the meaning of the activity to the older person, likely influ-\nence the decision to participate in a given set of activities.\nThis is related to socioemotional selectivity theory, which hy-\npothesizes that as persons age they make conscious choices\nto focus on activity that provides maximum emotional grati-\nMore research is needed on the preferences of elders in\nresponding to competing opportunities and the influence of\ntheir sense of obligatory versus discretionary behaviors.\nEarlier we alluded to the fact that people often engage in\nmultitasking, allowing them to participate in more than one\nactivity in an almost simultaneous manner. It is possible, for\nexample, for a person to pick up a medical prescription for an\ninfirm neighbor on the way to taking a grandchild to a medical\nappointment and then on the return from the doctor's office to\npick up political pamphlets at a politician's headquarters to be\ndistributed upon return within the person's neighborhood. One\nerrand combines three forms of productive activity. This may be\none way in which some productive activities are functionally\ncomplementary to one another. Furthermore, engagement in\nmultitasking behavior is increasing over time, and the in-\ntroduction of new technology (e.g., cell phones, handheld\ncomputer devices) makes this form of activity even more likely\nnow (and in the future) than may have been possible at the time of\nthe ACL survey. It may be informative to determine if productive\nactivities cluster in the same way over historical periods of time.\nIt is important to replicate this study with different data\nsources, along different points in the adult life course, and for\na different range of productive activity indicators to determine if\nthese yield a similar typology. LCA is a powerful technique for\nthis type of research, but the results may vary in important ways\nunder varying research design strategies. Given the presence of\nan underlying latent structure of productive activity, it would be\ninformative to determine in future research efforts if a latent\nvariable of productive activity predicts variability in the many\ndomains of well-being in later life. Researchers could make use of\nour findings to generate simple indexes of productive activity by\ncombining information about type of activity and amount of time\ncommitment. Scholars could then use these indexes to evaluate\na range of outcomes related to general well-being among the\nmiddle-aged and older populations.\nBoth personal resources and cultural background may guide\nexperts' understanding of the productive activities in which older\npersons choose to engage. Researchers are beginning to study the\nways in which productive activity may be related to various\ndimensions of well-being (e.g., Chou & Chi, 2002; Glass,\nMendes de Leon, Marottoli, & Berkman, 1999; McIntosh &\nhave shown how physical and social activity influence positive\noutcomes in the later stages of the life course (e.g., Bassuk,\nGlass, & Berkman, 1999). A brief list of research questions that\nneed to be addressed includes the following: To what degree are\nclusters of productive activity associated with better (or worse)\nmental and physical health? For example, are super helpers more\nor less likely than home maintainers or worker/volunteers to\nreport high levels of self-rated health or life satisfaction? Are the\nbenefits (or detriments) of being in one productive aging cluster\nversus another the same for different race and ethnic groups,\ndifferent birth cohorts, or different social classes? To what degree\nare clusters of productive activity associated with differential\nopportunities that result from community characteristics? In\naddressing these questions, researchers will need to account for\nthe endogeneity and reciprocal causation that may exist between\nclusters of activity and health. Researchers may also need to take\ninto account the interrelationship between socioeconomic status\nand residential location.\nThe data used for this study, although substantively appro-\npriate, were 20 years old. It is possible, even likely, that a\nsimilar analysis of more recent data would yield different re-\nsults given changes over time in technology (e.g., cell phones)\nand lifestyles (e.g., telecommuting). With the increase in the\npace of everyday life, persons of all ages are likely to be\nengaged in a broader array of productive activities. Thus, the\nage of the ACL data may limit generalization of our findings to\ntoday's middle-aged and later life populations.\n"
