Thus, much attention has been\npaid to the blockade of the tumoral AT1 receptor as a novel\nmolecular-targeted therapy. Olmesartan is a novel, strong\nand long-acting AT1 receptor antagonist. It is speculated\nthat olmesartan might have capacity for the inhibition of\ncell growth and cell proliferation.6 These studies create the\npotential mechanism that olmesartan can suppress the\nangiogenesis and cell proliferation in cervical cancer.\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs\nthat play a prominent role in tumor genesis, differentiation\nand proliferation. miRNAs regulate gene expression by\nbinding to 3' untranslated region (UTR). These genes are\ninvolved in a variety of biological cell processes. Current\nstudies showed that miRNA acts as an oncogene or tumor\nsuppressor gene in all kinds of cancer. miR-21 is one of the\nwell-understood onco-miRNAs that promotes cancer pro-\nliferation, invasion and inhibition of tumor apoptosis by\ntargeting programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), phosphatase\nand tensin homolog (PTEN), B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2\n(BCL2), tropomyosin 1 (alpha) (TPM1), tumor protein P53\n(P53), and the transforming growth factor beta (TGF )\nmiR-205 mediates the inhibition\nof cervical cancer cell proliferation\nusing olmesartan\nZhang Yue1,*, Zhang Yun-shan1,* and Xue Feng-xia2\n Keywords\nOlmesartan, miR-205, VEGF-A, cervical cancer, proliferation\nTianjin Central Hospital of Gynecology Obstetrics, Tianjin 300052,\nChina\nDepartments of Gynecology and Obstetrics,Tianjin Medical University\nGeneral Hospital, Tianjin, China\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\nCorresponding author:\nXue Feng-xia, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Tianjin\nOriginal article\n2 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nfamily.7\u00ad9 miR-10b can also promote tumor invasion of\nbreast cancer.10 Previous studies have shown that miR-205\nis a tumor-suppressing onco-miRNA. In human prostate\ncancer, miR-205 shows anti-tumor function by targeting\nprotein kinase C.11 Further, miR-205 inhibits breast cancer\nproliferation and promotes renal cancer cell apoptosis.12\nVEGF is a member of the platelet-derived growth\nfactor (PDGF)/VEGF group. VEGF-A is a glycosylated\nmitogen that specifically acts on endothelial cells and has\nvarious effects, including angiogenesis and vasculogenesis.\nPrevious studies indicate that VEGF is a positive regulator\nof tumor growth that promotes tumor migration and inva-\nsion, and inhibits tumor apoptosis.13\u00ad15 It can be secreted\nby tumor cells acting on the endothelial cells of existing\nblood vessels to promote new blood vessel formation.\nOverexpression of VEGF has been detected in almost all\nhuman cancers investigated, such as glioma, prostate, lung,\nbreast, renal, ovarian, and colorectal cancers.16\u00ad21 Therefore,\nVEGF is considered a potential therapy for cancer.\nIn the current study, olmesartan exhibited a high anti-\nproliferation activity against cervical cancer. It was also\nfound that olmesartan could promote miR-205 expression\nand inhibit VEGF-A expression. In addition, knocking\ndown miR-205 and overexpression of VEGF-A can modu-\nlate the olmesartan sensitivity of cervical cancer. This result\nprovides a new mechanism of olmesartan anti-tumor effect.\nMaterial and methods\nCell culture and olmesartan treatment\nHeLa and Siha cells were purchased from the American\nType Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA) and grown\nin Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 with\n10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco). All cultures were main-\ntained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5%\ncarbon dioxide. Olmesartan (2.0 mM, Daiichi Sankyo\nPharmaceutical) was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide just\nbefore use. The cells were cultured with and without Ang\nII (0.1 M) or olmesartan at the time of seeding to examine\nolmesartan influence on cervical cancer cells.\nQuantitative reverse transcription-polymerase\nchain reaction (qRT-PCR)\nQuantification of miR-205 expression levels was assessed\nvia qRT-PCR using specific TaqMan\u00ae assays according to\nthe instructions of the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems).\nU6 RNA was used as normalizer.\nProliferation assay\nThe transfected cells were seeded in 96- or six-well plates\n2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was\nperformed to test cell proliferation. For clonogenic assay,\ncells were plated at a final concentration of 200 cells/ml.\nColonies were counted after staining the cells with 0.1%\ncrystal violet within 10 days after plating. Each experi-\nment was conducted in triplicate.\nInvasion assay\nCell invasion assay was performed using Transwell cell\nculture inserts (Corning). Cells (1 \u00d7 105) were cultured\nonto a Matrigel-coated membrane matrix present in the\nthe end of incubation, the noninvasive cells were removed.\nInvasive cells were fixed, stained with crystal violet, and\nphotographed under microscope.\nDNA construction\nacids (LNA), and control LNAwere synthesized by Shanghai\nGenepharma Co. Ltd. (China). VEGF-A-specific short hair-\npin RNAs (shRNAs) were generated using oligonucleotide\nannealing and inserted into pSilencer 2.0 upon BamHI/\nHindIII restriction. The shRNA sequence was as follows:\nGTTGCAAGTCTCTTGAACTTGCAACGCGAGTCTG\nTGCG-3'. VEGF-A CDS and full-length VEGF-A with tar-\nget 3' UTR fragment were obtained from HEK293 cell\ncDNA library and constructed into pcDNA3.1 plasmid\nusing BamHI/EcoRI restriction. The primers of VEGF-A\nCDS were as follows:\nThe primers of full-length VEGF-A with target 3' UTR were\nas follows:\nwas synthesized and inserted into pmirGLO luciferase\nplasmid using PmeI and XbaI restrictions.\nWestern blot\nCells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis\nbuffer containing proteinase inhibitors (Roche). Whole-cell\nlysates were analyzed using Western blot with anti-VEGF-A\nYue et al. 3\npolyclonal antibody (Abcam) at a ratio of 1:1000 after being\nsubjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel\nelectrophoresis. The expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phos-\nphate dehydrogenase (GADPH) was used as a loading con-\ntrol and was detected using an anti-GADPH polyclonal\nantibody (Abcam). Enhanced chemiluminescence method\nwas used to determine protein expression.\nStatistical analysis\nAll data in the current study were evaluated using SPSS\n16.0 (SPSS Inc, USA). Data were presented as mean \u00b1\nSEM and were compared by Student t test or analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA) followed by a post-Student\u00adNewman\u00ad\nKeuls (SNK) q test as appropriate. Differences were con-\nsidered significant at p < 0.05.\nResults\nEffect of olmesartan on VEGF-A and miR-205\nexpression exposed to Ang II in cervical cancer\ncells\nHeLa and Siha exposed toAng II for 24 hours significantly\nincreased cell VEGF-A expression and decreased miR-205\nexpression compared with control cells (p < 0.05). After\nolmesartan treatment, HeLa and Siha VEGF-A expression\nwas significantly upregulated (p < 0.05).

In the current study, results indicate the dys-\nregulation of miR-205 in cervical cancer cells treated by\nolmesartan. Genes involved in cancer anti-drug progress\ninclude oncogene and anti-tumor genes.Although miRNAs\nare small non-coding RNAs, they can control tumor gene-\nsis, proliferation and differentiation by regulating cancer-\nrelated genes. Previous studies have shown that miR-20a\ncontributes to chemotherapeutic resistance in colorectal\nadenocarcinoma by targeting BCL2 interacting protein 2\n(BNIP2).24 High expression levels of miR-21 contribute to\nbreast cancer drug resistance of Trastuzumab.25 In the pre-\nsent study, upregulation of miR-205 in cervical cancer cells\ntreated with olmesartan was compared with untreated cells.\nIn addition, VEGF-A as a target gene of miR-205 was vali-\ndated using luciferase reporter assay. Overexpressions of\nmiR-205 and knockdown of VEGF-A contributed to olme-\nsartan-induced anti-tumor effect on cervical cancer cells.\nAlthough early studies by Xie and Ma26,27 showed that the\nexpression of miR-205 was higher in cervical cancer tissue\nand cell lines ME-180, C4I and CaSki, while low expres-\nsion/barely detectable levels were found in HeLa, SW756,\nSiHa and C33A. This was similar to our results.\nSeveral in vivo and in vitro studies have revealed that\nrenin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors had anti-\ntumor properties.28,29 Antiangiogenic drugs (ADs) are\none of the key components of frontline therapy in cur-\nrent combination regimens for the treatment of various\nhuman cancers. Clinical experiences gained from han-\ndling different types of cancers demonstrate that ADs,\nsuch as sorafenib, bevacizumab, and sunitinib, in combi-\nnation with chemotherapy, often produce significant but\nmodest survival benefits.30,31 These clinical findings\nhave raised several important issues regarding the bene-\nficial mechanisms of antiangiogenic therapy in cancer\npatients.32\u00ad34 In the current study, olmesartan inhibits\ntumor cell invasion, and it also has the capability to\nFigure 5.

Further studies have shown\nthat through miR-205, olmesartan can regulate VEGF-A\nexpression. They also suggest that VEGF-A may be a\nregulation target of miR-205, which reveals more about\nthe molecular mechanism of olmesartan as an AD.
