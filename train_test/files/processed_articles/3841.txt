Laypersons Interpret\nHigh Lie Scale Scores as Reflecting Intentional\nDishonesty: Rejoinder to de Vries et al.'s\n Keywords\nlie scale, impression management, honesty, dishonesty, truth\nIntroduction\nThere is an ongoing debate regarding what lie scales measure.\nLie scales, sometimes referred to as impression management,\nother deception, or the gamma factor scales, are associated with\nmixed and confusing findings that make it difficult to interpret\nhow well they capture honesty or what aspects of personality\nthey reflect (Uziel, 2010). Traditionally, lie scales were con-\nstructed to measure deceit for appearing more socially desir-\nable. Later accounts interpreted high scores on lie scales as\ncapturing aspects of response styles and personality traits. The\n\"defensiveness approach\" argued lie scales are capturing\ndefensiveness of the self, reflecting distortions in self-\nevaluations and avoidance of social disapproval (Crowne,\n1979). The \"adjustment approach\" considered high lie scale\nscores as reflecting healthy social functioning, and such\nresponse styles as representing individuals who emphasize\nsocial adjustment and coexistence with others in society. This\nevolving debate exemplifies the different interpretations regard-\ning lie scales and lying. Do lie scales indeed capture lying, as\ntheir title suggests, or perhaps lie scales have been completely\nmisunderstood and misinterpreted and are actually measuring\nsomething else altogether, possibly even measuring honesty?\nThis debate has recently reemerged with a commentary cri-\nticizing the use and interpretation of a lie scale as a measure of\nhonesty in a study of the relationship between profanity and\nhonesty (Feldman et al., 2017). In the first out of three studies,\nmy colleagues and I found that two behavioral and one self-\nreported measures of profanity had a negative relationship with\nlie scale score using the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire\nRevised (Eysenck, Eysenck, & Barrett, 1985), and based on the\noriginal premise of these scale and a large body of supporting\nevidence (e.g., Davis, Thake, & Weekes, 2012) our interpreta-\ntion of this evidence was that those who were higher on pro-\nfanity use were more honest. De Vries et al. (2017) had\nstrong objections to this interpretation and summarized recent\nevidence that suggests lie scales capture honesty, rather than\ndishonesty. They therefore interpreted our evidence to mean\nthat \"honest people tend to use less--not more--profanity\"\n(commentary title). They concluded by calling for a\n1 Department of Psychology, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong\nSAR\n2 Department of Work and Social Psychology, Maastricht University,\nMaastricht, The Netherlands\nCorresponding Author:\nGilad Feldman, Department of Psychology, University of Hong Kong, Hong\nKong, Hong Kong SAR.\nEmail: gilad.feldman@maastrichtuniversity.nl\nSocial Psychological and\nPersonality Science\nReprints and permission:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\njournals.sagepub.com/home/spp\n\"moratorium on the use of lie scales as measures of deception\nand dishonesty\" (p. 5).\nIn Table 1, I briefly address the main points in the commen-\ntary. In the target article, we called for further debate and\nempirical evidence and cautioned against drawing strong con-\nclusions, and I am happy to see further evidence on the topic.\nYet, the commentary's accompanying criticism is often mis-\nplaced or unwarranted, the evidence suggestive, and the strong\nconclusions premature. In this reply, I focus on the main criti-\ncism--that high lie scale scores cannot be interpreted as\nreflecting dishonesty. I argue that the debate on lie scales is far\nfrom conclusion, and much more needs to be clarified and\nexamined regarding lie scales and honesty. I first review weak-\nnesses in the arguments against interpreting lie scales as dis-\nhonesty, and I then provide strong experimental evidence\nshowing that laypersons understand and interpret high lie scale\nTable 1. Brief Responses to the de Vries et al. Commentary Critics.\nCommentary Arguments Response\n\"People who use profanities, both online and off-line,\nmay feel exonerated by the study.\"\nThe comment's use of \"exonerated\" and the opening note seems to reflect a\nstance against profanity as being a negative behavior. We were cautious to\nrefrain from any positive or negative judgment of profanity or its users.\n\"Political representatives may even be stimulated to\nincrease their use of profanities hoping that it may\nincrease the public's perception of their integrity.\"\nThe target article did not address or discuss impressions of honesty.

We used one self-reported measure of profanity and two behavioral\nmeasures of profanity.\nRecent evidence has indicated that an interpretation of\nimpression management scales as reflecting less\nhonesty is fundamentally flawed\nThe recent evidence has not questioned previous evidence as being flawed but\npresented new evidence about links between impression management scales\nand other factors that is suggestive of a different interpretation.\n\"If impression management (or lie) scales actually did\nmeasure lying on items such as `Do you always\npractice what you preach?' the correlation between\nself-ratings and ratings obtained from knowledgeable\nothers would have to be negative.\"\nTwo issues with this assumption:\n(1) the very purpose of impression management is to affect impressions in\nothers,\n(2) people are very bad at detecting lies, and there is ample evidence that close\nothers are even more biased and easily deceived (e.g., McCornack & Parks,\nTherefore, self-other agreements are not a good measure of objective truth.\n\"Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (BIDR)\nimpression management scale (Paulhus, 2002),\nstrongly correlated (e.g., r \u00bc .61; Davies, French, &\nKeogh, 1998) with, and similar in content to, the Lie\nI welcome reporting of related evidence, yet note that the target article did not use\nthe BIDR nor the Davies et al.

See the general\ndiscussion.\nI welcome reporting of related evidence, yet caution that the evidence provided\nis suggestive, as the profanity measure is confounded with the impression\nmanagement scale (BIDR) and was not meant to measure profanity.\nThe commentary authors complained about the target's Study 2 construct\nvalidity but make very strong claims using a redefinition of a single item from an\nunrelated scale typically used for a different purpose using data archive not\noriginally collected for the purpose of the intended profanity-honesty\ninvestigation.\nLastly, a correlation of \u00c0.09 using a problematic self-reported profanity proxy\nmeasure against an unethicality proxy for group aggregates based on\nprobabilities estimations (25%) should--at best--be interpreted with caution\nand followed by further research before drawing strong conclusions.\n\"In summary, the above findings strongly suggest that the\nconclusions of Feldman et al.

Finally, I discuss implications for the lie scale and\nhonesty literatures and suggest directions for integration.\nLie Scales and Honesty\nLie scales measure unlikely answers to extreme statements\nsuch as in answering \"yes\" to \"are all your habits good and\ndesirable ones?\" or answering \"no\" to questions such as \"have\nyou ever said anything bad or nasty about anyone?\" (Eysenck\nthose who answer yes\u00adno to the questions above--for whatever\nreason--are most likely being deceitful, possibly in service of\nsome purpose or reflecting certain traits.\nThere is an ongoing debate regarding the meaning of lie\nscales, and the question of what lie scales or impression man-\nagement measures capture is still in debate (Uziel, 2010).\nScholars in the \"adjustment view\" (e.g., de Vries, Zettler, &\nZettler, Hilbig, Moshagen, & de Vries, 2015) have come to\nquestion the original premise of lie scales as measuring dis-\nhonesty and the \"defensiveness view\" (e.g., Davis et al.,\n2012) based on two types of correlational evidence. First,\nthey demonstrated that there is a positive correlation between\nlie scales and various measures of honesty, such as the\nHEXACO (Lee & Ashton, 2004) honesty-humility personal-\nity trait and measures of unethical behavior. Second, they\ndemonstrated high correlations between self-ratings and\nclose others' ratings of lie scales items. Both are important\ncontributions, yet they are not necessarily evidence against\nlie scales as representing dishonesty, and I explain further\nbelow.\nWhat Is Honesty? Discussion of Honesty Categories\nLie scales are at the intersection of two conflicting interpreta-\ntions of honesty--honesty that is meant to express true self, and\nhonesty that is meant to reflect coexistence with others in soci-\nety (Erickson, 1995; see related discussion in Feldman et al.,\n2017). Lie scales were designed to measure the sense of being\nhonest about and true to oneself, reflecting authenticity-\nhonesty. However, honesty trait measures, such as the\nhonesty-humility dimension of the HEXACO personality scale\n(Lee & Ashton, 2004), measure sincerity, fairness, greed-\navoidance, and modesty, all socially desirable and focusing\non social aspects of honesty in capturing attitudes toward\nmanipulation of others and toward blunt unethical behavior\nviolating social norms and laws. These types of honesty are\nvery different from authenticity-honesty. A suggested typology\nof the different types of honesty and examples from related\nscales are provided in Table 2.\nTo give an example for a possible misalignment, authentic-\nhonest persons could act unethically if their true selves are\nself-centered and deviate from the set norms. In such a case,\nTable 2. Honesty Measures Summary.\nMeasure Sample Items General Explanation Scale Example\nLie scale Are all your habits good and desirable ones?\nHave you ever said anything bad or nasty\nabout anyone?\nSocial desirability others-oriented deception Eysenck Personality\nQuestionnaire\nRevised (Eysenck\nHonesty-humility:\nsincerity\n\"If I want something from a person I dislike,\nI will act very nicely toward that person in\norder to get it\"\n\"I wouldn't use flattery to get a raise or\npromotion at work, even if I thought it would\nsucceed\"\n(1 \u00bc Strongly disagree; 5 \u00bc Strongly agree)\n\"Low scorers will flatter others or pretend to\nlike them in order to obtain favors, whereas\nhigh scorers are unwilling to manipulate\nothers\"\nHonesty-humility:\nfairness\nI would be tempted to buy stolen property if\nI were financially tight\nIf I knew that I could never get caught, I\nwould be willing to steal a million dollars\n(1 \u00bc Strongly disagree; 5 \u00bc Strongly agree)\n\"Low scorers are willing to gain by cheating or\nstealing, whereas high scorers are unwilling\nto take advantage of other individuals or of\nsociety at large\"\nUnethicality Participants roll a six-faced die under a cup with\na peeking hole only available to the\nparticipants.\nParticipants self-report the outcome.\nRewards are given based on rolls, presenting\nparticipants with an opportunity to\nmisreport results to gain higher rewards,\nwithout any risk of getting caught.\nBehavioral measure of lying for monetary gain. e.g., Die-under-cup\nparadigm (Shalvi,\nDana, Handgraaf, &\nNote. HEXACO-PI-R is the HEXACO Personality Inventory-Revised (Lee & Ashton, 2004), examining Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, eXtraversion, Agreeable-\nness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience.\na person may cheat but would answer more truthfully about\nhis cheating behavior. Similarly, persons can adhere to\nsocial-moral codes, yet in doing so may present themselves\ndishonestly or conform by doing things that they do not wish\nto do and would not admit to not wanting. In such a case, a\nsocially honest person may be insincere about own wants,\nneeds, desires, and emotions. It is therefore possible to differ-\nentiate between at least two types of honesty, a distinction that\nis not clearly mentioned or addressed in the lie scales debate.\nTherefore, studies examining authenticity-honesty and stud-\nies examining social-honesty are not necessarily studying the\nsame kind of honesty. Findings of lie scale showing a negative\nrelationship with unethical behavior or positive relationship\nwith honesty-humility traits do not necessarily mean that lie\nscales do not measure lying or that they may even measure\nhonesty. It is possible that lie scales simply capture a different\ntype of honesty.\nDemonstrating self-other agreement on lie scales is also\nproblematic as evidence against lie scales, since the very pur-\npose of impression management is to affect impressions in\nothers, and there is ample evidence that others are biased and\neasily deceived (e.g., McCornack & Parks, 1986; Levine &\nMcCornack, 1992). I return to this point in the discussion.\nThe Present Investigation\nIt is therefore important to directly examine whether lie scales\nindeed capture dishonesty and specifically test authentic-\ndishonesty as the type of honesty they were meant to assess.\nI take a different approach than that taken so far regarding lie\nscales. Rather than making assumptions about what laypersons\nmean when they refer to honesty and do when answering lie\nscales, or indirectly interpreting lie scales based on correlates\nor using self-other comparisons, my approach uses experimen-\ntal folk psychology methodology (Knobe et al., 2012; Knobe &\nin Turri & Turri, 2015) to more directly assess laypersons' cog-\nnition regarding honesty and lie scales.\nIn a preregistered experiment, I examined laypersons' inter-\npretations of high and low scores and scorers in terms of hon-\nesty to test (1) whether high- versus low-score answers are\nperceived as more or less honest answers and (2) whether per-\nsons with high versus low scores are perceived as more or less\nhonest people.\nExperiment\nPreregistration and Open Science\nI preregistered the experiment on the Open Science Frame-\nwork and data collection was launched later that day. Prere-\ngistration, power analyses, and all materials are available in\nthe Online Supplementary Materials and shared along with\ndata and code on the Open Science Framework (https://\nosf.io/7gnfe/).\nParticipants\nA total of 302 American Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)\nparticipants (Mage\nrecruited online using TurkPrime.com (Litman, Robinson, &\nAbberbock, 2017). MTurk participants have considerable\nexperience in taking part in surveys and experiments, and I\ntherefore expected that some may have taken the lie scale\nbefore. To prevent any possible biases, I preregistered the\nexclusion of participants who indicated that they were famil-\niar with or have taken the scale before. I excluded 40 partici-\nSDage\non the results (full results reported in the Online Supplemen-\ntary Material).\nProcedure and Measures\nThe experiment included three parts. The first part was a\nwithin-subject experiment with each participant rating two lie\nscale answer profiles--a high score on the lie scale and a low\nscore on the lie scale (see Table 3).

These results were consistent across rating high and\nlow lie scale scores independently and contrasts in a compari-\nson of the two answer profiles. Finally, laypersons endorsed the\ninterpretation that high lie scale scores reflect lower honesty\nand rejected the interpretation that high lie scale scores reflect\nhigher honesty.\nThese findings support the original premise of lie scales as\ncapturing dishonesty for socially desirability. These calls to\nquestion the very strong statements made about lie scales as\nclearly not reflecting dishonesty, mainly based on correlates\nwith other factors and self-other agreement (de Vries et al.,\nthe need for a more complex and nuanced understanding of lie\nscales than the clear-cut conclusions by de Vries et al. (2017),\narguing that lie scales most definitely do not reflect dishonesty.\nFurthermore, laypersons viewed high lie scale scores as reflect-\ning a clear understanding of the items, a clear strategic agenda\nin answering, and intentional dishonesty, contrary to the\nuntested argument that laypersons process the \"spirit or gist\nof the item [ . . . ] rather than exact wording\" (De Vries et al.,\nTable 4.

Scales: 1 \u00bc Extremely unlikely; 7 \u00bc Extremely likely.\nWhich raises the question--why would there be a negative\nrelationship between lie scales and measures of honesty-\nhumility traits and ethical behavior? There are two possible\nexplanations, and both could be relevant. The first, as sug-\ngested in the introduction, is that lie scales capture a different\ntype of honesty than that measured by honesty-humility traits\nand unethicality measures. I will not reiterate this point, but I\ncall scholars to differentiate between the types of honesty and\nto clearly identify which type of honesty they aim to capture\nand by what measure, noting the generalizability of their find-\nings, as we have in the target article. If we are to accept the pos-\nsibility of different types of honesty, then it is likely that those\nwith high lie scale scores are high on authenticity-honesty and\npossibly low on the social-honesty.\nThe second explanation is that the methodological approach\nin assessing honesty reflected by lie scales using traits and\nself-other agreements has limitations in evaluating\nauthenticity-honesty that lie scales were originally meant to\nassess. Measuring honesty about oneself presents scholars with\na unique challenge. Take, for example, the paradoxical dilemma\nembedded in lying self-reports (e.g., Halevy, Shalvi, &\nwho self-report themselves as liars honest about lying? Are peo-\nple who self-report to being honest lying to appear honest? How,\nthen, do we assess whether such self-reports about lying are hon-\nest? One approach taken by personality scholars was to examine\ncorrelates between such self-reports and various individual dif-\nferences and behaviors. This approach would be useful to the\nextent that the correlated factors indeed capture the same\nconstruct, yet honesty-humility may not capture the same con-\nstruct. A second approach was to assess self-other agreements.\nYet again, such an approach also embeds a paradox. If the very\npurpose of impression management is to create more positive\nimpressions in others, then how would asking about others'\nimpressions behelpful?The assumption ofthatapproach was that\nclose others are likely to know a person well and their opinions\nwould therefore reflect an objective truth, yet ample research has\nshown that people are generally bad at detecting and correcting\nfor deception or for impression management and that close others\nare evenmoreeasilydeceivedandare generallymorebiased(e.g.,\nothers are frequently lied to, even if lying is merely meant to pro-\ntect them and their feelings, and are often surprised when learning\nthatcheatingor deceit has taken place (Drouin,Tobin,& Wygant,\nby reactions to admissions of partners faking sexual interest,\npleasure, or experience in close romantic relationships (e.g.,\nAn integration of the findings regarding lie scales is possible\n(1) with a typology of types of honesty with a clear and careful\nuse of the term and (2) by recognizing and addressing the lim-\nitations of the correlates and self-other agreement approaches\nin understanding honesty-authenticity and lie scales. To suc-\ncessfully achieve such integration, further studies are needed,\nemploying different methods and including measures for the\ndifferent types of honesty.\nAn integration would also require an explanation of findings\nfor a negative relationship between lie scales and honesty-\nhumility or unethicality. Why would moral people lie about\nwho they are? First, moral people may self-justify lies for\nsocial-moral reasons and may therefore even come to perceive\nsuch lying as acceptable or needed. Violations of morals and\nhonesty are deemed acceptable if they can be easily justified\n(Shalvi, Gino, Barkan, & Ayal, 2015), especially if allegedly\nserving others (Gino, Ayal, & Ariely, 2013), and can help\nreduce ethical dissonance between the moral-self and dishonest\nbehavior (Barkan, Ayal, & Ariely, 2015). Conformity to social\nmoral norms may serve as a powerful reason for justifying\nwhite lies to the extent that such a lie could even be seen as\nmoral. Second, moral people are more sensitive to others'\nviews, behaviors, and criticism and tend to put others' concerns\nabove their own. As such, they are more likely to engage in\nimpression management to influence others' perceptions of\nthem as being more moral, social, and positive.\nConclusion\nThose high on lie scales are perceived to be less honest about\nwho they are and their true selves, challenging the criticism that\nlie scales cannot be reflective of dishonesty and that laypersons\ndo not perceive answers reflecting high lie scale scores as\nlying. The debate on lie scales and honesty demonstrates the\ncomplexity of defining and examining honesty. This raises the\nneed for (1) a typology of honesty categories (e.g., differentiat-\ning between authenticity-honesty and social-honesty), (2) a\nclear identification of the type of honesty assessed or refer-\nenced in empirical studies, and (3) further research to better\nunderstand honesty and the relationships between honesty cate-\ngories. The novel folk psychology empirical approach used in\nthis investigation can be used to further examine laypersons'\nhonesty perceptions and behavior.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nSupplemental Material\nThesupplemental material isavailable intheonlineversionofthe article.\nReferences\nBarkan, R., Ayal, S., & Ariely, D.
