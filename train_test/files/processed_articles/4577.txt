The Health Belief\nModel was used to explain differences in beliefs about influenza vaccination among at-risk individuals resistant to influenza\nvaccination. Survey data were collected from 74 members of at-risk groups who were not vaccinated for influenza during the\nprevious flu season. Accepting individuals were more likely to perceive flu as a threat to health and perceive access barriers,\nand cues to action were the most important influence on whether they plan to get vaccinated. In comparison, resistant\nindividuals did not feel threatened by the flu, access barriers were not a problem, and they did not respond favorably to\ncues to action. Perceived threat, perceived access barriers, and cues to action were significantly associated with plans to be\nvaccinated for influenza in the next flu season. Participants who saw influenza as a threat to their health had 5.4 times the\nodds of planning to be vaccinated than those who did not. Participants reporting barriers to accessing influenza vaccination\nhad 7.5 times the odds of reporting plans to be vaccinated. Those responding positively to cues to action had 12.2 times\nthe odds of planning to be vaccinated in the next flu season than those who did not.

Health beliefs strongly influ-\nence whether someone engages in a simple, voluntary health\nbehavior like obtaining an annual influenza vaccination.\nUnfortunately, unvaccinated individuals who would benefit\nfrom the vaccine's protection hold health beliefs that under-\nmine efforts to achieve targeted vaccination rates.\nIt has been estimated that approximately 80% of the U.S.\npopulation are members of a special at-risk group that the\nAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) rec-\nommends for priority vaccination (Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention, 2010). Because the proportion of the\npopulation considered at risk is so large, since 2010, the\nACIP has recommended universal vaccination of everyone 6\nmonths of age and older. However, only 39% of the U.S.\nadult population was vaccinated for influenza during 2011-\nPublic health has had some success in reaching people who\nare most receptive to vaccination. Public health's primary\nfocus has been on people 65 years of age and older, which is\nthe group most likely to receive a vaccination. This age group\nvaccination rates for other priority groups were much lower.\nAmong those with a high-risk condition, such as asthma, only\ncan transmit the virus within the health care system, were vac-\ncinated (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010).\nAlthough vaccination rates have varied within a narrow\nrange in the United States over the last few years, rates have\nnot improved dramatically among any group for more than a\ndecade. Rather than simply increasing intervention efforts\nthat have proven to work in the past with receptive individu-\nals (Briss et al., 2000), public health must now develop and\nadopt new strategies to interest those who are indifferent or\nresistant to vaccination efforts. It should not be assumed that\nincreasing the intensity or reach of recognized best practices\nthat have worked among the most receptive will be effective\nin reaching the less willing and the least receptive.\n1University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma, USA\n2University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City,\nOklahoma USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMarshall K.

The Health\nBelief Model (HBM) can be used to understand beliefs and\nperceptions about influenza vaccination and guide the choice\nof interventions for people indifferent or resistant to influ-\nenza vaccination. According to the HBM, individuals are\nmore likely to get vaccinated for influenza if they think they\nare susceptible to influenza, think influenza is a serious con-\ndition, believe influenza vaccination would reduce their sus-\nceptibility to influenza or make influenza symptoms less\nsevere, do not think the flu shot has excessive personal costs\nand the benefits of vaccination outweigh those costs, and are\nconfident in their ability to obtain a vaccination (Rosenstock,\nPerceived susceptibility is the belief in personal vulnera-\nbility to influenza. Previous studies have established that\npeople who had been vaccinated for influenza were more\nlikely to see themselves at higher risk for influenza than the\nunvaccinated, whereas those who were not vaccinated for\ninfluenza saw themselves as unlikely to contract influenza\n& Cobler, 2004; Nowalk, Zimmerman, Shen, Jewell, &\nZimmerman, Santibanez, et al., 2003). However, two studies\nhave shown that individuals resistant to influenza vaccina-\ntion are concerned about the susceptibility of vulnerable\nfamily members, and were willing to get vaccinated to pro-\ntect the health of someone they cared about (Bardenheier\nPerceived severity refers to an individual's belief about\nthe seriousness of influenza and its consequences. This\nincludes physical health and social consequences such as\nability to work and maintain family and social relationships.\nAccording to the HBM, perceived severity is particularly\nimportant when susceptibility beliefs are high. However,\nresearch has shown that perceived severity alone was not a\nsignificant predictor of influenza vaccination (Armstrong,\nBerlin, Schwartz, Propert, & Ubel, 2001; Blue & Valley,\nple, whether vaccinated or unvaccinated, saw it as a serious\nillness, particularly for someone their age (Chi & Neuzil,\nPerceived threat refers to an individual's joint perceptions\nof susceptibility and severity. Beliefs in susceptibility and\nseverity must be high before influenza is seen as a serious\nthreat to personal health (Brewer & Rimer, 2008).\nPerceived benefit refers to an individual's belief in a range\nof potential benefits of obtaining a flu vaccination. One of\nthe most important benefits is the effectiveness of the vacci-\nnation in a given year to reduce the risk or seriousness of\ninfluenza. Several studies have found that perceived effec-\ntiveness of the vaccine is one of the most consistent predic-\ntors of influenza vaccination (Brewer & Hallman, 2006;\nChapman & Coups, 1999; Prislin, Dyer, Blakely, & Johnson,\nPerceived barriers are an individual's belief about the\nphysical and psychological costs of getting vaccinated for\ninfluenza. Those who are resistant to vaccination are more\nlikely to report experiencing vaccination side effects or get-\nting sick from the influenza vaccination (Armstrong et al.,\nZimmerman, Santibanez, et al., 2003). Previous research has\nalso documented knowledge barriers (Gosney, 2000; Lindley\nthe safety of the influenza vaccination (Allison et al., 2010;\nadults who doubted the effectiveness of the vaccine and a\nthird (37%) of those who thought the vaccine causes illness\nwould still agree to get a vaccination to protect others\nCosts and benefits: Research has shown that, regardless\nof vaccination status, people see vaccination as entailing\ncosts and benefits. Those who were not vaccinated com-\nmonly acknowledged some benefits to vaccination, but, on\nbalance, saw more costs than benefits (Bardenheier et al.,\nSelf-efficacy refers to an individual's confidence in his or\nher ability to successfully get vaccinated. Few studies related\nto influenza vaccination have looked directly at the role of\nself-efficacy, perhaps because vaccination is a simple, time-\nlimited behavior that does not require lifestyle adjustments\nor changes to complex health behaviors such as adhering to\nan exercise program or eating a healthier diet (Brewer &\ninfluenza vaccination, self-efficacy does not appear to be an\nimportant determinant of influenza vaccination among adults\nCues to action are environmental prompts to activate an\nindividual's readiness to seek a vaccination. Considered a\ntrigger to take action within the HBM, it is the link between\nbelief and behavior. Health care provider recommendation\nhas been associated with higher rates of influenza vaccina-\nfor those who are more accepting (Bardenheier et al., 2006;\n2006). Even for those who were resistant to influenza vacci-\nnation, a provider recommendation made vaccination more\nFamily members are considered another source of an\neffective cue to action (Nowalk et al., 2004; Zimmerman,\nCheney and John 3\nalthough not all studies found them to be influential (Mayo\n& Cobler, 2004). A belief that influenza vaccination is the\nwas also found to be an effective cue to action.\nExisting research provides relevant information about\nvaccine acceptance. However, it does not help as much if we\nwish to understand what influences the behavior of the\nunvaccinated. There is little information available about\nindividuals resistant to influenza vaccination. The objectives\nfor this study were to utilize the HBM as a framework for\nunderstanding beliefs surrounding indifference or resistance\nto influenza vaccination and to identify intervention points\nand messaging strategies to increase future vaccination rates\namong the unvaccinated.\nMethod\nThis formative research was based on survey data collected\nduring eight focus group discussions with 74 individuals\nfrom Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, that were conducted\nbetween March and June 2007. The purpose of the focus\ngroup discussions was to understand individual attitudes,\nbehaviors, and concerns about influenza vaccination and\nhow practitioners can improve influenza vaccination rates\namong resistant individuals. Results of the focus group dis-\ncussions are reported elsewhere (John & Cheney, 2008). The\nfocus of the present study is on the questionnaires that were\nadministered to the focus group participants.\nParticipants were eligible to participate in the study if\nthey were a member of a population group whose influenza\nvaccination rates were lower than the general population\nand/or were members of identifiable high-risk groups\n(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010), includ-\ning ethnic minority, low socioeconomic status, and chroni-\ncally ill adults. Additional inclusion criteria were age above\n30 and to not have received an influenza vaccination during\nA purposive sampling strategy was used to recruit indi-\nviduals in high-risk groups who had not received an influ-\nenza vaccination in the past year. Participant recruitment\ninformation was distributed through a wide variety of com-\nmunity sources to increase representativeness of the sample,\nincluding local businesses, community centers, local clinics,\ndistribution lists from local community coalitions and ser-\nvice organizations, libraries, and grocery stores. A signed\ninformed consent was obtained from each person before par-\nticipation in the study and each participant received a US$30\nstore gift card at the end of the session.\nEvery participant filled out two questionnaires, one at the\nbeginning of the focus group discussion and the second fol-\nlowing the discussion. Each questionnaire took approxi-\nmately 10 min to complete. The first questionnaire contained\nquestions about basic demographic information and social\ncharacteristics, past and anticipated flu vaccination behavior,\nhealth status and conditions, and work or caregiving respon-\nsibilities that would place them in contact with vulnerable\ngroups (chronically ill, children, or elderly).\nThe second questionnaire collected health belief informa-\ntion about influenza vaccination that is important in under-\nstanding what influences and issues may be important in\ngetting reluctant individuals to get a flu shot. The 45 ques-\ntions in this questionnaire were based on previous research\nof influenza vaccination assessed in adult populations\nveys except Prislin et al. (1998) was developed for adults 65\nyears of age or older. The Prislin et al. questionnaire was\ndeveloped for adults who had a child aged 2 to 24 months\nliving at their home.\nTo test the HBM, the analysis incorporated variables that\nspecified the main constructs of the model: perceived sus-\nceptibility (1 variable), perceived severity (3 variables), per-\nceived benefits (9 variables), perceived barriers (23\nvariables), and cues to action (4 variables). Although self-\nefficacy is now routinely added to the HBM, it is not needed\nto understand simple health behaviors like obtaining an\ninfluenza vaccination (Brewer & Rimer, 2008; Champion &\nBecause of the large number of independent variables\nused to specify the HBM constructs, factor and/or reliability\nanalyses were conducted on the perceived benefits, per-\nceived barriers, and cues to action variables. For each of the\nconstructs with a large number of variables (perceived ben-\nefits and perceived barriers), a principal axis factor proce-\ndure with varimax rotation was run to identify latent variables\nand reduce the number of independent variables that would\nbe used in the multivariate logistic regression analysis.\nBecause the number of cases with missing values was small,\nmissing values were replaced with the mean. After the fac-\ntors were identified, a reliability analysis was conducted on\nthe perceived benefits and barriers subscales. All data analy-\nPerceived Benefits Scale\nA principal axis factor procedure with varimax rotation was\nrun using the nine perceived benefits. The final solution\nresulted in a factor that contained the following five vari-\nables: \"I am willing to get a flu shot if I were sure it pre-\nvented the flu,\" \"I would get the flu shot to stay healthy,\"\n\"Getting a flu shot is a wise thing to do,\" \"I would get a flu\nshot to prevent spreading the disease to people close to me,\"\nand \"I would rather have a flu shot than get the flu.\" Analysis\nestablished that the measure of sampling adequacy was very\ngood (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin [KMO] = .86) and the model\nfit the data well. Reponses were summed across the five\n4 SAGE Open\nvariables to create a perceived benefits scale. The scale was\nadditive and highly reliable (Cronbach's  = .90).\nPerceived Barriers Scales\nA principal axis factor procedure with varimax rotation was\nrun using the 23 perceived barriers. The final solution\nresulted in four factors and analysis established that the mea-\nsure of sampling adequacy was adequate (KMO = .79) and\nthe model fit the data well. The first factor, which we labeled\nAccess Barriers was composed of \"Doctors or clinics that\ngive the flu shot are hard to reach,\" \"Doctors/clinics that give\nthe flu shot are not open when I can get there,\" and \"It is dif-\nficult for me to find the time to get a flu shot.\" This three-\nitem scale had very good reliability (Cronbach's  = .84).\nThe second barriers scale, Perceived Harm, was composed of\n\"The flu shot causes a person to get the flu,\" \"Serious side\neffects from the flu shot are common,\" and \"I worry about\nside effects from the flu shot.\" This three-item scale had ade-\nquate reliability (Cronbach's  = .74). The third perceived\nbarriers scale was composed of three variables: \"I wonder\nabout the safety of the flu vaccine,\" \"Flu shots are unneces-\nsary,\" and \"Healthy people do not need to get a flu shot.\" We\nlabeled this scale Belief Barriers. This three-item scale had\nmarginally adequate reliability (Cronbach's  = .69). The\nfinal perceived barriers scale was composed of \"I do not trust\na doctor's advice to get a flu shot,\" \"Getting a flu shot is\nmore trouble than it is worth,\" and \"I do not like the way doc-\ntors and clinic staff that give the flu shot treat me.\" This\nthree-item scale, which we labeled Mistrust, also had mar-\nginally adequate reliability (Cronbach's  = .66).\nCues to Action\nFour variables were use to construct a cues to action scale: \"I\nwould get a flu shot if my doctor or nurse recommended it,\"\n\"I would get a flu shot if my family wanted me to,\" \"News of\na bad flu season would influence me to get the flu shot,\" and\n\"I am willing to get both pneumonia and flu vaccines at the\nsame time if my doctor recommends it.\" None of these vari-\nables contained missing values. This four item scale had\nexcellent reliability (Cronbach's  = .88).\nTo identify significant independent variables that were\nnot included in one of the benefits or barriers subscales,\nbivariate correlations were calculated to determine whether\nany of the variables that were not included in one of the\nscales was associated with the two dependent variables\n(whether the respondent plans to get a flu shot next year and\nwhether they never ask their doctor or nurse for the flu shot).\nThis resulted in the identification of an additional benefit\nvariable and two barrier variables that were included in the\nlogistic regression analysis. The relatively small sample size\nplaced constraints on the logistic regression analysis.\nTherefore, all the independent variables used in the analysis\nwere dichotomized at the median.\nResults\nCharacteristics of Focus Group Participants\nAs seen in Table 1, participants ranged in age from 30 to 75\nyears, with a mean age of 49.3 years. Two thirds of the par-\nticipants (66.2%) were women. More than two thirds of the\nparticipants were non-Hispanic White (36.5%) or African\nParticipants tended to be highly educated with approxi-\nmately one third having obtained a college degree (16.2%), a\ngraduate or professional degree (16.2%), or some college\nTable 2 documents the self-reported health status, behav-\niors, and resources of the participants. The vast majority of\nparticipants were in good or excellent self-rated health,\nappraise their health as about the same (41.9%) or better\nAmong the participants, 73% said they have a usual place of\nhealth care.\nNone of the participants got an influenza vaccination dur-\ninfluenza vaccination next year. This information was col-\nlected before the focus group discussion began, so the\nresponse was not influenced by the information or opinions\nexpressed by the group.\nHBM\nTable 3 shows the level of agreement of participants who\nwere accepting and resistant to influenza vaccination for\neach of the major constructs of the HBM.\nPerceived susceptibility.Table 3 documents that resistant\nindividuals did not believe they were susceptible to the flu.\nWhereas 74% of resistant individuals agreed with \"I don't\nthink I'm likely to get the flu,\" only 38% of accepting indi-\nviduals agreed.\nPerceived severity. Three items assessed beliefs in the sever-\nity of influenza for self and vulnerable others. Many resistant\nindividuals did not perceive influenza as a serious illness for\nsomeone their age. Participants were somewhat more likely\nto perceive influenza as a serious illness for children, and\nthere was general agreement that influenza is a serious illness\nfor the elderly. However, the intensity of these beliefs differed\nbetween resistant and accepting individuals. Responses to \"I\ndon't think I am likely to get the flu\" (perceived susceptibil-\nity) were reverse coded and multiplied by \"Flu is a serious\nillness for someone my age\" (perceived severity) to create a\nperceived threat variable (Champion & Skinner, 2008).\nPerceived benefit.Nine items measured beliefs about the\nbenefits of influenza vaccination. Accepting individuals\nwere far more likely than resistant individuals to strongly\nCheney and John 5\nendorse each of the five items in the perceived benefits scale.\nDifferences between groups in the other four items were less\npronounced, but resistant individuals were less likely to\nfavorably perceive the endorsement of vaccination by health\ncare personnel or relatives and friends, were less sure that the\nvaccine does not cause the flu, and did not believe that flu\nshots prevent the flu.\nPerceived barriers.The 23 perceived barriers comprised\nthe largest number of independent variables. Table 3 reveals\nthat accepting individuals were more likely to perceive\naccess barriers to vaccination than resistant individuals. In\ncontrast, resistant individuals were more likely to endorse\nthe issues that comprise the Perceived Harm, Belief, and\nMistrust barriers.\nCues to action.As seen in Table 3, accepting individuals\nwere more likely to respond favorably to each of the cues to\naction. What is clear from these results is that family mem-\nbers were not a significant influence on resistant individual's\nvaccination behavior and apparently were less influential\nthan recommendation by a physician, especially among the\nmost intensely resistant.\nLogistic regression analysis.Tables 4 and 5 document the\nresults of the logistic regression analysis using the HBM\nconstructs to predict whether an individual plans to get a flu\nshot next year and whether they would ask a doctor or nurse\nfor a flu shot. In the unadjusted model for plans to get a flu\nshot next year (Table 4), all the main HBM constructs were\nsignificant. This is what would be predicted by the HBM and\nconfirms a general finding in the literature. Three barriers,\naccess to vaccination, belief that the vaccination will cause\nharm, and negative beliefs about flu vaccination were sig-\nnificantly associated with plans to be vaccinated for influ-\nenza in the next flu season.

In the\nadjusted model, only perceived threat, perceived access bar-\nriers, and cues to action were significantly associated with\nplans to be vaccinated for influenza in the next flu season.\nPeople who saw influenza as a threat to their health had 5.4\ntimes the odds of planning to be vaccinated than those who\ndid not see influenza as a threat to health. Those who reported\nbarriers to accessing influenza vaccination had 7.5 times the\nCheney and John 9\nodds of reporting plans to be vaccinated, documenting that\naccepting individuals perceive barriers to obtaining vaccina-\ntion while resistant individuals do not. Finally, those who\nresponded positively to cues to action had 12.2 times the\nodds of planning to be vaccinated in the next flu season than\nthose who did not respond positively to the cues.\nBased on the final model, accepting individuals were\nmore likely to perceive flu as a threat to health (perceive they\nwere susceptible and that flu is a serious illness), access bar-\nriers were a problem that negatively influences their vaccina-\ntion behavior, and cues to action were the most important\ninfluence on whether they plan to get vaccinated. In com-\nparison, resistant individuals did not feel threatened by the\nflu, access barriers were not a problem because they were not\ntrying to get vaccinated, and they did not respond favorably\nto cues to action from any source.\nA discriminant analysis was run to determine how well\nthe final model predicted group membership. The discrimi-\nnant analysis confirmed that these three variables discrimi-\nnated well between the two groups. The canonical correlation\nwas .64 and 83.3% of cases were correctly classified using\nthe cross-validation procedure in SPSS. In contrast to a pre-\nvious study (Blue & Valley, 2002), this model was better at\npredicting group membership especially among resistant\nindividuals (84%) compared with accepting individuals\nIn the first panel of Table 5, the unadjusted model reveals\nthat each of the main HBM constructs was significantly\nrelated to asks doctor or nurse for a flu shot. Only Access and\nMistrust barriers were not significant. However, once all the\ninfluences of the HBM constructs were taken into consider-\nation using the same procedure as the previous analysis, only\ncues to action were independently related to asking for a\nflu shot.\nDiscussion\nThis study reveals that accepting and resistant individuals\nhave significant, determinant differences in their health\nbeliefs about influenza vaccination. These differences begin\nwith diametrically opposed views of their susceptibility to\nthe illness and the severity of influenza as a personal health\nproblem. Furthermore, these divergent health beliefs extend\nto opposing views of the benefits of obtaining a flu vaccina-\ntion, with accepting individuals subscribing to much more\nfavorable opinions of the vaccine. More differences are evi-\ndent when barriers are considered. Access is only a problem\nfor those who intend to obtain a flu shot, so improving access\nwill not matter for resistant individuals. Accepting individu-\nals perceive access barriers while resistant individuals do\nnot. In comparison, resistant individuals perceive harm, have\nnegative health beliefs about the vaccine, and are somewhat\nmore mistrustful of medical care. Finally, cues to action posi-\ntively influence accepting individuals while resistant indi-\nviduals ignore or actively dismiss these messages.\nThese results have profound implications for the prospect\nof improving influenza vaccination rates in the United States.\nOur results show that more of the recommended interven-\ntions or more intense or improved techniques that support\nthese interventions will only succeed in marginal improve-\nments in the influenza vaccination rates and will continue to\nfall well short of targeted vaccination goals advanced in\nAlthough more research is needed to gain an in-depth\nunderstanding of the population that is unresponsive or\navoids annual vaccination, this research has established that\nit is a distinctly different population than the one that has\nbeen reached successfully so far. This research suggests that\nthe pivotal issues that need to be addressed are within the\nPerceived Benefits and Perceived Barriers parts of the HBM.\nCues to action will not have any influence unless basic per-\nceptions are modified to shift neutral or negative beliefs in a\nmore positive direction. Our research has shown that it is\nonly among receptive individuals that these social influences\nare successful. Moreover, we do not believe that a direct fear\nappeal will be effective in changing perceived threat which\nthe HBM considers essential because resistant individuals do\nnot believe influenza is a threat to their personal health.\nTable 5. Predictors of Asks Doctor or Nurse for Flu Shot.\nHBM construct Adjusted odds ratio 95% CI Significance\nPerceived barriers\nFinal model\nNote: HBM = Health Belief Model.\nResistant individuals will not obtain a seasonal influenza\nvaccination to protect their health and any attempt to appeal\nto their sense of personal vulnerability will not succeed.\nOther evidence suggests that resistant individuals are con-\ncerned about the health of elderly relatives and children and\nan appeal to their altruism is more likely to succeed (John &\nCheney, 2008). In this case, health provider recommendation\nmay be more effective if the cue to action is to reduce the\nthreat to significant others rather than themselves.\nAdditional Strategies to Increase Influenza\nVaccination\nThe HBM focuses on the individual and their self-regarding\nbehaviors, but individual behavior change is difficult to initi-\nate and sustain without acknowledging and changing the sur-\nrounding social environment. Future studies could examine\nthe effectiveness of interventions structured around the\nEcological Model (McLeroy, Bibeau, Steckler, & Glanz,\n1988), targeting family and social networks, organizations,\ncommunity, and policy, to increase vaccination rates in this\npopulation. Asking resistant individuals to accompany fam-\nily members to be vaccinated to ensure they received their\nvaccination, then being vaccinated themselves to increase\nthe protection for vulnerable family members is one strategy\nto increase vaccination rates. Asking businesses and commu-\nnity organizations to vaccinate their employees during work\nhours would help accepting individuals overcome access\nbarriers. In addition, working with health insurance compa-\nnies to waive the co-pay for influenza vaccination or to\nexpand coverage to more providers during vaccination sea-\nson to allow accepting individuals more flexibility in time\nand place to be vaccinated may also help to increase rates.\nThese ideas address access issues and are unlikely to alter the\nbehavior of indifferent or resistant individuals. Resistant\nindividuals need better knowledge about the vaccine that dis-\npels misperceptions and fears, and messaging touting the\nbenefits of being vaccinated to protect the health of signifi-\ncant others (especially the elderly and children).\nHBM Limitations\nThese results document that the HBM is a useful framework\nfor understanding differences between those individuals who\nare accepting and resistant to influenza vaccination, but it\nhas limitations. Research has shown that past vaccination\nbehavior is one of the strongest predictors of future influenza\nvaccination (Armstrong et al., 2001; Brewer & Hallman,\nexplicitly incorporated into the HBM. Chapman and Coups\n(1999) suggested the influence of past behavior is partly\naccounted for by perceived effectiveness of the vaccine,\nalong with the likelihood of side effects, so that individuals\nwould be more likely to be vaccinated if their previous expe-\nrience suggested that the vaccine was effective in preventing\ninfluenza and caused no or few side effects. In the absence of\na positive personal experience with the flu shot, beliefs\nregarding the flu shot (whether well-founded or nonrational)\nwill be the primary determinant of behavior.\nTo determine the influence of past experience on intent to\nobtain a flu shot, the sample was divided into three groups:\nthose who never had a flu shot and did not intend to get one\nnext year (the Never/Nots), individuals who ever received a\nflu shot and did not intend to get a flu shot the next year (the\nEver/Nots), and individuals who had received a flu shot\nbefore and intended to get one next year (Accepting). A\nseries of cross-tabulations of group by HBM variable\nrevealed that the biggest differences are between the Never/\nNots and the Accepting group. This analysis revealed that\nindividuals in the Accepting group are true believers in the\nflu shot. They have few doubts about the merits of being vac-\ncinated. The Never/Not group is the mirror image of the true\nbelievers, exhibiting a substantial negative consensus about\nthe problems with flu vaccination. In general, the Ever/Not\ngroup is intermediate with mixed perceptions of the flu shot,\nbut more like the Never/Nots than Accepting individuals.\nFrom the standpoint of the HBM, the individuals who are\nmost resistant to influenza vaccination have no personal\nexperience on which they base their perceptions.\nAnother deficiency of the HBM is that it assumes that\nhealth behaviors are the result of concern for one's own\nhealth. However, this research provides additional evidence\nthat this is a weak motivation for indifferent or resistant indi-\nviduals who appear to be more willing to be vaccinated in\nresponse to the health threat to vulnerable others (John &\nCheney, 2008). Engaging in a health behavior based on altru-\nistic beliefs of a health threat to others is not adequately\naccounted for in the model. For this particular health behav-\nior, an altruistic appeal to protect the health of significant\nothers may be the only appeal that will make a difference to\nresistant individuals.\nThe HBM represents health beliefs as static and research\nusing the HBM is overwhelmingly cross-sectional, looking\nat health beliefs at one point in time. Our research is consis-\ntent with this approach. However, we do not have an indica-\ntion of how stable these beliefs are over time, taking into\naccount vaccine effectiveness from year to year, the increas-\ning age of the individual, and increasing media coverage of\ninfluenza outbreaks such as H1N1. On the other hand, for\nmany individuals, strongly held beliefs are difficult to\nchange. No research has established the extent to which\nbeliefs about influenza vaccination can be modified for\nresistant individuals. If they are difficult to change, the\nHBM loses some of its utility and is not as useful as an\nalternate model such as Social Marketing, which has a pri-\nmary focus on changing behaviors based on precisely tar-\ngeted appeals to specific audience segments that have\ndifferent beliefs and attitudes toward the health behavior. In\na sense, this research confirms the existence of distinct\naudience segments with different psychographics toward\nthe behavior.\nStudy Limitations\nAs an exploratory research project based on a purposive\nsampling strategy, the primary limitation of this study is the\nsmall sample size. Every precaution was taken to minimize\nthis problem, including data reduction, analysis of measures\nof sampling adequacy, using binary variables, and limiting\nthe number of independent variables in the multivariate\nlogistic regression models. However, a larger sample size\nwould have improved the data reduction process and\nstrengthened the formation of the HBM scales and the multi-\nvariate logistic regression results.\nA potential secondary limitation is that the sample was\nnot a random sample and the results may not be generaliz-\nable to the population of individuals who are indifferent or\nresistant to seasonal influenza vaccination. This limitation\nwas intentional and unavoidable because few studies have\nsought to understand the health beliefs of the majority of\nAmericans who fail to get a seasonal influenza vaccination\non a regular basis. The indifferent or resistant population is\nthe population that needs to be the subject of influenza vac-\ncination research.\nAnother potential limitation raised by one reviewer is\nthe questionnaire's placement after the focus group discus-\nsion. Although it is possible that the focus group discussion\ninfluenced questionnaire responses, the influence should\nhave been minimal or beneficial for our purpose. Focus\ngroup discussions are meant to allow participants to fully\nconsider their views and compare them with the views of\nothers on a particular topic and then be able to offer an\ninformed opinion in contrast to the instantaneous, top-of-\nthe-mind initial reaction required by most survey research.\nIf anything, the focus group discussion helped participants\ndevelop a refined opinion about their beliefs and attitudes\ntoward influenza vaccination.\nConclusion\nAccepting and resistant individuals have significantly dif-\nferent beliefs toward influenza vaccination that require dif-\nferent intervention strategies to increase vaccination rates.\nThis research provides important information to research-\ners and practitioners by focusing interventions on different\nconstructs of the HBM to increase influenza vaccination.\nAccepting individuals need better access, fewer barriers,\nmore effective cues to action, and messages that heighten\ntheir sense of personal susceptibility. Although necessary,\nthese features of an influenza vaccination intervention will\nonly result in marginal improvements in vaccination rates\nbecause these features are not seen as important by\nindifferent and resistant individuals. Resistant individuals\nneed to be convinced that there is a reason for them to prac-\ntice a behavior that they do not view favorably or for which\nthey do not see a need because they do not view influenza\nas a threat to their health. To increase vaccination among\nresistant individuals, this research suggests the need to\naddress a number of health beliefs such as worry about side\neffects and healthy people do not need a flu shot, and to\nexpand the HBM to include health behaviors done for altru-\nistic motives to protect the health of vulnerable loved ones.\nIn this case, the latter concern would not require resistant\nindividuals to change their beliefs about the vaccine, but\nstill practice the behavior.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research and/or authorship of this article: Partial funding for this\nproject was provided by the Oklahoma State Department of Health.\nReferences\nAllison, M.
