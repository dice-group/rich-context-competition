    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper aims to take a holistic approach to studying fear of crime by testing predictors at\nmultiple levels of analyses. Data from the European Social Survey (N = 56,752 from 29 countries)\nwere used to test and extend the Income Inequality and Sense of Vulnerability Hypotheses.\nThe findings confirm that (1) individuals in societies with greater income inequalities are more\nfearful of crime, and (2) older or disabled people as well as women report greater fear of crime.\nContrary to the hypotheses, ethnic majority and not ethnic minority members report greater fear\nof crime, if they reside in high income inequality countries. It is further demonstrated that fear\nof crime explains the inverse association between income inequality and subjective well-being in\nthis particular subsample.\n",

Not surprisingly, fear\nof crime research has become a central area of criminological investigation, as well as\na key focus of crime policy throughout the world (Brunton-Smith and Sturgis, 2011).\nDespite its international relevance and the descriptive empirical evidence that average\nlevels of fear of crime vary across countries (for example, Blinkert, 2010; Ceobanu,\nCorresponding author:\nChristin-Melanie Vauclair, Instituto Universit\u00e1rio de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL), Edif\u00edcio ISCTE, CIS-IUL, Avenidas\nEmail: melanie.vauclair@iscte.pt\nArticle\nempirical research that aims to explain why people feel more fearful in some countries\nthan in others.\nTo date, research has mainly focused on examining factors that may be associated\nwith fear of crime in a piecemeal fashion. These studies can be distinguished in regard to\nthe different levels of analyses that they address. Within the scope of individual-level\nstudies, the focus has been on examining individual-level predictors and consequences\nof people's fear of crime. Much research has been devoted to the vulnerability hypothe-\nsis, which stipulates that socio-demographic factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, and\nphysical disability are predictors of fear of crime since people who belong to these social\ngroups feel physically or socially vulnerable (Rader et al., 2012) and, therefore, at a\nhigher risk of victimization (see, for example, Pain, 2000). Others have emphasized the\nrole of (direct and indirect) victimization experience as an important factor in developing\nfear of crime (see, for example, Lane et al., 2014).\nFear of crime has wide-reaching consequences in regard to physical, psychological,\nbehavioural, and social effects (see Lane et al., 2014). It is detrimental to people's phys-\nical health and mental well-being and influences people's behaviour, for example by\nengaging in crime prevention strategies such as locking doors and not walking alone at\nnight. Although this may temporarily enhance a sense of security, it can also lead to\nsocial withdrawal and disengagement from activities in the community that are impor-\ntantly related to subjective well-being. Given that fear of crime is primarily a psychologi-\ncal phenomenon, its consequences should be most prominent at the psychological level.\nA great deal of individual-level research has indeed corroborated that fear of crime is\ndetrimental to people's subjective well-being (for example, Cohen, 2008; Hanslmaier,\nIn contrast to this individual-level research, the more sociological tradition has\nfocused on the wider social context in which individuals reside in order to explain their\nfear of crime (Brunton-Smith and Sturgis, 2011). Most of this research has used data\nfrom the United States (see Lane et al., 2014) and examined the effect of context on fear\nof crime at the meso-level in the form of neighbourhood or local community character-\nistics. Although these studies have advanced our understanding of how context factors\ncan explain variations in fear of crime, many of them are conditioned by the US context\nand do not provide any insights into macro-level variations in fear of crime. The few\nstudies that have examined fear of crime across macro-level units, such as nations, have\nfocused on examining either antecedents or consequences of fear of crime and mostly in\na rather atheoretical fashion (for example, Blinkert, 2010; Ceobanu, 2010; Hummelsheim\nanalysed predictors at both the individual and country level, they did not examine more\ntheory-guided multilevel models with mediating variables or how country-level factors\nmay moderate individual-level associations (so-called cross-level interactions).\nIn this paper, we aimed to test an influential theory in the social science literature that\nstipulates that income inequality yields a number of psychological issues, including a\ngreater fear of crime and worse subjective well-being. We tested this hypothesis by adopt-\ning a holistic perspective, that is, by examining both antecedents and consequences of fear\nof crime taking into account who is most vulnerable to this issue. In order to achieve this\naim, we used representative data from the European Social Survey across 29 countries.\nWe first tested the robustness of income inequality as a predictor of fear of crime and\nexamined it then as a cross-level moderator for individual-level associations with fear of\ncrime. The aim was to examine the vulnerability hypothesis in context, that is, whether a\ncontext of greater income inequality also renders vulnerable social groups more suscepti-\nble to fear of crime. We then analysed a mediation model in which fear of crime is speci-\nfied as the mediator for the income inequality\u00adsubjective well-being link. Throughout\nthese analyses, we used multilevel modelling techniques in order to take into account the\nclustered data structure and to reduce the probability of Type-I errors. We used the most\nrecent developments in multilevel structural equation modelling in order to conduct the\nmediation analyses (Preacher et al., 2011). By adopting this type of methodology, we are\nable to test a comprehensive theoretical model about the causes and effects of fear of\ncrime. To the best of our knowledge, a similar theoretical model has already been sug-\ngested elsewhere (Lorenc et al., 2012) but never tested with cross-national data yet.\nIncome inequality as an antecedent and moderator\nWilkinson and Pickett (2009) argued that income inequality is the most parsimonious\nexplanation for a host of social and health problems including the fear of crime. They\nshow that there is a strong and consistent association between inequality and violence\n(for example, in terms of homicides and assaults) across different time periods and set-\ntings and argue that inequality is a form of `structural' violence triggered through the\ngreat gap in income. From a socio-psychological point of view, inequality translates\ninto highly hierarchical societies in which the attainment of status becomes an impor-\ntant goal in individuals'lives. While status competition increases, the income gap makes\nit increasingly difficult for the poorer to obtain markers of status and social success (for\nexample, in terms of a good education, nice houses, good jobs). Ultimately, the response\nto this form of frustration and humiliation is violence, which in turn fuels the fear of\ncrime in the general population.\nThe authors also point out that people's fears of crime do not always match up with\nrates and trends in crime and violence. It is conceivable that income inequalities rather\nfoster a climate of fear because people believe that there are only a few legitimate chances\nfor the deprived to obtain resources and social status, leaving crime and violence as the\nmost obvious route. Consequently, the widely shared perception is that those who are\nmost deprived are potentially dangerous even if this does not always match the actual\nevidence. This perception should be heightened for those who belong to a social group\nthat is commonly seen as an `easy' crime target (we expand on this below).\nA few cross-national studies have indeed found that economic inequality is positively\nlinked with fear of crime (Hummelsheim et al., 2011; Vieno et al., 2013). The argument\nthat has been put forward is that income inequality signals less social protection by\nincreasing the general concern about the erosion of the social and moral order, resulting\nin greater fear of crime. Hence, fear of crime can also be seen as an `umbrella sentiment'\nthat expresses socio-economic insecurities rather than actual crime-related insecurities\nAlternative macro-level explanations\nBesides income inequality, there are other macro-level factors that may fuel people's fear\nof crime. Theorists within the sociological literature have long argued that a better under-\nstanding of variations in individual-level fear of crime requires incorporating the context\nin which individuals reside. Traditionally, these context variables are located at the meso-\nlevel by describing the neighbourhood and community characteristics in which individu-\nals live (for a recent review, see Lorenc et al., 2014). A great deal of research has been\ndevoted to studying meso-level factors, whereas very little research has examined the\nmacro-level context and its relation to fear of crime (Hummelsheim et al., 2011). This is\neven more surprising given that empirical evidence has shown that fear of crime varies\nacross countries. For instance, within Europe it seems that Southern and East European\ncountries as well as the United Kingdom show greater fear of crime (for example, Blinkert,\n2013; Visser et al., 2013). This opens up the question of which macro-level factors explain\nwhy individuals are more fearful of crime in some countries than in others.\nOne of the most obvious explanations is that greater crime rates should produce\ngreater fear of crime in the population. If individuals live in an environment that pro-\nvides them with information about crime rates, they should process this information\ninto their risk perceptions, leading to greater fear of crime (Lorenc et al., 2012). Yet one\nrecent macro-level study using cross-national data from the European region found that\nregistered crime rates actually had little explanatory power in explaining fear of crime\nOther common explanations centre on the argument that fear of crime is fuelled by\n(1) economic characteristics such as economic disadvantage (for example, Franklin\ntion concentration, which can trigger feelings of intimidation and threat posed by the\ncharacteristics such as social capital, which in its absence fuels fear of crime because\nthere is a lack of social monitoring that could deter crime (see Sampson, Raudenbush,\nand Earls, 1997) and rouse a sense of security in residents (for example, Ferguson and\nA few macro-level studies have examined these explanations using archival data with\nrepresentative samples from countries in the European region. What becomes clear is that\nthere is some ambiguity in regard to the operationalization of the economic disadvantage\nfactor. Some studies find a significant association between (un)employment and fear of\ncrime (for example, Hummelsheim et al., 2011), whereas others do not find this link (Visser\net al., 2013). Wealth did not emerge as a significant predictor of fear of crime in Ceobanu's\n(2010) study; however, social protection expenditures seem to be consistently predictive of\nRegarding the operationalization of structural characteristics such as immigration con-\ncentration, this has usually been assessed by the absolute or relative number of foreigners\nin a country. Some of the macro-level studies suggest that the size of the migrant population\nin a country is related to heightened fear of crime (for example, Ceobanu, 2010; Semyonov\net al., 2012), yet again other studies did not find this link at all (Visser et al., 2013).\nFinally, social capital can be examined as a social characteristic of countries predicting\nfear of crime. Although there is a lack of cross-national studies in this regard, meso-level\nstudies have shown that a lack of social capital arouses individuals' fear of crime.\nOverall, it is difficult to draw clear conclusions based on the few available studies\nbecause they all used different cross-national datasets from different sources (for exam-\nple, Eurobarometer, European Social Survey) and for different periods of time (from\n2002 to 2008). Moreover, given the different foci in each study, a number of covariates\nwere either included or not when assessing the impact of the macro-level context on fear\nof crime, which can also alter the results.1 In this study, we aimed to integrate previous\nresearch by testing whether income inequality holds as a predictor of fear of crime when\ncontrolling for relevant socio-economic, structural and social macro-level characteristics.\nHence, we hypothesized that:\nH1: Individuals living in countries with higher income inequality report more fear of crime\nthan individuals residing in low inequality countries even after controlling for alternative\nmacro-level explanations.\nPersonal vulnerabilities as micro-level predictors\nNumerous studies have sought to identify who is most fearful of crime and why this is\nthe case, and this has culminated in the Sense of Vulnerability Hypothesis (for example,\nCossman and Rader, 2011). The idea is that some social groups in society are more fear-\nful because they believe that they are at higher risk of victimization since they would be\nunable to defend themselves should a criminal attack occur.\nGender and age have been the most studied markers of physical vulnerability to fear\n(Hale, 1996; Killias, 1990). Although victimization rates are higher among males than\nfemales (Smith and Torstensson, 1997), the latter appear to be more fearful of crime\nbecause they feel less capable of physically defending themselves, they have lower per-\nceived self-efficacy, and they perceive themselves and their social group as more likely to\nbecome victims. This so-called victimization\u00adfear paradox has also been found to exist in\nrelation to age, where older people reported consistently higher levels of fear and worry\nabout crime and safety issues despite relatively low victimization rates in this age group\n(Hale, 1996). Their fear is again grounded in the perception of control over the event and\nthe subsequent consequences for themselves. Individuals who are physically impaired are\nanother social group that fits into this category (for a review, see Pain, 2000).\nAlthough gender and age have been widely studied in the fear of crime literature (see\nHale, 1996), the association between the level of reported physical limitations and fear\nof crime has been largely neglected (Taylor et al., 2009). Yet there is evidence that a\nphysical disability increases the likelihood of being a victim of crime (for example,\nRosen, 2006). One of the few studies examining this issue found that having a physical\ndisability was a significant predictor of fear of crime among young adults in the US\n(Stiles et al., 2003). Hence, the authors concluded that the physical vulnerability hypoth-\nesis is also applicable to those who report physical disabilities. They argue that individuals\nwith physical limitations may feel a sense of helplessness or vulnerability, and conse-\nquently fear to find themselves in actually or potentially harmful situations in which they\nhave limited behavioural options in regard to fleeing or protecting themselves (see also\nTaylor et al., 2009, for another study in the US). Pain (2000) also reports a study from the\nUnited Kingdom in which physical disability emerged as a marker for feelings of vulner-\nability and avoidance strategies in order to deal with fear of crime. Despite this scattered\nevidence, it is still not clear whether the association between physical disability and fear\nof crime occurs across different national contexts.\nBesides physical vulnerability characteristics (such as age, gender, and disability),\nthere are also social vulnerability characteristics (Rader et al., 2012) that have been\nargued to be important in determining one's fear of crime. One of the most prominent\nsocial vulnerability descriptors is race or ethnicity. The few studies that examined the\nrace\u00adfear relationship are predominantly from the US. In this context, researchers have\nfound that ethnic minorities were more fearful of crime than Caucasians (see Lane et al.,\n2014), which may be explained by the fact that ethnic minority groups show significantly\nhigher rates of victimization because of their racial or ethnic background (Pain, 2000).\nConsequently, they feel vulnerable to and fearful of racist attacks and harassment over\nwhich they have little control and which can lead to severe consequences. Studies from\nthe European countries show less consistent associations between ethnic minority mem-\nbership and fear of crime (Visser et al., 2013).\nIn this study, we will re-examine the vulnerability hypothesis in relation to age,\ngender, disability, and ethnic minority membership. We hypothesized that:\nH2: Females, ethnic minorities, older individuals, and individuals with a disability are more\nfearful of crime.\nWe also explore the joint effects of the vulnerability and income inequality hypothe-\nses, that is, we examine whether individuals belonging to vulnerable social groups report\ngreater fear of crime in countries characterized by greater income inequality. Given that\nincome inequality generally heightens fear of crime, it is conceivable that this worry is\nexacerbated in more vulnerable groups living in high inequality societies:\nH3: Income inequality moderates the association between vulnerable social group membership\nand fear of crime. Individuals belonging to vulnerable social groups feel more fearful in high\nthan in low inequality countries.\nSubjective ill-being as a consequence\nSubjective well-being is comprised of cognitive and affective components. The cognitive\ncomponent is usually measured as a global evaluation of life satisfaction (Diener et al.,\n1995). The affective component, or emotional well-being, is usually assessed by evalua-\ntions of happiness (see Diener et al., 1995). Although happiness and life satisfaction tap\ninto separate components theoretically, they seem to have similar correlates with fear of\ncrime and in fact have been found to be highly correlated empirically in data from the\nEuropean Social Survey (for example, Swift et al., 2014). Previous studies have consist-\nently shown that fear of crime is negatively associated with the components of subjective\nNot only individual-level variables such as fear of crime can predict an individual's\nsubjective well-being, but so can contextual factors. There is evidence that income ine-\nquality is negatively associated with subjective well-being (for example, Diener et al.,\n1995; Hagerty, 2000). Recently, some researchers aimed to identify a psychological\nmechanism that accounts for this link and they found that generalized trust explained the\nincome inequality\u00adsubjective well-being link in the US. In this paper, we propose fear of\ncrime as an alternative psycho-social pathway that may explain the inequality\u00adsubjective\nwell-being nexus. Whereas generalized trust is a relatively diffuse variable that is rather\ndifficult to tackle through social interventions and policy directives, fear of crime can be\nregarded as a more concrete manifestation of distrust in generalized others (Wilkinson\nand Pickett, 2009). Hence, we hypothesized that:\nH4: Individuals show lower levels of subjective well-being in unequal societies compared with\nmore equal societies and this association is explained by their fear of crime.\nMethods\nData source\nWe used data from the European Social Survey (ESS) from Round 4, 4th edition\n(European Social Survey Round 4 Data, 2008). The data were collected through com-\nputer-based personal interviews in 29 countries (N = 56,752) from the European region,\nplus Israel, in the years 2008 to 2010. They are based on random probability samples and\nare nearly representative of the eligible residential populations in each country aged\n15 years and over (Mage\nIndividual-level variables\nFear of crime. The operationalization of the concept fear of crime has been open to much\ndebate. This is partly due to the fact that it is multidimensional in nature (Ferraro and\nLaGrange, 1987) and that there has been a confusion of cognitive (for example, risk\nassessments), affective (fears and worries), and behavioural dimensions (for example,\nsecurity precautions) in fear of crime assessments (see Fattah and Sacco, 1989). Although\na full consensus has not been reached to date, it is widely acknowledged that fear, and\ntherefore also `fear of crime', is primarily an emotion (Lane et al., 2014), that is, an emo-\ntional response to a perceived threat. Hence, a standard indicator of fear of crime has\nbeen the question of how safe the respondent would feel if walking alone in the area after\ndark (Hale, 1996). According to Fattah and Sacco (1989), this item is a global measure\nof the affective component of fear of crime. More concrete measures include questions\ninvolving worry or fear of becoming a victim of specific criminal offences.\nHence, we decided to use the following ESS items as measures of fear of crime: `How\nsafe do you \u00ad or would you \u00ad feel walking alone in this area after dark?' (1 = `very safe',\n4 = `very unsafe'), `How often, if at all, do you worry about your home being burgled?'\n(1 = `all or most of the time', 4 = `never'), and `How often, if at all, do you worry about\nbecoming a victim of violent crime?'(1 = `all or most of the time', 4 = `never'). The latter\ntwo items were recoded so that higher scores indicate greater fear of crime. We computed\nan overall index of fear of crime by averaging the scores on these three variables.\nFerraro and LaGrange (1987) suggested that `formless' fears, as in the safety ques-\ntion, may not just tap into the affective component of fear of crime, but can also be seen\nas judgements about the likelihood of criminal victimization for the individual. And,\ntherefore, they tap into a more cognitive component of fear of crime and may produce\ndifferent results compared with concrete questions about fears. In order to gauge whether\nthese items do indeed differ from each other empirically, we conducted a principal com-\nponent analysis (PCA) using the eigenvalues >1 criterion. The results showed that all\nthree items loaded on the same factor (explaining 63 percent of the variance) with load-\nings above .72. Cronbach's alpha was satisfactory with a value of .71 and would not have\nincreased much if the item `feeling of safety' was deleted ( = .72). Considering the low\nnumber of items, Cronbach's alpha was also satisfactory across countries, ranging from\n.51 (Belgium) to .82 (Greece).APCAconducted separately in each country also corrobo-\nrated that there was only one factor onto which the three items loaded. Hence, we are\nconfident that in this case it is justified to use an index composed of these three items,\nwhich represents the affective component of fear of crime across countries.\nSubjective well-being. As a measure of subjective well-being, we used two 11-point Likert\nscaled items that asked respondents `All things considered, how satisfied are you with\nyour life as a whole nowadays?' (0 = `extremely dissatisfied' to 10 = `extremely satis-\nfied') and `Taking all things together, how happy would you say you are'(0 = `extremely\nunhappy' to 10 = `extremely happy'). The inter-item correlation was satisfactory for all\ncountries, ranging from .49 (Turkey) to .76 (Sweden). We computed an overall index of\nsubjective well-being by averaging the scores on these two variables.\nSocio-demographics.Individual-level variables indicating perceived vulnerability to\nbecoming a victim of crime were age, gender (dummy coded: 0 = male, 1 = female),\nethnic minority membership (dummy coded: 0 = no, 1 = yes), and disability (`Are you\nhampered in your daily activities in any way by any longstanding illness, or disability,\ninfirmity or mental health problem?'; recoded into: 1 = no, 2 = yes to some extent,\n3 = yes a lot).\nGuided by previous research (for example, Hummelsheim et al., 2011; Pain, 2000),\nwe included the following measures from the ESS as socio-demographic covariates in\nthe model since they have been found to be predictors of fear of crime: years of full-time\neducation completed, in paid work (that is, `employee, self-employed, working for own\nfamily business for the last 7 years?'; 0 = no, 1 = yes), domicile (1 = a big city, 2 = suburbs\nor outskirts of big city, 3 = town or small city, 4 = country village, 5 = farm or home in\ncountryside; recoded so that higher numbers correspond to more urban domiciles), and\nvictimization in the past 5 years (`Have you or a member of your household been the\nvictim of a burglary or assault in the last 5 years'?; dummy coded: 0 = no, 1 = yes).\nCountry-level variables\nIncome inequality. As a measure of income inequality in countries, we used the Gini coef-\nficient from Eurostat for the year 2008.2 The Gini coefficient for Turkey was available\nonly for the year 2006. We complemented missing data in Eurostat with Gini coefficients\nSocio-economic development. We used the Human Development Index (HDI) for the year\n2007 (Human Development Report, 2009) as a proxy for the socio-economic development\nof a country. The HDI is a well-established indicator assessing life expectancy at birth,\neducational attainment, and Gross National Income per capita within a single statistic.\nTotal recorded crime. We used data from Eurostat on total crimes per thousand population\nreported by the police (that is, any offences against the penal or criminal code) in the year\nall for Israel, Russia, and the Ukraine.\nAggregated individual-level variables.In order to control for other relevant macro-level\nvariables, we aggregated the following ESS individual-level variables at the country\nlevel: generalized trust5 (as a measure of social capital), paid work (percent as a measure\nof employment), ethnic minority membership ( percent as an assessment of immigration\nconcentration), and domicile (as a measure of levels of urbanization6). Although we are\ndealing with representative samples, we are aware that a better strategy would have been\nto find external data on these variables. However, it is very difficult to find macro-level\nstatistics for all ESS countries and, therefore, external data would have reduced our\nalready limited country-level sample size even further.\nStatistical analysis\nGiven the clustered data structure (individuals nested within countries), we used multi-\nlevel regression analyses (with HLM 7.01, Raudenbush and Bryk, 2002). The aim was to\nexamine whether there is a robust association between income inequality and fear of\ncrime and whether the vulnerability hypothesis is context dependent, that is, whether\nsocial minorities are more fearful of crime in countries characterized by high income\ninequality. Our modelling strategy consisted of the following steps: Model 0 is the null\nmodel, without any predictors, which determines how much of the total variance in fear\nof crime is associated with country differences as opposed to individual differences (rep-\nresented by the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient, ICC). In Model 1 we added income\ninequality as a country-level predictor of fear of crime. In subsequent analyses, we added\none country-level covariate at a time in order to test the robustness of the inequality\u00adfear\nof crime link while preserving a maximum degree of freedom in the analysis. Since\nsample size at the country level is relatively small (N = 29), we applied one-tailed\nsignificance level tests to the country-level predictors.\nIn Model 2, we examined whether the income inequality\u00adfear of crime link remained\nsignificant when controlling for individual-level socio-demographics by grand-mean\ncentring them (see Enders and Tofighi, 2007).\nFor Model 3, we used group-mean centring for all individual-level predictors because\nit removes all country-level variation from the predictor variable and yields slope coef-\nficients that can be unambiguously interpreted as the pooled within-cluster regression of\nthe respective predictor on fear of crime. This is the most appropriate centring strategy\nwhen associations between predictors and outcome variables at the lowest level are of\nsubstantive interest and is also preferable for examining cross-level interactions (Enders\nand Tofighi, 2007). We first added individual-level predictors with fixed slopes (Model\n3a). We then examined whether the associations between vulnerable social group mem-\nbership and fear of crime varied randomly across countries (Model 3b). Provided that\nthese analyses yielded any significant random slopes, we examined in Model 3c whether\nincome inequality explains country differences in these individual-level associations.\nIn other words, we examined whether the vulnerability hypothesis is context dependent,\nmeaning that we tested whether income inequality acts as a contextual moderator for the\nlink between vulnerable social group membership (regarding age, gender, ethnic minority,\ndisability) and fear of crime (referred to as cross-level interaction).\nIn the final set of analyses, we used multilevel structural equation modelling (MSEM)\nwith the software Mplus 4.2 (Muth\u00e9n and Muth\u00e9n 2007) in order to test for the mediating\neffect of fear of crime on the income inequality\u00adsubjective well-being link. We created a\n2-1-1 multilevel mediation model (see Preacher et al., 2011), meaning that the predictor\n(income inequality) is assessed at Level 2, and both the mediator (fear of crime) and the\ndependent variable (subjective well-being) are measured at Level 1. Hence, we expected\nthat income inequality as a Level-2 antecedent influences the Level-1 mediator fear of\ncrime, which then affects the Level-1 outcome subjective well-being.\nSeveral procedures have been suggested for testing multilevel mediation within the\nstandard multilevel modelling (MLM) framework. Yet, in the case of a 2-1-1 mediation,\nMLM does not fully separate a between-cluster and within-cluster effect, which means\nthat it can introduce a bias in the estimation of the indirect effect and lead to very high\nType-I error rates (Zhang et al. 2008). Although our focus is on the between-cluster\nrelationships \u00ad because any mediation of the effect of a Level-2 variable must also occur\nat the between-cluster level regardless at which level the mediator and outcome variable\nare assessed \u00ad it is important to differentiate the relationships at the two levels rather than\ncombining them into a single estimate within the indirect effect. One option that has\nrecently been developed is a mediation analysis within the MSEM framework (Preacher\net al., 2011). MSEM provides unbiased estimates of the between-group indirect effect by\ntreating the cluster-level component of the Level-1 variable as latent.\nNote that we used design weights (as provided by the ESS) in all analyses in order to\nadjust for a possible sampling bias.\nResults\nEstimates of the multilevel regression models are summarized in Table 1.\nIncome inequality and fear of crime\nThe ICC showed that a large proportion of the total variance in respondents' fear of\ncrime was due to individual differences (90.9 percent). Consequently, 9.1 percent of\nthe total variance was associated with differences between countries and the chi-square\nstatistic indicated that the differences in mean scores were significant (\u00b2(28) = 5708.13,\np < .001), justifying follow-up analyses using country-level predictors.\nConsistent with our hypothesis (H1), income inequality predicted fear of crime\n(Model 1). Figure 1 shows the association between income inequality and country-level\nscores of fear of crime, r(28) = .46, p < .05. The scatter plot also shows that three coun-\ntries score relatively high on the fear of crime measure, yet they have only low or medium\nlevels of income inequality. Hence, these countries (Slovakia, Greece, and Bulgaria)\nappeared to be outliers. This was also corroborated by a higher correlation between\nincome inequality and fear of crime when these three countries were excluded from the\nanalyses, r(25) = .55, p < .01. Hence, we decided to run the following multilevel analyses\nwithout these outliers.\nNext, we proceeded to testing the robustness of the income inequality\u00adfear of crime\nlink by including relevant country-level covariates one by one in order to preserve a\nmaximum degree of freedom at the country level.

We found that income inequality\nto the robustness of the income inequality\u00adfear of crime link since it cannot be fully\naccounted for by a third variable.\nModel 2 shows that the effect of income inequality remained significant after control-\nling for all individual-level socio-demographic variables. Moreover, we found that the\nvulnerability hypothesis was confirmed for some social groups, showing that women,\nolder, and disabled respondents reported greater fear of crime (H2). Surprisingly, ethnic\nminority membership turned out to be a non-significant predictor of fear of crime. As\nexpected, respondents who had been a victim of crime (or knew someone close who had\nbeen a victim in the past 5 years) were more fearful than those who did not have this\nexperience. Consistent with previous research (for example, Hummelsheim et al., 2011;\nPain, 2000), respondents who are less educated and living in urban areas were more fear-\nful. However, the variable paid work was not a significant predictor of fear of crime in\nour analyses. The model explained 10.1 percent of the within-country variance.\nIn the next analysis step (Model 3a), we entered the group-mean centred fixed slopes\nof the individual-level covariates, which yielded virtually the same results as in Model 2.\nWe then let the slopes of the predictors that indicate vulnerable social group member-\nship vary randomly (Model 3b) and found that there was indeed considerable variation\nproceeded with testing whether income inequality can account for the significant slope\nvariation of these individual-level predictors. Model 3c in Table 1 shows that there is\nonly one significant cross-level interaction (H3), that is, the association between the\nvariable ethnic minority membership and fear of crime is significantly moderated by\nincome inequality. A chi-square test for nested models yielded a significant difference\ncross-level interaction fitted the data better than the random slope model without the\ncross-level interaction.\nFigure 2 depicts the results of the cross-level interaction. What can be seen is that\nethnic majority members report the greatest fear of crime in high income inequality\ncountries.\nMediation model\nFor the mediation analyses, we used all 29 countries in order to enhance the sample size,\nwhich did not make any difference for the results. Pearson correlation coefficients\nshowed that all variables in the mediation model correlate significantly with each other\nat the country level in the hypothesized direction. Income inequality correlates with\nsubjective well-being at r = -.61, p < .001, and therefore it shares 37 percent of the vari-\nance with individuals' subjective well-being. There is a relatively strong country-level\ncorrelation between fear of crime and subjective well-being, r = -.67, p < .001.\nThe total effect of the mediation analyses showed a significant negative association\nZ = -4.146, p < .001. As expected, on average respondents perceived their well-being\nto be worse in countries with more income inequality than in countries with less ine-\nquality. We next tested whether fear of crime mediates the association between income\ninequality and subjective well-being. We found that respondents reported more fear of\nWhen taking into account fear of crime as a mediator in the third step, we found that\ngreater fear of crime is associated with less subjective well-being at the country level,\ninequality and subjective well-being was not significantly reduced after including the\nWe followed up our previous finding on the cross-level interaction between ethnic\nminority membership and income inequality and explored whether the mediation model\nmay hold only for respondents who are ethnic majority members.

Cross-level interaction between income inequality and ethnicity in the prediction of\nfear of crime.\nNote: Low and high income inequality correspond to the averaged upper and lower quartiles.\nconsequence. We examined the relationship between income inequality and fear of crime\nin representative samples from 28 countries in the European region, plus Israel. The\nevidence provides new insights into the phenomenon of fear of crime in regard to who is\nmost affected by it and in which societal circumstances. First, it confirms the income\ninequality hypothesis (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009), that is, that greater income inequal-\nity is associated with more fear of crime in the population. This association remains\nsignificant even if the effect of crime rates or the socio-economic, structural and social\ncharacteristics of a country, as well as relevant individual-level predictors (for example\npast victimization), are taken into account. Although the use of official crime rate statis-\ntics has some limitations, for example in regard to cross-national comparability, the find-\ning suggests that fear of crime is triggered not just by actual levels of violence but by a\nsystem of income differences that fosters beliefs that violence is a likely and viable route\nto make up for status deprivation. This is also consistent with some findings that people's\nfears of crime do not always match up with rates and trends in crime and violence\nThe findings are consistent with the vulnerability hypothesis (for example, Cossman\nand Rader, 2011) by showing that social groups that are usually perceived to be vulner-\nable to criminal attacks also report greater fear of crime. This was the case for older and\ndisabled people as well as for women, yet not for ethnic minority members. We extended\nthe vulnerability hypothesis by combining it with the inequality hypothesis and expected\nthat vulnerable social groups may report greater fear in more unequal societies. Although\nthe association between vulnerable social group membership and fear of crime differed\nsignificantly across countries, this variation could not be explained with income inequality.\nFigure 3.

The figure\nFuture research may examine whether other macro-level variables account for these\nslope variations. Another explanation for this result may also be that cross-level interac-\ntions require greater cluster-level sample sizes in order to detect significant effects of\nsmaller effect sizes. It might also be that income inequality does not affect physically\nvulnerable groups in their fear of crime more than others in society because everyone in\nan unequal society is affected by a social climate in which status competition and relative\ndeprivations stir anxieties about crime and violence. Hence, being physically fit is not\nperceived as a protective factor any more.\nHowever, we did find one significant cross-level interaction regarding ethnic minority\nmembership and fear of crime. It is noteworthy that the main effect was non-significant,\nthat is, the average effect across all countries. This demonstrates the importance of exam-\nining cross-level interactions, which clearly showed that the association between ethnic\nminority membership and fear of crime differed depending on the societal context.\nSurprisingly, it is not ethnic minority members but ethnic majority members who report\ngreater fear of crime in unequal societies. This raises the question of what may underlie\na fear that is specific to ethnic majority members. One possibility is that the majority is\nafraid of crime committed by ethnic minorities. This is somewhat consistent with an\nearlier and smaller cross-national ESS study on perceived immigrants' impact on crime\nin which the results suggested that people's fear of crime may be a disguised form of\nprejudice against foreigners (Ceobanu, 2010). It is noteworthy that fear of crime commit-\nted by immigrants was not affected by the national wealth of a country (as assessed\nthrough Gross Domestic Product measures). In a similar vein, we did not find the HDI to\nbe related to fears of crime, which points to the importance of relative deprivation (as\nassessed through income inequality) as opposed to absolute deprivation. It supports our\nreasoning that income inequalities foster a climate of fear and general mistrust in others\nbecause there is a shared awareness that there are very limited legitimate options for the\ndisadvantaged to obtain resources and social status. Hence, there is a constant feeling\nof threat that is not necessarily matched by a real threat (for a similar argument, see\nBratanova et al., 2016). For instance, Ceobanu (2010) found that the ratio of foreign\ninmates to the non-European foreign population was unrelated to public views about\nimmigrants' impact on crime (Ceobanu 2010), yet perceptions that immigrants worsen\ncrime problems were more evident in societies harbouring larger stocks of non-European\nimmigrants. This is fully compatible with the argument that unequal societies are more\nprejudiced (Vauclair et al., 2015; Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009). Generally, there is a\ngreater orientation towards hierarchy and social dominance in unequal societies and\ntherefore any low-status group members are more likely to be evaluated negatively,\nresulting in social exclusion and discrimination (Marmot, 2004). Therefore, it could be\nthe case that one way of managing and negotiating threats and dangers in these societies\nis to resort to stereotyping and prejudice. By labelling criminals with certain social iden-\ntifiers (for example foreigners), a sense of control is restored (Smith, 1984). In this sense,\nthe fear of crime measures may be less nurtured by actual fear of crime and more by a\nfear of foreigners. This may be fuelled by perceptions of overlap between the notions of\nimmigrant and outlaw, the limited professional opportunities for foreigners that margin-\nalize them in society, and that some immigrants come illegally or overstay their visa (see\nCeobanu, 2010). Future research may examine the phenomenon of racial crime prejudice\nin unequal societies more deeply.\nWe also aimed to test a mediation model in which fear of crime is the mediator that\nexplains the inequality\u00adsubjective well-being link. Although all associations in our\nmodel were significant in the expected direction, fear of crime could not explain this link\nin the general population. Our follow-up analyses showed that this might be owing to the\nfact that income inequality is not related to greater fear of crime for ethnic minority\nmembers. The mediation model held only in the subpopulation of ethnic majority mem-\nbers. This is still the large majority of the representative samples in each country, and\ntherefore we may conclude that fear of crime explains why income inequality leads to\nlower levels of subjective well-being for most of the people in a country. As pointed out\nabove, these findings merit further investigation in order to fully understand the nature\nof fear in this subpopulation.\nThere are some limitations to consider when interpreting our results. First, it is impor-\ntant to recognize that our study is cross-sectional and therefore does not allow us to draw\ndefinite conclusions about cause and effect. Yet it seems reasonable to assume that the\nmacro-variable national income inequality is not primarily caused by fear of crime or\nsubjective well-being. Hence, the cause and effect question is predominantly about the\nassociation between fear of crime and subjective well-being. It might be that individuals\nwho are not well are also more fearful of crime. However, the literature usually concep-\ntualizes subjective well-being as a consequence of fear of crime (for example, Morrall\net al., 2010). In reality, a complex bidirectional relationship may apply. The analyses\nof cross-national longitudinal data could shed some light on the cause and effect issue.\nHowever, this type of data is not available for the ESS.\nSecondly, we should be cautious about the generalizability of these findings to other\nregions of the world. The data are representative of countries within the European region,\nso they do not necessarily generalize to other regions or continents. Moreover, the sample\nsize at the country level is relatively limited, which means that the tests of country-level\neffects may have been underpowered. Nevertheless, income inequality emerged as a\nrobust predictor of fear of crime even when controlling for other relevant country-level\nvariables. Studies examining fear of crime or related constructs with cross-national data\nfrom the European region usually operate with low sample sizes (between 21 and 27\net al., 2013; Visser et al., 2013). By using a multilevel model, we made the assumption\nthat our clusters can be regarded as a random sample from a wider population, allowing\nus theoretically and statistically to infer our results beyond the countries that were used\nin the analysis. Considering that there are other relatively wealthy regions and countries\nin the world with an even greater discrepancy in the distribution of income (for example,\nin the US \u00ad OECD, 2008), it is plausible that there are similar or possibly even stronger\nrelationships when the model is tested on a more diverse national or international dataset.\nFor instance, income inequality differs considerably across the US states and it has\nalready been suggested that this should foster individuals' fear of crime if they live in\nhighly unequal states (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009).\nThird, one limitation of using macro-level indicators as predictors of fear of crime is\nthat there is some ambiguity left as to how exactly the context affects individuals' fears\nof crime. We drew upon the income inequality literature and theorized that a strong divi-\nsion between the rich and the poor renders social mobility in a hierarchical society more\nunlikely. This fosters a climate of fear because people believe that there are few legitimate\nchances for the deprived to obtain resources and social status, leaving crime and violence\nas the most obvious route \u00ad even if this is not necessarily the case. This can also be seen\nas a sign of mistrust in others, which is consistent with our results reported above. Hence,\ninequality is a structural aspect of societies that gets under the skin by having a relative\nincome, social status or class position in the wider societal fabric (Wilkinson and Pickett,\nFurther research is needed in order to ascertain the specific pathways of how income\ninequality fosters fear of crime. Such a model should treat fear of crime as the criterion\nvariable, national income inequality as the independent variable, and individual-level\ncharacteristics, such as perceptions about inequality, as mediator variables. Such an analy-\nsis would make a significant advancement to the fear of crime literature and its link to the\nmacro-level variable income inequality. We also acknowledge that the explained variance\nat the country level for income inequality as the only predictor does not appear to explain\nmuch between-country variance (about 17 percent), leaving the question of whether this\ncontextual effect is relevant enough or whether the meso-level (for example, neighbour-\nhood characteristics) is more useful to study since it is also more proximate to individuals'\nliving environment. We think that the meso-level is indeed highly relevant for this topic\nof research; however, we would like to emphasize that, even if macro-level contextual\neffects emerge as relatively small, they are important from a theory and policy point of\nview. The reason is that these effects should operate over a wide range of research areas\nand dependent variables (Liska, 1990). Research on income inequality has already yielded\nnumerous important findings in how it is related to a host of social and health problems\n(see Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009). This cumulative evidence \u00ad including that provided by\nthe current study \u00ad is helpful to make a case for reducing income inequalities and there-\nfore alleviating at once many of the social and health problems societies are facing today.\nFunding\nthe first author.

Another common meso-level characteristic that has been linked to fear of crime is the spread\nof visible signs of disorder (for example, unsupervised teenage groups, littering and graffiti;\nsee, for example, Wilson and Kelling's 1982 `broken windows' theory). Yet we are unaware\nof any empirical study that has examined this environmental characteristic at the country\nlevel, probably owing to the fact that there is a lack of data representing signs of disorder at\nthe aggregated country level.\n2.

This variable was assessed through two items (0 = `you can't be too careful' to 10 = `most\npeople can be trusted'; 0 = `most people try to take advantage of me' to 10 = `most people\ntry to be fair'). The inter-item correlation was satisfactory, ranging from .42 (France) to .73\n(Greece). We computed an overall index of generalized trust by averaging the scores and\naggregating them at the country level.\n6. We are not aware of any cross-national study that used the degree of urbanization as a predic-\ntor variable yet, drawing upon the meso-level studies (see Pain, 2000), it seems conceivable\nthat a higher level of urbanization could be related to greater fear of crime.\n7.
