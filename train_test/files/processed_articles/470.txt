The MMSE has been em-\nployed in several other centenarian studies, despite the\nproblems of vision and hearing impairment in this ex-\ntreme age group [10\u00ad14], and represents a commonly ac-\ncepted psychometric test in the research of cognition and\ndementia [5].\nthe younger cohort would display worse cognitive perfor-\nmance than the older one.

A non-response analy-\nsis showed no significant differences between responders and\nnon-responders regarding gender, housing and mean number of\nhospitalizations in the previous 18 years [15]. The personal inter-\nview consisted of sociodemographic variables and health, and\ncognitive testing using the MMSE as well as a clinical examina-\ntion [16, 17]. The scientific ethics committee of the counties of\nFunen and Vejle, Odense, Denmark, approved the study (trial\nin Andersen-Ranberg et al. [15].\nThe Danish 1905 cohort survey comprises all individuals born\nthe Danish Civil Registration System. At baseline in 1998, a total of\nparticipated in the baseline survey. The baseline survey and subse-\nquent follow-ups consisted of a personal interview in the respon-\ndents' home covering sociodemographic factors, medical status,\nhealth and cognitive functioning. Cognitive performance was as-\nsessed using the MMSE [16]. Trained interviewers from the Danish\nNational Institute of Social Research carried out the survey. Since\nbaseline, in-person follow-up surveys have been conducted every\n2\u00ad3 years. The most recent one took place in 2005, when the survi-\nvors could celebrate their 100th birthday, and a total of 166 respon-\ndents participated. To increase the number of participants in the\n2005 follow-up, all earlier non-responders from previous waves\nwere re-contacted. This yielded another 90 persons, increasing the\ntotal number of respondents in the last wave to 256. Not all of the\nrespondents had reached the age of 100 at the time of the last inter-\nview. In this cohort comparison we included only those in the 1905\ncohort who lived to celebrate their 100th birthday before death, in\nanalysis showed no difference between participants and non-par-\nmedian number of hospitalizations (p = 0.56) or bed days in hospi-\nscribed in detail elsewhere [18, 19]. The ethics committee system\nMeasures\nHousing was divided into a binary variable reflecting whether\nthe respondent was living at home or in a nursing home. The nurs-\ning home group also included those living in sheltered housing.\nEducational level was dichotomized into 2 categories reflect-\ning whether the respondent had 7 or less or more than 7 years of\nschooling.\nMarital status was a binary variable reflecting whether the\nparticipant was married or not. Divorced or separated respon-\ndents were assigned to the non-married group.\nCognitive function was assessed using the MMSE developed by\nFolstein et al. [16]. The MMSE is subdivided into 6 areas of cogni-\ntive functioning: orientation, registration, calculation or atten-\ntion, recall, language and praxis. The correct scores of each area\nare summed to a maximum score of 30 points. In the present\nstudy, the total scores were divided into 3 categories using the\nconventions established in the Epidemiologic Catchment Area\nstudies in the USA [20]: cognitive impairment was graded as se-\nvere for those having scores between 0 and 17, mild for scores be-\nBecause the MMSE relies heavily on visual and auditory abil-\nities, the failure of reaching scores at or above the normality\nthreshold of 24 may be due to visual or hearing impairment, es-\npecially at advanced ages [11, 21]. To address this, we calculated\nthe MMSE Index, which is a numerical value between 0 and 1 re-\nflecting the ratio between the actual score and the maximum ob-\ntainable score in the MMSE, taking into account the existence of\nvisual impairment. This can be done by reducing the maximum\nobtainablescorebyscoresaccordingtothequestionsintheMMSE\nthat require vision. Five items in the MMSE concern vision: item\n6 (name 2 things in front of you \u00ad 2 points), item 8 (a 3-stage com-\nmand \u00ad 3 points), item 9 (read and obey a sentence \u00ad 1 point), item\n10 (write a sentence making sense to the interviewer \u00ad 1 point)\nand item 11 (copying 2 overlapping pentagrams \u00ad 1 point). The\ntotal score of these items is 8 points. Thus, the standard maximum\nscore of 30 can be reduced down to 22 points. However, it is pos-\nsible to reduce the maximum score by less than 8 points if the re-\nspondent is able to perform and complete some of the above-men-\ntioned items despite his or her visual impairment.

In\naddition to the categorization of the MMSE scores and the calcu-\nlation of the MMSE Index, the median MMSE score in both co-\nhorts was compared. Missing information due to non-response or\nrefusal was scored as error, i.e. the respondent was assigned 0\npoints for the particular item, following the recommendations by\nFillenbaum et al. [23].\nData Analysis\nDifferences in categorical variables between the cohorts were\nanalyzed using the Fisher Exact test. Comparison of group medi-\nans on the MMSE was performed with the Wilcoxon rank sum\ntest. A p value of !0.05 was considered to indicate statistical sig-\nnificance.

For the centenarians living\nin nursing homes a tendency towards worse cognitive\nfunction was present in the 1905 cohort independently of\nthe use of assistive devices (data not shown).\nThe proportion of centenarians who could perform a\ncomplete or an incomplete MMSE was approximately\nthe same in both cohorts (table 4). Comparing the sam-\nples within the groups of complete or incomplete MMSE\ndid not reveal any systematic differences in MMSE\nscores. However, the proportion of subjects in the 1905\ncohort with a complete MMSE and a high MMSE score\nwas a little higher than in the 1895 one. Among the cen-\ntenarians who could not perform a complete MMSE, vi-\nsual impairment was the most frequent reason in both\ncohorts.\nDiscussion\nOverall there were no systematic differences between\nthe cohorts with respect to cognitive function as mea-\nsured using the MMSE. Among the centenarians living\nat home and those living in nursing homes, modest ten-\ndencies were seen towards both better and worse cogni-\nhort: in the 1905 sample the men living at home had bet-\nter cognitive performance than those in the 1895 group,\nbut the numbers were small. Comparing the nursing\nsample, there was a tendency towards more cognitive im-\npairment, especially among women.\nA slightly higher proportion of centenarians was liv-\ning in their own home in the 1905 cohort compared to\nthe 1895 one. This could be a reflection of increased al-\nlocation of resources to home health care services. In a\nprevious paper we had found an increased use of com-\nmon assistive devices in the 1905 cohort compared to the\n1895 cohort [4], both among centenarians living at home\nand among nursing home dwellers. The additional analy-\nsis in the present study may indicate that this increased\nuse of assistive devices allows a higher proportion of cen-\ntenarians with cognitive impairment to stay at home.\nThen it would follow that the lower proportion of indi-\nviduals living in nursing homes would have more signif-\nicant cognitive decline.\nIn terms of absolute figures, 256 persons in Denmark\nof people reaching their 100th birthday in Denmark thus\nincreased by 42% over the course of 10 years with a dis-\ntinct gender difference in favour of women compared to\nmen. One pessimistic expectation could be that the rising\nnumber of 100-year-olds would entail a large proportion\nof cognitively impaired individuals in this extreme age\ngroup. On the other hand, the results of the present study\ndo not support this expectation. Although the number of\ncentenarians increased substantially between 1995 and\n2005, the proportion with low cognitive performance\nstayed approximately the same. This is a positive finding\ncompared to the study by Suzuki et al. [9] describing de-\nteriorating trends in cognitive functioning among Oki-\nnawan centenarians.

In con-\ntrast, our study showed a tendency towards better cogni-\ntive performance among home-dwelling centenarians\nand worse cognitive function among participants living\nin nursing homes.\nThe lack of agreement between the findings of the\nOkinawan study and our research may partly be due to\nthe different mortality selection present in Denmark and\nJapan.

Denmark experienced a stagnation in life\nexpectancy at birth and at the age of 65 in the decades\nbefore 1995, primarily due to stagnating death rates\namong middle-aged individuals [26, 27]. It was not until\nafter 1995 that the life expectancy in Denmark substan-\ntially increased again [28]. The slower growth in the\nnumber of centenarians in Denmark compared to other\nlow-mortality countries may explain the lack of deterio-\nration of cognitive function. However, it should be\nstressed that the oldest-old mortality continued to de-\ncline, also during the stagnation period [27], and that the\nnumber of Danish centenarians still increased substan-\nOur study has important strengths. Both surveys were\npopulation based and included community dwellers as\nwell as institutionalized residents. Second, both surveys\ndisplayed a relatively high response rate for centenarians.\nThird, both cohorts were shown to be unselected with\nregard to gender, and mean or median number of hospi-\ntalizations (data not shown). Additionally, the sex ratios\nlargely correspond to those of the overall population of\nThe cohort comparison had some limitations.

In the\n1905 cohort survey the respondents were first contacted\nwhen they were 92\u00ad93 years of age and then followed up\nevery second to third year until they reached 100 years of\nage. Additionally, earlier non-responders of previous\nwaves were re-contacted in the 2005 wave.\nBoth surveys were conducted as in-person interviews\nin the respondent's own home. However, trained inter-\nviewers from the Danish Institute of Social Research car-\nried out the 1905 cohort survey, whereas the same geria-\ntrician and geriatric nurse made all the preparatory con-\ntacts and conducted all the interviews in the LSDC. The\nlatter may have influenced the response rate in a positive\ndirection. To minimize the bias, the interviewers from\nthe Danish National Institute of Social Research con-\nducting the most recent follow-up in the 1905 cohort\nwere trained by the same geriatrician who carried out the\nA span of 10 years may not be enough to detect cohort\ndifferences among centenarians. However, in a previous\nstudy comparing activities of daily living between the\ntwo birth cohorts we found a significant improvement in\nactivities of daily living among women in the 1905 cohort\ncompared to women in the 1895 sample [4]. Thus, for ac-\ntivities of daily living the time frame of 10 years seems to\nbe sufficient. In support of this, previous research con-\nducted among younger age groups used similar or even\nnarrower time frames [29\u00ad32], and most of these studies\nwere able to detect significant cohort differences in fa-\nvour of more recent cohorts.\nApproximately 25% of the respondents in both groups\nwere not tested with the MMSE. In the 1895 cohort this\nwas primarily due to cognitive impairment or severe de-\nmentia [17]. Comparison of the groups not tested and\nthose tested showed that the individuals not tested were\nmore often living in nursing homes in both cohorts. Since\nthe proportion of non-tested centenarians was nearly\nidentical in both samples, this is unlikely to impact the\nresults of the study.\nWe dealt with missing information on the MMSE due\nto visual impairment by calculating the MMSE Index. An\nalternative method is to make use of imputed item scores.\nHowever, this may lead to a biased result because the pos-\nsibility of assigning too high scores to respondents with\nmissing scores cannot be ruled out [23].\nWhen using the MMSE as a brief screening test for\ncognitive impairment in population-based studies, age\nand educational level have to be taken into account [5].\nSomestudiesshowanage-relateddeclineinMMSEscores\nfor otherwise healthy individuals and also that individu-\nals with higher levels of education perform better on the\nMMSE compared to a person of the same age with a low-\ner educational level [33\u00ad35].

The two cohorts\nwere of the same age. It is therefore unlikely that age and\neducational level influenced the results of the study.\nA potential problem of using the MMSE in repeated\nsurveys is the introduction of a possible learning effect,\ni.e. longitudinal respondents may display a higher MMSE\nscore than those who encounter the MMSE for the first\ntime. However, in view of the time interval of 2\u00ad3 years\nbetween the interview surveys of the 1905 cohort we con-\nsider this possibility to be very limited. Additional analy-\nses showed no significant difference in MMSE scores for\nthe participants encountering the MMSE for the first\ntime in the last wave of the 1905 Cohort Survey and the\nsubjects who had gone through repeated MMSE tests\nduring the previous waves of the 1905 Cohort Survey\n(data not shown).\nA pertinent issue in our study is the use of the MMSE\nas the only measure of cognitive function. Different find-\nings may have been evident had there been a more exten-\nsive battery of tests with a more sophisticated instrument.\nHowever, a previous study based on the 1905 cohort using\nboth the MMSE and a more sensitive instrument consist-\ning of the combined score of 5 different cognitive tests, a\nso-called cognitive composite score (which was not used\nin the 1895 cohort), found that both the MMSE and the\ncognitive composite score were predictive of survival\nduring the 2-year follow-up and both in the same dose-\nresponse fashion [19]. The MMSE may be a crude instru-\nment but also appropriate in the sense that at this ad-\nvanced age approximately half of the population may be\nmore or less cognitively impaired [17].\nIn conclusion, this study found no significant differ-\nences in cognitive score between the two centenarian\nbirth cohorts using the MMSE. On the other hand, in the\nwere seen towards better cognitive function for the cente-\nnarians living at home and worse cognitive performance\nfor those living in nursing homes. These tendencies may\nbe important because in the 1905 cohort compared to the\n1895 sample a slightly higher proportion of centenarians\nwas living at home and fewer centenarians were living in\nnursing homes, probably a reflection of increased alloca-\ntion of resources to home health care services.\nOur findings suggest that the growing number of cen-\ntenarians may not entail increasing proportions of cogni-\ntively impaired individuals in this extreme age group.\nHowever, had Denmark experienced a similar decline in\noldest-old mortality in recent decades as that seen in\nSouthern European countries and Japan, the findings of\nthe study might have proved different.\nAcknowledgements\nThe study was supported by the US National Institute on Ag-\nplinary Research Council.
