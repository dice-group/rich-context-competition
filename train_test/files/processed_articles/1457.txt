Improvements in the\nprevailing diet in the United States are among the leading health\nobjectives for the nation (2). The provision of nutrition in-\nformation to inform food choice as a means to improving diet and\nhealth is a well-established principle of public health and food\ncommerce (3). The modern era of product-specific nutrition\nguidance in the United States was ushered in with the Nutrition\nLabeling and Education Act, which was passed in 1990 (4).\nAlthough appropriate, advice to the public to change their diets\nacross-the-board, such as to a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern\n(5\u00ad7) and/or to a more plant-based dietary pattern (8, 9), have had\nlittle effect on prevailing norms (10\u00ad12).\nIn response to growing concerns about diet-related health\nproblems, diverse systems and logos have been developed by\nmanufacturers and organizations to highlight the nutritional\nbenefits of select products. Reliable food-level guidance appli-\ncable to all foods and eating occasions would provide consumers\nthe opportunity to improve their diets, and potentially their\nhealth, one food choice at a time, in any food category. The\nOverall Nutritional Quality Index (ONQI) was developed by\nnutrition and public health scientists independently of food in-\ndustry interests to provide expert yet simple guidance to con-\nsumers, beginning on the supermarket shelf. The ONQI\ndevelopment and applications have been previously described\n(13). This article describes the scientific assessment of key\nperformance characteristics of the ONQI algorithm, which\noperates in the marketplace under the name NuVal.\nThe development of the ONQI algorithm (see Table 1) by\na multidisciplinary group of nutrition and public health experts\n(see Table 2) has been previously described (13). In brief, the\ngroup convened voluntarily to undertake the challenge of de-\nveloping a nutrition guidance system based on the overall nu-\ntritional quality of foods. Funding for the effort was provided\nentirely by Griffin Hospital (14), a not-for-profit, Yale University\u00ad\n1 From the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, Derby, CT (DLK,\nVYN, and LQR); Topco Associates, Skokie, IL (AR); and the Albert\nEinstein College of Medicine, New York, NY (KTA).\n2 Presented at the symposium \"Where Is the Science? Do Current Nutri-\ntion Profiling/Food Scoring Systems Promote Consumer Intake of Nutrient\nDense Foods,\" held at Experimental Biology 2009, New Orleans, LA, 20\nby Griffin Hospital, Derby, CT; by Topco Associates, Skokie, IL; and by\nNuVal, Braintree, MA.\n4 Address correspondence and requests for reprints to DL Katz, Yale Uni-\nversity School of Medicine, Griffin Hospital, 2nd Floor, 130 Division Street,\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\naffiliated community hospital in Derby, CT; no food industry\nelements were involved in the project. Griffin Hospital is home\nto the Yale School of Medicine's Prevention Research Center\n(15) where the project was coordinated. The scientific expert\npanel members were compensated by Griffin Hospital for their\ntime and effort. This group was responsible for all content de-\ncisions regarding the algorithm.\nThe scientific assessment of the ONQI to date encompasses\nelements of content validity, construct validity, criterion validity,\nand consumer (face validity) testing. Content validity assessment\nwas based on the development panel reaching a consensus that the\nalgorithm was reasonable and appropriate in basic content. This\njudgment was predicated on the collective experience and knowl-\nedge of the panel, as well as on the extensive review of pertinent\nliterature (see http://www.nuval.com for a relevant bibliography).\nThe first step in construct validity testing was an assessment of\nthe correlation between ONQI scores and rankings with the\npooled, mean rankings of foods by the members of the expert\npanel. Testing was conducted on a diverse group of foods and on\nfoods within categories. Correlational analysis of this sort was\nlimited to a total pool of '120 foods due to the labor in-\ntensiveness of manually ranking foods on overall nutritional\nquality. A much larger test set of diverse foods was then scored by\nthe ONQI and reviewed for anomalies by the expert panel. This\nprocess continued with a total set of '1000 foods until no scoring\nanomalies were perceived or until all such apparent anomalies\nwere fully explained in a detailed review of nutrient composition.\nConsumer testing to establish face validity was concurrent with\nconstruct validity testing and involved both qualitative and\nquantitative components; this research was overseen by an in-\nhouse marketing consultant (A Reingold) and the marketing re-\nsearch and technology firm, Affinnova (16). Consumer testing was\ndirected toward 2 primary objectives: 1) understanding consumer\nresponse to the concept and 2) determining how best to com-\nmunicate the concept. Three focus groups were held in October\n2007 at a marketing research facility in suburban Chicago and\nconducted by a marketing firm that specializes in focus group\nresearch; each group was led by a professional moderator. Each\ngroup convened for '2 h and included 8\u00ad10 participants/group.\nThe subjects were female head of households who were in-\nterested in making improved food choices; one group included\nwomen aged 60\u00ad69 y with no children at home, although 2\ngroups included women aged 35\u00ad55 y with and without children\nMembers of the Overall Nutritional Quality Index Scientific Expert/Development Panel1\nPanel member Institution Expertise\nKeith Ayoob, EdD, RD Albert Einstein College of Medicine Pediatric nutrition, dietary counseling\nLeonard Epstein, PhD University at Buffalo: The State University of New York Weight management\nDavid Jenkins, MD, DSc University of Toronto Diabetes, dyslipidemia, glycemic responses\nDavid L Katz, MD, MPH2 Yale Prevention Research Center, Yale University\nSchool of Medicine\nChronic disease prevention, general nutrition\nFrancine Kaufman, MD University of Southern California Pediatric endocrinology\nRobert Kushner, MD Northwestern University General nutrition, dietary counseling, behavior modification\nRonald Prior, PhD Arkansas Children's Nutrition Center, USDA HNRC Nutritional biochemistry\nRebecca Reeves, DrPH, RD Baylor College of Medicine General nutrition/dietetics, dietary counseling\nBarbara Rolls, PhD Pennsylvania State University Appetite, satiety, energy balance\nJohn Seffrin, PhD American Cancer Society Cancer epidemiology\nSachiko St. Jeor, PhD University of Nevada General nutrition/dietetics, cardiac risk reduction,\nweight management\nWalter Willett, MD, DrPH Harvard University Cardiovascular epidemiology, general nutrition\n1 USDA HNRC, US Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center.\n2 Chair/project director.\nComponents of the Overall Nutritional Quality Index algorithm1\nNumerator\nnutrients\nDenominator\nnutrients\nMacronutrient\nfactors\nFiber Saturated fat Fat quality2\nFolate trans Fat Protein quality2\nVitamin A Sodium3 Energy density4,5\nVitamin C\nVitamin D\nVitamin E\nSugar (total/added)6\nCholesterol\nVitamin B-6\nPotassium\nCalcium\nZinc\nfatty acids\nTotal bioflavanoids\nTotal carotenoids\nMagnesium\nIron\n1 Micronutrient factors are summed in the numerator and denominator,\nrespectively.

The focus groups followed typical qualitative marketing\nresearch protocols by starting with very broad food and shopping\nbehaviors and then narrowed down to specific concepts directly\nrelated to nutritional profiling and the ONQI.\nSemiquantitative consumer studies were conducted in No-\nInternet-based studies, accessed via a secure website by enrollees.\nconcept questions with the following eligibility criteria: women\naged 35\u00ad64 y, with children, who were the primary grocery\nshopper and who had an interest in a healthy lifestyle, including\ngood nutrition. The March 2008 survey included 7 screener\nquestions and 18 concept questions with the following eligibility\ncriteria: men and women, aged 18\u00ad64 y, who were the primary\ngrocery shoppers for their households.\nThe next phase of construct validity testing was an assessment\nof the degree to which aggregated ONQI scores for total diet\ndifferentiated a health-promoting dietary pattern (ie, generated\na higher score) from a typical American diet (which generated\na lower score). For this comparison, a 7-d meal plan from the\nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet at the\ndiet, and mean dietary intake data from the National Health and\n(18) were used to represent the typical American diet.\nhort were used to assess the association between ONQI scores\nand both the numerical scores and the quartiles of the Healthy\nEating Index 2005 (19). Analytic methods included chi-square,\nlinear trend testing, and linear regression.\nNutritional analyses for both the DASH meal plan and the\nNHANES data were performed by using a \"composite recipe\"\napproach. This entails creating a summary measure of nutrient\ndensity (nutrients/kcal) for all of the ONQI nutrients by using all\nof the consumed foods. This method is a less labor-intensive\nalternative to generating ONQI scores separately for each food\nitem (the food-by-food method) and then aggregating those\nscores. A comparison of the 2 methods using small test sets\n(L Rhee, VY Njike, DL Katz, unpublished data, November 2009)\nindicates that, because of the differential handling of various food\ncategories by the ONQI algorithm (eg, nutrients are capped in\nfortified/processed foods, but are given unrestricted credit in\nfoods direct from nature), the composite recipe method tends to\ncompress the range of scores by contributing an upward bias to\nthe lowest scores and a downward bias to the highest scores. In\nthe context of the intended analysis, this is a bias toward the null.\nBecause the glycemic load enters into the ONQI algorithm se-\nlectively for certain foods (eg, food containing grains and/or\nadded sugar) on the basis of standard US Food and Drug Ad-\nministration serving sizes, the composite recipe method pre-\ncluded the use of the glycemic load for the NHANES data.\nAnalysis of the DASH diet was performed both with and without\nthe glycemic load; comparison to the NHANES data was done by\nexcluding the glycemic load to establish comparability. For the\nDASH meal plan analysis, menu items were entered in the\nNutrition Data System for Research (NDSR; reference 20)\nsoftware to generate nutrient data for each day of the DASH\neating plan. NDSR is a windows-based dietary analysis program\ndesigned for the collection and analyses of 24-h dietary recalls\nand the analysis of food records, menus, and recipes. Calculation\nof nutrients occurs immediately, which provides data per in-\ngredient, food, meal, and day in report and analysis file formats.\nMenu items from the DASH eating plan were entered in the\nNDSR software with the stated household measures for servings.\nGeneric food items were used. For recipe items, the amount of\neach recipe item was then divided by the total number of servings\nto obtain the appropriate, single-serving entry. All nutrient con-\ncentrations were then converted to per 100 g for standardization\nfor each day of the DASH eating plan. The ONQI score for a 7-d\nDASH eating plan was determined by aggregating scores for each\nday and computing the mean with the corresponding 95% CI.\nThe NHANES analysis was based on data from those partic-\nipants providing complete, reliable dietary interviews on day 1 in\ncalculate ONQI scores for the DASH diet was applied to\nNHANES. Nutrients were tabulated for the total dietary intake\nfrom each 24-h recall in NHANES by using the composite recipe\nscoring method. Food composition data, ie, the amounts per 100 g\nof each nutrient contained in a food, were multiplied by the number\nof 100-g weight portions of food consumed, and the nutrient intake\nobtained from each food was summed over the entire day.\nUS Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrient Database for\nDietary Studies (FNDDS) versions 2 and 3 were used to assess\nspectively. The FNDDS includes a \"recipe\" database called the\nStandard Reference (SR)-Link because it is used to cross-\nreference the survey food codes with the appropriate version of\nthe NDSR. The SR-20 is the most recent release of the Standard\nReference, and it was used with FNDDS 3.0 to calculate intakes\nconducted. Nutrients included in the FNDDS have complete\ninformation in the SR database. Two separate sets of recipe\ntermine the individual amino acid, vitamin D, and trans fat\ncontent of survey foods by using the FNDDS recipe database\nappropriate for the respective survey time period. Bioflavanoid\ndata were not available for composite recipes and therefore were\nomitted from both the DASH and the NHANES analyses.\nThe association between ONQI diet scores and the Healthy\nEating Index (HEI) 2005 was assessed by examining the distri-\nbution and mean ONQI scores among groups defined by different\nlevels of the HEI 2005. The Student's t test and analysis of var-\niance were used to assess between-group differences in the mean\nONQI diet scores; chi-square testing was used for testing of or-\ndinal variables. Spearman's correlation and linear regression were\nused to assess the association between the HEI 2005 and ONQI\nscores. A test for linearity (ie, test for trends) was also performed.\nCovariates including age, sex, and race-ethnicity were included in\nthe analyses when testing for between-group differences and\ntrends. All data were sample-weighted by using the day 1 dietary\nsampling weight, and all NHANES analyses were performed by\nusing SUDAAN software (Research Triangle Institute, Research\nTriangle Park, NC) to adjust variance estimates for homogeneity\nbecause of the clustered sample design.\nFinally, 2 assessments that were ongoing at the time that this\narticle was submitted have resulted in preliminary data. The first\nof these is an assessment of changes in purchase patterns fol-\nlowing the implementation of the NuVal system by retail\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nsupermarkets (n = 526 at time of submission). Specifically,\nparticipating retailers are monitoring the shift in sales data pre\nand post NuVal implementation by examining the distribution of\nwithin-category (eg, yogurt, breakfast cereal) NuVal scores.\nThe second of these, which is being conducted independently\nby researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health, is\nassessing the association between aggregated ONQI scores and\nthe Alternative Healthy Eating Index (21), the HEI 2005, and\na short list of salient health outcomes, which includes the total\nburden of incident chronic disease, incident diabetes, incident\ncancer, and incident cardiovascular events. Preliminary data have\nnow been generated. For statistical analyses, SAS software for\nWINDOWS version 9.1 or SUDAAN 10.0 is being used. Sig-\nnificance is defined as a P value ,0.05 with a 2-tailed a.\nRESULTS\nThe results of the correlational analysis between ONQI scores/\nrankings and the mean ranking of the expert panel are shown in\nTable 3. Overall, the correlation was excellent both across and\nwithin food categories.\nThe ONQI score associated with the DASH diet was 46 (95%\nalgorithm was designed to place foods, not diets, on a 100-point\nscale, and thus the absolute numbers in this case are un-\nimportant; the differentiation of scores was the pertinent finding.\nThe distribution of both ONQI raw scores (unadjusted to the\nsociation between raw ONQI scores and the adjusted NuVal\nby chi-square, as shown in Table 5.

Both models, adjusted for age,\nThe results of focus group tests were qualitative. In all 3 groups,\na need for greater clarity in nutrition guidance was expressed,\nalong with support for both the general ONQI concept and its\nexpression on the 100-point scale.

Of these, 86% responded \"agree\" or\n\"strongly agree\" to the statement that the system would affect\ntheir decisions about which foods to purchase in the grocery store.\nBy using these same 2 responses from a 5-point Likert scale as the\nbenchmark, 93% indicated that the system would help them in\nmaking purchase decisions; 74% indicated that they would be\nmore likely to buy a product labeled with the ONQI than one\nwithout. Two-thirds of the respondents (66%) indicated that they\nwould be more likely to shop at a grocery store that used the\nsystem than at one that did not.\neligibility criteria were enrolled; 48% were male. Again by using\nthe 2 \"top box\" responses from a 5-point Likert scale as the\nbenchmark, 87% of this group thought that the system was be-\nlievable, and 85% thought it was unique. More than three-fourths\nof the participants (77%) indicated the system would affect their\npurchase intent. If offered the ONQI system with a 100-point\nscale, or a system with just 4 tiers, 75% expressed a preference for\nthe more detailed guidance of the 100-point scale.\nFinally, early data are available from 2 ongoing evaluations.\nParticipating retailers have reported initial point-of-purchase\ndata that suggests shifts within product categories from items\nwith lower to those with higher NuVal scores (A Maggi,\nNuVal, personal communication, 2009). Aggregated data for\nfood-frequency questionnaires collected from 70,000 women in\nthe Nurses' Health Study and 40,000 men in the Health Pro-\nfessionals Follow-up Study in 1986 indicate that weighted mean\nONQI values are significantly inversely associated with the total\nchronic disease burden, which includes diabetes, cardiovascular\ndisease, and cancer. In this analysis, NuVal is associated with\nlower relative risk values and narrower confidence intervals in the\ntop compared with the bottom quintiles than the HEI 2005 (WC\nWillett, personal communication, January 2010).\nDISCUSSION\nAssessment of the performance characteristics of the ONQI\nused in the NuVal nutritional guidance system began by estab-\nlishing consensus within the multidisciplinary group of nutrition\nand public health scientists who collaborated on its development\nand proceeded to encompass consumer testing, correlational\nanalysis of food lists ranked by experts, and testing of the dis-\ncriminating capacity of the scoring system at the level of the\nwhole diet. Such testing thus far suggests that the algorithm\nfunctions as intended and performs reliably against expert\nopinion and validated measures of diet quality alike while\ngenerating strong support from representative consumers in\nmarket research. In addition, preliminary data suggest that the\nintended effects are occurring at the point-of-purchase as shifts\noccur within product categories from lower- to higher-scoring\nitems after the posting of NuVal scores on shelf tags. Unpublished\ndata from the Harvard School of Public Health (S Chiuve and WC\nWillett, December 2009) suggest that ONQI scores aggregated to\nreflect overall diet quality may be more strongly predictive of\nmajor health outcomes than the HEI 2005.\nNuVal, the organization that oversees the application of the\nONQI system in the marketplace, in conjunction with retail\npartners offering the program in their stores, is studying the point-\nof-purchase effects. These ongoing efforts include intercept\ninterviews with shoppers, online surveys of loyal shoppers,\nsurveys of retail receipts, and detailed analyses of sales trends,\nwith a particular focus on products within specific categories.\nData collection is currently under way in 3 regional supermarket\nchains, totaling .520 individual stores, and will be conducted at\nnew sites as supermarket additional chains roll out the program.\nCurrent program status will continuously be accessible at http://\nwww.nuval.com.\nThere are a number of other nutrition guidance systems in the\nUnited States (12, 13) and even more globally. Systems are in\nvarying stages of implementation and evaluation; some have been\nused as a basis for national nutrition policy (22), and others seem\nto remain principally in the realm of theory (23).\nThe topic has been addressed periodically in the peer-reviewed\nliterature (24), and the level of prevailing interest is suggested\nby 2 d of public hearings on front-of-package nutrition guidance\n(25) convened by the Food and Drug Administration in the fall of\n2007 and more recently by the announcement of direct federal\nAlthough scientific support for NuVal is relatively strong and\npositioned to become stronger in the near term, it should be noted\nthat neither NuVal nor any other system thus far is backed by\nwhat would be truly conclusive science: a prospective assessment\nof real-world populations that uses various nutrition guidance\nsystems to determine which results in the greatest net improve-\nments in food selection, diet quality, and health outcomes. Pro-\nspective, controlled, real-world evaluation of any single system\nwill be costly in time, money, and effort. Even then, the ideal\nstandard, a direct comparison among alternative systems, would\nbe lacking. Perhaps such evidence will be garnered in time, but if\nso, it will come neither quickly, easily, nor inexpensively. Public\nhealth practice, business practice, and policy decisions will need\nto be based on lesser standards of evidence in the interim.\nAmong the standards of scientific validation currently in use,\nthe one that seems to be most emphasized is the assessment of\ncorrelation between nutrient profiling systems and measures of\ndietary quality, in particular derivatives of the HEI (27, 28). As\nnoted here, NuVal has embraced this standard for initial vali-\ndation testing as well. The standard, however, is intrinsically\nflawed and thus should be interpreted cautiously.\nThe measure of the nutritiousness or nutritional quality at the\nlevel of a food, and the level of the whole diet, are distinct.\nLinear regression analysis of the Overall Nutritional Quality Index (ONQI)\nt Test Wald F\nIndependent\nvariable\nb\ncoefficient\nSE\nb\nP value\nWald\nF\nP\nvalue\nModel\n%\nscale\n1 Data are from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nScale values were determined without the glycemic load coefficient for diets\nby using the composite method. H0\n, hypothesis.\n2 Covariates included sex, age (y), and race-ethnicity.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nWhereas broccoli, spinach, and blueberries are universally rec-\nognized as highly nutritious foods--and thus should be scored as\nsuch by any competent nutrient profiling system--a diet com-\nposed exclusively of broccoli, or spinach, or blueberries would be\na very poor diet indeed. Considerations of balance, variety,\ncomplementarity, and the distribution of foods across categories\nare irrelevant at the level of a single food choice, but are fun-\ndamental to the establishment of a healthful diet. In this context,\nthe correlation between the ONQI and HEI 2005 as shown thus\nfar is very encouraging both for being strong and for not being too\nstrong. The distinction between measures of food quality and diet\nquality is reflected in the development of a derivative of the ONQI\nalgorithm for measurement of total diet quality, which is cur-\nrently undergoing initial testing.\nThere is precedent in other areas to suggest that clear, un-\nambiguous, expert guidance should be offered to consumers in\nresponse to an obvious need. The utility of GPS systems for\ngeographical navigation is beyond dispute. The goal of nutrient\nprofiling is quite similar, namely to help people navigate reliably\nand as effortlessly as possible through a complex dietary land-\nscape to the more nutritious food options available to them.\nTwo challenges posed to the NuVal system include its com-\nplexity and transparency, both of which are included among the\ncriteria used to judge the quality of nutrition guidance systems\nendorsed by the ONQI Scientific Advisory Board (Table 7).\nRegarding the first, the food supply in the United States has\n.150,000 distinct food items; the inventory of the average su-\npermarket is nearly 50,000 items. Therefore, a wide variety of\nnutrient considerations is necessary to adjudicate the overall\nnutritional quality of all foods available to consumers. A nutrient\nprofiling system must either ignore, or address, such issues as\npure compared with processed, artificially sweetened, fortified,\nor intrinsically rich in nutrients, etc. The ONQI algorithm ex-\nplicitly addresses all of these and many related considerations.\nAlthough the resulting algorithm is complex, the output offers\nturn-key simplicity: the higher the number, the more nutritious\nthe food. The ONQI achieves appropriately complex function-\nality while preserving simplicity of form. The comprehensive-\nness of the algorithm has allowed for the successful scoring of\nRegarding transparency, the basic contents of the algorithm\nhave been previously published (13) and are posted online (29).\nThis level of transparency is, in fact, rather comparable to that of\nthe branded food products NuVal is used to score because these\nproducts list their ingredients but do not publish their recipe.\nEven the full ONQI \"recipe\" can be shared, and has been, under\nconditions of assured confidentiality. The algorithm is currently\nin use at the Harvard School of Public Health to support ongoing\nresearch there, and it has been shared with other independent\nresearchers as well. However, it must be conceded that the full\nalgorithm ('20 pages of computer programming written in the\nSAS language) is simply not accessible to the average reader\nand that specific numerical values in the formula are currently\nwithheld except under terms of confidentiality.\nThere are, of course, important limitations to the scientific\nassessment of the NuVal program. First, there is no established\ngold standard for the measurement of nutritional quality at\nthe level of a single food. NuVal testing has used prevailing\nmetrics--both the consensus opinion of impartial experts and the\nvalidated measures of dietary quality--for comparison. But\nneither of these is itself well validated as a reliable measure of the\noverall nutritional quality of any given food.\nSecond, there were some specific methodologic limitations to\neach of the steps of ONQI-related research to date. Consumer\nresearch was outsourced to a marketing research group. Although\nthe methods used were reliably state-of-the-art, there is the\npossibility that some bias was introduced. Diet testing required\nuse of the composite recipe method, which is more efficient than\nthe food-by-food method, but less capable of fine discrimination.\nThe composite recipe method required omitting the selective use\nof both the glycemic load and bioflavanoid entries called for in\nthe NuVal program. These omissions further reduce the dis-\ncriminating capacity of the ONQI and compress the range of\nscores achieved at the level of the total diet.

An optimal nutrient\nprofiling system should be designed similarly so that\nderivatives for specific subpopulations (eg, patients with\ndiabetes) may be readily constructed. This requires the\ninclusion of epidemiologic considerations (ie, how\nnutrient properties relate to actual health effects).\nComprehensive An optimal system of nutrient profiling should incorporate\nall aspects of nutritional composition that contribute\nmeaningfully to overall nutritional quality.\nGeneralizable An optimal nutrient profiling system should generate scores\nfor all foods, including branded items, commodity items,\nrecipes, and meals; should allow for comparison on\na single, universal scale both within and across food\ncategories; and should offer sufficiently fine\ndiscrimination to provide meaningful guidance among\nthe choices in any food category.\nImpartial A nutrient profiling system should be free of conflicts of\ninterest and developed and maintained by entities\nuninvolved in the manufacture or sale of specific food\nproducts.\nSimple Nutrient profiling should be clear, unambiguous, and\ninterpretable at a glance by virtually any consumer.\nSophisticated The modern food supply is not simple because it contains\nnatural and highly processed foods; foods with intrinsic\nnutrients and foods fortified with nutrients; and\nmacronutrient food substitutes, etc. A nutrient profiling\nsystem suitable for applying a common metric to the\nwhole food supply must address these complexities.\nSummative A useful nutrient profiling system should generate a single,\naggregated measure of the various inputs so that\na summary measure of overall nutritional quality is\nproduced.\nTimely A useful nutrient profiling system must be updated in an\nimpartial manner and at suitable intervals to keep it\ncurrent with regard to changes in nutrition science, the\nfood supply, and/or the prevailing epidemiology.\nTransparent The methods, measures, and assumptions on which\na nutrient profiling system is based should be sufficiently\ntransparent to the scientific community and to consumers\nalike so that a clear understanding of how the algorithm\nworks is attained.\najcn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nthus to a reduced capacity to show a gradient in scores between\na healthful (eg, DASH) and a typical (eg, NHANES) dietary\npattern along with a reduced correlation between ONQI scores\nand gradients in another metric such as the HEI. Sample testing of\nthe composite recipe scoring method used showed just this effect.\nDespite the introduction of such negative-effect bias, the results\nof diet testing achieved statistical significance. Thus it is\nexpected, albeit not assured, that the results of ongoing study that\nuses more robust and labor-intensive food-by-food scoring\nmethods will provide stronger support for NuVal.\nIn conclusion, NuVal provides a single, summative score for\nthe overall nutritional quality of a food or recipe. The system,\nwhich scores foods from 1 to 100 (the higher the number, the\nmore nutritious the food) is now reaching consumers in .520\nsupermarkets in 19 states with many more scheduled to join over\ndate, and additions to the list are made daily.\nTo the best of our knowledge, NuVal uses the most compre-\nhensive nutrient profiling system yet devised by encompassing an\narray of relevant nutrient entries, as well as by weighting nutrients\non the basis of epidemiologic considerations. In assessments to\ndate, the system has performed well in consumer testing, in\ncomparison with expert opinion, and in comparison with\nestablished measures of diet quality. Preliminary data further\nsuggest the intended effects at the point of purchase and a strong,\ninverse association between aggregated NuVal scores and actual\nThe ultimate test of nutrient guidance systems is a prospective\ncomparison among free-living and comparable populations who\nare monitored for differences in both dietary pattern and health\noutcomes. While waiting for that, assessment of competing\nsystems by an independent authority, such as the Institute of\nMedicine, would be welcome. In the interim, NuVal offers\nguidance that is fully independent of food industry interests and\nhas a solid basis in scientific evaluation.\nWe gratefully acknowledge the clerical assistance of Michelle Evans.\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows--DLK: prepared the initial\ndraft of the manuscript and was responsible for finalizing the editing process;\nVYN, LQR, and KTA: contributed to data analysis and editing of the man-\nuscript; and AR: prepared and provided summary findings of the consumer\nresearch and contributed to final edits of the manuscript content.
