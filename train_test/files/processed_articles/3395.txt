    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe purpose of this article is to develop a new method for corporate diagnosis (CD). To this end, a method is developed\nfor the diagnosis process of project-based companies. The article presents a case study in a large company where data\nhave been collected through focus groups. Project delay, high project cost, and low profitability are examples of project\ndeficiency in project-based companies. Such issues have made managers pay special attention to find effective solutions\nto improve them. Prominent factors are inappropriate strategy, structure, system, human resource management, and\nPMBOK(Project Management Body of Knowledge) processes. Thus, CD and analysis is an important task in improvement\nof corporate performance. The CD model that is developed in this article could be used for project-based companies. The\nproposed method can be used for CD in any project-based company. This article provides an emphatic application of CD as\na prerequisite for restructuring in project-based companies.\n",

Several studies have developed typol-\nogies of environments. Shane (2005) focused on the\nenvironmental change from a new approach. Shane classi-\nfied the change into three categories, namely, technological,\npolitical and regulatory, and social and demographic changes.\nHubert and Sofie (2008) introduced four sets of factors\nrelated to environmental changes that can cause corporate\ninefficiency. They categorized these factors into environ-\nmental changes, immediate environment, management, cor-\nporate policy, and corporate characteristics. Literature has\ndemonstrated that the type of corporate environment influ-\nences the shocks that the corporate may receive.\nEnvironmental change and performance inefficiency affect\ndifferent aspects of a corporate including corporate strategy\nand structure, and human resource management.\nDam construction companies in Iran are the complex ones\nwith frequent radical shocks. This kind of environment may,\nanytime, receive corporate environmental shocks that reduce\nthe efficiency level. The Iranian Water and Power Resources\nDevelopment Company (IWPRDC) is the most important\ndam construction corporation in Iran that has recently\nreceived a number of serious environmental shocks espe-\ncially in terms of a reduction in governmental budget and\nperformance inefficiency. The following are the main ques-\ntions that IWPRDC managers have faced: (a) Which factors\nreduce the performance of organization? (b) Which organi-\nzational factors must be considered in the corporate diagno-\nsis (CD) process in project-based companies?\nAccording to the Weisbord's (1976) model, the main fac-\ntors that must be considered in CD are strategy, structure,\nsystem, and human resource management. But these items\nare not comprehensive for CD in project-based companies\nbecause this model omitted the projects' inefficiency. So, the\nprevious researches have weakness in providing a model that\ncovers the different factors that lead to inefficiency in proj-\nect-based companies. To fill the gap in the literature, this\narticle proposes a method for organizational diagnosis in\nproject-based companies. The main questions of this article\nare as follows:\nQuestion 1: Which factors must be considered in organi-\nzational diagnosis in project-based companies?\nQuestion 2: What are the sub-factors of them? In the\nother words, which items may have had effect on these\nconsidered factors?\n1Department of Entrepreneurship University of Tehran, Iran\n2Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran\n3Islamic Azad University, Mobarakeh, Iran\nCorresponding Author:\nYahya Chaghouee, Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Branch,\nDepartment of Media Management, Tehran, Iran.\nEmail: yahyaatc1@gmail.com\nOrganizational Diagnosis in Project-Based\nCompanies: Challenges and Directions\nBehrouz Zarei1, Yahya Chaghouee2, and Fereshteh Ghapanchi3\n Keywords\ncorporate inefficiency, corporate performance, corporate diagnosis\n2 SAGE Open\nThe remainder of the article is organized as follows.\nSection 2 provides a literature review on CD. Section 3\ndescribes the research methodology and data sources.\nResearch findings are presented in Section 4 followed by\nconcluding remarks.\nLiterature Review\nAfter representing the theory of systems in management,\ndrawing attention has been assigned to environmental\nchanges within the companies. Rapid changes on one hand\nand great financial problems on the other hand, which com-\npanies face, obliged the managers to assign the topics of\nchange management and organizational change in their pri-\noritization (Karimi, Khodaie, & Chaghouee, 2014). So,\nresearch attributed the changes to corporate governance and\nCorporate in transition economies, have also pursued cor-\nporate diagnosis and restructuring eagerly (Makhija, 2004)\nand the importance assigned to the change process within the\ncompanies has been formed the early a point of question:\nwhat is the main cause of inefficiency within the companies?\nTo give a clear response to such question and because the\ncompanies are seeking to improve operating efficiency,\nincrease cash flow, and, ultimately, enhance firm profitabil-\nity (Espen, 2008); the CD has been transformed as a manage-\nrial necessity within the companies. Indeed, CD models help\nthe managers to recognize the weaknesses and efficiency\nexisting in the company, and then concentrate on the most\nimportant cause and finally go through resolving it using an\nin-depth planning (Karimi et al., 2014).\nCorporate diagnosis is a process that involves the three\nsteps of publicly entering a human system, collecting valid\ndata about experiences, and feeding back to the system\ntoward promoting corporate performance (Wu, Dai, &\ncorporate diagnosis such that \"it is defined as a method to\nanalyze the organization aiming at defining organizational\ndeficiencies and planning to resolve them through organiza-\ntional changes and development\". Corporate diagnosis deals\nwith answering three questions: the causes of change (why),\nthe process of change (how), and the content of change\nwhen it comes to CD, studies in the area of corporate devel-\nopment and changes are preoccupied with three main issues:\n(a) development of corporate diagnostic model, (b) the\nchoice of procedures and methods for data collection of diag-\nnosis (the methodology of CD), and (c) methods and tech-\nniques of data processing and making conclusions.\nA corporate diagnosis model is a representation of a cor-\nporate that helps us identify its main components and rela-\ntions between those components for the purpose of\nunderstanding the corporate (as an object of change). The\nmodels are represented in the chronological order in which\nthey first appeared in the literature as follows (Zali, Hosseini,\n6. Congruence model for organization analysis (1977)\n8. Tichy's technical political cultural (TPC) framework\n11. Burke\u00adLitwin model of organizational performance\nAccording to Weisbord's (1976) model and Mckinsey's\n7s framework (Hanafizadeh and Ravasan, 2011): strategy,\nstructure, system, and human resource management are the\nmain factors that must be considered in CD. Despite the\nemphasis of these past researches on these factors as the\nprominent ones that must be assessed in diagnosis process, a\nsuitable method for corporate diagnosis in project-based\ncompanies has not been prepared by previous researchers.\nHerewith, we aim at filling the above-mentioned gap.\nResearch Methodology\nFounded in 1989, the IWPRDC is considered as one of the\nmost prominent corporations in the field of dam construction\nin Iran. The company has 900 qualified staffs. Due to envi-\nronmental changes (especially changes in governmental bud-\ngets), IWPRDC has faced inefficiencies.\nHerewith, the Delphi Method is selected as a research\nmethod that accesses view of an expert group (Karimi,\npurpose of identifying causes of corporate inefficiency. As\ndescribed by Okoli and Pawlowski (2004), the Delphi\nmethod involves three general steps: (a) brainstorming to\nexplore a list of important factors, (b) narrowing down the\noriginal list to the most important ones, and (c) ranking the\nlist of factors.\nThe objective of the first phase is to extract the factors. In\nthis phase, a focus group was formed to determine the defi-\nciency factors. For the next two phases, we had experts in six\ndistinct panels. In brief, panels modified and narrowed down\nthe previous identified factors that reflected the causes of the\npoor performance. While short-listing the factors in the second\nphase, the expert panels rated the factors. The goal of the final\nphase (Phase 3) was to reach a consensus within each panel on\nthe factor ranking. Data were collected through focus groups.\nIn the next section, the data collection process is explained.\nZarei et al. 3\nIn this research, focus group was used to collect data.\nFocus groups are analytical challenges because they com-\nbine three levels of data, including individual, group, and\ngroup interaction (Duggleby, 2005). To analyze group\ndynamics, we considered some of the questions designed by\nIngrid and Christine (2010), such as, \"How closely did the\ngroup adhere to the issues presented for discussion?\" \"What\nwere the contradictions in the discussions?\" \"What common\nexperiences were expressed?\" and \"Was a particular view\ndominant?\"\nFocus groups offer an immediate reaction among the par-\nticipants as they negotiate and confront each other's views\n(Kidd & Parshall, 2000). In this research, we sought agree-\nments among the panel members during the focus group ses-\nsions and paid attention to disagreements.\nThe optimal size of a focus group to ensure a proper dis-\ncussion is generally six to eight participants (Ingrid &\nChristine, 2010). Here, we had a group of eight participants\nwho were randomly selected from the 20 top managers of\nIWPRDC. We held 21 sessions in the corporate diagnosing\nstage. The focus group sessions took 2 to 3 hr each, and they\nwere moderated by a moderator and an observer (co-\nresearcher). The primary role of the moderator was to initi-\nate, observe, facilitate, and conduct discussions among the\nparticipants, while the observer took field notes and observed\nnon-verbal communication patterns among the participants.\nThe sessions were digitally recorded. Data from each focus\ngroup session were analyzed by taking the following steps\n1. Overview: reading the transcript several times to get\na grasp of the material.\n2. De-contextualization: categorizing data according to\nthe main themes in the research guide.\n3. Coding: organizing the text according to emerging\ncategories within each theme.\n4. Conceptualization: identifying the main concepts in\nthe emerging codes and sub-codes.\n5. Re-contextualization: re-arranging the text according\nto the emerging logic.\n6. Documentation: focus groups' participants were\nselected to illustrate and validate the process of anal-\nysis in the next session.\nFindings\nIn today's world, it is imperative to use cutting-edge tech-\nnologies and tools (Ghapanchi, 2013; Ghapanchi & Aurum,\nGhapanchi, Tavana, Khakbaz, & Low, 2012; Najaftorkaman,\nGhapanchi, Talaei-Khoei, & Ray, 2013) to assist companies\nachieve their goals and objectives. This can also assist com-\npanies' executives in their decision making (Ghapanchi &\n2010). In this research, we undertook an in-depth study of\nthe inefficiency in IWPRDC, and found five sets of corporate\ninefficiency. To make this classification, we utilized the\nPMBOK standard, and interviews with key figures of the\ncorporation. Table 1 shows different categories of corporate\ninefficiency.\nThe semantic network shown in Figure 1 illustrates the\nrelationship between inefficiency categories. Figure 1 dem-\nonstrates \"corporate inefficiency,\" \"Is-From\" (I-F), and fac-\ntors A, B, C, D and E. This figure shows which inefficiency\nfactor \"Is-From\" or \"Can-Affect\" the other group. For exam-\nple, factors in category A can affect B, C, and D categories.\nIn addition to external relationships between categories, it\nis valuable to determine the relationship between elements of\neach category. In Figure 1, these relations are shown with\n\"Result-In\" (R-I) and \"Can-Affect\" (C-A) connections,\nwhich demonstrate how the emergence of a problem in one\ncategory leads to inefficiency in other places. Therefore, it is\nrequired to identify the sub-categories in each category (as\ndepicted in Table 2).\nTable 1. Different Categories of the Corporate Inefficiency.\nGroup Definition\nA Inefficiency related to the corporate strategy\nB Related to the corporate systems\nC Inefficiency related to the corporate structure\nD Inefficiency related to the corporate human resource\nmanagement\nE Inefficiency related to the PMBOK processes. This\ncategory is related to the corporate projects\nmanagement deficiencies\nGroup\nA\nCorporate\ninefficiency\nGroup\nB\nGroup\nC\nGroup\nD\nGroup\nE\nFigure 1. Semantic network of deficiency groups of IWPRDC.\nNote. IWPRDC = The Iranian Water and Power Resources Development\nCompany.\n4 SAGE Open\nFigure 2 illustrates relationships among five major cate-\ngories of the corporate inefficiency sources. \"Result-In\"\n(R-I) is a concept that we have used here to demonstrate the\nrelationship between factors contributing to deficiency in\neach group. Uncovering such relationships, which are often\nhidden, is of great value to the management of the company.\nTo make it clear, we make an example. Group D includes\nseven sub-categories. \"Absence or low clarity of personnel\nduties\" (Factor 2) can \"result in\" some problems like \"defi-\nciencies of human resource management\" (Factor 3).\n\"Weakness in recognition of personnel training needs\"\n(Factor 7) may cause \"deficiencies of personnel training pro-\ngrams\" (Factor 4). Also, this network shows that a problem\nlike \"deficiencies of human resource management\" (Factor\n3) results from \"inefficiency of human resource rules\"\n(Factor 5). Moreover, \"inefficiency of personnel motivation\nand encouragement methods\" (Factor 6) can \"result in\" some\nproblems like \"deficiencies of human resource management\"\n(Factor 3).\nAn important aspect of collected data is the frequency of\nfactors and their ranking (see Table 3). According to Table 3,\nthe prominent causes of inefficiency in IWPRDC are struc-\nture problems (M = 4, N = total number of experts in six\npanels = 48). Furthermore, the main sub-factors are E-3 (fre-\n41). It also indicates that the deficiency of corporate struc-\nture and the weakness of PMBOK project processes (espe-\ncially the poor controlling and closing processes) are the\nmain corporate deficiency factor.\nConcluding Remarks\nThis article is an endeavor to highlight the causes of corpo-\nrate inefficiency in project-based companies and illustrates\nhow such agents might threat them, such as our case study\n(i.e., IWPRDC). Discovering the deficiency causes and their\ninternal/external relationships can yield several benefits to\nthe corporate management. This article attempted to illus-\ntrate the main deficiency sources through conducting a study\non structure effects and presenting the results of an in-depth\nstudy of the IWPRDC.\nAccording to first question of this study, sources of corpo-\nrate inefficiency are categorized into five groups: strategy,\nsystem, structure, HRM, and PMBOK processes. The part\nalso presented acquired data through a semantic network and\ndepicted internal and external relationships between the\ncauses of deficiency. It means that during the corporate diag-\nnosis in companies that are implementing some projects, the\nmanagers and researchers must consider these factors and\nevaluate them for their effect on reduction of corporate\nperformance.\nIn addition to the second question, the following items are\ndemonstrated as sub-factors, which must be checked during\ncorporate diagnosis in project-based companies:\n1. Strategy: human resource management strategy,\nfinancial management strategy, supervision and con-\ntrol strategy\n2. System: project supply system, financial preparation\nand control system, projects preparation and control\nsystem, quality management system, contractors and\nadvisors' assessment and selection system, system\nintegration and knowledge management system\nTable 2.

Based on the result of this, in IWPRDC,\nthe main item that must be considered for reduction of inef-\nficiency is structure. So, the implementation of a restructur-\ning project is advised to the managers.\nThis research is not free of limitations. Due to time con-\nstraints, in this study, we examined the proposed CD model\nonly in one Iranian project-based company. Further research\nwould be necessary to evaluate and modify this model by\nutilization in different kinds of project-based companies in\nother countries.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nDuggleby, W.
