Nye (2004)\ndefined soft power as \"the ability to get what you want\nthrough attraction rather than coercion\" via a variety of\nmeans including diplomatic relations, economic assistance,\nand cultural exchange. A country is considered to have more\nsoft power to the extent that their culture inspires admiration\nand respect in other parts of the world. INGOs address the\nmost difficult accountability challenges by representing the\nvulnerable and using the power of persuasion to strengthen,\nor undermine, the legitimacy of the global system (Risse,\nthe world,\" exercising a form of bottom-up, rather than top-\nof alternative contenders for formal political offices, the sta-\nbility of global democratic governance becomes dependent\non effective dialogue with civil society partners who aug-\nment statist politics with civic life politics where govern-\nments are vulnerable to public opinion (Keohane, 2003).\n1Booth University College, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nSherrie Steiner, Associate Professor of Sociology, Booth University\nCollege, 447 Webb Place, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, R3B 2P2.\nEmail: Sherrie_Steiner@BoothUC.ca\nReflexivity in External Religious Leaders'\nSummit Communication Sequences\nThe Social (Re)Construction of\nCosmopolitan Responsibility by World\nReligious Leaders\nSherrie Steiner1\n Keywords\nsociology of religion, sociology, social sciences, social change and modernization, political theory, politics and humanities,\npolitical science, social movements and activism, sociology, risk communication, human communication, communication\nstudies, communication, political sociology, religious studies, humanities, world religions, religious studies, international\nrelations\n2 SAGE Open\nCivil society participation in international governance is\ncurrently an ad hoc, complex, and messy process with\nnumerous well-intentioned actors often working at cross-\npurposes in destabilizing ways (e.g., Gupta, 2008; Steiner,\n2011a). Political scientists struggle to ascertain which of the\nnumerous INGOs should be taken seriously as governance\npartners, and relying on self-identification does not address\nthe need for quality control measures. Recognition by politi-\ncal decision makers is also problematic given that the INGOs\nmost likely to hold decision makers accountable are the ones\nleast likely to be recognized by decision makers that do not\nrecognize a corresponding obligation for accountability on\nmatters of global risk. Buchanan and Keohane (2006) devel-\noped a complex standard useful for identifying governance\npartners amid the throng of INGOs. They hoped their pro-\nposal would temporarily help guide the network of leaders\ntasked with identifying valuable INGO accountability part-\nners, and assist reform efforts by bolstering \"public support\nfor valuable global governance institutions that either satisfy\nthe standard or at least make credible efforts to do so\"\nstandard, Buchanan and Keohane (2006) hoped to clarify\nhow the legitimacy of the global governance system \"does\nnot depend solely upon its own characteristics, but also upon\nthe epistemic-deliberative relationships between the institu-\ntion and epistemic actors outside it\" (p. 411). Buchanan and\nKeohane most likely developed the standard with secular\nINGOs in mind; nonetheless, Steiner (2011b) compared the\nfirst 5 years of religious summitry against their measure as a\nway of ascertaining the extent to which the World Religious\nLeaders' dialogue process might be important for gover-\nnance in transnational relations.\nBut the differences between secular and religious civil\nsociety INGOs should not be glossed over. The democratic\nprinciple separating church and state discourages religious\ninvolvement in politics to inhibit the governmental establish-\nment of religion because of the historic destabilizing effects\nof theocratic religious surveillance of political decision mak-\ning and the suppression of religious freedoms (Bhargava,\nto embody the whole truth in politics is incompatible with an\nidea of public reasons that belongs with democratic citizen-\nship\" (p. 767). Not all public religious impulses harbor such\nmonolithic zeal; however, just as not all religious organiza-\ntypes of religious public engagement may have ideological\nroots in liberal political philosophies such as that of John\nshould be excluded from the public square. But Lock's rea-\nsoning was developed in a context that presumed a develop-\ning nation-state framework; Lock's assumptions are not\nunilaterally applicable given the current post-Westphalian\ncontext, and his work has been critiqued as overly restrictive\n(Waldron, 1993). New governing approaches are evolving in\na globalizing context that is devoid of any formal global gov-\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas (2003) considered religion, in certain\ncontexts, to be an asset for strengthening the democratic pro-\ncess. Religion communicates meaning in ways philosophy\nand science cannot, and to repress it does more than unfairly\nexclude religion; separating faith-based reasoning from pub-\nlic discourse deprives \"secular society from important\nresources of meaning\" (p. 109)--including the beneficial\ntype of religious reasoning (Habermas, 2006, p. 8). Max\nWeber expressed concern long ago over how the overra-\ntionalization of society might result in a dual crisis of man-\nagement and meaning rendering bureaucratic governments\nunable to generate the political will needed for resolving\nsocial problems (Roth & Schluchter, 1979). Audi and\nWolterstorff (1997) suggested that impartiality, rather than\nseparation, is sufficient to meet the neutrality requirement\nfor political engagement. Alternatively, Roger Finke has\ninterpreted the separation of church and state as a political\nact of religious deregulation aimed at protecting the free\nexpression of religious minorities in the religious market,\npotentially introducing a new era of religious diversity\n(Finke, 1990); the separation of church and state, according\nto Finke, may have been intended more as a removal of reli-\ngious monopolization than a removal of religion, per se, such\nthat diverse religious inclusion, rather than exclusion, might\nmark the future of democracy. Campbell (2006) and Willaime\n(2006) have indicated that further clarification of the com-\nplex dynamics of religious engagement in the ultramodern\npublic sphere, with a particular emphasis on reflexivity, is\nneeded. Transnational religion as a form of civil society may\nbe emerging in a context of fading nation-states (Rudolph &\nPiscatori, 1997). That said, scholarship on religious soft\npower in international relations has been consistently\ndescribed in terms of dual streams where religious non-gov-\nernmental organizations (RNGOs) are described as either\nthreats to, or reinforcers of, the global system, but not as civil\nsociety governance partners (e.g., Banchoff, 2008; Falk,\ninfluence in international relations has been primarily\ndescribed in terms of a fundamentalistic impulse to remake\nthe world in the image of particular monolithic religious\nUlrich Beck (2005) described how the Bush Government\nexploited the rhetoric of peace in the wake of the events of\nSeptember 11 to silence dissent and spread the \"American\nway of life\" and American values as the only acceptable road\nto a singular modernity. Islamophobia also increased (Eck,\nopened where human rights violations became justified by\nU.S. foreign policy (Beck, 2005). Scholarship focused on the\nreturn of public religion as a challenge to theories of secular-\nization and predictions of fundamentalisms' decline; little\nattention has been paid to qualitative shifts and diverse\napproaches occurring within the repoliticized religious\nsphere (Halafoff, 2013). Where governance implications\nhave been noted, as when Casanova (1994) concluded that\nsome forms of international religious involvement might\nhelp modernity save itself \"through a Habermasian practical\nrationalism of the traditional lifeworld\" (p. 229), any posi-\ntive contribution religions might make were said to be unin-\nIntentional governance as an explicit role for religion in\ninternational relations has yet to be recognized in religious\nsoft power scholarship despite the \"return of religion\" to\ninternational relations (e.g., Banchoff, 2008; Fox & Sandler,\n2011). Religious diplomacy also remains underresearched\noffer anecdotal recognition of how religious INGOs have\nplayed pivotal temporary \"governance\" roles during times of\nsocial change such as when Apartheid in South Africa was\nabolished in favor of the new South Africa or when the\nSolidarity Movement rose to power in Poland (Berger, 2003).\nHalafoff has identified religious governance capability\nwhere religions \"can act as both critics and partners of state\nactors, on matters of common security within a cosmopoli-\ntan, deliberative framework\" (Halafoff, 2013, p. 18), but reli-\ngious governance dynamics remains a theoretical box in\nThere are several historic shifts associated with religion's\nreturn to international relations that merit research attention.\nThe multifaith movement is one of the few global move-\nments to show empirical growth during the early 2000s\ncoming together in dialogue with one another to voice global\nethics is historically unprecedented (Armstrong, 2007; Kung,\n1991). Religious summitry where leaders of the world reli-\ngions engage in intentional governance efforts toward seri-\nous, consistent and persistent credible conversation with the\npolitical leaders of the world is entirely new (Steiner, 2011b,\nits first office dedicated to outreach to the global faith com-\nmunity and religious leaders (Tenety, 2013). Faith networks\nare deeply rooted in local communities, strongly represented\namong the poor and vulnerable, and are among some of the\nbest organized civil institutions in the world (Berger, 2003).\nInternational relations scholars have begun to struggle with\nthe complex ways in which religion influences politics, but\nthey agree that a prime cause of the global resurgence of reli-\ngion in politics is the rising demand for mass political par-\nticipation with religion particularly connected to populist\npolitics in the developing world where there is a perceived\nfailure of the secular state to address basic needs (Snyder,\nEmpirical investigation into religious governance in inter-\nnational relations requires identification of appropriate mea-\nsures. For Habermas (2006), reflexivity is the key indicator\nfor governance communication; the absence of this skill is\nwhat makes fundamentalism so problematic in the public\nrealm. Constructive faith-based public dialogue, says\nHabermas (2006), must have \"the epistemic ability to con-\nsider one's own faith reflexively from the outside and to\nrelate it to secular views\" (pp. 9-10). The Summits of World\nReligious Leaders represent an important case study for\nempirical identification of a governance role, if any, for reli-\ngions in international relations because of the deliberate,\nconsistent, and persistent governance efforts that have been\npolitical leaders in dialogue about global risks (Steiner,\nrepresentation of all major world religions since 2006. The\nreligious network, measurement problems notwithstanding,\nhas been estimated to involve a constituency in excess of 800\nmillion that is becoming increasingly politicized over time\nreflexivity of summitry communicational sequences furthers\nour understanding of religious governance beyond the self-\nidentification and public involvement of religious leaders by\nlending insight into the quality of the communication itself.\nAccordingly, the research question reads as follows:\nResearch Question 1: In what ways, if at all, do the sum-\nthe world religious leaders and the G8 political leaders\ndemonstrate reflexivity?\nThe unit of analysis for this sample is text based on nine\nstatements derived from the World Religious Leaders'\ntanism to operationalize reflexivity (Beck & Grande, 2010;\nBeck & Lau, 2005), and discuss how the dynamic interplay\ninvolving shifting scales and multi-level reflexivity vari-\nously affects the governance process. Second, I consider\nreflexivity in the case study of the summits from 2005 to\n2012. Finally, I conclude by discussing the broader implica-\ntions of these findings and suggest directions for future\nresearch.\nTheoretical Development and Data\nReflexivity is an abstract concept, the operationalization of\nwhich is a complex process that inevitably involves the con-\nstructed interpretation of reality. The concept neither corre-\nsponds to nor accurately and exhaustively represents its\nobject, but neither is the concept an arbitrary unbridled\ninvention. The concept is twice interpreted: first, by the par-\nticipants in the original context and, second, by the social\nscientist (Drysdale, 1996). Distinguishing interpretation\nfrom explanation, Max Weber said that interpretation with-\nout explanation is not yet knowledge, and explanation with-\nscientific knowledge is only constructed when explanation is\nconstructed with interpreted concepts to avoid reification.\n4 SAGE Open\nHow reflexivity is operationalized affects the contribution\nthat theories of religious reflexivity might make to under-\nstanding the complex ways in which dialogue facilitates\ntrustbuilding across highly distrusting public networks or,\nalternatively, legitimizes existing modernist forms of gover-\nnance via \"the manufacture of consent.\" Reflexivity has been\nvariously defined as the ability to see oneself as object, self-\ncritical reflection, or as thought turned in on itself freely\nexamining its own presuppositions and assumptions. Such an\noverly agentic conception frequently reduces reflexivity to a\ncognitive process, the ahistorical operationalization of\nwhich--decontextualized from structural constraints--\nimplies a world full of more emancipatory potential than\nwhat is practicably possible within actual embedded histo-\nreductionistic tendency is to conflate the historical move-\nment toward social individuation (e.g., the detraditionaliza-\ntion of community, family, etc.) with methodological\nindividualism (Chang & Song, 2010). Individualistic con-\nceptions of reflexivity uncritically assume a teleology of\nself-mastery and imbue the theory with \"sociologically\nunsustainable visions of personal sovereignty and political\nemancipation\" that \"celebrates a form of middle-class indi-\nvidualism\" (Farrugia, 2013, p. 2). The danger in using an\noverly agentic conceptualization of reflexivity is that it may\nembed a form of cultural capital within the concept and unin-\ntentionally mask how underlying assumptions derive from\nThreadgold & Nilan, 2009). Efforts at countering these\nweaknesses with a historically sensitive empiricism, how-\never, reveal a new problem running through sociological\nmethods and conceptual frameworks--methodological\na study of religious soft power in the cosmopolitical realpo-\nlitik stream of cosmopolitan social theory allows me to oper-\nationalize reflexivity with attention to each of these\nweaknesses--ahistoricity, methodological individualism,\nteleology of self-mastery, and methodological nationalism--\nby emphasizing the historical development and structural\nembeddedness of diverse cosmopolitan coalitions of actors\nin specific diverse contexts (Beck & Grande, 2010). The\nnation-state becomes a variable associated with multiple\npaths into second modernity (Beck & Lau, 2005).\nInternational relations becomes marked by the complex\ninteraction between nations entering from various paths\nincluding those marked by privilege, time compression, and\nthe embedded structural constraints of a postcolonial history\n(Beck & Grande, 2010). Transnational relations are thus\ncharacterized by a \"cosmopolitan dialectic\" of the centripe-\ntal, unifying process associated with the formation of a\n\"world risk society\" and the centrifugal, diversifying pro-\ncesses associated with the coexistence and \"hegemonic com-\npetition between different types and visions of modernity\"\nemerges out of the macro context as nationalistic identities\ngive way to transnational recognitions that nation-states are\ninterdependent and entangled with one another. In contrast to\nthe national perspective (which excludes the otherness of the\nother), the cosmopolitan perspective reflexively includes the\notherness of the other (Beck, 2002, p. 18). It is a method of\ninclusive oppositions that unveils and rejects the logic of\nexclusive oppositions that underpins methodological nation-\nnotion that Western institutions move from modernity to a\n21st-century postmodernity in favor of an empirical research\nprogram that studies the historical ultramodern transforma-\ntion of basic institutions such as religion, the nation-state,\n(2002), \"`the cosmopolitanization thesis'is a methodological\nconcept which helps to overcome methodological national-\nism and build a frame of reference to analyse the new social\nconflicts, dynamics and structures of Second Modernity\" (p.\n18). The perspective is able to grasp how the pluralization of\nnation-state borders implodes the dualism between the\nnational and international with an inner globalization that\nintroduces a legitimation crisis of the national morality of\nexclusion . . . it produces questions as to the distribution of\nglobal responsibilities: Why do we have to recognize a special\nmoral responsibility towards other people just because, by\naccident, they have the same nationality? Why should they be\nfree of any moral sensibility towards other people for the sole\nreason that they happened to be born on the other side of the\nnational fence? What loses any legitimacy is the fundamentally\ndubious assumption that such responsibilities are absolute\nwithin a border, while their absence is equally absolute outside\nthis border . . . [C]osmopolitanism lacks orientation . . . There is,\nin any case, a greater felt need for an evident ethical dimension\nBeck (2002) described cosmopolitanism as involved, and\nput at risk by, a global market that is a new form of \"orga-\nnized irresponsibility\" (p. 26). The task of those living in\ncosmopolitan societies is to define and construct a collec-\ntively shared future crisis without adequate forms of institu-\ntionalized action (Beck, 2002). The global sphere of\nresponsibility within the cosmopolitical framework is\nCosmopolitical realpolitik does not appeal (at least not primarily)\nto shared ideas and identities, but to power and interests to be\nbrought into play. If we adopt such a \"realist\" perspective, the\ncrucial question is how the hegemonic \"meta-power games\" of\nglobal domestic politics (Weltinnenpolitik) can be shaped and\ninterests pursued in such a way that they serve the realization of\ncommon cosmopolitan goals . . . [H]ow can private vices be\ntransformed into public, cosmopolitan virtues? (Beck & Grande,\nReflexivity emerges out of strategies of self-limitation\nthrough the \"recognition of the legitimate interests of others\nand their inclusion in the calculation of one's own interests\"\ngiven a realistic experience of global risks and material inter-\nreflexivity is an expression of self-creation emerging from\nthe social capital accumulated within structures of privilege,\nbut for Beck (1997), reflexivity leads to a \"paradoxical com-\npulsion for the construction, self-design and self-staging of\none's own biography\" (p. 96), paradoxical because the sub-\nject must make \"decisions, possibly undecidable decisions,\ncertainly not free, but forced by others and wrested out of\noneself under conditions that lead into dilemmas\" (p. 97).\nIdeas do not cause social change in this perspective, but ideas\nmay just possibly influence the unfolding of history through\nthe decisions people must inevitably make.\nWhether a problem has a cosmopolitan solution depends on the\nnormative and institutional framework in which decisions have\nto be taken . . . the basic message of cosmopolitan realpolitik is\nthis: The future is open. It depends on [the] decisions we make.\nHistorically contextualized operationalizations of reflex-\nivity are admittedly conceptually ambiguous because the\nprinciples and institutions of \"Second Modernity\" are as nor-\nmative as they are theoretical, but for our purposes here, the\ngains in being able to offer explanation, unmask privilege, be\nsensitive to diversity and identify social forces of constraint\noutweigh the costs associated with inadequate conceptual\nclarity and double interpretation (Beck & Grande, 2010, p.\n(2003), researchers bear a particular responsibility, having\n\"invented modernity,\" to \"find answers to the problems of\nboth how to conceptualize the possibility of `other moderni-\nties' and how to arrange institutions of transnational, transre-\nligious dialogue for its supply\" (p. 8). The World Religious\nLeaders' Summits is one of these transnational, transreli-\ngious social spaces where leaders gather to dialogue with the\nG8 political leaders about how decisions in a globalizing\nworld impact the poor and the vulnerable. To adequately\nstudy this dialogue, the theory frame must be sensitive to\ndiversity, social forces, interdependencies and structural con-\nstraints. Methodological cosmopolitanism incorporates\nrespect for the particularities of diversity, sources risks in\nexternalities (e.g., ecological risk, nuclear risk), as well as\ninternalities (e.g., insufficiently regulated financial markets),\npresumes nation-state fragility and interdependent entangle-\nment, and expands the scope of study to include those \"for\nwhom cosmopolitanism is not a lifestyle choice, but the\ntragic involuntary condition of the refugee or otherwise dis-\ncosmopolitanism remains an appropriate choice despite its\ndrawbacks and limitations because it operationalizes reflex-\nivity in a way that captures the type of dialogue associated\nwith the topics discussed at the Summits (e.g., food insecu-\nrity, environmental risk, etc.). According to Feindt (2012),\nwhether and how the plurality of diverse perspectives are\ntaken into account and become effective \"are at the heart of\nthe quest for reflexive governance\" (p. 164).\nData and Qualitative Content Analysis\nIllustrative data were used as informative evidence to\ndevelop, not test, the theory of religious soft power as reflex-\nive governance. This study covers Round 1 of the summit\nanalysis of the communicational sequences between the\ncommunicants over the 8-year span. Summit statements are\nappropriate indicators of the dialogue process because each\nstatement was written with the input and approval of all reli-\ngious leader participants at each summit, and because each\nstatement was immediately delivered at the conclusion of\nmeetings to political G8 Sherpas and/or media representa-\ntives for public dissemination. Finally, as the methodological\napproach taken in this article is twice interpreted and there-\nfore inexact, I have disciplined my interpretations by draw-\ning the meaning units, specific characteristics, and underlying\ntheoretical assumptions about reflexivity that require further\nillumination from the literature review. While there is no\nsingle correct meaning or universal application of research\nfindings, I have made every effort to ensure the transferabil-\nity of these findings to other settings and groups by offering\na clear and distinct description of the analysis process to\nestablish arguments for the most probable interpretations.\nAccording to Beck (2002), the pluralization of borders is the\nmost basic indicator of reflexive modernization (at the macro\nlevel). When people are reflexive, dualisms implode and bor-\nders that demarcate categories such as national or interna-\ntional \"are no longer predeterminate--they can be chosen\n(and interpreted) . . . redrawn and legitimated anew\" (p. 19).\nDrawing on Beck (2002), I analyze the sample according to\nthe following meaning units: (a) evidence of accepting the\nlogic of inclusive oppositions, (b) evidence of rejecting the\nlogic of exclusive oppositions, (c) evidence of cosmopolitan\nflashpoints, and (d) evidence of shared responsibility for\ngovernance of the future, (e) evidence of rejecting the logic\nof inclusive oppositions and accepting the logic of exclusive\noppositions was identified as non-reflexive communication\nthat serves to reify, rather than blur, boundaries. The texts\nwere read through several times to obtain a sense of the\nwhole before dividing the text into meaning units, condensed\nmeaning units, codes, sub-themes and themes. Examples of\nmeaning units, condensed meaning units, and codes are\nshown in Table 1. The whole context was considered when\ncondensing and labeling meaning units with codes. When\npossible, I used condensed direct quotes during aggregation\nto reduce the amount of interpretive bias introduced in the\nabstraction process of moving from text to code creation and\ntheme categorization.

It involves real\nhuman suffering\" (Wrlss-G, 2007). Policy recommendations\nwere often specific, such as when they recommended that the\nG8 provide 0.7% of GDP for development assistance (World\nReligious Leaders' Summit Statement\u00adFrance [Wrlss-F],\nand fulfill the Millennium Development Goals (Wrlss-C,\nLeaders' Summit Statement\u00adItaly [Wrlss-I], 2009; Wrlss-\nSummit Statement\u00adUnited States [Wrlss-US], 2012). At\ntimes, recommendations were \"biting\" as when they said that\nthe \"Economic Partnership Agreements\" of the European\nUnion need \"a dimension of ethical responsibility and a con-\nvincing development agenda\" (Wrlss-G, 2007). Leaders\nmade reference to scientific academies (e.g., Japanese\nScience Academy in World Religious Leaders' Summit\nStatement\u00adJapan/Kyoto [Wrlss-J/K], 2008) or quoted\nrespectable scientific sources such as The Academies of\nScience's Climate Change Adaptation and the Transition to\na Low Carbon Society statement (Wrlss-J/K, 2008) or The\nUnited Nations World Food Program's Vulnerability Analysis\nand Mapping Report (Wrlss-US, 2012).

It follows that\nthe security of one actor of international relations must not\nbe detrimental to others\" (Wrlss-J/S, 2008). A de-centered\nnation-state perspective was evident in how they viewed the\nG8 process itself. \"The voices of the other 172 members of\nthe United Nations are absent,\" they noted, and the voices of\nthe weak and vulnerable \"must be included in decisions\"\n(Wrlss-C, 2010). Violent defense of religious boundaries was\njust as consistently and persistently rejected by religious\nleaders as was nationalism. In 2008, leaders stated that \"reli-\ngious communities have roles in building peace . . . all reli-\ngions have at times been misused in fomenting violence. We\nreject this misuse of religions and commit ourselves to\nengaging our communities for the common good\" (Wrlss-\nJ/S, 2008). In Japan, violent defense of boundary mainte-\nnance was rejected in all its forms:\nTerrorism . . . is never morally justified whether it is perpetrated\nby individuals, groups or states. Moreover, military responses to\nterrorism injure innocent persons, provide additional motivation\nfor terrorist groups and endanger basic freedoms in the societies\nattempting to protect themselves from terrorism . . . Every effort\nmust be made to utilize non-violent means to thwart terrorism\nand resolve disputes to advance peace. (Wrlss-J/S, 2008)\nLeaders rejected environment or society and present or\nfuture dualisms, claiming that \"it is unethical to burden\nfuture generations with excessive pollution or other gross\nenvironmental imbalances. Development must be environ-\nmentally sustainable\" (Wrlss-J/S, 2008). And when leaders\nmet in Russia, they rejected ways in which a globalizing\neconomy objectifies human relations, stating that \"humans\nshould not become either a commodity or an object of politi-\ncal manipulation or an element of the production and con-\nAlternatively, leaders accepted what Beck refers to as the\nlogic of inclusive oppositions. Leaders blurred the society or\nnature dualism, expressing shared concern for the need to\n\"face up to environmental dangers . . . [that] divide what\nshould be our interdependent human communities\" (Wrlss-\nMany are considering sincerely whether we can survive on the\nEarth . . .

[W]e all live in one\nworld\" (Wrlss-I, 2009). Leaders were clear that any con-\ncerted response to the entangled problems of the modern\nworld would require international cooperation:\nCurrent events around the world . . . make clear that people\neverywhere are demanding that their fundamental dignity be\nhonoured. Countries must work together to ensure protection of\nthe right to freedom of religion as well as political self-\ndetermination. Tolerance, openness and understanding of other\npeoples' cultures social structures, values and religions are\nessential to the very survival of an interdependent world.\nLeaders blurred religious boundaries, stating how \"reli-\ngious traditions . . . summon their followers to the path of\nmulti-religious cooperation for the common good\" (Wrlss-\nJ/K, 2008), but they also blurred the boundary between the\nsacred and the secular:\nOur communities are ready to develop dialogue with the\nadherents of non-religious views, with politicians, with all civil\nsociety structures, and with international organizations . . . This\ndialogue should be conducted on an equal footing, in a\nresponsible way and on a regular basis, with openness to any\nthemes, without ideological prejudice. (Wrlss-R, 2006)\nLeaders blurred the boundary associated with time, stat-\ning that\nall humans live in one world . . . [T]he well-being of one is\nrelated to the well-being of others and . . . the earth . . . [T]he\npast, present and future are linked. Together, we must\nacknowledge past failings, face present challenges and accept\nour responsibilities to future generations. (Wrlss-J/K, 2008)\nOther blurred dualisms include attention to how global-\nization is impacting the family, they expressed \"concern for\nthe status of women and children in many societies\" and\nspoke about how \"protecting them from violence and exploi-\ntation is a common task\" (Wrlss-R, 2006).

This\nmeans all of us in the prosperous world, governments, churches,\nthe media and populations stand under judgement, to the degree\nthat we fail to respond to such a situation with costly compassion\nand generosity, so that we may help in God's name and by God's\ngrace to secure justice for the poor. (Wrlss-UK, 2005)\nIn 2006, they offered further reasons, explaining how leaders\nfrom 49 countries from Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist,\nHindu, and Shinto religious communities were able to reach\nagreement on how religion might continue to play a role in\ndeveloping ethics and strengthening social order (Wrlss-R,\nthe common belief in human dignity and justice whether\nit was rooted in the Jewish focus on the protection of the\noutsider, the Christian presence of God's presence among\nthe poor, the Islamic tradition of the equality of all human\nbeings, the Hindu concept of Sewa, or the Buddhist ethi-\ncal philosophy embracing interconnectedness or the Shinto\nbelief in humans as children of the Kami (Wrlss-G, 2007). In\n2007, religious leaders started to point out that the Heads of\nState and Government, by adopting the Millennium Devel-\nrecognised that in addition to their separate responsibilities to\ntheir own individual societies, they had a collective responsibility\nto uphold the principles of human dignity, justice and equity at\nthe global level and declared poverty alleviation as an\noverarching goal of international co-operation. (Wrlss-G, 2007)\nBy 2008, religious leaders stood united in their common\ncommitment to justice and the protection of human life and\nthe well-being of the planet. From that point on, the leaders\nfocused more directly on offering reflections and recommen-\ndations to the G8 leaders, offering a form of moral will that\nmight translate into increased political will by the G8 on\nbehalf of the poor and vulnerable. They consistently appealed\nto the MDGs as a common point of agreement for shared\ngovernance with the G8 on behalf of the common good.\nAlthough the initial focus was less concrete and more\nfocused on \"doing the right thing\" in ways that might be con-\nsidered utopian, religious leader statements quickly evolved\ntoward concrete recommendations that could be realized\nwith changed priorities--especially when it came to the\ndefense budget. \"[E]xtreme poverty at a time of unprece-\ndented wealth is a moral scandal . . . [W]e call for the funds\nachieved from the reduction of defense budgets to be allo-\ncated in support of sustainable development and poverty\nreduction\" (Wrlss-J/S, 2008). Religious leaders challenged\nshort-term decision making, urging G8 leaders to make deci-\nsions with a longer time frame in mind:\n[W]e are concerned about \"short-termism.\" The kinds of long-\nterm responsibility and accountability by which we shall save\nour children's future are not yet devised anywhere . . . we must\nappraise ruthlessly what we have achieved for our ailing world,\nin these times of planetary emergency.

This compels us to ask [that]\nyou reformulate our governments'policies to be fair to all life on\nReligious leaders challenged the highly consumptive\neconomies of the G8 countries, noting that \"industrialized\ncountries have caused a disproportionate amount of environ-\nmental damage.

The texts\nbecame a form of cultural capital used by religious leaders to\naccomplish the social construction of cosmopolitan respon-\nsibility. Religious leaders used the language of \"calling\" to\ninvite G8 leaders to redefine the boundaries of what they\nconsider to be responsible decision making:\n[We] call on the G8 . . . and all peoples of good will . . . to life-\ngiving and life-sustaining progresses in the lives of our sisters\nand brothers and our planet. We both call for and pledge\nourselves to the future of life. (Wrlss-G, 2007)\nReligious leaders consistently spoke of offering their\nreflections in a \"spirit of collaboration and co-responsibility\n. . . working together across religious lines for the common\ngood and with governments and other partners of good will\"\n(Wrlss-F, 2011).

Religious leaders\ncalled for collaboration as a counter to the hegemonic com-\npetition that tends to influence the decision-making process:\nIn developing countries . . . growth, poverty reduction and\nenvironmental stewardship must journey together. This requires\ninnovative leadership in these countries along with increased\ncollaboration between rich and poor countries. (Wrlss-C, 2010)\nWith each statement, the identified values are derived\nfrom diverse religious identities, but the consistent reference\nto current events, social problems, shared interests, mutual\nconcerns, and the responsible exercise of power in the deci-\nsion-making process cumulatively indicate that this dialogue\nprocess is about the negotiation and redefinition of the nor-\nmative framework in which decisions have to be taken in the\nhegemonic \"meta-power games\" of the G8 Summit process.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, I advance our understanding of religious soft\npower as governance by empirically investigating reflexivity\nin the case study of the World Religious Leaders' Summits\nognized as influential in international relations in the era of\nglobalization, only the secular governance role of soft power\nhas been widely acknowledged by scholars. Many studies of\nreligious soft power use a dichotomist description that\nobscures a more complex and nuanced understanding of the\ninterplay between religion, nationalism, and social move-\nments. I shed light on this differential treatment of religious\nand secular soft power through empirical investigation for\nevidence of reflexive governance in the first round of the\nWorld Religious Leaders' Summits.\nCareful attention has been paid to understand reflexivity\nas a historically embedded process. Using data from nine\nsummits held over a period of 8 years, I have described how\nthe network of religious leaders reflexively interface with the\nG8 leaders to negotiate the legitimacy of their impending\ndecisions in light of their moral responsibility to the poor and\nvulnerable of the world. Religious leaders do this by blurring\nboundaries that hinder international collaboration and coop-\neration, and rejecting those who would use violence to inten-\nsify those boundaries. Religious leaders offer cosmopolitan\norientation to G8 leaders who gather to make decisions that\nimpact a world put at risk by a global market that Beck\n(2002) describes as a new form of \"organized irresponsibil-\nity\" (p. 26). Religious leaders draw on their cultural capital\nto redefine boundaries for cosmopolitan responsibility to\ninclude the interests of the poor and vulnerable who are\nimpacted by, but excluded from, the G8 decision-making\nprocess. By influencing the normative framework in which\nG8 decisions have to be taken, religious soft power influ-\nences international relations to the extent that G8 leaders\naccept moral responsibility for the poor and vulnerable, tak-\ning their interests into account when making the decisions\nthat they must inevitably make. The findings illustrate a form\nof second-order reflexivity where religious soft power\nreframes the normative framework within which decisions\nmust be made in ways that enable conversations over border\nconflicts to be transformed into conflicts over the drawing of\nboundaries.\nThis work advances our understanding of religious soft\npower by identifying an important transnational religious\ngovernance partner for international relations within a theo-\nretical framework that captures the limitations of constrain-\ning social forces. The Summits of World Religious Leaders\nmay be important for political leaders looking for gover-\nnance partners representative of well-organized civil society\nnetworks that are deeply rooted in local communities strongly\nrepresented among the poor and vulnerable.\nThis study also offers an important corrective to overly\nagentic interpretations of religious soft power by operation-\nalizing reflexivity using methodological cosmopolitanism.\nReligious leaders display awareness of real world events,\nlimitations, risks, and possibilities in their dialogue for more\njustice on behalf of the poor. The theory frame provides a\ncontextualized framework for the realistic management of\ndemocratic expectations as religious leaders dialogue with\ntheir constituency, as well as their political peers, about\nglobal risks and responsibilities. Religious leaders have been\ntheorized to influence G8 leaders only to the extent that reli-\ngious leaders are able to convince, and access their constitu-\nencies to politically pressure, political leaders to adopt\nstrategies of self-limitation through the recognition of the\nlegitimate interests of the excluded vulnerable others, and to\ninclude the interests of the vulnerable others in the calcula-\ntion of their own interests in light of the realistic experience\nof global risks and material interdependencies. G8 leaders\nare the ones who exercise power and influence with the deci-\nsions that they make. According to Beck and Grand (2010),\n\"the basic message of cosmopolitan realpolitik is this: The\nfuture is open. It depends on decisions we make\" (p. 437).\nReligious leaders speak into that decision process with ques-\ntions of \"in whose interests\" do the G8 leaders make these\ndecisions.\nFuture research on reflexive governance will need to\nexplore whether and how the plurality of perspectives offered\nby religious leaders is taken into account by third-party\nobservers and/or the G8 leaders themselves. Further research\nis also needed to explore how governance dynamics operate\nwithin religious networks including the interplay between\nfirst-order and second-order reflexivity in the ongoing\nthe Summit process affected by tensions between pressures\nto maintain action capacity and pressures to open up prob-\nlem handling for further contextualization (Voss, Bauknecht,\nthe Summit process became so focused on problem solving\nthat they ceased to ask the larger questions? Are there times\nwhen leaders were so focused on questioning underlying\nassumptions and priorities that the strategic capabilities of\nthe gathering eroded? Does the Summit process vacillate\nbetween the two extremes, or does the process at some point\nopen up to adopt a diverse portfolio strategy of experiments\nand alternate frameworks of problem definition, goals and\noptions? Further research is also needed to determine the\nextent to which religious leaders actually represent their con-\nstituencies and are able to mobilize them toward political\nengagement on behalf of the interests of the vulnerable.\n"
