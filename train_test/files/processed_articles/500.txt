Subramanian2*\n1 Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America, 2 Department of Society, Human\nDevelopment and Health, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America\n Introduction\nSocial class and economic well-being have been identified as\nimportant social determinants that shape health inequalities\n[1,2,3,4,5]. In India, social castes were previously considered as\na proxy for socioeconomic status and poverty [6]. A nationally\nrepresentative study on India based on the 1981 census indicated\nthat under-five child mortality in the lower castes, Scheduled\nTribes and Scheduled Castes, were significantly higher than upper\nSurvey (NFHS) demonstrated an increase in mortality rates of\nneonates, infants, and under five children in progressively\ndisadvantaged social castes [8,9]. In more detail, a study on an\nurban population of North India provided evidence that\ncardiovascular-related mortality was more prevalent in higher\nsocial castes whereas infections-related mortality was more\nprevalent in lower social castes [10]. Similarly, based on the\ndifferentially associate with household wealth and much less with\ncaste [8]. In this study, we provide an update of the most recent\nassociation between social caste, economic factors and mortality in\nIndia using individual data from the India Human Development\nMethods\nStudy Design and Data\nThe cross-sectional data was drawn from the India Human\nDevelopment Survey (IHDS) [11], a nationally representative,\nmulti-topic survey collected from November 2004 to October\nurban households in India. Villages and urban blocks formed the\nwhich the sample of households was selected [11]. The survey\nresponse rates were calculated as 92% for the total sample [11].\nThe lowest unit of observation was the individual member,\nincluding 1609 who died in the previous year. Data on age and\ngender for both living and deceased household members were\ncollected. The deceased household members were assumed to\nhave belonged in the similar caste and religion as other household\nmembers and benefited from similar quality of living based on\nshared household income, assets and consumption. One house-\nhold was defined as a group of people living under one roof and\nsharing the same kitchen.\nOutcome and Predictors\nThe study outcome measure was a dichotomous variable\nindicating whether an individual was dead (1) or alive (0).\nCaste and religion of the household were self-identified by the\nhead of household. The caste categories were separated into\nBrahmin, High Caste, Other Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes\n(Dalit), Scheduled Tribes (Adivasi), and No Caste. Other\nBackward Classes, Dalits and Adivasis are considered the lower,\nmarginalized social groups in India [12]. The individuals in IHDS\nthat self-identified as No Caste were further stratified according to\ntheir religion into Muslims, Christians and Sikhs and Jains\ncombined.\nDetailed household income data was collected from queries of\nover 50 different income sources. The queries were categorized\ninto eight major household income types: family farm income,\nhousehold agricultural wages, non-agricultural wages, salaries, net\nbusiness income, sum household remittance, government benefits,\nand property and pensions. The current analysis used the\naggregated total income data and divided it into quintile groups\nand a group that reported negative household income.\nThe variable for household assets was a score constructed from\nthe summation of 22 equally weighted dichotomous items\nmeasuring household possessions of consumer goods and eight\naspects of housing quality. The household asset score was divided\ninto quintiles for the current analysis.\nThe consumption variable was constructed from a standard\nbattery of 47 expenditure questions taken from the short form of\nIndia's National Sample Survey. These included 30 questions on\nmonthly expenditure and 17 questions on annual expenditure\nreported for the previous year. The final consumption total was\ncalculated as the sum of the expenditure on monthly items and one\ntwelfth of the expenditure on annual items. The monthly\nconsumption per capita was divided into quintiles for the current\nanalysis.\nAge was divided into six categories to capture the different stages\nof life course: infants (,1 year), young children (1\u00ad5 years), children\nadults (45\u00ad64 years) and elderly ( = 65 years). Other predictors were\ngender and residency location. Residency location was divided into\nthree categories: rural villages, urban neighborhoods that were not\nMumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad\n(population .100 000). The data on residency location was based\non the India Census 2001, where an urban neighborhood must have\npopulation engaged in non-agricultural pursuits and a population\ndensity of at least 400 persons per square kilometer.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe used logistic regression to model the association between\nmortality at the individual level with demographic and socioeco-\nnomic predictors. The binary response (y, dead or not) for each\nindividual were related to a set of categorical predictors, X,\n(gender, age, residency location, religion, caste, income, assets,\nmonthly consumption per capita) and a fixed state effect by a logit\nlink function:\nlogit(pi\n)~log\u00bdpi\nzb(X)ze \u00f01\u00de\nThe probability of an individual being dead is pi\n. The\nparameter b0\nestimates the log odds of mortality for the reference\ngroup, and the parameter b estimates with maximum likelihood,\nthe differential log odds of mortality associated with the predictor\nX, as compared to the reference group. Odds ratios (OR) and\npredicted probabilities (PP) with 95% CI were calculated. All\nanalyses were performed using the statistical program SAS 9.2\n`surveylogit' procedure, adjusted for sample clustering at the level\nof primary sampling units.\nWe used multivariable regression models to explore the effects\nof social caste, household income, household assets, and monthly\nconsumption per capita on mortality separately, while adjusting\nfor gender, age and residency location. Secondly, we explored the\nassociations of the above factors together as they mutually adjusted\nfor each other. Furthermore, we explored these associations with\nregards to age-specific mortality by adding interaction terms\nbetween age and caste, income, assets and monthly consumption\nper capita. We also explored the effects of caste on mortality when\nmodified by income, assets and monthly consumption per capita.\nSocial castes were stratified into five groups to observe mortality\ndifferentials across asset quartiles in finer detail. Households were\nre-grouped into asset quartiles to ensure at least one death is\npresent within each asset quartile stratified by caste.\nEthical Review\nThe India Human Development Survey was conducted under\nthe scientific and administrative supervision of the National\nCouncil of Applied Economic Research, Delhi and the University\nof Maryland and was reviewed by the relevant ethics review board.\nFormal written consent was obtained for all the surveys. This study\nwas reviewed by Harvard School of Public Health Institutional\nReview Board and was considered exempt from full review as it\nwas based on an anonymous public use data set with no\nidentifiable information on survey participants.\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics\nThere were 217 363 individuals included in the analysis. There\nwere 1609 individuals, 0.7% of the total sample, who died in the one\nyear prior to household survey. The distributions of gender, religion,\nsocial castes, and quintiles of household income, household assets\nand monthly consumption per capita are listed in Table 1.\nSocioeconomic Differentials in Mortality\nThe conditional odds ratios (OR) and predicted probabilities\n(PP) of each subgroup is shown in Table 2 and Table S1. The\nreference group represents a Hindu male between the ages of 19\u00ad\n44, living in a metropolitan city. He belongs to the High Caste and\nhas household income, household assets and monthly consump-\ntion per capita of the highest quintile.\nAcross social castes, we found significantly higher odds of\nmortality in Other Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes. However, after adjusting for all wealth factors:\nincome, assets and consumption per capita, the associations was\nno longer statistically significant with the exception of Scheduled\nsocial caste on mortality with household income and asset\nownership independently also resulted in the attenuation of caste\neffect on mortality except in Scheduled Castes (Table S2). Within\nthe Muslims, Christians, Sikhs and Jains populations outside the\ntraditional social caste system, no significant patterning in risk of\nmortality was found.\nWe found a statistically significant association between house-\nhold income and mortality. Compared to the top quintile, the\nthird and fourth quintile displayed significant and progressively\nhigher odds of mortality. Individuals living with household income\nat the bottom quintile had 76% higher odds of mortality\nlower income quintiles were attenuated after mutually adjusting\nfor assets and expenditure, but remained statistically significant\nSimilar to associations with household income, individuals with\nhousehold assets within the middle quintile and lower quintiles had\nhigher odds of mortality. Individuals who had little or no\nownership of household assets at the bottom quintile had odds\nof mortality substantially higher than the top quintile (OR = 2.38,\nwhen adjusted for income and expenditure (OR = 2.94, 95%\nMortality and SES in India\nTable 1. Number and Percentage of Deaths during One Year Before the Survey, by Descriptive Characteristics of the Sample: India\nN (%) Deaths (%) (95% CI)\nGender\nAge\nCaste\nReligion\nUrban-Rural Status\nIncome\nHousehold Assets\nMonthly Consumption per Capita\nMortality and SES in India\nUnlike household income and assets ownership, a decrease in\nmonthly consumption per capita was associated with decreased\nodds of mortality. Individuals living in households with the lowest\nquintile of monthly consumption per capita were 73% less likely to\ndie than individuals from the top consumption quintile (OR = 0.27,\nInteraction of Socioeconomic Factors with Age\nThe mortality odds of infants younger than one year were\ndifferentially associated with social castes. Furthermore, infants, young\nchildren and adolescents up to 18 years old had mortality odds that\nwere differentially associated with quintiles of household assets.\nMortality at age 65 and above was significantly associated with being\nin Scheduled Castes, the bottom income quintile and the bottom assets\nquintile (Figure 1, Figure 2). No apparent interaction between age and\nmonthly consumption per capita was found (Table 3, Figure 3).\nInteraction of Social Castes with Wealth Measures\nThere were significant interactions found between Scheduled\nCastes and asset ownership, but not with household income or\nmonthly consumption per capita (Table S3). Upon stratification of\nsocial castes, we found significant mortality differentials across\nasset quintiles in High Caste and in Scheduled Castes (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nOur analysis has the following findings related to patterns of\nmortality differential among socioeconomic groups in India. First,\nthe mortality burden associated to lower castes was substantially\nattenuated after accounting for the individuals' household income\nand assets. Our analysis showed that infant mortality burden\nremained associated with social castes. This mirrored previous\nfindings which suggested that there were differential attenuation by\neconomic factors in mortality burdens across life stages [9]. In our\ncase, the importance of economic factors was lesser in infants than\nolder ages. Although lower castes such as Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes are disadvantaged in terms of social standing and\nmaterialistic wealth [13], recent studies supported views that\neconomic well-being, such as standard of living, is a more favorable\nindicator of mortality and morbidity burden than social caste as an\nintrinsic risk factor [8,9,14]. Results from sensitivity analysis\nprovided support that asset ownership, among the three wealth\nmeasures, was the most important underlying factor in the mortality\nTable 2.

Furthermore,\nindividuals belonging to the High Caste and the bottom asset\nquartile suffered from a higher mortality gap than Other Backward\nClasses. This suggested that magnitude of inequality across asset\nownership may be an additional risk factor (Table 4).\nIn our study, we utilized three measure of economic well-being\nto unravel the associations of wealth and mortality patterns. Low\nhousehold income and asset ownership continued to be strongly\nassociated with increased risk of overall mortality, but asset\nownership alone were strongly associated with age-specific\nmortality. Total household income reflected short term, self-\nreported wealth of a household. The benefit of higher income may\nnot trickle down to all members of the household at different ages.\nThe data did not reflect significant income effect on mortality risk\nacross age groups (Table 3).\nHousehold asset ownership is a relatively accurate long-term\nreflection of a household's economic well-being than income. Asset\nownership measure has lower recall bias; consumer goods and\nhousing quality can easily be verified by survey administrators.\nComparing the two different household wealth indicators, we\nFigure 1. Predicted probabilities (PP) of death by age groups comparing income quintiles.\nFigure 2. Predicted probabilities (PP) of death by age groups comparing asset quintiles.\nMortality and SES in India\nobserved differential mortality gaps across age groups, mainly\nconcentrated in infants and elderly (Figure 1, Figure 2). Further-\nmore, the mortality gradient of the population over 64 years old\nwas much greater when deprived of asset ownership than of high\nhousehold income. This suggested that wealth in terms of\nmonetary resources translated less readily to standard of living in\nelderly than ownership of household goods and housing quality.\nAmong different household goods and housing qualities, there\nexists a differential mortality risk reduction for different age groups\nas well. For instance, an electric fan may reduce risk of malarial\ninfection in infants and young children who stay at home, but not\nfor older children and adults. We observed significant interactions\nbetween asset quintiles and age groups 0\u00ad18 years but not with\nolder adults, suggesting ownership of particular assets could affect\nage groups selectively (Table 3).\nConsumption captures monthly household expenditures such as\nstaple food cost and seasonal or sporadic expenditures such as\ncontributions to annual festivals, weddings and major medical\nexpenses. Surprisingly, our findings showed significantly lower odds\nof mortality in individuals from lower quintiles of monthly\nconsumption per capita. Higher quintiles of monthly consumption\nper capita captured poor households that might need to exert greater\nmarginal effort and percentage of household wealth than rich\nhouseholds to obtain similar daily resources [15]. For example, a\nwoman in an urban center could switch on a tap for potable water in\nthe matter of seconds and a woman living in a rural village may\nrequire several hours each morning and afternoon to line up, pump\nand carry water for daily use, in turn reducing her available income-\ngenerating time. Correlations of consumption with income quintiles\n(r= 0.32) and asset quintiles (r= 0.48) were low, which suggested the\nsubpopulations with low wealth measured by household total income\nand ownership of assets may not be the similar subpopulations that\nwere consuming the least per capita monthly. On the other hand,\nhigh monthly consumption per capita was strongly associated with\nTable 3.

This was likely due\nto the increased medical expenses at older ages.\nThe findings of our study need to be considered along with\ndifferential across socioeconomic factors in India was based on\ncross-sectional survey data. Although it captured only a snap shot\nof India's mortality patterns, it reinforced previous findings from\ndeterminant of mortality risk than social caste [8,16]. However,\nboth findings related to mortality were influenced by recall bias of\ndeaths within the household[17]. Age of the deceased and\nsocioeconomically levels influence under-reporting of deaths\ndifferentially. The Sample Registration System (SRS), which is a\nlarge-scale demographic survey conducted in India, reports birth\nrate, death rate and other fertility and mortality indicators at the\nnational and sub-national levels. The crude death rate from IHDS\nfrom the 2003 SRS (http://censusindia.gov.in/vital_statistics/\nVital_Rates/Vital_rates.aspx; accessed on December 1, 2010).\nHowever, infant deaths from IHDS estimate was considerably\nlower than the SRS estimate. Furthermore, our measures do not\ncapture all dimensions of socioeconomic status. Although multiple\nstudies have illustrated strong link between education levels of the\nhead of household and mother with childhood mortality\ncollected from IHDS, thus related aspects such as maternal\neducation level and literacy rate were not included in our analysis.\nGiven the above, conclusions drawn from the mortality analyses\npresented should qualitatively reflect the underlying patterns of\nmortality differences across social castes and household economic\nwell-being[5].\nConclusions\nOur study suggests a gradual decrease in importance of social\ncaste as an intrinsic mortality risk. Social caste influences\nindividuals' opportunities to income-generating work and asset\nownership. However when adjusted for these economic household\nmeasures, the importance of social caste attenuates while the\neconomic measures remain strong indicators of the mortality gap.\nOverall, mortality differential in India remains salient. Social caste\nexerts strongest influence in mortality during the first year of life\nwhile economically disadvantaged households bear heavier\nburdens across several age groups.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 Predicted Probabilities of Mortality by Socioeconomic\nFactors, Adjusted for Gender, Age, Urban-Rural Status, Religion,\nTable 4.
