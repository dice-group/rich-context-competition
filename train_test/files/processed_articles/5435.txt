Hyperglycaemia associated with diabetes\nenhances ROS production and causes oxidative stress in\nvascular endothelial cells, but adverse effects of either\nacute or chronic high-glucose environments on brain\nparenchymal cells remain unclear. The PPP (pentose\nphosphate pathway) and GSH participate in a major\ndefence mechanism against ROS in brain, and we explored\nthe role and regulation of the astroglial PPP in response to\nacute and chronic high-glucose environments. PPP activity\nwas measured in cultured neurons and astroglia by deter-\nmining the difference in rate of 14CO2\nproduction from\n, and GSH were also assessed. Acutely elevated glucose\nconcentrations in the culture media increased PPP activity\nand GSH level in astroglia, decreasing ROS production.\nChronically elevated glucose environments also induced\nPPP activation. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed\nthat chronic high-glucose environments induced ER\n(endoplasmic reticulum) stress (presumably through\nincreased hexosamine biosynthetic pathway flux). Nuclear\ntranslocation of Nrf2 (nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45\nsubunit-related factor 2), which regulates G6PDH (glycer-\naldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) by enhancing\ntranscription, was also observed in association with BiP\n(immunoglobulin heavy-chain-binding protein) expression.\nAcute and chronic high-glucose environments activated\nthe PPP in astroglia, preventing ROS elevation. Therefore a\nrapid decrease in glucose level seems to enhance ROS\ntoxicity, perhaps contributing to neural damage when\ninsulin levels given to diabetic patients are not properly\ncalibrated and plasma glucose levels are not adequately\nmaintained. These findings may also explain the lack of\nevidence for clinical benefits from strict glycaemic control\nduring the acute phase of stroke.\n",

Even though the theoretical ratio of the CMRoxy\n(cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen) and the CMRglc\n(cerebral\nmetabolic rate of glucose) for the complete oxidation of\nglucose is 6, the values measured in the human brain during a\nnon-activated, steady state are always lower than 6 (5.0\u00ad5.5),\nindicating that more glucose is consumed than oxidized.

At least one-half or more of the total glucose\nutilization in the brain has been ascribed to astroglia (Itoh\na long-lasting debate exists regarding the ANLSH (astrocyte-\nneuron lactate shuttle hypothesis) (Pellerin and Magistretti,\nthe sites of glucose consumption and lactate production\nin the activated brain are located in astrocytes, irrespective of\nthe controversy regarding the site of the production and neu-\nronal utilization of lactate (Bak et al., 2009; Contreras and\nHowever, the benefit, if it exists, of such compartmentation\nof glucose metabolism in neurons and astroglia remains un-\ncertain. These facts and controversy suggest that the excess\nutilization of glucose compared with oxygen in the brain as a\nwhole may be clinically relevant to the disease pathology, and\nthat if the glycolytic metabolism of glucose predominates in\nastrocytes, these cells may play important roles through their\nglucose metabolism in the pathophysiology of metabolic\ndisorders of the brain, such as diabetic encephalopathy. Al-\nthough a possible role of glycolysis as a survival pathway\nrather than an energy production pathway has been\npostulated (Bolan\n~os et al., 2010), glycolysis in astroglia has\nnot been extensively studied as in cultured neurons (Bolan\n~os\nAs for neuronal energy production dependent on mito-\nchondrial oxidative metabolism of glucose, ROS (reactive\noxygen species) derived from the mitochondria in neural cells\nmay play a harmful role in stroke (Mehta et al., 2007) and\naging of the brain (Kregel and Zhang, 2007), as well as\nneurodegenerative disorders (Jomova et al., 2010).\nHyperglycaemia is well known to enhance ROS production\nin vascular endothelial cells, resulting in vascular diseases\nlitus is a risk factor for dementia of either the vascular or\nwhether the hyperglycaemic state causes direct neuronal cell\ndamage remains controversial (Sommerfield et al., 2004; Cox\nSima, 2010). Even though a hyperglycaemic state is harmful\nto parenchymal cells (i.e. neurons and astroglia), the\ndeleterious effects of a hyperglycaemic state do not seem\nto be as devastating as they are to vascular endothelial cells.\nIn a clinical setting, an elevation in the blood glucose con-\ncentration is often observed during the acute phase of stroke\nin patients, regardless of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and is\nassociated with a poor prognosis (Capes et al., 2001). Despite\nthe potential harmful effects of hyperglycaemia on brain\nparenchymal cells in animal studies (Macdougall and Muir,\n2011), the beneficial effects of lowering the blood glucose\nlevel during the acute phase of stroke have not been\nconfirmed by clinical trials (Quinn and Lees, 2009; Kruyt et al.,\nnow generally accepted to exacerbate ischaemic damage, a\nrecent survey of clinical studies suggests that mild hypergly-\ncaemia is actually beneficial in cases with lacunar infarction\n(Uyttenboogaart et al., 2007). These facts may indicate that\nan appropriate glucose content in the brain is necessary to\nprotect brain cells against ischaemic cell damage.\nThe PPP branches from the glycolytic pathway of glucose\nat glucose 6-phosphate, and the activity of the rate-limiting\nenzyme of the PPP, G6PDH (glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate\ndehydrogenase), is regulated by NADPH, peroxynitrite and\nother factors, as well as by transcriptional mechanisms\ngenerally considered to be a minor pathway of glucose\nmetabolism in resting brain, but it can be markedly up-\nregulated under various conditions (e.g. Appel and Parrot,\n1970) to generate NADPH, which in turn increases GSH to\ndetoxify ROS in concert with glutathione peroxidase (Dringen\net al., 2007). `Resting' PPP rate and the magnitude of PPP\nincrease during activation are known to be higher in\nastrocytes than in neurons, although they are not negligible\n(2010) reported increased oxidative stress in cultured\nastrocytes grown in high glucose and in the brain of diabetic\nrats, and we therefore hypothesized that acute and chronic\nhyperglycaemic states activate the PPP in astroglia to protect\nthe brain. In the present study, we explored the mechanisms\nthat are activated to regulate PPP under acute and chronic\nhyperglycaemic conditions, focusing on ER (endoplasmic\nreticulum) stress and the Keap1 (Kelch-like enoyl-CoA\nhydratase-associated protein 1)/Nrf2 (nuclear factor-eryth-\nroid 2 p45 subunit-related factor 2) system, which is a master\nregulator of phase-2 detoxifying enzymes such as G6PDH\nAnimals\nTimed-pregnant Sprague\u00adDawley rats were purchased from\nJapan SLC, Inc.

The\nculture medium was changed every 2 days until the cultures\nreached confluence.

For immunohistochemical staining, the cells were\nplated (2 ml/dish) on 35 mm glass-bottomed dishes\n(Matsunami Glass Industry) precoated with PLL (poly-L-\nlysine).

The cells were cultured in a glucose medium (final\nconcentration, 12 mmol/l D-glucose) at 37\u00b0C in humidified air\n. In vitro assays were performed using\ncultures that were 7 or 8 days old. The nutrient medium\nremained untouched until the experiments were initiated.\nWhen neurons were grown on astroglial culture, the astroglial\ncultures were prepared as described above; on culture day 21,\nthe neuronal cells were seeded on the astroglial cell layer and\nAra-C was added 72 h later. The cells were used for the assay\n7 days after the neurons had been seeded.\nExperimental protocol\nTo assess the effects of acutely changing concentrations of\nD-glucose (2, 10, 20 mmol/l) on glucose metabolism, ROS\nproduction and immunohistochemistry, the nutrient medium\n(12 mmol/l) was removed and the cells were washed twice\nwith PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ containing no glucose and\nthe cells were incubated with DBSS (Dulbecco's balanced salt\nsolution) containing 110 mmol/l NaCl, 5.4 mmol/l KCl,\nD-glucose supplemented with 18, 10 or 0 mmol/l L-glucose\nrespectively.

To keep the specific activity of [14C]deoxy-\nglucose constant as the concentration of D-glucose was\n(original concentration: 3.7 MBq/ml) was added to each assay\nsolution and incubation was continued for 60 min at 37\u00b0C\n. At the end of the incubation period, the DBSS\nwas replaced with a fresh reaction mixture lacking\n[14C]deoxyglucose and incubation was continued at 37\u00b0C\nfor 5 min to allow the efflux of residual\nAbe et al., 2006a). This procedure allows the evaluation of\nglucose phosphorylation activity instead of simple glucose\nuptake activity. The cell carpets were washed quickly three\ntimes with ice-cold PBS and digested in 1.0 ml of 0.1 mM\nNaOH at room temperature. The cell digests were then\nassayed for protein content using the BCA (bicinchoninic\nmeasured using a liquid scintillation counter (Tri-Carb\n3100TR; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The rates of glucose\nphosphorylation (pmol of glucose/mg of protein per 60 min)\nbased on the conversion from [14C]deoxyglucose phosphor-\nylation over 60 min were then calculated from the specific\nactivity of [14C]deoxyglucose (i.e. mBq of [14C]deoxyglucose/\nmmol of glucose) in the reaction mixture.\nMeasurement of the rate of D-[1-14C]glucose\nwas measured\nusing a modification of a previously described method (Abe\nbeen washed twice with PBS containing no glucose, the assay\nsolutions were added and the flasks were capped with rubber\nstoppers containing a centre well and incubated at 37\u00b0C\nproduced was trapped by a cotton\nball placed in the centre well containing 100 ml of hyamine\nhydroxide 10-X. The reactions were terminated by the\nthrough the rubber\nstopper, and the flasks were kept at 4\u00b0C overnight to trap the\n. The centre wells were then transferred to 20 ml glass\nscintillation counter vials, and 500 ml of ethanol and 10 ml of\nInsta-Fluor Plus were added. The 14C contents of the vials\nwere evaluated using a liquid scintillation counter. The assay\nsolutions consisted of 2.5 ml of DBSS containing 2, 10 or\nL-glucose respectively; these solutions were labelled by\n[6-14C]glucose (original concentrations: 3.7 MBq/ml) to keep\nthe specific activities constant.\ncounts were obtained from a flask without cells. There-\nfore the 14C counts obtained from a flask without cells in\nwhich the reaction had been stopped at 60 min were\nregarded as the background values and were subtracted in\nour studies. The cell carpets remaining in the incubation\nflasks after the removal of the reaction mixtures were then\ndigested with 5 ml of 0.1 M NaOH, and their protein contents\nwere determined. The rates of total glucose oxidation (pmol\nof glucose/mg of protein per 60 min) based on the conversion\nover 60 min were measured.\nMeasurement of PPP activity in cultured\nastroglia and neurons\nPPP activity was measured using a modification of the\nmethod described by Hothersall et al. (1979). Briefly, cells\nwere incubated with glucose with tracer doses of\ncalculated as the difference between the 14CO2\nderived from\n[1-14C]glucose (metabolized by both PPP and the tricar-\nboxylic acid cycle) and that derived from [6-14C]glucose\n(metabolized by only the tricarboxylic acid cycle) was thought\nto be an indicator of the PPP activity. To confirm the validity\nof this tracer assay, 15 h prior to and during the PPP assay,\n6-AN (6-aminonicotinamide; 500 mmol/l), a competitive\ninhibitor of G6PDH, was added to the nutrient medium and\nassay solution, and the PPP activity was measured. PPP is\nknown to be active in proliferating cells because PPP yields\nribose 5-phosphate for nucleotide biosynthesis, leading to\nDNA and RNA synthesis. To evaluate the effects of the\nproliferation of astroglia on PPP activity, Ara-C (10 mmol/l)\nwas added to the astroglial culture medium 48 h prior to\nthe assay to arrest cell division and the PPP activity was\nevaluated.\nMeasurement of ROS production\nThe production of ROS, mainly H2\n, in cells was assessed\nDCFDA (Gomes et al., 2005) and semi-quantitative\nfluorimetric measurements. Just prior to the assay, the\nnutrient medium was removed and the cells were washed\ntwice with PBS without glucose. Then, DBSS containing 10\u00ad\nDCFDA dissolved in DMSO (final volume of\nDMSO: 0.1%) supplemented with 2 mmol/l glucose were\nadded and the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in humidified air\nfor 30 min.

The\ncells were further incubated for 60 min, and the fluorescence\nlevel indicating intracellular ROS production was measured at\n0 and 60 min using a fluorescence microplate reader (Infinite\nApplied Biosystems Japan) with lex\nat\n530 nm. As the fluorescence signals increased linearly for up\nto 60 min (data not shown), the results were expressed as the\npercentage increase in the fluorescence signal at 60 min\ncompared with that at 0 min.\nMeasurement of GSH content using a\nfluorimetric method\nThe intracellular content of GSH in astroglia was assessed using\nMCB which forms an adduct with GSH via an enzymatic\nreaction catalysed by glutathione transferases (Chatterjee et\n30 min. The intracellular formation of the GSH\u00adMCB adduct\nwas assessed using a microplate reader with lex\nlem\nat 460 nm. The results were expressed as the percentage\nincrease in the fluorescence signal over 60 min.\nImmunohistochemistry\nBiP (immunoglobulin heavy-chain-binding protein) express-\nion, an ER stress indicator, or the translocation of Nrf2 from\nthe cytosol to the nucleus was assessed using immuno-\nhistochemistry. For detection of AGEs (advanced glycation\nend-products), immunostaining of Ne-(carboxyethyl)lysine\nwas performed. Astroglial cells that were grown on a glass-\nbottomed, 35 mm dish were fixed with 4% (w/v) PFA\n(paraformaldehyde) for 10 min on ice. Then the cells were\ntemperature, followed by post-fixation with 4% PFA for\n5 min on ice. For immunostaining, the cells were washed\ntwice with PBS containing MgCl2\n, and non-specific\nIgG binding sites were blocked by incubating the cells in PBS\ncontaining 3% BSA and 3% normal goat serum for 30 min at\nroom temperature. Cells were incubated with the primary\nantibodies (mouse anti-KDEL monoclonal antibody, 1:200;\nanti-Nrf2 polyclonal antibody, 1:100 or mouse anti-Ne-\n(carboxyethyl)lysine antibody, 1:100 for 2 h at room temper-\nature). Then, the cells were incubated with the secondary\nantibodies (rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG anti-\nbody or FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody) with\nDAPI (49,6-diamino-2-phenylindole) for nuclear staining for\n1 h. The cells were examined using a laser confocal microscopy\nsystem (Leica TCS SP5; Leica Microsystems).\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical comparisons among the values obtained for each\ngroup were performed using grouped t tests or a one-way\nANOVA followed by the Dunnett test for multiple compar-\nisons. A P,0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nRESULTS\nEffects of acute and chronic exposure to\nelevated extracellular glucose concentrations on\nglucose phosphorylation in cultured astroglia\nNormal brain glucose concentration is approximately 20\u00ad25%\nthat in arterial plasma and it generally falls within the range of\n2\u00ad3 and 5\u00ad7 mmol/g in normal and diabetic rat brain respe-\nctively (Gandhi et al., 2010). When astrocytes were grown in\nculture medium containing 5, 12 or 23 mmol/l glucose, then\nassayed for rates of glucose utilization with tracer amounts\nof [14C]deoxyglucose in the reaction mixture containing\n2 mmol/l glucose, there were no differences among the\ncultures in the rates of glucose phosphorylation (Figure 1A).\nIn contrast, when astrocytes were grown in 12 mmol/l\nglucose and assayed for glucose utilization rate in 2, 10 or\n20 mmol/l glucose, the rate of glucose phosphorylation fell\nby approximately 20% when the glucose level in the assay\nmixture was much lower than that of the culture medium\nand it increased by approximately 15% when glucose level in\nthe assay medium was elevated; glucose phosphorylation rate\nvaried linearly with respect to D-glucose concentration in the\nassay mixture (Figure 1B).\nHigher rates of glucose utilization when assay glucose\nlevels exceeded 2 mmol/l were unexpected findings because\nthe Km\nof brain hexokinase for glucose is approximately\nthe enzyme is saturated (.1 mmol/l glucose) the reaction\nrate would not change. Differences in the rate of\n[14C]deoxyglucose phosphorylation can, however, arise from\nchanges in the value of the lumped constant of the\ndeoxyglucose method, the factor that accounts for differ-\nences in transport and phosphorylation of deoxyglucose and\nglucose (Sokoloff et al., 1977). The value of the lumped\nconstant increases sharply in the hypoglycaemic range, but it\nis relatively stable during hyperglycaemia (Orzi et al., 1988;\nValues for the lumped constant are not available for higher\nbrain glucose levels and have not been determined in\ndifferent brain cell types, so changes in its value were not\nwere not taken into account in the present study. However,\ncorrection of measured [14C]deoxyglucose phosphorylation\nrates for changes in the value of the lumped constant would\nbe expected to modestly increase the calculated glucose\nphosphorylation rates (Figure 1B) determined in 10 and\n20 mmol/l D-glucose compared with that in 2 mmol/l D-\nglucose and to slightly increase the slope of the regression\nline. Also, these effects are not due to osmotic changes in the\nculture medium, because the total D-/L-glucose concentra-\ntions were kept constant by adding L-glucose, a biologically\ninactive form of glucose, when the D-glucose concentration\nwas reduced.\nAstroglial PPP under hyperglycaemia\nE 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nNote that the rates of glucose phosphorylation in Figure 1\nwere calculated using the specific activities of [14C]deoxy-\nglucose in the assay mixtures and do not include the lumped\nconstant in the denominator. Actual glucose utilization rates\nare therefore higher than the calculated rates because the\nlumped constant accounts for the slightly higher transport\nrate (approximately 1.4-fold) and the 3-fold lower rate of\nphosphorylation rate for deoxyglucose compared with\nglucose; for in vivo experiments, the lumped constant is\nmolecules are phosphorylated for each deoxyglucose mole-\ncule phosphorylated. The rates in Figure 1 are therefore not\ndirectly comparable with rates of 14CO2\nproduction from [1-\nand 6-14C]glucose oxidation (see below). To summarize,\nchanges in glucose utilization rate with acute change in\nglucose level from the culture medium to the assay mixture\narise mainly from unidentified effects that are unrelated to\nthe maximal rate of hexokinase or the lumped constant and\nprobably involve regulation of glucose metabolism at\ndownstream sites.\nPPP rate in cultured astroglia exceeds that in\ncultured neurons and is influenced by glucose\nlevel in the PPP assay mixture and culture\nmedium\nPPP rates were determined separately in cultured astroglia\nand neurons as the difference (Figure 2C) between the rates\nproduction from oxidation of [1-14C]glucose\n(Figure 2A) and [6-14C]glucose (Figure 2B). Glucose oxidation\nvia the tricarboxylic acid cycle (i.e. 14CO2\nproduction from\n[6-14C]glucose) was higher in neurons compared with\nastrocytes (Figures 2A and 2B), but the PPP activity in\nastroglia was approximately 4\u00ad5 times higher than in neurons\n(Figure 2C), consistent with previous reports (e.g. Ben-Yoseph\nDecarboxylation of [1-14C]glucose by astroglia was almost\ncompletely eliminated by pre-treatment with 6-AN, and PPP\nactivity was reduced to approximately 3% of control by 6-AN\n(Table 1). As the PPP activity of the astroglia was unaffected\nby Ara-C-induced mitotic arrest (Table 1), the higher PPP\nactivity measured in the cultured astroglia, compared with\nthat in neurons (Figure 2), cannot be ascribed to proliferative\nactivity.\nWhen astrocytes were grown in 12 mmol/l glucose and PPP\nactivity assayed at different glucose concentrations, the rate\nof decarboxylation of [1-14C]glucose was lower or higher\nwhen the glucose level in the assay medium was less than or\nexceeded that in the culture medium respectively (Figure 3A).\nOn the other hand, the decarboxylation rate of [6-14C]glucose\nwas quite low and not altered by differences in glucose level\nthe assay compared with growth media (Figure 3B). Both\n[1-14C]glucose decarboxylation and PPP rates were linearly\nrelated to glucose level in the assay medium (Figures 3A\u00ad3C).\nTo summarize, acute changes in glucose concentration in the\nassay medium compared with the culture medium cause\nparallel changes in glucose utilization rate (Figure 1B) and\nFigure 1 Effects of D-glucose concentration on rate of [14C]deoxyglucose phosphorylation in astroglia grown (A) or assayed (B) in\ndifferent concentrations of D-glucose\nGlucose utilization rates were assayed with [14C]deoxyglucose in astrocytes chronically exposed to different glucose levels for 10\ndays, then assayed in 2 mmol/l D-glucose (A) or cultured in 12 mmol/l D-glucose for 10 days, then assayed at the indicated D-glucose\nconcentration (B).

This finding has important implications\nfor interpretation of results of metabolic assays in cultured\ncells because cells are often grown in higher glucose levels\nthan those used for in vitro assays using radiolabelled\nsubstrates (i.e. to maximize the specific activity and\nsensitivity of the assay), and large changes in glucose level\nin the assay system can cause artifactual changes in glucose\nutilization and pathway fluxes.\ncytes (Gandhi et al., 2010 and references cited therein) and\nother cell types grown in media containing high glucose for\nvarious periods of time ranging from 2\u00ad3 days to 3\u00ad4 weeks\nare used as models for experimental diabetes mellitus. PPP\nactivity was, therefore compared in astroglia grown in media\ncontaining 5 or 23 mmol/l glucose, and then assayed in\nreaction mixtures containing 2 or 20 mmol/l glucose. When\nastroglia were cultured in a high-glucose environment\n(23 mmol/l glucose) for 10 days, PPP rates were statistically\nsignificantly enhanced compared with cells grown in 5 mmol/\nl glucose when measured in assay medium containing either\n2 or 20 mmol/l glucose (Figure 4). The predominant ef-\nfect increased rate of decarboxylation of [1-14C]glucose,\nwith small, if any, changes in rates of decarboxylation of\n[6-14C]glucose with chronic or acute differences in glucose\nlevel (Figure 4). PPP rates were much higher when assayed\nin 20 mmol/l compared with 2 mmol/l glucose, regardless of\nthe growth medium glucose level, and growth in high\nglucose and assay in high glucose evoked the highest PPP\nactivity (Figure 4). Acute changes in glucose concentration\nhad a greater effect of PPP activity than prolonged ex-\nposure to high glucose (Figure 4). These findings dem-\nonstrate that acute upward or downward shifts in glucose\nconcentration cause PPP activity to fall or rise (Figures 3\nand 4) in parallel with changes glucose phosphorylation\nrate (Figure 1).\nInfluence of acute or chronic exposure of\nastrocytes and neurons to different glucose\nlevels on ROS generation and on level of GSH in\nastrocytes\nProlonged exposure of cultured astrocytes to 25 mmol/l\nglucose increases ROS production (Gandhi et al., 2010), and\nthe present study evaluated ROS production in astrocytes\nand neurons during acute changes in glucose concentration.\nAstroglia and neurons were grown in 12 mmol/l glucose for\n10 or 7\u00ad8 days respectively and then assayed for ROS\nproduction in different glucose concentrations. In astroglia,\nROS production decreased by approximately 85% when\nacutely exposed to 20 mmol/l glucose compared with\n2 mmol/l glucose (Figure 5A). In contrast, ROS production\nwas higher in neurons than in astroglia and it increased as the\n2, 10 and 20 mmol/l glucose respectively) (Figure 5B). Thus,\nneurons are more sensitive to acute variations in glucose level\nthan astroglia, consistent with greater neuronal sensitivity to\nother treatments that evoke oxidative stress (e.g. Ben-Yoseph\nmixed cultures of neurons and astroglia (Figure 6A) nor\nneurons grown on an astroglial cell layer (Figure 6B) showed\nstatistically significant alterations in ROS production with\nincreased glucose level, despite the fact that neurons alone\nresponded to acutely increasing concentrations of D-glucose\nby elevated ROS production.

These findings\nare unexpected, because astroglia that had been cultured in\nhigh-glucose environment (23 mmol/l) shows higher PPP\nrates at 2 and 20 mmol/l (Figure 4).

Therefore we also performed\nimmunohistochemical analysis of Ne-(carboxyethyl)lysine, one of\nmajor AGE, in astroglia (see Figure 11 and the Discussion section).\nAcutely altering glucose concentrations also modulated the\nGSH content in astroglia. There was a tendency for GSH to be\nlower when assayed in 2 mmol/l glucose compared with\n10 mmol/l and GSH was significantly higher when assayed in\n20 mmol/l glucose compared with 2 mmol/l (Table 3). L-\nbuthionine sulfoximine reduces the synthesis of glutathione\nby inhibiting c-glutamylcysteine synthase, and incubation\nof astroglia with this drug for 48 h markedly reduced GSH\ncontent, but the glucose concentration dependence of\nGSH level was still evident (Table 3). These findings suggest\nthat the higher PPP activity regenerates GSH and can\nmaintain higher GSH levels even when oxidative stress is\nhigher. Taken together, all of the above findings indicate that\nchronically elevated glucose levels enhance PPP activity, and\nacute increases in glucose level stimulate both glucose\nutilization and PPP activity to minimize ROS production and\nsustain levels of GSH in astroglia that serve a protective role\nfor neurons exposed to acute glucose-evoked oxidative stress.\nChronic high-glucose environments induce ER\nstress, trigger nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and\nup-regulate PPP activity\nPPP activity in astroglia is known to be regulated by the Nrf2-\nmediated transcription of G6PDH (Thimmulappa et al., 2002),\nso the underlying mechanisms that regulate PPP activity in\nthe presence of chronic high-glucose environments were\nexplored. First, the effect of sulforaphane, an Nrf2 activator,\non PPP activity in astroglia was examined to confirm that the\nNrf2-mediated regulatory system of the PPP was active in our\ncultured astroglia.

Nrf2 is reportedly a direct substrate of PERK\n(double-stranded-RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER\nkinase), an ER stress transducer protein kinase, and the pho-\nsphorylation of Nrf2 facilitates its dissociation from the\nadaptor protein Keap1 and its translocation to the nucleus\nmmol/l), a well-established inducer of ER stress (Rasheva and\nDomingos, 2009), elicited PPP activation in astroglia after\n15 h (Figure 7B). Sulforaphane increased decarboxylation of\n[1-14C]glucose without altering glucose oxidation in the\ntricarboxylic acid cycle (Figure 7A), whereas thapsigargin\nincreased decarboxylation of [1-14C]glucose and reduced that\nof [6-14C]glucose (Figure 7B). Importantly, these two pathways\nwere not activated in neuronal cells. Sulforaphane (Figure 7C)\nand thapsigargin (Figure 7D) reduced rates of oxidation of\nactivities in neurons without affecting the morphology of the\nneurons after 15 h of exposure to these drugs (data not shown),\nindicating that the lack of PPP activation was not due to gross\nneuronal cell damage.\nIt is well known that high-glucose environments can induce\nN-acetylglucosamine synthesis through an increased flux into\nthe hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which leads to\nabnormal glycosylation of proteins and triggers ER stress\nthe glycolytic intermediate fructose 6-phosphate into gluco-\nsamine 6-phosphate, followed by its acetylation to generate N-\nacetylglucosamine 6-phosphate that subsequently enters the\nglycosylation pathways. We hypothesized that the hexosamine\npathway plays an important role in the regulation of the PPP in\nastroglia and measured the PPP activities after incubation for\n15 h with D-glucosamine (1\u00ad10 mmol/l), a precursor of the\nhexosamine pathway. D-glucosamine did, indeed, induce PPP\nactivation in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 8).\nFirst, we examined the effects of sulforaphane, thapsigar-\ngin and D-glucosamine on expression of BiP, an ER stress\nmarker, and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 were assessed in\ncultured astroglia. Fifteen hours of exposure to low-glucose\n(5 mmol/l) medium plus sulforaphane caused the transloca-\ntion of Nrf2 from the cytosol to the nucleus without inducing\nBiP expression (compare Figure 9B with control Figure 9A).\nBoth thapsigargin (Figure 9C) and D-glucosamine (Figure 9D)\ninduced BiP expression and the nuclear translocation of Nrf2.\nNext, the influence of low- and high-glucose environments\non expression of BiP and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 were\nassessed in cultured astroglia. Elevation of D-glucose\nNrf2 translocation to the nucleus and increased BiP\nindicating that high glucose stimulates the pathway that\nenhances G6PDH mRNA transcription and causes ER stress,\npresumably via the hexosamine pathway. Because treatment\nwith sulforaphane and thapsigargin (Figures 7A and 7B) and\nD-glucosamine (Figure 8) increased the PPP activity in\nastroglia, ROS production rates were also assessed after\n15 h of incubation with sulforaphane, thapsigargin and\nD-glucosamine (Table 4). All treatments reduced ROS pro-\nduction compared with control conditions and enhanced the\nPPP activity (Table 4). Together, these findings indicate that\nROS production in astroglia is regulated by Keap1/Nrf2-\ndependent PPP activation. We also observed that long-term\nculture (6 weeks) in high-glucose medium (23 mmol/l)\nenhanced immunostaining of AGEs as compared with short-\nterm culture (3 weeks) in high-glucose medium (23 mmol/l)\nor in low-glucose medium (5 mmol/l) for both 3 and 6 weeks\nFigure 8 Effects of D-glucosamine on rate of 14CO2\nproduction from oxidation of [1-14C]glucose (white bars) and [6-14C] glucose\n(black bars), and PPP rate (hatched bars) in astroglia\nValues are means\u00a1S.D. of quadruplicate flasks; n.s., not significant; *P,0.05; **P,0.01 versus control treated with vehicle (ANOVA\nfollowed by Dunnett test for multiple comparisons).

In contrast, ROS production rises in\ncultured neurons under high-glucose conditions, and the PPP\nin neurons does not respond to conditions that up-regulate\nPPP in astrocytes. However, neurons are protected against\noxidative stress evoked by acute increases in glucose level by\nco-culture with astrocytes. These actions of astroglia indicate a\npotential protective role against oxidative stress in the brain\nunder the hyperglycaemic conditions associated with diabetes\nmellitus. As shown in Figures 6(A) and 6(B), these roles of\nastroglia seem to be independent of cultivation period (1 week\nversus 4 weeks), developmental stage in vivo (embryonic day\nTable 4 Modulation of ROS formation\nROS production was assayed after treatment with vehicle, sulforaphane, thapsigargin, or D-glucosamine for 15 h.

Notably, if astroglia are acutely shifted\nto a lower glucose concentration compared with that in the\nassay medium, the PPP rate is down-regulated and ROS levels\nincrease, suggesting increased vulnerability of brain cells to\noxidative stress during transient episodes of reduced glucose\nlevel that are normally adequate to support brain function\n(i.e. 2 mmol/l) or transitory hypoglycaemia that is commonly\nexperienced by diabetic patients.\nIn addition to their clinically relevant implications, the\nresults of this study reveal important issues related to in vitro\nmetabolic assays. The sensitivity of changes in astroglial\nglucose metabolism, pathway fluxes and ROS generation in\nresponse to extracellular glucose concentrations needs to be\ntaken into account when designing experimental procedures\nfor in vitro metabolic assays and assays that may be sensitive\nto oxidative stress in cultured cells. Also, the consequences of\n(i) cyclic changes of glucose concentrations as a result of perio-\ndic change of culture media (i.e. feeding astroglial cells), (ii)\nculture of astrocytes and neurons in media containing\nextremely high glucose concentrations (.15\u00ad20 mmol/l) that\ngreatly exceed glucose levels in diabetic rat brain (5\u00ad7 mmol/g;\nGandhi et al., 2010) and (iii) the progressive depletion of\nglucose from culture medium that is not changed in order to\nminimize neuronal damage or death that can arise from\nmedium change need to be taken into account when inter-\npreting results.\nAcutely increasing concentrations of D-glucose increased\nthe glycolytic flux into the PPP, enhancing decarboxylation at\ncarbon 1 of D-glucose, as evidenced by the increase in\nproduction. A slight but defi-\nproduction\nindicated that astroglial mitochondrial oxidative phos-\nphorylation in the tricarboxylic acid cycle was suppressed\n(Figure 3B), whereas glucose utilization increased, as assessed\nby the rates of [14C]deoxyglucose phosphorylation\n(Figure 1B). The overall rate of brain glucose utilization is\nregulated in an integrated, complex manner by various\nregulatory metabolites at many steps, including at the initial\nstep in glycolytic pathway, the phosphorylation of glucose\nto glucose 6-phosphate by hexokinase, as well as at many\ndownstream sites, especially, phosphofructokinase (the major\nregulatory enzyme), pyruvate kinase, PDH (pyruvate dehy-\ndrogenase) and tricarboxylic acid cycle dehydrogenases. PPP\nfluxes are governed by NADP availability due to consumption\nof NADPH to regenerate GSH from GSSG as the cell manages\noxidative stress (Dringen et al., 2007). Nitric oxide and\nperoxynitrite also strongly activate the PPP (Garci\n\u00b4a-Nogales\net al., 2003), as do various neurotransmitters that are\nmetabolized by monoamine oxidase and generate H2\n1996b and cited references). Brain hexokinase has a low Km\nvalue (approximately 0.05 mmol/l), compared with the\nglucokinase with a high Km\nthat is typically found in the\nliver and is not inhibited by glucose-6-phosphate, as is\nhexokinase (Grossbard and Schimke, 1966). As a result,\nhexokinase is saturated at glucose concentrations above\n1 mmol/l, consistent with the fact that CMRglc\ndoes not\nincrease in response to acute hyperglycaemia in vivo (Orzi\nexistence of glucokinase activity in the brain (Roncero et al.,\ncultured astrocytes is not ruled out.\nOur previous report, showing that chronic high-glucose\nenvironments reduced astroglial oxidative metabolism of\nglucose (Abe et al., 2006a) might have some relevance to\nresults of the present study. Chronic high-glucose environ-\nments also increased PPP activities in astroglia, while glucose\nutilization (as assessed using [14C]deoxyglucose phosphoryla-\ntion measured at 2 mmol/l glucose) was not altered\n(Figure 1A). Importantly, the PPP activities in astroglia that\nhad been cultured at 23 mmol/l glucose for 10 days were\nhigher than those in astroglia cultured at 5 mmol/l for\n10 days measured at either 2 or 20 mmol/l glucose (Figure 4).\nThese results indicate that chronic high-glucose environ-\nments enhance PPP activities preserving the dependence of\nPPP activities on glucose concentrations. Therefore some\nadditional mechanisms may act to elevate the PPP activities\nat any concentration of D-glucose. To explore the underlying\nmechanisms, we focused on the transcriptional regulation of\nG6PDH, a rate-liming enzyme of the PPP.\nThe G6PDH gene is known to possess an antioxidant\nresponse element and the Keap1/Nrf2 system stimulates\nG6PDH transcription under stressed conditions and this\nresponse is quite rapid (i.e. within 24 h) (Thimmulappa\net al., 2002). Nrf2 is a transcriptional factor that is kept in\nthe cytosol under unstressed conditions, forming a complex\nwith Keap1, an anchor protein bound to the cytoskeleton. The\nKeap1\u00adNrf2 complex is constantly degraded by the protea-\nsome system; thus, the transcriptional activity of Nrf2 is\nsuppressed under normal physiological environments (Surh\ntriggers are known to facilitate Nrf2 translocation from the\ncytosol to the nucleus to bind the antioxidant response\nelement. One trigger is a modification of thiol residues in the\nKeap1\u00adprotein, typically as a result of an increase in ROS\nnatural isothionate found in broccoli sprouts, is a potent\nactivator of Nrf2 (Danilov et al., 2009; Cheung and Kong,\n\u00b4n et al., 2010) and may activate PPP via\nthis mechanism. Another mechanism is the phosphorylation\nof serine residues in the Nrf2 protein (Surh et al., 2008;\nVargas and Johnson, 2009). Several kinases reportedly phos-\nthat Nrf2 is a direct substrate of PERK, a kinase that acts as a\ntransducer of ER stress (Rasheva and Domingos, 2009). Thus,\nER stress could trigger the Keap1/Nrf2 system-dependent\ntranscriptional regulation of type 2 detoxifying enzymes\nS Takahashi and others\n84 E 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nFirst, we confirmed that sulforaphane enhances PPP activity\nand Nrf2 translocation without BiP expression, a well-known\nER stress marker (Rasheva and Domingos, 2009) in astroglia.\nSecondly, we found that thapsigargin, an ER stress inducer\n(Rasheva and Domingos, 2009) did, indeed, enhance BiP\nexpression, as well as the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, in\nastroglia in association with the enhancement of PPP activity\nin astroglia.\nWe found that the PPP activity in astroglia is approxi-\nmately 4\u00ad5 times higher than that in neurons. The PPP is well\nknown to be active in proliferating cells because the PPP is\nnecessary for DNA synthesis (Wamelink et al., 2008). However,\nthe proliferating activity in astroglia was found to be of no\nrelevance to the high activity of the PPP observed in cultured\nastroglia because mitotic arrest by Ara-C did not affect the\nPPP activity. In addition to the measurement of the basal PPP\nactivity in neurons, we attempted to activate the neuronal\nPPP activity using sulforaphane or thapsigargin. Neither of\nthese agents, however, altered the neuronal PPP activities. The\nenhanced activity of PPP in astroglia did, indeed, decrea-\nse the rates of ROS production in both astroglial and neuronal\ncells when cultured together. Although the measured ROS\nproduction in the fluorimetric system is the sum of the gene-\nration and elimination of the ROS, the observed decreases in\nthe rate of ROS production in the astroglia may reflect\nenhanced elimination or decreased generation. The present\nobservation that acutely increasing glucose concentrations\nelicited increases in GSH content and that these increases were\nfurther suppressed by the addition of L-buthionine sulfox-\nimine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis (Table 3) supports\nthe latter possibility.\nIn fact, the PPP has been reported to be more active in\nastroglia than in neurons (e.g. Ben-Yoseph et al., 1996a,\n\u00b4a-Nogales et al., 2003), as found in the present\nstudy. As mitochondrial respiratory chain is an important\nsource of ROS in the brain, astroglial glutathione may play a\nkey role in protecting against neuronal damage caused by\nROS. GSH in astroglia is reportedly released into the\nextracellular space to reduce ROS and is then transferred to\nneurons for protection. Acute hyperglycaemia increases ROS\nproduction in the endothelium (Nishikawa et al,. 2000;\nalso exhibited the enhanced production of ROS under acutely\nincreasing glucose concentrations. In contrast, the ROS\nproduction in astroglia was reduced by increases in the\nglucose concentrations. Interestingly, in mixed cultures of\nneurons and astroglia, the ROS production remained constant\nas glucose concentrations were elevated. We speculated that\nincreases in astroglial GSH may reduce neuronal ROS\nproduction in our cultured system, as reported by Garci\n\u00b4a-\ndemonstrated that zonisamide, which has been used clinically\nas an anti-epileptic drug, augments astroglial GSH levels and\nresultant increases in cysteine transfer to dopaminergic\nneurons confer a novel protective mechanism against neuronal\ndegeneration through quenching ROS and dopamine quinone\nin Parkinson's disease model in vivo.\nFinally, we explored the regulatory mechanism of the PPP via\nthe Keap1/Nrf2 system in the presence of chronic hypergly-\ncaemia. We focused on hexosamine biosynthetic path-\nway in astroglia (Matthews et al.. 2007), because this pathway\nis known to produce ER stress (Kline et al., 2006; Sage et al.,\n2010) under hyperglycaemic conditions (O\nthe present study, an intermediate metabolite of the\nhexosamine pathway, D-glucosamine, did indeed trigger both\nER stress and Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus, and the PPP\nactivities were enhanced, as evidenced by the results of the\n[14C]glucose assay. These actions of D-glucosamine were also\nconfirmed by dose-dependent decreases in ROS production in\nastroglia. In addition, chronic hyperglycaemia induced BiP\nexpression and the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, as evidenced\nby the immunohistochemical analyses. Taken together, acute\nand chronic hyperglycaemia enhanced the PPP activity using\ndifferent but co-operative pathways.\nMany clinical observations show that long-term hypergly-\nHowever, the adverse effects of hyperglycaemia on the brain\nper se, i.e. diabetic encephalopathy, remain controversial\nreason may be that the brain possesses a potent protective\nmechanism against high-glucose-induced ROS. The present\nstudy provides one possible mechanism by which primarily\nthe astroglia play a pivotal role in neuroprotection against\nROS under hyperglycaemic conditions. In addition, these\nactions of astroglia are dependent on the existence of D-\nglucose. These results imply that reducing the glucose\nconcentrations too rapidly or by too large an extent may\nhave detrimental effects on the astroglial protective system.\nIn fact, reducing the blood glucose level during the acute\nphase of stroke does not necessarily have a beneficial effect\non stroke mortality and functional recovery. Moreover, the\nfluctuation of blood glucose levels, rather than sustained\nhyperglycaemia, is reported to be a more potent risk factor\nfor stroke (Monnier et al., 2006) and dementia, reflecting\nbrain parenchymal cell damage (Fowler and Vasudevan,\nAstroglia always responds to acutely increasing glucose\nconcentrations by enhancing PPP rate irrespective of the\nculture conditions, but basal PPP rate is higher when cells\nwere cultured in high glucose. For example, astroglia cultured\nfor 10 days in a high-glucose environment (23 mmol/l)\nexhibited enhanced PPP rate at 2 or 20 mmol/l D-glucose as\ncompared with PPP rate measured at corresponding D-\nglucose concentration in astroglia that had been cultured in a\nlow-glucose environment (5 mmol/l) (Figure 4). However, the\nnet production of ROS production by astroglia that had been\ncultured in 5 or 23 mmol/l glucose did not differ at 2, 10 and\n20 mmol/l respectively (Table 2). These apparently-conflicting\nresults imply that the enhancement of ROS generation is\novercome under high-glucose environments irrespective of\nAstroglial PPP under hyperglycaemia\nE 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nthe enhanced activity of ROS elimination. We speculate that a\nnon-enzymatic reaction that produces methylglyoxal from\nglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, another minor pathway of\nglucose metabolism, may be involved. Methylglyoxal gen-\nerates AGEs that are well-known sources of ROS under a\nchronic hyperglycaemic state (Dhar et al., 2008; Lo et al.,\n2010). The increased production of methylglyoxal and\nresultant increases in ROS production by AGEs in a hyper-\nglycaemic state have been reported in the vascular system\nhigh-glucose environments overcome the astroglial intrinsic\nprotective mechanism in the long run, they may result in\nbrain damage. Recent findings that experimental diabetes\nincreases production of ROS\u00adreactive nitrogen species and\ninhibits astrocytic gap junctional communication in tissue\nculture and brain slices from streptozotocin-diabetic rats\nsuggest that astroglial dysfunction does, indeed, occur after\nlonger period of disease duration irrespective of intrinsic self-\nAlso, we observed increased immunostaining of Ne-(carbox-\nyethyl)lysine, one of the major AGEs, in astroglia that had been\ncultured in 23 mmol/l glucose for 6 weeks (Figure 11), sup-\nporting the above possibility.

Both of these acute and chronic\nconditions depend on an appropriate glucose content; thus,\nmaintaining glucose concentrations in the proper range is\nrelevant for the astroglial PPP as a neuroprotective mechanism.\nFUNDING\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding\nagency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.\nREFERENCES\nAbe T, Takahashi S, Suzuki N (2006a) Oxidative metabolism in cultured rat\nastroglia: effects of reducing the glucose concentration in the culture\nmedium and of D-aspartate or potassium stimulation.
