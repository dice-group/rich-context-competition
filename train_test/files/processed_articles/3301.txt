    "abstract": "Abstract: Evolutionary psychologists have argued that the emergence of language was\nassociated with reducing direct physical aggression and easing social functioning in small\ngroups. If this is so, then males should use verbal or indirect aggression more frequently\nthan females since they engage in more direct aggression. A recent study found no\nsignificant differences between men and women's self-reports of indirect aggression in a\nU.K. sample. We administered the same questionnaire to 175 male and 311 female\nCanadian university students. Men in this population reported using indirect aggression\nmore frequently than women. The Canadian participants generally reported using indirect\naggression less frequently than the U.K. study sample did, particularly the women. These\nresults suggest that there are cultural differences in adults' frequency of use of indirect\naggression. We review a number of possible reasons to account for these different results.\n",

Agonistic\nbehaviors may allow an individual to gain access to limiting resources, such as food,\nterritories, mates, or social dominance, and should therefore be under strong evolutionary\nselection. In addition to benefits, there can be high costs associated with physical\naggression (Maynard Smith and Parker, 1976; Maynard Smith and Price, 1973) including\nharm to the aggressor (Geist, 1974). Physical attacks are not the only form of aggression.\nOther, more indirect or covert, acts can serve some of the same functions (Cairns, 1986;\nLittle, Jones, Henrich, and Hawley, 2003). A number of different terms have been applied\nto these less direct forms of aggression, including relational (Crick and Grotpeter, 1995;\nIndirect aggression\nLittle et al., 2003; Werner and Crick, 1999), covert (Bj\u00f6rkqvist, \u00d6sterman, and Lagerspetz,\n1994), relational-appearing (Bj\u00f6rkqvist et al., 1994), social aggression or social\nmanipulation (Bj\u00f6rkqvist et al., 1994; Crick and Grotpeter, 1995; Galen and Underwood,\n1997), and verbal, indirect, hostile, or emotional aggression (see Bj\u00f6rkqvist, 1992, for a\nreview). While these different terms have different nuances (see Archer, 2001), we are\nprimarily concerned with distinguishing between physical, verbal, and indirect aggression,\naggression involves physical contact with objects or another person--behaviors such as\nhitting, kicking, and pushing. Verbal aggression involves behaviors such as yelling,\nspeaking hurtful remarks, and making threats. Indirect aggression is different from physical\nand verbal aggression in that it uses indirect methods to cause harm, sometimes without the\naggressor being identifiable, and includes acts such as the manipulation of social\nenvironments to hurt the target. Behaviors of indirect aggression include damaging\nanother's self-esteem or social status, using humor hurtfully, spreading rumors behind\nsomeone's back, damage to interpersonal relationships by excluding others from a group,\npurposeful manipulation of others, or secretive acts intended to harm another person\nsocially or emotionally. Previous researchers have sometimes distinguished between\ndifferent kinds of indirect or covert aggression and have labeled them with different terms.\nFor our purposes in this paper, indirect aggression refers broadly to all acts intended to\nharm through use of social and/or emotional means.\nEvolutionary psychologists have argued that a strong selection pressure in the\nevolution of language among humans' ancestors was the replacement of high-cost physical\naggression with less damaging verbal and indirect means to negotiate status and power\nwithin a social group (e.g., Cairns, 1986; Locke and Bogin, 2006). If so, then one might\npredict that males would use indirect aggression more frequently than females (Locke and\nBogin, 2006; cf. Cairns, 1986). Alternatively, the use of indirect aggression may have more\nto do with the vulnerability of the target. This would suggest that females would use more\nindirect aggression, as they value their social relationships higher than males do.\nLagerspetz et al. (1988) found that 11- and 12-year old girls formed tighter friendships with\nother girls, while boys of the same age had very loose friendships with other boys of their\ncohort. If females tend to value close friendships more than males, then more indirect\naggression aimed at gaining status through social means might be more effective for\nfemales. In fact, research on sex differences in the use of indirect aggression has yielded\nmixed results.\nThe majority of research on aggression has been done on school-aged children.\nMany studies show that young boys often use more physical aggression than young girls\nFerguson, and Gari\u00e9py, 1989; Crick and Grotpeter, 1995). Some studies of school-aged\nchildren show that girls are just as aggressive as boys, but that they use more indirect\n1988), while other studies have shown that adolescent boys use more relational aggression\ndevelopmental trend for aggression. Bj\u00f6rkqvist et al. (1992a) studied Finns of four different\nage groups: 8-, 11-, 15-, and 18-year olds. Boys tended to display physical aggression the\nIndirect aggression\nmost at ages 8 and 11. Verbal aggression increased by ages 11 and 15, and indirect\naggression was used later on, during ages 11, 15, and 18. Girls displayed substantially less\nphysical aggression than boys at all ages, and used slightly more verbal and indirect\naggression than boys at ages 11, 15, and 18. Indirect aggression appears to require\nawareness and understanding of social relationships. As social intelligence increases with\nage, so should the ability to use indirect aggression effectively. Girls typically have tighter\nsocial relationships than boys do (Lagerspetz, et al., 1988) and therefore, are more able to\nuse indirect measures of aggression to their advantage. Green, Richardson, and Lago\n(1996) directly tested whether the size of social networks of young adults predicted the rate\nof self-reported aggression. They found that the size of social networks did not predict the\nrate of direct or indirect aggression in females. However, males with high-density social\nnetworks used more indirect than direct aggression.\nThe few studies to examine the use of direct and indirect aggression in adults\nsuggest that aggression does not necessarily decrease when compared to children's usage,\nbut it is employed in subtler, and less direct forms. Bj\u00f6rkqvist et al. (1994) showed that\nadult male Swedes used more direct relational-appearing aggression, such as criticizing\nwork, while females used more indirect social manipulations such as gossiping. When\nmeasures of aggression were considered in these two categories, women were equally as\naggressive as men. Sex differences were also found in bullying in an adult prison\npopulation in the U.K. (Ireland and Archer, 1996). Women reported perceiving more\nbullying overall and specifically more indirect bullying, whereas men reported perceiving\nmore direct bullying than indirect methods, and less bullying overall.\nMany studies of indirect aggression, especially in children, use peer-report methods\nrather than self-report, with the reasoning that since aggression is socially unacceptable,\ntests that rely on admissions of aggression will not be reliable. With peer-reports, peers can\ndescribe how often they have seen direct or indirect aggressive behavior in a fellow peer.\nHowever, the very nature of indirect aggression draws on the ability to remain anonymous,\ntherefore, peer-reports may not capture the true amount of indirect aggressive behavior\nused by specific individuals, and self-report methods might be better at measuring indirect\naggression.\nForrest, Eatough, and Shevlin (2005) asked British university students to report on\nthe frequency with which they used, or were the targets of, indirect aggression. Indirect\naggression was classified by three categories: social exclusion, use of malicious humor, and\nguilt induction. They found no sex differences on the frequency of self-reported indirect\naggression in any of these categories or the overall frequency of using indirect aggression.\nWhy are there such varied results with regard to sex differences in the use of\nindirect aggression? One possibility is cultural differences in what qualifies as indirect\naggression. To understand how such cultural differences might be manifested, we briefly\nreview the literature related to sex differences on humor used aggressively. We focus on\nhumor because more research has been done on humor than on social exclusion or guilt\ninduction. For example, Baumeister, Stillwell, and Heatherton (1995) reported that guilt\ninduction could serve several functions in interpersonal relationships, such as inducing\naction on the part of the other person or redistributing emotional distress. They did not,\nhowever, test for the possibility of sex differences in the use of guilt induction. Coyne and\nArcher (2004) reviewed the direct and indirect aggressive acts in television shows popular\namong British adolescents and found that females were portrayed as committing most of\nIndirect aggression\nthe acts of indirect aggression, particularly in terms of social exclusion and malicious\nhumor.\nHumor\nHumor may function to allow coping with stress, anxiety, and hostile or aggressive\nfeelings in a socially acceptable way (Abel, 1998; McGhee and Lloyd, 1982; Woods,\n1983). Using humor can be an effective way to gain status, particularly in a leadership role\n(Priest and Swain, 2002). Males have been shown to use humor more than females (Hay,\nyoung as the early school years (McGhee and Lloyd, 1982) and continues through\nadolescence (F\u00fchr, 2002) and into adulthood (e.g., Hay, 2000; Honeycutt and Brown,\n1998). Some evidence comes from studies of class clowns, who use humor to challenge\nauthority and reduce stress among classmates resulting from novel or strange situations\n(Hobday-Kusch and McVittie, 2002; Jewell, 2005). Class clowns are overwhelmingly boys\n(Damico and Pukey, 1978), probably because boys can use humor to gain prestige,\nparticularly with other boys (Hobday-Kusch and McVittie, 2002; Suitor, Powers and\nBrown, 2004). Men are also more likely than women to use humor to negotiate status and\ncope with difficult situations (Hay, 2000). It should be noted that these sex differences are\ngenerally limited to humor production--few sex differences have been reported in humor\nappreciation (Martin and Kuiper, 1999; Azim, Mobbs, Jo, Menon, and Reiss, 2005).\nWhile sex differences in humor production have been found in some studies, others\nreport no sex differences. Sullivan (2002) reported no differences between mothers' and\nfathers' use of humor to cope with having a child with Down syndrome. Forrest et al.\n(2005) also reported no sex differences in using humor in an indirectly aggressive way.\nBoth of these studies relied on self-reports and were run in Great Britain. It is not clear if\nsex differences are more likely to appear when observing actual behavior or asking for peer\nsex differences with self-report measures). Alternatively, it is possible that there are\ncultural differences in the use of humor. For example, Kazarian and Martin (2004) found\nthat Lebanese adults used less aggressive humor than Belgians.\nWe know of no evidence suggesting that Britons and Canadians use aggressive or\nmalicious humor differently. However, there is some evidence that the use of humor more\ngenerally by Britons might be different from that by North Americans. For example, British\nadvertising executives approve a broader use of humor in advertising than their American\ncounterparts (Weinberger and Spotts, 1989). Similarly, a comparison of British and\nAmerican beer ads showed that British ads used humor as the major source of appeal, while\nAmerican ads used emotional or sexual appeal (Caillat and Mueller, 1996). These studies\nsuggest that there might be differences in how humor is used in the two countries (see\nThe present study\nIn this study, we measured the self-reported rates of indirect aggression among\nCanadian adults. We replicated Forrest et al.'s (2005) British questionnaire on a Canadian\npopulation. We chose Forrest et al.'s (2005) measure because it has strong psychometric\nproperties and was designed to measure indirect aggression among adults. There are a\nnumber of cultural similarities between the United Kingdom and Canada. Canada is a\nIndirect aggression\nCommonwealth country and the majority of its citizens speak English. Canadians often use\nBritish spellings, rather than American spellings. Canadians also share many cultural\nsimilarities with Americans-- standard oral Canadian English is only subtly different from\nstandard oral American English (some small pronunciation differences and some different\nwords). Caillat and Mueller (1996) review some of the outstanding cultural differences\nbetween the United Kingdom and the United States (such as individualism and use of direct\nor indirect speech). In our experience, most of those differences would apply to a United\nKingdom-Canada comparison as well.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\n175 male and 311 female University of Alberta undergraduates participated in this\nstudy and received credit toward their introductory psychology class for their participation.\nMaterials\nWe used one of the scales created by Forrest et al. (2005) to measure indirect\naggression. They created 2 versions of the Indirect Aggression Scales (IAS): the Aggressor\nversion (IAS-A) that measures usage of aggression towards someone else, and the Target\nversion (IAS-T) that measures the experience of being a victim of indirect aggression. We\nused the IAS-A version only since we were interested in the use of aggressive behavior but\nnot the experience of being a victim. Forrest et al. (2005) constructed the IAS using\ninterviews and survey questions. The original IAS-A questionnaire consisted of 35 items\nbut was reduced to 25 items after item analyses and factor analyses were conducted. We\nused these 25 items in our study. The use of this scale was granted ethical approval by the\nUniversity of Alberta, Faculty of Arts, Science and Law Research Ethics Board.\nProcedure\nThe IAS-A was administered in mass testing in introductory psychology classes.\nThe procedure was the same as in the Forrest et al. (2005) study. Participants read and\nsigned consent forms at the beginning of the mass testing session indicating that they had\nbeen informed of their rights and could withdraw from the testing session at anytime\nwithout penalty. Participants received a paper version of the scale and were asked to\nindicate how often they had used the 25 listed behaviors in the past 12 months by using the\nfollowing scale: A = Never, B = Once or Twice, C = Sometimes, D = Often, and E =\nRegularly. These answers were converted to numerical scores with A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, D\n= 4, and E = 5. With this method of scoring, the lowest possible score that an individual\ncould receive was 25 and the highest possible score was 125. Names were not required on\nthe forms, providing a high level of anonymity to the participants.\nResults\nValidity of the IAS-A\nForrest et al. (2005) constructed their scale with items that were based on\ninformation gathered during qualitative interviews. Interviewees were asked about personal\nexperiences with indirect aggression over a variety of contexts. From these interviews\nIndirect aggression\nbehaviors were listed and scale items were constructed, giving the scale high face validity.\nThe internal construct validity of the IAS-A was assessed by Forrest et al. (2005) using\nMaximum Likelihood exploratory factor analyses on the original 35 items. This resulted in\n3 factors that cumulatively accounted for 35.89% of the variance: factor 1 items were\nassociated with malicious humor, factor 2 items were associated with social exclusion, and\nfactor 3 items were associated with guilt induction. Ten items failed to load consistently on\nany one factor and did not make theoretical sense with the other items in each factor and\nwere therefore removed. The remaining 25 items were split into 3 subscales: Social\nExclusionary, 10 items; Malicious Humor, 9 items; and Guilt Induction, 6 items. See\nappendix for all items.\nWe also did a Maximum Likelihood factor analysis on the data we collected using\nthe IAS-A. We cannot directly compare the eigen values or amount of variance accounted\nfor between our data and Forrest et al.'s (2005) because their factor analyses were\nconducted on the original 35 items and our data uses the conclusive 25 items. However, we\ndid find three factors with eigen values above one, just like the original factor analyses, and\nalmost all of the items loaded on the same factors as Forrest et al. (2005) found. The few\ndifferences we found were only marginally numerically different from the Forrest et al.\n(2005) analyses. In order to compare our data with the data in the British study we grouped\nthe items into the same subscales used by Forrest et al. (2005).\nReliability of the IAS-A subscales\nForrest et al. (2005) measured the reliability of the subscales of the IAS-A and\nfound Cronbach's alpha coefficient to be 0.82 for the Social Exclusion items, 0.84 for items\nthat focused on the use of Malicious Humor, and 0.81 for items regarding Guilt Induction.\nUsing the same items as Forrest et al. (2005) did for each subscale, we calculated\nCronbach's alpha coefficient for the data collected from our Canadian sample and found it\nto be similarly reliable: 0.86 for Social Exclusion, 0.85 for Malicious Humor, and 0.78 for\nGuilt Induction.\nCanadians: gender differences\nWe were interested in seeing if there is a gender difference in how indirect\naggression is conducted in Canada. The 3 subscales of the IAS-A categorize 3 different\nways indirectly aggressive behavior can be performed and measured. Mean (standard\nerrors) scores for the total indirect aggression scale and each subscale, are shown in Table\n1. A 3 x 2 (Subscale x Gender) ANOVA, with the Subscale as a repeated measure was\nbetween genders on all subscales, as summarized in Table 1.\nIndirect aggression\nTable 1.

(2005). When our sample is compared to the\nsample presented by Forrest et al. (2005), we find that Canadian females score lower than\nthe Britons on all subscales: social exclusion (t (694) = -4.33, p < .001), malicious humor (t\npresent sample scored lower than those in the Forrest et al. (2005) sample on guilt\nIn summary, Canadians use less indirect aggression than Britons, particularly\nCanadian women, and Canadian men are more indirectly aggressive than Canadian women\non all subscales.\nIndirect aggression\nFigure 1. Sex differences in the indirect aggression subscales, within and between a\nCanadian sample (current study) and a British sample (Forrest et al. study).\nDiscussion\nWe found that an individual's gender influenced the self-reported frequency of\nindirectly aggressive behavior in Canadians. Males reported significantly higher rates of\nindirect aggression (social exclusion, malicious humor, and guilt induction) than females.\nThese results differ from those reported by Forrest et al. (2005), who found no sex\ndifferences within any indirect aggression subtype. The Canadians in this study also\ngenerally reported significantly fewer acts of indirect aggression than did the British\nparticipants, particularly the females. Why did we get different results from Forrest et al.\n(2005)? We consider four possible sources for the differences in these two studies, in\nIndirect aggression\nroughly increasing order of likelihood.\nFirst, it is possible that there are cultural differences in willingness to report indirect\naggression. If so, the British adults might be more willing to report their own acts of\nindirect aggression than Canadians. Some studies have suggested that sex differences in\nself-report studies may be due to males being more comfortable with their aggression than\nfemales (e.g., Little et al., 2003). At the moment, we know of no reason to suspect that\nthere should be differences between Britons and Canadians in terms of self-report biases.\nNonetheless, it is clearly important to complement self-report data with other measures.\nA second possibility is that demographic differences between the samples may\nexplain some of the differences in the two populations. British adults might feel a higher\ndegree of perceived threat than Canadian adults. The population density of Nottingham\nkilometer, while the population density of Edmonton (where the present study was carried\nout) was 974.0 people per square kilometer (2001 census data from respective countries).\nCrowding and associated factors may increase the perceived risk of violence (Choldin,\n1978; Kposowa, Breault, and Harrison, 1995). The responses to density may differ between\nthe sexes, as they do in rhesus monkeys, where males use more coping mechanisms (such\nas huddling together) as population density increases, while females increase all forms of\naggression (Judge and de Waal, 1997). According to the British Home Office report on\ncrime (www.homeoffice.gov.uk) and Correctional Service Canada (www.csc-scc.gc.ca) the\npercentage of inmates that were female was higher in Britain than in Canada in 2004 (5.7%\nvs. 3.1%, respectively), and the percentage of inmates that were female and serving life\nsentences, was also higher in Britain than in Canada in the same year (5.0% vs. 2.4%\nrespectively). To the extent that criminal activity is related to aggressive behavior, it is\npossible that Britons, and particularly women, are more aggressive overall (i.e., both direct\nand indirect aggression) than Canadians as a result of a higher perception of threat due to a\nhigher population density. To confirm this possibility, it would be minimally necessary to\ncompare the rates of direct aggression between the two countries.\nA third possible explanation for the differences between our study and that of\nForrest et al. (2005) is that there may be cultural differences in the time spent in same-sex\ngroups. Men and women use humor in a teasing and aggressive way more often when they\nare in same-sex groups than when they are in mixed-sex groups (Hay, 2000). If British\nadults spend more time in same-sex groups than Canadians, then they might report higher\nlevels of indirect aggression than Canadians. Future research needs to examine the\nrelationship between time spent in same-sex versus mixed-sex groups, and look at the\nvarious forms of aggression that is observed while controlling for the gender of the\ninterlocutors.\nFinally, it is possible that we found differences in self-report frequencies relative to\nBritons because there are cultural differences in what counts as aggressive behavior, and in\nwhat is considered appropriate behavior for men and women. We know aggressive humor\ncan differ by culture (Kazarian and Martin, 2004; Weller, Amitsour, and Pazzi, 1976) so it\nseems likely that aspects of indirect aggression might be affected by culture. This\npossibility seems the most likely and may follow some of the United Kingdom-United\nStates cultural differences observed by other researchers (e.g., Caillat and Mueller, 1996).\nAn analogous conclusion can be drawn from the research on emotional expression. There\nare similarities across cultures as to how some emotions are expressed (e.g., Darwin,\nIndirect aggression\n1872/1924), particularly those emotions that are expressed in infancy (e.g., Malatesta,\nCulver, Tesman, and Shepard, 1989). However, different cultures use emotions differently\nin order to regulate interpersonal relationships (see, for example, Lutz and White, 1986).\nBy analogy, we might expect aggression to be a common human trait, but how it gets\nexpressed could be highly culture-specific. Such subtle differences between closely related\ncultures and populations likely represent phenotypic plasticity; the behavioral differences\nare culturally contingent manifestations of the same underlying strategy. The expected\ncosts and benefits to differing degrees of aggression are not exactly the same in the two\ncultural backgrounds, but the life-history strategy is the same. For example, it is possible\nthat there is an evolved tendency for men to use more indirect aggression that women (e.g.,\nLocke and Bogin, 2006), which is why we see male adolescents use more indirect\naggression than females (Little et al., 2003). However, with the effect of socialization\n(which could differ by culture), the absolute frequencies of their use change. For example,\nBritish adolescents watch many TV shows in which female characters use a lot of indirect\naggression (Coyne and Archer, 2004). So, it is possible that sex differences in the\nfrequency of indirect aggression will emerge as a result of socialization, adjustment by each\nindividual in the perceived optimally effective level of indirect aggression. Differences\nbetween cultures in the perception of an act may be investigated by scoring how subjects in\nthe two cultures perceive the same scenario depicting a potential act of indirect aggression.\nCross-cultural developmental studies of aggressive behavior would be required to assess\nhow differences between cultures develop with age in comparison to differences between\nthe sexes. We predict that sex differences would develop first, and that culture effects\nwould appear later, after the physiological differences were established.\nBefore closing, it is important to note that this study relied on self-report data of\nsome behaviors that are not necessarily considered socially acceptable (see also Green et\nal., 1996). We do not know if we have a valid measure of the frequency of indirect\naggression. However, echoing Green et al. (1996), we are confident that the comparisons of\nthe relative use of indirect aggression are solid. Future research on indirect aggression\nshould also include behavioral measures.\nIndividuals ought to use whatever behavioral strategy they judge to be most\nprobable to achieve the desired outcome while minimizing the risk of the least desired\noutcomes. This choice of behavior ought to depend upon understanding of cultural norms\nand ability, including the social intelligence required for indirect aggression, as well as the\nperceived costs and benefits of failure and success. Further work investigating the ability,\nreal or perceived, and desirability to use indirect aggression, may identify the proximate\nfactors that account for variation in the use of this behavior.\n"
