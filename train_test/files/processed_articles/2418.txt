In this study, we validated a method to extract information from cross-\nsectional survey for quantifying population dynamics of adolescent smoking behavior progression.\nMethods: With a 3-stage 7-path model, probabilities of smoking behavior progression were estimated employing\nthe Probabilistic Discrete Event System (PDES) method and the cross-sectional data from 1997-2006 National Survey\non Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Validity of the PDES method was assessed using data from the National Longitudinal\nSurvey of Youth 1997 and trends in smoking transition covering the period during which funding for tobacco control was\ncut substantively in 2003 in the United States.\nResults: Probabilities for all seven smoking progression paths were successfully estimated with the PDES method\nand the NSDUH data. The absolute difference in the estimated probabilities between the two approaches varied from\nConclusions: The PDES method has validity in quantifying population dynamics of smoking behavior progression\nwith cross-sectional survey data. The estimated transitional probabilities add new evidence supporting more advanced\ntobacco research, tobacco control planning and tobacco use prevention practice.

The PDES\nmethod is an established analytical technique for modeling and\ncontrol in industry to describe assembly lines and other systems [17-\n20]. According to the PDES method, a cross-sectional survey is like\na \"snapshot\" of the status of a system and the dynamics of a system\ncan be described with such snapshot data. In a previous study, we have\nmathematically established the PDES method that can minimize the\nimpact of population variationsinbirths,deathsandsubstantial changes\nin smoking prevalence on modeling by the use of state probabilities\n[21]. In this study, we reported our empirical work to validate the PDES\nmethod.\nThe PDES method differs from a few methods that have been\nattempted by others [22,23]. In one study that focused on prediction of\nsmoking using a state-transition model, the transition rates of starting,\nquitting and relapsing were estimated using cross-sectional data and a\nrestrictedquadraticmultinomialandquadraticlogisticregressionspline\n[22]. However, this method did not consider changes in population and\nsmoking behavior. Another study employed a heterogeneous Markov\nmodel to estimate entry and exit transition probabilities, but for this\nmethod to work, data from at least two consecutive cross-sectional\nsurveys are needed [23]. In addition, none of these methods have been\nvalidated.\nMethods\nData for PDES modeling\nTen-yearcross-sectionaldatawerederivedfromtheNationalSurvey\nThe NSDUH is an on-going effort sponsored by the Substance Abuse\nand Mental Health Services Administration and carried out by the\nResearch Triangle Institute, Cary, North Carolina through contracted\nprojects. The multi-stage random cluster sampling scheme was used in\nthe NSDUH to select participants that represent all civilian and non-\ninstitutionalized population 12 years of age and older in the United\nStates. Participants 12-17 years old were included for this analysis. After\na screening test, the trained data collectors were sent to the sampled\nhouseholds to administrate the survey using the Computer-Assisted\nPersonal Interviewing (CAPI) technique. The 1997 NSDUH data were\nused for comparison with the probabilities estimated with longitudinal\ndata (see the section on longitudinal data later in this paper) and\nthe 10-year NSDUH data were used to show time trends in smoking\nbehavior progression. Although changes were made to the NSDUH\nadolescents), previous studies showed limited impact of these changes\non the overall trend of cigarette smoking [24].\nPDES method and smoking progression\nPDES model is an extension of discrete event systems model. When\nconsidering probabilities of states and events, PDES models are similar\n\n\n\nXS\n\nFigure 1: A Schematic Model Depicting the Progression of adolescent\nsmoking behavior\nNote: NS=Never-smokers, CS=Current smokers and XS=Ex-smokers;\nsigma=Probability of transition\nQ\nq \nis the initial state. For example,  (idle,\nstartup)=working means that at \"idle\" stage, the event \"startup\" will\nbring the system to \"working\". To simplify the notations, we also use\nq\ni\nto denote the probability of the system being at state q\ni\nand use \ni\nto\ndenote the probability of \ni\noccurring.\nTo describe the system, multiple cross-sectional measures\n(snapshots) of the system status Q will be obtained: Q(t), Q(t +T),\nQ(t +2T)..., (T=sampling interval). The PDES method assumes that\nthe system status at time t +T depends on its status at time t and the\ntransitions occurred during the sampling interval [t, t +T]. Obviously,\nwhen the system is running in a stable status, one snapshot would\ncontain adequate information to describe the system.\nFollowing the assembly principle, a 3-stage model (Figure 1) was\nproposed to validate the PDES method in analyzing smoking behavior.\nIn the model, NS=never-smokers, participants who have never smoked\nby the time of survey; CS=current smokers, participants who smoked\ncurrently; and XS=ex-smokers, participants who ever smoked and\ndid not smoke now, therefore Q={NS, CS, XS}. The arrowed lines in\nthe figure indicate the seven transition paths or events, ={\n,\n,...\n,\n}. When individual children in a population grow up, they will all\npass through the PDES system to become different types of smokers.\nLikewise, data from a cross-sectional survey provides a snapshot Q\n={NS, CS, XS}, from which transitional probabilities \n\n\n... \ncan\nbe estimated (Figure 1).\nAdvances in Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nMethods and Survival Analysis\nConceiving cross-sectional surveys in a longitudinal perspective\ncreates a basis which supports the development of methods capable of\nextracting longitudinal information from such data [16]. For example,\nif from a cross-sectional survey conducted in one year, we estimated\nthat the number of neversmokers for participants aged 12 and 13 are\n400 and 300 respectively, then the probability for a participant aged\n12 to remain as a never-smoke during an one-year period would be\nprobabilities by this approach requires two additional assumptions:\n(1) Changes in the number of people by age between two consecutive\nyears are negligible (stable population assumption as in demographic\nstudies for life expectancy estimation) [16] and (2) changes in smoking\nbehavior for individuals of the same age between two consecutive years\nare also negligible compared to changes in smoking behavior across\nages in a year.\nAccording to the PDES method, modeling an assembly system with\na number of connected workstations can be achieved through cross-\nsectional assessment (snapshot) [22,23]. When the system is in running\nparts for a product (e.g., a car) are continuously put into the system\nand processed through various workstations to produce the needed\nproduct. Using PDES, such an assembly system G can be described as:\nG=(Q, , , q\nwhere Q={q\n,q\n,...,q\nn\n} is the state set of the system such as idle,\nworking or breakdown; ={\n,\n,...,\nm\n} is the event set representing\ntransitions from one state to another; :Q\u00d7Q is the transition\nfunction describing what event can occur at which state and the\nresulting states; and\nCitation: Chen X, Lin F (2012) Estimating Transitional Probabilities with Cross-Sectional Data to Assess Smoking Behavior Progression: A Validation\nLongitudinal data for validation analysis\nLongitudinal data for validating the PDES model were derived\nfrom the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97). The\nNSLY97 is sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department\nof Labor and carried out by the Center for Human Resource Research,\nOhio State University. Participants were selected using the multi-stage\nstratified random sampling method. Youths 12 to 16 years old by the end\nresponse rate was 72%. Data were collected by trained researchers at\nhome using the CAPI technique. In addition to cigarette smoking,\nsurvey dates were collected for assessing the duration between surveys.\nEstimation of transitional probabilities with longitudinal\ndata\nWe directly estimated the same seven transitional probabilities\n={\n(a),\n(a),...,\n(a)} by age as with the PDES method with the\nNLSY97 data. In computing these transitional probabilities, we first\ndefined the three types of smokers NS, CS, and XS at the baseline in\nfollowing the definitions described for the PDES method above and\ndata derived from the following three questions: (1) \"Have you ever\nsmoked a cigarette?\" (2) During the past 30 days, on how many of the\ndays did you smoke a cigarette?\" (3) \"Have you smoked a cigarette since\nthe last interview on [date of last interview]?\"\ntransitional probability from one type of smokers to another during\nthe one-year period was estimated as the ratio of the two in 1997 and\n1998. Since the time interval between the two surveys for individual\nparticipants was not equal but varied from 6-23 months, the method of\nperson-years at-risk was used for probability estimation [13,14].\nData processing and statistical computing\nResults\nSample characteristics and state probability\nTable 1 summarizes basic demographic characteristics of the\nstudy samples.

However, the PDES models also consider properties\nsuch as controllability, observability, detectability, and diagnosability\nthat are not considered in MC models.\nCategorization of participants into different types of smokers\nFigure 2 illustrates the algorithm used in this study to classify\nparticipants into various types of smokers for analysis. To define\nQ={NS, CS, XS}, data from the two questions were used. (1) \"Have you\never smoked a cigarette, even one or two puffs?\" (yes/no) and (2) \"How\nlong has it been since you last smoked a cigarette?\" (within 30 days, 30\ndays to one year, one year ago and within three years, and three years\nago). Participants were classified as NS if they responded negatively\nto question (1); participants will be coded as CS if they smoked\nwithin the past 30 days based on their responses to questions (1) and\n(2); participants were classified as XS if they responded positively to\nquestion (1) and last smoking was 30 days ago.\nTo solve for the PDES model, three additional types of smokers were\nneeded: (1) NXS -- NS progressed to CS and further to XS within the past\nyear; (2) CXS -- CS a year ago (old CS) progressed to XS in the past year;\nand (3) XXS -- XS a year ago (old XS) remained as XS in the past year\n(see Figure 2 for details). To specify these three types of smokers, data\nfrom one more question \"How old (age in years) were you the first time\nyou smoked a cigarette, even one or two puffs?\" was added.\nEstimation of state probability and transitional probability\nThe state probability for each of the six smoking types described\nabove was computed as the proportion (%) of a type relative to the total\nsample. The state probabilities were computed by age to obtain NS(a),\nNXS(a), CS(a), XS(a) for a=12, 13...17 and were used as data to solve\nfor ={\n(a),\n(a),...,\n(a)}. As an innovation of the PDES method,\nutilization of the state probabilities minimizes the impact of sudden\nchanges in population (births, deaths) and/or smoking behavior on\ntransitional probability estimation [21]. To account for the complex\nsampling designs used in NSDUH and NLSY97, the Proc Survey Means\nwas used to compute state probabilities.\nTo obtain transitional probabilities, the estimated state probabilities\nby single year of age were converted to state probability at the beginning\nof an age by taking an average of two probabilities at the consecutive\nprobability at the beginning of age 13. With the converted state\nprobabilities, the following matrix equation was used to estimate all\ntransitional probabilities = {\n(a),\n(a),...,\n(a)}:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n+\n+\n-\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n -\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n=\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\na\nNXS\na\nXXS\na\nCXS\na\nNS\na\nNS\na\nNS\na\nXS\na\nCS\na\nNS\na\nNS\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever\nsmoked a\ncigarette, even\none or two\npuffs?\nYes\nDid you smoke\ndays?\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nOld XS as ex-\nsmokers (XXS)\nOld CS to ex-\nsmokers (CXS)\nNever-smoker to\nex-smokers (NXS)\nCurrent smokers\n(CS)\nNever-smokers\n(NS)\nEx-smokers (XS)\nAge of smoking onset\n= age at survey?\nbut within a year?\nYes\nNo\nSmoked 1 year ago\nNo\nNo\nFigure 2: Algorithm for classifying respondents into different types of smokers\nfor modeling analysis.\nBoth the NSDUH data and NLSY97 data were acquired through\nthe Inter-University Consortium for political and social research.\nData were re-coded after a thorough review of all the related technical\ndocuments from the data provider.

This method will\nbe of particular significance to countries and places where tobacco use\nis highly prevalent while resources are limited to collect longitudinal\nTechnical consideration in the application of the PDES\nmethod\nCross-sectional survey data are widely available to assess tobacco\nuse at the state, national, and even global levels [15,28-32]. With the\nPDES method, transitional probabilities can be estimated with data\nfrom one single cross-sectional survey to assess various steps of smoking\nbehavior progression over time, by single year of age, and stratified by\ngender, race/ethnicity to describe population dynamics of tobacco\nuse behavior. Transitional probabilities can also be estimated across\nsubgroups of significant predictor variables such as education, peer\ninfluences, school performance, parental monitoring, and receptivity to\npro-tobacco media to assess factors associated with smoking behavior\nprogression.\nOne advantage of the PDES method is that it can be used to assess\neffect from tobacco control at the macro level. When multi-year cross-\nsectional data are available, like the NSDUH used in this study, time\ntrends of the estimated transitional probabilities with such data can be\nrelated to various tobacco control activities (e.g., tobacco taxation, legal\nrestrictions, school-based programs, or tobacco cessation) to assess\neffects from such effort. As we have showed in this study that reductions\nin quitting and increase in relapsing in the US were associated with\nsustained effort for tobacco control up to 2002 before a sudden and\nsubstantial funding cut at the national and state level in 2003. Such\neffect could not be revealed without application of the PDES method\n[24,33]. In addition to historical analysis, a contrast of transitional\nprobabilities between exposed and non-exposed youth will provide\ndata for assessing tobacco control programs. For example, data from\nthe NSDUH on exposure to several types of educational programs\nWhen transitional probabilities are compared over time or across\ninterventions, information can also be derived to assess: (1) tobacco\ncontrol effort on specific steps of smoking behavior progression (e.g.,\nfrom never-smokers to smoker and further to ex-smokers); (2) the\neffect in a specific smoking progression step (e.g. increasing quitter or\nreducing experimenters) in reducing the total number of smokers; (3)\nthe progression steps that are sensitive to change; and (4) the amount\nof changes needed in a transition step to achieve a pre-determined\ntobacco control objective. This type of information is useful for tobacco\ncontrol planning and program strategy optimization [15,36,37].\nDespite the strengths, caution is suggested when the PDES method\nis used when sudden and substantial changes in population size\nsmoking behavior in the survey year. In addition, we recommend using\nsingle-year age-group for analysis so that the stability assumption of the\nPDES method will not be violated.\nAcknowledgements\nThe research was supported by National Institute of Health, National Institute\nData used for this research was provided by the Inter-University Consortium\nfor Policies and Social Science Research.\nWe also thank the two research assistants, Xun Zhang and Yifan Jiang, for\ntheir assistance in data processing and some of the modeling analysis.\nReferences\n1.

Despite much progress in tobacco use prevention across the globe\n[3], further advancement in tobacco control requires data beyond the\nstatic measures of prevalence rates to cover steps of smoking behavior\nprogression. Smoking behavior is rather complex and it involves a series\nof sophisticated neurobiological, psychosocial and behavioral processes\n[4-7]. Researchers who have investigated the population dynamics of\nsmoking behavior proposed a number of models, including but are not\nlimited to, Flay's five-stage model (preparatory, trying, experimental,\nregular use and addicted/dependent use) [8], which was adopted by\nthe U.S. Department of Health Services in the 1994 Surgeon General's\nReport [9]; Prochaska's Theory of Stages of Change and Transtheoretical\nModel [10,11]; and Mayhew's six-stage conceptual framework that\nintegrates both Flay's and Prochaska's models [12]. Although these\nmodels are promising, establishment of such models requires panel\ndata collected through longitudinal designs.\nCollecting longitudinal data involves repeatedly following-up\nof individual participants over time. This is technically demanding\nand practically expensive because of increased efforts to plan and\nimplement such projects and increased burdens on the participants\n(being repeatedly contacted) and the related entities (e.g., families,\nschools, etc) [13,14]. Consequently, longitudinal surveys are relatively\nscant, and such data particularly lack in the developing and transitional\ncounties with more than 80% of the smokers in the world but limited\nresources for tobacco research and tobacco control planning and\npractice [15]. Nevertheless, more longitudinal information is needed\n(1) to better understand the population dynamics of smoking behavior,\n(2) to locate strategically sensitive steps (e.g., smoking initiation,\nquitting, relapse, etc) along the smoking behavior progression for\nprevention intervention, and (3) to evaluate a prevention program on\nvarious progression steps for improvement.\nChallenges to extracting longitudinal information from\ncross-sectional data\nCross-sectional data are widely available from a number of sources,\nincluding the Global Youth Tobacco Survey, the National Survey on\nDrug Use and Health (formerly known as National Household Survey\non Drug Abuse), the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance, and Monitor\nthe Future Studies. Although no individual participants are followed\nin a cross-sectional survey, conceptually data from such surveys may\ncontain longitudinal information. For example, a cross-sectional survey\nof a sample of participants (a) to (a+n) years old can be considered\nequivalent to a longitudinal survey that follows a sample of participants,\nall (a) years of age for n years. Likewise, such a cross-sectional survey is\nconceptually also equivalent to a longitudinal survey with two waves of\n*Corresponding author: Xinguang Chen, MD, PhD, Professor, Pediatric\nPrevention Research Center/Department of Pediatrics, Wayne State University\nSchool of Medicine, 4707 St. Antoine Street, Hutzel W534, Detroit, Michigan\nCitation: Chen X, Lin F (2012) Estimating Transitional Probabilities with Cross-\nSectional Data to Assess Smoking Behavior Progression: A Validation Analysis.
