The factors responsible for these relationships, how-\never, remain unknown. Conceptual models are lacking, and\nempirical studies are constrained by the dominance of\nindicators of socioeconomic status, largely poverty rates.\nAlthough there is evidence that associations between neigh-\nborhood attributes and health are particularly strong among\nadults of retirement age (Robert & Li, 2001), it is not clear\nwhich neighborhood features are most likely to influence\nhealth. The analyses that follow have three goals: (a) to de-\nvelop a multidimensional conceptual model of neighbor-\nhood characteristics salient to the health of older people, (b)\nto empirically test the robustness of the model using data\ngathered from readily accessible secondary sources, and (c)\nto relate population-level disability experienced by older\npeople to neighborhood characteristics.\nDespite pleas encouraging investigators to hypothesize\nabout the features of place that influence health and the\nmechanisms by which they do so (Curtis & Jones, 1998;\nO'Campo, 2003), there has been little theory guiding neigh-\nborhood analyses. This applies to the choice of variables\nstudied, definition of geographic areas, and interpretation\nof findings (Mitchell, Gleave, Bartley, Wiggins, & Joshi,\n2000). Because inductive logic and post hoc speculation\nrather than deductive logic and theoretical propositions\nhave guided science (Frohlich et al., 2007), place has typi-\ncally been relegated to the residual part of the \"black box\"\nleft once other variables are controlled (Macintyre, Ellaway, &\nIn conjunction with lack of theory, the proclivity to define\nneighborhoods as a function of socioeconomic status has\nlimited understanding of the mechanisms by which neigh-\nborhoods affect health. The almost exclusive reliance on\nvariables readily available in the U.S. Census, including\nrates of poverty, economic deprivation, and education,\nexplains neither how nor why neighborhood influences\nhealth. Moreover, the tendency for studies to operationalize\nneighborhoods as a function of single variables has made it\nvirtually impossible to understand how one attribute relates\nto another (Stafford et al., 2007). Although useful for\nfirst-generation studies, these practices have hindered\n\"unpacking\" the specific exposures and pathways through\nwhich neighborhood disadvantage affects health (Kawachi &\nA Conceptual Framework of Neighborhoods\nSpeculation regarding the components of neighborhoods\nlikely to affect the health of older adults has centered pri-\nmarily on compositional and contextual factors (Cummins,\nMacintyre, Davidson, & Ellaway, 2005, Curtis & Jones,\nThe Texture of Neighborhoods and Disability Among\nOlder Adults\nRachel A.

To present and test an ecological multidimensional model of neighborhood characteristics and examine its\nrelationship to older disability among older adults.\nMethod. Indicators of social vulnerability, wealth, violence, storefronts, residential stability, and the presence of phy-\nsicians, supermarkets, and fast-food establishments for 1,644 of New Jersey's census tracts were derived from sources\nthat include the U.S. Census 2000, Uniform Crime Report for New Jersey, New Jersey Department of Agriculture, Divi-\nsion of Marketing and Development, New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety Division of Alcohol Beverage\nControl, and Health Resources and Services Administration Geospatial Data Warehouse. Confirmatory factor analyses\nwere used to develop and test a measurement model of neighborhood texture. Structural equation modeling examined the\nrelationships between neighborhood characteristics and disability of persons aged 65\u00ad69 years.\nResults. Analyses revealed that distinct dimensions of neighborhoods could be modeled with administrative data and\nthat neighborhood contextual (supermarkets, physicians, storefronts, violence) and compositional (social vulnerability,\nwealth, residential stability) characteristics were related to the prevalence of disability.\nDiscussion. The use of multiple indicators of neighborhood with good psychometric qualities is critical for advancing\nknowledge about the mechanisms by which neighborhood characteristics are associated with the health of older people.\nKey Words: Environment--Models--Neighborhood--Psychometrics--Residence characteristics--Theoretical.\nteristics are the features of people living in a particular\nlocale (e.g., level of education, poverty, wealth); contextual\ncomponents are the built and nonbuilt aspects of a given\ngeographic area (e.g., amount of air pollution, number of\nbars, libraries). Although debate regarding the saliency of\nthese effects has been heated (Macintyre et al., 1993;\nSloggett & Joshi, 1994), the multidimensional nature of\necological effects has been acknowledged, and a push\ntoward understanding how features of place, separately, and\nin conjunction with one another, influence health advanced.\nLacking, however, are comprehensive conceptual models\nand empirical studies of how neighborhood characteristics\nrelate to one another and how they in turn come to influence\nhealth.\nBuilding on work by Bernard and colleagues (2007), we\nconceptualize neighborhoods through the lens of differ-\nences in the distribution of resources. The concept of place\nas a unique system of resources and social relationships\nembedded within geographic borders was described by\nCurtis and Jones (1998) and expanded by Macintyre and\ncolleagues (Macintyre & Ellaway, 2003; Macintyre et al.,\n2002). Borrowing from these scholars, we posit that spatially\npatterned health inequalities are rooted not only in resources\nper se but also in an unequal distribution of positive and\nnegative resources. The presence of positive resources in a\nneighborhood should promote health, whereas negative\nresources should undermine it. We caution that although a\nhost of neighborhood characteristics can be identified, we\nlimited our conceptual thinking to those readily available in\nexisting secondary data sources.\nWe propose that positive contextual resources of neigh-\nborhoods likely to promote the health of older adults\ninclude the presence of supermarkets and the availability of\nphysicians. Supermarkets sell a wide variety of high-quality\nproducts at low cost (Zenk et al., 2006), and studies have\nconsistently found that residents with better access to super-\nmarkets have healthier food intake and less risk of obesity\n(Larson, Story, & Nelson, 2009). Similarly, research has\nindicated that physical proximity to physicians or medical\nfacilities is associated with utilization of healthcare resources\nIn contrast, negative contextual resources including bars,\nconvenience stores, small groceries, fast-food restaurants,\nand violent crime present significant health challenges.\nStockdale and colleagues (2007) demonstrated that alcohol\navailability was associated with community disorder. Zenk\nand colleagues (2006) observed that convenience stores and\nsmall groceries or bodegas offer prepared, high-calorie\nfoods and little fresh produce at high prices, thereby pro-\nmoting poor health. Similarly, the presence of fast-food res-\ntaurants that sell food high in fat, sodium, and sugar is likely\nto have a negative impact on health (Mehta & Chang, 2008;\nMorland & Evenson, 2009; Morland, Wing, Diez-Roux, &\nPoole, 2002). Neighborhoods characterized by high rates of\ncrime affect health by increasing the risk of victimization\nand the perception of neighborhood danger (Stockdale\net al., 2007), which in turn may make people curtail outdoor\nactivities, thereby isolating themselves.\nThe contextual resources of place alone do not define\nneighborhoods; rather the resources of a neighborhood are\nalso determined by the composition of the people who live\nwithin them. Positively valenced composition resources\ninclude affluence and high levels of residential stability,\nwhereas negatively valenced composition is evidenced by\nhigh levels of social vulnerability.\nThere is consistent evidence that persons living in neigh-\nborhoods characterized by high levels of social vulnera-\nbility, including high rates of female-headed households,\nhouseholds on public assistance, and unemployed men,\nhave poor health (Kawachi & Berkman, 2003; Yen,\nMichael, & Perdue, 2009). Neighborhood affluence (higher\neducational attainment, higher levels in earned income), on\nthe other hand, exposes residents to higher proportions of\nneighbors who are likely to be well-educated and have the\neconomic resources to be health-savvy. Positing that neigh-\nborhood affluence is more than merely the converse of\nneighborhood disadvantage, Browning and Cagney (2003)\nfound that indicators of neighborhood affluence, but not\nthose representing neighborhood disadvantage, were signif-\nicantly associated with health in the United States. Finally,\nsocial disorganization theory suggests that residential sta-\nbility fosters the development of trusting relationships and\nstrong ties with neighbors (Sampson, Morenoff, & Gannon-\nOur conceptual model posits that the contextual and com-\npositional resources of neighborhoods are related to one\nanother, both are important, and their association with\nhealth is complex. For example, neighborhoods character-\nized by low socioeconomic status may also have higher\nlevels of air pollution exposure and higher mortality (Jerrett,\nBuzzelli, Burnett, & DeLuca, 2005). These same neighbor-\nhoods, however, may offer services not available elsewhere,\nas some of the best-quality hospitals in Boston, New York,\nPhiladelphia, and Los Angeles are located in neighborhoods\ncharacterized by poverty, small groceries, and violent crime.\nThis paper seeks to expand thinking about the specific, mea-\nsurable neighborhood characteristics that may be responsi-\nble for the consistent relationships that research has\nidentified between neighborhoods and health (Balfour &\n2003). Although our model does not attempt to explain the\nunderlying rationale for why neighborhood characteristics\ninfluence health, it does lay the critical groundwork for\nconceptualizing neighborhoods as having complex textures,\nmoving science beyond its almost exclusive focus on\npoverty.\nIn the analyses that follow, we use multiple indicators of\ncontextual and compositional resources to determine how\nthese aspects of neighborhoods relate to one another. We\nposit that (a) the number of primary care physicians and the\nnumber of specialists will be correlated and together will\nrepresent the construct \"availability of physicians\"; (b) the\nyear the householder moved in and percentage of house-\nholds having the same occupants for five or more years will\nbe correlated and together will represent the construct \"res-\nidential stability\"; (c) The number of robberies, rapes, and\naggravated assaults in a tract will be correlated and together\nwill represent the construct \"violence\"; (d) The percentage\nof female-headed households, households on public assis-\ntance, and unemployed men will be correlated and together\nwill represent the construct \"social vulnerability\"; (e) The\npercentage of persons with a college degree, percentage of\npersons with a professional occupation, and number of\ncorrelated and will represent the construct \"wealth\"; and\n(f) The number of bars/pubs, grocery stores, and convenience\nstores in a tract will be correlated and together represent\nthe construct \"Storefronts.\" In addition, we posit that these\ncharacteristics as well as supermarkets and fast-food estab-\nlishments (each single-item indicators) will have signifi-\ncant, but moderate, correlations with one another.\nThe Relationship Between Neighborhoods and Disability\nStudies examining neighborhood effects on disability\nhave found regional variation in late-life disability, with\npersons in the South experiencing the highest disability\nprevalence and those in the West the lowest (Lin, 2000).\nPersons living in impoverished neighborhoods have higher\nlevels of disability than those living in privileged neighbor-\nhoods (Balfour & Kaplan, 2002; Freedman, Grafova,\ndential instability and street characteristics (in addition to\nlow neighborhood socioeconomic status) were associated\nwith higher prevalence of physical disability.\nBased on this literature, we hypothesize that neighbor-\nhood characteristics will have differential associations\nwith disability. More specifically, we propose that contex-\ntual influences such as supermarkets and physicians will be\nassociated with lower rates of disability, whereas neighbor-\nhoods characterized by more storefronts, more fast-food\nestablishments, and higher levels of violence will have\nhigher levels of disability. Composition influences will also\nbe associated with disability, as disability will be higher in\nneighborhoods characterized by social vulnerability and\nlower in neighborhoods characterized by affluence and\nresidential stability.\nMethod\nAlthough the overwhelming majority of studies examin-\ning the effects of neighborhoods on health have relied\nalmost exclusively on census data, our research pushes new\nboundaries as we garnered data from multiple administra-\ntive sources to characterize neighborhoods. Building on a\ndata panel of 5,688 people (ORANJ BOWL, Ongoing\nResearch on Aging in New Jersey: Better Opportunities for\nWellness in Life, Pruchno, Wilson-Genderson, & Cartwright,\ncensus tracts in which participants lived. New Jersey census\nnot explicitly use data collected as part of the ORANJ\nBOWL panel, we capitalized on the availability of detailed\ncensus tract data for these geographic locations. As such,\nthe analyses reported here are ecological. Preliminary anal-\nyses revealed that there were no significant differences\nbetween the tracts included in our analyses and the totality\nof New Jersey's tracts on any variable included in our\nmodel, suggesting that our sample of tracts accurately rep-\nresented the state of New Jersey.\nData Sources and Measures\nMeasures of residential stability, social vulnerability, and\nwealth were from the 2000 U.S. Census. The Uniform\nCrime Report prepared by the State of New Jersey, Division\nof State Police Uniform Crime Reporting Unit for the year\nInformation regarding the number of supermarkets, grocery\nstores, local convenience stores, and fast-food restaurants\ncame from the New Jersey Department ofAgriculture, Divi-\nsion of Marketing and Development, authorized by the Milk\nControl Act State of New Jersey. We obtained a list of the\nnames of all 12,183 outlets with licenses to distribute milk\nin New Jersey and following Morland and colleagues (2002)\nused a modification of the 2007 North America Industry\nClassification codes to categorize each establishment as\nsupermarket, grocery store, chain convenience store, local\nconvenience store, gasoline station with convenience store,\nwarehouse club, fruit and vegetable market, pharmacy, full\nservice restaurant, fast-food restaurant, and snack shop.\nInterrater reliability of .85 was established and maintained\nby three coders.\nThe number of bars and pubs in each tract were abstracted\nfrom the New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety\nDivision of Alcohol Beverage Control. We obtained a list of\nthe names and addresses of 9,261 establishments with alco-\nhol retail licenses and coded each establishment as liquor\nstore, restaurant, bar/pub/tavern, motel/hotel, social club, or\ncombination bar\u00adgrill/restaurant\u00adbar. Coders established\nand maintained interrater reliability of .85. The number of\nprimary care physicians and the number of specialist physi-\ncians in each zip code were downloaded from the Health\nResources and Services Administration Geospatial Data\nWarehouse, 2006 edition (http://datawarehouse.hrsa.gov/\nHPSADownload.aspx, accessed Nov. 8, 2011). Although it\nmay be optimal to use indicators at a uniform level of geo-\ngraphic aggregation, research has shown little difference in\nestimates when using zip code compared with tract-level\nTable 1 provides information about the neighborhood\nconstructs and the variables used to represent each. Many\nneighborhood characteristics are not evenly distributed in\nthe community causing the variables representing them to\nlikewise have uneven and wide-ranging distributions.\nRecodes were used to reduce the impact of heterogeneity of\nvariances while still preserving substantive interpretability\nof the variables.\nOur index of disability, from the 2000 Census, repre-\nsented the percentage of persons aged 65\u00ad69 years in each\ncensus tract with a disability of any kind (sensory, physical,\nmental, self-care, and those prohibiting a person from going\noutside their home). We focused on this age band as it most\nclosely represents persons described by Robert and Li\n(2001) likely to be affected by neighborhood characteristics.\nBasing their work on that of Lawton (1977) and Lawton\nand Nahemow (1973), Robert and Li suggest two possible\nexplanations for why environment may have its strongest\nimpact on people of this age: (a) the higher mobility in\nyounger people compared with older people exposes them\nto a multitude of \"suprapersonal environments\" (work, home,\nrecreational activities); because older people spend more\ntime in their neighborhoods, the neighborhoods have the\npotential to have greater effects on their behavior and (b) the\nmost demanding community environments are particularly\nsalient to people with compromised cognitive, psychological,\nor physical competence. Census tracts varied in the percent-\nAnalytic Strategies\nAn ecological study, the unit of analysis employed in all\nanalyses that follow was the census tract. In order to mini-\nmize the likelihood of overfitting the model, the 3-phased\nmodeling procedures recommended by Horn and McArdle\n(1980) were followed. The first two phases, model evalua-\ntion and model readjustment, were carried out using a ran-\ndomly selected sample of 822 of the census tracts. Data\nfrom the remaining 822 tracts were used for purposes of the\nthird phase of model testing, model replication. Consistent\nwith guidelines suggested by Gagne and Hancock (2006),\nsamples of this size enable model convergence and provide\nthe basis for accurately estimating parameters. Descriptive\ndata regarding the measures are presented for all tracts, as\nt tests contrasting the samples revealed statistically signifi-\ncant differences on only two variables that are, most likely,\na function of chance.\nConfirmatory factor analyses with maximum likelihood\nestimation used AMOS 18.0 inputting raw data using SPSS\n(Version 18.0). Model fit was evaluated using the Tucker\u00ad\nLewis coefficient (TLI). The chi-square difference test com-\npared nested models in the exploratory phase (Byrne, 2001).\nTable 1.

Analyses imposed sequentially more\nstringent constraints on the equality of the model fit.\nFollowing the procedures suggested by Brown (2006), the\nfollowing nested models were tested: (a) an unconstrained\nmodel (two groups fitted separately, no equality constraints\nimposed), (b) a measurement weights model (measurement\nweights, regression weights, factor loadings constrained to\nbe equal), (c) a measurement intercept model (measure-\nment intercepts or means constrained to be equal), (d)\nstructural weight model, (e) structural covariance model\n(covariances between latent constructs constrained to be\nequal), (f) structural residual model (latent construct error\nvariances constrained to be equal), and (g) measurement\nresidual model (remaining error variances constrained to be\nequal). Because of the large sample size, differences signifi-\ncant at the P < .01 level were interpreted as significant.\nRelationships between disability and neighborhood char-\nacteristics were examined by adding covariances between\ndisability and each neighborhood construct to the measure-\nment model. These analyses were based on data from all\n1,644 tracts and were developed using structural equation\nResults\nTable 2 includes bivariate correlations among all model\nvariables for Sample 1 (lower diagonal) and Sample 2\n(upper diagonal). As expected, the correlations of variables\nwithin factors were consistently higher than those between\nfactors (e.g., the correlations between the number of rapes,\nrobberies, and aggravated assaults and indicators of vio-\nlence are higher than those between these variables and any\nof the other model variables). The sole exception was the\nrelationship between variables representing social vulnera-\nbility and wealth where the magnitude of inverse correla-\ntions between factors was similar to that within each factor.\nThe hypothesized model yielded a very good fit (c2 =\nnonsignificant covariates were deleted from the model in\nsequential order: (a) residential stability and fast food, (b)\nresidential stability and supermarkets, (c) social vulnerability\nand availability of physicians, and (d) residential stability\nand availability of physicians.

The measurement model finds that the\nstandardized estimates of the indicators for each construct\n(physician availability, residential stability, violence, social\nvulnerability, wealth, and storefronts) had magnitudes of at\nleast .70, suggesting adequate representation of all con-\nstructs. The standardized covariance estimates (correla-\ntions) among the constructs were all statistically significant,\nranging from -.14 (supermarkets and social vulnerability)\nto -.88 (social vulnerability and wealth). The majority of\nResults from CFA analyses (available from the author)\nindicated that measurement weights, intercepts, structural\nmeans, structural covariances, and measurement residuals\nfor the two samples were not statistically different from one\nanother.\nchange in the parameters of the measurement model and\nrevealed that disability was significantly associated with\nneighborhood characteristics. As depicted in Figure 1, con-\ntextual characteristics, including supermarkets and avail-\nability of physicians, were associated with lower levels of\ndisability, whereas storefronts and violence were associated\nwith higher levels of disability. There was no relationship\nbetween fast-food establishments and disability. Composi-\ntional characteristics were also related to disability, as social\nvulnerability was associated with higher levels of disability,\nwhereas wealth and residential stability were associated\nwith lower levels of disability.\nDiscussion\nOur analyses demonstrated that there are distinct compo-\nsitional and contextual dimensions of neighborhoods that\ncan be modeled using data derived from a variety of readily\navailable databases and that these characteristics have dif-\nferential associations with disability. Building on work by\nusing administrative data in conjunction with deductive theory,\nour work suggests that creative use of these resources has\nthe potential to yield important new information.\nThe relationships among neighborhood attributes high-\nlight the complexities that characterize neighborhoods. The\nvery strong relationships between some of these constructs\n(e.g., social vulnerability and wealth; violence and store-\nfronts; social vulnerability and storefronts) raise questions\nabout whether these factors represent unique concepts or\nare better conceptualized as manifestations of a broader\nmetaconstruct. On the other hand, some of the more modest\nrelationships (e.g., supermarkets and violence, social vul-\nnerability, wealth, storefronts; fast-food restaurants and vio-\nlence, social vulnerability, wealth) highlight the importance\nof measuring multidimensional aspects of neighborhoods in\norder to understand them. In all, our findings suggest that\nthe compositional measures typically used to define neigh-\nborhoods tell only part of the story and that to be fully\nunderstood, neighborhoods should be defined and analyzed\nusing both compositional and contextual characteristics.\nOur findings regarding the complex relationships\nbetween neighborhood characteristics and disability are in\nline with those reported by others (Balfour & Kaplan, 2002;\ning the characteristics of neighborhoods most likely to in-\nfluence disability. Our findings speak to the differential\nimportance that contextual characteristics can have, as the\nrelationships between disability and both violence and\nstorefronts were much stronger than those between disabil-\nity and availability of physicians, supermarkets, and fast-\nfood restaurants. By acknowledging that neighborhoods can\nbe defined by a host of characteristics and identifying how\neach of them differentially affect health, future research can\noffer more useful opportunities for interventions and public\npolicy change.\nAs with all research, this study has its limitations. The\nnature of the ecological secondary data available limited the\ndimensions of neighborhoods that could be studied, and our\nreliance on data from one state begs for future work in other\ngeographic locations. Defining neighborhoods based on\ncensus tracts may not be optimal, as the boundaries of these\nareas are typically unnoticed by its residents. Future studies\nhaving access to specific information regarding the spatial\ncoordinates of neighborhood amenities will provide critical\ninformation. The advent of sophisticated technologies such\nas geographic information systems (Cromley & McLafferty,\n2002) and hierarchical geostatistical modeling (Chaix et al.,\n2006) that rely less on artificially imposed neighborhood\nboundaries and take into account characteristics of proxi-\nmate neighborhoods provides even greater preciseness to\nthe developing science relating place to health. Although\nevidence exists that the data we used were reliable and\nvalid, they were collected for purposes other than research;\nhence, some caution regarding their accuracy is suggested.\nMoreover, our analyses, including some variables in num-\nber format and others in proportion format raise questions\nFigure 1. Correlations between neighborhood characteristics and disability (N = 1,644; *p = .05, **p = .01)\nregarding the influence of tract size. Future studies using\nstandardized data will help alleviate these concerns.\nThere are also important limitations regarding our analy-\nses of the relationship between neighborhood characteristics\nand disability. As the data we analyzed are cross-sectional,\nwe cannot address the issue of causality. Future studies with\nthe ability to analyze both people and neighborhoods over\ntime are needed. Caution is in order regarding the indicator\nof disability used in these analyses. As a heterogeneous\nmeasure, it included home-bound persons, potentially con-\nfounding our analyses which presume exposure to outdoor\ncontextual factors. Moreover, findings regarding the rela-\ntionship between neighborhood characteristics and disabil-\nity may not be generalizable to other age groups. Studies\nexamining the extent to which different age groups are\ninfluenced by neighborhood characteristics and those exam-\nining different dimensions of both physical and mental\nhealth will help to target limited health care resources.\nAlthough our conceptual model broadens the definition\nof neighborhood, it does not, by any means, fully define it.\nConceptually, we limited attention to constructs with mea-\nsures that are widely available in secondary sources. As\nsuch, we were able to provide new information about how\nwhat neighborhood texture includes and how it relates to a\nsingle dimension of health. Research focusing on other\nobjective resources (e.g., existence of parks, schools, public\ntransportation, adequate street lighting, walkable sidewalks,\nand presence of pollution) as well as subjective resources\nthat require assessments by individuals living in neighbor-\nhoods (e.g., perceived safety, social cohesion, and social\ncapital; Weden, Carpiano, & Robert, 2008) complementing\nthe characteristics included in our model is needed to foster\na more comprehensive understanding of the salient dimen-\nsions of neighborhoods and the mechanisms by which\nneighborhoods influence health. We hope that our work\nencourages others to use existing administrative data to better\nunderstand the textures of the neighborhoods that they\nstudy. Similarly, although our analyses focused on the main\neffects of neighborhoods on disability, future work examin-\ning the interactive neighborhood effects will be important.\nMujahid, Diex-Roux, Morenoff, and Raghunathan (2007,\np. 866) suggested that \"the assessment of ecological\nsettings remains in its infancy.\" Improving the validity and\nreliability of measures of neighborhood characteristics\nusing strategies such as those described here is a critical\nfirst step.\n"
