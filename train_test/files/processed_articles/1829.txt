Although an elevated ADHD prevalence is plau-\nsible in lower-income populations because of their higher\nrates of putative ADHD risk factors such as low birth\nweight,36 lead exposure,37 and in utero tobacco expo-\nsure,38 national studies have not observed a difference in\nrates by income9 or have identified income-related dif-\nferences among boys but not girls.5 However, because\nthese studies relied on caregiver report of an ADHD di-\nagnosis, the findings may reflect differential access to\nhealth care or diagnostic bias. Results from US regional\nstudies using DSM-III, DSM-III-R, and DSM-IV criteria to\nstudy ADHD rates in different income groups have var-\nied, with 2 documenting an elevated ADHD prevalence\nin lower-income children and 1 finding no differ-\ngroups have also been inconsistent. The US national stud-\nies have shown lower rates of reported ADHD diagnoses\nin children from minority backgrounds,7,9 but 2 re-\ngional studies found no difference in DSM-based ADHD\nrates in non-Hispanic white and African American chil-\ndren.21,30 Little information is available about DSM-\nbased rates of ADHD in Mexican American children,27,39\none of the fasting growing sectors of the US population.\nThere is also broad public concern about rates of psy-\nchostimulant use for ADHD,40 yet these concerns are dif-\nficult to evaluate because most studies have not bench-\nmarked the appropriateness of medication treatment\nnational studies have documented lower rates of ADHD\nmedication use in uninsured children, African Ameri-\ncan children, and Hispanic children but no difference in\nuse by income.3,5,41 However, because these studies ex-\namined psychostimulant use without information about\nADHD symptoms and impairment, it is unclear whether\ndifferences in medication use signify undertreatment in\nspecific groups.\nThe purpose of this study was to examine ADHD preva-\nlence in a national population-based sample of US chil-\ndren assessed with a DSM-IV\u00adbased diagnostic instru-\nment.

A total of 3907 children\nwith data regarding DSM-IV ADHD diagnostic status available\ndren lacked DSM-IV ADHD data because they did not com-\nplete a previously required survey component at the NHANES\nmobile examination center, and caregivers of another 10% could\nnot be located for the ADHD interview, refused, or had a pri-\nmary language other than English or Spanish. Those with\nDSM-IV ADHD information did not differ from those without\nin terms of sex (P=.84), report of prior ADHD diagnosis (P=.93),\nor health insurance status (P=.45). However, those lacking\nDSM-IV ADHD data were significantly more likely to be younger\n(mean age, 9.9 years vs 12.1 years), poorer (lowest income quin-\nOUTCOMES\nThe National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview\nSchedule for Children\u00adIV (DISC-IV), a structured diagnostic\ninterview instrument designed for use in epidemiologic stud-\nies, was used to assess the presence of ADHD based on DSM-IV\ncriteria. This study used the ADHD DISC caregiver module,\nwhich has evidence of substantial validity,43 reliability for both\nits English43 and Spanish44,45 versions, and successful use with\nthe telephone in the DSM-IV field trials.32 Caregivers com-\npleted the DISC telephone interview 2 to 4 weeks after the child's\nNHANES mobile examination center evaluation, providing in-\nformation about the child's ADHD symptoms, age at onset, symp-\ntom pervasiveness, and related impairments during the prior\n12 months. The DISC algorithms determine ADHD diagnostic\nstatus and ascertain ADHD subtype (ADHD-IA, ADHD-CT, and\nhyperactive-impulsive type [ADHD-HI]). In addition, ques-\ntions on the DISC inquire about use of \"medicine for being over-\nactive, being hyperactive, or having trouble paying attention\"\nin the past 12 months and whether medication was taken \"most\nof the time during the last year\" (ie, consistent medication treat-\nment) (D.

The PIR is the ratio of the re-\nported household income to the poverty threshold appropri-\nate for household size. To capture the distribution across the\nUS population, the PIR was categorized into quintiles. Child\nrace/ethnicity was designated by caregivers and included the\nfollowing categories: non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,\nother Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, and other (including mul-\ntiracial). Because of the small number of subjects in the \"other\nHispanic\" and \"other (including multiracial)\" groups (n=115\nand n=107, respectively), they were combined into a single\n\"other race/ethnicity\" category.\nANALYSES\nTo account for the complex survey design, sample weights and\ndesign variables were applied according to National Center for\nHealth Statistics guidelines to generate all estimates. These\nsample weights were calculated from the base probabilities of\nselection, adjusted for nonresponse, and poststratified to match\npopulation control totals. Analyses were performed using SAS\nstatistical software, version 9 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North\nCarolina), procedures for analysis of complex surveys.\nDescriptive statistics on the national prevalence of ADHD\nand ADHD subtypes are given for the sample overall and across\n\u00a92007 American Medical Association.

For children meet-\ning DSM-IV ADHD criteria, rates of caregiver-reported diag-\nnoses (ie, prior disorder recognition) and medication treat-\nment are also summarized overall and across demographic\ngroupings. We used 2 tests to assess bivariate associations be-\ntween the demographic predictor variables and ADHD diag-\nnostic status, prior disorder recognition, and treatment status.\nTo adjust for the effects of the demographic variables on ADHD\nstatus, prior disorder recognition, and history of ADHD treat-\nment, multivariable logistic regression was performed with in-\ncome, race/ethnicity, age, and sex included as predictors. In ad-\ndition, for models predicting prior disorder recognition and\nhistory of ADHD treatment, health insurance status and ADHD\nsubtype were included to account for differential access to care\nand the potential bias toward diagnosing and treating chil-\ndren with more externalizing behaviors.\nThe institutional review board of Cincinnati Children's Hos-\npital Medical Center determined this study to be exempt from\nits review.\nRESULTS\nfidence interval [CI], 7.3%-10.1%) met DSM-IV criteria\nfor ADHD in the year prior to the survey, equivalent to\n2.4 million children in the United States (Table 1).

Despite rising public awareness of\nADHD, less than half of children who met DSM-IV ADHD\ncriteria had reportedly had their conditions diagnosed by\na health care professional or been treated with medica-\ntions.

In this sample,\nADHD-IA was the most common ADHD subtype, a find-\ning that concurs with 2 US regional and 2 international\nbut is in contrast to the results of 1 US regional30 and 2\ninternational population-based investigations.34,35 Pos-\nsible reasons for differences include parents' varying cul-\ntural expectations of behavioral norms or changes in\nmedia coverage increasing awareness of inattentive\nsymptoms. The distribution of ADHD etiologic factors\nmay also have varied, leading to true differences in sub-\ntype predominance.\nThe nation's poorest children had an increased likelihood\nof meeting DSM-IV ADHD criteria. This is consistent with\nthe findings of 2 US regional population-based studies that\nused DSM-III-R criteria for outcome assessment.21,24 In ad-\ndition, we found higher rates of ADHD-HI in lower-\nincome children, supporting the results of a prior clinical\nreferral sample in which socioeconomic status was lowest\nfor patients with ADHD-HI and highest for for those with\nADHD-IA.31 Because the findings of these DSM-based in-\nvestigations were in regional, predominately non-\nHispanic white communities or clinically referred samples,\nour nationally representative study improves understand-\ning of the ADHD burden facing poor children across the\nUnitedStates.ReasonsfortheincreasedlikelihoodofADHD\nin poorer children may include the elevated prevalence of\nADHD risk factors (ie, premature birth36 and in utero38 or\nchildhood exposures to toxic substances37) in this group.\nIn addition, given the high heritability of ADHD48 and its\nnegative impact on social, academic, and career out-\ncomes,49 it is plausible that families with ADHD may clus-\nter within the lower socioeconomic strata.\nInaccordancewith2DSM-basedinvestigations,weob-\nserved no significant difference in overall ADHD rates be-\ntweennon-HispanicwhitechildrenandAfricanAfricans,21,30\nalthough African Americans had lower rates of ADHD-IA.\nWe also found that Mexican American children had half\nthe likelihood of meeting DSM-IV criteria for any type of\nADHDcomparedwithnon-Hispanicwhitechildren.Given\nthe paucity of prior data, it is difficult to speculate on rea-\nsonsforthelowerADHDrateobservedinMexicanAmeri-\ncanchildren.Ourfindingsmaybeduetodifferencesinthe\nprevalenceofcausalriskfactors,geneticsusceptibility,and/\nor rates of reporting ADHD symptoms across cultures.29\nWefoundthat48%ofchildrenmeetingDSM-IVADHDcri-\nteria had reportedly been diagnosed as having ADHD by a\nhealth care professional.

To our knowl-\nedge, only a few prior population-based studies, con-\nreported on treatment received by children with ADHD\nusing a DSM-diagnosed sample. Rates of ADHD medica-\ntion treatment among those meeting DSM-IV ADHD cri-\nteriawerehigherinourstudythanthoseobservedbyJensen\nlower than rates documented by Angold et al (72% for any\nuse during a 4-year period).28 These differences may be\ndue to variations in regional prescribing practices or to dif-\nfering time frames for outcome assessment.\nAlthough prior national studies found no disparity in\nmedication treatment rates by income,3,41 we found that\namong children fulfilling DSM-IV ADHD criteria, the\npoorest children were 3 to 5 times less likely to receive\nconsistent medication treatment compared with other\nincome groups. In a prior regional study using a DSM-III-\nR\u00adbased assessment for ADHD, income-related differ-\nences were not observed for the likelihood of any ADHD\npharmacotherapy during a multiyear span.28 However,\nbecause the prior study did not comment on the duration\nand regularity of medication treatment by subgroup, a\ncomparison is not available for our findings regarding\nconsistent ADHD medication treatment. Although prior\nnational studies found that racial/ethnic minority popu-\nlations are less likely to use ADHD medications com-\npared with non-Hispanic white children,3,5 we found no\nsignificant racial/ethnic group differences in the likeli-\nhood of pharmacotherapy among those with DSM-IV\u00ad\ndefined ADHD.\nLIMITATIONS\nOne limitation relates to how the ADHD diagnosis was\nderived for this study. The American Academy of Pedi-\natrics recommends that both caregiver and teacher re-\nports be used to inform a clinical diagnostic evaluation\nfor ADHD.52 However, DSM-IV criteria state simply that\nimpairment must exist in 2 or more settings and do not\nspecifically require 2 reporters.12 The NHANES used only\nthe DISC caregiver module for ADHD assessment, a struc-\ntured diagnostic interview designed for use in large-\nscale epidemiologic surveys.43 Notably, the DISC inter-\nview assesses symptom pervasiveness by asking caregivers\nto report symptoms and impairment at home and at school\nor other activities.12 To our knowledge, no prior US popu-\nlation-based studies using DSM-IV ADHD criteria have\ngathered clinical data from both caregivers and teach-\nand different subtype rates may result when reports from\nboth teachers and parents are available.53,54\nAnother potential limitation pertains to the influence\nof cultural behavioral norms on caregiver symptom\nreports, as sociodemographic differences in prevalence\nTable 5.

The\nNHANES' cross-sectional design does not allow us to\ndistinguish those who intially met DSM-IV criteria but\nwhose symptoms were reduced below the threshold by\nmedication from those who were prescribed medication\ninappropriately. Therefore, these 3.3% were not in-\ncluded in our overall ADHD prevalence measurement, a\nfactor that may make our estimate of 8.7% a conserva-\ntive approximation. Missing data could also have\naltered the observed prevalence rates. However, given\nthat the analyses incorporated sample weights account-\ning for differential nonresponse, bias due to this factor\nis minimized. Furthermore, although this study is of\nsubstantial dimension, sample size was still limited for\nsociodemographic subgroup analyses, particularly for\nADHD subtype prevalence.\nFinally, our medication treatment outcome was as-\nsessed via parent report, whereas review of medical or\npharmacy records would have been preferable. In addi-\ntion, although we are able to determine the prevalence\nof reported pharmacotherapy in children with DSM-IV\u00ad\ndefined ADHD and its variation across sociodemo-\ngraphic groups during the year prior to the survey, we\ncannot comment on reasons for the rates or differences\nobserved. Although there are often compelling reasons\nto try stimulant medication treatment in children with\nADHD, including robust data confirming short-term\nsymptom improvement, reduced impairment, and pro-\ntection against future adverse outcomes such as sub-\nstance abuse,56,57 stimulant medications are sometimes\ndiscontinued owing to lack of efficacy or or unaccept-\nable adverse effects.58 Because the NHANES does not con-\ntain information about lifetime ADHD medication treat-\nment, we are unable to differentiate children who never\ntried ADHD medications from those who did not con-\ntinue because of ineffectiveness or adverse effects. Fi-\nnally, although behavioral interventions for ADHD are\nimportant, the NHANES does not contain specific infor-\nmation about nonpharmacologic treatments for atten-\ntional problems.\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe found DSM-IV\u00addiagnosed ADHD to be prevalent in\nAmerican children and more common among the poor-\nest children. Children from minority backgrounds had\nlower rates of ADHD-IA, whereas the poorest children\nhad an increased likelihood of ADHD-HI. If this study is\nreplicated, etiologic factors that may partially explain\nthese differences--such as varying rates of in utero to-\nbacco exposure, childhood lead exposure, and compli-\ncations of pregnancy and delivery--should be investi-\ngated so that future public health efforts can be directed\nat preventing ADHD in groups at highest risk. We also\nobserved that less than half of children who met DSM-IV\ncriteria for ADHD had reportedly had their conditions\ndiagnosed or been treated with ADHD medications, sug-\ngesting that some children with clinically significant in-\nattention and hyperactivity may not be receiving opti-\nmal interventions. Finally, our finding of a lower\nlikelihood of consistent medication use in the poorest chil-\ndren warrants further investigation and possible inter-\nvention to ensure that all children with ADHD have eq-\nuitable access to treatment when appropriate.\nCorrespondence: Tanya E.
