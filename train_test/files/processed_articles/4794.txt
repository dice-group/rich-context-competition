    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which consists of breathing 100% oxygen under a higher atmospheric pres-\nsure than normal, is utilized worldwide in the treatment of several diseases. With the growing demand for evidence-\nbased research, hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been criticized for delivering too little high-quality research, mainly in the\nform of randomized controlled trials. While not always indispensable, the addition of a sham-controlled group to such a\ntrial can contribute to the quality of the research. However, the design of a sham (hyperbaric) treatment is associated\nwith several considerations regarding adequate blinding and the use of pressure and oxygen. This narrative review dis-\ncusses information on the sham profile and the blinding and safety of double-blind trials in hyperbaric medicine, irrespec-\ntive of the indication for treatment.\nMethods: MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL were searched for sham-controlled trials on hyperbaric oxygen therapy.\nThe control treatment was considered sham if patients were blinded to their allocation and treatment took place in a\nhyperbaric chamber, with no restrictions regarding pressurization, oxygen levels or indication. Studies involving children\nor only one session of hyperbaric oxygen were excluded. Information on (the choice of) treatment profile, blinding mea-\nsures, patient's perception regarding allocation and safety issues was extracted from eligible studies.\nResults: A total of 42 eligible trials were included. The main strategies for sham treatment were (1) use of a lower pres-\nsure than that of the hyperbaric oxygen group, while breathing 21% oxygen; (2) use of the same pressure as the hyperba-\nric oxygen group, while breathing an adjusted percentage of oxygen; and (3) use of the same pressure as the hyperbaric\noxygen group, while breathing 21% oxygen. The advantages and disadvantages of each strategy are discussed using the\ninformation provided by the trials.\nConclusion: Based on this review, using a lower pressure than the hyperbaric oxygen group while breathing 21% oxy-\ngen best matches the inertness of the placebo. Although studies show that use of a lower pressure does allow adequate\nblinding, this is associated with more practical issues than with the other strategies. The choice of which sham profile to\nuse requires careful consideration; moreover, to ensure proper performance, a clear and detailed protocol is also\nrequired.\n",

The Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical\nSociety, a nonprofit organization that plays an impor-\ntant role in providing scientific and medical information\nDepartment of Anesthesiology, Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam,\nThe Netherlands\nCorresponding author:\nRob A van Hulst, Department of Anesthesiology, Academic Medical\nEmail: r.a.vanhulst@amc.nl\non hyperbaric medicine, lists 14 indications for HBO\ntherapy. These include late radiation tissue injuries, dia-\nbetic foot ulcers and carbon monoxide poisoning.1\nTreatment for chronic problems (e.g. wound healing)\nusually involves giving daily sessions for several weeks,\nat pressures between 2.0 and 2.5 ATA. These sessions\ncan be given in either a monoplace chamber (in which\nonly one patient is treated per session) or in a multi-\nplace chamber (where several patients are treated simul-\ntaneously, with the possibility of an attendant joining\nthem to supervise treatment). The therapy is generally\nconsidered safe with few complications, with baro-\ntrauma of the ears or sinuses and transient myopia\nbeing the most common.2\nHBO therapy has been controversial from the start.\nFor example, in 1987, Gabb et al.3 stated in Chest that\nHBO was ``... a therapy in search of diseases.'' The cur-\nrently available scientific research is still criticized.\nAlthough the theoretical basis for the use of HBO ther-\napy seems rational, and well-performed studies in\nanimals and humans show positive effects, a large pro-\nportion of the evidence is anecdotal, retrospective,\nuncontrolled and underpowered. The increased appli-\ncation of evidence-based medicine has raised concerns\nabout the overtreatment of patients, possibly causing\nunnecessary risks and higher costs in health\ncare. Despite efforts by the Undersea and Hyperbaric\nMedical Society and (recently) the European\nCommittee for Hyperbaric Medicine to establish recog-\nnized clinical indications, a need still exists for more\nand better research, particularly in the form of rando-\nmized controlled trials.4 Because the outcome of such a\ntrial can be biased by a placebo effect (especially in the\ncase of subjective parameters), a sham treatment for\nthe control group can be a valuable addition.\nHowever, the design of such a trial is associated with\nseveral considerations regarding the sham treatment.\nThe goal of a sham treatment is to ensure that patients\nand investigators are unable to distinguish sham from\nactual HBO therapy (thus filtering out a potential pla-\ncebo effect), while the sham procedure must not have\nany effect on the disease being treated. Because patients\nhave to auto-inflate their ears when pressure is\nincreased in HBO therapy, sham therapy also has to\nuse pressure to create/mimic this experience. However,\nevery increase in pressure has an effect on the partial\npressures of gases, potentially causing the sham treat-\nment to become an active agent.\nThis dilemma, together with considerations regard-\ning practicality, safety and blinding, has resulted in dif-\nferent strategies being used in various trials over the\nyears, each with their own advantages and disadvan-\ntages. The aim of this narrative review is to provide a\nstructured overview of all past randomized controlled\ntrials that included sham (hyperbaric) treatment. The\nmethodology is examined and, if available, the authors'\nconsiderations for the choice and the results of this\nmethodology (regarding treatment profiles, blinding\nand safety) are presented. The findings of this review\nmay help researchers to make a more balanced decision\nregarding the design of their specific trial.\nBeing a narrative review on the methodology of\ntrials investigating hyperbaric medicine, there is no dis-\ncussion on the indications for which HBO was applied,\nor on the efficacy and/or outcome of each trial.\nMethods\nOur aim was to provide a summary of past studies\ninvolving HBO therapy using a sham treatment. A sys-\ntematic search of the literature was conducted using the\nfollowing protocol.\nEligibility criteria\nIncluded were all studies comparing actual HBO ther-\napy with sham treatment, irrespective of the indication\nfor treatment. It was expected that most of these stud-\nies would be randomized, but if any non-randomized\ncontrolled trial were encountered, these were also con-\nsidered for inclusion. The control treatment was con-\nsidered sham if no additional therapeutic effect to\nstandard care was intended, and patients were blinded\nto their allocation. The minimum criterion for the\nblinding of patients was that the patients were located\nin a hyperbaric chamber (either monoplace or multi-\nplace) during sham treatment; no restrictions were\nmade regarding pressure or oxygen levels. Studies that\ndid not meet this criteria (e.g. if patients were allowed\nto choose their own allocation, or if they received a gas\nmixture in a normal room) were excluded. Studies on\nchildren were excluded, because their treatment regi-\nmens (generally using a lower pressure) and blinding\nmeasures can differ from those applied in adults.\nStudies with only one session of HBO were also\nexcluded, because that treatment regimen is dissimilar\nto a typical hyperbaric treatment which (generally) con-\nsists of multiple sessions, often administered over sev-\neral weeks.\nDatabase search\nMEDLINE via PubMed, Embase via Ovid and the\nCochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were\nsearched (up to April 2017) for sham-controlled studies\non hyperbaric medicine. Medical subject heading\n(MeSH and Emtree) terms were used, in combination\nwith keywords. Searches were limited to randomized\ncontrolled trials and trials including human adults and\npublished in English. Details of the search strategies\nare presented in Appendix 1.\nOther sources\nThe reference lists of the included studies and identified\n(systematic) reviews were screened to identify additional\neligible studies. Also, the Database of Randomized\nControlled Trials in Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine\nwas searched by hand for articles on HBO.\nData collection\nData collection was performed by the first author\n(N.C.A.L.). Abstracts were screened for eligibility fol-\nlowing the criteria mentioned above. After screening,\ninformation on the study sample, and on the sham and\nHBO profile (pressure, time, oxygen levels), was\nextracted from the full-text article.\nThe full text was also searched for considerations\nregarding the choice for a certain sham treatment pro-\nfile, for information on blinding procedures and for the\nuse of questionnaires on patients' perceived allocation.\nInformation on the safety of the sham procedure was\nalso collected, including details on any type of\ncomplications.\nResults\nThe search of the databases and other sources yielded\n477 articles. After removal of duplicates (including sep-\narate articles reporting on the same trial) and initial\nscreening, 45 articles remained. After assessing the elig-\nibility based on the full-text articles, 42 studies were\nfinally included in the present review (Figure 1). All of\nthese studies were randomized controlled trials.\nOf the 42 included studies, analysis of the sham pro-\nfiles revealed the use of three main strategies. Presented\nin chronological order as described in the literature,\nthese are (1) use of a lower pressure than the HBO\ngroup, while breathing 21% oxygen; (2) use of the same\npressure as the HBO group, while breathing a mixture\nwith an adjusted percentage of oxygen; and (3) use of\nthe same pressure as the HBO group, while breathing\nThe first strategy was used in 23 studies, with pres-\nsures in the sham group ranging from 1.1 to 1.5 ATA.\nAn overview of these studies including considerations\nfor the choice of profile, blinding measures and compli-\ncations in the sham group as provided in the articles is\npresented in Table 1. The second strategy, using an\nadjusted percentage of oxygen for sham therapy while\nmaintaining the same pressure as the HBO group, was\nused in 11 studies. Adjusted oxygen levels ranged from\n7% to 41%. An overview is provided in Table 2. The\nthird and last strategy (use of the same pressure with\n21% oxygen in the sham group) was used in eight stud-\nies, of which the information is presented in Table 3.\nThe advantages and disadvantages of all three\nstrategies, using the information provided in the arti-\ncles, are discussed separately below.\nDiscussion\nSham treatment using lower pressure than the HBO\ngroup while breathing 21% oxygen\nThe first documented trial that involved patient blind-\ning using a sham treatment was a study performed by\nHart et al.5 in 1974. In that study, patients were exposed\nto either real HBO therapy (at 2.0 ATA) or to a sham\ntherapy consisting of breathing 21% oxygen (i.e. nor-\nmal air) at a considerably lower pressure (1.1 ATA)\nthan the active treatment. The choice for this profile\nwas not explained by the authors.\nThe advantage of using only a slight increase in pres-\nsure is that the partial pressure of oxygen also increases\nonly slightly. Normally, at atmospheric pressure\n(1.0 ATA), 21% of the air consists of oxygen; this is\nequal to a partial pressure of oxygen of 0.21 ATA. If\nthe atmospheric pressure is doubled to 2.0 ATA, the\npartial pressure of oxygen also doubles to 0.42 ATA.\nThis is the equivalent of 42% oxygen under normal cir-\ncumstances (i.e. 1.0 ATA).\nIn the study by Hart et al.,5 21% oxygen was used\nunder a pressure of 1.1 ATA. This is the equivalent of\nbreathing 23% oxygen under atmospheric pressure\nand, therefore, minimizes the effect on the inertness of\nthe placebo. However, some claim that even a slight\nincrease in the partial pressure of oxygen, or the mere\nuse of pressure alone (irrespective of the partial pres-\nsures of the gases), could inflict changes in the body\nand interfere with the realization of an inert placebo.\nAlthough a small number of animal and cell culture\nstudies support this claim, it is debatable whether these\nresults are substantial enough to be used as an argu-\nFollowing the trial by Hart et al.,5 concerns were\nraised about the effectiveness of blinding, given that no\near barotrauma occurred in the sham control group. If\nthe use of 1.1\u00ad1.3 ATA had resulted in patients having\nto equalize their ears, one would also have expected\nmore reports of complications.\nUsing a lower pressure for the sham treatment\ngroup has some practical implications related to blind-\ning. Apart from masking the gas mixture that is being\napplied, care should also be taken to blind the interior/\nexterior of the chamber to prevent gauges or other\ndevices being seen that might indicate the pressure. If\nthe chamber operator or hyperbaric physician is\nunblinded, they should be instructed not to refer to the\npressure used when in close vicinity to the patients and\ninvestigators and to use a percentage of pressure\n(rather than the actual pressure) when communicating\nwith an (inside) chamber attendant. Using a different\npressure also requires a separate daily session,\npreferably scheduled so that the two groups cannot\nmeet and compare experiences. The use of cluster or\nblock randomization can minimize the impact of these\nprecautions on daily practice. Additional practical mea-\nsures used to prevent unblinding in these trials are pre-\nsented in Table 1.\nSham treatment using the same pressure as the\nHBO group while breathing a mixture with an\nadjusted percentage of oxygen\nThe second documented double-blind trial used a dif-\nferent strategy and was performed in 1983 by Fischer\net al.30 In that study, the same pressure was used for\nboth the HBO and the control groups (2.0 ATA). This\nreduced concerns about patients' perception of their\nallocation due to differences in pressure between the\ngroups and made blinding easier because only the\nbreathing mixture was different.\nTo correct for the increase in partial pressure of\noxygen to 0.42 ATA for the control group, the breath-\ning mixture for the control group was lowered in oxy-\ngen content by adding nitrogen. This resulted in a\nmixture of 10% oxygen and 90% nitrogen, allowing\nthe control group to be exposed to about the same\npartial pressure of oxygen as normal (0.2 ATA).\nHowever, an increase in the nitrogen percentage in\nthe breathing mixture also increases the risk for\ndecompression sickness. In decompression sickness,\nnitrogen bubbles are formed inside the body once the\npatient is decompressed, resulting in symptoms rang-\ning from joint pain and rashes to other neurological\nsymptoms such as paresthesia and paresis. To prevent\nthis, after the treatment, the period of time in which\nthe pressure is lowered to normal has to be pro-\nlonged, by stopping once (or multiple times) during\ndecompression; patients in the control group have to\nbreathe 100% oxygen during decompression to get\nrid of any excess nitrogen.\nFigure 1.

The authors of the\nstudy using 100% oxygen during decompression\nacknowledged that the use of this strategy may have\nnegatively influenced the inertness of the placebo, pos-\nsibly decreasing the differences in outcome between the\nWhen blinding measures are limited to the breathing\ngas alone, patients of the two groups can receive treat-\nment during the same session (in case of a multicham-\nber). Separate piping systems for air and oxygen can be\ninstalled relatively easily, as long as the systems are\n(visibly) indistinguishable from one another. To ensure\nthat the appropriate breathing mixture is applied, oxy-\ngen concentration in the mask, or arterial oxygen ten-\nsion, can be measured. For this reason and for other\nsafety reasons (e.g. in case of an evacuation) in most\nstudies, the chamber operator and/or the hyperbaric\nphysician was unblinded. As mentioned, unblinded\nstaff should be instructed not to discuss the topic of\ntreatment gas with the patients or any other study\nparticipants.\nSham treatment using the same pressure as the\nHBO group while breathing 21% oxygen\n2.0 ATA for both groups, with the control group\nbreathing 21% oxygen, instead of correcting the per-\ncentage of oxygen to keep the partial pressure of oxygen\nat 0.21 ATA. As mentioned, this resulted in the control\ngroup breathing the equivalent of 42% oxygen under\natmospheric pressure. In the present review, seven other\ntrials used this same strategy, with a maximal partial\npressure of oxygen of 0.53 ATA. However, it is debata-\nble whether this strategy can be considered to deliver a\ntrue placebo. For example, Greif et al.51 showed that\npatients receiving 80% oxygen during and 2 h after col-\norectal resection had 50% fewer surgical wound infec-\ntions than patients receiving 30% oxygen. The amount\nof oxygen that can be therapeutic is likely to depend on\nthe disease being treated; however, in the absence of\nsufficient evidence regarding the different oxygen frac-\ntions in relation to (patho)physiology, the use of 53%\noxygen for a placebo might be incorrect. Of the 42 stud-\nies in the present review, only two cited previous studies\nthat showed no effect of an increased oxygen partial\npressure on the condition being investigated, to justify\nFedorko et al.27 stated that using a placebo of 21%\noxygen is ``... extreme regarding decompression stress''\nand cited earlier studies reporting the negative effects\n(endothelial injury, proinflammatory changes and sig-\nnificant venous gas emboli) of single, shorter exposures;\nthese authors concluded that using this particular pro-\nfile does not satisfy the criteria for an inert placebo.\nOf the eight trials that used 21% oxygen at the same\npressure as the actual treatment, only three discussed\nthe choice for this sham profile. Two groups preferred\nthe use of 21% oxygen over an adjusted percentage to\navoid the risk of decompression sickness,43,46 and the\nother claimed that the equivalent of 50% oxygen ``... is\ngenerally considered to be insufficient to produce any\nclinical effect in this group of patients.''44\nUnfortunately, the authors presented no evidence for\nthis claim.\nBlinding perception as reported by patients\nIn the first double-blind trial (performed by Hart\net al.5), the lack of barotrauma raised questions about\nthe adequacy of blinding measures, especially regarding\nthe use of a lower pressure. However, sequential trials\nusing the same strategy reported problems with equali-\nzation: even the use of ventilation tubes in the sham\ngroup was reported.28 This would imply that blinding\nwas adequate.\nTo further investigate blinding perception by\npatients, in some trials, the patients were asked about\ntheir allocation: at the end of treatment, patients were\nasked whether they thought they had received HBO\ntherapy, sham treatment or if they did not know. In the\npresent review, for each of the three strategies identi-\nfied, at least one randomized controlled trial had pro-\nvided information on this topic. All studies concluded\nthat there was no relationship between patients' percep-\ntion and their actual allocation, thereby concluding\nvolunteer recreational Scuba divers it was found to be\nhighly unlikely that differences between groups could\nbe detected.'' Unfortunately, no reference was provided\nto support their statement.\nApart from the information emerging from the trials\nin the present review, concerns were raised by others\nabout the blinding perception of patients when using\nsham treatment. For example, in 2008, Rainolds and\nLong52 used experienced scuba divers to assess whether\nthey could differentiate between the use of 1.2 and\n2.0 ATA; their study showed that even the most experi-\nenced divers (.500 dives) were unable to make this dis-\ntinction. It is important to mention that this latter\nstudy used ``... subtle pressure variations toward the\nattainment of the final target pressure'' to ensure that\npatients in both groups had to constantly auto-inflate\ntheir ears during the first 10 min of compression. In the\npresent review, none of the trials reported use of this\nlatter strategy.\nIn 2009, Jansen et al. investigated the blinding of\nvolunteers who had no prior experience in hyperbaric\ntreatment or diving. They were asked to guess if they\nwere pressurized to 1.2 or 2.5 ATA and how certain\nthey were about this. Most volunteers reported to be\nquite certain they were exposed to 2.5 ATA, even\nthough this opinion proved to be (statistically)\nIn 2012, Weaver et al. asked divers and experienced\nchamber attendants to estimate the pressure (1.2 or\n1.5 ATA) and breathing gas (air or oxygen) that was\nbeing applied. Again, the conclusion was that no dis-\ncited by Miller et al.24 to justify the choice for 1.2 ATA\nin their sham group.\nBased on the present research and the data from\npatient questionnaires in various randomized controlled\ntrials, it can be concluded that adequate blinding of\npatients is possible, even when using a pressure lower\nthan that of the actual treatment.\nComplications in the sham group\nA possible consequence of using pressure for the sham\ngroup to ensure adequate patient blinding is the occur-\nrence of barotrauma. In our 42 studies, barotrauma\nwas observed with the use of each of the three strate-\ngies. Even the use of minimal pressure resulted in com-\nplications: for example, in 1986, Wiles et al.7 used\n1.1 ATA for the sham group, with 14 patients experien-\ncing complaints due to changes in pressure (10 ear dis-\ncomfort, 3 deafness and 1 sinus pain). As mentioned,\neven the use of ventilation tubes was reported in sham\ntreatment using lower pressures.28 Two trials mentioned\ngiving a single hyperbaric exposure to each participant\nprior to inclusion in the trial to prevent barotrauma\nduring the study.24,34 Moreover, the manner in which\nbarotrauma is scored and reported is often unclear:\nmost studies seem to rely on patients' complaints, with\nonly two studies mentioning that patients were expli-\ncitly questioned about the occurrence of the most com-\nmon complications.27,31 Only three studies mentioned\nthe use of otoscopy to objectively assess barotrauma of\nWith regard to another common complication, myo-\nno myopia was seen in their sham group might poten-\ntially unblind an investigator. However, later research\nshowed that myopia appeared in the sham group with\nthe use of each of the three strategies. This could either\nbe an effect of the (slight) increase in pressure and/or\noxygen partial pressure or a placebo effect.\nUnfortunately, information on the method used to\ndetermine myopia is often missing and is most likely\nbased on patients' complaints only. One study made a\nroutine eye examination using a Snellen chart before,\nimmediately after and 6 weeks after treatment to\ndetermine visual changes. No myopia (defined as a\ndecrease of 2 Snellen lines) was seen in either the\nHBO or sham group. Interestingly, an increase in\nvision was reported in some patients, with up to three\nSnellen lines in one patient in the control group.29\nHowever, since the pathophysiology of myopia in HBO\ntherapy remains unclear, it is uncertain how these\nresults can best be interpreted.\nApart from barotrauma and myopia, claustrophobia\nwas also reported in sham therapy. However, this can\nbe expected, since the environment for patients in the\nsham group is similar to that for the HBO therapy\ngroup, in which claustrophobia is a well-known compli-\ncation.2 There were no reports of serious complica-\ntions, such as oxygen toxicity (not expected with the\npartial pressures of oxygen used for sham treatment),\ndecompression sickness or lung barotrauma.\nConclusion\nThis review examined different strategies used in the\npast to create a sham (hyperbaric) treatment. This is\nimportant because with the increased application of\nevidence-based medicine, randomized controlled trials\nare a frequently requested type of research. In such a\ntrial, the addition of a sham treatment implies a consid-\nerable burden for patients not receiving actual treat-\nment, including the time involved and the risk of\ncomplications (e.g. barotrauma of the ears). This\nmeans that performing such a trial is associated with\nethical considerations, especially if performed with a\nvulnerable patient population, such as the elderly or\nthe critically ill. However, especially in research where\noutcomes are patient reported, the inclusion of sham\ntreatment can be a valuable addition to a trial.\nAll trials included in this review followed one of the\nthree sham profiles: use of a lower pressure than the\nHBO group, while breathing 21% oxygen; use of the\nsame pressure as the HBO group, while breathing a\nmixture with an adjusted percentage of oxygen; and use\nof the same pressure as the HBO group, while breath-\ning 21% oxygen. The advantages and disadvantages of\nthese strategies concerning blinding procedures, practi-\ncality, safety and inertness of placebo have been\ndiscussed.\nThe use of minimal pressurization and 21% oxygen\nwas found to provide adequate blinding and cause the\nleast interference on partial pressure of gases and, there-\nfore, in creating an inert placebo. Although this strategy\nis associated with additional considerations regarding\npracticality and blinding measures, it is the most fre-\nquently used and documented profile. Considerable\ncare is required when deciding which sham procedure\nto use; moreover, researchers need to report in detail\nthe measures that were taken to ensure adequate perfor-\nmance of the chosen strategy.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\n1.
