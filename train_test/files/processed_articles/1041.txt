Singer, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, March 27, 2001 (received for review September 28, 2000)\nSurvey evidence through the early 1990s generally suggests a\nreduction in disability in the elderly population of the United\nStates. Because the evidence is not fully consistent, several authors\nhave speculated about whether disability declines will continue.\nThis paper reports results from the 1999 National Long-Term Care\nper year. In addition, disability declined by a greater percentage for\nDeclines in chronic disability over time can have major\nimplications for fiscal stability of Medicare and Social\nSecurity programs.

The purpose of this paper is to use the\nrecently available data from the 1999 round of the National\nLong-Term Care Survey (NLTCS) to assess whether accelera-\ntion in the decline in chronic disability actually occurred. In\naddition, we assess whether the increase in chronic disability\nhas continued, or possibly whether there has, more recently,\nbeen a decline in chronic disability within this group as well.\nChronic disability prevalence in the U.S. population aged 65\nscrutinized by a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) panel.\nThat panel concluded that the declines in chronic (i.e., more than\n90 days) disability were real but that the 1994 NLTCS would be\nneeded to (i) validate evidence of the decline, (ii) determine the\nvelocity of the decline, and (iii) determine the demographic (i.e.,\nage, gender, race) and disability composition of the decline (2).\nshowed declines were larger for persons age 85 and for both\nserious [i.e., activities of daily living; ADLs (4)] and less serious [i.e.,\ninstrumental activities of daily living; IADLs (5)] impairments.\nIn addition, a number of other national surveys provided\nevidence of a disability decline in the elderly U.S. population.\nFreedman and Martin confirmed the disability decline in the\nThe estimate of the decline (adjusted for population composi-\ntion) in chronic disability from that survey (from 0.9% to 2.3%\nper annum for each of four functions) was larger than observed\ndecline were most rapid at ages 85.

Costa found a decline in\ndisability (loss of mobility functions) as reported by the Civil War\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Surveys.\nThe declines in morbidity and disability observed by Fogel and\nCosta were attributed to improvements in nutrition and to an\nincreased ability to resist bacterial diseases (12) and possible\nchronic disease (organ failure) sequelae of those diseases (15\u00ad\n19). A nutritional hypothesis was also promulgated by Perutz\n(20), who found that British cohorts born after 1840 had a higher\nrate of survival to ages 100 than in earlier cohorts. An\nalternative explanation of these trends is that the improved\nintrauterine environment in ways that changed diabetes, stroke,\nand heart disease risks at late ages (21, 22). The fetal environ-\nment might also affect cancer risks in adults (23). It may even\naffect the risk of organic brain syndromes (Zeng Yi, personal\ncommunication).\nThe evidence led Fogel and Costa to posit a model of ``techno-\nphysiological'' evolution (13). This model argues that improvements\nin health are too rapid to be caused by evolutionary (genetic)\nchanges. Rather, health changes must be caused by the evolution of\nthe technological environment of the individual--especially in the\ntechnologies preserving health. This theory suggests that invest-\nment in health care technology and nutrition could preserve human\ncapital in the U.S. economy by allowing workers to continue being\nproductive at increasing ages (24).\nThe primary question addressed by the new 1999 NLTCS is\nwhether the decline in chronic disability accelerated as suggested\nby social and economic correlates of the earlier disability de-\nclines (25). Singer and Manton (26) found that a continuation of\ncould preserve, in the long term (to 2070), the fiscal stability of\nAbbreviations: NLTCS, National Long-Term Care Survey; ADL, activity of daily living; IADL,\ninstrumental activity of daily living; NNHS, National Nursing Home Survey.\n*To whom reprint requests should be addressed.

These calculations\nsupport the tenets of the theory of techno-physiological evolu-\ntion (13). An acceleration of the decline would be expected from\nthe projected increase of the level of education (years of\nschooling) in the very elderly U.S. population. Preston (27)\nprojected that the prevalence of persons with 8 years or less of\nchronic disability decline could be 2.2%, based on the relation\nof years of school to disability level in the elderly population.\nBelow, we will determine whether the decline in chronic dis-\n1994, as well as whether the composition of the distribution of\ndisability changed. We will examine whether the trajectory of\nchange in disability differed for blacks and nonblacks 1982 to\n1999. The analysis of blacknonblack differences in the rate of\nto 1989 NLTCS showed a significant increase in chronic disability\nfor elderly black Americans (D. Clark and F. Wolinsky, personal\nData\nThe data examined are age-, sex-, and race-specific estimates of\nthe number of persons with chronic disability from the 1982,\ncalculated by using as denominators estimates of the size of the\npopulation aged 65 at risk made from sample-weighted counts\nof persons in each cell. Sample weights were calculated as the\ninverse of the probability of sample selection. Thus our popu-\nlation estimates, before any poststratification, are based on\ninternally consistent estimates derived only from information in\nsample responses and the sample design (i.e., the pattern of the\nprobabilities of selection, and their inverses, provide the sample\nweights to calculate population frequencies; see Census Bureau\nSource and Accuracy Statement for 1999 NLTCS http:\nwww.cds.duke.edu). This procedure was important for estimat-\ning changes in the U.S. institutional population.\nOther estimates of changes were made by examining the use of\nNursing Home Surveys (NNHS). In the NNHS, reductions in\nnursing home use occurred for all age groups above 65. They were\nlargest for persons older than 85. For the first time (1995) in the\nNNHS's history black elderly nursing home use rates (4.52%) were\nhigher than for nonblacks (4.23%). Bishop (30) estimated that rates\nrate (from 91.8% to 87.4%). Changes were also observed in the size\nand composition of the nursing home population by using the 1987\n1995 NNHS showed the number of nursing homes declined by\neven though the NNHS used a broader definition of nursing home\nresidence than MEPS, which would increase the estimated number\ninstitutional sample designs based on facility lists. In the NLTCS\nthis problem did not occur because our sampling unit is the\nindividual, and not the facility, so we can use Medicare adminis-\ntrative lists to generate our sample rather than rely on a facility list\nverification procedure (32). In the NLTCS, we identify, using a\nperson-based list sample, persons in facilities by using nursing home\nbeds.\nAll five NLTCS samples were drawn from Medicare adminis-\ntrative records. This list sample frame maintained near-perfect\nfollow-up of persons across survey years (eliminating bias from loss\nto follow-up). The sample design for the 1982 NLTCS was drawn,\nfrom Medicare lists (see Census Bureau Source and Accuracy\neduRESOURCE.HTML). A reduction set was the predefined\nnumber of cases screened until a sufficient number of sets had been\nprocessed to identify 6,000 chronically disabled persons to receive\ndetailed community interviews (the number budgeted for). This\nprocess required interviewing seven reduction sets--35,000 per-\nsons. The reduction set strategy was used because the prevalence of\nchronic disability in the U.S. elderly community population in 1982\nhad not been previously estimated. In the 1982 NLTCS persons\nwere only identified as residents in institutions. That is, although the\ninstitutional sample component was identified on the 1982 screen,\npersons were not given detailed interviews.

In these 5 years,\n26,735 detailed community interviews were conducted, along with\nscreens were conducted.

The detailed interview response\nimportant implications for adjustments made to the survey for\npoststratification weighting. The smaller the nonresponse rate the\nless likely bias is to be introduced by poststratification weighting. An\narea of potential concern is that certain groups, such as blacks, may\nhave higher nonresponse rates. If they have different true disability\nrates this could lead to bias. The detailed interview response rates\nfor blacks is high (96.7%), which, with the small proportion of the\ntotal sample they represent, suggests any bias is small.\nThe longitudinal sample of persons was linked to a continuous\nadministrative files. These data have become more detailed over\ntime as Medicare file systems were improved (especially in 1990),\ninformation on health care services expanded, and the types of\nMedicare services provided changed. Survey records were, for the\nfirst time, linked to the ``Denominator'' file to identify elderly\npersons served in Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility (TEFRA)\nrisk contracts--i.e., in health maintenance organizations (capitated\nplans) reimbursed by Medicare a fixed amount per person [using\nthe adjusted average per capita cost (33)] rather than being\nreimbursed for specific services used by each enrollee.\nAn important feature of the survey is that the instrument\ncontent on chronic disability was preserved over all waves of the\nNLTCS. Disability was assessed by using measures of chronic\n(more than 90 days) disability based on ADLs (4) and IADLs (5).\nThe definition of institutional status was maintained with only a\nsmall change made in 1989, and an additional type of residence\n(i.e., assisted living) was added in 1999.\nResults\nIn Table 1 we present chronic disability prevalence rates for each\nNLTCS. Rates were standardized to the 1999 U.S. age distri-\nbution. They are slightly different from rates in Manton et al.

They, in essence, involve regressing the sizes of pop-\nulations with a given trait on the variance estimated for that\npopulation size. The variance used in the regression function is\nadjusted for sample design effects (35). Specifically, the standard\nerror of an estimated total Y is predicted as\nThe SE(Y) is the predicted standard error based on the regression\nestimates 0\n.

The t statistic for the decline\nin disability was 15.2, which was significantly different from a\nhypotheses of no change beyond the 0.001 level. t statistics were\ncalculated in several ways (e.g., by using GVF). The sample design\neffects did not vary enough over individuals to significantly alter the\nt-statistic computations.

What may underlie these changes\nis that the proportion of the population with chronic impairments\nthat best respond to instrumentalities (e.g., changes in the built\nenvironment--IADL-only impairments and persons in institutions)\ndeclined most rapidly.\nTo interpret these changes we observe that a number of chronic\ndegenerative diseases had a slower rate of progression, or a lower\ngenerating significant chronic impairment, declined 33.3% [from\ncontinued to 1999 (a hypothesis to be tested) the prevalence of\nsevere dementia in 1999 would be 2.8%--or a million fewer than\npersons from what would have occurred if prevalence had remained\nOther chronically disabling diseases such as stroke and certain types\nof heart disease also showed large declines (38).

First, Singer and Manton (26) showed that a\nrelative rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum in chronic\ndisability could ensure the long-term fiscal solvency of the Medicare\nand Social Security programs. The Social Security Trustees showed\nthe marginal tax rate increase necessary to maintain Medicare\nfor the first time, there was an actual (not discounted by inflation)\nexceeded spending by $21 billion (amended Trustee's Report, April\n20, 2000). This estimate of the reduction was too small. The\nwith the Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI; part B) deficit of\n$1.4 billion, led to a total Medicare savings (Health Insurance and\nSMI) of $3.7 billion--as reported in the amended Trustees report.\nA problem in calculating the status of Medicare was caused by a\ncomputer programming error that understated the expected rate of\ninterest on Trust fund monies made by the Health Care Financing\nerror in 2022. This error represents a shift of 2 years in the date by\nwhich Medicare is projected to be insolvent (i.e., in 2026 rather than\n2024). This projection does not take into account the effects of\nreduced disability prevalence discussed above.\nThe 1999 NLTCS showed that the relative rate of improvement\nsuggested necessary to preserve Medicare solvency to 2070 (26). If\none took the average decline over the 17 years of the NLTCS\n(standardized to the 1999 U.S. population aged 65) the relative\nrate of decline would be 1.7% per annum--more than the 1.5%\nrequired to preserve Medicare solvency. The relative decline in\nnursing home use was larger (3.5% per annum). This finding is\nimportant because per annum nursing home costs are much larger\nthan costs for persons not using nursing homes (41). A conservative\nobserved rates translates into savings of $18.9 billion.\nsource of these changes is likely complex. The analysis showed an\ninteresting association in the relative trajectory of blacknonblack\ndisability and education. The trajectory of education can also be\nTable 2.

However, much of the increase\nin care used by blacks was for hospitalization for ``end state'' and\nemergency services.

The NLTCS\nindicates there were large declines in disability for blacks and\nnonblacks. Part of this decline is attributable to a reduction, for both\nblacks and nonblacks, of nursing home use. Bishop found a decline\n10.8% decline found by Strahan (31)--both Bishop and Strahan\nused the 1995 NNHS] and declines in bed occupancy rates (found\nsuggests that limited capacity (i.e., available beds) is not keeping\nelders out of homes.

The rate of disability is so high in nursing\nhomes that the population could not become much frailer.

The name ``assisted\nliving'' is, itself, in flux, with Wisconsin relabeling their state\nregulations to be for ``residential-care apartment complexes'' (Of-\nfice of Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, 2000,\nlocated at http:aspe.os.dhhs.gov). Currently 25% of assisted-\nliving beds are in three states--California (123,238), Florida\nA problem with this housing sector is that persons are frequently\nforced out of assisted-living residence after developing a disability.\nThus, this type of long-term care is developing more as a residential\nthan institutional model. This is bolstered by the 1999 NLTCS\nwhere, of 811,000 persons (estimated) living in assisted-care facil-\nities, over half reported no chronic disability, and of the other half,\nroughly half were recorded as disabled and living in the community;\nhalf were recorded as disabled and meeting the criteria to receive\nan institutional survey. While we estimated there were 1.2 million\npersons in nursing homes there were 200,000 persons living in\nassisted-living facilities who would have been classified as living in\ninstitutional residence in 1999--a total of 1.4 million that can be\ncontrasted to the NLTCS estimate that 1.9 million persons would\nhave been designated as in nursing homes in 1994 (based on the\nage distribution). Another 200,000 persons in assisted-living facil-\nities were in ``community'' residence (according to NLTCS criteria)\nwith disability (and are in the community disabled population). If\nwe add the 200,000 disabled receiving a community interview to the\ninstitutional population there are still 200,000 fewer in institutions\nIn summary, the decline in the prevalence of chronically\nand nonblack educational trends. There was a major change in\nthe level, and mix, of institutional use by U.S. elderly persons.\nThis did not cause the population with 5 or 6 ADLs impaired to\nincrease as might be expected if institutional care were being\n``rationed,'' forcing persons into community residence. It could\nbe argued that persons who were potential residents in nursing\nhomes, who stayed in the community to receive benefits and\nservices at home, may, in aggregate, not have deteriorated as\nrapidly as persons who were nursing home residents. This\npossibility is consistent with concerns over the quality of care in\nnursing homes--e.g., the residents may have been less likely to\nremain physically active and receive nutritional benefits.\nIt will be important to track chronic disability over time because,\nwith the current large size of the U.S. population, increases in birth\nrates and in-migration cannot be counted upon to replace losses to\nthe stock of human capital available to the U.S. economy. Our only\nviable strategy is to adopt programs that will preserve human\ncapital and keep it in the labor force, for longer periods of time (24).\nThis research was supported by grants from the National Institute on\nAging.\n2.
