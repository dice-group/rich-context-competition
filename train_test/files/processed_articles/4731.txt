For example, in healthcare\nsuch data initiatives tend to focus on creating value\nthrough service efficiencies by sophisticated business\nintelligence, improved healthcare practices and biomed-\nical innovation (DH, 2011). In the UK, it is estimated\nthat analysing data from NHS electronic health records\n(EHRs) could result in efficiency gains of between \u00a316.5\nand \u00a366 billion per year, while transforming the service\nto a more proactive and personalised one (Bosanquet\nand Evans, 2014). This commitment to generate wealth\nout of NHS health data (DH, 2012b; HM Government,\n2012) is also evident in calls to develop policy frame-\nworks and information technology (IT) infrastructures\nthat facilitate closer collaboration between the NHS\nand commercial bioscience firms (BIGT, 2003; HITF,\n2004) in order to accelerate biomedical research and\nOne such health data sharing initiative in the UK\nwas care.data,1 a programme of work for the develop-\nment of a central database with linked NHS hospital\nand general practice (GP) records. Led by NHS\nEngland and implemented by the Health and Social\nCare Information Centre (HSCIC) it has the purpose\nof collecting, de-identifying and linking datasets across\nthe NHS (Grace and Taylor, 2013).

Sponsored\nby the Department of Health, it provides informational\ninfrastructure to the NHS so as to collect centrally its\nelectronic health and social data for various analyses\nand national statistics about population health and ser-\nvice operation (Health Information and Quality\nAuthority, 2014). For care.data, it will collect identifi-\nable information, such as the NHS number, date of\nbirth, postcode and gender, as well as healthcare infor-\nmation, such as family history, vaccinations, biological\nvalues, diagnoses, referrals and NHS prescriptions. In\nthe future, it aims to offer the service of linking the\npseudonymous datasets it holds to datasets supplied\nby customers (Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2015).\nSince 90% of patient care is non-hospital, care.data\nwill collect a wealth of sensitive personal health and\nadministrative data (Hoeksma, 2014) so as to support\nwhole population research for developing effective care\npathways and service models.2 The programme, how-\never, was stalled in February 2014 due to ethical con-\ncerns, particularly in relation to its information\ngovernance framework and data sharing arrangements.\nIt was eventually abandoned in July 2016 (Freeman,\n2016). At first, it appears that HSCIC was forced to\npostpone its plans for extracting and linking primary\nand secondary care data because of certain privacy, and\n(we argue) commercial, concerns.3 This became more\nevident after a public outcry due to a notable data\nsharing fiasco from its predecessor where hospital\ndata was sold to actuaries (Donnelly, 2014).\nTo study the controversies and the resistance to this\nprogramme by the public and (some) healthcare profes-\nsional bodies alike, we first apply Nissenbaum's (2010)\nconceptual framework of contextual integrity (CI) to\nprivacy by paying particular attention to the technol-\nogy and policy-making that has placed HSCIC in the\ncentre of NHS information exchanges. We use this\nframework to describe what new information flows car-\ne.data aspired to introduce between data subjects, sen-\nders and recipients of information as well as new\nprinciples and norms for the public healthcare context.\nWe also attempt to show how certain actors in the\nwider political-economic context value this data and\nattempt to erode the public healthcare context so as\nto privilege other goals and ends. We do this by exam-\nining how certain actors and their interests shaped the\ndirection of the programme for the transferring of data\nto the private (healthcare) sector from the public\nhealthcare sector.\nTherefore, we also treat care.data as a political-eco-\nnomic as much as a technical or ethical phenomenon\n(Davies et al., 2013). As critical STS scholars have\ndemonstrated with biomedicine and, generally, with\nlife sciences (Cooper, 2008), EHRs under care.data\nappeared to follow a similar path of capitalisation.\nThey depict the same threefold relation between know-\nledge and value: the ethical value of improving health,\naccountability audits for better services and the monet-\nary transactional value of innovation (Rajan and\nLeonelli, 2013). For the private sector, such scientific\nand economic endeavours are always risky and politic-\nally sensitive which means that the private sector will\nnot fully engage with them from the outset. Therefore,\nthis new state-driven data sharing initiative carried its\nown normative assumptions of size and speed (Davies\net al., 2013) to justify its necessity (Lezaun and\nMontgomery, 2015). It also attempted to instil what\nwe consider (and present below) a new set of duties\nfor patients\u00adcitizens and the public healthcare sector.\nSuch big personal health data sharing programmes,\nwe argue, expect patients and professionals to share as\nmuch personal healthcare information as possible\nwithin the circle of care. The NHS is increasingly\nobliged to collect and disseminate datasets for admin-\nistrative and research purposes that may go beyond the\ncontext and operation of the public healthcare sector.\nPreferred economies of scale, available infrastructures,\norganisational capabilities, public engagement strate-\ngies and business modelling envelope this context and\ntransactionalise its principles for new, de-contextualised\ninformation flows. In a political-economic context of\nincreased public services privatisation and austerity,\nthe above duties are gradually shifting the obligations\nof citizens, healthcare professionals and the NHS (with\nregards to the collection and analysis of personal health\ninformation) from the requirements and needs of the\nindividual as a member of the society, to those of bigger\nactors (i.e. the state, market, science) for the assetisa-\ntion of NHS primary care datasets and their introduc-\ntion into the knowledge and commercial economies. In\nthis way, we believe we provide a new and useful\napproach in overcoming the NHS data sharing conun-\ndrum, which is located in a divisive rhetoric of privacy\nagainst healthcare improvement and economic prosper-\nity, and show why such initiatives are resisted and will\ncontinue to do so in the near future.\nContextual approach to privacy\nNissenbaum (2010) developed the framework of CI to\nstudy, from a moral and political point of view, privacy\nconcerns around new social\u00adtechnical ITs and provide\npolicy solutions to actual problems of information col-\nlection, analysis and dissemination. For her, a privacy\nconundrum should not be about sharing information or\nnot. Such views tend to narrow the discussion down to\ntheir differences while we seek ways to sacrifice one over\nthe other (Taylor, 2014). Privacy is about appropriate\nsharing of information within a given context\n(Nissenbaum, 2010). For example, the type and\n2 Big Data & Society\namount of information I share with my healthcare pro-\nfessional, and the privacy expectations we both hold\naround this exchange of information, are different\nwhen I move to the context of family or employment.\nInstead, CI helps us to examine new `information flows'\nand `principles of transmission' between `subjects', `pro-\nviders' and `recipients' that respect the norms and ends\nof a particular context (Nissenbaum, 2010).\nNissenbaum (2010) also acknowledges the fact that\npeople may accept novel information flows, and, as a\nresult, less privacy, if these flows can demonstrate their\nmoral superiority and effectiveness over established\nones, without disturbing contextual values. If not,\nthen the integrity of the context is violated.\nA final moral and political question that\nNissenbaum (2010) calls us to answer when we examine\nnew information flows is who, in the end, are the new\nrecipients of information. This means that the public's\nresistance to data initiatives may not always be fuelled\nby the level of information aggregation which an omni-\nbus provider may support, but that this is being\nachieved in a way that favours stronger actors, who\nbecome the new information recipients and can use\nthis information for their own benefit (Nissenbaum,\n2010). Consequently, for every system that introduces\nnovel information flows, we need to assess the moral\nclaims and interests of the various actors involved. We\nneed to examine whether, how and to what outcome\n`principles attaching to social goods in one sphere intrude\ninto the distribution of goods in another' (Nissenbaum,\ndispute between the two contexts was highlighted in a\nrecent Health Committee about the handling of NHS\ndata where the Chair of HSCIC explained the perceived\nconflicting policy framework within which the centre\nhas to operate (House of Commons, 2014):\nI have two separate drivers, one of which is an open data\nagenda, which has been pursued by all Governments in\nthe past decade. That agenda is aimed at making as much\ndata available for as many people as possible, in the belief\nthat it will result in significant benefits in terms of\nimproving efficiency within the health care system, and\nin the wider economy. Against that is a very principled\nposition, and I understand it, of those who say, `I don't\nwant my data used for that purpose'. That is a totally\nlegitimate discussion that should be undertaken under the\nnew regime.\nThe duty to share\nIn healthcare, one of the most important principles\ngoverning transmission of information is confidential-\nity. This healthcare professional duty is based on a\nmutual agreement that any exchange of information\nbetween a patient and a clinician about symptoms\nand treatments will not be shared with others. There\nis an expectation, codified in confidentiality agree-\nments, that patients' information does not leave their\n`circle of care' (Perera et al., 2011). Although modern\nhealthcare requires increased (electronic) information\nflows to various professionals and organisations,\nwhich might be judged as a prima facie privacy viola-\ntion, since they permit breaches of previously estab-\nlished informational norms, these are not usually\nresisted (on the contrary, they are expected) by patients\nbecause they are there to support their care. For exam-\nple, the seventh Caldicott principle makes patient data\nsharing a responsibility for every healthcare profes-\nsional in the NHS: `the duty to share information can\nbe as important as the duty to protect patient confiden-\ntiality' (DH, 2013), while the updated NHS\nConstitution makes `every willing patient..a research\npatient..in the fight against disease at home and around\nthe world' (HM Government, 2011). Consequently,\nthese new transmission principles that the modern\nhealthcare context supports are considered scientifically\nand morally superior, in the pursuit of efficient commu-\nnication, so as to provide patients with the best possible\ncare while running a cost-effective service.\nMoreover, clinicians and researchers are expected to\npractice under professional codes of ethics. As custo-\ndians of data they operate under specific rules of con-\nfidentiality. They have also developed consent\nprocedures that explain the risks and benefits of treat-\nment or research in order to obtain permission from\npatients. However, it is not the efficacy of consent\nitself that has established its virtue in healthcare, but\nrather the trust patients warrant to these professionals\nand institutions insofar as they are thought to be doing\nthe best they can to improve their health (Nissenbaum,\n2011). They trust the whole system (Dixon-Woods and\nTarrant, 2009). Informed consent, then, is a token that\ndoes not necessarily symbolise their understanding of\nresearch aims (Dixon-Woods et al., 2007) and treat-\nments, but their commitment to the practices of those\nresponsible for their well-being, and a token of respect\nfor their autonomy. Therefore, until now, transmission\nprinciples in the healthcare context usually involved\ninformation shared voluntarily for treatment or\nresearch, requiring the knowledge and permission of\nthe patient (Nissenbaum, 2010). Whether proposed\nuses fell within the scope of the original consent\ndepended on what was `proposed scientifically, expect-\nations of participants, and social mores at the time of an\nDriven by the principles of the healthcare context,\nsuch as fairness and beneficence (Chan and Harris,\n2009), it seems that most patients would probably\nVezyridis and Timmons 3\nparticipate in healthcare research (even via their health\nrecords and without explicit consent) to support those\ninstitutions that support their health, and for the public\ngood (Carter et al., 2015). Giving their healthcare data\nfor research purposes (or at least not opting out), espe-\ncially in the context of a national health system, is\nunderstood as an act entailing reciprocity (Busby and\nMartin, 2006). Despite the fact that in the UK there are\nother similar (academic and not-for-profit) NHS data\nsharing initiatives, such as QResearch, ResearchOne\nand CPRD,4 that are facilitating public health research\nfrom GP records; these have not attracted the public\ncriticism and opposition that the care.data initiative did\n(Clemence et al., 2013). The public and healthcare pro-\nfessionals are largely supportive of such initiatives for\npublic health research purposes (Torjesen, 2014),\nalthough some confusion over issues of confidentiality,\ndata security and legal assurances has been noted (see\nBrown et al., 2010). In any other case, this implied con-\nsent would have probably been extended to the\ncare.data initiative but not this time.\nThe duty to not opt out\nAn opt-in model is usually considered a more ethical\n(Willison et al., 2003) approach to active and autono-\nmous decision-making. However, for population-wide\nstudies of low risk or for service planning and auditing,\nan opt-out model is considered a more scientifically\nvalid and practical alternative (Singleton and\nWadsworth, 2006) as it enables bigger and less biased\nsamples (Berry et al., 2012). Healthcare research from\nEHRs can be greatly enhanced as all data is drawn\nfrom the same sample population, thus reducing bias,\nwhile revealing inequalities in healthcare (Macleod and\nWatt, 2008). This is particularly important for difficult\nto recruit or marginalised study populations (Ridgeway\net al., 2013). In any case, when it comes to sharing of\nNHS data a rigorous opt-out process is expected to\nserve as the `ethical minimum' (Sterckx et al., 2015).\nIn the UK, overriding the common law duty of con-\nfidentiality in the NHS is usually possible under Section\nthe disclosure of patient-identifiable data to a third\nparty without patient consent if data will be used for\nmedical purposes, seeking consent is not practical and\nanonymisation is not possible.5 The Health Service\n(Control of Patient Information) Regulations (DH,\n2002) specifies that for medical research purposes\napprovals are granted by the Health Research\nAuthority, while for all other cases responsibility res-\nides with the Secretary of State. However, it was\nbecause of the 2012 HSCA and the care.data that\ndata releases to NHS England became obligatory for\nevery health and social care provider. Grace and\nTaylor (2013) note that these mandated data extrac-\ntions, particularly in relation to the Data Protection\nAct 1998, the common law duty of confidentiality and\nthe NHS Constitution, may be perceived by patients as\nan attempt by the government to override, without `suf-\nficient legal basis', their rights to know how and object\nto, their confidential data being used for purposes\nbeyond their direct care. In fact, public consultations\nhave pointed to the fact that interested stakeholders\nwould have liked more information: the public about\ninformed choice on participation, GPs about uses for\ninformed education of their patients and researchers\nabout uses for informed applications.6\nTherefore, this new obligation created pressure on\nmany practices that did not have the resources to fulfil\nit (Matthews-King, 2014b). Suddenly, the majority of\nGPs had a responsibility to inform patients about a pro-\ngramme they knew little about (NAO, 2015). As data\ncontrollers (and thus legally liable for the patient infor-\nmation they collect7) they had an inconsistent statutory\nobligation both to disclose the data to HSCIC and to\nprocess personal data fairly.8 After increased public\npressure, NHS England agreed to do a publicity cam-\npaign about care.data to inform the public, but this was\nrestricted mainly to one leaflet per household and some\nYouTube videos (Triggle, 2014). Moreover, the infor-\nmation provided, which was sent out without proper\nchecks by the programme's Independent Information\nGovernance Oversight Panel (IIGOP), was unconvin-\ncing and was later deemed `unfit for purpose' (DH,\n2015). It was perceived as biased towards the suggested\nbenefits of the initiative, with little information about\nthe opt-out procedure (Vallance, 2014). Patients who\ndecided not to share their data outside the NHS\nwould have had to opt out of sharing information alto-\ngether, affecting those who would have liked to partici-\npate in research but not in other data uses (Shaw, 2014).\nThe British Medical Association (BMA, 2014) and GPs\n(Matthews-King, 2014c) insisted that, for this pro-\ngramme of secondary uses beyond direct care, an opt-\nin approach was more appropriate.\nAfter the Information Governance Review\n(Department of Health, 2013), NHS England com-\nmitted to respecting patients' preferences on a statutory\nbasis (Swinford, 2014). Patients could register a type 1\nobjection if they did not want their data leaving the GP\npractice or a type 2 objection if they did not want their\ndata leaving the HSCIC in any identifiable form\n(Roebuck, 2014). It was unclear whether after a type\n2 objection a patient could still be approached again for\ndirect care services (e.g., e-referrals).9 NHS England\nhad never considered the full extent of these concerns\nwhich became evident from the fact that it did not ini-\ntially have the capability to process the growing\nnumber of opt outs (Merrick, 2015) and had to work\n4 Big Data & Society\nfor over a year to start processing the resulting 1.5 m\nopt outs (HSCIC, 2016). Moreover, while the HSCIC\ninitially set itself as the only data controller after the\nextraction of patient records for care.data, in the end, it\naccepted joint data control with GPs.10 GPs now had a\nstatutory duty to share this information unless their\npatients decided otherwise and opted out (Matthews-\nKing, 2014a). These developments also led to the estab-\nlishment of the role of the National Data Guardian so\nas to review data sharing and security in the NHS and\nrecommend on more simplified and streamlined opt-out\nprocesses (Caldicott, 2016). At the same time, after the\nlished by NHS England to help care.data get back on\ntrack, in 2016 this group was replaced by a new over-\nsight board.12 This time, however, privacy campaigners\nand civil liberties groups were left out of the meetings.\nThe duty to accept the risk\nDuring the last decade, there have been repeated calls\nfor new laws, information governance policies and\nethics procedures for greater, faster and appropriate\naccess to NHS data (Academy of Medical Sciences,\n2011). It is believed that the current (complex) situation\nis too conservative and inclined towards privacy and\nautonomy at the expense of the public interest\n(Academy of Medical Sciences, 2006). It instils a fear\nof litigation across researchers, healthcare professionals\nand institutions (Clark and Weale, 2011). It slows down\nand burdens (financially) good research (Academy of\nMedical Sciences, 2006). For data initiatives, such as\ncare.data, that require the linkage of disparate datasets,\ncomplete anonymisation of data would simply render\nthe programme impractical. In this debate between pri-\nvate and public the stakes are clear: too much emphasis\non autonomy and privacy risks good research.\nOn the other hand, risk is also increased due to the\ncentralised nature of the care.data. One central database\nenjoys economies of scale, but it maximises the suscep-\ntibility of datasets to malicious activities. In fact, the\nnumber of medical data attacks is growing (ITRC,\nmised at US insurance company Anthem, which shows\nthat sophisticated security systems are often insufficient\nto safeguard a database (Mathews, 2015). The NHS has\nbecome the single largest reporter of data breaches to the\nICO (Murphy, 2015). There are also secondary threats\nfrom malicious inference from legitimately released\ndata. These cannot be resolved by improved cyber-\nsecurity because they only make use of data available\nlegitimately (HSCIC, 2014). While many in the field\nacknowledge an increased risk of data abuse, they also\nbelieve that as long as appropriate measures are in place,\nsuch initiatives can be justified (Faden et al., 2013).\nAggregated databases may also produce information\nbeyond a given dataset. Importantly, the simplicity of\nthis record linking and digital processing makes the\naccuracy of the complete patient record extremely dif-\nficult to dispute and may systematically compound\nsocial inequalities (Nuffield Council on Bioethics,\n2015). A DNA sequence, for example, may reveal infor-\nmation not only about a patient but also about her\nfamily (Gertz, 2004), while aggregate genomic data car-\nries a high risk of re-identification (Erlich and\nNarayanan, 2014). Data mining may lead to profiling\nwith significant social consequences. Existing bio-banks\nalready seek to link their data with records of criminal\nconvictions, earnings and employment data.13\nHSCIC recognised the operational risks from\ninappropriate access or imperfect anonymisation of\ndata (Dickinson, 2013). It also accepted the main risk\ninvolved in pseudonymisation \u00ad the practice of repla-\ncing the main patient identifier (i.e. NHS number) with\na unique but meaningless pseudonym (Oswald, 2014) \u00ad\nwhich is the possibility of re-identification of individ-\nuals when various datasets are linked together. In\nresponse, HSCIC became an `accredited safe haven'\n(DH, 2013) to ensure that such risks are minimised\nand access restricted to accredited researchers who\nmeet specific criteria (Academy of Medical Sciences,\n2011). Importantly, it remained sceptical about pseudo-\nnymisation at source (assigning the pseudonym before\nthe extraction) due to the varied healthcare settings and\ninformation systems from which data was to be\nextracted (NHS England, 2014). However, it is working\nto ensure that any access to pseudonymised, linked,\ndatasets (and any attempts by analysts to re-identify\nindividuals) will be subject to sanction by the ICO\n(NHS England, 2014). It is unclear whether this is\nsolely for pseudonymised data, since standard and\nbespoke extracts of personal confidential data are pos-\nsible at the moment under a data-sharing contract.\nThey just cost more.14 Despite the fact that literature\nhas ample evidence that demonstrate the limitations of\nthis de-identification mechanism (O'Hara, 2011), cen-\ntral and effective pseudonymisation allows HSCIC to\n(cost-efficiently) process NHS data outside current data\nprotection regulations and without any particular obli-\ngations to the data subjects (ICO, 2012). From there,\nthey can become available for disclosure15 and pro-\ncessed without always knowing accurately who final\ndata recipients might be.16\nThe duty to assetise\nThe 2008 global financial crisis, the recession and the\nprevailing pro-market political-economic approach to\npublic sector administration, as well as the dismantling\nof the welfare state, have placed the NHS under\nVezyridis and Timmons 5\nimmense pressure to close its funding gap. From the\nWanless Report to the `Nicholson Challenge', succes-\nsive UK governments have concentrated their efforts on\naccelerating efficiency gains and productivity improve-\nments, rather than increasing NHS funding out of tax-\nHSCA epitomised the privatisation of the NHS via the\ncontracting of NHS services to private providers\n(Pollock, 2015). With personal data being termed as\nthe new asset (Schwab et al., 2011) in this post-indus-\ntrial information era and its economic value amounting\nto a new kind of equity (Mohamed and Ismail, 2012)\nfor organisations and businesses to increase their cap-\nital, NHS data is also seen as a valuable source of\nincome for the sustainability of the NHS (see George\nActors from the wider public and private sectors,\nincluding the pharmaceutical and insurance industries,\nhave always been interested in getting access to NHS\ndata (Tiner, 2007). HSCIC was (before the public\noutcry) able to tailor its data service to these potential\ncustomers' needs (McKinsey & Company, 2014). The\npurpose has not been to make a direct profit out of the\nselling of these data assets \u00ad any associated fees are\nusually there to cover the costs of dataset preparation\nand the auditing and managing of the contracts. It is\nmore about facilitating data sharing among actors\nwithin the wider economy that can exploit them for\nknowledge and profit (Schwab et al., 2011). For exam-\nple, the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA) pur-\ncombined with credit ratings and deprivation (IFoA,\n2014). While it is unclear from the published report\nhow the datasets were linked and by whom, its\nresearchers were able to advise the health insurance\nsector on pricing practices for first incidences of critical\nillnesses by using geodemographic profiling from actual\n(individual-level and anonymised) data rather `relying\non approximations' (IFoA, 2014: 9). Interest is also\ngrowing from other government departments, such as\nthe Department of Work and Pensions (Baldwin, 2014),\nthe Police and the National Crime Agency. The\nPartridge Data Review (HSCIC, 2014) was particularly\nilluminating. More than half of data releases (from the\nsample studied) were made to various private sector\norganisations under a rather dubious information gov-\nernance framework (HSCIC, 2014). HSCIC had subse-\nquently to change its contract policy and become more\ntransparent by developing a basic register with data\nDespite the fact that several surveys have shown that\nthe public does not trust commercial companies with\ntheir data, whether legitimately accessed or not\nwould not like to see their data being shared solely\nfor commercial gain (Hill et al., 2013; Wellcome\nTrust, 2013), the updated legislative framework (Care\nthe private and the public sector when it comes to data\naccess requests. While it emphasises respect for\npatients' privacy by HSCIC (section 253), profit-\nmaking is not strictly prohibited. Therefore, any organ-\nisation can request, receive and analyse NHS data as\nlong as it can justify that the information will be used\nfor the provision of services and the promotion of\nhealth (section 261). For example, a pharmaceutical\ncompany can request data to study, for `public benefit',\nthe efficacy of a drug even if the company benefits\nfinancially as well. The current regulatory and technical\nframework appears `to want to keep the scope of poten-\ntial uses broad, in the spirit of treating data as a resource\nwith multiple and undefined potential uses' (Nuffield\nbe expected.

In healthcare, a viable return on\ninvestment can only be generated by the multiple use\nof datasets produced from large-scale, accelerated and\ninexpensive studies (Gaye et al., 2014). This is why,\nwhen it comes to data sharing initiatives and secondary\nuses, `notice and consent' is treated as being impractical\n(Mayer-Scho\n\u00a8 nberger and Cukier, 2013). That is why\ndata cannot be conceived as a commodity but more\nof an asset ready to be deployed, according to market\ndirections.\nConclusions\nIn this paper, we used the framework of CI to offer an\nalternative reading of the care.data conundrum by\navoiding the dichotomy between what is public and\nprivate health data. We focused not only on the new\nsystems, legal and policy frameworks establishing new\ninformation flows and transmission principles, but also\non identifying actors and processes that attempt to\nerode the public healthcare sector while privileging\nnew information recipients. Care.data can be under-\nstood as an attempt by the state to place itself as the\nnew, central, data broker (Keen et al., 2013) by estab-\nlishing those information flows and transmission prin-\nciples that would facilitate the assetisation of NHS\ndatasets for the financialisation of the knowledge econ-\nomy (Lazzarato, 2009). After any `ownership' rights\nhad been reappropriated, these datasets would have\nbeen re-contextualised and rented to actors in other\nparts of the scientific and economic industries to extract\n6 Big Data & Society\nsurplus value. However, this process has proved not to\nbe that straightforward. NHS datasets do not hold only\none (monetary) value, but a range of other scientific,\nsocial and ethical values (Birch and Tyfield, 2013) that\noften determine the fate of their assetisation.\nFrom a CI perspective, patients, as data subjects,\nprovide (personal confidential) \u00ad and hard to alter if\nsomething goes wrong \u00ad information about symptoms\nthey experience to their GP who then receives and rec-\nords this for patient management. After GPs, HSCIC is\nthe second-stage recipient of this longitudinal informa-\ntion that processes this data for all sorts of analyses\nrelated to the operation and financing of the NHS.\nThe original aspirations of care.data and the data dis-\nclosure to IFoA \u00ad before data extractions for care.data\neven started \u00ad can be understood as `evidence of a clash\nthe society that the context of the NHS is changing\nbeyond that which was originally agreed.\nUndoubtedly, confidentiality, reciprocity and auton-\nomy, with regards to notice and consent, are fundamen-\ntal principles in the healthcare and academic research\ncontexts. Patients still expect that they can trust GPs\nwith their information and that GPs are capable of\nmaking good use of it to treat them as well as others,\nwith a certain level of transparency and accountability.\nPatients also appear to strongly maintain their rights\nand engage with decision-making processes about sec-\nondary uses. The new context of information sharing\nthat care.data and the new regulations initially implied\nwas that patients should also contribute data for the\ncountry's economic prosperity, in the widest and most\nambiguous sense of the term. This new, economically\nnarrowed, value caused care.data to be perceived as a\nthreat to a long established social licence for research\nwithin the NHS and healthcare, particularly around\nissues of trust, the new obligations of GPs in their rela-\ntionship with patients and NHS patient data as a public\ngood (Carter et al., 2015). It signalled that a new kind\nof social contract of shared investment and risk\nbetween patients and the NHS is in the making\n(Carter et al., 2015). It showed that there are now\n(unknown) actors outside the NHS that want to\nbecome new recipients of patients' data, free and with-\nout patients' and GPs' having the opportunity to\nexpress an opinion. The attempted mandatory patient\ndata extractions across the NHS, without a choice for\nGPs and patients, led care.data to be seen as a pater-\nnalistic and hurried process of `conscription' (Sterckx\net al., 2015). When patients became aware of the end-\nless possibilities that could open up from combining\nthese healthcare datasets with other datasets from\nother industries, they also became aware of the poten-\ntial misuses of this data. Various public and private\nactors were already working to develop the technical\nand legal frameworks for secondary uses before this\nprogramme was ever brought to the public and GPs\nfor consultation.\nIn a recent report by Ipsos MORI for the Wellcome\nTrust (Castell and Evans, 2016), researchers came to\nsimilar conclusions and talked about `context collapse'\nas way to explain how the realisation of health data\nbeing used in commercial contexts confuses the public\nand makes it suspicious, as well as protective of their\ndata. They concluded that, a clear public benefit and\nsome kind of consent (for any kind of research) had to\nbe demonstrated and provided before the public\nbecomes comfortable with sharing their data.\nInsurance and marketing, and, to a certain extent,\npharmaceutical, companies were not seen as appropri-\nate data recipients. Trust in new information flows was\nalso largely linked to transparency and accountability.\nReaction to care.data seems to be based on the\nunderstanding that NHS data, coming from a network\nof organisations funded by the public for supporting\nthe healthcare of all citizens, is a public good and\nshould not engage in market exchanges. The exchange\nof information within the healthcare context takes\nplace on a voluntary and consensual way. In the com-\nmercial context it takes place according to the rules of\nthe market. While the former context is there to sup-\nport health, the latter is there to support capital accu-\nmulation. Therefore, profit-making on this data is seen\nas an end contrary to the goals of the NHS. Disclosure\nof NHS data to actors and industries that have not\ntraditionally been part of (publicly funded) healthcare,\nand are not expected to give something back to the\nNHS, will be treated as problematic and are likely to\nbe highly resisted. Private insurance and marketing\nindustries will experience resistance, as not only are\nthey motivated by profit, but they are also not expected\nto reciprocally improve the NHS or contribute to its\nsustainability. Their business is about providing\nhighly differentiated products and services to a small\nnumber of individual customers who can afford them\nand is predicated on excluding potential customers on\nthe basis of their health conditions. Pharmaceutical\ncompanies, while they are expected to give something\nback to the NHS (e.g., drugs) from their analyses of\nNHS data, are perceived to have done this at a great\ncost to the service. Profit-making in conjunction\nwith discriminatory or disadvantageous (for the\npublic and the NHS) use of NHS data will probably\nbe strongly contested.\nMoreover, we already mentioned a number of not-\nfor-profit academic and governmental databases that\nfacilitate healthcare research, but compared to care.-\ndata they have different transmission principles. They\ncollect data from GP practices through practices opting\nin and patients can exercise one simple opt out.\nVezyridis and Timmons 7\nAcademic healthcare research is founded on certain\nprinciples, strongly endorsed by the public: transpar-\nency, accountability and scientific scrutiny. While\nthere is still a lot of work to be done, researchers are\nactively calling for further development of these prin-\nciples, for example via the release of datasets, study\nprotocols (Iqbal et al., 2016) and the analytic codes\nUndoubtedly, the NHS has entered the new infor-\nmational era and aspires to lead the way in digital\nhealth. It makes increasing use of EHR data and it\nis strategically exploring opportunities in consumer\nhealth informatics, for example, via the provision of\nfree devices and apps to patients so as to instil per-\nsonal engagement and accountability in the preven-\ntion, self-care and management of patients' illnesses\n(Campbell, 2016). However, while people choose to\njoin an online social network or buy a wearable\ndevice for better, faster and more personalised services\nthis does not mean that they will always have to agree\nto every new information flow and that their data is\nup for grabs and exploitation. Parts of the user com-\nmunity are always on alert to protest against new\ninformation flows that violate their expectations of\nprivacy (Fletcher, 2010) and how other actors are\ntrying to profit out of the unpaid and affective `imma-\nterial labour' (Terranova, 2000) they have put in to\nfeed the platform with their data. As the public's\nawareness of such issues and practices increases so\nwill its sense of privacy violations (Nissenbaum, 2010).\nTherefore, the conundrum, particularly in healthcare\nand around care.data, is not just about privacy versus\nopenness (Vayena and Gasser, 2016). Such dichotom-\nous approaches tend to substitute political, economic\nand ethical discussions for organisational processes,\ncomputational frameworks of security and appropriate\nde-identification methodologies. By concentrating dis-\ncussions on the (im-)practicability of consent, other,\nequally important issues are left out: who ought to\nhave access to data, for what (dis)advantageous pur-\nposes and what are the financial issues at stake.\nBased on the four duties (to share, to not opt out, to\naccept the risk, to assetise) we identified here, we can\nargue that non-egalitarian and unprincipled approaches\nto autonomy and reciprocity may backfire and foster\nresistance that may render such data sharing initiatives\nuseless in practice. As the patient\u00adclinician relationship\ngets jeopardised due to the lack of trust around protec-\ntion of sensitive data from market-driven exploitation\nand discriminatory practices, more people may avoid\nGPs, delay appointments, withhold crucial health infor-\nmation or even provide false information to their clin-\nician (Clark and Weale, 2011). We may see more\npatients avoiding healthcare research and opting out\nof these databases. This will affect the accuracy and\ncompleteness of EHRs (NHS England, 2014), creating\nbiased datasets (Pollock and Roderick, 2014).\nAs care.data amply demonstrated, there is a new\npolicy direction that aims at constituting sustainability,\ngovernance and economic growth as the de facto social\nvalues, while reducing privacy (as a reassurance of\ntrust, exercise of choice and protection from exploit-\nation) to an individualistic preference (Nuffield\nCouncil on Bioethics, 2012). It subtly implies that it\nwould be individuals, rather than organisations or\npublic institutions, who will be forced to deal person-\nally with the healthcare, social and financial conse-\nquences of ever-increasing and ambiguous data\ndissemination practices (Ro\nthey are not always aware of. If successful, an economic\nrationality and governmentality (McNay, 2009),\nfounded on a transactional understanding of potential\nbenefits and rights, risks and rewards in healthcare, will\ngradually prevail. The integrity of public healthcare will\nbe compromised, nurturing more healthcare and infor-\nmational challenges for it.\nTherefore, for such initiatives to succeed, the afore-\nmentioned principles, such as transparency, account-\nability, (socio-)scientific scrutiny, need to be\nreinforced judicially so as to effect those information\nflows and data uses that support patients' equal know-\nledge of the actors, workings and flows of their sensitive\nhealth information (Kelly et al., 2015). Otherwise, the\nnext conundrum in healthcare will focus on how actors\nand processes of the new healthcare context (with\nregards to principles and information flows) may risk\ngood health services (Nissenbaum, 2010) and the pres-\nervation of the NHS as the fundamental pillar of the\ncollective health of the nation. We should always be\nreminded that all this wealth of digitised public health\ndata is now available for various kinds of research and\nfor the greater good not only because of the recent\ncomputational, scientific and clinical advances in data\nprocessing and analysis, but also because of long-stand-\ning principles and fundamental rights, guaranteed to\nevery individual member of the public, exercised\nsecurely and autonomously across multiple contexts\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial sup-\nport for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle: Paraskevas Vezyridis is supported by a Marie\nSklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship from European\n8 Big Data & Society\nsupported by the National Institute for Health Research\n(NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health\nResearch and Care (East Midlands).
