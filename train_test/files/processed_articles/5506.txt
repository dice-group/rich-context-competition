Scholars\nand practitioners have studied different aspects of error cor-\nrection such as the type that best fits certain groups of learn-\ners, the time that errors should be taken care of, the type of\nerror that should be addressed, and many more areas. CF has\nbeen studied from different perspectives: role of anxiety\n(see, for example, DeKeyser, 1993), efficiency (see, for\nSwain, 1985), obtrusiveness (see, for example, C. J. Doughty,\nproficiency (see, for example, Mackey & Philp, 1998) just to\nname a few. What is ostensibly missing from the bulk of\nresearch in this realm is an all-inclusive study whereby the\neffect of all these CF strategies is studied. R. Ellis (2009)\nalso pointed out that no research has been carried out that\nencompasses all the different types of CF:\nThere is an obvious need for carefully designed experimental\nstudies to further investigate the effects of written CF in general\nand of different types of CF. [This] typology . . . [is based on] the\ntype of CF . . . [making systematic research possible to examine]\nthe effect of distinct types and combinations of CF. (p. 106)\nThe researchers, therefore, aimed at finding out which of\nthe CF strategies best serves Iranian English as a Foreign\nLanguage (EFL) learners at an intermediate level with their\nwriting proficiency in the second task of a high-stakes test,\nnamely, International English Language Testing System\n(IELTS). This research, therefore, could pave the way for\nEnglish language teachers to find out the best CF type espe-\ncially for the second task of the IELTS exam for intermediate\nEFL learners. It can also be conducive to better language per-\nformance for the learners should they know what CF strategy\nbest works for them.\nLiterature Review\nThere are different classifications for CF strategies proposed\nby different researchers (Burke & Pieterick, 2010; R. Ellis,\ndiffer in essence. Lyster and Ranta's (1997) classification\nthat encompasses six different categories, namely, clarifica-\ntion request, explicit feedback, recasts, metalinguistic feed-\nback, elicitation, and repetition is mainly used for learners'\noral productions, although with a little modification, it could\nalso be used for learners' writing activities. A\nlittle modification should be exerted because a technique like\n1Tehran University, Iran\nCorresponding Author:\nReza Vahdani Sanavi, Department of ELT, College of Foreign Languages\nand Literature, Tehran Science and Research Branch, Tehran, Iran.\nEmail: Vahdani.reza@gmail.com\nThe Effect of Six Different Corrective\nFeedback Strategies on Iranian English\nLanguage Learners' IELTS Writing Task 2\nReza Vahdani Sanavi1 and Majid Nemati1\n Keywords\ncorrective feedback, IELTS, Task 2, writing component\n2 SAGE Open\nelicitation in which the teacher might pause and suggest an\nerroneous part in the speaker's performance is not possible in\nwritten form. The teacher should, thus, resort to an offline\nway of correcting rather than an online one, when the learn-\ners immediately get feedback.\nUnlike that of Lyster and Ranta (1997), Burke and\nPieterick's (2010) classification focuses on the quality of\nfeedback. Their evaluative and advisory types of feedback\nlook at the writing performance of the learners with the aim\nof assigning a score on their past performance or with the\naim of improving the quality of the learners' written piece\nrespectively.\nAmong all, the classification put forward by R. Ellis\n(2009) best serves the purpose of this research in that the\nfocus in this research was writing and how and whether it\ncould be improved via the different CF strategies. Ellis's\nclassification encompasses six major categories, namely,\ndirect, indirect, metalinguistic, focused/unfocused, elec-\ntronic, and reformulation. In the direct kind of feedback, the\ncorrect form of the inaccurate form is provided. According to\nFerris (2006), this could be done by adding or omitting some\nwords to form the correct form. This type of feedback could\nbest work with elementary learners. However, teachers will\nhave to spend a lot of time correcting the learners' papers\nConversely, in the indirect CF, the teacher indicates where\nthe error exists by underlining or specifying the location of\nthe error. Ferris and Roberts (2001) held that this kind of\nfeedback is advantageous to the direct form in that the learn-\ners spend more time trying to figure out what is wrong,\nhence, more processing time. In other words, this will allow\nmore reflection on the kind of error the learner has; thus,\nthere will more cognitive processing.\nMetalinguistic feedback could take one of two forms: use\nof error coding or a brief grammatical description. In the for-\nmer type, the teacher writes some codes in the margin to sug-\ngest what problems learners have (e.g., wo for word order).\nOf course, the learners will have a list of the codes to avoid\nconfusion. However, in the second type of metalinguistic\nfeedback, the teacher numbers the errors and briefly provides\na brief explanation for the error at the end of the text.\nThe next type of feedback according to R. Ellis (2009)\ndepends on the focus of the feedback. As the name suggests\nin unfocused feedback, the scope of correction is unre-\nstrained and the teacher could correct all extant errors, be it\ngrammatical, lexical, sociolinguistic, or the like, but in\nfocused CF, the teacher only focuses on what he or she has\ntaught and ignores the rest of the errors. The processing time\nof errors in unfocused CF strategy might be overwhelming\nfor the learners because the teacher pinpoints all errors.\nThe last two types of CF strategies are electronic feed-\nback and reformulation, which are not as common as the\nones mentioned earlier. In electronic feedback, learners use\nan electronic software. Use of an electronic corpus like con-\ncordancing can give learners the feedback they need.\nReformulation as the last CF type in Ellis's classification is a\nkind of feedback in which the teacher reconstructs the inac-\ncurate part to make it more natural. In reformulation, the\nwhole idea is to retain the original meaning but to reshape the\nform to make it more native-like.\nAll in all, many scholars suggest that CF strategies are\nfruitful and in some cases, some scholars favor direct over\nindirect (Ferris & Roberts, 2001). Conversely, several others\ndiscovered that indirect feedback results in either greater or\nsimilar levels of accuracy over time (Lalande, 1982; Robb,\n2007) do not think highly of feedback not at least in the long\nrun and claim that there is a gap in research findings regard-\ning the long-time effect of feedback in Second Language\nAcquistion (SLA). What these scholars neglect is the imme-\ndiacy of need. A lot of those who take part in a high-stakes\ntest such as IELTS or Test of English as a Foreign Language\n(TOEFL) are not thinking of their improvement as a long-\nterm goal but rather an immediate one. The claims made\nagainst CF by Truscott might be true when it comes to long-\nterm goals. However, there are some people who will have to\nsit for some high-stakes tests and they might be after some\nimmediate remedies to help improve their inaccurate perfor-\nmance and eventually get a higher score instantly, so they are\nmore worried about their immediate needs rather than their\nlong-term goals. This study could help find out whether any\nof the feedback types included in the study could have a sta-\ntistically significant effect on the stakeholders' writing\nperformance.\nResearch Question and Hypothesis\nTo study the effectiveness of the different CF strategies, the\nresearchers posed the following question:\nResearch Question 1: Does the employment of different\nCF strategies affect the writing ability of Iranian IELTS\ncandidates' writing performance in Task 2?\nThe following null hypothesis was proposed for the afore-\nmentioned question:\nNull Hypothesis: The employment of different CF strate-\ngies does not affect the writing performance of the Iranian\nIELTS candidates' writing performance in Task 2.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe participants in this quasi-experimental research included\n186 BA/BS and MA/MS students studying at different uni-\nversities across the country, and they were preparing them-\nselves to sit for the IELTS exam to attend universities abroad,\nwhere the medium of instruction is English. The participants,\nNemati and Sanavi 3\nchosen from the three different institutes where preparation\ncourses were held, ranged between 21 and 35 years of age.\nDesign\nThe experimental phase of the present research was based on\na pretest\u00adposttest, quasi-experimental design, which\ninvolved six experimental groups, as presented in Table 1.\nThe design used here lacked a control group for several\nreasons. First, depriving the learners from a treatment would\nbe a design defect, for which a lot of researchers have reser-\nvations. Furthermore, it is unethical. Although some partici-\npants receive some kind of treatment, others in the control\ngroup are deprived of any form of CF. In addition, according\nto Ary, Jacobs, and Razavieh (1996) and Mackey and Gass\n(2005), when participants are randomly assigned to one of\nthe experimental groups, the comparison of groups receiving\ndifferent treatment provides the same control over alterna-\ntive explanations as does the comparisons of treated and\nuntreated groups. They argued that more common than com-\nparing a treatment group with a group receiving no treatment\nis the situation where we compare groups receiving different\ntreatments.\nProcedures\nR. Ellis (2009) proposed that there are six major feedback\nstrategies. With the exclusion of one, that is, electronic feed-\nback, and the inclusion of peer feedback, six different groups\nwere required to start the research experimentally. The rea-\nson why electronic feedback was removed from the study\nwas the fact that access to the electronic material was not\neasy at the institutes where the research was run, and because\nthe participants had never been exposed to concordancing\nbefore, it would be considered too time-consuming for them\nto use. Accordingly, six groups were used, each of which was\nexposed to one kind of feedback strategies. Below, an expla-\nnation of how the participants were selected and how the\nstudy was carried out is discussed.\nThe participants were all bachelors or masters students or\ngraduates who were planning to sit for the IELTS exam at\nthree different language institutes in Tehran. On referring to\nthe institutes to sign up for IELTS classes, they were given an\nIELTS exam to see whether they were qualified to attend\nIELTS classes or whether they needed some remedial work.\nIf they were within an overall band score of 5 to 6, they could\ntake part in the IELTS preparation classes; otherwise, they\nwould be introduced to some other preparatory classes.\nBecause the number of students in the classes did not exceed\n15, for each of the six treatment groups, two IELTS classes\nwere used. This would also account for the participant attri-\ntion that is a threat to the internal validity of the research. The\nhomogeneity of the subjects to control the subject variability\ncould also be controlled through the placement procedure.\nOverall, in all the six experimental groups, the number of\nA one-way ANOVA was run to compare the mean scores\nof the six CF groups on the pretest of writing to prove that\nthey were homogeneous in terms of their writing ability prior\nto the administration of the treatments. However, the two\nassumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances\nwere probed before reporting the results of the one-way\nANOVA. The students were then exposed to some writing\nstrategies and required to write. The only thing that differed\nin the six groups was the CF strategy used to correct their\nwriting.\nIn the final session of the course, the students were given\nthe final writing task. This task served as the posttest to\ngauge the participants' writing ability improvement. The\nwriting samples were corrected 3 times by two different rat-\ners based on the criteria proposed by the Cambridge English\nfor Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) Center, which are\ngrammatical range and accuracy, lexical resources, coher-\nence and cohesion, and task achievement. Three ratings, two\nby one and a third one by another rater, could guarantee\nintra- and interrater reliability. As displayed later, signifi-\ncantly high reliability suggested that the scoring could be\nused as good source for deciding about the participants'writ-\ning skill improvement.\nAnother one-way ANOVA was run to compare the mean\nscores of the six CF groups on the writing posttest to find out\nwhich error correction method had the most significant effect\non the improvement of the students' writing ability on the\nposttest. The two assumptions of normality and homogeneity\nof variances were probed before reporting the results of the\none-way ANOVA. The ratios of skewedness and kurtosis\nover their respective standard errors were within the ranges\nof \u00b11.96, that is to say, the students' scores on the posttest of\nwriting enjoyed normal distribution.\nWhen the F value indicated significant differences among\nthe mean scores of the six CF groups on the posttest of writ-\ning, the researcher had to exercise a follow-up post hoc\nScheffe's test to compare the mean scores in pairs to see\nwhere the significant difference lay.\nTo test the null hypotheses, the researchers first had to\nmake sure that there were inter- and intrarater reliabilities\nwhen the learners' writings are rated. Therefore, analyses of\nthese two measures follow.\nTable 1. The Design for the CF Strategies Used for\nExperimental Groups.\nGroup Pretest Treatment Posttest\n4 SAGE Open\nIntra- and interrater reliability indexes.The students' writings\nwere rated 3 times by two raters. The first rater rated them\ntwice with a time interval of 2 weeks. As displayed in Table\n2, the intrarater reliability for the first rater's two ratings is\nthat the two ratings of the first rater enjoy statistically signifi-\ncant intrarater reliability.\nThe interrater reliability between the ratings of the second\nrater with the mean ratings of the first one is .94 (p = .000 <\n.05). Based on these results, it can be concluded that the two\nratings enjoy statistically significant interrater reliability\n(Table 3).\n4.2.11.2 pretest of writing.A one-way ANOVA was run to\ncompare the mean scores of the six groups on the pretest of\nwriting to prove that they were homogeneous in terms of\ntheir writing ability prior to the administration of the treat-\nments. The two assumptions of normality and homogeneity\nof variances should be probed before reporting the results of\nthe one-way ANOVA.\nAs displayed in Table 4, the ratios of skewedness and kur-\ntosis over their respective standard errors are within the\nranges of \u00b11.96. That is to say, the students' scores on the\npretest of writing enjoy normal distributions.\nLevene's statistic tests the assumption of homogeneity of\nvariances. Levene's F value of 1.51 is not significant (p =\n.191 > .05). Thus, the second assumption as homogeneity of\nvariances is also met (Table 5).\nThe SPSS output in Table 6 displays the means, standard\ndeviations, and number of participants in all conditions of\nthe experiment on the pretest of writing.\nThe results of the one-way ANOVA (Table 7) indicate\nthat there were not any significant differences between the\nmean scores of the six error correction methods on the pre-\non these results, it can be concluded that the six groups\nwere homogeneous in terms of their writing ability prior to\nthe administration of the different error correction\nmethods.\n4.2.11.3 posttest of writing. A one-way ANOVA was also run\nto compare the mean scores of the six error correction meth-\nods on the posttest of writing to find out which error correc-\ntion method has the most significant effect on the\nimprovement of the students' writing ability on the posttest.\nThe SPSS output in Table 8 displays the means, standard\ndeviations, and number of participants in all conditions of\nthe experiment on the posttest of writing.\nTable 2.

As displayed in Table 9, the ratios of\nskewedness and kurtosis over their respective standard errors\nare within the ranges of \u00b11.96. That is to say, the students'\nscores on the posttest of writing enjoy normal distributions.\nLevene's statistic tests the assumption of homogeneity of\nvariances. Levene's F value of 2.10 is not significant (p =\n.069 > .05). Thus, the second assumption as homogeneity of\nvariances is also met (Table 10).\nThe results of the one-way ANOVA reveal that there are\nsignificant differences between the mean scores of the six\nerror correction methods on the posttest of writing (F = 9.36,\nand we can say that there are significant differences between\nthe mean scores of the six error correction method groups on\nthe posttest of writing. Table 11 displays the mean scores of\nthe six groups on the posttest of writing.\nFigure 1 displays the mean scores of the groups on the\nposttest of writing. Reformulation was the most useful\nmethod used when correcting the writing performance of\nthe students. Surprisingly, direct form as well as the indi-\nrect mode of correction, according to the graph, were the\nleast fruitful techniques when compared with the rest of the\nTable 6.

These two CF strategies were then followed\nby metalinguistic, peer correction, and error-coding\nstrategies.\nAlthough the F value (F = 9.36) indicates significant dif-\nferences between the mean scores of the six error correction\nmethods on the posttest of writing, the post hoc Scheffe's\ntests should be run to compare the mean scores in pairs.\nBased on the information displayed in Figure 1, it can be\nconcluded that there are significant differences between the\nfollowing pairs of means.\nA: The reformulation group (M = 6.93) outperformed the\ndirect form group (M = 5.68) on the posttest of writing.\nB: The reformulation group (M = 6.93) outperformed the\nindirect form group (M = 5.68) on the posttest of writing.\nC: The reformulation group (M = 6.93) outperformed the\nmetalinguistic group (M = 5.86) on the posttest of writing\nDiscussion\nLike most other studies so far (e.g., Chandler, 2003; Ferris,\nThe investigation of the effect CF strategies on the writing\nperformance of the six different groups suggests that the\nreformulation group enjoys a more statistically significant\nscore. The learners in reformulation group outperformed all\nthose in other groups. The written CF in this study could help\nlearners with their explicit knowledge of L2 for the interface\nbetween the explicit and implicit knowledge does not occur\nimmediately (N. C. Ellis, 2005), and this study was not a\nlongitudinal one to find out whether the learners' implicit\nknowledge is also affected. Reformulation proved to work\nwith the students because the students in the group outper-\nformed all the other students as statistically shown (see\nThe findings in this research are in line with what\nand Lee (2008) claimed in that the performance of the learn-\ners in all the different groups improved.

Mean scores on posttest of writing.\nNemati and Sanavi 7\nthose of R. Ellis, Sheen, Murakami, and Takashima, (2008),\nFarrokhi and Sattarpour (2012) is that they focused on one\naspect of grammar like articles. However, this study focused\non a global change to grammatical accuracy.\nResearch findings of this study comport with those of\nCarroll and Swain (1993) in terms of the efficacy of negative\nfeedback. However, as opposed to what they claimed, that is,\nthe better performance of learners in the implicit groups, this\nstudy purported an enhancement of performance as a result\nof an explicit form of feedback, that is, reformulation in\ncomparison with other forms of feedback. The study also\ncorresponded to that carried out by Lightbown and Spada\n(1990) who suggested an overall improvement in the partici-\npants' writing skill as a result of the incorporation of form-\nfocused activities in instruction. The significant improvement\nin the learners' scores especially in reformulation bears wit-\nness to this view. It can thus be claimed that error correction\ncan lead to more accurate written forms and eventually better\nwriting scores (Shintani & Ellis, 2013).\nAlthough the findings in this research lent support to the\nview that explicit feedback, namely, reformulation, is more\nfruitful than other forms of CF, a few additional issues should\nbe taken into account. The participants in the reformulation\ngroup outperformed (M = 6.93) all the learners in the rest of\nthe groups. However, reformulation was the only feedback\nstrategy that proved significant difference. All the other\ngroups' mean scores did not differ significantly whether the\nCF strategy used was explicit of one kind or another. In addi-\ntion, the period between the two tests, the time frame, was\nonly 10 weeks. The learners in implicit groups apparently\nneeded more time to reflect, so a lengthier time interval\nmight be inversely reported as being more fruitful.\nNevertheless, the issue of time is one major problem in mat-\nters of high-stakes test. In other words, it should be empha-\nsized that the luxury of time is an overburden over the\nshoulders of the stakeholders, be it the learners or their\nteachers.\nTheoretical and Pedagogical\nImplications\nLike many of the studies, the findings of this study adds to\nthe bulk of knowledge regarding CF strategies. The main\ntheoretical implication of the study is that it dealt with a par-\nticular domain of the language and revolved around a phe-\nnomenon, writing, under a \"parent\" category,\nsocioculturalism. In this respect, the researcher studied writ-\ning without recourse to other territories or perspectives.\nSociocultural theory is profoundly rooted in the Vygotskyan\nsocial constructivist views. The present research aimed at the\nfeedback aspect of language learning and, in this sense, only\ndealt with one area of language learning. Therefore, it has\nmuch in common with what is claimed by Vygotskyan\napproach to learning through intervention and mediation.\nAnother significant contribution of the study is that the\nbenefits of reformulation extend beyond form and grammati-\ncal structure and encompass other band descriptors in the\nIELTS writing scoring rubric, namely, task achievement,\ncoherence and cohesion, and lexical resources because the\nfeedback provider dealt with those things at the same time,\nfor the definition of reformulation sanctioned feedback on\nother areas as well.\nUsing the findings of the research, from a pedagogical\nperspective, some implications can be drawn which could\nTable 12. Post Hoc Scheffe's Tests.\n(I) GROUP (J) GROUP M difference (I - J) SE Significance\n95% confidence interval\nLower bound Upper bound\n*The mean difference is significant at the .05 level.\n8 SAGE Open\nbenefit stakeholders in high-stakes tests. Although, as Miller\nCleary (1991) suggested, responses to language problems are\nbeneficial as long as they are subsidiary to responses on con-\ntent and ideas, the posttest results (see Table 9) suggest that\nlearners preparing themselves for a high-stakes test benefit\nsignificantly from all kinds of feedback, but reformulation\nhas a more significant role. Miller Cleary (1991) stated, \". . .\ndemand for absolute correctness, rightness, or neatness\ndistract[s] the writer's concentration from other important\naspects of the writing process\" (p. 498). However, it is a very\nstrong claim that anyone claims \"absolute correctness.\"\nLikewise, Leki's (1999) claim that refraining from focus\non form could lower the learner writers' anxiety was funda-\nmentally questioned for almost all of the participants of this\nresearch who wished to sit for a high-stakes test claimed they\nneeded feedback, and depriving them of any feedback could\naggravate their anxiety rather than allay it. What Leki said\nmight be true in some cases but most probably not in such\ncontexts as that of this research.\nThe results of this study show that reformulation resulted\nin better performance while learning to write for IELTS Task\n2 writing section. The participants in the other five groups\nimproved as well, but the improvement they had was not sta-\ntistically significant enough. One of the strange things about\nthe findings of the study was the mismatch between how the\nlearners felt toward the direct and indirect feedback and how\nthey affected the learners' performance on the test. It is\nimperative, therefore, that teachers pay attention to the fact\nthat what learners think is more beneficial might not be so in\neffect. This could pave the way for another research in which\nresearchers look for match and mismatch between what\nlearners and even teachers think and what best works for the\nlearners. It should also be borne in mind that the results of the\nstudy cannot prove whether the improvement in the scores\nmight mean an enhancement in explicit or implicit knowl-\nedge as Shintani and Ellis (2013) also put forward.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAry, D., Jacobs, L., & Razavieh, A.
