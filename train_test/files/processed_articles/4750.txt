E-mail: lgerald@email.arizona.edu\nBackground\nPoor asthma control in children is a well docu-\nmented public health problem in the US [1,2]. It is\nassociated with frequent exacerbations that cause\nrespiratory symptoms, activity limitation, school\nabsenteeism, and parental work absenteeism [3,4].\nExacerbations also lead to frequent urgent care\nvisits, emergency department visits, and hospitali-\nzations [1,2]. Exacerbations are seasonal with the\ngreatest risk among elementary-age students occur-\nring shortly after returning to school following\nOutbreaks of viral respiratory infections have\nbeen implicated as a cause for this striking seasonal\npattern [8\u00ad13]. Regular hand washing is the most\neffective method to prevent the spread of viral\nrespiratory infections [14,15]; unfortunately,\nachieving effective hand washing practices in\nschools is difficult [16,17]. Barriers include inade-\nquate time, insufficient soap or paper towels, and\ninconveniently located sinks [18\u00ad20]. Assessment\nof schools' physical environments has provided\nmixed results. A 1998 report of elementary school\nrestrooms in the mid-Atlantic found that 66% of\nsoap dispensers were nonfunctional or insuffi-\nciently filled and 33% of automatic hand dryers\nsecondary school restrooms in New Mexico\nreported that soap and hand drying were available\nin 90% of restrooms; however, hand sanitizer was\nreported in fewer than 2% [22].\nTo overcome perceived barriers associated with\nhand washing, some schools have adopted antimi-\nstudies indicate that hand sanitizers reduce overall\ninfection-related absenteeism among elementary\nabsenteeism by 10% [25]. Use of hand sanitizer in\nthe home has been shown to reduce asthma\nexacerbations in children and respiratory illnesses\namong family members [16,27]. Despite these\nfindings, a review by Meadows and Le Saux [28]\ndid not find sufficient evidence to specifically\nrecommend hand sanitizer use in general or\namong children with asthma; however, a review\nby Jefferson et al. [15] concluded that hand washing\ndid reduce viral respiratory infections, particularly\nin young children.\nTo address the questions related to hand wash-\ning in general, and the benefit of hand sanitizer in\nparticular, we designed a study to evaluate hand\nsanitizer use in elementary schools as a mechanism\nto reduce exacerbations among children with\nasthma. We describe the study's design, but more\nimportantly, the process by which revisions were\nmade to the original protocol due to both external\nand local issues that arose after the original proto-\ncol had been funded.\nMethods\nOriginal study protocol\nStudy design\nThe original design was a randomized, longitudi-\nnal, subject-blinded, placebo-controlled, commu-\nnity-based crossover trial. The primary aim was to\nevaluate the incremental effectiveness of hand\nsanitizer use when added to a school's typical\nhand washing practices to reduce asthma exacer-\nbations among elementary-age students. To control\nfor school variation and to minimize cross-contam-\nination, individual schools served as the unit of\nrandomization. Crossover between intervention\nand placebo schools occurred during the summer\nbreak between the first and second year. There were\ntwo major advantages of the crossover design. The\nfirst was the ability to control for the strong\nseasonal variation in respiratory illnesses that was\nexpected. The second was the ability to maximize\nschool support and participation because all\nschools would eventually receive the intervention\ninstead of some being relegated to a noninterven-\ntion control group.\nPrimary outcome\nThe primary outcome was the proportion of stu-\ndents who experienced an asthma exacerbation\neach month defined as one or more of the follow-\ning: (1) a red (<50% of personal best) or yellow\n(50\u00ad70% of personal best) peak flow meter reading,\n(2) increased use of quick relief medication from\nbaseline ( 4 puffs), or (3) a respiratory-related\nschool absence [29].\nSetting and recruitment\nA single large school district in Birmingham,\nAlabama that was comprised of 30 elementary\nrecruited for participation. The system was racially\neligible for free or reduced lunches) diverse.\nStudents with asthma were to be recruited by\nschool nurses who sent information packets home\nto parents via students. Interested parents were to\nbe encouraged to provide consent to be contacted\nby study staff or to contact the study staff directly.\nPrior to obtaining written informed consent from\nparents and written assent from students, the\nproject was to be explained to both parents and\nstudents by the study staff.\nStudy participants\nStudents who (1) attended one of the participating\nschools, (2) had physician diagnosed asthma, and\n(3) could use a peak flow meter were eligible for the\nstudy.\nIntervention\nThe intervention consisted of using a nonalcohol-\nbased hand sanitizer to supplement the schools'\ntypical hand washing practices. During the first\nyear, all schools were to receive hand sanitizer\ncontaining either an active ingredient or placebo\nthat was dispensed from permanently mounted or\nthat provided amounts appropriate for elementary-\nage students. All hand sanitizer was to be provided\nby the study and was to be placed in the lunch-\nrooms and classrooms. No soap, paper towels, or air\ndryers were to be provided to the schools.\nStudents, faculty, and staff in all schools would\nbe instructed on hand washing and hand sanitizer\ntechniques based on the `Always Be Clean' (ABC)\nhand hygiene program developed by Woodward\nLaboratories Incorporated. Hand washing with soap\nand water was to be promoted after using the\nrestroom and when visible dirt was on the hands as\nrecommended by the CDC [30]. Hand sanitizer use\nwas to be promoted as a supplement to hand\nwashing upon arrival at the classroom, before\nlunch, after using the restroom, at the end of the\nday, and after sneezing or coughing as recom-\nmended by ABC. Grade-level appropriate instruc-\ntion was to be provided at the beginning of each\nschool year with reinforcement on the first day of\neach month. Faculty and staff were to be provided\ncontinuing education prior to the start of each\nschool year.\nHand sanitizer active ingredient\nA nonalcohol-based hand sanitizer containing\nbenzalkonium chloride (0.13%) was chosen for\nthe study. Benzalkonium chloride, was designated\n`GRAS' (generally regarded as safe) for topical\nantiseptic applications by the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) [31]. It was effective against\nGram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria associ-\nated with nosocomial infections and many viruses\nassociated with upper respiratory infections includ-\ning human coronavirus and adenovirus [32]. It also\nhad been used previously in several large school-\nAnother important consideration was the availabil-\nity of a placebo without antimicrobial effects [17].\nBoth alcohol-based and nonalcohol-based hand\nsanitizers were initially considered, but community\nconcerns regarding alcohol-based products and\ntheir flammable nature [14,35] and the potential\nfor misuse made them a less desirable choice [36].\nThere were also preliminary data to suggest that\nalcohol-based products might be inferior to non-\nalcohol-based products [33,34]. For example, the\nantimicrobial activity of benzalkonium chloride\nhad been shown to increase over multiple, consec-\nutive washes whereas the antimicrobial activity of\nethyl alcohol tended to decrease over time [33,34].\nBoth had better degerming activity than soap and\nreported hand pain or discomfort whereas no one\nusing benzalkonium chloride reported similar\nData collection\nA web-based monitoring system (Asthma Agents)\ndeveloped in collaboration with Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield of Alabama was to be used to collect\ndaily data without overburdening the schools or\ninterrupting learning activities [29]. Peak flow\nmeter (PFM) readings and school absences were to\nbe recorded daily by students and verified by\nteachers and/or school nurses. Quick relief medica-\ntion (Proventil\u00d5 HFA) for in-school use was to be\nprovided at no charge to all children enrolled in the\nstudy by Merck and Company, Incorporated.\nA DoserTM was to be attached to each student's\ninhaler to record each actuation of quick relief\nmedication automatically. The count was to be\nrecorded every 2 weeks by the study staff.\nCompliance with hand hygiene recommenda-\ntions was to be estimated based on the frequency of\nrefills of hand sanitizer in each classroom and in\nthe lunchroom. Refills were to be stored in the\nhousekeeping office at each school and the custo-\ndial staff recorded refill dates. This method was\nchosen to minimize the burden on classroom\nfaculty and staff. Since all hand sanitizer was to\nbe supplied by the study, the total amount pro-\nvided to each school was to be monitored.\nOther explanatory variables and secondary out-\ncomes including the student's age, gender, race,\nasthma severity, quality of life, asthma control, and\nRedesigning large school-based clinical trials 313\nhousehold smoking exposure were to be collected\nduring bi-annual phone interviews with parents.\nData analysis\nData from the Asthma Agents system and the\nDoserTM were to be used to calculate the proportion\nof students in each group who experienced an\nexacerbation. Generalized estimating equations\nwere to be used to model the marginal rate of\nexacerbations, defined as the proportion of stu-\ndents within each school who experienced at least\none asthma exacerbation each month, while con-\ntrolling for correlation between observations\nwithin each student and between students within\neach school. Adjustment for individual level factors\nsuch as the student's age, race, gender, and asthma\nseverity were to be undertaken also. The study was\npowered to detect a time averaged difference of\n7.5\u00ad10% between the exacerbation rates of the\nintervention and control schools given a sample\nSafety monitoring\nThe study was approved and to be monitored by the\nInstitutional Review Boards at the University of\nAlabama at Birmingham and the University of\nArizona. A Data Safety and Monitoring Board\n(DSMB) was established to monitor adverse\nevents. Two asthma safety events were mandated\nas reportable: (1) a red PFM reading (<50% of\npersonal best) with symptoms 3 days in a row and\n(2) use of more than 30 puffs of quick relief\nmedication in a 2 week period for those whose\nmedication was kept in the school office or more\nthan 40 puffs in a 2 week period for students who\nself-carried. Self-carry of quick relief medication\nwas allowed for any student who had the maturity\nto use it appropriately provided that the student's\nphysician completed an authorization form.\nParents, teachers and school staff were to be\nprovided handouts describing potential side effects\nof hand sanitizer use (i.e., flaky skin, lesions, rash,\netc.) and how to report them.\nMajor events and protocol revision overview\nAfter receipt of the grant award in August 2007 (See\nTable 1 for Study Timeline), three events occurred\nthat required major modifications to the original\nstudy protocol: (1) concerns arose regarding the\nsafety of benzalkonium chloride; (2) no nonalco-\nhol-based hand sanitizer substitute was available;\nand (3) community standards changed regarding\ntypical hand hygiene practices in the schools.\nWhile responding to an IRB requirement to re-\nreview product safety data following grant awards,\nwe found new data indicating that benzalkonium\nchloride: (1) induced moderate genotoxic effects in\neukaryotic cells [37], (2) produced histological\nchanges (hyperplasia, incomplete keratinization,\nloss of the granular layer, acantholysis, and necro-\nsis) in organ-cultured skin [38], (3) induced biofilm\nformation (a matrix of cells attaching to each other\nand a surface) of some bacterial species [39], and\n(4) possibly caused allergic contact dermatitis [40].\nThese concerns prompted a search for another\nnonalcohol-based product but no substitute could\nbe found. The only viable option was to switch to\nan alcohol-based product. While this alleviated\nmany of the safety concerns related to benzalk-\nonium chloride, it prevented the use of a subject-\nblinded design because there was no placebo for an\nalcohol-based product.\nBetween the time of the grant development and\nits award, the schools' typical hand hygiene prac-\ntices changed substantially due in large part to\nchanges in the community's perceptions regarding\ndisease risk. School principals, faculty, and parents\nhad become convinced that hand sanitizer was\nnecessary for good hand hygiene within the\nschools. There was considerable fear that hand\nwashing alone was not sufficient to prevent `the\nspread of germs'. This perception was reinforced by\na methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)\noutbreak in several schools prior to the study.\nTable 1 Study timeline\nDate School year Activity\nBecause of these concerns, hand sanitizer use\nincreased dramatically such that many schools\nrequired parents to purchase personal hand saniti-\nzer as a supply item. Despite reassurance by the\nlocal health department that hand washing\nremained the best option for hand hygiene, com-\nmunity perceptions were so strong that a hand\nwashing only arm was no longer a viable option.\nRevision process\nThe decision to change a study protocol after a\ngrant award is a difficult one that involves many\nimportant stakeholders. For this trial, important\nstakeholders included the National Heart, Lung,\nand Blood Institute (NHLBI) and its designee (proj-\nect officer), our Data Safety and Monitoring Board\n(DSMB), our Institutional Review Board, and the\ncommunity as represented by school administra-\ntion, faculty and staff, and parents. Our goal was to\nmaintain the scientific integrity of the study while\nadapting to safety concerns and changes in the\ncommunity's preferences.\nChronologically, the first major decision\ninvolved the change from the original hand\nsanitizer with its corresponding placebo to an\nalcohol-based product without one. While the\nsafety concerns that prompted this decision were\nmostly theoretical, we agreed that ensuring partic-\nipant safety, especially among children, warranted\nerring on the side of caution. The principal inves-\ntigator and key study personnel made this decision\nin close collaboration with the NHLBI project\nofficer and DSMB over the course of multiple\nteleconferences. The primary goal was to ensure\nthat the redesigned study addressed an important\nresearch question using a methodologically rigor-\nous design without compromising student safety.\nThe school system administration (superintendent\nand chief nursing officer) were appraised of the\nrationale for the proposed changes and were asked\nto approve them prior to implementation.\nBecause there was no placebo for the alcohol-\nbased product, it was no longer possible to conduct\na subject-blinded design for a direct test of the\neffectiveness of hand sanitizer as a supplement to\nhand washing. Instead, we chose to compare the\neffectiveness of a standardized two-step hand\nhygiene process (hand washing plus hand sanitizer)\nwith handwashing only. Schools would be ran-\ndomly assigned to use study-provided hand saniti-\nzer and hand soap (intervention arm) or to hand\nwashing only (usual care arm). Crossover would\nstill occur after the first year.\nWhen we met with school principals and parent\nadvisory groups to discuss the revisions, including\nrandomization of some schools to hand washing\nonly, we learned that personal hand sanitizer use\nhad become ubiquitous in many schools. We asked\nschools to discourage personal hand sanitizer use\n(e.g., removing hand sanitizer from their required\nsupply lists) by arguing that hand washing was\nthe preferred method of hand hygiene. The local\nhealth department reinforced this message on\nour behalf, but parents and school faculty coun-\ntered that personal hand sanitizer use was sur-\nmounting existing barriers to adequate hand\nwashing and that they were reticent to restrict its\nuse. They also pointed out the difficulty of enfor-\ncing restrictions against personal hand sanitizer use\nwhile at school.\nUnfortunately, we were unable to secure any\nrestrictions which meant that instead of the usual\ncare arm being a hand washing only arm, it would\nnow also include a variable amount of personal\nhand sanitizer use as well. The unexpected increase\nin personal hand sanitizer use presented a potential\nbias to the null effect; to control for this possibility\nwe developed instruments to monitor the schools'\nhand hygiene practices more carefully.\nAll of the revisions occurred prior to participant\nenrollment; therefore, no changes to the consent\nprocess were necessary.\nRevised study protocol\nRevised study design\nThe revised protocol was a randomized, longitudi-\nnal, community-based crossover trial that com-\npared the effectiveness of a standardized two-step\nhand hygiene process (hand hygiene education\nplus study-provided hand sanitizer and hand soap)\nwith that of usual care (a variety of school-specific\nhand hygiene practices).\nRevised primary outcome\nNo change.\nRevised setting and recruitment\nNo change.\nRevised study participants\nNo change.\nRedesigning large school-based clinical trials 315\nRevised intervention\nThe revised intervention consisted of a two-step\nhand hygiene practice that included regular hand\nwashing with soap and water supplemented by\nhand sanitizer use. To overcome potential resource\nbarriers to adequate hand hygiene practices in\nintervention schools, the study provided interven-\ntion schools with alcohol-based hand sanitizer,\nhand soap, and needed refills. Hand soap dispensers\nwere installed by study personnel and hand\nsanitizer was made available in disposable bottles\nin all intervention restrooms, health rooms, and\nclassrooms with a sink.\nTo our surprise the installation of dispensers\nbecame an important issue. Originally, we used the\ninstallation of permanent hand sanitizer dispensers\nas an incentive for schools to participate. Since the\nhand sanitizer dispensers would hold product with\neither an active ingredient or placebo, installing\nthem at the beginning of the study in all schools\ndid not pose a problem following crossover. After\nthe redesign, the lack of a placebo created the\npotential for a carry-over effect if Year 1 interven-\ntion schools were to continue using the dispensers\nduring Year 2 when assigned to usual care. We\nproposed eliminating permanent dispensers alto-\ngether, but discontinuation became an issue with\nthe schools as they wanted us to honor our original\ncommitment.\nA compromise was reached by installing hand\nsoap dispensers, instead of hand sanitizer dis-\npensers, in each school prior to the start of their\nintervention year. Schools were concerned that\nremoving dispensers after the intervention year was\nover might damage walls so we agreed to leave\nthem in place but we would no longer supply refills.\nWe deemed that the potential use of the hand soap\ndispensers during the usual care year posed less of a\ncarry-over/contamination risk than the use of hand\nsanitizer dispensers would.\nIn the revised design, the `Always Be Clean' hand\nhygiene curriculum was replaced with the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) School\nNetwork for Absenteeism Prevention (SNAP) pro-\ngram (http://www.itsasnap.org/index.asp) because\nthe ABC program was a branded program of\nWoodward Laboratories Incorporated, the com-\npany which produces the benzalkonium chloride\nhand sanitizer. Hand washing with soap and water\nwas promoted after using the restroom and when\nvisible dirt was on the hands as recommended by\nthe CDC [30]. Hand sanitizer use was promoted as a\nsupplement to hand washing upon arrival at the\nclassroom, before lunch, after using the restroom,\nand after sneezing or coughing.\nOnly schools in the intervention arm received\nthe annual training and monthly refreshers; usual\ncare schools did not receive any hand hygiene\neducation or any hand hygiene supplies. They were\nexpected to maintain their customary hand\nhygiene practices. These practices varied across\nschools and included hand washing and personal\nhand sanitizer use of differing quality and fre-\nquency. Some of this variation was attributable to\nthe inconsistent supply of hand hygiene resources\namong some schools. Because of this variability,\nusual care schools might not be able to maintain\nthe hand hygiene practices necessary to minimize\nthe spread of respiratory viruses among the student\npopulation.\nRevised hand sanitizer/active ingredient\nEthyl alcohol (62% solution) in foam (Purell\u00d5\ninstant hand sanitizer foam).\nRevised data collection\nThe data collection procedures for the primary\noutcome remained unchanged; however, two new\ndata collection instruments were designed to eval-\nuate the school environment as it related to hand\nhygiene practices. The first instrument was used to\nconduct a one-time baseline assessment of each\nschool's `fixed' environmental facilities with regard\nto the availability, type and working condition of\nsinks, soap dispensers, hand sanitizer dispensers\nand hand drying devices (i.e., paper towels or air-\ndryers). The availability of hot and cold water and\ntype of faucet mechanisms available (e.g., spring-\nloaded, automatic, manual-turn) was also recorded.\nThe second instrument was used for monthly\nmonitoring of the availability of hand hygiene\nresources at each school. The type of hand hygiene\nsupplies available at each school (usual care and\nintervention) and their availability, that is, liquid\nor bar soap, hand drying mechanism, hand saniti-\nzer, and hand hygiene instructions are recorded.\nGeneral cleanliness and structural condition also\nwere noted. Data were used to describe hand\nhygiene resource availability in the usual care\nschools and to monitor implementation of the\ntwo-step hand hygiene program in the intervention\nschools.\nSince hand sanitizer was recommended as a\nsupplement to standard hand washing in a setting\nof limited school resources, it was deemed impor-\ntant to estimate the incremental value of hand\nsanitizer use. Therefore, an economic analysis was\nadded as a study aim to estimate the additional\ncosts of hand sanitizer use. A careful cost account-\ning of the usual care and intervention activities is\nbeing conducted. Cost and effectiveness data will\nbe combined to conduct a cost-effectiveness\nanalysis comparing the two-step hand hygiene\nintervention with usual care using dollars per\naverted asthma exacerbation as the primary\noutcome.\nRevised data analysis\nPower calculations were revised based on the\nupdated study design using the monthly frequency\nof episodes of poor asthma control (EPAC) as the\nprimary outcome (Table 2). Two general scenarios\nwere assumed: one where there was no carryover\neffects (data from both years) and one where there\nwere such effects (each year evaluated separately).\nGEE was used to account for the correlation within\na child over time as well as the correlation among\nchildren within the same school.\nCarryover (or residual) effects occur when the\neffect of an intervention during the first time\nperiod persists into the second time period.\nThe persistence of the effect may bias the measured\neffect of the second intervention. It is possible that\neducational intervention could lead to sustained\nchanges in hand hygiene practices at interventions\nschools that might persist into the second year;\nhowever, the presence of a summer break provides\na 10-week `wash out' period that should minimize\nany carryover effect since no reinforcement is\nprovided to original intervention schools during\nthe second year. Research has shown that changes\nin behavioral practices typically decline by 40\u00ad80%\nafter 6 weeks without reinforcement [41]. A recent\nreview of hand hygiene interventions in health care\nworkers noted that without reinforcement the\nchanges in hand hygiene behaviors were sustained\nfor less than 1 week [42]. A 1 month baseline period\nat the beginning of each school year was planned to\nmeasure potential carryover effects.\nRevised safety monitoring\nNo change.\nTrial status\nEnrollment was completed in May 2009 with a total\nper school). The enrollment per school exceeded\nthe estimate used to calculate the study's power.\nThe intervention began in August 2009 and will\nConclusions\nOne of the most difficult aspects of the academic-\ncommunity partnership is the lag time between\nstudy development, funding, and implementation.\nDuring this interval, key stakeholders, perceptions,\nand standard practices within the community can\nchange, often in an unpredictable manner which is\noutside the control of the research team. At the\nsame time, new scientific discoveries may emerge\nthat render the original study assumptions obso-\nlete. Because of this dynamic environment, the\ncommunity-based researcher must be responsive to\nchanges that may undermine the original study\ndesign or collaborations with community partners.\nWe have found that a study team with a broad\nrange of skills, talents, and interests is well posi-\ntioned to respond to a quickly changing environ-\nment. Not all team members are equally suited to\nserve as liaisons with community partners. In\nschool-based research, team members with prior\nwork experience in the schools (e.g., former admin-\nistrators, teachers, or coaches) often can establish\nmore effective collaborations with school person-\nnel than `academicians'. These team members can\nuse their previous relationships to identify and gain\nTable 2 Revised power calculations\nNo carryover effect\n(two school years compared)\nCarryover effect present\n(each school year compared)\nNumber of Children\nPer School\nDecrease in frequency of\nEPACs, due to\nintervention (%)\nPower (%) Number of Children\nPer School\nDecrease in frequency\nof EPACs, due to\nintervention (%)\nPower (%)\nEPAC \u00bc Episodes of Poor Asthma Control.\nRedesigning large school-based clinical trials 317\naccess to the key stakeholders within the school\nsystem. Additionally, they can navigate a cultural\nwork environment that is often quite different from\nthe academic setting. Having team members with\nthis background is critically important for school-\nbased research.\nIn retrospect, the most crucial decision that\nimpacted our original research design was the\ndecision to abandon the nonalcohol-based hand\nsanitizer containing benzalkonium chloride.\nWithout this product and its corresponding pla-\ncebo, we were unable to conduct a subject-blinded\ndesign. Initially, we felt confident that the product\nwas safe and effective; however, the in vitro data\nthat subsequently emerged cast doubts on the\nproduct's previously established safety record. The\nnew data emerged at a point in the study cycle\nwhere little time was available to contemplate\nthe decision without substantially delaying imple-\nmentation. We also were sensitive to safety con-\ncerns given that we were working with a vulnerable\npopulation (children) in a challenging research\nsetting (schools). We believed that a smaller body\nof in vitro findings questioning the product's safety\ntrumped a larger body of in vivo findings demon-\nstrating safety that were obtained through industry-\nfunded, manufacturer-led research.\nThe impact of eliminating the subject-blinded\ndesign was magnified by the abrupt change in\ncommunity hand hygiene practices within the\nschools. If personal hand sanitizer use had not\nbeen prevalent in usual care schools, the crossover\ndesign would have been a robust test of hand\nsanitizer as compared with hand washing alone.\nHowever, the ubiquitous nature of personal hand\nsanitizer use forced us to rely on what had been\nreported previously to be substandard hand\nhygiene practices within the schools due to signif-\nicant structural barriers. By supplying the education\nand resources to ensure that the barriers to effective\nhand hygiene in the intervention schools were\neliminated, we were able to evaluate the best\npossible hand hygiene practice (hand washing\nplus hand sanitizer use) against a variety of usual\ncare practices. Unfortunately, the study no longer\ncan measure the effectiveness of hand sanitizer use\ndirectly as a supplement to traditional hand wash-\ning practices. If the trial results are negative, the\npossibility of bias created by personal hand saniti-\nzer within usual care schools may be the primary\ncontributing factor.\nCommunity-based clinical trials are needed to\nestablish the effectiveness of interventions under\nreal-world conditions [43]. A methodologically\nrigorous study design is important to achieve this\ngoal, but the community-based researcher must\nalso respect community beliefs and practices [44].\nFailure to address them satisfactorily may\ncompromise the ethical conduct of research, parti-\ncularly in vulnerable populations. It also may be\ncounterproductive as the community partners are\nvital to the translation of research knowledge into\nsustainable practices.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by a grant from the\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 1 R01\nuse was donated by Merck and Company, Inc. and\ndata system support was provided by BlueCross and\nBlueShield of Alabama.
