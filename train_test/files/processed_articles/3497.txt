    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn New Translation Studies (NTS), cultural paradigm is of great importance to convey the approximate function of the\nsource language into the target language context. Paradigm of culture is treated differently in accordance with its different\ndefinitions in that most of the studies carried out in this field show cultural diversification as the basic and rudimental part\nof this paradigm. In Translation Studies, the translator has to do with two kinds of situations so as to transmit the meaning\nand function of the culture. The first one is known as cultural diversification and the second one as cultural hybridity or\nhomogenization. The former is aimed at Old Translation Studies era, which investigates source\u00adtarget dispersion. And the\nlatter alludes to source\u00adtarget reconciliation. The present study seeks to investigate some void areas in translation and culture\nand proposes a new model in which it makes some efforts to reconcile translation and culture via cultural homogenization\nknown as HomoKult Model of Translation in Gray Zone. The intended process consists of four subcategories: (a) Purposive\nculture, (b) Ameliorated culture, (c) Circulated culture, and (d) Diglossic culture expounded in detail throughout this article.\n",

Diverse cultures along with\ndiverse rites, thoughts, creeds, and behaviors are the most\nchallenging points in translation. But how can the renderer\ntransfer the exact sense of the source culture into the target\none? And does culture diversification really exist? To what\nextent can the renderer create or simulate the intended situa-\ntion in the TL to be understandable? Is cultural homogeniza-\ntion the same as globalization? These are some pivotal\nquestions to be answered.\nNowadays, cultural homogenization or ethnic cleansing is\na vital aspect in translation studies. Translation seeks to dis-\ncover some new ways in translation to integrate cultures and\nthen establishes the stable framework of culture. Therefore,\nmodernization is an asset in New Translation Studies (NTS).\nIn this direction, every state or country compels its citizen to\nabide by some coherent rules for better living. Conversi\n(2009) defines cultural homogenization as follows:\nA state-led policy aimed at cultural standardization and the\noverlap between state and culture. As the goal is frequently to\nimpose the culture of dominant elites on the rest of the citizenry,\nit consists basically of a top-down process where the state seeks\nto nationalize the masses. (p. 719)\nThis definition implies that translation is suffered from\nhierarchy of cultures and languages. It means that whenever\nthe culture is in state of power, it ordains every rule, law, and\norder. In this direction, the robust culture annihilates the\nweak one; the process is called cultural genocide. However,\nthe world is being changed. Modernization and globalization\ntry to integrate and amalgamate the cultures to make a fixed\nand stable culture. The idea of culture homogenization con-\njectures the unified, solid, and organic connection among\npeople. In this process, the identity of cultures will be\nchanged and need to be revised. Every time, amalgamation\nof culture and identity has intrigued tourists, travelers, and\nresearchers. Both culture and identity are able to elicit con-\nnotational feelings of the people. That is because religion is\nthe rudimental aspect of every culture. People's creeds and\nbeliefs are an indispensable part of a community. But the\nproblem is that culture and identity are not always integrated\ntogether. Many anthropologists have defined culture and\nidentity differentially with diverse scopes. For instance,\n1University of Isfahan, Iran\nCorresponding Author:\nAlireza Akbari, Faculty of Foreign Languages, University of Isfahan, Isfahan,\nEmail: Dictogloss@gmail.com\nHomoKult: A New Model in Translation\nAlireza Akbari1 and Mohammadtaghi Shahnazari1\n Keywords\ncultural paradigm, cultural diversification, cultural hybridity, source\u00adtarget dispersion, source\u00adtarget reconciliation, HomoKult\nModel of Translation in Gray Zone\n2 SAGE Open\nCummins (1996) defined identity as follows: \"affirmation of\nidentity thus refers to the establishment of the respect and\ntrust between educator and students\" (p. 4), while Tylor\nincludes knowledge, belief, art, morals, low, custom, and any\nother capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of\nsociety\" (p. 1). It means that culture and identity are entering\ninto the new epistemological era, and they are completely\nseparated from each other. Identity is personal and individu-\nally oriented. However, culture is group- or congregation-\noriented. This event is completely true in translation studies,\nin that cultural homogenization and globalization are two\ndevices to direct this era. With the notion of cultural homog-\nenization, some paradigms in translation such as description,\nuncertainty, and purpose will be put in danger. In these cases,\nculture diversification maneuvered in all directions and\naccepted as the sole reason of power hierarchy in translation\nstudies. Given these explanations, how much the translator\ncan pass the red line of every culture? Red line in translation\nstudies means passing the borders of culture diversification\nand staying the gray zone. Gray zone or area refers to any\nspecial situation that facilitates the process of rendering to\nmake a fruitful and exact translation that is completely per-\nceivable for decoding ability. Decoding ability might be\ndefined as follows:\n(1) The capacity of children whose vocabulary and cultural\nexperience are limited. (2) The double standard of capacity of\nnew literates, who can decode oral message with facility but\nwhose ability to decode written message is limited. (3) The\ncapacity of average literate adult, who can handle both oral and\nwritten messages with relative ease; and (4) the unusually high\ncapacity of specialists (doctors, theologians, philosophers,\nscientists, etc.), when they are decoding messages within their\nPassing the red line means changing, playing, and annihi-\nlating with people's creeds. Is the translator or interpreter\nallowed to pass this line? If she or he passes, what should be\ndone to lessen the degree of anger? Totally, in the first place\nof culture homogenization, most of the people shun accept-\ning this notion. That is because of the fact that their culture is\ngoing to be changed or amalgamated with unknown culture.\nEstablishing a cross-cultural connection along with one sta-\nble or Mother Culture is an ordeal but a possible task. Before\nmaking the established framework of culture, a good defini-\ntion of culture is of great importance. Griswold (1994)\ndefines culture as \"that complex whole which includes\nknowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other\ncapabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of soci-\nety\" (p. 8). This definition seems to be so vast that each sec-\ntion cannot be scrutinized separately. In this direction, one\nmust depict the paradigm of this definition into several\npoints: (a) Cultural substances involve the artifacts, build-\nings, implements, tools, and painting; (b) cultural non-sub-\nstances include the way of dancing, song, garment, and\nspecial accent; (c) cultural environment involves flora and\nfauna such as Rampike and Panda; and (d) cultural behavior\nconsists of beliefs, creeds, values, attitudes, and meaningful-\nness. These four categories are completely true for every cul-\nture and the way of performing is completely different.\nCulture can be investigated from the other angles such as\npolitics, consumerism, and consumption. But the question is,\n\"How vastly do the cultures differ?\" Is there any light to shed\non cultural homogenization?\nToday, we live in a globalized era, and everyone speaks\nabout progression. How will it be possible to progress with-\nout taking a step toward cultural integration? How will it be\npossible to live in an uncertain era? And how would it be\npossible not to consider any factors in integration of cul-\ntures? Answering such questions needs rudimental and piv-\notal studying in this field. Therefore, one must express that\ncultural homogenization diminishes existing cultures or rites\nto a superficial and non-fastidious period in which signifi-\ncant discrepancies will be reduced and become completely\nunderstandable for the bystanders in every culture. Finally,\ncultural homogenization is an open expression of culture,\nwhich is thoroughly applicable in every field of studies, espe-\ncially in translation studies.\nLast but not least, the rationale behind focusing on cul-\ntural homogenization stemmed from the condition that cul-\nture would be treated differently and one cannot build the\nstable framework of the intended term, particularly in the\nfield of translation study, which concentrates on source and\ntarget language culture to see the similarities and differences.\nTherefore, the aim of this study is to scrutinize cultural pos-\nsibilities in translation. Discerning these possibilities in\ntranslation requires some strategies or subcategories utilized\nby the translator to affiliate the bridge of the source to that of\nthe TL culture. Finally, this study seeks to peruse four sub-\ncategories of HomoKult Model of Translation to amalgamate\nSL to TL and make the translation or interpretation homog-\nenize so as to be completely understandable, especially for\ndecoding ability.\nReview of Literature\nDefinition of Culture\nIt is completely natural to say that all people by nature know\nthe exact meaning of the culture. For the ease of the reader, it\nis better to clarify \"culture\" by an example. In 1995, all of the\nmembership of the European Union felt depressed about the\nBritain's referendum, and nearly one in two respondents\nexpressed their dissatisfaction. It is because of the fact that\nthey said we all did not belong to such culture. Defining the\nreal and decisive meaning of culture is a difficult task in\nevery field. Alfred Louis Kroeber and Clyde Kluckhohn\nPatterns, explicit and implicit of and for behavior acquired and\ntransmitted by symbols, constituting the distinctive achievement\nAkbari and Shahnazari 3\nof human groups, including their embodiment in artefacts; the\nessential core of culture consists of traditional (i.e. historically\nderived and selected) ideas and especially their attached values.\nCulture systems may, on the one hand, be considered as products\nof action, on the other hand, as conditioning elements of future\nThe last part of this definition implies that, in future, the\nsystem of culture may change, and it will be ready to be\nreplaced. This suggests that all culture may amalgamate with\neach other and then become one in this process. At that time,\nhierarchy of cultures is useless, and there do not exist any\nculture dominations. Ned Seeleye (1984) described culture\nas, \"I know of no way to better ensure having nothing pro-\nductive happen than for a language department to begin its\napproach to culture by theoretical concerns for defining the\nterm\" (p. 13). In this direction, Seeleye cannot define culture\nfor the way it is, and he just utilized circumlocution. Finally,\naccording to Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics\n(Asher, 1994), defining culture is effortless: \"Despite the\ncentury of efforts to define culture adequately, there was in\nthe early 1990s no agreement among anthropologist regard-\ning its nature\" (p. 2001). It is better to say that Gail Robinson\n(1988) categorizes the definition of culture into two sub-\ngroups: (a) external and (b) internal culture. The former\nalludes to behavior such as language, gestures, customs, and\nhabits. And then products belong to literature, folklore, art,\nmusic, and artifacts. The latter refers to ideas such as beliefs,\nvalues, and institutions. She then defines the term culture in\naccordance with some approaches such as behaviorist, func-\ntionalist, ethno-centrism, cognitive, and dynamism.\nTheories on Culture\nThe term culture has been defined variously during the\nperiod of time. It is important to say that the definition of\nculture depends on the era in which people live. Therefore,\ndepicting the stable definition is approximately impossible.\nEvery time, nations expressed culture in accordance with\ntheir taste and it is not surprising to ponder the fixed and\nwell-balanced meaning. Among all of the theories of culture,\nsome of them are astonishing to scrutinize to make this study\ntangible.\nThe IcebergTheory. The Iceberg Theory defined culture many\nyears ago. Hall (1990, p.2 ) worked on this area to corrobo-\nrate the nature of culture directly. He then added that the\nmost brilliant portion of culture was concealed, and all things\nin culture would be \"just the tip of the iceberg.\" The other\ndistinction is related to Clyde and Florence Kluckhohn's\nexplicit and implicit, and Ralph Linton's category between\ncovert and overt. Explicit information in cultural studies\nrefers to the surface layer of the culture while the latter\nalludes to deep structure of the culture. Every successful cul-\nture amalgamates the deep layer of language to the surface\nlanguage, which completely exhaustive and comprehensible\nin this direction. Linton's category covers approximately all\nthe factors in culture in that covert culture covers all the dis-\ncrepancies and similarities in raw form and the latter covers\nthe practical aspects of culture in this regard. But, the most\nimportant factor is that when a translator, renderer, and the\ninterpreter seek to deal with the covert aspect of culture, he\nor she should consider the red line in culture. It means that\nevery culture has some limitations, which the renderer has to\nobserve prior to the act of translating. Therefore, connecting\nthe covert layer of culture to the surface layer will be an\narduous task in translation studies.\nThe most recent amelioration of Iceberg Theory is related\nto the division of Brake, Medina-Walker, and Walker (1995):\nLaws, customs, rituals, gestures, ways of dressing, food and\ndrink and method of greeting, and saying goodbye . . . These are\nall part of culture, but they are just the tip of the cultural iceberg.\nThe most powerful elements of culture are those that lie beneath\nthe surface of everyday interaction. We call these values\norientation. Value orientations are preferences for certain\nThis definition suggests that the translator should con-\nsider the beneath and surface interaction in the text. Deep\nstructure of the texts should be based on the common rudi-\nmental aspects that are completely understandable for all\npeople. And the surface structure is going to trim text delica-\ncies. Text delicacies in culture refer to some different aspects\nof culture that are thoroughly localized.\nAs can be observed in Figure 1, some rudimental aspects\nsuch as personality styles, assumptions, norms, expectation,\nand beliefs are pertained to the deep layer of the iceberg. And\nsome aspects such as behaviors, appearance, dress codes,\nand customs are related to the other layer called the surface\nstructure.\nIn NTS, there is nothing to do with differences. Everything\ncan be scrutinized in the way of similarities and\nFigure 1. Iceberg Theory.\nSource. Brisbane Catholic Education (1998).\n4 SAGE Open\nthen the renderer seeks to institutionalize translation as the\nhomogeneous act. In this regard, every model and theory that\nare against the Universal Translation must be eliminated or\nrevised. All these processes are directly connected to the\ntranslator's cognition to mix the SL culture to the approxi-\nmate TL culture as well.\nFormal culture.Formal culture is a kind of culture that is\ncompletely prevalent in one society. It can be stated that this\nsort of culture is exclusive of a particular region in this direc-\ntion. Habits, customs, beliefs, and behaviors are the most\nimportant issues in the above-mentioned culture. Formal cul-\nture is no longer objective (Katan, 1999) in that it works on\nthe surface level of the culture. The framework of this culture\nis thoroughly utilizable in rendering the TL superficially, and\nit scrutinizes the surface level of the unit of translation. For\ninstance, Distinti Saluti in the Italian language can be ren-\ndered as \"Yours faithfully.\" In this regard, the renderer\nshould resort himself or herself to formal and framework of\ntarget culture to transmit the exact sense of the SL directly.\nAs another example, Spettabile Ditta will be translated as\n\"Dear Sir/Madam\" to show source\u00adtarget overlap. In the\nabove example, the renderer seeks to cover the overlap and\nthen situates itself in gray zone or area. Formal culture should\nbe taught to preserve rites, traditions, beliefs, and customs.\nFormal culture is devoted to trials and errors and is not per-\ntained to the social conventions of the society. It is better to\nsay that formal culture scrutinizes the norms of the society\napproximately as it has investigated the right or wrong, ade-\nquate or inadequate, and acceptable or unacceptable rules of\nthe community in this regard.\nCognitive culture. Culture as a particular cognitive system is\npertained to the anthropological aspects of culture, in that it\ninspects human interaction in diverse situations to depict one\nfixed and stable framework of the culture. In this connection,\nA society's culture consists of whatever it is one has to know or\nbelieves in order to operate in a manner acceptable to its member.\nCulture is not the material phenomenon; it does not consist of\nthing, people, behavior, or emotions. It is rather an organization\nof these things. It is the form of things that people have in mind,\ntheir models for perceiving, relating, and otherwise interpreting\nThis implies some elements of cultural homogenization\nsuch as perceiving, relating, and interpreting. These key-\nwords seek to show the similarities among culture and then\nto amalgamate the intended culture, which is quietly ponder-\nable for the target bystanders. Keesing (1974) sees culture as\nepistemologically in the same realm as language such as\nSaussure's Langue or Chomsky's Competence. Therefore, it\ncan be stated that language is the subcategory of culture in\nthat it expatiates human interactions, behaviors, rites, and\ncreeds through threads of words. In this sense, to transmit the\nnear meaning of the words, componential analysis (CA) will\nbe an asset. In CA, the rationale behind the words will be\nrevealed and the translator is able to conglomerate the SL to\nthe target one.\nSymbolic culture. Culture in this sense can be treated as sym-\nbols and meaning. Culture as a symbolic system has been\nunder investigation since 1957. It is worth noting that the two\nprecursors in this junta are Clifford Geertz and David\nSchneider.\nGeertz sees culture systematically along with some well-\ndefined procedures in accordance with humanistic scholar-\nship.Hemadehisefforttoexpoundethnographicpeculiarities\nto connect and then to corroborate the real nature of culture.\nTherefore, he figures out these peculiarities in real people\naccompanied by real rites, customs, behaviors, and creeds. In\nthis direction, he scrutinized the term culture under the semi-\notic field, which deals with signs and symbols in every cul-\nture. That is why he termed culture as \"an assemblage of\ntext\" (Geertz, 1957, p. 26). Geertz is the opponent of integra-\ntion and internal consistency of culture in that he explains\nonly partial integration and often disconnectedness and inter-\nnal contradiction exist (Katan, 1999). Therefore, Geertz\n(1964) makes one original metaphor, which states,\nThe problem of cultural analysis is as much a matter of\ndetermining independencies as interconnection, gulfs as well as\nbridges. The appropriate image, if one must have images, of\ncultural organization, is neither the spider web nor the pile of\nsand. It is rather more the octopus, whose tentacles are in large\npart separately integrated, neutrally quite poorly connected with\none another and with what in the octopus passes for a brain, and\nyet who nonetheless manages to get around and to preserve\nhimself, for a while anyway, as a viable, if somewhat ungainly\nAnother pioneer in culture as a symbol is Schneider work-\ning on the Parsonian framework. The Parsonian framework\nscrutinizes the social system in culture by its direction toward\nthe achievement of specific goals. The Parsonian framework\nin culture is explicit, comprehensive, and applicable in dif-\nferent layers of culture. The Parsonian model works on\nAdaptation, Goal Attainment, Integration, and Latency\n(AGIL), in that it peruses why communities are fixed/stable\nand functioning. According to Schneider (1972), culture is\nthe systems of meaning and symbols. Symbols and meanings\ninspect the units and rules in behavior of the society to see\nthe similarities and discrepancies among the intended fac-\ntors. Therefore, Schneider extended the paradigm of culture\nas \"how-to-do-it\" rules and norms/conventions, and then he\nexplains the navigation of the social world in this essence.\nSchneider (1972) peruses symbols and meanings in his\nmodels:\nBy symbols and meaning I mean the basic premises which a\nculture posits for life: what its units consist in; how those units\nAkbari and Shahnazari 5\nare defined and differentiated; how they form an integrated\norder or classification; how the world is structured; in what parts\nit consists and on what premises it is conceived to exist, the\ncategories and classifications of the various domains of the\nworld of man and how they relate one with another, and the\nworld that man sees himself living in. (p. 38)\nTo cut the long story short, Schneider made his efforts in\nthe social system, particularly kinship, politics, and econom-\nics and pure cultural analysis. He then addressed pure cul-\ntural analysis as \"uncontaminated by the study of its social\nsystems\" (p. 38). In this connection, he also sought to con-\nnect culture, society, and psychological plans to perceive the\nsocial and standard life of people. And it is better to say that\nthe renderer should put himself or herself in the other's shoes\nparticularly social life, standard of living, creeds, behaviors,\nand the beliefs of people, so as to admix the two isolated\npoles (source and target cultures) in translation studies and\nattract the decoding ability in his or her action.\nThe Translator as Mediator\nIn translation studies, the renderer, translator, and interpreter\nact like the mediator who wants to reconcile the source cul-\nture to the target one. According to George Steiner (1975),\n\"The translator is a bilingual mediating agent between mono-\nlingual communication participants in two different language\ncommunities\" (p. 45). This definition and the like are not\nnew in translation studies. The translator as a mediator or\n\"The Cultural Mediator\" (Bochner, 1981) consists of two\nterms that make lots of discrepancies in translation in that the\ntranslator can mix all the traits of source and target cultures\ninto the fixed and stable paradigm. Taft (1981) defines cul-\ntural mediator as follows:\nThe person who facilitates communication, understanding, and\naction between persons or groups who differ with respect to\nlanguage and culture. The role of the mediator is performed by\ninterpreting the expression, intentions, perceptions, and\nexpectations of each cultural group to the other that is by\nestablishing and balancing the communication between them. In\norder to serve as a link in this sense, the mediator must be able\nto participate to some extent in both cultures. Thus a mediator\nmust be to a certain extent bi-cultural. (p. 53)\nIt is clear that the main task of the translator is to attune\nthe SL to the TL. Understanding of culture means homogeni-\nzation of culture. Homogenization of culture causes people\nto interact well, and they can communicate with each other.\nDiminishing some aspects of culture in both SL and TL will\nbe of great importance to depict the stable framework in\nhomogenization of culture. Therefore, Taft (1981) argued\nthat the mediator should have some traits such as (a) knowl-\nedge about society: history, folklore, traditions, customs, val-\nues, prohibitions; the natural environment and its importance;\nneighboring people, important people in the society, and so\non; (b) communication skills: written, spoken, and non-ver-\nbal; (c) technical skills: those acquired by the mediator's sta-\ntus, for example, computer literacy, appropriate dress, and so\non; and (d) social skills: knowledge of the rules that govern\nsocial relations in society and emotional competence such as\nthe appropriate level of self-control. Therefore, the translator\nshould make his or her efforts to find some common ground\namong culture, so as to make translation universal and sub-\nject to uniformity.\nDiscussion\nCulture paradigm both homogenized and diversified is so\nvast that no one can fully explain about the real nature of\nculture in every field such as translation studies, socio-cul-\ntural studies, and so forth. In this connection, culture is\ndefined variously by everyone and in most of the cases; one\ncannot thoroughly rely on the nature of culture's definitions.\nIn the definition of cultural diversification, some shortcom-\nings can be observed in that it is worth noticing to express\nand then make the stable and uniform culture paradigm par-\nticularly in translation studies. Unfortunately, there do not\nexist real criticisms on culture paradigm in translation.\nTherefore, preparing the real and clear criticisms will be of\ngreat importance to corroborate the nature of culture in trans-\nlation studies. This article seeks to express the updated short-\ncomings of the previous definitions of culture, and then the\nresearcher intends to propose a more comprehensive model\nof cultural homogenization known as HomoKult Model of\nTranslation in NTS.\nAs described in the previous section, most cultural defini-\ntions utilize the wrong metaphorical meanings. A good defi-\nnition should consider all aspects of the culture to convince\nand persuade the reader. For instance, the Iceberg Theory of\nculture simulates culture as a huge iceberg, in that it has two\nparts. One of the parts is beneath the water, which is called\nthe non-observable culture, and the other part is on the sur-\nface, and it is called observable culture. This kind of defini-\ntion is completely true of cultural diversification, in that all\npeople behave differentially according to their language pat-\nterns and language sensitivities. But one has to ruminate that\nthe physical shape of the iceberg is prone to annihilating and\nmelting. In this kind of situation, the iceberg should not be\nconsidered as observable culture. Therefore, clarifying exact\nnature of culture requires considering every aspect of culture\nboth physically and mentally. So, the translator cannot fully\nrely on Iceberg Theory in his or her translation.\nNowadays, most of the translators seek to find new ways\nto connect the cultures to render exactly, and they seek to\nruminate on cultural homogenization. Therefore, combining\nthe SL culture to TL culture in translation will be of great\nimportance. The translators should ponder on the deep layer\nof the cultures, and then they should pay attention to the con-\nveying phase-transfer-in translation. It is completely natural\nto say that all cultures share some common parts together in\n6 SAGE Open\nthat they make translation understandable for all ilks of tar-\nget people. For instance, the terms Norouz--New Year Eve\nin Iran--and Christmas in Western countries share some\ncommonalities such as moving the earth, changing the\nweather, and changing people's thought to start the new\nbeginning. These factors show a deep layer of culture, and\nthe translator has to transmit this kind of situation in his or\nher translation, so as to persuade the reader. But the impor-\ntant factor is that cultures will show some differences in their\nsurface level. Surface-level translation in translation studies\nis just scrutinized for the people's way of thinking. They\nshow the observable facts of the people. Therefore, the trans-\nlator should first translate the shared points, and after that, he\nor she devotes his or her time on differences.\nThe other note is that in cultural studies (CS), the transla-\ntor usually inclines to the surface layer of the culture, which\nis completely wrong. Translator as the mediator should make\nthe equilibrium side in translation. It means that both deep\nlayer and surface layer in translation should be taken into\naccount and treated similarly. For instance, the road between\ntranslation polarities will be treated as source\u00adtarget amalga-\nmation, and it is thoroughly utilizable in cultural homogeni-\nzation known as HomoKult Model of Translation. Therefore,\nadmixing the two poles in translation is highly acceptable to\nconvince the reader.\nHomoKult Model of Translation\nTo expound every culture, one must make the broader and\naccurate paradigm to corroborate every incoming and\noutcoming(consequence) factor in CS. CS deals with all\nissues that depict human background. Therefore, it is sug-\ngested that one must depict an accurate paradigm in CS in\norder not to insult any culture in this direction. It is tried to\nrespect every culture and scrutinize most of the aspects of\nculture so as to create the stable cultural paradigm in transla-\ntion and make translation homogenize which saturates every\nvarious tastes in this regard. The reason to opt for the term\nHomoKult is the prefix and partial wafting (Akbari, 2013),\nwhich is completely ruminatable in translation studies as cul-\ntural homogenization. According to Dictionary reference\n(2014), homo- as the Greek prefix combines from hom\u00f3s,\none and the same, akin to Sanskrit Sama, which is completely\nponderable in that it is utilized in this above-mentioned\nmodel. The prefix homo- is well upgraded, and approxi-\nmately most of the languages utilize it in their texts. The\nother note is about the word Kult, which is derived from the\nreal and exact word in the German language Das Kulture.\nGerman language is one of the leading languages that jot\ndown every noun with capital letter, and it seeks to show the\npower of the above-mentioned language among others.\nHomo- plus Kult show cultural amalgamation in translation\naiming at depicting no borderline in translation studies. In\ntranslation studies, no red lines should be defined, and all the\nproblems in translation studies are derived from the\nviewpoint of the translator. The translator as the mediator is\nable to connect the source and the target text fully, which is\ncalled source\u00adtarget reconciliation in HomoKult Model.\nHowever, when the translator peruses the discrepancies and\ndifferences between the source and the TL cultures, she or he\nis dealing with source\u00adtarget dispersion. The former seeks to\nconnect the prior knowledge of the translator to that of the\nnew one and then determine the common ground. For\ninstance, compliments in each language play semantic voids\nin translation. Should the renderer pay attention to the deep\nlayer of the compliment in the SL, he or she can fully restruc-\nture the same situation into the target one. Therefore, it\nshould be stated that the role of the translator is greater than\nthose of the source and target texts. The latter case is due to\nthe fact that the translator discriminates some of the exclu-\nsive rules either in the TL or in the SL. The translator acts\nlike the annihilator who seeks to destroy the nature of the text\nin accordance with his or her taste and does not consider the\nrole of the reader in translation. The latter case is specialized\nin deconstructionism, who believes authorless text and the\ndeath of the author (Pym, 2010). Therefore, the translator\nshould make some checklists before the act of translating to\ntranslate correctly, and then he or she meets the needs of the\nreader in this connection. This checklist might be the deter-\nmination of unit of translation. Unit of translation can be\ndefined as \"the linguistic level at which ST is recodified in\ntranslator should determine his or her scope in translation in\nthat he or she should actuate the exact unit of translation. For\nmine their unit of translation as \"unit of thought,\" or Catford\nwhich carries the meaning of the utterance. However, these\nkinds of borders in unit of translation will not be very precise\nunless the translator considers all aspects of contextual fac-\ntors in translation. Unit of translation should be beyond the\ndiscourse in the text. That is due to the fact that every word\nhas the rationale behind it, and it is obligatory for the ren-\nderer to transmit this rationality in this regard. Therefore,\nHomoKult Model of translation actuates culture as the unit\nof translation. Culture consists of words, phrases, clauses,\nparagraphs, and discourse, and it seeks to peruse the work-\nability of the intended factors in translation to make the\nTranslation Universal (TU).\nFor the ease of the reader, HomoKult Model will be\ndivided into four subcategories, which start from general to\nspecific issues (top\u00addown analysis). These four subcatego-\nries are as follows:\nPurposive culture. Purposive culture is defined as any kind of\nrudimental culture scrutinized deeply in order to convey go\ntogetherness and then amalgamates deep layer of culture to\nthose of the others. Purposive culture seems like the founda-\ntion of the building to establish a well-balanced structure\nsense for the other parts. Purposive culture peruses\nAkbari and Shahnazari 7\nconceptual items either in the SL or in the TL rudimentally. It\nis the lowest part but pivotal in cultural paradigm. Should the\nintended culture declare its priority over the other ones, it\nwill devastate its nature and is not able to corroborate itself\nas to be stable in purposive culture.\nPurposive culture consists of underlying aspects of cul-\nture, which is of great importance in transmitting the real and\nexact essence of the words, sentences, texts, and ideologies.\nThese aspects are norms, conventions, values, perceptions,\nunderstandings, creeds, and so forth. In the case of rendering\nsuch aspects, the translator/renderer should pay attention to\nthe deep layer of these items. For instance, Io sono il tuo\nsacrifico will be rendered as I am your sacrifice to show the\ndeep value of the intended item in translation. It shows the\nhidden and underlying respect, which is completely agree-\nable in all cultures and languages. But the most important\nfactor is to convey the real sense correctly without any exag-\ngeration. Therefore, the role of the translator in this category\nis of great importance in that the translator is going to pre-\npare the text to move to the next step. As another example,\nfor making a polite request, one has to do with Excuse me,\nEntschuldigen Sie, or Scusi, in that they show the common\ndeep ground in culture dealing with conventions or the norms\nof the society that are completely unanimous in every cul-\nture. In these contexts, the translator should first transmit the\ncommon sense behind the intended polite words through the\ntechniques of reader attention, magnifying, eschewing dis-\npreferred structure, and diminishing imposition (Akbari,\n2014b ). Thus, he or she is able to embellish the surface\nstructures of such polite request. In this direction, translator\nconsiders all ilks of people such as average illiterate, illiter-\nate, and the specialists. Therefore, culture translation needs\nto investigate the underlying structure of the cultures and\nthen prepare it for conveyance. Translation is not the matter\nof naturalizing, alienating, foreignizing, domesticating, and\ncommunicating. Translation is beyond these scopes.\nTranslation is the conveyance of the hidden words of the cul-\nture. Translation or interpretation is not in the place of 0% or\n100%. In some situations, translation will be in between. In\nsome cases, the translator has to do with the lower incoming\nor low incidences of translational items in the culture.\nTherefore, he or she just pays attention to the source\u00adtarget\namalgamation to make an acceptable translation. But the\nproblem is that translation puts itself in a gray zone with\nmore inclination to higher incoming or high incidences of\ntranslational items in the culture. In most cases, the translator\nshould first recognize the underlying sense of the source text\nsuch as norms, conventions, values (purposive culture), and\nthen he or she should build a common connection between\nthe two poles so as to remove any impossibility. Impossibility\narises when the translator renders in accord with his or her\ntaste/passion and does not seek to carry out the suitable and\nappropriate interpretation of the text. This situation puts him\nor her into mistranslation, in that some far-fetched concepts\nwill be derived from the intended text. In this situation, the\ntranslator is the author of the target text, and it is better to\nlabel such issue as \"Transcreation.\" Translation should be\nregarded as an art that makes the impossible possible.\nTherefore, prior to the act of translating, the renderer is better\nto build up simulation (homogenization) in the TL so as to\nmake the rendition more tangible and understandable.\nTo clarify the real essence of purposive culture in\nHomoKult Model, it is beneficial to make use of the intended\ncase study:\nCase Study I: The Spread of Chinese\nCulture\nJapan's location close to China brought many aspects of\nChinese culture to Japan. For example, Japan's rulers claimed\nto be absolute emperor, like those of China. Buddhism and\nConfucianism also came from China and interacted with\nJapanese beliefs to create new values and beliefs.\nConfucianism taught loyalty to the ruler, while Buddhism\ntaught the Japanese to reject the selfish desires. Japan also\nadapted Chinese characters to create their own written lan-\nguage. Chinese music, art, pottery, weaving, and cooking\nfurther influenced Japanese styles and tastes. (http://www.\nbinghamsplace.com/uploads)\nThis case study implies that one has to understand that the\nChinese culture plays as a purposive culture in that it distrib-\nutes the fundamental parts of its own culture to the other cul-\ntures. It is not the way of modifying other cultures. However,\nit aims at enriching other cultures. In this connection, Chinese\nculture is regarded as mother culture, and other ones as\nadapted cultures. In translation, translator as a powerful\nmediator should seek to construct the fundamental situation\nby identifying the inner parts of cultures so as to create an\neternal translation. According to the intended case study,\ntranslator can enumerate Chinese culture as the mother cul-\nture in his or her translation. It signifies that the deep layer of\nChinese and Japanese cultures is the same and, progressively,\nthey are spreading to the Western countries to show their\nhomogeneity throughout the world.\nFinally, it can be stated that purposive culture deals with\nvoid areas in translation which are completely invisible.\nInvisibility in the underlying structure of the culture needs to\nhelp decipher some clear and exact areas to simulate the void\nareas in the TL. Void and ambiguous areas should not be con-\nveyed during the process of translation, in that they make\ntranslation superficial and commercial. Therefore, conglom-\nerating the unclear spots in translation to those of clear areas\nputs the translation in the gray area, which is completely\ncommon in appropriate renderings.\nAmeliorated culture.Ameliorated culture is defined as any\nsort of culture works on the superficial layer of culture. Ame-\nliorated culture inspects the workability of the surface layer\n8 SAGE Open\nof culture and then connects the second angles of HomoKult's\nweb to see the common grounds with those of other angles.\nAmeliorated culture is seen as the decorator among other\nHomoKult's categories in that it pays special attention to the\nsurface level of culture to inspect the degree of similarities\nand differences. To do so, one has to answer these kinds of\nquestions. How can the renderer reflect ameliorated culture\nin his or her translation? And how can he or she approximate\nto the source\u00adtarget amalgamation in this process? To answer\nsuch questions, the process of translation should appellate\nthe reader to connect himself or herself to the various layers\nof the culture. It means that translation plays an appellative\nfunction in the SL and TL. In this connection, Bartoli (1981)\nargued,\ndi persuasione alla conformita e di interiorizzazione di modelli\nculturali che la classe o i gruppi al potere ritengono necessari per\ni mantenimento dell'equilibrio del sistema sociale e che, in\nparticolare nelle societa fortemente stratificate, determinati altri\ngruppi o classi sociali pongono al centro di una strategia di\norganizzazione del consenso attorno ai propri obiettivi e attorno\nalle proprie definizioni della realta. (p. 4)\n(Gloss): Of persuasion to conformity and of internalization of\nthe cultural models (patterns) that the dominating classes or\ngroups deem necessary for maintaining the equilibrium of the\nsocial system and which, especially in highly stratified societies,\ncertain other groups or social classes put in the center of a\nstrategy of organizing the consensus about the appropriate\nobjectives and the appropriate definitions of reality.\nThe ameliorated culture seeks to investigate issues such\nas type of dancing, food, music, art, architecture, beverages,\nand so forth. It can be stated that the intended culture is pro-\ngressive in nature. It will become complete through the time,\nand it is diachronically operationalized. For example, render-\ning Taglitelle ai porcini--an Italian food--as \"Mushroom\nStew\" in the English language is superficially homogenized\nin that the English reader can understand the real nature of\nthe intended food through the time. Or Porcellana in the\nItalian language becomes ameliorated and turns into\n\"Porcelain\" in the English language. In translation studies,\nameliorated culture covers physical norms in which it scruti-\nnizes the acceptability judgment of the source and the TL to\ndepict the uniform framework between the two poles.\nSimulation of the SL culture into the target one is of great\nimportance in this category. For example, transferring of the\nSL cuisine recipe into the target one requires simulating the\nintended cuisine system in the TL, so as to become homog-\nenized for the target reader in essence. In this direction, the\ntranslator can replace the approximate food in the target cul-\nture, so as to create the same situation for the reader to under-\nstand the taste. Connecting the SL to the TL in ameliorated\nculture requires the sufficient knowledge in equivalence\nparadigm. Equivalence paradigm, in most of the cases, deals\nwith superficiality of the rendering to saturate the needs of\nthe reader. But the important factor in NTS will be to per-\nsuade the reader to know the vastness of translation.\nTherefore, the translator has to concentrate on the deep layer\nof culture first. Every text has the rationale in which it needs\nto be ruminated. This rationale is called culture. This is due\nto the fact that most of the renditions seem to be artificial\nrudimentally, and the reader cannot connect himself or her-\nself to the text. In the field of translation, the translator should\nfirst render the culture for his or her own taste. Should he or\nshe be able to connect to the rendering, he or she can publi-\ncize the intended rendering. In this regard, Hoffman (1998)\nargues,\nI have to translate myself. But if I'm to achieve this without\nbecoming assimilated--that is, absorbed--by my new world,\nthe translation has to be careful, the turn of the psyche unforced.\nTo mouth foreign term without incorporating their meaning is to\nrisk becoming bowdlerized. A true translation proceeds by the\nmotions of understanding and sympathy; it happens by slow\nincrements, sentence by sentence, phrase by phrase. (p. 211).\nWhenever the translator has to concentrate on the under-\nstanding and sympathy of the translation, she or he is dealing\nwith surface structure of the translation, and they are tied by\nameliorated culture to see the differences and similarities in\nthe SL and TL. For instance, Das Frittenporzellen in the\nGerman language has to be rendered as \"Frit\" in English. In\nthis situation, the translator resorts to the process of Wafting\nequivalent situation/effect in the TL culture. Wafting is\ndefined as follows:\nA direct and intense translation process, it has a connection with\nrender or even transfer as the original SL by inserting or\nabsorbing the SL words or phrase form into the RL's in\naccordance to prestigious, frequency and intensity of the\nintended word. (p. 27)\nIn the other fields such as music, ameliorated culture will\nbe worth noticing. For instance, the term pop songs was\nderived from the \"popular songs,\" in that people are willing\nto listen. This term enters other cultures as \"pop\" without any\nalternation. That is due to its homogeneity and prevalence of\nthe intended style of music. To substantiate the nature of\nmusic in community and other fields as translation studies,\nMusic does not exist in a vacuum. Geographical space is not an\nempty stage on which aesthetic, economic and cultural battles\nare contested. Rather, music and space are actively and\ndialectically related. Music shapes spaces, and spaces shape\nFrom the above-mentioned definition, one can conclude that\ndialect alludes to the culture of either the source or the target\none, and types of music are pertained to the culture.\nAkbari and Shahnazari 9\nTherefore, the translator should interpret the intended culture\nand make this culture more tangible for the reader and then\nintroduces the kinds of clothes, music, dances, and so forth.\nCase Study II: The Columbian\nExchange\nEuropean and Native American cultures encountered each\nother for the first time in 1492. This encounter, referred to as\nthe Columbian Exchange, led to the introduction of new\nproducts to both cultures. European brought horses, goats,\ncattle, pigs, chicken, wheat, and goods like cannons, cross-\nbows and steel to the Americas. At the same time, Native\nAmericans had developed many foods unknown to European.\nAn important result of the encounter was that the European\ndiet was greatly improved by the introduction of new foods\nsuch as tomatoes, chocolate, potatoes, beans, peppers, pump-\nkins, squash, sweet potatoes, peanuts, and corn. European\nalso learned how to smoke tobacco. (http://www.binghams-\nplace.com/uploads)\nIn such cases, the best and drastic way to convey and\ntransfer the main essence of the original text is to simulate\nthe similar situation with the same equal value into the recep-\ntor language. For instance, potato first appeared in Columbian\nlanguage, and consequently every language started making\nthe exact equivalent of the intended term. French utilized the\nterm pomme de terre, in that it means an apple growing from\nthe ground. Consequently, Persian language stimulated the\nintended term Sibe Zamini to substantiate the same semantic\ncomponent of \"potato.\" This transference shows that cultures\nare becoming approximate with each other. It is noteworthy\nthat the translator as a mediator should observe the local\ncolor of the original and its stimulated term in the TL so as to\nput translation in middle ground between SL and TL. As\nanother example, the local clothes of Japanese people are\ncalled Kimono. How can the translator render such term into\nPersian language? How is it possible to stimulate such situa-\ntion into the TL so as to convince the reader on its feasibility?\nIn this situation, the Persian translator exploits the similar\nterm Rasuxi (local garment of north of Iran) in that it conveys\nthe same deep layer of meaning. However, the only differ-\nence is in the way of its dressing. Needless to say, creating\nand constructing the same effect and situation will be highly\nrecommendable.\nFinally, it should be noted that the translator has to con-\ncentrate on equivalent potentials. Equivalent potentials\nallude to the potency of the words to approximately homog-\nenize in the TL. Translators as the mediators are responsible\nfor making and creating the same effect on the target reader\nso as to saturate their needs both deeply and superficially.\nThere are other factors that are mostly important in cultural\ntranslation such as language sensitivity, language resistance,\nand SL\u00adTL amalgamation, which play the key role in NTS.\nCirculated culture. The third category in HomoKult Model of\ntranslation is circulated culture, which is defined as pro-\ncesses of temporal and spatial alternations in technologies,\nproducts, values, beliefs, and cultural characteristics from\none place, state, and country to another. Circulated culture in\ntranslation will be regarded as the peripheral circumstance\nthat subjects to alter and change. For instance, American cul-\nture spreads into most of the country especially Asian coun-\ntries, which are on the verge of developing. Most of the\nchanges are pertained to technologies, Western ideas as a\nway of clothing, dressing, eating, and behaving. The world\nturns to be multicultural, and it causes to approximate every\nculture together to decipher the points of similarities in this\ndirection. Cultural approximation will influence the tradi-\ntional culture and beliefs. Everything is being progressed,\nand one has to make his or her life updated in accordance\nwith these upgraded regulations. As another example, demo-\ncratic notions are prevalent in many countries. Democratic\nthe military dictatorships in some countries. Circulated cul-\nture consists of many contemporary factors in the entire\nworld. But the question might be, \"To what extent does this\nkind of culture lasts?\" Or \"Do people get along well with\nthese changes?\"\nTo clarify the whole idea of circulated culture, it is better\nto expound one case study so as to persuade the reader on\nmaking the stable paradigm in this regard.\nCase Study III: The Global Reach of\nAmerican Popular Culture\nAmerican culture is the product of many influences, includ-\ning those from Native American, English, French, Spanish,\nAfrican, Asian, and other countries. In the early 20th century,\na vibrant American Culture emerged with the new technolo-\ngies, like the radio, record player, moving picture, and televi-\nsion. After the World War II, American popular music and\nmovies became popular in Europe and later spread to every\ncontinent. Today people throughout the world see American\nmovies and television programs, dance to American \"pop\"\nmusic, and use English as an international second language.\nMany wear American casual dress styles, such as Tee shirts\nwith logos, and large number even eat at American fast food\nfranchises, like McDonald's and Taco Bell. American artists\nlike Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga are international icons,\nknown in almost every corner of the world. (see http://www.\nbinghamsplace.com)\nAccording to this case study, one can conclude that circu-\nlated culture is an indispensable part of human life that\nbecomes progressed through time. In this connection, should\nthe country seek to approximate to the cutting-edge rules, it\nmust be a member of circulated culture to see real-technolo-\ngized culture.\nCirculated culture is an integral part in NTS. The transla-\ntor plays an influential role in the source and target culture.\nHe or she should act as the plug who wants to make the con-\nnection. Nowadays, some new terms along with new cultural\ntraits come into the language showing the progressive nature\nin every country. In this situation, the task of translator is to\nhomogenize the new terms in the TL, so as to introduce the\nprogression and globalization. It is generally believed that\nmost of the ilks of people in every country get accustomed to\nthe new technological areas, and they are really eager to\nknow the function of the new terms in this regard. Therefore,\ntranslator should transfer the surface structure of the circu-\nlated culture to prepare the situation for the target reader.\nBecause of its periphery, the translator/interpreter is not\nrequired to bind themselves on the deep layer of culture in\nthis category. Translation is available by means of its persua-\nsion in the receptive culture.\nTo support the idea of circulated culture, Danilo Zolo\n(1997), in Cosmopolis: Prospect for World Government,\nexpressed the Western as the globalized era:\nIn fact goes no further than a network of connections and\nfunctional interdependencies which have developed within\ncertain important sectors of the global market, above all finance,\ntechnology, automation, manufacturing industry and the service\nsector. Nor, moreover, does it go much beyond the optimistic\nexpectation of affluent westerns to be able to feel universally\nrecognized as citizen of the world--citizens of a welcoming,\npeaceful, ordered, and democratic global village--without for a\nmoment or in any way ceasing to be `themselves', i.e. western\nCirculated culture also verifies the hierarchy of new cul-\nture but not the domination. It means that one of the new and\nprogressive cultures acts as the mother culture that supports\nthe others to make them progress. In NTS, one of the promi-\nnent sources of culture will provide some insights for the\ntranslator and the target reader. For instance, \"iPad\" and\n\"iPod\" are leading technologies in Western countries that\naffect many lives. Therefore, the translator should convey\nthe real culture of the intended words via the process of the\ntotal wafting (Akbari, 2013) procedure in translation so as to\ntransmit the exact influence on people's lives.\nLast but not least, circulated culture is pertained to the\nouter layer of culture, and it is not surrounded by the deep\nlayer of culture. Sooner or later, some new elements in circu-\nlated culture will replace the old ones. Therefore, it is better\nto say that circulated culture is always progressing, and so is\nameliorated culture. The differences between the circulated\nculture and the ameliorated one will be centered on their\nperiphery. The former is always subjected to change, and\nafter a while, some better elements will replace circulated\nculture, and everything is in the position of being forgotten.\nBut the latter case might turn into the purposive culture and\nlasts for a long time. Culture is relative, and the human being\ncannot rely upon relativism. Everything should be in a stable\nand uniform position. If the translator observes such factors\nin his or her translation, it is better to say that his or her trans-\nlation will be indelible in nature. Finally, the important note\nis that the translator is the messenger of the culture not the\nannihilator. Therefore, it is the duty of translator to prepare\nthe common grounds in translation thoroughly and not bind\nhimself or herself to the target level of language. The transla-\ntor should be in between or the comparator in his or her ren-\nderings to affect the process of the translation.\nDiglossic culture. The fourth category of HomoKult Model\nof translation is Diglossic culture. Generally speaking,\nDiglossic culture is defined as any culture in a society that\nconsists of two related parts: (a) high variety of culture and\n(b) low variety of culture. The former refers to a special\ngroup of people such as elites, professors, families with\nhigh-class position, and nobles. However, the latter alludes\nto illiterate, average illiterate, laymen, and young genera-\ntion. Some special groups of people seek to perform their\ndaily works in accordance with their families' back-\ngrounds, and they bind themselves to the new high-class\nregulations. However, some ilks of people seek to build\nand provide the simple life, and they are willing to com-\nmunicate easily with each other without ordaining some\nlimitations in interaction. These sorts of groups mostly uti-\nlize special vernaculars in their daily conversation. There-\nfore, interacting with these two diverse sides is of great\nimportance for linguists, socio-linguists, and translators.\nOf these groups, translators play the major role in reconcil-\ning these two different sides together. The translator should\nordain some rules and regulations dealing with them.\nTranslation in Diglossic culture might be sometimes\nnationalized or internationalized--nationalized in some\ncases that the renderer seeks to introduce and build the rap-\nport chains among the people of the country in general. But\nthe important problem arises when the translator seeks to\nintroduce the Diglossic culture into international market.\nHow can the renderer persuade the target reader not to\nendanger the source Diglossic culture in international soci-\neties? And how will it be possible to prepare the situation\nto introduce the target low variety of culture in the recep-\ntive-target-audience so as not to infer the inappropriate-\nness of the source culture?\nIn Diglossic culture, two translation techniques might be\nused as persuasion in this essence. One is related to the nature\nof natural equivalence, and the other is pertained to the direc-\ntional equivalent. According to Nida and Taber (1969), natu-\nral equivalence is defined as \"reproducing in the receptor\nlanguage the closest natural equivalent of the source lan-\nguage message\" (p. 12). Therefore, the translator should con-\nsider natural equivalent in his or her renderings for particular\nsituations. Natural equivalent might be used for the illiterate\nor average illiterate people. Persuasion of the target reader in\nthis category will not be an ordeal in that the target reader is\nable to connect to the text without making much effort.\nAkbari and Shahnazari 11\nOne of the leading factors in Diglossic culture and natural\nequivalent is translation of poetry, which Roman Jacobson\n118). Poetry plays an important role in human life. Therefore,\ntangible translation of poetry is of great importance in trans-\nlation studies. Prior to the act of translating, the translator\nshould consider the Diglossic nature of culture and the types\nof decoding ability discussed before. Indelible translation\ncauses to carve its suitability in target reader's mind. For\nexample, Umberto Saba's poet known as All'animamia will\nbe appropriate in scrutinizations of natural equivalents for\naverage illiterate or illiterate people in a low variety of\nDiglossic culture.\nDell'inesaustatuamiseriagodi\nTanto ti valga, anima mia, sapere;\nS\u00ec che il tuo male, null'altro, ti giovi.\nO forseavventuranto\u00e8 chi s'inganna?\nN\u00e8 a se stessoscoprirsi ha in suo potere,\nN\u00e8mai la suasentenza lo condanna?\nMagnanimasei pure, anima nostra;\nMa per quali non tuoicasit'esalti,\nS\u00ec che unbaciomentitoindi ti prostra.\nA me la miamiseria\u00e8unchiarogiorno,\nD'estate, quand'ogniaspettodaglialti\nLuoghidiscorpo in ogni suo contomo.\nNullam'\u00e8occulto; tutto\u00e8s\u00ecvicino\nDove l'occhio o ilpensiero mi conduce.\nTriste ma sollegiato\u00e8ilmiocammino;\nE tutto in esso, finol'ombra, \u00e8 in luce\nThe intended English translation of \"Umberto Saba\" by\nMike Towler (trans.1998 ) is as follows:\nYou delight in your unending misery\nSuch, my soul, should be the worth of knowledge,\nThat your suffering alone should do you good.\nOr is the self-deceived the lucky one?\nHe who cannot ever know himself\nOr the sentence of his condemnation?\nStill, my soul, you are magnanimous;\nYet how you thrill to phantom opportunities,\nAnd so are brought down by a faithless kiss.\nTo me my misery is a bright summer\nDay, where from high up I can make out\nEvery facet, every detail of the world below.\nNothing is obscure to me; it's all right there;\nWherever my eye or my mind leads me.\nMy road is sad but brightened by the sun;\nAnd everything on it, even shadow, is in light\nIn the above-mentioned translation, every element of the\nItalian poem was replaced by its natural equivalent to per-\nsuade the reader. Feasibility and practicality in natural equiv-\nalent are necessary so as to make the natural or one-to-one\ncorrespondent translation. For instance, l'ombra is rendered\nby \"the shadow,\" which shows the formal situation of the\npoem. The reason behind such translation stemmed from the\ntype of audience in this poem. It can be expressed that trans-\nlation consists of various equivalents in the TL, but the\nimportant factor is to satisfy your reader by the simple ren-\ndering, particularly in a special ilk of people. The other\nequivalents for the intended words are \"afterimage,\" \"adum-\nbration,\" and \"apparition,\" which carry connotational mean-\nings of the word \"shadow,\" in that the renderer cannot utilize\nit in a low variety of Diglossic culture.\nHowever, directional equivalence refers to \"the replace-\nment of textual materials in one language (SL) by equivalent\nDirectional equivalence is utilized for the high variety of\nDiglossic culture, in that it scrutinizes the connotational\nmeanings and trends of the translation. It is one-to-two cor-\nrespondents in that one element in the SL covers two or more\nelements in the TL. Therefore, this kind of equivalent\nrequires having special audiences in this regard. Most of the\nreaders in this category consist of professors, teachers, phi-\nlosophers, and so forth. Persuasion and saturation the needs\nof this category will be an arduous task in that the translation\nshould cover every aspect of translation so as to connect the\nreal and exact sense of the source text. For instance, \"Chaos\"\nby Gerard Nolst Trenit\u00e8 (1992, http://ncf.idallen.com/eng-\nlish.html ) will be inspected in this category. To clarify the\nnature of high variety in Diglossic culture and directional\nequivalent, it is better to peruse some parts of this poem:\nArch, archangel; pray, does erring\nRhyme with herring or with stirring?\nPrison, bison, treasure trove,\nTreason, hover, cover, cove,\nPerseverance, severance, ribald\nRhyme, (but piebald doesn't) with nibbled\nPhaeton, paean, gnat, ghat, gnaw,\nLien, psychic, shone, bone, pshaw.\nDon't be down, my own, but rough it,\nAnd distinguish buffet, buffet;\nBrood, stood, roof, rook, school, wool, boon,\nWorcester, Boleyn, to impugn.\nSay in sounds correct and sterling\nHearse, hear, hearken, year, and yearling.\nEvil, devil, mezzotint,\nMind the Z! (A gentle hint)\nIn this poem, the translator encounters much trouble in\nthat he or she should consider, first, the purposive culture of\nthe source text into the TL context. Second, he or she should\nbridge the connection among the unconnected words in this\npoem to build the stable and well-balanced framework.\nThird, the translator should observe the rhyme and musical\nintonation of the poem, and finally, he or she should consider\nthe particular bystanders in this poem. Every line of the\npoem covers a sea of discrepancies and similarities that are\nnot easily treated in translation. The apex duty of the transla-\ntor is to simulate the real and exact situation for a high vari-\nety in Diglossic culture. These kinds of poems belong to the\nspecial group of people in that they seek to impress the reader\nby their delicacies, dulcetness, and connotational aspects of\nsemantic fields.\nIn the light of these explanations, natural and directional\nequivalences will be of high importance, in that they are\nperused to convince the reader about the vastness of culture.\nIn this connection, bridging the gap between the SL and its\ncounterpart will be highly recommendable in the NTS era.\nTherefore, translation studies should cover all aspects of\ntranslation and incline themselves to cultural approximation.\nCultural approximation (homogenization) causes people to\ninteract better, and it makes translation more tangible and\nfinally more perceivable.\nConclusion\nTo sum, cultural paradigm or CS in translation will be in an\nunstable position, and one has to decipher a well-balanced\nparadigm to persuade the TL reader. But the important factor\nis how the translator can pave the way in CS and then recon-\ncile this field to NTS. How will it be possible to approximate\ncultures so as to convey the main and exact sense of the SL\ncontext?\nThis article makes its effort to explain the characteristics\nof cultural paradigm in translation and then categorizes cul-\nture into four exact subgroups so as to prepare the situation\nfor the translator to opt for the exact subgroup of HomoKult\nModel of translation in his or her rendering. Therefore, per-\nsuasion of the reader by the exact choice is highly recom-\nmendable in NTS. Four categories of HomoKult Model of\ntranslation were determined as purposive culture, amelio-\nrated culture, circulated culture, and Diglossic culture. The\nintended categories are chronologically ordered at which\nthey remove any hierarchy of cultural domination in transla-\ntion. Therefore, should the translator observe the above-\nmentioned categories in his or her translation, the rendering\nremoves any suffering from untranslatability in this regard.\nUntranslatability arises when the translator does not know\nhow to determine his or her scopes and aims. To remove any\nvulnerable parts and inferences in NTS, the renderer should\ndetermine his scope of scrutinizations. This scope includes\nthe unit of translation. Unit of translation causes the render-\ning to be more stable and equilibrium-sided, and the transla-\ntor/interpreter can approximate to the target culture. In this\ndirection, culture is an asset in translation to make the pro-\ncess of rendering possible. Culture causes the translation to\nbe treated as an indispensable part of people's lives. Every\nsuccessful translation aims at depicting cultural homogeniza-\ntion in that it approximates the source reader to the target one\nso as to create natural interaction. It is possible when source\nand target cultures try to find and share their common\ngrounds, and ultimately, they seek to eliminate the barriers so\nas to create the homogenized translation.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAkbari, A.
