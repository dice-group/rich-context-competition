    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The patient-centered medical home has become a prominent\nmodel for reforming the way health care is delivered to patients. The\nmodel offers a robust system of primary care combined with practice\ninnovations and new payment methods. But scant information exists\nabout the extent to which typical US physician practices have\nimplemented this model and its processes of care, or about the factors\nassociated with implementation. In this article we provide the first\nnational data on the use of medical home processes such as chronic\ndisease registries, nurse care managers, and systems to incorporate\npatient feedback, among 1,325 small and medium-size physician practices.\nWe found that on average, practices used just one-fifth of the patient-\ncentered medical home processes measured as part of this study. We also\nidentify internal capabilities and external incentives associated with the\ngreater use of medical home processes.\nThe patient-centered medical home\nmodel of health care delivery sys-\ntem reform was featured promi-\nnently in the Affordable Care Act\nby the primary care specialty societies in 2007.\nIt has been endorsed by a broad coalition of\npurchasers, payers, providers, consumers, and\nother health care stakeholders.

The first two\nprinciples--that each patient have a personal\nphysician, and that the model reflect a whole-\nperson orientation in terms of the care pro-\nvided--anticipate that each patient will have an\nongoing relationship with a personal health care\nprovider who focuses on the whole person, not\non just one disease or body system.\nOur study addressed the next four principles,\nwhich emphasize the use of improved care proc-\nesses within the physician practice. One princi-\nple is that the personal physician lead a team of\nindividuals at the practice level who collectively\ntake responsibility for the ongoing care of pa-\ntients.\nA second principle is that care be coordinated\nand integrated across all elements of the health\ncare system and the community, facilitated by\nthe use of patient registries and health informa-\ntion technology, such as electronic health rec-\nThe People-to-People Health\nFoundation, Inc.\nDiane R.

The goal is to make care seamless and well\ncoordinated among physicians, hospitals, and\nother parts of the health system.\nA third principle is that the medical practice\nfocus on quality and safety. According to this\nprinciple, practices will use evidence-based de-\ncision support to help health care providers and\npatients arrive at optimal care decisions; infor-\nmation technology, such as electronic health rec-\nords and e-prescribing; performance feedback to\nphysicians; active engagement of the practice in\nquality improvement activities; patient educa-\ntion; and the incorporation of feedback from\npatients into providers' decision making.\nA fourth principle is that access increase. This\nfeature includes timely access to care and im-\nproved methods of communication, including\ne-mail and telephone communication between\npatients and physicians.\nThe final principle, payment reform, encapsu-\nlates changes in health care financing and physi-\ncian payment systems to support the other com-\nponents of the model. These changes are largely\nbeyond the control of the individual physician\npractice.\nAdoption Of Medical Home\nProcesses\nDespite widespread efforts to move forward rap-\nidly with pilot projects and implementation of\nthe patient-centered medical home, there are no\nsystematic data on the extent to which physi-\ncians have or have not incorporated the model\ninto their practices. In 2008 we published na-\ntional data on large primary care and multispeci-\nalty medical groups with twenty or more physi-\ncians and their use of \"medical home processes\"\nthat corresponded to four of the medical home\nprinciples: physician-directed medical practice;\ncoordinated and integrated care; quality and\nsafety; and enhanced access. Examples of medi-\ncal home processes included the use of electronic\nmedical records,use of nurse care managers,and\nactive engagement in quality improvement\nWe found that the use of medical home\nprocesses was low overall: The mean across\nall organizations was 35 percent of possible\nprocesses. Adoption was greatest for the largest\nmedical groups--those with more than 140\nphysicians--and for those owned by large enti-\nties such as hospitals that are most likely to have\ngreater resources.\nHowever, most US physicians do not practice\nin large medical groups. In fact, 35.1 percent of\nvisits to US office-based physicians are to solo\npractitioners, and 88 percent are to practices\nwith nine or fewer physicians.13 Implementing\nthe principles of the patient-centered medical\nhome in these smaller practices may be particu-\nlarly challenging because there are fewer staff\nand less resources to support implementation.14\nPublished studies on the adoption of medical\nhome processes in smaller practices are limited\nto just two states, Virginia and Massachusetts. In\nVirginia, most family medicine practices exhib-\nited some elements of the medical home model,\nbut few practices incorporated the full suite of\nmedical home characteristics.15 In Massachu-\nsetts, the prevalence of medical home capabil-\nities varied widely among 412 primary care prac-\ntices, and increased adoption was associated\nwith large practice size and affiliation with a\nlarger network of practices.16\nStudy Data And Methods\nThe data for this article come from a large na-\ntional survey, the National Study of Small and\nMedium-Sized Physician Practices, which pro-\nvides the first national data on the use of medical\nhome processes in practices that have 1\u00ad19 physi-\ncians.We examined processes that correspond to\nfour joint principles of the patient-centered\nmedical home: physician-directed medical prac-\ntice; care coordination and integration; quality\nand safety; and enhanced access. These national\ndata do not include measures of the other three\nfundamental principles--personal physician,\nwhole-person orientation, or payment reform--\nbut they do provide the most comprehensive\nperspective on the adoption of medical home\nprocesses to date.\nIn addition, building on our previous work\nwith large medical groups, we used multivariate\nregression analysis to identify internal capabil-\nities and external incentives that are associated\nwith greater use of medical home processes in\ngreater use of medical home processes would\nbe associated with having more internal resourc-\nes, such as a larger practice size or being owned\nby a hospital, and more external performance\nincentives, such as payments for higher-\nquality care.\nThe National Study of Small and Medium-\nSized Physician Practices was a forty-minute\ncross-sectional telephone survey conducted be-\nphysician or lead administrator of a national\nsample of physician practices that had 1\u00ad19\nphysicians. Respondents were paid $175 for their\ntime.\nSurvey Sample No publicly available data-\nbase of US physician practices exists.

The database is updated\ndaily using a combination of primary and secon-\ndary sources. IMS data are widely accepted and\nhave been used in dozens of studies published in\nPractices were eligible for the survey if they\nwere some combination of adult primary care\nproviders (family physicians, general internists,\nand general practitioners), cardiologists, endo-\ncrinologists, and pulmonologists.

The overall adjusted\nthe Aligning Forces for Quality communities and\nFor this article we restricted the analytic sam-\nple to a subset of 1,325 practices in which pri-\nmary care physicians were at least 33 percent of\nthe physicians in the practice. We used a re-\nstricted sample for two reasons. First, nearly\nall policy and research attention to date has been\non primary care-based medical homes. Second,\ndata indicate that at this time very few specialty\npractices provide \"primary care\" to a sizable per-\ncentage of their patients.24\nMeasurement Of Medical Home Processes\nTo measure physician-directed medical practice,\nwe asked about use of primary care teams, de-\nfined in the survey as \"a group of physicians and\nother staff who meet with each other regularly to\ndiscuss the care of a defined group of patients\nand who share responsibility for their care.\"\nTo measure care coordination and integration,\nquality and safety, and enhanced access, we used\nmultiple survey questions. Care coordination\nand integration comprised five domains or sub-\ncategories, including the use of an electronic\nmedical record, electronic access to clinical in-\nformation from specialists and hospitals, elec-\ntronic prescribing, the use of chronic disease\nregistries, and the use of nurse care managers\nfor severely ill patients.\nQuality and safety included questions span-\nning nine domains. Some domains emphasized\nthe use of clinical information technology,\nothers emphasized specially trained staff, while\nothers focused on the use of particular quality-\nimprovement strategies. Quality and safety proc-\ness measures encompassed a range of primary\ncare services including chronic care, clinical pre-\nventive services, and health promotion. We in-\ncluded measures oriented toward both providers\nand patients: guideline-based reminders at the\npoint of care and routine reminders for chronic\nillness care, and the incorporation of patient\nfeedback.\nEnhanced access encompassed two domains\nincluding the use of group visits and the use of\ne-mail for communication between physicians\nand patients.\nEach practice was assigned one point per do-\nmain if it passed a minimum threshold of 66 per-\ncent for that domain. Consistent with our previ-\nously published research, we chose the\n66 percent threshold in an effort to be rigorous\nin our definition--that is, conservative in esti-\nmating the extent of use of medical home\nprocesses.\nA summary medical home score was created\nfor each practice by adding the points across all\nseventeen domains. A mean value for use of proc-\nesses was also calculated for each of the four\npractice-size categories. Practices with one to\ntwo physicians were not asked about primary\ncare teams, so the possible medical home points\nranged from 0\u00ad16 for those practices, compared\nto 0\u00ad17 for all other size categories. For compa-\nrability across size categories, the final medical\nhome index for each practice was calculated as a\npercentage of the total possible points for that\npractice.\nPractice Capabilities And External Incen-\ntives Based on previous work and on a review of\nthe literature, we identified a number of factors\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Practice capabil-\nities included practice size, ownership, specialty\ncomposition, and patient demographics. Each of\nthese capabilities may affect the amount of re-\nsources available to a practice to invest in imple-\nmenting medical home processes.17,18 Four prac-\ntice-size categories were created based on\nnumber of physicians, with the expectation that\nlarger practices are more likely than smaller\npractices to use medical home processes.15,16\nOwnership by a larger entity has also been asso-\nciated with greater use of medical home proc-\nesses.12,16 We created two ownership categories:\nowned by physicians or owned by a larger entity\nsuch as a hospital or a health maintenance\norganization.\nBecause the medical home model requires co-\nordination between primary care and specialist\nphysicians, we included specialty composition of\nthe practice (multispecialty or primary care\nonly) as an independent variable. Finally, we\nincluded two measures of patient demographics:\npercentage of patients who are African American\nand percentage of patients with limited English\nproficiency, because practices caring for large\nnumbers of minority patients have reported\nlower payment levels and increased challenges\nExternal incentives thought to increase use of\nmedical home processes by physician practices\nincluded public reporting of practice data; pay-\nfor-performance; acceptance of some financial\nrisk for hospitalization costs incurred by the\npractice's patients; payer mix (having fewer\nMedicaid and uninsured patients); and care\nmanagement processes such as patient remind-\npublic reporting index (range: 0\u00ad2) was created\nfor each practice based on whether health plans\npublicly report practice data on patient satisfac-\ntion and clinical quality. A pay-for-performance\nindex (range: 0\u00ad3) was created based on whether\nthe practice had the opportunity to receive addi-\ntional income from external entities based on\nclinical quality scores, use of information tech-\nnology, and the efficient use of resources.\nTo measure payer mix, we included the per-\ncentage of annual revenues for patient care from\nMedicaid and low-income patients without in-\nsurance. Acceptance of financial risk for hospital\nexpenses was measured by multiplying the per-\ncentage of annual revenue from health mainte-\nnance organizations (including point-of-service,\nMedicaid managed care, and Medicare managed\ncare) by the percentage of patients for whom the\npractice accepted some financial risk for hospi-\ntal costs.\nIn our previous study of large medical groups,\nuse of care management processes for chronic\nillness was associated with use of similar proc-\nesses by health plans, which suggests that these\nefforts complement, rather than substitute for,\none another.20 In this study we asked partici-\npants whether the major health plans that in-\nsured their patients provided their practice with\nany of the following care management tools and\nresources for chronic illness: a list of patients,\nperformance data, patient reminders, patient ed-\nucators, and care managers. A single \"health\nplan activities index\" was created for each prac-\ntice (one point for each process used by health\nAnalysis We first examined the prevalence of\neach medical home process for the entire sample\nand calculated the mean value for the medical\nhome index, adding the points across all seven-\nteen categories.33,34 We then conducted bivariate\nanalyses by practice size, using chi-square tests.\nThe relationship between the overall medical\nhome index and practice capabilities and exter-\nnal incentives was then analyzed using linear\nregression.35 All analyses were weighted to re-\nflect the national population of practices pro-\nvided by IMS Health, adjusted for clustering in\nthe survey sample and the probability of selec-\ntion and nonresponse.\nLimitations Our unique national data set al-\nlowed for measurement of processes that corre-\nspond to four of the seven medical home princi-\nples. Our list of variables was extensive but not\nexhaustive. For example, our measures of en-\nhanced access did not include after-hours or\nweekend accessibility, use of advanced access\nprinciples, or electronic visits.\nIn addition, three joint principles were not\ncovered by our data: personal physician, whole-\nperson orientation, and payment reform. The\npersonal physician principle emphasizes the im-\nportance of continuous healing relationships.\nThis is a fundamental aspect of the medical home\nmodel, and the quality of these relationships\ncould differ by practice size.

The\nfinal joint principle, payment reform, addresses\nissues largely beyond the control of the individ-\nual practice. We did include payment incentives\nas independent variables in our regression\nmodels.\nOur study had other limitations. First, the ad-\njusted response rate for our national survey was\n63.2 percent. There was no statistically signifi-\ncant difference between respondents and non-\nrespondents according to practice size (the only\nvariable on which we could make comparisons).\nA higher response rate would be desirable, but\nthis rate is comparable to that in recently pub-\nlished physician surveys.\nSecond, the responses came from a single\nknowledgeable person within each practice\nand are self-reported. It is possible that the re-\nsults would differ if more people within the prac-\ntice had been queried or if use of the processes\nwere independently audited. Respondents may\nhave consciously or unconsciously overreported\ntheir use of medical home processes, so our re-\nsults shouldbeconsideredas theupperbound on\nthe extent of use.\nThird, the cross-sectional study design allows\nfor inferences of association but not causation.\nFourth, the IMS database is very large, is con-\ntinuously updated, and has no obvious bias. It\ntices (the American Medical Association states\nUnited States).37 There is no \"gold standard\" cen-\nsus of US practices to which the IMS Health data-\nbase can be compared. Our results should be\nconsidered broadly representative of the United\nStates, but we cannot claim that they are pre-\ncisely nationally representative.\nFinally, despite including a relatively extensive\nset of independent variables in our regression\nmodel, the R2 of 0.17 suggests that some varia-\ntion in the adoption of medical home processes\nis explained by factors not measured in our\nstudy, such as physician leadership.\nResults\nUse Of Medical Home Processes On average,\npractices earned 21.7 percent of the possible\npoints for use of medical home processes\n(Exhibit 1). Solo and two-physician practices\nused significantly fewer processes, compared\nto practices in larger size categories. These\nsmaller practices were also significantly less\nlikely to use processes facilitated by clinical in-\nformation technology, such as use of electronic\nmedical records, electronic prescribing, chronic\nillness registries, electronic records to collect\ndata for quality measures, and the use of clinical\ndecision support (Exhibits 2 and 3; see Appendix\nExhibits 1 and 2 for additional detail).38 They\nwere also significantly less likely to use the\nrapid-cycle quality improvement strategy and\nto participate in any quality improvement collab-\noratives.\nHowever, solo and two-physician practices\nwere significantly more likely to report that they\nincorporate feedback from patients and that\ntheir physicians communicate with patients via\ne-mail.\nThe prevalence of use of processes varied\nwidely by type of process, ranging from 73.3 per-\ncent for having electronic access to emergency\ndepartment notes to 2.4 percent for use of de-\npression care managers (Appendix Exhibits 1\nand 2).38 In general, the use of nurse care man-\nagers was low. Although one-quarter of practices\nused electronic medical records for progress\nnotes, only 9.5 percent regularly used electronic\nchronic disease registries, and only 8.7 percent\nreported that a majority of their physicians com-\nmunicated with patients via e-mail (Exhibit 2).\nPractice Capabilities And External Incen-\ntives Most practices were small, comprised only\nprimary care physicians, and were owned by\nphysicians, although larger practices were more\nlikely to be multispecialty and to be owned by a\nhospital or health maintenance organization\n(Exhibit 4).

This represents a substantial in-\ncrease over the mean medical home score of\n21.7 percent. Practices owned by a hospital\nor health maintenance organization scored\n2.23 percentage points higher compared to prac-\ntices owned by physicians or other entities.\nPractices exposed to external incentives--such\nas pay-for-performance; public reporting; and,\nto a much lesser extent, the assignment of some\nfinancial risk to the practice for the cost of its\npatients' hospital care--were also significantly\nmore likely to use more medical home processes.\nFor example, when other variables were held\nconstant, practices that had the opportunity to\nreceive extra income based on clinical quality,\nuse of information technology, and measures of\nefficiency scored 9.72 percentage points higher\non the medical home index compared to practic-\nes that had none of these pay-for-performance\nincentives.\nPatient demographics, payer mix, and use of\nchronic care management processes by health\nplans were not statistically significantly associ-\nated with the use of medical home processes.\nDiscussion\nThese are the first national data on the use of\nmedical home processes by small to medium-size\nphysician practices. We found that practices do\nuse these processes, but to a relatively limited\nextent.We also found that greater use of medical\nhome processes was independently associated\nwith measures of internal capabilities and also\nexternal incentives.\nOur findings that larger practices and those\nowned by hospitals or health maintenance or-\nganizations use more medical home processes\nare consistent with those of our previous na-\ntional study of large medical groups (twenty or\nmore physicians)15 and with studies in Massa-\nchusetts and Virginia.18,19 The external incentive\nmeasures used in this study are not directly com-\nparable to those in our previous studies of large\nUse Of Patient-Centered Medical Home Processes: Physician-Directed Medical Practice, Care Coordination, And Enhanced Access\nPractices using medical home processes (%)\nMeasures of medical home process\nTotal\nphysicians\nphysicians\nphysicians\nphysicians\nCriteria for medical\nhome index\nPhysician-directed medical practice\nCare coordination/integration\nElectronic access to clinical\ninformation\nleast 2 of 3 types of\ninformationf\ndiseasesg\nNurse care managers for chronic\ndisease\ndiseasesg\nEnhanced access\nMajority of physicians communicate\nSOURCE National Study of Small and Medium-Sized Physician Practices.

This\nstudy provides the first national data on the use\nof an important subset of medical home proc-\nesses by small and medium-size physician prac-\ntices--by far the most common size of practice in\nthe United States.\nAlthough no list of medical home processes is\ndefinitive, we measured a broad spectrum of rec-\nommended care processes targeting multiple as-\npects of the medical home model and found that\non average, one-fifth of these processes were in\nuse. Medical home advocates may view our find-\nings as a glass one-fifth full, or four-fifths empty.\nThe more optimistic will appreciate that these\nsmaller practices, typically situated in frag-\nmented care systems across the United States,\nhave already implemented some components of\nthe patient-centered medical home. Others will\nfocus on the low mean level of adoption of the\nmedical home processes measured here, placed\nin context of the complete practice transforma-\ntion required to realize the full vision of the\npatient-centered medical home. From this per-\nspective, widespread implementation appears\ndaunting.\nEither way, it appears that major changes will\nbe required if the patient-centered medical home\nis to be widely adopted. One response to the\nassociation between use of medical home proc-\nesses and size and ownership is to envision con-\nsolidation of smaller practices into larger enti-\nties. There is some evidence that the percentage\nof physicians working in larger practices and for\nhospitals is increasing.40 Yet small \"cottage in-\ndustry\" practices continue to play a major role in\nUS health care delivery. It is therefore incumbent\nupon health care leaders to identify and test\nUse Of Patient-Centered Medical Home Processes: Quality And Safety\nPractices using medical home processes (%)\nMeasures of quality and safety Total\nphysicians\nphysicians\nphysicians\nphysicians\nCriteria for medical\nhome index\nParticipate in any quality improvement\nCollect data from electronic records for\nat least 4 of 5 areasi\nSOURCE National Study of Small and Medium-Sized Physician Practices.

There is widespread\nagreement that payment reforms are integral\nto the success of the patient-centered medical\nhome, but little is known about the best method\nof payment or the optimal size of financial in-\ncentives.29,30 Multiple pilots and demonstrations\nare under way to determine the role of market\nincentives in driving practice change.\nA final strategy focuses on preparing the next\ngeneration of health care providers to practice\nin new care models. Although transforming\nexisting practices is not easy, transforming the\ntraditions of health professional education\npresents its own challenges. The American Asso-\nciation of Medical Colleges and numerous pro-\nfessional societies are providing leadership in\nthis area.\nThe patient-centered medical home is her-\nalded by a broad coalition of policy makers, pur-\nchasers, payers, providers, and consumer\ngroups as one particularly important element\nof reforming the US health care system.50 The\nimplementation of medical home processes by\nphysician practices will be essential to the suc-\ncess of the model. Also essential is the role of\nother stakeholders in overcoming the substan-\ntial financial, political, and professional barriers\nto delivering and receiving care that is easily\naccessible, focused on the whole patient over\ntime, coordinated across the care continuum,\nfacilitated by information technology and organ-\nized careprocesses, and informedby population-\nbased data on health outcomes and health care\ncosts. \nThe National Study of Small and\nMedium-Sized Physician Practices was\nfunded by the Robert Wood Johnson\nauthors thank IMS for providing the\npopulation for medical practices from\nits database from which the survey\nsample was drawn. They also thank\nDaniel J. Gottlieb and William B. Weeks\nfrom Dartmouth Medical College for\ntheir assistance in compiling the IMS\npopulation for sampling, and Kennon R.\nCopeland at the National Opinion\nResearch Center, University of Chicago,\nfor consultation concerning weighting.\nNOTES\n1 Rittenhouse DR, Shortell SM.
