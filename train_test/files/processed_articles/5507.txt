However, the use of\nemerging technologies in monitoring employee practices is\nraising concerns that the privacy rights of employees are vul-\nnerable, and it is becoming more challenging to balance\nemployer security rights with employee privacy issues\n(Mathis & Jackson, 2000). Consequently, significant privacy\nissues are being debated in business and government, for\nexample, (a) violation of privacy: examining and retrieving\nprivate e-mails, records, and information about employees\nfrom their access to particular Internet websites; (b) com-\nputer monitoring: continually knowing where the employee\nis; (c) computer matching: synthesizing information obtained\nfrom different sources to enhance your marketing services;\nand (d) unauthorized personnel files: gathering telephone\nnumbers, e-mail addresses, credit card numbers, and other\nprivate information to develop customer profiles (O'Brien &\nMarakas, 2006). Technological advancements enabled\nemployers to enhance employee productivity and put\nemployee privacy under siege. Robbins and Coulter (1999)\npresented some perplexing questions, such as the following:\n1. Is the e-mail system for business purposes only?\n2. Is an employee allowed to e-mail work information\nto a colleague along with some personal chatting?\n3. What is the acceptable use of the system?\n4. Who possesses the information that is produced from\nthe network?\nOrganizations regulate Internet use, or website visits by\ntheir workforce, through two regular ways: by restricting\naccess to particular links, and by monitoring employee\nactions (Alampay & Hechanova, 2010). In this study, it also\nis revealed that monitoring policies and controlling websites\nvary from one country to another; for example, China,\nVietnam, and Singapore not only block certain sites but also\nproscribe access to political and linguistic affairs. Everett,\nWong, and Paynter (2006) found that a significant number of\nsubjects related to employee and employer rights should be\ntaken into consideration in further studies: (a) A significant\nissue is concerned with building trust between employers\nand employees in the workplace; another vital topic is linked\n1Rajamangala University of Technology Lanna, ChiangMai, Thailand\nCorresponding Author:\nMahmoud Moussa, Rajamangala University of Technology Lanna, 105/13\nEmail: rmutlhrd@gmail.com\nMonitoring Employee Behavior Through\nthe Use of Technology and Issues of\nEmployee Privacy in America\nMahmoud Moussa1\n Keywords\nemployee, employer, information, monitoring, privacy, organization\n2 SAGE Open\nwith the establishment of pertinent legislation that manages\nprivacy issues in workplace surveillance forthrightly; (b) a\nthorny factor is the growing occurrence of satellite, commu-\nnal facility, and work at home, which urge employers to\nmonitor their employees; (c) the diversification and capaci-\nties of the Internet for communication provide new topics for\nresearch; (d) the possibility to proscribe all small electronic\ndevices in the workplace that could be used to e-mail firms'\nsecrets to an external beneficiary; and (e) enlarging the inter-\nnational comparison and probing the rising position of inter-\nnational standards and \"harmonization agreements,\"\nconcerning policies developed by the European Union and\nthe United Nations, as well as standards propagated by the\nInternational Organization for Standardization, the national\ndefense agencies, and government branches of criminal\ninvestigation.\nEverett et al. (2006) referred to certain issues potentially\nleading to greater employer use of the perception that such\nmonitoring is needed. For example, government efforts to\ncrush terrorism, assuage the proliferation of govern nuclear\nweapons knowledge, hinder money laundering, and limit\ndrug traffickers, both unlawful and pharmaceutical. More\nrecently, employers have begun tracking their employees by\nusing global positioning system (GPS) technology, which\nuses an assemblage of satellites to specify the precise loca-\ntion of the GPS-enabled device. Therefore, Townsm and\nCobb (2012) recommended realistic steps when applying\nGPS tracking as follows: incorporate GPS tracking with\nother policies; preserve the right to monitor; do not create a\nconclusive evidence with GPS tracking documents; limit the\nuse of GPS technology to monitor; rigorously outline appro-\npriate use of company cell phones, vehicles, and so on;\ndevelop a consent language; continually check GPS equip-\nment; and consider safeguarding records.\nAnother study by Ciocchetti (2011) classified each of the\ntop monitoring practices into one of the following types: (a)\nbest practices (e.g., monitoring that presents the greatest pro-\ntection and minimizes invasion of employee privacy), (b)\nrisky practices (e.g., monitoring that offers rather low protec-\ntion and minimally attacks employee privacy), (c) borderline\npractices (e.g., monitoring that provides high protection, yet\nis also highly insidious), and (d) poor practices (e.g., moni-\ntoring that provides low protection and is extremely inva-\nsive). This classification system is likely to assist lawmakers\nto balance both employer and employee interests when legal-\nizing workplace technology. Ciocchetti viewed that the\nAmerican legal system has been sluggish to react effectively\nand efficiently to the increasing invasiveness of modern\nmonitoring technology and that all monitoring practices are\ndisturbing and fall into the four categories just mentioned.\nHowever, Bennett and Locke (1998) stated that an effective\nway to avoid liability for privacy assault is to presuppose that\nif an employee can litigate for such a tort, the employee will.\nResearch showed that employees can find an inclusive\nsource of privacy protection resulting from the common law\nright to privacy, which consists of three misdeeds relevant to\nthe employment relationship: intrusion on seclusion, which\narises an encroachment is an intrusion on the property of\nanother without that person's permission; publicity given to\none's private life, which exists when an individual gives pub-\nlicity to an issue regarding the private life of another; and\npublicity placing a person in a false light, which occurs when\nan individual heedlessly disregards the falsity of the revealed\nissue and the false light in which the other person would be\nplaced (Hames & Diersen, 1991). Alternatively, a set of\nreforms developed by Conlon (1997) protect individual pri-\nvacy concerns in the workplace:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 No monitoring should be done in restrooms, locker\nrooms, and employee lounges; however, time spent\noutside the workplace can be monitored in less odious\nways.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Offsite monitoring should be banned; allow employ-\nees to access all information collected through moni-\ntoring methods or techniques and consider their\nreflection on such information; and limit the duration\nof monitoring each day with a suggested (maximum\nof 2 hr per day).\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Employees should be aware of the devices that will be\nused to monitor them, how the data will be used, and\nwhen exactly they will be monitored; and employees\nand customers should be notified when telephonic\nmonitoring is taking place through the use of a spe-\ncific tone that can be heard by both employee and\ncustomer.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Employers should collect only information relevant to\nmaking critical decisions; and it is not enough to jus-\ntify monitoring by the need to increasing productivity\nor enhancing performance, but also, employers should\nbe able to demonstrate how the goal was accom-\nplished through the monitoring process.\nHowsoever, the lawful foundation of the right to privacy\nhas a theoretical underpinning for legal intellectuals that may\nbecomplexforthepublictorecognizeorvalue(C.L.Swanson,\n1988). Despite the different schools of thought among aca-\ndemics, numerous propositions have been offered for manage-\nment's contemplation: formulate why, how, and when\nelectronic monitoring is applied; gather only work-related\ninformation; gather only information for the purpose of raising\nemployee performance; provide timely feedback to employees\nso that corrective actions to performance can be done; secure\nawards to individuals or group performance; educate employ-\nees about the behavioral and social features of electronic mon-\nitoring; accentuate qualitative characteristics of performance\nnot accounted for by electronic monitoring; a trial period for\nall new applicants or new electronic systems should be pro-\nvided; avoid being too quick in developing new standards or\nmonitoring methods unless proven to be effective; and use\nbrainstorming sessions whenever possible to enhance the\nelectronic monitoring system in the organization (Vaught,\nTaylor, & Vaught, 2000). Nevertheless, too much monitoring\nand the publicity of a monitoring culture throughout the\norganization may create emotional and behavioral problems\nthat may ultimately thrust employees in to certain activities\nIntriguingly, Dillon and Thomas (2006) exposed that\nthere is a great need for universal consciousness and indul-\ngence of accessibility, personal use, and administrative over-\nsight issues involving e-mail and computers in the workplace;\notherwise, employees are unlikely to understand privacy\npolicies and procedures adequately. Wen, Schwieger, and\nGershuny (2007) reviewed surveillance technologies and\ndiscussed the related federal and state laws along with U.S.\njudicial decisions, and found that no U.S. federal or state law\nprohibits employers from monitoring their electronic work-\nplace. Their scientific investigation also provided the follow-\ningstrategiesthatarelikelytobemosteffectiveandproductive\nfor both employees and employers, and help employers pre-\nvent the negative aspects of monitoring: designating privacy\npolicy oversight and execution should be implemented by an\nauthority; consider a legal stand-point to legally guide the\ndevelopment of all policies and procedures; develop a formal\npolicy and keep all employees informed of all modifications\nto the policy; notify employees of the electronic monitoring\nsystem; avoid an aggressive work environment; develop clear\nrules on the use of e-mail; decide which data should and\nshould not be accessed; specify online time limits; maintain a\nsoftware running in the background of every computer, such\nas popup blockers or spam filters; and communicate a policy\nthat is acceptable for instant messaging, blogging, and chat\nroom use in and out of the organization.\nHaller (2002) also proposed the main ingredients of effec-\ntive privacy policies: (a) notice, firms should provide stake-\nholders with a prominent notice vis-\u00e0-vis its information\npractices; (b) consumer choice, firms should give stakehold-\ners the freedom to choose whether it may divulge personal\ndata about them to unaffiliated third parties; (c) access and\ncorrection, firms should accept their stakeholders to make\nsome corrections if necessary about personal data that they\nhave gathered about them; (d) security, firms should espouse\npractical security measures to protect the privacy of personal\ninformation, and these measures may comprise administra-\ntive, physical, and technical security; and (e) enforcement,\nfirms should develop a system that can enforce its privacy\npolicy and ensure compliance with their own and external\nstandards. Moreover, maintaining a balance between employ-\ners' propensity to productivity and compliance with legisla-\ntive procedures, corporations may be most successful in\npracticing the following: creating unambiguous privacy\nboundaries, developing privacy formula and principles, and\ndefending personal data (Townsend & Bennett, 2003).\nEmployers are less vulnerable regarding certain issues of\ninvasion of privacy, if written policies are communicated\neffectively; however, Kovach, Jordan, Tansey, and Framinan\n(2000) argued that too much monitoring generates a work-\nplace filled with gridlock, blame, cynicism, and distrust.\nPractically speaking, to circumvent violations of employee\nprivacy in the workplace, employers should never promote a\nculture of privacy within every quarter of an organization\nbecause it may be essential to monitor some practices when\nissues occur (Guffey & West, 1996). An ethical employer\nwill monitor employees' work within the provisions of a par-\nticular policy (Cowan, 2008). Corporations must enroll if\nthey are coping with personal information for any of the fol-\nlowing purposes: private investigation, health administra-\ntion, policing crime avoidance and trial of delinquents, legal\nservices, debt administration, trading, public casework, edu-\ncation, research, administration of justice, consultancy ser-\nvices, or a credit reporting system (Grupe, Kuechler, &\nSummed up briefly, Zachary (2013) acknowledged the\nfollowing: Workplace encroachment to privacy is of immense\nconcern to both employers and employees in the United\nStates, and violation of privacy has been augmented in\nemployment proceedings. Invasion of privacy may fall into\nfour categories: (a) information leakage that denigrates oth-\ners, (b) using someone else's name without consent, (c) inap-\npropriate communication of private data, and (d) when a\nperpetrator purposefully intrudes, physically, electronically,\nor otherwise, on the private space of others. Courts vary\naccording to when the illegal intrusion exists, and employers\nshould be extremely vigilant to dissimilar types of invasion\nof privacy. Remarkably, disputes to privacy rights in the\nUnited States, which some view as a threat to eroding pri-\nmary American values, have had an upsurge in controversy\nover the degree to which rights formerly untouched may are\nreduced because of the employer\u00ademployee relationship\n(Anton & Ward, 1998). In the following section, the author\npresents possible alternatives to electronic performance\nmonitoring (EPM).\nDefinitions of, Critiques of,\nand Alternatives to, Electronic\nPerformance Monitoring (EPM)\nAccording to Belcourt, Bohlander, and Snell (2008),\nemployee monitoring acts involve monitoring Internet links,\nreview of e-mails, telephone use, video surveillance for secu-\nrity purposes, storage and review of computer files, video\nrecording of employee job performance, recording and review\nof telephone conversations, and storage and review of voice-\nmail messages. Dessler (2011) noted that EPM systems are\nintended to allow employers access to their employees' com-\nputers and telephones to monitor the amount of time spent\nworking on the Internet, to enhance productivity. This paradox\nnecessitates the establishment of a security system for all data\ngarnered by employers to thwart the theft of sensitive informa-\ntion, particularly to those outside the organization (Mello,\n2006). In a similar vein, new information technologies allow\n4 SAGE Open\nemployers to monitor employee work performance, even\nwhen the employee is not notified about the monitoring pro-\ncess (Nelson & Quick, 2006). Nonetheless, Mathis and\nJackson (1997) verified that employee performance is not\ndriven by management, but eventually by the employees\nthemselves. For instance, ethical behavior is not based solely\non the decisions and actions of an organization's authorities,\nbut also encompasses the actions of every employee (Dlabay,\nBurrow, & Eggland, 2006). They construed that ethical\nbehavior consists of the actions of individuals and groups\nand the results of those actions.\nMoreover, performance criteria for measuring job perfor-\nmance can be categorized as \"trait-based,\" \"behavior-\nbased,\" or \"results-based.\" However, courts in the United\nStates declared and affirmed that evaluations based on traits\nsuch as flexibility are too blurred and indistinct (Mathis &\nJackson, 1997). Although it can be argued that employers\nshould measure performance criteria in terms of time versus\nproductivity. In other words, employees can be paid or com-\npensated for time spent on particular tasks or on the amount\nof work produced. Aside from this, Mathis and Jackson\nclaimed that a performance evaluation should be contem-\nplated regarding assessment to achieve its purpose objec-\ntively and subjectively. Objective measures may be in terms\nof counted quantities or amounts; whereas, subjective mea-\nsures may be apposite for casual or informal mistakes. Other\nperformance measures acknowledged by Mathis and Jackson\n(2000) were category rating methods, a graphic rating scale,\na checklist, or a combination of methods. Employers should\narticulate what they want to accomplish from a performance\nappraisal system to obtain the desired advantages with regard\nto perceptions and rights of the organization's employees.\nComprehensively, Dessler (2003) discussed achievable\nand indispensable factors that might lead to developing a\nlegally justifiable performance appraisal system, as follows:\n(a) make certain what a successful performance means,\nundertake a job analysis to recognize the critical require-\nments needed, and amalgamate these criteria into a rating\ntool; (b) define job performance magnitude, write and com-\nmunicate performance criteria to all employees and employ-\ners, and avoid broad terms, such as \"integrity\" and\n\"hardworking,\" unless you can lead by example or model the\nbehavior you desire; (c) use subjective supervisory ratings as\nonly one part of the overall evaluation process, train evalua-\ntors how to use the rating instrument effectively, authorize\nevaluators to approach the employees they are evaluating,\nand conclude your evaluation on different measures for each\nof the job's performance criteria; (d) have more than one\nevaluator and perform all evaluations independently to\nreduce biases and errors, employees should be given the\nfreedom to review their appraisals and make comments\nbefore completion, and supplement your personnel decisions\nwith documents and reasons; and (e) whenever possible, pro-\nvide supervision to aid low performers at work. In addition,\na workforce should attempt to be consciously and intently\naware of the idea that high-performance work systems are\nlikely to fail without timely and accurate communication\nNorton (2006) disclosed that people should realize that\ntheir interests and practices are being monitored automati-\ncally and routinely because the monitoring can be accom-\nplished through programs running on their computers or a\nconnected server. Norton also reported that\nthere are commercial profiles for most people in the United\nSates based on the browsing activity of a particular IP address.\nThis address is tied to the name of the owner of that address no\nmatter who is doing the actual browsing. The reports contain\ninformation about browsing habits and may contain\naccompanying marketing conclusions, called psychographic\nComputer technology today supports many performance\nmanagement systems, and employers frequently accumulate\nrecords of employee performance measures, punitive actions,\nand work rule violations in electronic files (Noe, Hollenbeck,\nGerhart, & Wright, 2007). They also added that Congress has\ndeveloped laws to legalize computer monitoring, but in the\nmeantime, employers should consider employee feedback to\nthis type of performance analysis. Once critical issue is that\nsocial forecasting, opinion surveys, social audits, issue man-\nagement, and social/executive scanning can systematically\nmeasure the economic performance of an organization\n(Bartol & Martin, 1991). Thus, here, the author argues that\nmany alternatives to electronic monitoring may be effective\nand are likely to satisfy an employer's vision or objectives\nwithout violating rights of privacy. Employers should not\ndisregard the three feasible interpretations of the job satisfac-\ntion and performance relationship: satisfaction leads to per-\nformance, performance leads to satisfaction, and rewards\nlead to both performance and satisfaction (Schermerhorn,\nOther alternatives to electronic monitoring may include\nthe primary measures of productivity, such as total product\n(TP), the highest level of outcome that can be accomplished\nwithin a specific amount of inputs; average product (AP), an\nassessment of the outcome achieved per unit of input; and\nmarginal product (MP), the change in total output divided by\nthe change in capital (Baye, 2009). Arguably, employers who\njustify electronic monitoring by boosting productivity in the\nworkplace may want to exercise the following: assuage or\neliminate bureaucracy, revise all systems and recognize high\nquality employees, overcome problems, share your vision\nthroughout the organization, question your employees and\nlisten to them carefully, be honest and have integrity, turn\ncustomers into strategic partners, and develop effective per-\nWhat is more, the increasing use of e-mail and voice-mail\naugmented every employer's risks of being legally respon-\nsible if they monitor or check employee electronic communi-\ncations. As a result, the Electronic Communications Privacy\nAct (ECPA) was passed in 1986. This is the only federal law\nthat has permitted listening to, or detecting, employee elec-\ntronic communication for business purposes, only if there is\nconsent provided by the employee for this act (Mathis &\nJackson, 2000). Although the ECPA proscribed the inten-\ntional interception of employees' oral, wire, and electronic\ncommunication, it included two significant workplace excep-\ntions, which are as follows:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The \"business purpose exception,\" which constitutes\nconsent to monitoring as long as the employer is capa-\nble of showing genuine business reasons for this\naction.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The \"consent exception\" allows employers to monitor\nemployee communications when employees have\ngiven their permission to do so (Dessler, 2011; Mello,\nAccording to the Bureau of National Affairs (2012),\nIn the United States, only Maryland, Illinois, and California\nhave laws that limit employer access to employee social media\naccounts. Fourteen states considered such legislation in 2012,\naccording to materials provided at the webcast, and federal bills\nhave been introduced. (p. 8)\nThe close auspices and supervision by employers are, per-\nhaps, the major benefit from an electronic monitoring sys-\ntem; however, some employees appreciate them because\nthey benefit them, whereas others consider them a violation\nhigh-technology monitoring devices can be useful with\nemployees who carry out quantifiable tasks during working\nhours, such as employees in financial institutions and call\ncenters. Another view presented by Robbins and Coulter\n(1999) was that many individuals consider electronic moni-\ntoring as just a technologically complicated type of eaves-\ndropping, or a surveillance method to catch employees who\nare practicing illegal activities during their working hours.\nCritics also declare that electronic monitoring can backfire\nand raise employee stress because of being watched continu-\nally (Dessler, 2011). The next part of this article is a discus-\nsion of some reasons behind employee monitoring and\nleadership behaviors in organizations.\nMotives Behind Employee Monitoring\nand Leadership Behaviors\nBelcourt et al. (2008) found that motives behind employee\nmonitoring are varied, such as, to prevent inappropriate\nactions of employees; to emphasize the need for the effective\nuse of the organization's time; to minimize employee gossip;\nto abolish the viewing of pornographic webpages; and to\nprotect employees' personnel information from becoming\naccessible to hackers who are likely to use the information\ninappropriately. Moreover, abuses by some employees, such\nas using the organization's computer for gambling, engaging\nin private businesses, playing computer games, or pursuing\npersonal affairs, have led to many employers engaging in a\ngreater policing role (DeCenzo & Robbins, 2005). However,\nmonitoring systems can be used to accumulate, process, and\ngive performance feedback about employees' work that can\nassist managers with performance improvement propositions\nand with employee development (Robbins & Coulter, 1999).\nEmployers justify their interference into employee privacy\nby stating their genuine interest in some of the employees'\npersonal matters, especially when those matters such as drug\nand alcohol use, criminal activity, or dating a colleague may\ndirectly affect workplace productivity, safety, and ethical\nAnother significant issue is that employers need to moni-\ntor decision execution to ensure that things are making prog-\nress as planned, and that problems have been identified and\nresolved (Bartol & Martin, 1991). Today, monitoring is far\nbeyond spying on employees' phones and e-mails. For\ntoring has become pervasive, which involves following the\nlocation and movement of employees, because as DuBrin\n(2006) stated, a major factor to electronic monitoring is that\nemployees often work far from their managers, including at\nhome, hotels, or in coffee shops. One solid reason behind\nmonitoring employees is that employers can be sued for what\ntheir employees send to each other and to individuals outside\nthe organization (Haag & Cummings, 2010; Mathis &\nJackson, 2000). Haag and Cummings also enumerated\nemployers'motives behind seeking and storing personal data\nabout their employees, such as the need to recruit the best\nstaff possible and prevent being charged for employees'\npractices in the organization, and to ensure that employees\nare not wasting or misusing the organization' s resources.\nThey reported the FBI's statement that 78% of selected orga-\nnizations indicated that employees download pornography,\npirate software, and engage in other activities unrelated to\ntheir work, and 60% of employees use the Internet for per-\nsonal use at work. Organizations reportedly lost $5.3 billion\nEmployee monitoring is intended to measure the amount\nof work produced, to check for theft, or to enforce an organi-\nzation's rules and policies (Mathis & Jackson, 1997). Experts\nhave estimated that employee theft (e.g., theft of merchan-\ndise, embezzlement, industrial espionage, computer crime,\nacts of sabotage, and misuse of time on the job) causes U.S.\nbusinesses to spend more than $400 billion annually (Gomez-\nMejia, Balkin, & Cardy, 2004). Therefore, employers are\nstruggling to fight against various types of theft by using\nelectronic surveillance gadgets to monitor employees, which\nsome would call spying on employees. Gomez-Mejia et al.\n(2004) urged employers to do the following: provide guide-\nlines to all employees for the rules regarding exchanging\nmessages and information, and the acceptable use of the\n6 SAGE Open\nInternet; discover positive uses for electronic monitoring\ntools that are valuable and advantageous to both employers\nand employees; create an \"antitheft policy\" and post it\nthroughout the organization; and prevent secret monitoring,\nexcept in specific cases (i.e., only with a court order).\nIn addition, technology has facilitated employees acting\nin immoral, irrelevant, and illegal ways, which created ethi-\ncal, productivity, and legal dilemmas for organizations and\nforced employers to monitor employee practices (Belcourt\nWork rules that are too strict or confining will impede the\nfulfillment of such human needs as those for affiliation,\ncooperation, autonomy, and self-actualization and may lead to\nsubterfuge and resentment. Rules that are too lax may lead to\ninefficiencies as well as moral problems. Work rules that tend to\nprotect jobs, may provide job security in the short run but, if too\nrestrictive, may have serious consequences for organizational\nIn addition, several court decisions acknowledged an\navowed policy of monitoring employees and employers of\nboth private and public sectors to conduct workplace investi-\ngation for theft and other banned practices (Mathis &\ntions are now using such technology that can be used to mon-\nitor not only Internet usage but also e-mails, computer files,\nvoice-mail, and telephone usage (Mello, 2006).\nIt also has been found that employees waste time when\nthey extend lunch periods, when they use the telephone for\npersonal matters, when they abuse sick leave, when they use\nunauthorized absenteeism, or when they work for another\nemployer on their primary employer's time. Thus, Gomez-\nMejia et al. (2004) noted that employers use unseen micro-\nphones and transmitters linked to telephones and tiny fish\neye video lenses fixed behind pinholes in walls and ceilings\nto spy on employees to eradicate such wastage. Needless to\nsay, many employees consider this close management and\nsupervision very dehumanizing (Stair & Reynolds, 2008).\nThus, it can be said that overwhelmingly, monitoring has a\ndubious reputation because of cases of abuse and overuse.\nBaltzan and Phillips (2009) mentioned that a primary goal of\ninformation technology monitoring is tracking employee\nassignments by such measures as the frequency of errors\nmade on a particular task and the number of tasks performed\nwithin a specific period.\nAbove all, two pertinent questions should be taken into con-\nsideration in organizations that advocate and implement moni-\ntoring technology: (a) What does this technology add to the\norganization? and (b) Does the organization trust its employ-\nees?According to Gomez-Mejia et al. (2004), augmenting trust\ncan be difficult, particularly in organizations with a culture of\ncynicism. There are many arguments about centralization ver-\nsus decentralization management approaches, in the sense\nwhere employees may have maximum restrictions concerning\noperations and minimum autonomy, or minimum restrictions\nand maximum autonomy. Furthermore, corporations should\ncontinually obtain answers to the following questions\n(McCalman & Paton, 1992): How autonomous are the sys-\ntems? What relationships exist? How relevant are they? Will\ndevelopments lead to re-definition of boundaries? Can the\ncomplexities of the change environment be simplified?\nHaving determined the general environment, employers\ncould then emphasize irrelevancies or deficiencies in the sys-\ntem as a whole.\nUndoubtedly, the rise of technology causes ethical chal-\nlenges in organizations. The rise and the use of technology\ncohere with and emerge from an organizational culture, val-\nues, and leadership style. Yet, relatively little effort has been\nmade to study and compare leadership approaches systemati-\ncally, in the context of how leaders should react to employee\nmonitoring through technology. Luthans and Doh (2009)\ndistinguished between three types of leadership as follows:\n(a) authoritarian leadership (e.g., the use of one-way com-\nmunication from top to bottom with an emphasis on work\nprogress and procedures that diminish work output, and final\ndecisions usually made by the upper-level of management);\n(b) paternalistic leadership, or belief in reciprocity (e.g.,\nwork hard and the organization will offer a person more\nbonuses); and (c) participative leadership (e.g., authority is\ngreatly decentralized). Certo and Certo (2009) also distin-\nguished between four types of leadership as follows: (a)\nsuperleadership (i.e., leading by example), (b) servant lead-\nership (i.e., the perception that a leader's primary duty is to\nhelp subordinates to fulfill their desires, or interests), (c)\nentrepreneurial leadership (i.e., the perception that the leader\nis self-employed), and (d) transformational leadership (i.e.,\nleadership that has the capability to inspire organizational\nsuccess and influence followers' beliefs in what can shape a\nsuccessful organization.\nAccordingly, the focal point is that the most effective\nleadership style to monitor employee performance using\ntechnology remains unidentified. Predominantly, the behav-\niors of employers are being scrutinized, and corporate gover-\nnance models increasingly commit to selecting only those\nwith high ethical conducts to be held responsible for their\npractices and the consequences of those practices (Griffin,\nelectronic monitoring has posed serious questions about how\nit may lead to a great deal of stress and dehumanizing effects\non employees. The following is related to strategies that may\nreduce stress resulting from monitoring practices in\norganizations.\nAdvice That Makes Monitoring Less\nDistressful\nFirst, Griffin (2008) succinctly presented causes and conse-\nquences of stress. Griffin elaborated that \"organizational\nstressors\" involve (a) task demands (i.e., rapid decisions,\ninadequate information for decisions, and critical decisions),\n(b) physical demands including environmental factors (e.g.,\npoor offices, temperature), (c) role demands (i.e., role con-\nflict and role ambiguity), and (d) interpersonal demands (i.e.,\ngroup pressures, leadership paradigms, and disharmony\namong individuals). Griffin added that the consequences of\nstress can be both positive and negative, and the negative\nones involve behavioral, psychological, or medical matters.\nLogically, employee level of satisfaction, motivation, com-\nmitment, loyalty, and integrity in the workplace can be\naffected as a result of extreme levels of stress. The crucial\npoint here is that the use of EPM has created a great deal of\ntension and pressure among individuals in organizations.\nNelson and Quick (2006) made three recommendations that\ncan help make electronic workplace monitoring less distress-\nful. These include orientating employees about the monitor-\ning system; setting fair performance standards; and using\ndocumentation, or records, for benign purposes rather than\nfor sanctions. Alternatively, another school of thought articu-\nlated that reducing stress causes some problems for employ-\ners; thus, stress is recommended for healthy organizations\nand without it, employees lack energy (DeCenzo & Robbins,\nprised of two types: (a) \"constructive stress,\" and sometimes\ncalled \"eustress,\" is personally energizing and performance-\nenhancing, urges greater endeavors, inspires creativity, and\nenhances commitment, while still not devastating the indi-\nvidual or causing undesirable consequences, and (b)\n\"destructive stress,\" which arises when there is a severe\nstress that may affect an individual's physical and mental\nsystems and lead to job burnout or aggressive behavior\ntoward others in the workplace.\nDeCenzo and Robbins (2005) discovered employee\ninvolvement and participation, making certain that employ-\nees are properly matched in their jobs and fully aware of the\nextent of their authority, and familiarizing them with what is\nexpected are all factors that eliminate stress, conflict, and\nambiguity in organizations. Similarly, two-way communica-\ntion and employee involvement in the structural system or\nframe reduce stress and enhance perceptions of fairness or\njustice (Mathis & Jackson, 1997). However, we should dif-\nferentiate between three types of organizational justice: (a)\ndistributive justice--derived from the evaluation of the prod-\nuct of the business interactions; (b) procedural justice--\nderived from the procedures, or actions that generate the\nresults; and (c) interactional justice--derived from the eval-\nuation of the communication process used in business con-\ntacts (Ferrell, Fraedrich, & Ferrell, 2009).\nPortolese-Dias and Shah (2009) noted that employers can\nlisten to employees' telephone communication, monitor\ne-mail in a search for clandestine trade, listen to harassing\nmessages, monitor non-work related traffic, and monitor\nconflicts of interest. In short, to deal with the latent vulnera-\nbilities where information technology (IT) negatively affects\nthe satisfaction of employees, management needs to consider\nthat employee satisfaction should be the highest priority and\nstrategic objective (Thompson & Cats-Baril, 2003). Toward\nthis end, privacy and security issues are contemporary chal-\nlenges that IT individuals and businesspeople must confront\nand understand. Next, employee monitoring policies will be\ndiscussed.\nEmployee Monitoring Policies\nThe frequent anxiety in a monitored organization is generally\nnot whether monitoring should take place, but how it should\nbe performed, how the information should be utilized, and\nhow feedback should be communicated to all individuals in\nthe organization. However, employers should reduce ethical\nconcerns by considering the following policies: (a) Voice-\nmail, e-mail, and computer files provided by the organization\nare solely for business purposes, (b) all computer passwords\nmust be accessible to the employer, and (c) the employer has\nthe right to monitor any practice without prior notification\nfor business purposes only (Mathis & Jackson, 1997).\nDeCenzo and Robbins (2005) succinctly stated that whatever\nemployers consider reasonable, they should proffer for\nemployees in a written policy. The main theory behind com-\nmunicating employers' policies to all employees is that\nemployees are more likely to accept electronic monitoring if\ntheir employers' main purpose is to improve performance\n(Noe, Hollenbeck, Gerhart, & Wright, 2007).\nSimilarly, electronic monitoring seems preferable when\npolicy statements create expectations of job performance in\nthe mind of the employee (French, 1994). Thus, the best path\nfor an organization planning to engage in employee monitor-\ning involves open communication; formulating the appropri-\nate monitoring policies and putting them into practice; and\nunequivocally stating how, when, and where the company\nmonitors its employees (Baltzan & Phillips, 2009). In other\nwords, Belcourt et al. (2008) informed that human resources\nexperts and legal authorities strongly encourage employers\nto develop clear policies that elucidate how e-mail and the\nInternet are to be used, including when and under what cir-\ncumstances employees can be monitored. Thus, employees\ncould realize that the use of their organization's Internet to\nshop, browse, view inappropriate webpages, or conduct per-\nsonal business during work hours is an illegal action that is\nlikely to cause undesirable consequences.\nshould develop a lucid and succinct policy and communicate\nit to all employees, if they choose to monitor their employ-\nees' use of telecommunications equipment. Above and\nbeyond, monitoring should be consistent with both the over-\nall objectives of the organization and performance dilem-\nmas; nonetheless, employers' policies should not create\nstress and distrust on their employees. From a moral and\nlegal perspective, employers need to consider the following\ntasks to minimize potential revelation to lawsuits: (a) develop\nan electronic communication policy, (b) notify employees\nand have them sign a consent form, and (c) rigorously\n8 SAGE Open\nimplement every segment of the policy and monitor usage\nfor business practices only (Mathis & Jackson, 2000).\nAnother ethical dilemma is the balancing of improvements\nin productivity and efficiency versus dehumanization of the\nworkplace (Thompson & Cats-Baril, 2003).\nNot surprisingly, there are variations in how employers\nexpect their employees to use computers in a working day;\ntherefore, employees should be informed of the rules and\nconsent to abide by them (Baltzan & Phillips, 2009).\nNevertheless, people will continue to live on the edge of\nintolerable frustration and always be exasperated by comput-\ners as long as technology proposes alluring products and ser-\nvices (Odlyzko, 1999). Hence, the best path for an employer\nplanning to be involved in employee monitoring is open\ncommunication surrounding the issue (Baltzan & Phillips,\n2009). Moreover, Baltzan and Phillips enumerated the fol-\nlowing policies:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 An information privacy policy includes general crite-\nria regarding information privacy.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Acceptable use policy\" (AUP) is a policy that a user\nmust accept to pursue to gain access to a network, or\nthe Internet.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The development and implementation of an \"e-mail\nprivacy policy\" allows employers to lessen various\nrisks.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 \"Internet use policy\" involves guidelines in how to\nuse the Internet properly.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 With an \"anti-spam policy,\" users are not allowed to\nsend unwelcomed e-mails to others.\nWith the purpose of reducing ethical concerns, Mathis and\nJackson (1997) claimed that employers should consider some\npolicies. These include the following: electronic devices are\nprovided by the employer for business purposes only, the use\nof such electronic devices for personal use is forbidden, all\ncomputer passwords must be in the hands of the employer,\nand the employer has the right to monitor such practices for\nbusiness purposes without further notification. Quite simply,\nif the employer clarifies the purpose of electronic monitoring\nin the organization and links it to performance improvement,\nthe employees are more likely to embrace such a policy (Noe,\nHollenbeck, Gerhart, & Wright, 2007). Legal action appears\nmost effective when employment processes and policy proc-\nlamations have aided in building expectations of job perfor-\nmance in the mentality of the employees (French, 1994).\nFinally, it is strongly recommended that employers distribute\nfeedback on monitoring outcomes, to assist employees in\nimproving their performance or to praise them for good per-\nformance. The following section involves reviewing policies\nand procedures in organizations.\nReviewing Policies and Procedures\nTo ascertain whether employees in an organization are fol-\nlowing customary procedures, the next step is to review\npractices and implement curative actions if required. For\nexample, a significant number of organizations conduct\ninternal audits to measure current results against established\nthat people pose the following questions to specify whether\npresent policies and procedures are satisfactory:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Do current policies cover existing practices ade-\nquately? Were any problems or opportunities uncov-\nered during monitoring?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Does the organization plan any new activities in the\nfuture? If so, does it need new policies or procedures\nconcerning who will handle them and what must be\ndone?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Are contingencies and disasters covered?\nAnswers to these questions are likely to assist and enhance\na company's performance and productivity, as well as being\nalert to unpredictable information that could have negative\ninfluences on the organization's system. Hence, organiza-\ntions should make a thorough effort to guarantee that all\nemployees are responsive to existing policies, through for-\nmal training, for example (Baltzan & Phillips, 2009). Cascio\nand Aguinis (2011) shared that employers should thoroughly\nreview their policies and acknowledge the following: (a) the\nnumber and types of documents an organization sustains\nconcerning employees, former employees, and applicants;\n(b) the information preserved in each type of document or\nrecord; (c) the uses of information inside the organization;\n(d) the exposure made to the external environment (e.g.,\nexternal stakeholders, suppliers, stockholders); and (e) the\ndegree to which employees are familiar with and accredited\nof the utilization and exposure of information about them in\nthe records department. In addition, and perhaps most impor-\ntantly, Cascio and Aguinis advised employers to express,\nconverse, and execute fair information-practice policies by\nthe following means: gather information about individuals\nwho are likely to have an influence on the organization's\ndecision; acknowledge the ways information is to be used by\nemployers; advocate and champion practical methods for\nachieving accuracy, timeliness, and richness of information\nabout employees; restrict the use of such records by applying\nsecurity gauges; control information leakage to unauthorized\nparties; and ensure compliance with expressed fair informa-\ntion-practice policies. The last section in this article is a dis-\ncussion about the role of human resource development\n(HRD) in employee assessment and development.\nThe Role of HRD in Employee\nAssessment and Development\nThis study focuses on ideas and competencies that can be\nassociated with the HRD and human resource management\n(HRM) roles or functions in organizations. The author of this\narticle believes that HRD is a field of study that emphasizes\nfundamental aspects of behavioral and developmental issues\nin organizations. In this sense, HRD efforts can be critical in\nmonitoring employee behavior and performance in organiza-\ntions. According to Megginson, Banfield, and Joy-Matthews\nIt is as important to know when a HRD response is appropriate\nto a particular situation as it is to recognize when it is not. The\nimplementation of HRD strategies must, therefore, be based on\na clear and accurate understanding of the problems and needs\nthat require managerial action, and of what HRD can realistically\nMcGuire and Jorgensen (2011) noted that \"the relation-\nship of HRD with HRM has attracted some comment,\nalthough a consensus is emerging regarding the separate and\ndistinct identity of HRD\" (p. 9). They also added that it\nwould be foolish to disavow that there are no relationships\nbetween HRM and HRD.\nThe literature used to argue the case in this article was\ndrawn from areas that are pertinent to HRD, such as work-\nplace productivity and organizational effectiveness; percep-\ntions and rights of the organization's employees; employee\nfeedback, motivation, creativity, commitment, loyalty, integ-\nrity, and level of satisfaction; coaching and supervision to aid\nlow performers at work; performance improvement provi-\nsions; employee involvement, development, and participa-\ntion; irrelevancies or deficiencies in the organization's\nsystem; and perceptions of fairness or justice in organiza-\ntions. Evidently, the discussion of multifaceted topics con-\ncerning ethical or unethical behavior in organizations has\nbecome prominent in HRD literature in recent years\n(Ardichvili, Mitchell, & Jondle, 2009). Hence, HRD efforts\ncould emphasize as well as protect the value of individual\nprivacy in organizations and promote cherished organiza-\ntional values. From a theoretical point of view, several ques-\ntions extend the HRD field as it reflects on the impact of\nperformancemanagementsystemsinorganizations(Buchner,\n2007). Two of these questions were posed in this article to\npromote and stimulate further investigation and discussion.\nFirst, why do employers often recognize the value of install-\ning sophisticated computer systems to perform more effec-\ntively, instead of spending time or money in developing the\norganization's individuals? According to Megginson et al.\n(2001), thinking of HRD as an investment rather than a cost\ncan help change mind-sets; however, spending time or\nmoney on developing an individual is often perceived as a\ncost. Second, do employers trust their employees in organi-\nzations? Effron, Gandossy, and Goldsmith (2003) noted that\norganizations that succeed are those that evoke our greatest\nhuman capacities: our need to be in good relationships and our\ndesire to contribute to something beyond ourselves. These\nqualities cannot be evoked through procedures and policies;\nthey are available only in organizations in which people feel\ntrusted and welcome and in which people know that their work\nThe purpose of some HRD factors is to tutor, develop, and\neducate individuals in organizations, with a vision to boost\nemployee productivity and enhance organizational effective-\nness (Metcalfe & Rees, 2005). Another working definition is\nthat HRD is concerned with the perceptions that organiza-\ntions are human-made entities that count on human expertise\nto create and accomplish their objectives, and that HRD pro-\nfessionals are advocates of the organization's individuals,\nwork processes, and organizational integrity (Hassan, 2006).\nLikewise, the HRD function contributes to the preservation\nof the well-being of the organization as a social entity, and its\nsupport and development of the organization's performance\nas an economic entity (Yorks, 2005). According to Garavan,\nMcGuire, and O'Donnell (2004), HRD is a multidisciplinary\nconstruction with multiple perspectives. Therefore, HRD\nprofessionals are required to think differently, respond to\nnew and unique problems, and use special lenses, as their\njobs and duties become increasingly challenging (Garavan,\nO'Donnell, McGuire, & Watson, 2007). Similarly, Torraco\nHRD serves a broad range of interests and outcomes in\norganizations. The primary purposes to be served by HRD can\nrange from programs intended to meet the personal development\nneeds of individuals (e.g., identifying individual learning styles\nor personal financial planning) to HRD programs necessary for\neveryone in the organization (e.g., programs addressing a new\nperformance appraisal method or role changes secondary to\nstructural reorganization. (p. 9)\nA critical issue where HRD can provide valuable insight\nis the area of employee performance evaluation. Ethical\ncommitment in performance evaluation will maintain integ-\nrity around the intricacy of learning and performance pro-\ncesses (Short, Bing, & Kehrhahn, 2003). A leader's ability to\nact with integrity is crucial for building trust among individ-\nuals in organizations (Wooten & James, 2008). Interestingly,\nHatcher (2002) argued that technology is driving the need for\nethical HRD, because technology challenges our ethics and\nwhat we consider valuable. In addition, what technology can\ndo in HRD can be perceived in terms of strategies in the full\napplication of technology and the human need for personal\nconnection (R. A. Swanson & Holton, 2001). Moreover,\nHRD professionals must guarantee that both human (employ-\nees) and technological processes (monitoring through the use\nof technology) work effectively and in line with the overall\norganizational strategies.\nMore importantly, to play a primary role in promoting ethi-\ncal business cultures, HRD will need to thoroughly engage in\na system of interrelated and well-coordinated activities\n(Ardichvili & Jondle, 2009). This includes the amalgamation\nof ethics in leadership development programs that promote\nethical culture, and strengthen ethical decision-making skills\nand review of codes of ethics, as illustrated earlier in this arti-\ncle. In addition, because the practice of HRD involves enlight-\nening the workforce to actively participate in the marketplace,\nHRD as a domain has a chance to approach leadership devel-\nopment and culture in the current global economy (Kowske\nNoticeably, HRD studies should inspire organizations\nhow to maintain the psychological well-being of their\nemployees and examine the following questions that con-\ncern the organization's employees' well-being: (a) What\nmakes people happy in their organizations? and (b) What is\na good architecture for HRD programs that should stimulate\npassion and energy among the workforce? (Van der Sluis,\n2007). Thus, employers should recognize employee rights,\ndetermine an individual's contribution to the organization,\ninform employees how well they are performing their tasks,\nreveal their criteria in their performance management sys-\ntem, and provide ongoing feedback on the employees' per-\nformance, as well as coaching and supervising low\nperformers on a regular basis. It is also recommended that\nan HRD professional's first challenge is to cautiously inves-\ntigate the performance dilemma and to build a diagnostic\nframework. Yorks (2005) thoroughly interpreted how to\nbuild the diagnostic framework as follows: (a) describing\nthe problematic performance state (e.g., what has been\noccurring based on data and observation without any analy-\nsis), (b) identifying symptoms (e.g., critical incidents and\nbehaviors related to the situation), (c) identifying the prob-\nlem (e.g., determine the source of the symptoms), and finally\n(d) matching the solution to the problem. In short, HRD per-\nforms significant role in improving employee performance\nand looks at making the organizational system more effec-\ntive through a plethora of tactics (McGuire & Jorgensen,\nFollowing this line of thought, and the various definitions\nof HRD capabilities, the author of this article comfortably\njustifies that HRD efforts and contributions in monitoring\nemployee behavior and performance can stimulate and\ndevelop numerous aspects of the workforce, in line with the\norganization's goals, without encroaching on individuals'\nprivacy.\nRecommendations for Further Studies\nFurther studies may explore the most effective leadership\nstyles, traits, and behaviors required to monitor employee\nperformance using technology in organizations. It would\nalso be useful if we could realize how far employers should\ngo concerning monitoring employee behavior in organiza-\ntions. Another significant issue that can be explored in future\nstudies is the cost associated with the use of software and\ntechnological devices to monitor employee performance.\nPractitioners may also need to be aware of what kind of soft-\nware packages can be the most relevant to particular projects\nin small, medium, and large organizations. In addition,\nDeCenzo and Robbins (2005) found that there are a number\nof questions that remained unanswered in various studies,\nsuch as the following:\n1. How much should managers know about their\nemployees and how far should they go in controlling\ntheir behavior in and out the workplace?\n2. When does an employer's need for information about\nemployee performance invade an employee's right to\nprivacy?\n3. Do employers have the right to monitor whatever\nthey want as long as employees are notified in\nadvance that they will be monitored?\n4. What about the delimitation or the boundary between\nmonitoring work and non-work behavior?\n5. Do employers have the right to monitor their employ-\nees at home during evenings and weekends?\nFurther studies may explore social media, smart phones,\ntablets, or other devices raising monitoring dilemmas in\ntoday's workplace. Finally, future studies may postulate how\norganizations can measure their return on investment (ROI)\nin electronic devices and how much is enough to implement\na technology venture in organizations.\nConclusion\nBy monitoring, employers often argue that they are able to\nprotect their organizations from any harm. In this sense,\nmonitoring is perceived as a tool to maintain the security of\nan organization. New technologies have not only offered\norganizations reasons to monitor employees' behavior, but\nthese technologies have also provided new methods and\ntechniques to perform employee monitoring. Thus, technol-\nogy must be treated with caution and discretion. Employers\nshould realize that employees may retaliate against the orga-\nnization for the perceived unfair monitoring practices.\nTherefore, it is essential when applying new technologies to\nmonitor employee behavior to take into account many con-\ncerns (e.g., privacy, needs, and aspirations). Educating\nemployees about the reasons behind monitoring them, devel-\noping a wide range of policies and procedures, and commu-\nnicating them effectively will be vital to successfully\nimplement a monitoring system.\nThe failure of employers to recognize employee rights\ncan cause extensive loss, such as expensive lawsuits, damage\nto the organization's reputation, and impairment of employee\nvalues. Hence, employers should balance the need for pro-\nductivity with regard to employee rights to privacy, safety,\nand security. Focusing on accomplishments rather than time\nspent in the workplace should be the main concern for any\nemployer. In other words, there is no need to police a work-\nforce because no one can work 8 hr without breaks, and a\nculture of disloyalty and distrust within the organization may\nemerge. However, employees should be aware that there are\nnumerous software packages that could key log everything\nthey type, search, and read on their computers.\nThis study offers many alternatives to EPM that are likely\nto satisfy an employer's objectives without violating rights\nof privacy. Another significant issue raised in this study is\nthat the most effective leadership style to monitor employee\nperformance and behavior through technology remains\nunidentified. From the author's point of view, there is no\nneed to define what a moral behavior is in mature and healthy\norganizations, but it is crucial to shed light on how to use\ntechnologies without violating ethical protocols. Technology\nis a tool that can be used ethically and unethically. After\nreviewing a large number of studies on employee percep-\ntions of electronic monitoring, the author found that the use\nof EPM has created a great deal of tension and pressure\namong individuals in organizations. Therefore, the author\nargued that employee level of satisfaction, motivation, com-\nmitment, loyalty, and integrity in the workplace can be\naffected as a result of extreme levels of stress. Hence, educat-\ning employees about the monitoring system and setting fair\nperformance criteria, distributive justice, procedural justice,\nand interactional justice can make monitoring less distress-\nful. Importantly, monitoring should be consistent with both\nthe overall objectives of the organization and performance\ndilemmas; however, employers' policies should not create\nstress and distrust on their employees. Above and beyond,\nthe author of this study argued that HRD efforts can be sig-\nnificant in monitoring employee behavior and performance\nin organizations. The rationale behind this school of thought\nis that HRD field emphasizes crucial elements of behavioral\nand developmental matters in organizations.\n"
