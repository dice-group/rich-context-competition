    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: During the past decade many health plans adopted risk-contracting arrange-\nments that transferred substantial financial risk and care management responsibility to\nphysician groups and hospital-sponsored integrated delivery systems. Risk transfer ar-\nrangements are now believed to be in steep decline, but there is little empirical evidence on\nthis topic, particularly at the local-market level. Data from the Community Tracking Study\nwere used to examine changes in risk contracting from 1996 to 2000. A decline in reliance\non risk contracting is evident in nearly all markets. However, retrenchment in risk contract-\ning has followed different patterns ranging from refinements in the scope of risk transfer to\nreduced use of risk arrangements to total rejection of risk-sharing arrangements. Modified\nrisk-transfer agreements remain viable in several markets, but continued refinement in the\nnature and scope of risk sharing will be necessary.\nIn the mid-1990s it was expected that transfer of substantial financial\nrisk and care management responsibility from health plans to physician groups\nand hospital-sponsored integrated delivery systems would become a dominant\narrangement in health maintenance organizations (HMOs).1 Risk contracts ap-\npealed to health plans seeking to curb medical expense growth and to physicians\nand hospitals anxious to restore or preserve a measure of autonomy in care deliv-\nery.2 Although characterized as a \"California model\" by some, these arrangements\nbecame a strategy of many health plans across the country.3\nBy the end of the decade some observers were contending that a \"flight from\nrisk\" had occurred.4 Loss of enthusiasm was attributed to poor utilization man-\nagement, inadequate payments by health plans, and diminished savings opportu-\nnities as further reductions in service use and cost became more difficult.5 In addi-\nB u s i n e s s O f H e a l t h\n\u00a92002 Project HOPE\u00adThe People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nBobHurleyisanassociateprofessorintheDepartmentofHealthAdministrationattheVirginiaCommonwealth\nUniversity.

Plans became more cautious about the use of incen-\ntives and increasingly offered broad-network, open-access (no gatekeeper) prod-\nucts that make it difficult to manage care and transfer risk.\nDespite a belief that risk transfer is in steep decline, there is little empirical evi-\ndence on this topic, particularly at the local-market level.6 We find important dif-\nferences in the trajectory of risk across markets, given the differing configurations\nof physicians and health systems, diverse health plans, and varying past experi-\nence with risk arrangements. Changes in risk-based arrangements range from re-\nfining the scope of services under risk in some markets to reductions in plan mem-\nbership under risk transfer in others to full rejection of risk in still others.\nBackground\nAlthough the desirability of risk arrangements has been long debated, there is a\ngeneral consensus that risk promotes cost-conscious provision of health services,\nleading health plans to use risk extensively in HMO products.7 Health plans may\ntransfer financial risk to provider organizations for primary care services only\n(\"primary care capitation\") or include specialist physician services as well (\"pro-\nfessional risk\"). Some risk arrangements also cover hospital and ancillary services\nand pharmaceuticals (referred to as \"shared risk\" or \"global risk\"). We distinguish\nbetween global and shared risk based on whether the contracting organization ac-\ncepts full risk for inpatient care or the risk is shared between the health plan and\nthe physician groups or physician-hospital organization (PHO).\nFrom a provider perspective, a distinction in risk transfer is sometimes made\nbetween \"business risk\" and \"insurance risk.\"8 Business risk is risk for services\nover which the provider organization can reasonably be expected to exert at least\na moderate degree of control, such as physician, ancillary, or hospital services. In-\nsurance risk includes services over which providers have little or no control, as in\nthe case of pharmaceutical costs, new benefit mandates imposed during a contract\nperiod, or out-of-network service use by plan members.\nSome health plans have promoted or permitted risk contracting because they\nbelieve that the \"delegated model\" is important as a means to change the behavior\nof physicians and hospitals. It may also enable plans to limit their medical expense\nexposure by shifting financial risk for care, to reduce their administrative costs of\nmanaging care, and to lessen friction with providers who have chafed under\nmicromanaged care. Physicians and hospitals have viewed assumption of risk as a\nway to reduce external interference in clinical decision making and to reap the\ngains of cost reductions that changes in their practices may yield. In addition,\nsince capitation payments are not tied to generating procedures and office visits,\nphysician and hospital organizations can use the budget capitation provides to\npromote preferred practice behavior and to achieve organizational goals.\nEfforts by physicians and hospitals to create new organizations came into\nR i s k C o n t r a c t i n g\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 1 , N u m b e r 4 1 4 5\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Despite these broad national de-\nvelopments, the growth of risk arrangements remained highly dependent on local\nmarket circumstances, capacity, and interest.10\nStudy Methods\nThe Community Tracking Study (CTS) is a multiyear, multimethod project of\nthe Center for Studying Health System Change (HSC) to analyze patterns of\nchange in a representative sample of sixty markets.11 Twelve metropolitan markets\nwith populations over 200,000 were randomly selected for in-depth study, with\ntocol-driven telephone and in-person interviews with fifty to ninety informants in\neach site representing purchasing, health plan, policy, physician, and hospital sec-\ntors. A total of 2,220 interviews have been conducted across the twelve sites dur-\ning the three rounds. In addition, every two years HSC surveys households (with a\nfollow-back survey to explore type of insurance questions) and physicians in the\nsixty markets. We use results from the 1996\u00ad97 CTS Followback Survey to bench-\nmark risk contracting at that point in time.\nData for this study are drawn primarily from 210 interviews conducted be-\ntween June 2000 and March 2001 with executives from three to six health plans in\neach market--a total of forty-one plans. Selected plans include market leaders\namong regional and national plans, and local Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans. In addi-\ntion, 256 administrative and clinical leaders in the major health systems and physi-\ncian organizations were interviewed in the twelve markets. Respondents were\nasked about contracting arrangements, experience with various configurations of\nrisk transfer, and changes made in network arrangements. All interview notes\nwere incorporated into qualitative data analysis software for coding and analysis.\nStudy Results\nData from the 1996\u00ad97 survey and interview results from Round 1 site visits\nwere used to sort the twelve markets into three broad clusters based on the\namount (number of covered lives) and scope (services incorporated under risk\npayments) of risk contracting (Exhibit 1). In this study we focus on professional\nand global or shared risk contracts. Orange County in Southern California, where\nshared risk arrangements have been the dominant form for HMO networks for a\nnumber of years, is the only market placed in the extensive-risk cluster. At the\nother extreme, with limited risk, are Little Rock, Lansing, Greenville, and North-\nern New Jersey, where risk transfer was typically used by a single plan with a sin-\nB u s i n e s s O f H e a l t h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

In these markets risk contract-\ning was receiving considerable attention from a number of plans and providers in\n1996 but was not yet in widespread use. In Miami and Cleveland, for example, risk\narrangements were most commonly found in a single product line such as\nMedicare or Medicaid. In Boston large hospital-based systems formed in the\nmid-1990s contracted with some health plans to share risk among plans, systems,\nand affiliated physicians. In Indianapolis the largest HMO product was offered by\na network-based health plan having global risk contracts with nearly twenty dif-\nferent provider organizations. Syracuse had a similar but smaller-scale network\nplan that limited the scope of risk transferred.\nOur findings examine plan-to-provider risk transfer, and thus our market char-\nacterizations are based on how sampled plans employed risk arrangements across\nthe twelve markets. It also is apparent that provider organizations in these mar-\nkets fall into three broad categories. Some groups were accepting extensive\n(global or shared) risk across most contracts in 1996; other groups took less risk,\nR i s k C o n t r a c t i n g\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 1 , N u m b e r 4 1 4 7\nStudy site, by degree\nof risk contracting\nPercent of privately\ninsured in products\nthat use risk contracts\nMost common\nrisk contractsa\nProvider organizations\ncontracting with\nhealth plans for riskb\nExtensive\nOrange County 56% Shared, professional Medical group, IPA\nModerate\nSeattle\nMiami\nPhoenix\nCleveland\nIndianapolis\nBoston\nSyracuse\nGlobal, professional\nGlobal, professional\nProfessional, global\nProfessional, global\nGlobal, professional\nShared, professional\nGlobal, professional\nIDS/PHO, medical group, IPA\nIDS/PHO, medical group\nIDS/PHO, medical group\nMedical group, IPA\nLimited\nLittle Rock\nLansing\nGreenville\nNorthern New Jersey\nProfessional\nProfessional\nProfessional\nProfessional\nMedical group\nMedical group\nMedical group\nIPA\nSOURCES: Percentage of privately insured in products that use risk contracts is from the 1996\u00ad97 Community Tracking Study\nFollowback Survey.

While our focus in this paper is on plan-to-provider con-\ntracting, we also note changes that occurred among provider groups.\nn 1996 interviews. Round 1 interviewees in all markets expected both HMO\nenrollment and risk contracting to grow rapidly in commercial and Medicare lines\nof business. This was particularly true in metropolitan markets such as Indianapolis\nand Northern New Jersey, where HMO enrollment had lagged behind national\ntrends or where the Medicare HMO market was seen as a growth opportunity for\nplans, as in Boston and Cleveland. Expectations of growing reliance on HMO reve-\nnues led physicians and health systems to position themselves to \"move up the food\nchain,\" which meant both seeking risk transfer contracts and expanding care deliv-\nery capacity through acquisitions or strategic affiliations and alliances.\nMedical groups and IPAs in Orange County were already deeply involved in\nshared risk arrangements with plans that included pharmacy and other ancillary\nservices. In other markets with less experience with risk arrangements, hospital\nsystems and physician organizations were being created as necessary transitional\nsteps to enter into global and shared risk contracts. A notable example was the\nformation in Boston of two large integrated systems, Partners and CareGroup.\nPHOs and IPAs emerged in other markets in this period, with hospitals playing an\nintegral role in the former and physicians usually providing the leadership in the\nlatter. PHOs enabled hospitals and their affiliated physicians to enter into global\nor shared risk arrangements as IDSs. Freestanding IPAs and medical groups typi-\ncally limited contract scope to professional or shared risk. Phoenix, Seattle, Cleve-\nland, Indianapolis, and Syracuse saw substantial development of such models.\nSmall, embryonic IPAs also arose in some of the markets in the limited-risk cluster.\nThe viability of risk-transfer arrangements in the moderate- and limited-risk\nmarket clusters hinged on plans' willingness to enter into contracts with newly\norganized and unproven entities. Some health plans encouraged their growth,\nwhile others were skeptical about these entities' capacity to perform risk-bearing\nroles. There was especially strong support for risk-bearing entities in the\nMedicare HMO product, since risk arrangements--typically global or \"percent-\nage of premium\" contracts--were seen as key in encouraging physicians to reduce\nthe large inpatient expenses of Medicare and to share in the savings that resulted.\nPlans with well-established networks with individual physician and hospital con-\ntracts already in place, such as Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, were less enthusiastic\nabout risk arrangements.\nn 1998 interviews. The Round 2 interviews found that efforts to promote risk\ntransfer set in motion in Round 1 had paid off in several markets. But many provider\norganizations found it more difficult than expected to profit from risk contracting,\nand some suffered heavy losses. Insurance premiums had risen little between\nRounds 1 and 2. Correspondingly, capitation payments were flat and lagging behind\nB u s i n e s s O f H e a l t h\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

But in some markets reductions\nin use had already been made, making further savings difficult. In other markets\nwhere such reductions had not yet been made, plans and providers found it diffi-\ncult to institute effective utilization management. Meanwhile, a consumer back-\nlash challenged managed care techniques, including capitation and utilization\nmanagement. Health plans began to modify products and practices, shifting em-\nphasis away from HMOs and traditional risk arrangements toward point-of-\nservice (POS) and preferred provider organization (PPO) products.12\nOrange County witnessed the collapse of major PPM firms that had tried to ag-\ngregate market clout by purchasing medical groups and managing IPAs.13 Al-\nthough the failures had many causes, interviewees in several markets saw them as\na direct challenge to the soundness of the \"California model\" of risk transfer.\nThese failures and similar but smaller-scale failures of risk-bearing physician orga-\nnizations in northern New Jersey and Phoenix provoked regulatory attention in\nall three states, raising doubts about and, in some cases, barriers to risk contracting.\nIn markets with moderate or limited risk-transfer experience, caution became\nthe watchword. Plans with interest in risk contracts found fewer organizations\nwilling and able to assume and manage risk, especially risk for services over which\nproviders could not exert much control. In midsize and small markets such as In-\ndianapolis, Lansing, Greenville, Little Rock, and Syracuse, the role of dominant lo-\ncal hospital systems was typically a determinant. Some systems had originally em-\nbraced risk as a way to lock in specialty and hospital referral relationships through\nPHOs that accepted global capitation, such as in Indianapolis. But many health\nsystems lost money on their risk contracts, and, over time, most failed to receive\nenough patients through risk contracts to effect changes in behavior or to justify\nmajor investment in management systems and infrastructure. Enthusiasm faded\nfor initiatives that did not grow revenue and consumed resources. Many systems\nalso found that integration efforts between physicians and hospitals were not pro-\ngressing, and distribution of risk payments among primary care physicians, spe-\ncialists, and hospitals became a troublesome management issue.\nn 2000 interviews. Round 3 interviews revealed several notable developments\nsince 1998 with important implications for risk transfer. Plans had begun to obtain\nsizable premium increases from purchasers, and providers expected to receive cor-\nresponding increases in capitation payments. Financial distress, attributed in part\nto the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997, also led many physicians and hospitals to\ndemand higher payments from health plans and threaten to refuse to continue to\nparticipate in networks unless their demands were met.14 Already facing serious dis-\ncontent among consumers and employers, health plans acceded to these demands in\norder to keep networks intact in many instances.\nR i s k C o n t r a c t i n g\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 1 , N u m b e r 4 1 4 9\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

As one hospital executive stated, \"We have a basic belief that we don't\nbelong in and don't want to be in the insurance business.\" Physicians also chal-\nlenged the scope of their risk contracts because of their discomfort with the\namount of insurance risk they had assumed. This pushing back led many plans to\nagree to exclude from risk contracts pharmaceuticals and benefit and service\nmandates that providers contended they could not be expected to influence, par-\nticularly when mandates were implemented after contracts were already in place.\nhealth plans interviewed in Round 3 falls into several patterns (Exhibit 2). While\n(26), the scope of risk transferred was reduced, and plans became more discrimi-\nnating in selecting risk-contracting partners. Despite turmoil in Orange County\nrelated to PPM failures and the refusal of some hospitals to continue risk arrange-\nments, all major health plans there remain committed to the \"delegated model.\"\nBut the price of sustaining this commitment has been large payment increases to\nshore up contracting medical groups, IPAs, and hospitals. In addition, in five of the\nsix plans there has been refinement in the scope of contracting, including taking\nback some pharmacy risk and reducing the impact on risk-bearing entities of state\nregulations such as mental health parity and mandated immunizations, elements\nof \"insurance risk\" that providers consider unacceptable.\nIn the cluster of markets with limited risk-transfer experience, very few physi-\ncians, hospitals, or health plans were ever enthusiastic about risk contracting, and\nB u s i n e s s O f H e a l t h\nTracking Study (CTS) Sites\nRisk contracting Changes made in risk\nStudy site, by\ndegree of risk\ncontracting\nNumber of\nplans\nPercent of\nplans with\nrisk (number)\nNumber of\nplans\nPercent of\nplans with\nrisk (number)\nPercent of\nplans reducing\nscope of risk\ncontracts\n(number)\nPercent of\nplans reducing\nmembers\nunder risk\ncontracts\n(number)\nExtensive\nModerate\nLimited\nTotal\nSOURCE: Data are based on interviews conducted during Community Tracking Study site visits in 2000\u00ad2001.\nNOTES: See Exhibit 1 for sites in each risk-contracting category.

One plan discontinued all risk, and\nthe remaining two have fewer risk contracts and fewer lives under these contracts.\nPHOs and IPAs have been dismantled or have become inactive. HMO product\ngrowth has also stalled or is in decline, with nonrisk PPOs the product of choice.\nNotably, the dominant insurer in each market is a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan that\nhad made minimal investment in HMO products and risk contracting.\nThe markets in the moderate-risk cluster reveal a mixed picture. Between 1998\nand 2000 only two of the twenty-three plans interviewed had dropped all risk-\ntransfer contracts, but other forms of retrenchment were evident. Five plans had\nreduced the scope of risk delegated, and eight plans reduced the number of mem-\nbers covered by risk contracts by contracting with fewer risk-bearing provider or-\nganizations. Seattle typifies this pattern: Plans found fewer organizations willing\nto accept risk contracts, resulting in fewer plan members under risk arrangements.\nRisk arrangements remained in place for some members because plans were\nwilling to undertake major changes to salvage them, including increased pay-\nments or carving out of pharmacy and other risk from contracts. In other cases, as\nin Cleveland and Miami, risk-transfer agreements remain principally in use in the\nMedicare market, although they could be in future jeopardy because of Medicare+\nChoice policy changes. In Boston, where risk transfer has been in moderate use,\nplans have had to relent to pressures for large payment increases for health sys-\ntems that are still reassessing their posture toward risk. One executive character-\nized the change as \"a more thoughtful approach to risk, as opposed to the huge\nstampede toward risk five years ago.\" In Indianapolis and Syracuse a single health\nplan continues to rely on risk contracts. However, in all of the markets in this cate-\ngory, some physician organizations or health systems have achieved enough suc-\ncess in risk contracting to retain support for these agreements, even as other plans\nand providers eschew them.\nDiscussion\nThis longitudinal perspective on twelve randomly selected metropolitan areas\nprovides valuable insights into the extent of risk contracting and how it has\nevolved as experience has accumulated and broader market conditions have\nchanged. A number of patterns are apparent, including both sizable rate increases\nand retrenchment. Retrenchment is occurring in two forms: (1) reduction in the\nscope of services for which providers will accept risk to something closer to busi-\nness risk; and (2) reduction in plan members covered under risk because fewer\nprovider organizations are willing to participate in risk contracts.\nIn Orange County, with established medical groups and integrated systems\nthat embraced risk transfer, risk arrangements remain in place, but their scope has\nbeen refined to exclude some services providers believe they cannot control, and\npayment rates have been increased. For markets where risk transfer has been em-\nployed more tentatively, such as Seattle, Indianapolis, and Cleveland, the picture\nR i s k C o n t r a c t i n g\nH E A LT H A F F A I R S ~ Vo l u m e 2 1 , N u m b e r 4 1 5 1\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Reuse permissions at HealthAffairs.org.\nis one of a broader retreat in terms of both narrowing the scope of risk arrange-\nments and reducing the number of HMO members covered under risk-transfer ar-\nrangements. Substantial capitation rate increases have also been reported in these\nmarkets. In the markets with limited risk-transfer experience, risk rejection is evi-\ndent, with few if any risk-transfer arrangements likely to survive.\nThe success of risk transfer in a local market hinges on several factors: (1) plans'\ncompetence in selecting suitable risk-contracting partners; (2) presence of pro-\nvider organizations willing and able to manage risk; (3) ability of plans and pro-\nviders to agree on the appropriate scope of services for which risk can be trans-\nferred; and (4) adequacy of capitation payments to providers. Lack of growth in\nrisk-transfer arrangements appears to reflect the fact that few new provider orga-\nnizations have developed an interest in taking on the risk and responsibilities\nthese arrangements entail, or the capacity to do so. For plans and their risk part-\nners that have stepped back from these arrangements, risk transfer is unlikely to\nreemerge in the near term as an important strategy.\nIt is clear that plan payment rates have to meet provider expenses over time to\nsustain risk transfer arrangements, but that has not been the case in many in-\nstances for a number of reasons. Some providers have been overly optimistic about\ntheir ability to manage care. Others may have been na\u00efve in rate negotiation and\nactuarial estimation. Still others accepted risk for costs they could not be ex-\npected to control, or they encountered unexpectedly large cost increases. In other\nsituations, plans may have used the threat of exclusion from their networks to gain\nproviders' acceptance of what proved to be inadequate rates, or refused to include\nrealistic updates to reflect changing conditions.\nOur evidence cannot address fundamental questions of whether\ntransfer of risk provides a better mechanism for generating and sustaining\ncost savings by devolving more control to physicians, or how risk contract-\ning, and the provider reorganization that it requires, affects the quality of care.15 It\nis possible that savings and financial success achieved in some cases by risk-\nbearing providers resulted because of more effective care management, especially\nof inpatient services. Alternatively, some apparent success could have been an arti-\nfact of timing relative to the health insurance underwriting cycle. More research is\nneeded to assess the impact of risk transfer on cost savings and quality.\nWhere risk contracting is well entrenched, there appears to be a reasonably\nhigh comfort level between plans and physician organizations with the division of\nresponsibility and the amount of autonomy for patient care that it affords physi-\ncians. Despite the tumultuous experience of the past few years in Orange County,\nfew observers there are predicting a radical change in reliance on risk transfer.16\nSeattle, Boston, Cleveland, and Indianapolis also continue to have risk-contract-\ning relationships between health plans and provider organizations, although their\nfutures are less certain.
