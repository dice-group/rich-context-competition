Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America.\n \n \nRESEARCH on the long-term consequences of adverse\nchildhood experiences has illustrated the negative im-\npact of childhood abuse and neglect on sleep in early and\nmiddle adulthood (Bader, Schafer, Schenkel, Nissen, &\n \nKoskenvuo, 2010). Serious family conflicts, parental di-\nvorce, constant fear of a family member, and having a men-\ntally ill or alcoholic family member were related to poorer\nsleep in childhood and midlife (Gregory, Caspi, Moffitt, &\nlence of sleep difficulties among older adults (Ancoli-Israel,\n2005), no study has investigated if childhood parental abuse\nand neglect contributed to subjective sleep complaints in\nlate adulthood. The primary goal of the present study was to\nexamine the longitudinal association between childhood pa-\nrental abuse and neglect and subjective sleep complaints\namong older adults.\nThe association between childhood experiences and\nsleep may be explained by a cognitive\u00adaffective model of\nphysiological arousal (Luecken, Rodriguez, & Appelhans,\n2005). Attachment theory suggests that early parent\u00adchild\ninteraction shapes one's internal working model of the self\nand self\u00adother interaction (Cassidy & Shaver, 1999). Abu-\nsive or neglectful parent\u00adchild relationships may reduce\nindividuals' confidence about their ability to deal with\nstress. One study showed that college students who experi-\nenced childhood emotional abuse were more likely to de-\nvelop cognitive schemas of vulnerability to harm, shame,\nand self-sacrifice (Wright, Crawford, & Castillo, 2009).\nMaladaptive cognitive appraisal of the environment and hy-\npervigilance to threat cues may ensue. Experimental studies\non college students reporting abuse and poor family rela-\ntionships also supported this cognitive\u00adaffective explana-\ntion. As sleep and hypervigilance are two incompatible\nphysiological states (Buckley & Schatzberg, 2005), early\nparental abuse and neglect may exacerbate future sleep\nproblems.\nPoor childhood attachment may continue to influence\nsleep through poor adulthood attachment. Drawing upon\nthe cumulative disadvantage perspective (Dannefer, 2003),\npoor parent\u00adchild relationships may foreshadow problems\nin future social relationships and compromise sleep. A qual-\nitative review of the influence of early family experiences\non well being concluded that hostile and cold family envi-\nronments could hinder the development of emotion regula-\ntion skills and increase the likelihood of interpersonal\nproblems (Repetti, Taylor, & Seeman, 2002). Whisman\n(2006) noted that childhood abuse was associated with\nmarital disruption and lower marital satisfaction in a large,\nnationally representative sample. In two separate studies,\nunsupportive social relationships and attachment anxiety\ncontributed to poorer sleep among married couples and\nolder women (Carmichael & Reis, 2005; Friedman et al.,\n2005). The current study's second aim was to examine\nwhether current relationship strain accounted for the\nassociation between adverse parent\u00adchild relationships in\nImpact of Childhood Parental Abuse and Neglect on Sleep\nProblems in Old Age\nCecilia Y.

This study examined whether subjective sleep complaints in late adulthood were associated with child-\nhood parental abuse and neglect and whether the association was mediated by current relationship strain and emotional\ndistress.\nMethods. Multiple regression analyses were performed on data from 877 older adults aged 60 years and above from\nthe National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States. Adverse childhood experiences were retrospectively\nrecalled at Time 1 (1995\u00ad1996). Sleep complaints, relationship strain, and emotional distress were assessed at Time 2\nResults. Early parental emotional abuse was significantly associated with more sleep complaints in old age. Unsup-\nportive interactions with family, friends, significant others, and emotional distress partially explained the association.\nDiscussion. Parental emotional abuse in childhood hindered the development of supportive social relationships later\nin life, which was associated with more emotional distress, and exerted a negative influence on subjective sleep quality\namong older adults. Future research should examine other underlying mechanisms that explain the contribution of human\nattachment to sleep across the lifespan.\nKey Words: Attachment--Emotional abuse--Relationship strain--Sleep.\nchildhood and sleep problems in late adulthood and if this\nwas mediated by emotional distress.\nAlthough previous research has revealed a connection\nbetween childhood abuse and neglect and sleep problems in\nyoung adulthood and midlife, none has examined if this as-\nsociation prevails in old age, when sleep complaints are in-\ncreasingly prevalent. Further, investigators have not\nconsidered the role of current relationship strain. To address\nthese questions, we hypothesized that childhood parental\nphysical and emotional abuse and neglect would contribute\nto more sleep problems in late life. Second, we hypothe-\nsized that current relationship strain would mediate the as-\nsociation. Finally, we examined whether this was partially\nexplained by emotional distress.\nMethods\nSample\nParticipants were selected from the random digit-dialing\nsample of the National Survey of Midlife Development in\nthe United States (MIDUS). A detailed description of the\ndata set and data collection procedures can be obtained at\nthe MIDUS Web site (http://midmac.med.harvard.edu/\nresearch.html). The MIDUS included 3,487 noninstitutional-\nized, English-speaking adults living in the United States at\nple selection was driven by our research focus on the lasting\ninfluence of early attachment on sleep in late adulthood.\nOutcome Variable\nSleep complaints.--At Time 2, four items measured sub-\njective sleep complaints. Participants were asked how often\nthey \"have trouble falling asleep,\" \"wake up during the\nnight and have difficulty going back to sleep,\" \"wake up\ntoo early in the morning and [are] unable to get back to\nsleep,\" and \"feel unrested during the day, no matter how\nmany hours of sleep [they] had\" in the past 30 days. Items\nwere rated on a 5-point scale: 1 (never), 2 (rarely), 3 (some-\ntimes), 4 (often), and 5 (almost always). The four items\nwere summed, with higher scores indicating more sleep\ndifficulties. Internal consistency of this measure was good\nIndependent Variables\nParental abuse.--At Time 1, physical abuse was assessed\nby asking participants how often their mother and father\n\"pushed, grabbed, or shoved [them]; slapped [them]; threw\nsomething at [them]\"; \"kicked, bit, or hit with a fist; hit or\ntried to hit [them] with something; beat [them] up; choked;\nburned or scalded [them]\" during childhood. Emotional\nabuse was assessed by asking participants how often their\nmother and father \"insulted or swore at [them]; sulked or\nrefused to talk to [them]; stomped out of the room; did or\nsaid something to spite [them]; threatened to hit [them];\nsmashed or kicked something in anger.\" Responses were\nrated on a 4-point scale (1 = often, 2 = sometimes, 3 = rarely,\n4 = never).\nWe constructed two variables to indicate the frequency\nof parental physical and emotional abuse, respectively.\nItems were reverse coded. Higher scores would indicate\nmore frequent occurrence of abuse. For physical abuse,\nthe highest frequency endorsed for each physical aggres-\nsion item for either parent was used to indicate the overall\nfrequency of physical abuse. For emotional abuse, the\nhighest frequency endorsed for either parent indicated the\noverall frequency of parental emotional abuse. For exam-\nple, if a participant reported emotional abuse \"often\"\nfrom his or her mother and \"never\" from his or her father,\nthe frequency of emotional abuse would be recoded as\n\"often.\" Averaging maternal and paternal abuse could\nhave resulted in an underestimation of the frequency of\nabuse.\nParental neglect.--At Time 1, participants recalled the\namount of affection, care, understanding, support, time,\nand effort given by their parents during childhood by re-\nsponding to 12 items on a 4-point scale from 1 (a lot) to 4\n(not at all). Six items were averaged and measured mater-\nnal and paternal care, respectively. Reliability estimates of\nmaternal and paternal care were good (a = .90 and .91).\nThe two scales were summed to represent an overall level\nof paternal care in childhood, with higher scores suggest-\ning parental neglect.\nMediating Variables\nCurrent relationship strain.--At Time 2, negative inter-\nactions with family and friends were each measured with\nfour items. Negative interaction with spouse or partner was\nmeasured with six items. A sample item included: \"How\noften do members of your family/friends/spouse/partner\nmake too many demands on you?\" Each item was rated on\na 4-point scale from 1 (never) to 4 (often). Responses were\naveraged for each scale. Higher scores indicated more rela-\ntionship strain. Internal consistency of the three measures\nscales was used to indicate total relationship strain.\nEmotional distress.--At Time 2, emotional distress in\nthe past 30 days was assessed by averaging five items\nthat were rated on a 5-point scale from 1 (all the time) to\n5 (none of the time). Sample items included feeling \"ner-\nvous,\" \"hopeless,\" and \"restless and fidgety.\" These\nitems were reverse coded and averaged, with higher\nscores indicating more emotional distress. Internal con-\nsistency of the scale was good (a = .89).\nCovariates\nDemographic variables.--Age (in years), sex (0 = men,\n1 = women), race (0 = non-White, 1 = White), educational\nattainment (0 = less than high school, 1 = high school and\nabove), marital status (0 = not married, 1 = married), and\nself-rated health (1 = poor to 5 = excellent) were included in\nall analyses as covariates.\nParental death or divorce or separation.--Two dichot-\nomous variables (0 = no, 1 = yes) indicated whether re-\nspondent's parents died or divorced or separated before\nData Analysis\nOrdinary least-squares regression analyses were per-\nformed to examine main effects of parental abuse and ne-\nglect on sleep (Model 1) and relationship strain (Model 2)\nand the main effect of relationship strain on emotional dis-\ntress (Model 3). All independent variables and covariates\nwere entered at the same time. Mediating effects of relation-\nship strain (Model 4) and emotional distress (Model 5) were\nexamined by adding these variables to Model 1.\nResults\nFifty-two percent of the sample were women, with an\ntwo percent were non-Hispanic White. Eighty-seven per-\ncent completed high school or more. Sixty-four percent\nwere married or cohabitating. Eleven percent experienced\nparental death; another 11% experienced parental divorce\nor separation. The average score of the sleep measure was\neffects of parental abuse and neglect on sleep complaints.\nPartially supporting Hypothesis 1, parental emotional\nabuse, but not physical abuse or emotional neglect, was sig-\nnificantly associated with sleep complaints in late adult-\nhood.\nSupporting Hypothesis 2, current relationship strain was\nassociated with parental emotional abuse (b = .22, p < .001;\nModel 2) and accounted for 36% of the association between\nparental emotional abuse and sleep problems in late adult-\nbel test revealed that the mediating effect was significantly\ndifferent from zero (z = 3.72, p = .001). Emotional distress\nwas associated with relationship strain (b = .31, p < .001;\nModel 3), accounting for 57% of the impact of relationship\nstrain on sleep (b dropped from .21 to .12; Models 4 and 5).\nThe mediating effect was significantly different from zero\n(z = 5.67, p < .001). Entering the independent variables and\ncovariates into separate models did not result in significant\nchanges.\nDiscussion\nThis study extended previous research on the impact of\nchildhood family experiences on sleep in young and mid-\nby demonstrating a significant association between child-\nhood parental emotional abuse and poorer sleep quality\namong older adults. This study was also the first to take\ninto account the mediating role of current relationship\nstrain. Consistent with previous research, it was not early\nparental unavailability per se but poor relationships that\nheightened stress reactivity (Luecken et al., 2005). This\nTable 1. Main and Mediating Effects of Early Parental Abuse and Neglect on Sleep Complaints in Old Age (Models 1, 4, and 5)\nMain effect (Model 1) Mediation effect (Model 4) Mediation effect (Model 5)\nb B b B B B\nstudy highlighted the unique contribution of parental\nemotional abuse. Indeed, the attachment theory empha-\nsized the emotional bonding between parent and child.\nEmotional insecurity in childhood could compromise\nemotion regulation skills, thus limiting the development\nof supportive social relationships (Repetti et al., 2002).\nOverall, our findings lent support to the concept of cumu-\nlative disadvantage (Dannefer, 2003), such that negative\nearly attachment relationships continued to exert an in-\nfluence on well being decades later, through an accumu-\nlation of negative social experiences across the lifespan.\nSeveral limitations warrant attention when interpreting\nthese findings. First, childhood adversity may be subject to\nrecall bias. However, research has shown that recall of\nchildhood experiences tended to be reliable and accurate\nsleep disturbance was measured by summing four items that\neach assessed a different type of sleep problem. To increase\nspecificity, future studies should employ measures that ex-\namine specific sleep domains with multiple items. Third, we\ncould not rule out the influence of other variables, namely\nchronic medical conditions and trait anxiety. To explain a\ngreater portion of variance of sleep problems longitudinally,\nfuture research may consider the influence of other psycho-\nsocial mediators, such as the personal meaning of relation-\nship strain. Replication of these findings in a more diverse\nsample of older adults will also enhance generalizability.\nThe overall pattern of results supports a lifespan develop-\nmental perspective of risk and protective factors of sleep prob-\nlems, specifically the importance of secure attachment across\nthe lifespan. Given the prevalence of sleep complaints in late\nadulthood and the impact of sleep on health (Ancoli-Israel,\n2005), it is imperative that researchers and clinicians be mind-\nful of psychosocial factors at different life stages that may\nelicit poor sleep in late adulthood. Interventions that can re-\nduce current relationship strain may also ameliorate the nega-\ntive consequences of early parental emotional abuse on sleep.\n"
