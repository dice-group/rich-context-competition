Furthermore, the potentially\nharmful effect of life distress as experienced by caregivers\nof functionally dependent persons is exacerbated by the\nlong-term nature of care recipient needs and behavioural\nsymptoms (e.g. Gallagher et al., 2009; Vitaliano et al.,\n2003). In fact, alongside this, and given the large number of\ncaregivers in national populations (Ireland, 278,000; United\nmillion), car-\negiver health has now been argued to be a public health\nconcern (Talley and Crews, 2007). However, not all car-\negivers succumb to poor health (Vedhara et al., 2002), some\ncope extremely well with the demands of caregiving. For\nexample, a population-based study from the United States\nfound decreased mortality in caregivers who spent more\ntime caregiving (Brown et al., 2009), implying a paradox in\nthe literature. Moreover, alongside the stress of caring, car-\negivers also report uplifts and rewards, and a review of the\nliterature on these aspects revealed a health-promoting\neffect in caregivers (Pinquart and S\u00f6rensen, 2003).\nAdditionally, studies have recently found that caregivers\nwho perceived more benefit finding (BF), that is, an\nincrease in perceived positive growth in areas of relation-\nships, gratefulness, spirituality and meaning making, had\nincreased social support which in turn predicted higher\nquality of life (QoL; Brand et al., 2014). Similar findings\nhave been reported elsewhere (Cassidy, 2013; Kim et al.,\nthe positive contribution BF has for caregiver health.\nCaregivers may engage in BF as a cognitive strategy for\ncoping with stress (Brand et al., 2014).As part of that cogni-\ntive strategy, those who engage in BF transform their view\nof themselves, others and their place in the world to produce\nA randomised controlled trial of\nbenefit finding in caregivers: The\nBuilding Resources in Caregivers\nStudy Protocol\nCharles Brand1, Brenda H O'Connell1,2 and Stephen Gallagher1,2,3\n Keywords\nBenefit finding, caregiver, expressive writing, intervention, randomised control trial\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland\nCentre for Social Issues Research, Study of Anxiety, Stress and Health\nLab, University of Limerick, Ireland\nHealth Research Institute, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland\nCorresponding author:\nStephen Gallagher, Department of Psychology, University of Limerick,\nLimerick, Ireland.\nEmail: stephen.gallagher@ul.ie\nIntervention Study\n2 Health Psychology Open \na positive psychological change after a traumatic event\nthrough a process of cognitive restructuring (Cheng et al.,\nthrough intervention may be one way to improve coping\nmechanisms in caregivers and to build resources to deal\nwith the challenges of caring. Indeed, harnessing the power\nof BF through intervention may be a key way of helping\ncaregivers deal with the unpleasant nature of caring.\nAlthough the body of evidence attesting to the negative\neffects of caring cannot be ignored, equally one cannot\nignore these positive findings and the potential of BF as an\nintervention strategy for caregivers has just being harnessed\nwith positive results (Cheng et al., 2014).\nCaregivers who participated in an 8-week BF interven-\ntion were found to have lower depression scores relative to\na control group immediately after the intervention (Cheng\net al., 2014); whether these reductions were maintained over\ntime is not yet known. As well as the lack of maintenance\ndata, it is not known whether improvements in BF were evi-\ndent, which was due to lack of measurement of the con-\nstruct. As such, it is difficult to know whether BF was\ndriving the observed effects. Moreover, previous cognitive\nrestructuring interventions with caregivers' reasons suggest\nthat providing too many restructuring techniques may hin-\nder caregivers to integrate and apply all those learned simul-\ntaneously in their daily lives (Lavoie et al., 2005), implying\nthat simple and brief techniques may have more utility.\nSimilarly, given that caregivers are notoriously difficult to\nrecruit for interventions, primarily due to time and respite\nconstraints (Pasacreta and McCorkle, 1999) and lack of\ntransport (Are\u00e1n and Gallagher-Thompson, 1996), it was\nhardly surprising that only 25 caregivers were recruited in\ntotal which impacts on the generalisability of the study.\nOther barriers to recruitment include inaccessibility to the\nresearch site and mistrust of researchers (Dowling and\nthe limitations of earlier studies and the constraints and bar-\nriers in conducting face-to-face interventions, in addition to\nthe considerable costs involved, a solution which can cir-\ncumvent some of these obstacles is using an online environ-\nment to deliver a brief and simple writing intervention.\nGenerally, conducting research online saves time by\nmaking research instruments and content available instantly,\nsaves money in terms of space/travel and other additional\ncosts associated with the employment of those involved in\nthe face-to-face administration of the project (Kazdin and\nRabbitt, 2013). Apropos of all the preceding benefits of\nconducting online research, there is another even more rel-\nevant reason for applying an online approach to conducting\nthis research with caregivers. Due to the nature of caregiv-\ning, a lack of time for oneself is a re-occurring theme within\ncaregiving narratives and is also identified as a reason for\nincreased burden on caregivers (Zarit et al., 1980), as con-\ntributing to an inability to meet their own personal needs\n(Grant and Davis, 1997). Hence, E-health also has the\npotential to remove the time and space barrier between car-\negivers and therapists.\nImportantly, caregivers will take part in this study on an\nindividual basis and this Internet-based model of delivering\nthe study intervention adheres to research recommendations\nmade by S\u00f6rensen et al. (2002) who established that interven-\ntions aimed at individual caregivers were more effective in\nimproving caregiver well-being than group interventions.\nMoreover, we have preliminary data employing a randomised\ncontrol trial (RCT) methodology to deliver a brief 2-week\nInternet-based writing intervention to improve social well-\nbeing (O'Connell et al., 2015) which would be ideally suited\nto caregivers who are constrained by both time and geogra-\nphy. Thus, feasibility to deliver interventions of this type over\nthe Internet is already established. Furthermore, Grant and\nDePew (1999) recommend developing relationships with the\nkey individuals in referring agencies, including healthcare\nproviders and their key personnel in order to aid with recruit-\nment and help retain study participants. Maintaining collabo-\nrative relationships with healthcare providers through\npresentations and feedback about interventions may foster\nimportant referral sources (Are\u00e1n and Gallagher-Thompson,\n1996). Accordingly, this study will recruit caregivers through\nthe online social networks operated by the two largest car-\negiver non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Ireland:\nCare Alliance Ireland and the Carers Association.\nThus, the primary aim of this Building Resources in\nCaregivers (BRiC) intervention is to test the methodology\nand feasibility of a brief 2-week Internet-based BF writing\nintervention to increase BF with a secondary aim of improv-\ning their overall QoL and psychological health. We will\nalso seek to ascertain the feasibility of delivering this type\nof writing intervention via an Internet-based model.\nMethods\nStudy design\nThis will be a double-blind, randomised controlled parallel\ngroup trial design, with three measurement periods (T1 \u00ad\nbaseline, T2 \u00ad immediately after intervention and T3 \u00ad\nmonths later). The between groups will be (a) the\nintervention group and (b) the control group (see below for\ndetails). The trial will be conducted in accordance with the\nCONSORT guidelines (Turner et al., 2012) with an equal\n1:1 allocation ratio. The primary outcome will be BF\n(Antoni et al., 2001) and secondary outcomes the Caregiver\nQuality of Life (QoL; Joseph et al., 2012) and Hospital and\nDepression Scale (HADS; Zigmond and Snaith, 1983).\nEthics for this project has been approved by the universities\nParallel to the RCT, a brief qualitative component will be\nundertaken along with intervention difficulty and acceptabil-\nity ratings. In this qualitative study, participants will be asked\nBrand et al. 3\nto write comments about the effects of the intervention and\naspects of the intervention method (see below for details).\nObservations drawn from the qualitative part of the study\nwill be used to consider the feasibility aspects of the study.\nParticipants\nInclusion criteria will be primary caregivers in the Republic\nof Ireland aged over 18\nyears currently providing care to\none or more persons. Those excluded from the proposed\nstudy will be professional caregivers such as those who are\nin the employment of institutions of care or home care pro-\nvision companies. Caregivers will be recruited through our\nNGO collaborators (Care Alliance and Carer's Association)\nwho have an extensive network of carer groups nationally.\nWe have worked in partnership with these groups previ-\nously (Brand et al., 2014). The study will be advertised on\ntheir respective websites and appear on Twitter feeds\nwhereby caregivers can contact the principal investigator\ndirectly to receive the study information sheet, seek clarity\nand have the opportunity to ask questions. As in our previ-\nous study (Brand et al., 2014), we will include all caregiv-\ners, as we have found no differences on psychosocial\noutcomes in those caring for physical or mental health dis-\nabilities. Moreover, this all-inclusive approach allows for\ncomparisons to be made regarding efficacy and whether the\nintervention is appropriate for all caregiver groups.\nSample size calculation\nThe null hypothesis of this between-subjects RCT is that there\nare no significant differences in well-being in caregivers who\nwrite their thoughts and feelings in a diary about the benefits\nof caregiving and those caregivers who write about topics\nunrelated to their caregiving activities. Based on previous\nresearch (Cheng et al., 2014), a power calculation with a\nmedium effect size of F=.25, p<.05 and power of .8, the total\nsample size required is 86, with 43 in each trial arm (calcu-\nlated with G*Power Version 3.9). Participant demographic\ninformation will be gathered at the beginning of the T1 data\ncollection process which should, according to Bosnjak and\nper cent. Therefore, a sample size of 96 caregivers will be\nrecruited to provide data for the final analysis.\nRecruitment\nCaregivers will be recruited using social media and via the\ne-mail communications platforms used by Care Alliance\nand The Carer's Association. On the respective caregiver\nwebsites, potential participants will be invited to read a\nshort description of the study on the organisation home\npages. Should they wish to obtain further information, they\nwill be directed to a link bringing them to a web page where\nthey can read more detailed information about the study.\nOnce they are satisfied that they have read sufficient infor-\nmation about the study, they will be directed to a link on the\nconsent page which they can click should they wish to par-\nticipate. The consent forms and questionnaires will be\ndelivered over the Internet through QuestBackTM software.\nIntervention\nThe proposed intervention will be based on and informed by\nprior work in the BF interventions literature (Cheng et al.,\napproaches that focussed on increasing BF among caregivers\nhad superior results in reducing depression over psychoedu-\ncational approaches attempting to achieve the same goal.\nCaregivers will be instructed to write about their thoughts\nand feelings in a diary/personal notebook focussing on the\nbenefits of caring, to consider improved social relationships,\nthe appreciation of life and loved ones, and think about the\npositive consequences with respect to these. To better meet\nthe needs of the caregivers in our study (e.g. time pressures,\nsensitivity), we will not ask diaries to be returned. While we\nacknowledge that this may be a limitation, if participants do\nnot engage, then our results should reflect this and our fidel-\nity assessment may provide more information if this is the\ncase. These activities will be done three times a week for 2\nweeks. The control group will be asked to write about the\nweather that day for the same number of days.\nThe intervention group writing instruction will read as\nfollows:\nWriting is a great way to reflect on your life in general and on\nthe roles we have in life, helping to look back and focus on the\ngood things in our lives. These things can be big and small. For\nthe next two weeks, three times a week on the days of your\nchoosing we encourage you to really let go, explore your\ninnermost thoughts and feelings about the benefits of providing\ncare to your loved one and write these thoughts down. Examples\ncould include writing about becoming closer to your loved one,\nfocussing on the things your loved one is able to do rather than\nwhat they cannot do, no matter how big or small this is, feeling\nneeded, more empathetic, accepting, compassionate, new\nrelationships with others, your loved one or family members;\nperhaps seeing your life in a different way - more positive. It\ncould also be about you and how satisfied you are as a carer\nmoving forward and learning how your priorities have changed.\nThese are just examples, but you may have other benefits that\nyou would like to talk about regarding your caring role, no\nmatter how big or small they may be. Although when you write\nthe sentences they can be as long or as short as you like but try\nand aim for about 3 or 4 sentences at least.\nThe control group writing instruction will read as\nfollows:\nWriting is a good way of getting us to reflect a bit better and it\nmay help improve our well-being. For the next two weeks, on\njust six days of your choice (3\ndays each week), write in a\n4 Health Psychology Open \ncopybook or a personal diary, a number of things about the\nweather on each day. Although when you write the sentences\nthey can be as long or as short as you like but try and aim for\nabout 3 or 4 sentences at least.\nProcedure\nAfter providing informed consent, caregivers will be ran-\ndomly allocated using the random allocation feature of sur-\nvey QuestBackTM software to the intervention or control\ncondition. Baseline measures will be completed at T1, for\nexample, demographics, care recipients details, and pri-\nmary and secondary outcome measures; after the 2-week\nwriting stage is complete, participants will be sent an e-mail\nwith a link to complete the post-intervention (T2), and\n3-month follow-up (T3) assessment, with outcomes as pre-\nviously administered at baseline.\nFidelity, implementation and adherence\nThe writing instructions are a core component of the pro-\nposed intervention. In order to ensure as high a level of\nadherence to fidelity criteria associated with the main out-\ncome measure (BF) as possible, the writing instructions for\nboth the control and intervention groups have been con-\nstructed in such a way as to induce an equal chance of per-\nceiving benefit. Additionally, to assess the level of\nexpectation across both groups of perceiving benefit, prior\nto random allocation, all participants will be asked to answer\nthe following question `How well do you expect to feel after\ntaking part in the writing activities?' on a Likert-type scale\nranging from 1 (Not at all) to 6 (Very well). We would expect\nthat both groups have a similar level of expectation to ben-\nefit from the writing exercise. Moreover, to assess partici-\npant's difficulty and acceptability of the writing exercise at\nT2, participants will be asked a series of questions rated on\n6-point Likert-type response scales. For example, How dif-\nficult did you find the writing activities to do, 1 (not at all\ndifficult) to 6 (very difficult); How disruptive of your time\ndid you find the writing activities, 1 (not at all disruptive) to\n6 (very disruptive); How acceptable was it for you to writing\nactivities for you, 1 (not at all acceptable) to 6 (very\nacceptable);and How likely would you recommend this\ntype of writing activity to other carers, 1 (not at all likely) to\n6 (very likely). Furthermore, to improve adherence, caregiv-\ners will receive an e-mail prompt each week to remind them\nto write in their diaries. Finally, we will also include a free\nform text box where caregivers can respond freely to the\nquestion `If there is anything that we may have forgotten to\nask about your experiences of writing then feel free to write\nin the space provided'.\nMeasures\nCaregiver and care-recipients' sociodemographics includ-\ning age, gender, socioeconomic indices and health-related\nvariables such as illness types, time and hours spent caring\nwill be captured by questions created in-house.\nPrimary outcome\nAll measures of BF will be obtained using the 17-item\nBenefit Finding Scale (BFS) (Antoni et al., 2001). The BFS\nwas originally developed by Behr et al. (1992) as the\nPositive Contributions Scale (PCS), which they used to\nassess the perceptions of parents of children with special\nneeds with `Being a parent of a child with special needs'\nused as the introductory preamble. Examples of items\ninclude `Has led me to be more accepting of things' and\n`Has helped me to take things as they come'. Participants\nwill be asked to indicate, using a five-point Likert-type\nscale ranging from (1) `not at all' to (5) `extremely', the\nextent to which each item has applied to them. The total\nscore of the scale can range from 17 to 85, where higher\nvalues indicate a higher degree of BF. The scale has been in\nvarious populations and has found to have excellent relia-\n2005). We use an adapted version here replacing `parent'\nwith `caregiver', and in order to capture change in BF, we\nreplaced the baseline stem to read `Being a parent of a child\nwith special needs' with `As a caregiver, I feel that' instead\nof `Since becoming a caregiver'. We also altered the word-\ning of each item to reflect current feelings (e.g. `I am more\naccepting of things' `I take things as they come') so that we\ncould capture change following the intervention. For T2\nand T3 follow-up measures of BF, the stem will be changed\nto `After taking part in this writing exercise how much have\nthe following changed for you? As a caregiver, I feel that\n...' with the same 17 original items used.\nSecondary outcomes\nCaregiver QoL. Caregiver QoL will be measured using the\n40-item Adult Carer Quality of Life Questionnaire (AC-\nQoL; Joseph et al., 2012). The AC-QoL measures QoL in\neight separate domains: support for caring, caring choice,\ncaring stress, money matters, personal growth, sense of\nvalue, ability to care and carer satisfaction. Participants will\nbe asked to indicate the frequency that they feel or experi-\nence different aspects of the caregiving role on a 4-point\nLikert\u00adtype scale ranging from 0 (never) to 3 (always). AC-\nQoL scores can be calculated for a total QoL using the\nentire set of items (range 0\u00ad120) or for each of the sub-\nscales individually (range 0\u00ad15) with higher scores indicat-\ning higher perceived QoL on that subscale. This scale has\nalso been shown to have excellent consistency reliability\nPsychological distress. The Hospital and Anxiety Depression\nScale (HADS; Zigmond and Snaith, 1983) will be measured\nas a covariate and secondary outcome of psychological\nBrand et al. 5\ndistress. The HADS is a brief self-report measure that was\nspecifically designed to screen for distinct dimensions of\nanxiety and depression in non-psychiatric hospital depart-\nments. The severity of anxiety and depression are assessed\nusing two subscales, each one consisting of seven items that\nare rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 to 3.\nCorresponding answers differ depending on the stem ques-\ntion for each item statement. For example, Item 2 reads `I\nstill enjoy the things I used to enjoy': with answers ranging\nfrom 0 (Definitely as much) to 3 (Most of the time). Previous\ncaregiver research has also used the HADS to investigate\nthe effect of a family meeting intervention on depression\namong family caregivers of people experiencing dementia\n(Joling et al., 2012) and parental caregivers (Gallagher et al.,\n2008) and the associations between caregiver characteristics\nand caregiver burden, perceived health and mood status\n(Martinez-Martin et al., 2008). The psychometric properties\nof the HADS have been tested for validity and reliability in\na caregiver sample by Gough and Hudson (2009) and dem-\nonstrated a high level of internal consistency (=.89).\nStatistical analysis\nAll analysis will be executed using SPSS Statistics 21TM\nsoftware package. Prior to formal statistical analysis, suit-\nable descriptive statistics will be presented describing the\nbaseline characteristics of the sample. Bivariate associa-\ntions between the variables of interest will be conducted\nusing correlation analyses. Tests of baseline homogeneity\nbetween the two treatment groups and attrition bias will be\nexamined using independent samples t-tests and chi-square\nanalysis. These will also be employed to check for success-\nful randomisation. Preliminary inspections to ensure all\ndistributional assumptions are met for the formal analysis\nwill be conducted. All tests of significance will be two\nsided, with =.05 as criterion for statistical significance, or\nif the 95per cent confidence interval does not contain zero.\nThroughout partial eta squared (\np\n2 ), Cohen's d and R2 will\nbe reported as measures of effect size, depending on the\nanalysis. To test the effectiveness of the intervention versus\nthe active control on the primary outcomes BF, and second-\nary outcomes QoL, anxiety and depression, across each\nfollow-up, mixed between\u00adwithin analyses of variance will\nbe conducted using complete cases only. Additional post-\nhoc analysis will be conducted on significant findings.\nFurthermore, as attrition rates in previous studies of this\nnature are high, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted\nusing multilevel linear mixed modelling, where an inten-\ntion-to-treat analysis strategy will be employed if there is a\nhigh level of missing data due to dropout. This will include\nall available data, and maximum likelihood estimations\nwill be implemented to handle missing data. Furthermore,\nbased on the findings in the above mixed between\u00adwithin\nanalyses of variance, and to further investigate the relation-\nship between the intervention and outcomes, post-hoc\nmediation analysis will be conducted using the PROCESS\nmacro for SPSS (Hayes, 2013). Finally, measures of central\ntendency and dispersion will be used to understand the usa-\nbility and feasibility data.\nDiscussion\nThis RCT will examine the effectiveness of a brief BF writ-\ning exercise, versus an active control exercise among car-\negivers. This BriC intervention addresses limitations of\nprevious BF interventions and other caregiver interventions\nhighlighted in the literature to date. BRiC takes into account\nthe need for brevity and the time constraints of caregivers\ncombined with an evidence-based writing exercise activity,\nemploying a mixed-methods approach and a long-term fol-\nlow-up period. In order to systematically examine the inter-\nvention effects on caregiver well-being, BRiC will include\nan array of outcome measures including BF, distress and\nQoL as well as manipulation checks, that is, intervention\nexpectancy and feasibility. Additionally, BRiC will build on\nby harnessing the power of BF to improve caregiver health\noutcomes. To this end, BRiC will serve to inform future\ndirections of research and clinical practice with regard to\nbrief psychosocial interventions for caregivers.\n"
