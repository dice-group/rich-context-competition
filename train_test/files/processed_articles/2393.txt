In-\ncreased risk persisted to age 65 years.3\nA more recent longitudinal study of de-\nlinquent youth found that their mortality\nrates, after adjusting for demographic\ndifferences, were .4 times those of\ngeneral population youth.4\nFew longitudinal studies of delinquent\nyouth have examined risk factors for early\nviolent death. Some studies had too few\ndeathstoanalyzeriskfactors.1,5 Thelargest\nand most recent investigations found\nsubstance abuse, gang involvement, and\ncriminal activity are among the risk fac-\ntorsassociatedwithearlyviolentdeath.6,7,8\nThese previous investigations provide\nimportantdata,buttheyhavelimitations:\n1. The samples do not reflect the de-\nmographic characteristics of today's\ndelinquent youth. There are few data\non females,3,6 who now comprise\nhave mortality rates up to 8 times\nthose of the general population.4\nOne study3 did not include racial/\nethnic minorities, groups who are\ndisproportionately incarcerated. Afri-\ncan Americans and Hispanics now\ncomprise one-third of the general\nbut approximately two-thirds of in-\ncarcerated youth12 and young\nadults.13 More than one-third of\nlow-income African-American children\nhave been arrested by age 24 years,\n2. Previous studies examined only seri-\nous offenders who had been con-\nvicted and had served time in\ncorrectional facilities.3,6,7 These studies\nhave limited generalizability because\nserious offenders constitute only\na fraction of the 1.5 million cases\nprocessed in juvenile court each\n3. Many studies did not calculate\nmortality rates (deaths per person-\ngeneral population according to gen-\nder, race/ethnicity, and age.6,7\nWe addressed these limitations by using\nnewly available data from the North-\nwestern Juvenile Project, a large-scale\nlongitudinal study of health needs and\nused interview data and obtained official\ndeath records up to 16 years after par-\nticipants' baseline interview, analyzing\nall-cause mortality and deaths from all\nexternal causes(homicides,unintentional\ninjuries, and suicides),18 homicide alone,\nand firearm homicide alone. In the pres-\nent article, we: (1) calculated mortality\nrates according to gender, race/ethnicity,\nand age, comparing them with the gen-\neral population in Cook County, Illinois\n(hereafter referred to as general pop-\nulation); (2) compared causes of death\nwith the general population; and (3) de-\ntermined the association between mor-\ntality and modifiable risk factors, such as\nsubstance use disorders, gang member-\nship, and drug dealing.\nMETHODS\nDelinquent Sample\nBaseline Interview\nWerecruitedastratifiedrandomsample\nJuvenile Temporary Detention Center\n(CCJTDC) in Chicago, Illinois, between\nwho were awaiting the disposition of\ntheir case. To ensure adequate repre-\nsentationofkeysubgroups,westratified\nour sample according to gender, race/\nethnicity (African American, non-Hispanic\nyears or $14 years), and legal status\n(processed in juvenile or adult court).\nYouth were eligible to participate in the\nstudy regardless of the severity of their\nalleged offense. Project staff interviewed\nparticipants (most within 2 days of in-\ntake) at the detention center in a private\narea.\nFollow-up Interview\nAnalyses also include data from the\nfirst follow-up interview 3 years\nafter detention. We interviewed par-\nticipants regardless of where they\nwere living. The participation rate was\nsignificant demographic differences\nin retention.\nProcedures to Obtain Assent and\nConsent\nParticipants signed either an assent\nform (if they were aged ,18 years) or\na consent form (if they were aged $18\nyears). The institutional review boards\nof Northwestern University and the Cen-\nters for Disease Control and Prevention\nwaived parental consent, consistent with\nfederal regulations regarding research\nwith minimal risk.19 We nevertheless\ntried to contact parents to provide them\ninformation and used an independent\nparticipant advocate to represent the\ninterests of the participant.\nVariables and Measures\nDeaths: Participants' deaths, from Novem-\nand verified by using death certificates.\nRisk Factors: Substance use disorders\nwereassessedbyusingage-appropriate\nmeasures at baseline (Diagnostic In-\nterviewScheduleforChildren,version2.3\nup interview (Diagnostic Interview\nSchedule, version IV [DIS-IV]).22,23 Pre-\nvious useofdrugs other than marijuana\n(sometimes known as \"hard drugs\" [eg,\ncocaine, heroin, hallucinogens]) was\nassessed at baseline (by using ques-\ntions from the DISC-2.3). Drug dealing,\ngang membership, and firearm use\nwere added at the follow-up interview\n(by using questions from the Denver\nGeneral Population Data\nThecomparison groups includedAfrican\nAmericans, non-Hispanic whites, and\nHispanics in the general population\nof Cook County, Illinois, who were aged\navailable).26 Population counts for 5-\nyear age groups were obtained from\nmid-year census estimates for these\nsame years.27 Additional information\non our methods is provided in the\nSupplemental Appendix and published\nStatistical Analysis\nComparison of Our Sample With the\nGeneral Population\nWe compared standardized all-cause\nmortality rates and specific causes of\ndeathbetweenourstudysampleandthe\nCook County, Illinois, generalpopulation.\nWe estimated mortality rates in our\nsample by calculating the deaths per\nyears of age. Because selected strata\nwere oversampled (Supplemental Ap-\npendix), we used sampling weights to\nestimate mortality rates that reflect\nCCJTDC's population; 95% confidence\nintervals (CIs) were estimated by using\nthe jackknife method.\nWe estimated all-cause mortality rates\nin Cook County by using the single-\ndecrement period life table method.28\nTo make contemporaneous compar-\nisons between our cohort data and\nperiod data from Cook County, we\ncreated 3 synthetic cohorts from the\ndardized Cook County rates to reflect\nthe racial/ethnic and gender distribu-\ntion of the CCJTDC population; 95% CIs\nwere based on the Poisson distribu-\ntion.29 We used the delta method to\ncompute rate ratios comparing mor-\ntality rates and specific causes of\ndeath.\nRisk Factors for Mortality in\nDelinquent Youth After Detention\nWe estimated the relationship between\nrisk factors and subsequent external-\ncause mortality, homicide, and firearm\nhomicide by using weighted nonpara-\nmetric survival analyses. Kaplan-Meier\nfunctions were used to compare the\nprobability ofsurvival accordingto race/\nethnicity (self-reported), gender, and\npresenceofriskfactors.30 Substanceuse\ndisorders were analyzed at the baseline\ninterview and at the follow-up interview\n(to be contemporaneous with analyses\nof other risk factors).\nWeighted Cox proportional hazards re-\ngressionwasusedtoestimateunadjusted\nhazard ratios for each risk factor and\nhazard ratios adjusted for demographic\ncharacteristics (gender, race/ethnicity,\nand age at baseline).30 For risk factors\nthat violated the proportional hazards\nassumption, we included time-dependent\ncovariates in our models (time squared\nfor gang membership and drug dealing;\ntime for alcohol use disorder). For risk\nfactorsmeasuredatfollow-upinterviews,\nwe augmented sampling weights with\na nonresponse adjustment to account for\nmissing data.31 Taylor series linearization\nalyzing specific causes of death, other\ndeaths were treated as censored. Be-\ncause incarceration restricts some\nexposures associated with external-\ncause mortality (eg, firearm-related\ninjuries, automobile crashes),34 and be-\ncause no participant died while in-\ncarcerated, we excluded days when\nparticipants were incarcerated from the\nexposure time in all survival analyses.\nDays incarcerated were drawn from of-\nficial records.

(We also\ncompared mortality rates using data\nsimilar and are available from the\nauthors.) In nearly every demographic\nsubgroup, delinquent youth had signifi-\ncantly higher mortality rates than the\ngeneral population. For example, the\nmortality rates of Hispanic males were\n4.9 times the general population rates;\nmortality rates of Hispanic females\nwere .9 times the general population\nrates. African-American males had the\nhighest mortality rate in our sample,\nbut their standardized mortality ratio\n(2.7 times the general population rate)\nwas lower thanmost otherdemographic\nsubgroups.

Although risk of\nmortalityislowerindelinquentfemales\nthan males, delinquent females died at\nnearly 5 times the rate of females in the\ngeneral population.\nOurstudyalsoaddsnewinformationon\nmortality rates among Hispanics, now\nthelargestracial/ethnicminoritygroup\nin the United States.36 The mortality\nrate among delinquent Hispanic males\nwas nearly 5 times the general pop-\nulation rate; among Hispanic females, 9\ntimes the general population rate.37\nStandardized all-cause mortality rates of delinquent youth after detention (N = 1829) compared with the general population.

Ho-\nmicide was the most prevalent cause of\nparticipants; nearly all homicides involved\nfirearms.

The actual mortality ratios\nmay beevengreater thanthoseobserved\nbecause our sample and the general\npopulation are not mutually exclusive; the\ngeneral population also includes youth\nwho have been detained. Moreover, we\nmayhaveunderestimatedmortalityratios\nfor younger males and racial/ethnic mi-\nnorities because the US Census under-\ncounts these groups.44 Because death\nwas relatively uncommon, some 95% CIs\nwere wide. Although retention rates were\nhigh, findings on risk factors measured\nat follow-up may have been affected by\nmissing data.\nImplications\nOur study provides new evidence that\nmodifiable risk factors (alcohol use\ndisorder, gang membership, and drug\ndealing)areassociatedwithmortalityup\nto a decade after detention.

The total proportion of deaths due to homicide (firearm and other) were 90% for delinquent males, 39%\nfor general population males, 42% for delinquent females, and 14% for general population females.
