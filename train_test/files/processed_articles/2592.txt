Although higher quality marriages are associated with better health outcomes, less is known about the\nmechanisms accounting for this association. This study examines links among marital/partner quality, stress, and blood\npressure and considers both main and moderating effects.\nMethod. Participants from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (N = 1,854; aged 57\u00ad85 years) com-\npleted in-person interviews regarding their marital/romantic partner relationships and perceived stress. Interviews\nincluded blood pressure assessments.\nResults. Linear regression models revealed no main effects of spousal/partner quality or stress on blood pressure.\nHowever, spousal/partner quality moderated the link between stress and blood pressure. Specifically, there were nega-\ntive associations between stress and blood pressure among people reporting more confiding, less reliance, and greater\ndemands from spouses/partners.\nDiscussion. Findings highlight the complexity of relationship quality. Individuals appeared to benefit from aspects of\nboth high- and low-quality spouse/partner relations but only under high levels of stress. Findings are inconsistent with\ntraditional moderation hypotheses, which suggest that better quality ties buffer the stress\u00adhealth link and lower quality\nties exacerbate the stress\u00adhealth link. Results offer preliminary evidence concerning how spousal ties \"get under the skin\"\nto influence physical health.\nKey Words: Blood pressure--Cardiovascular health--Marriage--Relationship quality.\nMarriage has significant beneficial effects on health\nand well-being. For instance, married individuals\nreport better physical health (Lorenz, Wickrama, Conger, &\nunmarried individuals (Gardner & Oswald, 2004; Manzoli,\nVillari, Pirone, & Boccia, 2007). Yet, significant diversity\nexists among married individuals in the quality of their mar-\nriages. Recent studies acknowledge that both negative (i.e.,\nirritations and conflict) and positive (i.e., love and support)\naspects of marriage have important implications for health\nand well-being (Slatcher, 2010). Positive quality marriages\nare associated with fewer psychological and physical health\nproblems, whereas negative quality marriages are related\nto poorer health and well-being (Bookwala, 2005; Kiecolt-\nGlaser & Newton, 2001). There is a debate in the literature,\nhowever, regarding whether relationship quality directly or\nThe main effect model suggests that relationship quality has\na direct association with health irrespective of stress levels\n(House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988), whereas the moderat-\ning effect model suggests that relationship quality is par-\nticularly influential under higher levels of stress (Cohen &\nThere is also a debate in the literature regarding the\nspecific biological mechanisms accounting for the links\nbetween relationships and health. The biopsychosocial\nmodel suggests that the cardiovascular system may be a\nsignificant pathway by which relationships influence overall\nhealth status (Seeman, 2003). However, studies of marital/\npartner quality, stress, and cardiovascular health typically\ninvolve younger married couples in a laboratory setting\n(Uchino, Birmingham, & Berg, 2010). We know little about\nthese links in the larger population, and the associations\nbetween relationships and health may be even greater\namong older individuals for whom health problems are\nThis study is designed to address these gaps in the literature\nby examining associations among positive and negative\nmarital/partner quality, perceived stress, and blood pressure\namong a large national sample of older adults. We address\ntwo aims: first, we examine the direct associations among\nmarital/partner quality, stress, and blood pressure; second,\nwe assess whether marital/partner relationship quality\nmoderates the link between stress and blood pressure.\nTheoretical Framework\nThe overarching theoretical framework guiding this\nstudy is referred to as the Biopsychosocial Model of\nMarriage, which incorporates three models: the main and\nmoderating models of relationship quality and the biopsy-\nchosocial model of health (Engel, 1977; Lindau, Laumann,\nLevinson, & Waite, 2003). By including these three mod-\nels, this framework provides an integrative approach to the\nmarriage/health association and the mechanisms that may\nexplain possible links. The main effect model suggests\nthat there is a direct association between relationships and\nhealth irrespective of stress (House et al., 1988; Loucks\ngreater spousal quality predicts better physical and mental\nhealth. The moderating effect model states that spousal/\npartner relationships are particularly influential under\nstressful life circumstances: high-quality relationships may,\nfor example, prevent stress or reduce negative reactions\ntime, poor-quality relationships may exacerbate the influ-\nence of stress on health (August, Rook, & Newsom, 2007).\nFurthermore, according to the biospsychosocial model of\nhealth, social (e.g., relationship quality) and psychological\nfactors (e.g., stress) influence overall health via biological\nThis study examines one particularly important biologi-\ncal pathway that may account for the associations among\nmarital/partner quality, stress, and health: the cardiovascu-\nlar system (Uchino, 2009). The cardiovascular system is\nparticularly important to examine, as heart disease is the\nleading cause of death among older Americans (Delgado,\nJacobs, Lackland, Evans, & Mendes de Leon, 2012). The\ncardiovascular system--the heart and blood vessels--is\nresponsible for maintaining blood flow under changing\nenvironmental circumstances (Krantz & Falconer, 1995).\nBlood pressure is a measure of the functioning of this sys-\ntem (Crimmins & Seeman, 2000), defined as the force of\nblood against the walls of the blood vessels. Systolic pres-\nsure is the point of contraction representing the peak pres-\nsure, whereas diastolic pressure is the minimum pressure\nwhen the heart relaxes. Researchers have found that factors\nsuch as loneliness and increased stress are associated with\nincreased systolic blood pressure (Hawkley, Masi, Berry, &\nassociated with increased diastolic blood pressure (Piazza,\nAlmeida, Dmitrieva, & Klein, 2010). It is particularly\nimportant to examine both systolic and diastolic blood pres-\nsure because the findings vary depending on the measure-\nment, and either measure can be diagnostic of high blood\npressure, that is, individuals can be considered hypertensive\nif systolic pressure is greater than 140mm Hg or diastolic\npressure is greater than 90mm Hg (Williams, Pham-Kanter,\nIt is also especially important to examine blood pressure\namong older adults, since blood pressure tends to increase\nwith age and is associated with increased cardiovascular dis-\nease (Crimmins et al., 2005). Studies show that older peo-\nple show greater systolic blood pressure reactivity to stress\nthan do younger people (Uchino et al., 2010), although\nsome research also suggests that high blood pressure may\nbe protective among the oldest old (Goodwin, 2003). This\nstudy considers associations among marital/partner rela-\ntionship quality, perceived stress, and blood pressure--both\nsystolic and diastolic.\nMain Effect of Relationship Quality and Stress\non Health\nThe relatively small body of research concerning the\ndirect links between positive marital quality and health\nhas revealed mixed findings. Uchino and colleagues\n(1996) reviewed the literature and found that positive\nquality relations with family--typically, a spouse--was\nassociated with improved function of the cardiovascu-\nlar system, above the influence of health-related behav-\niors. Similarly, Holt-Lunstad, Birmingham, and Jones\n(2008) found that positive marital quality was associ-\nated with lower ambulatory blood pressure and overall\nstress. However, positive aspects of relationships are\nnot always beneficial for health. Birditt and Antonucci\n(2008) examined associations between marital quality\n(positive, negative) and mortality among individuals\naged 40-96. Somewhat surprisingly, participants who\nreported greater love from spouses at baseline had higher\nmortality rates.\nNegative aspects of the marital tie are also directly\nlinked with health outcomes in complex ways. Robles\nand Kiecolt-Glaser (2003) found that negative and hostile\nbehaviors during marital conflict discussions were related\nto increased cardiovascular activity. Conversely, negativ-\nity may not always have harmful effects on health. Indeed,\nsome studies show that greater negativity in relationships is\nassociated with improvements in health behaviors, such as\nexercise (Krause, Goldenhar, Liang, Jay, & Maeda, 1993).\nThus, the positive and negative aspects of spousal/partner\nties may have complex associations with blood pressure.\nAdditionally, stress itself is thought to have a main effect\non blood pressure. That is, increased stress is associated\nwith higher blood pressure (Steptoe et al., 2003).\nModerating Effect of Relationship Quality on the\nStress\u00adHealth Link\nA small number of studies conceptualize positive marital\nquality as a buffer or moderator between stress and health\noutcomes. For example, Medalie and Goldbourt (1976)\nfound that, among Israeli men aged 40 and older, support\nand love from a spouse buffered the influence of stress on\nfuture angina. Similarly, happily married working women\nrecovered more quickly from work-related stress than their\nunhappily married counterparts (Saxbe, Repetti, & Nishina,\n2008). In patients recovering from congestive heart failure,\nspouses who reported better quality relationships survived\nmoderating role of spousal support and satisfaction on the\nlink between poor vision and functional limitations among\nolder adults and found inconsistent moderating effects.\nGreater marital satisfaction buffered the link, whereas\ngreater marital support exacerbated the link between poor\nvision and functional limitations. Thus, it appears that\ngreater positive quality relations can buffer or exacerbate\nthe link between stress and health.\nFew studies have examined the exacerbating effects of\nnegative marital relationship quality on the stress\u00adhealth\nlink and results are mixed. Wang and colleagues (2007)\nfound that, in female cardiac patients, thickening of coro-\nnary arterial walls worsened for those who experienced\ngreater marital stress. In contrast, people with chronic ill-\nnesses who reported negative spousal relationships exhib-\nited decreased mortality (Birditt & Antonucci, 2008).\nAntonucci, Birditt, and Webster (2010), however, found no\nexacerbating effects for negative spousal relationship qual-\nity in the association between chronic illness and mortal-\nity. These particular findings highlight the need for further\nunderstanding of the potential role of marital relationship\nquality as a moderator of the stress\u00adhealth link.\nRelationship Quality: Assessing Specific\nBehaviors\nResearch findings regarding positive and negative mari-\ntal quality may be mixed because the behaviors assessed\nwithin the global measures of relationship quality have dis-\nparate associations with health. Recent studies indicate that\nitem-level analyses show a more nuanced--and often more\naccurate--pattern of behavioral correlates (Hoppmann &\nand Antonucci (2008) examined relationship quality items\nseparately and found that participants who reported greater\nspousal love had increased mortality, whereas low levels\nof spousal listening was associated with increased mortal-\nity, indicating that behaviors that are often included in an\noverall positive quality scale (i.e., greater love) may have\nopposite effects. Thus, analyzing behavior at the item level\ncould alleviate some confusion in this area. In this study,\nwe examine two positive quality items and two negative\nquality items separately to assess the degree to which indi-\nviduals confide in their spouse, rely on their spouse for sup-\nport, their spouse is demanding, and their spouse is critical.\nBecause there is no research examining these behaviors\nand blood pressure specifically, we do not make predictions\nat the item level.\nPresent Study\nThis study examines associations among spousal/partner\nquality, stress, and blood pressure among older individu-\nals. Because this study considers spousal quality as well as\nthe quality of relations with live-in partners and romantic\npartners, we refer to quality as spousal/partner relationship\nquality. It is important to examine relationships beyond the\nspousal tie because older individuals are less likely to be in\nmarital relationships compared with middle-aged individu-\nals due to widowhood and divorce (Brown & Lin, 2012;\nowed or divorced may choose not to remarry but to have\nromantic relations or cohabit, and these ties may have sig-\nnificant effects on their health (Chevan, 1996). This study\naddressed two questions:\n1. What are the main effects of spousal/partner relation-\nship quality (positive, negative) and stress on systolic\nand diastolic blood pressure?\nWe hypothesized that individuals with lower quality\nspousal/partner ties (i.e., lower levels of confiding in\nspouse/partner, and/or reliance on spouse/partner for\nhelp, or higher levels of spousal/partner demands and/\nor criticism) would have higher blood pressure. We also\nhypothesized that individuals who reported greater per-\nceived stress would have higher blood pressure.\n2. Does spousal/partner relationship quality moderate\nthe associations between perceived stress and blood\npressure?\nWe hypothesized that the association between perceived\nstress and blood pressure would be weaker among peo-\nple with better quality spousal/partner relationships (i.e.,\nhigher levels of being able to confide in spouse/partner\nand/or being able to rely on spouse/partner for help, as\nwell as lower levels of spousal/partner demands and/or\ncriticism) and stronger among individuals with lower\nquality spousal/partner relationships.\nMethods\nParticipants and Procedure\nParticipants were from the National Social Life, Health,\nand Aging Project (NSHAP; Waite et al., 2010), a nation-\nally representative probability survey of 3,005 individu-\ninvolved multiple stages: two area stages for the selection\nof geographical regions, a household selection stage, and\nan individual selection stage in which one individual was\nselected from each household for the interview. Oldest old,\nmen, African Americans, and Latinos were oversampled.\nParticipants completed at-home, face-to-face interviews that\nincluded a computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) as\nwell as a biomeasure component including blood pressure\nreadings.\nFor the purpose of this study, we included only partici-\npants who were married, living with a partner, or those with\ndred and fifty-nine participants were missing data and were\nthus removed from the study. The final sample included\n1,854 participants with complete data on all predictors, out-\ncomes, and covariates. A total of 1,691 of participants were\nmen), and 108 had romantic partners (63% men). Overall,\nparticipants were in relatively good health, reporting good-\nParticipants were distributed across three age groups: 47%\naged 75\u00ad85 years. We conducted a logistic regression anal-\nysis to determine whether the complete sample varied from\nthose with incomplete data among individuals with partners\n(spouses, cohabiting, or romantic). Individuals with com-\nplete data were more likely to be women and had higher\nself-rated health than individuals with incomplete data.\nThere were no other significant differences for those with\ncomplete data on the demographics (age, education, race),\nspousal/partner relationship quality, or stress. See Table 1\nfor a description of the sample.\nMeasures\nBlood pressure.--Blood pressure readings were taken\nwith the Lifesource digital blood pressure monitor Model\nUA-767PVL, following guidelines adapted from the\nmanufacturer's instruction guide (Williams et al., 2009).\nParticipants were seated with their feet flat on the floor and\ntheir left arm laid on a surface with the palm up. The cuff\nsize was visually estimated and two blood pressure meas-\nurements were taken with a 1\nmin pause between them.\nA third reading was taken if the first two readings were sub-\nstantially different (systolic  20mm Hg/diastolic  14mm\nHg; Williams et al., 2009). The blood pressure scores reflect\nthe mean across the multiple blood pressure readings.\nRelationship quality.--Participants rated the positive and\nnegative qualities of their relationships with a spouse or\nromantic, intimate, or sexual partner. The positive quality\nitems were: \"How often can you open up to your spouse/\npartner if you need to talk about your worries?\" and \"How\noften can you rely on your spouse/partner for help if you\nhave a problem?\" The negative quality items were: \"How\noften does your spouse/partner make too many demands on\nyou?\" and \"How often does your spouse/partner criticize\nyou?\" Participant response options included: 1 (hardly ever\n[or never]), 2 (some of the time), or 3 (often). These items\nare from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) 2002\n(module 6) questionnaire and have been used in subsequent\nwaves of the HRS study. We considered whether to com-\nbine the positive and negative items into scales; however,\nfor negative. In addition, previous studies have found that\nrelationship quality items often behave differently when\npredicting health outcomes and have examined them sepa-\nrately (Birditt &Antonucci, 2008). Thus, we examined each\nitem separately and refer to them as confiding, reliance,\ndemands, and criticism.\nStress.--Participants completed a four-item per-\nceived stress scale derived from Cohen, Karmarck, and\nMermelstein's (1983) global measure of perceived stress.\nThe specific items included: \"I was unable to control impor-\ntant things in my life,\" \"I felt difficulties were piling up so\nhigh that I could not overcome them,\" \"I felt confident about\nmy ability to handle personal problems (reverse coded),\"\nand \"I felt that things were going my way (reverse coded).\"\nParticipant response options included 1 (rarely or none of\nthe time), 2 (some of the time), 3 (occasionally), or 4 (most\nof the time); a mean was calculated to create a stress score\nCovariates.--We included several covariates associated\nwith relationship quality and health (Antonucci, 2001;\n(men).Age was included as a continuous variable. Education\nwas coded as 0 (less than high school) or 1 (high school\nor greater). Race was coded as 1 (non-White) or 0 (white).\nBecause associations with blood pressure vary depending\non whether individuals take antihypertension medicine\n(Qato, Schumm, Johnson, Mihai, & Lindau, 2009), we\ncontrolled for antihypertension medicine in the analyses of\nblood pressure. There is debate in the literature regarding\nthe best methods for adjusting for medication use, and we\nconducted additional sensitivity analyses comparing some\nof the methods in the Results section. Individuals were\ncoded as 1 if they were taking one or more of the following\nTable 1.

Relationship quality rated from 1 (hardly ever [or never]) to 3 (often).\nmedications: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,\nbeta-andrenergic blockers, diuretics, and calcium channel\nAnalysis strategy.--All data were weighted before con-\nducting analyses in line with recommendations for ana-\nlyzing the NSHAP data (O'Muircheartaigh, Eckman, &\nSmith, 2009). The weight takes into account the probabil-\nity of selection and adjusts for nonresponse. In addition to\nthe weight variable, we included variables to adjust for the\nmultiple-stage sampling design.\nWe assessed main effect and moderating models with\nmultiple regression analyses. Main effect models examining\nrelationship quality included all quality items (confiding,\nreliance, demands, criticism) and stress as predictors. The\nmoderating models included the interaction between stress\nand each of the quality variables as predictors. All mod-\nels included gender, age, education, and race as covariates.\nAll continuous variables were grand mean-centered and\ncategorical variables were effect was coded (-1, 1) as sug-\ngested by Aiken and West (1991). Models were estimated\nseparately to predict systolic and diastolic blood pressure.\nSignificant interactions were explored by calculating the\nsimple slopes (Aiken & West, 1991). Interactions were plot-\nted in graphs with stress on the x-axis and blood pressure on\nthe y-axis with relationship quality as the grouping variable\n(1 SD less than and 1 SD greater than the mean).\nResults\nThe results are presented in three sections. First, spouse/\npartner relationship quality, stress, and blood pressure\nare described. Next, the main effects of spouse/partner\nrelationship quality and perceived stress on blood pressure\nwere examined. Finally, the moderating effects of spouse/\npartner relationship quality on the stress\u00adblood pressure\nlink were assessed.\nDescription of the Data\nOverall, participants reported low levels of perceived stress\n(Table 1), as well as high levels of positive relationship quality\nand low levels of negative relationship quality with spouses/\npartners. A total of 43% of the participants had hypertension,\nwhich is defined as systolic greater than or equal to 140mm\nHg or diastolic greater than or equal to 90mm Hg according\nto the American Heart Association guidelines.\nCorrelations among stress, spouse/partner relationship\nquality, and blood pressure were calculated. The two posi-\ntive quality items were positively correlated (r = .43, p <\n.01), and the two negative quality items were positively cor-\nrelated (r = .43, p < .01). The four relationship quality varia-\nbles had low correlations with blood pressure ranging from\n-.003 to .03. Stress was positively correlated with nega-\ntive quality (demands, r = .13, criticize, r = .12; p < .01)\nand negatively correlated with positive relationship quality\n(confide, r = -.16, rely, r = -.16; p < .01). Stress was not\nsignificantly associated with blood pressure.\nWhat are the Main Effects of Spousal/Partner\nRelationship Quality (Positive and Negative) and Stress\non Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure?\nModels revealed that there were no main effects of\nspousal/partner relationship quality or stress on blood pres-\nsure (Table 2). This was inconsistent with our hypotheses\nTable 2. Linear Regression Models Predicting Blood Pressure as a Function of Spousal/Partner Relationship Quality\nSystolic blood pressure Diastolic blood pressure\nthat individuals who reported greater spouse/partner rela-\ntionship quality and lower stress would have lower blood\npressure.\nDoes Spousal/Partner Relationship Quality Moderate\nthe Associations Between Perceived Stress and Blood\nPressure?\nModels revealed moderating effects of spousal relation-\nship quality on the stress\u00adblood pressure link.\nPositive spousal quality.--We found significant inter-\nactions between spousal/partner confiding and stress\nwhen predicting systolic and diastolic blood pressure\n(Table 2). Consistent with our hypothesis, the simple\nslope tests revealed that the association between stress\nand systolic blood pressure was negative among partici-\npants who reported higher levels of confiding (B = -3.53,\np < .05; Figure 1). The association between stress and\nblood pressure was not significant among participants\nwho reported lower levels of confiding. The simple slope\ntests for diastolic blood pressure were similar, but only\napproached significance. Overall, these findings indicate\nthat the association between stress and blood pressure\nmay be reduced among individuals with greater spousal\nconfiding.\nWe also found significant interactions between relying\non a spouse/partner and stress when predicting systolic\nand diastolic blood pressure (Table 2; Figures 2 and 3).\nUnexpectedly and inconsistent with our hypothesis, the\nassociation between stress and blood pressure was negative\namong individuals who reported lower relying on spouse/\np < .05). The slopes were not significant among people who\nreported greater reliance on spouse/partner. This finding\nindicates that relying less on spouse/partners moderates\nthe stress\u00adblood pressure link. Interestingly, relying less\non a spouse/partner appeared to have negative effects on\nhealth when individuals were under low levels of stress but\nbeneficial effects on health when individuals were under\nhigh levels of stress.\nNegative spousal quality.--We found a significant inter-\naction between spouse/partner demands and stress when\npredicting systolic blood pressure (Table 2; Figure 4).\nUnexpectedly, the association between stress and systolic\nblood pressure was negative among people who reported\ngreater spouse/partner demands (B = -3.53, p < .05). In con-\ntrast, there was no association between stress and systolic\nblood pressure among people who reported lower spouse/\npartner demands. This finding indicates that the stress\u00ad\nblood pressure link is moderated by greater spousal/part-\nner demands. It appears that high spousal/partner demands\nwere associated with poorer health among individuals with\nlower stress but better health among individuals under\nhigher stress.\nPost Hoc Analyses\nThe associations among stress, relationship quality, and\nblood pressure may vary depending on whether individuals\nare in more committed relationships or not (married/living\nwith partner vs. romantic partners). Therefore, models were\nreestimated excluding individuals with romantic partners.\nAll findings were the same with one exception. The stress\nby confiding interaction predicting systolic blood pressure\nbecame a trend, which may have been due to the decrease\nin power after removing romantic partners.\nThe associations may also vary depending on the duration\nof the relationship. Relationship duration information was\navailable for individuals who were married or cohabitating;\nthus analyses were estimated controlling for relationship\nduration among the married and cohabitating individuals,\nand the same pattern of results emerged.\nFigure 1. Systolic blood pressure as a function of stress and confiding with spouse/partner.\nFigure 2. Systolic blood pressure as a function of stress and reliance on spouse/partner.\nFigure 3. Diastolic blood pressure as a function of stress and reliance on spouse/partner.\nFigure 4. Systolic blood pressure as a function of stress and spousal/partner demands.\nBecause the spousal tie and links between the spousal\ntie and health often varies by gender (Kiecolt-Glaser &\nNewton, 2001), models were reestimated with all possible\ntwo-way and three-way interactions among relationship\nquality, stress, and gender. Although there were two signifi-\ncant three-way interactions when predicting diastolic blood\npressure, one among gender, criticism, and stress and the\nother among gender, demands, and stress, the tests of the\nsimple slopes were not significant.\nWe were concerned that participants may have varied in\ntheir overall physical health, which may account for some\nof the associations. Self-rated health is a particularly impor-\ntant determinant of well-being in the spousal relationship\n(Pruchno, Wilson-Genderson, & Cartwright, 2009). Thus,\nall models were estimated again controlling for self-rated\nphysical health, and the findings remained the same.\nFinally, there is debate regarding whether to control for\nantihypertension medication when predicting blood pres-\nsure or to use other methods of adjustment (Tobin, Sheehan,\nScurrah, & Burton, 2005). Analyses were conducted again\nwithout controlling for hypertension medicine, and the find-\nings remained the same.Analyses were also conducted after\nadding a constant of 10 to systolic and a constant of 5 to\ndiastolic blood pressure among individuals taking antihy-\npertension medication as recommended in previous studies,\nand the same pattern of results emerged (Cui, Hopper, &\nDiscussion\nUsing data from the NSHAP, this study examined asso-\nciations among spousal/partner relationship quality, stress,\nand blood pressure. Results support the moderating effect\nmodel which posits that in the context of stressful life events\nor circumstances, spousal/partner relationships are particu-\nlarly influential by either preventing stress or reducing nega-\ntive reactions to it. We found no evidence for the main effect\nmodel, which posits that a direct association between rela-\ntionship quality and health exists irrespective of stress. The\nfindings also showed that the effects of relationship quality\nare nuanced, with both negative and positive relationships\nhaving unique effects in the stress\u00adhealth link. This study\nmakes a distinctive contribution to the literature by exam-\nining the link between spousal/partner relationship qual-\nity and blood pressure in the presence of perceived stress\namong older individuals and providing insights into the\nmechanisms linking spousal/partner relations and health.\nThese results support the body of research that identifies\nbiological pathways linking social relationships to health\n(Uchino et al., 1996). According to the biopsychosocial\nmodel of health, social and psychological factors influence\noverall health via biological pathways or mechanisms such\nas the cardiovascular system (Engel, 1977). In line with this\nmodel, this research examined the implications of social\n(spousal/partner quality) and psychological factors (stress)\nfor the cardiovascular system (blood pressure) in order to\nfurther understand the spousal relationship\u00adhealth link. The\nfindings suggest that the cardiovascular system may be an\nimportant pathway by which relationships \"get under the\nskin\" to influence health.\nFew studies conceptualize spousal/partner quality as a\nmoderator between stress and health outcomes. For those\nthat do, particularly those examining negative relationship\nqualities, the results have been mixed (Antonucci et al.,\nfurther understanding regarding the role of not only nega-\ntive spousal/partner relationship quality in the association\nbetween stress and health, but also a more complex picture\nof the role of positive spousal/partner quality. Furthermore,\nthis study revealed that marriage as well as cohabitation\nand romantic partners have important influences on health\namong older adults. Our focus on older adults is also novel,\ngiven that the majority of previous research has focused on\nyounger couples. For older adults, chronic health problems\nare likely to be more prevalent, especially in the case of\nhigher blood pressure and cardiovascular disease (Crimmins\nPositive Relationship Quality\nThe present findings concerning positive spousal/partner\nquality as a moderator between stress and health are only\nsomewhat consistent with the sparse literature on this topic.\nThe moderator model suggests that positive quality rela-\ntionships buffer the influence of stress on health. However,\nwe did not find links between stress and health, which is\nnecessary for a buffering model (Cohen & Wills, 1985).\nThis study showed that the association between stress and\nhealth does vary by positive quality ties but in expected\nand unexpected ways. Specifically, the negative association\nbetween stress and blood pressure for participants reporting\nhigher levels of confiding with their spouse/partner corre-\nsponds with research concerning recovery from both work\nstress and congestive heart failure. That is, happily married\nwomen recovered from work-related stress more quickly\nthan unhappily married women (Saxbe et al., 2008), and\npatients recovering from congestive heart failure who\nreported better quality relationships survived longer (Coyne\net al., 2001). Thus, greater confiding in spouses appears to\nreduce the association between stress and blood pressure.\nHowever, counter to our hypothesis, we found no\nassociation between stress and blood pressure for\nindividuals reporting high reliance on their spouse, a finding\nwhich does not entirely support previous literature. In fact,\nthe stress\u00adhealth link was negative only among participants\nwho reported lower spousal/partner reliance. Bookwala\n(2011) similarly found that greater spousal support\nexacerbated the link between poor vision and functional\nhealth. This finding is consistent with research concerning\nthe dependence-support script and the independence-ignore\nscript (Baltes, 1996), which holds that, for older individuals\nespecially, dependent behaviors tend to elicit more attention;\nmeanwhile, independent behaviors are essentially ignored.\nParticularly in long-term or close relationships, where\nbehaviors tend to become ingrained, these scripts can lead\nto a loss of autonomy and control and may exacerbate any\nsense of helplessness and frustration in a stressful situation.\nIndeed, studies show that individuals may perceive support\nas over-protective or ineffective, which can be harmful to\nhealth (Hagedoorn et al., 2000). The findings also support\nthe research indicating that individuals who receive support\nthat they are not aware of (i.e., invisible support) have better\nwell-being (Bolger, Kessler, & Zuckerman, 2000).\nDue to the cross-sectional nature of the study design,\nhowever, it is possible that blood pressure influences rela-\ntionship processes in the contexts of different stress levels.\nFor example, individuals with lower blood pressure may\nrely less on spouses in times of stress because they feel less\nvulnerable and may have more diverse networks (with other\nties to rely on) than individuals with higher blood pressure.\nNegative Relationship Quality\nInterestingly, greater negative relationship quality moder-\nated the stress\u00adhealth link but not in a way that was con-\nsistent with the exacerbation model. Inconsistent with our\nhypothesis, greater spousal demands appeared to reduce the\nlink between stress and blood pressure. Similarly, Birditt and\nAntonucci (2008) found that individuals with life-threaten-\ning illnesses survived longer when they reported greater neg-\native spousal quality (high demands or criticism). Spousal/\npartner demands may be necessary or helpful (e.g., demands\nto comply with a medical regimen or to think deeply about a\nstressful situation). Likewise, spousal demands may involve\ndemands for support, which may be beneficial for health.\nProviding support to spouses is associated with better health\nthan receiving support (Brown, Nesse, Vinokur, & Smith,\n2003). In contrast, spouses with higher blood pressure\nwho are under greater stress may receive greater spousal\ndemands (e.g., to exercise or take medication). Because of\nthe cross-sectional nature of the study design, we are unable\nto determine the specific direction of effects.\nLimitations and Future Directions\nAs with most studies, the present research has limita-\ntions. Although rich, these data are cross-sectional and\nas such cannot identify directional links. Future research\nwould benefit from follow-up studies with these particu-\nlar participants (or other longitudinal studies) in order to\nexamine bidirectional links among spouse/partner relation-\nship quality, perceived stress, and blood pressure over time.\nMeasurement of all constructs of interest--marital quality,\nstress, and blood pressure--could no doubt have been more\nthorough, a situation common to survey research. As an\nexample, only four items assessed relationship quality; we\nlack information regarding the relationship processes that\nunderlie the reports of relationship quality. For instance, do\nspousal or partner demands include those involving health\nbehaviors? We need to include more extensive measures\nof spousal/partner quality in future studies (e.g., conflict,\ncoping strategies, and satisfaction with support). Further,\nthe measurement of blood pressure did not include controls\nsuch as a specified rest time prior to measurement or prohi-\nbition of caffeinated beverages, which are often included in\nmore controlled laboratory or clinical settings.\nMoreover, this study did not examine the influence of\nother potentially important relationships, such as relation-\nships with children, grandchildren, extended family, and\nfriends. These types of relationships, beyond the spouse/\npartner relationship, are important to assess as they can\nprovide important resources in times of stress, and thus\nshed light on the broader social milieu in which the stress\u00ad\nhealth link resides.\nThis study highlights the often complicated nature of\nspouse/partner relationship quality, stress, and their asso-\nciations with biological pathways. Stress appears to be\nless detrimental for health when individuals perceive their\nspousal/partner tie as emotionally supportive, less reliable,\nand more demanding. These findings emphasize the impor-\ntance of examining the influence of multiple dimensions of\nspousal/partner relationship quality on the health processes\nof older adults.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National Institute of Aging (AG029879\nto K.S.B.).\n"
