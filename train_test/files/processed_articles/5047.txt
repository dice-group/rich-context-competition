    "abstract": "Abstract: As part of the International Sexuality Description Project, 13,243 participants from 46\nnations responded to self-report measures of personality and mating behavior. Several traits\nshowed consistent links with short-term mating. Extraversion positively correlated with interest\nin short-term mating, unrestricted sociosexuality, having engaged in short-term mate poaching\nattempts, having succumbed to short-term poaching attempts of others, and lacking relationship\nexclusivity. Low levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness also related to short-term mating,\nespecially with extra-pair mating. Neuroticism and openness were associated with short-term\nmating as well, but these links were less consistent across sex and nation. Nation-level links\nbetween personality and sexuality replicated within-region findings, such as the strong\nassociation between national extraversion and national sociosexuality. Discussion focuses on the\norigins of personality-sexuality links and their implications across nations.\n",

But there are reproductively-relevant costs to short-term mating as well, for\nancestral humans as assuredly as for modern humans. For example, short-term mating\n1 All editorial decisions were handled by Associate Editor Dr. Steven Platek\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\nbehaviors--including variants such as promiscuity, infidelity, and the poaching of other people's\nlong-term partners--represent significant health concerns to individuals, relationships, and\nsocieties throughout the world. Short-term mating can lead to relationship dissolution (Bringle\nand Buunk, 1991; Gottman, 1994), sexual jealousy and violent retribution by aggrieved partners\n(Buss, 2000; Malamuth, 1998), and the contraction of sexually-transmitted diseases and\ninfections (Mashegoane, Moalusi, Ngoepe, and Peltzer, 2002; Pinkerton and Abramson, 1996).\nIn sub-Saharan Africa alone, 23 million adults are currently infected with HIV, with most cases\ntraceable to instances of short-term mating (Shelton et al., 2004).\nAn important task for personality psychologists is to identify those individual differences\nmost closely associated with short-term mating. Doing so would give scientists a better\nframework for understanding the etiology of permissive sexual attitudes and risky sexual\npractices (Trobst, Herbst, Masters, and Costa, 2002). Previous research suggests some of the\ntraits from the Big Five model of personality (Digman, 1990; Goldberg, 1990) are associated\nWright, 1999; Wright and Reise, 1997). In this article, the links among all five dimensions of the\nBig Five and multiple measures of short-term mating were examined across 46 nations\nrepresenting 10 major regions of the world.\nPersonality Traits and Short-Term Mating\nPerhaps the strongest personality predictor of short-term mating is impulsive sensation-\nseeking (Hoyle et al., 2000; Zuckerman and Kuhlman, 2000). Studies have consistently linked\nsensation-seeking to short-term mating (Franzini and Sidemen, 1994; Linton and Wiener, 2001;\nMashegoane et al., 2002; Ripa, Hansen, Mortensen, Sanders, and Reinisch, 2001), including\nmen's patronage of prostitutes (Wilson, Manual, and Lavelle, 1992). Impulsive sensation-\nseeking is closely associated with the Big Five dimensions of low agreeableness and low\nconscientiousness (Zuckerman, 1994; Zuckerman, Kuhlman, Joireman, Teta, and Kraft, 1994).\nNot surprisingly, low agreeableness and low conscientiousness have been linked directly to\nshort-term sexual behavior across many studies (Barta and Kiene, 2005; Buss and Shackelford,\nBased on his three-factor model of personality, Eysenck (1971, 1976) has argued that\nextraversion is central to explaining individual differences in sexuality, including many facets of\nshort-term mating. For example, extraverts are more likely than introverts to endorse favorable\nattitudes about having multiple sex partners and to engage in sexual intercourse with more\npartners than introverts do (Eysenck, 1976; Eysenck and Eysenck, 1975). Similar associations\nbetween extraversion and short-term mating have been documented by others (Barnes,\nSimpson, and Gangestad, 1986), including links with extra-pair mating and promiscuous sexual\nbehavior (Buss and Shackelford, 1997; Pinkerton and Abramson, 1995; Schenk and Pfrang,\nneuroticism correlates with facets of short-term mating (Lameiras Fernandez and Rodriguez\nCastro, 2003; Zuckerman, 1993), including more sexual risk-taking (Ball and Schottenfeld,\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\nPersonality Traits and Short-Term Mating across Nations\nMost of the studies and findings reporting associations between personality traits and\nshort-term mating have been based on responses from college students residing in the United\nStates or the United Kingdom. We attempted to replicate and extend these findings in three\nways. First, we examined the entire Big Five model in relation to short-term mating. We were\nparticularly interested in whether some Big Five traits are more closely linked with short-term\nmating than others. Second, we examined a wide variety of short-term mating variables,\nincluding interest in short-term mating, short-term mating behavior, and both the infidelity and\npromiscuity facets of short-term mating (Schmitt and Buss, 2000). Third, we assessed these\nvariables across multiple college student and community samples from 46 nations representing\n10 major regions of the world, including North America (represented by 3 nations; see Table 1),\nSouth America (four nations), Western Europe (eight nations), Eastern Europe (ten nations),\nSouthern Europe (five nations), the Middle East (three nations), Africa (five nations), Oceania\n(three nations), South/Southeast Asia (one nation), and East Asia (four nations).\nAssessing personality and short-term mating across nations is important for several\nreasons. First, many psychologists have suggested that it is critical to conduct cross-cultural\nstudies on correlates of personality instead of simply assuming their universality (Church and\nLonner, 1998). Heine and his colleagues, for example, comment that most personality research\nhas been \"conducted by North American researchers at North American universities with North\nAmerican participants using methodologies that were developed in North America\" (Heine,\nLehman, Markus, and Kitayama, 1999, p. 768). Such criticisms evoke concerns about the\ngeneralizability of the personality predictors of short-term mating previously described and attest\nto the necessity of replicating findings across diverse nations. Second, there is reason to believe\nthat nations vary in their Big Five personality traits (McCrae, 2002), including how variable\npeople are along these personality dimensions (Allik and McCrae, 2004; McCrae, 2001). Along\nwith evidence that short-term mating behavior also varies across nations (Schmitt, 2005a;\nSchmitt et al., 2003), the present study helps to identify whether the same personality systems are\nuniversally active in the etiology of short-term mating attitudes and behaviors. Third, if nations\ndo vary in the personality correlates of short-term mating, any application of individual\ndifference findings, such as attempts to reduce the incidence of short-term mating, would need to\ntake into account these cultural caveats.\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\nTable 1.

As shown in Table 1, the present dataset included 46 nations from\nthe world regions of North America (n = 3,525), South America (n = 622), Western Europe (n =\nFollowing previous work (Schmitt et al., 2003), and in an effort to present the key results as\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\nconcisely as possible, we will focus most of the current analyses at the level of world region. All\nnation-level results are available from the first author.\nMost samples were comprised of college students; some included college students plus\ngeneral members of the community; and two (Finland and Mexico) consisted solely of\ncommunity members (see Table 1). All samples were convenience samples. Most samples were\nrecruited as volunteers, some received course credit for participation, and some received a small\nmonetary reward for their participation. All samples were administered an anonymous self-report\nsurvey, and most surveys were returned via sealed envelope or the usage of a drop-box. This\nform of assessment tends to minimize response biases involving sexual surveys (Alexander and\nFisher, 2003; Andersen and Broffitt, 1988). Return rates for college student samples tended to be\nhigh (around 95%), although this number was lower in some nations. Return rates for community\nsamples were around 50%. Further details on the sampling and assessment procedures within\neach nation are provided elsewhere (Schmitt et al., 2003, 2004) and are available from the first\nauthor.\nProcedure\nParticipants were provided with a brief description of the study, including the following\ninstructions: \"This questionnaire is entirely voluntary.

No identifying information is\nrequested on this survey, nor will any such information be added later to this survey. If any of\nthe questions make you uncomfortable, feel free not to answer them. You are free to withdraw\nfrom this study at any time for any reason. This series of questionnaires should take about 20\nminutes to complete. Thank you for your participation.\" Details on incentives and cover stories\nused across samples are available from the first author.\nMeasures\nResearchers from non-English-speaking nations were asked to use a translation/back-\ntranslation process and to administer the ISDP in their native language. This procedure involved\nthe primary collaborator translating the measures into the native language of the participants, and\nthen having a second person back-translate into English. Differences between the original\nEnglish and the back-translation were discussed, and mutual agreements were made on the most\nappropriate translation. This procedure balances the needs of making the translation meaningful\nand naturally readable to the native participants, while preserving the original psychological\nMorocco, Ethiopia, Fiji, the Philippines, and Hong Kong were administered the survey in\nEnglish, with certain terms and phrases annotated to clarify what were thought to be confusing\nwords for the participants. The translation of the ISDP survey into Flemish used only a\ntranslation procedure, as this involved mainly word variant changes from the original Dutch.\nFinally, pilot studies were conducted in several testing sites to clarify translation and\ncomprehension concerns.\nDemographic measure. Each sample was presented with a demographic measure\nincluding questions about sex (male or female), age, ethnicity, date of birth, sexual orientation,\nsocioeconomic status, and current relationship status. Not all of these questions were included in\nall samples (e.g., date of birth was considered too invasive in some samples), and all\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\ncollaborators were asked to adapt the demographic questions appropriately for their sample (e.g.,\nethnic categories varied).\nShort-term mating measures. Short-term mating is not a one-dimensional construct. Some\nindividuals seek short-term sexual relationships in addition to their long-term relationships (i.e.,\ninfidelity; Wiederman, 1997). Others seek short-term partners as their primary mode of mating\n(i.e., promiscuity; Paul, McManus, and Hayes, 2000). Still others may possess high levels of\ninterest in short-term mating, but are not able or willing to engage in short-term mating (Jackson\nand Kirkpatrick, 2007; Webster and Bryan, 2007). Each of these facets of short-term mating are\nlikely interrelated, given that low levels of short-term sexual interest would lead to relatively\nlittle short-term mating behavior. However, because of the potential differences between sexual\ninterests and behaviors, short-term mating was assessed in the present study using multiple\nmeasures.\nIncluded first was a 7-item index designed to assess current interest in short-term mating,\nthe Short-Term Mating Interests scale (see Schmitt, 2005b). The first three Short-Term Mating\nInterests items are from the Number of Partners measure (Buss and Schmitt, 1993; Fenigstein\nand Preston, 2007; Schmitt et al., 2003), which asks using open-ended scales for the number of\nsex partners desired across various future time periods. Three of the most commonly analyzed\nitems include the time periods of \"one month,\" \"one year,\" and \"five years\" (Schmitt,\nShackelford, Duntley, Tooke, and Buss, 2001; Schmitt et al., 2003). For Short-Term Mating\nInterests, all values on these three items that were above three were truncated down to three to\ncontrol for extreme values (see Schmitt, in press). The next three Short-Term Mating Interests\nitems are from the Time Known measure (Buss and Schmitt, 1993; Schmitt et al., 2003), which\nasks the likelihood of consenting to sex with someone who is desirable (using a scale of +3 =\ndefinitely yes to \u00ad3 = definitely not) after knowing that person for various time intervals. For\nShort-Term Mating Interests, the time periods of \"one month,\" \"one year,\" and \"five years\" were\nused. Also included in Short-Term Mating Interests was the Short-Term Seeking scale (Buss and\n(currently not at all seeking a short-term mate) to 7 (currently strongly seeking a short-term\nmate). Responses to all seven items (three from the Number of Partners measure, three from the\nTime Known measure, and the Short-Term Seeking scale) were summed to form the Short-Term\nMating Interests scale (see also Schmitt, 2005b). Cronbach's alpha for Short-Term Mating\nInterests across the ISDP was .80 (see Table 2).\nA 7-item measure of willingness to have sex without commitment, the Sociosexual\nOrientation Inventory (Simpson and Gangestad, 1991) also was administered to participants in\nthe ISDP. The first three items of the Sociosexual Orientation Inventory are intended to capture\nbehavioral expressions of short-term mating. Item one is: \"With how many different partners\nhave you had sex (sexual intercourse) within the past year?\" Item two is: \"How many different\npartners do you foresee yourself having sex with during the next five years? (Please give a\nspecific, realistic estimate).\" Item three is: \"With how many different partners have you had sex\non one and only one occasion?\" Open-ended blanks are provided after each of the first three\nquestions of the Sociosexual Orientation Inventory. The fourth item is designed to measure\ncovert sociosexual behavior: \"How often do (did) you fantasize about having sex with someone\nother than your current (most recent) dating partner?\" This item is followed by an 8-point scale,\nranging from 1 (never) to 8 (at least once a day). Items five, six, and seven are designed to\nmeasure sociosexual attitudes. Item five is: \"Sex without love is OK.\" Item six is: \"I can imagine\nmyself being comfortable and enjoying \"casual\" sex with different partners.\" Item seven is: \"I\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\nwould have to be closely attached to someone (both emotionally and psychologically) before I\ncould feel comfortable and fully enjoy having sex with him or her.\" All three attitudinal items\nare followed by 9-point scales ranging from 1 (I strongly disagree) to 9 (I strongly agree).\nResponses to item seven are reverse-coded so that higher scores indicate more unrestricted\nsociosexuality. According to Simpson and Gangestad (1991), items five, six, and seven are\nhighly correlated and should be merged to form a single \"attitudinal\" score. This attitudinal score\nis then combined with the first four items to form the total Sociosexual Orientation Inventory\ncomposite measure. However, each item of the Sociosexual Orientation Inventory composite\nmeasure is first weighted using the following formula: (5 * Item One) + (1 * Item Two [with a\ncap on Item Two of 30])) + (5 * Item Three) + (4 * Item Four) + (2 * Mean of Items Five, Six,\nand Seven) = Total Sociosexuality (Simpson and Gangestad, 1991). Using this formula produces\na Sociosexual Orientation Inventory composite such that higher scores are associated with\nunrestricted sociosexuality (i.e., more short-term mating). In this study, Cronbach's alpha for the\nSociosexual Orientation Inventory was .80.\nAll participants were presented with a questionnaire entitled \"Anonymous Romantic\nAttraction Survey\" (Schmitt and Buss, 2001). The Anonymous Romantic Attraction Survey asks\na series of questions about personal experiences with romantic attraction and mate poaching (i.e.,\nromantically attracting someone else's partner). Each rating scale on the questionnaire asks\nparticipants to describe their experiences with a specific attraction behavior. For the frequency of\nattempting or succumbing to mate poaching behaviors, rating scale values range from 1 (Never)\nto 7 (Always). Intermediate values are labeled rarely, seldom, sometimes, frequently, and almost\nalways. For the degree of success in mate poaching, rating scales range from 1 (Not at all\nsuccessful) to 7 (Very successful). An intermediate value of 4 (Moderately successful) also is\nprovided. These frequency and degree anchors tend to maximize the interval-level quality of\nrating scale data (Spector, 1992). Two items from the Anonymous Romantic Attraction Survey\nare relevant to the present study. The first question asks about the frequency with which\nparticipants have attempted to short-term mate poach, \"Have you ever tried to attract someone\nwho was already in a romantic relationship with someone else for a short-term sexual\nrelationship with you?\" The second question asks \"While you were in a romantic relationship, if\nothers attempted to obtain you as a short-term sexual partner, how successful have they been (if\nothers have never tried, skip this question)?\" Responses to this item are a direct indicator of\nprevious infidelities.\nSamples were then administered a measure of the \"Sexy Seven\" sexuality attributes\n(Schmitt and Buss, 2000). The Sexy Seven measure asks participants to rate themselves\ncompared to others they know (using a nine-point scale from 1 = Extremely Inaccurate to 9 =\nExtremely Accurate) on a list of 67 sexually-connotative adjectives. The Sexy Seven includes\none scale designed to capture variability in short-term mating, the Relationship Exclusivity scale.\nThe Relationship Exclusivity scale contains the following adjectival items: \"adulterous [reverse-\nscored],\" \"devoted,\" \"faithful,\" \"loose [reverse-scored],\" \"monogamous,\" polygamous [reverse-\nscored],\" \"promiscuous [reverse-scored],\" and \"unfaithful [reverse-scored].\" In this study, the\nRelationship Exclusivity scale had a Cronbach's alpha of .78 (see Table 2). Further\npsychometrics on the Relationship Exclusivity scale can be found in Schmitt and Buss (2000).\nFor the purposes of this study, we will refer to the Relationship Exclusivity scale as a \"Lack of\nRelationship Exclusivity\" such that it will correlate in the same direction as all other measures of\nshort-term mating.\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\nAll measures of short-term mating were intercorrelated among both men and women.\nAmong men, short-term mating interests correlated with sociosexuality, r(4207) = +0.48, p <\nintercorrelations among sexuality measures are available from the first author.\nPersonality trait measure. Participants completed the Big Five Inventory (BFI), a\nmeasure of the Big Five that has proven effective across nations and languages (Benet-Martinez\nand John, 1998). The first scale of the BFI is Extraversion, which includes individual differences\nin positive emotionality, sociability, energy levels, and talkativeness, among others (Costa and\nthe Extraversion scale was .79. The second scale from the BFI is Agreeableness, which includes\nindividual differences in kindness, empathy, interpersonal trust, and humility (see Graziano and\nEisenberg, 1997). In this study, Cronbach's alpha for the Agreeableness scale was .71. The third\nscale from the BFI is Conscientiousness (i.e., tending to be organized, reliable, hardworking, and\npossessing high integrity; Hogan and Ones, 1997). In this study, Cronbach's alpha for the\nConscientiousness scale was .79. The fourth scale of the BFI measures neuroticism. Neuroticism\nis related to several personality disorders (Costa and Widiger, 1994) and is conceptually\nanchored in high anxiety, depression, and vulnerability to stress. In this study, Cronbach's alpha\nfor the Neuroticism scale was .80. The final scale from the BFI is Openness. People high in\nopenness tend to be imaginative, creative, introspective, and cultured (McCrae and Costa, 1997).\nIn this study, Cronbach's alpha for the Openness scale was .77.\nResults\nTable 2 includes the means and standard deviations of men and women across all\nmeasures of personality and short-term mating. Men and women were significantly different on\nall measures of personality. Women scored higher on extraversion, agreeableness,\nconscientiousness, and neuroticism. Men scored higher on openness. In terms of the magnitude\nof the sex differences, Cohen (1988) suggests that an effect size (d) of \u00b10.20 be considered\nsmall, \u00b10.50 be considered medium, and \u00b10.80 be considered large. Although women scored\nsignificantly higher on many personality traits, most of these differences were less than small in\nmagnitude. The one exception involved neuroticism, in which women scored moderately higher\nthan men (d = -0.46). Men scored significantly higher on all measure of short-term mating, with\nsmall to medium effect sizes in short-term mating interests (d = 0.68), sociosexuality (d = 0.74),\nlevels of short-term mate poaching attempts (d = 0.42), levels of having succumbed to short-term\nmate poaching (d = 0.31), and in having a lack of relationship exclusivity (d = 0.53).\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\nTable 2.

Moreover, these correlations were pervasive across sex, and across most major regions\nof the world (see Table 3).\nNorth and South America. Among North American men, higher extraversion was\nassociated significantly with interest in short-term mating, unrestricted sociosexuality, short-term\nmate poaching attempts, and lower relationship exclusivity (i.e., greater infidelity). Among North\nAmerican women, higher extraversion was associated significantly with interest in short-term\nmating, unrestricted sociosexuality, short-term mate poaching attempts, and acquiescence to\nshort-term poaching attempts. In South America, all of the correlations between extraversion and\nshort-term mating were positive, although only four reached statistical significance (see Table 3).\nAmong South American men, higher extraversion was associated significantly with higher\nsociosexuality (i.e., more short-term mating), short-term mate poaching attempts, and lower\nrelationship exclusivity. Among South American women, higher extraversion was associated\nsignificantly with higher sociosexuality.\nEurope. In Western Europe, most correlations between extraversion and short-term\nmating were positive and several reached statistical significance. Among Western European\nmen, higher extraversion was associated significantly with higher sociosexuality and more\nfrequent short-term mate poaching attempts. Among Western European women, higher\nextraversion was associated significantly with higher sociosexuality, more frequent short-term\nmate poaching attempts, and lower relationship exclusivity. In Eastern Europe, all associations\nbetween extraversion and short-term mating were positive and significant, demonstrating the\nmost consistent links between extraversion and short-term mating for any world region. In\nSouthern Europe, the same pattern found in Western Europe was evident. Namely, higher\nextraversion was associated significantly with higher sociosexuality and short-term mate\npoaching among men and women, and lower relationship exclusivity for women.\nMiddle East and Africa. In the Middle East, extraversion was associated significantly\nwith unrestricted sociosexuality, short-term mate poaching attempts, and lower relationship\nexclusivity among men. Among Middle Eastern women, higher extraversion was associated\nsignificantly only with lower relationship exclusivity. Among African men, higher extraversion\nwas associated significantly with more short-term mating interest and more short-term mate\npoaching attempts. For women in Africa, higher extraversion was associated significantly with\nmore short-term mating interest and more unrestricted sociosexuality.\nOceania, South/Southeast Asia, and East Asia. Among Oceanic men, higher extraversion\nwas associated significantly with interest in short-term mating, unrestricted sociosexuality, and\nlower relationship exclusivity. Among Oceanic women, higher extraversion was associated\nsignificantly only with short-term mate poaching attempts. In South/Southeast Asia, higher\nextraversion was associated significantly with a more unrestricted sociosexual orientation and\nmore frequent short-term mate poaching attempts. For women in South/Southeast Asia, higher\nextraversion was only associated significantly with a more unrestricted sociosexuality. In East\nAsia, higher extraversion was associated significantly with more short-term mating interest,\nmore unrestricted sociosexuality, and more short-term mate poaching attempts among both men\nand women.\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\nTable 3.

Moreover, these correlations were pervasive across sex, and across many major regions\nof the world (see Table 3).\nNorth and South America. Among North American men, lower agreeableness was\nassociated significantly with interest in short-term mating, unrestricted sociosexuality, short-term\nmate poaching attempts, succumbing to short-term mate poaching attempts, and lower\nrelationship exclusivity (i.e., greater infidelity). Among North American women, lower\nagreeableness was associated significantly with interest in short-term mating, unrestricted\nsociosexuality, short-term mate poaching attempts, succumbing to short-term mate poaching\nattempts, and lower relationship exclusivity. Among both men and women, it appeared that the\nlink was strongest between low agreeableness and low relationship exclusivity. For example,\nusing Fisher's r to z' transformation, the correlation between agreeableness and lacking\nrelationship exclusivity among women, r(2183) = -.20, p < .001, was stronger than the links\nbetween agreeableness and interests in short-term mating, z = 2.31, p < .01, unrestricted\nsuccumbing to short-term mate poaching, z = 2.83, p < .01. In South America, most of the\ncorrelations between agreeableness and short-term mating were negative, although only the\ncorrelation with succumbing to short-term mate poaching was significant for men (see Table 3).\nEurope. In Western Europe, most correlations between agreeableness and short-term\nmating were negative and all but one reached statistical significance. Among Western European\nmen, lower agreeableness was associated with more short-term mating interest, higher\nsociosexuality, more frequent short-term mate poaching attempts, and lower relationship\nexclusivity. Among Western European women, lower agreeableness was associated with every\nmeasure of short-term mating. Again, the strongest links were between agreeableness and\nrelationship exclusivity. In Eastern Europe, all associations between agreeableness and short-\nterm mating were negative and most were significant for both men and women, especially lower\nrelationship exclusivity. In Southern Europe, all associations between agreeableness and short-\nterm mating were negative and all were significant among both men and women. As with most\nof Europe and North America, the links between agreeableness and relationship exclusivity were\nnumerically the largest associations.\nMiddle East and Africa. In the Middle East, low agreeableness was associated\nsignificantly with short-term mating interest, unrestricted sociosexuality, short-term mate\npoaching attempts, and lower relationship exclusivity among men. Among Middle Eastern\nwomen, lower agreeableness was associated significantly with unrestricted sociosexuality, short-\nterm mate poaching attempts, and with lower relationship exclusivity. For both men and women,\nthe links with relationship exclusivity were numerically the greatest. Among African men, lower\nagreeableness was associated with short-term mating interest, unrestricted sociosexuality, short-\nterm mate poaching attempts, and a lack of relationship exclusivity. For women in Africa, lower\nagreeableness was associated significantly with more unrestricted sociosexuality and with\nmaking short-term mate poach attempts.\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\nOceania, South/Southeast Asia, and East Asia. Among Oceanic men, lower agreeableness\nwas associated significantly with more interest in short-term mating, more unrestricted\nsociosexuality, having succumbed to short-term mate poaching attempts, and with lower\nrelationship exclusivity. Among Oceanic women, lower agreeableness was associated\nsignificantly with all facets of short-term mating. Again, the links between agreeableness and\nshort-term mating were numerically greatest with lower relationship exclusivity. In\nSouth/Southeast Asia, lower agreeableness was associated only with lower relationship\nexclusivity, and this was significant only for men. Among East Asian men, lower agreeableness\nwas associated significantly only with a lack of relationship exclusivity. Among East Asian\nwomen, lower agreeableness was associated significantly with more unrestricted sociosexuality,\nmaking short-term mate poach attempts, having succumbed to short-term mate poach attempts,\nand especially with lower relationship exclusivity.\nConscientiousness and Short-Term Mating across Nations\nAs expected from previous research (Buss and Shackelford, 1997; Costa et al., 1992;\nHoyle et al., 2000; Wright, 1999), conscientiousness correlated with several measures of short-\nterm mating. Moreover, these correlations were pervasive across sex, and across many major\nregions of the world (see Table 3).\nNorth and South America. Among North American men, lower conscientiousness was\nassociated significantly with interest in short-term mating, unrestricted sociosexuality, short-term\nmate poaching attempts, succumbing to short-term mate poaching attempts, and lower\nrelationship exclusivity (i.e., greater infidelity). Among North American women, lower\nconscientiousness was associated significantly with interest in short-term mating, unrestricted\nsociosexuality, short-term mate poaching attempts, succumbing to short-term mate poaching\nattempts, and lower relationship exclusivity. Among both men and women, it appeared the link\nwas largest between conscientiousness and relationship exclusivity. Using Fisher's r to z'\ntransformation, the correlation between conscientiousness and lacking relationship exclusivity\nconscientiousness and interests in short-term mating, z = 4.01, p < .001, sociosexuality, z = 4.66,\np < .001, short-term mate poaching attempts, z = 5.31, p < .001, or succumbing to short-term\nmate poaching, z = 4.33, p < .001. In South America, most of the correlations between\nconscientiousness and short-term mating were negative, although only the correlation with\nrelationship exclusivity was significant for men.\nEurope. In Western Europe, most correlations between conscientiousness and short-term\nmating were negative. All but one reached statistical significance. Among Western European\nmen, lower conscientiousness was associated with every measure of short-term mating. Among\nWestern European women, lower conscientiousness was associated with more short-term mating\ninterests, higher sociosexuality, more frequent short-term mate poaching attempts, having\nsuccumbed to short-term mate poaching attempts, and with low relationship exclusivity. Again,\nthe numerically greatest links were between conscientiousness and relationship exclusivity for\nboth sexes. Among Eastern European men, low conscientiousness was associated only with low\nrelationship exclusivity. However, all associations between conscientiousness and short-term\nmating were negative and significant for women. In Southern Europe, all associations between\nconscientiousness and short-term mating were negative and all were significant among women;\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\nespecially strong was the negative correlation with relationship exclusivity. Among men from\nEastern Europe, the only significant correlation was with short-term mating interests.\nMiddle East and Africa. In the Middle East, all associations between conscientiousness\nand short-term mating were negative and significant for men, with the exception of\nsociosexuality. For Middle Eastern women, the only significant correlation was between lower\nconscientiousness and short-term mate poaching attempts. Among African men, all associations\nbetween conscientiousness and short-term mating were negative and significant. Among African\nwomen, all associations between conscientiousness and short-term mating were negative and\nsignificant, with the exception of relationship exclusivity. Overall, higher levels of\nconscientiousness were linked with lower levels of short-term mating.\nOceania, South/Southeast Asia, and East Asia. Among Oceanic men, lower\nconscientiousness was associated with lower relationship exclusivity. Among women, lower\nconscientiousness was associated with more interest in short-term mating, more unrestricted\nsociosexuality, and with lower relationship exclusivity in Oceania. In South/Southeast Asia,\nlower conscientiousness was associated with lower relationship exclusivity, but this was\nsignificant only for men. Among South/Southeast Asian men, higher conscientiousness was\nassociated with higher sociosexuality. This is the only instance across the ISDP in which short-\nterm mating was significantly linked with higher conscientiousness. Among East Asian men,\nlower conscientiousness was associated only with lower relationship exclusivity. Among East\nAsian women, lower conscientiousness was associated with more short-term mating interest and\nwith lower relationship exclusivity.\nNeuroticism and Short-Term Mating across Nations\nAs expected from previous research (Buss and Shackelford, 1997; Costa et al., 1992;\nHoyle et al., 2000; Wright, 1999), neuroticism correlated with several measures of short-term\nmating (see Table 3). However, these correlations were much less pervasive across sex and\nworld regions compared to previous findings.\nNorth and South America. Among North American men, neuroticism was not associated\nwith short-term mating orientation. Among North American women, in contrast, higher\nneuroticism was significantly associated with interest in short-term mating, unrestricted\nsociosexuality, short-term mate poaching attempts, succumbing to short-term mate poaching\nattempts, and lower relationship exclusivity. This is the first set of findings in which men and\nwomen displayed conspicuously different correlational profiles. For men, neuroticism was not an\nindicator of short-term mating, but for women it was an indicator of all aspects of short-term\nmating--from short-term mating interests to lacking relationship exclusivity. Most of these sex\ndifferences in neuroticism-sexuality links either were statistically significant or at least\napproached significance. For example, using Fisher's r to z' transformation, the correlation\nbetween neuroticism and short-term mating interests in women, r(1962) = +.05, p < .05, was\nmarginally stronger than the link between neuroticism and short-term mating interests in men, z\n= 1.31, p < .10, and the correlation between neuroticism and lacking relationship exclusivity in\nwomen, r(2183) = +.06, p < .01, was significantly stronger than the link between neuroticism\nand lacking relationship exclusivity in men, z = 1.96, p < .05. In South America, the correlations\nbetween neuroticism and short-term mating did not reach statistical significance.\nEurope. In Western Europe, the correlations between neuroticism and short-term mating\ndid not reach statistical significance, with the exception that among women neuroticism\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\npositively correlated with succumbing to short-term mate poaching attempts by others. Among\nEastern European men and women, neuroticism was negatively associated with interests in short-\nterm mating and sociosexuality. In Southern Europe, none of the associations between\nneuroticism and short-term mating reached the level of statistical significance.\nMiddle East and Africa. In the Middle East, men with higher neuroticism reported higher\nlevels of short-term mating interests. Middle Eastern women who reported higher neuroticism\nwere likely to also report having made short-term mate poaching attempts and having succumbed\nto the poaching attempts of others. Among African men, higher neuroticism was associated with\nshort-term mate poaching attempts and lower relationship exclusivity. None of the associations\nbetween neuroticism and short-term mating reached the level of statistical significance among\nAfrican women.\nOceania, South/Southeast Asia, and East Asia. The only significant relationship between\nneuroticism and short-term mating in Oceania was the link between high neuroticism and high\nrates of short-term mate poaching attempts among women. In South/Southeast Asia, the only\nsignificant relationship between neuroticism and short-term mating was the link between high\nneuroticism and low sociosexuality among men. In East Asia, there were not significant\nassociations between neuroticism and short-term mating.\nOpenness and Short-Term Mating across Nations\nAccording to previous research (e.g., Costa et al., 1992; Hoyle et al., 2000; Wright,\n1999), openness should be relatively unrelated to measures of short-term mating. We found\nseveral significant associations between openness and short-term mating, but these associations\nwere inconsistent across sex and world regions (see Table 3).\nNorth and South America. Among North America men, openness was negatively\ncorrelated with all measures of short-term mating. The two measures associated with infidelity\nwere related significantly to low openness, including succumbing to short-term mate poaches\nand lacking relationship exclusivity. North American women, in contrast, displayed the opposite\npattern. Those who scored higher on openness expressed more interest in short-term mating and\nwere sociosexually unrestricted. This was the second instance where men and women displayed\ndifferent correlational profiles. For men, openness was an indicator of lower levels of extra-pair\nshort-term mating, r(1222) = -.10, p < .001, whereas for women openness was an indicator of\nsociosexuality, r(2239) = +.11, p < .001. In South America, the correlations between openness\nand short-term mating did not reach statistical significance for women. However, among South\nAmerican men openness was associated with higher sociosexuality, more short-term mate\npoaching attempts, succumbing to short-term mate poaching attempts, and lower relationship\nexclusivity.\nEurope. In Western Europe, the correlations between openness and short-term mating did\nnot reach statistical significance among men, with the exception that openness correlated\npositively with sociosexuality. Among Western European women, openness correlated positively\nwith short-term mating interests and sociosexuality. In Eastern Europe, openness correlated\nsignificantly and positively with most measures of short-term mating for both men and women.\nThe exceptions were that openness did not correlate with succumbing to short-term mate\npoaching attempts or with lower relationship exclusivity. In Southern Europe, openness\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\ncorrelated significantly and positively with most measures of short-term mating among women,\nbut only sociosexuality correlated significantly with openness among men.\nMiddle East and Africa. Among women in the Middle East, openness correlated\npositively and significantly with sociosexuality. There were no significant correlations for\nMiddle Eastern men. In Africa, most correlations were in the positive direction, but few were\nsignificant. African men with higher openness reported higher levels of sociosexuality, but no\nsuch correlation was identified for African women.\nOceania, South/Southeast Asia, and East Asia. The only significant relationship between\nopenness and short-term mating in Oceania was the link between openness and lower\nrelationship exclusivity among women. Oceanic women who lacked relationship exclusivity\nscored lower on openness. In South/Southeast Asia, both men and women who lacked\nrelationship exclusivity scored lower on openness. However, among men from South/Southeast\nAsia higher openness was associated with higher sociosexuality. In East Asia, the only\nsignificant relationship between openness and short-term mating was the link between higher\nopenness and higher rates of short-term mate poaching attempts among men. Given the disputed\nnature of openness as a fundamental factor of personality (John and Srivastava, 1999; McCrae\nand Costa, 1997), these inconsistent results are not surprising.\nPersonality and Short-Term Mating in the Worldwide ISDP Sample\nLooking across the total 46-nation sample of the ISDP (see bottom of Table 3),\nextraversion was positively correlated with every measure of short-term mating among both men\nand women (after controlling for the effects of individual nation). Controlling for the effect of\nnation was necessary for if an individual nation was particularly high on both extraversion and\nshort-term mating this could artificially inflate the correlation between these two variables. Low\nagreeableness and low conscientiousness were indicative of short-term mating across both sexes\nand all measures of short-term mating in the worldwide sample. Neuroticism was negatively\nrelated to sociosexuality among men, but was positively associated with short-term mate\npoaching attempts, succumbing to poaching attempts, and a lack of relationship exclusivity in\nwomen. Openness was positively linked to most measures of short-term mating in men and\nwomen across the worldwide sample.\nPersonality Traits as Risk-Factors for Short-Term Mating Tendencies\nIn addition to considering each trait individually, we examined how the Big Five\ndimensions of personality served, in isolation and in combination, as predictors of short-term\nmating. Across the entire ISDP, we performed a standard multiple regression on each measure of\nshort-term mating, entering the Big Five traits, sex of participant, and nation of participant\nsimultaneously as predictor variables. In each case, the Big Five dimensions contributed unique\npredictive power after controlling for all other variables. For example, considering the\nsemipartial correlations between personality traits and short-term mating interests, extraversion\nwith short-term mating interests. Overall, 15% of the variance in short-term mating interests was\naccounted for by all predictor variables (R = .39, p < .001, Adjusted R2 = .15), about 3% of\nwhich came from the unique contributions of the Big Five, 1.5% came from shared variance\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\namong the Big Five, 0.5% was attributable to the nation of the participant, and 10% was\nattributable to the sex of participant. The amount of variance in short-term mating explained by\nsex of participant was twice the amount explained by personality traits and nation combined (see\nIn another attempt to examine the individual and combined effects of personality on\nsexuality, we categorized each participant in the ISDP as either high or low on each of the Big\nFive using a median split. We treated high extraversion, low agreeableness, low\nconscientiousness, high neuroticism (for women), low neuroticism (for men), and high openness\nas \"predictive\" of short-term mating. Low extraversion, high agreeableness, high\nconscientiousness, low neuroticism (for women), high neuroticism (for men), and low openness\nwere treated as \"not predictive\" of short-term mating. As seen in Figure 1, conscientiousness\nshowed the largest difference between predictive and not predictive personality traits, t(10292) =\nFigure 1. Personality traits as predictive of short-term mating interests in the International\nSexuality Description Project.\nExtraversion\nAgreeableness\nConscientiousness\nNeuroticism\nOpenness\nTrait\nShort-Term Mating Interests\nPredictive\nNot Predictive\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\nEach person was also given an overall \"personality risk\" score, ranging from 0 to 5,\ndepending on how many of their Big Five traits were in the predictive direction of short-term\nmating. For example, if a woman scored high on extraversion, low on agreeableness, low on\nconscientiousness, high on neuroticism, and high on openness, she received a personality risk\nscore of 5 because each of her Big Five traits were predictive of short-term mating. If a woman\nscored low on extraversion, high on agreeableness, high on conscientiousness, low on\nneuroticism, and low on openness, she received a personality risk score of 0. Overall, 52 men\n(1% of men) and 231 women (4% of women) had a score of 0 personality risk for short-term\nFor each sexuality measure, personality risk was significantly related to short-term\nmating, with incremental increases in personality risk associated with higher levels of short-term\nmating. For example, the overall main effect of personality risk on short-term mating interests\ndifferences between levels of personality risk (i.e., the difference between 0 and 1, 1 and 2, 2 and\n3, and 3 and 4) were significant. However, the difference between levels 4 and 5 was not\nsignificantly different.\nIn Figure 2, we depict the short-term mating interests of men and women separately\nacross the different personality risk categories. The main effect of sex on short-term mating\nterm mating interests were different for men and women. According to Tukey's HSD within each\nsex, among men the incremental increases in personality risk were significant only between 1\nand 2, and 2 and 3. Once three personality traits were predictive of short-term mating, further\npersonality indicators of short-term mating did not add predictive power for men. Among\nwomen, the incremental increases in personality risk were significant only between 1 and 2, and\n3 and 4. After two personality traits were predictive of short-term mating, it took two additional\npersonality indicators of short-term mating to add significant predictive power.\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\nFigure 2. Personality risk level related to short-term mating interests in the International\nSexuality Description Project.\nPersonality Risk Level\nShort-Term Mating Interests\nMen\nWomen\nNation-Level Relationships between Personality Traits and Short-Term Mating\nIn addition to relating personality traits to short-term mating within regions, we\ncorrelated national profiles of personality and short-term mating (see Table 4). Although nation-\nlevel scores do not always correlate in the same way as individual-level scores (assuming so is\noften called the ecological fallacy), we expected nation-level correlations to mirror some of those\nfound within regions, especially the robust findings for extraversion, agreeableness, and\nconscientiousness.\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\nTable 4.

This association was sometimes larger among women's scores than\namong men's, such as the marginal difference in short-term mating interest correlations (based\non Fisher's r to z'; z = 1.36, p < .10). A scatterplot of women's national extraversion scores\nrelated to women's nation-level sociosexuality, r(44) = +0.51, p < .001, is presented in Figure 3.\nMany of the most extraverted women, as well as women with the highest sociosexual levels, tend\nto be found in Europe (e.g., Serbia, Croatia, Switzerland, and Austria). The most introverted\nwomen, who were also low on sociosexuality, tended to reside in Asia and Africa (e.g., South\nKorea, Japan, Hong Kong, and Ethiopia). Very few nations had introverted women who scored\nhigh on sociosexuality, although French and Belgian women came close to this profile in that\nthey were relatively introverted and were moderate on sociosexuality.\nFigure 3. National levels of women's extraversion related to national levels of women's\nsociosexuality across 46 nations of the International Sexuality Description Project, r(44) = +.51,\nNational Extrave\nrsion Levels Among Women\nNational Sociosexuality Levels Among Women\nArgentina\nAustralia\nAustria\nBolivia\nBotswana\nazil Canada\nCongo\nCroatia\nCzech Rep.\nEstonia\nFiji\nFinland\nGermany\neece\nIsrael\nItaly\nLatvia\nLebanon\nLithuania\nMalta\nMexico\nMorocco\nNetherlands\nNew Zealand\nPeru\nPhilippines\nPoland\nRomania\nSerbia\nSlovakia\nSlovenia\nSpain\nSwitzerland\nTaiwan\nTurkey\nUnited Kingdom\nUSA\nZimbabwe\nBelgium Br\nEthiopia\nFrance\nGr\nHong Kong\nJapan\nPortugal\nSouth Korea\nNational levels of agreeableness were associated with lower short-term mating tendencies\nat the national level. For example, in nations where men were disagreeable, national levels of\nshort-term mating interest were higher (see Figure 4). The most agreeable men tended to reside\nin Africa (e.g., Congo, Ethiopia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe), and these same nations contained\nmen who were very low in short-term mating interests. In contrast, the most disagreeable men\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\ntended to reside in Europe and South America (e.g., Latvia, Lithuania, Argentina, and Peru), and\nthese nations had men who were relatively high in short-term mating interests. This same trend\nwas observed in terms of men succumbing to short-term mate poaching. Among nations with\ndisagreeable women, men tended to go along with short-term mate poaching as well.\nFigure 4. National levels of men's agreeableness related to national levels of men's short-term\nmating interests across 46 nations of the International Sexuality Description Project, r(44) = -.38,\nNational Agreeableness Levels Among Men\nNational Short-Term Mating Interests Among Men\nArgentina Australia\nAustria\nBelgium\nBolivia\nBotswana\nBrazil\nCanada\nCongo\nCroatia\nCzech Rep.\nEstonia\nEthiopia\nFiji\nFinland\nFrance\nGermany\nGreece\nHong Kong\nIsrael\nItaly\nJapan\nLatvia Lebanon\nLithuania\nMalta\nMexico\nMorocco\nNetherlands\nNew Zealand\nPeru\nPhilippines\nPoland\nPortugal\nRomania\nSerbia\nSlovakia\nSlovenia\nSouth Korea\nSpain\nSwitzerland\nTaiwan\nTurkey\nUnited Kingdom\nUSA\nZimbabwe\nNational levels of conscientiousness were sometimes associated with lower short-term\nmating tendencies. For example, higher levels of national conscientiousness were associated with\nlower levels of short-term mating interests in men, just as with the individual-level analyses.\nLooking at the cross-sex linkages, women's conscientiousness was linked to increased levels of\nsociosexuality and to more short-term mate poaching among men. However, women's\nconscientiousness was negatively correlated with men's lack of relationship exclusivity.\nNational levels of neuroticism were almost always negatively linked with national short-\nterm mating tendencies. For example, in nations with neurotic men, national levels of\nsociosexuality were lower. The most neurotic men tended to reside in Asian nations (e.g., Japan,\nSouth Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong), the same nations where men have relatively low levels\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\nof sociosexuality (see Figure 5). The nations with the least neurotic men (e.g., Morocco, Finland,\nSlovenia, and Croatia) tended to have men who scored high on sociosexuality. In the individual-\nlevel analyses, the findings were rather equivocal--sometimes neuroticism was linked with less\nshort-term mating, sometimes with more short-term mating (e.g., men in the Middle East and\nAfrica). However, the national-level findings were clear, with higher levels of neuroticism linked\nwith less short-term mating in men. Looking at the cross-sex linkages, neuroticism among\nwomen was sometimes linked with increased short-term mating in men (e.g., lack of relationship\nexclusivity).\nFinally, national levels of openness were positively associated short-term mating, with\nthe exception of indicators of extra-pair mating. In nations where men were high on openness,\nthere was a trend for men to have higher short-term mating interests and to have higher\nsociosexuality. In nations where women were high on openness, there was a trend for women to\nhave higher short-term mating interests and to have higher sociosexuality. Women's high\nopenness was also associated with increased short-term mating among men, including higher\nnational levels of men's short-term mating interests, sociosexuality, and short-term mate\npoaching attempts.\nOverall, the relationships among national profiles of personality traits and national\nprofiles of short-term mating tended to mirror those identified at the individual level. Extraverted\nnations were, on average, more short-term oriented than introverted nations. Disagreeable\nnations were more short-term oriented than agreeable nations. Men were more short-term\noriented in nations low on conscientiousness, and women's conscientiousness was linked to\ngreater short-term mating among men. Neurotic nations tended to have lower short-term mating\ntendencies, although across the sexes women's neuroticism was linked with higher short-term\nmating in men. Higher levels of openness were generally associated with more short-term mating\nin both sexes.\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\nFigure 5. National levels of men's neuroticism related to national levels of men's sociosexuality\nacross 46 nations of the International Sexuality Description Project, r(44) = -.44, p < .001.\nNational Neuroticism Levels Among Men\nNational Sociosexuality Levels Among Men\nArgentina\nAustralia\nAustria\nBelgium\nBolivia\nBotswana\nBrazil\nCanada\nCongo\nCroatia\nCzech Rep.\nEstonia\nEthiopia\nFiji\nFinland\nFrance\nGermany\nGreece\nHong Kong\nIsrael\nItaly\nJapan\nLatvia\nLebanon\nLithuania\nMalta\nMexico\nMorocco\nNetherlands\nNew Zealand\nPeru\nPhilippines\nPoland\nPortugal\nRomania Serbia\nSlovakia\nSlovenia\nSouth Korea\nSpain\nSwitzerland\nTaiwan\nTurkey\nUnited Kingdom\nUSA\nZimbabwe\nDiscussion\nAs part of the International Sexuality Description Project, 13,243 participants from 46\nnations responded to self-report measures of personality and sexuality. As expected, several traits\nshowed consistent links with short-term mating. Extraversion was universally associated with\ninterest in short-term mating, unrestricted sociosexuality, having engaged in short-term mate\npoaching attempts, having succumbed to short-term poaching attempts, and lacking relationship\nexclusivity. Low agreeableness and conscientiousness also were related to short-term mating,\nespecially with measures of extra-pair mating (i.e., succumbing to short-term poaching attempts\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\nand lacking relationship exclusivity). Neuroticism and openness were related to short-term\nmating, although these links were less consistent across sex and world region.\nSome Traits Correlate with Short-Term Mating More than Others\nAs expected, three traits from among the Big Five stood out as consistently related to\nshort-term mating. Within regions and across nations, higher extraversion, lower agreeableness,\nand lower conscientiousness are linked with higher levels of short-term mating. Neuroticism was\nan equivocal correlate, being associated with more short-term mating in some nations and less\nshort-term mating in others. Openness also was inconsistently related to short-term mating, with\nthe association depending on both sex and world region.\nFuture research might profitably investigate why some traits appear to relate more\nconsistently to short-term mating than others. One factor might be the relationship between\npersonality and sexual libido or lust (Regan and Berscheid, 1999). Extraversion, for example, has\nbeen linked to higher libido (Eysenck, 1976), which might help explain why extraverts engage in\nmore mating overall. To explain mating specific to the short-term context, however, the traits of\nlow agreeableness and low conscientiousness may be necessary additions. Low agreeableness\nand low conscientiousness have been linked with social dominance and antisocial tendencies\n(Paulhus and Williams, 2002; Wiebe, 2004)--tendencies that may serve as key factors in turning\nshort-term mating desires into short-term mating behavior (Aromaeki, Lindman, and Eriksson,\npractices (McMahon, Malow, and Penedo, 1998).\nSex Differences in the Correlates of Short-Term Mating\nSome of the personality correlates of short-term mating varied in systematic ways across\nsex. Extraversion was associated with short-term mating among men and women. Similarly, low\nagreeableness and conscientiousness were associated with short-term mating regardless of sex.\nHowever, the correlational profile of neuroticism displayed apparent sex differences. In North\nAmerica, neuroticism was associated with increased short-term mating only among women. This\nwas also true among women from Western Europe, Middle East, and Oceania. In contrast,\nneuroticism among women and men from Eastern Europe was associated with decreased short-\nterm mating, and men from the Middle East and Africa who were more neurotic were more\noriented toward short-term mating. Overall, neuroticism was usually associated with decreased\nshort-term mating in men (e.g., lower sociosexuality) and increased short-term mating in women\n(e.g., especially increased levels of infidelity).\nAmong North America men, openness was negatively correlated with all measures of\nshort-term mating, especially indicators of extra-pair mating. North American women displayed\na different pattern. Those women who scored high on openness were more likely to express\ninterest in short-term and to be sociosexually unrestricted. This was the second instance, after the\nneuroticism correlates, where men and women displayed apparently different personality-\nsexuality correlations (see also Clark, 2006). However, across most regions of the world both\nmen and women who were high in openness were likely to have higher levels of short-term\nmating interests and behaviors.\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\nNational Differences in Personality and Short-Term Mating\nIn some nations people are more extraverted than in others (McCrae, 2001), and in some\nnations people are more oriented toward short-term mating than in others (Schmitt, 2005a;\nSchmitt et al., 2003). In the ISDP, national variability in short-term mating tends to track\nnational variability in extraversion. In nations with more introverted people, such as South\nKorea, Hong Kong, Japan, and Ethiopia, short-term mating tends to be lower. This is true within\nmen and within women, and within nations and across nations. Agreeableness and\nconscientiousness show similar patterns. In nations that score lower on agreeableness, such as\nLatvia, Lithuania, Argentina, and Peru, short-term mating interests are higher. In nations with\nhigher agreeableness, such as most African nations, short-term mating is lower. In nations with\nhigher neuroticism, such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, short-term mating is\nlower than in nations with lower levels of neuroticism, such as Finland, Slovenia, Croatia, and\nNew Zealand.\nLimitations and Alternative Explanations\nThe present research has several limitations. First, the personality and sexuality\nquestionnaires in the ISDP, like all individual difference questionnaires, have a certain degree of\nmeasurement error (Andersen and Broffitt, 1988; Catania, McDermott, and Pollack, 1986). In the\ncontext of the many translations involved in the ISDP, it is likely that measurement error played\na role in limiting our findings. However, as many of the findings were replicated across sexes\nand nations, it is plausible that lesser measurement error would produce larger correlations than\nthose reported in this article. Still, using additional techniques such as the bogus pipeline\nprocedure (Alexander and Fisher, 2000) and accounting for social desirability biases (Eysenck\nand Eysenck, 1971; Paulhus and Reid, 1991), may improve the veridicality of self-report\nresponses to ISDP surveys in the future.\nSecond, many of the current samples were relatively small (see Table 1), and the\nsampling techniques used were convenience-based, rather than representative. As a result, the\npresent findings should be interpreted with care. Because the ISDP primarily sampled college\nstudents, any generalizations beyond this population may be inappropriate. Future research\ntaking sampling factors into account, and utilizing true representative sampling of nations and\ntheir many co-cultures, will be needed to verify the current personality-sexuality links.\nThird, there may be a host of extraneous variables that account for the personality-\nsexuality associations identified in the ISDP. Observed regional differences in the ISDP may be\ndue to cultural disparities in the links between personality and short-term mating, but they may\nalso result from inappropriate translations or the non-identical response styles across nations\nand Leung, 2000). Cultural values and beliefs outside the realm of the Big Five might also\nfunction as third variable causes of the links between personality and short-term mating (e.g.,\nFinally, in this research we have assumed that personality traits lead to short-term mating.\nAn equally plausible alternative is that the causal links between personality and sexuality flow in\nthe opposite direction. That is, short-term mating interests and behaviors may lead to the\ndevelopment of particular personality traits. Engaging in mate poaching, for example, could lead\nBig Five and Sexuality across Nations\npeople to become disagreeable just as much as disagreeableness could lead to mate poaching.\nPersonality and sexuality also could reinforce one another, serving as a feedback loop that once\ninitiated becomes difficult to disengage. Such could be the origin of adult romantic attachment\nstyles, love styles, and other psychological constructs that involve the confluence of personality\ntraits and romantic relationships (Schmitt, 2005b).\nImplications and Future Research Directions\nThis research makes several contributions to our understanding of the links between\npersonality and sexuality. First, the findings previously reported using only American and\nEuropean samples have now been replicated and extended across many different nations,\nincluding non-Western nations. The traits of extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness\nhave been implicated in short-term mating across 10 major regions of the world. Second, our\nfindings show that sex plays a role in moderating some personality-sexuality linkages (e.g.,\nneuroticism), and that sex is a larger predictor of short-term mating than either personality traits\nor national origin (see also Schmitt, 2005a). Third, for the first time nations have been shown to\nvary along personality dimensions in ways that directly relate to short-term mating attitudes and\nbehaviors at the national level. This provides new evidence that personality and sexuality are\npsychologically and sociologically intertwined.\nAn implication of the current findings is that if health care workers wish to attempt to\ncontrol short-term mating (as a key risk factor for the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases, for\nexample), it may be most effective to concentrate on the developmental and physiological factors\nassociated with extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness (Graziano and Eisenberg,\nrather than other traits. In each case, however, the moderating effects of local culture should be\nincorporated (Church, 2000). Future research might explore whether certain personality clusters\nor \"types\" that reflect combinations of high extraversion, low agreeableness, and low\nconscientiousness predispose individuals toward short-term mating in the same way across all\ncultures (Asendorpf and van Aken, 1999).\nFuture researchers also might examine whether certain sub-traits or facets of\nextraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness are more important in predicting short-term\nmating than others. The Big Five Inventory (Benet-Martinez and John, 1998) used in the ISDP is\nnot able to distinguish among the different facets of the Big Five. Neither is it designed to\ndiagnose extreme and maladaptive levels of these traits. The relationship between extraversion\nand short-term mating may be driven in some nations by those with high levels of positive\nemotion, for example, whereas in other nations the link may be based on high activity level. The\nrelationship between agreeableness and short-term mating may be driven in women by extremely\nlow trust, whereas among men it is low empathy that leads to short-term mating. The current\nstudy, with its use of higher-order personality traits and broad-based sexuality measures, may\nhave just scratched the surface of important personality-sexuality relationships and their cultural\nvariations.\n"
