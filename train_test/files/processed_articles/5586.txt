Some\nresearchers have reported that race, female\nsex, age, cigarette smoking, hypertension,\nheavy alcohol intake, and family history are\npredisposing risk factors for aSAH.10\u00ad14\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) is the most\ncommon endocrine disorder and a major\ncause of disability worldwide.15 It is calcu-\nlated that the number of DM patients will\nthe next twenty years16 due to burgeoning\npopulation, changed lifestyles, and popula-\ntion ageing.17 DM influences the arterial\nis a well-known trigger for cerebral\nA recent study suggested that DM was\nassociated with a decreased risk of saccular\nintracranial aneurysm rupture, which may\ncause aSAH.23 However, multiple epidemio-\nlogic studies have produced inconsistent and\ninconclusive results regarding the relation-\nwe conducted a systematic review and meta-\nanalysis to evaluate the current evidence\nfrom published observational studies relat-\ning to the association between DM and the\nrisk of aSAH.\nMaterials and methods\nWe conducted this systematic review and\nmeta-analysis in adherence to the guidelines\nof the Meta-analyses of Observational\nStudies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) group.41\nData sources and searches\nTwo investigators (X.Y. and C.J.) independ-\nently performed a systematic search of\nin Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and\nCochrane Library databases. The following\nsearch terms were used: (diabetes OR dia-\nbetes mellitus) AND (intracranial aneurysm\nOR intracerebral aneurysm OR cerebral\naneurysm OR subarachnoid haemorrhage)\nAND risk. No restrictions on language or\ntypes of publications were imposed. The\nreference lists of retrieved publications were\nalso searched for additional relevant studies.\nStudy selection\nStudies were included in our meta-analysis if\nthey met the following criteria: 1) The study\ndesign was a cohort or case-control study; 2)\nthe study described the impact of DM on the\nrisk of aSAH; 3) the study presented odds\nratios (ORs), hazard ratios (HRs), or rela-\ntive risks (RRs) with corresponding 95%\nconfidence intervals (CIs) (or sufficient data\nto calculate them). In instances where mul-\ntiple reports were based on the same study\npopulation, we included the most inform-\native and comprehensive studies in our\nsystematic review.\nData extraction and methodological\nquality assessment\nStudy selection and data extraction were\nconducted respectively by two investigators\n(X.Y. and C.J.). We extracted the following\ninformation using a standardized collection\nform: the first author's last name, year of\npublication, study period, study design,\nnumber of aSAH patients and participants,\nsource of controls, outcome data, and\nadjustment for major confounding factors.\nThe study quality of each included case-\ncontrol or cohort study was assessed using\nthe Critical Appraisal Skills Program\n(CASP).42 These questions appraised\nthe study validity, risk of bias in recruit-\nment, exposure and outcome measurement,\nconfounders, the reported results, generaliz-\nability, and transferability. Each single\nincluded study was independently assessed\nby two reviewers (X.Y. and C.J.). Any\ndisagreements were judged by a third inves-\ntigator (G.J.) and settled by consensus.\nStatistical analysis\nIf the prevalence of aSAH was rare, ORs\nand HRs were considered equal to RRs.43\nSo, a RR with 95% CI was used to measure\nthe relationship between DM and aSAH. If\noutcomes for males and females were pro-\nvided, then risk estimates for males and\nfemales were regarded as two separate\nresults.44 The Cochran's Q test was used to\nassess the statistical heterogeneity (signifi-\ncant if P < 0.10).We employed I2 statistics to\nevaluate the degree of heterogeneity among\nincluded studies.45 We applied the random-\neffects model, which combined both within-\nand between-study heterogeneity to\nsummarize the risk estimates.46 Subgroup\nanalyses were made for study design and\nstudy quality assessed by CASP. Sensitivity\nwas analysed by omitting one study at a time\nto assess the stability of the pooled conse-\nquences. We examined the potential evi-\ndence of publication bias by Begg funnel\nof < 0.05 was regarded as statistically sig-\nnificant. All statistical tests were performed\nusing STATA 12.0 software (Stata\nCorporation, College Station, TX, USA).\nResults\nLiterature search\nThe electronic search yielded 1,295 potential\narticles. Duplicates and studies that did not\nmeet the inclusion criteria were excluded.\nAfter this, 18 studies were chosen for\ndetailed appraisal. Among them, one\nstudy49 only contained an abstract; three\ndies nor cohort studies; four studies52\u00ad55 did\nnot report the association of DM with the\nrisk of aSAH; one study56 came from the\nsame study population. The remaining nine\nwere included in our meta-analysis. The flow\nchart of our searching process is shown in\nDescription of included studies\nCharacteristics of the included studies\nare presented in Table 1.

Various covariates were adjusted\nin most studies, although these differed\nbetween studies.\nOnly one study distinguished between\ntype 1 and type 2 DM; this study described\nthe association between type 2 DM and the\nrisk of aSAH.40 Most studies did not define\nDM and confirmed DM through the\npatient's medical history. Nevertheless,\nto the World Health Organization's criteria,\nand one27 used the definition established by\nthe standard guidelines of the American\nDiabetes Association. In most studies,\naSAH was diagnosed using computed tom-\nography and/or cerebral angiography. Some\nstudies used surgery or necropsy and cere-\nbrospinal fluid analysis to confirm the diag-\nfrom the medical history.

In our systematic review, all\nincluded studies except for two24,35 reported\na decreased association between DM\nand aSAH risk. This meta-analysis\nusing RRs from 15 case-control studies\nand three cohort studies included more\nfindings indicate that DM reduces the risk\nof aSAH.\nFigure 3. Sensitivity analyses for the risk of diabetes mellitus and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.\nStrengths and limitations of this\nsystematic review\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nsystematic review and meta-analysis to focus\non the association between DM and risk of\naSAH. All available published studies with a\nsufficient number of participants for a quali-\ntative and quantitative summary of the\noutcomes were included in this meta-analy-\nsis. Therefore, this study has more power\nthan any individual study to investigate the\nrelationship between DM and risk of aSAH.\nSubstantive heterogeneity between stu-\ndies was monitored using the I2 statistic. The\nfindings of observational studies should\nalways be interpreted with caution.\nSubgroup analysis by study design showed\nthat the majority of included studies were\ncase-control studies, therefore our conclu-\nsions are chiefly based on case-control\nstudies. Diabetic patients probably have a\nhigher risk of dying from other diseases than\nnon-diabetic individuals. Consequently, the\nlikelihood of a SAH forming is reduced\nin DM patients compared with controls.57\nAt the same time, recall and selective bias\nmay be increased.\nThe most important limitation high-\nlighted by the current systematic review\nwas the paucity of high quality studies.\nOnly half of the included studies were of\nhigh quality. Insufficient study quality may\nbe a source of heterogeneity according to the\nsubgroup analysis of study quality. The\nCASP clearly demonstrated that recruited\ncontrols were unrepresentative, identified a\nlarge number of unadjusted potential con-\nfounders, and showed that unprecise results\nare the main cause of poor study quality.\nBecause the study quality was limited and\nthe heterogeneity was moderate, it was not\npossible to show a stronger association for\npopulation characteristics, such as geo-\ngraphical areas and sex.\nStudy quality may have been a contribut-\ning factor to heterogeneity, but there were\nother potential sources. For example, only a\nThe lack of a consistent standard definition\nFigure 4. Begg funnel plot for the risk of diabetes mellitus and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.\nfor DM may have affected the number of\ndiabetic patients recruited in each study.\ndescribe the methods of aSAH diagnosis,\nwhich may also have contributed to\nheterogeneity.\nProspective population-based cohort stu-\ndies have shown that BMI and cholesterol\nlevels may be related to DM and may\nabout important risk factors such as\nonly collected in a few studies. Other\nimportant risk factors such as cigarette\nsmoking, hypotension, and alcohol con-\nsumption were generally inconsistent\namong the included studies. These factors\nhave been associated with an increased risk\nof aSAH,10\u00ad14 but very few studies adjusted\nfor them. This may explain the unprecise\nfindings regarding risk of aSAH among the\nincluded studies.\nBecause the collected information was\nlimited, we could not distinguish between\ntype 1 and type 2 DM. This might have\nprevented identification of a genuine associ-\nation between DM and risk of aSAH. For\nexample, in type 1 diabetic patients, the\nprevalence of nonaneurysmal SAH was high\nin a prospective cohort study.55 Because the\nquality of the included studies was generally\npoor, we did not calculate the RR and 95%\nCI to detect more sources of heterogeneity,\nsuch as the methods for measuring diabetes,\nantidiabetic drugs, and duration of diabetes\nin each study. Notably, antidiabetic drugs\nwere used by 9% of type 2 diabetic patients\nin a comparative study, but was not related\nto the risk of aSAH according to multivari-\nate analysis.\nWe did not perform an exhaustive search\nof the published literature in all electronic\ndatabases; therefore we may have missed\nseveral pertinent published or unpublished\nstudies. Finally, we found little proof of\npublication bias in our meta-analysis.\nHowever, potential publication bias might\nhave had an impact on our findings, as\nComparison with previous studies\nFeigin et al. performed a meta-analysis63 to\nevaluate various SAH risk factors published\nbefore 2005. Surprisingly, they found that\nDM was associated with a reduced risk of\nHowever, the sample size and study quality\nwere questionable in this study. The sample\nof pooled aSAH RR associated with DM\ncompared with the earlier meta-analysis,\nindicating that our results are more precise.\nOnly two of the included studies reported\nan increased association between DM and\nthe risk of aSAH, largely because of small\nsample sizes and univariate analysis. If an\nincreased association between DM and\naSAH is confirmed by future studies, then\nspecial determination assessment will be\naffected, including cerebral angiography of\npatients with DM and recent symptoms of\nthird nerve palsy.64\nHypothetical causes for the reduction\nof DM and aSAH risk\nAlthough there are no confirmed biological\ntheories to support our finding, several\nputative explanations exist. Patients with\nDM may modify their lifestyles (e.g., more\nexercise, better diet, less smoking and drink-\ning) and receive medication for hyperten-\nsion, which is an independent risk factor of\naSAH.64 Inagawa suggested that an inverse\nassociation exists between DM and aneur-\nysm rupture, which might be linked to the\natherosclerotic wall because atherosclerotic\naneurysms are less likely to rupture.29 This\nmight also explain why the decreased\nassociation is stronger in older diabetic\npatients than younger diabetic patients.29\nSimilar to saccharification of the extracellu-\nlar matrix and cross-linking between elastin\nand avitene in the aortic wall,65 diabetes-\nmediated alterations might exist in the\nhemal extracellular matrix.40 Furthermore,\nthe 9p21.3 locus has been related to DM and\nsaccular IAs,66,67 although it is not part of\nthe linkage disequilibrium block. A genetic\nconnection that enhances type 2 DM and\nreduces the risk of aSAH is likely to exist.23\nImplication for future research\nFuture studies will need to be well-designed\nand carefully powered to address the fol-\nlowing points: (1) consideration of more\npotential confounding factors, such as BMI,\ncholesterol level, smoking, hypertension,\nand drinking; (2) adjustment for or exclu-\nsion of chronic diseases (heart disease was\nassociated with a decreased risk of aSAH,\npossibly due to reduced strenuous physical\nactivity); (3) investigation of possible thera-\npeutic mechanisms; (4) classification of DM\nas type 1 and type 2 to determine a potential\ncausal relationship.\nConclusions and unanswered questions\nIn conclusion, most of the studies included\nin our systematic review are lacking in\nquality. Analysis of the high quality studies\nidentified a potential decreased risk of aSAH\nin subjects with DM. However, the causal\nrelationship between DM and aSAH\nremains to be elucidated. Further high\nquality epidemiological cohort and animal\nstudies are necessary to investigate whether\nDM and aSAH are correlated and to eluci-\ndate the underlying biological mechanisms.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by Suzhou Key\nNational Natural Science Foundation of China\nScientific Department of Jiangsu Province (No.\nand A Project Funded by the Priority Academic\nProgram Development of Jiangsu Higher\nEducation Institutions.\nReferences\n1. van Gijn J, Kerr RS and Rinkel GJ.\n2.
