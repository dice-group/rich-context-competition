    "abstract": "Abstract\nPrevious research has demonstrated that typefaces can convey meaning over-and-above the actual\nsemantic content of whatever happens to be written. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that\npeople match basic taste words (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter) to typefaces varying in their\nroundness versus angularity. In Experiment 1, the participants matched rounder typefaces with\nthe word ``sweet,'' while matching more angular typefaces with the taste words ``bitter,'' ``salty,''\nand ``sour.'' Experiment 2 demonstrates that rounder typefaces are liked more and are judged\neasier to read than their more angular counterparts. We conclude that there is a strong\nrelationship between roundness/angularity, ease of processing, and typeface liking, which in turn\ninfluences the correspondence between typeface and taste. These results are discussed in terms of\nthe notion of affective crossmodal correspondences.\n",

Indeed, it has been suggested that the\nvisual features of written words can be processed before their actual meaning and that this\ncan influence subsequent information processing (e.g., Childers & Jass, 2002, see also Celhay,\nBoyselle, & Cohen, 2015). In the context of consumer behavior, this may be of particular\nimportance given that consumers perceive fonts as being more appropriate for a\ngiven product when both the product and the font have the same connotative meaning\n(e.g., Doyle & Bottomley, 2009, as measured using the semantic differential technique; see\nOsgood, Suci, & Tannenbaum, 1957). In addition, the semantic appropriateness or\ncongruency of a product has also been shown to influence people's choice behavior\nto the importance of considering font-product semantic consistency in design. Here, we\npropose that congruency can also be applied to the relationship between typeface and\ntaste. Design practitioners have already suggested that typefaces may be used to convey\ninformation about taste or flavor (Hyndman, 2015).\nResearch on the topic of crossmodal correspondences suggests that the RA of typefaces\ncan be associated with specific taste words (in a forced choice setting). For example, Velasco,\nSalgado-Montejo, Marmolejo-Ramos, and Spence (2014) recently reported that fictional\npackages with a brand name that had a rounder typeface (e.g., Swis721 B1kRnd\nBT--Black, 44 pt) were more frequently categorized as sweet as compared with packages\nwith a more angular typeface (e.g., Hollywood Hills--Regular, 53 pt), which was more\nfrequently categorized as sour instead. Potentially, the RA dimension studied in research\non shape-taste correspondences can be extended to typefaces.\nIn the present study, we wanted to investigate whether the different design elements of\ntypefaces (RA, bold, italics, and orientation) would influence participants' associations to\nspecific basic taste words (bitter, salty, sour, and sweet). Based on the aforementioned\nliterature, the clear prediction has, at least, to be that rounder typefaces would be\nassociated with the word sweet. In Experiment 1, we assessed any relationship between\ntaste words (bitter, salty, sour, and sweet) and different typefaces. Experiment 2 was\nmotivated by previous research suggesting that taste or shape may be thought of as\naffective correspondences (Velasco et al., 2015a), and that there is a relationship between\nprocessing fluency and liking (Winkielman & Cacioppo, 2001). Here, we assessed whether the\ndifferent typefaces would be consistently rated along RA, as well as liking, and ease of\nprocessing scales.\nExperiment 1\nMethods and Materials\nOne hundred and one participants (42 females, mean age \u00bc 35.4 years, SD age \u00bc 11.15, range\nage \u00bc 20\u00ad69 years) from the United States took part in this study online through the Adobe\nFlash-based Xperiment software (http://www.xperiment.mobi, also used in Experiment 2). The\nparticipants were recruited using Amazon's Mechanical Turk in exchange for a payment of\n1.00 USD in both Experiments 1 and 2. All were based in the United States, and all agreed to\ntake part in the study after reading a standard consent form. The experiment was reviewed and\napproved by the Central University Research Ethics Committee at the University of Oxford.\nThe images of 12 variants of the same text ``eat me'' were written in different typefaces and\nwere created specifically for the experiments reported here (see Figure 1). Each image was\npresented in black and white either alone (71\u00c2 71 pixels) or on a receptacle (85\u00c2 116 pixels),\ngiving rise to a total of 24 stimuli. The different typefaces were designed to be distinctively round\nor angular (Velasco et al., 2014). The typefaces used in the present study are shown in Figure 1.\nThe first two are Arial (Typeface 1) and Arial bold (Typeface 2), while the remaining 10\ncorrespond to designs made by Sarah Hyndman (http://www.sarahhyndman.com/), a\nprofessional graphic designer, specifically for the purposes of the present experiment. Note\nthat the first six typefaces are rounder, while the remaining six are more angular.\nThrough two tasks, the task with typeface and the task with typeface and cup, the\nparticipants had to arrange the different images of the typeface variants of the text ``eat\nme'' alone or on a cup, respectively, in terms of the extent to which they thought they\nmatched bitter, salty, sour, and sweet tastes (see Figure 2, for an example of the task).\nThe tasks were randomized across participants.\nFigure 1. Typeface stimuli presented to the participants in Experiment 1. The typefaces (without the cups)\nwere also used in Experiment 2.\nFigure 2. Screen display in one of the experiment trials used in Experiment 1.\nVelasco et al. 3\nDue to a number of repeated measures analysis of variance assumptions being violated\n(e.g., the data were not normally distributed), the rank-based analysis of variance-type\nstatistic (ATS) was used to analyze the results (see Erceg-Hurn & Mirosevich, 2008), as\nimplemented in the {nparLD} package in R statistical software (see Noguchi, Gel,\nBrunner, & Konietschke, 2012). The significant main effects were further analyzed with the\nWilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction. Moreover, because our main interest\nlay in assessing whether the ratings of each stimulus differed as a function of the taste, we\nthen analyzed the significant interactions of taste and shape with Friedman's test. After this,\nmultiple comparisons were performed following Siegel and Castellan's (1988) Formula 7.5a\n(pp. 180\u00ad181), as implemented in {pgirmess} package in R statistical software. Friedman test\nwas also used in Experiment 2.\nResults and Discussion\nTask with typeface. A 4 (taste words) \u00c2 12 (typefaces) ATS was performed.

The analysis revealed significant main effects of taste word, FATS\nbetween taste word and typeface, FATS\nparticipants' sweet ratings were lower than the ratings of the other tastes (p < .01, for all\ncomparisons). Pairwise comparisons performed on the main effect of typeface also revealed\nthat the participants gave higher ratings to the angular (7\u00ad12) as compared with the round\n(1\u00ad6) typefaces (p < .001, for all comparisons). Moreover, Typeface 7, extremely angular\nlight, received higher ratings than Typeface 9, angular and contrasting--sloping forwards,\nand Typeface 12, angular and contrasting--sloping backwards (p < .01, for both\ncomparisons). As for the interaction term, a significant difference between the different\nof the task with just typeface (see Figure 3(b), for a summary of the results). In addition to the\nresults reported for the bitter and sour ratings, Typeface 7 was rated as more bitter than\nTypeface 12, and as more sour than Typeface 9. As for the sweet ratings, participants rated\nTypeface 1 as sweeter than Typefaces 7 and 8, and Typefaces 2 and 5 as sweeter than\nThe results of Experiment 1 are consistent with previous research in suggesting that round\nshapes and typefaces are strongly associated with sweet, while angular shapes and typefaces\nare more strongly associated with the other basic taste words (e.g., Velasco et al., 2014, 2015a,\nVelasco, Woods, Liu, & Spence, 2015b). One may wonder, however, whether the typefaces\nused in our first experiment would consistently be rated as more angular or round. In\naddition, one might also consider whether typeface or taste associations can be thought of\nFigure 3. Mean ratings in the task with typeface (a), and the task with typeface and cup (b) in Experiment 1.\nVelasco et al. 5\nas a kind of affective correspondence (Marks, 1978; Velasco et al., 2015a). Typefaces are\nparticularly intriguing in this regard as how easy or difficult they are to process may, in turn,\nbe related to our preference for them (Gump, 2001; Song & Schwarz, 2008); Stimuli that are\nhighly fluent have been shown to be associated with positive affect and more positive\njudgments (Winkielman, Schwarz, Fazendeiro, & Reber, 2003). Experiment 2 was\nconducted in order to assess whether the participants would consistently categorize the\ntypefaces on a RA scale. The participants also rated how easy or difficult they found it to\nread the different typefaces, and how much they liked them.\nExperiment 2\nMethods and Materials\nyears) took part in this online study. Following the same procedure used in Experiment 1, the\nparticipants were asked to arrange the different typefaces in three different scales or trials:\nRA, liking, and legibility (easiness or difficulty to read). The three trials were randomly\npresented.\nResults and Discussion\nThe results are summarized in Figure 4. Each variable was analyzed by means of a\nFriedman's test. The results revealed a significant difference in liking, 2(11, n \u00bc 99) \u00bc\nPairwise comparisons revealed that participants liked Typefaces 1 to 6 significantly more\ncomparisons). Moreover, the participants rated Typefaces 7 to 12 as significantly more\nangular than Typefaces 1 to 6 and Typeface 5 as more angular than Typeface 4 (p < .05,\nFigure 4. Mean ratings in the task presented in Experiment 2. Note that Typefaces 1 to 6 were generally\nliked and considered round and easy to read, whereas Typefaces 7 to 12 were generally liked less and\nconsidered more angular and less easy to read. RA \u00bc roundness/angularity.\nfor all comparisons). Finally, the participants considered Typefaces 7 to 12 to be less easy to\nread than Typefaces 1 to 6, Typeface 7 less than Typefaces 9 to 11, Typefaces 8 and 12 less\nthan 10, and Typeface 3 less than Typefaces 1, 2, 5, and 6 (p < .05, for all comparisons).\nKendall's Tau correlations between RA, legibility, and liking, as a function of the typeface\naverages, were also calculated. A significant positive correlation was observed between RA\nand legibility (r \u00bc .73, p < .001). The more angular the typeface was rated, the less easy it was\nto read. In addition, significant negative correlations were observed between RA and liking\nthe typeface ratings, the less the participants liked it, and the less easy the typeface was to\nread, the less liked it was.\nTaste or Typeface Correspondence\nBased on the results of Experiment 2, further analysis of the data from Experiment 1 was\nconducted in order to determine whether those typefaces that were considered as round as a\nwhole versus those that were considered as angular would influence taste ratings differently.\nHere, the data from the two tasks in Experiment 1 (as the results were virtually the same)\nwere combined, and the different taste word scores were averaged as a function of the round\n(1\u00ad6) and angular (7\u00ad12) typefaces.1 A 2 (RA: round, angular) \u00c2 4 (taste: bitter, salty, sour,\nsweet) ATS revealed a significant effect of RA, FATS\n1) \u00bc 116.44, p < .001. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni correction revealed that\nthe angular typefaces received higher taste ratings than the round typefaces (p < .001).\nPairwise comparisons also revealed that, overall, sweet ratings were lower compared with\nthe other taste ratings (p < .001, for all comparisons). As for the interaction term, a significant\nsignificantly higher for the round typefaces, and significantly lower for the angular\ntypefaces, as compared with the other tastes (p < .05, for all comparisons).\nThe latter results confirmed what was initially suggested in Experiment 1. The participants\nassociated round typefaces with sweet tastes and angular typefaces with the other tastes. Note\nthat rounder typefaces were liked more and were also considered as being easier to read.\nIn addition, it is well known that people prefer sweet tastes (e.g., Drewnowski, 1997).\nIt would therefore seem like there is an intrinsic relationship between RA, fluency, and\nliking (cf. Bar & Neta, 2006; Collier, 1996), which, in turn, influences the crossmodal\ncorrespondence between such feature and tastes. As Marks (1978, p. 75) puts it some years\nago: ``It just might be that the affective or hedonic dimension of sensation forms, in part, a\nbasis for qualitative similarities among the senses.''\nGeneral Discussion\nThe present study was designed to assess the way in which people match shapes to taste\nwords, and typefaces, varying in their RA, to taste words. The results reported here\nadd weight to the notion that ``sweet'' tends as be associated with round shapes and forms\n(Velasco et al., 2015a; 2015b). Furthermore, the results also suggest a clear distinction\nbetween round and angular typefaces, with the former being liked more, considered as\neasier to read, and associated with sweet, compared with the latter which were less liked,\nconsidered less easy to read, and associated with the other tastes (e.g., sour, salty, and bitter).\nOverall, these results are consistent with previous research showing that there is no apparent\nVelasco et al. 7\ndistinction between bitter, salty, and sour, when participants match them to curvy and\nWhy would people match tastes and typefaces varying in their roundness and angularity?\nIn a recent study, Velasco et al. (2015a) demonstrated that taste hedonics can influence the\nway in which people match tastes to shapes. In other words, the more that an individual likes\na taste, the more they will choose a round shape to match it to, and the less they like it, the\nmore they will tend to associate the taste with an angular shape instead (see also Velasco\net al., 2015b). It has been suggested that this may be related to the idea that people prefer\nround objects, as compared with angular objects (e.g., Bar & Neta, 2006; Westerman et al.,\nCrucially, previous research has suggested that the features of typeface convey emotional\nmeaning, with curved typefaces being associated with more positively valenced emotions and\nangular typefaces being associated with more negatively valenced emotions (Kastl & Child,\nmeans that it is possible to hypothesize that those who associate curved typefaces with\nmore positively valenced emotions will be more likely to associate them with sweetness, a\ntaste that is known for its positive hedonic effect on humans (Drewnowski, 1997; Steiner,\nTherefore, it is possible to think that taste or typeface correspondences may be thought\nof as a form of affective correspondence (e.g., Collier, 1996; see also Marks, 1996). The\nidea here is that certain cross-sensory matches may be based on a common feeling elicited\nby the information presented to two different senses (e.g., music and colors, see Palmer,\nSchloss, Xu, & Prado-Leon, 2013; or odors and colors, Schifferstein & Tanudjaja, 2004).\nAn alternative explanation that is not necessarily incompatible (it should rather be\nconsidered as complementary) with the latter is related to how easy the different\ntypefaces are to process (this is known as ``processing fluency'', e.g., Song & Schwartz,\n2008). Previous research has shown that processing fluency can result in positive affect\n(Winkielman & Cacioppo, 2001). That is, stimuli that are easy to process will be\nexperienced as more pleasing and evaluated more positively than those stimuli that are\nhard to process (see also Winkielman et al., 2003). As sweet is considered a pleasant taste,\nparticipants may match it to those typefaces that are easy-to-read and pleasing. The\nresults of the present study therefore reveal that there is a close relationship between\ntypeface RA, easiness to read, and liking, which in turn, may explain the\ncorrespondence between taste and typeface RA.\nThe type of scales that were used in Experiments 1 and 2 may, in part, explain the\nclear distinction between round and angular typefaces in all variables. It would therefore\nbe interesting to use different scales in future research. It would also be important to\nassess a participant's familiarity with the typefaces, as there is a relationship between\nfluency and familiarity (Westerman, Lanska, & Olds, 2014). While most of the\ntypefaces used here were novel, one may wonder whether they evoke feelings of\nfamiliarity and whether familiarity also plays a role on the associations between\ntypeface and taste.\nWhile we did not use actual tastants here, simply by using taste words, it is possible to have\nan estimate of the way in which people would match the tastes (Velasco et al., 2015a). It\nwould be interesting in future research to test such a hypothesis with, for example, flavors or\nperfumes. Another interesting direction for future research, and one that would allow for the\ntesting of the hypothesis forwarded here, would be to assess taste or typeface associations\nacross languages. Finally, one may also wonder whether specific semantic contents of words\n(e.g., cake) written in particular typefaces (round vs. angular) may interact in their\nassociation to taste (perhaps in a Stroop-like fashion).\nConflict of Interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nCharles Spence would like to acknowledge the Rethinking the Senses grant from the AHRC (UK; AH/\nNote\n1. One-sample t tests were performed in order to assess whether the different typefaces would differ\nfrom the midpoint (50) of the RA, liking, and ease-of-reading scales. As expected, Typefaces 1 to 6\nwere significantly different from the midpoint toward the round end of the scale and Typefaces 7 to\n12 toward the angular end of the scale. Moreover, the round (1\u00ad6) typefaces were significantly liked\n(significantly toward ``like'') and considered easy to read (significantly toward ``easy''), while the\nangular typefaces (7\u00ad12) were significantly disliked (toward ``dislike'') and considered difficult to\nread (significantly toward difficult, p < .01, for all comparisons).\nReferences\nCelhay, F., Boysselle, J., & Cohen, J.
