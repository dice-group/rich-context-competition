Here we report\nthe construction and initial validation in the general popu-\nlation of the Inventory of Responses to Positive Affective\nStates (IRPAS), a trait self-report instrument intended to\ncomplement existing measures of response to positive\nemotion by extending measurement to a broad class of\nresponses to positive states including, but not limited to,\nstrategies that up- or down-regulate mood across a range of\ndifferent positive mood states. We discuss the rationale for\nsuch an extension below.\n\"Emotion regulation\" can be defined as a set of processes\nthat individuals engage in either consciously or non-\nconsciously, and with or without deliberate effort (Gross &\nThompson, 2007), that have the intention or effect of increas-\ning, decreasing, or maintaining emotional state. Gross (1998)\nproposes five stages at which regulation processes may occur:\nsituation selection, situation modification, attentional deploy-\nment, cognitive change, and response modification. The\nIRPAS is most closely concerned with the final stage, response\nmodification. Processes at this stage emerge once the emotion\nhas been elicited, and represent experiential, behavioral, or\nphysiological attempts to modulate the emotional response.\nIt has been proposed that while some individuals tend to\nengage in strategies that maintain or increase positive mood\nstrategies that suppress or reduce it (dampening: Wood,\nHiempel, & Michela, 2003). The study of positive mood up-\nregulation strategies has revealed a number of subtypes\nQuoidbach, Berry, Hansenne, & Mikolajczak, 2010), includ-\ning behavioral display (expressing emotion), being present\n(directing attention toward current experience), capitalizing\n(communicating and celebrating the event with others), posi-\ntive mental time travel (dwelling on positive emotional\nmemories), engagement (savoring and socializing), better-\nment (pursuing goals, personal growth), and indulgence\n(substance use and fantasy). Other behaviors that often arise\nduring positive affect and could act as savoring responses\ninclude gratitude and prosocial behaviors such as helping\nYet behavioral response to positive mood may go beyond\nthe deployment of strategies that have the immediate func-\ntion of changing or maintaining the emotional state. We may\nuse positive states as a platform from which to reach our\ngoals, for example, by capitalizing upon it and expressing\nour feelings to others (Langston, 1994), or by using the\nbroader attentional perspective associated with a period of\nhappiness to engage with new opportunities that will\n1University of Exeter, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nKim Wright, Department of Psychology, University of Exeter, Washington\nSinger Labs., Perry Road, Exeter EX4 4QG, UK.\nEmail: K.A.Wright@ex.ac.uk\nThe Construction of an Inventory of\nResponses to Positive Affective States\nKim Wright1 and Tamsin Armstrong1\n Keywords\npositive affect, positive emotions, affect regulation, savoring, dampening\n2 SAGE Open\npromote future happiness (Fredrickson, 1998). Positive\nmood has been found to \"undo\" the negative effects of\nengagement in exercises which typically appear to deplete\nmotivational resources; hence, periods of positive mood may\nrepresent times when one is best disposed to tackle the next\nin a series of demanding tasks (Tice, Baumeister, Shmueli, &\nMuraven, 2007). Finally, the findings of several studies sug-\ngest that positive mood renders individuals more open to\ntackling problems or areas of potential failure (e.g., Reed &\nAspinwall, 1998). Thus, individuals may show responses to\npositive mood states that do not directly regulate the present\nemotion, but instead channel the resources it imbues toward\nsome other purpose. Alternatively, individuals may display a\nrange of responses to the same positive state, some of which\nare mood regulatory while others are self- or goal regulatory\n(and some that overlap in terms of function); these may well\ncomplement one another and occur in sequence, in parallel,\nor in alternation. Therefore, rather than focusing only upon\nbehaviors that serve to directly change state, the IRPAS con-\nsiders the broader category of behaviors that occur in\nresponse to positive states, and may not represent deliberate\nregulatory attempts. In this way, it differs from the most\nclosely related existing instruments. The Ways of Savoring\nChecklist (WOSC; Bryant & Veroff, 2007) explores a variety\nof savoring and dampening responses, and as such is con-\ncerned primarily with behaviors that increase or decrease\npositive affect. Similarly, the Emotion Regulation Profile\u00ad\nRevised (ERP-R: N\u00e9lis, Quoidbach, Hansenne, &\nMikolajczak, 2011), the Positive Events and Responses\nSurvey (PEARS; Gentzler, Palmer, & Ramsey, 2015), the\nResponses to Positive Affect (RPA; Feldman, Joormann, &\nJohnson, 2008) scale, and the Inventory of Positive Emotion\nRegulation Strategies (IPERS: Livingstone & Srivastava,\n2012) specifically measure responses that down- and/or up-\nregulate positive emotions. Finally, the Savoring Beliefs\nInventory (Bryant, 2003) measures perceived ability to\nderive pleasure from past, current, and future positive events.\nWe argue that up- or down-regulation strategies are a subset\nof the broader class of behaviors that occur in response to\npositive affect, and thus to assess these responses more gen-\nerally, a more comprehensive instrument would be needed.\nOur intention is that the IRPAS should overlap conceptually\nwith these instruments (in terms of measuring behaviors gen-\nerally thought to up- or down-regulate positive mood), but\nshould also measure categories of response not currently\naddressed, informed by both theories of positive emotion\nfunction and empirical data from qualitative research into\npositive emotion experience.\nCorrespondingly, Study 1 describes the findings of quali-\ntative interviews with members of the general population,\nconducted with the aim of supplementing the existing litera-\nture on types of responses to positive mood. We adopted this\ninductive approach in recognition of the limitations of rely-\ning purely upon existing theory to inform the details of our\nquestionnaire items, particularly given that we intend the\nscale to address responses beyond those typically considered\nwithin savoring and dampening frameworks. Little theoreti-\ncal or empirical guidance is available as to the forms that\nthese types of responses might take; hence, the need for an\nexploratory approach (for a discussion of the place of induc-\ntive research, see Spector, Roselberg, Ryan, Schmitt, &\nZedeck, 2014). The validity of the types of responses puta-\ntively measured by the IRPAS, and of the distinctions drawn\nbetween them, is then investigated in Studies 2 and 3.\nA second unique aspect of the IRPAS is that we took into\naccount, deliberately and explicitly, a range of positive emo-\ntional states during item development. Discrete emotion\naccounts propose that positive emotions fall into categories\nrepresenting their particular functions in terms of self-regu-\nlation and social interaction (Shiota, Keltner, & John, 2006).\nCorrespondingly, particular positive states would be expected\nto prompt particular types of cognitive and behavioral\nresponses. For example, desire has been found to promote a\nmore narrow attentional focus than does amusement (Gable\n& Harmon-Jones, 2008). Also concerned with the function\nof positive emotion, the self-regulation model proposed by\nCarver and Scheier (1998) views certain positive emotions\nas indicators of the extent to which our progress toward a\ngoal corresponds to an ideal rate of progress. Thus, emotions\nsuch as enthusiasm act as signals to maintain or increase\nstriving toward a goal, whereas satisfaction or contentment\nsignals us to reduce or cease striving toward that goal. Hence,\nthe notion that positive emotions have a function leads to the\nprediction that different positive states will vary in terms of\nthe typical profile of response associated with them. While\nthe responses measured by existing instruments may well\napply to a range of positive emotions, to ensure that the\nIRPAS is relevant to more than one positive state we deliber-\nately draw upon theory and data concerning response pro-\nfiles to multiple positive states. Specifically, we use sets of\nemotion words (labeled calm, happy, enthusiastic, and\nactive) corresponding to four locations in affective space on\nthe dimensional model of affect proposed by Russell (1980);\nthis allows investigation of a range of positive states without\nrequiring participants to respond separately with respect to\nevery possible positive emotion.\nIn summary, the IRPAS is designed to facilitate research\ninto positive emotion, whereby researchers are concerned with\nwhat follows various positive mood states, in terms of behav-\nior. This may allow more nuanced investigation of some exist-\ning theories of positive affect functioning (such as \"Broaden\nand Build\"; Fredrickson, 1998), which hypothesize a relation-\nship between positive mood and self- or goal regulation, and\nmay also give greater scope to delineate aspects of positive\nemotion that are dysregulated in psychological disorders.\nTo inform scale development, in Study 1 we conducted\nsemi-structured interviews with members of the general\nWright and Armstrong 3\npublic, asking participants to describe their responses to\nfour types of positive states.\nMethod\nParticipants, measures, and procedure.\nThe study was\napproved by the appropriate departmental ethics review\nboard, and all participants gave written, informed consent.\nParticipants were 21 members of the general public,\nrecruited through a database of volunteers and via commu-\nnity advertisement, with no financial remuneration for par-\nticipation. Participants were required to be aged 18 or above\nand with sufficient competence in English to complete the\ninterview. The mean age of the sample was 60.30 (SD =\nfemale. Interviews were conducted by a female interviewer\nby telephone or in person, dictated by participant prefer-\nence. The semi-structured interview conducted was devel-\noped for the purpose of this study. Participants were asked\nto consider four positive mood states in turn, selected to cor-\nrespond to four locations in affective space on the dimen-\nsional model of affect proposed by Russell (1980). These\nwere characterized by high activation, moderate positive\nvalence (active, alert, stimulated, determined, or attentive:\n\"active\"); high activation, high positive valence (enthusias-\ntic, elated, excited, peppy, lively, or strong: \"enthusiastic\");\nmoderate activation, high positive valence (happy, pleased,\nglad, satisfied, kindly, or warmhearted: \"happy\"); and low\nactivation, moderate positive valence (calm, at rest, placid,\nrelaxed, quiet, or serene: \"calm\").\nFor each state, participants were asked to identify and\ndescribe a specific instance of experiencing that state, and\nthen to report what they did and thought once in that positive\nmood. In particular, they were asked if their actions or\nthoughts were different when in this state, whether there was\nanything in particular they did not do or think when in this\nstate, and whether they did or thought anything to try to\nincrease, decrease, or maintain the state. Participants were\nthen asked these questions with reference to how they would\ntypically respond to that type of positive mood. The order in\nwhich the four types of positive mood were asked about was\ncounterbalanced across participants. Participant responses\nwere recorded by the interviewer contemporaneously in\nwriting.\nAnalysis.\nA framework analysis approach was applied\n(Ritchie & Spencer, 1994). The first five transcripts were\nindependently coded by two raters, and an initial thematic\nframework was agreed through a process of consensus and\nconciliation (Phase 1). The remainder of the transcripts were\ncoded by Rater 1, and changes to the thematic framework\nwere noted (Phase 2). Rater 1 then recoded all interviews\nusing the new framework (Phase 3). The framework and\nindexing were then checked by Rater 2, and a final frame-\nwork was agreed (Phase 4). The themes that emerged from\nthe analysis were then mapped to characterize the nature and\nrange of the concepts identified, the associations between\nthem, and their relationships with the literature (Phase 5).\nBecause an aim of Study 1 was to inform development of\nmultiple items for the IRPAS, subthemes were identified to\nprovide greater detail on the facets of each major theme.\nResults\nIn Phase 1, seven major themes were identified. Two were\nremoved and three new themes added in Phase 2. Phase 4\nresulted in removal of two, producing a final set of six broad\nthemes (Table 1); four of which comprised of two or more\ndistinct subthemes. Four subthemes broke down further to\ngive two or more minor subthemes (see supplementary mate-\nrial for details of subthemes). Thematic saturation with\nrespect to the broad thematic framework (whereby analysis\nof subsequent participants did not result in addition of new\nthemes) was achieved by Transcript 7.\nChanneling describes responses which capitalize upon\nthe present positive state and channel the associated motiva-\ntion, optimism, or energy toward either achieving existing\ngoals or developing new ones. A number of participants\nreported that on some occasions of positive mood, they con-\ntinue with what they have planned, regardless of their mood\nstate: We termed this response style Mood Independence.\nBorrowing from the existing literature on this topic, we used\nthe term savoring to refer to responses whereby participants\nactively participated in or enjoyed the mood state, but did not\nseek to influence it.\nIn contrast, mood management describes strategies used\nwith the stated or apparent intention to influence mood state.\nAlteration of activation was achieved by altering physiology\n(e.g., by taking stimulants), engaging in particular thoughts\nor activities, or selecting particular environments, and this\nresponse style appeared in relation to both high and low acti-\nvation positive states. Participants also described engaging in\nresponses likely to influence the level of pleasantness they\nwere experiencing. Some responses involved approaching\npleasant thoughts, activities, or environments, while others\ninvolved avoiding unpleasant thoughts, activities, or envi-\nronments. Responses used with the stated or apparent inten-\ntion of dampening mood, or of monitoring mood state with a\nview to keeping it under control, were categorized under the\nsubtheme of dampening/monitoring.\nA number of participants described engaging in reflec-\ntion/reappraisal, such that they reframed the situation or\ntheir life, thought in depth about the self or the world, or\nanalyzed the cause of their mood. The final major theme\nidentified, connectedness, describes those responses that\nappeared to strengthen or reestablish the individual's con-\nnection with a larger entity. Many participants described\nconnecting with others by sharing emotion, interacting, or by\nhelping others. A small number of participants described\nreaffirming their connection with more abstract or higher\n4 SAGE Open\nconstructs such as nature, religion or spiritual matters, and\nculture or beauty. The third subtheme we identified within\nthe connectedness theme concerned gratitude, which had\noverlapped with the social and higher connectedness sub-\nthemes but also included non-specific thoughts of gratitude.\nDiscussion\nWe identified six broad themes and associated subthemes.\nRepresented in these subthemes were a number of responses\nto positive states previously described in the literature, par-\nticularly within the context of the Broaden and Build theory\n(Fredrickson, 1998) and the literature on savoring (Bryant,\npositive states allow individuals to temporarily expand their\nthought\u00adaction repertoire, for example, by engaging in\nexploratory behaviors or by savoring and integrating current\nexperience: These tendencies are reflected in the channeling,\nsavoring, and reflection/reappraisal themes, respectively. In\naddition to the savoring theme itself, the reflection/reap-\npraisal and connectedness themes could be seen as reflecting\naspects of savoring that accord with a broad definition of the\nconstruct, as could the pleasantness subtheme of mood man-\nagement. In our analysis, we differentiated savoring from\nresponses that appeared to be better described as seeking\nconnection with others and with higher entities.\nDespite overall congruence with previous influential\naccounts of response to positive mood, the mood indepen-\ndence and altering activation themes identified here do not\nsit comfortably within these frameworks. In the latter case,\nthis may be because in addition to asking participants to\nreflect upon high valence states (enthusiastic and happy) we\nasked them to reflect on states of both very high (\"active\")\nand very low (\"calm\") activation, thus increasing the likeli-\nhood that participants would report strategies concerned with\nthe management of activation levels. In addition, the estab-\nlished concepts of Broaden and Build and Savoring focus\nupon specific types of responses to positive states. Therefore,\nit would be expected that the current analysis, which seeks to\ncapture a range of commonly occurring RPA, should identify\nadditional themes.\nThe aim of Study 2 was to construct a reliable measure of\nresponse to positive mood, the items within which were\ndrawn from the thematic categories identified in Study 1.\nMethod\nItem development. Items were generated on the basis of the\nthemes and subthemes identified. Where possible, para-\nphrased quotations from individual transcripts were used to\nconstruct items. Sufficient items were generated to allow a\nminimum set of four for each theme or subtheme or minor\nsubtheme, to give a total of 105, of which 22 were reversed\nitems.\nA 4-point fully anchored Likert-type scale was presented\nwith each item, where 1 = almost never, 2 = sometimes, 3 =\noften, 4 = almost always. Participants were given the follow-\ning instructions:\nThe questions that follow ask about how you tend to respond\nwhen you are in a positive mood. Before you answer them,\nplease bring to mind particular times when you were in a positive\nmood or felt good. These might be very recent times as well as\nTable 1.

Also, we\nwould like you to tell us how you actually think and act, rather\nthan how you believe you ought to.\nParticipants.\nParticipants were 540 individuals recruited\nfrom the general population and the undergraduate student\npopulation of the host institution. A total of 456 participants\n(84%) were recruited via two Internet-based sites that pro-\nvide opportunities for volunteers to complete research stud-\nies online. In addition, 84 participants (16%) were students\nwho were given the opportunity to participate in the study in\none of two face-to-face testing sessions in exchange for\ncourse credit. The mean age of participants was 22.52 years\nDetails of nationality were provided by 256 participants: Of\nwere Central or South American, and 12 (5%) were Austra-\nwho provided data on this.\nMeasures and procedure.The study was approved by the\nappropriate departmental ethics review board. After giving\ninformed consent, participants completed the state version of\nthe Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson,\nClark, & Tellegen, 1988), a commonly used self-report mea-\nsure of current mood state that assesses current levels of posi-\ntive and negative affect separately. Participants also completed\nthe Hypomanic Personality Questionnaire (Eckblad & Chap-\nman, 1986): Findings pertaining to this measure are not\nreported here. Finally, participants completed the IRPAS.\nResults\nFor the sample as a whole, mean PANAS Positive Affect\nare within the range that would be expected from a non-\nclinical population (Watson et al., 1988).\nData were subjected to exploratory factor analysis using\nthe principal axis factoring method. An oblique rotation\n(direct oblim, \u00d0 = 0) was used as it was predicted that some\nof the constructs would be correlated. There were 24 factors\nwith eigenvalues greater than 1, accounting for 64.36% of\nthe variance. Application of Cattell's (1966) criterion to the\nscree plot of eigenvalues indicated that extraction of 12 or 13\nfactors would be appropriate. Parallel analysis based on 500\nfactor analyses of automatically generated random datasets\nrevealed 12 factors with eigenvalues greater than the 95th\npercentile of eigenvalues produced from the random datas-\nets. Therefore, a 12-factor solution was adopted.\nTo generate subscales for the IRPAS while reducing the\ntotal number of items in the scale from 105, we retained only\nitems that had both high factor loadings (0.4 or above) and\nresulted in a decrease of the subscale alpha value when\ndeleted. In addition, those items loading substantially on\nmore than one factor were eliminated, giving a maximum of\nseven items per subscale and a minimum of 3 (one factor\ncontained only two items that loaded substantially upon it\nand was therefore not included as a subscale). The resulting\nscale comprised 11 subscales and 59 items. Table 2 displays\nthe retained items constituting each subscale, with details of\nthe subscale title, factor loadings, alpha value, mean (SD),\nminimum and maximum for each subscale. While some sub-\nscale titles were drawn directly from Study 1, in some cases,\nit was necessary to generate new titles to best capture the\nsubscale content. In general, internal consistency values for\nthe subscales were found to be adequate, with lower values\npotentially reflecting the small number of items in some sub-\nscales.1 For all subscales, participant scores were distributed\nalong the full range of possible scores. Scores were left\nskewed for two subscales (Dampening and Stimulating)\nreflecting a tendency for participants to endorse lower rates\nof these responses; however, standard deviations of scores on\nthese subscales were comparable with those obtained for\nsubscales with the same number of items.\nBivariate correlational analyses were used to explore\nthe relationships between the 11 subscales. Details of these\ncorrelations are given in Table 3. In general, the subscales\nshowed low to moderate positive correlations with one\nanother, with the exception of the Dampening subscale\nwhich showed some negative correlations with other sub-\nscales, and the Stimulating subscale which showed low\ncorrelations with the majority of subscales other than\nDampening, with which it was moderately positively\ncorrelated.\nRelationship between subscale scores and other variables.A\nsmall positive correlation was found between age and Grati-\ntude score, r = .11, p = .011. Small negative correlations\nwere found between age and Savoring, r = -.12, p = .006,\nCurrent level of positive affect was found to have small\nto moderate positive correlations with all subscales other\nthan Dampening and Stimulating, correlations with which\nwere negligible (see Table 3). Current level of negative\naffect was found to have small positive correlations with\n6 SAGE Open\nTable 2.

Scores on the resulting sub-\nscales spanned the full range of each subscale, and standard\ndeviations were broadly comparable across subscales of\nequivalent item number, supporting the potential of the\nsubscales to capture variability between respondents in\ntheir response styles. Scores on the Dampening and\nStimulating subscales were left skewed, indicating that for\nmany participants, these response styles do not reflect their\ntypical behavior, but that these scales may capture response\npatterns that characterize a minority. Scores on the majority\nof subscales were found to be associated with current mood\nstate; however, because of the cross-sectional nature of this\nstudy, it would be premature to conclude that current mood\nstate biases responses on the IRPAS.\nConsistent with existing measures of response to positive\nmood, the IRPAS asked participants to report their typical\nresponses to episodes of (general) positive mood. To charac-\nterize the states that participants were referencing when they\ncompleted the item set, we asked them to endorse any of\nfour positive states. Each of the four states was endorsed by\nat least some of the participants, supporting the IRPAS as a\nmeasure developed from data applicable to a broad range of\npositive states. When individuals endorsing only one state\nwere compared with one another in terms of their scores on\nthe IRPAS subscales, only active mood was found to be\nassociated with a distinct response profile, suggesting that\nactive positive mood in particular may lead to specific\nbehavioral responses less common in other positive mood\nstates, and potentially with different implications for subse-\nquent affect. However, this comparison was limited by the\ninclusion of only a subset of the whole sample and its non-\nrandomized design, whereby referenced mood state is likely\nto be confounded with individual differences. To explore\ndefinitively the relationship between referenced mood state\nand response profile, future studies might randomize indi-\nviduals to call to mind one of a number of positive states\nwhile completing the measure.\nTest\u00adretest reliability and convergent and divergent valid-\nity of the IRPAS were investigated among two further\nsamples. In terms of assessing the validity of the IRPAS,\nwe selected the three measures most closely related to the\nIRPAS conceptually, namely the Response to Positive\nAffect (RPA; Feldman et al., 2008) scale, the positive emo-\ntion regulation subscales of the ERP-R (N\u00e9lis et al., 2011)\nand the WOSC (Bryant & Veroff, 2007). Predictions\nregarding convergent validity were made on the basis of\nconceptual overlap between particular WOSC, RPA, ERP-\nR, and IRPAS subscales, where conceptually equivalent\nsubscales existed across measures.\nBecause the three existing scales focus broadly upon\nsavoring and dampening strategies, we sought to explore\noverlap between these existing subscales and the most\nclosely related subscales of the IRPAS. In addition, the\nIRPAS includes a \"gratitude\" subscale which is also present\nas a specific savoring subscale within the WOSC. Thus in\nterms of convergent validity, significant positive correlations\nwere predicted between (1) IRPAS savoring and the closest\nequivalent subscales assessing savoring in the other mea-\nsures, namely WOSC absorption, RPA emotion focus, RPA\nself-focus, ERP-R savoring total score; (2) IRPAS gratitude\nand its equivalent, WOSC blessings; (3) IRPAS dampening\nand the closest equivalent subscales in the other measures,\nnamely WOSC killjoy thinking, RPA dampening, ERP-R\ndampening total score.\nThe following prediction was made regarding diver-\ngent validity. It centers upon divergence between the\nIRPAS Dampening subscale and the Savoring (or non-\nDampening) subscales of the WOSC, RPA, and ERP-R\nbecause the former is the only IRPAS subscale to attempt\nto measure responses likely to decrease mood valence,\ntherefore should not be positively correlated with sub-\nscales measuring responses that up-regulate positive\nmood. (4) IRPAS Dampening will have negligible or neg-\native correlations with WOSC, RPA, and ERP-R subscales\nother than WOSC killjoy thinking, RPA dampening, and\nERP-R dampening total. Finally, given that the IRPAS is\ndesigned to encompass savoring and dampening strategies\nbut not to be limited to these, and should also encompass\nstrategies relevant to a range of positive states, it was pre-\ndicted that (5) the IRPAS would appear to make a novel\ncontribution to the measurement of positive emotion, evi-\ndenced by at least some of its subscales (excluding those\nalready mentioned in predictions 1-4) having low to neg-\nligible correlations with all WOSC, RPA, and ERP-R\nsubscales.\nMethod\nParticipants. For both studies, samples of more than 84 were\nrequired to detect a moderate effect size (R = .3) with  = .05\nand power = .80. Participants in the first sample were 102\nstudents who gave written informed consent to participate in\nthe study as part of a practical class and in exchange for\ncourse credit. The mean age of participants was 20.23 (SD =\nsample were 116 students who gave written informed con-\nsent to participate in the study as part of a practical class. The\nwere male.\nWright and Armstrong 9\nMeasures\nself-report questionnaire, whereby participants indicate\non a 7-point scale to what extent each item describes how\nthey typically respond to positive mood.

It contains three subscales: Self-\nFocused Positive Rumination (rumination on self and person-\nally relevant goals), Emotion-Focused Positive Rumination\n(rumination on mood and somatic experiences), and Damp-\nening (thoughts likely to dampen positive mood). It has been\nfound to show acceptable levels of internal consistency, and\nit predicted patterns of associations with depressive rumina-\ntion, self-esteem, and depressive and manic symptoms.\nERP-R. The ERP-R (N\u00e9lis et al., 2011) is a vignette-based\nself-report measure in which respondents must select one of\neight reactions which would best reflect their response, for\neach of 15 scenarios, each depicting a different emotional\nexperience (including both positive and negative emotions).\nScores can be computed for both up- and down-regulation of\nboth positive and negative emotions. In the current study, we\nconsidered the positive emotion regulation subscales. Up-\nregulation subscales include Behavioral Display (express-\ning positive feelings non-verbally), Savoring the Present\nMoment (directing awareness to current experience), capi-\ntalizing (communicating and sharing positive events with\nothers), and Positive Mental Time Travel (remembering or\nanticipating positive events). Down-regulation subscales\ninclude Inhibition of Emotion Expression (suppressing posi-\ntive emotions), Inattention (attending to activities other than\nthe positive event), Fault-Finding (attending to the negatives\nof the event), and Negative Mental Time Travel (remember-\ning negative aspects of the event or anticipating negative\nconsequences connected with it). Evidence of divergent and\nconvergent validity has been found for the ERP-R in rela-\ntion to verbal skills and non-verbal reasoning, and emotional\nintelligence, respectively.\nThe IRPAS, described previously, was also included.\nProcedure.The study was approved by the appropriate\ndepartmental ethics review board. Sample 1 completed the\nIRPAS at Time 1. At Time 2, which took place 1 month later,\nthey completed the IRPAS and the WOSC, with the order of\npresentation being randomized across participants. Sample 2\ncompleted the IRPAS, RPA, and ERP-R at one time point,\nwith the order of administration being randomized across\nparticipants.\nResults\nSample 1. To estimate test\u00adretest reliability within Sample 1,\nthe intraclass correlation coefficient (single rating value)\nscores for the 11 IRPAS subscales were calculated for Times\n1 and 2, using a two-way random-effects model. This resulted\nin estimates of reliability ranging from .59 to .87 (see Table 2).\nNine of the subscales showed \"substantial\" test\u00adretest agree-\nment; one showed \"almost perfect\" agreement, with only one\n(Analyzing) showing \"moderate\" agreement (Landis & Koch,\n1977). Correlational analyses were conducted to explore rela-\ntionships between subscales of the IRPAS and the WOSC\n(Table 4; both as measured at Time 2). Correlation coefficients\nranged from R = -.31 to R = .64. A total of 17 correlation coef-\nficients (15%) were of at least moderate strength (R  .30). To\ntest predictions concerning convergent validity, a conservative\nalpha level of p < .01 was applied. As predicted, IRPAS savor-\ning was significantly positively correlated with WOSC absorp-\ntion, IRPAS gratitude was significantly positively correlated\nwith WOSC blessings, and IRPAS dampening was signifi-\ncantly positively correlated with WOSC killjoy thinking. To\ntest the prediction concerning divergent validity, an alpha\nlevel of p < .05 was applied (the conservative approach being\nto maximize the likelihood of finding a significant associa-\ntion). Consistent with Prediction 4, IRPAS dampening was not\nsignificantly positively correlated with any WOSC subscale\nother than those predicted.\nSample 2. Correlational analyses were conducted to explore\nrelationships between subscales of the IRPAS and the RPA\nand ERP-R (Table 4). Correlation coefficients ranged from\nwere of at least moderate strength (R  .30). As predicted,\nIRPAS savoring was significantly positively correlated with\nRPA emotion focus, RPA self-focus, and ERP-R savoring\ntotal. Also as predicted, IRPAS dampening was significantly\npositively correlated with RPA dampening and ERP-R damp-\nening total. It was also significantly positively correlated with\none of the ERP-R subscales contributing to dampening total\nscore, Fault-Finding. Consistent with Prediction 4, IRPAS\ndampening was not significantly positively correlated with\nany RPA or ERP-R subscales other than those predicted.\nTo address the question of whether the IRPAS makes a\nnovel contribution to the measurement of response to posi-\ntive emotion (Prediction 5), we identified IRPAS subscales\nthat did not correlate with other WOSC, RPA, or ERP-R sub-\nscales at least moderately (R < .30) in all cases. Three IRPAS\nsubscales did not have such relationships with other sub-\nscales: Stimulating, Avoiding, and Calming.\nDiscussion\nExamination of test\u00adretest reliability for the IRPAS revealed\nthis to be acceptable over a period of 1 month. Overall, the\nIRPAS was not highly correlated with any of the existing\nmeasures, but a minority of relationships between scales\nwere of at least moderate strength: This is to be expected,\ngiven that each measures a different but overlapping set of\nconstructs.\nSupportive of the convergent validity of the IRPAS scale,\nits subscales showed the expected pattern of associations\nwith subscales of the three other measures. Supportive of the\ndivergent validity of the IRPAS, the Dampening subscale\nwas positively associated only with subscales from the other\nmeasures addressing dampening.\nWhile these findings are encouraging, this study is limited\nasacomprehensiveassessmentofIRPASvalidity.Conceptual\noverlap between the IRPAS and the three existing measures\nused is not complete; therefore, we did not have a standard\nagainst which to assess some of the more novel subscales of\nthe IRPAS. Second, while the measures we assessed the\nIRPAS against are used in contemporary research, none of\nthese have been exhaustively validated. Therefore, we were\nnot able to access a \"gold standard\" against which to validate\nour novel measure. Third, given that RPA may not occur in\nisolation from one another, convergence between pairs of\nsubscales may reflect behaviors that tend to occur together,\nrather than behaviors that are same in form and function.\nFourth, although the ERP-R did differ methodologically\nfrom the IRPAS, all measures utilized self-report: Further\nresearch should seek to validate the IRPAS against behav-\nioral measures of response to positive mood. Finally, our\nsample was composed of University students, of whom the\nmajority were young adults, despite items having been gen-\nerated from a study conducted with an older sample. Validity\nin older, non-student samples requires investigation.\nImportantly, it appears that the IRPAS measures some con-\nstructs not addressed by the WOSC: Three IRPAS subscales\nshowed low to negligible correlations with all WOSC, RPA,\nand ERP-R subscales. This may reflect two intentional dif-\nferences between the IRPAS and the other three scales. First,\nthe latter scales are intended as more in-depth measures of\nresponses that up- or down-regulate positive mood, whereas\nthe IRPAS is intended to include responses that may not have\na direct regulatory effect. Second, the content of the IRPAS\nis informed by individuals'reports of response to a variety of\npositive mood states and may therefore capture strategies,\nsuch as \"calming,\" that may not be relevant to the affective\nstates referred to by existing measures. Thus, the measures\nTable 4. Pearson's Correlation Coefficient Values for Relationships Between Subscales of the IRPAS and the WOSC, RPA, and ERP-R.\nSa Gr Daa St Hi Ch He Ca An Ac Av\nNote.

The resulting\nset of subscales were found to have adequate internal consis-\ntency and test\u00adretest reliability, and to show the expected\npattern of associations with subscales of existing measures\nof similar constructs.\nThe IRPAS appears to measure some constructs not\naddressed by the other measures investigated, suggesting\nthat it has the potential to make a novel contribution to the\ninvestigation of the regulation of positive emotion. Study 3\ndemonstrates empirical divergence between the Calming,\nStimulating, and Avoiding subscales and those of the\nWOSC, RPA, and ERP-R; they also diverge theoretically, in\nthat Stimulating and Calming appear to reflect responses\nlikely to follow increases in activation in particular, whereas\nthe measures investigated are largely concerned with man-\nagement of the valence rather than the arousal dimension of\npositive mood. This may rest in part upon the approach\ntaken in the development of the IRPAS, whereby items were\ndesigned to capture responses to a range of different positive\nstates, including high and low activation positive states. On\nthis basis, we would predict that scores on these IRPAS sub-\nscales would not correlate strongly with the scores on the\nsubscales of a recent instrument, the PEARS (Gentzler\net al., 2015), which measures aspects of savoring and damp-\nening. Theoretical divergence of the IRPAS from these\ninstruments is also present with regard to the concept of\n\"Channeling,\" whereby individuals do not engage in behav-\niors that function to up- or down-regulate positive mood but\ninstead use this mood as an opportunity to achieve goals,\nand \"analyzing\" whereby the individual seeks to understand\nthe causes, meanings, and consequences of his or her mood.\nIt may be that these constructs are captured within the\n\"Betterment\" subscale of the IPERS (Livingstone &\nSrivastava, 2012). The IPERS also contains a subscale\n(Indulgence) that makes reference to substance use and as\nsuch may overlap empirically with the Stimulating subscale.\nFuture research should explore the relationship between the\nAlthough the IRPAS was designed to capture a range of\nresponses to positive mood, it cannot be considered to be\ncomprehensive. Nevertheless, in Study 1, thematic satura-\ntion was reached by Participant 7 of 21, suggesting that, in\nthis sample at least, response repertoire was relatively gener-\nalizable across individuals, supporting the wider applicabil-\nity of this framework. In terms of its applicability to different\ntypes of positive emotions, we assessed states located at four\nlocations on a dimensional model of affect. Future studies\ncould explore whether the IRPAS appears to reflect typical\nresponses to discrete emotions such as awe, amusement, and\ncompassion. While the IRPAS is intended as a trait measure,\nalbeit concerning state-based responding, the current study\nrevealed correlations between participants'current mood and\nIRPAS responses. As such, further research is needed to\ncharacterize the extent to which the IRPAS reflects trait ver-\nsus state-related behavioral tendencies.\nThe IRPAS was developed based on data from primarily\nfemale samples. Given that men and women may differ in\nthe use of some emotion regulation strategies (Gross &\nJohn, 2003), we cannot exclude the possibility that, during\nitem development, we failed to discover constructs that are\nof unique relevance to male individuals due to our sample\ncharacteristics. Validation of the IRPAS was conducted in\nsamples of (primarily) young adults in University educa-\ntion; therefore, further research is needed to estimate its\nproperties in older, non-student populations. This may also\nallow investigation of developmental trajectories of both\npositive affect experience and response profiles, something\nthat was not taken into account in the thematic analysis\nwithin the current study. Furthermore, response to and dis-\nplays of positive emotion are likely to be influenced signifi-\ncantly by social and cultural background and context. While\nthe limited data we obtained indicate that the sample of indi-\nviduals in our factor analytic study was fairly diverse in\nterms of nationality, this information was neither complete\nnor reliable enough to permit examination of differences in\nresponse to positive emotion in relation to cultural or social\nfactors. Future work should aim both to characterize partici-\npants in terms of these factors and to investigate the validity\nof the IRPAS cross-culturally.\nFurther exploration of the validity of the IRPAS should\ninclude tests of predictive validity, for example, correlating\nsubscale scores with behavior post laboratory positive mood\ninduction or during real-life instances of positive mood via\nexperience sampling studies. Examples of dependent vari-\nables include tendency to invest energy in goals and chal-\nlenges (\"channeling\") and tendency to opt to help others\n(\"helping\"). Tests of predictive validity could also include\ninvestigating the extent to which IRPAS scores predict or are\npredicted by presence of psychological disorders or difficul-\nties, based on theoretical understandings of positive affect\nregulation in these conditions. For example, individuals with\nbipolar disorder would be expected to show higher rates of\nbehaviors that increase activation levels once in a positive\nmood, such as activating, and that involve the pursuit of\ngoals, such as channeling (see Mansell & Lam, 2006).\nThe IRPAS deliberately does not discriminate between\nbehaviors that arise as an intrinsic part of the emotional\nresponse (such as approaching goals when enthusiastic) and\nthose that represent attempts to regulate affect: We consider\nthis necessary to look beyond behavioral responses that are\nconcerned only with modifying affect directly. Furthermore,\nsuch an approach allows for between- and within-individual\nvariation in the function of these behaviors. Nevertheless,\nfuture development of the IRPAS might seek to test its prop-\nerties as a measure of either intrinsic response or regulatory\nattempts by, for example, asking the same individuals to\ncomplete two versions of the measure, differing only in\nwhether they ask respondents to focus upon naturally arising\nor deliberate responses.\nIn terms of its potential applications, the IRPAS may con-\ntribute to research into theories of positive affect response. For\nexample, Fredrickson's (1998) Broaden and Build model sug-\ngests that we may use positive states as a platform from which\nto reach our goals, thus creating further positive mood. The\nIRPAS provides a means of exploring the behaviors that facili-\ntate this, within one measure (and potentially in combination\nwith others). In particular, the Channeling subscale could be\nused to explore \"building\" via goal-focused behavior when in\npositive mood, while the Helping subscale (and Social\nExpressive subscales in other measures) might reflect strate-\ngies for building social capital. In contrast, one might predict\nthat an avoidant response style to positive mood (as measured\nby the novelAvoiding subscale) may allow less opportunity for\nthe individual to build external and relational resources, and\nthus be associated with less positive outcomes over the medium\nto long term. As previously mentioned, dysregulation of posi-\ntive emotion regulation processes may contribute to some psy-\nchological disorders. Studies in this area to date have tended to\nuse measures that focus on particular response styles to positive\nstates, such as savoring and rumination (e.g., Johnson,\nMcKenzie, & McMurrich, 2008), and in doing so have revealed\ndifferences between clinical and non-clinical samples. The\nIRPAS allows exploration of the specificity of these effects as\nit can investigate which of a range of response styles are altered.\nIn doing so, it could contribute to a picture of the broader pro-\nfile of response to positive affect associated with a given disor-\nder. In conclusion, we have described the development of a\nnovel measure of response to positive mood, which has poten-\ntial to contribute to research into positive emotion regulation in\nboth clinical and non-clinical populations.\n"
