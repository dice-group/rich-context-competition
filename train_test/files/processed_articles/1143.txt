Smith 1\n Introduction\nIn the literature on risk behaviors and behavioral change, there are two main types of\nmodels. What are collectively referred to as \"individual models\" are the predominant\nframeworks for studying risk behaviors, from smoking to unprotected sex. They are\nalso the predominant models used to study HIV/AIDS and its associated risk factors\nand have been very influential in determining the nature of interventions designed to\nstem the spread of HIV/AIDS in the developing and developed world. (Aggleton et al.\nmodels used to study HIV/AIDS are the Health Belief Model (e.g., Becker 1974,\nRosenstock, Strecher, and Becker 1994), the Theory of Reasoned Action (e.g., Fishbein\nCognitive or Learning Theory (e.g., Bandura 1977), Stages of Change (Prochaska,\nDiClemente, and Norcross 1992), and the AIDS Risk Reduction Model (Catania,\nTo varying degrees, these psychosocial models, created using cognitive-attitudinal\nand affective-motivational constructs (Kalichman 1998), are individual-centered,\nfocusing on the cognitive process leading to behavioral change (UNAIDS 1999,\nDenison 1996). Based on the premise that humans control their own behaviors and\nmake decisions that impact those behaviors, these models consider how individuals\ngarner information about a particular behavior, assess its impact, and determine whether\nthey are willing and capable of acting differently. As such, they concentrate on\npsychological and cognitive factors believed to influence behavioral change:\nindividuals' risk perceptions, attitudes and beliefs regarding risk reduction, outcome\nexpectations (which incorporate beliefs about the severity of a disease and perceived\nbenefits to action), intentions, perceived social norms, and self-efficacy, including\nModels and theories of risk behavior that focus on social and community factors\noperating independently of individual factors have more recently been developed in\nresponse to perceived limitations of the traditional cognitive-behavioral, individual\nmodels. Purveyors of these newer \"social models,\" which include Diffusion of\nInnovation theory (Note 1) (Rogers 1983), social inoculation models (e.g., Howard and\nMcCabe 1990), social network theories (e.g., Morris 1997, Auerbach, Wypijewska and\nBrodil 1994), and theories of gender and power (e.g., Connell 1987, DiClemente and\nWingood 1995), argue that behavioral change is not determined solely by individual\nvolition; rather, social relationships and structural and environmental factors constrain\npeople's options for change. According to a UNAIDS review article:\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 281\n\"[S]ocial researchers have come to realize that because complex health\nbehaviors such as sex take place in context, socio-cultural factors\nsurrounding the individual must be considered in designing prevention\nConsequently, social models concern themselves with influences that derive from social\nrelationships and the community of which the individual is a part.\n\"Social theories and models see individual behaviors embedded in their\nsocial and cultural context. Instead of focusing on psychological processes\nas the basis for sexual behavior, it tends to be social norms, relationships\nand gender imbalances that create the meaning and determinants of\nFactors considered by social models include social pressures, peer influences, cultural\nexpectations, economic factors affecting available resources, legal and political\nstructures, and political and religious ideologies that restrict individuals' options and\nthe flow of information (Aggleton et al. 1994).\nOne factor postulated implicitly or explicitly by almost all individual theories to\naffect behavioral change is perceived risk (Bunnell 1996, UNAIDS 1999), which has\nbeen described as the most salient feature of these models (Prochaska et al. 1990). The\nbulk of HIV/AIDS interventions combine elements of various theories of behavioral\nchange, but perceived risk remains a critical construct for even these transtheoretical\napproaches (UNAIDS 1999). The emphasis placed on perceived risk by theories and\ninterventions is supported by empirical studies that have found perceived risk to be a\nprerequisite for or correlate of behavioral change (e.g., Cerwonka, Isbell, and Hansen\nIn this study, I ask, what are the determinants of perceived risk? I also ask, are the\ndominant factors individual-centered, the type of constructs that individual models of\nbehavioral change (which explicitly incorporate perceived risk) focus on? Or are they\nsocial and environmental, the type of constructs that social models of risk behavior\nargue matter most? I cannot definitively answer the question, \"What causes perceived\nrisk?\" since mine is a cross-sectional study. But I can explore correlates of perceived\nrisk, proxied through worry. As such, I ask two related questions: what factors are\nassociated with worry about HIV/AIDS, and are they predominantly individual or social\nin nature?\nrural villagers in three areas of Malawi. In this population, worry is a good proxy for\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n282 http://www.demographic-research.org\nperceived risk of HIV infection (Note 2). As Figure 1 shows, in Malawi in 2001,\ncurrent, future, and cumulative risk (defined as the maximum level of reported current\nor future risk) were strong predictors of worry about HIV/AIDS; respondents who\nbelieved that they were already infected or would become infected with HIV/AIDS\nworried more than did respondents who reported that their risk of infection was\nnegligible. The correlations for men between worry and current and future risk were\nrespectively.\nNone Low Medium High DK\nPerceived risk\nWorry\nWomen Now\nWomen Future\nMen Now\nMen Future\nFigure 1: Effect of Perceived Current and Future Risk of HIV Infection on Worry\nNote:\nWorry ranges from 1 (not worried) to 3 (very worried).\nI chose to focus in this analysis on worry rather than perceived risk for four reasons.\nFirst, the data set I use includes two rounds of data on worry but only one on perceived\nrisk. Since my ultimate goal is to contribute to theory building, it is advantageous for\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 283\nme to be able to argue that the relationships I document are at least nominally enduring\nfor the population I am studying. This would not be possible were I to have only one\nwave of data.\nSecond, worry, like perceived risk, has been linked theoretically and empirically to\nbehavioral change. For example, the Fear Drive Model of behavioral change argues\nthat fear causes discomfort, which in turn motivates behavioral change in order to\nalleviate the discomfort. The Dual Process Model (Leventhal 1971, Leventhal, Safer,\nand Panagis 1983) states that when a person feels at risk of an undesirable outcome, he\nexperiences fear, which produces discomfort. He can alleviate the discomfort either by\nmanaging the emotion or by eliminating the danger that produces it. The title of the\nmodel refers to the two components operating in parallel: fear control, or control of\none's emotions, and danger control, or as applied to HIV/AIDS, behavioral change.\nAccording to the Fear Reduction Model (Rosenbaum and Heath 1990), information\nabout a potential threat produces a subjective feeling of risk, which in turn produces\nfear and concern regarding the severity of the potential outcome. Fear and concern\nmotivate behavioral change. Lastly, the Virus of Fear Model (Ostrow 1990), which\ndraws an analogy between the process by which fear and contagion spread, asserts that\nmedia-induced fear leads either to positive change or to panic, paralyzation, and\nfeelings of fatalism and hopelessness. Bunnell (1996) points out that in areas with high\nHIV/AIDS prevalence and limited media penetration, the \"fear environment\" that\nresults from watching friends and family die from AIDS is probably a more potent\n\"transmitting agent\" of fear than is the media.\nThird, individual models typically emphasize intentions as an important precursor\nto behavioral change, and some argue that emotions play an important role in their\ndetermination. In fact, models that lack an emotive element have been criticized for\nfailing to explicitly consider the emotional arousal implicit in perceiving that one is at\nrisk of experiencing a negative outcome (Bunnell 1996). In the population I am\nstudying, worry is closely related to perceived risk. Yet worry adds an emotive\ncomponent that perceived risk lacks, which may render it a better predictor of\nbehavioral change. Lastly, some researchers have questioned the assumption implicit in\nindividual models that people perceive their risk accurately. Because worry is\nuniversally experienced and more emotionally based than perceived risk, respondents\nmay have less difficultly understanding the concept of worry and articulating their\nlevels of worry than describing their perceived risk. For the same reasons, worry may\nalso be less prone to translation error (Note 3).\nIn order to determine what factors contribute to rural Malawians' worry about\ncontracting HIV/AIDS, I constructed a series of ordered categories logistic regression\nmodels in which I regress respondents' levels of worry on a number of individual and\nsocial factors. What these regressions say overall is that a person's worry about\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n284 http://www.demographic-research.org\ncontracting HIV/AIDS is little influenced by his own characteristics or behaviors.\nWhat does make a difference is the behavior and worries of other people in his life.\nWhether someone believes her spouse to be unfaithful or not matters. But even more\nstrongly associated with how much a respondent worries is how much people with\nwhom he converses about HIV/AIDS worry. The overall message of this analysis is\nthat social factors are important predictors of worry. Consequently, the assumption\nimplicit in conventional models of health behavior, that individual factors are the\nprimary determinants of perceived risk, is unsupported in this sample of rural\nMalawians.\nMost HIV/AIDS interventions consist of attempts to promote behavioral change,\neither by educating or providing skills training (UNAIDS 1999, Bunnell 1996). The\noverall results of these efforts have been disappointing (Bunnell 1996). Some\nresearchers have attributed the lackluster performance of prevention programs to\ninadequacies in our collective understanding of the process of behavioral change and\nhow it varies across contexts. As the authors of a UNAIDS study observed, \"most\nbehavioral models measure risk as individually determined which might not be relevant\nin many contexts\" (UNAIDS 1999:11). By investigating whether perceived risk is\ninfluenced by factors other than those postulated by individual models to matter, this\nstudy sheds light on the behavioral change process and its contextual variations. On a\ntheoretical level, it broadens understanding of how behavioral change models and risk\nperception theory can be applied to non-Western contexts. On a practical level, it\ninforms strategies for HIV/AIDS prevention, providing information relevant to the\ndesign of effective interventions in Malawi and other high prevalence areas.\n2. Data & methods\nThe data that I use for this study comes from the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational\nChange Project (MDICP). Survey data were collected during the summers of 1998 and\n2001 in three rural districts of Malawi: Rumphi District, located in the northern part of\nthe country, Balaka District, in the south, and Mchinji District, in the central region.\nExtensive qualitative data also were collected as part of several smaller projects\nassociated with the MDICP. The first round of survey data consists of interviews with\ncurrently married women. In the second round of data collection, these same\nrespondents and any new spouses were interviewed. Response rates for both waves\nwere high. In 1998, only 1.7% of men and 1.0% of women refused to be interviewed.\nIn 2001, the corresponding figures were equally low: 1.8% and 0.8%, respectively. In\nregards to attrition, 16% of males interviewed in the first wave were lost to follow-up.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 285\nEleven percent of those died between surveys, and 0.5% were hospitalized or too ill to\nbe re-interviewed. Nineteen percent of the original female sample was lost to follow-\nup; 14% of women not re-interviewed died between surveys, and 1.4% were ill or in the\nhospital. The sample is described in greater detail in Watkins et al. (2003). More\ninformation is also available at www.pop.upenn.edu/Social_Networks.\nThe questions that I seek to answer in this study are, what determines how much a\nperson worries about contracting HIV/AIDS, and are the predominant factors those that\nthe prevailing models of health behaviors would suggest, or are there other factors that\nhave a greater impact on the \"average\" Malawian's level of concern? To answer these\nrelated questions, I constructed a series of cumulative logit models for ordered\ncategories analysis. The dependent variable was the respondent's answer to the\nquestion, \"How worried are you that you might catch AIDS?\" Possible answers were\n\"Not worried at all,\" \"Worried a little,\" \"Worried a lot,\" and \"Don't know.\" In the field,\ngreat care was taken by the interviewing team to ensure that the question was translated\ncorrectly and consistently. In my analysis, I discarded all cases (2 men, 12 women) in\nwhich the respondent answered, \"Don't know.\"\nThe underlying construct, worry, is in theory continuous, but for the purposes of\nthis study, it is measured in discrete categories that range from low to high. Because\nthe distance between categories is not fixed, appropriate methods for analysis need to\naccount for the potentially variable distance between categories. Ordered logit\nregression, which is also known as cumulative logit regression, is well suited to this\ntask. In an ordered logit regression, the dependent variable consists of J ordered\ncategories, represented by the integers 1,2,...,J. The jth cumulative odds is the\nprobability of giving a response in category j or lower, as opposed to giving a response\nin the category j+1 or higher. The log of this odds, the Jth cumulative logit, can be\nmodeled as a linear function (Allison 1999).\nI selected my independent variables based on what the literature, models of health\nbehavior, and qualitative work associated with the MDICP survey suggested might\nimpact respondent worry about HIV/AIDS. For a detailed listing of the variables\nanalyzed, see Table 2. Empty cells in the table correspond to questions that were not\nasked for that particular sex and wave. The variables of interest were divided into two\ngroups, individual and social, according to the underlying constructs they measure.\nIndividual factors tested consist of behaviors, knowledge and beliefs, and proxies for\noutcome expectations. Social factors tested consist of perceptions of spouses' behavior,\ncharacteristics of respondents' HIV/AIDS conversational networks, and community\nmarkers. Since I lack adequate measures for capturing every salient component of any\ngiven behavioral change model or theory, the purpose of this analysis is not so much to\nrefute the validity of a class of models as to argue for the importance of factors\nneglected by that class.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n286 http://www.demographic-research.org\nI restricted the analysis to respondents interviewed in both waves and with no\nmissing data for the variables of interest. I also excluded respondents who reported\nhaving discussed AIDS with no one (74 men, 221 women) or who did not know how\nworried at least one of their conversational network partners was (14 men, 17 women),\nyielding a total of 878 women and 660 men. Analyzing males and females separately, I\nconducted bivariate tests of association with worry for each variable in each wave. To\ndetermine which relationships were significant after controlling for other relevant\nfactors, I combined the variables that were significant in the bivariate models in a series\nof nested multivariate models. To qualify for inclusion, a variable had to be\nlongitudinal and at least marginally significant for either sex in either wave. Data were\ncollected in 145 villages in the first wave and 152 villages in the second wave. To\nadjust for the possibility that observations were not independent within villages, I used\nthe Huber/White/sandwich estimator of variance method to calculate robust standard\nerrors in all models. I also used likelihood ratio tests to confirm that models with social\nvariables provided a significantly better fit to the data than did models without them.\nThe prevalence of HIV infection in Malawi ranks among the highest in the world.\nAt the end of 1999, an estimated 16% of adults were sero-positive (UNAIDS/WHO\n2000). According to government estimates based on sentinel surveillance data from\nantenatal clinics, 17% of pregnant women in Mchinji were HIV positive in 1998. In\nRumphi, the figure was 12.5%, and in Balaka, it was 14.9% (National AIDS Control\nProgramme 1998). Despite the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Malawi, few people get\ntested for HIV. For the purposes of this analysis, I assume that most people do not know\ntheir HIV status. I also assume that those who do know or suspect that they have\nHIV/AIDS will report that they are more rather than less worried about contracting the\ndisease. Given the afore-mentioned positive association between believing that you\nalready have AIDS and reporting that you are worried about contracting it, this seems a\nsafe assumption.\n2.1. Individual factors\nBehaviors. Two basic tenets in the theoretical and empirical literature on behavioral\nchange are that high perceived risk prompts the adoption of protective behaviors, and\npositive behavioral change in turn reduces perceived risk (Weinstein and Nicolich 1993,\nBunnell 1996). The reciprocity of this relationship points to the need for establishing\nsequential ordering when analyzing associations between perceived risk and behavioral\nchange. The MDICP contains no direct measure of behavioral change in response to\nHIV/AIDS and only one indirect measure, previous experience with condoms.\nUnfortunately, this variable lacks a time referent, which opens up its analysis to the\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 287\nproblem of reverse causation. But because unprotected sex is a major HIV risk factor\nand consistent condom use a widely promoted strategy for avoiding HIV/AIDS, I\ndecided to look at it regardless.\nI looked at the effects of two behavioral constructs on respondent worry: previous\nexperience with condoms and having engaged in extramarital sex. For the former, I\nused a variable constructed from questions regarding past condom use as a form of\ncontraception and with premarital and extramarital partners (Note 4). To measure\nextramarital sexual activity, I used two indirect and one direct measure, answers to the\nquestion, \"Have you yourself slept with anyone other than your husband/wife in the last\n12 months\" (Note 5). The indirect measures that I used were answers to two questions\nregarding time spent away from home. The first question asked whether the respondent\nhad spent more than one month of the past year away. The second asked whether the\nrespondent (if male) or her husband (if the respondent was female) usually \"stays\" in\nhis wife's village. Qualitative accounts suggest that men and women regard extended\nspousal separations as opportunities for both spouses to stray, and an extensive\nliterature has argued that by separating husbands and wives for lengthy periods of time,\nlabor migration promotes extramarital sexual activity, thereby contributing to the spread\nof HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa (Packard and Epstein 1991, Aggleton et al. 1994,\nKnowledge/beliefs. Individual models of health behavior regard knowledge and\nbeliefs as important predictors of behavioral change (Bunnell 1996). Past research has\nfound that HIV/AIDS-related knowledge is significantly related to AIDS-related worry\n(Klepinger et al. 1993), perceived risk (London and Robles 2000), and behavioral\nchange (Gregson et al. 1998). I test whether worry is related to four indicators of\nknowledge about HIV/AIDS. The first variable indicates respondents' awareness that\neven people who appear healthy may be HIV positive. The second measures beliefs\nregarding the infectiousness of HIV (Note 6). The third variable, answers to the\nquestion, \"If a person gets very thin and dies, what disease do you think probably killed\nthem?\", indicates an awareness of the presence of HIV/AIDS in the community and a\nwillingness to attribute local deaths to the disease.\nOne factor explicitly considered by individual models to affect behavioral change\nis exposure to information about a potential threat. Previous research documented a\npositive relationship between exposure to HIV/AIDS information and both worry\n(Klepinger et al. 1993, Gregson et al. 1998) and perceived risk (London and Robles\n2000). The final variable in the series is therefore a measure of exposure to HIV/AIDS\ninformation from \"expert\" (as opposed to lay) sources. Values range from zero (having\nhad no exposure) to three (having received information from a community-based health\nofficer, a hospital or clinic, and via the radio).\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n288 http://www.demographic-research.org\nOutcome Expectations. Individual theories emphasize that before people will be\nmotivated to avoid behaviors that put them at risk of acquiring an illness, they must first\nbelieve that having that illness is both undesirable and avoidable. Two variables--\nnumber of funerals attended in the past month and number of acquaintances suspected\nto have died of HIV/AIDS--indirectly measure respondents' beliefs in the severity of\nHIV/AIDS and the threat it poses. They also serve as rough proxies for perceived\nprevalence of death due to AIDS (Note 7).\nSpouse. Individual models of HIV/AIDS-related behavioral change have been\ncriticized for giving inadequate attention to the role of spouses in facilitating or\nimpeding change (Denison 1996). In my sample of ever-married women and their\nhusbands, the behavior of current and ex-spouses constitutes a major source of past or\ncurrent HIV risk. The first variable in this series is therefore marital status. I include\nthe full four-category version of this variable in Table 2 for interest only, as most of the\ncategories have too few cases to allow for analyzing them separately. I distinguish\nbetween monogamous and polygynous unions in the operational version of this variable\nbecause polygyny has been shown by other studies to be positively associated with\nperceived risk of HIV infection (Bunnell 1996). The second variable in the series is\nrespondents' perceptions of their spouses' fidelity. Respondents were asked whether\nthey know or suspect that their spouse has had extramarital sex during the course of\ntheir marriage. Possible answers were \"Yes\" or \"Suspect,\" \"Don't know\" or \"Can't\nknow what (s)he does,\" and \"Probably not.\" Respondents who answered \"Probably\nnot\" but reported elsewhere in the survey that their greatest risk of HIV/AIDS infection\ncomes from their spouse were recoded \"Can't/Don't know.\" The third variable in this\nseries is answers to a question regarding the acceptability of using a condom with a\nspouse.\nSocial models emphasize that social and cultural factors must be considered when\naccounting for behavioral change or lack thereof. One factor frequently blamed for the\nspread of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa and the unusually high percentage of\nwomen that are infected is women's inferior position relative to men (Caldwell,\nargument is that a multitude of factors forces women to \"submit to their partner's [sic]\ndemands for sex\" (Watts et al. 1998), impeding their ability to protect themselves\nagainst HIV infection. Foremost among these factors is women's financial dependence\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 289\non their sexual partners due to limited economic opportunities for women. In its\nextreme form, this dependence drives women into prostitution (Caldwell and Caldwell\n1993, Quinn 1994). In its milder form, it reduces their ability to leave unfaithful lovers\nor husbands and to insist on condom use during sex with risky partners (Aggleton et al.\n1994). The fourth variable in this series is therefore whether or not the respondent\nherself reports earning money, either in cash or kind. If it is the case that, by\neliminating their ability to deny sex, women's financial dependence on their sexual\npartners increases their risk of contracting HIV/AIDS, then women with no independent\nincome should worry more about HIV/AIDS than should women with independent\nincome (Note 8). In support of this hypothesis, research in Zimbabwe (Watts et al.\n1998) found that women with earnings worry less about HIV/AIDS than do women\nwithout earnings. Conversely, if men use cash or financial clout to effectively\n\"purchase\" sex--or at least, control over sex--then men with no independent income,\nbecause their access to payment and influence is reduced, might worry less about\nHIV/AIDS. Since previous research (Garnet and Anderson 1993) has suggested that\nthe tradition in sub-Saharan Africa of women marrying substantially older men has\ncontributed to the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS in the region, the final variable in this\nseries is respondents' reports of the difference between their and their current or most\nrecent spouse's age.\nAIDS Conversational Networks. A central tenet of social theories of health\nbehavior is that social norms and relationships have a profound influence on people's\nunderstandings of social phenomena and their motivations to change. According to this\nview, the opinions and actions of those with whom a rural Malawian discusses\nHIV/AIDS will play a significant role in shaping her own opinions and actions. The\nvariables concerning respondents' HIV/AIDS conversational networks assess the\nmagnitude of that influence in regards to worry about HIV/AIDS. Respondents were\nasked with how many people they had chatted about HIV/AIDS; their answers\nconstitute the first variable in the series. They were then asked a number of HIV/AIDS-\nrelated questions regarding up to four of these conversational, or network, partners.\nThe second variable is the number of network partners reported on (maximum of four).\nThe third variable indicates having a least one network partner who is moderately or\nvery worried about HIV/AIDS. The fourth variable is the number of network partners\nwho are moderately or very worried about HIV/AIDS. The final variable in the series is\nthe average level of worry of one's network partners. Ranging from 1 (not worried) to 3\n(very worried), it was constructed by summing the worry of each network partner and\ndividing the total by the number of partners (Note 9). To determine whether the\ninfluence on respondent worry of network-partner worry depends on the size of\nrespondents' networks, I tested for an interaction between the two variables; when the\ninteraction term was significant in the bivariate models, it was retained in the\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n290 http://www.demographic-research.org\nmultivariate models. Because the network variables were highly collinear, I included only\nnumber of network partners and average partner worry in the multivariate models.\nCommunity Markers. Social theories emphasize the importance of environment\nand social context in facilitating or impeding behavioral change. I include the final set\nof variables, community markers, as indictors of extended social networks and cultural\nor social environments that might impact respondents' experiences with HIV/AIDS.\nSome of the variables denote membership in cultural groupings (e.g., religious\naffiliation and ethnicity). Others, like region of residence, more abstractly assume that\npeople living in close proximity share similar cultural ideologies and social structures\n(e.g., political, legal, and economic ideologies and structures) that shape their responses\nto HIV/AIDS. The first variable in this series is religious affiliation. This variable was\ncoded differently in each wave, so to make the waves comparable, I combined the\ncategories \"Protestant,\" \"Revivalist,\" and \"Traditional.\" The second variable, answers\nto a question regarding the last time the respondent attended a religious service,\nmeasures religiosity. The last two variables in this series are ethnic identification and\nregion of residence.\n2.3. Demographic control variables\nI control for age, education (specifically, the highest level of schooling attended), and\nhousehold wealth in the multivariate models. The wealth index, which ranges from 0\n(poor) to 13.7 (rich), is a relative measure constructed by summing the number of\nhousehold items a respondent owns, weighted by the likelihood of owning each item in\nthe survey population. The possessions considered were a bed, sofa, lantern, bicycle,\nmetal roof, plough, and pit latrine.\nI include education as a control variable because it has been shown to be\nassociated in sub-Saharan Africa with both fear (Ntozi and Kirunga 1997) and actual\nrisk (Dodoo and Ampofo 1998) of contracting HIV/AIDS. Research has shown that\nover the last decade, highly educated people responded to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by\naltering their AIDS-related behaviors to a greater extent than did less educated people\n1990s, risk of infection was positively associated with education, by the end of the\ndecade, the relationship had reversed (UNAIDS/WHO 2000). I control for age because\nit, too, has been found to be associated with worry about HIV/AIDS (Ntozi and Kirunga\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 291\nTable 1: Worry and Perceived Risk, Frequencies and Relationships with Worry,\nFrequencies Relationship w/ worry1\nWomen Men Women Men\nWorried about getting AIDS abcd\nCumulative risk of acquiring AIDS b ** **\nLikelihood that already infected bx ** **\nIf current likelihood not high,\nlikelihood of future infection2 b\n** **\nNotes:\nOverall significance of polytomous categorical variables indicated in first line of variable results.\n+ significant at p<10%; * significant at p<5%; ** significant at p<1%.\n1 Results of ordered logistic regressions with worry.

In 1998, approximately\nthree-quarters of respondents reported that they worry about AIDS, although by 2001,\nthe proportion had declined to two-thirds. Worry declined over time for both sexes,\nalthough in both waves, women were more likely than men to report being worried.\nWomen also were more likely to report that they already have HIV/AIDS or will\neventually contract it.

The literature on HIV/AIDS in\nAfrica resounds with descriptions of the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS and people's\nunwillingness to publicly entertain the possibility of their having it. The MDICP data\ndo not support this view, as evident in the nontrivial percentage of respondents who\nreport that the likelihood that they are currently infected is high.\n3.1. Univariate and bivariate results\nThe results of the univariate and bivariate analyses are presented in Table 2.

The percentage of respondents that report having had\nextramarital sex did not change significantly from one wave to the next. Men's greater\nreporting of infidelity is consistent with the literature's contention that in sub-Saharan\nAfrica, men are the more promiscuous sex (e.g., McGrath et al. 1993, Ray, Gumbo, and\nMbizvo 1996). However, given the illicit nature of infidelity, both men and women\nlikely underreported their extramarital sexual activity. As evidence of this possibility,\non average 2.5% of female and 10.5% of male respondents report having engaged in\nextramarital sex in the past year, but a comparatively whopping 18% and 26%,\nrespectively, say their best friends have. The large discrepancy between these two sets\nof figures casts doubt on the veracity of respondents' reporting of sexual partnerships,\nespecially their own.\nBasic knowledge about HIV/AIDS, as indicated by the question about knowing a\nperson's sero-status from her appearance, is high and perhaps saturated given the lack of\nchange from one wave to the next. People are aware of the presence of HIV/AIDS in\ntheir community, as indicated by the preponderance that attribute thinness followed by\ndeath to HIV/AIDS. A majority of both men and women mistakenly believe that a\nsingle act of unprotected sex with an infected person is certain to give you HIV.\nReporting that sex once with an infected person is not guaranteed to give you HIV is\npositively associated with worrying about HIV/AIDS for men, negatively associated for\nwomen. Respondents have attended a large number of funerals in the past month, but\nthe specific number is irrelevant to how much they worry about HIV/AIDS. Given that\non average, the number of funerals attended in the past month barely differs from the\nlifetime number of acquaintances whom respondents suspect died of AIDS, a possible\nexplanation is that most deaths are not attributed to AIDS.\nSocial factors. Over half of women are older or approximately the same age as\ntheir husbands, although the magnitude of the difference in spouses'ages is not related\nto worry about HIV/AIDS for either sex. A large proportion of women earn an income,\nbut earning an income is not associated with worry. Most respondents are married, and\nthe percent married changes little from one wave to the next. However, this aggregate\nstasis disguises more extensive marital change at the individual level. Based on\nretrospective marital histories collected in 2001 and cross-checked against 1998 data,\n14% of women and 18% of men experienced at least one marital dissolution or creation\nbetween waves. The number of times respondents have been married is significantly\nrelated to their worry about HIV/AIDS. Fewer men than women suspect their spouses\nof infidelity. However, the difference may partially be due to differential reporting, as\nmen may feel greater pressure to say that their wives are faithful (Note 10). Approval\nof using condoms with a spouse doubled between waves for both sexes.\nThe mean number of people rural Malawians report chatting with about HIV/AIDS\nincreased over time, suggesting that HIV/AIDS is still very much a topic of\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n296 http://www.demographic-research.org\nconversation. Men report having spoken with slightly more people about HIV/AIDS\nthan women, and they have slightly more network partners in the first wave. The\nnumber of network partners total that a person has does not significantly impact his\nworry, but the number that are worried do. Similarly, if none of a respondent's\nconversational partners worry about HIV/AIDS, then she, too, is less likely to worry.\nAlthough women worry more about HIV/AIDS than do men, the two sexes' network\npartners worry about the same amount according to the various measures. Just as\nrespondent worry declined for both men and women over time, so too did network-\npartner worry despite an overall increase in the number of partners in respondents'\nconversational networks.\nCommunity markers serve as indicators of extended social networks, as well as\nsocial environments that might impact experiences with HIV/AIDS. Men report being\nslightly more religious than women, as measured by their attendance at religious\nservices. However, religiosity does not appear to be strongly associated with worry.\nWhat relationship does exist suggests that women who are highly religious worry less\nabout HIV/AIDS.\n3.2. Multivariate results\nThe results of the multivariate models are presented in Tables 3 through 6. Each\nmultivariate model consists of four regressions. The first is worry on individual factors\nand controls only. The second is worry on individual factors, controls, and social\nvariables minus the network variables and region of residence. The third is worry on\nindividual factors and controls, plus all social variables except region. The final model\ndiffers from the third in its inclusion of region. I split up the models with social\nvariables in this fashion in order to distinguish between the effects of social networks\nand region on the other variables in the model. In the tables, the overall significance of\npolytomous categorical variables--tests of the null hypothesis that all the dummy\ncoefficients are equal to zero--is indicated in the first line of variable results.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 297\nTable 3: Multivariate Model, Ordered Logistic Regression of Worry on Individual\nand Social Variables, Odds Ratios, Women, 1998\nIndividual\nfactors &\ncontrols\n+ Social\nfactors\n+ Network\nvariables\n+ Region\n# suspected to have died of AIDS + NS NS NS\nEducation ** NS NS NS\nNone - - - -\nMarital status NS NS NS\nMonogamous union - - -\nOpinion of fidelity of spouse ** ** **\nProbably faithful - - -\nReligion ** NS NS\nProtestant/Revivalist/Traditional - - -\nTribe ** ** NS\nChewa - - -\nRegion *\nCenter (Mchinji) -\nNotes:\nRobust standard errors used to calculate p-values.\nOverall significance of polytomous categorical variables indicated in first line of variable results, with \"NS\" signifying \"not significant.\"\n+ significant at p<10%; * significant at p<5%; ** significant at p<1%.\nItalics indicate an interaction.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n298 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 4: Multivariate Model, Ordered Logistic Regression of Worry on Individual\nand Social Variables, Odds Ratios, Women, 2001\nIndividual\nfactors &\ncontrols\n+ Social\nfactors\n+ Network\nvariables\n+ Region\n# suspected to have died of AIDS NS NS NS +\nEducation NS NS NS NS\nNone - - - -\nMarital status ** ** **\nMonogamous union - - -\nOpinion of fidelity of spouse ** ** **\nProbably faithful - - -\nReligion NS + NS\nProtestant/Revivalist/Traditional - - -\nTribe ** ** NS\nChewa - - -\nRegion NS\nCenter (Mchinji) -\nNotes:\nRobust standard errors used to calculate p-values.\nOverall significance of polytomous categorical variables indicated in first line of variable results, with \"NS\" signifying \"not significant.\"\n+ significant at p<10%; * significant at p<5%; ** significant at p<1%.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 299\nTable 5: Multivariate Model, Ordered Logistic Regression of Worry on Individual\nand Social Variables, Odds Ratios, Men, 1998\nIndividual\nfactors &\ncontrols\n+ Social\nfactors\n+ Network\nvariables\n+ Region\n# suspected to have died of AIDS * NS * NS\nEducation ** NS NS NS\nNone - - - -\nMarital status NS NS NS\nMonogamous union - - -\nOpinion of fidelity of spouse * ** **\nProbably faithful - - -\nReligion * NS NS\nProtestant/Revivalist/Traditional - - -\nTribe ** ** *\nChewa - - -\nRegion NS\nCenter (Mchinji) -\nNotes:\nRobust standard errors used to calculate p-values.\nOverall significance of polytomous categorical variables indicated in first line of variable results, with \"NS\" signifying \"not significant.\"\n+ significant at p<10%; * significant at p<5%; ** significant at p<1%.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n300 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 6: Multivariate Model, Ordered Logistic Regression of Worry on Individual\nand Social Variables, Odds Ratios, Men, 2001\nIndividual\nfactors &\ncontrols\n+ Social\nfactors\n+ Network\nvariables\n+ Region\n# suspected to have died of AIDS NS NS NS NS\nEducation NS NS NS NS\nNone - - - -\nMarital status NS * *\nMonogamous union - - -\nOpinion of fidelity of spouse ** NS +\nProbably faithful - - -\nReligion NS NS NS\nProtestant/Revivalist/Traditional - - -\nTribe ** ** NS\nChewa - - -\nRegion *\nCenter (Mchinji) -\nNotes:\nRobust standard errors used to calculate p-values.\nOverall significance of polytomous categorical variables indicated in first line of variable results, with \"NS\" signifying \"not significant.\"\n+ significant at p<10%; * significant at p<5%; ** significant at p<1%.\nItalics indicate an interaction.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 301\nLooking at the results for the first set of models, which have only individual and\ncontrol variables, we see that certain individual factors are significantly related to\nworry. The following variables are significant in at least one model: having engaged in\nextramarital sex, having used condoms, where the husband usually stays, receiving\ninformation about HIV/AIDS from multiple sources, the number of acquaintances that\ndied of AIDS, age, education, and wealth. To highlight a few of these relationships, in\nsome of the models, respondents who report having had extramarital sex in the past\nyear worry more about HIV/AIDS. The relationship between condom use and worry is\npositive, suggesting that worry prompts condom use rather than the reverse, as the\nmodel specifies. Knowing that you cannot tell someone's sero-status by their\nappearance decreases worry, but having been exposed to information about HIV/AIDS\nfrom multiple sources increases it. For men in 1998, knowing many people who died of\nAIDS is associated with reduced rather than increased levels of worry, an unexpected\nfinding replicated by a Ugandan study that found that if a person knew more than 15\nsuspected AIDS victims, he was more likely than if he knew fewer to say that he was\ncertain he was HIV negative (Ntozi and Kirunga 1997). For men, age is positively\nassociated with worry (Note 11). Education is negatively associated with men's worry,\nbut positively associated with women's.\nWhen the social variables minus the network variables and region are added to the\nmodels, a number of individual variables cease being significant. Education ceases to\nbe significant in any model, as does condom use, the number suspected to have died of\nAIDS, the wealth index, and knowing that a healthy-looking person can have AIDS.\nNonetheless, a few of the individual variables continue to be significant in some\nmodels, and the overall pattern remains largely intact; specifically, behavior, as\nindicated by having recently engaged in extramarital sex, and knowledge, as measured\nby exposure to different sources of \"expert\" information about HIV/AIDS, are still\nsignificantly related to respondent worry. In regards to social variables, especially for\nwomen, being in a polygynous marriage and suspecting your spouse of infidelity are\nassociated with increased worry about HIV/AIDS. Research in Zimbabwe found that\ndivorced and separated women were more likely than currently married women to feel\nat risk for contracting HIV/AIDS (Gregson et al. 1998), yet I find no consistent\ndifferences between monogamously married and single respondents. Ethnicity is\nsignificant in all of the models, and religious affiliation is significant in half.\nSpecifically, Catholics are not significantly different from Protestants, Revivalists, and\nadherents to traditional religions, and Muslims worry more about HIV/AIDS than do\nChristians.\nAdding the network-partner variables to the models has a mixed effect on the\nsignificance of the individual variables. Whereas the information variable drops out of\ntwo of the four models in which it was previously significant, condom use and where\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n302 http://www.demographic-research.org\nthe husband usually stays become newly significant in two models. The extramarital\nsex variable appears to have the most tenacious effect on worry of any individual\nvariable. Broadly speaking, the previously significant variables regarding one's spouse\nremain significant, as do ethnicity and region in some models. That the other\nsignificant variables remain largely unaffected suggests that while networks have a\nlarge, significant effect on worry, that effect is largely independent of the effects of the\nother variables in the models. In regards to the network effects themselves, as depicted\nbetween respondent worry and the average level of worry in a respondent's network\ndepends on the number of people in that network. Specifically, the more numerous the\npartners, the more closely the respondent's worry resembles that of his network\npartners.\nAverage network-partner worry\nRespondent worry\nFigure 2: Effect of Number of Network Partners and Average Network-partner\nWorry on Respondent Worry about HIV/AIDS, Women, 1998\nNote:\nWorry ranges from 1 (not worried) to 3 (very worried).\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 303\nAverage network-partner worry\nRespondent worry\nFigure 3: Effect of Number of Network Partners and Average Network-partner\nWorry on Respondent Worry about HIV/AIDS, Men, 2001\nNote:\nWorry ranges from 1 (not worried) to 3 (very worried).\nRegion of residence is highly correlated with ethnicity, and to a lesser extent, religious\naffiliation. Consequently, when we add region to the models, the biggest change is that\nethnicity ceases to be significant in three of the four models. The individual variable,\nwhere the husband usually stays, becomes insignificant in the two models in which it\nwas previously marginally significant. The network coefficients change little, however,\nsuggesting that regional differences do not account for networks' strong effects on\nworry. The relationship between region and worry is curiously inconsistent across time\nand sex. Part of the explanation is divergent changes in regional levels of average\nworry from one wave to the next. As illustrated in Table 7, while worry in Balaka\ndropped precipitously for both sexes between 1998 and 2001, changes in worry in the\nother two regions were smaller and inconsistent across sexes. Once we control for\nsocial variables with which it is correlated, region has little explanatory power, as\nindicated by the minimal increases in the pseudo R2 values when we add it to the\nmodels.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n304 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 7: Change in Average Level of Worry about HIV/AIDS by Region, Women\nNote:\nWorry ranges from 1 (not worried) to 3 (very worried).\nThe most notable finding to emerge from the multivariate models containing all the\nvariables, both individual and social, is the strong impact of network worry on\nrespondent worry. Not only is the significance across all four models remarkable, so,\ntoo, are the large magnitudes of the effects. For example, according to the men's 1998\nmodel, increasing average worry from not worried to moderately worried or from\nmoderately worried to very worried increases by a factor of six the odds that a\nrespondent is in a higher category of worry. Suspecting your spouse of infidelity also\nstands out for its large and robust impact on respondent worry. Compared to\nrespondents who report that their spouses are probably faithful, those who suspect or\nknow of infidelity are between 2.7 and 3.1 times (depending on the model) more likely\nto be in a higher category of worry. Respondents who \"can't\" or \"don't\" know if their\nspouses are faithful or who report that their spouses pose the greatest threat for\ntransmitting HIV are between 1.4 and 3 times more worried about HIV/AIDS. It is also\nworth noting that suspected infidelity has a greater effect on women's than men's worry\nabout HIV/AIDS, and more women than men doubt their spouses' fidelity.\nThe pseudo R2 statistic for ordered categories logistic regression is based on the\ndifference in the log-likelihoods for the fitted model and a model with no explanatory\nvariables (Allison 1999). While it cannot be interpreted as the proportion of variance\nexplained by the independent variables the way an OLS R2 can, it can be loosely\nregarded as a measure of the extent to which a model's explanatory variables account\nfor observed differences in the dependent variable. The R2 statistics for the models\nwith only individual variables and controls range from 0.01 to 0.05, suggesting that\nindividual variables matter little when predicting respondents' worry about HIV/AIDS.\nThe values for the models with social variables minus the network variables and region\nare at least three times as large as the R2 for the corresponding individual models. The\nR2 statistic for the full model with the lowest predictive value is almost four times the\nvalue for the individual model with the highest predictive value. Based on the\nsubstantially higher R2 statistics for the models with social variables and the finding\nthat when I control for social variables in the models, individual variables are no longer\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 305\nsignificant, I conclude that social factors have a greater influence on worry about\nHIV/AIDS than do the individual factors included in this analysis. Variables related to\none's spouse and network-partner worry have the greatest and most robust impact on\nrespondent worry.\n4. Discussion\nSince it was learned that HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa is transmitted mostly\nthrough heterosexual sex, researchers and interventionists have focused on individuals\nunder the assumption that, if Africans only had the necessary information and skills,\nthey would change their behaviors. In recent years, the focus has gradually shifted to\nother, more macro-level factors like gender power imbalances, network influences, and\npoverty. I contribute to the debate over whether this change in focus is appropriate by\nevaluating the relative importance of individual versus social factors in contributing to\nrural Malawians'worry about HIV/AIDS.\nThe overriding message that emerges from this analysis is that individual\ncharacteristics and reported behaviors matter far less in determining worry about\nHIV/AIDS than how much respondents' conversational partners worry and whether\nthey suspect their spouses of infidelity. This finding was remarkably consistent across\ntime and sex. People's concern rubs off on their friends such that, regardless of\nwhether or not a person is at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS, he is more likely to worry\nabout the disease if his friends are worried. Alternatively, we might suppose that, given\nthe uncertainty surrounding HIV/AIDS due to people's inability to tell if others--or\nthey, themselves--are infected, individuals look to those around them for clues as to\nhow they should feel and behave in the context of the epidemic. These clues may take\nthe form of information, or they may come by way of example. Yet the concerns of\nthose with whom a person regularly interacts are not the only factors that matter. Other\nsocial variables, including ethnicity, region, and variables concerning one's spouse,\nwere also significantly related to respondent worry about AIDS. The individual\nvariable that had the largest, most robust effect on worry is reported engagement in\nextramarital sex, which was positively associated with worry about HIV/AIDS. Yet\ncaution is called for in drawing conclusions from this finding, as it may be subject to\nresponse bias. Given the illicit nature of infidelity, it is likely that respondents\nunderreported their extramarital sex, as suggested by a study from Malawi that used\nbiomarkers to validate reports of sexual activity (Taha et al. 1996). Studies that used\ninformal, in-depth qualitative interviewing to investigate whether extramarital sex is\nunderreported in the MDICP survey similarly concluded that infidelity is underreported,\nalthough it is difficult to quantify to what extent (Tawfik 2003, Behrman et al. 2003).\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n306 http://www.demographic-research.org\nUnfortunately, it is impossible to know whether respondents who admitted to having\nextramarital sex are representative of the average person with extramarital partners.\nWhile these findings of large, robust effects of social variables on worry do not\ndirectly contradict the prevailing models of health behavior, which focus on individuals,\nthey do complicate them in interesting ways. According to a UNAIDS review of\ntheories of HIV/AIDS-related behavioral change, \"Models of individual behavioral\nchange... generally do not consider the interaction of social, cultural, and environmental\nissues as independent of individual factors\" (UNAIDS 1999:6). One of the factors these\ntheories do consider is perceived risk, which they treat as a determinant of behavior:\n\"Although each theory is built on different assumptions they all state that behavioral\nchanges occur by altering potential risk-producing situations and social relationships,\nrisk perceptions, attitudes, self-efficacy beliefs, intentions and outcome expectations\n[emphasis added]\" (UNAIDS 1999:6). Although the association between worry and\nperceived risk is imperfect, it is nonetheless strong. Consequently, my finding of a\nstrong social basis for worry calls into question these models' omission of a social\nelement. Other studies have similarly argued that theories of behavioral change that fail\nto consider network and peer effects are inadequate (e.g., Vandlandingham et al. 1995,\ntake into account the social underpinnings of worry.\nAnother interesting finding to emerge from this study is that worry declined between\n1998 and 2001 for both sexes. Evidence from rural Kenya has documented a similar\ndecline in that country (Watkins and Schatz 2001). The decline in worry evident in this\nstudy was not due to unobserved heterogeneity since the MDICP as analyzed is a\nlongitudinal sample, so the same people were interviewed in both waves. It also cannot\nbe attributed to an age effect, as what little association exists between worry and age is\npositive. That said, worry did not decline equally in all regions. In fact, women in the\ncentral region and men in the north became slightly more worried about HIV/AIDS\nover time. Additional research is needed to investigate why worry changed the way it\ndid in the different regions.\nAnother finding worth noting is that many of the variables that influence people's\nlevels of worry suggest a close correspondence between factors that epidemiologists\nbelieve put people at risk and factors that are locally deemed risky (e.g., engaging in\nextramarital sex, having an adulterous spouse). This correspondence may indicate that\nboth groups have independently picked up on the same real-world phenomena.\nHowever, it could also reflect the possibility that respondents have absorbed\neducational messages (e.g., unprotected sex is dangerous) disseminated by HIV/AIDS\nprevention programs. Either way, this finding suggests that, if HIV/AIDS continues to\nspread in Malawi, it is not for lack of awareness of the relevant risk factors. Additional\nsupport for this conclusion is weakly (because it concerns data from another country)\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 307\nprovided by a recent Ugandan study that found that determinants of perceived risk of\nHIV infection are also known risk factors for contracting HIV/AIDS. Moreover,\npatterns of sex-specific perceived risk mirror differences in actual sero-prevalence\nThere are a number of limitations to this study. First, I conclude that, since few of\nthe individual variables analyzed are significantly related to worry, and the models with\nindividual variables only have low R2s, individual factors must not be important\ndeterminants of worry about HIV/AIDS. However, strictly speaking, this would only\nbe the case if I had observations without measurement error for all the individual\nvariables of interest. Of course, I have neither: there are many potentially important\nindividual variables (e.g., risk aversion, tendency to discount the future) for which I\nhave no data, and other variables for which I do have information may be measured\npoorly. The cross-sectional nature of the data as analyzed exacerbates the problem\nbecause the effects of potentially endogenous variables such as condom use, which may\nboth affect and be affected by worry about infection, will be biased downwards.\nMoreover, even if social variables have as large an effect on worry as I suggest, the low\nR2s for the models with social variables mean that individual factors may as yet have a\nsizeable, albeit unobserved, effect on worry.\nOverall, it is important to emphasize that mine is not a direct test of the\ncomparative validity of the different types of models. Such an analysis is beyond the\nscope of this article because I lack data on many of the relevant factors. Rather, this is a\nmore general test of what constructs matters, and which matter more--individual,\ncognitive-behavioral factors, or social and environmental factors. The finding that\nsocial factors, and in particular, network factors predominate is less a negation of the\nvalidity of individual, psychosocial models than it is a demonstration of the importance\nof social and environmental factors operating independently of individual factors.\nAnother limitation of this study is that the generalizability of my findings to\nMalawi on the whole or to other populations in sub-Saharan Africa is questionable due\nto restrictions placed on the sample that render it potentially unrepresentative. These\ninclude limiting the original sample to ever-married women and their husbands,\ndropping respondents interviewed in one wave only, and dropping respondents who\nreported never having discussed AIDS with others or who were unable to report the\nlevel of worry of at least one conversant. While these restrictions may limit the\ngeneralizability of the conclusions to other populations within or outside Malawi,\nanalyses conducted by the author (not shown) and by Bignami-Van Assche et al. (2003)\nsuggest that they did not bias the results for the population studied.\nA third limitation stems from my decision to use worry as a proxy for perceived\nrisk. As noted, although they are similar, the two concepts are not identical. While the\nemotive component implicit in worry may be viewed as rendering it superior to\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n308 http://www.demographic-research.org\nperceived risk as a predictor of behavioral change, to the extent that predictors of worry\nare dissimilar from predictors of perceived risk as a result of this additional component,\nmy conclusions regarding perceived risk--the concept explicitly referred to in most\nindividual models of risk behavior--are invalid. For example, due to personality\ndifferences such as differential propensities for risk aversion, individuals with the same\nperceived risk of infection may express varying levels of worry about HIV/AIDS.\nDifferential exposure to other stressors or ability to manage stress may produce a\nsimilar effect. Unobservables such as these, which are related to worry but not\nperceived risk, may introduce bias not accounted for in the present analysis. While one\ncould argue that worry is interesting to investigate in its own right, this potential bias is\nproblematic for my conclusions regarding the salience of social factors in predicting\nbehavioral change within the framework of existing models of health behavior.\nThe final limitation has to do with the finding of strong network effects on\nrespondent worry. The network questions were designed to gage how worried are the\npeople with whom respondents discuss HIV/AIDS. If respondents projected their own\nconcerns onto their network partners rather than accurately reporting their partners'\nfeelings, they violated the basic premise of the exercise. Yet this is a real possibility,\nand to the extent that projected concern accounts for the observed association between\nrespondent worry and network-partner worry, the results are biased. A second potential\nproblem is that of network endogeneity: do people intentionally choose as network\npartners others who think or behave the way they do, or in this case, who worry about\nHIV/AIDS to the same extent that they do? Research on fertility networks indicates\nthat respondents typically choose network partners based on similarities across a\nmultitude of characteristics rather than just one (Warriner and Watkins 2000).\nNevertheless, network endogeneity stemming from selectivity and unobserved\nheterogeneity is still a troubling possibility.\nCaveats notwithstanding, an Australian study on the determinants of perceived risk\nfound similar evidence of strong network effects, concluding \"Perceived personal risk\nwas influenced most by perceived risk to friends and to people with the same sexual\npractices\" (Timmins et al. 1998). Providing further support, albeit indirect, numerous\nstudies in sub-Saharan Africa have documented the successes of peer-led intervention\nprograms (e.g., Mouli 1992, Williams and Ray 1993). My finding of a strong network\neffect on respondent worry may help account for these successes, as people who are\nworried about HIV/AIDS should be more willing to take precautions to protect\nthemselves against infection. Lastly, mounting evidence from the family planning\nliterature suggests that networks matter even after controlling for unobserved factors\nthat may influence both the selection of partners and the adoption of contraception,\nlending credence to the independent effects of networks on behaviors (e.g.,\nMontgomery, Casterline, and Heiland 2001, Behrman, Kohler, and Watkins 2002). An\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 9\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 309\nanalysis that used fixed effects and instrumental variables to control for the possibility\nof non-random selection similarly found that effects of networks on worry about AIDS\nare robust to these controls (Kohler, Behrman, and Watkins 2002).\nWhile the importance of social-structural variables to behavioral change has been\ndemonstrated by past research, comparatively little attention has been focused on\npredictors of a critical component of health behavior, perceived risk. I contribute to the\ndebate on the determinants of behavioral change by analyzing the relative importance of\nindividual versus social factors in accounting for levels of worry in a high-prevalence\npopulation in sub-Saharan Africa. As such, I find support for the increasingly popular\nnotion that social influence must be incorporated into our understanding of how and\nwhy people change their behavior in response to HIV/AIDS.\n5.
