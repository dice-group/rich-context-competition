Nevertheless, generalizability is limited\nby their firm-specific data and by a predominant\nemphasis on managerial workers. The question of\nhow much consensus regarding career timetables\nexists across features of the American work land-\nscape remains unanswered.\nThe present study addresses these issues. It draws\non national data for a comparative assessment of\nmobility-related age norms. Using data from the\nQuality of Employment Survey, which was designed\nto be representative of the U.S. working population,\nI investigated the existence of age norms for job\npromotions. Specifically, my aims were to see if\nthere are \"social timetables\" for future promotions,\nto examine the variability of these timetables across\nselected structural features of the working world\n(e.g., Calasanti, 1988), and finally to assess whether\nor not these timetables carry with them psychologi-\ncal consequences (e.g., Lawrence, 1984; Neugarten,\nBackground\nThe question of whether findings of perceived\ntimetables indicate the presence of age norms has\nbeen the subject of some debate.

A second,\n\"weaker\" version of age norms is found in Law-\ntionally based age norms as \"widely shared judg-\nments of the standard or typical ages of individuals\nholding each role or status.\" They constitute \"shared\nthus would be part of the symbolic world views of\norganizational workers.\nLawrence's formulation is akin to recent work\nwithin the study of culture, which has provided fresh\nand useful conceptualizations of cultural compo-\nstance, views culture as a \"'tool kit' of symbols,\nstories, rituals, and world views,\" and a similar ap-\nproach is used by Buchmann (1989), who draws upon\nBourdieu's theoretical framework to examine the\ntransition into adulthood. My investigation follows\ntheir approach, and hence uses this \"weaker\" con-\nceptualization. Accordingly, while it may well be true\nthat these norms are accompanied by sanctions, in\nthis perspective sanctions are not the defining condi-\ntion of norms.\nAnalytical Framework\nStudies have shown that shared judgments of typi-\ncal ages for holding particular organizational posi-\nnorms are generated by existing age distributions\namong positions. In turn, shifts in the distribution\nare likely to result in workers taking note and \"devel-\noping] age-based promotional expectations that fit\npectations refer to individual anticipations of upward\nmoves within an organization, while age-based pro-\nmotional expectations are those attached to particu-\nlar ages or an age range.\nThe present analysis explores the possibility of\nstudying age norms through individuals' expectations\nfor promotion, important life-course phenomena be-\ncause often \"subjective expectations of one's oppor-\ntunities in the future structure the individual's lines of\noperationalized here as age-related shared expecta-\ntions regarding when promotions should be re-\nceived. This definition allows for different ap-\nproaches in examining whether or not age norms\nexist. For instance, there may be age-related patterns\nfor the time-frame in which promotions are expected\n(e.g., expecting the next promotion in one year or 10\nyears). If all workers expect their next promotion\nwithin the same time period, then it would be difficult\nto speak of age norms in this sense. Such may be the\ncase given the emphasis on organizational mobility\n(e.g., Kanter, 1977, see ch. 6); employees want, and\nperhaps expect, promotions sooner rather than later.\nSuch attitudes suggest a near-term promotion expec-\ntation hypothesis. Thus:\nHypothesis 1: Workers, regardless of age, will ex-\npect a promotion within a relatively short time span.\nIf expected timing of promotion varies by age,\nhowever, then another hypothesis is suggested. Pat-\nterns surrounding expected age at next promotion\nmay emerge. If some age categories are identified as\nlikely times for promotion while others are not, it\nwould suggest the presence of age norms. Hence,\nmy second hypothesis is as follows:\nHypothesis 2: Promotions may be more antici-\npated in some age range(s) than in others.\nA second general issue addressed in this study is\npotential variation in age norms (Marini, 1984). A\nvariety of factors may differentiate age norms for\npromotional expectations. Industry, organization\nsize, and job categories are three structural features\nof the work world which prior work suggests as\npertinent (e.g., Dannefer, 1987; Kaufman & Spiler-\nbutions across the forementioned structural features\nmay give rise to diverse age-based promotional ex-\nnity for advancement extends further through the\nlife span, and, hence, is reflected in the age distribu-\ntion, then we will find older age norms for promo-\ntional expectations. It is beyond the scope of this\ninvestigation to offer detailed hypotheses for all\nthree structural features examined here, but in line\nwith the reasoning set forth above, the following\nhypothesis is proposed:\nHypothesis 3: Promotions may be more antici-\npated in later age ranges in large versus small\norganizations.\nPrior studies have suggested that if age norms\ncomprise a timetable against which people may mea-\nsure themselves, then such comparison may carry\npsychological consequences (Neugarten, 1979;\nNeugarten, Moore, & Lowe, 1968). While firm-\nspecific data reveal some evidence of this (e.g., Law-\nrence, 1984), it would be useful to examine the im-\npact of being \"off-time\" regarding one's promotion\nexpectations with data from a larger sample of work-\ners than has been used previously. Moreover, initial\nfindings (Lawrence, 1984) introduced limited con-\ntrols for other factors which may influence well-\nbeing. For instance, promotions (e.g., Rosenbaum,\n1984) and current job characteristics (e.g., Kalleberg,\n1977) are two work features thought to be linked to\npsychological outcomes. Hence, I compare the nor-\nmative factor of being off-time against these other,\n\"structural\" components (e.g., Hagestad, 1990) rela-\nthat the specific aging phenomenon of midlife psy-\nchosocial development -- a topic of increasing im-\nportance for aging researchers -- would be a useful\ntest case for this approach.\nBecause of my interest in the workplace, I exam-\nined selected facets of psychological well-being on\nthe job. Two heavily researched constructs relevant\nto descriptions of midlife (e.g., Farrell & Rosenberg,\n1981; Levinson, Darrow, Klein, Levinson, & McKee,\n1978) are job satisfaction and job involvement (e.g.,\nLorence & Mortimer, 1985). Also, in light of the\nmidlife \"aspiration-achievement gap\" (Brim, 1976), I\nhave included a third measure representing respon-\ndents' satisfaction with their career mobility to date.\nThere are two stages to the following investigation.\nFirst, I present a descriptive analysis of the age-\ndistribution of promotional expectations, including\npotential age variation by the aforementioned fac-\ntors. The second stage examines the connection be-\ntween promotional expectations and job well-being\namong middle-aged men.\nMethods\nThe data chosen for this project were drawn from\nThe QES data were meant to be representative of the\nU.S. working population, as individuals at least 16\nyears of age or older who were working for pay at\nleast 20 hours per week were selected (Quinn &\nThe sample (N = 1,455) was selected through a\nmultistage sampling technique used by the Univer-\nsity of Michigan's Survey Research Center (Quinn &\nShepard, 1974) to select national probability samples\nof dwellings. Data for this study, however, are drawn\nonly from the males (n = 833) in the sample because\nof past differences in men's and women's work and\ncareer experience (e.g., Treiman, 1985).\nMeasures\nTime to Next Promotion. -- This measure is an\nordinal variable representing the time period within\nwhich a respondent expects to receive his next\npromotion.\nAge-based Promotional Expectation. -- This calcu-\nlates the expected age at next promotion for each\nman by adding the time to next promotion, in aver-\nage number of years, to his present age (for a more\ncomplete discussion of this construction, see Ap-\npendix B).\nAge Norms Regarding Future Promotions. -- This\nconstruct was defined earlier as shared expectations\nof when promotions will be received. Critical issues\ninvolved in the measurement of age norms, how-\never, are establishing age boundaries and the\namount of agreement required before we speak of\nstudy, 5-year age ranges are formed to allow a de-\ntailed assessment of age-based distributions consist-\ning of the proportion of men who expect to be in a\ngiven age group at next promotion.

These measures are indices com-\nprising summed items asking the respondent, \"How\ntrue you feel each is of your job?\" with a 4-point\nresponse scale ranging from \"This is not at all true of\nmy job\" to \"This is very true of my job.\" Intrinsic\nrewards are measured by the following three items:\n\"opportunity to develop abilities,\" \"work is interest-\ning,\" and \"freedom to decide how work is done.\"\nExtrinsic reward items include pay and security.\nJob Challenge. -- This is measured by an index\ncomprising the following items descriptive of one's\njob: \"keep learning new things,\" \"requires high\nskill,\" \"allows doing a variety of different things,\"\n\"allows one to use learned skills and knowledge.\"\nDuncan's SES. --Available in the original data, this\nmeasure assigns a status score to each occupational\ntitle based on a function of income and education.\nPsychological Variables\nJob Satisfaction. -- I use a standard measure of job\nsatisfaction which is an index composed of four\nquestions regarding the job in general (Lincoln &\nKalleberg, 1985). Included are questions asking how\nsatisfied in general is the worker, would he take the\nsame job again, would he recommend it to a friend,\nand how well does it measure up to what he thought.\nExcept for the general satisfaction item, the ques-\ntions are all answered on a 4-point Likert scale.\nJob Involvement. -- This is measured by a 3-item\nindex similar to that used in earlier research (e.g.,\nLorence & Mortimer, 1985). Items included are ques-\ntions asking how involved one is in work, whether\ntime drags at work, and how interesting is the work.\nCareer Satisfaction. --This is a composite measure\nformulated by the original investigators. It is made\nup of responses to three statements scored with a 4-\npoint Likert scale (\"not at all true\" - \"very true\"):\n\"chances for promotion are good,\" \"promotions are\nhandled fairly,\" and \"employer is concerned with\ngiving everyone a chance to get ahead.\" All three\nindices are constructed additively with no weighting\nor other manipulation; a high score indicates a\nhigher state of that dimension.\nResults\nThe Age Distribution of Promotional Expectations\nTime to next expected promotion is broken down\nby age group in Table 1. The first hypothesis is re-\njected since the expectation of near-term promotion\nis not constant, but exhibits a substantial linear de-\ncline with increasing age. Conversely, at the oppo-\nsite extreme, the percentage of men who do not\nexpect one for 20 years, or never, increases linearly.\nThe majority of men below age 35 expect their next\npromotion soon, whereas many of those age 50 or\nabove do not expect another in all likelihood. It\nshould be noted, however, that even among these\nolder men, some are expecting a near-term promo-\ndefined here relative to work life as those between\nthe ages of 35 and 50, represent a transitional group.\nEspecially among those in their late 30s, roughly\nequal proportions either expect their next promo-\ntion within 3 years or not for another 20 years, if at all.\nThe first column of Table 2 presents the distribu-\ntion of the expected ages at time of next promotion.\nThis distribution does not reveal an all-or-nothing\nclustering at certain ages, but it does indicate two\n49. In the overall distribution across 10 age catego-\nries, slightly less than one-half (46.5%) expected a\nSome problematic issues arise in evaluating the\nsecond hypothesis, however. Table 2 also presents\nthe actual age distribution of the sample which al-\nlows some assessment of whether the age-based\npatterns regarding expected promotion timing are,\nto any degree, an artifact of the sample. A partial\nanswer was supplied by information in Table 1,\nwhich established that the timing of when one ex-\npects his next promotion is not uniform across age\ncategories. Had this been the case, then the age-\nbased promotional expectation pattern would in-\ndeed have been simply a consequence of the actual\nage distribution of the sample.\nA closer comparison of the two distributions in\nTable 2 is also instructive. For instance, 15.5% of the\nwill be between the ages of 35 and 39 when they\nexpect to receive their next promotion. Moreover,\nsome of the latter percentage is likely made up of\nmen younger than age 30, and from Table 1 it is seen\nthat almost one-third of those ages 30 to 34 expect\neither to not ever receive a promotion or not until\nthey are in their 50s. Likewise, the number who\nexpect a promotion at ages 45 to 49 exceed those\nthus indicating that this age category is drawing siz-\nable numbers of expectancies from other age\ngroups.\nSome similarities between the two distributions do\nexist, however, since some respondents expect a\npromotion soon, hence contributing to proportions\nin the same or next immediate age category. In sum,\nthere seems to be qualified support for the second\nhypothesis, but another issue warrants discussion.\nThe distribution of age-based promotional expec-\ntations found in Table 2 does not control for eligibil-\nity, i.e., those over 35 could not have chosen ages 25\nto 29 as a time for their next promotion. Thus, the\ninitial simple presentation may actually understate\nthe consensus in certain age categories. To address\nthis possibility, the sample is broken into two\ngroups: those 30 years of age or younger and those\nover 30 plus those under age 30 whose age at next\nexpected promotion is 35 or over. The aim is to arrive\nat more accurate estimates of those who actually\nselected a given expected age from those who poten-\ntially could have. For instance, as noted above, the\nmen over 30 could not have said they expected their\nnext promotion before age 30, but it is not the case\nthat some of the younger respondents could not\nhave selected later age ranges.\nAs suspected, when calculations are based on the\nmore eligible pool of respondents, results in the first\ncolumn of Table 3 show heightened agreement con-\ncerning age at next expected promotion in the same\nthe original distribution in Table 2. In addition, the\nTable 1.

Distribution of Expected Age at Next Promotion:\nStratified by Age\nAge\n(N)\nor Younger, %\n--\nExpected Promotion\n--\n--\n--\npeak at ages 45-49 seems due primarily to those\nworkers under age 30 expecting another promotion\nat this time given its proportional increase among the\nyounger vs older workers. This further reinforces the\nearlier tentative conclusion that initial results in Ta-\nble 2 were not simply an artifact of the sample's age\ndistribution.\nStructural Variations in Timing of Promotional\nExpectations\nTable 4 reveals that across different-sized organiza-\ntions, the distribution of expected age at time of next\npromotion is quite similar to the original findings\nshown in Table 2. Among those working in small- to\nmedium-sized organizations, the highest propor-\ntions are again reported in the two contiguous\ngroups making up the 25 to 34 age range, while for\nthose in large organizations, the modal categories\nare 30 to 39. The latter distribution also exhibits a less\npronounced decline after age 34 as compared to\nsmall- and medium-sized organizations. Indeed,\none-quarter of the men working in the largest organi-\nzations expect to receive their next promotion in\ntheir late 30s and early 40s. Within small- and\nmedium-sized organizations, the proportion of men\nwho expect a promotion during the 45-49 age period\nincreases as it did for the sample at large. In light of\nthese findings, the third hypothesis receives sup-\nport, but the percentage of those in the 45-49 age\nperiod was anticipated to be larger among those\nworking in large organizations vs small and medium.\nTable 4 reveals some age-distribution variation\namong industry types, but, again, there is a fair\ndegree of consistency in age-based patterns (see\nNote 2). With the exceptions of the construction\nindustry and services, the modal age range is 30 to 34.\nHowever, an equal percentage within the transporta-\ntion, communication, and utility industries expects\nto receive their next promotion when they are 25 to\n29. Similar to the original distribution, many of the\nTable 4. Distribution of Expected Age at Next Promotion by Organization Size and Industry (Percentages)\nAge\nRange\n(N)\nO\nSmall\nrganization Size\nMedium\nLarge\nContract\nConstruction\nManufacturing\nIndustry\nTransportation,\nCommunication,\n& Utilities\nWholesale\n& Retail\nServices\nGovernment\n--\nNote: Total percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding.\nindustries exhibit a decrease in the percentage of\nmen who expect their next promotion either in their\nlate 30s or early 40s followed by an upturn in the\nproportion who expect to be promoted in the sec-\nond half of their 40s. Taken together, if expectations\nare any indication of opportunity, then those work-\ners in larger organizations and select industries (e.g.,\nservices and government) may have more opportuni-\nties available to them further into their work career,\nand therefore respondents expect promotions later\nin their working lives. This also provides some sup-\nport for my third hypothesis.\nJob category is the third structural feature used in\nthis comparative assessment (see Note 3). Table 5\nshows that, once more, peaks in promotion expect-\nancies are found in the age categories of 25-34 and\n45-49 across many of these occupational classifica-\ntions. However, among operatives and nonfarm la-\nborers, the modal response is located in the 20 to 24\nage bracket, suggesting, as was the case for construc-\ntion workers, that opportunities come earlier. An\nopposite trend, however, is displayed for managers\nand administrators since their modal category is the\n55 to 59 age group, making it reasonable to postulate\nthat more opportunity is available to men in these\npositions and extends later into one's career. This\nfinding would also be in accordance with the reason-\ning underlying the third hypothesis (see Note 4).\nPsychological Consequences\nThe descriptive data revealed two age periods in\nwhich men expect promotions. The first was earlier\nin the work career (ages 25-34), while the second\ntends to fall during midcareer (ages 45-49). If expec-\ntations are at all indicative of opportunities, this latter\nperiod may represent one's last chances for further\npromotion. Rosenbaum's (1984, see especially ch. 3)\ncase study of a major firm presents evidence that this\nis indeed the case for some workers. In addition,\nages 45 to 50 represent a more general age norm\nconcerning \"when most men hold their top job\"\nhowever, they report some expansion of the age\nrange).\nIn light of the findings from this study and others,\nit is reasonable to consider the midlife period of\none's work career (ages 35 to 50) as representing a\npotential watershed. As much is shown in Table 2,\nwherein clearly the normative expectation for men\nunder age 35 is to be promoted soon (3 years or less),\nwhile that for those older than age 50 is to never\nexpect another promotion again. These findings sug-\ngest that younger men would provide an interesting\ncomparison group to midlife men in analyzing the\nconnection between normative expectations and\nwell-being.\nDespite the hypothesized role that career dy-\nnamics may play in midlife men's psychosocial devel-\nLevinson et al., 1978), its lack of careful delineation\nsuggests by its omission an uncritical acceptance of\nmidlife men's similarity in career experience and\npsychological response, i.e., most if not all men\nendure psychological difficulty as a result of evaluat-\ning their career progress compared to their aspira-\ntions (e.g., Kalleberg & Loscocco, 1983). This may be\nattributed in part to the influence of a developmental\npsychological perspective (Dannefer, 1984). How-\never, the anticipated \"naturalness\" of midlife experi-\nence precludes studying those structural and cultural\ndynamics surrounding career mobility, dynamics\nproposes \"may operate directly to produce [varied\npsychological outcomes] in the middle years.\" I turn\nnow to a preliminary examination of these ideas.\nClearly, for younger men to be \"off time\" regard-\ning one's promotional expectations is to never ex-\npect another, but it is more ambiguous for middle-\naged men, as Table 1 reveals. To examine this\nnormative factor using regression analysis and com-\npare younger to middle-aged men, a dummy variable\nis created by coding those men who expected their\nnext promotion in more than 20 years or never as \" 1 \"\nand all others as \"0.\" This indicator is included to-\ngether with other structural measures such as num-\nTable 5.

The model is limited because my aim is not a\nfull specification of the influences on particular job\nwell-being measures, but a comparative examination\nof hypothesized influences. Table 6 presents de-\nscriptive information and correlations for these mea-\nsures. Among middle-aged men, there is little associ-\nation between the normative factor of \"off time\"\npromotional expectations and the measures of well-\nbeing, while for younger men there appears to be a\nmoderate association. Moreover, among middle-\naged men, the positive sign of the coefficient be-\ntween the normative factor and job satisfaction\nmeans that those men who do not expect another\npromotion are higher in job satisfaction.\nTable 7 presents the results of the regression analy-\nsis of the three dependent measures (see Note 5).\nNot expecting another promotion is not significantly\nassociated with any of the three well-being variables.\nClearly, among middle-aged men, the results under-\nscore the importance of more proximate job condi-\ntions, especially the intrinsic rewards associated with\nthe job, for all three measures of well-being. For\nyounger men, the normative factor of being \"off\ntime\" is significantly associated with job involvement\nand career satisfaction. However, when other vari-\nables are introduced into the model its connection to\njob involvement disappears, but it remains a signifi-\ncant factor for career satisfaction, if slightly reduced.\nIntrinsic rewards stand out once again as the most\npowerful influence related to these measures of job\nwell-being.\nDiscussion\nFindings support the existence of some degree of\nnormativity in promotion expectations in that some\nTable 6.

Standardized coefficients are reported.\nage categories are characterized by more consensus\nthan others. One-third of the respondents expect\nadvancement within the contiguous age categories\n-- ages 45-49 -- where more agreement is found\ncompared to the remaining age brackets. Since these\npatterns are based on expectations, and hence re-\nflect what is in people's consciousness, they clearly\nsuggest the existence of age norms regarding pro-\nmotion expectations. At the same time, it is impor-\ntant to note that there is not overwhelming consen-\nsus, especially when compared to other studies of\ncareer-related age norms (e.g., Lawrence, 1984,\n1988). It is, perhaps, not surprising that age norms\nappear to be stronger and more visible in the context\nof specific organizations which tend to develop their\nown culture.\nDespite some variation, the age distribution is sur-\nprisingly consistent across the structural features ex-\namined here. This contrasts with Nydegger's (1986b)\nconjecture that \"there are no general timetables of\nthe worklife\" (p. 144). In fact, results here are in line\nwith data on actual promotion patterns (Rosenbaum,\nThe second part of the analysis gauged the relative\nassociation of one particular normative facet (i.e., if\none was \"off-time\" regarding his promotional expec-\ntations) with job well-being compared with other\nselected structural features also found to be linked to\npsychological outcomes. The mobility-related vari-\nables, both the structural measure of number of\npromotions and the normative indicator of expecta-\ntions for future promotion, exhibited no statistically\nsignificant association with the three job well-being\nmeasures for middle-aged men. While the mobility-\nrelated measures exhibited some direct impact on\nthe career satisfaction of younger men, covariance is\npresent among the normative factor of being off-\ntime in one's promotional expectations, job charac-\nteristics, and well-being. Hence, the prior variable's\ninfluence may be even stronger than demonstrated\nhere. A similar effect, if less pronounced for middle-\naged men compared to the younger men, may be\noperating given some of the correlation coefficients.\nConsideration of these links between mobility and\ncurrent job characteristics warrants further testing\nwith appropriate statistical techniques to see\nwhether or not mobility-related influences might be\nmediated through more immediate job conditions\nstudy reinforces this lead as she notes that \"auton-\nomy and independence, growth and a sense of chal-\nlenge, the chance to learn [are] earned through in-\ncreasing hierarchical position\" (p. 131). Hence,\nmobility-related influences may operate more indi-\nrectly than originally proposed by Dannefer (1984).\nThe strongest associations with well-being definitely\nwere found in such characteristics of the job, repre-\nsented here by the measures of intrinsic and extrinsic\nrewards and job challenge, thus reinforcing earlier\nconclusions established by Kalleberg (1977) and\nPrevious findings regarding the psychological con-\nsequences of normative assessments are mixed (e.g.,\nComparing the regression results from the two age\ngroups suggests that when there is strong evidence\nof a normative time-frame for one's next expected\npromotion, then being \"off time\" is likely to influ-\nence job well-being. As noted earlier, such a clear\nnormative timeframe for promotion did not exist for\nmiddle-aged men. Many of these men may have\nadjusted to their career prospects, despite the\ngloomier midlife scenarios. It is possible that those\nwho feel they are settled in their jobs and do not\nexpect future movement actually feel some content-\nment because such a settled position is preferred.\nSecondary analyses of existing data sets pose\nnoted limitations (Kiecolt & Nathan, 1985). Thus, this\nstudy, despite using more extensive data, must still\nbe seen as exploratory since the analysis was framed\naround some measures which were not part of the\noriginal investigators' purposes. Also, the original\ndesign relied on self-report measures regarding\nmobility-related concerns among others, the accu-\nracy of which may be questionable (e.g., Lawrence,\ncorrespondence noted above between these find-\nings and some of Rosenbaum's results, this may not\nbe as much of a problem as thought. Finally, an\nadditional limitation involves the cross-sectional nat-\nure of the data. The age-based promotional expecta-\ntion rates reported here were gained by asking re-\nspondents of varying ages when they expect their\nnext promotion. Age patterns are inferred from the\nresulting distribution. Longitudinal data would, of\ncourse, be more desirable, or at the very least an\nextended prospective design which might ask indi-\nviduals if and when they expect promotions (not just\ntheir next one) to be forthcoming during their work\nlives. Studies designed to address specifically the\nissues examined here would undoubtedly shed more\nlight on these phenomena. While additional quanti-\ntative investigations would be useful, so too would\nmore qualitative studies given the importance of\nexpectations in the symbolic horizons of the actor.\nReferences\nBrim, O.

Jacobsen and Van der Voordt (1980) also offer some\nstatistical guidelines for assessing modal frequencies.\na large number of response categories, the proportion\nwhich may signify a norm is likely to be lower than \"when\nthere are only two or three such categories.\" Given the\nnumerous age categories in the present analysis, it is un-\nlikely that a clear majority of responses will fall in one age\nrange. Thus, the requirements for establishing age norms\nwill likely have to be less stringent than their proposed\nguidelines.\n2. All possible industries found in the data are not in-\ncluded here. Some industries had too few cases (agricul-\nture and fisheries [n = 12]; mining [n = 5]; and finance\nand insurance [n = 29]) for the results to be conclusive in\neven a preliminary fashion.\n3. For the same reasons as above, I only report data on\nthose job categories that had at least 30 respondents. Omit-\nted from this analysis are sales workers, transport equip-\nment operatives, farmers and farm managers, farm laborers\nand farm foremen, and private household workers.\n4. It is beyond the reach of this study to provide in-\ndepth comparisons of the distributions of expected age at\ntime of next promotion across these structural features\nagainst their actual age distributions. Based on the earlier\ndiscussion of these issues in the text, it seems unlikely that\nthe expected age distributions across these structural fea-\ntures would simply be artifacts of actual age. The actual age\ndistributions for these features are presented in Appendix\nC for examination.\n5. Variables are entered in a hierarchical fashion with\nthe general control variable of Duncan SES entered first.\nResults displayed include those effects net of the control\nvariable. This strategy allows me to first examine the main\ntarget variables of \"behind time\" expectations and promo-\ntions, while next introducing other factors in what is essen-\ntially a logic of elaboration.\nPartial plots of residuals were inspected to ensure the\nappropriateness of regression analysis with these vari-\nables. Generally, no severe departures from the assump-\ntions required for regression were indicated. One excep-\ntion was the promotion variable. However, various\ntransformations did not successfully overcome this limita-\ntion. Because any such transformation makes substantive\ninterpretation of the results difficult, plus the fact that\ncoefficients and R2 remained stable through such attempts,\nI deemed it best to enter this variable unaltered.\nAppendix B\nConstructing the measure of individual age-based pro-\nmotional expectations began with this Quality of Employ-\nment Survey item: \"How many years or months do you\nthink it will be before you are given a chance to take on a\njob at a higher level where you now work?\" Responses\nwere chosen from the following ordinal set of time spans:\n1. Less than a month.\n4. More than one year, up to and including 3 years.\n5. More than 3 years, up to and including 5 years.\n6. More than 5 years, up to and including 10 years.\n7. More than 10 years, up to and including 20 years.\nThe first three categories were collapsed into one repre-\nsenting the time span of up to one year. Similar to previous\nremaining time spans is converted to single years by taking\nits midpoint response and rounding upwards if necessary.\nUsing this strategy, response numbers one through seven\nwere reassigned the following values:\nThese values are then added to the respondents' ages to\ngenerate an age-based promotional expectation (e.g., if\nthe respondent was 37, and he said he expected his next\npromotion more than 5 years from now, up to and includ-\ning 10, 8 is added to his age, resulting in an expectation for\npromotion at the age of 45.\nThe last original category is admittedly problematic since\nit contains two separate responses: \"More than 20 years;\nnever.\" Dropping these responses because of their ambig-\nuous nature, however, results in losing much information\n(46.6% of the respondents gave this response). While a\ntime period of 20 years or more clearly makes little sense\nfor older respondents (e.g., if a 50-year-old man expects a\npromotion in 20 years, the resulting age norm would be\n70), it is still feasible that younger men who selected this\nresponse (and they are many: 24.3% of the men under age\n40 selected this response) did not mean that they \"never\"\nexpect a promotion.\nI utilize a compromise solution whereby I have assigned\nthis last category the value of 25, but then dropped any\nrespondents whose age-based expectation is over 65. This\nway I am able to retain some potentially meaningful infor-\nmation and not lose nearly half of the sample.\nAppendix C\nAge Distributions by Organization Size, Industry, and Job Category (Percentages)\nAge\nRange\n(N)\nAge\nRange\n(N)\nOrganization\nSmall\nMedium\nProfessional\n& Technical\nSize\nLarge Contract\n(500 + ) Construction Manufacturing\nManagers &\nAdministrators\nClerical\nIndustry\nTransportation,\nCommunication,\n& Utilities\nJob Category\nCraft\nOperatives\n(Excluding\nWorkers Transport)\nWholesale\n& Retail Services\nNonfarm\nLaborers\nGovernment\nService\n(Nonhousehold)\nNote: Total percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding."
