In recent years, however,\nultrasonography has been used successfully\nto diagnose many types of lung diseases,\nsuch as neonatal respiratory distress syn-\ndrome (RDS), transient tachypnoea of the\nnewborn, pneumonia, and atelectasis.5\u00ad9\nThis previous experience showed that lung\nultrasonography is an accurate and reliable\nmethod for the early diagnosis and identifi-\ncation of neonatal lung diseases. This pre-\nsent study investigated the diagnostic value\nof lung ultrasonography for MAS, as well as\npresenting the ultrasonographic characteris-\ntics of MAS.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nThis prospective observational study\nenrolled consecutive patients who were\nadmitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care\nUnit, Bayi Children's Hospital, the Army\nGeneral Hospital of the Chinese People's\nLiberation Army, Beijing, China and diag-\nnosed with MAS based on medical history,\nclinical manifestations, arterial blood gas\nanalysis and chest X-ray between January\nMAS and the complications of pneumo-\nthorax and/or pneumomediastinum were\nexcluded from the study. The diagnostic\ncriteria for MAS were as follows:1,10\n(i) respiratory distress with elevated oxygen\ndependence; (ii) presence of meconium in the\namniotic fluid; (iii) the classic radiographic\nfindings in MAS, which are overexpansion\nof the lungs with widespread coarse, massive\nbilateral patchy infiltrates with or without\npleural fluid; and (iv) abnormal blood gas\nanalysis results. A group of newborns with-\nout lung and heart disease who were hospi-\ntalized at Bayi Children's Hospital during\nthe same time period and who underwent\nlung ultrasonography were used as the con-\ntrol subjects.\nThis study obtained approval from\nthe Ethics Committee of the Army General\nHospital of the Chinese People's Liberation\nthe patients and control subjects participat-\ning in the study provided verbal informed\nconsent.\nUltrasonography methods\nA VolusonTM E8 or a LOGICTM C9\nultrasound machine (GE Healthcare,\nPiscataway, NJ, USA) was used with a\nNewborns were placed in a supine, lateral\nor prone position while at rest. During\nultrasonography, each lung was divided\ninto three regions (front, lateral and back),\nusing anterior and posterior axillary lines as\nthe boundary. While scanning each region of\nthe lungs, the hand piece was perpendicular\nor parallel to the ribs. The lung ultrasonog-\nraphy examinations were performed by one\nphysician (J.L.), while the clinical data were\ncollected by different physicians, and the\nultrasound operator was blinded to the\nclinical condition of the neonates. The lung\nultrasound for MAS patients was performed\non admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care\nUnit or within 2 h after receiving mechanical\nventilation. The lung ultrasound for control\nnewborns was performed by the same phys-\nician (J.L.) on admission to hospital.\nObservational indices\nThe observational indices included pleural\nlines, lung sliding, A-lines, B-lines, intersti-\ntial syndrome, white lung, lung consoli-\ndation with air bronchogram or fluid\nbronchogram, double lung point, and\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nthe SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version 16.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. Fisher's exact test was used to\ncompare the rate of positive neonatal ultra-\nsound findings between the two groups. The\nspecificity and sensitivity of the primary\nexamination results for diagnosing MAS\nwere calculated based on this test. A\nP-value < 0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nA total of 117 paediatric patients diagnosed\nwith MAS based on typical medical history,\nclinical manifestations, abnormal blood gas\nanalysis results and chest X-ray findings\nwere enrolled in this study and underwent\nlung ultrasonography. Their gestational age\nseven late preterm newborns); 69 were male,\nand 48 were female. Sixty-six newborns were\ndelivered vaginally, and 51 were delivered\nvia caesarean section. Their birth weight\nnewborns with no lung diseases were\nincluded in the control group; 59 were\nmale, and 41 were female. Among the\ncontrols, 57 were delivered vaginally, and\n43 were delivered via caesarean section.\nTheir gestational age ranged from 35\u00fe2 to\n41\u00fe5 weeks and their birth weight ranged\nthose of the MAS patients.\nIn normal lung tissue, the pleural line and\nA-line were clear, parallel and equally spaced,\nwith smooth, clear and regular high echoes.\nThe lung sliding was clearly present, with no\nor a few B-lines. B-lines were found in 25 of\nweeks after birth, five of them still had\nsignificant B-lines. There was no pleural\neffusion or lung consolidation (Figure 1).\nIn this study, the main lung ultrasono-\ngraphic findings in MAS patients were as\nfollows: (i) lung consolidation with air\nbronchogram was found in all patients,\nusually with a large consolidation area\nwith irregular edges (Figures 2 and 3). The\nlung consolidation area varied between the\nlungs, and different sizes of consolidation\narea were present in the same lung (Figures 4\nand 5); (ii) pleural line anomalies and the\nFigure 1.

In normal newborns without lung\ndisease, the lungs were hypoechoic; the pleural line\nand A-line were hyperechoic, clear, smooth, regular,\nand parallel and equally spaced, and the echoes\ngradually became weaker and eventually dis-\nappeared as the pleural line and the A-line extended\ndeep into the lungs.\nFigure 2. Lung ultrasonographic findings in a newborn with neonatal meconium aspiration syndrome\n(MAS). The newborn was delivered at 39\u00fe5 weeks of gestation and presented with meconium staining of the\namniotic fluid, asphyxia at birth, and difficulty breathing after resuscitation. Lung ultrasonography showed\nlarge areas of pulmonary consolidation with air bronchogram and irregular edges in the lungs, especially in the\nright lung. The pleural line was abnormal, and the A-line disappeared in the consolidation area. Chest X-ray\nshowed patchy and cloudy shadows that were consistent with MAS.\nFigure 3. Lung ultrasonographic findings in a newborn with neonatal meconium aspiration syndrome\n(MAS). The newborn was delivered at 41 weeks of gestation, weighed 3330 g and presented with meconium\nstaining of the amniotic fluid, asphyxia at birth, and difficulty breathing after resuscitation. Lung ultrason-\nography showed large areas of pulmonary consolidation with air bronchogram and irregular edges in the lungs.\nThe pleural line was abnormal, and the A-line disappeared in the consolidation area. Chest X-ray showed\npatchy and cloudy shadows that were consistent with MAS.\nFigure 4. Lung ultrasonographic findings in a newborn with neonatal meconium aspiration syndrome. The\nnewborn was delivered at 39\u00fe6 weeks of gestation via a vaginal birth, weighted 3350 g and presented with fetal\ndistress, meconium staining of the amniotic fluid, and decreased amniotic fluid. At 37 weeks, the umbilical cord\nwas wrapped twice around the feet and was twisted. Apgar scores at birth were 7, 10, and 10 points at 1, 5,\nand 10 min, respectively, and heart rate was < 80 beats per min. There was no premature rupture of the fetal\nmembranes according to the patient's family. The newborn had difficulty breathing after birth. The patient\nwas transferred to our hospital with endotracheal intubation and positive pressure ventilation. Lung\nultrasonography showed large areas of pulmonary consolidation with irregular edges in the lungs, especially\nin the right lung.\nFigure 5. Lung ultrasonographic findings in a newborn with neonatal meconium aspiration syndrome. This\npatient had large areas of pulmonary consolidation with air bronchogram shown on lung ultrasonography; two\nconsolidation areas of different sizes are shown in the right lung, the pleural line blurred or disappeared, and\nthe A-line disappeared.\ndisappearance of the A-line was found in all\npatients. Pleural line anomalies presented as\nthe disappearance of the pleural line or as\nthickened and blurred pleural lines in the\nlesions (Figures 1\u00ad4); (iii) atelectasis is a\nmanifestation of severe lung consolidation\nthis study (Figure 6). These patients showed\nsevere massive atelectasis and visible lung\npulse. All of the patients with atelectasis had\nan absence of lung sliding; (iv) pleural\nin this study (Figure 6); (v) alveolar-inter-\nstitial syndrome (AIS) or B-line in the non-\nconsolidation area was found in all patients\nwith MAS (Table 1).\nBased on the results of this study, lung\nconsolidation with irregular margins were\nthe common and specific ultrasound find-\nings of MAS. Therefore, this study used the\npresence of lung consolidation with irregular\nmargins as a parameter for calculating the\nsensitivity (a/a\u00fec) and specificity (d/b \u00fe d)\nof ultrasonography for diagnosing MAS.\nThe results indicate this sign exhibited both\na sensitivity and specificity of 100% in\ndiagnosing MAS (Table 2).\nDiscussion\nThe incidence of meconium staining of the\namniotic fluid (MSAF) increases with ges-\ntational age. For example, the overall inci-\ndence of MSAF is approximately 12%,\nwhile the incidence is 30% at gestational\nages of >42 weeks; < 2% at gestational ages\nof <37 weeks; and rare at gestational ages\nnaturally occurring sign of the development\nof the gastrointestinal tract. For fetuses with\nmature nervous systems, umbilical cord\ncompression may cause transient parasym-\npathetic excitement and ensuing meconium\nexcretion. Fetal distress may also trigger\nmeconium excretion. After the baby is born\nand starts to breathe on their own, they may\ninhale meconium particles into the distal\nairways. Should a large amount of thick\nFigure 6. Lung ultrasonographic findings in a newborn with neonatal meconium aspiration syndrome.

In the past, MAS was\nmainly diagnosed based on typical medical\nhistory, clinical manifestations, arterial\nblood gas analysis, and X-ray. However,\nmany cases of MAS were misdiagnosed or\nA previous study had described the lung\nultrasound signs in six patients with MAS,\nwhich included: (i) B-pattern coalescent or\nsparse; (ii) consolidations; (iii) atelectasis;\nand (iv) bronchograms.20 The authors\nreported that the lung ultrasound images\ncorresponded well with the X-ray findings.20\nThis present study demonstrated that lung\nultrasonography was accurate and reliable\nfor the diagnosis of MAS. Based on the\nresults of this study, the main ultrasono-\ngraphic characteristics of MAS were as\nfollows: (i) lung consolidation with air\nbronchogram was found in all patients,\nusually with a large consolidation area\nwith irregular edges. According to this pre-\nsent study, the signs of lung consolidation\nwith irregular margins on ultrasonography\nfor diagnosing MAS; (ii) there was variation\nin the nature and extent of pulmonary\nlesions between lungs or in the same lung.\nThe area of lung consolidation varied\nTable 1.

A large consolidation was often seen in\nseverely affected patients, while small con-\nsolidations and confluent B-lines were often\nseen in patients with less severe MAS;\n(iii) atelectasis was found in a few (16.2%)\nsevere cases in this present study. Lung pulse\nwas observed in severe cases (8.5%). There\nwas an absence of lung sliding in all patients\nwith atelectasis; (iv) pleural line anomalies\nwere seen, including the disappearance of\nthe pleural line or thickened and blurred\npleural lines in the lesions; (v) the disappear-\nance of the A-line was observed; (vi) the\nB-line or AIS was observed in the non-\nconsolidation area; (vii) pleural effusion was\nfound in 13.7% of patients in this present\nstudy. However, these ultrasonographic\nfindings are also observed in lung diseases\nsuch as RDS, pneumonia and atelectasis, so\nthey are not specific to MAS.5\u00ad7 In particu-\nlar, large areas of pulmonary consolidation\nwith irregular edges are also observed on\nlung ultrasonography in cases of pneumo-\nnia,6 which is useful for differentiating\nbetween MAS and other diseases. MAS\nand pneumonia may be differentiated\nbecause varying degrees of pulmonary con-\nsolidation are usually observed in both lungs\nin MAS but only in one lung in pneumonia.\nPrevious research suggests that in normal\nnewborns a few B-lines may be present\nHowever, this present study found that\nB-lines may still be present in healthy new-\nborns after 3 days, and even 2\u00ad3 weeks after\nbirth. This suggests that our knowledge and\nunderstanding of lung ultrasonography, a\nnew technology, will deepen with more\nin-depth research and clinical experience.\nIn conclusion, lung ultrasonography\nappears to be an accurate, reliable, simple\nand non-invasive technology for the diagno-\nsis of MAS, which can be performed at the\nbedside. Moreover, lung ultrasonography\ncan be readily performed and is suitable\nfor dynamic monitoring, and it can provide\ntimely and valuable medical information\nwhen clinicians need to determine the\ncauses of sudden changes in the patient's\ncondition. In particular, lung ultrasonog-\nraphy does not use radiation and thus\nprevents radiation-related injury in the\npatient, other patients in the same ward\nand the medical staff.21 In addition, it is very\neasy to distinguish MAS from other lung\ndiseases, such as transient tachypnoea of the\nnewborn, RDS, pneumonia, atelactesis, by\nusing lung ultrasound.5\u00ad8 Lung ultrasonog-\nraphy could replace X-rays for the diagnosis\nand differential diagnosis of common lung\ndiseases.22,23 In order for this new technol-\nogy to be used more effectively, medical staff\nwill require proper training in lung\nultrasonography.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the Clinical\nResearch Special Fund of Wu Jieping Medical\nReferences\n1.
