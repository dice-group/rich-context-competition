Redwood Street, Baltimore, MD\n Keywords: pregnancy, methamphetamines, treatment, attrition\nIntroduction\nMethamphetamine use is a growing problem among pregnant women in the United\nStates. Whereas it accounted for only 8% of all pregnant admissions to substance\nabuse treatment in 1994, since 2003 it has surpassed cocaine as the number one sub-\nstance compelling treatment and now accounts for 24% of all admissions.1 Rates of\nmethamphetamine treatment admissions are greater in pregnant women than among\nboth nonpregnant women (12.5%) and men (7%).2 Similarly, hospitalizations of\npregnant women with a diagnosis of methamphetamine abuse doubled from 1998 to\n2004 while hospitalizations of pregnant women with a diagnosis of cocaine abuse\nMethamphetamine usage is disproportionately distributed between men and women\ncompared to other drugs, possibly because of its effects as a weight loss agent.4\u00ad6\nAlthough men account for a greater proportion of the users of most illicit substances,\nwomen account for a greater percentage of methamphetamine users.4 The dispar-\nity is even more pronounced among adolescents4 which is especially concerning as\nmethamphetamine use has been associated with risky sexual activity and pregnancy\nOne of the difficulties in elucidating methamphetamine's effects on the develop-\ning fetus is that drug-using pregnant women may consume more than one substance,\nincluding tobacco and alcohol. Current research has demonstrated associations\nThis article was published in the following Dove Press journal:\nSubstance Abuse and Rehabilitation\nNumber of times this article has been viewed\nsubmit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com\nDovepress\nDovepress\nLindsay et al\nbetween methamphetamine and preterm birth, low gestational\nweight, smaller head circumference, and intrauterine growth\nrestriction.8\u00ad10 Pregnant women admitted to the hospital\nwith a diagnosis of methamphetamine use are more likely\nto experience hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, and\nplacenta previa when compared to pregnant cocaine users.8,11\nThe evidence that drug use during pregnancy has adverse\neffects on the mother and the developing baby and results in\nincreased healthcare costs for both is well documented.12\u00ad16\nEffects of neonatal drug exposure have also been shown to\ncontinue into childhood and early adolescence.14,16\nPrior research indicates that substance abuse treatment\nduring pregnancy is associated with increased abstinence\nand improved social functioning in the mother, as well as\nimproved neonatal outcomes such as reduced incidence\nof preterm births and higher birth weight.17\u00ad19 Despite this,\npregnant women may be at higher risk of not completing\namphetamine as a primary drug of abuse in pregnancy, it\nis imperative that treatment outcomes in this population be\nexamined. This study was undertaken to examine whether\npregnant women admitted into treatment for methamphet-\namine use were more likely to leave against professional\nadvice compared with those admitted for other substances.\nAs a corollary, it was examined whether there were particular\ndemographic or treatment-specific characteristics among\nmethamphetamine admissions that were associated with\nleaving treatment prematurely.\nMethods\nA cross-sectional study was conducted using the Treatment\nEpisode Data Set-Discharges (TEDS-D), an administra-\ntive data system that contains data on all substance abuse\nadmissions to treatment facilities receiving federal funding\nin the United States. These data are collected by states to\nmonitor their individual substance abuse treatment pro-\ngrams and submitted to SubstanceAbuse and Mental Health\nServicesAdministration. In 2006, the admissions data were\nlinked to discharge data and made publically available\nfor the first time. The unit of analysis in TEDS-D is the\nadmission episode and not the individual client. TEDS-D\ncontains client-level information on demographics (age,\nrace, housing, and socioeconomic status), substance abuse\nbehavior (type of substance, frequency, and mode of use),\nas well as treatment characteristics (referral source, days\nwaiting for treatment, prior treatment, and service setting)\nand discharge information (length of stay and reason for\ndischarge).The dataset in this study was limited to pregnant\nadmissions only.\nPrimary variables of interest\nThe primary exposure of this study was methamphetamine\nuse, defined by methamphetamine or amphetamine being the\nprimarydrugcompellingtreatmentadmission.Amphetamines\nwere not separated from methamphetamines as states varied\nin their subclassification of these substances. Some states did\nnot separate methamphetamines from amphetamines in their\nreporting. However, for the states that made this distinction\nall stimulant admissions.23 Methamphetamine use was con-\ntrasted with other primary substances compelling treatment\nwhich included other illicit substances and alcohol. Nicotine\nuse is not included in TEDS-D.\nThe primary outcome of this study was clients that left\nsubstance abuse treatment against professional advice.\nTEDS-D includes reasons for treatment discharge. \nLeaving\nagainst professional advice is defined as \"the client chose\nnot to complete the treatment program.\" It includes those\nwho have not received treatment for some time and are\ndischarged for administrative reasons. Leaving against\nprofessional advice was contrasted with any other reason\nfor ending treatment episode, including completion or\nincarceration.\nCovariates\nAdditional variables included in the analysis were either\n\ndemographic or treatment specific. A dichotomous \nvariable\nwas created that indicated polysubstance use prior to\n\nadmission. Prior treatment, injection drug use, and marital\nstatus were all coded as dichotomous variables, as was\n\neducation, which was collapsed into some high school or\nless versus completed high school or greater. Criminal justice\nreferral was also coded as a dichotomous variable with those\n\nidentified as having been referred by any police official, judge,\nprosecutor, probation officer, or other person affiliated with\nthe federal, state or county judicial systems. Race and age\nwere categorized into subgroups for analysis as was service\nsetting. Service setting is defined in TEDS-D as follows:\nambulatory (consisting of outpatient intensive or nonintensive\ntreatment services), residential (nonacute inpatient short-\nor long-term treatment), and detoxification (an acute 24 hour/\nday service to provide a safe withdrawal from substances).\nFinally, frequency of substance use was described as either\nless than weekly use or weekly or more use.\nStatistical analysis\nDemographic and treatment specific variables were analyzed\nusing univariate and bivariate analysis. Chi-square tests were\nused to identify association between covariates and primary\nSubstance Abuse and Rehabilitation 2011:2 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com\nDovepress\nDovepress\nTreatment attrition among pregnant methamphetamine users\nexposure and outcome of interest.

Among pregnant admissions that report\nless than weekly frequency of use, methamphetamine users\nare 57% more likely to leave treatment against profes-\nsional advice. Other covariates associated with leaving\ntreatment against professional advice were also identified,\nin particular, a criminal justice system referral and a high\nschool education or greater resulted in decreased odds of\nleaving treatment.\nThe interpretation of frequency of substance use as an\neffect modifier is difficult. There have been few studies\nreporting on the frequency of methamphetamine use among\npregnant women. Della Grotta et al24 observed that among\npregnant methamphetamine users, frequency of use declined\nover the course of pregnancy from an average of 3.1 days/\nweek in the first trimester to an average of 1.5 days/week\nin the last trimester. If frequency of use decreases over the\ncourse of pregnancy, then those users in the less than weekly\ngroup may have been further along in their pregnancies and\nmay have left treatment to deliver. Unfortunately, gestational\nage cannot be assessed from TEDS-D. Alternatively, less\nfrequent users may not perceive themselves as having a sub-\nstance abuse problem that is severe enough to require treat-\nment and therefore may be less committed to remaining.\nFindings regarding high school education and criminal\njustice referral are consistent with previous studies on\nsubstance treatment in pregnant women and mixed gender\npopulations. These studies identified high school education\nand a criminal justice referral as predictors of treatment\ntreatment by the criminal justice system rather than self-\nreferred can risk loss of custody of their children if they don't\ncomplete treatment, which may explain the strong negative\nassociation of this covariate with leaving treatment against\nprofessional advice.A high school education could be a proxy\nfor socioeconomic level which, along with employment,\nmay engender greater access to child care, transportation,\nor a support network. Similarly, the finding that prior drug\ntreatment is associated with treatment attrition is consistent\nwith a previous study.17\nPriorresearchinpregnantwomenontheroleofraceinpre-\nThis current study adds evidence in favor of a role for race\nand suggests that race may be related to both substance of\nabuse and frequency of use.\nAdministrative data is subject to certain limitations.\nTEDS-D only includes institutions receiving public funding;\ntherefore some treatment facilities are not included. However,\nTEDS has been estimated to capture 87% of all treatment\nadmissions in the United States.29 Another limitation of\nTEDS-D is that the unit of data collection is treatment epi-\nsode (admission coupled with discharge), not the individual\nclient. Detoxification treatment usually results in the transi-\ntion to residential or ambulatory treatment. Therefore, it is\nlikely that a particular client could be entered into the data\nset more than once, which challenges the assumed indepen-\ndence of the samples. Because TEDS-D is deidentified, it is\nnot possible to run an analysis for correlated data based on\nrepeated admissions. If correlation was properly accounted\nfor, then variance would likely increase and results would\nbe biased away from the null.\nMany previous studies of pregnant substance users were\nconducted in inpatient facilities with small populations,\nthis study include a large national sample that provided the\nstatistical power needed to examine and identify multiple\ncovariates in the regression model, even when stratified by\nfrequency of use.
