We investigated whether base-\nline periodontal disease independently predicts incident diabetes over two decades of follow-up.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- A total of 9,296 nondiabetic male and female\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) participants aged 25\u00ad74 years\nwho completed a baseline dental examination (1971\u00ad1976) and had at least one follow-up\nevaluation (1982\u00ad1992) were studied. We defined six categories of baseline periodontal disease\nusing the periodontal index. Of 7,168 dentate participants, 47% had periodontal index  0\n(periodontally healthy); the remaining were classified into periodontal index quintiles. Incident\ndiabetes was defined by 1) death certificate (ICD-9 code 250), 2) self-report of diabetes requiring\npharmacological treatment, or 3) health care facility stay with diabetes discharge code. Multiva-\nriable logistic regression models assessed incident diabetes odds across increasing levels of\nperiodontal index in comparison with periodontally healthy participants.\nRESULTS -- The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for incident diabetes in periodontal index cate-\ngories 1 and 2 were not elevated, whereas the ORs in periodontal index categories 3 through 5\nedentulous participants was 1.30 (1.00\u00ad1.70). Dentate participants with advanced tooth loss\nhad an OR of 1.70 (P  0.05) relative to those with minimal tooth loss.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Baseline periodontal disease is an independent predictor of incident\ndiabetes in the nationally representative sample of NHANES I.\nType 2 diabetes is a significant public\nhealth concern. The association be-\ntween type 2 diabetes and periodon-\ntal disease is well documented (1,2), and\nperiodontal disease has been traditionally\nviewed solely as a pathological conse-\nquence of diabetes (3). However, prospec-\ntive data supporting this unidirectional\nhypothesis are limited, and prevailing\nviews regarding associations between\nperiodontal disease and type 2 diabetes\nshould be informed by the growing body\nof evidence suggesting periodontal dis-\nease as a risk factor for atherosclerotic car-\ndiovascular disease (CVD) (4\u00ad7).\nType 2 diabetes and CVD have com-\nmon antecedents, and in view of the\nAmerican Heart Association's Scientific\nStatement on   stating that \"diabe-\ntes is a cardiovascular disease\" (8), it\nseems reasonable to hypothesize peri-\nodontal disease as a potential contributor\nto development of type 2 diabetes. As\nwith CVD infection hypotheses, chronic\ninflammation in response to periodontal\nbacteria might link periodontal disease\nand type 2 diabetes. Indeed, systemic in-\nflammation has emerged as a novel pre-\nindividuals with periodontal disease have\nbeen consistently shown to exhibit ele-\nvated levels of systemic inflammation (2).\nMoreover, periodontal therapy has re-\nsulted in changes in systemic monocytic\ngene expression (11) and decreases in sys-\ntemic inflammation (12).\nWe are unaware of any studies that\nhave assessed the association between\nbaseline clinical periodontal disease and\nrisk of subsequent diabetes in an initially\ndiabetes-free cohort. Studies of this na-\nture are important as they can clarify the\ntemporality of periodontal disease/type 2\ndiabetes associations We hypothesized\nthat baseline periodontal disease pre-\ndicted incident type 2 diabetes in the First\nNational Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey (NHANES I) and its Epidemi-\nologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS).\nMETHODS -- Details concerning the\ndesign of NHANES I and NHEFS have\nbeen published previously (5,13).\nNHANES I was a national probability\nsample of the noninstitutionalized U.S.\npopulation aged 1\u00ad74 years, conducted\ndinal study including all individuals ini-\nmedical examination in NHANES I (n \ndesign and data collection procedures de-\nthe exceptions that a 30-min computer-\n                                                \nFrom the 1Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York,\nNew York; the 2Division of Epidemiology and Community Health, School of Public Health, University of\nMinnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the Department of Nutrition, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway;\nand 3Institut National de la Sante\n\u00b4 et de la Recherche Me\n\u00b4dicale and Unite\nUniversite Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris6, Paris, France.\nCorresponding author: Ryan Demmer, rtd2106@columbia.edu.\nThese data originate from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention.

The periodontal index\n(15) was used to assess the presence/\nabsence of periodontal disease for each\ntooth by assigning scores based on gingi-\nval inflammation extent, the presence or\nabsence of periodontal pockets, and tooth\nmobility as follows: 1) no periodontal dis-\nease (score  0): neither overt inflamma-\ntion in the investing tissues nor loss of\nfunction due to supporting tissue destruc-\ntion; 2) mild gingivitis (score  1): an\novert area of inflammation in the free gin-\ngivae, not circumscribing the tooth; 3)\ngingivitis (score  2): inflammation com-\npletely circumscribing the tooth with no\napparent break in the epithelial attach-\nment; 4) gingivitis with pocket formation\n(score  6): epithelial attachment had\nbeen broken and there was a pocket (not\nmerely a deepened gingival crevice due to\nswelling in the free gingivae), there was\nno interference with normal masticator\nfunction, and the tooth was firm in its\nsocket and had not drifted; and 5) ad-\nvanced destruction with loss of masticator\nfunction (score  8): the tooth was either\nloose, had drifted, or sounded dull on\npercussion with a metallic instrument. If\nthe examiner was equivocal regarding the\nappropriate score, the lesser score was as-\nsigned. All present teeth, excluding roots,\nwere scored. The periodontal index re-\nflects the within-mouth arithmetic aver-\nage of scores for all teeth (periodontal\nindex range is continuous from 0 to 8.0).\nFor dentate participants, each poten-\ntial tooth in the dentition was classified as\nbeing decayed (D), missing due to caries\n(M), or filled without decay (F). These\nvalues were summed per person to create\nan index (DMF) reflective of historical\ncaries experience. The range of possible\nIncident diabetes\nIncident diabetes was defined by 1) death\ncertificate (ICD-9 code in the range of\nlisted on the death certificate), 2) self-\nreported physician diagnosis requiring\npharmacological treatment (participants\nreporting physician-diagnosed diabetes\nand dietary intervention but not pharma-\ncological intervention were not consid-\nered to have developed incident diabetes\nto enhance outcome specificity), or 3)\nhealth care facility stay with a discharge\ndiagnosis of diabetes.\nCovariate data collection\nPotential confounding variables related to\ndiabetes risk and/or indicative of healthy\nlifestyle were collected during the base-\nline evaluation and included age, sex, race\n(African American, Caucasian, or other),\npoverty index (total household income in\nthe numerator and total income necessary\nto maintain the family on a nutritionally\nadequate food plan in the denominator;\nvalues 1 indicate incomes above pov-\nerty), education level (completed 8th\ngrade, 9th\u00ad12th grade, or some college or\ncollege graduate), BMI (weight in kilo-\ngrams divided by height in meters\nsquared), subscapular and triceps skin-\nfold, physical activity as described previ-\nously (15), total cholesterol, systolic\nblood pressure, diastolic blood pressure,\nand hypertension (systolic blood pressure\nself-reported medication for high blood\npressure).

A sin-\ngle 24-h dietary recall was obtained.\nStatistical analysis\nPeriodontal disease was defined in three\nways. The primary definition classified\nparticipants into six categories using the\nperiodontal index as follows.

Par-\nticipants were categorized as follows: 1)\nLogistic regression analysis was used\nto assess the association between baseline\nperiodontal disease and the cumulative\nincidence of diabetes. The SURVEYLO-\nGISTIC procedure in SAS (version 9.1;\nSAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used to ap-\npropriately account for the stratification,\nclustering, and sample weights of\nNHANES I. Incidence density of diabetes\nwas not considered because of uncer-\ntainty in diabetes onset timing, as dis-\ncussed previously (18). Multiple models\nwith various degrees of covariate adjust-\nment are presented to provide clarity re-\ngarding confounding by design variables\n(age, sex, and race), socioeconomic status\n(education and poverty index), health be-\nhaviors (smoking status, physical activity,\nand diet), general vascular health status\n(hypertension and total cholesterol),\nand/or obesity (BMI and skinfold). For\nthe present analysis, smoking was defined\nin four categories: 1) current, 2) former, 3)\nnever, or 4) reported history of smoking,\ncurrent status unknown. The creation of\nthe fourth smoking category avoids the\nelimination of those participants from the\nPeriodontal disease and type 2 diabetes\nanalysis and prevents biasing parameter\nestimates for current (underestimation of\nsmoking risk) or former (overestimation\nof smoking risk) smokers. Removing ev-\ner-smokers with unknown current status\ndid not change the results.\nA control analysis was performed to\nassess the association between caries\n(DMF) and cumulative incidence of dia-\nbetes. We hypothesized a priori that peri-\nodontal index but not DMF would be\npositively associated with incident diabe-\ntes. If these dual hypotheses were con-\nfirmed, it would add specificity of the\nfindings to periodontal disease as op-\nposed to general oral health.\nRESULTS -- The mean  SD age of\n15% were black, and 1% were other.\nThose with periodontal disease tended to\nbe older, male, nonwhite, smokers, and of\nlower socioeconomic status as reported\npreviously (15) (Table A1 of the online\nappendix available at http://dx.doi.org/\nrange of mean periodontal index values\namong participants defined as having ei-\nther gingivitis (periodontal index range \nthe primary exposure definition catego-\nrizing participants into six categories\nbased on periodontal index values is more\nnuanced.\nDuring a follow-up period of 17  4\nabetes cases were reported (cumulative\nincidence  9%).

Dietary factors such as fat,\nprotein, or carbohydrate intake, as well as\ntotal caloric intake, did not attenuate the\nfindings, although we caution that dietary\ndata based on a single 24-h recall leave\nconsiderable room for residual con-\nfounding.

Alternatively, a relatively in-\ncreased prevalence of undiagnosed inci-\ndent diabetes among individuals in the\nhighest periodontal index categories\ncould also explain the leveling of odds in\nthese groups.\nThe observed intermediate type 2 di-\nabetes risk for edentulous participants is\nconsistent with the broader body of liter-\nature concerning periodontal disease and\nsystemic disease. Associations between\ntooth loss and systemic disease from both\nthe NHEFS and other populations tend to\nbe positive (6), and intermediate risk is\noften reported among edentulous partic-\nipants. Tooth loss might play an epidemi-\nologically confusing role in evaluation of\nsystemic disease hypotheses (6,21).\nTooth loss often acts concurrently as both\na consequence of chronic periodontal dis-\nease and a preventive measure for future\ninfectious exposure, therefore represent-\ning a mixture of risk and protection. Data\nfrom the Oral Infections and Vascular\nDisease Epidemiology Study (INVEST)\nshow the highest prevalence of carotid ar-\ntery plaque among participants with in-\ntermediate tooth loss, whereas carotid\nplaque prevalence remained elevated yet\nattenuated among edentulous partici-\npants (21). In contrast, participants in the\nStudy of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) be-\ncame edentulous later in life than INVEST\nparticipants (22), and the greatest extent\nof carotid atherosclerosis in SHIP was also\nobserved among edentulous participants\n(23). Taken together, these findings sug-\ngest that edentulism occurring earlier in\nlife might confer some protection against\natherosclerotic development by minimiz-\ning lifetime oral infectious exposure.\nIf confirmed, the present results\nmight have implications for ongoing re-\nsearch regarding periodontal disease and\ncardiovascular disease. Specifically, type\n2 diabetes might also be considered as a\nmediator, in addition to a confounder, of\nthese associations.\ncident type 2 diabetes odds associated\nwith periodontal disease is clinically rele-\nvant as it is comparable to the risk associ-\nated with other type 2 diabetes risk\nfactors. For example, in agreement with\nprevious research (18) we report that a\n2-SD increase in either BMI or subscapu-\nlar skinfold is associated with an approx-\nimate 100% increase in incident diabetes\nodds,whereasbeinghypertensiveorhaving\n10 additional years of age increased dia-\nAlthough the sex interaction in this\nTable 3--ORs (95% CI) for incident diabetes by category of baseline periodontal index among selected subgroups: NHANES I and NHEFS, 1971\u00ad1974 through 1992\nSubgroup n Category PI0 Category PI1 Category PI2 Category PI3 Category PI4 Category PI5 Edentulous\nSmoking*\nAge\nBMI\nSex\nRace\u00a7\n*Adjusted for age, sex, race, education, BMI, subscapular skinfold, physical activity level, hypertension, and total cholesterol.

Because of the\nhigh prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes\nin the general population (24), the poten-\ntial for reverse causality (undiagnosed di-\nabetes at baseline causes periodontitis,\nbut the diabetes is later discovered and\nthought to be incident) exists. This possi-\nbility was minimized by 1) removing in-\ncident diabetes cases occurring within 1\nyear of baseline from all analyses and 2)\nconducting a subgroup analysis restricted\nto incident diabetes occurring 10 years\nafter baseline, because most individuals\nwith diabetes would probably become\nsymptomatic within 10 years. Similarly,\nthe potential for diagnostic bias during\nfollow-up to explain these findings is un-\nlikely. For this bias to remove our finding,\nthe rate of undiagnosed diabetes would\nhave to be substantially higher among pe-\nriodontally healthy (our reference group)\nindividuals relative to those with ad-\nvanced periodontal disease, thus artifi-\ncially reducing diabetes incidence among\nindividuals without periodontal disease.\nAlthough not impossible, this possibility\nseems unlikely because the probability of\nundiagnosed diabetes in NHANES III has\nbeen reported to be higher among indi-\nviduals with as opposed to those without\nperiodontitis (25). Further, according to\npreviously published NHANES data, the\nprobability of undiagnosed diabetes is\nhighest among groups with elevated type\n2 diabetes risk factors (24). In the present\nreport, participants with advanced peri-\nodontal disease also had elevated type 2\ndiabetes risk factors. Therefore, it is more\nlikely that participants with periodontal\ndisease experienced a higher rate of undi-\nagnosed diabetes during follow-up than\nperiodontally healthy participants. If so,\nthis occurrence would bias results toward\nthe null. An adverse family history or\ncommon genetic susceptibility underly-\ning both periodontal disease and type 2\ndiabetes also remains as a possible expla-\nnation for our findings. We were unable\nto account for this potential as neither ge-\nnetic data nor information regarding a\nfamily history of periodontal disease and\ndiabetes were collected in NHANES I.\nStudies with more precise measures\nof infectious exposure can increase our\nunderstanding of the association between\nbacteria-induced periodontal disease and\ndiabetes, as was recently done for cardio-\nvascular disease outcomes (26). Never-\ntheless, the observations that both clinical\nperiodontal disease and tooth loss, but\nnot the DMF index, were associated with\nincident type 2 diabetes bolster the\nchronic periodontal infection hypothesis.\nWe have found baseline periodontal\ndisease to be a clinically relevant and\nnovel predictor of incident type 2 diabetes\nin a large, population-based sample rep-\nresentative of U.S. adults. The prediction\nof type 2 diabetes from periodontal dis-\nease was not explained by confounding\nrelated to known diabetes risk factors and\ncould reflect a shared biological pathway,\nsuch as chronic low-grade inflammation.\nNevertheless, these findings require con-\nfirmation in populations with fasting glu-\ncose or A1C measurements to definitively\nrule out diagnostic bias. If confirmed, a\ncontributory role of periodontal disease\nin the development of type 2 diabetes is\npotentially of public health importance\nbecause of the prevalence of treatable\nperiodontal diseases in the population\n(27) and the pervasiveness of diabetes-\nassociated morbidity and mortality.\n"
