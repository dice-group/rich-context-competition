Because little is known about this\nissue, our objective was to compare secular trends in the prevalence\nof obesity and abdominal obesity among hypertensive and\nnonhypertensive adults in the United States.\nMethods\nWe used data from adults aged 18\u00ad74 years who participated in\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANESs)\nResults\nAmong adults with hypertension, the age-adjusted mean body\nwithout hypertension, mean body mass index increased from 24.2\u00ad\nhypertension exceeded that among men with hypertension during\n56.4% (s.e. 3.4) of women with hypertension were obese compared\nwith 46.9% (s.e. 2.1) of men.

For all three surveys, we\ncounted participants who reported currently using an anti-\nhypertensive medication from the following questions as\nhaving hypertension:\nNHANES II: Are you now taking any medicine prescribed\nby a doctor for your (high blood pressure/hypertension)?\nNHANES III: Because of your (high blood pressure/hyper-\ntension), have you ever been told by a doctor or other health\nprofessional to take prescribed medicine?

However,\nbecause the baseline prevalence of obesity was much higher\namong adults with hypertension than among those without\nhypertension, the relative increase in the prevalence of obesity\namong adults with hypertension (98%) was smaller than that\namong those without hypertension (199%). Among men and\nwomen, the gap in mean body mass index between participants\nwith hypertension and those without it tended to widen from\nthereafter. Among African-American men, however, the gap\nin mean body mass index between participants with hyperten-\nsion and those without it progressively widened whereas the\ngap among African-American women narrowed during the\nstudy period.\nThese trends in the prevalence of obesity are troubling\nbecause weight management is a key strategy in controlling\nhypertension. Some patients with adequate weight control\ncould potentially free themselves of having to use antihyper-\ntensive medication. Others could reduce the number and doses\nof medications.16 A recent meta-analysis estimated that for\nevery kilogram of weight loss, systolic blood pressure would\nand diastolic blood pressure would decrease by 0.92mmHg\nAlthough the ultimate responsibility for achieving a healthy\nweight rests with the patient, the patient's family, clinicians, and\nothers can play major supportive roles. For those who should\nlose weight, negative energy balance must be accomplished\nthrough limiting energy intake, increasing energy expendi-\nture in the absence of contraindications, or both. The National\nWeight Loss Registry demonstrated that those who were suc-\ncessful in maintaining long-term weight loss tended to consume\nlow-fat diets, monitor their body weight and food intake fre-\nquently, engage in high levels of physical activity, and minimize\nwatching television.18,19 Clinicians can make major contribu-\ntions to the welfare of their hypertensive patients by assessing\ntheir patients' dietary habits and physical activity habits as well\nas by providing appropriate counseling and referrals. When\nnonpharmacologic approaches fail to achieve desired results,\nclinicians can judiciously prescribe medication to help promote\nweight loss. Bariatric surgery for patients with an appropri-\nate indication can have a major beneficial impact not only on\nbody weight but on hypertension as well.20 For those who are\nemployed, worksite health promotion programs can provide\nopportunities for weight control.21 On a societal level, making\nthe physical environment conducive to the promotion of ade-\nquate physical activity provides opportunities for all, including\nthose who have hypertension, to help manage their weight.22\nThe Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on\nPrevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High\nBlood Pressure (JNC7) recommends that patients with hyper-\nThis recommendation is supported by a statement from the\nAmerican Heart Association.24 For patients who are unable to\nachieve a body mass index in this range, however, weight loss on\nthe order of magnitude of 10% can result in favorable changes in\nblood pressure.
