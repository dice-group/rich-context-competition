The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a new pheromone product in reducing\naggression between housemate cats.\nMethods A new pheromone product (Feliway Friends) containing a proprietary cat-appeasing pheromone was\nevaluated for efficacy in reducing aggression between housemate cats via a randomized, double-blind, placebo-\ncontrolled pilot trial of 45 multi-cat households (pheromone [n = 20], placebo [n = 25]) reporting aggression for at\nleast 2 weeks. Each household had 2\u00ad5 cats. Participants attended an educational training meeting on day (D) \u00ad7\nand the veterinary behaviorist described behaviors to be monitored for 7 weeks using the Oakland Feline Social\nInteraction Scale (OFSIS), which assessed the frequency and intensity of 12 representative aggressive interactions.\nParticipants were also provided with instructions for handling aggressive events, including classical conditioning,\nredirection by positive reinforcement and not punishing or startling the cat for aggressive displays. Punishment\ntechniques were strongly discouraged. Plug-in diffusers with the pheromone product or placebo were utilized from\nD0\u00adD28. Participants completed a daily diary of aggressive events and weekly OFSIS assessments through to D42.\nResults Evolution of the OFSIS\u00adAggression score according to treatment group in the full analysis set population\nrevealed a significant effect on time and treatment group. The OFSIS\u00adAggression score decreased over time from\nD0\u00adD28 in both groups (time factor P = 0.0001) with a significant difference in favor of the verum P = 0.06); similar\nConclusions and relevance The OFSIS provided a quantifiable measure of the frequency and intensity of 12 inter-\ncat interactions reflecting conflict between cats.

Cats are\nsocially flexible and may be quite independent or live in\nclose contact. Feline social interactions are influenced by\nmany factors such as their early social experiences and\nthe availability of resources. They are committed carni-\nvores and driven by independent urges to stalk, catch or\nkill their prey. Such characteristics mean the domestic cat\ndoes not require coordinated hunting with other\nfelids.2,5,6 While cats are capable of complex social behav-\niors and do form strong social bonds with familiar or\nrelated cats, they often do not eagerly accept an unfamil-\niar cat. Close affiliative socially bonded feline friend-\nships are characterized by co-sleeping, nose touching\nand allogrooming \u00ad behaviors most often expressed by\ncats that have known each other since kittenhood.2,5,6\nHowever, some cats are forced to live together with-\nout the ability to leave a social group created by their\nowners that is not to their liking. Aggression and social\ntension among housemate cats is common and puts cats\nat risk of injury or relinquishment.7 In such cases, they\nmay display a wide range of overt or passive aggressive\ndistance-increasing behaviors. Overt displays of aggres-\nsion include growling, hissing, screaming, spitting,\nattacking, chasing and biting.8 Passive displays include\nstaring, blocking and hiding. In order to avoid conflict\nsome cats choose to run away, hide or spend more time\navoiding direct interactions. Cats that live indoors may\ndistribute themselves within the home or may even\nfavor going outdoors. Cats that are outdoors have\ngreater opportunity to disperse themselves. Once con-\nflicts occur, cats may continue to exist in a tense social\nsituation for months or years, which affects their daily\nwelfare, increases stress and reduces freedom to access\nresources without fear of confrontation. Harmony in any\nhousehold is desirable and a cat that does not get along\nwith a housemate cat faces a greater risk of relinquish-\nment, daily stresses and potential for injury. In addition,\nthere are cats living in shelters that would be candidates\nto be added to homes if owners could be sure their cats\nwould get along. The wellbeing of millions of cats may\nbe enhanced if cats got along with housemate cats.\nDomestic canids have well developed social relation-\nships and the appeasement behaviors to maintain them\nwith a minimum of conflict, whereas felids' natural social\ngroups and relationships are based on matrilineal bonds\nand preferred associates. Felids, from house cats to chee-\ntahs, generally prefer to avoid other cats except when\nparenting or when sexually attracted.8,9 As cats are not\ndependent on social relationships to hunt cooperatively,\nthey are not required to reconcile following agonistic\ninteractions. They therefore almost uniformly lack\nappeasement and reconciliative behaviors.8,9 When cats\nare forced into involuntary interaction, they prefer to\navoid direct physical conflict.6,10 The cost vs benefit ratio\nof such events is high and risk of injury great. However,\nlacking the methods of appeasement common in dogs\n(eg, averted gaze, rolling on the back, licking the face,\nsubmissive urination), feline intra-specific aggression\nmay quickly escalate to a serious physical or vocal con-\nfrontation. According to a 2016 literature review by the\nAmerican Veterinary Medical Association on the welfare\nimplications of declawing of domestic cats, there was not\nstrong evidence that declawing increases the risk of\nundesirable behaviors or decreases the observance of\ndesirable behaviors.11 However, a recent telephone sur-\nvey suggests a higher incidence of elimination misbehav-\niors by cats that are declawed.12 Moreover, a recent\nretrospective study also identified that onychectomy\n(declawing) could affect feline behavior, with signifi-\ncantly increased odds of aggression in declawed cats\nwith radiographic evidence of residual P3 fragments, and\neven cats with no evidence of residual P3 had an increased\nKittens will form strong social relationships during\nthe `sensitive period' or the window of optimal socializa-\ntion that occurs between 2 and 7 weeks of age.14\nCuriously, during these first few weeks of age is the time\nof natural cat-appeasing pheromone release by the\nqueen; coincidentally or causally at a time when kittens\nare living in groups with very few conflicts and competi-\ntion. When they are adults, however, cats may not invest\nsignificant energy in maintaining social bonds or recon-\nciling broken bonds following conflict. Not all cats living\nwithin the same home may be members of the same\nsocial groups; there may be pairs or triads of cats that are\naffiliative and other individuals or dyads that are not.10\nInter-cat conflict may begin when cats are first intro-\nduced to one another, or it may develop among cats that\nformerly had good affiliative bonds. Conflict may\ndevelop abruptly following a specific incident (eg, the\nintroduction of a new pet in the home, one cat returning\nfrom a veterinary visit or a change at home that may\nhave had an impact on availability of resources such as\nfood or elimination places). Conflict may also develop\ngradually. The conflict may be obvious if cats are hissing,\nswatting, growling or screaming, or quite subtle, such\nthat passive avoidance may go unnoticed by even obser-\nvant owners.\nConflict between housemate cats may have elements\nof fear, anxiety, self-defense or territorial defense. Other\nbehavioral consequences may include urine retention,\nundesired elimination outside the litter box or urine\nmarking. 8,15\u00ad17 Medical consequences may include feline\nidiopathic cystitis.8,15 Some cats may face restricted\nDePorter et al 3\naccess to food owing to social conflicts and thus may\ngulp or overeat when they do eat, whereas other cats\nmay suffer weight loss.18\nTreatment of severe conflicts between house cats has\nbeen described as challenging and is often considered\ndifficult to completely resolve.8,15\u00ad17 Reported therapies\nrange from medications such as diazepam, clomi-\npramine, fluoxetine and buspirone to complex reintro-\nduction programs.8,15\u00ad17 While many cats that struggle\nwith conflicts may benefit from medications, it may be\ndifficult to administer oral medications and often own-\ners are hesitant to `drug' their cats. Management and\nbehavior modification strategies are tedious, time con-\nsuming and challenging for owners to implement with\nthe necessary consistency. Controlled reintroductions\nmay occur while one or more cats are observed, crate-\nconfined or harnessed. Such programs may be success-\nful, but may also be detrimental if carried out\nimproperly.8,15\u00ad17 Commonly recommended punishment\nstrategies for aggressive displays have included blasting\nfoghorns, spraying with water, yelling and clapping\nhands. All are more likely to startle the cats rather than\nfacilitate a peaceful reconciliation.8,15\u00ad17 Punishment\nstrategies do not create an atmosphere suitable for recon-\nciliation and a single traumatic interaction may reverse\nweeks or months of meticulous behavior modification\nand can be extremely frustrating for owners and the cats.\nCats, like most mammals, are able to communicate\nwith other members of the species by leaving and detect-\ning messages in the form of pheromones deposited in the\nenvironment.19\u00ad21 Pheromones are substances secreted\nfrom sebaceous mucous or sweat glands by an individ-\nual and received by others of the same species, in which\nit releases a specific reaction.19,20 Pheromones are classi-\nfied by their modes of action, rather than chemical com-\nposition. The chemical diversity of pheromones ranges\nfrom small, volatile molecules to sulfated steroids to\nlarge families of proteins.\nCats may deposit pheromones by leaving scents in\nthe environment by means of face rubbing (eg, facial\npheromones), urine marking or scratching on upright\nsurfaces (eg, feline interdigital semiochemical), whereas\nappeasing pheromones are released from the mammary\narea.19 Pheromones are then received by the vomerona-\nsal organ (VNO), a paired tubular structure located just\nabove the hard palate near the intranasal septum.19\u00ad21\nWhen pheromone molecules are first detected by a cat,\nfurther olfactory investigation occurs, which is charac-\nterized by a tongue lick to the nose, followed by the cat's\ngazing in a `thoughtful', `preoccupied' fashion while the\nupper lips are raised slightly and fluffed, with the mouth\nslightly open.22 This is called a flehmen response or\n`gape', which serves to facilitate gathering the phero-\necules then interact with receptors in the VNO, which\nstimulate structures within the limbic system to alter the\nanimal's emotional state or activate physiologic effects.\nFeline-appeasing pheromones are released by mam-\nmary sebaceous glands of the queen during the nursing\nperiod, appearing 3\u00ad4 days after parturition and persist-\ning until 2\u00ad5 days after the weaning of the kittens (2\u00ad3\nmonths maximum).19,20 These pheromones are most bio-\nlogically active during the socialization period and thus\nare likely to enhance bond formation while comforting\nand reassuring the neonates. A commercially available\nsynthetic copy of the dog appeasing pheromone (Adaptil,\npreviously known as DAP; Ceva Sant\u00e9 Animale) has\ndemonstrated calming properties in a variety of clinically\nand behaviorally relevant situations.23\u00ad31 Similarly to the\ndog appeasing pheromone, a synthetic analog of the\nfeline-appeasing pheromone has been developed, which\nis now commercially available (the formulation used in\nthis trial is currently commercially available as Feliway\nMultiCat in the USA and as Feliway Friends in Europe;\nCeva Sant\u00e9 Animale). One study demonstrated that\nmaternal pheromones reduced aggressive interactions\nduring a controlled exposure of dyads of adult cats.32\nCase reports have suggested an influence on feline\naggression between housemate cats.33,34 It is hypothe-\nsized that the addition of the synthetic pheromone to the\nenvironment in multi-cat households may reduce inter-\ncat aggression by enhancing social affiliations and\nincreasing the cats' sense of wellbeing. The present pilot\nstudy was intended to test this hypothesis.\nMaterials and methods\nA double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled field\ntrial was conducted to evaluate the clinical effectiveness\nof a 28 day treatment period with a proprietary synthetic\ncat-appeasing pheromone analog (Feliway Friends) in\nthe reduction of inter-cat aggression. The pheromone\n(2% w/w) solution and the equivalent placebo solution\nwithout the pheromone were provided with a pair of\nplug-in diffusers and a 50 ml flask containing 48 ml of\nthe respective test materials. The test article and the pla-\ncebo diffusers, flasks and solutions were identical in\nappearance.\nThe test unit was the individual household. Forty-five\nmulti-cat households of 2\u00ad5 cats each were enrolled.\nDemographic information regarding the duration and\nnature of the aggression, nature of onset (abrupt vs grad-\nual) and number of cats in the household was obtained.\nEach enrolled household was reported by the owner to\nhave a history of inter-cat aggression of at least 2 weeks'\nduration, as evidenced by at least one fight and four\naggressive encounters occurring within the previous 2\nweeks. Fights were described and defined by tense body\ntone, freezing, staring, agitated (angry) vocalizations\nand may have included a bite, scratch and physical con-\ntact such as swatting. Physical confrontations need not\n4 Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery\nnecessarily have resulted in injury. The cat's aggressive\nencounters (fights or displays) could include any of the\nfollowing signs: stalking, chasing, fleeing, hiding, swat-\nting, staring, blocking, growling, hissing, spitting,\ncrouching, tail twitching or tail puffing. Video examples\nwere shown to the volunteers to help them distinguish\nbetween fight encounters and play behaviors. Play was\ndescribed as being characterized by the cats' loose mus-\ncle tone, more physical contact, including gentle wrap-\nping of the paws, mock predatory pouncing, and\ninhibited mouthing and the lack of accompanying vocal-\nizations characteristic of aggression.\nRecruitment was a convenience sample of households\nin the Midwestern United States and potential partici-\npants were recruited by distribution of an information\nflyer describing the clinical trial. Social and broadcast\nmedia were also used to recruit potential cases, and fly-\ners were distributed. Interested cat owners who believed\nthey met the inclusion criteria contacted the behaviorist\nby telephone or via a study-dedicated email address.\nOwners were preliminarily screened by a checklist-\ndirected telephone interview to determine eligibility.\nTo complete enrollment in the study, owners were\nrequired to attend one of a series of scheduled meetings\nheld at Oakland Veterinary Referral Services (Bloomfield\nHills, MI, USA). Enrollment meetings consisted of a\nPowerPoint presentation on feline behavior and aggres-\nsion, as well as the particulars of the study (see Figure 1).\nAs transport of cats to the hospital may have increased\nstress, influenced patterns of social interactions or caused\ngeneral changes in activity, the owners were instructed\nnot to bring their cats to the meeting and no cats were\nevaluated directly by the investigators during the study.\nIncentives for participants consisted of a $50 gift card\nupon completion of the study and a gift of the pheromone\ntest product when it became commercially available.\nAll cats were at least 6 months of age at enrollment.\nNo restrictions were placed on breed or sex, but sexually\nintact males were excluded. All cats spent at least 16 h a\nday indoors with unrestricted access to common areas\nand each other throughout the home. Cats with a history\nof serious aggression towards humans and/or extreme\naggression toward other cats and cats with concomitant\nmedical conditions that may interfere with evaluation of\neffectiveness were excluded. No treatments with facial\npheromones or psychoactive nutraceuticals in the 4\nweeks prior to day 0 (D0) were allowed for any of the\ncats in the study. Households with cats receiving any\npsychotropic medications such as tricyclic antidepres-\nsants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or benzodi-\nazepines in the 3 months prior to D0 were likewise\nexcluded. Behavioral modification was not permitted,\nbeyond the instructions provided for handling aggres-\nsive events. Both the treatment and placebo groups were\nprovided the same recommendations.\nRandomization was based on order of attendance at the\nenrollment meeting; households were assigned to their\nrespective treatment groups (ie, either test article or pla-\ncebo) according to a simple, blocked, randomization list\nprovided by the study statistician. No stratification factors\nwere utilized. The test materials were provided by Ceva\nSant\u00e9Animale. Each cat owner was provided a single plas-\ntic bag containing two identical diffusers that were to be\nplugged in the home for a 28-day treatment period. Each\ndiffuser was labeled with a unique identification number\nconsisting of two digits according to the randomization\nlist, followed by the letter Aor B, indicating pairs of identi-\ncal treatment vials. The investigator and all support per-\nsonal at the enrollment center were completely masked to\ntreatment identity and treatment groups. Households\nwere provided with the test articles at the enrollment\nmeeting but were instructed not to install them for 1 week.\nDuring the enrollment meeting, training on the methods\nof behavioral evaluation to be used in the study was pro-\nvided; ie, the use of daily diaries and of a scale specifically\ndesigned to assess inter-cat aggressive interactions. Owners\nwere to use the same assessment tools throughout the\nstudy. Participants were also provided directions for han-\ndling aggressive events (see Appendix 1 in the supplemen-\ntary material), including classical conditioning, redirection\nby positive reinforcement and not punishing or startling\nfor aggressive displays. Additionally, owners were given\napproximately 90 mins of education on the interpretation\nof cat behavior, including videos of representative inter-cat\ninteractions to help owners accurately interpret their cats'\nbehavior over the course of the study. Owners were trained\nby the behaviorist through description and video illustra-\ntion to be able to better distinguish between affiliative inter-\ncat behaviors, neutral and passive, and overt aggressive\nbehaviors. Examples of positive inter-cat interactions\nincluded nose touching, allogrooming, co-sleeping with\nclose physical contact and tail-up greetings.\nDetailed instructions were provided regarding the\nuse of the diffusers. Each owner drew a diagram of their\nhome's floor plan and the areas in which the cats spent\nFigure 1 Volunteers attended an educational meeting at the\ntime of enrollment\nDePorter et al 5\ntheir time (see example in Figure 2). The optimal location\nfor each diffuser was selected by the investigator based\non the primary resting location for involved cats, avail-\nability of appropriate electrical outlets and avoidance of\nopen windows. Diffusers were plugged in from D0\u00adD28.\nOwners were asked to check the warmth and liquid vol-\nume in each diffuser weekly and this was confirmed by\nweekly telephone interview. To assess any potential\npost-treatment effect of the pheromone or regression fol-\nlowing withdrawal, assessments for each household\nwere continued for two additional weeks. Each house-\nhold's participation was complete upon conclusion of\nTwo types of assessment methods were used in the\nstudy: daily diary entries (from D\u00ad7 to D42) and the\nweekly Oakland Feline Social Interaction Scale (OFSIS)\nquestionnaire (see Appendix 2 in the supplementary\nmaterial). Daily dairy entries consisted of answering two\nquestions pertaining to the occurrence of aggressive\nevents or fights between the cats in the household,\nwhether they had aggressive encounters or fought that\nday, and, if so, how many times aggressive behaviors or\nfighting were observed. Owners were instructed to have\nthe same person complete the diary throughout the\nstudy, though input and observations from all family\nmembers were allowed. Owners were asked to fax or\nemail diaries weekly to the investigator.\nIn addition to the daily diary, a weekly questionnaire\nwas used to gain more specific data on the types of\naggressive interactions in the home. Beginning on D\u00ad7 at\nthe enrollment meeting, then weekly thereafter, owners\nwere asked to describe their cats' responses to house-\nmate cats and consider all interactions, which they could\nrecall for the previous week. Over the course of the\nstudy, owners were instructed not to change their typical\nroutines, but rather assess the level of aggressive interac-\ntions based upon their typical level of observation.\nThe weekly questionnaire used was designated the\nOakland Feline Social Interaction Scale (OFSIS)\u00ad\nAggression and was developed by the investigator spe-\ncifically for this study based on common owner-reported\nsigns of conflict and on a literature review. The scale\nwas used to provide a quantifiable measure of the fre-\nquency and intensity of 12 inter-cat interactions reflect-\ning conflict between cats. Development of this scale was\ninspired by the Lincoln Sound-sensitivity Scale, which\nutilizes a quantifiable measure of the frequency and\nintensity of signs of noise-related fears.19 OFSIS included\nincidence (yes/no), frequency (how often observed)\nand intensity (magnitude of response) for each behavior\nrelating to level of aggression between housemate cats.\nThe primary outcome measure for each household was\nthe OFSIS\u00adAggression score, which was calculated\nusing the following formula: OFSIS aggression score\n(frequency[Qi\n]*intensity[Qi\n]) where, Dx =\n=\nquestions 1\u00ad12 of the OFSIS questionnaire (first section;\nsee Appendix 2 in supplementary material). The\nFigure 2 Typical household diagram with cats' preferred resting areas and diffuser placement\n6 Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery\npotential OFSIS\u00adAggression scores for each household\nranged from 0 (no aggressive behaviors at all recorded\non the scale) to 360 (each parameter was scored maxi-\nmally). As the OFSIS was to serve as an assessment of\ninter-cat aggression across all cats in the home, a single\nscore for each question applied to the home, not to a\nspecific cat, and each score was to be made according to\nthe most extreme manifestation among their household\ncats. The 12 behaviors described in the OFSIS question-\nnaire (see Appendix 2 in the supplementary material)\ncould further be classified by the predominant offensive\nor fearful manifestations of conflict-related behaviors \u00ad\nwhich could be displayed by any cats in the home. To\nfurther illustrate affiliative behaviors, the weekly ques-\ntionnaires also included questions on harmony, which\nrepresented how well the cats were getting along with\neach other and family members.\nOFSIS questionnaires were completed in person at the\nenrollment meeting. OFSIS assessments and the daily\nand D28. Any concerns were clarified during the tele-\nphone interview. On D28, owners were also asked\n`Generally, do you find your cats are getting along bet-\nter?'. A trained technician conducted the phone inter-\nviews and recorded a yes/no polar conclusion. Upon\nconclusion of the D28 telephone interview, owners were\ninstructed to remove the diffusers. To assess any poten-\ntial post-treatment effect of the pheromone, daily diaries\nwere maintained and two additional weekly OFSIS tele-\nphone interviews were conducted on D35 and D42.\nStatistical analysis\nWe used SAS 9.3 software (SAS Institute) for the statisti-\ncal analyses. Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD or n\n(%). Tests were two-sided and as this was a pilot study\nthe significance threshold was set at 0.10. The experi-\nmental unit was the household and the sample size was\n45 enrolled households. Baseline characteristics were\ncompared between the two treatment groups. When a\nclinical difference was found, the difference was tested\n(Fisher's exact test). The main analysis was conducted\non repeated measures from D0\u00adD28. A generalized lin-\near mixed model (GLIMMIX) for repeated measures was\nbuilt with comparing the proprietary cat-appeasing\npheromone product vs placebo, assessment points, inter-\naction study pheromone by assessment point and base-\nline as fixed factors. As the group by assessment point\ninteraction was not significant, the interaction was\nskipped from further models. The analyses were per-\nformed for both the full analysis set (FAS) and the per\nprotocol (PP) set, with the analysis of the PP population\nbeing used in a robustness purpose (Figure 3). Owing to\nthe very low number of cases with a major deviation, the\nother parameters were analyzed on the FAS population\nonly. As the overall results of the FAS and the PP popula-\ntions were similar, herein only results from the FAS pop-\nulation are presented. The impact of the number of cats\nin the household was analyzed in a mixed model with\nstudy pheromone and assessment point as fixed factors.\nRandom factors were the number of cats in the house-\nhold and interaction between the number of cats and\ngroup. As this interaction was found to be non-signifi-\ncant, it was removed from the model, which only\nincluded treatment group, baseline values and assess-\nment date. In addition, the evolution from D0\u00adD42 was\ncompared between study pheromone using a mixed\nmodel for repeated measures.\nResults\nOf the 45 households that provided informed consent, 20\nwere enrolled in the treatment group and 25 in the pla-\ncebo group (corresponding to the FAS). Forty-two house-\nholds completed the study, 17 in the treatment group\nand 25 in the placebo group (corresponding to the PP\npopulation). A simple randomization list was utilized,\nwhich was balanced on blocks of cases with an antici-\npated total of 60 cases, but enrollment was ceased at 45\nsubjects, which resulted in uneven groups. There were\nthree cases of major deviations and all were in the treat-\nment group: one family found and introduced a kitten\ninto the household, one household did not comply with\nrequired follow-up and one owner elected to discon-\ntinue participation when the aggression resolved but the\nFigure 3 Definition of the analyzed populations.

In all three deviations, the level of con-\nflict was reported to be improving. No treatment-related\nadverse events were reported. At D0, there were no dif-\nferences between the two treatment groups (whether\nconsidering FAS or PP populations), except for the num-\nber of cats in each household. There were more two-cat\nhouseholds and fewer four- and five-cat households in\nthe pheromone-treated group than in the placebo group\n(Table 1). The difference in number of cats per household\nwas significant in the FAS population (P = 0.04) while\ntrending similarly in the PP population (P = 0.09).\nThe resulting OFSIS\u00adAggression scores (possible\nvalues were highly correlated between groups on both\nD\u00ad7 and D0. During the enrollment period (D\u00ad7 to D0),\nthe OFSIS\u00adAggression score decreased similarly in both\ngroups. During the treatment period (D0\u00adD28), the\nOFSIS\u00adAggression score continued to decrease in both\ngroups, but the decrease was greater in the appeasing\npheromone group than in the placebo group. Separation\nof the group means by treatment was apparent by D7,\nreaching a distinguishable improvement by D14 (P =\n0.0833). Mean OFSIS scores reached the highest differ-\nence and were significantly different by group on D21 (P\non D28 and each household was followed for an addi-\ntional 2 weeks. Differences between treatment group\nmeans persisted during this post-treatment observation\nperiod with the treatment group OFSIS scores compara-\ntively stable, while the placebo group mean slowly\nbegan to regress (showing worsening conflict).\nStatistically, there was a trend at D35 (P = 0.12) and sig-\nanalysis was performed on all treatment points collec-\ntively from D0\u00adD42 the difference between treatment\nand placebo was statistically significant (P = 0.0431).\nAt inclusion (D\u00ad7) all 12 aggressive behaviors (Table 3)\nwere represented in all included households, with 8/12\naggressive behaviors described in the OFSIS question-\nnaire (staring, stalking, chasing, fleeing, crouching,\nhissing/growling/spitting, tail twitching/lashing and\nblocking) displayed in more than 75% of the homes.

This meant that the unequal num-\nber of cats per home did not have an impact on the\nresults. Consequently, this interaction was removed\nfrom the statistical model, which only included treat-\nment group, baseline values and assessment date.\nVariables such as the square footage of a home, the\nnumber of floors of a home and the areas to which cats\nhave access are not easily controlled and may be useful\ndata to collect but are difficult to interpret in a study of\nthis size. According to 2013 US Census information the\naverage home in the USA was reported to be 1500 square\nfeet, with homes in the Midwest average ranging from\nfeet (see Table 4), consistent with the common assertion\nthat less available territory is consistent with mainte-\nnance of feline conflict. The availability and distribution\nof cat's resources in the home is a key element of inter-\ncat relationship factors, but they are difficult to assess in\nthis type of study. Home size is also consistent with\npackage directions that at least two diffusers should be\nprovided to cover the size of these homes.\nConflict between housemate cats is generally consid-\nered to have a poor prognosis for successful alleviation\nof the signs of conflict, occurrence of reconciliation and\ndevelopment of affiliative bonds between housemate\ncats. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized and\nplacebo-controlled study to evaluate a treatment inter-\nvention in households with inter-cat aggression. In this\nstudy a synthetic analog of an appeasing pheromone\nwas hypothesized to influence social bonding based on\nthe natural occurrence of high levels of cat-appeasing\npheromones delivered from the queen prior to and\nsimultaneous to the occurrence of the socialization win-\ndow. The primary investigator (TLD) speculated that\nthere may be a natural and causal relationship between\nthe presence of appeasing pheromones and the enhance-\nment of social interactions. Thus, we speculate that the\nbeneficial effect on social interactions is achieved by sim-\nilar mechanisms as during the natural pliable socializa-\ntion window.\nAs inter-cat aggression has been insufficiently studied,\nthe primary investigator (TLD) was required to develop a\nuseful metric to assess the frequency and severity of\naggression within the home. The OFSIS captures the fre-\nquency and intensity of 12 behaviors reflecting inter-cat\naggression, and the total OFSIS score was formed by the\nsummation of the 12 scores. Thus, the OFSIS score could\ntheoretically range from 0 for cats that exhibited none of\nthe listed aggressive behaviors to 360 for homes where\ncats exhibited the entire constellation of listed behaviors\nwith maximum frequency and intensity.\nThe predominant limitation of the OFSIS is that it\nrelies entirely upon owner interpretation, making\nvalidation complicated. Future studies should include\nvalidation by either a test\u00adretest reliability or an inter-\nrater reliability assessment. Low-level or passive aggres-\nsion is likely to be under-reported or under-represented.\nModerate or extreme overt aggression would be clear\nbut could result in a higher rate of relinquishment, and\nthus cats with extremely high OFSIS scores are also\npotentially under-represented. The owner's perception\nof conflict is actually a pivotal factor as the owner may\nresolve to relinquish a cat that poses the greatest risk to a\ncat's welfare and wellbeing. Although the volunteers did\nrecord the number of fights and aggressive encounters\nper day, these parameters were not useful in analysis as\nthese did not successfully quantify the severity. Owner\ninterpretation of `fights' did vary as the aggressive\nencounters ranged from passive staring to fights. Some\nowners reported finding tufts of fur. Thus, there were\ndifferences between the initial weekly number of fights\nand weekly number of aggressive encounters in both\ngroups (at D0), making this parameter less relevant for\nanalysis, whereas the OFSIS scores, reflecting globally all\naspects of the conflict, were similar at baseline.\nAnalysis of the scale's component questions was per-\nformed to reveal if simplification of the scale was appro-\npriate and it was determined the scale was most useful\nin its entirety. When the 12 questions were assessed sepa-\nrately for frequency and intensity the results were not\nmore discriminating: all of the questions were repre-\nsented at inclusion (Table 3), and all 12 decreased in fre-\nquency and intensity throughout the study period,\nregardless of their initial incidence, differently between\nthe two groups. For example, `fleeing from housemate\ncats', a very frequent sign reported in 90% of appeasing\npheromone homes and 88% of placebo homes at D0, was\nwhereas `screaming', only reported by 40% of appeasing\npheromone homes and 48% of placebo homes at D0,\nthe manifestation of conflict may vary between different\nhouseholds, the composite design of the scale accounted\nfor this expected variability by quantifying each behav-\nior associated with inter-cat conflict (eg, staring vs stalk-\ning vs biting) while simultaneously qualifying the\nintensity. The scale was intended to capture changes in\nthese parameters over time and, potentially, in response\nto treatment, realizing that certain aggressive behaviors\nmay change in intensity or frequency or both. The\naggressive behavior may be considered as a matrix of\nfrequency vs intensity of signs of conflict and provided a\nrange of options for owner reporting.\nAs a practical matter, the households in the study\nclustered around the lower half of the scale, indicating\nthat cats tended to exhibit several behaviors, but not all\nbehaviors, and that the most extreme cases were not rep-\nresented, partially because they were purposely excluded\nfrom the study for safety and welfare reasons. As feline\ninteractions change there is also a change in the manifes-\ntation of signs as some cats were hiding at the onset of\nthe study and thus rarely present to participate in more\npassive behaviors such as staring or blocking.\nThe strength of the above approach is that it captured a\nvariety of data across the multidimensional nature of\naggression. A potential weakness, however, is that the\nscale gives equal weight to each possible behavior. In raw\nnumerical terms, a household with cats that have frequent\nepisodes of intense fighting may be given a score equal to\nanother home where the cats do not fight at all but have\nfrequent episodes of intense staring or stalking. Both con-\nditions represent an adverse impact on the cats' welfare.\nWhether these situations are, in fact, `behaviorally equiva-\nlent' is an open question, but the scale assumes they are.\nThe OFSIS should be qualified by a test and retest statisti-\ncal approach as validation by any `gold-standard' diagno-\nsis is not possible and all diagnosis will rely on the\nclinician's interpretation of owner descriptions.\nThe households enrolled in the study all had inter-cat\naggression evaluated on D\u00ad7; however, most experi-\nenced a drop in the OFSIS score prior to D0, in the\nabsence of any treatment. It is possible the owners over-\nreported the level of aggression that had occurred in the\n7 days prior. Though repeatedly reminded to consider\nonly the immediate prior 7 day period, owners were\nmotivated to participate and concerned about their cats\nwelfare regarding a problem that had existed, in some\ncases, for months or years. Given the consistency of this\nobservation across the households, the authors attribute\nthis drop \u00ad in the absence of contrary evidence \u00ad to the\neffects of the training session with the behaviorist and\nprimary investigator on D\u00ad7. Merely understanding the\nreasons why cats may act out with aggression may have\nreduced the owner's perception of the signs of conflict.\nFurther, changing the strategies from a punitive-based to\na positive reinforcement-based approach may have\nimmediately reduced stress for the owners and the cats.\nIt seems instinctive for owners to wish to intervene in\nwhatever manner is effective to stop an aggressive event\nbetween cats. Even many veterinarians have recom-\nmended the use of distractors such as spray bottles, and\nloud noises in order to stop an aggressive event. While\nthese interventions may result in a temporary victory, it\nis often pyrrhic and short lived. Cats typically resume\ntheir aggressive behavior when what they perceive as\nthe greater threat (eg, the water bottle or the noise) is\ndissipated. Aggressive behaviors should be redirected\nwhenever feasible by using positive reinforcement and\ncues. As owners were instructed to implement such\nchanges, the decrease in OFSIS score prior to D0 seems\nattributable to the change in intervention tactics.\nAn interesting finding was the improvement of the\nOFSIS\u00adAggression score before treatment, D\u00ad7 to D0, in\nboth groups (Figure 4). During the initial training meet-\ning, at least one representative from each household was\ngiven instruction on cat behavior and how to appropri-\nately and effectively intervene when inter-cat aggression\narose. Punishment was discouraged (eg, spraying cats\nwith water) and positive redirection strategies (eg, food)\nwere suggested. This change in management at home\nmay be sufficient to explain the drop in mean scores\nbetween D\u00ad7 and D0, irrespective of group. These man-\nagement strategies, while confounding, were under-\ntaken in consideration for the welfare of the cats and\nbecause most interventions that reduce anxiety may be\nless effective if punishment is imposed. This may have\ncontributed to a relevant portion of the improvement\nseen in both groups throughout the study. However,\nunexpectedly after the treatment period, the OFSIS score\nin the treatment group remained stable while the aggres-\nsion score in the placebo group began to rise (Figure 4).\nThe authors postulate that the pheromone treatment\nenhanced the affected cats' learning ability and initiated\na new balance, so-called reconciliation, in their social\ninteractions, resulting in a more persistent behavioral\nchange after the treatment was withdrawn on D28\n(Figure 4). While it is interesting that cats in pheromone-\ntreated households continued to improve (as demon-\nstrated by the OFSIS score) during the brief 2 week\npost-treatment period, this short period is insufficient to\ndraw a long-term conclusion. Perhaps long-term treat-\nment with pheromones may be beneficial but may not\nalways be required, as cats that learn how to `get along'\nmay retain that ability, but this is beyond the scope of\nthis study. It is uncertain whether any post-treatment\neffect would be reduced by changes in the home such as\nintroduction or removal of animals, a member of the\nfamily moving in or out, or movement of the entire\nhousehold; all of which are known to affect feline behav-\nior and, potentially, inter-cat aggression. Future studies\nshould examine a longer post-treatment period.\nDifference between groups was found to be statisti-\ncally significant over the full study period (D0\u00adD42). The\nhighest differences between groups occurred at D14,\nD21 and D42. The most important clinical effect for the\npheromone treatment seemed to occur within the first\n14\u00ad21 days. This time interval allows for saturation of\nthe environment by the diffusers, opportunity for the\ncats to have been sufficiently exposed to the phero-\nmones, modulation of each cat's perception and the\nimpact of learning/anticipation there may be a change\nin social interactions.\nWhile the OFSIS\u00adAggression proved discriminatory\nfor measuring conflict, the assessment of affiliative inter-\nactions by the OFSIS\u00adHarmony, as designed, was less\ninsightful. The harmony questions were complicated for\nclients to answer in multi-cat households, which included\nnot only populations of aggressive dyads, but also, in\nsome households, affiliative dyads. The OFSIS\u00adHarmony\nquestions were designed to ask about all cats in the home\nand not specific dyads. The question format (eg, `any of\n12 Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery\nyour cats' and `did all of your cats') proved very difficult\nfor owners to answer. Further, some behaviors, such as\nsleeping in the same room together, occurred commonly\nin households but may not be a good measure of affilia-\ntive interactions in cats as some cats did not have another\noption for resting areas. The authors believe measuring\nan increase in harmonious interactions along with a con-\ncomitant decrease in inter-cat aggression would be useful\ninevaluatinginter-catbehaviors,buttheOFSIS\u00adHarmony\nquestions should be revised in future versions.\nEvaluation of the composition of homes with cats that\ndo not get along is intriguing, but interpretation has lim-\nitations as there are correlations that may not be causal.\nFurther, the population of cats that do not get along is\nplagued by a culling process: cats, both the aggressors\nand the victims, in highly volatile homes may be\nremoved by relinquishment, euthanasia or simply by\nescaping/running away. Factors that influence retention\nrather than relinquishment of a cat do have a dramatic\nimpact on human decisions: some cats were inherited\nfrom a loved one, whereas others were acquired from a\nbreeder, and these factors may impact strongly on reten-\ntion, despite severe or persistent conflict. Sixty-two per-\ncent of the cats were noted to be aggressive after the cats\nhad been living together without apparent conflict,\nwhich suggests that either owners are unaware of the\nsigns of low-level conflict, or cats may become conflicted\nand not reconcile spontaneously.\nA surprising finding in this study (Table 4) was the\nunexpectedly high percentage of declawed cats: 47.4% vs\n24.4% declawed cats in the overall cat population of the\ntoward an adverse effect of declawing on feline social\nrelationships, these findings were not statistically signifi-\ncant. The investigator has completed two subsequent and\nsimilar studies on inter-cat conflicts, which are beyond\nthe scope of this paper. An analysis of these unpublished\nthe suggestion in the present study that there may be a\ncorrelation between declaw status and ongoing conflict\nbetween housemate cats. The investigator speculates that\ndeclaw status of either the aggressor or the victims may\nhave an impact on ongoing aggression. If sufficient\ndefense is not possible by the declawed cat, the threat of\ndangerous weapons is described as a primary ethological\nreason for the complex facial communications shared by\nall domestic and wild felids.9 This finding is confounded\nby multiple cats nested within households and it is\nunclear if cats were declawed as a result of the ongoing\nconflict or if the declawing preceded the onset of aggres-\nsion. Cats may be declawed much more commonly in the\nUSA than in other parts of the world.11 Regardless, the\nhigh percentage of cats that are declawed and in homes\nwith inter-cat aggression is an interesting finding which\nwarrants future investigation.\nConclusions\nIn this study, treatment with a proprietary cat-appeasing\npheromone diffuser for 4 weeks showed a beneficial\neffect in the management of feline aggression in multi-cat\nhouseholds. During the study, when cat owners were\neducated by a board-certified veterinary behaviorist\nabout feline behavior, provided instruction on handling\naggressive events and discouraged from punishing cats\n(eg, squirt guns or other startle methods), the level of\nconflict began to decrease even prior to implementation\nof the treatment.
