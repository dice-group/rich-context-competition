Mentors were expected to assume\nmultifaceted roles: guiding, supervising, counseling, over-\nseeing, modeling, supporting, critiquing, and instructing\n(Larkin, 2013). It is the experiences of students and mentors\nthat are the subject of this article.\nMuch has been documented about mentoring students on\nTP in extant literature (Aderibigbe, 2013; Kaasila &\nseemingly dominated by a focus on mentors and students'\nexperiences in isolation. Not much is known about mentor-\ning experiences of students and mentors during TP while\nstudents reside alongside the community, sharing residen-\ntial facilities with their peers and teacher educators in a\nrural context. Much less is known about how large student\ncohorts attached to one rural school and their respective\nmentors experience mentoring in such contexts. This makes\nthe study distinctive.\n1Durban University of Technology, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa\nCorresponding Author:\nTabitha Grace Mukeredzi, Durban University of Technology, Faculty of\nArts and Design, Adult Education Unit, Indumiso/Midlands Campus,\n15 JF Sithole Road, Imbali 3201, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.\nEmail: TabithaM@dut.ac.za\nMentoring in a Cohort Model of\nPracticum: Mentors and Preservice\nTeachers' Experiences in a Rural\nSouth African School\nTabitha Grace Mukeredzi1\n Keywords\ncohort, mentoring experiences, mentor, preservice teachers, rural school\n2 SAGE Open\nStudent mentoring during practicum constitutes a critical\nfactor in their professional learning and development.\nIngersoll and Strong (2011) point out that mentoring has a\npositive impact on commitment, classroom instructional\npractices, and student achievement. Larkin (2013) suggests\npractices for effective student teacher mentoring: not just\nleaving them alone, turning on the commentary track,1\nworking jointly to find creative outlets, modeling lessons,\nmodeling learning new content, joint planning and making\ntime to talk, connecting the student to the larger school\npolitical world, and treating TP as a learning opportunity,\nnot a performance. Ambrosetti and Dekkers (2010) add that\nmentoring is critical in enhancing students' opportunities to\nlearn to teach within teaching contexts. These authors also\nposit that such learning effectively occurs through lesson\nmodeling and observations, critical and constructive lesson\nevaluation, providing and discussing feedback, team teach-\ning, counseling and role modeling, critical friendship and\nequal partnering, and instructing and coaching. However,\nstudents view this process as the best way to acquire teacher\nprofessional knowledge and competence and it also pro-\nvides a \"protected\" opportunity for experimentation and\nsocialization within the profession (Leshem, 2012).\nAderibigbe (2013) contends that the process assists preser-\nvice teachers to be proficient with pedagogical and manage-\nment skills vital for effective lesson coordination. However,\nmentoring should help students not only to manage learning\nbut also to explore, interpret, and explain the \"how\" and\n\"why\" of what happened which then flows into the next\nstage of the teaching cycle, (re)planning of the next lesson\n(du Plessis, 2013). Thus, mentoring makes for an effective\ncatalyst for learning through reflection as students learn\nabout the \"self\" in context.\nKaasila and Lauriala (2010) report that mentoring in\nteacher education benefits both the mentor and the mentee.\nMentoring was found to rejuvenate mentors' careers as it\nenabled them to assist and shape professional and personal\ndevelopment of mentees (Kaasila & Lauriala, 2010). Other\nmentor benefits include increased confidence and personal\nfulfillment. Despite this evidence, it is also believed that as\nlearning is individualistic, good teachers can work individu-\nally to achieve education goals. This perhaps, justifies the\nargument that mentoring should be studied constantly within\nspecific contexts (Aderibigbe, 2013). Against this backdrop,\nthis article addresses the following research question:\nResearch Question 1: How did mentors and mentees\nexperience mentoring during a 4-week residential practi-\ncum in a rural school?\nThere is quality inherent in rural schools and communities\nwhich should be preserved (Arnold, Newman, Gaddy, &\nDean, 2005) such as contextual aptness for teacher prepara-\ntion. Rurality in this study illustrates that these settings can\nbe effective sites for student professional learning. Insights\nfrom the study may stimulate more research in rural educa-\ntion and also provide pointers to teacher educators and policy\nmakers as they appraise and reconsider teacher development\nprograms.\nFirst, this article discusses specifics of the Rural Teacher\nEducation Project (RTEP) and the research site which set the\ncontext for the study. The South African Rural context con-\nstitutes the next section, followed by a conceptual frame-\nwork for the study. The data production strategies used are\ndealt with in the subsequent section, followed by presenta-\ntion of findings. The last section concludes the article and\nhighlights some implications for practice.\nThe RTEP, a rural school\u00aduniversity partnership project, was\nundertaken by the Faculty of Education, in collaboration\nwith rural schools in districts approximately 150 km north-\nwest of Durban in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal Province.\nLaunched in 2007, the project emerged out of the need to\naddress rural education, community development, and\nteacher preparation (Islam, 2012). Although the university\nteacher education programs did not discriminate against\nrural school TP placements, students were not expected to\nundertake practicum in such schools, but were required to\nexperience TP in both resourced and underresourced set-\ntings. Consequently students sought placements in urban set-\ntings closer to transportation and accommodation. The RTEP\nemerged partly to counter this urban bias.\nBroadly, the project focused on rural education by com-\nbining research, intervention, and teacher education strate-\ngies (Balfour, 2012). It tried to understand how learning and\nteaching can be a means of professional development through\ncooperation between in-service teachers in rural schools and\ncohorts of preservice teachers. The RTEP also tried to\nencourage preservice teachers, mentors, and education lead-\ners to act as agents for social change in rural settings (Islam,\n2012). From a methodological perspective, the RTEP\nintended to understand how schools could become resources\nfor, and be located to stimulate and lead, broader processes\nof community development and rural transformation (Islam,\nMitchell, De Lange, Balfour, & Combrink, 2011). Thus, it\naimed to carefully reorient teacher education within the\nEducation Faculty so that rural schools could be recognized\nas major learning sites for preservice teacher preparation\nStudent participation in the project was voluntary. The\nRTEP was widely publicized in the faculty, and students\napplied formally and were interviewed for selection. They\nhad to express interest in rural school teaching; be in second,\nthird, or fourth year of study; be in Senior Phase or Further\nEducation and Training; and specializing in technology, man-\nagement studies, English, computer studies, mathematics, or\nscience. Students in the Foundation Phase who could com-\nmunicate in isiZulu (local language) were also considered.\nMukeredzi 3\nFor effective coordination, the project team appointed at\nleast two advisors/teacher educators for on-site leadership.\nUsually, at least one advisor had a PhD in Teacher Education.\nThis is how I joined the RTEP in 2011. At the time, I was a\nresident postdoctorate with a PhD in Teacher Education. The\nadvisors/teacher educators shared residential facilities with\nstudents approximately 3 kilometers from the school. They\nhelped ferry students to and from school, typically remaining\nat the school site to provide immediate support to the preser-\nvice teachers, facilitating and attending to their activities and\nprofessional dimensions. Each day was accompanied by\nbriefing and debriefing reflection sessions organized and led\nexperiences of professional learning in a rural school were\ndiscussed and interrogated to make for a rigorous process of\ncollaborative learning through reflection.\nThe South African Rural Context\nThe concept \"rural\" is complex and difficult to define.\nDefining it eludes those who attempt to understand it due to\nits ambiguity and the flawed comparisons with urban\ngular or multifaceted definition that would suffice to satisfy\nresearch, program, and policy groups that utilize this con-\ncept. This is due to the vagueness of the term and the subjec-\ntive nature of distinctions with urban (du Plessis, 2013;\nKline, White, & Lock, 2013). The situation is further com-\npounded by the fact that scholars often overlook contextual\ndifferences between rural and urban as school curricula and\npractices are outstandingly similar (Howley, 1997).\nRural areas globally experience social ills and hindrances\nto quality student achievements: low learner attainments;\npoor financing and resourcing; a dearth of family social and\ncultural facilities and services; unfriendly policies; problems\nof \"hard to staff, harder to stay\" due to prevailing discourse of\ndeficiency which regard rural school teaching as low-grade;\nschools distantly located and communities characterized by\ndisease and poverty; scarce economic activities and opportu-\nnities; reduced population and literacy levels; family detach-\nment and seclusion; and low self-esteem of those who live\n(2011) add that rurality is concerned with space, isolation,\ncommunity, poverty, disease, neglect, backwardness, margin-\nalization, depopulation, conservatism, racism, resettlement,\ncorruption, entropy, and exclusion. These obstacles adversely\nimpact on education quality achievement, consequently giv-\ning rise to associating rurality with deficiencies and disadvan-\nRurality in this study is understood synonymously with\nremote. The term remote area implies underclass models that\ndescribe conceptions of rurality in social development\n(Chikoko, 2008). Consequently rurality signifies social\ndisadvantage on the people in question. Such people are\noften partly or fully socially discounted from active national\nmainstream sociopolitical participation. In South Africa, fea-\ntures of rurality also include low literacy levels among adults\nand poor education quality in schools (Gardiner, 2008).\nDefining rural from a South Africa perspective, Wedekind\n(2005) reveals that during apartheid government, the\nSeparate Development Act of 1936 and Group Areas'Act of\n1953 forced native Black South Africans to live in deep rural\nor homeland areas. Currently those former homelands are\ncharacterized by poor infrastructure and services/facilities,\nand portray village-style settlements or dense homesteads.\nCommunities in the former homelands of KwaZulu-Natal,\nEastern Cape, and Limpopo provinces today are the poorest\nand least developed South African rural areas where poverty\nand underdevelopment are evident in the poor education\nquality available there (Gardiner, 2008). Thus, most South\nAfrican rural schools are generally deficient in learning and\ninfrastructural resources and basic services/facilities as they\nwere disregarded as sites for development for a long time.\nWith these limitations, some rural areas are so deteriorated\nthat they are disregarded as an attractive choice for a teach-\ning career or for living (Islam et al., 2011). A thriving econ-\nomy, adequate health facilities, and quality education are\noften nonexistent, contributing to poverty, illness, and lower\nliteracy levels. The site for the present research was located\nin such contexts.\nThe South African government through many policy ini-\ntiatives and the establishment of Rural Education Directorate\nacknowledges rural education as priority (Islam et al., 2011).\nHowever, Moletsane (2012) laments the many challenges\nthat still plague rural education which Mukeredzi and\nMandrona (2013) attribute to mismatches between policy\nimplementation, rural realities, and government response.\nThis is notwithstanding that many school-age children reside\nin rural settings. Statistics South Africa (2015) reports that\n40% of the entire South African population resides in nonur-\nban areas. KwaZulu-Natal province has approximately 54%\nof the population residing in rural areas with about 3,000\nKline et al. (2013) recommend the development of strong\npartnerships between institutions and rural schools for effec-\ntive preservice teacher training, and support for rural school\nteaching appointments. Such partnerships could enable insti-\ntutions and schools to engage in collaborative reflections,\ncontinuously evaluating and challenging existing practices\nand philosophies to generate theories aligned with contem-\nporary South Africa. This could make teacher education\nmore responsive to rural schools, while shaping perceptions\nand professional growth of a new crop of teachers (Islam,\n2012). The RTEP viewed the cohort model as effective in\npromoting partnerships and teacher preparation for rural\nschool postings. Haugalokken and Ramberg (2007) highlight\ntwo partnership models--where institutions control the\n4 SAGE Open\ncooperation--and a cooperative model with equal partner-\nship between schools and institutions. The RTEP tried to\nestablish the latter type of model.\nThe Research Site\nThe site for the RTEP in 2014 was Mxolo (Pseudonym)\nCatholic combined school. A combined school combines pri-\nmary and secondary sectors under one principal, and often\nhas classes from Grade R to Grade 12. Located centrally\nwithin rural village settlements, Mxolo school enrollment\nwas approximately 1,450 with 39 staff. This was a big enroll-\nment for a rural school, but given its central location, amid\ndensely populated multiple villages and, without another\nschool nearby, Mxolo inevitably serviced large enrollments.\nRTEP was attracted to Mxolo because of its combined struc-\nture which enabled placing all students under one \"roof.\"\nThis was ideal for on-site support where teacher educators\nremained at one site as opposed to dividing time between\nsites. All participating students undertook practicum at this\nschool. The school portrayed cleanliness, orderliness, good\ndiscipline, a calm and business-like atmosphere, and respect-\nful, neatly dressed learners. The principal lamented underre-\nsourcing particularly for large classes; Grades 8 to 10 with 70\nto 80 learners. Office space was inadequate, consequently\nthe RTEP team used the school library as an office. This\nspace promoted interaction among students and within the\nRTEP, but tended to create \"borders\" between students and\nschoolteachers.\nConceptual Framework\nThe study draws on (Awaya et al., 2003) conceptualization of\nmentoring. Awaya et al. identified five themes that inform\neffective mentoring: mentoring conceived as a journey,\nequality in the relationship, mentor as source of practical\nknowledge, mentor as source of moral support, and mentor\nprovision of space for the mentee to prove their worth.\nThe mentor\u00admentee relationship conceived as a journey:\nMany searches are woven throughout the Odyssey of\nHomer story: Odysseus the father searching for his home-\nland, Telemachus the son searching for his father, and\nmore profoundly, Telemachus's journey of self-discovery\nstriving to prove his worth as heir to his father's throne\n(Awaya et al., 2003). From the Odyssey of Homer story,\nmentoring was understood from the apprenticeship model.\nThe meaning of mentoring has since evolved and is now\nviewed as a process that facilitates career development\nand fosters an individual's skill and professional growth\n(Leshem, 2012). In this study, drawing on the Odyssey of\nHomer story, the student teacher is on a professional jour-\nney of socialization and initiation into teaching, and they\nare seeking their role in life as a teacher (Allen, Evans,\nNg, & DuBois, 2008). The student teacher is the seeker of\nprofessional knowledge and skills while the mentor sym-\nbolizes a source of knowledge and practical wisdom\nEquality in the relationship: The term mentor is associ-\nated with \"friendly care and assistance\" which heightens\nthe pivotal value of caring and friendship in mentoring\n(Awaya et al., 2003). In the Odyssey, Mentor signifies the\nking's trusted servant and Telemachus is his son. In this\nstudy, the mentor's authority is derived from their knowl-\nedge, skills, and experience as a teacher and not status or\nposition in the school (Heeralal & Bayaga, 2011). Thus,\nthe mentoring relationship is expected to be at a collegial\nechelon, based on shared values, goals, and understand-\nMentor as guide to practical knowledge: Mentor symbol-\nizes Telemachus's advisor, acting as a mouthpiece of wis-\ndom, offering practical advice and guidance, shielding\nfrom harm, and directing his steps while searching for his\nfather. The mentor is expected to direct and guide the stu-\ndent teacher on their professional journey, offering them\npractical knowledge and guidance, targeting their imme-\ndiate teaching activities not external viewpoints/premoni-\ntions, but addressing the student's professional issues of\n\"here\" and \"now\" (Awaya et al., 2003). The mentor's\nguiding roles include assisting the student teacher: in\nrefining existing instructional strategies, introducing new\nstrategies and concepts, engaging in conversations about\ntheir teaching; modeling lessons and professionalism, and\nproviding overall support (Maphalala, 2013). Through\nsuch guidance, the student teacher can tackle problems\nand challenges, and begin to see new paths to solutions\nMentor as source of moral support: Mentor appropriately\nbreathes vigor into Telemachus. The mentor is expected\nto urge the student teacher forward to confront new\nencounters without intervening directly in the student's\naction but supporting them through wise counsel and\nencouragement, and continuously urging them into apt\naction (du Plessis, 2013). This according to Awaya et al.\nProviding space for Telemachus to prove his worth:\nAlthough the mentor offers advice and wise counsel to\nthe \"prot\u00e9g\u00e9,\" he knows when to stand back to let\nTelemachus show off his worth. As a measure of trust,\nmentor stands back from the action to let Telemachus\ngranting Telemachus victory, but only testing his strength.\nThe student teacher must show what he or she is \"made\nof,\" portray a true version of himself or herself, and dem-\nonstrate appropriate capabilities to earn a good standing,\nwithout the intercession of the mentor (du Plessis, 2013;\nMaphalala, 2013). Mentors are expected to be aware of\nwhen to stand back, and the student teacher must be will-\ning and prepared to tackle some tasks alone, displaying\nwillingness to demonstrate that they are made of the\nMukeredzi 5\n\"right material.\" Leshem (2012) points out that student\nteachers often want to learn, and do so best when they\nfeel free to express and choose their own direction and\nengage in experimentation. When mentors are able to do\nthis, then they fulfill a dual role of teacher and learning\nfacilitator. Thus, mentors must help student teachers to\nidentify what direction learning should take and facilitate\nthe best conditions for this to occur, while allowing the\ntrainee to engage in trial and error.\nMethod\nA qualitative approach was adopted to investigate mentoring\nexperiences of 17 mentors and 16 students from their per-\nspectives. Qualitative orientation views reality as constructed\nby individuals intersubjectively from socially and experien-\ntially developed meanings and understandings (Cohen,\nManion, & Morrison, 2011). As this study sought to explore\nmentoring experiences of students and mentors, from their\nperspectives, a qualitative methodology was appropriate.\nData were generated through in-depth group discussions\nwith participants, in line with the qualitative naturalistic\nmethods (interviews, observation, discussions, text analy-\nsis), which ensure adequate researcher-researched dialogue\nduring the social construction of meaningful reality (Cohen\nThere were 22 mentors in total for these students but five\ndid not participate in the study. The mentors' biographical\ndetails show diversity in gender, race, teaching experience,\nand subject specialization. Students were also diverse in\ngender, race, level of study, and subject specialization.\nParticipants' biographical details are reflected in Table 1.\nData were drawn from transcripts of group discussions\nand audio records of group reports. Mentors and students\nformed specialization groupings (five groups each) to make\nfor discussions on common mentors/students. Data genera-\ntion lasted 3 days: one day for mentors and two afternoons\nfor students. Participants worked in groups providing\ndetailed insights into their mentoring experiences. The activ-\nity had two sessions: group discussion and recording find-\nings; and group reports which were audio-recorded. After an\nexplanation of what participants were required to do, the\ngroups embarked on intensive discussions before recording\ntheir experiences on flip chart for reporting back. Both audio\nrecords and written reports were transcribed verbatim.\nContent analysis was used to unpack the data. The process\ninvolves systematically examining and interpreting data to\nidentify patterns and themes (Cohen et al., 2011; Creswell,\nthis study, it involved reading transcripts and listening to\naudio-records several times, making brief notes of emerging\nimportant experiences in the margin, scrutinizing, categoriz-\ning and labeling the notes descriptively, linking related cate-\ngories/themes, and recording them as major or minor\ncategories/themes. This process was repeated with each tran-\nscript. Themes/categories were then reexamined for rele-\nvance to the research question. This was followed by a\nprocess to analyze and ensure that information had been cat-\negorized appropriately; scrutinizing all themes ascertaining\nwhether or not some could be merged or subcategorized and\nTable 1.

(2011) suggest involvement of independent\njudges to verify categories of relevant meaning. Thus, I sent\nthe data set to the RTEP leader to obtain a critical friend per-\nspective, to identify errors and omissions. I then scrutinized\nthe data determining how many mentor/student groups\n(MGs/SGs) had reported on particular themes and whether\ntheir experiences were developmental or nondevelopmental\nand entered in a table (Table 2). Subsequently, I reexamined\ndata extracting quotes representative of each theme which\nwould enhance description of mentors' and students' experi-\nences in their words which Singleton and Straits (1999) call\n\". . . capturing in their language and letting them speak for\nInvolving the RTEP leader helped to establish credibility\nand trustworthiness. The University Higher Degrees and\nEthics Committee granted Ethical Clearance to the RTEP.\nFindings\nThe mentoring experiences of mentors and student teachers\nwere evident in four themes: professional support; lesson\nobservations and feedback; mentor modeling lessons; and\ncollaboration. Table 2 illustrates the number that MGs and\nSGs reported developmental or nondevelopmental experi-\nences related to particular themes.\nProfessional Support\nAll SGs reported experiences of the professional support that\nthey received and the supportive role mentors played which\npositively influenced their TP. The mentors were found to be\npositive, always willing to assist, guide and offer valuable\nadvice, and shared their skills and experiences with students.\nSome SGs mentioned specific needs that their mentors helped\nthem to address and some mentors seemingly met their men-\ntees' expectations. SG4 quoted a mentor who instinctively\nunderstood the mentee's concerns and responded to them:\nIt was as if she opened my mind and saw areas that I feared. I am\nthere thinking, I must master them this final year. She discussed\nthem calmly giving me sources, suggesting methods and learner\nactivities. She shared her skills and experiences, always had\nvaluable advice, helping me through, filling all my knowledge\ngaps.\nStudents' descriptions of mentoring experiences were gener-\nally oriented toward pragmatics of classroom practice: micro\nclassroom activities and teaching strategies, and immediate\nguiding action for \"here\" and \"now\" (Awaya et al., 2003).\nStudents also gave examples of some teaching techniques\nwhich they had acquired through mentoring: \"knowing how\nto explain; making teaching material relevant; raising learner\ncuriosity using interesting and motivating strategies and\naids; gained insights into organizing teaching material; learnt\nways of relating to pupils; and how to build rapport.\" In\nhighlighting these developmental experiences, students\nacknowledged capabilities of their mentors describing them\nas knowledgeable and competent depicting sources of practi-\ncal knowledge and wisdom (Awaya et al., 2003). However,\nthree groups (SG1, SG4, and SG5) also included some non-\ndevelopmental experiences. For example,\nWhat dismayed me was that he introduced me as his assistant\nand told learners that I was a student like them . . . I can't be like\nhis learners, I am qualifying this year. (SG5)\nMukeredzi 7\nWe met for daily planning and she said she wasn't going to class,\nI should go. I had not planned, so I had to plan and teach there\nand then. Mentors are not communicating with us! They must\ncommunicate on teaching issues. (SG1)\nI was upset, he sent the class outside to play when I was supposed\nto teach. They don't see the need to tell us because we are\nstudents, but communication is important. (SG4)\nRemarks by SG5 may lead to students getting discouraged,\nfeeling inadequate, and losing confidence in their ability to\nteach contrary to expectations by Awaya et al. (2003) where\nthe mentor should offer moral support and breathe vigor into\nthe mentee. What was seemingly underlying students' con-\ncern for respect was the need for \"acceptance\" as colleagues.\nSG1 and SG4 indicate lack of communication. Preservice\nteachers are often excited to be part of a real school setting\nwith open communication from their mentors, other staff and\nschool management. The evidence above is contrary to these\nexpectations.\nAll MGs reported positive mentoring experiences but\nportrayed a wider perspective of mentoring support, pointing\nout that they challenged students, imparted knowledge in\nmotivating ways, and performed mentoring duties effec-\ntively. They generally indicated that they enjoyed working\nclosely with students sharing ideas, skills, and plans. This\nseemingly confirmed understanding mentoring as a journey\nand mentors as sources of knowledge (Awaya et al., 2003).\nThey highlighted that there was more to the experiences that\nwas valuable as explained by MG1:\nWe got a different perspective to reflecting on what we did and\nwhy. When students, joined us, we already had schedules and\nlessons written. So we had to re-examine them critically\nknowing we would share with students. We learnt new ways of\nteaching, designing learner activities, assessments and discipline.\nWe started critiquing our lessons: was it effective? Were\ninstructions clear? All because of working with students.\nMentors became more reflective and critical of their peda-\ngogical practices and learnt new strategies in the course of\nmentoring students. The description above lays emphasis on\nmentors learning rather than mentees. The very presence of\nthe preservice teachers seemingly stimulated reflection-on-\npractice to provide a positive image to student teachers. MG4\nadded,\nStudents were enthusiastic and initiative which pushed us to\nreflect on our work. Their presence was an energy which\npropelled us; like more energy breathed into us. From nowhere\nwe became enthusiastic, our morale and passion just grew.\nOther MGs reported specific aspects in which they had real-\nized growth from mentoring student teachers: \"Having them\nmade us more tolerant, more understanding, and supportive\"\n(MG2). \"Conversations with them helped us to understand\nour pedagogical procedures which improved our teaching\"\nLesson Observations and Feedback\nWith regard to lesson observations and feedback, what\n\"stands\" out in both mentors' (four MGs) and students' texts\n(five SGs) is the "
