A lack of\nmoderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) is an established determinant of cardio-metabolic risk\nfactors in children and adolescents. Less is known about the relationship between sedentary behavior and cardio-\nmetabolic health. Therefore, the objective was to examine the independent associations between volume, patterns,\nand types of sedentary behavior with cardio-metabolic risk factors among children and adolescents.\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). A cardio-metabolic risk score (CRS) was calculated\nbased on age- and sex-adjusted waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, non-high-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol, and C-reactive protein values. Volume and patterns of sedentary behavior and moderate-to-vigorous\nphysical activity (MVPA) were measured objectively using accelerometers. Types of sedentary behavior were\nmeasured by questionnaire. A series of logistic regression models were used to examine associations.\nResults: Volume and patterns of sedentary behavior were not predictors of high CRS after adjusting for MVPA and\nother confounders (P > 0.1). For types of sedentary behavior, high TV use, but not high computer use, was a\npredictor of high CRS after adjustment for MVPA and other confounders. Children and adolescents who watched\nthose who watched <1 hour per day. MVPA predicted high CRS after adjusting for all sedentary behavior measures\nand other confounders. After adjustment for waist circumference, MVPA also predicted high non-obesity CRS;\nhowever, the same relationship was not seen with TV use.\nConclusion: No association was observed between overall volume and patterns of sedentary behavior with cardio-\nmetabolic risk factors in this large sample of children and adolescents. Conversely, high TV use and low MVPA\nwere independently associated with cardio-metabolic risk factors. However, the association between high TV use\nand clustered cardio-metabolic risk factors appears to be mediated or confounded by obesity. Thus, TV and MVPA\nappear to be two separate behaviors that need to be targeted with different interventions and policies.\nBackground\nCardio-metabolic risk factors, such as obesity, hyperten-\nsion, dyslipidemia, and glucose intolerance, are known\npredictors of coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes\namong adults [1]. These risk factors are becoming more\nprevalent in children and adolescents, and approxi-\nmately 50% of American youth have at least one cardio-\nmetabolic risk factor [2]. This is concerning as cardio-\nmetabolic risk factors track from childhood to adult-\nhood [1]. In addition, cardio-metabolic risk factors dur-\ning adolescence predict the development of sub-clinical\ncardiovascular disease [3], coronary heart disease [4],\nand mortality in adulthood [5]. Therefore, improving\nthe cardio-metabolic risk factor profile of young people\nhas long-term implications on population health.\nPhysical inactivity is an established determinant of car-\ndio-metabolic risk factors in children and adolescents\n[6].

An emerging area of study is the relation between\nsedentary behavior and health [7]. Sedentary behavior\nrefers to activities that involve minimal body movement\nand low energy expenditure [9]. To date, two studies\nhave examined the relationship between the overall\nvolume of sedentary behavior with a summary cardio-\nmetabolic risk score among children and adolescents\n[10,11]. Although both studies found significant associa-\ntions, the results need to be interpreted with caution.\nSpecifically, neither study adjusted for MVPA even\nthough MVPA is an independent predictor of cardio-\nmetabolic risk factors [12].\nIn addition to the overall volume, the type of seden-\ntary behavior appears to impact cardio-metabolic health.\nFor example, a recent review reported that TV use is\nmore strongly related to obesity than video game and\ncomputer use in young people [13]. A limitation of the\nexisting screen time (i.e., TV, computer, video game) lit-\nerature is that only one study has considered the impact\nof the overall volume of sedentary behavior on the\nobserved relationships [14].\nAlong with volume and types of sedentary behavior,\nconsideration should be given to the patterns in which\nsedentary behavior is accumulated. Prolonged bouts of\nsedentary behavior are associated with cardio-metabolic\nhealth in adults [15,16]. One study among adults\nreported that an increased number of breaks in\nsedentary behavior are associated with an improved car-\ndio-metabolic risk factor profile, independent of total\nsedentary behavior time and MVPA [17]. No study has\nexamined the relationship between patterns of sedentary\nbehavior and cardio-metabolic risk factors in the\npediatric population. Children and adolescents spend\nextended periods of time being sedentary in and outside\nof school [9,18,19] and have sporadic MVPA patterns\n[20]. It is unknown whether patterns of sedentary beha-\nvior independently impact cardio-metabolic risk factors\nin young people.\nThe purpose of this study was to comprehensively\nexamine the relationships between the volume, patterns,\nand types of sedentary behavior with cardio-metabolic\nrisk factors in children and adolescents. The specific\nobjectives were to: (1) determine whether the volume of\nsedentary behavior predicts cardio-metabolic risk factors\nindependent of MVPA; (2) determine whether patterns\n(bouts and breaks in bouts) of sedentary behavior pre-\ndict cardio-metabolic risk factors independent of MVPA\nand the volume of sedentary behavior; and (3) determine\nwhether different types of sedentary behavior are related\nto cardio-metabolic risk factors in a similar manner.\nMethods\nParticipants\ncycles of the Nutrition Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative\ncross-sectional survey of the US. NHANES consisted of\na home interview and a physical exam conducted in a\nmobile examination center. Consent was obtained from\nall participants and their parents/guardians if <18 years\nold. NHANES was approved by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics. The analyses presented here were\napproved by the Health Sciences Research Ethics Board\nat Queen's University.\nattended the mobile examination center. We excluded\n3208 participants with incomplete accelerometer\ninformation (as explained below) and an additional 918\nparticipants with incomplete information on the cardio-\nmetabolic outcome and covariate measures, leaving a\nfinal sample of 2527. There were no significant differ-\nences in age or gender (P > 0.05) between the partici-\npants that were included or excluded from the final\nsample. However, slightly more Hispanic (5.4%) and\nslightly less non-Hispanic white (3.2%) and non-Hispanic\nblack (2.4%) participants were included in the final sam-\nMeasurement of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activity\nVolume of sedentary behavior, patterns of sedentary\nbehavior (bouts and breaks in bouts), and physical activ-\nity variables were created by the authors based on the\nraw accelerometry data provided in the NHANES data-\nset. The Actigraph AM-7124 accelerometer (Actigraph,\nFt. Walton Beach, FL) was the device used in the\nNHANES study. These are uniaxial accelerometers that\nrecord average intensities in one minute intervals or\nepochs. Participants were asked to wear the acceler-\nometer on their right hip for 7 consecutive days except\nwhen sleeping or when the accelerometer could get wet.\nData from the accelerometers was downloaded by\nNHANES survey collaborators and checked for outliers\nand unreasonable or biologically implausible values,\nwhich were removed. Reasonable ranges of values were\ndetermined by criteria published in the literature and\nexpert judgment [21]. Further data reduction was com-\npleted by the authors. Initially, we removed days with\nincomplete information. A day was considered complete\nif it contained 10 hours of wear time [22], non-wear\ntime was defined as a period of >20 minutes of zero\ncounts [22]. The second data reduction step involved\nremoving participants with an insufficient number of\ndays with complete data. Only participants with 4 com-\nplete days, including one weekend day, were included.\nThe inclusion of a weekend day is important as there are\nsignificant weekday and weekend differences in MVPA\nmonitoring period has a test-retest reliability of 0.8\namong children in grades 1-6 and 0.7 among adolescent\nBefore we derived the sedentary behavior and physical\nactivity variables from the raw accelerometry data,\nepoch cut-points were selected. There is currently sub-\nstantial variation on the cut-points used to define seden-\ntary behavior and different intensities of physical activity\n[25]. We selected a cut-point of <100 counts per minute\nto define sedentary behavior [18]. For MVPA, a regres-\nsion equation developed by Freedson and colleagues, for\n6-18 year olds, was used to estimate metabolic equiva-\nlents (METs) for each epoch value, based on the partici-\npant's age and the epoch count [26]. MVPA was defined\nas 4.0 METs, based on established precedence in the\npediatric exercise literature [25,27]. Low intensity physi-\ncal activity was defined as epoch values between 100\ncounts and an equivalent of 4.0 METs.\nThe next step was to derive the sedentary behavior\nand physical activity variables for each complete day of\nmonitoring as illustrated in Figure 1. We calculated the\nvolume of sedentary behavior, low intensity physical\nactivity, and MVPA for each participant and divided\nthese values by total wear time. To be defined as a\nsedentary behavior bout, there had to be 30 minutes\nwith 80% of minutes below the 100 counts cut-point.\nThe bout stopped when <80% was below the 100 counts\ncut-point or when there were 5 consecutive minutes\n100 counts (Figure 1). Total minutes spent in seden-\ntary behavior bouts were then divided by total wear\ntime. A minimum 30 minute bout period of sedentary\nbehavior was chosen to represent a 30 minute TV pro-\ngram or class in school. Also, sensitivity analyses indi-\ncated that the 30 minute bout period had a better\nmodel fit with cardio-metabolic risk factors than shorter\nbout periods (i.e., 5 or 10 minutes). Within each bout of\nsedentary behavior, we calculated the number of \"break\"\nminutes as those minutes equal to low intensity activity\nor MVPA. A variable reflecting the percentage of seden-\ntary behavior bout time spent in breaks was calculated.\nFinally, the type of sedentary behavior (TV or compu-\nter) was obtained by questionnaire from the NHANES\ndataset. TV and computer were selected because they\nwere available in the dataset and they make up a large\nproportion of sedentary behavior time. For example,\nAmerican youth spent 6-8 hours/day sedentary [18] and\n4.5 hours/day using a TV or computer [28]. Proxy\nrespondents answered the questions for participants\nselves. Two questions were asked, \"Over the past 30\ndays, on average about how many hours per day did\n(you/your child) sit and watch TV or video?\" and \"Over\nthe past 30 days, on average how many hours per day\ndid (you/your child) use a computer or play computer\ngames?\" There were 7 response options ranging from\n\"none\" to \"5 hours or more\". We collapsed these\nresponse options into 4 groups (<1 hour, 1 hour, 2-3\nhours,  4 hours) based on frequency distributions.\nFigure 1 Examples of physical activity and sedentary behavior variables derived from accelerometry data in one participant. The x-axis\nrepresents 7 hours of time, in 1 minute epoch values, of the accelerometry measurements. The height of the data on the y-axis represents the\nintensity of the epoch values, with higher data points equaling higher intensities.\nCardio-Metabolic Risk Factors\nWaist circumference, systolic blood pressure, non-high-\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL cholesterol),\nand C-reactive protein were the cardio-metabolic risk\nfactors studied. These risk factors were selected because\nthey were available in the NHANES dataset and because\nthey capture different aspects of cardio-metabolic risk.\nAll measurements were taken by trained personnel at\nthe mobile examination center visit. Triglycerides and\nfasting glucose were not examined as cardio-metabolic\nrisk factors due to the unavailability of fasting values\nin participants under the age of 12 in the NHANES\ndataset.\nWaist circumference was measured to the nearest 0.1\ncm at the level of the iliac crest. Waist circumference is\nan effective measure of abdominal adiposity among chil-\ndren and adolescents [29] and is a better predictor of\ncardio-metabolic risk factors than the body mass index\n[30]. Blood pressure was measured manually four conse-\ncutive times on the right arm while seated. We calcu-\nlated the average blood pressures. We calculated non-\nHDL cholesterol by subtracting HDL cholesterol from\ntotal cholesterol [31]. HDL cholesterol was measured\nusing the direct HDL immunoassay method and total\ncholesterol was measured enzymatically in serum in a\nseries of coupled reactions using cholesteryl ester hydro-\nlase, cholesterol oxidase, and peroxidase. Non-HDL cho-\nlesterol was chosen as the lipid marker because it is an\nimportant indicator of cardiovascular disease and dia-\nbetes risk among children and adolescents that it is not\nreliant upon a fasting blood sample [32]. C-reactive pro-\ntein was measured by latex enhanced nephelometry. C-\nreactive protein was chosen as the inflammatory marker\nbecause of its availability in the dataset, known impact\non cardiovascular disease, and because it is not reliant\nWaist circumference and non-HDL cholesterol were\nnot normally distributed so they were log transformed\nby the authors prior to analyses. Age-adjusted values\nwere created by the authors for each of the cardio-meta-\nbolic risk factors because they change with normal\ngrowth and maturation [35]. Using forward stepwise\nregression, each of the cardio-metabolic risk factors\nwere regressed up to a full cubic polynomial in age (age,\nage2, age3) separately within males and females. Vari-\nables were allowed to enter or leave the model at P <\n0.10. The standardized residuals were retained and used\nto represent the age-adjusted values. Participants were\nthen ranked based on the residual for each risk factor. A\nmean of the ranks was used to represent a summary\ncardio-metabolic risk score (CRS). Blood pressure was\nnot measured in children <8 years old, so the CRS for\n6-7 year olds was limited to three risk factors. We\ncategorized CRS into quartiles; the highest quartile\ndenotes high CRS.\nCovariates\nAge, gender, ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nblack, Hispanic, other), socioeconomic status (SES),\nsmoking status, and diet were considered as covariates.\nThe poverty-to-income ratio, provided within the\nNHANES dataset, is a ratio between family income and\npoverty threshold and was used to measure SES [36].\nSmoking was assessed in NHANES by asking participants\n12 and older, \"Have you ever tried cigarette smoking,\neven 1 or 2 puffs?\" We grouped participants into \"yes\" or\n\"no\" categories. Participants <12 years old were placed\ninto the \"no\" category. Diet was assessed in NHANES via\na 24 hour recall. We created four binary variables from\nthe total nutrient values provided in the database: total\nStatistical Analysis\nAnalyses were completing using SAS version 9.2 (SAS\nInstitute Inc., Cary, NC) and accounted for the complex\ndesign and sample weights of NHANES. Descriptive sta-\ntistics were calculated. Relations between activity and\nsedentary behavior variables were determined using\nPearson (continuous variables) and Spearman (categori-\ncal variables) correlations. Multiple logistic regression\nmodels were used to address the study objectives. All\nregression models predicted the highest CRS quartile\nand adjusted for various confounders including age,\ngender, ethnicity, SES, smoking, total fat, saturated fat,\ndietary cholesterol, sodium, and MVPA. To address\nobjective 1 (volume of sedentary behavior), an initial\nregression model was run that included the sedentary\nbehavior volume measure and all confounders except\nfor MVPA. A second model was run that also adjusted\nfor MVPA. To address objective 2 (patterns of sedentary\nbehavior), initial regression models were run that\nincluded (a) the bouts of sedentary behavior measure\nand all confounders except MVPA, and (b) the breaks\nin bouts of sedentary behavior measure, volume of\nsedentary behavior, and all confounders except MVPA.\nAdditional models were run that also adjusted for\nMVPA. To address objective 3 (types of sedentary beha-\nvior), initial regression models were run that included\n(a) TV use and all confounders except MVPA, and (b)\ncomputer use and all confounders except MVPA. Addi-\ntional models were run that also adjusted for MVPA.\nAlong with the analyses performed to address the main\nobjectives, some supplemental analysis was conducted.\nFirst, age and gender interactions were explored in the\nprimary analyses as well as sedentary behavior and\nMVPA interactions. Second, the relationship between\nMVPA and CRS was considered by running an initial\nlogistic regression model that included the MVPA mea-\nsure and all confounders. An additional model was run\nthat also adjusted for overall volume of sedentary beha-\nvior. Third, the role of obesity as a mediator or con-\nfounder in the relationship between the sedentary\nbehavior and MVPA variables with CRS was examined.\nConsistent with previous literature, a non-obesity CRS\nvariable was created by removing waist circumference,\nand the above analyses were repeated predicting high\nnon-obesity CRS, while further adjusting for waist cir-\nthe sedentary behavior and MVPA variables with indivi-\ndual CRS components was explored. All logistic regres-\nsion models predicted the highest quartiles of the\nindividual components. The same modeling strategies\ndescribed above in this paragraph for the CRS outcome\nvariable were used to explore these relationships.\nResults\nDescriptive Analyses\nParticipant characteristics are in Table 1.

Similar associations were\nobserved when predicting high non-obesity CRS after\nfurther adjusting for waist circumference. However, TV\nuse was not associated with high non-obesity CRS.

Conversely, MVPA was\nassociated with all four individual components of CRS\nin a dose-response manner, after adjustment for various\nconfounders and sedentary behavior (Ptrend\nnot shown).

Although this\nrepresentative sample spent 50.8% of their waking hours\nin sedentary behavior, the volume of sedentary behavior\nwas not an independent predictor of high-risk cardio-\nmetabolic factor values. Similarly, patterns of sedentary\nbehavior, such as the amount of time in bouts of seden-\ntary behavior 30 minutes, was not related to cardio-\nmetabolic risk factors. However, the type of sedentary\nbehavior was important. More specifically, the amount\nof time spent watching TV was related to cardio-meta-\nbolic risk factors, while computer use was not.\nTable 2 Correlations between sedentary behavior and physical activity variables.\nVolume of SB Bouts of SB Breaks in Bouts of SB TV Computer MVPA Low Intensity PA\nLow Intensity PA -\nSB = sedentary behavior; MVPA = moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity; PA = physical activity.\nAll correlations were significant (P  0.05) except for the correlations between Breaks in Bouts of SB with MVPA and TV\nTable 3 High CRS according to volume, patterns, and\ntypes of sedentary behavior.\nPrevalence Model 1 Model 2\nVolume of sedentary behavior\nP trend\nBouts of sedentary behavior\nPtrend\nBreaks in bouts of sedentary behavior\nPtrend\nTV\nPtrend\nComputer\nPtrend\nHigh CRS refers to the highest quartile of CRS.

In our study, the volume of objectively measured\nsedentary behavior was not associated with high CRS or\nits individual components. Two previous cross-sectional\nstudies within children and/or adolescents have exam-\nined the association between the volume of sedentary\nbehavior, measured by an accelerometer, with a sum-\nmary cardio-metabolic risk score [10,11]. Positive\nassociations were observed in both studies. However,\nneither study examined whether these associations were\nindependent of MVPA, which is an important limitation,\ngiven that MVPA is related to sedentary behavior (see\nTable 2). In addition, five previous studies within chil-\ndren and adolescents, all cross-sectional in design, have\nexamined the association between the volume of seden-\ntary behavior, measured by an accelerometer, with indi-\nvidual risk factors such as insulin resistance [41], blood\nOne of these studies found moderate positive associa-\ntions (r = 0.21) between the volume of sedentary beha-\nvior and insulin resistance among 9-10 year old children\nindependent of obesity [41].

In the three studies that examined obesity mea-\nsures, associations with volume of sedentary behavior\ndid not exist or was severely attenuated after adjustment\nEmerging evidence in adults suggests that patterns in\nwhich sedentary behavior is accumulated may indepen-\ndently impact cardio-metabolic risk. More specifically, a\ncross-sectional study of 168 Australian adults found that\nthe frequency of breaks in sedentary behavior was nega-\ntively related to waist circumference, triglycerides, and\nglucose levels, independent of MVPA and the overall\nvolume of sedentary behavior [17]. We are unaware of\nprevious studies that have examined these associations\nin children or adolescents. Thus, our observation that\npatterns of sedentary behavior, including sedentary\nbehavior bouts and breaks in bouts of sedentary beha-\nvior, were not related to cardio-metabolic risk factors in\n6-19 year olds makes a novel contribution to the litera-\nture. It is possible that the differences in results between\nthe present study and the previously mentioned adult\nstudy [17] is explained by a physiological difference in\nthe way sedentary behavior impacts health in adults and\nyoung people. It is also possible that the different results\nare due to differences in the way \"breaks\" were mea-\nsured in the two studies. While the present study looked\nat the frequency of breaks within prolonged (30 min-\nutes) bouts, the Australian study counted a break any\ntime the participant moved from a sedentary minute to\na minute above the 100 count per minute accelerometry\nthreshold [17]. Due to the dearth of information, more\nresearch is needed to better understand the relationship\nbetween patterns of sedentary behavior and cardio-\nmetabolic health in all ages.\nOur third objective was to determine if different\ntypes of sedentary behavior impact cardio-metabolic\nhealth in a similar manner. Several studies among\nyoung people have found associations between TV and\ntotal screen time with individual cardio-metabolic risk\nour knowledge only one of these studies reported on\nthe impact of different screen time measures on car-\ndio-metabolic risk factors other than obesity [14]. This\nparticular study found that blood pressure was asso-\nciated with TV but not with computer use [14]. Also, a\nrecent literature review found that TV use is more\nstrongly associated with obesity in children and adoles-\ncents than is computer use [13]. Likewise, we found\nthat the odds of a high CRS increased in a dose-\nresponse manner within increasing TV volume, inde-\npendent of MVPA, but that computer use did not pre-\ndict CRS. Similar associations were seen with the\nindividual components of CRS. There are two possible\nexplanations for these findings. First, amongst the\nsedentary behaviors, TV may be at the lowest end of\nthe energy expenditure spectrum. In fact, one study\nreported that energy expenditure in children and ado-\nlescents was lower while watching TV then while sleep-\ning [47]. Second, TV encourages between meal\nsnacking [48] and is associated with a greater exposure\nto junk food advertisements than other screen time\nmeasures [49]. Even though various dietary measures\n(total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium) were\nadjusted for in this study, residual confounding may\nhave been present. Future research needs to consider\nthe impact of other types of sedentary behavior (read-\ning, homework, etc.) on the health of young people.\nInterestingly, in the present study the CRS variable\nwas predicted by a self-report measure of TV use but\nnot an objective measure of overall sedentary behavior\nvolume or the overall volume of sedentary behavior\naccumulated in prolonged bouts. Also, TV use was\npoorly correlated (r  0.08) to these two objective mea-\nsures. There are three possible explanations for these\nobservations. First, the uniaxial accelerometer used in\nNHANES may not be sensitive enough to differentiate\nbetween sitting and standing like an inclinometer [50].\nAlso, participants may have been more likely to keep\ntheir accelerometer on during their daily activities and\nMVPA, and take it off later in the evening while watch-\ning TV [51]. Therefore, the objectively measured seden-\ntary behavior may not have captured 100% of the\nsedentary behavior for some participants. Second, the\nspecific sedentary behavior of TV may have a unique\nimpact on cardio-metabolic risk factors due to its\nimpact on energy expenditure and intake, as previously\ndiscussed. Third, the catchment period of sedentary\nbehavior differed between the self- report measure (past\n30 days) and the accelerometer measure (7 days). Per-\nhaps, the longer catchment period better reflects typical\nbehavior compared to the shorter period.\nWe also examined the association between objectively\nmeasured MVPA with CRS and non-obesity CRS. The\nfinding that MVPA was strongly and independently\nassociated with cardio-metabolic risk factors in a dose-\nresponse manner is consistent with previous literature\n[52]. For example, a dose-response relationship between\nMVPA and cardio-metabolic risk factors was observed\nin approximately 2000 participants of the European\nYouth Heart Study [6]. As with the present study, the\nassociations between MVPA and clustered cardio-meta-\nbolic risk factors within children and adolescents have\nbeen reported to be independent of TV use and obesity\n[12]. However, similar to the present study, the associa-\ntion between TV use and clustered cardio-metabolic\nrisk factors do not appear to be independent of obesity\n[12]. This suggests that obesity mediates or confounds\nthe relationship between TV use and clustered cardio-\nmetabolic risk factors [12].\nStrengths of this study include the objective measures\nof MVPA and most of the sedentary behavior variables\nas well as our novel approach used to examine patterns\nof sedentary behavior. Limitations of the study include\nthe cross-sectional design, which limits the ability to\nmake causal inferences about the relationships. Also,\nour final sample was not representative of the popula-\ntion in terms of ethnicity. In addition, the acceler-\nometers used may not be sensitive enough to\ndifferentiate between sitting and standing [50]. Further-\nmore, we only considered two types of sedentary beha-\nvior, both of which were measured via self-report. The\nbiases with these self-reported measures may have\nresults in an underestimation of the strength of associa-\ntions between the TV, computer, and CRS variables.\nFinally, although a variety of confounders were consid-\nered, we were not able adjust for pubertal development,\na factor which influences physiological processes [53].\nConclusions\nNo association was observed between overall volume\nand patterns of sedentary behavior with cardio-meta-\nbolic risk factors in this large sample of children and\nadolescents. Conversely, TV use and low MVPA were\nboth independently associated with cardio-metabolic\nrisk factors. However, the association between high TV\nuse and clustered cardio-metabolic risk factors appears\nto be mediated or confounded by obesity. In addition,\nthe TV and MVPA variables were poorly correlated\nwith one another. This suggests that these are two sepa-\nrate behaviors, and that different policy and intervention\nprograms are needed to increase MVPA and decrease\nTV use in an effort to prevent and reduce cardio-meta-\nbolic risk factors.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported by an operating grant from the Canadian\nInstitutes of Health Research (CIHR).
