During\nFFB, there are two factors that can influ-\nence serum cytokine levels. First, as an\ninvasive procedure, FFB can irritate and\ndamage the airway mucosa, activate the\nhypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, and\nthen induce the stress response and changes\nin immune function.5 Secondly, anaes-\nthetics used during FFB may have immu-\nnomodulatory properties, and can inhibit\nthe release of cytokines.6,7 Although these\neffects may be inconsequential in chil-\ndren with a normal functioning immune\nsystem, suppression of the immune res-\nponse may have relevance in children\nwith a pre-existing immune imbalance, for\nexample in cases of community-acquired\npneumonia.\nSevoflurane and propofol are widely used\nin the induction and maintenance of anaes-\nthesia during FFB in children.8 To the best\nof the authors' knowledge, there has been\nlittle work focusing on the relationship\nbetween these two anaesthetics and cytokine\nrelease in children with community-acquired\npneumonia undergoing FFB.\nIn the present study, serum cytokines and\nstress hormones were compared in children\nwith community-acquired pneumonia\nundergoing FFB, to investigate the immu-\nnomodulatory effects of sevoflurane and\npropofol.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis randomized parallel-group trial was\nconducted at Hubei Maternal and Child\nHealth Hospital, Wuhan, China between\ncomprised male and female children aged 2\u00ad\n12 years with a clinical diagnosis of commu-\nnity-acquired pneumonia undergoing FFB;\nand children classified with American Society\nof Anaesthesiologists physical status (ASA)\nII or III (http://www.asahq.org/resources/\nclinical-information/asa-physical-status-class\nification-system). A diagnosis of community-\nacquired pneumonia was defined as radio-\ngraphic evidence of pulmonary infiltrate\nconsistent with acute infection requiring anti-\nbiotic therapy, and the presence of two or\nmore indications of pneumonia: fever, short-\nness of breath, cough, chest pain, abnormal\nwhite blood cell count or physical signs of\npneumonia on examination (e.g., rales on\nauscultation, dullness to percussion, or\negophony).9 Children with a history of\nimmunosuppression, neutropenia, cardiovas-\ncular, endocrinological, hepatic or renal dis-\norders, allergy to opioids, or recent use\n(within 3 months prior to study entry) of\nanalgesics or psychoactive drugs were\nexcluded from the study. Children who had\nexperienced FFB within 3 months prior to\nstudy entry were also excluded.\nThe study protocol was approved by\nHubei Maternal and Child Health Hospital\nEthics Committee (Protocol number:\ntered at www.chictr.org (ChiCTR-TRC-\naccording to the Declaration of Helsinki.\nWritten informed consent was obtained\nfrom the legal proxies of all participants\nbefore the trial commenced.\nStudy design\nAll FFB procedures were performed during\nmorning hours. Children were randomized\nat study entry, using a computer-generated\nlist, into a propofol group or sevoflurane\ngroup. Coded, sealed envelopes were used\nfor allocation concealment. The propofol\ngroup received 3\u00ad5 mg/kg propofol i.v. infu-\nsion, while the sevoflurane group received\noxygen at a flow of 6 l/min and 8% sevo-\nflurane by inhalation using a Dra\n\u00a8 ger Fabuis\nGS Anaesthesia Machine (Dra\n\u00a8 ger Medical\nAG & Co. KG, Lubeck, Germany); both\ngroups received 1 mg/kg remifentanil i.v.\ninjected for 60 s followed by 0.4 mg/kg/min\nremifentanil by i.v. infusion. Doses of pro-\npofol and sevoflurane were adjusted to keep\nthe bispectral index between 40 and 50. The\nbronchoscope (Olympus Corporation,\nTokyo, Japan) was introduced through a\nbronchoscopy adapter (Covidien LLC, MA,\nUSA) and a laryngeal mask airway (WEILI\nCorporation, Guangzhou, China). Upon\ndirect visualization of the vocal cords, 1%\nlidocaine (maximum 7 mg/kg) was injected\nfor topical anaesthesia. Bronchoalveolar\nlavage was performed using 0.9% NaCl\n(maximum 5 mg/kg). All drugs were\ndiscontinued upon completion of the FFB\nprocedure, and the laryngeal mask airway\nwas removed when the children were fully\nawake.\nPhenylephrine (0.05 mg/kg, i.v.) was\nadministered when mean arterial pressure\nwas ! 30% reduction from baseline, and\ncould not be controlled within 5 min by\nincreasing the level of fluid infusion.\nAtropine (0.01 mg/kg, i.v.) was adminis-\ntered when heart rate was <80 beats\nper min.\nData collection\nHeart rate and mean arterial pressure were\nmonitored and recorded at baseline (T0\n), on\ncompletion of FFB (T1\n) and 4 h following\n). Duration of the FFB procedure\nwas also recorded.\nVenous blood samples (3 ml) were taken\nat six time points: at baseline (T0\n); on\ncompletion of FFB (T1\n); 4 h following FFB\n); at 1 day following FFB (T3\n); at 4 days\nfollowing FFB (T4\n); and at 7 days following\n). The samples were drawn into\ntubes without anticoagulants, and cooled\novernight at 4C before centrifugation at\nwere then collected and stored at \u00c020C\nprior to use. Serum levels of stress hormones\n(noradrenaline, adrenaline and cortisol,\nmeasured at T0\n) and the cyto-\nkines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, inter-\nleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 were determined by\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using\ncommercial kits (Human Noradrenaline\nELISA, Human Adrenaline ELISA,\nHuman Cortisol ELISA, Human Cytokine\nTNF-a ELISA, Human Cytokine IL-6\nELISA and Human Cytokine IL-10\nELISA; Wuhan Xinqidi Biological\nTechnology Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China) and\nmicrotiter plates (Wuhan Xinqidi Biological\nTechnology Co., Ltd) according to the\nmanufacturer's instructions. A WHYM201\nElisa Microplate Reader (Poweam Medical\nSystems Co., Ltd, Jiangsu, China) was used\nto analyse the ELISA reactions.\nStatistical analyses\nThe number of patients required for each\nstudy group was estimated according to the\nbetween-group differences in serum IL-6\nlevels observed in the authors' previous\npilot study (data not shown). It was esti-\nmated that to have 80% power of detecting a\n30% difference with a type-I error of 5%\nusing Chinese High Intellectualized\nYuanyitang Science & Technology, Beijing,\nChina), a minimum of 22 children were\nrequired in each group. A 10% drop-out\nrate was anticipated, thus, a minimal sample\nsize of 25 was recruited for each group. Data\nare presented as mean \u00c6 SD or n prevalence.\nStudent's t-test was used to compare\nbetween-group age, weight, and duration\nof FFB. 2-test was used to analyse categor-\nical data. Two-way repeated measures ana-\nlysis of variance followed by multiple\ncomparisons (least significant difference\ntesting) was used to evaluate the effects of\ntime, group, and interaction. Statistical ana-\nlyses were performed with SPSS\u00d5 software,\nversion 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)\nfor Windows\u00d5. A P value < 0.05 was con-\nsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nOut of 56 eligible children initially enrolled,\n50 were finally included in the study\n(25 received propofol and 25 received sevo-\nflurane); six children were excluded because\nthey refused to participate (Figure 1). There\nwere no statistically significant between-\ngroup differences in demographic details or\nduration of FFB (Table 1). There were also\nno statistically significant between-group\ndifferences in type of infection (bacterial or\nnon-bacterial pneumonia) or numbers who\nreceived steroid therapy (Table 2).\nHeart rate and mean arterial pressure\ndecreased in both groups at the end of FFB\nline, and there were no statistically signifi-\ncant between-group differences in these\nparameters at T0\n(Table 3).\nStress hormones (noradrenaline, adrenaline\nand cortisol) decreased at the end of FFB\n) and 4 h following FFB (T2\n) versus\nbaseline (P < 0.01), and there were no stat-\nistically significant between-group differ-\nences at T0\n(Table 3).\nCirculating serum IL-6 and IL-10 levels\ndecreased significantly following the FFB\nprocedure in both groups (Table 4).\nCirculating IL-6 levels were lower in the\nsevoflurane group than the propofol group\nlevels were lower in the sevoflurane group\nthan the propofol group at 1 day following\nrespectively, P \u00bc 0.023). Serum TNF-a was\nalso decreased at 4 days and 7 days following\nthe FFB procedure, and no statistically\nsignificant between-group differences were\nobserved in terms of TNF-a at any time\npoint (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nThe present study showed that in children\nwith community-acquired pneumonia\nundergoing FFB, serum IL-6 and IL-10\nlevels were lower in children who received\nsevoflurane compared with those who\nreceived propofol, suggesting that different\nanaesthetics might inFuence the immuno-\nlogical response in these patients.\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia is\ntightly regulated by cytokines produced by\nthe immune system in response to causal\nmicroorganisms.10 These cytokines serve to\ncontrol infection by leukocyte recruitment\nand inFammation, however, persistent and\ntoxic inflammation can induce an overly\nproinflammatory cytokine balance, and lead\nto poor patient outcomes.11 Serum IL-6\nconcentration is a sensitive and specific\nmeasurement for assessing response to infec-\ntion treatment, and might be predictive of\ndeath, and rapidity of shock onset.12 Several\nstudies have shown that IL-6 levels correlate\nwith illness severity in patients with pneu-\nmonia.13\u00ad15 As an anti-inflammatory cyto-\nkine, IL-10 is produced primarily by\nmonocytes and Th-2 lymphocytes, and can\ninhibit the synthesis of proinflammatory\ncytokines and suppresses antigen presenta-\ntion.16 High or medium concentrations of\nIL-6 or IL-10 have been associated with\nhigher mortality in patients with\npneumonia, and the highest risk of death\nThe present study evaluated changes in\ncytokine levels associated with two different\nanaesthetics, propofol and sevoflurane,\nFigure 1.

The results showed\nthat serum TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-10 levels\ndecreased over time in both groups. One of\nthe main reasons may have been that FFB is\nbeneficial to the identification of infection,\nand the therapeutic effects of bronchoalveo-\nlar lavage may influence treatment outcomes\nin cases of pneumonia. The present data\nwere in contrast to another study,18 in which\nserum proinFammatory cytokines increased\nfollowing bronchoalveolar lavage in mech-\nanically ventilated patients receiving mid-\nazolam sedation throughout bronchoscopy.\nThe main difference between the two studies\nwas selection of agents for sedation/anaes-\nthesia and the experimental subject.\nThe present study also found that IL-6\nwas lower in the sevoflurane group at 4 h\nand 1 day following FFB compared with the\npropofol group. Two main factors that can\ninduce serum cytokine changes during FFB\nare stress stimuli and anaesthesia, however,\nboth groups employed the same bronchos-\ncopist and displayed identical serum stress\nhormone changes, so it may be reasonable to\ninfer that the different anaesthetics influ-\nenced the release of cytokines in the present\nstudy.\nAnaesthetics and sedative agents are\nknown to possess immunomodulatory activ-\nities.19 Propofol pretreatment has been\ndemonstrated to significantly suppressed\nthe lipopolysaccharide-induced toll-like\nreceptor 4, monocyte differentiation antigen\nCD14, and TNF gene expression in an\nin vitro study.20 Similar immunomodulatory\neffects have been shown in vitro for sevo-\nflurane, whereby sevoflurane reduced the\nrelease of inflammatory mediators in endo-\ntoxin injured alveolar epithelial cells.21\nA clinical study also suggested that inflam-\nmatory responses induced by one-lung\nTable 1.

Stimulation of\nopioid receptors on monocytes leads to a\nreduction in intracellular cyclic adenosine\nmonophosphate, followed by a reduction in\ncytokine production.24 In the present study,\nboth groups received identical opioid regi-\nmens, however, children who received sevo-\nflurane showed reduced cytokine levels\ncompared with those who received propofol.\nThis may be because the effect of sevoflurane\nand propofol on cytokines is due to different\nmechanisms, and the alveolar epithelial cells\nmay be influenced by direct contact with\nsevoflurane.21 In addition, the bronchodila-\ntion effect of sevoflurane may make the\nbronchoalveolar lavage more thorough\ncompared with use of propofol, which may\nbe beneficial to recovery in patients with\npneumonia, and thus impact the release of\ncytokines.\nThere are some limitations associated\nwith the present study. First, this was a\nsingle centre trial and sample sizes are\nrelatively small. Secondly, this study could\nnot be blinded completely due to the odour\nof sevoflurane, which may have influenced\nthe results relating to duration of bronchos-\ncopy and anaesthesia. Thirdly, the effects of\nthe two agents on long term outcomes, such\nas antibiotic use, inpatient costs, and patient\noutcomes, were not studied, and should be\nTable 3.

Finally, the aim of the present\nstudy was to identify whether there was a\ndifference in patient cytokine levels between\nuse of propofol versus sevoflurane in FFB.\nThe Chinese clinical trial registry [http://\nwww.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj\u00bc\nwould be recruited to investigate cytokine\nlevels in healthy children versus children\nwith community-acquired pneumonia (pro-\npofol and sevoflurane groups). Patients with\npneumonia have been shown to display\nhigher levels of cytokines compared with\nhealthy controls,25 therefore, the healthy\ncontrol group was not recruited.\nIn conclusion, the present results demon-\nstrated that sevoflurane was associated with\ndecreased circulating IL-6 and IL-10 levels\ncompared with propofol, following FFB in\nchildren with community-acquired pneumo-\nnia. As the severity of pneumonia is reflected\nby higher cytokine levels in the blood, it\ncould be inferred that sevoflurane may be\nmore beneficial to the recovery of commu-\nnity-acquired pneumonia compared with\npropofol, however, further studies are\nrequired to test this hypothesis.\n"
