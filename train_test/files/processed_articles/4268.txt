    "abstract": "Abstract. Inattentional blindness--the failure to see visible and otherwise salient events when one\nis paying attention to something else--has been proposed as an explanation for various real-world\nevents. In one such event, a Boston police officer chasing a suspect ran past a brutal assault and\nwas prosecuted for perjury when he claimed not to have seen it. However, there have been no\nexperimental studies of inattentional blindness in real-world conditions. We simulated the Boston\nincident by having subjects run after a confederate along a route near which three other confederates\nstaged a fight. At night only 35% of subjects noticed the fight; during the day 56% noticed. We\nmanipulated the attentional load on the subjects and found that increasing the load significantly\ndecreased noticing. These results provide evidence that inattentional blindness can occur during\nreal-world situations, including the Boston case.\n",

An undercover officer named Michael\nCox had arrived on the scene moments earlier, but other officers had mistaken him for a\nsuspect, assaulted him from behind, and brutally beat him. Conley chased the suspect over\nthe fence and apprehended him some time later. In later testimony, Conley said that he\nran right past the place where Cox was under attack, but he claimed not to have seen the\nincident. The investigators, prosecutors, and jurors in the case all assumed that because\nConley could have seen the beating, Conley must have seen the beating, and therefore must\nhave been lying to protect his comrades. Conley was convicted of perjury and obstruction of\njustice and was sentenced to thirty-four months in jail (Lehr 2009).\nWe have used the term 'illusion of attention' to denote the common but mistaken belief\nthat people pay attention to, and notice, more of their visual world than they actually do\n(Chabris and Simons 2010; Levin and Angelone 2008). None of the principals in this case\nseem to have realized that Conley could have been telling the truth (Chabris and Simons\n2010). He could have failed to notice the beating of Cox because of inattentional blindness\nattention was focused on the suspect he was chasing, he may have been essentially blind to\nunexpected events that he otherwise would have seen easily.\n\u00b6 Corresponding author.\nInattentional blindness for a simulated assault 151\nThis explanation is plausible, but generalization from studies using videos or computer-\nized displays (eg, Most et al 2000) to real-world events is not necessarily valid. In laboratory\nstudies participants are seated in front of a screen, under artificial light, indoors, tracking one\nor more objects within a confined display space at close range. Conley was running outdoors\nat night chasing a moving target at some distance.\nAlthough some studies have examined inattentional blindness in relatively complex\nsuggests that it plays a role in many real-world contexts (eg, the prevalence of `looked\nbut failed to see' driving accidents), to our knowledge, only one study has systematically\ndocumented a failure to notice an unexpected real-world event. Hyman and colleagues\n(2010) asked pedestrians whether they had noticed a clown that was riding a unicycle near\nwhere they were walking; many missed it, especially if they were talking on a mobile phone\nat the time. Here we ask whether inattentional blindness can occur under realistic conditions\nsimilar to those in the Conley-Cox scenario. In contrast to the clown study, our subjects\nknew they were participating in research, and they were assigned a task requiring focused\nattention.\nIn study 1 we asked 20 subjects (college students, tested individually, participating for\nmoney or course credit) to pursue a male confederate while he jogged a 400-meter route\nat night in an area lit with streetlamps (see figure 1a). The confederate and subject ran at a\nspeed of approximately 2.4 meters per second, for a total running time of about 2 minutes\nand 45 seconds. At the end of the run, the confederate's heart rate was approximately 148\nbeats per minute.\nSubjects were told to maintain a distance of 30 feet (9.1 meters) while counting the\nnumber of times the runner touched his head. At approximately 125 meters into the route, in\na driveway 8 meters off the path, three other male confederates staged a fight in which two\nof them pretended to beat up the third. These confederates shouted, grunted, and coughed\nduring the fight, which was visible to subjects for at least 15 seconds before they passed by it.\nThe runner touched his head three times with his left hand and six times with his right hand,\nfollowing the same sequence on every trial. The touches always started 30 meters into the\nrun and occurred at approximately 40-meter intervals.\nFigure 1. (a) The area on the Union College campus where the studies were conducted (image from\nGoogle Maps, maps.google.com). The route run by the confederate and the subjects is shown in red.\n(b) A close-up view of the fight from the point where the subjects passed closest to it.\nAt the end of the route, we first asked the subjects how many head-touches they had\ncounted. Then we asked whether the subjects had seen anything unusual along the route,\n152 C F Chabris, A Weinberger, M Fontaine, D J Simons\nand then whether they had seen anyone fighting. Only 7 out of 20 subjects (35%) reported\nseeing the fight in response to at least one of these questions (see figure 2). All seven\nnoticers were able to describe some details of the fight, such as the number of participants\nand the location. We asked about two additional events that we did not stage (someone\ndribbling a basketball and someone juggling), and no subjects falsely reported seeing either.\nThese results demonstrate that under real-world visual conditions approximating those\nexperienced by Kenny Conley, people can fail to notice a nearby fight.\nIn study 2 we asked whether the low rates of noticing resulted only from poor viewing\nconditions due to darkness. We repeated the procedure, on the same route, during the\ndaytime. Now the fight first became visible to the subjects about 20 seconds into their run,\nand it remained visible for at least 30 seconds. Even so, only 9 out of 16 subjects (56%; see\nfigure 2) noticed the fight, consistent with the inattentional blindness hypothesis.\nOne hallmark of inattentional blindness is that increasing the effort required by the\nprimary task decreases noticing of unexpected events (eg, Jensen and Simons 2009; Simons\nand Chabris 1999). If the failure to notice the fight results from inattentional blindness, then\nmanipulating the demands of the counting task should affect noticing rates. Study 3 used the\nsame daytime protocol as study 2, but each of the 58 subjects was randomly assigned (by\ncoin flip) to either keep separate counts of head touches by the runner's left and right hands\n(high load condition) or to follow the runner without counting (low load).\nFigure 2. Results of studies 1\u00ad3: Percentage of subjects in each condition who reported noticing the\nsimulated fight during questioning after the run. Across studies 2 and 3 each additional mental task\nimposed was associated with a decrease of about 15% in noticing of the unexpected event.\nAs shown in figure 2, under a high-attentional load 14 of 33 subjects noticed the fight\n5.03, p = 0.02, supporting the hypothesis that subjects who missed the unexpected event\ndisplayed inattentional blindness. Moreover, participants in the dual-counting condition\nwho did notice the fight counted less accurately (off by M = 1.1 touches) than those who\nthe counting task had a direct impact on noticing. (In studies 1 and 2 there were no significant\ndifferences in accuracy between noticers and missers, p > 0.30 in both cases.) It is possible\nthat the amount of physical exertion during the run, which varied among subjects, would\nalso predict inattentional blindness in this task; future research should examine this.\nInattentional blindness for a simulated assault 153\nIn three studies with 94 total participants, a substantial number of subjects failed to notice\na three-person fight as they ran past it. This real-world inattentional blindness happened\nboth at night and during the day and was modulated by attentional load. Our results represent\nthe first experimental induction of inattentional blindness outside the laboratory.\nKenny Conley eventually won an appeal, and the government decided not to retry him.\nThe inattentional blindness explanation did not contribute to either of these decisions\n(Chabris and Simons 2010; Lehr 2009). Although no scientific study can prove or disprove a\nparticular cause of a specific historical event, our results show that Conley's claim that he\ndid not see the beating of Michael Cox, the claim that led to his indictment and conviction,\nmight well have been truthful.\n"
