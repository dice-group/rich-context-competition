This study examined whether motor symptoms are caused by sensory\nimpairment, executive dysfunction or other factors.\nMethods: We examined the integration of tactile and motor programmes using functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in early stage PD patients compared with neurologically normal\ncontrols, to investigate neural mechanisms underlying movement dysfunction.\nResults: Twenty-two control participants exhibited activation in an extensive network of cortical\nregions involved in tactile\u00admotor integration. Decreased activation in somatosensory and motor\nregions during performance of passive tactile and movement tasks was found in 21 PD patients.\nThe extrastriate visual cortex exhibited greater activation in controls during performance of the\ntasks. In contrast, greater activation in bilateral prefrontal regions was found in PD patients.\nConclusions: These results indicate that the extrastriate visual cortex is a multisensory region\nplaying an important role in sensorimotor integration. The findings suggest that PD patients exhibit\ndecreased activation in the extrastriate visual cortex, possibly related to dysfunctional integrative\nprocessing, and compensatory activity in the prefrontal cortex.\n",

Sensorimotor integration\nis the process by which sensory input is\nintegrated by the central nervous system\n(CNS) and then used to assist in motor\nprogramme execution.4 Compared with\nneurologically normal people, patients with\nPD are more reliant on external sensory\ninformation for motor initiation and\nexecution, suggesting that impaired pro-\nprioception may play a role in PD\nsymptomatology.5\nAbbruzzese and Berardelli5 proposed\nthat some types of movement disorder are\ncharacterized by a lack of inhibition at\nmultiple levels of the CNS and by defective\nsensorimotor organization.6 In addition, it\nhas been demonstrated that patients with\nPD, especially those with early stage disease,\nexhibit severely depressed frontal respon-\nsiveness to sensory stimuli, as tested with\nsensory evoked potentials.7 Forss and\nJousma\n\u00a8 ki proposed that the secondary som-\natosensory cortices are also important in\nsensorimotor integration.8 An increasing\nbody of evidence indicates that, compared\nwith neurologically normal people, in\npatients with PD, the supplementary motor\narea (SMA) commonly exhibits hypoactiva-\ntion, whereas other cortical motor regions\n(such as the cerebellum, premotor area\n[PMA] and parietal cortex) exhibit hyper-\nactivation while performing motor tasks.9,10\nA fundamental question in motor\nresearch is how motor planning operations\nand sensory feedback are implemented in\nthe human brain.11 Studies have indicated\nthat several separate sensory systems are\ninvolved in motor planning, including the\nhaptic, visual and auditory systems.11,12 To\nprepare for and accomplish an action suc-\ncessfully, information from these systems\nmust somehow be integrated. For people\nwith PD, a deficiency may exist in the\nsensory\u00admotor integration process,12 and\nthe prefrontal lobe may constitute the\nneural substrate of this dysfunction.13 Lack\nof a definite correlation with clinical features\nmeans that it remains unclear whether\nabnormalities of sensorimotor integration\nplay a major role in the development of\nakinesia.\nWe used multitask functional (f) mag-\nnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investi-\ngate which brain regions are involved in the\nintegration of tactile\u00admotor information,\nand to determine whether activity in these\nregions differs when patients with early PD\nare compared with normal controls.\nPatients and methods\nParticipants\nThis study was carried out at The First\nAffiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University,\napproved by the Institutional Review\nBoard of Zhejiang University. All partici-\npants gave written informed consent before\ntaking part in the study.\nThe diagnosis of early PD was made by\nX.Z., an experienced neurologist, based on\nmedical history, standard physical and\nneurological examinations, response to\nstandard levodopa or dopaminergic ther-\napy, laboratory tests and MRI scans to\nexclude other diseases. Patients were exam-\nined only after their medication had been\nwithdrawn for !15 h. Patients were assessed\nusing the Unified Parkinson's Disease\nRating Scale,14 the Hoehn and Yahr dis-\nability scale15 and the Mini-Mental State\nExamination (MMSE) while they were off\nmedication.\nPatients with Hoehn and Yahr15 stages 1\nor 2 PD were eligible for study inclusion.\nThese early PD patients, selected by the\nneurologist in the outpatient department,\nwere asked whether they wanted to partici-\npate in this study. After patients signed the\ninformed consent forms, they had to agree\nto routine MRI scanning of brain to rule\nout any other abnormal conditions. All\npatients were recruited from the First\nAffiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University.\nNeurologically normal subjects participated\nin this study as controls. All of the healthy\nvolunteers were from Zhejiang Province,\nChina, and were recruited over the internet.\nThey were matched with the patients for age\nand sex. Control subjects were aged between\n30 and 75 years, had no history of neuro-\nlogical or psychiatric disorders and were\nscreened for dementia and depression using\nthe MMSE before study entry, as well as\nundergoing routine MRI scanning of the\nbrain to exclude any abnormalities. All\nparticipants were right-handed, as assessed\nby the Edinburgh handedness inventory.16\nStudy design\nThe multitask paradigm included tactile\nstimulation, right-hand motor tasks and\ntactile\u00admotor integration tasks, described\nbelow. These tasks were presented in the\nfollowing order: passive tactile stimulation\ntask; motor task; integration task. Each task\nunit consisted of a 30-s performance period\nfollowed by a 30-s rest (control) period\n(Figure 1(a)). There were three epochs,\nwith a total testing period of 4.5 min and a\n5-min control period. The total fMRI time\nfor 19 blocks was 9.5 min. All participants\nwere fully trained on how to perform the\ntasks before the scanning session. During\npractice, errors were recorded and feedback\nwas provided, to inform participants\nwhether their finger movements were correct\nor incorrect. Training continued until all\nparticipants performed all tasks correctly.\nPassive tactile stimulation task\nThe stimuli in this task consisted of two\ncommercially available, round wooden\nwheels: one had a smooth rim; the other\nhad a serrated rim. Both wheels were\nblock design paradigm was used in which\ntactile stimulation was applied in some\nblocks. The duration of blocks was 30 s.\nDuring this stimulation task, an experi-\nmenter manually applied the two tactile\nstimuli (smooth or serrated) by rolling one\nof the wheels over the participant's right\nindex fingerpad. The stimulation was\napplied for 2 s per trial, with a 1-s interval,\nrolling the wheel in a fixed orientation. The\nstimuli were alternated in a pseudorandom\norder, i.e. the order of stimuli seems to be\nrandom, but in fact it was set in advance by\nthe experimenter, with the aim of obtaining\na genuine response. There were 10 trials\nwithin each block and participants were\nnever allowed to see the stimuli.\nMotor task\nThe procedure for this initiative motor task\nwas the same as that for the tactile task,\nexcept that a standard finger tapping move-\nment replaced the tactile task. Subjects\ntapped their own fingers using the thumb\nand index fingers, during simultaneous fix-\nation on visual cues.\nTactile\u00admotor integration task\nDuring the tactile\u00admotor task, an experi-\nmenter manually applied the wheel stimulus\nto the participant's right index fingerpad for\n2 s per trial, alternating in a pseudorandom\norder. Participants were instructed to do\nnothing if they felt the smooth rim, and to\ntap the thumb and index fingers once if they\nfelt the serrated rim.\nfMRI procedure\nParticipants were scanned using a 1.5T GE\nSigna EXCITE MRI scanner (GE\nHealthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with an\n8-channel head coil. Each scanning session\nbegan with a high-resolution T1-weighted\nthree-dimensional volume acquisition for\nanatomical localization (voxel size,\n1 \u00c2 1 \u00c2 1 mm3). This was followed by acqui-\nsitions of echoplanar T2*-weighted images\nwith blood oxygenation level-dependent\n(BOLD) contrast (echo time, 35 ms; flip\nacquired per fMRI session. Each volume\ncontained 22 slices of 5 mm thickness\n(matrix size, 64 \u00c2 64 pixels; voxel size,\nParticipants lay supine in the scanner\nwith the right arm extended and the right\nhand supinated. The arm was comfortably\nsupported by foam padding, which also\nfunctioned to minimize the transfer of gra-\ndient coil vibration to the upper extremity.\nFoam blocks, as well as chin and forehead\nstraps, were used to reduce head movement.\nEarplugs were worn to protect the partici-\npant's hearing.\nFigure 1. (a) Schematic representation of the tasks procedure in a study to investigate neural mechanisms\nunderlying movement dysfunction, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in early stage\nParkinson's disease (PD) patients compared with neurologically normal controls. The cycle was repeated\nthree times. (b) Tasks cue display seen by participants during three tasks.\nUsing the block design paradigm\ndescribed above, each functional run con-\ntained 19 stimulation blocks, each with a\nduration of 30 s. Nine experimental and 10\ncontrol blocks were presented in an alter-\nnating order (Figure 1(a)). Each stimulation\nblock contained 10 3-s trials. Thus, there\nwere 30 trials for each condition per run.\nTwo conditions were contained in each\nscanning session: these were defined as the\n`rest' and `task' conditions. Each condition\nlasted 30 s and was repeated three times in\neach session. In the rest condition, partici-\npants were instructed to relax and focus on\nthe screen in front of them. When partici-\npants performed tasks they were also\ninstructed to focus on the screen.\nImmediately before each block, participants\nwere presented with a visual cue with a black\nbackground, on the screen. The sequence\nand timing of stimuli were guided by\npreprogrammed instructions, displayed to\nthe participants and experimenter on a\ncomputer screen using E-prime software\n(Psychology Software Tools, Sharpsburg,\nMD, USA). All stimulus cues were projected\non a screen positioned outside the scanner at\na distance of 2 m from the gantry (Figure\n1(b)). Participants viewed the projected\nscreen via a mirror mounted on the head\ncoil. During scanning, no feedback was\nprovided to communicate to participants\nwhether their finger movements were correct\nor incorrect.\nImaging and statistical analyses\nThe BOLD signal obtained during perform-\nance of tactile, movement and tactile\u00admove-\nment integration trials was compared with\nthat obtained during the corresponding\nperiod in the control condition. Intergroup\nanalyses were also conducted.\nImage analyses were performed with\nSPM2 software (Wellcome Institute of\nCognitive Neurology, London, UK).\nFunctional images were aligned to the first\nimage of each session using a rigid-body\ntransformation procedure. After spatial nor-\nmalization, images were then transformed\ninto Talairach space17 and smoothed with a\n7-mm full-width at half maximum Gaussian\nfilter. First- and second-level analyses were\nperformed. In the first-level, data were\nanalysed for each participant separately on\na voxel-by-voxel basis using the principles of\nthe general linear model, extended to allow\nthe analysis of fMRI data as a time\nseries.18For within-group analyses, a one-\nsample t-test model was used to identify the\nbrain activity associated with each task\n(P < 0.001, without correction for multiple\ncomparisons), using a cluster size >20 voxels\nas a spatial extent threshold. As this step is\ndependent on the amplitude of head move-\nments, all data in which the head movement\nwas over 5 voxels were abandoned, to avoid\nthe need for corrections that may indeed\ngive a false activation. This procedure has\nFor intergroup comparisons, two-sample\nt-tests (P < 0.05, uncorrected) were used to\nexplore the differences between PD patients\nand normal controls during each task.\nLocations of activated areas for different\nconditions were displayed by superimposing\nthem on the Montreal Neurological Institute\n(MNI) template using SPM2. All\nco-ordinates were reported in Talairach\nspace converted from MNI space, based on\nan algorithm (www.mrccbu.cam.ac.uk/ima-\nging/mnispace.html). Specific areas within\nthe cortex were identified as numbered\nBrodmann areas (BA).\nIn addition, age data were presented as\nmean \u00c6 SD.\nResults\nParticipants\nTwenty-one right-handed patients with\nTwenty-two neurologically normal subjects\nthis study as controls.

A number of visual\nregions \u00ad sometimes referred to as the\nleft occipital lobe (BA 17/18) \u00ad were also\nactivated (Table 2). The cerebellum also\nexhibited activation increases (Table 2,\nFigure 2b).\nIntergroup comparisons showed greater\nactivation in the control subjects compared\nwith the PD patients in the bilateral som-\natosensory cortex (BA 1/3), parietal lobe\n(BA 7/31), left premotor cortex (BA 6), and\nright visual cortex (BA 19) (Table 3). In\ncontrast, less activation was found in\nof control subjects compared with PD\npatients (Table 3).\nTable 1.

These regions could also be part\nof the striatal\u00adthalamo\u00adcortical loop, since\nthis loop includes several parallel circuits,\nincluding the sensorimotor, associative and\ncuit projects somatotopically from the pri-\nmary sensorimotor area, PMA and SMA to\nthe putamen, then through the thalamus and\nback to these cortical motor areas.26,27\nStudies have suggested that the PMd (espe-\ncially the PMdr), is involved in integrating\nspatial information with motor program-\nming to produce precise sequential move-\nment maps that are necessary to facilitate\ncomplex movements.28,29 In addition, the\nposterior parietal cortex is thought to inte-\ngrate visual, somatic and other information,\nand provides a sensory representation of\nextrapersonal space.26\nIn PD patients, the sensorimotor integra-\ntion networks probably include the bilateral\nmiddle frontal gyrus (BA 6/10; Table 2), left\nmiddle temporal gyrus/V5 and the right\noccipital lobe (BA 18), since they are\nactivated during integration tasks.\nObservations in PD patients, including\nreports of excessive reliance on visual infor-\nmation during movement tasks, have sug-\ngested an abnormality in the sensorimotor\nintegration process. Some studies reported\nthat training associations between auditory\nor visual cues in PD patients produced\ngreater improvements than conventional\ntreatments.30,31 Our present findings sup-\nport the notion that visual cues can provide\na supplementary source of information to\nimprove the efficacy of the visual\u00admotor\npathway, since the right middle frontal gyrus\n(BA 6) was activated. Importantly, the left\nmiddle temporal gyrus is involved in move-\nment perception, and the left parietal cortex\nis involved in temporospatial movement\ncontrol.32 We observed abnormal activation\nin the left middle temporal gyrus when PD\npatients performed motor tasks.\nOur study revealed decreased visual acti-\nvation in PD patients during tactile, move-\nment and sensorimotor integration tasks\nwhen compared with controls. Extrastriate\nvisual regions correspond to right BA 18,\nBA 19 and the inferior temporal gyrus (BA\n20). Our results also revealed activity in the\nbilateral middle temporal gyrus/V5 during\nall three tasks in both groups. We hypothe-\nsize that decreased activity in the visual\ncortex may relate to hypokinetic movements\nin PD.\nThe term visual cortex refers to the\nprimary visual cortex (also known as striate\ncortex or V1) and extrastriate visual cortical\nprimary visual cortex is anatomically\nequivalent to BA 17. A hierarchical rela-\ntionship between a primary cortex and sec-\nondary cortices is found in several parts of\nthe brain, including the sensory, motor and\nauditory cortices, which as a whole perform\ninformation processing on a more global\nlevel.33 Several fMRI studies have confirmed\nthat these multisensory areas are involved in\ntactile and movement perception, in normal\nIn accordance with such findings, our\nresults confirmed an activation in extrastri-\nate visual cortical areas during tactile tasks\nand, importantly, during movement and\nintegration tasks in neurologically normal\ncontrols. However, our findings revealed\nsignificantly decreased activity in right BA\ncompared with neurologically normal\ncontrols.\ntranslation and interpretation of visual\nimpressions transmitted from BA 17.\nAlthough simple and complex cells are\nfound in visual association cortex, the region\nis predominantly populated by hypercom-\nplex (both higher and lower order) neurons,\nmost of which are involved in the determin-\nation of precise geometric form, as well as\nthe assimilation of signals transmitted from\nthe primary cortex.35 In addition to visual\ninput, neurons in the superior portions of\npropose that decreased activation at these\nloci (BAs 18 and 19) is likely to be involved\nin the dysfunction of tactile perception in\nPD and may play a role in sensorimotor\nintegration.\nVisual area middle temporal gyrus/V5 is\nthought to play a major role in the percep-\ntion of motion, the integration of local\nmotion signals into global percepts and the\nguidance of some eye movements.37\nResearch has demonstrated that neurons in\nthis area are capable of responding to visual\ninformation, often in a direction-selective\nmanner, even after V1 has been destroyed or\ndeactivated.38 Lesion research has con-\nfirmed the role of the middle temporal\ngyrus/V5 in motion perception, with a\nneuropsychological report of a patient with\nlesions in this area who was unable to\nvisualize motion, instead seeing the world\nin a series of static `frames'39 Our surprising\nfinding of decreased activity in the middle\ntemporal gyrus/V5 in PD patients during the\nmovement task suggests that this region may\nplay a key role in sensorimotor computation\nand movement dysfunction.\nThe present study has some limitations.\nWe were unable to get an accurate correl-\nation in the tactile\u00admotor procedure, which\nis the aim of our next study. The effect of\nmedication was minimized as much as pos-\nsible, otherwise PD patients would have\nbeen unable to fulfil the tasks due to\ntremor. While high-quality images were\nneeded for this study, PD patients find it\ndifficult to control their movements. For this\nreason, early stage PD patients were\ncontinued for >5 years due to the difficulty\nin recruiting suitable participants. The soft-\nware package we used (SPM2) was current at\nthe start of the study, but has been updated\nin subsequent years. Although the older\nversion lacked consistency and was less\ncompatible with toolboxes than later ver-\nsions, we believe the results are still credible.\nBased on these observations, we propose\nthat extrastriate visual responses to object\nshapes and perception of motion might be\nsimilarly integrated, enhancing the popula-\ntion response to sensorimotor stimuli.\nUnderstanding the precise role of this area\nin perception and cognition will require\nadditional research in future.\nTo conclude, the current results provide\nnovel insights into the cortical components\nof sensorimotor integration that may under-\nlie the motor symptoms of PD. In particular,\nour findings suggest an important role of\ninitial sensory input and movement out-\ncomes related to extrastriate visual cortex\nactivity. Future work should focus on\nelucidating the precise multisensory role of\nthe extrastriate visual cortex.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by the Zhejiang\nProvincial Natural Science Foundation of\nInterest Research on Social Development\nProjects of Zhejiang Province (Grant No.\nEducation Department of Zhejiang Province of\n"
