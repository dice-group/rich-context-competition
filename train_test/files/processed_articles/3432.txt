    "abstract": "Abstract. Despite the importance of the arts in human life, psychologists still know relatively little\nabout what characterises their experience for the recipient. The current research approaches this\nproblem by studying people's word usage in aesthetics, with a focus on three important art forms:\nvisual art, film, and music. The starting point was a list of 77 words known to be useful to describe\non ratings of likelihood of use, we examined to what extent word usage in aesthetic descriptions\nof visual art can be generalised to film and music. The results support the claim of an interplay\nof generality and specificity in aesthetic word usage. Terms with equal likelihood of use for all\nart forms included beautiful, wonderful, and terms denoting originality. Importantly, emotion-related\nwords received higher ratings for film and music than for visual art. To our knowledge this is direct\nevidence that aesthetic experiences of visual art may be less affectively loaded than, for example,\nexperiences of music. The results render important information about aesthetic word usage in the\nrealm of the arts and may serve as a starting point to develop tailored measurement instruments for\ndifferent art forms.\n",

Even though not offering a clear\nadvantage at first sight, going to a museum or the opera, listening to music, or watching a\nfilm are pastimes that seem to provide reward in themselves, as many people seek them over\nand over again (eg, Leder et al 2004). In view of such ubiquity and importance of different\nkinds of art it is astonishing that we still know relatively little about the characteristics of\nrecipients' experiences of different art forms. Such relative ignorance is rather typical of the\nfield of empirical aesthetics, which, after first blossoming in the seminal work of Fechner\n(1876) and the new experimental aesthetics approach by Berlyne (1974), has just started\nto come of age in the past few years (see, eg, Chatterjee 2011). The current study aims to\nadd to our understanding of aesthetic experiences of different art forms by exploring the\nimpressions that they leave on the recipient.\nBefore we go further into this issue, some definitions are important: According to Leder et\nal (2004) an aesthetic experience comprises the entirety of cognitive and affective processes\ninvolved in an encounter with an artwork, from mere perceptual processes to measurable\n\"outputs\" in terms of an aesthetic judgment and an aesthetic emotion. As it is certainly difficult\nto grasp the entire experience through empirical measures (see also Leder et al 2005), we\nfocus on aesthetic impressions in the following study. We define aesthetic impressions as\n320 M D Augustin, C C Carbon, J Wagemans\nall cognitive and affective results of an aesthetic experience that are object-related (rather\nthan undirected, such as a mood-state) and that can at least theoretically be verbalised into\naesthetic judgments (Augustin et al 2012).\nThe current study asks what characterises aesthetic impressions of different art forms\nfor the recipient. It approaches this question through people's word usage, as proposed by\nidea that language is key to meaning (Osgood et al 1971). One certainly has to be aware\nthat this approach is not unproblematic. For example, the relation between language and\nmeaning is supposedly not a direct one, but moderated by further factors such as the range\nof terms in question or the speaker's native language (Adachi 2003) and how this language\nallows speakers to verbalise their experiences. In our approach we conceive of language as\none window to meaning--which does not allow an undistorted view but compared to other\n(especially indirect) measures probably still offers relatively straightforward insights. Our\nstudy follows up on a recent paper (Augustin et al 2012), in which we analysed aesthetic word\nusage for a variety of visual object classes, including visual art, faces, landscapes, patterns,\nand several design categories. We found that aesthetic word usage in the visual domain\nis characterised by an interplay of generality and specificity: Beautiful and ugly obviously\npossess universal relevance (see also Jacobsen et al 2004), but in addition, different object\nclasses show different patterns of word usage--each including both terms shared with some\nof the classes (such as modern for the design categories or symmetrical for faces, patterns,\nand houses) as well as terms that are specific for the particular class (such as soothing for\nlandscapes or interesting for visual art).\nIn the present study we aim to find out to what extent this interplay of generality and\nspecificity holds true within the realm of the arts. Hence, we do not concentrate on the visual\ndomain alone, but rather employ three \"classical\" art forms that address different modalities\n(visual, auditory, and visual + auditory) and supposedly cover a wide spectrum of different\nlikes and dislikes of many people: visual art, music, and film. In particular, we ask to what\nextent terms that have shown to be useful to describe aesthetic impressions of visual art\ncan be used for impressions of film or music. Is there something like a universal language\nfor the arts or rather specific aesthetic vocabularies based on art form? What are universal\ndescriptors for aesthetic impressions? And what constitutes the similarities and differences\nin aesthetic word usage between visual art and the other two aforementioned art forms?\nSo far, one can only try to answer these questions indirectly, by comparing the results of\nstudies that were conducted with different samples, different instructions, and in different\nlanguages. For example, Augustin et al (2012) found that the term beautiful was the most\nfrequently listed one when people were asked which words they would use to describe\ntheir aesthetic impressions of visual art and other visual object classes. In general, the most\nfrequently mentioned words for visual art referred to the aspects of beauty, style, colours,\nand to the idea of being special or original. In a previous study, Istok et al (2009) focused\non words that might be used to describe the aesthetic value of a musical piece. They also\nfound that beautiful was by far the most frequent reply, but in their study it was often listed\ntogether with touching. That seemed to be part of a general pattern of people mentioning\nrelatively many terms related to emotions and moods, such as also sad or emotional. An\nattempt to compare the results by Augustin et al (2012) with those of Istok et al (2009)--as far\nas that is possible, given the differences in language and the different samples (Augustin et al:\n178 Dutch-speaking students and members of the department of psychology versus Istok et\nal: 290 Finnish-speaking students from different faculties)--thus indicates that descriptors\nof emotions and moods are more frequent when people describe aesthetic impressions of\nmusic than when they describe aesthetic impressions of visual art. On a more abstract level,\nAesthetic word usage for visual art versus film and music 321\naesthetic responses to music might be more emotional or affectively loaded than aesthetic\nresponses to visual art. Such a notion is perfectly in line with anecdotal reports by many\npeople, and also seems to be indirectly reflected in the empirical literature, where one finds\na growing body of work on the topic of emotions in music (eg, Konecni et al 2007; Zentner et\nTo our knowledge there is no empirical data yet that allow a direct comparison of the\nnature of aesthetic impressions among visual art, music, and film, including the amount of\nemotiveness of the different art forms (for a meta-analysis on brain correlates of aesthetics\nin different modalities, see Brown et al 2011). Important evidence comes from studies by\nBaumgartner et al (2006a, 2006b), who compared emotion recognition and experience of\nmusic, highly arousing photographs from the IAPS (International Affective Picture System)\ndatabase (Lang et al 2008), and the combination of pictures and music. Even though emotion\nrecognition was more accurate following pictures only than music only, both subjective\nratings and psychophysiological measures of emotion involvement (heart rate, respiration,\nskin conductance) were stronger for the music and music plus picture conditions than\nfor pictures alone (Baumgartner et al 2006a). In addition, fMRI results suggested that the\ncombination of pictures and music, but not the presentation of pictures alone, was associated\nwith the activation of a large network involved in emotion processing (Baumgartner et al\n2006b). It is important to note that the results by Baumgartner and colleagues focused on\nthe basic emotions of happiness, sadness, and fear (Baumgartner et al 2006a) and sadness\nand fear (Baumgartner et al 2006b), respectively, making it unclear to what extent they hold\ntrue for aesthetic emotions, too, which are supposedly different (Scherer 2005) and very\ndifferentiated in nature (Zentner et al 2008). Whether a weaker emotiveness for the visual\nmodality can be transferred from relatively simple pictures to a multifaceted stimulus like\nvisual art or not demands further investigation.\nThe current study aims to approach the issue of possible differences in the nature of\naesthetic impressions by directly comparing aesthetic word usages between different art\nforms, within one language and one sample of participants. This allows us to examine\nhypotheses like the one on emotionality systematically and to crystallise similarities and\ndifferences in aesthetic word usage up to the single word level. In contrast to the studies by\nto freely come up with words. That method is doubtlessly very valuable if one wants to create\na first body of aesthetically relevant words (see below), but its results do not only depend\non the general relevance of words, but also on their fluency, ie, how quickly they come to\npeople's mind. This can have the consequence that some words are not mentioned at all,\nbecause they are, for example, more difficult or unusual, even though they are theoretically\nrelevant for a class, and even though people may identify them as such if they are prompted\nwith words. In addition, one can only make direct comparisons of word usage between\ndifferent object classes if a term is mentioned for all classes. Based on these considerations,\nthe current research provided participants with a list of words. This list had been derived from\nthe above-mentioned previous study (Augustin et al 2012), in which participants had freely\nnamed words they would use to describe aesthetic impressions of visual art. The list was thus\nfully empirically based, with all pros (no theoretical bias towards certain words and actual\nrelevance and adequacy to people) and cons (range of words dependent on the sample's\nchoices and backgrounds). In the current study, a new group of participants was asked to\nrate for each of these words how likely they were to use the word to describe their aesthetic\nimpressions of visual art, music, and film, respectively. As the list of words used had been\noriginally created for the realm of visual art, our analyses will primarily focus on comparing\nthe word usage for visual art with those for film and music, rather than making absolute\n322 M D Augustin, C C Carbon, J Wagemans\nstatements about word usage for film or music or the relation of those two. This choice is\nbased on the assumption that a list created for visual art probably misses important terms\nthat are relevant only for film or music and thus does not allow a full picture of aesthetic\nimpressions of film and music.\nGiven the nature of the word list used, we expected its general likelihood of use to be\nhigher for visual art than for the other two classes--a result that can be expected unless the\naesthetic language for the arts shows no specificity at all. Even more importantly, we aimed\nto compare the likelihood of use of each word, to find out what are universal descriptors of\naesthetics, what are words predominantly employed for the visual arts, and for which words\nvisual art is \"beaten\" by one or both of the other classes in terms of likelihood of use. We\nfurthermore had a look at patterns of similarities between visual art and the other two art\nforms, and what these might imply as to the nature of the underlying aesthetic experiences.\nFollowing up on Augustin et al (2012), this research was intended as a further step towards\na language of aesthetics, aiming to bring more systematics to the relatively confused field\nof aesthetic terminology and to improve our understanding of what makes up aesthetic\nexperiences in different domains of art.\nParticipants were 103 first-year students of psychology (88 women) from the University of\nparticipants were native speakers of Dutch. They received course credit for participation.\nIn terms of art background the sample could probably be regarded a sample of \"interested\nlaymen\", who on average visited 2.0 art exhibitions a year (SD = 2.6), owned 5.1 art books (SD\n= 11.0), and expressed a medium interest in art (M = 3.9, SD = 1.4 on a 7-point scale from 1 =\n\"very low\" to 7 = \"very high\"). All participants had given written consent.\nFrom an original group of 111 participants, eight persons had been excluded prior to data\nanalysis, three since their mother tongue was different from Dutch, and another five due to\nresponse tendencies (pressing the same key in more than 50% of cases).\nThe basis of our study was a list of 77 Dutch words that can be used to describe aesthetic\nimpressions of visual art. These words were derived from an earlier study (Augustin et al 2012)\nin which we had asked 178 participants to come up with words that can be used to describe\naesthetic impressions of eight different object classes, including visual art. For details of the\nmethod and the results, we refer the reader to the original publication. The current study\nfocused on the terms that the participants of the aforementioned study produced for the\ndomain of visual art. To make the terms optimally useful for our purposes, we conducted\nsome additional processing steps in addition to those described in Augustin et al (2012). An\nimportant reason for this was that the list of terms used in that study was also to be used in\na field study with volunteers in a museum. With a view to this, it was important to choose\nterms that can easily be applied to judge artworks, and here adjectives seem more useful\nthan nouns, even though a concentration on adjectives may possibly entail the loss of some\nrelevant aspects. The following pre-processing steps were taken:\n\u00b7 Further decomposition of phrases into their components. For example, \"beautiful\ncolours\" would be decomposed into \"beautiful\" and \"colours\".\n\u00b7 Where possible, verbs and nouns were turned into adjectives, to lose as little data as\npossible. For instance, \"colours\" became \"coloured\", and \"symmetry\" \"symmetrical\".\nNouns for which we could not generate adjectives, because meaning changed or the\nadjectives are rarely or never used in everyday speech (eg, \"sculpture\", \"portrait\", or\n\"patterns\") were dropped.\nAesthetic word usage for visual art versus film and music 323\nFrom the resulting set we chose all terms that had been mentioned by at least two persons,\nwhich yielded 103 different terms. With a view to the abovementioned field study to be\nconducted in a museum, this number still seemed too extensive, especially if one counts\non people's voluntary participation. Consequently, we further reduced the set of terms to\nreach a number similar to that used in comparable field studies in the arts (eg, Zentner et al\n2008). This was done by asking three native speakers of Dutch to look for words that were\nvery close in meaning and could possibly be collapsed. The judges worked independently\nfrom each other. Terms were presented in a list in alphabetical order. In those cases where at\nleast two of the judges agreed which terms could be collapsed, we chose the solution they\nproposed. Within each group of collapsed terms, the term with the highest frequency in the\ndata of Augustin et al (2012) was chosen for the final list. If frequencies were the same, we\nbased the selection of the most representative word on the judges' opinions. The reached\nsolution was discussed by two of the authors (MDA and JW) to recheck that the final list\navoided doubles but still was well differentiated. In a few cases, groups of words were further\nsplit up into two--for example, \"interesting, fascinating, thrilling, intriguing\" was split up\ninto \"interesting + engaging\" (= interesting) and \"fascinating + intriguing\" (= fascinating),\nbecause the two subgroups signify very different intensities of experience.\nThe study was an online study programmed in Java. The participants took part in the\nframework of supervised test sessions in a computer room of the KU Leuven. After filling\nin general information about their age, gender, native language, and field of study, the\nparticipants received the following instruction (translated from Dutch):\nIn this study we are interested in your language use: Which terms do you use often, which\nterms do you use rarely and how is that related to the situation? We are most interested in your\nlanguage use with respect to aesthetics. Which words would you use to describe your aesthetic\nimpressions? We will thus present you three times with an object category, together with a list\nof words. Please concentrate on the object category and rate each word on the list with respect\nto the question: Would you use this word to describe your aesthetic impressions of objects of\nthe particular class?\nThe participants were asked to give their rating on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (very\nunlikely) to 7 (very likely). Ratings for visual art, music, and film were conducted in separate\nblocks. The order of the blocks was randomised, as was the order of the list of terms within\neach block. In the instructions for each block we stressed the fact that it was not about what\nthe participants think about particular films, music, or artworks, but about which terms they\nwould use when they talk about film, music, or art, respectively.\nAfter the three rating blocks, the participants were asked three questions related to their\nbackground and interest in art, which have proven useful in previous studies (Augustin et al\n2012; Leder and Carbon 2005): how many art exhibitions they visited a year; how many art\nbooks they owned; and how strong they regarded their interest in art to be, on a 7-point scale\nfrom 1 (very low) to 7 (very high). Overall, the study took about 20 minutes.\nThe mean ratings of likelihood of use across all words were 4.79 (SD = .93) for visual art, 4.44\n(SD = .91) for film, and 4.21 (SD = .86) for music, all lying above the value 4, the theoretical\nmidpoint on the scale 1 (very unlikely) to 7 (very likely). We suppose that terms with means\nbelow this value are relatively unlikely to be used, while terms with means above this value\nhave a relatively high likelihood of use. A repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)\nwith art form as within-subjects factor yielded a main effect of art form, F1, 102 = 36.49, p\n.264. According to tests of simple main effects, all three values differed significantly from\n324 M D Augustin, C C Carbon, J Wagemans\neach other, with p-values < .001. These data suggest that the terms used in this study were\ngenerally suitable to describe aesthetic impressions of all three art forms, but most suitable\nfor visual art, and still more suitable for film than for music. Figure 1 shows the mean ratings\nof likelihood per art form, for each of the 77 terms separately. For ease of orientation, we\nadded a vertical black line in the figure at the theoretical midpoint of the scale, the value 4.\nFigure 1. Mean likelihood of use of each of the 77 terms (translations of the original Dutch terms) for\nthe three art forms, visual art, music and film. The black line marks the value 4, the midpoint of the\n7-point scale used (1 = very unlikely to 7 = very likely).\nTo statistically compare the values for each term between the art forms, we conducted\nrepeated measures ANOVAs on the likelihood-of-use ratings for each term, with art form as\nwithin-subjects factor (for most important results see Table 1). Seven of the terms, figurative,\nhistorical, interpretable, meaningless, sharp, moving (in the physical sense), and flowing lay\nbelow this value for all three art forms. Following the logic explained above, we interpret this\nas a general lack of relevance of these terms, and thus dropped them from further analyses,\nto continue with a reduced set of 70, which are all likely to be used for at least one of the art\nforms.\nInspection of Figure 1 suggests that the terms beautiful, wonderful, original, and special\nare very important for all three art forms, while for terms like detailed, colourful, abstract, or\nexpressive there seem to be relatively strong differences between the classes. An important\nobservation with respect to the current literature on aesthetics is the likelihood of use of the\nterm beautiful as compared to other terms: In the case of visual art, beautiful theoretically\nobtained highest likelihood ratings, but did not differ significantly from the second and third\nAesthetic word usage for visual art versus film and music 325\nTable 1.

For both music\nand film, good even reached higher values than beautiful. In the case of film, this difference\nwas significant, as shown by a within-subjects ANOVA for the three most likely terms for film,\nSince there were 70 separate analyses, the alpha level was adjusted according to Bonfer-\n131.62. Terms that are equally likely to be used for all art forms include, on the one hand,\nterms like beautiful, wonderful, and awful, and on the other hand, meaningful and dreamy,\nand finally, terms related to the idea of being special, like original, special, ordinary, and\ninnovative. Specificity of a term for an art form can theoretically come in different shapes:\nclear specificity, (ie, highest values for that particular art form and low likelihood of use of\nthe term for any of the other art forms) or more in the sense of a tendency towards that art\nform (ie, highest likelihood of use for the art form but also still relatively strong likelihood of\nuse of the term for at least one of the other two art forms). To be able to make a distinction\nbetween these two different forms of specificity, we again used the value 4 as cut-off criterion\nbetween unlikely (values below 4) and likely terms (values above 4).\nWith respect to visual art, it is specific terms related to outer appearance and depiction,\nlike colourful, abstract, or big, as well as style-terms like expressionist and impressionist, but\nalso the term expressive that are clearly art specific. A visual art tendency can be found for the\nterm ugly, as well as for some terms related to creativity and uniqueness, like creative, artistic,\nstriking, and unique. In contrast, we found that several emotion-related terms have a film\nand music tendency (significantly higher values for both film and music than for visual art)\nor a music tendency (significantly higher values for music than for visual art and film), even\nthough their likelihood of use for visual art is still relatively high. This applied to emotional,\ntouching, sad, and happy, respectively, of which emotional and touching were actually more\nlikely for film than for music. With the exception of the term happy, music alone obtained\nhigher likelihood ratings than did visual art and film for classical on the one hand and some\nmood-related words on the other hand, restful, cheerful, while words with a film tendency\nrelated to plot, tension, and interestingness, such as dramatic, boring, interesting, or shocking.\nThere was one term that was film-specific, the term ridiculous.\nWe approached the issue of differences between the art forms also in a different manner,\nby conducting correspondence analysis (CA). CA allows one to plot objects (in our case:\nart forms) and attributes (in our case: terms) in a common space to find underlying\ndimensions and compare profiles. The reason why we did not choose Discriminant Analysis\nto differentiate between the groups was that the relation between sample size and number\nof variables was clearly smaller than suggested in the literature (1.47 in our case compared\nto the minimum value of 2.0 suggested by Backhaus et al 2003). Furthermore, even though\nCA entails a loss of data level in our case (see below), it allows to span general dimensions\naccording to which the differences between groups can be described.\nTo be able to point out differences in the profiles of relevant aesthetic terms between\nthe art forms, we went for an asymmetrical, column-principal solution, with art forms in\nthe rows and terms in the columns (see Backhaus et al 2003). Since CA relies on nominal\ndata, our rating data were transformed to categories by counting each case where an art form\nreceived a rating higher than 4 on a certain term as a classification of that art form under\nthat term. For example, if a person assigned a value of 5 to impressive for visual art and of 3\nto music, visual art would be counted as classified in the category impressive, while music\nwould not. A comparison of the CA solution with the ANOVA results shows that the former\nsupports and clearly crystallises the latter (see Figure 2). Since there were only three objects,\nAesthetic word usage for visual art versus film and music 327\nthe two dimensions found explain 100% of the data. Column 3 and 4 of Table 2 contain the\ncontributions of each term and art form to the two dimensions. Figure 2 visually illustrates\nthe CA solution. Dimension 1, which accounts for 55.9% of the data, is dominated by visual\nart and contrasts it to music (25.8%) and film (11.6%). As to terms, the dimension is mostly\ncharacterised by abstract, expressionistic, impressionistic, colourful, and big. Highest loadings\non the other side of the dimension can be found for cheerful, touching, and emotional.\nTo summarise, one could say that it is outer appearance versus emotion that differentiates\naesthetic word usage for visual art from that for both film and music. Dimension 2 accounts\nfor 44.1% of the data and differentiates film (55.3%) from music (43.6%). The terms with high\nloadings on this dimension are gentle, classical, and soothing, on the one hand (closer to\nmusic), and realistic, shocking, confusing, well though-out, and ambiguous on the other hand\n(closer to film). So what seems to contrast music from film in our data could be summarised\nas mood and style versus content.\n.\nTable 2. Relative contributions of each attribute and art form to the two dimensions of the correspon-\ndence analysis solution (columns 3 and 4).

Plot of the correspondence analysis (CA) solution, with art forms and terms plotted in\nthe same space. Note that we chose an asymmetrical column-principal-solution, which visually\nexaggerates the differences between the art forms.\nThe preceding results primarily focused on differences in likelihood of use between the\nthree art forms studied, both over all terms and on single-term level. In the following, we go\nfurther into the issue of similarities, focussing on the amount of coherence in likelihood\nratings over terms and persons. Pearson's product-moment coefficients between the rating\npatterns over terms (n = 70) for each combination of art forms were r = .31 (p < .05) between\n330 M D Augustin, C C Carbon, J Wagemans\nfilm and music. A repeated measures ANOVA with the Fisher-Z-transformed values of\nthe correlations per term as dependent variable showed all three correlations to differ\nNext, we asked the question: What are the terms that make up the core of the similarities\nof aesthetic word usage for visual art with film and music, respectively? The idea of this\nanalysis was to find groups of terms for which rating behaviour between visual art and music\nand visual art and film, respectively, was most coherent over persons. Starting points were\nPearson's correlations across persons between the rating patterns for each of the 70 terms,\ncalculated separately for the combinations visual art and music as well as visual art and film.\nThe values can be found in columns 5 and 6 of Table 2. We will refer to these correlations as\ncoherence scores in the following. The coherence scores were backward-ordered according\nto size (see x-axes of Figures 3a and 3b).\nFigure 3. Illustration of the core of similarities in aesthetic word usage between visual art and the other\ntwo art forms, (a) music and (b) film. Terms are ordered from left to right according to the amount\nof coherence (correlation over persons for that particular term) with visual art. The lines show the\ncorrelations between the means for visual art and music (red) and visual art and film (blue), calculated\npeu \u00e0 peu starting from the three terms with the highest coherence. Dashed lines mark the dominant\nbreaks in the correlations.\nAs we were interested in terms that play an important role in similarities, we included\nonly those terms that had a mean rating of at least 4 (theoretical midpoint on our scale from\nvery unlikely to very likely) for both art forms involved and could thus be considered to be\nrather likely to be used for both. The order of terms based on the coherence scores was then\nused to subsequently produce correlations between the mean ratings of terms between\nthe two respective classes, starting from the three terms with the highest inter-art form\ncoherence and subsequently adding terms according to their coherence score. Figure 3a\u00adb\ngraphically illustrates the order of the terms (x-axes) and the resulting correlation patterns.\nAesthetic word usage for visual art versus film and music 331\nSo, for example, for the combination art and music we would start by correlating the\nmeans for ordinary, nice, and talented and then subsequently add unique, then special,\nand so forth. Of particular interest were possible breaks in these patterns: From which\nterm on does the correlation between the art forms decline rapidly? Similarly to the logic of\nCattell's Scree plot, the terms appearing before the break were considered as constituting\nthe core of similarities in aesthetic word usage between the two respective classes. As can\nbe seen, the most dominant break in the correlation pattern between art and music (apart\nfrom a large drop between talented and unique, which is difficult to interpret due to the\nvery small number of values in the correlation) happens after exaggerated. If we try to\nsummarise the general pattern, the similarity-relevant terms include beauty-related terms\nlike beautiful, nice, and wonderful, the terms dreamy and lively, a relatively large number of\nterms related to originality or uniqueness (eg, ordinary, special, and unique), a few terms\nlinked to comprehensibility (eg, bizarre and chaotic) and terms that seem to be related to\nprofoundness (profound, dramatic). As to the similarities between art and film, a strong\nbreak in the correlation pattern can be found behind absurd. Therefore, the terms most\nimportant for the similarities between visual art and film seem to be beautiful, dreamy, and\nchic, the two originality-related terms ordinary and innovative and several terms related to\ncomprehensibility, bizarre, strange, unbelievable, and absurd.\n4 Discussion\nThe current study focused on aesthetic word usage for three different art forms that make\nan important part of many people's lives--visual art, film, and music (eg, McManus and\nFurnham 2006). How likely is it that people use certain terms to describe their aesthetic\nimpressions of visual art, film, and music, respectively? Knowledge of this issue is supposed\nto provide important insights into the nature of aesthetic experiences of the three art forms\nand to render useful information for the development of possible measurement scales.\nFollowing up on a study by Augustin et al (Augustin et al 2012), in which participants freely\nnamed aesthetic descriptors for eight different visual object classes, we could draw upon a\nlist of words which can generally be assumed to be useful to describe aesthetic impressions\nof visual art. In the present research we tested a different sample of participants to find\nout with which likelihood each of these words is used to describe aesthetic impressions of\nvisual art and to what extent such a pattern of aesthetic word usage can be transferred to\ntwo other art forms, namely film and music.\nFirst of all, our analyses show that the 77 terms used in this study were most likely\nto be used to describe aesthetic impressions of visual art, and least likely to be used for\nmusic. On the one hand, this validates the findings of our previous study through a different\nmethod (likelihood-of-use ratings rather than free naming of terms) and for a new sample\nof participants: a list of terms that has specifically been generated for visual art should\nalso under different circumstances be more likely to be used for visual art than for other\nclasses. On the other hand, differences in the mean likelihood of use for the three art\nforms suggest that there is no such thing as a universal aesthetic language for the arts, but\nthat aesthetic word usage for different art forms is rather characterised by a substantial\ndegree of specificity per art form. More precisely, we find that the interplay of generality\nand specificity that we identified for aesthetic word usage for different visual object classes\n(Augustin et al 2012) also applies to the realm of the arts: General aesthetic terms that are\nequally important for all three art forms examined here can be found alongside terms whose\nlikelihood of use clearly differs between the art forms.\nAn important observation in light of the literature on aesthetic word usage is the\ndifference in roles of the terms beautiful and ugly: Jacobsen et al (2004) claimed a primacy\n332 M D Augustin, C C Carbon, J Wagemans\nof beauty and supposed that beautiful and ugly span the central dimension of the aesthetics\nof objects. Also, in our recent study on different visual object classes (Augustin et al 2012)\nwe found that those two terms were mentioned frequently for all object classes studied,\neven though ugly was mentioned far less often than was beautiful. In the present study,\nbeautiful can indeed be found among the general aesthetic terms, but for none of the art\nforms do the data speak for a primacy of beauty in terms of an absolutely highest likelihood\nof use. Furthermore, ugly turns out to be of much less general relevance, being significantly\nmore likely to be used to describe aesthetic impressions of visual art than of film or music\nand being even relatively unlikely for film (M = 3.29). Whether this reflects ugly being an\naesthetic term reserved for static visual stimuli in general (in contrast to dynamic visual or\nauditory stimuli) or whether the just-described result is based on more subtle differences\nbetween visual art, film, and music remains to be investigated by future research.\nComing back to general aesthetic terms, these include--apart from beautiful, wonderful,\nand awful--dreamy, as well as a relatively wide range of terms related to the idea of being\nspecial or innovative, like original, special, ordinary, or innovative. The relevance of dreamy\nwas already pointed out by Zentner et al (2008) with respect to descriptors of emotions in\nmusic. According to their view, a term like dreamy could denote the ability of the arts to\nmake people \"self-forgetful and somewhat detached from every day concerns\" (p 513). The\nhigh general likelihood of use of terms related to the idea of being special provides evidence\nthat originality is an aesthetic facet with an important role for aesthetic experiences of all\nthree art forms. This fits in with the view by Markovic (2012; Stevanov et al 2012), according\nto whom fascination, rather than pleasure or liking, is a core aspect of aesthetic experience.\nWhich words are particularly likely to be used for visual art, more so than for music\nor film? First of all, there is the above-mentioned word ugly. Second, there is quite a large\nnumber of terms related to outer appearance or the depiction of content, like colourful,\nabstract, dark, or big, most of which (apart from dark) seem to be visual art-specific\n(ie, relatively unlikely for the other two art forms). This also includes stylistic labels like\nimpressionistic or expressionistic. In a way it seems logical that terms related to outer\nappearance received the highest ratings for visual art, but cases such as colourful and dark\nare not quite so obvious. At least the term colourful is relatively widespread when talking\nabout music (eg, Istok et al 2009), and the association between colours and music has a\nlong tradition, playing an important role in phenomena of synaesthesia (Jewanski et al\n2009; Ward et al 2006) as well as in some artistic conceptions like those of Wassily Kandinsky\nTwo other interesting observations: The term expressive seems to be art-specific, and\nsome terms related to uniqueness, like striking, creative, and unique also received their\nhighest values for visual art. In contrast to the general aesthetic terms special, innovative, or\noriginal, these terms thus may code aspects of being special or unique that are specific to\nvisual art.\nWe now turn to those aesthetic terms for which visual art is \"beaten\" in likelihood of\nuse by film and/or music. Highest likelihood for film is obtained for a number of words\nrelated to plot, tension, and interestingness, like boring, dramatic, or shocking. A music\ntendency can be found for several words related to style (classical) and to mood. As for the\nlatter aspect, the terms might denote some of the musical emotions identified by Zentner\net al (2008), for example, gentle (for Zentner et al: tenderness), cheerful (for Zentner et al:\njoyful activation), and soothing (for Zentner et al: peacefulness).\nYet, the most central observation in the data seems to be that several emotion-related\nwords, such as emotional, touching, happy, and sad,obtained relatively high ratings for\nvisual art, and thus obviously do play an important role in our experience of visual art (see\nAesthetic word usage for visual art versus film and music 333\nalso Di Dio et al 2007), but are still less likely to be used to describe aesthetic impressions of\nvisual art than to describe impressions of film or music or both. Emotional and touching\nactually received even higher likelihood ratings for film than for music, while for the terms\nhappy and sad, which are assumed to refer to discrete emotions (Ekman 1992) instead of\ngeneral emotiveness, this was not the case. To our knowledge, this is the first direct empirical\nevidence, following indirect evidence based on comparing, for example, the results by Istok\net al (2009) and Augustin et al (2012), that aesthetic encounters of music and of film might\non average be experienced as more emotional than encounters with visual art. This finding\nfits in with the results that Baumgartner et al report for non-artistic pictures from the IAPS\ndatabase (2006a), namely that psychophysiological measures and emotional involvement\nratings were much stronger in reaction to music or to pictures plus music than for pictures\nalone. Interestingly, the observation that visual art is less emotive than film or music is also\nmentioned often in anecdotal reports, when people with a general interest in aesthetics\nsummarise their experiences of artworks.\nWhat could be possible reasons? As for film, its power to elicit emotions seems quite\nevident, since most films present fictional situations in which the characters on screen\nexperience all different kinds of emotions. There are relatively clear-cut genres, comedy,\ntragedy, thriller, etc, for viewers to choose a priori among different possible emotional\nsets. With the technical possibilities to create realistic scenes advancing and screen sizes\nand, consequently also, presence, growing (Troscianko and Hinde 2011), the amount of\nemotiveness of films even does not seem to be at its limits yet. Similarly, music is an\nimportant means to share feelings and experiences and regulate social behaviour (Trehub\n2003). This also makes it a traditional and very effective way of mood induction in the\nlaboratory (Baumgartner et al 2006a; Westermann et al 1996), even though the range\nof emotions evoked by music probably differs from the range of emotions in \"real life\"\n(Scherer and Zentner 2008; Zentner et al 2008). How music's power to elicit emotions\ncan be explained has been subject to scientific discussion over centuries (for a current\noverview, see, for example, Perlovsky 2010). It is not the aim here to provide a comprehensive\noverview of possible explanations, but we would like to mention two ideas: Perlovsky (2010)\nproposed the hypothesis that music's emotive power is evolutionarily rooted rather than\naccidental, with communication having split into one less emotive, semantic system, which\nhas evolved into language, and one very emotive but semantically ambiguous system,\nwhich has evolved into music. An aspect of music that may also add to its emotiveness\nis its power to elicit memories (eg, Schulkind et al 1999), which then, in turn, can trigger\nemotional reactions--even though it has to be admitted that the direction of causality\nbetween emotion (or mood) and memory is not clear here and is supposedly mutual.\nObviously, one can think of a number of possible reasons why aesthetic impressions of\nfilm and music might be more affectively loaded than impressions of visual art. Regarding\nthe artistic means of the art forms, it is noticeable, though, that visual art has developed a\nnumber of alternative ways to capture and attract viewers, especially in contrast to music:\nNotwithstanding possible disadvantages on the emotional side, it has obvious advantages\non the content side, which, for example, make it easier to convey conceptual ideas. Likewise,\nmany artists make use of perceptual plays, including visual illusions (see Ramachandran\nand Hirstein 1999; Van de Cruys and Wagemans 2011), which often need no or just a few\nwords of explanation in order to be understood. In contrast, grasping of musical structures\nto become aware of surprising elements, ciphers, or the like, probably requires a significant\namount of ear training.\nThe results of the correspondence analysis validate the differences between the three art\nforms that we pointed out above and yield a nice synthesis of the general tendencies. The\n334 M D Augustin, C C Carbon, J Wagemans\nfirst dimension found is dominated by visual art and by aesthetic terms related to visual\nappearance, like abstract, expressionistic, or colourful. These are opposed to music and film\nand terms related to mood and emotion, like cheerful, touching, or emotional. The second\ndimension clearly differentiates film from music. Term-wise it contrasts aspects of plot,\ntension, and comprehensibility (realistic, shocking, confusing, etc), on the one hand, to\ndescriptors of style and mood (gentle, classical, soothing, etc), on the other hand.\nWhen we turn from differences to similarities, we first see that the correlations between\nthe likelihood ratings for the different art forms reflect their similarity and association\nin real life. Music and film are difficult to discuss independently, since the latter hardly\never goes without the former and films combine visual information and sound into an\nintersensory whole (Chion 1994; Morris 2011). As for the combinations visual art\u00adfilm and\nvisual art\u00admusic, both visual art and film are predominantly related to the visual modality,\nwhereas art and music differ not only in temporal extension (as do art and film) but also in\nmodality. Accordingly, the correlation between the ratings for film and music are highest,\nfollowed by visual art\u00adfilm and visual art\u00admusic, in this order. Even though the similarity in\naesthetic word usage between visual art and film is stronger than between visual art and\nmusic, this similarity yet seems to be based on fewer terms (9 in comparison to 21 for visual\nart and music). This becomes clearer when we analyse which terms constitute the core\nof similarities in aesthetic word usage. Our data suggest that the core of the similarities\nbetween visual art and film is made by beautiful, dreamy, and chic, two terms related to\nthe idea of being special (ordinary and innovative) and by a number of terms that relate to\ncomprehensibility, namely bizarre, strange, and absurd. Thus, one could summarise the\ntopics underlying the main communalities in word usage between visual art and film as\nbeauty, originality, and comprehensibility. In the case of visual art and music, the amount of\nterms related to being special or unique (eg, special, innovative, interesting and ordinary) is\nincreased. We again find terms related to beauty, beautiful and wonderful, the term dreamy,\nas well as terms that may describe aspects of comprehensibility (chaotic, bizarre, and\nexaggerated, cluttered). As opposed to the relation between art and film, the core set of terms\nalso includes lively, as well as terms related to profoundness, like profound or dramatic. For\nboth film and music, the core of similarities with visual art obviously comprises ordinary,\nbizarre, dreamy, beautiful, unbelievable, and innovative. We interpret this as a hint that\nthese terms might constitute a common denominator of aesthetic vocabulary for the arts\nand might thus be very interesting candidates for instrument development in all three art\nforms (see below).\nThis touches upon one of the most important questions regarding word usage in aes-\nthetics: What can we learn from the data with a view to suitable measurement instruments\nto assess aesthetic impressions? The issue of adequate measures constitutes one of the\nmajor obstacles for experimental psycho-aesthetics (Locher 2011; Wagemans 2011). Our\ndata suggest, that, as has been shown for different visual object classes (Augustin et al\n2012) and for music alone (Istok et al 2009), beautiful seems to be an equally safe choice\nif one is looking for a single-item measure to assess aesthetic impressions of visual art,\nfilm, or music. Additionally, though, one should also consider choosing terms that denote\naspects of originality, such as innovative. Another interesting candidate is the term dreamy.\nOther facets of aesthetic experiences besides the ones just indicated probably depend\nstrongly on the art form under consideration. Future studies should thus systematically\ntry to find out what characterises these additional facets and then use this information\nto develop standardised questionnaires to assess aesthetic impressions of different art\nforms. We assume that for visual art the list used in this study can serve as a solid basis\nfor instrument development. To start with questionnaire development for film and music,\nAesthetic word usage for visual art versus film and music 335\nadditional studies seem necessary, since, as explicated in the introduction, the word pool\nused in this study is \"biased\" towards visual art and might thus lack several terms that are\nspecifically suitable to describe aesthetic impressions of music or film or both. Researchers\nwith a particular interest in assessing aesthetic impressions of music may also first consult\nthe Geneva Emotion in Music Scale by Zentner et al (2008), which is a well-standardised\ninstrument to measure emotions evoked by music and thus probably provides a very good\nway of approaching the emotional facets of aesthetic experiences of music.\nAll in all, our study suggests that the interplay of generality and specificity in aesthetic\nword usage that we identified for a variety of visual object classes ranging from visual art to\ncars to geometric patterns (Augustin et al 2012) can also be found within the realm of the\narts. Beautiful is equally likely to be used for visual art as for film or music, and the same is\ntrue for terms like dreamy and unbelievable as well as several terms related to originality. On\nthe other hand, we find clear differences between the art forms in terms of likelihood of use\nof other words. Whereas aesthetic descriptions of outer appearance are (naturally) mostly\nspecific to visual art, it is especially the likelihood of use of terms describing emotions\nand moods that differentiates visual art from both film and music. Doubtlessly, aesthetic\nexperiences of visual art can be very emotional--but on average they may not have as much\nemotive power as experiences of film or music. Several aspects certainly have to be kept\nin mind. First, our participants were students of psychology (mostly women) in their late\nteens and early twenties and not a sample of experts for any of the three art forms. Inferring\nfrom everyday experience as well as from data by McManus and Furnham (2006) about\nthe aesthetic habits of a big sample of mostly young adults and teenagers, we assumed\nthat the participants' interest and involvement with music and film was on average higher\nthan with visual art. Such differences in the personal relevance of and familiarity with the\ndifferent art forms may possibly lead to biases in judgments, especially with respect to the\namount of emotionality associated with the given art form. Furthermore, our study was\nlimited to the Dutch language and thus has to be interpreted within the Belgian/Dutch\ncultural and language framework. Research has shown that language use and meaning\nmay differ strongly between different cultures (Evans and Levinson 2009), and this, for\nexample, also affects the verbal coding of emotions (Matsumoto and Assar 1992; Russell\n1991). Therefore, future studies should not only systematically examine and consider the\nrole of different kinds of expertise but also of cultural background and native language.\nCross-cultural investigations will be able to reveal to what extent the effects reported here\nare universal or rather language-dependent. Another important aspect regarding future\nstudies concerns interdisciplinary cooperation. Given that the field of language use and its\nrelation to meaning is a very complex one (see our indication of possible problems in the\nintroduction), cooperation between psychologists and linguists seems very promising, in\norder to understand the phenomenon of aesthetic word usage in a more holistic way by\ncombining the specific fields of expertise and methodological approaches.\nAs written in our previous paper (Augustin et al 2012), there is still a lot of work to do\nin the realm of aesthetic word usage and terminology, but since we are convinced it may\nteach us a lot about the phenomenon of aesthetic experiences, this work definitely seems\nworthwhile.\n"
