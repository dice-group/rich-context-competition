    "abstract": "Abstract: Increasing emphasis is being placed both on achieving a better fit between sentencing policy and public opinion and on meeting the needs and wishes of victims of crime. There has, however, been a dearth of factual information about the views both of the general public and of victims on punishment. This paper presents findings from the 1982 and /984 sweeps of the British Crime Survey. The British Crime Survey suggests that neither public opinion nor victims' views are more punitive than current practice, and that people favour sentences involving compensation by offenders either to the victim or to the community. The paper also examines what factors make far punitive attitudes.\n\nThis paper presents findings from the 1982 and 1984 sweeps of the British Crime Survey (BCS) on the views of the general public and of crime victims about punishment. A brief introductory review is also provided of the evidence from earlier polls and surveys in Britain. The paper's scope is limited; it is concerned only with attitudes towards punishment and sentencing, paying attention to fear and concern about crime only so far as these affect attitudes to punishment. And it sets out simply to chart public opinion. It does not consider the formation of public attitudes - how opinion affects and is affected by politicians, pressure groups, mass media and the operation of the criminal justice system itself (see, for example, Rock 1979). Finally, it largely skirts philosophical issues about the nature of public opinion and technical ones about the measurement of opinion through sample surveys.\n\nBackground\nIt has long been recognised that the legal system should  command popular support and some legal theorists, such as Dicey (1962), have placed particular emphasis on the dependence of law on public opinion. This is not to say that the criminal law has always marched in step with public opinion. The mandatory death sentences of the Black  Act  and other Draconian legislation of the 18th Century certainly strained public tolerance (Thompson 1975), whilst a modern-day referendum might well put capital punishment back on the statute book. People justify the\n\n\n\n\n\nmismatch, of course, with the argument (inherited from Burke) that it is the job of the elected representative to exercise his own intelligence on behalf of his constituents. But recently there has been more emphasis on the need to maintain public confidence in the criminal justice system: greater importance is being attached to popular opinion about the criminal justice system in general and to sentencing policy in particular (see, for example, Home Office 1984) - the aim being that the sentences handed out by courts should be seen to be just deserts.\n  Whatever weight sentencers may accord to popular opinion, it is clear that the views of victims themselves have quite a different status. Obviously the courts could never accommodate the preferences of the most punitive victims, as the criminal law serves in part to protect offenders from vengeance, but legislators and sentencers are giving more consideration to the wants and needs of victims. This is reflected in growing support for disposals which are intended not simply to punish the offence against the law, but also to put right the wrong done to  the victims. For example, the 1982 Criminal Justice Act enabled a compensa\u00ad tion order to be made as a free-standing sentence; and there are experiments in progress on reparation and mediation. Further, it is increasingly often argued that victims should have more of a voice in the sentencing process.\nThis shift of focus from offender to victim reflects in part a scepticism\namongst criminal justice practitioners about the criminal justice system's potential for deterring or rehabilitating those who pass through it. If deterrence or rehabilitation by themselves provide a shaky foundation for sentencing policy, little surprise that more priority is now given to maintaining the support of victims and the general public. Some might see a move in this direction as populism, others as a welcome whiff of democracy. Whatever the case, it is widely supposed  that those involved in the administration of justice are less punitive than the public. Findings from the British Crime Survey call this belief into question; first, however, an overview of the previous polls and surveys will suggest how such misconceptions about popular attitudes to punishment might have gained currency.\n\nPrevious Surveys and Polls\nThe British public has been polled a great deal on topics oflaw and order, but the most commonly asked questions are about crime as a social problem, the reasons for rising crime and the police. Few polls or surveys have looked explicitly at public attitudes to sentencing, and fewer still have focussed on victims. The review below does not cover work conducted abroad; readers are referred to Stinchcombe et al. (1980), van Dijk (1979, 1984) and Waller and Okihiro (1978).\nViews of the General Public\nPolls on law and order paint a picture \u00b7of a punitive public. Thus, for example, in 1981, 64% of people thought that court sentences were too\n\n\n\n\n\nshort, a figure which rose in 1982 to 67%. In the same survey,  around 60% of people wanted the 'cat' brought back, with only 35% feeling that we should 'continue to do without the cat'. And in 1983, 56% of people felt that tougher sentences would 'greatly reduce the rate of crime generally' (Sources: Gallup 1981, 1982; Marplan 1983).\n  Polls of this sort are probably an accurate  reflection  of  a  widespread belief in deterrent principles - that  heavier  sentences  will  reduce  crime. But the effectiveness and the equity of a sentencing policy are distinct, and these polls cannot tell us whether popular opinion sees current practice as inequitably lenient. Questions designed to find out whether offenders are generally thought to get their just deserts can only be  sensibly  asked  if people hold accurate beliefs  about  current  practice.  There  is  good  reason to think that they do not.  Readily  informative  statistics  are  not  available (let alone read widely); and the  national media  naturally  dwell  on the most sensational cases. Walker and Marsh ( 1984) found that only 39% of their sample could recall the sentence handed out in any  single court  case they had read or heard about via the media; as few as 13% could recall the sentences in two such cases.\n  In interpreting these polls, one must also bear in mind some of the wording of the questions. For example 'continuing to do without the cat' is suggestive of making do. Questions asking generally about crime may put people in mind of serious crime - the comparatively rare offences committed by professional criminals by the deranged and psychopaths - bank robberies, major burglaries, murder, rape and other very violent crimes rather than the much more common crimes which impinge on everyday life - domestic burglaries involving comparatively small amounts, thefts of and from cars and vandalism. Both common sense and research (for example, Brillon et al. 1982) suggest that people regard serious crime in quite a different way from day-to-day offences.\n  Surveys focussing on specific offences point in this direction. Thus Gallup polls have found that around three-quarters of the adult population are in favour of capital punishment for the murder of policemen and soldiers and for the murder of a woman following sexual attack; around 40% favour capital punishment for rape (Gallup 1982). A broader spread of views emerges when less serious offences are included in the list. In a survey conducted by the Prison Reform Trust and The Observer, for example, the percentage of respondents favouring imprisonment as 'in general most appropriate' ranged from 88% for rape and 70% for mugging to 47% for burglary, 35% for vandalism and 8% for shoplifting (Shaw 1982).\n  Findings such as these, however, are insufficiently precise to answer whether sentencing is in line with public opinion - that is, whether people would see court sentences as fair. One way of answering this question is to ask people what they think of sentences handed out in a selection of case\u00ad histories. The other - taken by the BCS - is to ask people  to  'pass sentence' on a selection of hypothetical cases, and then compare the findings. Apart from Walker and Marsh's (1984) experiment, no survey of either sort had been carried out on a general population sample in this country  before  the  1984 BCS.1\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Victims Want\nOnly two British studies before the BCS have examined victims' attitudes to punishment. Shapland et al. ( 1981) interviewed in depth a sample of some 280 victims of violent crime. Victims did not seem to the researchers to be very punitive. In response to general questions about sentencing levels, for example, a quarter of the sample felt that fewer people should be imprisoned; a marginally smaller number felt that more should be imprisoned. Questioned about their own cases, victims were on balance more punitive than the courts; comparing 135 court sentences to victims' preferences as stated to the researchers before the case reached court, 43% were less severe than victims had hoped for, 33% were as severe, and 23% more severe.\n  A study by Maguire (1982) interviewed a sample of over 300 burglary victims. The researchers were surprised by the lack of vindictiveness among victims; fewer than 30% thought that 'their'  burglar  should  be sent to prison. They favoured restitution and community service, and also rehabilitative disposals. There were however some supporters of the birch, the stocks and violent personal revenge. Of course, the judgments in the survey were made, in the main, in ignorance of information about offenders. However, the study also asked victims about punishment in a number of hypothetical cases which provided details about offenders. People were lenient on first offenders, with only one in seven proposing prison either for 18 year old offenders or for 30 year olds. But if the 18 year old had previous convictions, more than half favoured prison; for the 30 year old, three-quarters were in favour. (Paradoxically, a far smaller proportion of those who believed themselves to be victims of professional burglars favoured prison for their own offender - only 31% ). Similar findings have been found abroad (see especially Waller and  Okihiro 1978).\n\nFindings from the British Crime Survey\nThe British Crime Survey (BCS) is a large  sample survey designed primarily to estimate the extent of various types  of  crime;  its  count  of crime differs from that in Criminal Statistics in that it includes incidents which have gone unreported to  the  police  and  unrecorded  by  the  police. So far, sweeps of the survey have been carried out  in  1982  and 1984 (Hough and Mayhew 1983, 1985). 2\n  Besides counting crime, the survey asks respondents about their attitudes towards crime and about factors which affect their chances of becoming crime victims. The 1982 BCS contained only two questions on punishment, which asked crime victims how they would like to see 'their' offenders dealt with. Though by no means definitive, the findings suggested more lenience and a greater public awareness of sentencing options than had been expected; and the 1984 survey set out to explore attitudes to punishment in more depth. As in 1982, all respondents identified as victims of crime in the previous year were asked how they would like their offender dealt with. Further questions about punishment\n\n\n\n\n\nwere asked as part of a 'follow-up questionnaire', administered to a sub\u00ad sample of both victims and non-victims. (See Appendix A for relevant parts of the questionnaire).\n  The findings presented below are drawn largely from the 1984 BCS. First, analysis of items in the follow-up is presented to shed light on the question whether current court practice and public opinion  are in  line. The paper then moves on to examine victims' attitudes to the punishment of 'their' offenders, and finally, some of the factors which make for punitive and lenient attitudes are examined .3\nIs Sentencing Practice in Line with Popular Opinion?\nPerhaps the first question addressed to this issue should be about the accuracy of popular beliefs: do people know what sorts of sentence are typically passed by the courts? The BCS asked only about burglary, and for this crime at least, they clearly do not. Respondents were asked whether a third, a half or two-thirds of convicted burglars aged  21 and over get sent to prison. Twelve per cent of the total sample felt unable to express an opinion; of those who answered the question, only  19% selected the right answer, a half; 74% answered a third, and 7% two\u00ad thirds. In other words, most people overestimate the leniency of the courts towards burglars. The BCS asked only about burglary, but it is very possible that the same is true for other crimes as well.\n  Would actual court practice strike people as too lenient? The BCS tackled this question by getting people to 'pass sentence' in a number of hypothetical cases, and comparing the responses with sentences of the court. Respondents were asked about six offences committed by males, where the age of the offender was varied: half were asked about a 17 year old offender with previous convictions and the other half about a 25 year old, also with previous convictions. A question was also asked about a prostitute soliciting. Respondents were shown a menu of the main sentencing options available to the adult courts, though with some simplifications. For example, the term 'court warning' was used  rather than absolute or conditional discharge; and in the case of 17 year olds 'prison' was used as a proxy for youth custody (which replaced prison and borstal for young adults from May 1983) and detention centres. Answers were then compared to actual court practice for offenders of the relevant age group and offence category (see Tables I and 2).\n  Does this constitute a fair comparison? It should be remembered  that the two sets of figures do not share the same base. In the first place, the decisions of the sample of 'lay sentencers' is made on a handful of cases, which provide basic information about the offender but no detail beyond offence category about the crimes themselves. The court statistics, on the other hand, represent sentencers' decisions in several thousand very different cases; some of the variation between cases will stem from differences between sentencers, but most will arise from variations in the seriousness of offences. Where Table I, for example, shows that 62% of respondents would like to see burglars imprisoned this is not equivalent to a popular wish to see 62% of burglars imprisoned; rather, it means that\n\n\n\n\n\nthis proportion of the sample would like to see imprisonment as the modal sentence for burglary.\n  Comparison is made still more difficult by limits to the detail in which statistics could be provided on court practice. Respondents were asked about offenders with previous convictions: people think criminal history should be an important factor in sentencing - see Shaw (1982) -  and  this is probably reflected in the BCS 'sentences'. However the Home Office Statistical Department were unable to give a breakdown of disposals which included by criminal history; the court figures in Tables 1 and 2 thus include first offenders. The majority of sentenced 17 and 25 year olds probably do have previous convictions. The 1978 Criminal Statistics included tables comparing sentences for first offenders with sentences given to those having previous convictions, for different age groups. It can be inferred from these tables that around 60% of I 7 year olds and 70% of 25 year olds have previous convictions. In summary, the comparison is far from perfect, but it can still offer a guide to whether opinion and practice are in step.\n  Table 1 shows respondents' preferences and court practice in respect of25 year old offenders. Bearing in mind that the comparisons must be suggestive rather than conclusive, the table shows a fair degree of congruence between the courts and the public at least in terms of the use  of imprisonment. The vast majority of people would like to imprison 25 year old robbers with previous convictions; and the vast majority of such offenders are sent to prison. The majority would not like to see offenders of this age imprisoned for shoplifting, car theft or use of cannabis, and indeed, in most of these cases, the offender stays out of prison.\n  Two offences have been excluded from Table 1 - rape and soliciting. In 1983 25 year olds were found guilty in only nine rape cases, and it would be meaningless to compare the sentences of those nine with the preferences expressed by BCS respondents; but a comparison can  be made instead against court practice vis-a-vis all rapists aged 21 or over. The courts sent some 96% of these offenders to prison in 1983, whilst the BCS shows 94% of the public favouring imprisonment for rape. For soliciting, 18% of the public chose a prison sentence, but this is no longer an option for the courts.\n  There was some - albeit minority - support for diversion,  particularly for the less serious offences. It is surprising to find one in twelve respondents recommending formal or informal police warnings for shoplifters aged 25 with previous convictions. It is perhaps less unexpected to find one in seven in favour of cautioning cannabis users. (In each case the criminal justice system filtered out less than 2% of males aged 25 through a formal caution in 1983). And for those taken to court there was considerable support for discharges for these offences. A larger minority of respondents favoured some sort of reparation by offenders. A quarter would like to see burglars and car thieves pay compensation to victims, perform community service or both; the figure for shoplifters approached a third. Where compensation was suggested it was nearly always as an addition to another penalty - in under 2% of cases was compensation recommended on its own.\n\n\n\n\n\nSentences for 25 Year Old Offenders: Preferences of BCS Respondents Compared to Court Practice for Selected Offences\n\n\n\nRobbery\n\nBurglary\nShop- lifting\nCar theft\n\nDrugs\nBCS respondents' pre- ferences (offender aged\n\n\n\n\n\n25 with previous convictions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\nPrison\nDischarge/ caution\nI\nI\nCommunity service\nOther disposal\nJO\nTotal\nJOO\nJOO\nJOO\nCourt practice for\n\n\n\n\n\noffenders aged 25 (including first offenders)\n\n\n%\n\n\n%\n\n\n%.\n\n\n%\n\n\n%\nPrison\nJO\nDischarge/caution\nl\nCommunity service\nI\nOther disposal\nTotal\nJOO\nJOO\n\nCourt figures, relating to both magistrates' and the Crown Court in 1983, provided by Home Office Statistical Department\n\n\nTable 2 compares respondents' sentencing preferences with court practice in respect of 17 year olds. Again, there is a good degree of congruence between the courts and the public in terms of the role of imprisonment. It is clear that both respondents and the courts respond to age  as  a mitigating factor in the sentencing process, and in a similar way. As compared with the 25 year olds, both the courts and the public are less likely to favour imprisonment and more likely to opt for community service, or for a discharge or caution. Comparisons in relation to sentence length are not possible in relation to 1983 data due to the fact that borstal sentences were indeterminate between six months and two years.\n\n\n\n\n\nSentences for 17 Year Old O!fenders: Preferences of BCS Respondents Compared to Court Practice for Selected Offences\n\n\nRobbery\n\nBurglary\nShop- lifting\nCar theft\n\nDrugs\nBCS respondents' pre-\n\n\n\n\nferences (offender aged I 7\n\n\n\n\nwith previous convictions)\n%\n\n%\n%\n\n%\n\n%\nDischarge/ caution2\nCourt practice for\n\n\n\n\noffenders aged I 7 (including first offenders)\n%\n\n%\n\n%\n\n%\n\n%\nDischarge/caution3\nCommunity Service8\nI\n\nCourt figures, relating to both magistrates' and the Crown Court in 1983, provided by Home Office Statistical Department\n\n\nIn sum, and despite the shortcomings of the comparisons, the agreement revealed by the tables as to the kinds of cases which call for a prison sentence does suggest that sentencing practice is broadly in step with public opinion, at least in this very important respect.\nThe Views of BCS Victims\nThe BCS uncovers a very broad spread of crimes, from the very serious to the trivial; to talk of victims' views in aggregate would be misleading. Even within categories of offence this is true. Incidents of vandalism, for example, range from arson to defacing walls. Because of this, discussion here is restricted to two fairly homogeneous offence types - residential\n\n\n\n\n\nburglary involving loss, and theft of cars. These are, besides, well reported crimes - the police were notified in 88% of the burglaries and 99% of the car thefts - and the picture is not altered in substance when the small proportion of unreported crimes are included in the analysis. It should be remembered that whilst victims are well aware of the circumstances of the offence, they are unlikely to have any information about offenders.\n  The BCS tapped victims' attitudes to punishment in 1982 by asking an 'open-ended' question about penalties for their offenders; they were not asked to select a disposal from a list of options, but could choose anything they could think of. Respondents showed some awareness of the less obvious disposals - community service, probation, compensation - but 38% of burglary victims and 31% of victims of car theft opted for a prison sentence; fines were also popular. In 1984 respondents were offered a list of options on a showcard. When reminded in this way of alternatives to the obvious options, victims were less likely to select imprisonment and fines (see Table 3).\nPenalties Specified by Victims of Burglary and Car Theft\nBurglariesCar thefts\n\n%%\n\nYear + in  prison Up to 1 yr in prison Fine\nCommunity Service Probation, susp. sentence Just compensation Discharge or caution Other/DK/Depends\n\nTotal\n\nWeighted data Unweighted n =\n(Percentages do not total 100% due to rounding)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that no information is available for the majority of these offenders, it is impossible to say how closely victims' preferences are in line with practice; but it is clear that there is no substantial mismatch in terms of severity of sentence. The exceptions, as in the previous section, is in victims' preparedness to see offenders warned - either by the courts or the police, and in their enthusiasm for reparation. The  'compensation' category in Table 3 refers to victims who wanted reparation from the offender and nothing else; a further third of victims of both burglary and\n\n\n\n\n\ncar theft wanted compensation and some other punishment. These seems to be a clear desire amongst victims that offenders should make some redress for the harm they have caused.\nWhat Determines Attitudes to Sentencing?\nSome of the variation in attitudes to sentencing can be explained  simply by generation and class differences. When the follow-up sample (of the general public) were asked about suitable punishments, people aged over 60 favoured long prison sentences more than those aged between 31 and 60, who in turn were more tough-minded than people aged under 30. This was true for all seven crimes which were asked about, and for both 17 and 25 year old offenders. The proportion favouring any length of custodial sentence rose markedly with age for the less serious crimes: thus 18% of the over 60s considered imprisonment appropriate for 25 year old shoplifters as compared with 8% of those aged 30 or under.\n  Turning to class, attitudes of manual workers and their families were tougher than those of non-manual workers - as measured by their preference for custodial sentences of a year or more - and this is especially marked for the so-called 'victimless crimes' - cannabis use and soliciting for prostitution. Non-manual workers were more likely to select discharge, community service, probation and suspended sentence. Table 4 shows how age and class affect preferences for long prison sentences in the case of burglary. Differences between the sexes were marginal except in the items about rape and soliciting. More men than women favoured custodial sentences of a year or more for rapists; and more women than men favoured imprisonment of any duration for the offence of soliciting.\nAttitudes to Punishment of Burglars: Percentage of BCS Respondents Favouring Custodial Sentences of a Year or More, by Age and Class\nPercentage of respondents favouring one or more years in prison for:\n\n\n\n\n\nRespondents aged 61+\n\nI 7  year old burglar25 year old burglar\n%%\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-manual Manual\n\n%%\n\n\n\nWeighted data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo fear and anxiety about crime lead to punitive attitudes? Answers  to this question must take into account the fact that older people tend to favour heavier sentences than younger. Table 5 shows the percentage of BCS respondents favouring long prison sentences for 25 year old burglars; it is clear that within each age-band, those who say they are 'very worried' about burglary are tougher on burglars than those who are less anxious. Similar patterns of findings emerge for the other offences covered by the follow-up questionnaire.\n\nAttitudes to Punishment of Burglars: Percentage of BCS Respondents Favouring Custodial Sentence of a Year or More, by Age and Fear of Burglary (25 Year Old Burglar)\nVery worriedNot very worried\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRespondents aged 61+\n\n% favouring year or more in prison\n\n% favouring year or more in prison\n%\n\n\n\nWeighted data\n\n\nIf Table 5 is an example of social research proving the obvious, findings about the relationship between experience as a victim and punitiveness are not. The BCS found no evidence to suggest that being a victim of crime makes for generally punitive attitudes. This was true when victims of all offences were considered together; and differences still failed to emerge when burglary victims were compared to others on their attitudes towards the punishment of burglars, and those who had had vehicles stolen were compared to others on attitudes towards car thieves. Thus  61% of burglary victims thought that the hypothetical 25 year old burglar should be imprisoned, as against 62% of non-victims; 23% of victims of car theft would imprison the 25 year old car thief, in contrast to 22% of non\u00ad victims. For the 17 year old burglar, 54% of victims opted for prison sentences and 51% of non-victims; the respective figures for the 17 year old car thief were both 20%.\n  Victims were no more punitive than others in their responses to the hypothetical cases posed in the follow-up questionnaire, but obviously there was considerable variation amongst victims in attitudes towards the disposal of offenders in their own cases. Examining what makes some victims more punitive than others, analysis is restricted, as before, to burglary (involving loss) and vehicle theft; findings are thus based on\n\n\n\n\n\nsmall samples - 260 burglary victims and l 70 victims of car theft. This said, for burglary victims no clear difference emerged between the sexes or between different age-groups and classes; and for victims of car theft, the only such difference was that many more men than women favoured imprisonment of car thieves - 32% as against 6%. Not surprisingly, what differentiated victims' attitudes towards punishment of 'their' offenders most clearly was the severity of the crime. Those whose losses were high or whose property had been damaged proposed more severe sentences than others.\n\nSummary  and Conclusions\nThe BCS offers findings which provide a corrective to widely held misconceptions about popular attitudes to punishment. To summarise the main findings:\n* people seem to think the courts more lenient towards burglars than they actually are;\n* public attitudes about appropriate sentences seem to be broadly in\nline with practice;\n* there is some public support for diversion of minor offenders from the court process;\n* the principle of reparation by offenders, either to individual victims\nand to the wider community, has some public support and the support of victims in particular;\n* the older people are, the more tough-minded they are about punishment; and manual workers and their families are generally more punitive than non-manual workers;\n* those who are most fearful of crime tend to advocate heavier sentences than others;\n* victims of crime are no more punitive than others.\n  These findings suggest that policy-makers and courts can treat with a degree of scepticism the claims often made by the media that public opinion demands a tougher line with offenders. The BCS offers no evidence to suggest widespread punitive attitudes amongst the public. If, as the results of the BCS suggest, opinion and practice are broadly in line, there is probably leeway to introduce more lenient or heavier sentences without losing public support.\n  Support for more lenient sentences, however, would probably only be forthcoming if the public were better informed about current practice. If people believe the courts to be more lenient than they actually are, they may well feel that heavier sentences are called for, and may find proposals for lighter sentences unacceptable. Confidence in the criminal justice system might perhaps be improved if people had a more accurate idea of sentencing levels.\nAccording to the BCS, there is some support - especially among victims\n- for the principle of offender reparation, whether amends are made to the community or to the victim. Thus recent emphasis on reparation,\n\n\n\n\n\nexemplified by the introduction of the compensation order as a disposal in its own right, and by the extension of community service to 16 year olds, fits well with the prevailing public mood.\n  The finding that those who are anxious about crime tend to be punitive bears on policies to reduce fear of crime. The BCS cannot say whether anxiety about crime leads to punitiveness or simply, certain sorts of people are both anxious and punitive. It nevertheless raises the possiblity that effective policies of fear reduction might lessen pressure for heavier sentences.4\n\nAppendix A: Extracts from BCS Questionnaire on Attitudes to Punishment\nFollow-Up {General Population) Sample\nQ.18(b) SHOWCARD K On this card are the actions the police can take or the various sentences which a court can give to people.

Unfortunately for the purposes of this paper,  the  study  demanded portrayal of unusual incidents, and  it  is  impossible  to  assess  the  typical sentences for such cases.\n3 Most of the BCS findings in this paper were drawn from  the 'follow up'  sample of the 1984 BCS. This had a sample size of 6,600: this over-represents victims of crime, and data have been weighted to restore repesentativeness of the general public in England and Wales over the age of 15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Given the size of the follow-up sample, sampling error will be small. For example, a statistic of 20% in Table I, which is based on a sample of 3,270, would be unlikely to vary by more than 2% if repeated samples of this size had been interviewed. (Design effects make the sample error larger than for a simple random sample; a v'deffof 1.4 has been assumed).\n  Where findings are presented on victims' attitudes towards the punishment of their own offenders, findings refer only to the victims of burglary involving loss (BCS offence code 52) and car theft (BCS offence code 60). The sample size here is small (430 in total), and findings may be subject to  considerable sampling error.\nFor full technical details about the survey design see N.O.P.
