Previous\nstudies have shown that COX-2 participates\nin tumour development and progression by\npromoting cell proliferation, inhibiting cell\napoptosis, and promoting tumour angiogen-\nesis.2,3 COX-2 expression is also shown to be\nhigh in gastrointestinal and urinary cancer\ntissues, and COX-2 has been shown to\ninduce tumour angiogenesis, and promote\ntumour invasion and metastasis.4\u00ad8\nInformation regarding the role of COX-2\nin the development of renal cell carcinoma,\nhowever, is limited.\nIn the present study, tumour angiogenesis\nand expression of COX-2 and vascular\nendothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A in\nrenal cell carcinoma were investigated\nusing immunohistochemical methods. The\nrole of COX-2 and VEGF-A in tumour\nangiogenesis, and the related mechanisms,\nwere discussed.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population and archived tissue\nParaffin-wax embedded specimens of renal\ncell carcinoma tissue were randomly selected\nfrom those collected and archived at The\nUnion Hospital of Fujian Medical\nUniversity, Fuzhou, China between\nFollowing initial dissection, tissue samples\nhad been fixed overnight in paraformalde-\nhyde then processed using standard paraffin-\nwax embedding methods. All specimens\nwere reconfirmed by a pathologist. Tissue\nsamples were classified using the World\nHealth Organization (WHO) pathological\ngrading system9 and Robson pathological\nstaging system.10 Normal renal paraffin-wax\nblock tissue specimens were also selected\nfrom archives, obtained from the healthy\ntissue surrounding renal cell carcinoma\ntissue in patients diagnosed with renal cell\ncarcinoma. These were pathologically con-\nfirmed and used as controls. There were no\ninclusion or exclusion criteria. The study\nwas approved by The Union Hospital of\nFujian Medical University ethical review\ncommittee and patients provided written or\nverbal informed consent for their samples to\nbe included in the study.\nImmunohistochemical detection of COX-2\nand VEGF-A expression\nRabbit antihuman COX-2 monoclonal pri-\nmary antibody, mouse antihuman VEGF-A\nmonoclonal primary antibody, and rabbit\nantihuman factor VIII-related antigen pri-\nmary antibody were purchased from Cell\nSignaling Technology (Danvers, MA,\nUSA). Streptavidin\u00adbiotin\u00adperoxidase com-\nplex kit and benzidine chromogenic kit were\npurchased from Fuzhou Maixin Bio-tech\n(Fujian, China).\nArchived paraffin block tissue specimens\nwere cut into 5 mm-thick sections. Heat\ninduced epitope retrieval was performed\nprior to immunohistochemical staining by\ndeparaffinizing the sections with two\nchanges of xylene for 5 min each, then\nrehydrating with two changes each of\nand 80% ethanol (1 min each), with a final\nrinse in distilled water. The slides were then\nimmersed for 20 min in a staining dish\ncontaining 1 mM ethylenediaminetetra-\nacetic acid (EDTA) buffer (with 0.05%\nthen removed from the water bath to room\ntemperature and the slides were allowed to\ncool for 20 min. Sections were then rinsed\ntwice for 2 min each using 0.02 M phosphate\nbuffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2) Tween.\nImmunohistochemical detection was per-\nformed following the manufacturers'\ninstructions. Briefly, sections were incubated\nwith normal goat serum for 30 min at room\ntemperature. The serum was discarded and\navidin blocking was then performed by\nThe blocking solution was then discarded\nand either rabbit antihuman COX-2 pri-\nPBS, pH 7.2), mouse antihuman VEGF-A\nprimary antibody (1 : 200 dilution), or rabbit\nantihuman factor VIII-related antigen pri-\nmary antibody (1 : 200 dilution) were added,\nand sections were incubated for 1 h at room\ntemperature. Sections were then washed\nthree times (5 min each) in PBS-Tween\nfollowed by incubation with goat antimouse\nor mouse antirabbit Immunoglobulin\nSections were washed again three times\n(5 min each) in PBS-Tween, and incubated\nwith streptavidin horseradish peroxidase for\n30 min at 37C, followed by washing three\ntimes (5 min each) time in PBS-Tween.\nSlides were coloured using 3,30-diaminoben-\nzidine (DAB), incubated in the dark at room\ntemperature for 10 min then washed with\ndistilled water. Slides were finally stained\nwith haematoxylin.

Vessels with diameter\ngreater than eight red blood cells or with\nthick smooth muscle or hardened areas were\nexcluded. Five low-power fields (200 \u00c2mag-\nnification) with high microvessel density\nwere selected for microvessel counting\nusing a high-power lens (400 \u00c2magnifi-\ncation). For each sample, microvessel\ndensity was calculated as the mean of five\nfields of view.\nStatistical analyses\nData were presented as n incidence or\nmean \u00c6 SD. 2-test was used to assess\nbetween-group differences and k-analysis\nwas used to assess the correlation between\nCOX-2 and VEGF-A expression levels. All\ntests were performed using SPSS\u00d5 software,\nversion 10.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA),\nand a probability less than P < 0.05 was\nconsidered to be statistically significant.\nResults\nRenal cell carcinoma tissue specimens from\n33 patient cases were included (20 male and\nage 54.3 years). On the basis of the WHO\nseven specimens were classified as grade\n, respectively. On the basis\nof the Robson pathological staging system,\nfour, 16, eight and five specimens were\nclassified as stage I, II, III, and IV, respect-\nively. Among the specimens, 20 cases were\nclear cell carcinoma, eight were granular cell\ncarcinoma, and five cases were clear\u00adgranu-\nlar mixed cell carcinoma.\nA total of 12 cases of normal renal tissue\nwere pathologically confirmed and used as\ncontrols. The selected specimens were from\neight male and four female patients, aged\nOn the basis of the WHO pathological\ngrading system, four, six and two specimens\nwere classified as grade G1\n, ,\nrespectively. On the basis of the Robson\npathological staging system, two, six, three\nand one specimens were classified as stage I,\nII, III, and IV, respectively. Among the\nspecimens, six cases were from patients with\nclear cell carcinoma, three had granular cell\ncarcinoma, and three had clear\u00adgranular\nmixed cell carcinoma.\nCOX-2 and VEGF-A expression in renal\ncell carcinoma\nRenal cell carcinoma COX-2 expression\nappeared as brown or dark brown staining\nthat was mainly diffusely distributed in the\ncytoplasm and in parts of the nucleus of\ntumour cells, and sporadically distributed in\ninterstitial tissue. COX-2 expression was\neither weakly positive or not expressed in\nthe stroma (Figure 1). VEGF-A expression\nappeared as brown or dark-brown staining,\nmainly in the cytoplasm and membrane of\nthe tumour cells, but also in the cytoplasm of\nstromal vascular epithelial cells (Figure 2).\nNormal renal tissues were lightly stained in\nthe collecting system or pink in the cyto-\nplasm.

COX-2 expres-\nsion has been shown to correlate positively\nwith tumour size, grade, and stage of renal\ncell carcinoma.27 In addition, progression-\nfree survival is shown to be low in patients\nwith renal cancer and high COX-2 expres-\nsion, and the survival rate of patients is\nnegatively correlated with tumour grade,\nstage and COX-2 expression.28 Consistent\nwith the results of these published studies,\nthe present study showed that COX-2 was\ncarcinoma cases, which was significantly\nhigher than the rates of expression observed\nin normal tissue. The present study results\nsuggest that COX-2 expression is related to\nthe pathogenesis of renal cancer.\nIt is thought that VEGF-A is the most\neffective angiogenesis regulatory factor with\nthe highest specificity. VEGF-A is also one\nof the determinants of tumour angiogenesis\nthat can efficiently and specifically have\nmitogenic and chemotactic effects on endo-\nthelial cells, induce angiogenesis and\ningrowth of host capillaries, and affect\ntumour growth, invasion and metastasis.29\nThe pathological pattern of renal cell\ncarcinoma is reported to be associated with\npathologically confirmed renal cell carcin-\noma cases found that COX-2 and VEGF-A\nexpression were positively correlated.31\nCOX-2 has been shown to upregulate\nVEGF-A expression in urinary prostate\ncancer cell lines, and inhibition of COX-2\nexpression can result in inhibition of VEGF\nexpression.24 Another study32 reported that\nCOX-2 can promote the synthesis of pros-\ntaglandins (such as prostaglandin E2 and\ninteraction with the relevant receptor.23\nCOX-2 can also induce upregulation of\nVEGF expression by entering the nucleus\nthrough nuclear receptors, disrupting the\nregulation of VEGF expression, leading to\nincreased VEGF, and can induce tumour\nof renal cell carcinoma cases, which was\nsignificantly higher than the rate of expres-\nsion in normal renal tissue surrounding the\ncarcinoma; further analysis showed that\nCOX-2 and VEGF-A expression were corre-\nlated. Microvessel density in COX-2-posi-\ntive or VEGF-A-positive renal cell\ncarcinoma cases was significantly higher\nthan in renal cell carcinoma cases that were\nnegative for COX-2 or VEGF-A (P < 0.03).\nThese findings suggest that COX-2 and\nVEGF-A are both involved in tumour\nangiogenesis.\nThe results of the present study may be\nlimited by the relatively small number of\nsamples and the type of tissues used as\ncontrols. Further research is therefore\nrequired to understand the proliferation,\ninvasion and metastatic mechanisms of\nrenal cell carcinoma.\nRenal cell carcinoma is an archetypal\nsolid tumour with highly active angiogen-\nesis, and a high level of vascularization.33\u00ad35\nBecause of its particular genetic properties\nand heterogeneity, renal cell carcinoma is\nextremely insensitive to conventional\nchemotherapy and radiotherapy.36 Thus,\nrenal cell carcinoma is a popular target\ntumour for clinical research relating related\nto angiogenic suppressors.37 An investiga-\ntion that used an in vitro and in vivo model\nsuggested that a combination of several\nantiangiogenesis factors may be more effect-\nive than single factors alone in treating renal\ncancer.37 Additional studies are necessary to\nclarify the angiogenic mechanisms in renal\ncell carcinoma and targeted antiangiogen-\nesis therapy.38,39 The present study further\nsupports other evidence that COX-2 and\nVEGF-A expression is upregulated in renal\ncell carcinoma, and suggests that microves-\nsel density is increased in cancer tissues that\nexpress COX-2 and VEGF-A. These results\nprovide additional information that will be\nhelpful in the development of preventative\nand therapeutic options for renal cancer.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
