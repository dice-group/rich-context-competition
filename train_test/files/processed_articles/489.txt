Accordingly, the three goals of our study were\nto investigate the subtypes of major depressive disorder in a\nrepresentative sample of US adolescents using LCA; to test the\ncomparability of this structure across two nationally representative\nsamples of adolescents and adults; and to examine socio-\ndemographic and clinical correlates of derived subtypes across\nsamples.\nMethod\nThe National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) is a\nnationally representative community household survey of 9282\nnon-institutionalised adults aged 18 years and over in the\nUSA.30 Face-to-face interviews were held at the respondents'\nComorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A) is an\nextension of the NCS-R that included young people aged 13\u00ad18\nyears who resided in the homes of NCS-R participants (n = 879)\nand an additional school-based sample of young people\nHuman Subjects Committees of Harvard Medical School and\nthe University of Michigan approved all NCS-R and NCS-A\nprocedures, and all participants gave informed consent prior to\nthe interview.\nAll respondents with a 12-month major depressive disorder\nfor the analyses.

Merikangas\nBackground\nAlthough techniques such as latent class analysis have been\nused to derive empirically based subtypes of depression in\nadult samples, there is limited information on subtypes of\ndepression in youth.\nAims\nTo identify empirically based subtypes of depression in a\nnationally representative sample of US adolescents, and to\ntest the comparability of subtypes of depression in\nadolescents with those derived from a nationally\nrepresentative sample of adults.\nMethod\nwith a 12-month major depressive disorder, selected\nfrom the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent\nSupplement and the National Comorbidity Survey\nReplication samples respectively. Latent class analysis\nwas used to identify subtypes of depression across\nsamples. Sociodemographic and clinical correlates of\nderived subtypes were also examined to establish their\nvalidity.\nResults\nThree subtypes of depression were identified among\nadolescents, whereas four subtypes were identified among\nadults. Two of these subtypes displayed similar diagnostic\nprofiles across adolescent and adult samples (P = 0.43); these\nsubtypes were labelled `severe typical' (adults 45%,\nadolescents 35%) and `atypical' (adults 16%, adolescents\n26%). The latter subtype was characterised by increased\nappetite and weight gain.\nConclusions\nThe structure of depression observed in adolescents is highly\nsimilar to the structure observed in adults. Longitudinal\nresearch is necessary to evaluate the stability of these\nsubtypes of depression across development.\nDeclaration of interest\nNone.\nThe British Journal of Psychiatry (2012)\nindividuals without a current diagnosis may have more\nproblems in accurately recalling their symptoms of\ndepression. A non-hierarchical definition of major depressive\ndisorder was used, in order to allow assessment of psychiatric\ncomorbidity.\nMeasures\nThe World Health Organization's Composite International\nDiagnostic Interview (CIDI) version 3.0 was used for diagnostic\nassessment of psychiatric disorders.33 The CIDI is a fully\nstructured interview administered by trained lay interviewers to\ngenerate DSM-IV diagnoses. The NCS-A used a modified version\nof the CIDI used in NCS-R for diagnostic assessment of\npsychiatric disorders.34\nDepressive symptoms\nWe included the nine DSM-IV symptoms of depression listed\nin the CIDI but separated weight changes from appetite\nchanges, yielding a total of ten symptoms. All variables were coded\nas present or absent; however, variables for changes in weight,\nappetite, sleep and psychomotor activity included a further\ndistinction between weight loss/gain, increased/decreased appetite,\ninsomnia/hypersomnia and activation/retardation, leading to\nvariables with three categories to better capture the differences\nin symptom profiles.\nCharacteristics to describe latent classes\nSociodemographic variables including gender and age were\ncollected in both surveys. Clinical characteristics included number\nof depressive symptoms, number of episodes and age at onset,\nderived from the CIDI; severity, measured with a modified version\nof the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology;35 and\n12-month comorbidity with DSM-IV psychiatric disorders\nassessed in the CIDI (mania, hypomania, dysthymia, generalised\nanxiety disorder, panic disorder, social phobia, agoraphobia,\nspecific phobia, substance use disorder, any binge eating disorder).\nFamily histories of depression and mania were assessed. Further,\nwe collected information on treatment in the past year for\nemotional or behavioural problems. We created variables to\nindicate whether participants had received any mental healthcare\n(out-patient mental health clinic, mental health professional, drug\nor alcohol clinic, admission to psychiatric hospital or other mental\nhealth facility) and any mental or medical healthcare (general\nmedical care, any mental healthcare, and any school services for\nthe NCS-A sample) during the previous year.\nSeveral functional and health indicators were used to\ndescribe latent classes. The World Health Organization Disability\nAssessment Schedule (WHO-DAS) was used to assess functional\nimpairment during the past month (NCS-R only),36 and we\ncreated a dichotomous variable indicating which participants\nhad severe or very severe disability (defined as scoring more\nthan 6 on a scale of 0\u00ad10, based on the Sheehan Disability Scale37).\nWe calculated body mass index (BMI) in kg/m2 based on self-\nreported weight and height. Presence of somatic disorders was\nbased on chronic conditions assessed in the US National Health\nInterview Survey.38 Respondents were asked whether they had\never experienced each of the conditions in this checklist. We\nincluded the following conditions: heart attack and heart\ndisease (NCS-R only), diabetes or high blood glucose level,\nhigh blood pressure (NCS-R only), migraine, and other\nheadaches.\nStatistical analysis\nLatent class analyses were performed using Mplus version 6.1 for\nWindows.39 In LCA it is assumed that an unobserved, latent\ncategorical variable (i.e. class) explains the association among a\nset of observed variables (i.e. symptoms). It computes two sets\nof parameters: latent class probabilities or prevalences, and\nconditional probabilities (estimated probabilities of observed\nvariables given that the individual is a member of that class).\nTen categorical variables measuring depressive symptoms (as\ndescribed earlier) served as latent class indicators, and models\nwith one to five classes were estimated. The final model was\nchosen based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC, smallest\nvalue preferred), the sample size-adjusted BIC (smallest value\npreferred), entropy (highest value preferred) and interpretability\nof the derived classes.40\u00ad42 Respondents were assigned to their\nmost likely class based on posterior probabilities, classes were\ngiven subjective labels based on symptom probabilities, and\ncorrelates of classes were then evaluated in SAS version 9.2\n(SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA) for Windows,\nseparately for adolescents and adults. Class comparisons within\nsamples were performed for correlates with a significant main\neffect (P50.05), and further post hoc tests examined differences\nbetween NCS-A and NCA-R classes. All analyses corrected\nfor the complex sampling design and were weighted to adjust\nfor differential probabilities of selection, non-response and\npost-stratification.\nResults\nThe sociodemographic characteristics of the two study samples are\npresented in Table 1.\nLamers et al\nTable 1 Sociodemographic characteristics of the adolescent\nand adult samples\nAdolescents\nAdults\nAge, years: weighted % (s.e.)\nEthnicity, weighted % (s.e.)\nMarital status, weighted % (s.e.)\nEmployment, weighted % (s.e.)\nNA, not applicable; NCS-A, National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement;\nNCS-R, National Comorbidity Survey Replication.\na. Unweighted.\nDepressive disorder in US adolescents and adults\nModel selection\nIn the NCS-A sample both the BIC and the sample size-adjusted\nBIC were smallest in the three-class model, which was therefore\nchosen as the final model. In the NCS-R sample the BIC was\nsmallest in a three-class model, whereas the four-class model\nyielded the smallest sample size-adjusted BIC and higher entropy\nthan the three-class model (Table 2); additionally, the four-class\nmodel more closely approximated subtypes identified in previous\nresearch,20,21,43 and the current distinctions between atypical and\ntypical depressive disorder subtypes in the DSM-IV. The four-class\nmodel was therefore chosen in the adult sample.\nClass description\nAdolescents\nIn the adolescent sample (NCS-A) the first class identified was\nlabelled `moderate typical' (prevalence 39.9%) owing to a typical\nsymptom pattern characterised by decreased appetite and\ninsomnia (Fig. 1). This class had the lowest proportion of young\npeople with suicidal thoughts. The second class was labelled\n`severe typical' (prevalence 34.6%) owing to a typical symptom\npattern including weight loss, and higher symptom probabilities\nthan the `moderate typical' class. The third class was labelled\n`atypical' (prevalence 25.5%) as it presented an atypical symptom\npattern marked by increased appetite and weight gain.\nAdults\nIn the NCS-R sample the first class was characterised by few\nchanges in appetite or weight and psychomotor changes, and\nhad a prevalence of 14.6%. This class was labelled `moderate'\nowing to its moderately severe symptom pattern (Fig. 2). The\nsecond class, labelled `moderate typical' because of its typical\nsymptom pattern including weight loss, decreased appetite and\ninsomnia, had a prevalence of 24.8%. The third class, `severe\ntypical' (prevalence 44.9%) had a typical symptom pattern but\nhigher symptom probabilities and proportions of adults with\ninsomnia and suicidal thoughts than the `moderate typical' class.\nThe fourth class, `atypical' (prevalence 15.6%), had a distinct\npattern of increased appetite and weight gain.\nComparison of adults and adolescents\nWe performed additional multiple-group LCA simultaneously in\nNCS-A and NCS-R samples to test whether the observed class\nsymptom profiles were similar across the samples. For this\npurpose, we ran an unrestricted model and a restricted model\nusing the KNOWNCLASS-option in Mplus, and performed a\n72 log-likelihood test. In the unrestricted model all parameters\nwere estimated freely, whereas in the restricted model the\nprobabilities of symptoms within classes were held equal across\nsamples. Because the NCS-R sample had four classes and the\nNCS-A sample only three, we used a restriction to fix the\nprevalence of the additional NCS-R class to zero in the NCS-A\nsample. These analyses showed that the restricted model, where\nall three classes were held equal, was significantly different from\nthe unrestricted model (P = 0.03), but a model restricting only\ntwo classes was not significantly different (P = 0.43). These results\nindicate that the symptom profiles of the severe typical and\natypical (but not the moderate typical) classes were the same\nacross samples. Comparison of the prevalence rates of the adult\nsevere typical and adult atypical classes with the prevalence rates\nof their adolescent counterparts showed that these rates differed\nsignificantly, with adolescents having a higher rate of the atypical\nsubtype and a lower rate of severe typical subtype.\nCorrelates\nAdolescents\nThe sociodemographic, clinical and health correlates of the\nidentified subtypes are presented in Tables 3 and 4. In adolescents,\nthe atypical class had the highest proportion of female\nparticipants, and between-class differences were statistically\nsignificant. No other difference in demographic variables was\nobserved. The number of symptoms was significantly higher in\nthe severe typical class compared with the other two classes, but\nsymptom severity was highest in the atypical class and\nsignificantly higher than in the moderate typical class. The\nproportions of adolescents with a positive family history of\ndepression were significantly different between the adolescent\nclasses, with both the severe typical and atypical classes having a\nhigher proportion of young people with a positive family history\nrelative to the moderate class.\nAgoraphobia was differentially distributed across classes, with\nthe severe typical class having double the prevalence rate of\nagoraphobia compared with the other two classes. Further, rates\nof any binge eating disorder were highest in the atypical class\nand lowest in the moderate class. No difference in treatment\nwas observed across adolescent classes. In terms of health\nindicators, no difference in disability was found, but the atypical\nclass had the highest BMI, and this was significantly higher than\nthe moderate typical class. The percentage of adolescents who\nwere overweight or obese (based on BMI z-score, 485th\npercentile) was also highest in the atypical group (45.6% v.\nAdults\nIn the adult sample, the proportion of women increased with\nincreasing severity of classes. The highest proportion of women\nwas found in the atypical class, and this proportion was\nsignificantly higher relative to all other classes. There were\nsignificant differences between classes in the number of symptoms\npresent, with the severe typical class having the highest mean\nnumber of symptoms, followed by the atypical class. Severity\nscores for depression were also higher in the severe typical and\natypical classes. Differences in number of episodes between classes\nwere found, with the moderate typical class having the fewest\nepisodes. This class further had the highest percentage of adults\nwith early disorder onset (512 years of age), whereas the\nmoderate class had the lowest percentage of adults with early\nonset. No difference was found in family history of depression,\nbut the severe typical class more frequently had a family history\nof mania than the moderate class.\nTable 2 Fit indices from the latent class analyses\nEntropy\nAdolescents\nAdults\nBIC, Bayesian information criterion; BICssa\n, sample size-adjusted BIC.\nLamers et al\nWith respect to comorbid disorders, there was a significant\ndifference between classes in mania, with the highest rates\nobserved in the atypical class. Hypomania was significantly\ndifferent across adult classes, with the highest rate in the severe\ntypical class and the lowest in the atypical class. Social phobia,\nagoraphobia and specific phobia were all significantly different\nacross latent classes; highest prevalence rates for these disorders\nwere observed in the severe typical class. Those in the atypical class\nwere most likely to have received any healthcare, and those in the\nsevere typical class were most likely to have received any mental\nhealthcare in the previous year.\nBody mass index significantly differed across adult classes,\nwith the atypical class having a significantly higher BMI than all\nother classes and also having the highest percentage of people with\nsubtypes). The WHO-DAS health functioning scale further\nshowed highest disability in the severe typical class.

In both samples the proportion of female\nparticipants was highest in the atypical class and was similar\nacross samples (P = 0.88). In both samples the number of\nsymptoms was highest in the severe typical class and the symptom\nseverity score was highest in the atypical class. Comparisons of\nsimilar classes between adolescents and adults revealed no\nsignificant difference in number of symptoms and symptom\nseverity between classes (data not shown). In both samples, BMI\nwas highest in the atypical class, and there was no observed\ndifference in chronic conditions. There were, however, several\ndifferences in correlates between the adolescent and adult samples:\ndifferences in number of episodes, age at onset and treatment\nbetween classes were observed only in the adult sample.\nDiscussion\nThis study provides novel information on the structure of\ndepression in nationally representative samples of US adolescents\nand adults. The subtypes identified in these analyses suggest that\nboth symptom patterns and severity of depressive symptoms are\nsources of heterogeneity in major depressive disorder. The central\nimportance of symptoms that are somatic in quality (such as\nchanges in appetite, weight, sleep and fatigue) in discriminating\ndepressive subtypes has major implications for our understanding\nof the biologic pathways, treatment and opportunities for\nprevention of the consequences of this major public health\nproblem in American youth. As in previous work,8,11,13 our results\nindicate that the structure of depression is largely similar across\nadolescent and adult age groups. Among adolescents, three\ndistinct subtypes of depression were derived: one defined by a\ntypical symptom presentation and moderate severity (moderate\ntypical), one characterised by a typical symptom presentation\nand high severity (severe typical) and a third marked by an\nTable 3 Sociodemographic and clinical correlates and health indicators of depressive subtypes in adolescents (values in\nparentheses are standard errors)\nModerate typical\nSevere typical\nAtypical\nP\nDemographics\nClinical characteristics\nTreatment (past year), %\nComorbid psychiatric disorders (past year), %\nFunctional and health indicators\nWHO-DAS functioning - \u00ad \u00ad\nChronic diseases, %\nMDD, major depressive disorder; QIDS, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology; WHO-DAS, World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule.\nLamers et al\natypical symptom pattern, including increased appetite, weight\ngain and fatigue (atypical). The structure of depression among\nadults displayed more heterogeneity, with four subtypes instead\nof the three found in adolescents. Two of the three subtypes in\nadolescents \u00ad severe typical and atypical \u00ad had symptom patterns\nidentical to those in adults. Although the more complex\npresentation of depression in adults could illustrate developmental\nchanges in depression parallel to those witnessed in the transition\nbetween childhood and adolescence,44 it could also be in part an\nartefact of the lack of a clear-cut distinction between the moderate\ntypical and moderate classes.\nSubtypes and correlates\nOur findings further confirm prior classification studies that have\ndemonstrated the importance of inclusion of a severity\ncomponent in subtyping depression in both adults and\nadolescents.14,20,21 Compared with moderate groups, the severe\ngroups were distinguished by a greater number of depressive\nsymptoms, number of depressive episodes, symptom severity,\ntreatment and role impairment in both adults and young people.\nEvidence for distinctions between subgroups by severity highlights\nthe importance of implementing a dimensional severity rating for\nimproving depression diagnosis. Aside from severity, the subtypes\nwere also distinguished by differential symptom profiles. The\ntypical subtype was the most prevalent subtype (approximately\n70%) in both adults and adolescents. Although we did not assess\nall melancholic symptoms, the severe typical subtype that we\nidentified was characterised by the core features of melancholia\nincluding more loss of appetite and weight loss, psychomotor\nchange and feelings of guilt (the latter being more pronounced\nTable 4 Sociodemographic and clinical correlates and health indicators of depressive subtypes in adults (values in parentheses\nare standard errors)\nModerate\nModerate typical\nSevere typical\nAtypical\nP\nDemographics\nAge, years: %\nClinical characteristics\nTreatment (past years), %\nComorbid psychiatric disorders (past year), %\nFunctional and health indicators\nChronic diseases, %\nMDD, major depressive disorder; QIDS, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology; WHO-DAS, World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule.\ng.

Typical/melancholic subtypes have also\nbeen identified in several LCA studies in the USA and The\nThe atypical subtype, demonstrated in numerous clinical and\ncommunity samples of adults,12\u00ad23 has not previously been\nexamined in community studies of adolescents.45,46 The\nprevalence of the atypical subtype in adults with depression\n(16%) was similar to that in one prior LCA study,20 but somewhat\nhigher than has been generally found in other studies. However,\nthe much higher prevalence of the subtype in adolescents with\ndepression (26%) was well within the range reported from clinical\nof the atypical subtype were similar to those found in previous\nresearch. The female preponderance, increased rates of bipolar\nspectrum and anxiety disorders in adults, and higher BMI scores\nAs demonstrated by previous studies,47,49 adolescents with this\nsubtype more often had any binge eating disorder compared with\nthose with the moderate type. This association is not surprising\ngiven the conceptual overlap between the two conditions. The\nearlier finding that the atypical subtype is associated with\nmetabolic syndrome \u00ad a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular\ndisease and diabetes \u00ad suggests the importance of the somatic\ncomponent in atypical depression.20 Therefore, the presentation\nof this subtype in adolescence provides an important target for\ndeveloping assessment and treatment strategies that address\npossible somatic and metabolic abnormalities as well.\nOverall, change in appetite was the most potent indicator that\nseemed to differentiate between subtypes. Interestingly, several\nprevious studies using factor analysis found an appetite/weight\nfactor, with positive factor loadings for increased appetite and\nweight, and negative loadings for decreased appetite and weight,\nsuggesting that variations in appetite and weight are defining\nfeatures of depression that may distinguish between affected\nindividuals.7,44 Indeed, the atypical subtype observed in both\nadolescents and adults was primarily defined by appetite and\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations that should be considered when\ninterpreting the results. First, the conditional branching inherent\nin the CIDI may have led to an underestimation of atypical\nsymptoms. Skip rules were used in the interview for questions\nassessing changes in appetite or weight, changes in sleep and\npsychomotor changes, so that if one symptom was present (for\nexample, decreased appetite), the question to assess its reverse\n(increased appetite) was not administered. Because some\nindividuals present with different symptoms in different episodes,\nor even present with both variants during the same episode, this\nstudy may have underestimated the true prevalence of atypical\ndepression. Nevertheless, our results are highly comparable to\nLCAs of data where skips were not used.20 Second, some variables,\nincluding number of episodes and family history, had substantial\nnumbers of missing values. Third, only DSM-IV criterion\nsymptoms were used in this study; other symptoms of depression\nthat might be present in adolescents, such as irritability, were not\nincluded. Fourth, although the DSM-IV definition of atypical\ndepression requires the presence of mood reactivity (in addition\nto two or more of the symptoms of weight gain or increased\nappetite, hypersomnia, leaden paralysis and interpersonal\nrejection sensitivity), it was not included in our LCA because no\ninformation on mood reactivity was available in NCS-A and\nNCS-R. The atypical subtype therefore does not strictly adhere\nto the DSM-IV criteria. However, the hierarchical DSM-IV\ndefinition of atypical depression has been debated in adults and\nadolescents.45,47 In addition, mood reactivity did not play an\nimportant part in distinguishing subtypes in one previous LCA\nImplications\nThese findings provide new insights into subtypes of depression in\nadolescents. With respect to nosology, when taken together with\nand treatment response of the atypical subtype,22,23,51 our findings\nsupport retention of the atypical specifier in the DSM-5. As shown\npreviously by Leventhal et al29 and others, these results also\ndemonstrate that specific subgroups of depression can be\ndistinguished in community samples of adolescents. These\nsubgroups appear similar to those identified in clinical samples\nof young people as well as both clinical and community samples\nof adults. Although these symptom profiles in adults and\nadolescents display substantial overlap, this does not provide\nevidence of continuity of profiles from adolescence to adulthood.\nSeveral studies of depression in both adults and adolescents have\ndemonstrated that the stability of subtypes and symptoms appears\nlow,9,11,52 and that a substantial proportion of young adults even\nmeet criteria for different subtypes simultaneously.53 Because\nsubtype stability may be essential to its clinical usefulness, future\nresearch is needed to evaluate the continuity and correlates of\nsubtypes over time. Increased understanding of the subtypes of\ndepression in adolescence may also enhance our ability to provide\ntimely and effective treatment, particularly because a substantial\nproportion of adolescents with depression do not respond to\nevidence-based treatment,54 and episode recurrence is\ncommon.55,56 Longitudinal research might also help to identify\nthe timing of changes across subtypes that could inform the\noptimal timing of intervention.\nFemke Lamers, PhD, Marcy Burstein, PhD, Jian-ping He, MSc, Genetic\nEpidemiology Research Branch, Intramural Research Program, National Institute of\nMental Health (NIMH), Bethesda, Maryland, USA; Shelli Avenevoli, PhD, Division of\nDevelopmental Translational Research, NIMH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA; Jules Angst,\nMD, Zu\n\u00a8 rich University Psychiatric Hospital, Zu\n\u00a8 rich, Switzerland; Kathleen R.\nMerikangas, PhD, Genetic Epidemiology Research Branch, Intramural Research\nProgram, NIMH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA\nCorrespondence: Dr Kathleen R.
