Among\nthese toxicants are the volatile organic compounds (VOCs),\na group of low molecular weight chemicals that have been\nlinked to cancer and other adverse health effects (Comstock\nVOCs are used as chemical intermediates, dry-cleaning\nchemicals, solvents, degreasers, paint components, and\nother industrial products. Some VOCs are present in\ncigarette smoke, gasoline, and automobile exhausts, and\nthey are also formed during the chlorination of drinking\nwater and certain combustion processes.\nVinyl chloride (VC) is a VOC used in the production of\npolyvinyl chloride (PVC). PVC is employed to manufacture\nplastic and vinyl products such as pipes, electrical wire and\ncable coatings, furniture and automobile upholstery, wall\ncoverings, packaging materials, housewares, and automotive\nparts (ATSDR, 1997). VC is a known human carcinogen\n(ATSDR, 1997). Long-term exposure to low levels of VC has\nbeen associated with liver tumors, including hepatic angio-\nin death (ATSDR, 1997). Sources of release of VC to the\nenvironment include the emissions and effluents from plastic\nindustries, the disposal of VC wastes in landfills, the\nincompletecombustionofPVC,andtobaccosmoke(ATSDR,\n1997). In general, inhalation is the most important route of\nexposuretoVC;ingestionofcontaminateddrinkingwaterand\nfood are other minor routes of exposure.\nEthylene oxide (EO) is another VOC that is used\nextensively as a chemical intermediate in the polymer\nindustry (e.g., in the production of ethylene glycol), as a\nfumigant, and for the sterilization of medical instruments\nand supplies. EO is also produced endogenously in humans\nat low nanograms per liter levels (Filser et al., 1992) as a\nmetabolic product of ethylene, a natural body constituent\nin cigarette smoke (Hoffmann and Hoffmann, 1997). EO is\n1.

Inhalation is the\nmost prominent route of EO exposure.\nEthylene dibromide (EDB), another VOC, formerly used\nas a fumigant, is currently used as a scavenger of lead\ncompounds in gasoline. The decreasing market of leaded\ngasoline in the U.S. has resulted in lower EDB usage, but\nthe disposal of EDB and resultant contamination of water\nsupplies remain an environmental concern. EDB is a known\nanimal carcinogen and a suspected human carcinogen\nto the skin and eyes, and EDB exposure may harm sperm\nand decrease fertility in humans (Alexeeff et al., 1990). The\nmost important route of exposure to EDB is ingestion\nof contaminated drinking water (Pignatello and Cohen,\nIt is important to monitor human exposure to VC, EO,\nand EDB because of the adverse health effects of these\nsurveillance of human exposure to VC, EO, and EDB\nrequires information on reference range values of these\ntoxicants in the general population. Reference range\nconcentrations are defined as concentrations of a chemical\nobtained from a reference population with only minimal or\nno known exposure to this chemical or its parent\nReference range values for VC, EO, and EDB are not\nknown. The purpose of our study was to determine the\nreference range concentrations for N-acetyl-S-(2-hydro-\nxyethyl)-L-cysteine (2-hydroxyethyl mercapturic acid,\nHEMA), a urinary metabolite of VC, EO, EDB, acrylonitrile\n(ACN), and other electrophilic compounds with a two-\ncarbon backbone (Van Bladeren et al., 1981; Linhart et al.,\nHEMA has been used as a biomarker of exposure to EO and\nother VOCs in animals (Gerin and Tardif, 1986; Gerin et al.,\n1994). We report here the levels of HEMA in a reference\nsample of the U.S. adult population, and the relationship of\nHEMA levels to tobacco smoke exposure.\nMaterials and methods\nThe urine samples analyzed for this study were a subset\nselected from those collected during the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).\nNHANES III, designed to examine a representative sample\nof the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population, was\nour study were selected to adequately represent persons 20\nrural residences. We used a cutoff of 100,000 inhabitants per\ncounty to distinguish between rural and urban areas. The\ndemographic characteristics of the participants in this study\nare summarized in Table 1. The study was approved by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Institutional\nReview Board.\nHEMA was measured using isotope-dilution high\nperformance liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure\nchemical ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-\nAPCI-MS/MS) (Barr and Ashley, 1998). Briefly, the\nmethod involves the use of a solid-phase extraction cleanup\nstep, followed by the analysis of HEMA by HPLC-APCI-\nMS/MS; with this method, specific fragment ions of HEMA\nand its deuterated internal standard analog are monitored for\nquantification and confirmation. The limit of detection\n(LOD) for HEMA in a 1-ml urine sample is 0.68 g/l.\nAll the NHANES III samples, including those used for\nthis study, were stored at \u00c0708C until the time of analysis.\nBefore analysis, samples were left to thaw overnight at 58C.\nAfter analysis, the samples were stored at \u00c0708C. No\nchemical degradation of HEMA was detected in the quality\ncontrol samples and standards used for this study under\nthese storage conditions.\nFor the participants in this study, blood benzene, styrene,\nand toluene concentrations were measured by isotope-\ndilution purge-and-trap high-resolution mass spectrometry\n(Ashley et al., 1992), and have been reported elsewhere\n(Ashley et al., 1994). Likewise, serum cotinine has been\nmeasured previously by isotope-dilution HPLC-APCI-MS/\nMS (Bernert et al., 1997) for these participants, and the data\nwere reported elsewhere (Pirkle et al., 1996).\nStatistical analyses of the data were performed using the\nStatistical Analysis System (SAS Institute, Cary, NC)\nsoftware. For univariate analysis, we calculated geometric\nmean values of HEMA by smoking status (based on serum\ncotinine levels, see below), gender, age, urban/rural\nresidence, and demographic group. The variance of the\nHEMA concentration (dependent variable) was analyzed as\na function of gender, age, urban/rural residence, blood\nbenzene levels, blood styrene levels, blood toluene levels,\nserum cotinine levels, and smoking status (independent\nTable 1. Demographic characteristics of the NHANES III participants\nSubset N Gender Age Residence Percentage (%)\nReference range concentrations of N-acetyl-S-(2-hydroxyethyl)-L-cysteine Calafat et al.\nvariables) by using a general linear model procedure (i.e.,\nPROC GLM). A P-value less than 0.05 was considered\nsignificant. HEMA levels less than the LOD were assigned\na concentration of half the LOD for the analyses before\ncorrections were made for creatinine concentrations.\nAlthough we report the results both as creatinine-\ncorrected and uncorrected HEMA concentrations, we will\nfocus our discussion of the statistical analyses on the\ncreatinine-corrected HEMA concentrations, because in\nstudies involving measurements of `spot' urine samples, it\nis generally helpful to adjust for urine dilution to allow for\ncomparison of urinary measurements. Creatinine measure-\nments are commonly used to `correct' for dilution. Because\nthe log-transformed HEMA concentrations were more\nnormally distributed, we used them in the univariate and\nregression analyses based on a linear regression model (i.e.,\nResults\nTables 2, 3, 4, and 5 report the results of the analyses for\nHEMA in urine samples from 412 adults living in the U.S.\nTables 2\u00b15 report the number of adults (N), the frequency of\ndetection, the geometric mean HEMA concentration, and\nthe HEMA concentrations at the 5th, 50th (median), and\n95th percentiles in micrograms per liter. Tables 2\u00b15 also\nreport the creatinine-corrected geometric mean HEMA\nconcentrations and the creatinine-corrected HEMA concen-\ntrations at each percentile in micrograms per gram of\ncreatinine (g/g creatinine). The creatinine-corrected\nHEMA concentrations are given only for those urine\nsamples with creatinine values greater than or equal to 30\nmg/dl. Those with values lower than 30 mg/dl are generally\nconsidered to be too dilute to provide results that can be\nvalidly interpreted (Lauwerys and Hoet, 1993). Table 2\nsummarizes the results of the analysis of HEMA for all 412\nsamples, and Table 3 shows the results of the analysis of\nHEMA for the eight demographic subsets of our reference\npopulation group. Table 4 summarizes the measurements of\nHEMA by gender, age, and urban/rural residence; and\nTable 5 shows the results of the analysis of HEMA by\nsmoking status. Serum cotinine concentrations were used to\ndistinguish between smokers (>10 g/l) and nonsmokers\nTable 2.

We assessed the influence\nof urban/rural residence, gender, and age on HEMA levels.\nThe creatinine-corrected geometric mean HEMA concen-\ntrations are higher, but not statistically higher, among\nindividuals residing in urban areas than among residents in\nrural areas (Table 4). Likewise, the creatinine-corrected\ngeometric mean HEMA concentrations were higher, but not\nstatistically higher, for persons !50 years old than for\npersons <50. Finally, the creatinine-corrected geometric\nmean concentration of HEMA in urine was statistically\nWe also assessed the effect of smoking on HEMA\nlevels and found that the creatinine-corrected geometric\nmean HEMA concentrations were significantly higher\n(Table 5). The median HEMA concentrations and creati-\nnine-corrected median HEMA concentrations were also\nsubstantially higher among smokers than among nonsmo-\nkers (Table 5).\nIt has been shown that smoking increases the blood levels\nof VOCs such as benzene, styrene, and toluene (Ashley et\nal., 1995). We conducted a linear regression analysis of the\ncorrelation between the concentration of HEMA and the\nblood concentrations of benzene, styrene, and toluene. In all\ncases, the analysis did not show any significant relationship\n(P > 0.05) between these VOCs and HEMA (data not\nshown).\nResults of multiple regression analyses of the relation-\nship between HEMA levels and age, gender, residence,\nsmoking status, and urinary creatinine levels are shown in\nTable 6. As expected, HEMA levels were higher in\nconcentrated urine than in diluted urine. Females had\nslightly higher levels than males. Persons living in urban\nareas had higher levels than persons residing in rural areas,\nand smokers had higher levels than nonsmokers. Age was\nnot a statistically significant predictor of HEMA levels.\nDiscussion\nReference range concentrations for environmental toxicants\nor their biomarkers provide information about the magni-\ntude of exposure to these toxicants in the general population\nTable 5.

In this study, we\nhave measured urinary concentrations of HEMA, a\nbiomarker for exposure to several hazardous VOCs\n(Vermeulen et al., 1989), to obtain information about\nbackground exposure to the HEMA parent compounds\namong a sample of the U.S. population. The detection of\nHEMA in about three-quarters of our reference population\nsuggests that the general population is frequently exposed to\none or more of the HEMA parent compounds. The high\nfrequency of HEMA detection also reflects the high\nsensitivity of our analytical method (Barr and Ashley,\n1998) and demonstrates its value for future studies assessing\nenvironmental exposure to HEMA parent compounds.\nThe fact, that the creatinine-corrected geometric mean\nHEMA concentrations were statistically higher among\nwomen than among men in our study population, suggests\nan association between HEMA levels and gender. This was\nan interesting finding since we did not expect exposure to\nthe toxicants that metabolize into HEMA to be gender-\ndependent in our reference population. The formation of\nmercapturic acids as a mechanism of detoxification for\nelectrophilic toxicants has been well characterized (Hinch-\nmechanisms of the observed differences between HEMA\nlevels among men and women remain unknown. We\nspeculate that these differences may be due to gender-\nrelated variations in the metabolism of HEMA.\nWe also analyzed HEMA levels by urban/rural residence\nbecause of the potential for increased exposure to HEMA\nparent compounds in industrialized or polluted urban areas.\nAlthough we observed higher creatinine-corrected geo-\nmetric mean HEMA concentrations in urban areas than in\nrural areas, these differences were not statistically signifi-\ncant in the bivariate analysis. Similarly, age-related\ndifferences in creatinine-corrected geometric mean HEMA\nconcentrations were not statistically significant.\nWe observed a strong association between smoking and\nelevated mean HEMA levels (Figure 1). The mean HEMA\nconcentrations were statistically higher among smokers than\namong nonsmokers regardless of the manner in which the\nanalyses of the data were performed (i.e., log-transformed\nvs. log-untransformed). Moreover, in each segment of our\nreference population grouped by either age, gender, or\nurban/rural residence, the highest concentrations of HEMA\nwere always found in smokers. The elevated mean HEMA\nlevel among smokers is most likely due to direct exposure to\ntobacco smoke, which is known to contain several HEMA\nparent compounds (e.g., VC, EO, ACN) (Hoffmann and\nstatus should be taken into consideration in future studies\ninvolving exposure to HEMA parent compounds from other\nsources.\nBecause smoking elevates the blood levels of the VOCs\nbenzene, toluene, and styrene (Ashley et al., 1995), and we\nhave shown that it also increases the levels of HEMA, we\nanalyzed the correlation between HEMA and VOCs\nconcentrations. Likewise, because smoking also increases\nthe levels of serum cotinine, we examined the correlation\nbetween HEMA and serum cotinine levels. Our findings,\nthat HEMA and tobacco-related VOC levels, and HEMA\nand serum cotinine levels did not correlate, suggest that\nalthough tobacco smoke is a common source for HEMA,\nVOCs, and cotinine, exposure to sources other than tobacco\nsmoke also contributes to the presence of HEMA in urine.\nAbout 6% of the nonsmokers (15 individuals) had\nHEMA concentrations that were above the mean for\nFigure 1. Distribution of HEMA levels in the urine of the reference\npopulation by smoking status.\nCalafat et al. Reference range concentrations of N-acetyl-S-(2-hydroxyethyl)-L-cysteine\nsmokers. We believe that these elevated HEMA levels may\nbe related to an acute exposure to any of the HEMA parent\ncompounds (e.g., PVC from a new automobile). Other\nexplanations, such as exposure to environmental tobacco\nsmoke (ETS), are also a possibility. However, when we\ncompared the serum cotinine values for these nonsmokers\nwith reported (Pirkle et al., 1996) serum cotinine values\nassociated with ETS exposure, we found a poor correlation\nbetween the two. Thus, we doubt that ETS exposure was a\nmain contributor to the elevated HEMA levels in this group\nof nonsmokers.
