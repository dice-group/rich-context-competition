    "abstract": "Abstract\nRecent research suggests human life history strategy (LHS) may be subsumed by multiple dimensions, including mating compe-\ntition and Super-K, rather than one. In this study, we test whether a two-dimensional structure best fit data from a predominantly\nurban sample of young adults ages 18\u00ad24. We also test whether latent life history dimensions are associated with environmental\nharshness and unpredictability as predicted by life history theory. Results provide evidence that a two-dimensional model best fit\nthe data. Furthermore, a moderate inverse residual correlation between mating competition and Super-K was found, consistent\nwith a life history trade-off. Our findings suggest that parental socioeconomic status may enhance investment in mating com-\npetition, that harshness might persist into young adulthood as an important correlate of LHS, and that unpredictability may not\nhave significant effects in young adulthood. These findings further support the contention that human LHS is multidimensional and\nenvironmental effects on LHS are more complex than previously suggested. The model presented provides a parsimonious\nexplanation of an array of human behaviors and traits and can be used to inform public health initiatives, particularly with respect\nto the potential impact of environmental interventions.\n",

Lai2\n Keywords\nlife history theory, human life history strategy, mating competition, mating effort, K-factor, psychosocial acceleration,\npsychometrics\nEvolutionary life history theory (LHT) originally explained\nbetween-species variation in maturational and reproductive\ntraits that define the life course, such as developmental tempo,\nreproductive timing, offspring number, body size, and long-\nevity (Stearns, 1976). During the past 30 years, LHT has been\nextended to explain variation within humans, first to observable\nbiological variables (e.g., pubertal timing) and later to psycho-\nsocial traits (Belsky, Steinberg, & Draper, 1991; Chisholm,\nand colleagues developed a psychometric approach to the study\nof human life history that is rooted in the notion that evolution\nby natural selection produced clusters of coadapted psychoso-\ncial traits that function as coherent reproductive strategies\nallocate resources between somatic (e.g., bodily maintenance)\nand reproductive effort and also between mating effort and\nparental/nepotistic effort are executed in coordinated fashion,\nproducing reproductively coherent phenotypes in terms of per-\nsonality, psychosocial characteristics, and outward behaviors.\nThe term fast life history strategy (LHS) has been used to\ndenote scores on traits and behaviors that cohere with early\nreproduction and mating effort, while slow LHS represents\nscores that cohere with somatic and parental effort.\n1 School of Human Services, College of Education, Criminal Justice, and Human\nServices, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA\n2 School of Education, College of Education, Criminal Justice, and Human\nServices, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA\n3 College of Education, Criminal Justice, and Human Services, Evaluation\nServices Center, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA\n4 Department of Population, Family, and Reproductive Health, The Johns\nHopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nGeorge B.

These findings suggest that on some level, a single\nsource might give rise to the covariation among a suite of life\nhistory indicators.\nDespite evidence of a K dimension and some consensus that\nthere is a fast\u00adslow life history continuum within humans (e.g.,\nrelating to developmental tempo; Belsky et al., 1991; Chisholm\net al., 1993); it is not clear that a single dimension subsumes the\nwider documented variation in human life history traits (Cop-\nping, Campbell, & Muncer, 2014a; Richardson, Sanning, et al.,\n2016). In particular, it is not clear that a single higher order K\ndimension subsumes mating competition (e.g., mating effort,\ndominance seeking, and risk-taking). According to LHT, the\nfinite nature of resources induces phenotypic trade-offs (see\nand parental effort occur at the expense of mating competition\n(Figueredo et al., 2006). This does not necessarily imply that\nthese aspects of human LHS reflect a single factor. Indeed,\nsome research indicates that although K-factors have subsumed\nneuroticism and health, altruism, conscientiousness, parental\ninvestment, and earning potential (Figueredo, Vasquez, Brum-\nbach, & Schneider, 2007), they have not also subsumed mating\neffort (Gladden, Figueredo, & Jacobs, 2009; Olderbak & Fig-\nerbak, Gladden, Wolf, and Figueredo (2014) also found that\nmating effort did not reflect four of five K-factors subsuming\nfive different measures of LHS (i.e., Super K-1, Arizona Life\nHistory Battery, Mini-K, and High-K Strategy Scale, but not\nSuper K-2).\nConsistent with the above, Hampson, Andrews, Barckley,\nGerrard, and Gibbons (2016) reported that a life history dimen-\nsion subsuming risky sex and substance use in Grade 10 was\nonly slightly and negatively related to a dimension that sub-\nsumed sociability, health, and mental health 1-year post high\nschool. Similar, Brumbach, Figueredo, and Ellis (2009) found\ntwo uncorrelated social deviance (impulsivity, substance use,\ndelinquency, and Machiavellianism) and slow LHS (health,\nresource accruing potential and sexual restrictedness) dimen-\nsions of young adult LHS. Importantly, however, sexual\nrestrictedness had only a small effect (b \u00bc .23) on sexual\nbehavior and the structural model also did not fit according\nto current standards (e.g., the comparative fit index [CFI] was\nobserved at .83, well below the standard threshold of .95; for\ndiscussion of fit indices, see model fit). This evidence of misfit\nis consistent with an omitted effect of social deviance on sexual\nbehavior; future research could test alternative models that\ninclude this specification. Richardson, Chen, et al. (2014) and\nRichardson, Chen, et al. (2016) reported similar evidence that a\nfactor subsuming delinquency, substance use, and number of\nsexual partners did not also subsume indicators of covitality.\nOther research has suggested that mating effort might be sub-\nsumed by latent variables named psychopathic and aggressive\nattitudes (Figueredo, Gladden, & Hohman, 2011) or perhaps\nthe Dark Triad (Jonason, Li, Webster, & Schmitt, 2009). Taken\ntogether, the findings reviewed suggest that human LHS is\nlikely multidimensional and mating competition might be\nunique from the K dimension that has subsumed aspects of\nsomatic and parental effort.\nStemming from the above, Richardson, Sanning, et al.\n(2016) recently tested the possibility that human LHS is two-\ndimensional using a nationally representative middle adulthood\nsample and a broad selection of life history indicators. The\nauthors found that indeed, two independent dimensions sub-\nsumed middle adult life history indicators--mating competi-\ntion and Super-K. Mating competition subsumed life history\nindicators such as risk-taking, aggression, substance use, num-\nber of sex partners, and disagreeableness, while Super-K sub-\nsumed indicators such as social contact/support, pair-bonding,\nhealth and positive affect, agreeableness, conscientiousness,\nopenness, extroversion, education, and emotional stability.\nThese findings suggest that LHS is not only multidimensional\nat the first-order level of traits such as conscientiousness (as\ndescribed in Figueredo et al., 2015), but also at higher order\nlevels. In other words, while there might be a within humans\nfast\u00adslow life history continuum, there may be no single LHS\ndimension that can be scored to capture life history speed.\nMore research is needed to confirm the two-dimensional\nstructure found by Richardson, Sanning, et al. (2016) and test\nwhether it extends to other developmental stages. This is cru-\ncial because LHT has been increasingly used in evolutionary\nstudies of human variation as well as applied areas of research\nand theory. As examples of the latter, LHT has recently been to\npsychopathology (e.g., Del Giudice, 2014a; Del Giudice &\nEllis, 2016), risk-taking propensity and externalizing behaviors\nson et al., 2014; Richardson, Castellano, Stone, & Sanning,\nand criminal justice (e.g., Boutwell, Nedelec, Lewis, Barnes, &\nBeaver, 2015). Many researchers who want to measure LHS\nare interested in the theory because of its potential to shed light\non the covariance among broad array of traits and behaviors.\nOne big payoff, from an applied perspective, is that if we can\nmap LHT onto human variation, the theory can be leveraged to\nelucidate how broad arrays of reproductively relevant traits and\nbehaviors relate to environment throughout development.\nTo achieve this payoff, we must first determine whether it is\nmore useful to model latent variables that underlie suites of life\nhistory indicators or to instead focus on the individual indica-\ntors. While latent variables have the potential to provide parsi-\nmony and simplify our view of human variation, they also have\nthe potential--particularly from a realist perspective--to\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nimpede scientific progress if they are not themselves good\nproxies for one or more real psychological mechanisms (for\nfurther discussion, see Richardson, Sanning, et al., 2016). We\nmust first address the following question to determine whether\nit is useful to model dimensions of LHS: How many dimen-\nsions are plausible? To answer this question, we must establish\nwhich higher order structure, if any, fits the life history indi-\ncator data. We must also test whether latent variables that are\nfound relate to environmental conditions as predicted by LHT,\nor in other words, assess the validity of latent LHS constructs\nthrough their linkage to external criteria.\nCurrent Study\nIn this study, we test whether the two-dimensional structure\ndocumented by Richardson, Sanning, et al. (2016) also fits\ndata from a predominantly urban sample of young adults\nages 18\u00ad24. We also test whether the two latent vari-\nables--mating competition and Super-K--are associated\nwith environmental harshness and unpredictability as pre-\ndicted by LHT. As described in Richardson, Sanning, et al.\n(2016), the utility of the psychometric approach to human\nLHS is largely a function of the ability of factors to explain\nthe dependence among life history indicators as well as their\nassociations with aspects of environment. This study\naddresses these issues directly to shed additional light on the\nutility of the psychometric approach. It also builds upon\nprior research (e.g., Richardson, Sanning, et al., 2016) by\nusing a more extensive selection of indicators of mating\ncompetition, environmental harshness, and environmental\nunpredictability, as well as more proximate measures of\nharshness and unpredictability. We used more proximate\nmeasures of harshness and unpredictability because most life\nhistory research has assumed that childhood conditions are\nmost robustly associated with LHS. Few studies, however,\nhave examined the magnitude of these associations later in\ndevelopment. Finally, this study follows Richardson, San-\nning, et al. (2016) by including multiple aspects of environ-\nment so as to estimate their relative importance.\nMethod\nData\nThis study received institutional review board approval (both\nat the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and\nthe University of Cincinnati). All participants provided\nwritten consent before participating.

Quota sam-\npling was used to balance the sample on age, biological sex,\nand race. Participants were sampled from an urban city with\nhigh sexually transmitted infection and HIV, drug use, and\ncrime prevalence, and also surrounding counties marked by\nfewer risk outcomes. Females were oversampled in an effort\nto offset attrition due to pregnancy.

Participants were recruited through local\nnewspaper and online social media advertisements, public\nflyers, and peer referrals (from enrolled participants). The\ndata supporting these analyses were collected at baseline of\na larger parent study.\nInstruments\nWe used LHT to select 11 indicators of young adult LHS and 3\nretrospective indicators of childhood and recent environmen-\ntal conditions. We selected a broad set of indicators that have\nbeen observed to reflect LHS in prior research (see Olderbak\net al., 2014, for a review) and also chose environmental com-\nponents that have been previously studied (for a review, see\nEllis, Figueredo, Brumbach, & Schlomer, 2009). Based on the\nliterature to date, we note the hypothesized valence of each\nLHS indicator loading on mating competition and Super-K in\nTable 2. We used numerous standardized and validated scales\nto measure most of our LHS indicators. A full list of the items\nand scales used is presented in Table 3 along with their cor-\nresponding construct labels, item contents, response options,\nand citations to validation studies. Detailed information about\nthe items used to construct the environmental components is\ndisplayed in Table 4.\nBelow we describe all indicators used to measure young\nadult LHS and index environmental conditions. Because this\nstudy used established indicators of LHS, we do not provide\na detailed theoretical rationale for the inclusion of each one\nin this report. Instead, we provide citations to reviews of life\nhistory measures or other publications in which the use of\neach indicator is substantiated. We also do not present psy-\nchometrics associated with each indicator in this section.\nBecause our sample size was fairly small relative to the\nnumber of parameters we planned to estimate (i.e., less than\nthe minimum 10:1 ratio often recommended for structural\nequation modeling [SEM] studies; Bentler & Chou, 1987),\nwe assessed items for unidimensionality and computed\nscores for use in our structural models. These procedures are\ndescribed in Analyses section, and the psychometric proper-\nties of our indicators are presented in Results section and in\nIndicators of young adult LHS\nSuper-K.

SES is traditionally\nindexed by forming a composite of indicators such as parental\nincome, educational attainment, and occupational status\n(National Center for Education Statistics, 2012). In this study,\nwe indexed parental SES using the highest degree earned by\nparticipants' mothers and fathers (ranging from ``less than high\nschool'' to ``doctoral'') and an item assessing whether or not\nparticipants were eligible for or recipients of free or reduced\ncost lunch as minors. Below we describe how we constructed\ncomposite SES.\nAnalyses\nWe used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to assess the valu-\ning of children, delinquency, harm avoidance, liability to sub-\nstance use, and agreeableness items for unidimensionality and\ncompute scores for use in our structural models. We also scored\nseveral standardized scales (for scale descriptions and citations,\nsee Table 2). For our EFA analyses, we used MPlus 7.11 and\nthe robust weighted least squares (WLSMV) estimator, delta\nparameterization, and oblique rotations (Geomin). We used the\nWLSMV because we included categorical and ordinal Likert-\ntype items. Following convention, we conducted all signifi-\ncance tests at the p < .05 level. Finally, we used principle\ncomponents analysis (PCA) to form composite harshness and\nparent SES and summed over the unpredictability items to\ncompute total unpredictability.\nThis study used SEM to test the structure of young adult life\nhistory indicators, along with the extent to which latent LHS\nvariables explained associations between these indicators and\naspects of environment. For our SEM analyses, we also used\nMPlus 7.11 and the WLSMV estimator because we needed to\ntreat number of sex partners as ordinal. We considered treating\nthis variable as a count but decided to treat it as ordinal because\nour models assumed a linear effect of mating competition on\nTable 3.

We termed the factors ``pur-\npose,'' ``burden,'' and ``community standing'' (for item con-\ntents, see Table 2). Loadings ranged from b \u00bc .33 to .89 in\nmagnitude across the factors (for all loadings, see Table 2) and\nhigher scores implied lesser perceived purpose, lesser per-\nceived burden, and lesser perception that children are critical\nTable 4.

We then saved\nscores on the three factors and applied PCA to them in order to\nconstruct composite valuing of children. A single component\nsolution emerged and explained 62% of the variance in the\nthree facets. Their loadings were observed at \u00c0.68, .90, and\n.78, respectively. Higher scores on the composite, therefore,\nimplied greater perceived purpose, lesser sense of burden, and\nlesser perception that children are critical to acceptance or\nstanding in the community (i.e., greater valuing of children).\nBecause we observed very low base rates on the delin-\nitems), we bucketed participants into ``no instances of the beha-\nvior'' and ``one or more instances of the behavior'' and then\nconducted our EFA. We dropped 2 items because only 1 person\nendorsed the first (delinquency last 12 months: breaking in) and\nonly 2 endorsed the second (delinquency last 12 months: use\nweapon). A single-factor model fits the data reasonably well\n(see Table 5). Loadings ranged from b \u00bc .49 to .98, and we\nsaved scores on latent delinquency for our SEM. Next, we fac-\ntored the harm avoidance items and found that a two-factor\nsolution best fit the data. We termed the first factor ``confi-\ndence'' and retained the label, ``harm avoidance,'' for the sec-\nond. Loadings ranged from b \u00bc .54 to .94 across the factors, with\nhigher scores implying greater confidence and harm avoidance.\nWe saved scores on harm avoidance for our SEM. We did not\ninclude confidence because as far as we know, this construct has\nnot been theoretically or empirically linked to LHS. Moreover,\ndue to sample size limitations, we were limited in the number of\nvariables we could include in the model.\nWe fit a second-order factor model to the liability to sub-\nstance use items. These items were counts and we recoded\nthem into ordinal variables3 for the same reasons as the number\nof sexual partners. This was also acceptable in this specific case\nbecause across the items, more than 70% of participants\nendorsed the first four counts and many of the higher counts\nwere endorsed by only one participant. Moreover, 1 item was\nbimodal (30/day tobacco) and another exceeded the maximum\nfor counts in MPlus (tobacco/week). In the model, daily,\nweekly, and past month alcohol use loaded on a first-order\nalcohol use factor. Similarly, daily, weekly, and past month\nnicotine use loaded on a first-order nicotine use factor. These\ntwo first-order factors and also the breadth in illicit substance\nuse and past cannabis use items were then loaded onto second-\norder liability to substance use. Second-order factor loadings\nranged from b \u00bc .67 to .77. We applied EFA to the agreeable-\nness items and a single-factor model had an excellent fit to the\ndata. Loadings ranged from b \u00bc .49 to .77. As mentioned\npreviously, the other life history domains were measured with\nscale scores or single items (for more information, see Table 2).\nFor the environmental components, we first applied PCA to\nenvironmental harshness, imposing a single component solu-\ntion on the data, and found that it explained 38% of the variance\nin the items. We then used PCA to analyze the parent SES\nitems and found that a single component explained 68% of the\nvariance. Finally, we summed over the unpredictability items\nto compute total (composite) unpredictability because sources\nof unpredictability may not be systematically related.\nHypothesized Model I: Dimensionality of LHS\nWe tested the hypothesized two-factor model and it fit the data\nRMSEA \u00bc .00. We set the metrics for the two factors by fixing\nthe health loading on Super-K and the sensation seeking load-\ning on mating competition to one. The effects of Super-K on its\nindicators were all statistically significant (ps < .05) except for\nthe effect on liability to substance use (p \u00bc .070). Given that\nmarginal p value for this loading, we constrained it to 0 to test\nthe hypothesis that it was nil. We found that with this constraint\nimposed, model fit was significantly worse, Dw2 \u00bc 4.45 [1],\np \u00bc .035. Thus, we proceeded by retaining and interpreting this\nloading along with the others. All significant effects of Super-K\nwere larger than b (standardized) \u00bc .50 except for the effects\non valuing of children (b \u00bc .27) and liability to substance use\nTable 5.

All significant effects of mating compe-\ntition were larger than b \u00bc .50. The correlation between Super-\nK and mating competition was observed at r \u00bc \u00c0.55 (p < .001).\nFor the liability to substance use and harm avoidance indica-\ntors, which cross-loaded on Super-K and mating competition,\nthe R2 estimates were .43 and .20, respectively. Finally, we\ntested a single-factor model of life history indicators and\nhypothesized Model I as the best reproducer of the associa-\ntions among the indicators.\nHypothesized Model II: Associations With Environment\nWe next incorporated environmental variables into our final\nmeasurement model (Model I) and found that the result fit the\nRMSEA \u00bc .04. The effects of Super-K and mating competition\non their indicators mirrored those observed for Model I (see\nTable 6 and Figure 1). Consistent with Model I, the correlation\nbetween the residuals of the two life history dimension was\nobserved at r \u00bc \u00c0.43 (p < .001). Parent SES had a moderate\npositive effect on mating competition (b \u00bc .31, p < .01) and no\nsignificant effect on Super-K. Harshness had a moderate pos-\nitive effect (b \u00bc .46, p < .001) on mating competition and a\nlarge negative effect on Super-K (b \u00bc \u00c0.56, p < .001). Unpre-\ndictability had no significant effect on the life history dimen-\nsions, although its effect on mating competition neared\nsignificance (b \u00bc .18, p \u00bc .09). A moderate positive correlation\nwas observed between harshness and unpredictability (r \u00bc .45,\np < .001), while a moderate negative correlation was observed\nbetween parent SES and harshness (r \u00bc \u00c0.34, p < .001). Parent\nSES and unpredictability were uncorrelated (p \u00bc .66) condi-\ntional on harshness.\nNo relatively large modification indices (MIs) were\nobserved (all MIs < 5) for Model II suggesting that no areas\nof strain existed. Given this and the other observed fit infor-\nmation, we concluded that no covariances between our life\nhistory indicators or between our environmental components\nand the indicators had likely been omitted. This implied that the\nassumptions of local independence of the life history indicators\nconditional on mating competition and Super-K held. In addi-\ntion, the assumption of local homogeneity held given the\nabsence of paths from the environmental components to the\nindicators and the nonsignificant w2 and other fit information\n(i.e., the latent LHS variables provided all the relevant infor-\nmation about their indicators). The first finding is consistent\nwith the notion that the life history indicators share two under-\nlying common causes. The latter is consistent with the notion\nTable 6. Final SEM Unstandardized and Standardized Effects.\nVariable b SE p* b\nNote. For loadings used to set the metric of factors, we used the tests of standardized effect significance. SEM \u00bc structural equation modeling.\nRichardson et al. 9\nthat the life history dimensions mediated or otherwise\nexplained any associations between environmental harshness,\nunpredictability, parent SES, and the life history indicators.\nDiscussion\nOverview of Findings\nUsing SEM, this study tested the hypothesis that two dimen-\nsions subsumed life history indicators in a predominantly urban\nsample of young adults. We reproduced the two-dimensional\nstructure suggested by Richardson et al. (2014) and documen-\nted by Richardson, Sanning, et al. (2016). The two dimen-\nsions--mating competition and Super-K--fully explained\nany associations among the life history indicators as well as\ntheir associations with environmental conditions. These find-\nings suggest that mating competition and Super-K may func-\ntion as underlying common causes that explain the covariance\namong a broad swath of life history parameters (e.g., number of\nsexual partners), psychosocial traits (e.g., sensation seeking\nand agreeableness), and behaviors (e.g., delinquency). Thus,\nit may be useful for evolutionary scientists, including those\ninterested in informing public health efforts, to focus on the\nrelationships between aspects of environment and these under-\nlying factors. This kind of research may produce a more parsi-\nmonious picture of the linkage between environment and\nvariation in human traits and behaviors, one that could inform\nthe development of public policy initiatives that produce broad\nreturns in terms of physical and mental health, risky behavior,\nand education. For instance, this work could shed new light on\nthe etiology of comorbidity and inform efforts to prevent men-\ntal disorders. Our model and the one reported by Richardson,\nSanning, et al. (2016) both suggest that holding harshness con-\nstant, higher parental SES has a positive mating competition\nmediated effect on risky behavior, but no effect on health or\ndepression. Thus, it is possible that interventions that increase\nSES, but do not decrease harshness as a consequence, will\nincrease risky behavior. Similar, interventions that decrease\nharshness but do not increase SES, if they are possible, would\nbe expected to reduce internalizing symptoms without increas-\ning risky behavior as a byproduct.\nDimensionality of Life History Indicators\nWe found that all indicators of mating competition functioned\nas theorized, with the exception of agreeableness. Those who\nscored higher on mating competition endorsed greater sensa-\ntion seeking, less negative attitudes toward risk, greater respon-\nsivity to reward, less harm avoidance, more delinquent\nbehavior, greater substance use, and larger numbers of sexual\npartners. There was a significant positive effect on agreeable-\nness. This should be interpreted as an effect within levels of\nSuper-K, or for those with the same scores on Super-K. Indeed,\nwhen Super-K and its unique indicators are removed from the\nmodel, the mating competition effect on agreeableness is no\nFigure 1. Final full structural equation modeling: life history dimensions and their associations with aspects of environment.\n10 Evolutionary Psychology\nlonger significant. Still, we expected significant negative effect\non agreeableness on the basis of theory and past research (e.g.,\nRichardson, Sanning, et al., 2016). Therefore, the current find-\ning is surprising.\nFor Super-K, all indicators except harm avoidance reflected\ntheir factors as theorized. Also, the effect on substance use,\nalthough in the expected direction, was small. Those high on\nSuper-K endorsed better health and fewer symptoms of depres-\nsion, greater agreeableness, and greater valuing of children. To\nour knowledge, this is the first evidence that Super-K is asso-\nciated with greater attribution of value to offspring prior to\nparenthood. Interestingly, higher levels on Super-K implied\nless harm avoidance. Perhaps this is due to the items used to\nmeasure harm avoidance. The content of the Character and\nTrait Inventory items in this subscale seem to tap into intoler-\nance of ambiguity, discomfort in response to uncertainty, and/\nor anxiety (e.g., ``I often feel tense and worried in unfamiliar\nsituations, even when others feel there is little to worry about,''\nand ``It is extremely difficult for me to adjust to changes in my\nusual way of doing things because I get so tense''). Given that\nSuper-K has reflected lesser environmental harshness and also\nsubsumed social connectedness and support (Richardson,\nSanning, et al., 2016), perhaps it should not be surprising\nthat participants scoring highly on this factor feel less tense\nwhen faced with unfamiliar situations. Their external social\nenvironments have been relatively safe and thus they may\nfeel secure in new situations. In contrast, the negative harm\navoidance loading on mating competition might be attribu-\ntable to low levels of sensitivity to threat. Consistent with\nthis, we found that mating competition subsumed aspects of\nreward sensitivity (e.g., reward dependence), and reward\nand threat sensitivity have been inversely related in past\nresearch (Richardson, Freedlander, Katz, Dai, & Chen,\n2014). That is, those with high levels of mating competition\nmay not find new situations unnerving because of internal\ncharacteristics that bias their attention toward cues to\nreward and away from cues to threat. This may enable them\nto better find and acquire new mates. Future work should\nconfirm which forms of harm avoidance reflect mating com-\npetition and Super-K.\nIn combination with previous research, this study helps to\ncharacterize the dimensionality of life history indicators. LHS\ndoes not appear to be unidimensional--a single-factor model\ndid not fit our data nor those examined in Richardson,\nSanning, et al. (2016). Instead, there appear to be at least two\nunique factors--mating competition and Super-K. These find-\nings are also consistent with the Brumbach et al.'s (2009)\nfinding of two uncorrelated dimensions in young adulthood.\nGiven that the two dimensions were independent or uncorre-\nlated in other studies, and moderately correlated here, we\ncontend that they should not be aggregated and interpreted\nas life history speed. Each unique dimension of LHS seems to\nrequire attention. Finally, although other studies suggest there\nmay not be a direct trade-off between the two LHS dimen-\nsions, as LHT would have us believe, this study detected a\nmoderate negative residual correlation that is consistent with\na direct phenotypic trade-off. More research is needed to\nidentify the conditions under which mating competition and\nSuper-K are inversely related.\nCombining the findings reported here and in Richardson,\nSanning, et al. (2016), we conclude that although the nature\nof the trade-off between the two LHS dimensions is not yet\nresolved, it seems that mating competition clearly manifests as\nsensation seeking, risk-taking, and behaviors that can enhance\nfitness in the short term but are costly in the long term. Con-\nsistent with LHT, mating competition also manifests as greater\nnumbers of sexual partners, which would have likely led to\ngreater quantities of offspring prior to the advent of modern\nbirth control and the demographic transition (for related dis-\ncussions of fertility and the demographic transition, see Sear,\nclearly manifests as facets of connectedness to peers, intimate\npartners, and offspring, as well as covitality. These findings\nsuggest the human life history continuum is composed of\nunique mating competition and Super K dimensions that sub-\nsume mating effort and somatic and parental effort, respec-\ntively. We note that these findings should not be seen as\nlimiting human life history to two dimensions of investment.\nMuch more work is needed to determine how many dimensions\nare plausible and also whether trade-offs between them are\noccurring as suggested by LHT.\nAssociations With Environment\nOur LHS dimensions explained the associations between life\nhistory indicators and aspects of environment. Greater harsh-\nness predicted higher levels of mating competition and lower\nlevels of Super-K, unpredictability did not have significant\neffects on either dimension, and parental SES had a moderate\npositive effect on mating competition. Richardson, Sanning,\net al. (2016) documented similar environmental effects in\nmiddle adulthood, except they detected an effect of unpredict-\nability on Super-K. This study used more proximate (past\n12-month) measures of environmental harshness and unpre-\ndictability than past studies. The effects of harshness were\nlarger than observed in past research, consistent either greater\nimportance of proximate cues to harshness and/or an emer-\nging gene\u00adenvironment correlation. The effects of unpredict-\nability were nonsignificant. This could be because later\nunpredictability is not as important as early unpredictability,\nconsistent with psychosocial acceleration theory (e.g., Belsky\ncould also be partly due to the fact that some of our young\nadults were no longer living with their parents (about 38%)\nand some of the unpredictability items tapped aspects of par-\nental experiences or behavior.\nWe also found a parental SES effect on mating competi-\ntion similar to that reported in Richardson, Sanning, et al.\n(2016), consistent with gene\u00adenvironment correlation and/\nor a reliable influence of access to resources on life history\ndimensions. It is important to note that some past research\n(e.g., Simpson et al., 2012) used SES as the only index of\nRichardson et al. 11\nharshness. Our findings suggest that the SES effect on mating\ncompetition (or its indicators) may be more likely to emerge\nwhen more direct cues to extrinsic mortality (e.g., seeing\nsomeone shot) are controlled, while the association between\nSES and Super-K may be attributable to experienced harsh-\nness. This implies that relying on SES as the sole index of\nharshness is likely inadequate. Thus we suggest that in the\nfuture, researchers control for SES and also more direct indi-\ncators of environmental harshness. This may allow them to\nbetter disentangle the effects of SES and access to resources\nfrom the effects of cues to mortality risk.\nOverall, these findings are consistent with LHT. Harshness\nhad the expected effects on the two LHS dimensions and was\nassociated with faster LHS overall. Unpredictability did not\npredict the LHS factors but this may be due to a restriction\nof its effects to childhood. Parental SES had what might be\nseen as a surprising effect on mating competition, but this\neffect was also found by Richardson, Sanning, et al. (2016)\nand is consistent with evidence of elevated risk-taking in sam-\nples of affluent youth (Luthar & Barkin, 2012). It is also con-\nsistent with evidence that greater access to resources is\nassociated with higher levels on r and also K strategies between\ngreater access to resources, organisms can increase their play\nin all reproductive games. In the case of within-human varia-\ntion, it seems that higher SES may be directly related to greater\nmating competition and also indirectly related to higher Super-\nK through decreased experience of cues to harshness (e.g.,\nseeing someone shot).\nLimitations\nThis study is limited by the use of self-report data, and it is\nwidely recognized that such data can be affected by error in\nthe retrieval processes associated with memory and self-\npresentation bias. This limitation applies most significantly\nto the retrospective measure of SES. However, the measure\nwe used is the standard in the field and this limitation should\nalso apply less young adults compared with middle adults\ngiven the smaller time lag since childhood. Second, causal\ninferences based on the results presented here should remain\ntentative given that past studies have shown that the influence\nof genetic factors is ubiquitous (Turkheimer, 2000). Future\nresearch can use genetic information to address this limita-\ntion. Finally, we used environmental measures and several\nlife history indicators (e.g., number of sexual partners and\nvaluing of children) that can be seen as helpful in establishing\nthe validity of our latent constructs. Future studies should test\nwhether mating competition and Super-K are related to addi-\ntional criteria such as pubertal timing, first birth, parental\ninvestment, and longevity. For mating competition, specifi-\ncally, effects on indicators such as mate poaching, intrasexual\ncompetitiveness, attitudes toward partner infidelity, and per-\nceptions of infidelity risk should also be tested. Future stud-\nies should also examine the stability of mating competition\nand Super-K over time.\nStrengths/Contributions\nOne major contribution of this study is the heterogeneous sam-\nple of youth, representing many demographic characteristics\n(e.g., parental SES, current educational attainment, age, race,\nand ethnicity). The data set is rich in variables and constructs to\nsupport analyses like these. This study reproduced the two-\ndimensional structure of LHS indicators documented by\nRichardson, Sanning, et al. (2016) in this unique and hetero-\ngeneous sample of young adults. It also helped to better estab-\nlish the identity of the mating competition factor using a more\nextensive selection of indicators as well as more extensive and\nproximate measures of environmental harshness and unpredict-\nability. The latter casts light on the possible role of environ-\nment in LHS development. Finally, our inclusion of multiple\naspects of environment allowed us to produce a nuanced view\nof their associations with young adult LHS.\nConclusion\nTaken together, our results reinforce the Richardson, Sanning,\net al.'s (2016) finding that human LHS at least two-\ndimensional. In this study, a moderate inverse residual correla-\ntion was observed between mating competition and Super-K,\nconsistent with a direct trade-off between these two dimensions\nof LHS. Moreover, we have shown that SES may enhance\ninvestment in mating competition, that harshness might persist\ninto young adulthood as an important correlate of LHS, and\nthat unpredictability may not have significant effects in young\nadulthood. These findings reinforce the contention that human\nLHS is multidimensional and environmental effects on LHS\nare more complex than previously suggested. They also pro-\nvide a parsimonious model of an array of human behaviors and\ntraits that can be used to inform public health initiatives, par-\nticularly with respect to the potential impact of environmental\ninterventions that target harshness versus SES.\nAuthors' Note\nThe opinions and conclusions expressed are solely the authors and\nshould not be construed as representing the opinions of NIH or any\nagency of the Federal Government.\n"
