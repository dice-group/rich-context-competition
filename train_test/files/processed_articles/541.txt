Genetic risks\nmanifest early in life; children at higher genetic risk gain weight\nmore rapidly during infancy and early childhood and reach\nadiposity rebound earlier in life and at higher body-mass-index\n(BMI) [2\u00ad4]. In turn, this rapid growth early in life functions as a\nmediator of genetic risk for adult obesity [4]. These observations\nsuggest the possibility that genetic information can inform research\nto understand pathogenesis of obesity in childhood, with the goal\nof improving prevention and treatment [5,6].\nSingle-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovered in GWAS\nof obesity phenotypes have small effects; the most penetrant SNP\npredicts an increase of less than one half of one BMI point in adult\nsamples [7]. As a result, many samples designed to investigate\nobesity etiology are underpowered to study individual GWAS\ndiscoveries. Combining information on multiple GWAS discov-\nered SNPs to compute a ``genetic risk score'' can provide a tool for\ninvestigating genetic contributions to obesity etiology in samples\nfar smaller than are needed for GWAS [8,9].\nTo date, most genetic risk score research on obesity has focused\non European-descent samples [2\u00ad4,10,11]. Expanding the scope of\ngenetic research to consider other populations is a public health\npriority [12]. A challenge is that GWAS-discovered SNPs may not\ncause disease themselves, but may instead serve as proxy measures\nof causal variants elsewhere in the DNA sequence. Allele\nfrequencies and patterns of linkage disequilibrium vary across\nracial and ethnic groups [13]. One implication of these differences\nis that a SNP measured in a GWAS may serve as a proxy for a\ngiven causal variant in the GWAS discovery population, but not in\na new sample drawn from a different ethnic group. This problem\nis compounded when GWAS discoveries are followed up in\nexisting databases that may not contain the original GWAS-\ndiscovered SNP and proxies must be selected [14].\nAn increasing number of large and representative samples of\nadults from diverse populations are available with genome wide\ndata from respondents. Genetic risk scores are a promising tool for\npopulation health research using such datasets but relatively small\ndifferences in allele frequency and LD patterns across groups may\ncomplicate the interpretation of genetic risk associations [15,16]. A\nnecessary first step is to test scores in different ethnic populations\nand establish whether a genetic risk score based on discoveries\nmade in one population will translate to another.\nThis study tests transethnic replication of a genetic risk score for\nobesity in white and black young adults in the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) Sibling\nPairs Study. We tested genetic associations with obesity at two\nold, respectively). We next tested genetic associations with change\nin obesity over the 7-year interval between waves. We conducted\ntests separately in the white and black samples and then tested for\ndifferences in genetic associations between the two groups. We also\ncompared the performance of the GRSs computed from SNPs\nidentified in samples of European ancestry to additional GRSs that\nincorporate SNPs discovered in a recent GWAS of African\nAmericans.\nMaterials and Methods\nSample\nAdd Health is a nationally representative cohort (n = 20,745,\nsample of 80 US high schools and 52 US middle schools,\nrepresentative of US schools in 1994\u00ad95 with respect to region,\nurban setting, school size, school type and race or ethnic\ncollection originally contained n = 15,197 individuals (then aged\npairs, 30 sibling trios, 2 sibling quads, and 369 singletons) who\nwere genotyped from samples collected during Wave 4 of the Add\nHealth study (this phase of the Add Health study genotyped only\nthe Sibling Pairs). The Sibling Pairs cohort oversampled black\nrespondents (42.1% of Sibling Pairs as compared to 28.4% of all\nAdd Health are black). The Sibling Pairs cohort did not differ from\nthe full Add Health sample in terms of gender, age, maternal\neducation, or health of the respondents (detailed results available\nupon request). The Siblings Pairs cohort was roughly 0.25 BMI\nunits above the full Add Health sample at both Waves 3 and 4 but\nthe waist to height ratios were identical in both groups. Missing\ndata for phenotypic information reduced the number of respon-\ndents that could be used in the below analyses. The exact\nreduction in sample varied by phenotype, but the minimum white\nsample used in analysis was 773 respondents and the minimum\nGenetic Risk Score\nGenotyping was conducted with the Illumina HumanOmni1-\nQuad v1 platform using DNA extracted (via Oragene saliva\ncollection) from 1,946 individuals at Wave 4. After quality controls\n(see http://ibs.colorado.edu/jb/pairsgwasqc.pdf), the genetic da-\nnucleotide polymorphisms. Our analysis focused on non-Hispanic\nwhite and black individuals as indicated by self-report (n = 1,303)\nand SNPs with missing call rates below 5% (this criteria resulted in\nSNPs). Principal components, which are commonly used to adjust\nfor population stratification in GWAS [13], were computed with\n231, 649 SNPs (selected from the full set of SNPs to be in linkage\nequilibria) from chromosomes 1\u00ad22.\nWe constructed three multi-locus indicators of genetic risk for\nobesity. The genetic risk score for European-descent populations\n(GRS-E) included 31 SNPs discovered in GWAS of adult BMI in\nEuropean-descent individuals [7] (this risk score is available\nthrough the restricted use mechanism of Add Health). The genetic\nrisk score for African-Americans (GRS-A) included 8 SNPs\ndiscovered in GWAS of adult BMI in African American and\nAfrican individuals [18]. Genetic risk scores were created from sets\nof SNPs identified as genome-wide significant in their respective\nstudies. We constructed a third genetic risk score (GRS-Omni)\nfrom the complete set of loci discovered in either GWAS. For loci\nin or near the genes FTO, SEC16B, and GNPDA2, the two GWAS\nidentified loci in high linkage disequilibrium (r.0.9) and a single\ntag SNP was selected. The method used to compute the risk scores\nwas the same for each set of SNPs. We summed the BMI-\nincreasing alleles (as identified in each GWAS) for each SNP and\nthen summed these counts of BMI-increasing alleles across the\nSNPs. Due to the lack of a comparable effect size metric between\nthe Speliotes et al. [7] and Monda et al. [18], we use unweighted\nrisk scores in most analyses although we also report weighted risk\nscores for GRS-E (using weights from [7]) to examine sensitivity to\nthe weighting. For individuals with missing information on SNPs\nto be included in a risk score (8% of individuals were missing\ninformation on at least one SNP in GRS-Omni but no individual\nwas missing information on more than four SNPs), we calculated\npro-rated genetic risk scores by dividing the calculated genetic risk\nscore by the number of SNPs with available calls and multiplying\nby the total number of SNPs in the score.\nThe SNPs included in the genetic risk scores are reported in\nTables 1 and 2. Since base rates of the risk alleles varied between\nthe white and black samples, we standardized the weighted sums\nof risk alleles to have a mean of 0 and a SD of 1 separately in each\nof the white and black samples for each genetic risk score. (For\nanalyses conducted using both white and black samples, results\nwere consistent if risk scores are instead standardized across race).\nIn the black sample, GRS-E and GRS-Omni were highly\ncorrelated (r = 0.91); GRS-A was less correlated with both (with\nGRS-E, r = 0.23; with GRS-Omni, r = 0.54). Effect-sizes reported\nfrom genetic risk score analyses reflect the effect of a one standard-\ndeviation increase in genetic risk on obesity outcomes.\nAnthropometry\nAnthropometric assessments of the Sibling Pairs were conducted\nat Add Health waves 3 and 4. Weight and height were measured\nduring in-person interviews [19]. Participants were weighed\nwithout shoes on a digital bathroom scale (to the nearest half-\npound in Wave 3 and tenth of a kilogram in Wave 4). The scales\nhad a maximum of 330 pounds (200 kg); individuals above these\nthresholds were coded as being at the maximum scale weights (9\nand 19 individuals were coded at this maximum weight for Waves\n3 and 4 respectively). Heights were measured to the nearest 1/8th\nof an inch. BMI was computed as kilograms per height in meters\nsquared. Obesity was defined as BMI$30. Anthropometric\ncharacteristics of the white and black samples are described in\nPolygenic Risk for Obesity\nTable 1. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms included in the genetic risk score for Europeans (GRS-E).\nChr Nearest Gene Speliotes et al.

Weights are the effect-sizes estimated in that analysis. In cases where the original GWAS SNP was not\navailable in the Add Health genotype database, linkage proxies were identified using the Broad Institute's SNAP tool [35] (1000 Genomes (Pilot 1) CEU reference sample). No proxy was available for rs11847697 near PRKD1. Alleles\nare reported according to dbSNP. Frequencies of BMI-increasing alleles are reported separately for white and black Add Health study members meeting genotype quality control criteria.\nPolygenic Risk for Obesity\nStatistical Analysis\nWe tested genetic associations with BMI and obesity using\nlinear and logistic regression models, respectively. Analyses were\nconducted separately in whites and blacks. We analyzed change in\nBMI and obesity from Wave 3 to Wave 4 by including the level of\nWave 3 BMI (or obesity) as a predictor in multivariate regression\nmodels predicting Wave 4 BMI (or obesity). All regressions were\nestimated using multilevel models (random intercept) to account\nfor the non-independence of observations within families [20] and\nwere adjusted for age and sex. All continuous outcomes were\nstandardized within race. There was greater variability in the BMI\nof black respondents, see Table 3. Effect sizes reflect the effect in\nSDs of a 1 SD increase in genetic risk score on BMI or BMI\nchange or on the log odds of obesity or in log odds of change in\nobesity (reported as odds ratios).\nWe conducted two additional sets of analyses. First, because a\nprevious study reported that the predictive performance of an\nobesity genetic risk score differed in black and white populations\n[4], we tested for differences in genetic associations with obesity\nphenotypes between blacks and whites. These analyses combined\nblack and white respondents were into a single dataset. The\nmodels included a main effect term for race, a main effect term for\ngenetic risk, and an interaction term testing race differences in the\nmagnitude of the genetic effect.\nSecond, to rule out confounding by unmeasured population\nstratification [21], we conducted a sibling difference analysis using\nfamily fixed effects. The sibling difference analysis tested whether,\nwithin a pair of siblings who grew up in the same household, the\nsibling with the higher genetic risk score had the higher BMI.\nSibling difference analyses provide a control for any unmeasured\npopulation stratification [22]. To maximize statistical power for\nthese models, we analyzed all available data from waves 3 and 4\nand introduced an individual-level random intercept to account\nfor the non-independence of observations within individuals.\nResults\nWhite and black young adults at higher genetic risk as measured\nby GRS-E had higher BMIs compared to their lower genetic risk\nage-peers (Table 4). For whites, genetic associations with BMI\nresults with unweighted risk scores are reported unless indicated\notherwise). For blacks, genetic associations with BMI were r = 0.14\nassociations with BMI did not differ between the white and black\nsamples at either Wave (p.0.75 for both tests).\nWhite and black young adults at higher genetic risk as measured\nby GRS-E were also more likely to be obese compared to those at\nlower genetic risk. For whites, genetic associations with obesity\n1.83] at Wave 4. For blacks, genetic associations with obesity were\nWave 4. Genetic associations with obesity were similar in blacks\nand whites at Wave 3 (p = 0.38). At Wave 4, the effect magnitude\nwas larger among whites as compared to blacks (p = 0.06). Over\nthe 7-year interval between waves 3 and 4, white young adults at\nhigher genetic risk gained more weight and were more likely to\nbecome obese as compared to their lower genetic risk age-peers\n1.79]). Genetic risk was not associated with change in BMI and\nobesity among blacks. Insufficient statistical power is a possible,\nbut unlikely, explanation for the failure to detect an association\nbetween the GRS and BMI change in the black Sibling Pairs;\nbased on the effect observed in the white Sibling Pairs, we have\nTable 2.

In cases where the original GWAS SNP was not available in the Add Health genotype database, linkage\nproxies were identified using the Broad Institute's SNAP tool [35] (1000 Genomes (Pilot 1) YRI reference sample). Frequencies of BMI-increasing alleles are reported separately for white and black Add Health study members\nmeeting genotype quality control criteria.\nPolygenic Risk for Obesity\n73% power in the black Sibling Pairs sample. However, the Add\nHealth Sibling Pairs is slightly underpowered as a dataset to test\nblack-white differences in genetic risk score associations with BMI\nchange; power for these analyses was below 50%.\nWeighting GRS SNPs by the effect-sizes estimated in GWAS\nhad a modest effect on genetic risk score performance. Because\nweights customize the contribution of each SNP to the GRS\naccording to its effect on BMI, the expectation is that a weighted\nGRS will provide superior prediction as compared to a GRS in\nwhich all SNPs are weighted equally. For most of the phenotypes\nanalyzed, test-statistics and effect sizes were similar for weighted\nand un-weighted scores (Table 4).\nWe also analyzed genetic associations with a more direct\nmeasure of adiposity: the ratio of waist-circumference to height\n[23\u00ad25]. Similar to results for BMI, white and black young adults\nat higher genetic risk as measured by GRS-E had higher waist-\nheight ratios as compared to their lower genetic risk peers (for\n0.01 for blacks; as with BMI, the waist-height ratio was\nstandardized in each racial group). Genetic associations did not\ndiffer between white and black samples (p = 0.86).\nAs a final test of the performance of GRS-E, we examined\nsibling differences in BMI using fixed effects regression techniques.\nBecause previous race-stratified analyses yielded parallel results for\nwhites and blacks with BMI, we pooled samples for the sibling\ndifferences analysis (for added stringency, we also included the first\nfour principal components). Results were little changed from our\noriginal analyses. Across the Wave 3 and 4 assessments, the sibling\nwith the higher genetic risk score had higher BMI (b = 0.62,\np = 0.06; BMI was unstandardized in this analysis).\nTable 3.

Genetic risk was measured using the genetic risk score for Europeans\n(GRS-E). Regressions were estimated using multi-level models [20] to account for the clustering of observations within families and adjusted for age and sex. Change\nmodels were estimated by including Wave 3 outcomes as covariates in regression models predicting Wave 4 outcomes.\nPolygenic Risk for Obesity\nTo test whether incorporating SNPs discovered in GWAS of\nAfrican-descent individuals would improve GRS performance in\nAfrican Americans, we compared the performance of GRS-E to\nthat of GRS-A and GRS-Omni in the black Add Health Sibling\nPairs (n = 667). Table 5 reports results for the analyses described\nabove using the alternate genetic risk scores. For BMI, results were\nsimilar for all genetic risk scores (see also Figure 1). Inclusion of\nSNPs discovered in the Monda et al. [18] GWAS of BMI in\nAfrican Americans and Africans modestly improved the perfor-\nmance of the genetic risk score (GRS-A and GRS-Omni scores\nperformed better than GRS-E in the black Sibling Pairs).\nDiscussion\nWe used data from a prospective longitudinal study to examine\nthe effects of cumulative genetic risk on body-mass phenotypes in\nwhite and black young adults. Consistent with findings from\nprevious studies using samples of white adults [4,14,26], individ-\nuals at higher genetic risk had higher BMI, were more likely to be\nobese, and had higher levels of body fat (as measured by waist-\nheight ratio) compared to their lower genetic risk peers. A novel\nfinding of our study is that magnitudes of genetic associations,\nespecially with BMI, were similar in white and black samples.\nResults for white and black samples differed in analyses of change\nover time. In the white sample, young adults at higher genetic risk\ngained more weight and were more likely to become obese as\ncompared to those at lower genetic risk. In the black sample, these\nassociations were in the same direction, but were smaller in\nmagnitude and not statistically significant. We further showed that\nalternate genetic risk scores derived from GWAS of Europeans\nand from GWAS of African Americans and Africans performed\nsimilarly in predicting BMI and obesity in African American\nyoung adults. We also note that although the risk score created\nfrom the GWAS on African Americans utilized a small number of\nSNPs, the association is unlikely to be driven by a single SNP given\nthe fact that the weights cited in the GWAS [18] are relatively\nconsistent with the least predictive SNP being only half as\npredictive as the most predictive SNP. In contrast, the most\npredictive SNP in the Speliotes et al. [7] GWAS is ten times\npredictive as many of the other SNPs.\nThe magnitudes of genetic associations with obesity phenotypes\nwere small; e.g. a one SD increase in GRS-E predicted a 0.14 SD\nincrease in BMI at Wave 3 for those in the black sample. These\ntranslate to roughly a 0.9 point increase in BMI. Using the genetic\nrisk score as an individual-level risk assessment would produce too\nmany false positive and false negative results to recommend\nimmediate clinical translation [27]. Nevertheless, the small effects\nwe report are consistent with effect sizes for many other\nbiomarkers routinely assessed in clinical settings [28]. Moreover,\nsibling comparison analyses showed that genetic associations with\nBMI were detectable within sibling pairs, indicating that genetic\neffects, although small, are apparent even in individuals who share\nthose risk factors for obesity defined by the family environment.\nMore research is needed to understand how GWAS-discovered\ngenetic risks combine with other risk factors in order to understand\ncomplex traits [16].\nOur findings have important implications for the use of genetic\nrisk scores in obesity research. Our study provides evidence of\ntransethnic replication of a genetic risk score for obesity based on\nGWAS discoveries in European-descent samples in a population-\nbased black cohort. Some of the SNPs discovered in GWAS of\nobesity in European-descent samples have been replicated in black\nsamples [18,29], but transethnic replication a GWAS-based\ngenetic risk score for obesity was uncertain. A recent analysis of\ndata from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study\nfound that associations between the genetic risk score and obesity\nwere weaker in blacks as compared to whites [14]. In that study,\nthe genetic association with body-mass-index was r = 0.13 in\nwhites, a little less than what we report from Add Health, but\nFigure 1. Comparison of GRS predictions. Panel A compares the predictive performance of GRS-E in both white and black samples of Add\nHealth respondents based on a model where Wave 3 BMI is predicted by only GRS (separately in each racial group). Panel B focuses on predictions\nbased on the three risk scores for only the black sample of respondents. The fitted lines are based on linear models controlling for age, sex, and one\nof the risk scores. The predictions assume an age of 21 and female.\nPolygenic Risk for Obesity\namong blacks the magnitude of this association was reduced by\ntwo thirds. Research is needed to determine the cause of the\ndiscrepancy between results from the ARIC and Add Health\ncohorts. Three obvious differences in the cohorts are their age\u00ad\nARIC participants are in their 50s and 60s whereas Add Health\nparticipants are in their 20s; the timing of assessments\u00adthe ARIC\nHealth cohort was assessed in the 2000s; and the geographic\nlocations where individuals in the samples lived\u00adblack ARIC\nparticipants lived in North Carolina and Mississippi whereas Add\nHealth participants were representatively drawn from across the\nUnited States. Thus, age, period, and cohort factors as well as\nfactors related to place all represent candidate explanations\nDevelopmental processes, gene-environment correlations, and\ngene-environment interactions are promising targets for future\ninquiry into variation in the effects of obesity genetic risk scores\n[31\u00ad33]. Research in European-descent samples has identified\nrapid childhood growth, partly arising from decreased satiety\nresponse, as a mediator of genetic risk for obesity and points to\nsedentary lifestyle and poor diet as important moderators of\nmay differ between Add Health black respondents and the older\nAfrican Americans examined in other studies, contributing to the\nsmall differences in genetic associations with obesity that we\nobserve at Wave 4. Now that this study has provided evidence for\ntransethnic replication of the genetic risk score in black young\nadults, future research can investigate the role of gene-environ-\nment interactions in determining genetic associations with obesity\nin blacks.\nWe acknowledge limitations. First, we provide evidence for\ntransethic replication of genetic risk score associations with obesity\nphenotypes in white and black young adults, but results may not\ngeneralize to other ethnic groups. Additional studies focusing on\nother populations are needed. Second, the obesity phenotypes we\nexamined were derived from anthropometric assessments that may\ncapture body-size variation due to muscle mass as well as\nadiposity. We did replicate genetic associations with body-mass\nindex using waist-circumference-to-height ratio, a superior mea-\nsure of adiposity (that was available only for Wave 4). Finally, Add\nHealth is a nationally representative sample, but the Sibling Pairs\nStudy subsample that we analyzed is smaller and may not\nrepresent children who do not have siblings. As with all genetic\nresearch, replication of findings in additional samples is a priority.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: BWD DWB MBM JDB.\nAnalyzed the data: BWD JDB.
