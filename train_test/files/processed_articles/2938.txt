    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe investigate how differential exposures by German banks to the US real estate market during the\nrecent financial crisis affect their corporate lending in Germany. Using unique bank-level exposure da-\nta, we distinguish between three different types of bank exposures, i.e. direct exposure to the US real\nestate sector, direct exposure to subprime lenders in the US, and indirect exposure through the liquidi-\nty provided to ABCP conduits. We find that banks with a higher exposure to the US real estate sector\nand to conduits cut their lending to German firms by more following a decrease in US home prices\nthan banks that do not have such an exposure. Moreover, these banks then also shift their lending to\nindustry\u00adregion combinations with lower insolvency ratios. Hence possible losses abroad shift bank\nlending at home, and the size of this effect depends on the type and the degree of exposure the bank\nhas.\n",

While the main focus was on the fragility of the fi-\nnancial system (and, to some extent, the regulatory focus is still on how to re-establish a healthy\nbanking industry), the initial policy reaction relied mostly on monetary tools. These measures\nproved to be not entirely effective due to the presence of excessive household debt coupled with de-\ncreasing house prices. The crisis may not have been as severe, it is often argued now, if those un-\nderlying problems had have been addressed in a first and foremost step (Mian and Sufi (2014)).\nGerman banks, too, experienced considerable loan losses and ensuing capital constraints. This\nwas largely attributed to their various exposures to the US real estate market. In addition to their di-\nrect lending to US firms in the real estate sector and to major subprime lenders, German banks also\nbecame exposed by providing liquidity support in the form of credit lines to their asset-backed\ncommercial paper (ABCP) conduits.\nThe first banks that had to be bailed out by a government during the financial crisis were actual-\nly two German banks, IKB Deutsche Industriebank and Sachsen Landesbank. The deteriorating\nquality of their assets and the panic on the ABCP market forced these German banks to write off the\nliquidity lines they had provided to their ABCP conduits. These write-offs resulted in considerable\nlosses on their balance sheets. In general, the Landesbanks' substantial exposures to US mortgage-\nbacked securities through their ABCP conduits, which were higher than those of the large German\nbanks, led to the collapse or bail-out of various Landesbanks.\nGiven these differences, we therefore investigate how each type of exposure in the US influ-\nenced domestic lending in Germany. We first suitably document the overall contraction in lending\nthat occurred in Germany, then focus on the heterogeneity in the contraction taking place across\nbanks and firms. We are mainly interested in seeing whether  when home prices started to decline\nin the US  differences in bank exposures to the US real estate market started to determine bank\nlending in Germany according to firm risk.\nWe are clearly not the first to study (and for identification purposes `exploit') the international\ntransmission of shocks through the banking sector. Our research follows the seminal work by Peek\nand Rosengren (1997) and Peek and Rosengren (2000) who show that when parent banks are faced\nwith a (funding) shock, this can negatively affect lending by their foreign affiliates.1 In particular\nPeek and Rosengren (1997) identify a supply shock to bank lending in the US through US branches\nof Japanese banks, which was caused by the decline in Japanese stock market values. Unlike the\nprevious studies trying to examine the relationship between capital ratios and the overall volume of\nlending, their study actually disentangles loan supply from loan demand by focusing on the trans-\nmission of the capital effects of the Japanese stock market declines. Their paper documents that the\nJapanese banks' capital ratios significantly determine its commercial and industrial lending in the\nUS. Using similar data, Peek and Rosengren (2000) investigate the change in commercial real estate\nloans in spatially separated markets, which enables them to examine the impact of this loan supply\nshock on the real economic activity in the US.\nA recent paper (and closest to ours) is a paper by Puri, Rocholl and Steffen (2011). They investi-\ngate the impact of the financial crises on the credit supply of German savings banks. Here, the\ntransmission occurs through savings banks' holdings in Landesbanks that were exposed to subprime\nmortgages.2 This mechanism is somewhat different from the one in Peek and Rosengren since an\nexternal financial shock is transmitted to a domestic market through the exposure of the domestic\nbanks. For that reason, it becomes even more important and potentially more difficult to isolate the\nloan supply effect. Puri, Rocholl and Steffen (2011) disentangle supply from demand effects by\nemploying information coming from the loan application process. The authors find that affected\nRecent research confirms that, during the global financial crisis, global banks transmitted shocks across borders through their local affil-\niates (see, among others, Cetorelli and Goldberg (2011); Cetorelli and Goldberg (2012); Acharya, Afonso and Kovner (2013);\nAlbertazzi and Bottero (2013); Claessens and van Horen (2013); Cull and Martinez Peria (2013); Ongena, Peydr\u00f3 and van Horen\nOther papers studying the international transmission through the asset side of the banks include De Haas and Van Horen (2013) and\nPopov and Van Horen (2013). The former paper examines syndicated loans and finds that crisis-related write-downs negatively affect-\ned cross-border bank lending. The latter paper finds that large holdings of impaired sovereign debt negatively affected bank lending\nduring the European sovereign debt crisis. Cu\u00f1at, Cvijanovic' and Yuan (2013) study the domestic transmission of real estate price\nshocks within the US using bank balance sheets.\nsavings banks reject more loan applications than non-affected banks. However, close bank-firm re-\nlationships help to mitigate the loan supply shock.\nA number of features clearly distinguish our paper from Puri, Rocholl and Steffen (2011). First,\nhaving access to unique and confidential supervisory data, we know the actual time-varying expo-\nsures to the US real estate market (direct lending to the US real estate sector, to major subprime\nlenders, and conduit exposures) of all German banks. Combined with the US home price shock,\nthese exposures to the US real estate market allow us to identify possible (but at the time not yet\npublicly observable) bank losses. In contrast, Puri, Rocholl and Steffen (2011) rely on ex post pub-\nlicly reported distress at three Landesbanks which reduced the value of equity held by savings\nbanks present in their loan data set. Thus our data set allows us to assess the time-varying effects of\nvarious types of German bank exposures to the US real estate market throughout the entire crisis pe-\nriod, not just the presumed (though plausible) impact through indirect linkages within parts of the\nGerman banking system.\nSecond, to identify the changes in lending we rely on credit register data that cover the entire\nbanking sector in Germany, not just savings banks. We match this data with bank and market char-\nacteristics. Finally, we examine the resultant changes not only in the aggregate volume but also in\nthe composition of bank lending in Germany across corporations, industries and regions as we want\nto investigate whether there is a `flight to quality' in lending in Germany for those banks that were\nmore exposed to the US real estate market.3\nIn terms of credit volume we find that banks that had a direct exposure to the US real estate sec-\ntor contracted their lending in Germany by more following a decrease in US home prices than banks\nthat did not have such exposure. This effect is both statistically significant and economically rele-\nvant. For example, a bank with a 1 billion exposure to the US real estate sector, and following a\ndecrease by 5 index points (which is equal to two standard deviations) in the S&P/Case-Shiller US\nIn this respect, our paper also contributes to an extant literature that examines the flight to quality or loan strictness following negative\nshocks affecting banks (Lang and Nakamura (1995); Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist (1996); Murfin (2012); Becker and Ivashina\n(2014)), or documents bank risk-taking following expansionary monetary shocks (Ioannidou, Ongena and Peydr\u00f3 (2014); Jim\u00e9nez,\nOngena, Peydr\u00f3 and Saurina (2014)). See also e.g. for the US (Altunbas, Gambacorta and Marquez-Iba\u00f1ez (2014); Delis, Hasan and\nEickmeier and Prieto (2014a)), Austria (Gaggl and Valderrama (2010)), Colombia (L\u00f3pez, Tenjo and Z\u00e1rate (2010a), L\u00f3pez, Tenjo and\nZ\u00e1rate (2010b)), the Czech Republic (Gersl, Jakub\u00edk, Kowalczyk, Ongena and Peydr\u00f3 (2015)), Portugal (Bonfim and Soares (2013)),\nNational Home Price Index, is estimated to contract its quarterly lending in Germany by 1.1 per-\ncentage points more than a bank with no such exposure. This is a large effect given that the mean\n(median) quarterly loan growth during the sample period equals -2.0 (-1.0) percent). And a bank\nwith 1 billion in US conduits is estimated to contract its quarterly lending in Germany by 1.0 per-\ncentage points more than banks without conduits in place following a decrease by 5 index points in\nhome prices.\nIn terms of credit composition, we find clear evidence of a flight to quality. For example, a bank\nwith a 1 billion exposure to the US real estate sector, and following a decrease by 5 index points in\nthe S&P/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index, is estimated to contract its quarterly lending\nin Germany to firms in riskier industry\u00adregion combinations (i.e. those with a 1 percentage point\nhigher insolvency rate) by 3.3 percentage points more than a bank with no such exposure. A bank\nwith 1 billion in US conduits is estimated to contract its quarterly lending to such riskier industry\u00ad\nregion pairs by 2.4 percentage points more than banks without conduits in place when US home\nprices decrease by 5 index points. Overall, these findings imply that possible losses abroad may not\nonly cut but also shift bank lending at home, but that the size of this effect may depend on the type\nof exposure the bank has.\nThe remainder of our paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we discuss the various expo-\nsures German banks have in the US and their lending to firms in Germany. In Section III we de-\nscribe the data and the definition of the variables of interest. We discuss the methodology and pre-\nsent the main estimation results in Section IV. Section V concludes.\n2 Exposures in the US and Lending in Germany\n2.1 Bank Exposure to Real Estate, Subprime and Conduits\n2.1.1 The Three Types of Exposures\nGerman banks were engaged in at least three ways in the US real estate market: some banks had\ndirect (regular) exposures to the US real estate sector on their balance sheets, some banks had expo-\nsures to subprime lenders, and some banks had asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits in\nplace.\nTable 1 gives a detailed overview of German banks' portfolios based on the credit register data\nby distinguishing between on and off-balance sheet exposures in 2007. The upper panel of the table\nprovides the regional distribution of exposures to the real estate sector, including Greece, Ireland,\nPortugal, Spain, offshore centers, the US and all foreign countries.4 We can clearly see that German\nbanks' exposure to US firms in the real estate sector was significantly higher than exposures to any\nof the other countries' firms in the same sector. Whereas US real estate exposure exceeds 30 bil-\nlion, the second highest exposure, which is to offshore centers, totals only 13.6 billion, while the\nthird highest, which is to Spain, equals 10.6 billion. Moreover, US real estate exposure was poten-\ntially the first to be struck by a collapse in home prices and this exposure will therefore experience\nthe \"cleanest\" (identifiable) shock to real estate during the crisis.\nTable 1 also breaks down the exposures by three types, i.e. on and off-balance sheet exposures\nand derivatives. The fraction of the on-balance sheet exposures ranges from 87 to 92 percent for all\nthree types of exposures, which explains our later approach of focusing on these on-balance sheet\nexposures. The rest of the table lists the outstanding loans to US banks (157 billion) and the total\nexposure to offshore centers (148 billion). It is not surprising that the structure of lending to banks\ndiffers from the direct exposure to the real estate sector as the former consists of similar shares of\non and off-balance sheet exposures due to a higher share of derivatives.\nThe bulk of the German banks' engagement in the US subprime mortgage market took place\nthrough the investment activities of their ABCP conduits, however.5 For the mean bank among the\nmillion, exposure to major subprime lenders to 1.3 million, and conduit exposure to 81.3 million\n(Table 2). But only a few banks had such exposures. Among the 41 banks with real estate expo-\nDuring the eurozone crisis, Greece, Ireland and Portugal received bail-out funds of 148.6, 54.9 and 61.4 billion, respectively. An-\nother eurozone member, Spain, experienced problems in the real estate sector reflected in decreasing house prices. Finally, exposure to\noffshore centers is an indication of SPV exposures.\nSince the credit register does not contain exposures to ABCP conduits, we do not include the information on those exposures in Table\n1. The data on ABCP conduits comes from Moody's ABCP Query and is discussed in Table 2.\nprime exposures, the mean (median) exposure was equal to 25 (5) million; while for the 13 banks\nwith conduits, the mean (median) exposure was equal to 9.7 (5.7) billion.\n2.1.2 The Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Conduits\nABCP conduits set up by German banks performed maturity transformation by purchasing long-\nterm assets and issuing asset-backed commercial paper, a short term debt instrument which is often\nused to raise capital. The ABCP were primarily sold to money market funds (MMFs) and rolled\nover at regular intervals. Nevertheless ABCP conduits used to be off-balance sheet vehicles and\nrepresented the agents of the \"shadow banking\" market which appeared to be less regulated. There-\nfore, German banks could hold assets in their ABCP conduits without providing a sufficient amount\nof the required capital.\nABCP conduits were designed to protect investors from declines in the market value of the un-\nderlying assets. Sponsoring banks provided liquidity support to their ABCP conduits. According to\nMoody's (2007): \"Most programmes have 100% committed liquidity support that can be drawn to\nrepay ABCP up to the par value of non-defaulted assets, regardless of market value.\" In cases\nwhere ABCP conduits experienced difficulties, credit risk attributed to the ABCP conduits effec-\ntively put a strain on their parent banks.\nBeing a safe haven for investors before the crisis, ABCP conduits played a central role in the fi-\nnancial crisis 2007-2009 when news about the deteriorating quality of US subprime mortgages\nroiled the financial markets and the market for ABCP froze with risk-averse investors being unwill-\ning to purchase and roll over maturing ABCP (Acharya and Schnabl (2010); Kacperczyk and\nBetween August 2007 and the Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy in September 2008, the ABCP\nmarket was seriously stressed. In this period, the total value of ABCP outstanding decreased by 37\npercent, from $1.18 trillion to $745 billion. However, the cost of issuing overnight ABCP relative to\nthe US Federal Reserve Funds rate also jumped from 10 to 150 basis points after the news of the\nwithdrawals from BNP Paribas. On 16 September 2008, the Reserve Primary Fund \u00ad a large MMF\n\u00ad announced considerable losses on its holdings of Lehman Brothers' CP. This in turn triggered a\nrun on the MMF industry and led to the reduction of holdings of all types of CP by MMFs. After\nLehman Brothers' collapse, German banks, which were already weakened by the need to meet their\nobligations on maturing ABCP, came under further pressure.\n2.2 Lending to Domestic Firms in Germany\nCredit growth in Germany has been characterized by various fluctuations since 2002. The annual\ngrowth rate of lending to domestic firms rose sharply from -0.1 percent in May 2007 to 3.8 percent\nin July 2008, whereas a remarkable drop was observed starting from the third quarter of 2008\nOn 31 July, 2007, the news about the bankruptcy of the two Bear Stearns' hedge funds invested in subprime mortgages reached the\nmarket. On 7 August 2007, the French Bank BNP Paribas pronounced its withdrawals from its three funds due to an inability to judge\nthe \"fair\" value of their holdings.\n(Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report, 9/2009). The annual growth in lending declined by 2.7\nother hand, witnessed a sharper decline in lending than Germany, and also at an earlier point in time\nThe slowdown in lending is found to be situated in the non-financial industry. Growth in lending\ndeclined sharply especially for those banking groups that were hit particularly hard by the global fi-\nnancial crisis.\n3 Data and Methodology\nWe employ a unique matched firm-bank level dataset that contains quarterly information from\nthe 1st quarter of 2005 to the 4th quarter of 2009. The data combine five databases, i.e. the credit\nregister (MiMik), Moody's ABCP Query, bank balance sheet data (Bista, BAKIS), regional firm in-\nsolvencies per industry and home price indices (S&P/Case-Shiller). These data sources make it pos-\nsible to observe the individual lending behavior of German banks to domestic firms, and to combine\nthis information with the exposure of German banks to the real estate sector in the US, to subprime\nlenders in the US, and to their conduits in the US, as well as to use the firm and bank-specific in-\nformation.\nThe Deutsche Bundesbank's credit register (MiMik) is the main data source for the individual\nexposures of German banks to firms.7 The credit register contains information on large exposures of\n1.5 million (formerly 3 million Deutsche Mark) and above.8 Therefore, exposures to small and\nmedium-sized firms might be underrepresented in this database. However, if the sum of the expo-\nsures to firms in a borrower unit exceeds the threshold of 1.5 million, the individual exposure to a\nDetails on the credit register can be found in Schmieder (2006), and in published work by Schertler, Buch and Westernhagen (2006),\nHayden, Porath and Westernhagen (2007) and Ongena, T\u00fcmer-Alkan and von Westernhagen (2012), for example. The Bundesbank al-\nso maintains a website with working papers based on its credit register.\nFor a more detailed definition, see Section 14 of the Banking Act (Deutsche Bundesbank, 2001). If exposures of 1.5 million or above\nexisted during the reporting period but are partly or fully repaid, the remaining exposure is reported even if the amount is zero. We take\nthe actual amounts of the exposures into consideration.\nfirm in that borrower unit is reported, even if it is a small exposure. This reporting partly abates the\nextant bias in the credit register towards medium and large-sized firms.\nBank exposures to firms in the credit register are defined fairly broadly, e.g. they include not on-\nly corporate loans but also corporate bonds.9 In the credit register we are able to distinguish between\non-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items.10 We choose to use only on-balance sheet positions,\nsince the inclusion of off-balance sheet exposures leads to an overstatement of the actual exposures\ndue to guarantees provided by banks to the other banks.\nBased on individual bank exposures to firms, banks and other financial institutions, the credit\nregister covers both domestic and foreign exposures and contains the information on country code\nand industry classification within a particular country. This structure of the credit register allows us\nto identify both individual bank exposures to the real estate sector as well as to the top subprime\nlenders in the US, and enables us to study the impact of these exposures on the lending of German\nbanks to domestic firms. However, although the credit register contains some information on firm\nquality before the 1st quarter of 2008, we augment the available information with the industry-level\nnumber of firm defaults within particular German Federal States from the Federal Statistical Office.\nThis information on the industry number of firm defaults allows us to differentiate between the\nlending behavior of German banks towards firms with a worse and a higher quality.\nThe second database we use is the Moody's ABCP Query. From this database we take the in-\nformation on all important conduits of German banks and on the amount of liquidity provision of\nGerman banks to their conduits. However, this information is available in the Moody's ABCP Que-\npublications: \"A Performance Overview for EMEA ABCP conduits\" and \"A Program Review for\nUS conduits\". This information allows us to study the impact of the German bank exposure to their\nconduits on lending behavior to domestic firms. Similar to the real estate exposure in the US and\nFor a more detailed definition of the bank exposures, see Section 19 of the Banking Act (Deutsche Bundesbank, 2001). The following\nitems are deemed not to be bank exposures: shares in other enterprises and securities in the trading portfolio.\nFor example, lease receivables, mortgage loans, publicly guaranteed loans, and inter-bank loans (with a residual maturity of up to one\nyear) are listed separately under on-balance sheet activities. Off-balance sheet items include derivatives (other than written option posi-\ntions), guarantees assumed to cover these and other off-balance sheet transactions (Deutsche Bundesbank, 1998).\nexposure to the subprime lenders in the US (taken from the credit register), the German bank expo-\nsure to their conduits is quarterly and is aggregated at the bank level.\nWe borrow the majority of our bank-specific variables from the monthly balance sheet statistics\n(Bista) and some of our bank-specific variables from BAKIS. BAKIS is the Information System,\nwhich is shared between the Deutsche Bundesbank and BaFin (the German Federal Banking Super-\nvisory Office). It contains the bank balance sheets for all German banks. We select the monthly bal-\nance sheet statistics and match them with the credit register on a quarterly basis. Some risk indica-\ntors, such as e.g. non-performing loans, are not available in Bista and we extract them on a yearly\nbasis from BAKIS.\nFinally, to capture the price developments in the US real estate market, we access the S&P/Case-\nShiller Home Price Indices.\n3.2 Measuring Bank Exposures to Financial Shocks in the US\nWhen measuring bank exposures to financial shocks in the US, we differentiate between direct\nand indirect bank exposures. Direct exposures are taken from the credit register and appear talis\nqualis on banks' balance sheets. Under indirect exposure, we consider the amount of liquidity that\nGerman banks provided to their conduits before and in the aftermath of the US crisis. These expo-\nsures are considered to be off-balance sheet and thus do not directly appear on banks' balance\nsheets in the event that banks' conduits run into trouble.\nMore precisely, we define the three different bank exposures in the US as follows: Log US Real\nEstate Exposureit\nis the logarithm of the total exposure of bank i in a particular quarter t to the US\nreal estate sector11. This information is taken directly from the credit register. US Real Estate Expo-\nsureit\nis accumulated across individual bank-firm level exposures to the US real estate sector (and\ntherefore varies at the bank level but does not vary across firms borrowing from the same bank\nwhen we assess the changes in lending at the bank-firm level).\nWe take the logarithm of the exposure plus one in order to incoporate those banks which do not have any exposure to the US real es-\ntate sector. For those banks we take the logarithm of zero plus one. We use the same approach for the other exposures as well.\nWe also define Log US Subprime Exposureit\nas the logarithm of the total exposure of bank i in a\nparticular quarter t to the subprime lenders in the US. Again this information is taken directly from\nthe credit register. We gathered information on the top 25 subprime lenders in the US which experi-\nenced difficulties during the US mortgage crisis. However, the German banks have been exposed to\n18 of these top subprime lenders.12 US Subprime Exposureit\nis accumulated across the individual\nexposures to subprime lenders in the US and therefore varies only by bank.\nFinally, we define the Log Conduit Exposureit\nas the logarithm of the total amount of liquidity\nprovided by bank i in a particular quarter t to its ABCP conduits. The information on the liquidity\nlines is taken from Moody's ABCP Query. Log Conduit Exposureit\nis accumulated across individual\nexposures to ABCP conduits and therefore varies again only by bank. The definition and measure-\nment of bank exposures to financial shocks in the US is summarized in Table 3.\nTable 4 provides the descriptive statistics on the US real estate, subprime and conduit exposures\nacross the dataset we employ. We have almost 4.7 million bank-firm-quarter observations of differ-\nent bank exposures in the US to help us identify their impact on lending of German banks to domes-\ntic firms. Not all banks in our sample have been exposed to shocks in the US. For those banks for\nwhich we cannot find reliable direct or indirect exposures to shocks in the US, we assume that their\nexposure to those shocks is equal to zero. This is a reasonable assumption given the exhaustive\ncharacter of our data sources.13\nTable 4 again reflects that important German banks had considerable direct exposure to the US\nreal estate sector. On average, US real estate exposure for banks in our sample equals 442 million\nwith the 90th percentile value exceeding 1.6 billion. Subprime exposure, in comparison, does not\ncarry so much weight and equals on average 36 million with the standard deviation of 124 mil-\nlion. Table 4 clearly shows that the magnitude of the conduit exposure \u00ad which is off-balance sheet\n\u00ad is of a quite different magnitude compared to direct US real estate exposure. The average for the\nThe 18 top subprime lenders have been identified in the credit register as borrower units. In total, 123 enterprises in the credit register\nbelong to those 18 top subprime lenders.\nThe coverage of conduit exposures prior to 2007Q1 is very sketchy because rating agencies did not cover them as few observers antic-\nipated bank lines of credit would be provided in their rescue.\nbanks in our sample is around 1.9 billion and the standard deviation reaches 5.3 billion which is a\nvery large number indeed.14\n3.3 Assessing Domestic Bank-Firm Lending In Germany\nOur model explains the quarterly change in lending, representing the first difference of the loga-\nrithm of domestic lending:\nwhere Domestic Lendingijt\nrepresents exposure of bank i to firm j in Germany in a particular\nquarter t.\nIf the exposures were fully repaid during the quarter, zero values are reported at the end of the\nquarter in the dataset. However, in our analysis we capture only non-zero exposures and therefore\npredominately focus on continuing changes in domestic lending, i.e. the \"internal margin\".\nTable 4 shows that, in total, we have around 3.9 million bank-firm-quarter observations to assess\ndomestic lending by banks to firms. On average, domestic bank-firm lending in our sample is\naround 3.6 million. We note that average domestic lending in our sample appears to be much low-\ner compared to the average US real estate exposure, the average subprime exposure and the average\nconduit exposure. This is the case because large banks in particular have such exposures.\nTable 5 compares the number of observations for banks with and without exposures to the real\nestate sector, subprime or conduits. These sub-samples are not mutually exclusive. The sub-sample\nof banks with real estate exposure has over 1.4 million bank-firm-quarter observations of domestic\nlending. The average bank-firm level amount of domestic lending in this sub-sample equals 6 mil-\nlion and is somewhat larger than average domestic lending for the total sample. It should be men-\nWe acknowledge the fact that only a small number of banks were exposed as presented in Table 2. However, these banks are also the\nlenders to a higher number of borrowers compared to the rest of the banking industry with no exposures. This is observable in the\nnumber of observations of the exposed group to the total number as ranging from 25 to 35 percent (Table 5). In other words, these\nbanks have an important role in overall domestic lending.\n( ) ( )\n-\nijt\nijt\nijt\nLending\nDomestic\nlog\nLending\nDomestic\nlog\nLending\nDomestic\nlog\n -\n=\ntioned that banks with conduit exposures belong to the same sub-sample. However, a couple of\nbanks have subprime exposures although they do not have real estate exposures.\nThe sub-sample of banks with subprime exposure provides us with 926,000 bank-firm-quarter\nobservations of domestic lending. The average domestic lending for this sub-sample amounts to\n5.7 million. Also a number of banks do have direct exposure to the US real estate sector and pro-\nvide liquidity to conduits although they do not offer loans to subprime lenders.\nWe note that the number of banks that provide liquidity to conduits is significantly smaller com-\npared to the sub-samples discussed before. The sub-sample of banks with conduit exposure provides\nus with only around 426,000 bank-firm-quarter observations of domestic lending. Similar to the\nsub-samples with direct exposure to the real estate sector and the one with subprime exposure, the\naverage for domestic lending in this sub-sample, at 5.9 million, tends to be larger than the average\nfor the total sample.\nbanks that provide domestic balance-sheet loans to 336,990 firms in Germany. In total we have 3.9\nmillion bank-firm-quarter observations of domestic on-balance-sheet lending. However, a number\nof bank mergers took place during this time period. We carry out a merger correction procedure by\ncreating a new separate bank after the merger.15 Of the 2,031 banks involved, 90 banks have direct\nexposure to the US real estate sector, 142 banks have direct exposure to subprime lenders and 20\nbanks have conduit exposure.\nIn a final step we match the datasets discussed in Section III. A., and we end up with 2,030,417\nbank-firm-quarter credit exposures. Table 6 contains their summary statistics that imply (when\ncomparing to Table 4) that selection is fortunately minimal. It is also worth noting that the change\nin log domestic lending has negative mean and median values: -0.02 and -0.01, respectively.\nOur approach is based on separating the pre-merger banks from the merged bank. In the end, we have three banks, which are treated\nindependently from each other. We repeat this procedure as often as a merger takes place. Each time a newly merged bank receives a\nnew identification number, we drop the target banks in that year (or quarter).\n4 Explaining Domestic Bank-Firm Lending in Germany\nIn Table 7 we run the growth in domestic bank lending in Germany on different types of expo-\nsures, starting with total US exposure (total exposure to the US real estate market), followed by a\nclassification of our main variables of interest; US real estate exposure, US subprime exposure and\nconduit exposure, and various interactions that are introduced in different models, for the sample\nWe are particularly interested in the interaction of the exposures with: (1) the change in US\nhome prices to gauge the impact of this incoming shock on the volume of bank lending, on the one\nhand; and with (2) the change in US home prices and insolvency to gauge the impact of the incom-\ning shock on the composition of bank lending, on the other hand.\nWe estimate different forms of the following specification:\nlog Domestic Lending\nijt\n= \nlogExposure\n+ \nUS Houseprices\nt\n+ \nInsolvency\n+ \nlogExposure\n* US Houseprices\nt\n+ \nlogExposure\n* Insolvency\n+ \nUS Houseprices\nt\n*Insolvency\n+ \nlogExposure\n*US Houseprices\nt\n*Insolvency\n+ \nBank Controls\nN\n + \ni\n+ \nj\n+ \nijt\nwhere log Domestic Lendingijt\nis the growth of domestic lending (measured as the quarter-on-\nquarter logarithmic change in domestic lending by banks i to firms j in quarter t). In terms of expo-\nsure by German banks in the US, we distinguish between Total US Exposureit-1\n, US Real Estate Ex-\nposureit-1\n, Subprime Exposureit-1\nand Conduit Exposureit-1\n. US Homepricest\nis the change in US\nhome prices while Insolvencyjt-1\ndefines the firm insolvency rate at the industry-region level. The\nbank controls we feature are size (log of total assets), capital and liquidity ratios, ROA, and NPL.16\nAll bank variables are quarterly except ROA and NPL. These two variables are only available on a yearly basis.\nAll specifications include comprehensive sets of bank and also firm fixed effects (i\nand \nj\nis the error term.\nWe employ sets of three specifications for each exposure type, always starting with a simple\nmodel without any interactions, a second model with the interaction of exposure and US home pric-\nes, and a third model with the double and triple interactions with insolvency.\nEach third specification, and also the final one which includes the triple interaction term, can\nhelp answer one of our main research questions: \"Is there a flight to quality in bank lending in Ger-\nmany when home prices in the US decline, and does the strength of this effect depend on the degree\nof the German bank's exposure to real estate, subprime and conduits in the US?\n4.2 Control Variables\nWe start by discussing the estimated coefficients on the control variables, after which we turn to\nthe coefficients of main interest on the double and triple interaction terms that include exposures.\nAmong bank control variables, all estimated coefficients except liquidity are statistically signifi-\ncant throughout. Representative estimates in this regard from Model 1, for example, are for log size\nply that a one standard deviation increase in the logarithm of total assets decreases the growth in\nand that a one standard deviation increase in NPL increases it by 0.2 percentage points (= 0.0356 \u00d7\n0.06527 \u00d7 100). For comparison, the mean growth of domestic loans across all bank-firm-quarter\nobservations equals -2.5 percent.\nBecause we are mainly interested in the effect of bank-level exposures over time, including bank-time fixed effects is problematic. Be-\ncause few firms in Germany rely on multiple banks that are differentiated by their exposures in the US, including firm-time fixed ef-\nfects equally robs the estimations of most if not all of their relevant variation. In further unreported robustness exercises we also inves-\ntigate whether the effects are differentiated across bank type and across time periods but we do not find statistically significant differ-\nences.\n*** Significant at 1 percent, ** significant at 5 percent, and * significant at 10 percent. For convenience we will also indicate the sig-\nnificance levels of the estimates that are mentioned further on in the text.\nNext we discuss the estimated coefficients on the variables the exposures will be interacted with,\ni.e. the variable that captures the change in US home prices and the variable Insolvency. The coeffi-\ncient for the change in US home prices is negative and significant in all models ranging between -\nimplies that a 5 index point decrease in US home prices (which is the largest drop that is observed\nbut one that occurs in more than one quarter of the observations) increases the growth in domestic\nThese estimates suggest that a substitution effect may be taking place whereby home price de-\nclines in the US per se may lead to more lending in Germany overall. Although the magnitude of\nthis effect is not that large, our estimates of coefficients on the double and triple interactions with\nthis variable presented below may gain further credence as this substitution effect (as we will see) is\noverturned when banks have exposures in the US.\nWith respect to the insolvency ratio of the borrower's region and industry, it decreases the\ngrowth in lending as expected. The coefficient is negative in all but one specification, but it is statis-\ntically insignificant.\nThe interaction term of the change in US home prices and insolvency appears to have an inverse\nrelationship with the change in lending. This implies that the substitution effect may be dominating\nthe tendency for \"flight to quality\".\n4.3 Main Effects of Exposures\nLet us now turn to the exposures and their interactions. Before investigating the three types that\nare directly related to the origins of the crisis, we estimate our model with the total exposure to the\nUS real estate market that is the sum of the three types. We observe in the first three models in Ta-\nble 7 that an increase in total US exposure decreases growth in domestic lending. In Model 1 the es-\ntimated coefficient equals -0.00038***. As the lower panel in Table 7 (which details the economic\nrelevancy assessment calculations) indicates, this estimate implies that a bank with a 1 billion total\nexposure to the US is estimated to contract its quarterly lending in Germany by 0.8 percentage\npoints more than a bank with no such exposure.19 Its interaction with changes in US home prices\n(0.00829**) implies an additional difference of 0.9 percentage points following a decrease by 5 in-\ndex points in the S&P/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index. This is our first main finding:\nGerman bank exposure to the US real estate market, and the possible losses emanating there as real\nestate prices in the US sagged, substantially contracted bank lending in Germany. A direct link in\nterms of credit volume.\nNext, in Model 3 we introduce insolvency as a measure of ex ante credit risk at the industry\u00ad\nregion level. The interactions of insolvency with the aforementioned terms are of main interest. The\nestimated coefficient on the double interaction term of exposure and insolvency equals -0.01717,\nwhile the estimated coefficient on the triple interaction term of exposure, US home prices and in-\nsolvency equals 1.86401***. The triple interaction implies that, following a decrease by 5 index\npoints in US home prices, a bank with a 1 billion exposure to the US real estate market contracts\nits quarterly lending to firms in Germany in riskier industry\u00adregion combinations (i.e. those with a 1\npercentage point higher insolvency rate) by an additional 1.9 percentage points more than a bank\nwith no such exposure. This is our second main finding: German bank exposure to the US real es-\ntate market overall and the possible losses emanating there as real estate prices in the US sagged,\nsubstantially shifted bank lending in Germany. A direct link in terms of credit composition, and\nclear evidence for a flight to quality.\nTotal US exposure is defined as the sum of the exposures to the US real estate market and con-\nsists of direct lending to the real estate sector and the subprime lenders, and the indirect conduit ex-\nposure. However, we would also like to focus on each particular type of exposure that is linked to\ndifferent aspects of the problems in the real estate sector in the US. Therefore it is of great interest\nTo assess economic relevancy, we rely on the amounts of 1 billion for total US exposure, real estate and conduit exposures and 100\nmillion for subprime exposure. This choice ensures ease and clarity of exposition, but it also broadly respects the absolute and relative\norder of magnitudes of the standard deviations and means of the exposure variables (see Table 6). The standard deviation on real estate\nexposure equals 1 billion and on subprime 116 million. On conduits, the standard deviation equals 4.5 billion, while its mean equals\nto examine a direct exposure to the US real estate sector in order to have a cleaner measure. We first\nobserve in Models 4, 5 and 6 in Table 7 that US real estate exposure per se does not explain much\nof the changes in domestic lending, but that its interaction with US home prices in Model 5 strongly\ndoes. In the latter model, the estimated coefficient on the interaction equals 0.01078***. This esti-\nmate implies that a bank with a 1 billion exposure to the US real estate sector, and following a de-\ncrease by 5 index points in the S&P/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index, is estimated to\ncontract its quarterly lending in Germany by 1.1 percentage points more than a bank with no such\nexposure.20 This effect is slightly larger than the estimated coefficient in the previous set of exercis-\nes with total US exposure.\nThe coefficient on the double interaction term of exposure and insolvency has a larger magni-\ntude (-0.05522), however it is imprecisely estimated. The coefficient on the triple interaction term\nof exposure, US home prices and insolvency equals 3.19112**. Following a decrease by 5 index\npoints in US home prices, a bank with a 1 billion exposure to US real estate is estimated to con-\ntract its quarterly lending in Germany to riskier firms by an additional 3.3 percentage points more\nthan a bank with no such exposure. This is clearly a larger economic effect compared to the one\nfound for total exposure to the US real estate market suggesting that the direct link in terms of credit\ncomposition exists and may comprise a large part of the exposure effect.\nIn Models 7 to 9 in Table 7 we replace real estate with subprime exposure (which, as mentioned\npreviously, is to subprime lenders and distinct from real estate exposure). All relevant estimated co-\nefficients are imprecisely estimated probably due to the smaller amounts of exposures involved and\nthe fact that fewer banks have such exposures.\nYet, the signs of most coefficients are as expected. For example, the estimates in Model 9 imply\nthat a bank with a 100 million exposure to subprime lenders, and following a decrease by 5 index\npoints in US home prices, contracts its quarterly lending in Germany by 0.6 percentage points over-\nall, and to riskier firms by 0.6 percentage points more than a bank with no such exposure.\nNotice that for more than half the sample observations, the German banks involved have zero real estate exposure in the US, marking\nthese banks to be at once a relevant and ideal control group.\nHence once more credit volume and composition in Germany are affected by the possible losses\nthat emanate from exposures combined with home price declines in the US.\nFinally, in Models 10 to 12 in Table 7 we introduce conduit exposure. This exposure is very\nlarge. Indeed, the liquidity potentially provided to conduits is three times as high as US real estate\nexposure on average, and much larger than the amount lent to subprime lenders in our sample.\nHowever, we do not find evidence to argue that conduit exposure itself has an impact on lending in\nGermany. Yet the estimates in Model 11 show that a contraction in domestic lending is again\nspurred by US home prices dropping. A bank with a 1 billion exposure cuts lending by 1.0 per-\ncentage points more following a decrease by 5 index points in US home prices than a bank with ze-\nFinally, in Model 12 the estimated additional coefficients further imply that a bank with 1 bil-\nlion in US conduits contracts its quarterly lending to riskier firms in Germany by 1.4 percentage\npoints more than banks without conduits in place, with the additional home price effect resulting in\na contraction of 2.4 percentage points.\nIn sum, credit volume and composition in Germany are affected by the possible losses that ema-\nnate from exposures, combined with US home price declines, on real estate, subprime and conduits\nin the US.\nOur identification strategy relies on bank and bank-time level variation in exposures in the US,\ncoupled with firm fixed effects that account for firm-level demand in Germany. Due to the lack of\nmultiplicity in relationships, i.e. few German firms engage multiple banks, including firm-quarter\nfixed effects removes all the variation we are interested in. However, to account for time varying\nfirm-level demand, we generate \"firm-size times year\" fixed effects. We proxy firm size with the\nConduits may not have entirely been invested in real estate or at all. For example, \"credit arbitrage\" ABCP conduits invested heavily\nin securitized assets, such as asset-backed securities backed by residential mortgages and commercial mortgages, and were consequent-\nly more exposed to subprime US residential mortgage loans than other types of conduits. Other ABCP conduits, such as \"multi-seller\"\nor \"single-seller\" conduits, had primarily funded unsecured receivables by the time the financial crisis arrived. It is currently impossi-\nble for us to distinguish between the different types of assets present in the conduits.\nsum of total bank borrowing at firm level, and use the distribution of this variable to generate ten\ndifferent percentile dummies. For each size percentile we then generate a set of year-specific fixed\neffects.\nThe results remain mainly unaffected for total exposure to the US real estate market in terms of\nthe level and the double interactions whereas we lose significance for the triple interaction and\noverall for direct real estate exposures. We have to note that when including firm size-year fixed ef-\nfects, all bank controls are imprecisely estimated as well.\nHowever, we do observe a much stronger effect for conduit exposure. Conduit exposure itself\nactually leads to a contraction in lending in Germany. This finding likely results from the sudden\nrealization at the onset of the financial crisis that conduits \"could come crashing back on the banks'\nbalance sheets\" (actually optimal given potential reputational losses in, e.g. Segura (2014)), and\nbanks taking appropriate action in terms of lending in Germany.\nThe estimated coefficient of -0.00171*** in Model 4 implies that a bank with 1 billion in US\nconduits is estimated to contract its quarterly lending in Germany by 3.5 percentage points more\nthan banks without conduits in place. The double and triple interactions point to the same direction\nwith magnitudes of three to five times higher than previously estimated. For instance, in the final\nmodel, the coefficient for the triple interaction of 8.19237* implies that, following a decrease by 5\nindex points in US home prices, a bank with a 1 billion exposure to conduits is estimated to con-\ntract its quarterly lending in Germany to riskier firms by an additional 8.3 percentage points more\nthan a bank with no such exposure. Finally, in Model 5 we include all three exposures at once and\nfind the results are mostly confirmed.\n5 Conclusion\nMotivated by the seminal works of Peek and Rosengren (1997) and Peek and Rosengren (2000),\nwe study the international transmission of shocks through the German banking sector during the re-\ncent turmoil. In particular, using unique German bank exposure data, we investigate how exposures\nto the US real estate market influenced domestic lending in Germany. We are interested in total\nbank exposure to the US real estate market and its three salient components: direct exposures to the\nUS real estate sector and to the subprime lenders in the US, and indirect exposure as liquidity pro-\nvided to ABCP conduits.\nConfirming previous studies on the transmission of shocks, we first document the overall con-\ntraction in lending in Germany following the home price shock. Our main aim is, however, to ex-\nplore the heterogeneity in the contraction across banks and firms. In other words, we investigate\nwhether differences in bank exposures to the US determine domestic lending in Germany when\nhome prices started to decline in the US, and whether there is a `flight to quality' in lending for\nthose banks that were more exposed to the US real estate market.\nWe indeed find that banks with higher total exposure to the US real estate market and, in par-\nticular, with higher exposure to the US real estate sector and to conduits contract their lending to\nGerman firms more following a decrease in US home prices than banks with no such exposure.\nMoreover, these banks also prefer lending to industry\u00adregion combinations with lower insolvency\nratios, especially following a decrease in US home prices. To sum up, we mainly document that\npossible losses abroad shift bank lending at home whereas the size of the effect depends on the type\nand the degree of exposure the bank has.\n6 References\nAcharya, V.V., Afonso, G., Kovner, A., 2013.
