To date, surgery, radiation therapy,\nchemotherapy, targeted therapy, and/or immunotherapy are\nused to treat cancers. Immunotherapy that promotes tumor\neradication through activating innate and adaptive immune\nresponses, including nonspecific stimulators, cytokines, mono-\nclonal antibodies, radiolabeled antibodies, immunotoxins, and\ncell-based therapy, is still a relatively new and promising\nmethod in cancer treatments.2 During the tumor development\nprocess, tumor cells may escape immune surveillance, imply-\ning that the restoration of the immune surveillance ability in\nthe host may improve cancer treatments.3,4 Accumulative clini-\ncal results have indicated that immune-based therapies may\nplay a role in the treatment of patients with prostate and other\nmalignancies.5\nAmong cancer immunotherapy investigators, the grow-\ning interest over the past 2 decades in controlling the\nimmune system to get rid of cancer has heightened character-\nization of cytokines to exploit their vast signaling networks to\ndevelop cancer treatments.6 Modulating cytokine secretion\nprofiles by immune cells using active immunomodulatory\n1National Chung Hsing University, Taiwan, Republic of China\nCorresponding Author:\nJin-Yuarn Lin, Department of Food Science and Biotechnology, National\nRepublic of China.\nEmail: jinlin@nchu.edu.tw\nImmune Cell\u00adConditioned Media\nSuppress Prostate Cancer PC-3 Cell\nGrowth Correlating With Decreased\nProinflammatory/Anti-inflammatory\nCytokine Ratios in the Media Using 5\nSelected Crude Polysaccharides\nHsiao-Chien Lin, MS1 and Jin-Yuarn Lin, PhD1\n Keywords\nhuman prostate cancer PC-3 cells, macrophages, polysaccharides, splenocytes, tumor immunotherapy\ncomponents may be a smart and effective strategy to treat\ncancer via changing the tumor microenvironment in the\nhost. The growing evidence indicates that diets rich in veg-\netables and fruits reduce the risk of numerous chronic dis-\neases, including cancer. In addition, different fruits and\ndifferent parts of one fruit could be used in different ways\nfor the prevention and treatment of different cancers.7 The\ncombination of immunotherapy and plant-derived effective\ncomponents may provide a chance to treat prostate cancer.\nAmong active immunomodulatory components, particu-\nlar polysaccharides are recognized as biological response\nmodifiers and may enhance the immune surveillance of\ntumor cells. Recently, PS-F2, a polysaccharide purified\nfrom Ganoderma formosanum, was shown to exert signifi-\ncant antitumor activity via its immunological competence\nto the host but not direct cytotoxicity to the tumor cells.\nBoth cellular and humoral immune responses in the host\ncontributed to PS-F2\u00adinduced tumor rejection, and PS-F2\ncan function as a vaccine adjuvant to stimulate the produc-\ntion of antigen-specific antibodies.8 Particular polysaccha-\nrides may exist in other different sources. Food materials\nsuch as grains and fruit seeds that are rich in polysaccha-\nrides deserve to be further studied for their anti\u00adprostate\ncancer potential.\nCurative therapies for advanced or recurrent forms of\nprostate cancer are still absent, mandating continued devel-\nopment of novel, more effective treatment regimens.\nRecently, natural ingredients have been found to have vast\npotential for treating cancer, with potentially fewer side\neffects than most of today's cancer therapies. Five selected\npolysaccharides from guava seed, common buckwheat, bit-\nter buckwheat, red Formosa lambsquarters, and yellow\nFormosa lambsquarters cultivated in Taiwan were found to\nhave diverse immunomodulatory potential. However, the\neffects of these selected polysaccharides on human prostate\ncancer PC-3 cells remain unclear. To unravel the puzzle,\nthese 5 polysaccharides were isolated to treat PC-3 cells via\ndirect action or tumor immunotherapy. Splenocyte- and\nmacrophage-conditioned media (SCM and MCM) were\nprepared using selected polysaccharides and further col-\nlected to treat PC-3 cells. The relationship between PC-3\ncell growth and Th1/Th2 cytokine secretion profile in their\ncorresponding SCM as well as proinflammatory/anti-\ninflammatory cytokine secretion profile in their correspond-\ning MCM were delineated.\nMaterials and Methods\nIsolation of 5 Selected Polysaccharides\nTo isolate polysaccharides, seeds of fresh guava (Psidium\nguajava Linn) fruit were first carefully collected and then\nair dried at 40\u00b0C overnight for use. The air-dried seeds of\nguava, common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), bitter\nbuckwheat (Fagopyrum leptopodum), red Formosa lambs-\nquarters (Chenopodium formosanum), and yellow Formosa\nlambsquarters (Chenopodium formosanum) were individu-\nally ground to powder using a grinding machine and then\npassed through a 60-mesh sieve. To avoid disturbance in the\nsubsequent polysaccharide extraction procedure, the lipids\nin the powder samples were removed using n-hexane (1:4,\nweight/volume). The mixtures were shaken at room tem-\nperature for 4 hours. After settling, the liquid phase contain-\ning n-hexane and oil was removed. The remaining solid\nsample was air dried at room temperature to evaporate the\ntrace hexane. The de-fatted powder samples were stored at\nTo extract polysaccharides, aliquots of de-fatted powder\nof guava seed, common buckwheat, bitter buckwheat, red\nFormosa lambsquarters, and yellow Formosa lambsquarters\nwere added to 5 to 10 volumes of deionized water and\nshaken at room temperature for 4 hours. The resultant mix-\ntemperature. The supernatant was collected, measured, and\nvolumetrically added with 3 volumes of 95% ethyl alcohol.\nThe mixtures were slowly shaken at 4\u00b0C for 12 hours to\nprecipitate the polysaccharides and centrifuged at 5000 \u00d7g\nfor 30 minutes at room temperature to separate the insoluble\npolysaccharides from the supernatant. The insoluble poly-\nsaccharide pellet was collected to evaporate any trace ethyl\nalcohol. The polysaccharide pellet was lyophilized and\nstored at -30\u00b0C until use. Five isolated polysaccharides,\nincluding guava seed polysaccharides (GSPS), common\nbuckwheat polysaccharides (CBPS), bitter buckwheat poly-\nsaccharides (BBPS), red Formosa lambsquarters polysac-\ncharides (RFLPS), and yellow Formosa lambsquarters\npolysaccharides (YFLPS) were obtained for the following\nexperiments. All 5 isolated polysaccharides have been par-\ntially characterized. All 5 isolated polysaccharide fractions\nprotein contents in these isolated polysaccharides indicated\nthat the isolated polysaccharides were proteopolysaccha-\nrides or glycoproteins. Generally, crude polysaccharides\nwere contaminated by coextracted proteins. Unfortunately,\nthe step to remove proteins in the purification procedure\nwas skipped in this study, although the removal of proteins\nmay also discard particular proteopolysaccharides or glyco-\nproteins in the crude polysaccharides. Among these isolated\npolysaccharides, GSPS presented the highest sugar content\n(60.7%), whereas BBPS had the highest protein content\n(85.6%). Five isolated polysaccharides were further puri-\nfied and identified using Sepharose 6B gel filtration col-\numn. Each isolated polysaccharide separated into 2 to 3\nsubfractions. The molecular weight (MW) of each subfrac-\ntion was calibrated with a standard compound (blue dex-\ntran, MW = 2000 kDa, Sigma\u00adAldrich Co, MO) or protein\nDa, Sigma, MO) using the Sepharose 6B gel filtration col-\numn. MWs of guava seed polysaccharide subfraction 1\n(coded as GSF1), GSF2, and GSF3 in GSPS were distrib-\nbuckwheat polysaccharide subfraction 1 (coded as CBF1),\ncharide subfraction 1 (coded as BBF1), BBF2, and BBF3 in\n13 kDa; red Formosa lambsquarters polysaccharide sub-\nfraction 1 (coded as RFLF1) and RFLF2 in RFLPS were\nlambsquarters polysaccharide subfraction 1 (coded as\nkDa and 9.4 kDa, respectively.\nPolysaccharides have highly complex structures and\nspecies specificity. In generalized definition, polysaccha-\nrides may include simple polysaccharides, glycoproteins,\nand proteopolysaccharides. In general, polysaccharides are\nsoluble in water but insoluble in alcohol. However, the seed\nsamples are rich in starch, which is highly soluble in hot\nwater but insoluble in cold water. Hot water may extract a\ngreat deal of starch from the samples and destroy active\ningredients. Therefore, a standard protocol with a slight\nmodification was used to extract the polysaccharides. The\nsamples were extracted using cold water (room tempera-\nture) rather than hot water (70\u00b0C-100\u00b0C) in this study.\nBecause all 5 isolated polysaccharides contain sugar and\nproteins, they may be glycoproteins or mixtures of polysac-\ncharides and proteins. Because the characteristics of 5 iso-\nlated polysaccharides consisting of sugars and proteins\nhave not been fully determined, they can be called crude\npolysaccharides according to the generalized definition.\nIsolation of Primary Immune Cells\nFemale BALB/cByJNarl mice (8 weeks old) were pur-\nchased from the National Applied Research Laboratories,\nMinistry of Science and Technology in Taipei, Taiwan,\nROC. The experimental mice were maintained in the\nDepartment of Food Science and Biotechnology at National\nChung Hsing University, College ofAgriculture and Natural\nResources in Taichung, Taiwan, ROC. The animals were\nprovided chow diet (laboratory standard diet) and water ad\nlibitum. All mice were housed in stainless steel cages and\nkept at a controlled temperature (23\u00b0C \u00b1 2\u00b0C) and ambient\ndark-light cycle. After acclimation for 2 weeks, the experi-\nmental mice were killed humanely for isolating primary\nimmune cells, including splenocytes and peritoneal macro-\nphages. The animal use protocol listed in this study was\nreviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal care and\nUse Committee (IACUC Approval No: 101-95R), National\nChung Hsing University, Taiwan, ROC.\nThe protocol was performed as described previously.9-11\nBriefly, the experimental mice (10 weeks old) were anes-\nthetized with diethyl ether and immediately bled using\nretro-orbital venous plexus puncture to collect blood.\nImmediately after blood collection, the animals were killed\nhumanely using CO\ninhalation. Peritoneal macrophages\nwere prepared by lavaging the peritoneal cavity with 2 ali-\nquots of 5-mL sterile Hank's balanced salts solution\n(HBSS)--50 mL of 10\u00d7 HBSS (Hyclone Laboratories Inc,\nSouth Logan, UT), 2.5 mL of antibiotic-antimycotic solu-\ncillin, 10 mg streptomycin, and 25 \u00b5g amphotericin B per\nmL in 0.85% saline; Atlanta Biologicals Inc, Norcross,\nGA), 20 mL of 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich\nCo, St Louis, MO) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137\nHPO\nKH\nPO\n(Wako, Osaka, Japan), 425 mL sterile water--for a total of\n10 mL through the peritoneum. The peritoneal lavage fluid\npellets were collected and resuspended in tissue culture\nmedium (TCM; a serum replacement, Celox Laboratories\nInc, Lake Zurich, IL), suspended in a medium consisting of\n1640 medium (Atlanta Biologicals Inc, Norcross, GA), and\n2.5 mL of antibiotic-antimycotic solution (100\u00d7 PSA). The\nperitoneal adherent cells (>90% of macrophages) from each\nanimal were adjusted to 2 \u00d7 106 cells/mL in TCM medium\nwith a hemocytometer, using the trypan blue dye exclusion\nmethod.9 Isolated mouse primary peritoneal macrophages\nwere used for subsequent experiments.\nImmediately after the peritoneal cavity of the experi-\nmental mice was lavaged for preparing peritoneal macro-\nphages, the spleen was aseptically removed from the\nexperimental mice and homogenized in TCM medium.\nSingle splenocytes were collected and treated with red\nblood cell (RBC) lysis buffer (0.017 M Trizma base [Sigma-\nAldrich Co], 0.144 M ammonium chloride [Sigma-Aldrich\nCo], pH 7.4, 0.20 \u00b5m filtered) to lyse the RBCs. Splenocytes\nisolated from each animal were adjusted to a concentration\nof 1 \u00d7 107 cells/mL in TCM medium with a hemocytometer,\nusing the trypan blue dye for subsequent experiments.10,11\nPreparation of SCM and MCM in the Absence\nor Presence of the 5 Selected Polysaccharides\nTo achieve noncytotoxic optimal concentrations of 5\nselected polysaccharide fractions, the cell viabilities of\nmacrophages treated with individual polysaccharides at\ndifferent concentrations were determined using 3-(4,5-\ndimethylthiazol-2-diphenyl)-2,5-tetrazoliumbromide\n(MTT, Sigma, MO) assay. All polysaccharide stock solu-\ntions were aseptically diluted into working solutions using\nTCM medium before use. The splenocytes or macrophages\n(50 \u00b5L/well) in the absence or presence of polysaccharides\n(50 \u00b5L/well) at the indicated final concentrations of 0, 1.6,\nincubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO\nand 95% air for 72 and 48 hours, respectively. The cell via-\nbility was determined using MTT assay. GSPS, CBPS,\nBBPS, RFLPS, and YFLPS at the same concentrations of\ndoses for primary immune cells (data not shown); thus,\nmL were selected to treat PC-3 cancer cells through direct\naction or tumor immunotherapy via preparing immune cell\u00ad\nconditioned media (CMs).\nTo prepare an immune cell CM, isolated splenocytes (1\n\u00d7 107 cells/mL TCM medium, 0.5 mL/well) or peritoneal\nwell) were cocultured with GSPS, CBPS, BBPS, RFLPS,\nand YFLPS at the indicated noncytotoxic concentrations of\n24-well plates, respectively. The plates were incubated at\n37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO\nfor 48 hours. The cultured plate was centrifuged at 400 \u00d7g\nfor 10 minutes to collect the supernatant (ca 1.0 mL/well) in\nthe cell cultures--namely, SCM or MCM. The supernatant\nof immune cell cultures was collected and lyophilized. The\nlyophilized SCM or MCM was dissolved in 0.5 mL F-12K\nmedium: F12 Kaighn's modification medium supplemented\nwith 7% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/mL), strep-\nThe 2-fold concentrated CM was stored at -80\u00b0C until use.\nAdditionally, to clarify the relationship between cytokine\nsecretion profiles by immune cells and PC-3 cell viability,\nlevels of Th1 (interleukin [IL]-2) and Th2 (IL-10) cytokines\nin SCM, and proinflammatory (IL-1, IL-6, and tumor\nnecrosis factor [TNF]-) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10)\ncytokines in MCM were measured using a sandwich ELISA\naccording to the cytokine ELISA protocol from the manu-\nfacturer's instructions (mouse DuoSet ELISA Development\nsystem, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).12\nEffects of the 5 Selected Polysaccharides on the\nGrowth of Human Prostate Cancer PC-3 Cells\nThe human prostate cancer PC-3 cell line was purchased\nfrom Bioresource Collection and Research Center (Food\nIndustry Research and Development Institute, Hsinchu,\nTaiwan, ROC). The PC-3 cells were maintained in F-12K\nmedium at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 95% air and\n. After they had grown to 90% confluence in a 75T\ntissue culture flask (TPP Biochrom AG, Trasadingen,\nSwitzerland), the PC-3 cells were plated at a density of 2 \u00d7 105\ncells/mL in 96-well plates to perform the following bioassay.\nTo evaluate the direct action of 5 isolated polysaccha-\n\u00b5L/well) were treated with GSPS, CBPS, BBPS, RFLPS, and\nYFLPS (50 \u00b5L/well) at the indicated final concentrations of 0,\n(as a positive control) at 2.5 \u00b5 for 24 and 48 hours, respec-\ntively. The cell viability of PC-3 cells was determined using\nMTT assay.After incubation, aliquots of 10 \u00b5Lof MTT (5 mg/\nmL in PBS) were added to each well in the 96-well plate. The\nplates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with\nand 95% air for another 4 hours. The plates were cen-\ntrifuged at 400 \u00d7g for 10 minutes, and the culture supernatant\nwas carefully discarded. The cell pellet was carefully washed\nwith PBS buffer twice. Aliquots of 100 \u00b5L dimethyl sulfoxide\nwere added to each well and oscillated for 30 minutes to lyse\ncell membrane to extract formed insoluble formazan in mito-\nchondria. The absorbance (A) was measured at 550 nm on a\nplate reader (ELISA reader, ASYS Hitech, GmbH, Austria).\nThe cell viability was expressed as the relative percentage\ncompared with the mean absorbency of the control. The cell\nviability percentage in each biological determination was cal-\nculated using the following equation: Cell viability (percent-\nage of control) = [(Asample\n- A\nblank\n)/(A\ncontrol\n- A\nblank\nTo evaluate the effects of cytokine immunotherapy on\nwere treated with SCM (50 \u00b5L/well) or MCM (50 \u00b5L/well)\nas well as paclitaxel (as a positive control) at 2.5 \u00b5, respec-\ntively, for 24 and 48 hours. To evaluate the possible interfer-\nence of different media used in the cell line (F-12K medium)\nand primary cells (TCM medium), PC-3 cells cultured in\nTCM medium alone were also selected as a negative control.\nThe remaining survival cells were measured using MTT\nassay. PC-3 cells cultured in F-12K medium alone (a nega-\ntive control) were selected as a control to calculate the\neffects of SCM or MCM treatments. The cell viability (%) in\neach biological determination was calculated using the fol-\nlowing equation: Cell viability (percentage of control) =\n[(A\nsample\n- A\nblank\n)/(A\n- A\nblank\nStatistical Analysis\nResults are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD. Differences\nbetween means were compared using 1-way ANOVA, fol-\nlowed by Duncan's multiple range test using the SPSS sys-\ntem 19.0. The association between cytokine levels in CM\nand the viabilities of PC-3 cells was described as the Pearson\nproduct-moment correlation coefficient (r). P values <.05\nwere considered significant.\nResults and Discussion\nDirect Action of the 5 Selected Polysaccharides\non PC-3 Cell Growth\nIn our previous study, administration of GSPS, CBPS,\nBBPS, RFLPS, or YFLPS at the indicated concentrations of\nprimary immune cells. To evaluate direct action of 5\nselected polysaccharides on PC-3 cell growth, the 5 isolated\npolysaccharides at the indicated concentrations of 1.6, 8,\nhours, respectively. Paclitaxel administration at 2.5 \u00b5M was\nselected as a positive control. The results showed that\nadministration of GSPS, BBPS, CBPS, RFLPS, and YFLPS\nat the indicated concentrations could not significantly (P >\n.05) inhibit the PC-3 cell viability as compared with that of\nthe control (Figure 1). Contrary to our anticipation, direct\nadministrations with 5 selected polysaccharides, particu-\nlarly CBPS and BBPS, slightly increased PC-3 cell viabili-\nties. Polysaccharides such as -glucans were found to have\ncytoprotective and genoprotective effects on lymphocytes.13\nTherefore, an indirect action of polysaccharides to treat\ntumor cells through immunotherapy shows a promising\npathway. We assumed that direct administration of certain\npolysaccharides might enhance the growth of PC-3 cancer\ncells via stimulating particular receptors on the cancer cells\nin vitro. However, it remains to be further studied.\nImportantly, paclitaxel administration at 2.5 \u00b5M signifi-\ncantly (P < .05) decreased the PC-3 cell viability, indicating\nthat paclitaxel may be applied to the treatment of PC-3 can-\ncer cells via direct action to the cancer cells (Figure 1).\nEffects of SCM or MCM on PC-3 Cell Growth\nTo evaluate the effect of cytokine immunotherapy using\nimmune cell CMs in the absence or presence of 5 polysac-\ncharides on PC-3 cell growth, PC-3 cells were treated with\nSCM or MCM for 24 or 48 hours, respectively. PC-3 cells\nselected as a control to calculate the cell viability. The\nresults showed that there are no significant differences of\nPC-3 cell viabilities between F-12 K medium and TCM\nmedium alone. Identically, paclitaxel (a positive control) at\n2.5 \u00b5M significantly inhibited (P < .05) PC-3 cell growth\neither through 24 or 48 hours of incubation compared with\nthe negative controls (Figure 2). Importantly, SCM treat-\nments significantly (P < .05) inhibited PC-3 cell viability\neither through 24 or 48 hours of incubation as compared\nwith the negative controls. However, SCM cultured with\ndifferent concentrations of the 5 polysaccharides did not\nshow enhanced, but rather slightly decreased, inhibitory\neffects on the viabilities of PC-3 cells relative to those cul-\ntured without the 5 polysaccharides. Because these 5 poly-\nsaccharides were not removed from the SCM, the remaining\npolysaccharides in the SCM might slightly increase the\ngrowth of PC-3 cells via direct action (Figure 1). Most\nimportant, SCM cultured without the 5 polysaccharides\nexhibited a better inhibitory effect on PC-3 cell viability\nthan paclitaxel administration at 2.5 \u00b5M either through 24\nor 48 hours of incubation (Figure 2). Our results indicate\nthat treatments of PC-3 cancer cells through tumor immu-\nnotherapy using splenocytes might have the better inhibi-\ntory effect than that of chemotherapy using paclitaxel\n(Figure 2).\nFigure 3 shows the effects of MCM treatments on the\ngrowth of PC-3 cells. The results showed that MCM treat-\nment significantly (P < .05) inhibited PC-3 cell viability\neither through 24 or 48 hours of incubation as compared\nwith the negative controls (Figure 3). Importantly, MCM\ncultured with different concentrations of the 5 polysaccha-\nrides, particularly GSPS, CBPS, and YFLPS, showed\nslightly and dose-dependently, although not significantly (P\n> .05), enhanced inhibitory effects on the viabilities of PC-3\ncells relative to those cultured without the 5 polysaccha-\nrides (Figure 3). Because these 5 polysaccharides were not\nremoved from MCM, the remaining polysaccharides in\nMCM might slightly increase the growth of PC-3 cells via\ndirect action (Figure 1), interfering with the net effect of\nMCM. In addition, MCM cultured without the 5 polysac-\ncharides exhibited a better inhibitory effect on PC-3 cell\nviability than paclitaxel administration at 2.5 \u00b5M, particu-\nlarly through 48 hours of incubation (Figure 3). Our results\nindicate that treatments of PC-3 cancer cells through tumor\nimmunotherapy using immune cells might have better\ninhibitory effect than that of chemotherapy.\nIn comparison with the effects of SCM and MCM admin-\nistrations, both SCM and MCM presented inhibitory effects\non PC-3 cell viability, implying that immune cells, includ-\ning splenocytes and macrophages, might be involved in\nanticancer activities in vivo. We hypothesized that cyto-\nkines secreted by these immune cells are key contributors to\ninhibiting the growth of PC-3 cells through cytokine che-\nmotherapy. To clarify the puzzle, associations between\ncytokine secretion levels in the corresponding CM and via-\nbilities of PC-3 cells were further analyzed.\nAssociations Between Cytokine Secretion Levels\nin the CMs and Cell Viabilities of PC-3 Treated\nWith Their Corresponding CMs\nTo clarify the correlation between cytokine secretion levels\nand cancer cell survival, the relationship between cytokine\nlevels secreted by immune cells and viabilities of PC-3 cells\ntreated with CM cultured without or with the 5 selected\npolysaccharides were determined using Pearson's correla-\ntion coefficients (r). Figure 4 shows associations between\nthe viabilities of PC-3 cells treated with SCM for 24 or 48\nprofiles in their corresponding SCM. The results showed\nthat the viability of PC-3 cells through 24 or 48 hours of\nincubation did not significantly (P > .05) correlate with\n(Th2/Th1) secretion profiles by splenocytes, implying that\nthere was a weak correlation between the PC-3 cell viability\nFigure 1.

However, more Th1/Th2\ncytokines secreted in the SCM should be further analyzed to\nprovide stronger evidence.\nFigure 5 shows associations between viabilities of PC-3\nTNF- (proinflammatory cytokines), IL-10 (anti-inflamma-\ntory cytokine), or (IL-6 + TNF-)/IL-10 cytokine secretion\nprofiles in their corresponding MCM.

Unfortunately, the significant correlation disappeared\nafter 48 hours of incubation (Figure 5J), showing that the\ncytokine chemotherapy might just be effective for a short\nperiod, resulting from the short half-life of cytokines.\nCurrently, the prevalent choices for treating human can-\ncer are surgical resection, general chemotherapy, and radia-\ntion therapy.14 Recently, the ability of the immune system to\nfight cancer has been recognized and partially understood.\nTumor cells may be directly destroyed by immune cells,\nsuch as natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells in vivo.\nHowever, tumor cells may escape immune surveillance, so\nthat they cannot be killed in time.3,4 Tumor immunotherapy\nendeavors to promote tumor eradication through the activa-\ntion of innate and adaptive immune responses, including\nnonspecific stimulators, cytokines, monoclonal antibodies,\nradiolabeled antibodies, immunotoxins, and cell-based\ntherapy.2 Accumulative clinical results reported that\nimmune-based therapies may play a role in the treatment of\npatients with prostate and other malignancies.5 In the pres-\nent study, our results indicated that the PC-3 cell viability\ntreated with MCM through 24 hours of incubation signifi-\n(IL-6 + TNF-)/IL-10 (proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory)\ncytokine secretion ratios by macrophages, implying that\nincreasing anti-inflammatory cytokines but decreasing pro-\ninflammatory cytokines by macrophages might inhibit the\nPC-3 cell viability (Figure 5I). Furthermore, maintaining\nlow inflammation status in vivo may inhibit the growth of\nprostate cancer.Adopting dietary changes, such as a diet rich\nin antioxidant or anti-inflammatory components, to regulate\nthe immune system may promote anticancer properties. Our\nresults showed that MCM cultured with different concentra-\ntions of the 5 polysaccharides slightly and dose-dependently,\nalthough not significantly (P > .05), enhanced their inhibi-\ntory effects on the viabilities of PC-3 cells relative to those\ncultured without the 5 polysaccharides (Figure 3), indicat-\ning that these selected polysaccharides might increase anti-\ncancer abilities of immune cells, particularly macrophages\nbut not splenocytes (Figure 2), via their anti-inflammatory\npotential. However, the anticancer mechanism of these\nselected polysaccharides through tumor immunotherapy\nshould be further clarified.\nFucoidan, a polysaccharide from Undaria pinnatifida,\nwas found to induce the apoptosis of PC-3 human prostate\ncancer cells via the inactivation of the ERK1/2 MAPK sig-\nnaling pathway, cell cycle arrest, and downregulation of the\nWnt/-catenin signaling pathway.15 Polysaccharide frac-\ntions F1 and F2 from Cymbopogon citratus induce apopto-\nsis by reducing mitochondrial transmembrane potential and\nincreasing pro-(Bax) apoptotic gene expression in Siha and\nLNCap cells.16 Glycoproteins from Cyclocarya paliurus\nleaves inhibit the growth of human gastric cancer HeLa cells\nthrough keeping cell cycle arrest in the S phase, which may\nfurther induce apoptosis.17 However, direct administrations of\nGSPS, CBPS, BBPS, RFLPS, or YFLPS to PC-3 cells at the\nsignificantly (P > .05) inhibit the growth of PC-3 cells (Figure\n1), but MCM cultured with different concentrations of the 5\npolysaccharides did dose dependently enhance their inhibitory\neffects on the viabilities of PC-3 cells (Figure 3). It is suggested\nthat these selected polysaccharides might exert their anticancer\nabilities against PC-3 cells, via regulating particular immune\ncells suchasmacrophagestoincreaseanti-inflammatorycytokine\nproduction but decrease pro-inflammatory cytokine production in\nvivo (Figure 5I). The anticancer properties of polysaccharides\nhave been shown to be primarily mediated through 3 approaches:\n(1) direct cytotoxicity, (2) immunoenhancement, and (3) syner-\ngistic effects in combination treatment with conventional\nFigure 5. The associations between PC-3 cell viabilities treated with macrophage-conditioned media (MCM) for 24 and 48 hours,\nrespectively, and interleukin [IL]-1 (A, B), IL-6 (C, D), TNF- (E, F), IL-10 (G, H), and (IL-6 + TNF-)/IL-10 (I, J) cytokine secretion\nprofiles in corresponding MCM.\nFigure 5. (continued)\nanticancer drugs.18 Based on our results from these 5 iso-\nlated polysaccharides, we uncover another possible antican-\ncer property of polysaccharides--that is, to decrease secretion\nratios of proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines in a\ntumor microenvironment. After digestion of particular poly-\nsaccharides, certain immune cells in Peyer's patches in the\nsmall intestine may be regulated to secrete cytokines into the\nblood stream and constitute an immune environment in the\nbody. An anti-inflammatory immune environment in the body\nmay help inhibit the growth of human prostate cancers.\nIn the present study, we showed that SCM or MCM\ninhibited the growth of PC-3 cells, possibly via the pathway\nof cytokine immunotherapy (Figures 2, 3, and 5).\nMammalian models, such as the mouse, have been preemi-\nnent in modeling human diseases, primarily because of the\nstriking homology between mammalian genomes and the\nmany similarities in aspects spanning from anatomy to cell\nbiology and physiology.19 The overall structure of the\nimmune system in mice and humans is quite similar.20,21\nTherefore, mouse primary immune cell CMs were selected\nto treat PC-3 cells. SCM, that is, CM of splenocytes con-\nstatus of the adaptive immune system,22 whereas MCM,\nthat is, CM of macrophages containing higher than 90%\nmacrophages, could reflect the status of the innate immune\nsystem. Our results further demonstrated that B lympho-\ncytes, T lymphocytes, and macrophages might contribute to\nthe inhibition of PC-3 cell growth. However, characteriza-\ntions and anticancer mechanisms of the 5 selected polysac-\ncharides remain to be further studied in the future.\nAmong the 5 selected polysaccharides, GSPS, CBPS,\nand YFLPS had the better anticancer activity through tumor\nimmunotherapy (Figure 3). Guava (Psidium guajava)\nshows potential for the treatment of different diseases--for\nexample, it has anti-inflammatory, antidiarrheal,23\nantidiabetic,24 antihypertensive, antimicrobial,25 hepatopro-\nRecently, guava leaf hexane fraction was found to modulate\nboth PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 and MAPK signaling path-\nways, leading to apoptosis through downmodulating pro-\nteins that mediate tumor cell survival, proliferation,\nmetastasis, and angiogenesis in PC-3 cells.30 The present\nstudy is the first to report an anticancer property of guava\nseed polysaccharides through tumor immunotherapy.\nBuckwheat, a herbaceous plant that belongs to the\nPolygonaceae family, has been used for foods and tradi-\ntional medicine in Taiwan. Buckwheat proteins were\nreported to have anticancer activity.31 Buckwheat polysac-\ncharide has the potential to stimulate cytokine secretion by\nperipheral blood mononuclear cells and to induce leukemic\nTHP-1 cell differentiation by both direct and indirect\ntreatments.32 The present study is the first to investigate the\neffect of buckwheat polysaccharides on the growth of\nhuman prostate cancer cells via tumor immunotherapy.\nFormosa lambsquarters, which was found to have diverse\nimmunomodulatory potential, is an endemic species culti-\nvated in Taiwan. The present study is the first to probe into\nthe effect of Formosa lambsquarters polysaccharides on the\ngrowth of human prostate cancer cells via tumor immuno-\ntherapy. The application of particular polysaccharides using\ntumor immunotherapy to treat certain cancers may be prom-\nising and provide an alternative choice for curing cancers.\nThe major purpose of this study was to evaluate and com-\npare the immunomodulatory potential of different polysac-\ncharides and their effects on human prostate cancer PC-3\ncells to screen potent polysaccharides for the treatment of\nprostate cancer. The purified fractions of most potent poly-\nsaccharides will be further subjected to thorough study in\nthe future.\nConclusions\nIn the present study, GSPS, CBPS, BBPS, RFLPS, and\nYFLPS did not significantly inhibit PC-3 cell growth via\ndirect action. However, SCM or MCM cultured in the\nabsence or presence of the 5 selected polysaccharides sig-\nnificantly (P < .05) inhibited PC-3 cell growth. MCM cul-\ntured with 5 polysaccharides, particularly GSPS, CBPS,\nand YFLPS, dose dependently enhanced their inhibitory\neffects on the viabilities of PC-3 cells relative to those\ncultured without polysaccharides. There was a significant\n(P < .05) negative correlation between PC-3 cell viabili-\nties and (IL-6 + TNF-)/IL-10 level ratios in the corre-\nsponding MCM, implying that macrophages suppress\nPC-3 cell growth through decreasing secretion ratios of\nproinflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines in a tumor\nmicroenvironment.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nTaipei, Taiwan, ROC.\nReferences\n1.
