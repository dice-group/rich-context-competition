    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe distribution of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels can differ dramatically across diverse racial/ethnic populations. The extent to\nwhich genetic variation in LPA can explain these differences is not fully understood. To explore this, 19 LPA tagSNPs were\ngenotyped in 7,159 participants from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). NHANES III is\na diverse population-based survey with DNA samples linked to hundreds of quantitative traits, including serum Lp(a). Tests\nof association between LPA variants and transformed Lp(a) levels were performed across the three different NHANES\nsubpopulations (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans). At a significance threshold of\np,0.0001, 15 of the 19 SNPs tested were strongly associated with Lp(a) levels in at least one subpopulation, six in at least\ntwo subpopulations, and none in all three subpopulations. In non-Hispanic whites, three variants were associated with Lp(a)\nnon-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans, respectively. The additive effects of these associated alleles explained up to\n11% of the variance observed for Lp(a) levels in the different racial/ethnic populations. The findings reported here replicate\nprevious candidate gene and genome-wide association studies for Lp(a) levels in European-descent populations and extend\nthese findings to other populations. While we demonstrate that LPA is an important contributor to Lp(a) levels regardless of\nrace/ethnicity, the lack of generalization of associations across all subpopulations suggests that specific LPA variants may be\ncontributing to the observed Lp(a) between-population variance.\nCitation: Dumitrescu L, Glenn K, Brown-Gentry K, Shephard C, Wong M, et al.

The most\nnotable example of this discrepancy is observed between\npopulations of European- and African-decent. While the mean\nLp(a) level is two- to threefold higher in blacks relative to\nwhites[4,5], elevated plasma Lp(a) levels have been reported to be\nassociated with CAD in whites but have not been clearly\nThe epidemiology of Lp(a) in other US racial/ethnic popula-\ntions, such as Mexican Americans, is not as well documented and\noften inconsistent. For example, compared to non-Hispanic\nwhites, studies have shown Mexican Americans to have both\nhigher[11] and lower[12] mean Lp(a) levels. The underlying\ncause(s) for these between-population differences has not been fully\ndetermined; however, there is evidence for the role of multiple,\npopulation-specific alleles in LPA[13], the gene that encodes for\napolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)], which when bound to apolipoprotein B-\n100 and a low density lipoprotein (LDL)-like particle forms Lp(a).\nLp(a) levels not only vary dramatically across populations, they\nalso have a remarkable inter-individual variability that ranges\nfrom barely detectable to greater than 250 nmol/l[14]. This inter-\nindividual variability has a substantial genetic component. It has\nbeen determined that the apolipoprotein(a) gene is the major\ncontributor to Lp(a) levels, accounting for more than 90% of the\nvariance for that trait in European Americans[15].\nTwo types of genetic variants in LPA have been associated with\nLp(a) levels: variations in the number of copies of the kringle IV-2\nrepeat and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). It has been\nestimated that the kringle IV-2 repeat alone explains 61\u00ad69% of\nthe variability observed in Lp(a) levels in populations of European\nancestry[15,16]. In contrast, the kringle repeat appears to explain\nless of the variability (19\u00ad44%) in populations of African\nthe kringle IV-2 repeat polymorphism accounts for a large\npercentage of the variability of Lp(a) levels, the remaining variance\nhas yet to be explained.\nRecent studies have identified common SNPs in LPA as strongly\nassociated with Lp(a) levels, explaining up to 36% of the trait\nvariance in populations of European-descent[22\u00ad24]. While\nseveral studies have indicated certain SNPs are in substantial\nlinkage disequilibrium (LD) with the kringle IV-2 repeat\npolymorphism[22,23], evidence also exists that some SNPs are\nin relatively little LD with copy number variation in LPA [25] and\nmay be independent contributors to Lp(a) levels. A recent genome-\nwide association study performed in a Hutterite population with\nkringle IV-2 repeat polymorphism data identified a SNP\nassociated with Lp(a) levels independent of the kringle repeat,\nsupporting the assumption that some common SNPs in LPA are\nindependent of the kringle repeat polymorphisms (i.e., not in\nlinkage disequilibrium)[24].\nTo date, relatively few studies have examined associations\nbetween LPA common SNPs and Lp(a) levels across multiple,\ndiverse populations and no study has characterized the same panel\nof LPA common SNPs in populations of European-, African-, and\nMexican-descent. To better characterize this genotype-phenotype\nrelationship in more diverse populations, we have genotyped 19\nEuropean American and African American LPA tagSNPs in 7,159\nparticipants from the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III). NHANES III is a diverse,\npopulation-based cohort representing Americans of European-,\nAfrican-, and Mexican-descent[26]. We report the significant\nassociation of LPA SNPs and Lp(a) levels in this diverse cohort and\nestimate the proportion of Lp(a) variance explained by these\ngenetic variants.\nResults\nPopulation Characteristics\nCharacteristics of the NHANES III study participants are\nshown in Table 1. Genetic NHANES III included 2,631 non-\nAmericans. As expected[27], the mean Lp(a) level in non-Hispanic\ncompared to non-Hispanic whites and a three-fold increase\ncompared to Mexican Americans. Mexican Americans had\nsignificantly lower mean Lp(a) levels compared to whites\n(p,0.0001). Body mass index (BMI) was similar across all three\npopulations (p = 0.093). Demographic variables age and sex, along\nwith other blood lipid traits LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides,\ndiffered significantly (p,0.0001) across populations.\nTagSNP allele frequencies are presented in Supplementary\nTable S1, by population. We calculated the Pearson correlation\ncoefficient (r) between each of the three populations. Not\nsurprisingly[28,29], LPA allele frequencies observed in non-\nHispanic whites were highly correlated with allele frequencies\nobserved in Mexican Americans (r = 0.80). Also as expected[28\u00ad\n30], we observed weaker correlation between allele frequencies in\nnon-Hispanic blacks compared with non-Hispanic whites (r = 0.60)\nand Mexican Americans (r = 0.48). Furthermore, compared with\nnon-Hispanic whites, the proportion of SNPs that differed in allele\nfrequency by more than 60.10 was smaller in Mexican Americans\nWe also compared the allele frequencies of these LPA SNPs in\nNHANES III to those in HapMap[31,32] (Supplementary Table\nS2). Among the 12 LPA SNPs that overlapped this dataset and\nHapMap, we observed extremely high correlations (r$0.99) in\nallele frequencies between non-Hispanic whites and HapMap\nCEU (US individuals of northern and western European ancestry)\nand between non-Hispanic blacks and both HapMap YRI\n(Yoruba from West Africa) and ASW (individuals with African\nancestry from the Southwest USA). Mexican American allele\nfrequencies were also very similar (r = 0.93) to those of HapMap\nMEX (individuals with Mexican ancestry in Los Angeles,\nCalifornia). Because Mexican Americans are a historically\nadmixed population, a comparison with HapMap Asian popula-\ntions was performed. The correlation between NHANES Mexican\nAmericans and HapMap Han Chinese (HCB) and Japanese (JPT)\nHaplotype frequencies were inferred for the 19 tagSNPs in LPA\nby NHANES III subpopulation. We observed eight common\nhaplotypes (frequency .5%) in at least one subpopulation\n(Supplementary Table S3). While two haplotypes (#1 and #2)\nwere common across all three populations, the remaining\nhaplotypes were either common only to non-Hispanic blacks\n(#7 and #8), only non-Hispanic whites (#6), or shared between\nwhites and Mexican Americans (#3, #4, #5). As expected[33],\nthe majority of chromosomes from non-Hispanic whites (71.5%)\nand Mexican Americans (72.6%) were represented by common\nhaplotypes inferred from LPA tagSNPs. Only approximately half\nof the chromosomes from non-Hispanics blacks (55.7%) were\nrepresented by common haplotypes, and the remaining half are\nscattered across rare haplotypes.\nTable 1.

In contrast, the distribution of risk alleles was\nskewed to the left in non-Hispanic blacks and to the right in\nMexican Americans (Figure 2). The average number of risk alleles\nin non-Hispanic black participants was 17 out of 24 possible risk\nalleles (70.8%) while the average number in Mexican American\nOverall, non-Hispanic blacks had the largest genetic burden of all\nthree subpopulations defined by these alleles, with 99.0% percent\nof participants possessing greater than 50% of the possible risk\nalleles. This genetic burden is significantly greater than that\nlevels in participants with various proportions of risk alleles. As\nexpected, mean Lp(a) is higher in participants with a greater\nproportion of risk alleles, again reflecting the role that these\nvariants may play in contributing to both between- and within-\npopulation Lp(a) trait variation.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we identified several variants in the LPA gene that\nare strongly associated with Lp(a) levels in a diverse epidemiologic\nstudy. More specifically, three SNPs in non-Hispanic whites,\ntwelve SNPs in non-Hispanic blacks, and six SNPs in Mexican\nAmericans were strongly associated at p,0.0001. While no single\nLPA variant was significantly associated in all three racial/ethnic\ngroups, six SNPs were significantly associated in two subpopula-\ntions and the directions of effects were consistent.\nMost previously published studies characterizing the relation-\nship between Lp(a) and LPA have focused on the effects of the\nkringle IV-2 copy number polymorphism. More recently, a\ngenome-wide association study in Hutterites identified one SNP\nof kringle IV-2 copy number[24]. Subsequent studies have found\nthis variant to be independently associated with increased Lp(a)\nlevels in European Caucasians[22,23] and South Asians and\nChinese[23]. In our study, the same allele (G) was also strongly\nassociated with increased trait levels not only in non-Hispanic\nAmericans was much less robust (p = 0.02), but the effect trended\nin the same direction (b = 0.18). This intronic tagSNP is not in\nlinkage disequilibrium (LD) with any genotyped SNP (Supple-\nmentary Figure S1), nor with the kringle IV repeat[25]. As others\nor, due to the fact that it resides in a CRE-binding site, may play a\nrole in gene expression.\nIt is interesting to note that while we did replicate the\nnecessarily replicate the associations reported recently for\nassociated with Lp(a) levels in NHANES III at the significant\nthreshold of p,0.0001 (Table 2). Furthermore, while the direction\nof effect in non-Hispanic whites was consistent with that observed\nfor Europeans and Asians studied by Lanktree et al (taking into\naccount the coded allele), the direction of effect was opposite in the\nnon-Hispanic black and Mexican American subpopulations in\nin non-Hispanic whites (p = 0.2471) while it was strongly\nassociated in European and Asian populations in Lanktree et al.\nFinally, the data reported here are not consistent with the linkage\ndisequilibrium block[23] but the LD calculated in our non-\nHispanic white samples and in HapMap CEU suggests there is\nrespectively) between the two SNPs. It is possible that this\ndiscrepancy can be explained by unidentified population sub-\nstructure or by the use of different LD measures, but this is unclear\nfrom the literature and requires further investigation.\nAs alluded to above, the relationship between LPA tagSNPs and\nLp(a) levels may represent a direct (i.e. causal) or indirect (i.e.\nFigure 2. Distribution of LPA risk alleles in non-Hispanic whites,\nnon-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans. Plots showing the\nfrequency distributions of the proportion of risk alleles in the three\nNHANES III subpopulations. Proportion of risk alleles was calculated by\ndividing the total number of LPA risk alleles (i.e. the GRS, see Materials\nand Methods) by the total number of possible risk alleles in each\npopulation, multiplied by 100%. Mean Lp(a) values are also plotted for\neach corresponding proportion.\nLPA and Lp(a) in NHANES III\nproxy for true causal variant) relationship. The latter situation\nmost likely applies to the majority of SNPs genotyped in this study.\nOf the 19 LPA SNPs, 17 are located in introns, and the two\ntary Table S1) are not predicted to alter protein function using\nSIFT[34]. Additional studies are needed to determine if these\nvariants regulate LPA expression in vivo. However, since apo(a) is\npresent only in humans, Old World primates, and the hedgehog,\nresources for these studies are limited to transgenic mice and\nrabbits as models[35].\nIn an attempt to evaluate the joint effect of significantly\nassociated variants, a genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated.\nBased on this GRS, these variants together explained 7%, 9%, and\n11% of the variance in Lp(a) levels in non-Hispanic whites, non-\nHispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans, respectively. In\ncomparison to the effect attributed to the kringle repeat region\nthese SNPs is considerably small.\nThis study has several strengths and limitations. The greatest\nstrength is the use of a large and diverse population. While there\nhave been several studies of LPA SNPs and its association with\nLp(a) that have included both European and African descent\npopulations, no single study, to our knowledge, has also included\nMexican Americans genotyped for the same LPA SNPs. This latter\npoint cannot be under emphasized as the Hispanic or Latino\npopulation is the fastest growing minority population in the United\nStates yet remains relatively underrepresented in genetic associ-\nA limitation is that the method of measuring serum Lp(a) levels\nin NHANES III does not account for apo(a) isoform size. While\naccurate measurement of apo(a) isoform is ideal, the reliability of\nthe Lp(a) measurement used here has been adequately demon-\nstrated[26]. Furthermore, there is no generally accepted labora-\ntory procedure or national standardization program for Lp(a)\nmeasurement, which may help to explain the lack of general-\nizabilty across studies[14].\nA second major limitation is that NHANES III does not have\ndata on kringle repeat size for each participant. Several methods\nare used to measure kringle repeat size such as Southern blot[28]\nand quantitative PCR[40], neither of which can be used in\nNHANES III DNA samples given investigators are aliquoted\nlimited amounts of DNA from crude cell lysates. Without these\ndata, it is unclear if the associations between LPA SNPs and Lp(a)\nlevels reported here are independent of the KIV-2 copy number\nvariant, which has a well-established, large effect on Lp(a) levels.\nThe amount of linkage disequilibrium, or lack thereof, between\nthe KIV-2 region and other LPA variants is a controversial issue.\nPrevious studies have reported strong LD between the KIV-2\nadditional studies indicate the lack of strong LD[24,28]. More\nspecifically, the tagSNPs genotyped in this study had been selected\nfrom a previous study[28] that provided data on kringle IV-2\nrepeat size, and no strong LD (r2.0.80) was found for any of the\nSNPs tested[28]. However, there was moderate LD (r2 = 0.45 in\nEuropean American and r2 = 0.57 in African American samples)\nassociated with Lp(a) levels in any of the three subpopulations after\ncorrection for multiple testing (Table 2). Thus, the tagSNPs\ngenotyped here and significantly associated with Lp(a) levels after\ncorrection for multiple testing are not in high or moderate LD with\nspecific kringle repeat sizes examined in the original dataset\nreported by Crawford et al[28]. Further studies are needed in\nNHANES and other large datasets to characterize the full\nspectrum of LPA genetic variation and its impact on Lp(a) levels\nin diverse populations.\nAnother limitation of this study is that only approximately 30\u00ad\n35% of the LDSelect ``bins'' for European Americans and African\nAmericans are represented by tagSNPs as many LPA SNPs failed\nassay design or genotyping in NHANES III. And, tagSNPs\nselection was limited to common variation, leaving rarer variation\ngenetic variation in LPA and its association with Lp(a) levels in\nthese populations remains to be explored. Furthermore, tagSNPs\nwere not selected specifically for the Mexican American\nsubpopulation. At the time of tagSNPs selection, HapMap 3\nMexican American samples were not available at the time, and it\nwas unclear which populations should be used for tagSNPs\nselection to adequately represent this admixed population. It is\nimportant to note that, however, that while our tagSNPs selection\nprocess may have been biased for populations of European- and\nAfrican-descent, the allele frequencies observed in NHANES III\nMexican Americans were very similar to that of non-Hispanic\nwhites. Furthermore, our lack of Mexican American specific\ntagSNPs does not undermine the observation that there is an\nexcess of significant variants associated only in non-Hispanic\nblacks compared to non-Hispanic whites.\nBecause of these strengths, and despite these limitations, we\nhave taken an important step in understanding how LPA genetic\nvariants contribute to Lp(a) levels in a diverse population. One of\nthe major findings of our study was that there were notably more\nsignificant associations between Lp(a) and LPA SNPs in non-\nHispanic blacks compared to non-Hispanic whites and Mexican\nAmericans. Moreover, nearly half of these associations were\nexclusive to non-Hispanic blacks. Our results suggest that\nbetween-population differences in Lp(a) levels can be explained,\nin part, by multiple population-specific cis-acting variants in LPA.\nWhile the role of multiple trans-acting factors in Lp(a) trait\ndistribution has been disputed[44\u00ad46] and cannot be ruled out,\nour results reaffirm the need for more comprehensive studies of the\neffects of LPA variants in large, diverse populations.\nMaterials and Methods\nEthics Statement\nAll procedures were approved by the CDC Ethics Review\nBoard and written informed consent was obtained from all\nparticipants. This candidate gene association study was approved\nReview Board (IRB #23667; HSRC D committee). Because no\nidentifying information was accessed by the investigators, this\nstudy was considered exempt from Human Subjects by Vanderbilt\ncommittee).\nStudy Population\nAscertainment of the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III) and method of DNA collection\nhave been previously described[47\u00ad49] and so will only be briefly\ndescribed here. The National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurveys are cross-sectional surveys conducted by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC). NHANES III was conducted\nall the NHANES, NHANES III is a complex survey design that\nover-sampled minorities (non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Amer-\nLPA and Lp(a) in NHANES III\nicans), the young, and the elderly. All NHANES have interviews\nthat collect demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-\nrelated data. Also, all NHANES study participants undergo a\ndetailed medical examination at a central location known as the\nMobile Examination Center (MEC). The medical examination\nincludes the collection of physiological measurements by CDC\nmedical personnel and blood and urine samples for laboratory tests.\nBeginning with phase 2 of NHANES III, DNA samples were\ncollected from study participants aged 12 years and older.\nLaboratory Measures\nSerum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol were\nmeasured using standard enzymatic methods. LDL cholesterol was\ncalculated using the Friedewald equation, with missing values\nassigned for samples with triglyceride levels greater than 400 mg/\ndl. Serum Lp(a) levels were measured immunochemically by\nenzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) (Strategic Diagnos-\ntics, Newark, DE), which does not have cross reactivity with\nplasminogen or LDL and is non-sensitive to apo(a) size\nheterogeneity[26]. Quality control measures of the Lp(a) assay\nhave been described elsewhere and the reliability of this Lp(a)\nmeasurement has been adequately demonstrated [26].\nSNP Selection and Genotyping\nSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected from\nSeattleSNPs data on European Americans (n = 23) and African\nAmericans (n = 24) re-sequenced for SNP discovery as previously\ndescribed[25]. Briefly, tagSNPs were chosen for genotyping in\nboth populations separately using LDSelect[52] at minor allele\nfrequency (MAF) .5% and r2.0.80. At the time of tagSNPs\nselection (2006), LPA variation data was not available for Mexican\nAmericans or other Hispanic reference samples. Forty-nine SNPs\nwere considered for genotyping, 35 SNPs were targeted for\ngenotyping, and 20 were successfully genotyped. Genotyping was\nperformed using the Illumina GoldenGate assay (as part of a\ncustom 384 OPA) by the Center for Inherited Disease Research\n(CIDR) through the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute's\nResequencing and Genotyping Service. A display of the\nchromosomal locations of all 20 LPA SNPs, along with their\nrelative locations to the 59 untranslated region (represented by\nSupplementary Figure S2.\nGenotyping call rates and tests of Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium\nstratified by self-reported race/ethnicity were calculated for all\ngenotyped LPA SNPs (Supplementary Table S1). The average\nwas out of Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE; p,0.01) in all\nthree racial/ethnic groups and was therefore excluded from all\nbe out HWE in one subpopulation but were carried forward in the\nanalysis. In addition to these quality control metrics, we genotyped\nblinded duplicates as required by CDC, and all SNPs reported\nhere passed quality control metrics required by CDC. All genotype\ndata reported here were deposited into the NHANES III Genetic\ndatabase and are available for secondary analysis through CDC.\nStatistical Methods\nAnalyses were performed for each self-reported race/ethnicity\nseparately. Quality control measures were implemented in\nPLINK[53]. Tests of association were performed using SAS\nversion 9.1 and were limited to participants greater than 18 years\nof age who had non-missing Lp(a) levels regardless of fasting status.\nEach genetic variant was tested for association with ln(Lp(a)+1)\nlevels (a transformation that approximated normality) using linear\nregression assuming an additive genetic model. Analyses were\nperformed adjusted for age and sex, and results were plotted using\nSynthesis-View[54,55]. Data were accessed remotely from the\nCDC's Research Data Center (RDC) in Hyattsville, Maryland\nusing Analytic Data Research by Email (ANDRE). Statistical\nsignificance was defined as p,0.0001, which represents the\npopulations)]. Using STATA 10.1, the frequency of risk alleles was\ncompared between populations using Pearson's chi-squared test.\nPair-wise linkage disequilibrium (r2) was calculated using the\nGenome Variation Server provided by SeattleSNPs (http://gvs.gs.\nwashington.edu/GVS/). Haplotypes were inferred by SAS/\nGenetics using the expectation-maximization algorithm in each\nsubpopulation separately.\nTo account for selection and non-response biases, the National\nCenter for Health Statistics provides a weighting methodology,\nwhich has been described elsewhere[56]. We performed tests of\nassociation both unweighted (using SAS version 9.1) and weighted\n(using SUDAAN). The results did not differ appreciably; therefore,\nunweighted results are presented here and only select weighted\nresults are presented in Supplementary Table S4.\nGenetic Risk Score Calculation\nThe Genetic Risk Score (GRS) was calculated for every\nparticipant, respective to each population separately, using SNPs\nthat were associated with transformed Lp(a) levels at p,0.0001. We\nused a count method and assumed each SNP to be independently\nassociated with increased levels of Lp(a). Assuming an additive\ngenetic model for each SNP, a value of 2 was given to individuals\nwho were homozygous for the ``risk'' allele (i.e. the allele associated\nwith increased levels of transformed Lp(a) levels). Values of 1 and 0\nwere given to genotypes containing 1 or 0 copies of the risk allele,\nrespectively. The GRS was calculated summing the number of risk\nalleles at each locus. Participants with incomplete genotype data at\nany SNP used in the GRS were excluded from analysis. Linear\nregression, with continuous GRS as the independent variable, was\nused to evaluate the joint effects (R2) of associated genetic variants\nfor Lp(a) trait variation. A weighted GRS (WGRS) was also\ncalculated by multiplying each b-coefficient from adjusted tests of\nassociation by the number of risk alleles, and then summing the\nproducts. Compared to the GRS, the results of the WGRS do not\nappreciably differ (Supplementary Table S5); therefore, GRS was\nused for the main analyses in the paper.\nSupporting Information\nFigure S1 Pair-wise linkage disequilibrium (r2) calcu-\nlated for 19 LPA SNPs in non-Hispanic whites (A), non-\nHispanic blacks (B), and Mexican Americans (C) in\nFigure S2 Location of genotyped LPA SNPs relative to\nthe kringle repeat region and a SNP in the 59 untrans-\nlated region.

Chromosomal locations are based on\nLPA and Lp(a) in NHANES III\nTable S1 SNP location and genotyping quality control\nmetrics, stratified by race/ethnicity.\nTable S2 Frequency of LPA variants in HapMap\nsamples.\nTable S3 LPA common haplotypes and haplotype\nfrequencies. Only haplotypes with frequencies .5% in at least\none population are displayed. Alleles are ordered based on\nchromosomal location (59 to 39). Frequencies .5% are in bold.\nTable S4 Associations between LPA SNPs and Lp(a)\nlevels, weighted for selection and non-response biases.\nThe association of LPA SNPs with log transformed Lp(a) levels is\nshown by a regression coefficient (beta, b) and 95% confidence\ninterval (CI) for each SNP, adjusted for age and sex. Measures of\nvariance explained (R2) are provided for each SNP based on\nunadjusted regressions. Significant associations (P-value,0.0001)\nare in bold.\nTable S5 Additive effects of LPA alleles associated with\nincreased Lp(a) levels. The amount of variance explained (R2)\nin transformed Lp(a) levels by the Weighted Genetic Risk Score\n(WGRS) is displayed, along with the median WGRS score,\nWGRS interquartile range (IQR), regression coefficient (beta, b)\nand 95% confidence interval (CI) for each association.\n"
