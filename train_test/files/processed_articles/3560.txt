This mixed-methods study\nexplored how White and Asian American adolescents perceive parental expectations via parent\u00adchild interactions, and how\nsuch expectations relate to adolescents' self-reported sexual activities over time. Using gender-matched, in-depth interviews\nwith 28 White and Asian American adolescents, ages 17 to 19, we explored adolescents' perceptions of parental expectations\nabout when, how, and under what conditions adolescents should engage in sexual activity. Stronger conservative parental\nsexual expectations and disapproving parental attitudes were closely related to later sexual debut and fewer sexual partners.\nPerceived closeness determined the degree to which adolescents respected and incorporated their parents' beliefs, values,\nand sexual expectations. Future research should focus on developing family strategies to utilize the concept of perceived\nparental expectations.\n",

Promoting healthy\nsexual behaviors during adolescence is recognized as the\nmost cost-effective way to reduce risky behaviors and mini-\nmize the medical costs and health consequences of sexually\ntransmitted infections (STIs; Berlan & Holland-Hall, 2010;\nDi Noia & Schinke, 2008; Hendershot, Magnan, & Bryan,\n2010). Within the context of family ecology perspectives\n(Granic, 2006), parent\u00adchild interactions reflect an interper-\nsonal relationship of relatively long-term duration, with par-\nents and families representing a significant and generally\nstable influence in adolescents' lives. Studies (Chen,\nthat although peers' sexual behaviors play an important role\nin adolescents' decisions to initiate sexual intercourse, par-\nents are the primary source of information about sex, and\nmost importantly, that adolescents are influenced by their\nparents' attitudes and behaviors. Specifically, positive par-\nenting skills and close maternal relationships are signifi-\ncantly protective against adolescents' associations with\ndeviant peers and engagement in risky behaviors (Carroll et\nrole-modeling, parental monitoring, perceived connected-\nness, and general communication have been shown to be\npositively associated with less frequent sexual activities,\nlater sexual initiation, and fewer teenage pregnancies among\nadolescents (Koniak-Griffin, Lesser, Uman, & Nyamathi,\n2003). Ultimately, parental influence established via con-\nstant, prolonged interactions between parents and children is\nrecognized as the primary influence on adolescents' sexual\nattitudes and behaviors (Kao, Loveland-Cherry, & Guthrie,\nThe expectancy violation\u00adrealignment model (Collins &\nLuebker, 1994), derived from symbolic interactionism\n(Blumer, 1969), is frequently used to explain interactions\nthat occur throughout the parent\u00adchild relationship. The\nmodel posits that adolescents perceive parental expectancies\nabout behaviors through constant, dyadic parent\u00adchild inter-\nactions.

The conflict that\ncan result may lead to a subsequent realignment of the expec-\ntation, leading to a shift in behavior and/or the expectation by\nthe adolescent, parent, or both parties. This is a cyclical,\ncomplex process. As such, the perceived expectations\nderived from these interactions are not yet fully understood,\nparticularly when considered within the context of culture\nand family (Kao, Guthrie, & Loveland-Cherry, 2007; Kao et\nIn an effort to operationalize the concept of perceived\nparental expectations, this study seeks to understand how\nparents influence their adolescents' sexual attitudes and\nbehaviors. Thus far, models designed to generate protective\neffects via the utilization of family strengths are limited.\nSome studies have investigated the effects of parent\u00adchild\ncommunication on adolescents'risky behaviors (Hutchinson,\n(Guilamo-Ramos, Jaccard, Dittus, & Collins, 2008; Kao et\nHenderson, 2006). Ineffective parental communication is\noften attributed to delayed discussion, lack of in-depth dis-\ncussion (Fang & Schinke, 2013; Ryan, Franzetta, Manlove,\n& Holcombe, 2007), or inconsistent reports of discussion\nbetween parents and adolescent (McElhaney, Porter,\nThompson, & Allen, 2008; Villarruel, Loveland-Cherry, &\nRonis, 2010). Inconsistencies are especially notable across\ncultural or gender groups, where effects varied due to\nendorsed familial and/or parental values. For example, Chao\n(2000) noted that definitions of the term parenting varied\namong immigrant Chinese and European American parents.\nIn particular, immigrant Chinese mothers emphasized the\nconcept of socializing, or training, children to become\nresponsible citizens, a concept that overlaps with Baumrind's\n(1966) definition of authoritarian parenting, but does not\nalign entirely. Ultimately, Chao emphasized the significance\nof conceptualizing and measuring the role culture plays in\nparenting style and practices.\nFamily strengths and efficacies often reside in a family's\ntraditions, heritage, cultural and religious beliefs, and are\ntransmitted from one generation to another through parent\u00ad\nchild interactions (Bandura, Caprara, Barbaranelli, Regalia,\nSchwartz & Zamboanga, 2008). During adolescent develop-\nmental transitions, families reframe and redefine what their\nessential values are by establishing family boundaries--that\nis, by establishing which behaviors or actions are considered\nhealthy or safe (Kao et al., 2014; S. Y. Kim, Chen, Li, Huang,\nThese parental expectations may be communicated in a vari-\nety of ways, including via non-verbal or indirection commu-\nnication. Furthermore, patterns of parent\u00adchild interactions\nmay differ according to an adolescent's developmental stage,\nneeds, prior experience, and other factors such as gender,\nculture, and social orientation. Some gender differences are\nnoted in adolescents' dyadic relationships with their mothers\nUltimately, the style, depth, and effect of parent\u00adchild com-\nmunication may play an essential role in an adolescent's per-\nception of parental expectations (Kao et al., 2007; Kao et al.,\nto 17, adolescents were much less likely to have initiated\nsexual intercourse if parents taught their children refusal\nskills, communicated about family values, and set clear fam-\nSimply urging parents to talk with their youth about sex may\nthe breadth, depth, meaning, and repetition of sexual topics\nmay be essential (Martino, Elliott, Corona, Kanouse, &\nIndirect and non-verbal communication has been found to\nbe particularly significant among Asian American families\nsocietal and cultural norms about parenting styles and prac-\ntices may be different from that of the dominant Western cul-\nture. Asian American or other minority parents may be more\nlikely to employ indirect or non-verbal practices such as\nrole-modeling, monitoring, and disapproving attitudes. In\none mixed-methods study, J. L. Kim and Ward (2007)\nexplored perceptions of parental sexual communication pat-\nterns among 165 Asian American college students.\nParticipants reported that parents often used implicit, non-\nverbal ways to communicate sexual values. Male partici-\npants reported minimal paternal communication.\nOverall, there are limited studies available to understand\nhow Asian American adolescents' sexual behaviors are\nrelated to their perceived parental expectations. Sexuality\nand sexual health are often seen as taboo topics among Asian\nAmerican families (Kao et al., 2007). Fang, Barnes-Ceeney,\nand Schinke (2011) have suggested that Asian American\nadolescent girls face increasing health risks because they\nconfront developmental tasks and challenges associated with\nbridging two different cultures. Acculturation gaps between\nAsian parents and their adolescents, for example, might\ncompromise the effectiveness of parental sexual communi-\ncation. Furthermore, the misperception that Asian American\nyouth are a trouble-free \"model minority\" creates additional\nbarriers, harassment, and risks for healthy behaviors\n(Grunbaum, Lowery, Kann, & Pateman, 2000; Qin, Way, &\nRana, 2008). Research has found that while Asian American\nadolescents tend to delay sexual onset, once they become\nsexually active, their risk for STIs and HIV/AIDS is similar\nto that of adolescents from other racial/ethnic groups (Hahm,\nLahiff, & Barreto, 2006). Furthermore, while Asian\nAmericans account for only about 2% of the total number of\nHIV/AIDS cases in the United States, the number of HIV/\nAIDS diagnoses among this population has increased steadily\nin recent years, particularly for gay, bisexual, and otherAsian\nmen who have sex with men (Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention [CDC], 2013). This number may be underes-\ntimated, misidentified, or underreported; Asian Americans\nKao and Martyn 3\nscreen for HIV at lower rates, and AIDS diagnoses are often\nmade late in the course of disease (CDC, 2013).\nIn an effort to understand how adolescents' sexual behav-\niors are related to their perceived parental expectations as\nderived from parent\u00adchild interactions, this study explores\nthe role familial beliefs and values play in adolescent percep-\ntions of parental expectations, and how these perceptions of\nparental expectations relate to adolescents' self-reported\nsexual activities over time with a group of Asian American\nand White adolescents. White American adolescents serve as\nan excellent reference group for examination of Asian\nAmerican sexual behaviors. The literature has examined\nWhite adolescent sexual behavior (Aspy et al., 2007; Kao,\nReitman, Rhode, Hupp, & Altobello, 2002) with greater fre-\nquency than that of Asian American adolescents. Similar to\nAsian American adolescents, however, White adolescents\nare generally perceived and reported to engage in risky\nbehaviors at lower rates than other racial/ethnic groups, such\nas Hispanic and African American adolescents (CDC, 2013).\nInclusion of White adolescents also provided an opportunity\nto reference two populations with similar education levels\nTo operationalize the concept of perceived parental\nexpectations, it is necessary to consider adolescent perspec-\ntives about when and under what condition adolescents\nbelieve their parents might permit or expect them to have\nsex. Adolescent perception of parental sexual attitudes--\nhow upset an adolescent believes his or her parents would be\nif the adolescent was to have sex--should also be consid-\nered. This study explored three research questions:\nResearch Question 1: What are adolescents' perceptions\nof parental expectations for their sexual behaviors?\nResearch Question 2: How are parental expectations\nconstructed within the context of familial beliefs?\nResearch Question 3: What are the patterns of associa-\ntion between adolescents' perceptions of parental expec-\ntations and their self-reported sexual behaviors over time?\nMethod\nThis mixed-methods (Creswell, 2007; Plano Clark,\nHuddleston-Casas, Churchill, O'Neil Green, & Garrett,\n2008), cross-sectional study utilized semi-structured qualita-\ntive interviews and quantitative event history calendars, or\nEHCs (Martyn & Belli, 2002), to assess how adolescents'\nperceptions of interactions with their parents relate to per-\nceived parental expectations, and how such expectations\nrelate to their self-reported sexual behaviors over time.\nSample\nOur sample included 28 adolescents who self-identified as\neither White or Asian American. Adolescents of other racial/\nethnic backgrounds were excluded. We purposefully strati-\nfied our sample by ethnic background, age, and gender. The\nage criteria (ages 17-19) allowed us to assess adolescents'\npersonal activities over the prior 4 years, starting when they\nwere 13 to 15 years old. We included only adolescents who\nhad resided in the United States for 10 or more years, to\nensure that participants recalled experiences that occurred\nwhile living within the United States. Our sample included\n13 White, 13 Asian American, and 2 mixed-race (Asian and\nWhite) adolescents, with a mean age of 17.91 years (SD =\n0.82 years). Participants lived in suburban areas on the out-\nskirts of a major metropolitan area in the Midwest. Most ado-\nlescents resided with two parents and were from middle- to\nhigh-income families. Roughly, 40% of participants were\nenrolled in high school; 60% were enrolled in 2- or 4-year\ncolleges.\nRecruitment\nAll study procedures were reviewed and approved by the\nUniversity of Michigan Institutional Review Board. To\nmaintain consistency, two research assistants were trained\non study procedures, including interviewing, EHC assess-\nments, and human subject protocols, prior to conducting\nprescreening and interviews. During the prescreening pro-\ncess, research assistants provided prospective participants\nwith study information and their rights as study subjects,\nand conducted an eligibility interview. Potential partici-\npants below the age of 18 were informed of the need for\nparental consent. Parental consent was obtained via a con-\nsent letter mailed to the parents' home. To address poten-\ntial language barriers, translation services and/or in-person\nexplanations of the study were offered to potential partici-\npants and their parents. (Neither service was requested.)\nAll adolescents were fluent in English. Adolescents who\nwere 18 years and older provided informed consent prior\nto their interviews. Audio files, consent/assent documents,\nand keys linking participants' identity with their study\ninformation were stored in a locked cabinet within a locked\noffice. Transcripts were entered in a password-protected\ncomputer and were not linked to participants' identity.\nAliases were used throughout the analysis and reporting\nprocess.\nParticipants were recruited from southeast Michigan via\nflyers posted at local language schools, high schools, and\ncolleges/universities, via an online posting, and by using\nsnowball sampling techniques. The majority of participants\n(20 of 28) contacted us by email after seeing our flyers and/\nor online posting. Eight participants were referred by word-\nof-mouth (snowball sampling). During our 4-month recruit-\nment period, a total of 32 adolescents contacted us by email\nor phone to express interest in the study. Four adolescents\nwere unable to finalize an interview date due to scheduling,\nand eventually declined participation. Because of the time it\ntook to obtain parental consent, the 17-year-olds were the\n4 SAGE Open\nfinal group to complete interviews. Participants received a\nUS$30 incentive after interview completion.\nMeasures\nInterviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview\nguide (see Figure 1) and an EHC (see Figure 2). Participants\nalso completed a demographic sheet that assessed racial/eth-\nnic background, years of U.S. residency, gender, age, family\nincome, and parents' marital status. The interview guide was\nstructured with the intent to assess and understand patterns of\nparent\u00adchild interaction, with questions designed to explore\nparticipant perceptions of parental expectations/attitudes\nabout their future and their health behaviors. To relate ado-\nlescent perceptions to their actual health behaviors, we asked\nparticipants to report their extracurricular activities, per-\nceived parental relationship, and sexual activities over the\nprevious 4 years. Participants reported these data via the\nEHC, which was modeled after a calendar developed by\nMartyn and Belli (2002). Using reflection and autobio-\ngraphic memory, the EHC allowed participants to recall\nsexual activities (e.g., sexual debut, sexual partner/s, and\ncondom use), parental relationships, and perceived parental\nattitudes over a 4-year period, beginning when they were 13\nto 15 years of age. The interview guide and EHC were pre-\ntested with three adolescents: two were Asian American and\none was White. Modifications to the interview guide and\nEHC were made based on pretesting feedback to ensure that\nlanguage was appropriate for the identified age groups and\nthat the content had cultural relevance.\nInterview Procedure\nGender-matched, face-to-face interviews were conducted\nwith each participant. Two digital audio recorders were used\nto ensure accuracy of data collection. Research assistants\ntook field notes to record initial impressions and non-verbal\ncues. Interviews lasted roughly 1 hr. Participants first com-\npleted the demographic sheet. Using the interview guide,\ninterviewers explored adolescents' parental relationships,\ntheir perceived parental sexual attitudes, and their percep-\ntions of what their parents want for them (Figure 1, Questions\nMain questions Probing questions\nPlease describe your relationship with your mother/\nfather.\n\u00b7 \nHow much do you think your father/mother cares about you?

We extracted several EHC items (see Fig-\nure 1) to assess adolescents' perceived parental attitudes\ntoward sex, their relationship with their parents, and their\nsexual activities over the prior 4 years. To assess adolescents'\nperceptions of their relationships with their mothers, we\nsummarized reported maternal closeness (1 = distant, 4 =\nvery close) over the previous 4 years to represent their over-\nall maternal relationships. Similar procedures were applied\nto other EHC items to create variables representing adoles-\ncents' perceived paternal relationships, perceived parental\nsexual attitudes, and various sexual activities (abstinence sta-\ntus, age of sexual onset, total sexual partners, and frequency\nof condom use). To assess within-subject differences, we\nobtained the mean of each variable for each group by year.\nWe then examined and compared 4-year trends between each\ngroup and variable. In addition, bivariate correlations were\nperformed using SPSS 19 to determine relationships among\nvariables extracted from the EHCs (summed scores across 4\nyears). Two participants of mixed racial heritage (Asian and\nWhite) self-identified as Asian American and were therefore\nincluded in the Asian American group.\nQualitative data.Digital audio files were transcribed by a\ntrained research assistant and verified by a second research\nassistant prior to analysis. We used inductive content analy-\nsis (Elo & Kyng\u00e4s, 2008) and constant comparative analysis\n(Kurasaki, 2000; Morse, Barrett, Mayan, Olson, & Spiers,\nand field notes. Guided by symbolic interactionism (Blumer,\n1969), analysis focused on understanding how adolescents\nperceived the meaning of \"parental expectations about sex\"\nthrough the description of daily interactions with their par-\nents, and how these expectations related to decisions about\nsexual activity. We used concepts drawn from the expectancy\nviolation\u00adrealignment model (Collins & Luebker, 1994) to\nguide our understanding about the meaning and process of\nhow adolescents perceived, violated, and realigned parental\nexpectations about sex via daily interactions with their\nparents.\nTo create the codebook, three coders (i.e., the two research\nassistants and the principal investigator) annotated the text,\nsorted the annotation list, and labeled thematic categories. A\ntext sample was used to establish acceptable inter-coder reli-\nability for each codebook theme before conducting a com-\nparative analysis. NVivo 10 software was used to facilitate\nthe coding process and data analysis (e.g., crossing referenc-\ning). Specifically, EHC information regarding sexual debut\nand number of sexual partners was entered as attributes in\nNVivo 10 to assess the relationship between emerging\nthemes and adolescents' self-reported sexual behaviors. A\nsexually active adolescent was defined as an adolescent who\nhad had oral, anal, or vaginal sex. A non-sexually active ado-\nlescent was defined as an adolescent who had no sexual\nintercourse, although they may have reported kissing or\npetting.\nResults\nThis mixed-methods study used gender-matched, in-depth\ninterviews to explore how White and Asian American ado-\nlescents perceive parental expectations via parent\u00adchild\ninteractions, and how such expectations relate to self-\nreported sexual activities over time.\nQuantitative Results\nCompared with their White counterparts, Asian American\nadolescents in our sample were more likely to report being\nsexually abstinent (Levene's test, p = .002): 50% of Asian\nAmerican adolescents (n = 7) reported being sexually absti-\nnent, versus 14% of White adolescents (n = 2). Among sexu-\nally active adolescents, the mean age of sexual initiation was\nsimilar for both groups (AsianAmerican: 16.25 years; White:\n16.18 years). Male adolescents were more likely to be sexu-\nally experienced (p = .033) and to have more sex partners\nactive, versus 6 of the 14 females (43%). The mean age of\nsexual initiation was 16.5 years for females and 16 years for\nTable 1.

Adolescent perceptions of conservative parental\nattitudes and disapproving parental attitudes toward sex were\ntion, we examined patterns of association among these two\nvariables against adolescents' self-reported sexual activities\nacross the four time points. We noted that as the mean score\nof disapproving and conservative parental attitudes\ndecreased, the mean score of reported sexual activities and\nnumber of partners increased. In particular, there was an\nobvious association between perceived maternal disapprov-\ning attitudes and the number of sex partners.\nIn terms of perceived parental relationships reported in\nthe EHC, there was no significant difference between Asian\nand White American adolescents. There was no noticeable\ntrend in the relationship between perceived parental relation-\nships and reported sexual activities. In fact, closer maternal\nrelationships were associated with less disapproving parental\nsexually active (r = .344). Among adolescents who were\nsexually active, those who perceived a closer maternal rela-\ntionship reported later sexual onset (r = .418). Notably, dis-\napproving and conservative parental attitudes were closely\nrelated. Overall, our quantitative results show that adolescent\nperceptions of conservative and disapproving parental atti-\ntudes/expectations were protective against early sexual onset\nand multiple sex partners (see Table 2).\nQualitative Results\nFour themes emerged from our analysis relating to adoles-\ncents' perceptions of their parents' perspectives and attitudes\ntoward sex. Specifically, this included how adolescents\nlearned about, interpreted, and responded to their parents'\nexpectations.\nTheme 1: Expectations are culture-specific and value-laden.Per-\nceived parental sexual attitudes were closely associated with\nfamilies' cultural or religious beliefs. Concerns about disap-\npointing parents, for example, were significant for both\nAsian American and White adolescents, although the cul-\ntural/family values that shaped parental expectations were\ndifferent. Many Asian American adolescents reported paren-\ntal expectations relevant to their parents' native culture. One\nparticipant commented, \"Being an Asian . . . there are more\nexpectations of you\" (Anna, age 17, Asian American\nfemale).1 Every year Anna and her parents traveled to Tai-\nwan, her parents' native home, so that they could show her\nthe \"Asian ways of doing things.\" Sexuality development\nwas not a priority for her parents. Rather, they expected her\nto \"practice violin . . . get straight A's . . . go to Chinese\nschool\" and to avoid activities such as partying and dating.\nAnother participant stated,\nTable 2.

A majority of participants stated that their par-\nents would be more protective toward daughters, including\nstricter curfews, more rules, and increased monitoring.

Karen linked her family's reli-\ngious affiliation to her self-identification, personality traits,\nand sexual attitudes/behaviors: \"Like my parents, I'm Hindu\n. . . my religion has played a big role in pretty much every-\nthing I do.\" Another participant also noted that her parents,\nwho were Hindu, had overall expectations that were guided\nby their religion: \"I guess they showed me more of the ben-\nefits than the cons so it [Hinduism] just, it seemed the most,\nlike, right idea in my head and it's always just been that\nway.\" She explained that her behaviors were related to \"the\nway my parents raised me.\" For example, she did not wear\nshorts at home or in front of her father or brother. She\ndescribed her father's rules to be\n\"No drinking, no drugs, and no dating\" [and] \"Before you do\nanything, be like, `What would [my religious mentor] do?'\" . . .\n[My father] was right, and I figure, three-fourths of the rules\nwork, I mean I've dated but I've never had alcohol, I've never\nhad a cigarette, you know those are just things that I'm willing\nto give up for the sake of my heritage or my background. (Helen,\nage 19, Asian American female)\nFamily religious beliefs and activities also played an\nimportant role in how White adolescents perceived parental\nsexual expectations. One participant described his parents'\nattitudes as conservative, and specifically to not have sex\nuntil marriage. He believed that this expectation derived from\nthe ethics and morals of his family's Baptist religion. These\nbeliefs influenced his perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors:\nThe first time I had sex it was so scary. I guess, it's because of\nmy dad's [Christian] views on it, and . . . at a subconscious level\nI was disappointing my father even though it's not like he knew\nit. He still doesn't know about it. But, definitely what your\nparents think and tell you influences your actions whether you\nrealize it or not, they always do. (Paul, age 18, White male)\nHigh parental expectations were taxing on some of the\nadolescents. One participant felt guilty about not letting his\nfather know about his \"last two sex partners\" (Ben, age 19,\nWhite male). He was unable to meet his parents' high expec-\ntations of \"no sex until marriage\" and experienced role strain\nbecause of \"not wanting to let down my parents and . . . my\nchurch background. It was kind of a whole guilt things . . .\nsometimes keeping me up at night.\" Another participant dis-\ncussed her reaction to her mother's high expectation of \"no\nsex until marriage\":\nI don't want her to think any less of me, I don't want her to know\neverything about my relationships, but I do let her know that I'm\nsafe and, like, \"What I'm doing hopefully you can trust me.\" . .\n. It was so uncomfortable for me to talk to her because I was\nalways the goody-good child in the family, and she would\nalways say, \"Oh, I always thought that you would wait until\nmarriage to have sex.\" Me, like, \"Why do I have to have some\nexpectations?\" . . . so that . . . kind of hit home. (Jennifer, age 18,\nWhite female)\nCultural and religious background seemed to play an\nimportant role in when and under what conditions adoles-\ncents believed their parents would approve of them engag-\ning in sexual activity. Three subthemes emerged in regard\nto parental expectations for sexual timing: abstinence until\ncollege and/or age 18, abstinence until marriage, or accept-\nable as long as the adolescent practiced safe sex (see Table\n3). Asian American adolescents were more likely to\ndescribe their parents' sexual attitudes as \"conservative,\"\nwith the expectation that their youth abstain from sex until\nmarriage. White adolescents were more likely to describe\nparental attitudes about sexual timing as acceptable \"absti-\nnence until college\" or \"okay as long as they are being\nsafe.\"\nThree parental concerns about adolescent sexual activities\nemerged from the interviews (see Table 3). Many parents\nwarned that having sex would limit opportunities for future\nsuccess. Other adolescents reported that parents talked about\nunwanted consequences--specifically, contracting STIs or\nbecoming pregnant--to steer them away from sexual\nactivities.\nTheme 2:A trusting parent\u00adchild relationship is fundamental.A\nclose and trusting relationship factored significantly into\nhow adolescents perceived their parents' expectations. A\nclose, trusting, and supportive relationship influenced how\nwell adolescents respected their parents'cultural beliefs, val-\nues, and sexual expectations.\nKao and Martyn 9\nI trust her. She's not my best friend, she's my mother. She looks\nout for me on a level that a best friend cannot comprehend.\n(Helen, age 19, Asian American female)\n[My father and I] trusted each other a lot more [than my mother\nand I]. He knew that I was smart and that I wasn't gonna get\nmyself into too much trouble. (Betty, age 19, White female)\nI've had a girlfriend for the past 3 years . . . And, uh . . . [my\nparents] would joke like, \"Don't do anything stupid. If you get\nher pregnant, you know, her parents will come kill us.\" . . . I\nmean, actually, I really like how they went about, it to be honest.\n`Cause there's a lot of trust. I guess the only risk part was if I was\ngoing to do something that I would regret later. But, I assumed\nthat when they said \"Don't do anything stupid,\" I knew what\nthat meant and maybe once or twice they mentioned the word\npregnant maybe, but it's pretty much given. (Chris, age 19,\nAsian American male)\nAdolescents also viewed a close and trusting parental\nrelationship as a way to enable them to learn how to handle\nemotional needs in their sexuality development. One partici-\npant wished her parents would talk with her about how she\nwould \"feel\" in a sexual relationship. She described sex as a\nform of \"connection\" and said that her decision to have sex\nwas related to her need to connect emotionally with a male\npartner.\nBeing a female, we want to have that emotional connection way\nmore than guys, and so we're a little bit more desperate and then\nonce we find that someone we're a little bit more attached . . .\nthis is gonna be very improper, but that's the sucky part of being\na girl. (Jennifer, age 18, White female)\nSimilarly, one participant advised other parents to \"make\nsure that their adolescents are not emotionally torn too bad\"\n(Ben, age 19, White male). Another participant stated, \"If\n[parents] have an open and trusting relationship with your\nkids from the start, your effect on them will be a lot stronger\"\n(Linda, age 19, White female). One 19-year-old Asian\nAmerican participant, who had been sexually active since\nage 16, with three sexual partners, shared experiences relat-\ning to his sexuality development and observed that \"I've\nalways been emotionally detached as a teenager growing up\"\nand that \"having sexual relationships\" seemed to be a way to\n\"connect\" with others.\nTheme 3:Parents convey expectations in different ways.Adoles-\ncents learned about parents' sexual attitudes and expecta-\ntions via direct and/or non-direct communication. White\nadolescents tended to learn from their parents via conversa-\ntion, while Asian American adolescents tended to learn from\ntheir parents via non-verbal routes. White participants were\nmore likely to talk with their parents about personal or\nTable 3. Subthemes of Parental Sexual Expectations: Timing and Consequences.\nTiming Sample quotes\nAbstinence until college and/or\nAt first she was like \"I want you to wait until you're married\" and then after a while she's\nkinda like, \"All right, that's unrealistic, but umm . . . \" I know she'd want me to wait until I\nwas married, but she kinda knows that I'm going to college next year, it's probably going\nto happen. (Linda, age 17, White female)\nAbstinence until marriage My parent's attitude is wait until you're married . . . they just think that like wait until\nyou're married because if you end up with a kid and the guy leaves, then you have some\nissues to deal with. (Carol, age 18, Asian American female)\nSex \"okay\" if being safe My father, he was straight up with me . . . \"Are you having sex with your boyfriend?\" and\nI told him yeah, and he was like, \"Well, are you being safe?\" yeah, and then he's like,\n\"Well.\" (Grace, age 17, White female)\nConsequences Sample quotes\nSex limits opportunities My parents have told me, like, \"You know if you end up getting a girl pregnant then . . . you\nnot going to be going to college you're going to be, like . . . find a job and start working\nthere and be able to support that baby\" . . . and so . . . (Ben, age 19, White male)\nConcerns about STIs There was so much talk [between my parents and I] about getting diseases [STIs] . . . I was\njust so scared thinking that he gave me a disease or something . . . that was the worst\npart, thinking that he ruined my life. (Betty, age 19, White female)\nDon't do anything that's, you know, risky and you might get . . . you know, STD. (George,\nage 19, Asian American male)\nConcerns about teen pregnancy I actually went and got myself on birth control when I was 15, before I ever done anything\nbecause I wanted to be safe in case. I didn't wanna end up pregnant. (Betty, age 19, White\nfemale)\nYou know that's always . . . the condom can break and stuff [pregnancy] like that, umm, I\nwasn't worried about like STD's . . ., I knew that wasn't a problem.

Open parent\u00adchild communication was essential for\ntheir ability to establish a trusting relationship with their\nparents:\n[My mother] asked me about my boyfriend, and if I got a new\nboyfriend she's, like, \"Are you guys having sex?\" It's a pretty\nstraightforward answer, \"Yeah.\" (Grace, age 17, White\nfemale)\n[Parents should have an] open relationship, like being able to\ntalk, not the awkward kind of, like, \"All right here's a book\n[about sex], read it, we'll talk if you have any questions,\" but,\nlike, to be able to relate and say, like, \"I've been in your situation\nbefore, I kinda know what you're going through, and it's\nimportantformetobeinvolved[inyoursexualitydevelopment],\"\nlike, I think it's really important that you, to have that really\nspecial bond between, like, a parent and child. (Linda, age 17,\nWhite female)\nI've always been really close with my mom and I've never been\nafraid to talk to her about anything, so I've always valued my\nrelationship with my mom . . . She never tried to hide the fact\nthat she was eighteen when she had my sister. And you know she\ntold me about, you know it was, like, her first time and . . . it was\na mistake and then she got pregnant the very first time it\nhappened and she never she never laid sex out to me as like it\nwas, umm, like, a really bad thing. She just kinda wanted me to\nbe careful, to be really careful . . . Yeah, being open is for sure is\nthe most important, but . . . I mean you wanna make sure you\ndisciplining them, but you don't, you also don't wanna make\nthem feel like they're a bad person for doing anything. (Paul,\nConversely, language could be a barrier to parental com-\nmunication. Some preferred observation:\nI wouldn't say that we're, like, very close because there was,\nlike, sort of, like, a small language barrier, because I learned\nEnglish here and I grew up speaking English, whereas my mom\ndoesn't know any English, but, like, I can still speak Chinese,\nit's just not as well as I can speak English, I'm not, like, fluent,\nbut I'll still be able to talk to her, but I didn't, I never talked to\nher about, like, my problems or, like, what's really going on in\nmy life [i.e., dating or a having sexual relationship] . . . I think\nparents should teach [how to avoid risk] by example. (Nancy,\nage 18, Asian American female)\nMany Asian American adolescents learned about par-\nents' sexual expectations via non-verbal communication,\nsuch as observing their actions and behaviors. Many noted\ndifficulties in opening up to their parents, particularly\nbecause sex is a taboo topic in many Asian cultures. One\nparticipant speculated that his parents did not have the \"sex\ntalk\" because they viewed him as a child, whereas another\ninterpreted their avoidance of sexual topics as an attempt to\nkeep him focused on the merits of hard work and\nachievement:\nI feel like it's because they're, they're just, like, shy away from\nthe subject and they don't want to . . . they're not ready yet to\naccept that, that I'm like, like, grown enough for it, you know, I\nfeel like they still look at me as a child, so they feel like they\nshouldn't talk about that issue, then I will eventually figure it out\nby myself. (Ralph, age 19, Asian American male)\nAs vigilance, my mother and father . . . they have a restaurant\nand they work . . . they always worked hard a lot. So, they\nalways . . . you know, they want me to have a better life so . . .\nand they always help me, the key to that, you know, have a good\n. . . education, uh, career . . . so they always . . . tell me to uh, do\nmy best. (George, age 19, Asian American male)\nOverall, the Asian American adolescents seemed to\nunderstand their parents' reluctance to engage in \"sex talk.\"\nOne participant stated, \"I understand why my parents are\nboth a little standoffish about the topic . . . they are not com-\nfortable\" (Donna, age 18, Asian American female). Another\nrationalized that avoidance was the only approach that Asian\nparents were familiar with: \"Asian parents are just doing\nthings that they are good [emphasis added] at [i.e., avoiding\ntopics or situations],\" including not allowing romantic or\nsexual relationships (Carol, age 19, Asian American female).\nSome Asian adolescents mentioned that excessive paren-\ntal emphasis on academic success made them feel that their\nparents' care for them was \"conditional.\" This was different\nfrom that of their White counterparts, who were more likely\nto report their parents' care as unconditional--that is, to ulti-\nmately desire their children to be happy.\nAdolescents were very observant of their parents' behav-\nior. When there was a difference between what parents said\nand did, adolescents tended to ignore parental expectations\nand aligned with their own beliefs instead:\n[My father is] kind of a hypocrite . . . it's kind of off-topic, but\nhe smoked. I've been caught smoking . . . he's just really, really\njudgmental with a lot of things [about my boyfriend] though.\nHe's hard on me a lot of the time. (Grace, age 17, White female)\nOverall, parental expectations played a significant role in\nadolescents' decisions about engaging in sexual activities\nthat might jeopardize their future success. One participant\nrecalled that her mother told her, \"You know, you have so\nmuch to live for. Why ruin it now to have a baby [or sex] so\nyoung?\" (Jennifer, age 18, White female). Another stated,\nI'm pretty much American, since I've lived here my whole life,\nand I guess my parents, they've had different rules than other\nparents. That's one main thing I've noticed, like, through high\nschool I would have a curfew. They were kinda more strict about\nthe grades. Maybe for my whole upbringing they've had a\nhigher emphasis on grades and so [abstinence has] been good for\nme, I guess. (Steve, age 19, Asian American male)\nGenerally, if adolescents felt that their parents' expecta-\ntions were acceptable, they were more likely to take them\ninto consideration when making decisions about engaging in\nsexual activities. Some participants agreed with or thought\nthat their parents' attitudes were realistic.\nI am not [sexually active] . . . I think [my parents] influenced me\nby having that sort of [conservative] attitude towards sexual\nrelationships. (Carol, age 18, Asian American female)\nMy parents do not want me to have sex right now . . . I thought\nthat it was really good that my parents were attentive to who I\nwas hanging out with or what I'm doing . . . this is different from\nsome of my friends' parents. (Lisa, age 17, White female)\nWhile there was a consensus among adolescents that \"sex\ntakes away opportunities,\" female adolescents were more\nlikely to mention parental concerns about STIs and early\npregnancy. Male adolescents were less likely to have had\nsuch conversations with their parents.\nTheme 4: Parenting practices matter.Parenting styles and\npractices influenced how adolescents viewed parental expec-\ntations. The majority of adolescents disliked it when their\nparents preached or lectured, but they responded well when\ntheir parents shared personal experiences with them, and\nthey felt closer to them after listening to their stories:\nEven though my [mother] made mistakes about having kids at\nan early age, she made sure that we knew to value . . . self-worth.\n(Jennifer, age 18, White female)\nOne time I was, umm, going on a date with a guy that was a few\nyears older than me and [my father] kinda, like, warned me\nabout he thinks guys are only thinking about one thing . . . he\nknows that when how he was when he was, you know, 20 or 21\nyears old, so he was just telling me, like, \"watch out\" so I guess\nto me that made me think . . . how his experience is affecting\nhow he sees mine . . . well, for like a father and a daughter,\nspecifically . . . just you know kinda giving the guys perspective\nof the whole thing, so that [the daughter] understands that better.\n(Sandra, age 18, White female)\nOther positive parenting practices included knowing an\nadolescent's whereabouts, being involved in an adolescent's\ndecision making, and having same-gender, parent\u00adchild\ndyadic sexual discussion. Negative practices included being\n\"overprotective\" and \"controlling.\" Asian adolescents, in\nparticular, were more likely to describe parenting styles as\n\"controlling\" and \"strict,\" in which parents paid the majority\nof attention to their children's whereabouts and academic\nachievement. White participants rarely mentioned parental\nmonitoring activities.\nParticipants made both positive and negative comments\nabout \"strict\" parenting styles. For one adolescent, her\nfather's strict parenting style discouraged independent deci-\nsion making:\nI obviously don't have as open of a relationship [with my father]\nas I do with my mom . . . he's much more strict, he's extremely\nlike . . . very strict. \"If I say you're coming home at 12, you're\ncoming home at 12,\" and there's no negotiation about that, like\nthings are his way or I don't get anything. (Linda, age 17, Asian\nAmerican female)\nConversely, another participant interpreted parental strict-\nness as a way to protect her from making mistakes and to\nensure future success:\nI have to be really careful about balance [between what I want\nand what my parents want] . . . I can't screw up . . . that's why I\nwas pressured to be pre-med. Or, like at least go into health . . .\nit's because medicine is almost a guaranteed $100K+ career. My\nparents both know what it's like to grow up with nothing. (Helen,\nage 19, Asian American female)\nSome adolescents urged parents to have \"realistic\" expec-\ntations, while others advised parents to love and support their\nadolescents unconditionally.\nDon't have unrealistic views, make sure that your child knows\nthat they can come to you with anything. It's important for you\nto be there and support them. (Jennifer, age 18, White female)\nGive [adolescents] a lot of love every day, show them a lot of\nattention. (Ben, age 19, White male)\nOther participants echoed the importance of spending\nquality time together to support and improve the parent\u00ad\nchild relationship in general, thereby making it easier for\nparents to talk about important topics such as sexual activi-\nties or behavior.\nIf [parents] ignore it, it's gonna be more of a problem. That's\nwhy so many kids are pregnant these days or because the parents\ndon't wanna talk about it. They think if they just ignore it, it's\nnot gonna be a problem, well that's not true. Just like if your kid\nwas doing drugs, you'd wanna talk to them, you wouldn't just\nignore it. (Betty, age 19, White female)\nI've been good at holding off peer pressure, but peer pressure\ncan be very strong so I think parents definitely need to bring it\nup more, no matter how awkward it is, I know we [Asians] don't\nwanna talk about it, but peer pressure's getting worse and worse\nand if your all your friends starting doing it, it becomes, like, ok\nto start doing it, so [Asian parents] definitely need to talk about\nit. (Karen, age 17, Asian American female)\nIn summary, our qualitative analysis revealed that adoles-\ncents' decisions about sex were associated with their percep-\ntions of parental sexual attitudes, expectations, and\nrelationships. Adolescents appeared to experience repeated\ncycles of expectation violation and realignment, and eventu-\nally developed an understanding of their parents' sexual\nexpectations. In particular, we noted behavioral realignment\nin the actions of adolescents who considered the conse-\nquences of engaging in sexual activity when they felt that\nsuch behavior would disappoint their parents or violate their\ntrust and expectations. Although this consideration may not\nhave completely deterred these adolescents from sexual\nactivity, they appeared to have been more likely to attempt to\nminimize risks or consequences associated with sexual activ-\nity, such as using birth control pills or condoms. Ultimately,\nthey did not want to become a teenage parent or to contract\nSTIs, which they believed would \"take away future\nopportunities.\"\nDiscussion\nThis study explored how adolescents perceive and frame\ntheir parents' sexual expectations. Specifically, we examined\nhow perceived parental expectations relate to the parent\u00ad\nchild relationship and adolescents' reported sexual activities\nover time. Four important themes about adolescent percep-\ntions of parental expectations were derived from our analy-\nsis: (a) expectations are culture-specific and value-laden, (b)\na trusting parent\u00adadolescent relationship is fundamental, (c)\nparents convey expectations in different ways, and (d) par-\nenting practices matter.\nCongruent with the expectancy violation\u00adrealignment\nmodel (Collins & Luebker, 1994), adolescents'sexual activi-\nties were associated with their perceptions of parental sexual\nexpectations, and were the result of dyadic parent\u00adchild\ninteractions. Our results indicate that adolescents' perceived\nparental attitudes (or expectations) demarcated what behav-\niors were acceptable or unacceptable. In particular, our quali-\ntative results indicate that if an adolescent was to mind his or\nher parents' expectations, it was important for the adolescent\nto have a trusting and supportive parental relationship. Our\nqualitative and quantitative results also illustrate that disap-\nproving and conservative parental attitudes are protective\nagainst adolescent risky sexual behaviors. This is congruent\nwith other research findings (Dittus & Jaccard, 2000;\nthat promoting an adolescent's perceived parental expecta-\ntions may be effective for preventing risky sexual behavior.\nWe also note that the Asian American adolescents in our\nsample observed that their parents practiced the distinct par-\nenting practice/style of focusing on and expecting a signifi-\ncant degree of academic success. Adolescents warned that\nthis excessive attention might be misinterpreted as \"condi-\ntional\" love, resulting in a misperception that could strain the\nparent\u00adchild relationship. This could be problematic for ado-\nlescents who fail to meet their parents'high expectations and\nexperience psychological stress. Hwang and Wood (2009)\nhave suggested that distant parent\u00adchild relationships may\nbe related to symptoms and risks for clinical depression\namongAsianAmerican adolescents. Thus, it might be impor-\ntant for health professionals to seek ways to strengthen the\nparent\u00adchild relationship. In such cases, adolescents may\nfeel accepted and more willing to share personal problems\nwith their parents.\nReported parental closeness, as indicated by the EHC\ndata, was similar between White and Asian American adoles-\ncents. Our interview data demonstrate that White adolescents\nwere less likely to report parental regulation or monitoring of\ntheir activities or whereabouts. It is not clear if the compara-\ntively higher rate of sexual activity reported by White ado-\nlescents is related to their reports of less parental monitoring.\nHowever, it is important to note that parental monitoring has\na protective effect against adolescent risky sexual behaviors\n(Wagner et al., 2010). We also observed that as adolescents\ngrew older, their perceptions of disapproving parental sexual\nattitudes decreased while sexual activities increased. This\npattern of association was most obvious among White ado-\nlescents. Overall, it seems that sexual activities were closely\nrelated to how adolescents perceived parental attitudes over\ntime.\nEnhancing positive parenting practices can strengthen the\nparent\u00adadolescent relationship, particularly when the prac-\ntices work to build an adolescent's sense of parental trust and\ncloseness. Our results indicate that adolescents tended to\ntrust and perceive a closer relationship with their parents if\nparental demands and expectations were clearly explained\nand/or were perceived as realistic. Adolescents who per-\nceived parental expectations to be realistic and valuable were\nmore likely to commit to their cultural/familial values and\nbehave accordingly. Helping parents realize their cultural/\nfamilial strengths and to shape or reframe them into realistic\nexpectations may be a good way to promote family strengths\nand maximize parental influences in the positive develop-\nment of healthy adolescent behaviors.\nConsistency between what parents said and how they\nbehaved was an important factor for adolescents in determin-\ning how much they would \"mind,\" or follow, their parents'\nexpectations. In general, adolescents disliked when parents\n\"preached\" or lectured, but they were very interested in\nlearning about their parents' experiences and perspectives.\nHaving a parent share personal stories was a great way for\nadolescents to understand their parents' perspectives, values,\nand beliefs. Consistent parental attitudes and modeling\nbehaviors merged as critical to adolescents' decision making\nabout what behaviors were appropriate and acceptable.\nAdolescents were more likely to honor parental expectations\nabout appropriate or safe behaviors if they understood and\naccepted the rationale behind such expectations.\nAlthough adolescents in this study \"requested\" autonomy\nor independence from their parents, their recommendations\nfor parents of adolescents similar to themselves included\nbeing \"close\" with their adolescents and being \"watchful\" of\npeer influences. Health care providers should be aware of the\nimportance of guiding and assisting parents to build a trust-\ning, close relationship with their children, and of establishing\nclear and realistic expectations.\nWhile the Asian American adolescents in this study were\nless likely to report being sexually active and more likely to\nrespect their parents' expectations to remain abstinent, they\nwere more likely to report difficulty communicating with\ntheir parents and to wish for greater autonomy. In this study,\nwe observed that the sexual activities reported by these\nseemingly \"problem-free\" adolescents were not as risk-free\nas previously thought. Participant reports of multiple sex\npartners and/or engaging in unprotected sexual activities\nwere higher than those reported in a recent, nationally repre-\nsentative survey of adolescent health-risk behaviors (CDC,\n2012). Due to our small sample size, it is not sufficient to\nsuggest Asian American and White adolescents as at-risk\ngroups, but it does suggest that stereotyping them as \"prob-\nlem-free\" may be unhelpful for promoting their sexual health\ndevelopment.\nLimitations\nThis study was limited by our sample distribution, particu-\nlarly as many participants were from middle- to high-income\nfamilies and had parents who held a college degree. This\ncould partly explain participants' higher-than-normal aspira-\ntions for success, as well as their relatively later sexual onset.\nHowever, it is important to note that there is no empirical\nevidence to suggest that adolescents from highly educated,\nhigh-income homes engage in sexual activities at lower rates.\nOur sample was also limited to one geographical area, and\nthe use of snowball sample techniques tended to draw other\nparticipants of similar backgrounds and/or socioeconomic\nstatus. Asian Americans are a heterogeneous group with\nmany different cultural beliefs, and results should be inter-\npreted with caution. A larger and more diverse sample could\nprovide deeper insight into adolescent perceptions of paren-\ntal expectations across socioeconomic and cultural back-\ngrounds. Given the size and make-up of the sample, the\nknowledge produced may not be generalizable to other indi-\nviduals or settings. Finally, face-to-face interviews provide\nopportunities for synchronous communication and observa-\ntion, but the researcher's presence can affect participant\nresponses. Robust procedures were applied during data anal-\nysis, but potential researcher bias and idiosyncrasies embed-\nded in the qualitative design could exist.\nImplications\nDespite the limitations of our sample, our findings have\nimportant theoretical implications for understanding and\noperationalizing the concept of perceived parental expecta-\ntions. Knowing how White and Asian American adolescents\nperceive parental expectations about sex and how such\nexpectations might be related to their sexual behaviors can\nhelp practitioners develop strategies to facilitate parent\u00adchild\ninteractions. In addition, a thorough understanding about the\neffect of perceived parental expectations can be very useful\nin the effort to improve parent\u00adchild interactions. For exam-\nple, an in-depth understanding of how adolescents perceive\nparental expectations may enhance the development of mea-\nsures based on expectancy theory (Smith & Goldman, 1994),\nallowing practitioners to target factors that are significant in\nshaping adolescents' perceived parental expectations. This\nknowledge can be used to tailor family strategies to improve\nparent\u00adchild interactions. Subsequently, such tailored family\ninterventions would be more effective in enhancing parent\nand adolescent efficacy for healthy behaviors.\nOverall, our study demonstrates that the concept of per-\nceived parental expectations can be used to help practitioners\nunderstand how adolescents perceive and respond to parental\nsexual expectations. The parent\u00adchild relationship and\nparental attitudes play an important role in fostering such\nexpectations. Thus, family practitioners can utilize this con-\ncept to enhance parent\u00adchild interactions and minimize ado-\nlescent risky behaviors. Further research is needed to develop\nan expectancy-focused family intervention to improve par-\nent\u00adadolescent interactions and thereby prevent risky\nbehaviors.\n"
