However, less is known about how characteristics of adult children influence this process. Data for this\nanalysis are from 5,382 older parents participating in the 1993/4 AHEAD national survey of adults aged 70 years\nold and older. Findings demonstrate that elderly parents who expect to move closer to adult children tend to be\nolder, female, and have at least one child who is better-off financially than they are. Living alone magnifies the ef-\nfect ofpoor self-rated health on expecting to move closer to a child. Random effects modeling of children's charac-\nteristics reveals that parents are more likely to expect to move closer to a daughter than to a son. Greater parental\nfunctional impairment was found to further depress the selection of sons. Overall, the findings suggest that older\nparents expect to move closer to adult children out of need and tend to select a target child with greater potential to\nprovide support.\nOVER the last decade considerable attention has been\ndevoted to understanding the role that geographic dis-\ntance plays in the maintenance of intergenerational ex-\nchanges in the older family. Research has shown that inter-\naction and transfers of assistance across generations are\nvery sensitive to the geographic distance between older\nparents and their adult children. For instance, Litwak and\nKulis (1987) found that the proportion of parents receiving\ninstrumental assistance dropped from 70% to 30% when\nthe primary helper went from being ten blocks away to\nbeing just 30 minutes away. Research demonstrates that\nolder parents who live closer to their children also have\nmore contact with them (Bengtson & Roberts, 1991; DeWit\n& Frankel, 1988), have greater affection for them (Lawton,\nSilverstein, & Bengtson, 1994), and tend to be more in-\nvolved with their grandchildren (Cherlin & Furstenberg,\n1986). Thus, geographic proximity is a key variable in\nstructuring opportunities for intergenerational exchange,\ninteraction, and cohesion in the older family. Yet we know\nrelatively little about the dynamic nature of geographic\ndistance between intergenerational family members and\nthe mechanisms by which intergenerational proximity is\nachieved. In this article, we use nationally representative\ndata to examine the factors that shape the expectations of\nolder parents of moving closer to their adult children and to\nbetter understand how the child-selection process is guided\nby both parents' and children's characteristics.\nGeographic Mobility and Intergenerational Distance\nGeographic separation of adult generations and residen-\ntial independence of elderly adults have been taken by some\nscholars as evidence that the intergenerational family is in\ndecline, and therefore unable to ensure the well-being of its\nmembers (Popenoe, 1993). Indeed, over the last century\nolder parents have become increasingly more likely to live\nindependently of their children (Thornton & Freedman,\nand 1984) in the proportion of elderly parents who live near\ntheir adult children (Crimmins & Ingegneri, 1990). How-\never, an alternative perspective posits that the family is re-\nsilient to earlier geographic dispersion by reconstituting it-\nself in reaction to (or in anticipation of) the vulnerabilities\nof its older relatives (Litwak, 1985). This phenomenon of\n\"return\" migration (geographic mobility of older adults to\ncommunities where relatives reside) has been demonstrated\nin studies of migration streams which show that older peo-\nple who move from the Sunbelt to the Frostbelt are less\nhealthy than those moving in the reverse direction (Litwak\nThe theoretical underpinnings of return migration are de-\nveloped by Litwak and colleagues, who propose that dis-\nabled elderly persons require frequent instrumental services\nthat only proximate informal care providers, most often\nspouses and adult children, can provide most effectively\nand efficiently (see Litwak & Kulis, 1987). Thus, return\nmigration typically occurs when disability in conjunction\nwith widowhood motivates older people to move to com-\nmunities where their children or other relatives can care for\nthem. Evidence from a variety of demographic and family\nstudies demonstrates that elderly adults are able to adapt\ntheir residential circumstances to meet the needs of chang-\ning physical and social conditions. Findings from several\nlongitudinal studies of household dynamics of elderly peo-\nple demonstrate that diminished functional capacity and\nbeing either unmarried or a recent widow, or living alone\nincreases the likelihood of moving from an independent\nhousehold to a shared residence with adult children or\nother adults (Speare, Avery, & Lawton, 1991; Spitze, Lo-\ntion, studies examining geographic distance between gener-\nations over time have found older parents in poor and\ndeclining health to be more likely to converge with adult\nchildren, suggesting that increases in proximity are also\nmotivated by parents' needs for assistance (Clark & Wolf,\n(1995), in examining retrospective attributions for mobility\nbehavior among older persons age 70 and older, found that\na substantial proportion of elderly migrants moved in order\nto live closer to (and affiliate more frequently with) family\nmembers, but not necessarily to receive assistance with a\nhealth-related dependency. Their findings suggest that fac-\ntors other than physical health play roles in motivating\nreturn migration.\nIn this analysis we advance understanding of the dynam-\nics of elderly return migration in several ways. First, unlike\nother studies, we examine characteristics of older parents as\nwell as those of their children to assess mobility decisions\nin later life. Whereas most research on return migration has\nfocused on the needs and resources of the elderly persons\n(i.e., \"push\" factors), much less attention has been paid to\nthe social characteristics of children who are the targets of\nreturn migration (i.e., \"pull\" factors). Children's character-\nistics are important to consider as they reflect the benefits\nparents anticipate through geographic convergence with\ntheir adult offspring. For instance, frail older parents may\nperceive daughters and those children with greater financial\nand housing resources as better equipped to meet their\nneeds for care and supervision.\nSecond, we conceptualize the process of geographic con-\nvergence with children as comprising three implicit deci-\nsions made by older parents: (1) deciding whether to move,\n(2) deciding whether to move toward a child, and (3) decid-\ning which child or children to move toward (among those\nwith two or more children). Although these three decisions\nare made virtually together in practice, we treat them as\ndistinct because each may be guided by unique motivations\n(for a related discussion, see Petersen, 1988). For example,\nwe predict that good health enhances the geographic mobil-\nity of older parents, but we also hypothesize that among\nthose parents who expect to move, poor health enhances\ntheir desire to move closer to adult children. With respect to\nthe third decision, we predict that the availability of \"suit-\nable\" children will form the basis for choosing those with\nwhom proximity is preferred.\nA third innovation of this analysis is that we consider all\nadult children in modeling which of their characteristics are\nassociated with their parents' expectations for greater prox-\nimity. We use procedures that have desirable statistical\nproperties in the analysis of data structures where children\nare nested hierarchically within families. Such approaches\nproduce parameter estimates that explicitly model how par-\nent-based choice strategies are dependent on their chil-\ndren's characteristics and how parents' characteristics pro-\nduce variations in those choice strategies.\nIn this research we examine the future expectations of\nolder parents to move closer to, or in with, their adult chil-\ndren. It is important to note that while stated expectations\nreflect current states of mind with respect to residential\nmobility, it is almost axiomatic that they will correlate im-\nperfectly with actual mobility. Subsequent behavior may\ndeviate from expectations in several ways. First, current cir-\ncumstances of parents and of children may change over\ntime--unexpectedly blocking or triggering geographic mo-\nbility. Second, expectations of moving closer to children\nare colored by subjective appraisals and values such as\nnorms of familism (the degree to which family obligation is\nconsidered important), preferences for autonomy/depen-\ndency in intergenerational relations, self-assessment of\nfuture needs, and anticipation that alternatives to adult chil-\ndren will or will not be available. We suggest that expec-\ntations are important to study, not only because of their\nability to predict future mobility, but because they are infor-\nmative about the perceived salience of adult children as po-\ntential or preferred resources--even if those expectations\ngo unfulfilled in the immediate future.\nThere are several issues with respect to our operational-\nization of return migration that deserve discussion. Return\nmigration has been operationalized variously in the empiri-\ncal literature as interstate migration, residential mobility,\nchanging household composition, and convergence of el-\nderly adults with family members. The phenomenon is\ninterpreted less frequently as the literal return to a home\ncommunity than as the restoration of earlier social arrange-\nments. In our study, we take this broader view by consider-\ning return migration as the geographic convergence of\nelderly parents with their children, which revives or ap-\nproximates an earlier nuclear family arrangement.\nGiven our focus on intergenerational geographic conver-\ngence as a manifestation of return migration, we think it\nimportant to acknowledge that the mobility intentions of\nolder parents, but not of their adult children, are observed\nin the present study. Because parental expectations for the\nmobility of children may blunt their desire to move closer\nto children, we are likely to underestimate the strength with\nwhich these parents are predisposed to living closer to chil-\ndren. Although we are able to compensate for the conse-\nquences of past mobility by controlling for baseline dis-\ntances from children, we cannot account for parents who\ndesire greater proximity through the mobility of their chil-\ndren. Therefore, our measure of intended geographic con-\nvergence will be underestimated to the extent that parents\nexpect their children to move closer to them.\nIn our analysis, we address three general research ques-\ntions: (1) How do physical and cognitive impairments in\nconjunction with living arrangements influence the expecta-\ntions of older people to move closer to or in with their chil-\ndren? (2) How do the social and economic characteristics of\nindividual adult children influence which one(s) their par-\nents expect to move closer to or in with? (3) How do par-\nents' characteristics influence the criteria they use to select\nwhich child(ren) they expect to move closer to or in with?\nMETHOD\nSample\nThe data used in this analysis are drawn from the Asset\nand Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old (AHEAD), a na-\ntional probability sample of 8,223 noninstitutionalized\nhousehold residents at least 70 years of age and their\nthe survey consists of telephone interviews (72% of those\nparticipants age 80 and older) and personal interviews\ncludes supplemental oversamples of Blacks, Hispanics, and\nresidents of Florida. The content of the survey principally\nfocused on the domains of health, financial well-being, and\nfamily relations of the elderly participants.\nBecause this analysis focuses on the older parents' ex-\npectations of moving closer to their children, we selected\nan analytic sample of 4,655 respondents who had at least\none surviving child and who did not live with a child at the\ntime of the survey. We omitted parents who coresided with\na child because they had no opportunity to achieve addi-\ntional geographic proximity. Spouses of household mem-\nbers who were under 70 years of age and proxy respondents\nwere also dropped from our analysis.\nCharacteristics of the analytic sample and distributions of\nkey study variables are found in Table 1. Normalized\nweights provided by AHEAD are applied in order to com-\npensate for the oversampling and to ensure that the analytic\nsample reflects a nationally representative profile. Three out\nof five parents in our analytic sample (61%) are female, and\nslightly more than one quarter (28%) are at least 80 years\nold (average age is 78 years). Seven percent are African\nAmerican and 3% are Hispanic, and 63% graduated from\nhigh school. Forty-three percent live alone and 69% own\ntheir homes. In terms of health status, almost one quarter\n(24%) of the sample have difficulty with one or more activ-\nities of daily living (ADL), and 31% rate their health as fair\nor poor. The distribution of a performance-based measure\nof cognitive impairment, ranging from 0 to 25, reveals that\n13.3% of respondents answered more than half the test\nitems incorrectly (average number incorrect is 8.2). Aggre-\ngate characteristics of children are also shown in Table 1.\nHalf of the parents (50%) have only one or two living chil-\nmiles of at least one child, and 72% have at least one child\nwho is better-off financially than they are.\nDependent Variables\nAs discussed earlier, we conceptualize the decision to\nmove closer to adult children as comprising three distinct\nand hierarchical sets of expectations. Respondents were\nfirst asked to rate the certainty of their expectations for\nmoving in the next 5 years on a scale of 0 to 100%, with\nhigher values indicating greater certainty. Those who rated\ntheir certainty as 20% or higher were considered to be\nat risk of moving and were asked follow-up questions\nconcerning their expected moves. Thus, we used the 20%\nthreshold to create a binary variable for the expectation to\nmove. By this criterion threshold, 26.6% of our sample of\nolder parents expected to move in the next 5 years.\nThe second stage of the analysis (conditional on having\nexpressed at least 20% expectation of moving) predicts\nwhether older parents expect to move closer to or in with a\nchild; we determined that 51% have such an expectation.\nThe third stage of the analysis (conditional on expecting to\nmove closer to a child) predicts which child or children par-\nents would choose as those they expect to move closer to or\nin with.\nIt should be noted that our choice of 20% as a threshold for\nassessing the certainty of moving was based on survey proto-\ncols; therefore follow-up questions about expected moves\nwere asked only of respondents who were above this crite-\nTable 1.

Nevertheless, we were cautious in applying this\nthreshold and performed additional tests to detect possible bi-\nases that might be related to its use. These include (1) per-\nforming comparable analyses using a 50% threshold and (2)\nincluding the raw percentage as a control variable in second-\nand third-stage equations. Our results indicated that estimated\nequations and their interpretations were little changed by\nthese modifications. Therefore, we used a 20% cutoff in order\nto maximize the information available for our analyses.\nIndependent variables.--The following demographic\nand socioeconomic characteristics of older parents were\ntested as independent variables in predicting mobility ex-\npectations (reference categories in parentheses): female\n(male), living alone (living with others), African American\nand Hispanic (White non-Hispanic), age, number of chil-\ndren, home ownership (renting), the log of household in-\ncome, and years of formal education. Health variables in-\nclude instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs),\nactivities of daily living (ADLs), self-rated health, and cog-\nnitive impairment. IADL is measured as the total number of\nthe following activities reported as difficult to perform:\nmeal preparation, shopping, using the telephone, managing\nmoney, and taking medication. ADL is measured as the\ntotal number of the following activities reported as difficult\nto perform: bathing, toileting, dressing, eating, walking,\nand bed transferring. Self-rated health is measured on a\nscale ranging from 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). Cognitive im-\npairment is measured as a composite index consisting of\ntests of memory and other forms of performance-based\nmental functioning; possible scores range from 0-25, with\nhigher scores indicating greater impairment.\nOther independent variables are specific to the equation\nbeing estimated. In predicting the expectation of moving in\nthe next five years, we included three indicators of housing\nand neighborhood characteristics: perceived condition of\ncurrent housing (scored 1-5, with 1 = excellent and 5 =\nvery poor); perceived neighborhood safety (scored 1-5,\nwith 1 = very safe and 5 = very unsafe); and length of time\nin current housing (scored dichotomously, with 0 = less\nWe also included summary characteristics of adult chil-\ndren as predictors of whether parents expect to move closer\nto or in with their children. These variables, which indicate\nthe availability of particular types of children, include the\nfollowing dichotomously scored items (reference groups in\nparentheses): having at least one child who is perceived as\nbeing better-off financially than the parent (not having such\na child); having at least one daughter (having no daugh-\nters); and having at least one child who lives within 10\nmiles of the parent (not having such a child). The last vari-\nable is especially important because it controls for the\neffects of any prior residential mobility that resulted in\ngreater proximity to children.\nIn the equation testing the effects of an individual child's\ncharacterisitics on his or her likelihood of being chosen by\na parent, the following variables are included as predictors\n(reference groups in parentheses): age in years, being a\ndaughter (son), being married (unmarried), having income\nhaving a child (no children), being better-off financially\nthan the parent (not being better-off financially than par-\nent), living within 10 miles of the parent (living 10 miles or\nfarther), and being a stepchild (being a biological or\nadopted child).\nStatistical method.--Because the three dependent vari-\nables were represented as binary outcomes, we used logis-\ntic and probit regression models in each of the three stages\nof the analysis. First, we estimated a logistic regression\nequation to predict the expectation of moving. Next, we es-\ntimated a second logistic regression equation to predict\nwhether those parents who expected to move also expected\nto move closer to a child. In this equation we adjusted for\npossible sources of sample selection bias by including an\ninstrumental variable (A.) calculated as the predicted proba-\nbility (from the first equation) that respondents did not ex-\nis useful in analyses where the sample selection criterion\nrestricts the distribution of the dependent variable within\nthe contingent sample. Although it is difficult to identify a\nspecific mechanism by which the selection of \"potential\nmovers\" might produce such a restriction in our second\nequation, we nevertheless used the instrumental variable\napproach as a precaution against the possibility of selection\nbias. In addition, normalized sample weights were applied\nin the first two stages of the analysis so that the parameter\nestimates were based on a sample that reflected a nationally\nrepresentative profile.\nFinally, in the third stage of the analysis we examined\nhow the characteristics of children affect their likelihood of\nbeing chosen by parents who already expect to move closer\nto children. Because the outcome for each child was binary\n(chosen or not) and the sampling units (children) were hier-\narchically nested within parents, we employed random ef-\nfects probit and logit estimation procedures. We used ran-\ndom effects modeling in several ways. First, we performed\na random effects probit analysis based on all available in-\ntergenerational dyads. This application provides a straight-\nforward statistical test of whether there is significant with-\nin-parent residual variation in the dependent variable\n(measured as p, the proportion of the total error variance\nthat occurs within parental contexts). If p is not statistically\nsignificant, then the random effects specification does not\nhold, signifying that there are no unobserved family effects\nand that the results are comparable to those obtained in or-\ndinary probit analysis.\nNext, we used hierarchical linear modeling with random\neffects to identify within-parent variations in choice of chil-\ndren based on their gender and the sources of those varia-\ntions between parents. In this method, choice is treated as a\nparent-specific decision that weighs between competing al-\nternatives (son vs daughter), and variations in such choices\nare examined as a function of parental characteristics. Thus,\nin this part of the analysis we included only those parents\nwho had at least one child of each gender. Specifically, ran-\ndom effects modeling with a logit link function is used to\nestimate coefficients at both the within-parent level of anal-\nysis (1) and the between-parent level of analysis (2). The\nequation at Level 1 has the following form in the simple bi-\nvariate case, where x represents a dummy variable indicat-\ning that the child is a daughter (Bryk & Raudenbush,\nyB\n= boj + bij Xij + rsj,\nwhere\nyy is the log-odds that child / is chosen by parent j ,\nXij is the gender of child i of parent./,\nboj is the predicted value of y.j when Xij = 0 (sons of par-\nent;),\nbij is the predicted value of the marginal change in y.j\nwhen Xij = 1 (daughters of parent j), and\nry is the error term for yy.\nAt Level 2, the equations have the following form, where\nw represents a parental characteristic variable (note that the\ndependent variables are random parent-specific coefficients\nfrom Level 1):\nboj = goo + go. Wj + UO\nj\nwhere\nW\nj is a characteristic of parent j ,\ngoo is the predicted bO\nj when Wj = 0,\ngoi is the predicted linear change in b0\nassociated with\nunit change in w,\nUOJ is the error term for boj,\ngio is the predicted bij when w3\ngn is the predicted linear change in bi associated with\nunit change in w, and\nUij is the error term for bij.\nRESULTS\nExpectation to move.--In the first stage of the analysis\nwe examined whether older parents expected (with 20% or\ngreater certainty) to move in the next 5 years. The logistic\nregression equation shown in Table 2 reveals that housing\nand neighborhood characteristics play a role in the expecta-\ntion to move in the next 5 years. Those parents who do not\nown homes, those who are relatively short-term residents in\ntheir current housing, those who perceive their neighbor-\nhoods as less safe, and those who consider the physical\nconditions of their homes to be poorer are more likely to\nexpect to move. In addition, several sociodemographic\ncharacteristics are associated with the expectation to move:\nbeing White non-Hispanic (compared to Blacks), living\nalone, having no children living closer than 10 miles, hav-\ning more education, and having a higher income are associ-\nated with having greater expectations to move. Also, having\nbetter health--self-rated, cognitive, and functional\n(IADL)--is associated with greater expectations of residen-\ntial mobility.\nPredictors of mobility can be classified into three under-\nTable 2.

This analysis is based on\n1,240 parents who expected to move. We focused both on\nparental characteristics and aggregate offspring characteris-\ntics, including the availability of at least one daughter, the\navailability of at least one child who is better-off financially\nthan the parent, and the availability of at least one child\nwho lives less than 10 miles from the parent.\nThe first logistic regression equation in Table 3 shows the\nmain effects on expectations of moving closer to or in with\na child. This equation reveals that age is a significant pre-\ndictor. Older parents are more likely than younger parents to\nexpect that their moves will bring them geographically\ncloser to a child. Parents more advanced in age may per-\nceive their relatively short life expectancies as motivation to\nbecome closer to their adult children. As we anticipated,\nmothers were more likely than fathers to expect that their\nmoves would result in greater proximity to a child, a clear\naffirmation that mothers maintain closer relationships with\ntheir children throughout the life course. Thus, while moth-\ners and fathers were equally likely to expect to move (for\nany reason), among those who did expect to move, mothers\npreferred the communities or households of their adult chil-\ndren as destinations for their intended mobility. Neither so-\nTable 3.

Also, parents who had at least one child\nwho they perceived as having a stronger economic situation\nthan they did had greater expectations of moving closer to a\nchild than did parents without such a child. It is interesting\nthat parents who had at least one daughter were no more\nlikely to expect to move closer to a child than were parents\nwithout a daughter. The absence of a gender effect for chil-\ndren is quite surprising given the literature about the active\nrole played by daughters in the support systems of older\nparents. However, the possibility remains that child-gender\neffects are masked by parents whose choices are con-\nstrained by having only one child or same-sex children.\nNext, we tested the proposition that the effect of parental\nhealth problems on the expectation of moving closer to chil-\ndren is magnified by living alone. In the second equation of\nTable 3, we tested interaction terms between living arrange-\nments and each of IADL, self-rated health, and cognitive\nimpairment. Of the three health interactions, only self-rated\nhealth significantly interacted with living arrangements,\nsuch that poorer self-ratings of health were more strongly\nassociated with expectations of moving closer to children\namong parents who lived alone than among those who lived\nwith others. A reasonable interpretation of this interaction is\nthat living alone heightens the vulnerability experienced by\nparents with poorer subjective health, thereby elevating their\nperceived need to be closer to their children.\nChoice of child to move toward.--In the last stage of our\nanalysis, we examined whether parents chose to move\ncloser to children with particular characteristics. This model\nrequired that we consider a data structure consisting of all\nchildren of parents who expected to move closer to a child.\nWe present in Table 4 the characteristics of 2,118 such adult\nchildren. More than half of these children (51%) are daugh-\nyears of age, three quarters (74%) are married, and about\n8% are stepchildren. Slightly more than three quarters\n(77%) own their homes, 82% are employed for pay, and\n58% are rated as better-off financially than their parents.\nThe random effects logistic regression equation in Table\n5 shows the effects of a child's characteristics on whether\nthat child is chosen by his or her parent as a target of return\nmigration. Gender of the child is a significant predictor, as\nparents are more likely to choose daughters than sons. This\nfinding corresponds to known gender differences in the\nstrength of intergenerational relations.\nChildren who own their homes are also more likely to be\nchosen as target children. Because homeowners' residences\nare more stable than are those of renters, older parents may\nfeel more comfortable moving toward a child who has\ngreater potential for long-term residency. In addition, the\ngreater availability of space in a private home would be at-\ntractive to parents who intend to move in with that child.\nOlder parents are also more inclined to move toward chil-\ndren who live within 10 miles of them. Local children are\nlikely those with whom the parent already interacts most\nfrequently and with whom the most intimacy is shared. In\naddition, a move within a radius of 10 miles is less disrup-\ntive than a longer move, as it enables parents to maintain\nexisting social networks and familiar community surround-\nTable 4.

Parents are also more likely to expect to move closer\nto a biological child than to a stepchild, providing evidence\nthat blood relations are more salient than steprelations as\ntargets of return migration.\nFinally, we note that p, the test of the random effects as-\nsumption, is not statistically significant. This means that\nmost of the variation in choosing which child will be the\ndestination of convergent mobility occurs between parents;\nthere is relatively little within-paient discrimination among\nchildren.\nChoosing sons versus daughters.--In this section we\nfocus on gender as a key variable that structures which chil-\ndren older parents prefer to move toward. Indeed, quite\na large empirical literature documents the unique role\nthat daughters play as primary caregivers to older parents\nand the strong cohesion between mothers and daughters\nthroughout the life course (Mancini & Blieszner, 1989;\nPratt, 1991).

Further, we are interested in how parental charac-\nteristics, such as gender, influence the strength of child gen-\nder preferences. In order to describe such cross-level ef-\nfects, we employed hierarchical linear modeling (HLM)\nwith random effects to formally test whether, and under\nwhat conditions, parents choose daughters over sons as\ntargets of return migration. In this approach parents are\nconsidered contexts within which children are embedded.\nSpecifically, we used HLM to estimate (1) whether there\nare within-parent preferences for daughters, and (2) how\nbetween-parent differences in gender, health, and living ar-\nrangements influence these preferences.\nWe used the logistic regression capabilities of HLM to\nestimate parameters at two levels. At the first level, esti-\nmated intercepts and slopes predict for each parent the log\nodds of choosing to move closer to a daughter compared to\na son (tests of whether these parameters randomly vary are\nalso provided). These parent-specific intercepts and slopes\nserve as dependent variables at the second level (or fixed\nportion) of analysis where the variation in each is predicted\nby parental characteristics.\nThe HLM equations are presented in Table 6. In this ap-\nplication of HLM, it should be noted that the \"intercept-\nonly\" specification of the fixed equations predicts the aver-\nage log odds of choosing a son (in the random-intercept\nmodel) and the difference in the log odds of choosing a\ndaughter over choosing a son (in the random-slope model).\nWhen parental characteristics are added as predictors in the\nfixed equations, the resulting coefficients estimate linear re-\nlationships between those characteristics and the strength of\neach random effect. The first set of equations in Table 6\nshows the results from the intercept-only model for each\nrandom variable. The first equation indicates that the log\nodds of choosing a son is significantly greater than zero.\nMore importantly, the second equation reveals that parents\nare significantly more likely to choose a daughter than a\nson as the target of return migration. Further, tests of the\nerror term for each random effect, shown at the bottom of\nTable 6, reveal that each effect has significant variation.\nThis suggests that there is sufficient heterogeneity in the\nrandom effects to justify including parental characteristics\nas predictors of their variation.\nIn the second set of equations in Table 6, we include\nparental characteristics as predictors of each random effect.\nDue to high correlations among the four measures of health\nand functioning (IADL, ADL, self-rated health, and cogni-\ntion) each measure was tested individually as a fixed effect\non the two random variables (not shown). Only IADL pro-\nduced significant results, so we present the model using this\nhealth variable in addition to gender and living arrange-\nments. Parents' IADL problems are negatively related to\nthe log odds of choosing sons and positively related to\nchoosing daughters over sons. These results signify that\nparents in worse functional health are less likely than\nhealthier parents to choose sons, and their preference for\ndaughters over sons magnifies with worsening health.\nThe estimated coefficients for parents' gender are also\nstatistically significant. The equation for the random inter-\ncept reveals that mothers are less likely than fathers to\nchoose sons. Gender of parent also predicts the random\nslope; mothers are more likely than fathers to prefer daugh-\nters over sons. These results provide some evidence of\nsame-sex gender matching between parents and chosen\nchildren, an interaction effect that was not observed in the\nrandom effects probit equation (not shown). The fact that\nsame-sex pairing emerges only among parents who have\nthe opportunity to chose between children of both genders\nsuggests that parents without daughters may be inclined to\nrely on their sons.\nIn order to make the interpretation of health and gender\neffects more clear, we present predicted probabilities of\nchoosing sons and daughters based on estimated coeffi-\ncients in the two random effects equations. Mean probabili-\nties (transformed from predicted log-odds) are presented for\nmothers and fathers at minimum and maximum values of\nfunctional health in Figure 1. Three trends are noteworthy\nin this figure. First, daughters are generally preferred to\nsons by both fathers and mothers. Second, sons are pre-\nferred more by fathers than by mothers, and daughters are\npreferred more by mothers than by fathers. Third and most\ninteresting, Figure 1 shows that functionally impaired par-\nents are more likely than healthier parents to prefer daugh-\nters over sons not because daughters are chosen more often\nby the more impaired, but because sons are chosen less\noften by them. Sons may be viewed as less reliable or less\nwilling providers of services required by functionally im-\npaired parents. In contrast, functionally impaired parents are\nas likely as healthy parents to choose daughters, suggesting\nthat the preference for daughters is tied to factors other than\nneed. The net effect of these results is that the daughter-son\ndifferential grows with increasing disability, almost tripling\nin favor of daughters. Fathers and mothers with no disabil-\nity are, respectively, 1.2 and 2 times more likely to favor\ndaughters over sons, whereas those with the worst disability\nare 3.5 and 6 times more likely to prefer daughters.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this analysis we have investigated the factors that pre-\ndispose older parents to move closer to or in with their\nadult children. We have operationalized the process as a se-\nries of hierarchical choices related to mobility, mobility to-\nward children, and choice of children. As expected, greater\npersonal resources of health and wealth and poorer environ-\nmental conditions in terms of neighborhood safety and\nhousing quality predispose older parents to move. Inade-\nquate environmental conditions provide incentives for resi-\ndential mobility, and better physical and financial capabili-\nties enable the respondent to meet the demands and costs of\nmobility better.\nNone of the health variables influenced the expectation\nof achieving greater geographic proximity with adult chil-\ndren. However, living alone elevated the importance of poor\nself-rated health in predisposing older parents to move\ncloser to or in with children. This finding suggests the im-\nportance of considering living arrangements when assess-\ning the impact of physical impairment on mobility. That the\navailability of a household partner buffers the need of vul-\nnerable parents for proximate children suggests that adult\nchildren function as a \"second line\" of support. This is con-\nsistent with the notion that adult children serve as latent re-\nsources in the support system of older parents, emerging\nmostly when the need is greatest.\nThere is evidence as well that older parents desire greater\nproximity with their children when at least one child is\nmore affluent than they are. This suggests that late-life re-\nturn migration is guided more by self-interest than by altru-\nism toward less prosperous children. This principle stands\nas a mirror image to that of the return migration of econom-\nTable 6.

Among\nthose who express expectations of moving closer to chil-\ndren, there is no discrimination based on differences in eco-\nnomic well-being among children. In other words, the influ-\nence of the perceived economic well-being of adult\nchildren appears to be an effect of the propensity of parents\nto have more affluent children.\nIt is interesting that parents who have at least one child\nwho owns a home are no more likely to expect to move\ncloser to or in with children than are parents with no such\nchildren; however, those parents who expect to move closer\nto or in with children are influenced in their choice by\nwhich children are homeowners. That parents discriminate\namong their children based on their home ownership sug-\ngests that this factor is an important characteristic in select-\ning the target child for return migration. The space, re-\nsources, and residential stability associated with owning a\nhome may make the home-owning child a more attractive\nchoice for geographic convergence, especially when coresi-\ndence is the intended goal.\nOlder parents, especially those in poor functional health,\nare more likely to choose proximity to daughters over prox-\nimity to sons. However, the perceived utility of geographic\nconvergence with daughters is not heightened when care-\ngiving needs of parents are most probable. Child gender\npreferences under conditions of physical need may have\nmore to do with the avoidance of sons as less likely sources\nof instrumental support. This reflects both the closer rela-\ntionships that parents generally have with daughters and the\nexpectation that daughters may be more willing than sons\nto provide many forms of support. Our results from the\nHLM model suggest that impaired older parents are less in-\nclined than healthier parents to view sons as desirable tar-\ngets for return migration. Daughters are generally pre-\nferred, regardless of parental impairment.\nSelf-rated health in conjunction with living arrange-\nments--but not ADL, IADL, or cognitive health--predicts\nolder parents' expectations of moving closer to their children.\nThat self-appraisals are more important than more objective\naspects of health in predisposing parents to seek proximity to\nchildren suggests a subjective basis for the predisposition of\nolder parents to return to the communities and households of\ntheir children. However, it remains the task for future re-\nsearchers to determine whether subjective measures of health\npredict subsequent mobility behavior as strongly as they do\nmobility expectations. The finding that functional ability\n(IADL) differentiates whether daughters or sons are chosen\nsuggests that objective health may emerge as a more impor-\ntant factor in assistance-related mobility when the potential\ntargets of return migration are less abstract and their (per-\nceived) qualifications are more personified.\nThere are several limitations in our analyses that merit\ndiscussion. First, our measure of expectations blurs the dis-\ntinction between moving closer to a child and moving to\nthe household of a child. Although less is known about\nattitudes toward intergenerational proximity, research on\ncoresidence has shown that older people do not necessarily\nexpect adult children to house their aging parents (Logan &\nSpitze, 1995). In terms of actual geographic mobility, con-\nvergence between older parents and their children that does\nnot result in coresidence is more common than convergence\nthat results in a shared household. One study found that the\nproportion of older adults increasing proximity to a child\nwas three times that of those making a transition to coresi-\ndence with a child (Silverstein, 1995), yet that research also\nrevealed that the same process of vulnerability (poor health\nand widowhood) governed intergenerational convergence\nas it did intergenerational coresidence. Nevertheless, be-\ncause unmeasured factors related to norms, values, and per-\nsonality may differentially influence the propensity of par-\nents to move closer to children and their propensity to\nmove in with children, we advise caution in the interpreta-\ntion of the effects of variables likely to be correlated with\nthese unobserved factors.\nThis study has advanced our understanding of elderly re-\nturn migration by explicitly examining the role of intergen-\nerational processes in late-life mobility decisions. Notably,\nhalf of the parents who expected to move also expected to\nmove closer to or in with their children, suggesting their im-\nportance in the migration considerations of older parents.\nWe stress that mobility models continue to focus on both\npersonal characteristics of the potential migrant, as well as\nthe constraints and opportunities offered by members of the\ngreater social environment--especially those of children\nwhen caregiving to the parent is at stake. For example, by\nconsidering characteristics of adult children we have pro-\nvided a nuanced perspective on the importance of proximity\nto daughters over sons. Disabled parents are disinclined to\nseek proximity to sons, but prefer proximity to daughters at\nthe same higher rates as healthier parents. Our results have\nrelevance, as well, to the influence of sociohistorical change\non intergenerational relations in aging families of the future.\nOne implication of our finding regarding stepchildren is re-\nlated to the proliferation of blended families starting with\nthe baby boomers: As a result of divorce and remarriage,\nthis cohort may reach old age with more stepchildren and\nfewer opportunities to engage in return migration.\nOverall, our results suggest that adult children are impor-\ntant--but contingent--resources for older parents. Adult\nchildren are perceived as potential sources of support when\ntheir parents live alone and rate their health as poor, a\nmodel of intergenerational relations that is consistent with\nthe concept of the \"latent kin matrix\" (Riley, 1983). How-\never, it is not possible to determine from these data if the\nchildren who are chosen are themselves in favor of geo-\ngraphic convergence with their parents. Whether parents'\nexpectations for greater proximity are mirrored by their\nchildren is undoubtedly related to the validity of the as-\nsumptions on which their expectations are based. In addi-\ntion, children's characteristics, especially those related to\nnonnormative events (e.g., unemployment and divorce),\nmay be more important factors in child-initiated conver-\ngence with parents. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that\nadult children are important pull factors in the return migra-\ntion decisions of older parents, implying that parents' antic-\nipated mobility is constrained to some degree by the type of\nchildren they have. Future research examining how expec-\ntations for mobility match with actual mobility and how ex-\npected target children match with actual target children will\nshed light on the process linking subjective and objective\ndimensions of solidarity between generations in the older\nfamily.\n"
