    "abstract": "Abstract\nPositive effects of aesthetically appreciated designs have long been studied and confirmed since the\n19th century: such designs are more enjoyable, they are more forgivable for glitches and can\nincrease users' performance. In the field of information visualization, studies of aesthetics are still\na niche approach. In the current study, we aim to specifically understand which parameters in a\nvisualization of node-link diagrams make them aesthetically pleasing-an important extension\nto already existing research on usability and readability aspects. We investigated how the shape\nof the outline of such diagrams influences the aesthetic judgments on two of the most important\ndimensions of aesthetic appeal: beauty and interest. We employed different outlines to node-link\ndiagrams and compared them with uniformly filled shapes, varying two important variables\ntypically impacting aesthetics: complexity and curvature. This was done for a short (100 ms)\nand ad libitum presentation time. Diagrams with curvier outlines were perceived as more\nbeautiful, while diagrams with more complex outlines were considered to be more interesting.\nCorresponding author:\nClaus-Christian Carbon, University of Bamberg, Markusplatz 3, 96047 Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany.\nEmail: ccc@experimental-psychology.com\nCreative Commons CC BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/\nopen-access-at-sage).\ni-Perception\njournals.sagepub.com/home/ipe\nThese dependencies already exist for presaccadic perception (100 ms) and are slightly stronger for\nunlimited presentation time.

It can also be defined in a very much broader sense to\nunderline the relevance of aesthetics for a series of cognitive and affective processes:\n``To understand what people appreciate, like, love, or prefer, and why they do so is of\nessential relevance for everyday life events where a clear rational basis for decision making\nIndividuals from various disciplines have tried to understand the notion of aesthetics by\napplying the tools available to them: Philosophers tried to explain it using human language,\nartists investigated the meaning and the boundaries of aesthetics by producing pieces of art\nand exposing them to human judgment, cognitive psychologists explored it by applying\nstatistical analysis to the results of controlled user studies measuring human responses,\nand mathematicians tried to measure it defining a plethora of analytic functions.\nIt is not surprising that in the field of Information Visualization (InfoVis--the study of\nvisual representations of abstract data to be optimally processed by humans), which deals\nwith visual representations of data, the investigation of aesthetics to increase insight was\nlisted as one of the ten most important open problems: ``Engineering aesthetics into\ninformation visualization remains a challenge'' (Chen, 2005, p. 15). The importance of this\nproblem is explained by previous investigations indicating that aesthetics can positively affect\napparent and actual usability (Kurosu & Kashimura, 1995; Norman, 2002; Tractinsky, Katz,\n& Ikar, 2000) and is, more generally, related to positive mental states, promoting problem-\nsolving abilities (Fredrickson, 1998; Isen, Daubman, & Nowicki, 1987). Aesthetics plays a\nsignificant role in a system's overall attractiveness (Carbon & Leder, 2005; Tractinsky,\nCokhavi, & Kirschenbaum, 2004) as a significant incentive for initial use and beyond--it\ngives pleasure to the user (Biederman & Vessel, 2006)!\nIn the field of Graph Drawing, the term ``aesthetics'' has been heavily used; however,\n``aesthetics'' refers there to metrics on node-link diagrams that intuitively determine their\nusability and readability (Kaufmann & Wagner, 2001), rather than to the aesthetic quality of\ntheir appearance. Examples of such metrics are, inter alia, number of edge1 crossings, number\nof edge bends, and angular resolution (refer to Figure 1). The connection of those metrics to\nuser performance has been studied empirically (e.g., Huang, Hong, & Eades, 2006; Huang,\nWare, Purchase, Colpoys, & McGill, 2002). Node-link diagrams have been empirically\nstudied from the perspective of enjoyment (Saket, Scheidegger, & Kobourov, 2016) and\nsubjective usability prospects (Huang et al., 2006; Purchase, Allder, & Carrington, 2002;\nPurchase, Hamer, et al., 2012). However, the extent to which these metrics determine the\naesthetics in the sense of perceived beauty of node-link diagrams is far from being\nunderstood.\nIn several experiments (Dwyer et al., 2009; Purchase, Pilcher, & Plimmer, 2012; van Ham\n& Rogowitz, 2008), researchers asked participants to create node-link diagrams themselves\nby using various interactive environments which allowed for operations of node movements\nand edge modifications. The studies similarly showed that users tend to minimize edge\ncrossings. Some other evident properties that participants payed attention to were:\nrevealing the graph clustering, and in opposite, maintaining similar distances between\nnodes, enclosing clusters within bounding hulls, symmetrizing, keeping the edges short,\nand placing the node with the highest degree centrally or above.\nThe Present Study\nMotivated by the finding of van Ham and Rogowitz (2008) that observers construe a\nbounding hull to ``visually delineate'' (p. 1339) a cluster of nodes in a diagram, we asked\nourselves whether such a simple characteristic like the shape of a node diagram's outline\nmight be a parameter of aesthetic appeal worthwhile to study. To dig into the core of this\nquestion, in the present study, we only look at the outline of the whole node-link diagram\nrather on outlines of the individual clusters. This focus is grounded in Gestalt theory of\nperception: Boundary edges and contours contribute to the separation of figure from the\nground (see also Wong & Sun, 2006) and thus are among the most important distinctive\nfeatures that make a graph a distinctive, self-contained object.\nSince people generally prefer and enjoy objects that seem beautiful to them (Norman,\n2002), we investigated, first of all, the subjective ratings of beauty of node-link diagrams.\nBeauty is probably ``the'' most important variable in aesthetics all along, starting in\nphilosophy of aesthetics (e.g., Kant, 1790/1922) up to very recent psychological theories\n(e.g., Reber, Schwarz, & Winkielman, 2004)--it is also the concept mostly referred\nto when people have to judge the aesthetics of objects (Jacobsen, Buchta, Ko\n\u00a8 hler, &\nSchroger, 2004) or when they are asked to describe artworks (Augustin, Carbon,\n& Wagemans, 2012) or design products such as cars or clothing (Augustin, Wagemans, &\nFigure 1. An example of optimization of various metrics for a construction of a readable node-link diagram:\n(a) An arbitrary node-link diagram, (b) a different node-link diagram of the same graph, where two edges are\nredrawn using bent polylines to reduce the number of crossings, (c) the nodes are repositioned to achieve a\nstraight-line drawing without crossings, and (d) the nodes are repositioned to make the angles around nodes\nas even as possible.\nCarbon et al. 3\nCarbon, 2012). It is also known that beauty alone is not enough to keep the viewers\ninvestigating a visual stimulus (Silvia, 2005).\nThere is actually evidence that interest, as a variable known to indicate potential longer\ntermed engagement with respective stimuli, predates moments of insight, that is, experiences\nof suddenly understanding a complex visual structure (Muth, Raab, & Carbon, 2015). Thus,\nalongside with beauty, we followed the idea of Silvia (2005) and investigated the interest\ntriggered by the stimuli. There is an analog to these ideas from the area of display design,\nwhere it is recommended to create displays that at first glance are aesthetically interesting and\nconvey information on closer examination (Fogarty, Forlizzi, & Hudson, 2001).\nCurvature has been identified as a typical physical predictor of beauty and is being\npreferred against angularity in many object classes (for an overview Gomez-Puerto,\nMunar, & Nadal, 2016), for instance concrete consumer products (Westerman et al.,\nmeaningless or abstracted material such as polygons (Silvia & Barona, 2009)--Bar and Neta\n(2006) even claimed quite generally ``Humans prefer curved visual objects'', a finding which\nwas also replicated in the haptic domain (see Carbon & Jakesch, 2013; Jakesch & Carbon,\n2011). This general preference is not without doubt, especially when specific designs are\nsusceptible to Zeitgeist effects (Carbon, 2010), which however seem to play no essential\nrole in the present study addressing graphs and mere shapes with no direct connection to\nproducts or objects. General positive associative factors with curved shapes documented by\nPalumbo, Ruta, and Bertamini (2015) seem to be much more important in the present study,\nso we included curvature as a possible predictor for beauty.\nComplexity is another prominent candidate for modulating preferences. There are\nindications that complexity is a good predictor for interest (see Muth et al., 2015). How\ncomplexity is exactly related to beauty remains unsure as some claim parabolic functions with\nmedium complex stimuli showing the highest hedonic value (Berlyne, 1970, 1971)--a\nconstruct strongly related to beauty--, while others have empirically revealed simple linear\nrelationships (e.g., Nadal, Munar, Marty, & Cela-Conde, 2010); very recent research even\nchallenges any of these strict views, as large individual differences of the link between\ncomplexity and preferences have been documented ever since (Gucluturk, Jacobs, & van\nLier, 2016). Different ranges or distributions of complexity across employed stimuli might\nbe the cause of this contradiction. The usage of different stimulus classes across studies could\nbe another factor for this discrepancy, as each class of stimuli might have a specific maximum\nof complexity. In a recent study, Adkins and Norman (2016) studied snowflake silhouettes\nand computer-generated solid objects of various complexity and observed that the most and\nleast complex objects were perceived as being the most beautiful, while for the snowflakes, the\nresults were more uniform. Actually, most participants perceived only the complex\nsnowflakes as very beautiful.\nWe preselected a set of shapes that vary in their complexity and curvature and used these\nshapes as outlines for node-link diagrams. We controlled the appearance of the node-link\ndiagrams by only changing their boundaries and by keeping the drawings of the actual graphs\nsimilar. This way we aim to find out whether the perceived beauty of the visualization can be\ninfluenced without changing the values of visualization metrics that possibly affect the\nusability of these visualizations. To understand whether the beauty of the node-link\ndiagrams can be predicted by the shape of their outlines, we conducted the experiment\nboth for node-link diagrams and for pure shapes (Figure 2). To further test whether the\noutline of the node-link diagrams contribute the first impression they make, we investigated\nall research questions with a short, presaccadic presentation time (PT \u00bc 100 ms) and\ncompared the results to a presentation with unlimited time.\nStudy\nMethod\nRationale. Our first goal was to investigate whether the curvature and the complexity of the\noutlines of node-link diagrams influence the perceived beauty and trigger interest. An\nexistence of such an influence can give hints to the designers of node-link diagrams on\nhow to attract a viewer's attention to investigate the node-link diagram.\nOur second goal was to understand whether the beauty and the interest ratings are similar\nfor the shapes and for the node-link diagrams using those shapes as outlines. This is an\nimportant question, as we know much more about the beauty of shapes than about the\nbeauty of node-link diagrams. A positive answer to this question would give us hints on\nwhat node-link diagrams should look like to be attractive to humans.\nOur third goal was to understand whether the very first impression of a node-link\ndiagram's beauty is different from a judgment after a more thorough visual inspection. To\ninvestigate this question, we utilize Norman's (2005) simple human perception model which\ndistinguishes three levels of perception: (a) The visceral level is responsible for the initial\njudgment of things, our intuitive reactions, for example, responsible for identification of\ndangerous situations. (b) The behavioral level is responsible for automated routines of\nperception and action, for example, playing piano and driving a car. (c) The reflective level\nis responsible for conscious thinking and access of memories. To capture the intuitive\nresponses of the participants, staying closer to the visceral level of perception, we exposed\nthe participants to the stimuli for 100 ms, a time interval before the first saccade, the first eye\nmovement away from the initial fixation point, usually takes place. We compared this to a\nsecond condition, where--ceteris paribus--the participants are exposed to the same stimuli\nfor unlimited time, which we consider representative for a more behavioral mode of\nperception sensu Norman.\nProcedure. Figure 3 shows a brief illustration of the experimental design. To avoid a carry-\nover effect (assessments for node-link diagrams influencing the shape assessments and vice\nversa), we randomly assigned participants to two different groups, one exposed to shapes,\nand the other exposed to node-link diagrams. In the following, we describe the design of the\nexperiment for the shapes. The procedure with node-link diagrams is identical, with the only\ndifference that instead of shapes, node-link diagrams of graphs using that shape as outline\nwere employed. We tried to keep the study short ($10 min), to avoid boredom of the\nparticipants and therefore lack of concentration.\nFigure 2. Example of a stimulus: (a) a shape and (b) a node-link diagram using the shape as an outline.\nCarbon et al. 5\nThe study was divided into two blocks: In the first block, the PT for stimuli was 100 ms,2\nwhereas in the second block, the stimuli remained on screen until key press. Each block\ncomprised four subblocks where we asked for participants' assessments stimuli regarding\ncurvature, complexity, interest, and beauty, respectively. The order of subblocks was fixed.\nCurvature and complexity were regarded as independent ``object-specific'' variables, whereas\nbeauty and interest were treated as dependent variables.\nSince perceptual differences between stimuli are in many cases quite small, we looked for a\nmeasurement that is sensitive enough to uncover such subtleties. The typical employed rating\nscale method is a very efficient but not the most sensitive method to capture preference\nassessments. In contrast, paired comparisons offer much better sensitivity than rating\nscales in detecting differences (see Eisenberg & Dirks, 1995), so we employed such a high-\nsensitive pairwise comparison task, especially as we used a PT limitation paradigm. The\nparticipants were asked to select whether the left or right stimulus was ``clearly more''\n(\u00bc3), ``more'' (\u00bc2), or ``weakly more'' (\u00bc1), for example, curvy (or: complex, interesting,\nbeautiful, respectively) than the right or left stimulus, respectively.\nFigure 3. Course of the experiment. Pairs of stimuli shown in the subblocks for curvature, complexity,\ninterest, and beauty are denoted by SCU\n, and SBE\n, respectively.\nPT \u00bc presentation time.\nEvery subblock (e.g., Subblock 1 curvature) consisted of eight trials, and every trial\npresented two distinct stimuli to the viewer side by side. We kept possible preference\nbiases based on the mere-exposure effect (Zajonc, 2001) constant across stimuli by means\nof counterbalancing. In particular, each stimulus was presented only once within a subblock,\nand therefore each stimulus is seen by the viewer exactly eight times (two PTs by four\nsubblocks). For each subblock, the eight pairs were randomly drawn from the set of all\npossible 120 pairs (refer to stimuli section), and the chosen pairs were not considered for\nthe selection in the following subblocks. Overall, k \u00bc 4 \u00c2 8 \u00bc 32 distinct pairs of stimuli were\nshown in the first block. In the second block, the same 32 pairs were presented, but the order\nof trials was randomized anew within each subblock.\nThe study was implemented on an online platform developed based on Django framework\n(https://www.djangoproject.com)--a free and open-source web framework, written in\nPython. The procedure started with a welcome message and a brief introduction to the\nexperiment. Participants were requested to spontaneously select which stimulus showed the\nregarding variable more than the other stimulus of the pair. For instance, in the first subblock\n(curvature), they were asked ``Which visual object appears more round to you?'' The\nregarding questions of the subsequent blocks were about which object was more complex,\nmore interesting, and more beautiful, respectively. Note: we used ``round'' instead of\n``curved,'' as our pilot studies indicated that participants had a better intuitive\nunderstanding of an item that is ``round'' instead of ``curved'' (see Carbon, 2010).\nIn the first block, each trial started with a centered fixation cross (1000 ms)--for the\nunlimited PT in the second block, this fixation cross was not present to make implicitly\nclear that fast reactions were not demanded for this part of the experiment. Subsequently,\na pair of stimuli was presented side by side (Figure 4) for 100 ms (first block) or as long as the\nparticipant answered the regarding question (second block). In the first block, we masked the\nFigure 4. Screenshot from a trial within the second block.\nCarbon et al. 7\ndisplay subsequently with a backward mask of white noise for 100 ms, in order to minimize\nvisual persistence beyond the time of presentation. The next trial started as soon as the\nparticipant entered an answer by pushing a target button. The whole study took on\naverage 10 minutes per person.\nStimuli. In a preliminary step, we created 138 shapes with different appearances regarding\ncurvature and complexity, as diverse as possible. With an internal expert pilot study with five\nraters, we got ratings for curvature and complexity for all shapes. We calculated the mode for\neach shape and both properties to select a representative shape (best fit) for each of the 16\ncurvature or complexity combinations, since our goal was to investigate how beauty and\ninterest are explained by curvature and complexity. Fleiss' kappa (k) test, a statistical\nmeasure for calculating the reliability of agreement between raters, revealed ``substantial''\ninterrater agreement (according to Landis & Koch, 1977) for the selected shapes: k \u00bc 0.68 for\ncurvature and k \u00bc 0.72 for complexity. See Figure 5 for the finally preselected shape stimuli.\nOn basis of those selected shapes, we constructed node-link diagrams that employ exactly\nthe respective shapes as outlines. As graphs, we used six randomly generated Delaunay\ntriangulations with 200 nodes. These graphs generally have long boundaries, a property\nthat was required to realize sufficiently complex outlines.\nFor constructing a node-link diagram of a graph having a given shape as outline, we used\na force-directed approach (Jacomy, Venturini, Heymann, & Bastian, 2014)--an algorithm\nFigure 5. Finally, selected shapes for the main study (with original numbering of the stimuli originated from\nthe pilot study).\nthat simulates a physical system where the nodes are physical bodies, that attract or repel\neach other dependent of whether the nodes are connected by an edge or not. This physical\nsystem is let go until it achieves an equilibrium. See Figure 6 for a depiction of the algorithmic\nprocedure to create the node-link stimuli.\nInitially, a planar layout was constructed, and the nodes that were suitable to lay on the\nboundary were detected (for the pipeline of the algorithmic procedure, refer to Figure 6).\nThese are not exactly the boundary nodes, since those are usually not enough to mimic the\noutline of the given shape. These nodes are distributed on the outline of the given shape. The\nremaining nodes are put inside the outline, and the force-directed method is run, by keeping\nthe positions of the outer nodes fixed. Finally, the edges that connect two points of the\noutline and do not lie inside the shape are colored gray, to achieve the similarity with the\ngiven shape. Note: Our node-link diagrams are visualizing six planar graphs with very specific\nproperties. By using polyline or curvilinear edges, a similar drawing algorithm could be\napplied to all planar graphs, and the overall appearance of the graph is similar. However,\nthe results have to be generalized with caution for nonplanar graphs, specifically with many\ncrossings.\nFor the k \u00bc (16 \u00c2 15)/2 \u00bc 120 possible pairs of shape stimuli, we generated two images, for\ntwo possible selections of the shape placed on the left. For each shape stimulus and each of\nthe six graphs, we constructed the corresponding graph stimulus, which showed the selected\ngraph within the outline represented by the shape.\nParticipants. To get participants from various backgrounds, we announced the survey on\ndifferent public websites like Reddit3 and Facebook.4 As incentive, five Amazon vouchers\nFigure 6. Depiction of the algorithmic procedure to create the node-link stimuli. Nodes to be placed on\nthe boundary are identified (top-right) and placed on the boundary (bottom-middle), force-directed\nalgorithm is run that preserves the position of the nodes on the boundary (bottom-right).\nCarbon et al. 9\nworth EUR 25 each were raffled among the participants that were willing to take part in the\nlottery and provided us their e-mail address. Those addresses were stored separately from the\nremaining data to protect privacy.\nAltogether N \u00bc 233 people participated in the online study, from which 111 were assigned\nto shape and 122 to graph conditions with average age 29.4 years and 30.9 years, respectively.\nWith respect to gender, 117 were female, 103 male, and 13 stated other. The origin of the\nparticipants was mainly from Germany (71.0%), followed by users from United States\neducation, 6.0% had a PhD, 33.1% a master or diploma degree, 27.0% a bachelor degree,\nand 32.6% indicated high school as highest gained level of education--1.3% declared having\nno education of the asked categories.\nNote: The sample employed in our study was restricted to people with Internet access and\nis biased toward people who consume the websites that we used for recruitment or who were\nassociated with the authors' circle of acquaintances. No other confounding was evident.\nResults and Discussion\nWe incorporated all participants' data in the following analyses. Since the data are based on\npairwise comparisons, we obtained one explicit rating that we further processed in the\nfollowing way: a positive rating for the chosen object and a negative rating with same\nabsolute value for the other. Shapiro\u00adWilk tests indicated that the data were not\nstatistically deviant from being normally distributed.\nWhen time was not restricted, participants took about 3 s to evaluate a graph or a shape,\nwhich indicates that judgments were not just visceral reactions (in Norman's sense), but were\nprocessed with conscious awareness (behavioral level). The mean response time in the\nTo obtain an overview of how the ratings of beauty and interest vary over the two\npresentation types (shapes vs. graph) and the two PTs, we plotted the two dependent\nmeasures beauty and interest for all 2 \u00c2 2 \u00bc 4 experimental conditions (Figure 7). Our first\nperceptual inspection of the data made clear that we revealed a generally high similarity of\nratings across experimental conditions.\nA statistical analysis of the correlations between the dependent variables for both PTs and\nfor all collected variables showed, however, that beauty assessments were seemingly based on\ndifferent features or processes when facing limited (100 ms) compared with ad libitum PT,\nR(16) \u00bc .780, p \u00bc .0004. For interest, we revealed much closer relationship between both PT\nconditions, R(16) \u00bc .871, p < .0001. The high, but still far from perfect relationships between\nPT conditions, point to potential ``microgenetic processes'' (Bachmann, 2000) which have\nalready been progressed quite far when a stimulus of the used kind is presented for only\n100 ms, but where further processing is still going on (Carbon, 2011). Interestingly, such an\nongoing microgenesis was not detectable for the predictors complexity and curvature, which\nshowed nearly perfectly identical assessments at a PT of 100 ms and also in the case of\nindicates that complexity and curvature assessments do not require very deep cognitive\nprocessing as they are reliably processed even under very limited presentation conditions. As\nsuch, both factors might be interpreted more like content factors than style factors following\nthe style-follows-content hypothesis of microgenesis in scene perception (Augustin,\nDefranceschi, Fuchs, Carbon, & Hutzler, 2011; Augustin, Leder, Hutzler, & Carbon, 2008).\nAs we were particularly interested in how beauty and interest can be predicted taking\nour independent variables curvature and complexity simultaneously as predictors,\nwe furthermore conducted two separate linear regression analyses for each PT condition.\nRefer also to Figure 8 for the scatter plots of all four variables plus their interrelationships.\nAs indicated in Table 1, we obtained high rates of explained variances in general.\nBeauty was mainly based on curvature aspects, at 100 ms actually exclusively on curvature.\nWhen PT was not limited, also complexity was taken into account, but here with a negative\nrelationship: the more complex the stimulus, the less participants liked it. With curvature, it\nwas quite similar across PT conditions: The rounder the stimulus was assessed, the higher it\nwas assessed regarding beauty--a shape that is very near to a circular form was appreciated\nthe most. Actually, reports of preferences for round shapes are quite numerous (see Gomez-\nPuerto et al., 2016), so these results were fully expected and reflect typical data from more\ncomplex domains of everyday objects (Westerman et al., 2012), including other modalities\nsuch as the haptic sense (Jakesch & Carbon, 2011).\nFor interest, we gained a very different data pattern: Here the essential factor was always\ncomplexity, with more complex stimuli being assessed more interesting--a finding that is\ncompatible with other domains of visual stimuli such as artworks (Friston, Thornton, &\nGeneral Discussion\nWe investigated the role of curvature and complexity of the outlines of node-link diagrams as\ndrivers for generating interest and aesthetic appeal for the users of such types of graphical\ninformation. Therefore, we let 233 persons evaluate node-link diagrams with various outlines\nas well as shapes comprised by those outlines.\nWe found that curvature is a powerful predictor for beauty, but complexity has also its\nrole when a beholder can inspect the stimulus longer--interestingly, our participants did\nFigure 7. Mean values of (a) beauty and (b) interest for the 2 \u00c2 2 \u00bc 4 experimental conditions, sorted by\ntheir overall mean.\nprefer less complex stimuli under unlimited PT conditions regarding beauty. This supports\nthe findings by Purchase, Hamer, et al. (2012) that node-link diagrams with circular-arc edges\nare liked more than straight line drawings. Taken together, this indicates that such aesthetic\nprinciples, which were often shown for artworks and consumer products, play also a role for\nvisualization of information, for instance, in node-link diagrams.\nFor being interesting, most importantly, the stimuli have to be more complex--curvature\nwas not important for being assessed as interesting. This makes clear that interest is not just a\nfacet of beauty but has its own rules. As interest is an important variable for inducing longer\ntermed attention to a stimulus, this is very important to know.\nFigure 8. Scatter plots for all four variables, including linear regression lines and distributions of ratings.\nThe 4-by-4 plot panel is organized the following way: the top-left to bottom-right diagonal shows the\ndistribution of ratings for curvature, complexity, interest, and beauty, respectively. The upper triangle shows\nthe regarding bivariate relationships, and the lower triangle additionally provides the linear regressions. All\ndata are split by the conditions presentation type (graph vs. shape) and presentation time (100 ms vs. unlimited).\nWe found very similar data pattern for shapes and graphs drawn using those shapes as\noutlines, so the very general rule is that the outline should be optimized with priority,\nespecially if it is about optimizing the beauty of a graph.\nThe differences found between PTs for the employed stimuli point at a difference in the\nconception of beauty that might be explained by a microgenetic view (Bachmann, 2000):\nThe impact of the outline's curvature is greater at second glance, but interest is crucial from\nthe very early beginning and mainly triggered by complexity. This is in line with the idea by\nMuth et al. (2015) that complex visual structures can be perceived as a promise for an\naesthetic riddle. Complexity might just be a good predictor for the degree of information\ndensity and so triggers attention, a cognitive construct that is very much linked with interest.\nThis microgenetic view (i.e., the idea that the final ``percept''--what we eventually\nperceive--is generated by subsequent perceptual subprocesses, see Carbon [2011]) on the\ndynamics of appreciation, has already been established for works of art (Augustin et al.,\n2008, 2011) and does seem to be an interesting avenue for future research. The difference in\nmodel fit we have observed here should be taken as a starting point to target the dynamics of\nperception unfolding over the first few hundreds of milliseconds. Those dynamics of\nunfolding appreciation might have practical implications in situations where information is\ncompeting for observers' attention. Graphs that are appealing at the very first glance might\nbe the ones that get more attention (or even any attention at all).\nSo, there is merit in transferring aesthetic principles into the domain of information\nvisualizations. We have shown that node-edge-structures without semantics, that is,\nsyntactically well-formed node-graphs generated by random data, are appreciated in a way we\nmight compare to the appreciation of artworks. There are two promising directions from here:\n(1) Expand the syntactical approach (as we have focused on the graphs' outlines here; one\nmight think of regarding shape and length of edges).\n(2) Start to introduce meaning by depicting real-world data (which would allow evaluating if\nmore beautiful graphs are also more understandable).\nOur node-link diagrams were generated by an algorithm and did not allow for any deeper\ninsight. A further study should address riddle-solving aspects of appreciation by using node-\nTable 1.

This would, in Norman's (2005)\nterms, add the (more) reflective level and allow for a closer look at the interaction of visual\nand semantic properties.\n"
