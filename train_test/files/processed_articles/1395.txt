Separate logistic models\nwere developed with work related asthma and work related wheezing as outcomes. Work related\nasthma was defined as affirmative response to questions on self reported physician diagnosed asthma\nand work related symptoms of rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma. Work related wheezing was defined\nas affirmative response to questions on self reported wheezing or whistling in the chest in the previous\n12 months and work related symptoms of rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma. All analyses were\nadjusted for age, sex, smoking, and atopy.\nindustries identified at risk of work related asthma and wheeze included the entertainment industry;\nagriculture, forestry, and fishing; construction; electrical machinery; repair services; and lodging\nplaces.

Future intervention\nstrategies need to be developed for effective control and prevention of asthma in the workplace.\nOccupational asthma (OA) presently is the most often\nreported diagnosis of work related occupational respi-\nratory disease in developed nations, and over 250\nworkplace agents have been identified as specific causes of\nestimated that about 24% of the total workforce, employed in\nthe United States industries, was exposed to occupational\nasthmagens.2 In the United Kingdom surveillance of work\nrelated and occupational respiratory diseases (SWORD)\nproject, OA accounted for 26% of reported occupational lung\ndisease,3 whereas in British Columbia, OA made up 52% of\nreported occupational lung disease.4 Gannon et al reported an\nannual incidence of OA of 43/million among workers in the\nWest Midlands region in the United Kingdom.5 It is estimated\nthat, in the United States, there are over 20 million workers\npotentially exposed to occupational asthmagens; 9 million of\nthese are exposed to established sensitisers and irritants.6\nEstimates of the proportion of asthma that is attributed to\nworkplace exposures vary widely, probably due to several fac-\ntors, including lack of recognition of occupational factors,7 a\ngeneral absence of statewide surveillance systems for\nasthma,8 variations in the case definitions for OA, and differ-\nences among denominator populations. Thus, anywhere from\n2% to 36% of all adult asthma has been attributed to OA, both\nin the United States and other developed nations.7 9\u00ad12 In a\nrecent review of 43 attributable risk estimates, Blanc and\nToren13 found the median (range) value for attributable risk of\noccupationally related asthma to be 9% (2%\u00ad33%).\nCertain occupational groups are known to be at particularly\nhigh risk of developing OA, including western red cedar\nworkers,1 chemical workers exposed to isocyanate,14 construc-\ntion workers,15 bakers, and cleaners,16 textile workers,17 animal\nHowever, to our knowledge, no national estimates of the\nassociation between asthma and asthmatic symptoms with\nindustry are available in the United States. The national health\nand nutrition examination survey (NHANES) provides a rich\npopulation based dataset to identify high risk industries. This\nstudy analysed data gathered from the third NHANES\n(NHANES III) to estimate the prevalence of work related\nasthma and wheezing, describe workers at high risk of devel-\noping asthma and asthma-like symptoms, and identify high\nrisk industries that could be targeted for future intervention.\nCenter for Health Statistics, to collect data on the health and\nnutrition of a representative sample of the non-institutionalised\nUnited States population.

There were no direct questions asked in the NHANES III\nproject to assess the proportion of asthma related to workplace\nexposure. We therefore constructed two working definitions of\nwork related asthma: (a) physician diagnosed work related\nasthma (work related asthma), based on responses in the\naffirmative to both questions, \"has a doctor ever told you that\nyou had asthma?\" (Question HAC1E) and \"are any of the\nsymptoms wheezing, whistling, stuffy, itchy, or runny nose,\nwatery, itchy eyes brought on by work environment?\" (Hereby\nreferred to as work related conjunctivits, rhinitis, or asthma;\nquestion HAL14D); and (b) symptom based on work related\nasthma (work related wheezing), based on those who\nresponded in the affirmative to both questions, \"have you had\nwheezing or whistling in your chest at any time in the past 12\nmonths? (item HAL6)\" and \"are any of the symptoms: wheez-\ning, whistling, stuffy, itchy, or runny nose, watery, itchy eyes\nbrought on by work environment? (item HAL14D)\".\nBased on the response to the question on work related\nconjunctivits, rhinitis, or asthma (item HAL14D), a subset of\n10 391 subjects from the NHANES III dataset was selected.\nPeople who responded that they were not working at the time of\ninterview (n=3564) were excluded, leaving the total sample\nsize of 6827. The variable used to define work related asthma\nwas created by combining only those subjects who responded in\nconcordant pair approach was used to define work related\nwheezing and yielded a sample of 4573, which was included in\nthe final analysis. Thus, the final sample included 188 cases of\nwork related asthma and 454 cases of work related wheezing.\nOther variables included in the analysis were atopy (defined\nas an affirmative response to the question \"has a doctor ever\ntold you that you had hay fever?\"), smoking (non-smokers,\npast smokers, and current smokers), race or ethnicity\n(non-hispanic whites, non-hispanic blacks, Mexican-\nAmericans, and other), and poverty income ratio (below pov-\nerty level, above poverty level). The poverty income ratio was\ncomputed as a ratio of the annual family income as the\nnumerator and the poverty threshold, the age of the family\nreference person, and the calendar year in which the family\nwas interviewed as the denominator.\nDefinition of industry categories\nThe NHANES III questionnaire included a comprehensive\nsection on occupational history. Questions related to the longest\nindustry in which the person worked (item HAS19R) were\nasked of all adult study subjects interviewed during the survey.\nThe longest industry of work was defined as, \"what kind of\nbusiness or industry did you work in the longest time?\"\nOriginally, industrial categories were classified based on catego-\nries defined by the 1980 United States Bureau of the Census.21\nThe longest held industry information was available for 6557\n(96.04%) eligible subjects.

The industrial hygienist was blinded to\nthe subject's asthma status.\nA referent industry category was defined at the outset. Ref-\nerent categories were constructed by collapsing industry\ncategories where the potential of exposure to asthmagens\nwere minimal and included \"banking and other finance\"\n(code 29); \"insurance and real estate\" (code 30); \"social serv-\nices\" (code 41); and \"public administration, except justice,\npublic order, and safety\" (code 44)\". All other industries, not\nincluded in the referent category, were considered to be at risk.\nStatistical analysis\nDue to the complex multistage survey design used in the\nNHANES III, STATA statistical software (STATA, College\nStation, TX), which allows incorporation of sampling weights,\nstrata, and primary sampling units, was used to analyze the\ndata. The sampling weights include adjustments for non-\nresponse and unequal probability of selection used in the\nsampling design. Simple descriptive statistics were used to\ndescribe the study population and calculate the prevalences,\nexpressed as percentages, of work related asthma and wheeze,\nfollowed by multivariate logistic regression analysis to explore\nthe association between each industry group and the outcome\nvariable. All odds ratios (ORs) calculated were initially\nadjusted for age, sex, race or ethnicity, poverty income ratio,\natopy, and smoking. However, addition of race or ethnicity and\npoverty income ratio in the model did not change the OR sig-\nnificantly and were removed from the final analysis to keep\nthe model simple.\nThe population attributable risk (PAR) was calculated sepa-\nrately for work related asthma and work related wheezing\nusing the following formula:\nPAR= Pe (OR-1)/OR\nwhere Pe=prevalence of exposure among cases (industrial\ncategories was used as a surrogate measure of exposure);\nOR=ORs for at risk industries. The ORs were adjusted for age,\nsex, atopy, and smoking. For calculation of PAR, the initially\ndefined referent category was used as a low risk industrial\ncategory and all other industrial groups were categorised as at\nrisk industries (table 1).\nRESULTS\nTable 2 shows the general demographic characteristics of the\nstudy population. The estimated prevalences of work related\nasthma and work related wheezing were 3.7% and 11.5%\nrespectively. The prevalence of atopy was highest in the age\nthe prevalence rates of work related asthma and wheeze did\nnot change significantly (3.8% and 13% respectively, table 3).\nThe overall prevalence of medically diagnosed asthma, wheez-\ning, and work related symptoms of wheezing, conjunctivitis,\nrhinitis, and asthma are shown in table 3. Table 4 shows\nprevalence of work related asthma and wheeze by selected\ncharacteristics. Atopic people have a higher prevalence of work\nrelated asthma and wheeze than non-atopic people. Current\nsmokers have a higher prevalence of work related wheeze than\nnon-smokers and ex-smokers. However, no differences were\nfound for work related asthma.\nRisk of work related asthma by industry\nTable 5 presents a summary of risk of work related asthma.\nThere were considerable variations in risk by industry.

The working\ndefinitions of work related asthma and work related wheezing\nused in this study, have not previously been validated. For sev-\neral industries, we were not able to assess the risk reliably, as\nindicated by wide 95% CIs, due to few cases. It is possible that\nworkers self selected themselves out of the industries where\nexposures may worsen their asthmatic symptoms. This healthy\nworker effect is a common problem in all cross sectional epide-\nmiological studies. We tried to minimise this effect by using\nlongest industry worked in our analysis. There were about 3500\nsubjects who, in response to the question on work related con-\njunctivitis, rhinitis, and asthma (item HAL14D), reported that\nthey were not working at the time of interview. Further analy-\nsis of these subjects indicated that a high proportion of them\nreported medically diagnosed asthma and wheezing. It is possi-\nble that these subjects left their job or stopped working because\nof their asthma and represent serious cases, which would have\nresulted in an underestimation of the prevalence of work related\nasthma and wheezing in this analysis. Many comparisons were\nmade in our analysis; therefore it is possible that some of our\nresults may have been due to chance alone. There is a paucity of\nempirical research in which analysis has been by industrial\ngroup, which limited our comparisons with the literature. Our\nanalysis was limited to use of the self reported industrial group,\ncollapsed into categories, and was used as a surrogate measure\nof workplace exposure. This further limited our ability to com-\npare directly the findings with others reported in the literature\nfor certain industrial groups. Finally, the definition used for\natopy may have also led to some misclassification, as some\natopic people may not have had symptoms of hay fever. Given\nthe strength of the association found, however, between this\nmeasure of atopy and both work related asthma and work\nrelated wheezing, the influence of this misclassification is likely\nto have been small.\nThe prevalence of work related asthma was 3.7%, whereas\n11.5% of survey respondents reported work related wheeze.\nThese rates are within the wide range reported in various\nrelated asthma and 27% for work related wheezing, suggest-\ning that an estimated 27%\u00ad37% of cases of work related\nasthma and wheezing in the NHANES III adult study popula-\ntion would have been prevented if exposures encountered in\nthe at risk industries were eliminated, assuming that the\nexposure is causally related to the disease. These figures are\nwithin the range reported in earlier population based\nstudies,7 12 13 but higher than those reported in studies from\nvarious other industrialised countries.22\u00ad24 Blanc and Toren,13 in\na recent review of 43 attributable risk estimates from various\ncountries, found that the estimates of attributable risk of\nasthma due to occupational exposures varied from 2% to 33%\n(median, 15% in high quality studies).\nThe higher estimates of PAR found in our analysis could be\ndue to several reasons, including differences in study popula-\ntion and case definitions used to define work related asthma\nor the approach used to classify industries. Alternately, the\nlower PAR reported in other countries may reflect true differ-\nences in industrial and occupational exposures encountered in\nthose regions.\nThis study identified several industrial groups that were\nassociated with work related asthma and work related wheez-\ning. An increased risk of work related asthma or work related\nwheezing was found in agriculture, forestry and fishing;\nentertainment industry; educational services; construction;\ntextile mill products; electrical machinery, equipment, and\nsupplies; repair services; and lodging places.\nA more than two-fold increased risk of work related asthma\nand wheeze was identified for the agriculture, forestry, and\nTable 6 Estimated prevalence and OR (95% CI) of work related wheezing by industry in the NHANES III adult study\nCodes Industry Cases* Prevalence (%) SE (%) OR 95% CI\n*Total number of observed cases=438, 16 cases had missing information on occupational history and were not included in the analysis; referent group.\nWork related asthma by industry among United States workers 509\nwww.occenvmed.com\ngroup.bmj.com\noem.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nfishing industry. Working in the agriculture sector is\nassociated with numerous occupational health hazards. This\nindustrial group includes farmers and poultry workers,\namong others, with potential exposures to various respiratory\nirritants and potential asthmagens including organic dust,\nnumerous organic chemicals--for example, insecticides,\nbiocides, fertilisers--various plant antigens, and various other\nchemicals.16 Several studies have reported an increased risk of\nasthma and asthmatic symptoms among agriculture workers\nincluding farmers, poultry workers, and grain elevator\nworkers. Farmers were reported to have a similarly high risk of\nindustrialised countries.10 22 Farmers accounted for about half\nof reported cases of occupational asthma in Finland in 1990.25\nPoultry workers have also been shown to have an increased\nrisk of work related asthma and asthmatic symptoms26 27 and\nsignificantly lower lung function values.28 Similarly, increases\nin the prevalence of asthma have also been reported among\ngrain elevator workers.29 The consistently increased risk found\namong agricultural workers in earlier studies, and the similar\nresults found in this analysis strongly suggest a causal associ-\nation between agricultural exposures and asthma.\nA three-fold increased risk for work related wheezing,but not\nwork related asthma, was found for the construction industrial\ngroup.Construction is one of the largest industries in the United\nStates. Workers in the construction industry may be exposed to\nincreased concentrations of construction dust, wood dust, vari-\nous paints,asphalt,and dust from concrete and masonry,as well\nas gases and vapours. Few population based studies have\nreported similar associations in this industry17 30; others found\nno such association.22 24 It is possible that the risk of asthma\nvaries within the construction industry and the choice of study\npopulation may in part be responsible for the inconsistency\nfound in the results. In the construction industry, exposure to\nwood dust has been reported to be associated with increased\nrisk of asthma.31 32 We did not find any association with work\nrelated asthma. This could partly be due to the healthy worker\neffect,as subjects with asthma may tend to avoid working in the\ndusty trades. Alternately, work related wheezing could be due to\nconditions other than asthma--for example, chronic bronchitis\nor emphysema. However, we adjusted our analysis for smoking,\nwhich may have diminished the effect if any. Although we did\nnot find an increased risk for work related asthma, the signifi-\ncantly increased risk found with work related wheeze suggests\nthat workers in the construction industry may be at a greater\nrisk than reported in earlier studies.\nA two-fold increased risk of work related wheeze, but not\nwork related asthma, in the textile industrial group was found\nin this analysis. Workers in a textile industry are potentially\nexposed to cotton and other fibre dusts, textile dyes, and fab-\nric printing and treatment chemicals. Textile workers have\noften been reported to have an excess risk of asthma.17 23 In a\ncommunity based case-control study of risk factors of work\nrelated asthma in different occupational groups in Singapore,\nNg et al17 reported more than a five-fold increased risk of\nasthma among textile workers. In a study by Zuskin et al,33\noccupational asthma was present among 6% of workers\nexposed to textile dye. These same authors, in another study,\nreported significant changes in pulmonary function indices\nacross the shift among synthetic textile workers.34 Some\nworkers may also have been exposed to cotton dust, which can\ncause byssinosis, a condition clinically similar to asthma.\nRisk in the industrial group electrical machinery, equip-\nment, and supplies is less well recognised. Our study found a\ntwofold increase in the risk of work related asthma and\nwheezing in this industrial group. The results, however, were\nsignificant only for work related wheeze. The industries\nincluded in this group are involved in processes with potential\nfor exposure to several irritants and allergens including metal\nmachining fluids, lubricants, solvents, paints and coatings,\nadhesives, soldering fluxes, and various chemicals used in\nsemiconductor manufacturing. Several case reports have\ndescribed the development of occupational asthma from\nexposure to fumes generated from soldering flux.35 36 However,\nin a cross sectional study of female workers doing manual sol-\ndering with flux cored solder wire and using administrative\nstaff as controls, Lee et al37 did not find any increase in the\nprevalence of asthmatic symptoms, nor did they detect any\ncases of occupational asthma. Workers with 5 or more years of\nexperience, however, had a significant reduction in the ratio\nbetween forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital\ncapacity (FEV\n/FVC). McCurdy et al38 in a large cross sectional\nsurvey of semiconductor workers, reported a significantly\nincreased risk of persistent wheezing among fabrication\nworkers. Several case reports have described exposures to\nadhesives--for example, cyanoacrylates--associated with oc-\ncupational asthma.39 40 However, in a large occupational cohort\nof 450 workers, exposure to cynacrylates was not found to be\nassociated with asthma, using FEV\ncriterion for case definition.41 Although it was not our intent to\ncomprehensively review all possible exposures that may occur\nin the electrical machinery, equipment, and supplies industry,\nneither is it possible to determine what the actual individual\nexposures were, although we can reason that the potential for\nexposure to asthmagens is high in this group, or at least in\nsubpopulations within the group, and the findings from this\nanalysis could benefit from additional study.\nA strong association between work related asthma and\nwheeze and the repair industrial group was found in this analy-\nsis. Workers in this industrial group include vehicle mechanics\nwho are at increased risk of exposures to several agents includ-\ning spray paints, degreasing solvents, and welding fumes. Spray\npaints may contain various isocyantes,well known to cause\nallergy mediated occupational asthma.30 42 Welding fumes\ncontain a complex mixture of particulate material and gases\nand are strong respiratory irritants. Welders have been shown to\nexperience an accelerated annual decline in FEV\npossibly lead to permanent respiratory impairment. In a study\nby Kogevinas et al,10 welders showed a significantly increased\nrisk of asthma. Similarly, exposure to welding fumes was asso-\nciated with a two-fold increased risk of asthma among Swedish\nworkers, consistent with the findings of our study.23 These ear-\nlier data, combined with the results from this study, support a\ncausal association between potential exposures encountered in\nthis industrial group and asthma.\nA four-fold increased odds of association between employ-\nment in the lodging industry with work related wheezing was\nfound in this analysis. The exposures of concern in the lodging\nindustry are mostly related to cleaning substances, which\ninclude solvents, sensitisers, and other volatile compounds.\nThe risk of asthma among cleaners is not well established. In\na study prompted by a case report of occupational asthma in a\ndetergent industry, Vanhanen et al44 reported a prevalence of\nsensitisation to enzymes as 22% among workers exposed to\ndetergent enzymes. In a prospective study by Nielsen and\nBach,45 female cleaners were found to have high risk of devel-\noping respiratory symptoms. Few population based studies\nhave reported an increased risk of asthma among cleaners. In\na study by Kogevinas et al10 a greater than two-fold increased\nrisk of asthma among cleaners was reported. Recently, in a\nmulticountry population based study, based on the European\nCommunity respiratory health survey, the same authors\nreported an increased OR of asthma as high as 4.50 among\ncleaners, similar to the results reported in our study. The risk\nwas consistent across different countries.22 A similar excess\nrisk of asthma among cleaners was also reported by Ng et al in\nSingapore.17 The present evidence in the literature and strong\nassociation found in our study suggests that cleaners are at a\nhigh risk of developing occupational asthma.\nThis study found more than a five-fold increase in the risk\nof work related asthma in the entertainment industry. This\ngroup, which includes artists, designers, and photographers,\n510 Arif, Whitehead, Delclos, et al\nwww.occenvmed.com\ngroup.bmj.com\noem.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nhas rarely been studied before. It includes workers with\npotential exposures to chemicals used in art media, stage set\nproduction, theatrical make up and photographic chemicals.46\nIn a community based study Forastiere et al47 reported an\nincreased risk of adult asthma among women in occupations\nrelated to entertainment. Nakano et al48 recently described a\ncase of occupational asthma resulting from exposure to pyra-\nzolone dye used in silver halide photographic paper. Given the\npaucity of reports in the literature, our results suggest that this\nassociation could benefit from further studies.\nAnalysis from this study also found an increased risk of\nwork related asthma in workers in the educational services.\nAsthma among teachers has not been studied before. Teachers\nare more likely to be exposed to environmental indoor\nallergens, which can be strong risk factors for asthma.49 Alter-\nnately, the increased risk found in this analysis could reflect\nself selection of subjects with asthma into this occupation.\nHowever, further studies are needed to determine whether the\nassociations found are real or just a random finding.\nIn conclusion, findings from this population based study\nindicate that several industries are associated with an\nincreased risk of work related asthma and work related\nwheezing and that 27% to 37% of the work related asthma and\nwheeze is attributable to selected at risk industrial groups.\nMost of the risks in this analysis were consistent with findings\nfrom other population based studies. Our findings provide\nimpetus for further research and actions which prioritise OA\non the public health agenda.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nAuthors' affiliations\nA A Arif, L W Whitehead, G L Delclos, S R Tortolero, E S Lee,\nUniversity of Texas-Houston Health Science Center, School of Public\nREFERENCES\n1 Chan-Yeung M, Malo JL.
