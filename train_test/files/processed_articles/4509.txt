Evidence indicates that political conflict predates the\nemergence of Homo sapiens, and has most likely been a persistent characteristic of our\nevolutionary lineage for millions of years (Boehm, 2000; Wrangham and Peterson, 1996).\nThe political challenges of small-scale social interaction posed enduring problems for our\nhunter-gatherer ancestors and, most likely, selected for sophisticated psychological\nmechanisms designed to navigate them (Petersen, 2011). In this sense, Aristotle's famous\ndictum, \"man is, by nature, a political animal,\" has been vindicated (Hatemi and\nIs the political animal politically ignorant?\nA biologically informed approach is increasingly guiding how psychologists (Haidt,\npolitical attitudes and behaviors. An underlying argument is that the existence of evolved\npolitical cognition makes opinion formation on modern political issues easy and effortless.\nAt the same time, however, a long line of research in political science has concluded that\nmost people find politics complicated and difficult to understand. During the 2008 US\npresidential election, for example, 69 percent of the American electorate agreed that\n\"sometimes, politics and government seem so complicated that a person like me can't really\nunderstand what's going on\" (ANES 2008). It seems that the political animal is, by self-\nprofession, politically ignorant.\nIn this article, we address this puzzle (i.e., why the human political animal is\npolitically ignorant). By reviewing and integrating insights from evolutionary psychology\nand political science, we describe (1) why modern mass politics often fail to activate\nevolved mechanisms for social and political decision-making and (2) the conditions in\nwhich these mechanisms are in fact triggered.\nA Public of Political Animals\nAs group-living animals, ancestral humans' fitness crucially hinged on their ability\nto navigate social life. Converging lines of evidence from archaeology (e.g., Alperson-Afil\net al., 2009), studies of non-human primates (e.g., Wrangham and Peterson 1996; de Waal,\n1996), and anthropology (Brown, 1991) suggest that problems relating to the formation of\ncoalitions, the facilitation of cooperation and gains-in-trade within and between groups, the\npunishment of exploiters, negotiation of status and hierarchical differences have all\nconstituted important adaptive problems with deep roots in our evolutionary history (for an\nFrom a problem-solving perspective, social life is constituted by a multitude of\nseparate problems each posing its own sets of challenges and requiring its own set of\nsolutions. Choosing a competent leader in times of war requires, for example, different\ncognitive processes than choosing a trustworthy cooperative partner. As demonstrated in\nthe cognitive sciences, distinct problems are most adaptively solved by distinct decision-\nrules that take the particularities of the specific problem into account (Tooby and\nCosmides, 1992; Gigerenzer et al., 1999). Given that processes of natural selection drive\nbiological design towards greater optimization, this suggests that the evolutionarily\nrecurrent problems of social life have selected for a multitude of narrow decision-rules\ntailored to particular classes of social problems.\nSome of the social problems that humans evolved to process and solve are related to\npolitical conflicts. According to the most widely adopted scholarly definition, politics is an\noverarching term for the set of activities whereby individuals and coalitions seek to\ninfluence the recognized allocation of scarce resources within societies (Easton, 1953). On\nthis definition, political conflicts are of two kinds. First, political conflicts are conflicts over\nthe power to make political decisions--that is, the power to influence who gets what\nwithout having to resort to physical aggression. Although political power can be exercised\nIs the political animal politically ignorant?\nunder implicit threats of aggression, political power in its purest form is when an individual\ngets other people to do something they would not otherwise do because they find it to be in\ntheir own interest to act in accordance with that individual's interests. When people have to\nresort to physical aggression, it signifies the breakdown of political power. Conflicts over\npolitical power, then, are intrinsically linked to status competitions. Second, political\nconflicts are conflicts over the content of political decisions and, hence, involve attempts to\ntweak allocations into greater alignment with ones preferences. Such conflicts are based on\nassessments of how different allocation schemes influence the welfare of the self and\nsignificant others.\nGiven this understanding of politics, evidence from evolutionary psychology\nsuggests that humans are political animals, ready to engage and capable of engaging in\nconflicts that are political. Research has demonstrated that humans universally compete\n(both as individuals and through the formation of coalitions) for status positions (Sidanius\nand Pratt, 2001), that these positions as leaders are not merely equated with dominance (cf.\nHenrich and Gil-White, 2001), that adaptations exist for following leaders that are best\nsuited for tackling the problems confronting the group (Little et al., 2007, 2012; Spisak et\nal., 2012), and that the discretion of leaders are recognized in the sense that individuals can\nview decisions from legitimate leaders as justified even if they entail negative outcomes for\nthe self (Hibbing and Alford, 2004). Furthermore, evolutionary psychologists have\nuncovered a suit of cognitive mechanisms designed to evaluate allocations of costs and\nbenefits within and between groups from the perspective of the self. Extensive research has\nshown that humans have an intuitive sense of what allocations of resources are fair\n(Cosmides and Tooby, 2005), who deserves to reap benefits from collective enterprises\n(Price et al., 2002), who constitutes the ingroup that is relevant to consider as targets of\nhelp (Yamagishi and Mifune, 2004), what should be done with those taking more than their\nshare (Petersen, Sell et al., 2012) and so forth. Whereas the first set of findings suggests\nthat humans have evolved cognitive mechanisms for seeking political power and for\nadaptively following the politically powerful, this second set of findings reveals an evolved\nbasis for political judgments or attitudes, i.e., mechanisms for judging a particular\nallocation as good or bad from the perspective of the self.\nAs is increasingly argued among both evolutionary psychologists and political\nmechanisms are of key importance in understanding how individuals form attitudes on\nmodern political issues. A large range of prominent modern political issues have direct\nparallels to ancestral social life. At their core, modern issues such as social welfare, race\nrelations, and criminal justice reflect evolutionarily recurrent problems such as whether to\nshare with needy individuals, how to treat outgroups, and how to deter and reconcile with\nexploiters.\nRecent research in fact suggests that the exact same mechanisms used to make\ndecisions about these broader social problems are active during political attitude formation\non modern issues. Table 1 provides an overview of this research; it describes how different\nmodern political issues (the first column) have been argued to match the input conditions\nfor mechanisms designed to process specific adaptive problems (the second column) as\nIs the political animal politically ignorant?\nwell as illustrative key findings from this research (the third column) (for a more thorough\nreview, see Petersen, 2011). Supporting the view of humans as political animals, the\nfindings summarized in Table 1 suggest that the mechanisms making up our evolved social\ncognition is applicable to at least a central set of mass political issues. As can also be seen,\nmost issues are processed by a number of cognitive mechanisms relating to a range of\nadaptive problems. In this sense, modern individuals seemingly have a tool box available\nwith a range of cognitive tools for facilitating the formation of political attitudes and the\nexecution of political decisions.\nThe Political Animal as Politically Ignorant\nFrom the above discussion, an immediate prediction springs to mind: If humans are\nindeed political animals, they should think of modern politics as engaging and easy.\nSurprisingly, however, research suggests that this is not the case. Hence, a core topic for\npolitical science researchers has been the political interest, knowledge and sophistication of\nthe public: Do people know much about politics? Do they care about politics? Can they\nmake up their minds on political substance? As we will outline in more detail below, the\nshort answer to these questions is, \"no\". As emphasized by Kinder (1998a, p. 784) most\nindividuals are \"awash in ignorance\" of politics.\nTo act politically in modern democratic society, one needs to know the basic\noperations of the political system, the key institutions and actors as wells as the content of\npolicies (Delli Carpini and Keeter, 1996). Yet, fifty years of research in political science\ndemonstrates that most people only have very limited knowledge about specific policies\nand are uninformed about political institutions and political actors such as parties and\nelected officials (e.g., Berelson, 1952; Campbell et al., 1960; Delli Carpini and Keeter,\ncitizens only held moderate or no interest in politics (Berelson et al., 1954, p. 306). Over\nthe years, not much has changed: In the fall of 1992 only 59 percent Americans knew that\nthe Democrats held the majority of the seats in the House of Representatives despite the\nfact that the Democratic Party had held the control of the House for more than 40 years\nthat the federal government spend more money on foreign aid than on Medicare (Kinder,\n1998b, 169). While humans seem to have an evolved sense of power and leadership, many\nsimply do not pick up the relevant facts necessary for understanding who has political\npower or for striving for that power themselves in the context of modern democratic\npolitics. As Ferejohn (1990, p. 3) sums up: \"Nothing strikes the student of public opinion\nand democracy more forcefully than the paucity of information most people possess about\npolitics.\"\nIs the political animal politically ignorant?\nIs the political animal politically ignorant?\nWhether or not people have their facts straight, they could hold passionate (but\nuninformed) opinions about modern political issues. Here, the evidence is more mixed. In\ngeneral, most people find it difficult to make political decisions. They often only hold weak\nor no preferences in relation to policy (Popkin, 1991) and, if they do hold preferences, these\nare often internally inconsistent (Converse, 1964; Zaller, 1992). At the same time, however,\nit is important to differentiate between different types of issues. While research on this is\nlimited, political scientists have argued that certain issues are \"easier\" to form opinions\nabout and vote on the basis of than others (Carmines and Stimson, 1980). In a European\ncontext, Slothuus (2005) compared eight different issues and showed that whereas\nquestions about attitudes on immigration, social welfare and criminal justice elicit very few\n\"don't know\" responses, questions about economic policies and the European Union elicit\na much higher rate. If we compare these observations to the findings in Table 1, this clearly\nsuggests that the more a modern political issue carries recognizable similarities to basic\nadaptive problems, the easier it is for people to form opinions (see also Haidt, 2012). Some\nissues such as macro-economic policies and intergovernmental regulation emerge\nexclusively in the context of modern society and humans have few if any evolved cognitive\nmechanisms for processing such issues. Importantly, however, this conclusion needs to be\nqualified. Whereas people only infrequently report that they don't have an opinion on\nissues such as social welfare, abortion, and criminal justice, researchers still often observe\nthat the opinions reported are highly inconsistent and temporally unstable (for social\nwelfare, see Zaller and Feldman, 1992; for criminal justice, see Cullen et al., 2000; for\nabortion, see Alvarez and Brehm, 2002). This is important because it implies that\nindividuals are ambivalent and have contradictory considerations even on \"hot button\"\npolitical issues that tap into evolved cognitive mechanisms.\nMismatches between Ancestral Social Life and Modern Politics\nHow can the conclusion that humans evolved as political animals be reconciled with\nthese observations of political ignorance? According to the mismatch hypothesis, many\nseemingly irrational behaviors emerge from differences between modern and ancestral\nenvironments that cause cognitive mechanisms to misfire (Hagen and Hammerstein, 2006).\nThis, we argue, is exactly the case in relation to mass politics. While many mass political\nissues resemble evolutionarily recurrent adaptive problems, there are at the same time a\nrange of differences between now and then that causes mismatches between the available\ncognitive mechanisms and the cognitive demands involved in forming political attitudes\nHumans evolved as hunters and gatherers in small-scale groups of 25 to 200\nindividuals, without any codified institutions (Kelly, 1995; Dunbar, 1998). Consequently,\nhumans' evolved social cognition is designed to be operative within small-scale social\nenvironments and, accordingly, to produce outputs on the basis of cues and information\nresiding in such environments. Modern states, in contrast, comprise millions of people, are\ncomplex webs of formal, codified institutions, and make use of advanced technology. This\ncreates two types of mismatches relevant to political attitude formation:\nIs the political animal politically ignorant?\nThe first type relates to mismatches between the problems of modern politics and\nancestral social living, which means that for many modern political issues, there are no\nrelevant cognitive mechanisms for generating interest and producing clear inferences. For\nexample, complicated formalized procedural rules for decision-making in parliament are\ncultural artefacts that (at least, to the outsider) might not fit the input conditions of any\nevolved cognitive mechanism. Similarly, the existence of macro-economic regulation is\nclosely tied to the emergence of mass society and will seem \"non-intuitive\" to the evolved\nsmall-scale oriented mind. Such mismatches could explain both the general lack of\nknowledge about modern democratic institutions and the difficulties in forming opinions on\na range of \"hard\" political issues.\nThe second type of mismatch, in contrast, is about contextual differences between\nthe way similar political problems are posed ancestrally and today. This type of mismatch,\nwe argue, causes modern people to have difficulties in forming opinions even on those\nissues that otherwise fit evolved cognitive mechanisms (cf. the last paragraph of the\npreceding section). Outlining this type of mismatch requires the establishment of a number\nof key points.\nFirst, it is important to acknowledge that, because many social problems are\nexceptionally complex, their solution requires facultative decision rules. In cooperation\nproblems, for example, simulation studies demonstrate that unilateral strategies such as\n\"always cooperate\" and \"always defect\" are inferior to contingent strategies such as \"tit-\nfor-tat\" that adjust decisions to the decisions of the partner (e.g., Axelrod, 1984). Rather\nthan global preferences such as \"always cooperate\", \"always shun outgroups\", \"always\npunish\", evolution has selected for psychological mechanisms that produce different\npreferences depending on the circumstances facing the individual (Tooby and Cosmides,\n1992). The mind of the political animal, then, is a collection of mechanisms designed to\nnavigate social life by extracting myriads of cues and information about ecological and\nsocial contingencies.\nSecond, in the small-scale world of our ancestors, the relevant cues for social\ndecision-making would be cues residing in face-to-face interaction. These include intimate\nknowledge about targets of decisions (Lieberman and Linke, 2007), the presence of\nbystanders (Haley and Fessler, 2005), facial expressions (Scharlemann et al., 2001),\nphysical characteristics of self and other (Sell et al., 2009; Jensen and Petersen, 2011), and\ndirections of eye gaze (Kurzban, 2001). That is, to operate and produce clear inferences,\nhuman social cognition requires the availability of intimate social cues.\nThird, while the availability of general information is abundant in modern society,\nintimate social information about co-citizens of this kind is lacking. In modern society,\neach citizen only knows and ever meets a tiny fraction of his or her co-citizens and the far\nlargest part is constituted by anonymous strangers. This has often been noted by political\nscientists \u00ad as reflected in quotes such as \"our opinions cover a bigger space, a longer reach\nof time, a greater number of things, than we can directly observe\" (Lippmann, 1922, p. 49)\nand \"citizens in large societies are dependent on unseen and usually unknown others for\nmost of their information about the larger world in which they live\" (Zaller, 1992, p. 6).\nThis lack of vivid social cues is attenuated because the vastness of modern political systems\nimposes a certain structure on modern political debates. While social decisions in small-\nIs the political animal politically ignorant?\nscale environments are often targeted at specific others, modern politics is about\nestablishing general rules applying across specific cases (Stone, 1988). Ultimately, the\nproblems confronting people are not whether a specific criminal should be punished,\nwhether a specific welfare recipient should be helped, or whether a specific immigrant\nshould be allowed entry. Rather, the key issues are how to treat all criminals, all welfare\nrecipients, and all immigrants. People, in essence, are required to think and respond in\nterms of whole categories of faceless individuals, whereas social cognition is designed to\nextract massive information about the specific others directly in front of us.\nIn tandem, these observations imply that while individuals enter mass politics with\nsophisticated evolved mechanisms for political cognition, the lack of cues that fit the input\nconditions of the underlying mechanisms will necessarily impede their operations. In line\nwith this, research has demonstrated how social cognition is inhibited when deprived of\nintimate social cues. For example, studies using fMRI have shown how activity in brain\nregions related to emotional processing are down-regulated when vivid personal cues are\nunavailable (e.g., de Quervain et al., 2004; Sanfey et al., 2003) and, outside the laboratory,\nresearch on group efficiency has shown that social and emotional coordination in groups is\ninhibited when groups do not interact face-to-face (Baltes et al., 2002). In order for social\ncognition to produce clear political inferences even on issues that resemble ancestral social\nproblems, modern individuals, in other words, need to compensate for a lack of direct,\nintimate, and vivid social cues in mass politics.\nWhen and How Mass Politics Engage the Political Animal\nWe now review a selection of external inputs and internal processes facilitating\npeople's use of evolved cognitive mechanisms when reasoning about mass political issues.\nThis discussion is not meant as an exhaustive review of all possible strategies but a case by\ncase illustration of how people may acquire vivid social cues or compensate for the lack\nthereof through 1) externally provided media stories and 2) internal psychological\nprocesses allowing them to mentally simulate the absent cues.\nThe mass media is an obvious external source of vivid social cues (e.g., Iyengar and\nKinder, 1987), which can facilitate the use of evolved cognitive mechanisms during\npolitical attitude formation. Mass media may, for example, supply relevant cues by\ncovering political issues using particularly vivid story formats. Of special relevance is the\noften used media strategy of illustrating (i.e., framing) general and technical political issues\nusing specific persons and their personal histories. Here, the audience is directly provided\nwith relevant intimate, social cues that resemble the kinds of cues social cognition evolved\nto process and these cues come to frame the more general issue. A series of studies have\ninvestigated the psychological effects of such episodic framing and have provided evidence\nthat episodic frames allow individuals to utilize more basic moral and emotional decision-\nmaking mechanisms when forming opinions on the relevant issues (Aar\u00f8e, 2011; Gross,\n2008). When issues are framed in terms of general statistical and abstract information, in\ncontrast, these emotional reactions are impeded.\nNot just the format of media stories but also their specific content can facilitate\npeople's utilization of evolved cognitive mechanisms by providing cues that fit the input\nIs the political animal politically ignorant?\nconditions of specific issue-relevant mechanisms. Social welfare issues, for example,\nresemble more general social problems related to sharing. In situations involving sharing,\nelaborate experiments have shown that individuals possess specialized psychological\nmechanisms designed to identify \"cheaters\" (Cosmides and Tooby, 2005) and that these\nmechanisms discriminate between cheaters and non-cheaters on the basis of their displayed\nefforts to accrue and exchange resources (Cosmides and Tooby, 2005; Cosmides, Barrett,\nand Tooby, 2010; Petersen, 2012). A series of studies have shown how these mechanisms\ndesigned for general cheater-detection can come to structure modern social welfare\nattitudes when individuals are directly provided with cues to the effort of social welfare\nrecipients in, for example, media stories. Such cues influence opinions such that people\nbecome less supportive of welfare in the face of lazy welfare recipients (Slothuus, 2007),\nmake individuals intuitively represent modern welfare as small-scale sharing situations\n(Petersen, 2012), activate emotions of anger and compassion that come to guide welfare\nopinions (Petersen, Sznycer et al., 2012) and help individuals lacking political knowledge\nand sophistication, effortlessly make up their minds on the otherwise complicated issue of\nAnother illustration of how the mass media supply vivid cues that tap into evolved\nsocial cognition is a recent study of how loss aversion and ingroup bias influence the\npersuasiveness of political arguments (Arceneaux, 2012). Across disparate decision-making\nsituations and cultures, individuals tend to give priority to avoid losses rather than pursuing\ngains and display deep suspicion of outsiders while privileging their ingroup members\n(Arceneaux, 2012), biases which plausibly reflect adaptive error-management (Haselton\nand Buss, 2003). Arceneaux (2012) demonstrated that political arguments that directly\ntarget and activate these biases are more persuasive and prompt individuals to change their\nopinions on important issues such as health regulation and government spending. The\npersuasiveness of such arguments holds up even when challenged by more rationalistic\n(and less-bias congruent) arguments.\nWhile the mass media may constitute one important external source of the kind of\nvivid social cues to which our evolved political cognition responds, cognitive scientists also\nincreasingly emphasize internal psychological processes as central compensatory strategies\nwhich individuals use when making decisions in sparse information contexts. An important\naspect of these processes is often referred to as decoupled cognition (e.g., Cosmides and\npermits offline cognition where individuals rely on intense mental simulations and imagery\nin interaction with domain specific mechanisms to imagine solutions to social problems,\nproblems of tool use or other recurrent problems. This suggests that when vivid social cues\nare absent, people can utilize relevant evolved mechanisms by engaging in decoupled\ncognition to imagine what they cannot see, and feed these internally generated\nrepresentations and beliefs into mechanisms for small-scale political decision-making\n(Petersen and Aar\u00f8e, 2012). In line with this, differences in the personality trait, Openness\nto Experience, which is related to abilities to mentally simulate, predict a variety of\nmeasures of political engagement such that open people are more likely to be politically\nmeasuring physiological responding based on electrodermal activity (EDA), a recent study\nIs the political animal politically ignorant?\ndemonstrated that individuals with high general EDA responsiveness to external stimuli\n(i.e., people who extract more affective meaning from their environment) are also more\nlikely to be politically involved (and, in fact, that EDA responsiveness seems in particular\nto compensate for otherwise low levels of involvement among individuals with little\neducation) (Gruszczynski et al., 2012). Other strands of research have focused on\nstereotypes as a particular kind of decoupled cognition and shown how stereotypes about\ncriminals that fit the input conditions of evolved psychological mechanisms for counter-\nexploitation cause individuals to have attitudes about criminal justice that are internally\nconsistent (Petersen, 2009) and infused with affect (Petersen, 2010). Finally, focusing on\nthe case of social welfare, a series of studies have directly provided evidence that\nindividual differences in imaginative capacity affect individuals' use of evolved cognitive\nmechanisms to form political attitudes. Specifically, people high in imagination more easily\nform social welfare attitudes because they hold more vivid stereotypes of welfare recipients\nthat subsequently allow for a stronger activation of cheater-detection mechanisms during\nattitude formation (Petersen and Aar\u00f8e, 2012).\nWithin the political science literature, factual political knowledge (e.g., Zaller,\n1992) has in particular been emphasized as a source of internal information that people can\nutilize during opinion formation. While most people only have limited political knowledge,\nthere are substantial individual differences in the level of knowledge that people have\navailable and some individuals have quite high levels of political knowledge (Delli Carpini\nand Keeter, 1996). Research has consistently shown that political knowledge enables\nindividuals' to make more internally consistent political choices and to do so with greater\nease (e.g., Barker, 2005; Sniderman et al., 1991). The classical interpretation of this is that\nknowledge about basic political facts enables individuals to reason more deeply and\nthoroughly about politics. Yet, recent studies suggest that political knowledge rather\nprovides another kind of path through which individuals can utilize evolved mechanisms\nfor small-scale political decisions in the context of mass politics (Schreiber, 2007). For\nexample, when thinking about politics, people with high political knowledge have been\nshown to have greater activation in the brain's default state network \u00ad a neutral circuitry\nthat has specifically been linked to social cognition (Fowler and Schreiber, 2008). Rather\nthan just providing the basis for deep reflection, factual political knowledge also seems to\nprovide a reservoir of information that can serve as triggers for social intuitions and help\nindividuals see the policy implications of those intuitions.\nConclusion\nHumans are political animals in the sense that they, during normal development,\nbuild a suit of sophisticated psychological mechanisms designed to, first, strategically seek\nand recognize political power and, second, form and evaluate decisions about the\nallocations of costs and benefits within and between groups. The problems these\nmechanisms evolved to navigate carry similarities to modern political issues such as\ndemocratic elections, social welfare, criminal justice, race relations and redistribution and,\nhence, seem to be readily utilizable for political choice on modern issues. Yet, as we have\nreviewed here, political science has produced ample evidence that people find it inherently\nIs the political animal politically ignorant?\ndifficult to form political opinions and they lack substantive political knowledge. In\ntraditional political science, researchers have generally attributed this state of affairs to a\nlack of political sophistication or even plain empty-headedness among the public (e.g.\nConverse, 1964; Zaller, 1992). In contrast, we have argued that an explanation focusing on\nthe mismatches between ancestral social life and modern mass politics is able to synthesize\nthe available observations across disciplines much more coherently. In particular, we have\nargued that researchers need to focus on the lack of information in modern mass politics\nthat fits evolved political cognition. Such a perspective is able to integrate the likely\nexistence of an evolved psychology for political decision-making with the findings from\npolitical science on the political ignorance of many individuals.\nBecause human political cognition evolved to operate within a social ecology of\nsmall-scale face-to-face interactions, the operations of political cognition is dependent on\nreception of vivid, intimate social information. In the impersonal and abstract domain of\nmodern mass politics, such information is not readily available and, hence, makes it\ndifficult to utilize basic evolved systems for social and political judgment. Under specific\nconditions, however, individuals are able to compensate for this lack of information and\nlink evolved cognition to issues of mass politics. Through external exposure to vivid cues\n(e.g., specific types of media stories) or by engaging in heavy mental simulation, the\npolitical animal is able to process modern mass politics using the suit of evolved cognitive\nmechanisms.\nThese observations imply that the emerging field of evolutionary political\npsychology needs to approach the study of attitudes and behavior on particular political\nissues with two sets of considerations. First, what adaptive domain (or domains) does the\nspecific political issue resemble, if any? That is, what kinds of cognitive mechanisms are\naroused by the threats and challenges involved in a particular political discussion? Second,\nwhat kinds of cues are these cognitive mechanisms using to produce judgments and are\nthese cues available in the context of lay persons' decision-making on this particular\npolitical issue? The second set of questions, then, requires an analysis of the context in\nwhich the relevant problems reside within modern politics. Only if a given issue can be\npsychologically represented as falling within a particular adaptive domain and the relevant\ncues for producing judgments within that domain are available, should we expect modern\nindividuals to find it easy to form political opinions on the issue. If the latter cues are not\navailable, people might find the issue interesting and important but, at the same time, have\ndifficulties in making up their minds on it.\nWhile evolved intuitions often structure how individuals think about mass\npolitics--and make it appear interesting, engaging, and fun--this does not imply that the\nresulting judgments are necessarily efficient or adaptive in the context of today. Hence, the\ninformation people find intuitively relevant when producing political choices will be\ninformation of relevance in ancestral, small-scale social environments, and the political\nsolutions that people will find intuitively correct will be solutions that work within such\nenvironments. In the complex mass society of today, reliance on such information or such\nsolutions does not necessarily produce optimal outcomes.\nIs the political animal politically ignorant?\nReferences\nAar\u00f8e, L.
