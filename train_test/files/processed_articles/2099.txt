After ingestion, a major fraction of dietary lignans\nundergo an extensive metabolism by the gut microflora that\nresults in the formation of 2 major metabolites, END3 and ENL\n(4), which are generally called enterolignans attending to their\ncolonic origin. When these compounds were first discovered,\nthey were classified as phytoestrogens according to their\nresemblance to endogenous 17b-estradiol and based upon\nstudies reporting an interaction between these compounds and\nthe human endocrine system (5). In women, urinary ENL has\nbeen positively and significantly associated with sex hormone-\nbinding globulin and negatively associated with plasma free\nestradiol, free testosterone (6,7) and 5-reductase enzymes (8).\nObservational prospective studies have suggested that high\nlevels of circulating ENL are associated with lower risks of acute\ncardiovascular events. One of the first studies associating serum\nENL concentrations with cardiovascular disease was a nested\nstudy within the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor\nStudy. In a case-control design, men in the highest ENL quartile\ncoronary event than men in the lowest quartile after adjusting\nfor the strongest predictive risk factors (9). This study was then\nfollowed by other prospective analyses of the Kuopio Ischaemic\nHeart Disease Risk Factor Study cohort (mean 12 y) from which\nsignificant associations were again found between high levels of\nserum ENL and reduced risk of chronic heart disease and CVD\ndeaths (10). Within the Antioxidant Supplementation in Ather-\nosclerosis Prevention study, serum F2-isoprostane levels were\nfound to decrease linearly across quintiles of serum ENL after\nadjustment for other dietary antioxidants (11). More recently, a\nnonsignificant association was found in a prospective study of\nmale smokers in Finland where the OR (highest vs. lowest\nquintile) for nonfatal myocardial infarction and chronic heart\ndisease-related death according to serum ENL were 0.67 (95%\nThe latest report was a nested case-control study within the\nprospective Netherlands Monitoring Project on CVD.

This association may\nexplain the favorable results obtained in the aforementioned\nstudies, but a putative role of these metabolites cannot be ruled\nout, because the relationship between enterolignan excretion\nand intermediate cardiovascular risk markers is not yet clearly\nunderstood. The objective of the present study was to assess the\nassociation between exposure to dietary lignans measured by\ntheir urinary metabolites (enterolignans) and plasma lipid levels,\na known risk factor for cardiovascular disease, using data from\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy population. The NHANES, which is the responsibility of the\nU.S. National Center for Health Statistics, comprises a series of complex,\nmulti-stage probability samples that represent the civilian, noninstitu-\ntionalized U.S. population. In brief, primary sampling units (mostly\ncounties) were selected and divided into segments (generally city blocks\nor their equivalent). Households within each segment were listed and a\nsample was randomly drawn. Individuals were chosen to participate in\nNHANES from a list of all persons residing in selected households. In\ngeographic areas where the proportion of age, ethnic, or income groups\nthat were selected for oversampling was high, the probability of selection\nfor those groups was greater than in other areas; therefore, individuals\nwere drawn at random within designated age-sex-race/ethnicity screen-\napproved by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics Institutional\nReview Board and oral and written informed consent was obtained from\ninterviews and physical examinations was 70.3%, corresponding to a\ntained from approximately one-third of the subsample of persons 6 y and\nolder selected at random (n = 7999). Specific sample weights for this\nsubsample (phthalate subsample MEC weights) (19\u00ad21) were used when\nanalyzing these data. From this subsample, we further excluded\nparticipants younger than 20 y old, leaving 4206 individuals, from\nwhich 427 women, who were either pregnant or missing information\nabout menopausal status or hormone-replacement medication use, were\nalso excluded due to possible interaction with the allegedly estrogenic\neffect of ENL. Any component altering intestinal flora or its environment\nhas the potential to affect the degree to which precursors are converted to\nenterolignans (22), so we further eliminated 93 participants reporting\nantibiotic use 1 mo prior to participating in the survey. A total of 2059\nparticipants missing values for serum lipids were also excluded along with\nan additional 110 participants who were missing any other study\ncovariates. A final sample of 1492 participants remained available for\nanalysis.\ncollected during an in-home interview and a subsequent visit to a MEC.\nDuring the in-home interview, information on age, sex, race/ethnicity,\nand education was collected using a standardized questionnaire. Other\ndata collected during the in-home interview included education, house-\nhold income, physical activity, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption,\ncurrent medication use, and menopausal status. BMI was obtained by\ndividing measured weight in kilograms by measured height in meters\nsquared. Serum cotinine was measured using the isotope-dilution HLPC-\nAtmospheric-pressure Chemical Ionization MS method. Physical activity\nwas defined as metabolic energy turnover/week using variables having\ninformation for number of times the activity was done over the past 30 d,\nmean number of minutes the activity was done, and metabolic equivalent\nscore for the activity. Urine creatinine was determined using a Jaffe\n\u00b4\nreaction measured with a CX3 analyzer (Beckman Coulter).\nUrinary enterolignans. The urine collection procedure consisted of\nurine specimen collection and processing and pregnancy testing. Fasting\nstatus was also recorded and only data from participants who fasted at\nleast 9 h were considered. Urine specimens were collected from partici-\npants in standard urine collection cups. Samples were immediately\nrefrigerated and transferred to specimen vials within 4 h of collection. A\nminimum of 5 mL of urine was collected and stored in borosilicate glass or\npolypropylene vials or specimen cups, immediately frozen at 2208C, and\nstored on dry ice for shipping. Two comparable methods for the\nanalyses were performed by HPLC-APCI-MS building on the Barnes et al.\nlignans were analyzed at the CDC's Division of Laboratory of Sciences\nmethods include enzymatic deconjugation of the lignans followed by solid-\nphase extraction, reverse-phase HPLC to resolve the analytes, and MS\ndetection using internal isotope-labeled standards to guarantee the\naccuracy of the measurements. The limit of detection was 1.0 nmol/L (24).\nSerum lipids. Blood samples were drawn by a trained phlebotomist\nover EDTA and stored under appropriate refrigerated (4\u00ad88C) and frozen\n(2208C) conditions until used. Serum total cholesterol and TG were\nmeasured enzymatically (24) and HDL cholesterol was directly assessed\nafter exclusion of apoB lipoproteins. LDL cholesterol was calculated\nfrom measured values of total cholesterol, TG, and HDL cholesterol\naccording to the relationship [LDL] = [total cholesterol] 2 [HDL] 2\n[TG]/5, where [TG]/5 is an estimate of VLDL cholesterol (24). Although\nrecent food intake exerts little effect on total cholesterol in plasma, TG\nare increased in postprandial plasma to the extent that is related to the\namount of fat consumed. This is due to the appearance of chylomicrons\nin the circulation after a fat-containing meal. Chylomicrons are normally\ncleared within 9\u00ad12 h and no chylomicrons should be present after a 12-\nh period of fasting. Transient decreases in HDL cholesterol and LDL\ncholesterol also occur, the magnitude of which depends on the fat\ncontent of the meal (24). We considered only values of serum lipids\nmeasured in specimens drawn from participants who have fasted at least\n9 h before venipuncture.\nDietary assessment. The dietary interview component, called What\nWe Eat in America, was conducted as a partnership between the USDA\nand the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Since the 2003\u00ad\n2004 survey, NHANES has released 2 d of intake data for each\nparticipant. The first day (d 1) is collected in the MEC and d 2 is collected\nby telephone 3\u00ad10 d later. Mean values of the 2 d were used for the\nanalysis.\nStatistical methods. All the statistical analyses were performed using the\nopen-source statistical scripting language R, version 2.13.0 (R Develop-\nment Core Team) (25). We used the R survey package, which includes\nspecific functions to fit the generalized linear model to data from a\ncomplex survey design, with inverse-probability weighting and design-\nbased SE (26,27). Participants were divided in tertiles of enterolignans\nbased on the weighted study sample population distribution. The\nunadjusted linear model (model 1) and multivariate linear models with\ndifferent degree of adjustment were used to study the association between\nserum lipid concentrations and urinary enterolignan levels. Adjusting\nvariables were defined a priori based on the research hypothesis. Model 2\nwas adjusted by sex, age (using covariates defined by a restricted quadratic\nsplines), race/ethnicity, education level, income, and creatinine (log\ntransformed) to account for urine volume standardization. Model 3 was\nfurther adjusted for BMI (restricted quadratic spline transformation),\nsmoking, alcohol intake, menopausal status, use of hormonal replacement\ntherapy and cotinine (log transformed), fiber intake, total cholesterol\nintake, and physical activity. An additional censored regression model used\nto discard the potential lack of power induced by models 2 and 3 by\ncorrecting for the effect of lipid lowering medication (28) was fitted using\nthe cnreg command in STATA (version 10.0; Research Triangle Institute).\nWe also assessed the presence of interactions between urinary ENL and\nsex, age, race/ethnicity, education, BMI, smoking status, and alcohol\nintake. To study the form of the relationship between lipid concentrations\njn.nutrition.org\nDownloaded from\nand urinary lignan concentrations, we fitted an additional linear model\nusing restricted quadratic splines with knots defined at the 5th, 50th, and\n95th percentiles of the enterolignan distribution (29). The regression spline\nmodel was adjusted by the same confounders used in model 2. P values in\nTable 1 correspond to the F tests for homogeneity of the means obtained\nusing the regTermTest function of the survey package (26,27). Standard\ndiagnostic checks on the residuals from the fitted models showed no\nevidence of failure on the assumption of normality and homogeneity of the\nresidual variance.\nResults\nA substantial number of eligible participants were excluded\nfrom the original study population, mostly due to the limited\navailability of enterolignan data. To account for possible\nselection bias, we used the provided specific subsample weight\n(phthalate subsample MEC weights) (19\u00ad21) in the statistical\ndesign. We also assessed the possible error introduced by the use\nof two different analytical methods for measuring urinary\nenterolignan concentrations depending on the year of the\nNHANES survey (19\u00ad21). No comparison between them has\nbeen reported in the NHANES protocols and it is also not\npossible to calculate the appropriate validation parameters due\nto the lack of repeated measures. Nevertheless, the mean\ndifference between urinary enterolignan concentrations mea-\nwhich cannot be considered biologically relevant.\nGeometric mean urinary END and ENL concentrations were\n0.17 and 1.28 mmol/L, respectively, with wide ranges in the subset\nmedian urinary enterolignan concentration was 1.94 mmol/L,\nwith 83% of it ENL (Table 1). The concentrations of enter-\nolignans were significantly higher in the urine of participants with\nhigher education and lower in obese individuals (Table 1).\nEnterolignan concentrations are strongly associated with fiber\nintake, smoking status (former or never smokers), and physical\nactivity levels (Table 1).\nWe used multivariate linear models to estimate adjusted\nmean differences in serum lipid concentrations between the\nsecond or 3rd tertiles and the first tertile of urinary enterolignan\nconcentration (Table 2). No interaction between urinary enter-\nolignans and sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, BMI, smoking\nstatus, or alcohol intake was observed. The overall trend was for\na significant decrease in serum TG and an increase in HDL\ncholesterol between tertiles 1 and 3 of urinary enterolignans.\nThe estimated linear regression coefficients quantifying the\nlinear relationship between TG and HDL cholesterol with log-\nenterolignans were also significant. Because the urine enter-\nolignan concentrations were log transformed, the expected mean\ndifferences in TG concentrations, holding the other predictor\nvariables constant, for a 50% increase in enterolignan concen-\naccording to model 2 (Table 2). The decrease in serum TG\nconcentrations according to increasing concentrations of urinary\nenterolignans was significant only when comparing tertiles 1 and\n3 (P = 0.004) for model 2 and the same applies to the increment\nin HDL cholesterol (P = 0.04). No association was found\nbetween other serum lipids and enterolignans (Table 2) and no\nfurther differences were observed after fitting a censored\nregression model to correct for the effect of lipid-lowering\nmedication (28) (results not shown).\nTABLE 1 Urinary enterolignan concentrations in U.S. adults by\nstudy participant characteristics1\nCharacteristic n (%) Enterolignans, mmol/L P-value\nSaturated fat intake, g/d 0.71\n1 Values are median (IQR).

The estimated\ncurves and 95% CI representing the shape of the relationship\nbetween urinary enterolignan concentrations and levels of serum\nlipids are shown in Figure 1. A negative, nonlinear association\nbetween serum TG, LDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol and\nurinary enterolignans was found while the concentration of\nHDL cholesterol increased steadily according to increasing\nvalues of urinary enterolignans.\nDiscussion\nThe best approach when assessing dietary lignan exposure is to\nuse plasmatic (33) or urinary ENL as a biologic marker.\nReproducibility of a single measurement of urinary ENL has\nrecently been found to be adequate over a 3-y period (ICC =\n0.52) within the Nurses' Health Study (34) and has also been\ncorrelated with 24-h urine ENL (ICC = 0.65) in the SU.VI.MAX\ncohort (35). Additionally, because END presents a shorter\nelimination half-life (36) and ENL production is also highly\ndependent on individual gut microflora (37), it has been\nsuggested that the use of the pooled concentrations of END\nand ENL are a better reflection of dietary lignan exposure (38).\nUsing this approach for assessing dietary lignan exposure in\nour study, we found an inverse and nonlinear association with\nserum TG and a positive linear association for HDL cholesterol\nand urinary enterolignan concentrations. The differences found,\nalthough significant, were small and biologic implications should\nbe considered cautiously, although in the case of HDL choles-\nterol, the linear relationship we found deserves further attention.\nHigh-fiber diets have been associated with a decreased risk of\nCVD by the reduction of serum total cholesterol and LDL\ncholesterol concentrations (39,40), but dietary fiber seems to\nhave little effect on HDL cholesterol or TG (41). In this report,\nurinary enterolignan concentrations are associated with a favor-\nable effect on these later fractions, suggesting a complementary\neffect to dietary fiber and supporting previous findings on lignan-\nrich diets and cardioprotective effects (42). No association\nbetween plasma enterolignans and HDL cholesterol was found in\na nested case-control study within the prospective Netherlands\nMonitoring Project on CVD (13). The same results were derived\nfrom 2 cross-sectional studies in which no association with blood\nlipids was found (43,44). These studies estimated lignan expo-\nsure by dietary assessment and considered only the lignans\nknown at the time. It was long thought that secoisolariciresinol\nand matairesinol were the only 2 lignans commonly present in\nfood, but it is now known that these compounds account for only\na minor percentage of the total lignan content (2,45), and\ntherefore dietary lignan intakes have been underestimated. Using\nthe same estimation through dietary assessment, a weak associ-\nation was found between lignan intake and aortic stiffness in\npostmenopausal women in the PROSPECT study (46), and no\nassociation (high vs. low quartile of plant lignan intake) was\nDutch postmenopausal women within the European Prospective\nInvestigation into Cancer and Nutrition study (47). Associations\nderived from studies relying on dietary lignan intake calculation,\nand especially those dependent on the first developed lignan\ndatabases, should be revised for consistency. Using urinary\nconcentrations as a biomarker for dietary lignan intake, we\nfound that an increasing excretion of enterolignan is associated\nwith decreased levels of serum TG and increased levels of serum\nHDL cholesterol in U.S. adults after adjusting for all major\nconfounders.\nBecause the ENL metabolism seems to be related to that of\nendogenous estradiol, it has been hypothesized that ENL could\nmodulate steroid hormones through competition for the estrogen\nTABLE 2 Adjusted differences in serum lipids by tertiles of urinary enterolignan concentrations in U.S. adults1\nSerum lipids in adults\nTertile of urinary enterolignan2 Linear trend3\n1 Values are mean adjusted differences (95% CI).

Effects on macrophage lipid accumula-\ntion (49), cellular cholesterol metabolism (50), and inhibition of\nLDL oxidation (51,52) have also been proposed as plausible\nmechanisms by which dietary compounds with estrogenic activity\nmay protect against the development of atherosclerosis. Because\nof the heterogeneous nature of the estrogen receptors (53), the\neffects of enterolignans on the cardiovascular system are likely\nto be complex and not limited to the favorable changes of the\nlipid profile seen in this study. The additive and synergistic\neffects of active phytochemicals such as lignans found in whole\ngrains may be partly responsible for the health benefits\nassociated with fiber-rich foods.\n"
