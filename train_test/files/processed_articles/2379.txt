We found that after implementation of\nthe ACA provision, among people ages 18\u00ad25 with possible mental health\ndisorders, mental health treatment increased by 5.3 percentage points\nrelative to a comparison group of similar people ages 26\u00ad35. Smaller, but\nconsistent, effects were found among all young adults, not only those\nwith possible illnesses. For people using mental health treatment,\nuninsured visits declined by 12.4 percentage points, and visits paid by\nprivate insurance increased by 12.9 percentage points. We observed no\nchanges in mental health treatment setting. Outcomes related to\nsubstance abuse treatment did not change during the study period. The\ndependent coverage provision can contribute to a broader strategy for\nimproving behavioral health treatment for young adults.\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) has\nbeen considered a transformative\npolicy for increasing access to care\nfor people with mental health and\nsubstance use disorders.1 Although\nthe largest ACA coverage expansions began in\nJanuary 2014, one important early provision\nhas allowed young adults to remain on their par-\nents' health insurance as dependents. The de-\npendent coverage provision went into effect in\nwhether or not they reside outside of their par-\nents' home, are their parents' tax dependents, or\nare married.2\nThe provision initially did not require insurers\nto cover people who already had an offer of\nemployer-sponsored insurance, but this exemp-\nsuggest the provision increased the number of\ninsured people in the target population by over\ntwo million3\u00ad5 and increased the use of emergen-\ncy department and hospital services.6,7\nThe dependent coverage provision could be\nespecially important for young adults because\nmental health and substance use disorders peak\nin young adulthood,8 and insurance coverage\nhas historically been low among young adults.9\nAt leasttwo studies have examinedtheimpactsof\nthe ACA provision. Yaa Akosa Antwi and co-\nauthors6 used data from the National Inpatient\nSample, a national sample of hospital admis-\nsions, and found that the provision had both\nincreased inpatient admissions overall among\nyoung adults and increased the fraction of young\nadults admitted with private insurance. The\nsame study found that mental health admissions\nhad increased by 5.5 percent, relative to a com-\nparison group of older adults, and that mental\nhealth admissions increased more than all non-\npregnancy-related admissions (including non\u00ad\nThe People-to-People Health\nFoundation, Inc.\nBrendan Saloner (bsaloner@\ngmail.com) is an assistant\nprofessor in the Department\nof Health Policy and\nManagement, Johns Hopkins\nBloomberg School of Public\nHealth, in Baltimore,\nMaryland.

He found that people enrolled through the\nnew provision were higher users of mental\nhealth and substance abuse treatment than peo-\nple in the same age group with coverage in their\nown name.\nOther recent insurance expansions that were\nnot specific to young adults provide additional\nevidence about the potential impacts of access to\nhealth insurance on mental health and sub-\nstance abuse treatment. A natural experiment\nin Oregon in which low-income adults were ran-\ndomly offered the chance to enroll in public in-\nsurance found that the use of mental health treat-\nment surged among adults who received an\nopportunity to enroll and that expanded cover-\nage lowered the burden of depression symp-\ntoms.11 However, on average the Oregon sample\nwas both poorer and older than the people affect-\ned by the ACA dependent coverage provision.\nIn contrast, Ellen Meara and coauthors found\nno change in hospital-based care for behavioral\nhealth among people ages 19\u00ad25 in Massachu-\never, the reform increased financial protection\nfor people with behavioral health diagnoses.\nWe extend the recent literature by using data\nfrom the National Survey of Drug Use and\nHealth. This allowed us to estimate the impacts\nof the ACA dependent coverage provision on\ntreatment in a nationally representative popula-\ntion of young adults who screened positive for\npossible mental health or substance use dis-\norders.\nWe hypothesized that the provision would in-\ncrease the use of both mental health and sub-\nstance abuse services among people with likely\ndisorders. In addition to increasing use overall,\nwe expected that increasing private coverage\nrates would also lower out-of-pocket spending\nfor people already in treatment--an effect that\nhas been identified in previous insurance expan-\nsions and mental health coverage provisions.13,14\nThe ACA dependent coverage provision could\nalso change the setting and type of care received\nby people needing treatment, especially among\nthe previously uninsured. Uninsured people typ-\nically rely upon community clinics and other\nsafety-net providers.15,16 In contrast, it may be\nrelatively difficult for the uninsured to access\nspecialist and residential treatment for sub-\nstance use disorders and individualized psycho-\ntherapy for mental disorders.17 Gaining private\ncoverage could shift people toward specialty ser-\nvices and settings.\nStudy Data And Methods\nrounds of the National Survey of Drug Use and\nHealth, an annual cross-sectional survey of\nnoninstitutionalized people that is administered\nby the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Ser-\nvice Administration. The survey covers the use\nand abuse of drugs and alcohol, mental health\nproblems, and experiences with mental health or\nsubstance abuse treatment. Survey subjects are\nselected through a stratified random sample of\naddresses and answer questions using audio\ncomputer-assisted self-interviewing. To provide\nnationally representative estimates, we applied\nsurvey weights that adjusted for differential sam-\npling and nonresponse rates.\nOurmain groupof interest waspeopleages 19\u00ad\n25 who were likely to have either mental health\nor substance use disorders. However, because\nthe survey reports age in categories, we could\nnot exclude eighteen-year-olds. Therefore, our\nanalysis group was people ages 18\u00ad25. There\npeople met the criteria for and were included in\nboth groups). Our comparison group was people\nWe categorized people as possibly needing\nmental health treatment using a measure of se-\nrious psychological distress in the previous year.\nThe measure was based on the Kessler-6 inven-\ntory, a six-item scale designed to be used by lay\ninterviewers that includes questions about\nsymptoms of depression and anxiety.18 We cate-\ngorized people as possibly needing substance\nabuse treatment if they met screening criteria\nfor either dependence on or abuse of alcohol\nor drugs (not including tobacco).\nScreening measures of substance abuse or de-\npendence in the National Survey of Drug Use and\nHealth are based on the Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition\n(DSM-IV). They capture personal, legal, and\nschool or employment problems related to sub-\nstance use as well as problems in reducing use of\nthe substance. For example, if a respondent in-\ndicated that she drank alcohol, she would be\nasked questions about alcohol abuse such as,\n\"During the past twelve months did you have\nany problems with family or friends that were\nprobably caused by your drinking?\" She would\nalso be asked questions about alcohol depen-\ndence such as symptoms of anxiety and nausea\nafter cutting back on alcohol use.

This is because\nthe older people were assumed to be unaffected\nby the dependent coverage policy but affected by\nother time-varying factors, such as changes in\nthe labor market or in access to substances.\nTo capture the average impacts of the policy,\nwe used linear probability models. All models\nincluded indicators for age group and for wheth-\ner the person was observed in the post period,\nafter the implementation of the policy.\nEach estimate is the interaction between the\npost period and the group of people ages 18\u00ad25\nfrom a separate regression. For example, a posi-\ntive 0.10 difference-in-differences estimate for\nthe use of mental health treatment would signify\nthat changes during the post period in the rate of\nmental health treatment for people ages 18\u00ad25\nwas 10 percentage points greater than the\nchanges among people ages 26\u00ad35. In turn, this\nsuggests that the ACA dependent coverage pro-\nvision has had a positive effect on mental health\ntreatment.\nIn our preferred specification we excluded\ndata from 2010, since the provision was imple-\nmented in September of that year. However, our\nestimates were consistent when we treated 2010\nas a year in the pre period. We also included a\nlinear time trend.21\nOur preferred specification included covari-\nates only for race or ethnicity and for residence\nin a metropolitan area. In the online Appendix22\nwe report on regressions that included controls\nfor self-rated health, employment status, receipt\nof social services, income, education, and mari-\ntal status.\nIt is important to note that because differences\nwere measured relative to the comparison sam-\nple, a positive difference-in-differences finding\ncould occur either because an increase in the\noutcome over the baseline among people\nages 18\u00ad25 was larger than the increase among\npeople ages 26\u00ad35 or because there was no\nchange (or a smaller decline) relative to the base-\nline among the younger group during a period of\ndecline among the older group.\nTo display differences and difference-in-\ndifferences, we used predictive margins.23 Here\nwe present model-predicted rates for each age\npre and post periods) after adjustment for cova-\nriates.\nModels were weighted to be representative of\nthe US population. Standard errors and confi-\ndence intervals accounted for the stratified sam-\npling design.\nLimitations Some limitations should be con-\nsidered. First, we could not measure changes in\ndependent coverage versus changes in other\ntypes of private coverage, since the National Sur-\nvey of Drug Use and Health does not determine\nwhether private coverage is provided directly to\nthe person or as a dependent on someone else's\nplan.\nSecond, our study design allowed us to control\nfor time-varying factors that might have affected\ncoverage and access to care across different age\ngroups. However, we could not rule out the in-\nfluence of other simultaneously occurring fac-\ntors that might have had a disproportionate im-\npact on young adults. For example, young adults\nwere particularly affected by the economic down-\ntheless, our models were robust to controls for\nindividual employment status.\nThird, we could not determine whether or not\nsome effects were connected to the early impact\nof federal mental health parity.\nThe dependent\ncoverage provision\nshifted mental health\ntreatment costs for\nyoung adults to\nprivate insurers.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

This might have caused us to understate\nthe true effects of the ACA dependent coverage\nprovision.\nFifth, we could not examine detailed geo-\ngraphical differences, which might be pertinent\nbecause thirty-seven states had some form of\nextended dependent coverage provision before\nmore restrictive than the one in the ACA that\nsuperseded them, and there is little evidence that\nthe state provisions increased coverage.26,27\nSixth, because the survey respondents re-\nported on outcomes spanning the previous\ntwelve months, some of the respondents from\n2011 might have reported outcomes for a period\nwhen the extended dependent coverage policy\nhad not been fully implemented. This would also\ntend to understate the impact of the policy.\nSeventh, because we focused on subgroups\nwith possible illness, our study did not account\nfor effects of the provision among people who\nexperienced recovery. We did not observe any\npopulation-level changes in the prevalence of\nthese conditions during the study period. How-\never, such changes might occur in the long term.\nFinally, as is the case with all surveys that mea-\nsurestigmatized conditions and behaviors, there\nis possible nonresponse and social desirability\nbias in the results of the National Survey of Drug\nUse and Health. The surveyors mitigate these\nfactors by using audio computer-assisted self-\ninterviewing and survey instruments that are\ndesigned to reduce social desirability bias.28\nStudy Results\nSample Statistics Exhibit 1 presents character-\nistics of the samples with possible mental health\nand substance use disorders during the period\nbefore the provision was implemented (2008\u00ad\nhealth sample, compared to 38.5 percent in the\nsubstance use sample.

The coefficients for these estimates were\nin the hypothesized direction: The trends were\ntoward an increase in payment from both private\ninsurance and Medicaid and toward less un-\ninsured care among people ages 18\u00ad25, relative\nestimates were not significant (estimates were\nimprecise because of smaller sample sizes using\ntreatment). There were no significant changes in\nsettings for substance abuse treatment in the\nprevious year for the younger group relative to\nthe older group.\nFinally, we examined changes in reported cov-\nerage of alcohol and drug treatment among the\npeople in our sample with private insurance.\nBefore implementation of the ACA dependent\ncoverage provision, 64.83 percent of younger\nadults in the sample said that their coverage in-\ncluded alcohol treatment, and 65.09 percent said\nit included drug treatment (we excluded people\nwho responded \"don't know\") (Exhibit 5).\nDuring the study period the percentages of the\nyounger adultsreporting coverageof alcohol and\ndrug treatment remained relatively constant, but\nthe percentages declined substantially for the\nolder adults. Thus, after implementation of the\nACA dependent coverage provision, coverage of\nalcohol treatment was 13.01 percentage points\nhigher among the younger group than before\nimplementation, relative to the older group,\nand coverage of drug treatment was 12.68 per-\ncentage points higher.\nFull-Sample Estimates In addition, we ex-\namined regressions using the full population--\nthat is, not only people with possible mental\nhealth or substance use disorders. These regres-\nsions illuminated the potential impacts of the\nprovision on people with less severe symptoms\nwho may still receive treatment. They also cap-\ntured any changes in the burden of symptoms\nrelated to the implementation of the provision.\nThese results are displayed in the online Appen-\ndix,22 along with other additional sensitivity an-\nalyses.\nIn the full sample, the use of mental health\ntreatment increased by 1.30 percentage points\nabsolute scale, this is a much smaller change\nthan the 5.32-percentage-point reduction in\nthe subsample with possible mental health prob-\nlems. However, it represents a 12.1 percent rela-\ntive increase over the baseline treatment rate of\n10.8 percent (in comparison, the relative change\nfor the subsample with mental health problems\nwas 17.3 percent, as explained above).\nFull-sample estimates for mental health payer\nsource and treatment setting or type were also\nsimilar to the subgroup estimates.

Our study had four main findings.\nFirst, the provision substantially increased the\nuse of mental health treatment among people\nages 18\u00ad25 with possible mental illnesses, rela-\ntive to similar people ages 26\u00ad35. Second, there\nwas a 12.43-percentage-point decline in un-\ninsured mental health visits among the younger\nage group relative to the older one and a com-\nmensurate increase in visits paid for by private\ninsurance, as well as an increase in visits paid for\nby Medicaid. Third, there was no significant\nchange in the use of substance abuse treatment\noverall. Fourth, more people ages 18\u00ad25 who\nhad private insurance reported that their plan\ncovered drug and alcohol treatment after imple-\nmentation of the provision, relative to people\nOur findings related to mental health treat-\nment are consistent with other work suggesting\nthat private insurance became a greater payer\nfor these treatments among young adults after\nthe ACA dependent coverage provision4,5,29 and\nthat mental health treatment increased in that\nage group relative to others.6,10 As findings from\nthe Oregon study suggest,11 there may be pent-up\ndemand for mental health treatment among the\nuninsured, whofrequently do not seek treatment\nbecause of cost concerns.30\nIt is also important to consider the context of\nthe mental health findings. Some estimated\nchanges among young adults occurred because\nof relative, instead of absolute, increases in the\noutcomes.

For\nexample, at one large employer, expenses for\nadult dependent coverage enrollees were higher\nthan those for other comparable adults. None-\ntheless, the group enrolling through the ACA\ndependent coverage provision increased overall\nexpenditures by only 0.2 percent.10 Before imple-\nmentationof theprovision, theCentersfor Medi-\ncare and Medicaid Services estimated that it\nwould increase premiums by about 0.7 percent.31\nIn contrast to mental health treatment, we\nfound that there was no relative increase in the\nuse of substance abuse treatment. Previous work\nfocusing on state substance abuse parity found\nthat the policy--which lowered the cost of treat-\nment--also increased admissions.32 However,\nother studies have found that policies that re-\nduce the cost of substance abuse treatment have\na larger effect on shifting payer type for people\nalready in treatment than they do on increasing\nOne potential explanation is that expanded\ncoverage, on its own, may be insufficient to in-\ncrease demand for substance abuse treatment.\nExperience with the 2006 health reform in Mas-\nsachusetts suggests that barriers such as copay-\nments may continue to deter the use of services\namong those needing treatment.34 Noneconomic\nbarriers such as stigma are widespread35 and may\ndeter newly insured young adults from seeking\nsubstance abuse treatment. A limited supply of\nsubstance abuse treatment providers and wait-\ning lists to enter treatment could also deter some\nnewly insured people from seeking care.36\nIn addition to increasing coverage for previ-\nously uninsured people, the ACA dependent cov-\nerage provision may also have affected young\nadults who already had private insurance in their\nown name but chose to switch to their parents'\nplans to take advantage of more comprehensive\nbenefits.3 This is consistent with our finding that\nmental health and substance abuse coverage in-\ncreased during the study period among young\nadults relative to the comparison group. Sub-\nstance abuse benefits in particular have histori-\ncally been restricted in many private insurance\nplans.37 In our sample, fewer than two-thirds of\nthe respondents ages 18\u00ad25 believed that their\ncoverage included alcohol or drug treatment be-\nfore implementation of the ACA provision.\nThe Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equi-\nty Act of 2008--which requires most private in-\nsurers to offer behavioral health benefits that are\ncomparable to physical health benefits--is an-\nother major piece of federal legislation. It could\nconceivably have affected young adults dis-\nproportionately. However, reports indicate that\nimplementation of parity was slow,38 and rules\nThe federal parity law is one example of how\nthe dependent coverage provision must be con-\nsidered in the context of broader health system\nchanges. In 2014 the ACA made new Medicaid\nfunding available to cover poor adults--an ex-\npansion that roughly half the states have opted\nto adopt thus far. Additionally, coverage through\nnew health insurance Marketplaces was imple-\nmented nationally. In combination, new cover-\nage provisions are expected to increase the num-\nber of insured people by twenty-five million.40\nOne possibility is that new health insurance\noptions, coupled with more publicity about re-\nceiving care, will increase the awareness of treat-\nment options and the demand for mental health\nand substance abuse treatment, particularly\namong people who have not previously used\nsuch treatment. However, provider capacity in\nareas with higher demand could be strained,\nwhich would limit access.41\nConclusion\nThe ACA dependent coverage provision appears\nto be a stepping-stone toward increasing mental\nhealth treatment among young adults with pos-\nsible mental health problems. The act may also\nimprove the comprehensiveness of substance\nabuse coverage for young adults with substance\nuse disorders.\nThe long-term success of this provision will\ndepend on whether or not it links young adults\nneeding treatment to providers in their commu-\nnities and ensures continuity of treatment. En-\nabling people to remain in the care of their cur-\nrent providers may help ease transitions across\ninsurance plans. Young adults with treatment\nneeds are also likely to benefit from initiatives\nto increase chronic disease management and in-\ntegrate physical health care with other social and\nbehavioral health services. \nThe ACA dependent\ncoverage provision\nappears to be a\nstepping-stone toward\nincreasing mental\nhealth treatment\namong young adults.\nMental Health\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.
