    "abstract": "Abstract\nAnimals attend to what is relevant in order to behave in an effective manner and succeed in their environments. In several\nnonhuman species, there is an evolved bias for attending to patterns indicative of threats in the natural environment such as\ndangerous animals. Because skins of many dangerous animals are typically repetitive, we propose that repetition is the key feature\nenabling recognition of evolutionarily important threats. The current study consists of two experiments where we measured\nparticipants' reactions to pictures of male and female models wearing clothing of various repeating (leopard skin, snakeskin, and\nfloral print) and nonrepeating (camouflage, shiny, and plain) patterns. In Experiment 1, when models wearing patterns were\npresented side by side with total fixation duration as the measure, the repeating floral pattern was the most provocative, with\ntotal fixation duration significantly longer than all other patterns. Leopard and snakeskin patterns had total fixation durations that\nwere significantly longer than the plain pattern. In Experiment 2, we employed a visual-search task where participants were\nrequired to find models wearing the various patterns in a setting of a crowded airport terminal. Participants detected leopard skin\npattern and repetitive floral pattern significantly faster than two of the nonpatterned clothing styles. Our experimental findings\nsupport the hypothesis that repetition of specific visual features might facilitate target detection, especially those characterizing\nevolutionary important threats. Our findings that intricate, but nonthreatening repeating patterns can have similar attention-\ngrabbing properties to animal skin patterns have important implications for the fashion industry and wildlife trade.\n",

In the visual system,\neven with a large field of vision, organisms focus attention on\nrelatively small areas of the scene, which are analyzed in detail\n(Frintrop, 2006), providing for higher level processing such as\nobject recognition. Visual attention is a high-demand process,\nbeing pulled in every direction from the diverse input afforded\nby our complex world. Due to the amount of complex percei-\nvable sensory data in the environment, organisms are ecologi-\ncally adapted to attend to what is relevant in order to behave in\nan effective manner and succeed in their environments\nA review by Carrasco (2011) defined visual attention to\nconsist of three main types: spatial attention, object-based\nattention, and feature-based attention (FBA). Spatial attention\nrefers to selectively processing one location over another and\nobject-based attention is guided by recognizing the structure of\nthe object. In human and nonhuman primates, FBA refers to the\nprocess of recognizing specific aspects of objects such as color,\npattern, orientation, or direction of motion (Carrasco, 2011).\nAmong these three types of attention, one would expect FBA to\nbe most shaped by natural selection, because while locations\n1 School of Psychology, University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus, Semenyih,\nSelangor, Malaysia\nCorresponding Author:\nVivek Thuppil, School of Psychology, University of Nottingham Malaysia\nCampus, Jalan Broga, 43500 Semenyih, Selangor, Malaysia.\nEmail: vivek.thuppil@nottingham.edu.my\nEvolutionary Psychology\njournals.sagepub.com/home/evp\nCreative Commons CC BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/\nby/4.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE\nand Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nand object structures can vary infinitely, there are often com-\nmonalities among objects in terms of features.\nFBA can be selected for by natural selection to result in an\nattentional bias, which facilitate detection of threats, resources,\nmates, or other items that impact reproductive fitness. Atten-\ntional biases are present for recognizing various features of\nobjects, which imbue them with higher salience, making them\nstand out relative to their surroundings. Pattern orientation is\none such feature. For example, many primates capitalize on\nface and eye orientation of their conspecifics to focus their\nattention on objects of importance (Emery, 2000). Despite their\npoor visual acuity, African elephants have also been shown to\npick up on body orientation and differentially signal to request\nfood when the experimenter was facing the elephant as opposed\nAnother feature for which there is an attentional bias is direc-\ntion of movement. Animals across taxa such as flies (Jablonski\nfrogs (Yamamoto, Nakata, & Nakagawa, 2003), chickens\n(Evans, Macedonia, & Marler, 1993), monkeys (Schiff, Cavi-\nness, & Gibson, 1962), and humans (Vagnoni, Lourenco, &\nLongo, 2012) have been shown to recognize and respond to\nlooming stimuli, where the stimuli are approaching them.\nSimilarly, there is an attentional bias for responding to\npatterns that are indicative of threats and this bias has been\nobserved across animal taxa as well. Young African jewelfish\ninstinctively dart away when confronted with horizontal pat-\nterns of two facing eyes (Coss, 1979). Lab-born California\nground squirrel pups that have never been exposed to the wild\nare attentive when presented a snake-like pattern (Coss,\n1991). Congruently in primates, the repetitive scales of snakes\nappear especially salient (Etting & Isbell, 2014; Kawai & He,\n2016), bonnet macaques in Southern India exhibited greater\nalarm calling, greater frequency of flight, and a faster flight\ntime in response to a spotted leopard model compared to a\ndark leopard model without a spotted pattern (Coss & Ramak-\nSimilarly, natural selection is thought to shape the evolu-\ntion of visual system in humans too (Isbell, 2006). This\nevolved attentional bias persists in humans today, even among\nthose living in a highly modified, often urban environment,\nwhere animal threats are no longer present and patterns sig-\nnifying animal threats are no longer relevant. This is because\nthe present design of animals is determined by historical\nsources of selection (Tooby & Cosmides, 1990). As such, the\nattentional bias for detecting threats in the environment can\nstill be automatic triggers of attention (Tooby & Cosmides,\n1990). It has been shown that even small portions of snakeskin\nand snake scales are sufficient for detection and recognition\nby vervet monkeys (Isbell & Etting, 2017). Animals combine\nthe knowledge of animal patterns with that animal's behavior\nto respond appropriately. For example, bonnet macaques in\nIndia spent a greater proportion of time monitoring and obser-\nving when presented with a patterned model of a constricting\npython but startled or ran a greater proportion of encounters\nwhen presented with a patterned model of a venomous cobra,\nreflecting the various types of threats these two species of\nsnakes posed (Ramakrishnan, Coss, Schank, Dharawat, &\nThis automatic orientation of attention toward threat stimuli\ncould be related to the stimuli's associations with fear. This\nautomatic activation of a fear response was tested by O\n\u00a8 hman,\nFlykt, and Esteves (2001) who found that participants were\nconsistently faster at locating fear relevant stimuli compared\nto fear irrelevant stimuli against fear relevant and fear irrele-\nvant backgrounds. Penkunas and Coss (2013a) conducted a\nstudy on children and adults' abilities to detect historically\nimportant animal threats. Findings from the study revealed that\nAmerican children and adults were better at detecting poten-\ntially dangerous target animals in visual matrices of nondan-\ngerous animals (e.g., target snakes in arrays of lizards)\ncompared with nondangerous animals in visual matrices of\ndangerous ones (e.g., target antelopes in arrays of lions), where\nthe dangerous animals \"popped out\" in the matrix of nonthrea-\ntening distractors. These effects were found to be consistent\nwhen tested in urban and rural India where children may be\nmore likely to encounter threatening animals (Penkunas &\nCoss, 2013b). Eye tracking research using similar visual arrays\nof snakes and lizards and lions and antelope provided addi-\ntional support that dangerous animals can be visually salient\n(see Yorzinski, Penkunas, Platt, & Coss, 2014). In a related\ncontext, Vagnoni, Lourenco, and Longo (2012) tested partici-\npants with looming stimuli, measuring perceived time-to-\ncollision with the stimuli, found similar results. Participants\nunderestimated the time-to-collision for threatening stimuli,\nsuch as snakes and spiders, as opposed to nonthreatening images\nsuch as butterflies and rabbits.\nAs mentioned earlier, attentional biases are often based on\ncommonalities among objects in terms of features. For exam-\nple, natural selection for responding to looming stimuli has\nlikely acted upon a simple principle of physics: The angular\nsize of objects that are approaching will extend upon a larger\narea in the retina (Nalbach, 1990). We similarly propose that\nnatural selection has shaped the attentional bias for visual pat-\nterns with repetitive features, particularly tessellation. Tessel-\nlated patterns are complex geometrical patterns and shapes that\nare repetitive and comprise of stripes, spots, crossing-over\nlines, and many edges with no gaps in between or overlap. The\nfeatures of many threatening animals such as scorpion chitin,\nsnakeskin, or leopard skin, often feature tessellation. We pro-\npose that these repetitive patterns are visually conspicuous\nagainst the nonrepetitive randomness of the larger environ-\nment, allowing for natural selection to shape the visual system\nto respond selectively to these repeating patterns (cf. Coss,\nbehavior in response to these threats.\nFrom a historical perspective, these evolutionarily provoca-\ntive patterns have also played a role in human clothing. Dec-\norative clothing is thought to reflect and convey information\nregarding the wearer's self-image, personality, or social status\n(Kaiser, 1997), and thus a desire to stand out and be noticed.\nAnimal prints are often used for this purpose not just today but\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nhave been used for a large part of human history. Cultures\nvarying widely temporally and geographically, from cave\ndwellers in Southern Africa tens of thousands of years ago\nto the Aztecs in Mesoamerica a few hundreds of years ago,\nhave depicted humans and mythological creatures wearing\nvarious animal skins for ritualistic purposes (Jolly, 2002).\nOther innately provocative patterns and features have been\nsimilarly used. Forward facing eye-like patterns have been\nused across cultures in an apotropaic manner intended\nto divert gaze and protect the wearer from the \"evil eye\"\n\u00a8tterlin, 1989). In recent decades, patterns\nrepresenting dangerous animals such as leopards, snakes, and\ncrocodiles, among others, are commonly used in clothing and\naccessories. As a result, we considered clothing as a suitable\nmedium upon which to test the effectiveness of various pat-\nterns in capturing attention.\nWhile the evocative properties of evolutionarily important\nthreats are well established, the premise of whether repetition is\nthe key feature behind recognition of evolutionarily important\nthreats has not been empirically tested. The current study aims\nto empirically test this premise by examining how human\nrespondents react to pictures of models wearing clothing that\nbears different repeating and nonrepeating patterns including\nanimal skin patterns. Based on the literature, animal skin pat-\nterns should be the most provocative, which is to say that they\nshould capture attention faster and hold attention longer in\ncomparison with other nonanimal skin patterns. However,\nbecause we hypothesize that the driver of this evolutionary bias\nis pattern repetition, we broaden our hypothesis to predict that\nrepeating nonanimal print patterns on clothing should be\nequally as provocative as repeating animal print patterns on\nclothing. We hypothesize that both the animal skin patterns\nand the repeating nonanimal skin patterns should engender a\nshorter time to fixation and elicit longer fixation duration than\nthe nonrepeating nonanimal skin patterns.\nWe present below two experimental studies to test this pre-\nmise. In Experiment 1, we aimed to investigate attention bias\ntoward the various categories of test stimuli. We anticipated\nthat ecologically relevant patterns would lead to a longer fixa-\ntion duration compared to ecologically irrelevant patterns. In\nExperiment 2, we aimed to investigate the idea that potentially\nthreatening patterns \"pop out\" of the environment and into\nattentional focus relative to nonthreatening patterns. To exam-\nine pattern salience, we anticipated that participants engaged in\nthe visual-search task would locate repetitive clothing patterns\nfaster than nonrepetitive clothing patterns.\nExperiment 1\nExperiment 1 was a free observation task where participants\nobserved two pictures of the same model side by side on the\nscreen wearing different patterns on clothing. The purpose of\nExperiment 1 was to evaluate whether certain patterns were\nmore evocative than others, as evidenced by greater total fixa-\ntion duration from participants preferentially spending more\ntime looking at them. It was expected that ecologically relevant\npatterns would elicit greater total fixation duration compared to\necologically irrelevant patterns.\nMethod\nParticipants\nFifty-one students from the University of Nottingham Malaysia\nCampus took part in this experiment. Participants' ages ranged\nprising of 9 males and 42 females. All participants had normal\nor corrected to normal vision.\nEthics\nThe Science and Engineering Research Ethics Committee of the\nUniversity of Nottingham Malaysia Campus provided ethics\nApparatus and materials\nWe created stimuli consisting of four male and four female\nmodels in relaxed postures (Appendix A), each wearing six\ndifferent clothing patterns; leopard (Panthera pardus)\nrosettes print, Southeast Asian reticulated python (Python\nreticulatus) snakeskin print, floral design, camouflage shapes,\nplain surface, and shiny surface (Appendix B). Each model\nwas duplicated and the clothing pattern was edited for the six\ndifferent designs using GNU Image Manipulation Program\n(GIMP) Version 2.8.2. In this experiment, trials composed\nof images of the same model in different clothing patterns\nplaced side by side, in all possible combinations of the pat-\nterns. These combinations were randomized and counterba-\nlanced. Therefore, for this experiment, participants responded\nto 120 trials of model\u00adpattern combinations presented side by\nside. For each trial, an area of interest (AOI) was defined over\neach of the clothing patterns presented over which the eye\ntracker would monitor fixation (Figure 1). Hence, for each\ntrial consisting of two models wearing different patterns side\nby side, two areas of interest were defined. The experiment\nwas conducted using the Tobii Eye Tracker T120XL and the\nTobii Pro Studio software (version 3.1.6), which were used to\nprogram the task. All stimuli were automatically adjusted to\nmodels displayed to the participants on the eye tracker mea-\nsured 9.5 cm in height and 2.9 cm in width. Participants'\nviewing distance to the screen was approximately 48 cm.\nDesign\nA within-participants design was used. The independent vari-\nable was type of pattern, consisting of six levels (leopard,\nsnake, floral, camouflage, plain, and shiny).

After a calibration proce-\ndure with the Tobii Eye Tracker, the experiment began, which\nconsisted of one block of 120 randomized and counterbalanced\ntrials being made up of all combinations of patterns for all\nmodels. Each trial consisted of a duration of 4,000 ms, during\nwhich time a white fixation cross would first appear in the\ncenter of a black background for 1,000 ms followed by a pair\nof pattern-wearing models presented side by side for another\n3,000 ms. After this, the next trial would begin automatically,\nstarting with the fixation cross on a black background for 1,000\nms and then a new pair of pattern-wearing models presented\nwere completed. The experiment lasted a total of eight minutes\n(120 trials of 4 s each). Participants were instructed to look at\nthe fixation cross when it was present on screen but otherwise\nlook at the screen freely wherever they chose. See Figure 2 for\na diagrammatic representation of the experimental procedure.\nResults\nA repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was con-\nducted to investigate whether there was a main effect of pattern\n(leopard, snake, floral, camouflage, plain, and shiny) on the\ntotal duration of visual fixation.

However, we also found that, among the\nentire set of clothing patterns, the floral pattern engendered the\nlongest visual fixation. We propose that this might be a result of\nan attentional bias where participants were evaluating the intri-\ncate and complex aspect of the floral print.

The purpose of Experiment 2\nwas to evaluate whether certain patterns were more evocative than\nothers, as evidenced by a shorter time to first fixation from parti-\ncipants noticing them faster. It was expected that repetitive pat-\nterns, particularly ecologically relevant patterns, would elicit a\nshorter time to first fixation compared to nonrepetitive patterns.\nMethod\nParticipants\nForty-five students from the University of Nottingham Malay-\nsia Campus took part in this study. Participants' ages ranged\nprising of 8 males and 37 females. All participants had normal\nor corrected to normal vision. Participants taking part in this\nexperiment had also taken part in Experiment 1 and were there-\nfore familiar with the appearance of the models and patterns at\nthe start of the experiment. Both experiments were conducted\nduring the same session, with a short break provided for parti-\ncipants between Experiments 1 and 2.\nApparatus and materials\nWe created stimuli consisting of six male and six female mod-\nels (Appendix A), each wearing six different clothing patterns;\nleopard (P. pardus) rosettes print, Southeast Asian reticulated\npython (P. reticulatus) snakeskin print, floral print, camouflage\nprint, plain print, and shiny print (Appendix B). Each model\nwas duplicated and the clothing pattern was edited for the six\ndifferent designs using GIMP Version 2.8.2. In each of the 72\ntrials, a model wearing a pattern was placed in an image of a\ncrowded Dubai International Airport terminal (refer to\nAppendix C). The target models were placed in one of nine\ndifferent locations on the terminal image, from front to back\nand left to right. The size of the target varied depending on\nwhether it appeared in the front, middle, or back of the pic-\nture. The dimensions were 4.2-cm height \u00c2 0.9-cm width for\nthe front, 3.0-cm height \u00c2 0.8-cm width for the middle, and\n2.0-cm height \u00c2 0.5-cm width for the back. Participants'\nviewing distance to the screen was approximately 48 cm. The\nlocations were randomized and counterbalanced for the\nexperiment, so all of the patterns were observed on multiple\nmodels at each possible location to control for size effects. For\neach trial, an AOI was defined using rectangular AOIs (see\nFigure 4 for an example of AOIs) over the target model, with a\nsingle AOI being present during each trial.\nThe experiment was conducted using the Tobii Eye Tracker\nT120XL and the Tobii Pro Studio software, which was used to\nprogram the task. All stimuli were automatically adjusted to the\nDesign\nSimilar to Experiment 1, a within-participants design was used.\nThe independent variable was type of pattern, consisting of six\nlevels (leopard, snake, floral, camouflage, plain, and shiny). The\ndependent variable was the time to first fixation (fixation\nlatency) measured in ms. The time to first fixation was the period\nbetween the appearance of the image on the screen and when the\nparticipant shifted his or her attention by fixating the image AOI.\nProcedure\nParticipants were briefed on the task, and informed consent was\nobtained. After a calibration procedure, the experiment began,\nwhich consisted of one block of 72 trials. Each trial consisted of\nan image obtained from Google Images of a crowded terminal\nbuilding from Dubai International Airport with a model wear-\ning one of the clothing patterns in one of nine locations on the\nimage (top right, top center, top left, middle right, middle cen-\nter, middle left, bottom right, bottom center, and bottom left).\nThe same background image was used in all trials with only the\nlocation of the models being varied. The size of the model\nwearing the pattern was adjusted to match the size of other\nindividuals in the image around the target model. The location\nof the models on the image was randomized and counterba-\nlanced across the 72 trials. Each trial first began with a pre-\nparation screen with the text \"GET READY\" in white color\nfont in the center of a black background for 1,000 ms. This was\nthen followed by a white fixation cross appearing in the center\nof a black background for another 1,000 ms, after which the\nairport terminal image was presented. The participants had\nbeen instructed to examine the scene until they locate one of\nthe models they had seen previously in Experiment 1. When\nthey had located the target, they were instructed to provide a\nmanual response by clicking on the mouse in order to proceed\nto the next trial. See Figure 5 for a diagrammatic representation\nof the experimental procedure.\nResults\nA repeated measures ANOVA was conducted, measuring\nthe fixation latency in the visual-search task, to investigate\nFigure 3.

However, the snake-\nskin pattern did not show the anticipated effect. We propose\nthat this might be a result of the species of snakeskin used,\nwhich was prone to pattern blending when viewed at a dis-\ntance and thus resulted in higher variation in fixation of the\ntarget by participants leading to a nonsignificant compari-\nson. Surprisingly, the camouflage pattern was located sig-\nnificantly faster than the plain and shiny patterns, and we\npropose that this was due to the high contrast of the pattern\nthat made it stand out in the context of an airplane terminal\nFigure 5.

Examples of area of interest used in Experiment 2 where participants had to find the target model in the crowded airport terminal\nsetting.\n6 Evolutionary Psychology\nwhere typical pattern blending of the camouflage design\ncould not occur.\nGeneral Discussion\nOur findings support the hypothesis that repetition of specific\nvisual features might facilitate target detection, especially\nthose characterizing evolutionary important threats. In Experi-\nment 1, the animal skin patterns of leopard rosettes and snake-\nscale shapes elicited significantly higher total fixation duration\nthan the plain pattern. This is consistent with previous findings\nfrom literature that animal skin patterns are evocative (Coss,\n\u00a8 hman, Flykt, & Esteves,\nContrary to prediction, however, we also found that, among\nthe entire set of clothing patterns, the floral pattern engendered\nthe longest visual fixation. This result might reflect an atten-\ntional bias in which participants were evaluating the intricate\nand complex aspects of the floral prints (see Figure 7). This\nargument is consistent with the finding that the least decorative\nplain pattern sustained the reliably shortest attention among the\nset of clothing patterns. Our findings that the leopard and snake\nanimal patterns were less evocative than the floral pattern do\nnot support our hypothesis. It may be that the floral pattern was\nmore evocative as a result of familiarity (Hekkert, Snelders, &\nvan Wieringen, 2003), but this is unlikely because the floral\npattern that we used was a very intricate and repeating pattern\nthat is not commonly observed in floral prints. Another expla-\nnation is that the floral patterns were preferred because the\nanimal skin patterns engendered selective avoidance due to\ntheir provocativeness (Bradley, Costa, & Lang, 2015), but this\nis also unlikely because the animal skin patterns were selec-\ntively preferred compared to the plain pattern. A more likely\nexplanation of our findings are that the ecologically important\nproperties of these patterns are not relevant when presented in\nthe decorative context of clothing, in a situation where there is\nno apparent threat that can be evaluated by sustained fixation.\nThe floral pattern used in our experiment may have had\nenhanced visual appeal as a result of it having a combination\nof two salient features: aesthetically pleasing flowers and\nattention-grabbing repetitiveness.\nIn Experiment 2, when participants were required to locate\nthe pattern in a visual-search task, the animal skin pattern of\nleopard and the repetitive floral print patterns exhibited nearly\nequal mean fixation latency from participants. They both were\nlocated significantly faster than the plain and shiny patterns.\nThe speed of detection of the floral pattern supports the\nhypothesis that the repetitive properties of the floral pattern\nenhanced its conspicuousness. A complementary explanation\nis that by introducing artificial repetitiveness into a pattern\nmade up of flowers, the floral pattern evoked a sense of dan-\nger typically associated with snakeskin, or other repetitive\npatterns found on animals.\nWhile the snake and camouflage patterns had nearly equal\nmean fixation latencies, the camouflage pattern was detected\nsignificantly faster than the plain and shiny patterns, whereas\nthere was no significant effect toward faster detection of the\nsnake pattern compared to the plain and shiny patterns (p \u00bc\n.10). We used the Southeast Asian reticulated python for the\nsnakeskin pattern because it is a commonly used pattern for\nsnakeskin designs and we expected the repeating diamond\nshapes to be very provocative. The Southeast Asian reticulated\npython is a known predator of humans (Headland & Greene,\n2011), likely dating back to the late-Pleistocene when modern\nhumans first settled Southeast Asia. However, the fine cross-\nhatched snake scales are hard to resolve when viewed at a\ndistance (see Kawai & He, 2016), leaving only the larger\nFigure 6. Mean and standard error of fixation latency for clothing\npatterns in the visual-search task measured in milliseconds.\nFigure 7. Sample stimulus from Experiment 1, with a side-by-side\ncomparison of the floral and snake print patterns.\nShabbir et al. 7\ndiamond clusters framing the snake scales visible as the pre-\ndominant feature for capturing attention (Figure 7). This is a\nconsequence of pattern blending where surfaces of black and\nwhite squares or black and white spotted surfaces appear to be\nof an even gray tone when viewed from a distance (Mottram,\n1915). This may have resulted in the relatively higher variation\nin visual fixation of the target image by participants for the\nsnakeskin pattern and the nonsignificant effect in comparison\nwith the plain and shiny patterns.\nOn the other hand, the surprising evocativeness of the\ncamouflage pattern compared to the plain and shiny patterns\ncould be attributed to the complexity of the camouflage design\nand the high contrast and brightness of the pattern used relative\nto the surroundings. While the camouflage pattern may be\nrandom and blend into a natural setting with similar back-\ngrounds, when used in our experimental scenarios, particularly\nin the setting of an airport terminal mall in Experiment 2, it\nstood out substantially relative to its surroundings without the\nconsistency necessary for pattern blending to occur (see Mot-\nOur findings could have important implications for wildlife\ntrade. Animal skins and furs are traded to produce clothing,\nshoes, bags, decorations, and other items (Broad, Mulliken, &\nRoe, 2003). This trade consists of illegally (such as leopard\nskins) and legally (such as snakeskins) traded products (Broad\nthere was a surge in the use of animal skins in clothing in\nChina, with the previously uncommon trade being driven more\nby fashion than by tradition (World Bank, 2010). The use of\nanimal skins being driven by fashion in clothing and decoration\nmay be to reflect and convey information regarding the wear-\ner's self-image, personality, or social status (Kaiser, 1997), and\nthus a desire to stand out and be noticed.\nHowever, our findings indicate that animal skin patterns do\nnot carry their ecologically provocative properties through to\nclothing. Our findings suggest that an artificially created\nrepeating pattern or a high contrast pattern can carry equally\nprovocative properties through to clothing. For example, the\nfloral pattern held attention longer than any of the animal skin\npatterns; the camouflage pattern showed faster detection\nwhen compared against a plain pattern in a way that the snake-\nskin pattern did not. Our results show that in the context of\nclothing fashion trends could be driven toward these patterns\nas being more effective in reflecting wearers' desire to stand\nout and be noticed.\nIn conclusion, our findings support our broader hypothesis\nthat pattern repetition in clothing prints is a key visual feature\nthat captures and maintains attention. Rapid fixation of repeti-\ntive clothing patterns is similarly affected by pattern complex-\nity in which higher visual contrast captures attention much\nmore effectively than less contrasting shiny or plain clothing\npatterns. Future research on pattern repetition will address the\nunanticipated contextual properties of attentional biases to\nintricate but nonthreatening patterns.\n8 Evolutionary Psychology\nAppendix A\nFigure A1.
