If so, does it\nmake a difference how powerful they are? Constitutional\ndesigners of parliamentary systems would profit from robust\nscientific answers to these questions. Some might embrace\nupper houses in the hope of generating more diverse and\ninclusive cabinets, thus fostering the `consensual' character\nof democracy (Lijphart, 2012). Others might try to avoid\nany effect of upper houses on cabinet formation, so that\nlower house elections could be organized as choices between\nclearly identifiable cabinet alternatives (Powell, 2000).\nWhichever normative view one prefers, the practical conse-\nquences of parliamentary design depend on empirical facts.\nThe most sophisticated study to give clear answers to\nour questions is still that of Druckman, Martin and Thies\n(2005) (hereafter DMT): the study argues that, yes, upper\nhouses matter for cabinet formation, and no, how powerful\nthey are does not make a difference. DMT use conditional\nlogit models to study cabinet formation in eight democra-\ncies. They conclude, first, that cabinet alternatives that\ncontrol upper house majorities are more likely to form than\nthose that do not, everything else being equal. Second, they\nargue that this is true regardless of how constitutionally\npowerful upper houses are. Given the practical importance\nof these two conclusions, it is useful to ask how theoreti-\ncally plausible and empirically robust they are.\nIn this note we question DMT's findings. First, we argue\nthat the combination of answers proposed is theoretically\nimplausible (section 2). If rational coalition-builders make\nspecial efforts to gain upper house majorities, despite the sig-\nnificant costs of doing so, they can also be expected to care-\nfully consider the constitutional powers of these chambers.\nSecond, we argue that DMT's data does not support their\nconclusions (section 3). The results are driven exclusively by\nDo (weak) upper houses matter for\ncabinet formation?

If this case is recoded, there is no sta-\ntistically or substantially significant effect of upper houses.\nWe conclude that further research should apply DMT's pio-\nneering empirical approach to broader samples (section 4).\nTheory\nDMT rightly criticize many coalition-formation theories\nfor assuming parliaments to be `little more than loyal rub-\nber stamps of government initiatives' (p. 334). While this\nassumption is reasonable in many contexts, it becomes\nproblematic for minority cabinets and bicameralism. For\nthe latter case, DMT argue that if upper houses can affect\nthe success of government policies, and possibly induce\ntheir early termination, then coalition-builders have an\nincentive to build coalitions that control a majority in the\nupper house. DMT thus hypothesize that `of all the poten-\ntial governments that might arise in a given formation epi-\nsode, those with upper-house majorities are more likely to\nform, everything else being equal' (p. 535). Moreover, they\nsuggest that this is true even if an upper house has only\nweak legislative powers (p. 534).\nThe problem with this reasoning is that it neglects the\ncosts of achieving majorities in upper chambers. These\ncosts come mainly in the forms of a higher number of cabi-\nnet parties, greater ideological divisions or oversized cabi-\nnet status. If we consider these costs theoretically, we see\nthat they can provide coalition-builders with strong incen-\ntives not to control a second chamber majority. As we know\nfrom the literature on minority cabinets, cabinets do not\nnecessarily need a fixed legislative majority to secure the\npassage of their programme. Indeed, avoiding a fixed\nmajority can have significant advantages, such as the free-\ndom to form different coalitions on different issues, which\nmay greatly reduce the costs of coalition-building (Tsebelis,\nunidimensional, it would be sufficient to include the upper\nhouse median into the cabinet rather than seeking upper\nConsidering the costs of upper chamber majorities is\nimportant, because rational coalition-builders that seek a\nbalance between costs and benefits will be very attentive to\nthe formal powers of upper houses. The more powerful a\nhouse, the greater should be the incentive to secure majori-\nties within it (either by fixing this majority or by controlling\nthe median). DMT (p. 541) note research that shows how\neven formally weak upper houses can influence legislation\nunder certain conditions (e.g. Tsebelis and Money, 1997).\nThis is true as far as it goes, but accepting that weak upper\nhouses have the potential for some influence some of the\ntime is very different from assuming that they have the\nsame average causal effect as strong upper houses. Indeed,\nmost of the empirically successful literature on the legisla-\ntive effects of institutional `veto players' makes sharp\ndistinctions based on formal powers (Tsebelis, 2002). If\nformal powers matter for the explanation of the legislative\neffects of second chambers, however, it would be paradoxi-\ncal if they did not matter for the explanation of cabinet\nformation.\nWe believe that there is no paradox. Most of the qualita-\ntive evidence on the effects of upper houses on cabinet\nformation does focus on powerful veto players \u00ad as do\nDMT themselves with their illustrative example of Japan\nevidence in DMT's study for any causal effect of upper\nhouses. The study has not shown that the constitutional\npowers of upper houses do not matter.\nReplication\nDMT use the dataset by Martin and Stevenson (2001), but\nfocus only on the 8 of 14 countries with upper chambers (p.\n535). This is a small basis for drawing general conclusions,\nbut we stick to the sample for the sake of comparable\nresults.\nDMT distinguish between countries with symmetric and\nasymmetric bicameralism (Lijphart, 2012). Symmetric\nbicameralism means that the upper house has absolute veto\npower (on all or most important legislation) and sufficient\ndemocratic legitimacy to use it. If the upper house pos-\nsesses only suspensory veto power or lacks democratic\nlegitimacy, or both, bicameralism is asymmetric. Two\nbicameral systems in the sample were asymmetric (Ireland\nDMT also follow Martin and Stevenson in excluding all\nsituations in which single parties won a majority (p. 544,\nn. 9).1 DMT repeat the conditional logit analysis of Martin\nand Stevenson for the reduced sample and add a dummy\nvariable for `Upper-Chamber Majority'.2 We were able to\nreplicate the results of their conditional logit analysis\n(DMT's model 4),3 given in column (2) of Table 1.4 The\nstatistically significant coefficient of 1.11 implies an odds\nratio of 3.03, which means that majority status in the upper\nhouse triples the chances for a potential government to\nform.\nTo test for the relevance of upper house powers, DMT\nalso interact the majority status variable with an indicator\nfor whether or not the upper chamber has constitutionally\ngranted veto power. They do not present the results, but\nreport that they did not find any evidence for an interaction\neffect. They conclude that `upper chambers matter for gov-\nernment coalition builders, even if they are possessed of\nDMT's interaction model is shown in column (1) of\nTable 1 (model 1). Before we comment on the upper house\nmajority variable, note that several variables capture the\nEppner and Ganghof 3\ncosts of building inclusive cabinets and that the results are\nin line with our theoretical reasoning. Increasing the num-\nber of cabinet parties and increasing the ideological\ndifferences within the cabinet both reduce the likelihood\nthat a proto-coalition actually forms, everything else being\nequal. The estimated negative effect of oversized coalitions\nTable 1.

This evidence is in line with rationalist\ntheories.\nIn contrast, DMT's findings on the impact of upper\nhouses seem to contradict these theories. In model 1 the\nvariable `upper house majority' is interacted with a dummy\nthat is 0 for all upper houses with absolute veto power, and\n1 for those without.5 The results imply that symmetric upper\nhouses have no influence on government formation. The\noverall estimated effect of upper houses estimated by the\nauthors is driven exclusively by the (two) weak upper houses\nof Austria and Ireland.6 To show this more clearly, we esti-\nmate DMT's main `model 4' (Table 1, column (2)) only for\nthe six countries with symmetric upper houses (column (3)).\nWe see that the coefficient is almost cut in half and not sta-\ntistically significant. As argued above, if these results were\nrobust, they would contradict rationalist theories. Rational\ncoalition-builders should be more, rather than less, willing\nto take upper houses into account, despite the potential costs\nof doing so, when these houses are powerful.\nCloser inspection of the data shows, however, that the\nresults are not robust. Instead, the evidence suggests that\nupper houses do not matter at all, at least in DMT's sample.\nThe reason is that the Irish case adds only four government\nremoving those four is sufficient for the coefficient to\nbecome insignificant (column 4). This fact is highly prob-\nlematic for two reasons. First, the idea that the Irish upper\nhouse (Seanad) affects cabinet formation is not corrobo-\nrated by in-depth case evidence (Coakley and Laver, 1997;\nIrish Senate is not only similar to that of the first chamber,\nbut a newly elected prime minister has the right to nominate\n11 out of the 60 upper house members to ensure a govern-\nment majority in the second chamber. Hence, `rather than\nthe Seanad having any impact on the composition of the\ngovernment, it is currently the government ... that has an\nimpact on the composition of the Seanad' (Coakley and\ndistorts this procedural reality. For each Irish formation\nopportunity, they code the Senate composition after the\nnew prime minister's nominations have taken place. It is\nthus hardly surprising that all actually formed governments\nheld upper chamber majorities, while few alternative proto-\ncoalitions could count on majorities in the Senate.\nColumn 5 shows DMT's `model 4' with more adequate\ncoding. We gathered data on upper house composition and\nassigned each Irish proto-coalition its potential upper house\nstatus (should it form a government and be able to nominate\nmembers in the newly elected Senate). Simply re-coding\nthe four Irish cabinet formations in this way is sufficient for\nthe coefficient to be substantially reduced and lose statisti-\ncal significance, even if all eight countries are included in\nthe analysis (compare columns (2) and (5)).\nConclusion\nIn sum, DMT provide no convincing evidence that upper\nhouses affect government formation. On the basis of their\nsample, we would have to conclude that neither symmetric\nnor asymmetric bicameralism affects cabinet formation. It\nwould clearly be premature to draw firm conclusions, how-\never, as their analysis includes only eight bicameral sys-\ntems. Other studies which cover larger sets of countries and\nfocus exclusively on symmetric bicameralism do report evi-\ndence that upper houses affect cabinet formation (Ganghof,\nuse conditional or mixed logit models. The literature simply\nlacks robust answers to questions of whether upper houses\naffect cabinet formation and how their formal powers and\ndemocratic legitimacy mediate the relationship.\nFuture research should follow in DMT's footsteps and\napply conditional or mixed logit models to larger and more\ndiverse samples. Our theoretical expectation is that if upper\nhouses do matter for cabinet formation \u00ad and it is not theo-\nretically obvious that they do \u00ad their formal powers (and\ndemocratic legitimacy) must also matter, because rational\ncoalition-builders care about the costs of inclusiveness.\nThis reasoning also implies the possibility that coalition-\nbuilders might content themselves with controlling the\nupper house median rather than an upper house majority.\nThese different theoretical possibilities can only be arbi-\ntrated empirically. Despite DMT's pioneering effort, much\nwork remains to be done before we might be able to pro-\nvide constitutional designers with reliable conclusions.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency\nin the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nNotes\n1. This is somewhat surprising, as in DMT's main qualitative\nexample to motivate their main hypothesis \u00ad a cabinet for-\nmation in Japan \u00ad a single party controlled a majority in the\n2.

There is some debate about the adequacy of the conditional\nlogit model (Glasgow et al., 2012). Indeed, if we estimate a\nmixed logit model using DMT's data set, there is no signifi-\ncant effect of second chambers even ignoring the problems\nwe discuss in this note.\n4. We downloaded the replication files from the authors'websites.\n5. DMT also estimate an additional interaction model that\nuses a slightly different indicator for the strengths of\nupper houses. The alternative indicator treats the Dutch\nEppner and Ganghof 5\nupper house as asymmetric because it cannot propose or\namend legislation. The results of this analysis do not differ\nsubstantially.\n6.
