Novel networks and partnerships across\nsectors are emerging in cities, holding out the promise of innovative approaches to governing\ncomplex and uncertain environmental challenges (Gerlach and Rayner,1988). We refer to\nnetworks and partnerships as somewhat formalized, stable, and ongoing relationships among\nsmaller and larger numbers of actors with the purpose of mobilizing resources (financial,\ntechnical, human, knowledge, etc) to achieve a collective goal--in this case urban climate\nchange mitigation and adaptation (Weber and Khademian, 2008).\nIn this theme issue the authors undertake an examination of these emerging partnerships\nand attempt to theorize the potential and emerging roles of private and civil society governance\nin the wider context of nonstate actors (Friedman etal, 2005; Josselin and Wallance, 2001;\nunderstand the role of local actors, such as urban businesses and civil society organizations,\nas agents of change in the multilevel governance of climate change in relation to the public\nsector, and cities as niche spaces in which sustainable development paths might be explored.\n762 H Schroeder, S Burch, S Rayner\nIt includes case studies of major urban areas around the world that examine the dynamics\naround emerging partnerships between various levels of government and/or small businesses\nand civil society to address climate change mitigation and adaptation.\nWe seek to enhance understanding of the evolving modes of climate change governance\nin cities, especially in the context of networks and partnerships across multiple levels\nofgovernment and various sectors of the economy. We elaborate upon the challenges of\ninstitutional path dependency, as it relates to climate change policy development, and bring\nthe small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector into discussions of climate change\ngovernance. SMEs can be seen as the `silent majority' of businesses, as they make up\napproximately 95% of businesses in the UK alone and account for some 60% of commercial\nemissions of greenhouse gases, yet are not included in any legislation on mitigating climate\nBy covering a wide range of actors, sectors, and cases from both developed and\ndeveloping countries and on both mitigation and adaptation, we address three main themes.\nFirst, we provide theoretical framings and pose key research questions. Second, we illustrate\nthe varied ways in which partnerships between multiple levels of government and sectors are\ntransitioning toward sustainability in urban spaces and what obstacles may be encountered\nalong the way. Third, we delve into issues of community and stakeholder participation in\ndecision making, including the role of networks in urban climate governance and barriers to\nengaging with otherwise marginalized stakeholders.\n2 Theoretical framings and key research questions\nWhile global climate change policy has floundered, subnational and local action appears\nto be accelerating (Okereke etal, 2009). Nonstate actors are taking an increasingly central\nrole, and may be having greater success in pushing through the process of greenhouse gas\nreduction target setting, policy design, and implementation (Lovell and Liverman, 2010;\nNew etal, 2011; Schroeder and Bulkeley, 2009). Examination of the dynamic interplay\nbetween nonstate, or subnational, actors (such as municipalities, state and provincial\nauthorities, nongovernmental organizations, and civil society groups) is forming the core of a\nburgeoning body of policy-relevant and interdisciplinary governance theory. Whether formal\nor informal, partnerships between multiple sectors, organizations, and levels of governance\nenable the pooling of expertise, capacity, experience, and creativity. They also allow for the\nextension of reach for any single actor. New constellations of actors allow for their collective\neffectiveness to be higher than the sum of their individual efforts. Cases abound where urban\nclimate mitigation action was possible due to the forming of strategic partnerships involving\npublic and private actors (eg, Bulkeley and Schroeder, 2012).\nThisbodyoftheoryisexpandingnotonlytoplacegreateremphasisonthesenonstateactors,\nbut also to include a greater diversity of actors, such as SMEs. While SMEs have traditionally\nbeen depicted as laggards on the environment which underplay their environmental impacts\nand resist environmental legislation due to the perceived associated costs, recently a small\nnumber of SME owners and managers have responded to calls for environmental and climate\nchange action. Seeing the potential cost savings, opportunity for winning over new customers,\nhigher staff retention rates, and good publicity, some SMEs are recognizing that a transition\nto a low-carbon economy will bring more opportunities than burdens (Revell etal, 2010).\nThere is clearly untapped potential for innovation here: entrepreneurs play a crucial role as\nproblem solvers, taking risks where others might avoid them (Beveridge and Guy, 2005).\nEven so, SMEs in particular face coordination challenges, as their individual influence is\nlimited and resources are often constrained, especially in a developing country context (Boyd\nand Ghosh, 2013; Setzer and Biderman, 2013). This suggests a role for partnerships between\nNovel multisector networks and entrepreneurship 763\ngovernment, nongovernmental organizations, and small businesses to fill capacity gaps and\nstimulate market-based responses to environmental challenges.\nThe challenge is to incorporate such emerging trends into our understanding of the\nmultilevel governance of sustainability transitions. Theories of governance have made\nsignificant progress towards a deeper understanding of the role and capacity of cities to\naddress climate change, while capturing the complexity of interests, actors, and institutional\narchitectures at play in the development and implementation of environmental policy. One\nsuch approach is multilevel governance, which grew out of the study of the process of\nMultilevel governance embodies the notion that greater collaboration amongst academic\napproaches, and across theoretical and empirical models, is required to gain a more coherent\nunderstanding of political phenomena (Bache and Flinders, 2004). A core element of this\napproach is a critique of the false dichotomy between domestic and international politics\n(Marks etal, 1996). Similarly, multilevel governance theory suggests that an exclusive focus\non state actors precludes a nuanced understanding of the interactions between state and\nnonstate actors in the governance of global environmental change issues.\nMultilevel governance as a theoretical frame has been particularly useful for studies of\nthe role of cities in climate change mitigation, given that cities are politically, jurisdictionally,\nand financially bounded by higher levels of government (Betsill and Bulkeley, 2006; Burch,\nto this body of theory by examining the relationship between subnational and federal climate\nchange policies in the United States, articulating a theory of `boomerang federalism'in which\nlocal efforts stimulate federal initiatives that return to support the local. She finds, however,\nthat there are costs associated with implementing climate policy through hybrid arrangements\ninvolving business and local governmental actors, potentially creating additional challenges\nto federal policy making. Fisher shows that coordination across levels of governance is\ncrucial, reducing transaction costs and facilitating communication.\nAn examination of current multilevel governance approaches to climate change and\nsustainability transitions, combined with theories of corporate social responsibility, reveals\na series of gaps, which suggest research questions that are in part addressed by the papers\nin this issue. First, can we discern political and/or legislative drivers of this partnership\nformation that includes not only the regional authority and municipal governments but also\nsmall businesses? Burch etal (2013) address this question and conclude that cities may view\nengagement with small businesses as a proxy for awareness raising amongst the general\npublic, while small businesses are seeking resources and political influence. Policy at higher\nlevels of government, such as the provincial government in this case, is a crucial trigger of\npartnerships that involve a variety of subnational actors. This suggests that innovation at\nmultiple levels is required to foster these polycentric sustainability transitions, with each\nactor playing a very specific role.\nEven in the presence of coordination and legislative or political triggers, however, novel\nclimate governance arrangements will not succeed without specific quantities and qualities\nof capacity. Romero-Lankao etal (2013) address this question with a particular focus on\ninstitutional response capacity. This comparative case study demonstrates that efforts to\naddress climate change in cities will remain secondary to the top priority of growth, unless\na more integrative analysis of institutions is undertaken. While an early leader may, in\nsome cases, possess greater institutional response capacity, challenges such as institutional\nfragmentation and technocratic decision making may still arise. Similarly, a series of `building\nblocks' is required, according to Shey and Belis (2013), if successful environmental regimes\nare to be constructed in urban environments. These building blocks are especially important\n764 H Schroeder, S Burch, S Rayner\nin the context of nonstate actors, and include coalition building, collaborative agenda setting,\nand cooperation. Ultimately, a multilevel governance framing of responses to climate change\nin cities suggests that a systems lens must be employed in order to more carefully elucidate\nthe actors, networks, and capacities at play.\n3 Obstacles and pathways toward sustainability transitions\nHaving theorized the role of partnerships and networks across multiple levels of government\nand sectors above, we now explore the structural obstacles and pathways toward sustainability\ntransitions and low-carbon urban development through involvement of SMEs and civil\nsociety. Novel networks, partnerships, and entrepreneurship across levels of governance and\nsectors are in a unique position to create new social mobilization (Bulkeley and Moser, 2007)\nand reveal opportunities for eroding the inertia behind unsustainable practices (Burch, 2010).\nTransition management, nested within the study of sociotechnical systems, emphasizes\na systems approach to sustainable development, geared toward enabling, facilitating, and\nguiding social, technical, and political transformations as prescribed by the embedded\nsocietal systems to bring about sustainable practices (Loorbach, 2010; Meadowcroft, 2009).\nIt recognizes the complex makeup of modern society with its multiple perspectives, norms,\nand values as well as the manifestation of problems across multiple actors, levels, and\ndomains (Arthur, 1989; David, 1994). This leads it to adopt a perspective that encourages\nmultiactor participation to strengthen bottom-up decision making and incentivization and\nsocial learning toward more sustainable choices. Transition management advocates for the\nneed to completely transform the system and radically rebuild societal systems to transcend\nthe lock-in to unsustainable systems through the fabrics of the wider embedded systems at\nKillip (2013) employs transition theory and a systems lens to illustrate the common policy\ndisconnect between markets that are in reality fundamentally linked (such as the appliance\nmarket and the multiple markets that influence energy use in buildings). Killip proposes an\ninstitutional infrastructure that might cross the traditional boundaries between actors and\nrules, aligning training, standard setting, and compliance monitoring. Through applying the\ntheory of market transformation to the case of refurbishment of UK housing, Killip finds\nthat coordination across, first, the fragmented constellation of actors involved and, second,\nthe domains of policy, research, and practice is where the bottleneck toward low-carbon\ndevelopment is situated. This operationalization of transition management theory is a step\ntowards the creation of transferable lessons that will be of use to other communities that are\nsetting out on sustainability transitions.\nBerkhout and Westerhoff (2013) divide the transition process into four stages: (1)\ndestabilization, (2) fermentation, (3) standardization, and (4) stabilization. Destabilization is\na period of rising tension for change, followed by fermentation--that is, actions undertaken to\nopen up `cracks' into which new discourses may be inserted. Then alternative arrangements\ncan compete until eventually a single new standard emerges (standardization). Finally,\nconsensus around what constitutes the system's new standard strengthens and becomes taken\nfor granted (stabilization). Moving through these stages is wrought with difficulty, as the\ncase study of the Canadian Province of British Colombia (BC) by Berkhout and Westerhoff\nillustrates. The bottleneck in this case was for networks to move beyond the early fermentation\nstage. The network which was set up to transform energy in BC in the built environment is\nthus far contributing to disseminating new discourses and knowledge on climate and energy\nmeasures, but it is lacking the momentum to move further.\nThe case of urban adaptation governance in Helsinki, Finland demonstrates how the\nabsence of cooperation across public and private sectors leads to suboptimal outcomes in that\nregulatory systems do not help the private sector to minimize losses after an extreme-weather\nNovel multisector networks and entrepreneurship 765\nevent, because these are thus far predominantly reactive, rather than anticipatory. As a result,\nprivate sector organizations have set out to increase their coping capacity independently of\nWhen civil-society groups and the broader communities which they can mobilize have\nthe capacity to design and implement significant urban sustainability projects, the ability to\ntransition is much stronger (Aylett, 2013). Niches within the urban landscape can then be\ncreated that allow coordination of novel partnerships between state, community, and private\nsector actors and local SMEs to develop and refine their businesses practices. The crucial\npoint is that then civil society and local businesses can act with a speed and tolerance for\nrisk that is far higher than that of municipal governments. They are able to translate complex\ntechnological shifts into a language and a process that resonates with the communities, which\nthe programs are destined to serve. And, finally, by working at the community level and\nharnessing the social momentum generated by processes of collective accomplishment, they\ncan generate reinforcing cycles of social and technological transformation (Aylett, 2013).\nLocal action is effective in tackling global issues when the policy objective is viewed within\nthe context of local needs and is framed within the resource capacity of the local governing\n4 The role of novel community participation and engagement\nNext, we discuss the drivers, barriers, and dynamics of stakeholder participation in decision\nmaking and the role of networks in urban climate governance and in bringing about\nsustainability transitions. The case studies presented in this theme issue both highlight\nthe ingredients of successful community engagement--including trust, accountability,\ntransparency, and good communication (eg, Aylett, 2013; Shey and Belis, 2013); they also\nillustrate the limitations which local government is faced with in its ability to operate and\nAn example of successful community engagement can be found in Portland's Solarize\nscheme, a community-managed solar energy programme that has managed to transform\nthe local and regional market for solar energy in Portland, Oregon (Aylett, 2013). The\nsuccess of this scheme is undoubtedly due to the unique position occupied by local NGOs\nand community members. Rooted in their communities, local activists were trusted to find\nkey partners, mobilize volunteers, and initiate programmes. Being outside of government\nallowed them to take risks and experiment without having to worry about any larger political\nimplications from their plans. But importantly, \"because they were from the community they\ncould build a program that was truly of the community.\" This enabled the activists to frame\na complex process of technological change in the language and logic of the communities\nwithin which they operated.\nShey and Belis (2013) also highlight ways in which local actors can work across\ninstitutional and structural boundaries to govern climate change by looking at food\nproduction in Minneapolis. In 2008 the city launched Homegrown Minneapolis, a multiple\nstakeholder initiative bringing together local government actors, businesses, and NGOs to\nbuild a sustainable and local food system as an example of governing climate change in\nurban areas. Accountability, transparency, and communication between the Food Council\nand community have been given a high priority, as demonstrated by its website, which posts\nall meeting information, reports, and activities. Other priorities include increasing access\nto local food in public venues (eg, sports stadiums) and expanding the city's organic waste\ncollection. Spillover effects include the emergence of additional community and business\nactivities around the central theme of creating a sustainable, healthy, and local food system\nin Minneapolis and the city's new climate policy initiative.\n766 H Schroeder, S Burch, S Rayner\nThe two cases of developing country cities--Mumbai, India and S\u00e3o Paolo, Brazil--\nshow that the state is standing in the way of greater civil society and business participation\n(Boyd and Ghosh, 2013; Setzer and Biderman, 2013). By exploring local climate innovations\nin Mumbai, India to understand the drivers and barriers of success, Boyd and Ghosh (2013,\npage941) show how \"local government provides only the backstop and NGOs stand out\nas highly important climate-development connectors.\" The state, mired in geopolitical\nphraseology, is too slow in responding to the need for adaptation governance. Boyd and\nGhosh find that one of the biggest barriers is the lack of municipal resources to support\ninnovations. They use the example of Sunshine Coop to illustrate how technical expertise and\nconsultation can be provided by only NGOs.\nExamining S\u00e3o Paolo's climate change policy, Setzer and Biderman (2013) find limited\nparticipation by civil society and businesses in its formulation.They argue thatimplementation\ncan succeed only if the private sector--in particular, civil construction, transport, and solar\nenergy SMEs--is brought in. SMEs are particularly crucial for the transport sector because\nthey make up a significant proportion of the city's economic activity while to date having\nbeen largely overlooked by policy makers. The authors see a huge potential for transport\nconsultancy firms, academia, and think-tank representatives to help define appropriate\nregulation on climate change.\nIt seems that governments have developed a \"disingenuous and unproductive relationship\nwith their constituents\" because they have too narrowly invested in a strategy that would just\n\"implore, inform, and `incentivize' their citizens to change their individual or household\n871). Limitations were found in that local governments\nand bureaucracies have limited resources and limited positions within the broader urban\ncommunity, preventing them from facilitating broader sociotechnical shifts throughout the\ncity. In sum, \"the transformation of our cities must be a collective process\" (page871).\n5 Conclusions and ways forward\nTaken together, the papers in this theme issue advance our understanding of multilevel\ngovernance of sustainability issues in the urban context. By more carefully examining the role\nof nontraditional actors, and bringing to bear increasingly powerful theoretical approaches\nsuch as sustainability transitions theory, we gain a greater understanding of the variety\nofapproaches being employed around the world, as well as the transformative potential of\nthese approaches. We see how the role of the state is stronger if \"[l]ocal leadership catalyz[es]\nthe process, knowledge exchange, and community-wide collaborative engagement\" (Shey\nand Belis, 2013, page907) and how \"community organizations...lead by example outside\nof processes that depend on the transformation of the local state as a precondition for changes\nStill required, however, are compelling multiple cross-case analyses, longitudinal\nstudies, and meta-analyses that make use of the growing abundance of unlinked and\nwidely variable data. Key questions remain: how can successful experiments in the\ncreation of innovation networks be transferred, scaled up, and accelerated in both similar\nand dissimilar communities? What is the most effective blend of `steering' and emergence\nthat allows novel climate change governance arrangements to sprout and bear fruit? What\nsociopolitical, economic, and ecological indicators can most compellingly and accurately\ncapture transformation in development pathways? This theme issue offers a foundation upon\nwhich further investigations can be built--a task for governance, sustainability transitions,\ncommunity engagement, and business administration alike.\n"
