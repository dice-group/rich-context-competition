Gene expression of the components of the\nrenin angiotensin system and that of macrophage markers were significantly higher in apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice fed an HCD than in\nthose fed a chow diet (CD). These changes were absent both in angiotensin II (AngII) receptor blocker (ARB)-treated\napoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice and in Ang II type 1 (AT1\n) receptor-deficient apoE\u00ad/\u00ad (Agtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad) mice. To evaluate their effect on\natherosclerosis, we transplanted tPAT into apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice alongside the distal abdominal aorta. Transplanted tPAT was\nharvested from apoE\u00ad/\u00ad and Agtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice fed a CD (tPAT-CD/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad, tPAT-CD/Agtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad), HCD (tPAT-\nHCD/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad, tPAT-HCD/Agtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad), or HCD in combination with ARB treatment (tPAT-HCD/ARB/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad).\nFour weeks after transplantation, a significantly increased oil red O-positive area was observed in the aorta of tPAT-\nHCD/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice than in tPAT-CD/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice. Such a change was absent in tPAT-HCD/ARB/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad and tPAT-HCD/\nAgtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice.\nConclusions: Our findings demonstrated that AT1\nreceptor plays a crucial role in HCD-induced phenotypic alterations\nof tPAT, modulation of which could exert beneficial effects on atherosclerosis.\n",

However, recent studies show that PAT\nsecretes numerous vasoactive molecules involved in vas-\ncular remodeling and vasoreactivity.6\u00ad10 Takaoka et al.\nfound elevated expression of pro-inflammatory genes and\nlower adiponectin expression in the PAT of obese mice,\nTransplantation of periaortic\nadipose tissue from angiotensin\nreceptor blocker-treated mice\nmarkedly ameliorates atherosclerosis\ndevelopment in apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice\nDaisuke Irie, Hiroyuki Kawahito, Noriyuki Wakana, Taku Kato,\nSou Kishida, Masakazu Kikai, Takehiro Ogata, Koji Ikeda,\nTomomi Ueyama, Satoaki Matoba and Hiroyuki Yamada\n Keywords\nThoracic periaortic adipose tissue, atherosclerosis, renin angiotensin system, macrophage, adipokines\nDepartment of Cardiovascular Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University\nof Medicine, Japan\nCorresponding author:\nHiroyuki Yamada, Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Kyoto\nPrefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto,\nEmail: hiyamada@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp\nOriginal Article\n68 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(1)\nand concluded that this contributed to exaggerated neoin-\ntimal formation following arterial injury.11 Chatterjee et\nal. also found elevated pro-inflammatory gene expression\nand diminished adiponectin expression in the PAT sur-\nrounding diseased human coronary arteries.12 These find-\nings suggested that, through its paracrine effects on\nvasculature, PAT influenced the development of athero-\nsclerosis. However, the precise roles of PAT in atherogen-\nesis remained unknown.\nThoracic periaortic adipose tissue (tPAT) surrounding\nthe descending thoracic aorta has similar characteristics to\nthose of brown adipose tissue13 and has recently become a\nfocal point of cardiovascular disease risk assessment. Fox\net al. reported that the volume of tPAT, quantified by com-\nputed tomography, correlated with the incidence of periph-\neral arterial disease.14 These authors also found that a high\nvolume of tPAT in the absence of a high volume of visceral\nadipose tissue correlated with a higher prevalence of car-\ndiovascular disease.15 Considering that phenotypic altera-\ntionsoftPAT,suchashigherexpressionsofpro-inflammatory\ncytokines accompanied by inflammatory leukocytes infil-\ntration, were observed in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD),12\nthese changes likely had a proatherogenic effect. However,\nChang et al. recently reported that, owing to reduced ther-\nmogenic capacity, the absence of tPAT in their gene-manip-\nulated mouse model exaggerated atherosclerosis\ndevelopment upon cold exposure.16 These findings led us to\nhypothesize that, depending on the phenotypic alterations\nthat occur under specific conditions, tPAT plays contrasting\nroles in the development of atherosclerosis.\nWe have previously reported that tPAT-specific activa-\ntion of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) occurred in\nuninephrectomized apoE-deficient (apoE\u00ad/\u00ad) mice, and that\nthis was partially responsible for the accelerated atheroscle-\nrotic development observed in chronic kidney disease.17\nHere, we examined high-cholesterol diet (HCD)-induced\nphenotypic alterations in tPAT, and investigated their roles\nin atherosclerosis development using a tPAT transplanta-\ntion model. An HCD promoted the expression of RAS\ncomponents as well as that of macrophage markers. Such\nchanges were not observed in epididymal white adipose tis-\nsue (WAT). These tPAT-specific phenotypic alterations\nwere absent both in angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor blocker\n(ARB)-treated apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice and in Ang II type 1 (AT1\n)\nreceptor-deficient apoE-/- (Agtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad) mice. We dem-\nonstrate for the first time that, compared to tPAT from chow\ndiet-(CD) fed apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice, transplantation of tPAT from\nHCD-fed apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice significantly exaggerates athero-\nsclerosis development in the entire aorta. Further, trans-\nplantation of tPAT from ARB-treated apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice or\nAgtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice markedly inhibited atherosclerosis\ndevelopment when compared to tPAT transplantation from\ncontrol mice. Our findings suggest that HCD-induced phe-\nnotypic alteration of tPAT, mediated by AT1\nreceptor,\ndirectly contributes to atherosclerosis development, and\nthat therapeutic targeting of the phenotypic changes of\ntPAT could potentially remediate and prevent cardiovascu-\nlar diseases.\nMethods\nAnimals\nApoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice (C57BL/6) were obtained from Taconic Co.,\nLtd. (Germantown, NY, USA). AT1a\nreceptor-deficient\n(Agtr1\u00ad/\u00ad) mice (C57BL/6) were obtained from Tanabe\nSeiyaku Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Agtr1\u00ad/\u00ad mice were\ncrossed with apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice. Heterozygous animals were\ncrossed until homozygous double knockout (Agtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/\napoE\u00ad/\u00ad) mice were obtained (backcrossed > 10 times).\nEight-week-old male apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice were fed a CD or HCD\n(36% fat, 1.25% cholesterol; Oriental Yeast Co., Tokyo,\nJapan) in combination with ARB (Olmesartan, 1 mg/kg/\nday) or saline (using an osmotic minipump) for four or\neight weeks. Eight-week-old male Agtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice\nwere fed a CD or HCD for four or eight weeks. The animals\nwere housed in a room that was maintained at 22\u00b0C under a\n12-hour light/dark cycle and were provided with drinking\nwater ad libitum. Mice were anaesthetized using isoflurane\n(2%, 0.2 ml/min) throughout the surgery during transplan-\ntation. The depth of anesthesia was confirmed by lack of\ntail pinch response. A laparotomy was performed under\nsterile conditions with the assistance of an operating stere-\nomicroscope. A periaortic fat pad near the descending tho-\nracic aorta (tPAT) was harvested from 16-week-old donor\napoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice, fed for eight weeks either with a CD (tPAT-\nCD), an HCD (tPAT-HCD), or an HCD in combination with\nARB treatment (tPAT-HCD/ARB), and subsequently trans-\nplanted over the endogenous infrarenal abdominal periaor-\ntic adipose tissue of 20-week-old apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice fed an HCD\nfor 12 weeks. A periaortic fat pad from 16-week-old donor\nAgtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice, fed for eight weeks with a CD or\nHCD, was similarly transplanted into 20-week-old apoE\u00ad/\u00ad\nmice. Finally, the musculofascial and skin incisions were\nsutured. Sham surgeries of control animals were performed\nin the same manner, but without transplantation of tPAT.\nMice were anaesthetized before the implantation of osmotic\nminipumps. At 24 weeks of age, the area of the atheroscle-\nrotic lesion in the aorta was evaluated. Before harvesting\nthe tissues (aortas), mice were euthanized by trans-cardiac\nperfusion under terminal anesthesia induced by intraperito-\nneal administration of pentobarbital (200 mg/kg). All\nexperiments were performed by strictly adhering to\nthe Guidelines for Animal Experiments of the Kyoto\nPrefectural University of Medicine, following approval by\na local university ethics review board.\nHemodynamic analysis\nMean blood pressure and heart rates were measured\nunder conscious and unrestrained conditions using a\nprogrammable sphygmomanometer (BP-98A; Softron,\nTokyo, Japan).\nPlasma lipid analysis.Measurements of total cholesterol,\ntriglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol,\nand high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol were out-\nsourced to SRL, Tokyo, Japan.\nQuantitative measurement of atherosclerotic lesions. Mice were\neuthanized at the age of 24 weeks, and atherosclerotic lesions\nwere analyzed. Imaging and analysis of oil-red O-stained\naortas were accomplished using Scion Imaging Software.\nThe aortic lesion area in each animal was expressed as the\npercentage of lesion area per total aortic area.\nImmunohistochemistry.tPAT was quickly removed after\nphosphate-buffered saline (PBS) perfusion, embedded in\nparaffin, and immunofluorescently labeled using a combi-\nnation of anti-mouse Mac2 antibody (CEDARLANE, Burl-\nington, Ontario, Canada) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated\nsecondary antibodies (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).\nNuclei were labeled using diamidino-2-phenylindole\n(DAPI) solution (DOJINDO, Kumamoto, Japan), and the\nsections were examined using an LSM 510 METAconfocal\nmicroscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For a negative\ncontrol, non-immune immunoglobulin and Alexa Fluor\n488-conjugated secondary antibodies were used. The num-\nber of Mac2-positive cells was assessed using data col-\nlected from five sections and six animals in each group.\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nTotal RNA was extracted from adipose tissue and reverse\ntranscribed to prepare cDNA. Real-time PCR was per-\nformed on a Thermal Cycler Dice (Takara Bio, Shiga,\nJapan), using SYBR Premix Ex Taq 2 (Takara Bio, Shiga,\nJapan). Dissociation curves were examined for the aber-\nrant formation of primer dimers. PCR-amplified products\nwere electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels to confirm the\npresence of a single amplicom. Data were expressed as\ngene expression levels relative to that of control.\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay\nBlood from the right ventricular was collected in tubes con-\ntaining citrate at a final concentration of 0.01 M. Serum was\nstored -80\u00b0C. Adipose tissue was homogenized in 600 \u00b5l\nbuffer containing PBS and 0.04% Tween 80 using a rotary\nhomogenizer. Homogenized tissue samples were centrifuged\nlected. The amounts of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-),\ninterleukin-6 (IL-6) and adiponectin present in the serum\nwere estimated using commercial ELISA kits (MTA00B,\nThe levels of TNF-, IL-6 and adiponectin in the adipose\nR&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The assays were carried\nout according to the manufacturers'instructions.\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SE. Mean values\nwere compared using ANOVA. If a statistically significant\neffect was found, Scheffe's F test was performed to ana-\nlyze the differences between the groups. p < 0.05 was con-\nsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nPeriaortic adipose tissue-specific activation of\nthe RAS in HCD-fed apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice\nTo examine the effect of an HCD on phenotypic alterations\nof adipose tissue, 8-week-old apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice were fed either\na CD or HCD until they reached 12 weeks of age. The\nbody weight and body weight ratios of tPAT and epididy-\nmal WAT pads were not affected by HCD feeding (Figure\n1(a)). The histomorphological analysis of both adipose\npads revealed no discernible differences between the two\ngroups of mice (Figure 1(b)). We compared the expression\nof adipocyte differentiation-related genes, RAS compo-\nnents, monocyte/macrophage markers, and adipocy-\ntokines. An HCD significantly upregulated the expression\nof adipocyte differentiation-related genes, including those\nof peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPAR)\nand fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) both in tPAT and\nWAT (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). The expression levels of\nRAS components, including angiotensinogen (AGT),\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and AT1a\nreceptor\nR), were significantly higher in the tPAT of HCD-fed\nmice, while AGT expression level was significantly lower\nin the WAT of HCD-fed mice (Figures 2(c) and 2(d)).\nFurthermore, the levels of monocyte/macrophage markers,\nincluding CD68 and CD206, were significantly higher in\nthe tPAT of HCD-fed apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice, whereas no such differ-\nences were observed in the WAT (Figures 2(e) and 2(f)). In\nboth tPAT and WAT, the expression levels of the inflamma-\ntory adipokines, TNF-, IL-6, and monocyte chemoat-\ntractant protein 1 (MCP-1), were not altered by the HCD\n(Figures 2(g) and 2(h)). These findings suggested that\nHCD feeding led to the activation of adipose tissue RAS in\na tissue-specific manner, and that this was accompanied by\nincreased accumulation of monocytes/macrophages.\nHCD-induced phenotypic alterations are\nsignificantly suppressed by angiotensin II\nreceptor blockade or AT1\nreceptor deficiency\nWe next examined the involvement of the AT1\nreceptor\nin tPAT-specific HCD-induced phenotypic alterations.\n70 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(1)\nNeither ARB treatment nor AT1\ndeficiency (data not\nshown) affected pad weight. Four weeks of ARB treat-\nment along with HCD significantly suppressed the\nmRNA expression of AGT, ACE and PPAR (Figures\n3(a) and 3(c)). Additionally, treatment with ARB blocker\nled to a significant reduction in the gene expression lev-\nels of the monocyte/macrophage markers, including\nF4/80 (Figure 3(e)). Notably, the gene expression of the\nproinflammatory adipokines, TNF-, IL-6, and MCP-1,\nmarkedly diminished after ARB treatment (Figure 3(g)).\nThe HCD-induced phenotypic alterations observed in\napoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice were absent in Agtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice\n(Figures 3(b), 3(d), 3(f) and 3(h)). These findings sug-\ngested that the AT1\nreceptor plays a critical role in tPAT-\nspecific HCD-induced phenotypic alterations, and that\nblockade could be used as a potential strategy to\nsuppress inflammatory responses in the tPAT.\nIntra-abdominal transplantation of the tPAT from\nARB-treated apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice prevents atherosclerotic\ndevelopment throughout the aorta\nIntra-abdominal tPAT transplantation was performed to\nexamine whether tPAT-specific phenotypic alterations con-\ntributed toward the development of atherosclerosis. The\ntPAT was harvested from 16-week-old apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice fed a\nCD (tPAT-CD), an HCD (tPAT-HCD), or an HCD in combi-\nnation with ARB administration (tPAT-HCD/ARB), and\ntransplanted alongside the distal abdominal aorta of\n20-week-old apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice fed an HCD starting from 8\nweeks of age. The weights of transplanted tPAT were 11.3 \u00b1\ntPAT from HCD-fed and ARB-treated HCD-fed apoE\u00ad/\u00ad\nmice were significantly lower than CD-fed apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice (p\n< 0.05). Four weeks after transplantation, compared with\ntPAT-CD transplanted mice, the atherosclerotic lesion area\nof the entire aorta in tPAT-HCD transplanted mice showed a\nmodest, yet significant, increase (29%, p < 0.01) (Figures\n4(a) and 4(b)). The body weight and body weight ratios of\nepididymal WAT pads were also equivalent among the\ngroups after fat transplantation (Supplemental Figures 1(a)\nand 1(b)). The hemodynamic parameters and lipid profiles\ndid not differ between these two groups (Supplemental\nFigures 2(a) and 2(b)). In contrast, the areas of atheroscle-\nrotic lesions in tPAT-HCD/ARB transplanted mice were\nsham-operated control, tPAT-CD transplanted, and tPAT-\nHCD-transplanted mice, respectively (p < 0.01). These\nresults suggested that transplantation of tPAT-HCD/ARB not\nonly ameliorated the augmented atherosclerotic develop-\nment as observed in tPAT-HCD transplanted mice, but also\ncounteracted it when compared to no transplantation in the\nFigure 1.

To further elucidate the mechanisms of tPAT\ntransplantation-associated atherosclerosis development, we\nevaluated the atherosclerotic lesion area of the suprarenal\nand infrarenal aorta separately. The atherosclerotic lesion\narea of the infrarenal aorta differed only between tPAT-\nHCD- and tPAT-HCD/ARB-transplanted mice, suggesting\nthat the anti-atherogenic actions of tPAT-HCD/ARB-\ntransplanted mice are likely due to its paracrine effects on\nthe vasculature of the abdominal aorta (Figure 4(c)). The\natherosclerotic development of the suprarenal aorta fol-\nlowed similar trends as that in the entire aorta (Figure 4(d)),\nsupporting the notion that transplanted tPAT exerted both\nsystemic and local paracrine effects on atherogenesis.\nIntra-abdominal transplantation of the tPAT\nfrom HCD-fed Agtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/apoE-/- mice ameliorates\natherosclerosis development throughout the aorta\nTo investigate the effects of AT1\nreceptor deficiency on\ntPAT transplantation-associated atherosclerosis, the tPAT\nwas harvested from 16-week-old Agtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice fed\na CD (tPAT-CD/Agtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad) or HCD (tPAT-HCD/\nFigure 2.

These find-\nings suggested that marked reduction in serum proinflam-\nmatory adipokine levels and an associated increase in\nadiponectin concentration are likely responsible for the\nanti-atherogenic effects observed in tPAT-HCD/ARB-\ntransplanted mice.\nTransplanted tPAT from ARB-treated apoE\u00ad/\u00ad\nmice exerts anti-inflammatory effects in\nrecipient mice\nTo identify the primary tissue source of proinflammatory\ncytokines and adiponectin, we examined the transplanted\ntPAT grafts in recipient mice. tPAT grafts harvested from\ntPAT-CD and tPAT-HCD transplanted mice showed uni-\nlocular fat droplets similar to those of a WAT, whereas a\ntransplanted tPAT graft from tPAT-HCD/ARB showed\nmultilocular fat droplets characteristic of brown adipose\ntissue (Figure 7(a)). Immunohistochemical analysis\nrevealed that the number of Mac-2-positive cells was sig-\nnificantly lower in tPAT-HCD/ARB than in tPAT-HCD\n(Figures 7(b) and 7(c)). Consistent with the circulating\nlevels of proinflammatory cytokines, the mRNA expres-\nsion levels of TNF- and IL-6 were lower in tPAT-HCD/\nARB, whereas adiponectin mRNA expression was similar\nin all three groups (Figure 7(d)). The protein levels of\nTNF-, IL-6, and adiponectin were significantly lower in\ntPAT-HCD/ARB (Figure 7(e)). In contrast to the tPAT, the\nmorphological characteristics and mRNA expression lev-\nels of adipocytokines in the WAT of all three groups were\ncomparable (Supplemental Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). The\nprotein levels of adipocytokines did not differ between\ntPAT-HCD and tPAT-HCD/ARB (Supplemental Figure\n3(c)). These findings suggested that reduced expression of\nTNF- and IL-6 in transplanted tPAT, accompanied by a\nrelatively limited accumulation of macrophages, likely led\nto lower circulating levels of these pro-inflammatory\ncytokines and contributed to the prevention of atheroscle-\nrotic development in tPAT-HCD/ARB-transplanted mice.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we demonstrated that an HCD induced tPAT-\nspecific enhanced expression of RAS components and\nFigure 7. tPAT graft from ARB-treated apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice exhibits anti-inflammatory properties.

Further, intra-abdominal trans-\nplantation of the tPAT from HCD-fed apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice signifi-\ncantlyexaggeratedatheroscleroticdevelopmentthroughout\nthe aorta; atherosclerotic development was markedly sup-\npressed in mice transplanted with the tPAT from ARB-\ntreated HCD-fed apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice. We also determined that\ntransplantation of the tPAT from HCD-fed Agtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad\nmice suppressed atherosclerotic development to a greater\nextent than transplantation from CD-fed Agtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad\nmice. The tPAT grafts from ARB-treated apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice\nexpressed lower amounts of proinflammatory cytokines\nand had fewer monocytes/macrophages. This was associ-\nated with significantly lower circulating levels of TNF-\nand IL-6, and higher adiponectin levels. Our findings\nclearly suggest that AT1\nreceptor-mediated proinflamma-\ntory phenotypic alterations of the tPAT are involved in the\ndevelopment of atherosclerosis, and that modulation of\ntPAT phenotype may be a useful therapeutic strategy to\nprevent cardiovascular diseases.\nIt has been reported that the tPAT exhibits a brown adi-\npose tissue-like appearance and the expression profile of\nadipocyte-related genes.13,18 Recently, Chang et al. devel-\noped a smooth muscle cell-specific PPAR-deficient\nmouse model, in which absence of tPAT markedly reduced\nthe thermogenic capacity and energy expenditure of exces-\nsive nutrition.16 The authors demonstrated that atheroscle-\nrosis development was significantly exaggerated when the\nanimals were housed at 16\u00b0C, but not at 22\u00b0C, because of\nthe intravascular temperature-associated endothelial dys-\nfunction and impaired lipid clearance. They also showed\nthat mRNA expression levels of uncoupling protein 1\n(UCP-1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\ncoactivator (PGC-1) were significantly higher in tPAT\nfrom control mice housed at 16\u00b0C than at 22\u00b0C, suggesting\nthat cold-mediated activation of the tPAT exerted anti-ath-\nerogenic effects. Therefore, we examined the relationship\nbetween tPAT activation and atherogenesis. UCP-1 mRNA\nexpression was significantly higher in tPAT-HCD than in\ntPAT-CD, whereas such an increase was absent in tPAT-\nHCD/ARB (Supplemental Figure 4(a)). Similarly, PGC-\n1 mRNA expression was markedly lower in tPAT-HCD/\nARB than in the other groups (Supplemental Figure 4(b)).\nConsidering that mice were housed at 22\u00b0C throughout the\nstudy, tPAT activation was unlikely to be involved in the\ntPAT-associated development of atherosclerosis.\nIt has been established that the AT1\nreceptor exerts\nproatherogenic actions, and that pharmacological block-\nade or a deficiency of the AT1\nreceptor ameliorates athero-\nsclerotic development.19\u00ad21 Adipose tissue is a mixture of\nvarious cell types,22 and adipocytes as well as monocytes/\nmacrophages abundantly express RAS components.23\nPutnam et al. have recently generated adipocyte-specific\nreceptor-deficient mice that developed striking\nadipocyte hypertrophy when fed a low-fat diet.24 The\nauthors showed that incubation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with\nAng II increased oil red O staining and mRNA expression\nof PPAR, suggesting that AT1\nreceptors regulated adipo-\ncyte differentiation and morphology. Consistent with their\nresults, we observed that an HCD promoted the expression\nof PPAR as well as RAS components, and treatment with\nARB suppressed PPAR mRNA expression (Figures 2(a),\n2(c), and 3(a)). However, suppression of adipocyte differ-\nentiation by AT1\nblockade may increase lipid storage and\nhypertrophy of remaining adipocytes, and promote the\nsecretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines,\nleading to increased accumulation of inflammatory leuko-\ncytes in adipose tissue.25,26 Therefore, future studies using\nadipocyte-specific AT1\nreceptor-deficient atherosclerosis-\nprone mice are needed to elucidate the role of adipocyte\nin atherogenesis. In contrast, HCD feeding led to\nincreased monocytes/macrophages accumulation in the\ntPAT, which was blocked by ARB treatment (Figures 2(e)\nand 3(e), Supplemental Figures 5(a) and 5(b)). We have\npreviously reported that bone marrow AT1\nreceptors play a\ncrucial role in monocyte differentiation and/or prolifera-\ntion.27 Considering that monocytes/macrophages abun-\ndantly express all components of RAS23 and may serve as\na predominant source of pro-inflammatory cytokines/\nreceptors expressed\nin these cells likely play an important role in HDC-induced\nphenotypic alterations in the tPAT and atherosclerotic\ndevelopment.\nVisceral adipose tissue has been reported to release sev-\neral pro-inflammatory cytokines into circulation, causing\nsystemic inflammation and contributing to the develop-\nment of metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance.1\u00ad5\nClinical studies have shown that a circulating concentra-\ntion of pro-inflammatory cytokines is well correlated with\nthe incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular dis-\neases.28,29 Studies using animal models also demonstrate\nthe role of pro-inflammatory cytokines on atherosclerotic\ndevelopment.30\u00ad32 We examined whether tPAT-derived adi-\npocytokines modulated the development of atherosclerosis\nin recipient mice. Unexpectedly, there was no difference in\nthe circulating levels of TNF-, IL-6, and adiponectin\nbetween tPAT-CD- and tPAT-HCD-transplanted mice. The\nprecise mechanism responsible for the exaggerated athero-\nsclerosis observed in tPAT-HCD-transplanted mice is not\nclear. However, tPAT from ARB-treated mice exerted an\ninhibitory effect on atherosclerotic development. tPAT-\nHCD/ARB transplanted mice exhibited higher concentra-\ntions of circulating adiponectin and HDL cholesterol\n(Figure 6(c) and Supplemental Figure 2(b)). Pro-\ninflammatory cytokines have been reported to inhibit adi-\nponectin secretion.33,34 Our results suggested that\ntransplantation tPAT from tPAT-HCD/ARB exerted a ben-\neficial effect on lipid homeostasis by suppressing systemic\ninflammation.\nWe examined the circulating cytokine levels in the\nrecipient mice transplanted with AT1\n-deficient tPAT; how-\never, serum concentrations of TNF- and IL-6 did not dif-\nfer between tPAT-CD/Agtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad and tPAT-HCD/\nAgtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice (Supplemental Figures 6(a) and\n6(d)). Cytokine levels in transplanted tPAT graft also\nshowed no difference between the two groups\n(Supplemental Figures 6(b) and 6(e)). Considering the dis-\ncrepancy between the data from tPAT-HCD/ARB apoE\u00ad/\u00ad\nmice and tPAT-HCD/Agtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice, we cannot\ncompletely exclude the possibility that residual ARB\nwithin the transplanted tPAT could act as a source of ARBs\nin the recipient animal. Conversely, proinflammatory\ncytokine levels in epididymal WAT was markedly\ndecreased in tPAT-HCD/Agtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice compared\nwith tPAT-CD/Agtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice (Supplemental\nFigures 6(c) and 6(f)), suggesting that tPAT graft from\ntPAT-HCD/Agtr1\u00ad/\u00ad/apoE-- mice could exert an anti-\ninflammatory effect on endogenous adipose tissue.\nPotential mediators and underlying mechanisms responsi-\nble for these effects need to be investigated in a future\nstudy.\nIn this study, HCD-induced tPAT phenotypic alteration\nwas examined in apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice; however, HFD-induced\ntPAT modulation in wild-type mice was a quite important\nissue, especially in the setting of obesity. We also exam-\nined HFD (but not HCD)-induced phenotypic alteration of\ntPAT in wild-type mice and found that macrophage accu-\nmulation and gene expression of the RAS components\nwere exaggerated in tPAT of obese wild-type mice com-\npared with lean control mice (data not shown). Their rele-\nvance to atherosclerosis development needs to be examined\nin a future study using a tPAT transplant model.\nIn conclusion, our results showed that periaortic adi-\npose tissue-specific activation of RAS is involved in the\natherosclerotic development in HCD-fed apoE\u00ad/\u00ad mice,\nand that inhibition of this depot-specific activation of RAS\nexerts an anti-atherogenic effect by suppressing systemic\ninflammation. Our findings shed new light into the role of\ntPAT in atherogenesis, and suggest that perivascular adi-\npose tissue may be a useful new therapeutic target for the\nprevention of cardiovascular diseases.\nConflict of interest\nNone declared.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by a grant from the Ministry of\nEducation, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (C:\nReferences\n1.
