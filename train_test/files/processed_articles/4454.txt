Breast cancer patients may experience various symptoms that affect the quality of life significantly and they seek\ncomplementary and alternative medicine (CAM). To meet the needs of patients, we developed an integrative outpatient\ncare program. Methods. This program provided CAM consultation and acupuncture for breast cancer patients at Taipei\nVeterans General Hospital. The outcome measures included Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey\n(SF-12) and patient satisfaction questionnaires on the first visit (baseline) and at 6 months. Results. Forty-five breast cancer\npatients were enrolled. All patients completed the study. The median age was 53.3 (\u00b18.3).

Moreover,\nusing CAM to help breast cancer patients relieve their dis-\ncomforts such as insomnia, hot flushes, cancer-related fatigue,\nand other symptoms is winning greater acceptance.11,12\nAcupuncture, one of the major components of traditional\nChinese medicine (TCM), has now been widely accepted as\na part of CAM therapy.13 Unlike TCM in the Western society,\nwhich is defined as alternative medicine, TCM in Taiwan is a\ngovernment-recognized medical system parallel to modern\nmedicine with regulations and reimbursement by the National\nHealth System. There are 13 Chinese medicine hospitals and\ndemic hospitals have also established Chinese medicine\ndepartments. However, CAM and conventional medicine are\nusually provided by different specialists and have not been\nwell integrated in most institutions.\n1Cheng Hsin General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan\n2National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan\n3Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan\nCorresponding Author:\nEmail: fpchen@vghtpe.gov.tw\nBuilding an Integrative Outpatient\nCare Program for Breast Cancer\nPatients in Taiwan\nYi-Hsien Lin, MD, PhD1,2, Jing-Huei Shiu, MS2,\nFang-Pey Chen, MD2,3, and Jen-Hwey Chiu, MD, PhD1,2,3\n Keywords\nbreast cancer, integrative therapy, traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, quality of life, complementary medicine\nThere are 2 models by which integrative oncology may\nbe applied to cancer patients, namely, the expert-based\nmodel and the patient-centered model.15 In the expert-\nbased model, a patient seeks medical care first from the\noncologists and is then referred to CAM therapists or vice\nversa. In the patient-centered model, a patient chooses to\nvisit the oncologists/surgeons and CAM providers simul-\ntaneously. Most hospitals or medical centers, including\nthose in the Unites States and in Taiwan, adopt the first\nmodel for integrative medical therapy. However, the\npatient-centered model provides friendlier and less time-\nconsuming service for cancer patients. Thus, building a\none-step care model that provides CAM and mainstream\nmedicine in the same locale at the same time is essential\nfor establishing a patient-centered integrative therapy for\nbreast cancer patients.\nIn this article, we share our experience of developing an\nintegrative outpatient care program that provides consulta-\ntion with surgeons as well as Chinese medicine physicians.\nPatient satisfaction and quality of life were assessed.\nSubjects and Methods\nStudy Design\nThe integrative outpatient care program provides consulta-\ntion with a surgeon and a Chinese medicine physician\njointly regarding the use of CAM, TCM and drug-herb\ninteractions. (Figure 1) Patients may choose acupuncture\nfor the relief of their symptoms. A questionnaire regarding\ntheir symptoms, use of CAM, and satisfaction was com-\npleted by the patients on the first visit and at 6 months.\nOutcome measures included Medical Outcomes Study\n12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) and patient sat-\nisfaction questionnaire, which were completed by the\npatients on the first visit and at 6 months.\nParticipants\ninstitutional review board of Taipei Veterans General\nHospital. Recruitment took place between September 2010\nand March 2011. Inclusion criteria were as follows: patients\nwho were diagnosed with breast cancer, aged 25 to 80 years\nold, and had visited our hospital for integrative outpatient\ncare program. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, pace-\nmaker implantation, history of acute myocardial infarction,\nnon\u00adbreast cancer patients, depression, and patients taking\nChinese herbal medicine. Voluntary informed consents in\nwritten form were obtained from all patients before enroll-\nment. There were 98 breast cancer patients who visited our\nprogram, of whom 45 were enrolled.\nInterventions\nBreast cancer patient who visited the integrative outpatient\ncare program were interviewed by a surgeon and given edu-\ncation materials on complementary/alternative medicine and\ndrug-herb interactions. Patients who were suffering from side\neffects after surgery and adjuvant treatment had the option of\nchoosing acupuncture. This includes auricle acupuncture,\nneedle acupuncture and electrostimulation performed by a\ncertified Chinese Medicine physician. Acupoints were\nselected according to the symptoms and the theory of Chinese\nmedicine. Patients with different symptoms were prescribed\ndifferent acupoints. For instance, the principle for selecting\nacupoints was as follows: face: S7; shoulder: GB 21, LI 15,\nwas applied as either electro-acupuncture (EA), transcutane-\nous nerve stimulation (TENS) or Silver Spike Point (SSP)\ntherapy. SSP as needle-free EAand has been shown to have a\nsimilar analgesic effect to standard EA. Dense-Disperse fre-\nquencies (2 and 100 Hz, alternatively) and waves in Silver\nSpike Point (SSP) were applied to patients to prevent adap-\ntion of nerves. A course was defined as six acupuncture ses-\nsions and patients had acupuncture 2 to 3 times per week.\nOutcome Measures\nOutcome measures for quality of life included SF-12 and\npatient satisfaction questionnaire obtained on the first visit\nStatistics\nThe data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows Version\n17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). The distribution and\nfrequency of each category of variables were examined by\nchi-square tests. A P value of less than .05 was considered\nstatistically significant.\nFigure 1.

All patients completed this program. The\npatients' characteristics.\nSymptoms Presented at First Visit\nThe patients had filled out a questionnaire regarding their\nsymptoms, use of CAM, improvement, and satisfaction.\nThe symptoms most often experienced during previous can-\ncer treatments were fatigue (35.6%), arthralgia (20%), nau-\nsea (6.7%), and insomnia (6.7%). The symptoms most\nwished to be diminished by the patients were arthralgia\nfour patients (75.6%) had previously sought CAM therapy\nto reduce these symptoms. The prior use of CAM was pre-\nsented in Table 2. The most often used CAM methods were\nsage and aromatherapy (11.1%), acupuncture (8.9%), and\nenergy healing (8.9%). Most health food was provided by\nhealth food took it 4 times per month (data not shown). The\nprimary aims for using CAM were to improve immunity\nAcupuncture\nThe reasons for attending the program were to treat insom-\nThe patients were given treatments according to their needs,\nincluding consultation, ear magnetic acupuncture, ear acu-\npuncture, manual acupuncture, electroacupuncture, and\nSSP. Fifteen patients (33.3%) received CAM consultation\nonly while 30 (66.7%) received acupuncture in addition to\nconsultation. Of the 30 who received acupuncture, 16\npatients completed at least 6 sessions of acupuncture.\nFourteen patients did not complete the course of acupunc-\nture for the following reasons: adverse effects (14.3%), no\nimprovement (7.1%), change to Chinese herbal medicine\n(7.1%), not willing to continue acupuncture (50.0%), and\ndistant metastasis (7.1%). No serious adverse side effect\nwas reported.\nSatisfaction\nAs to the overall satisfaction with the integrative care pro-\nwith the program on the first visit and at 6 months. Thirty-\nnine patients (86.7%) were willing to continue the integra-\ntive care on the first visit and at 6 months. If new symptoms\nwere present, 40 patients (88.9%) were willing to receive\nfurther treatment in the integrative care program on the first\nvisit and at 6 months. Forty (88.9%) patients would recom-\nmend their family and other patients to the program at the\nfirst visit while 39 (86.7%) would recommend family and\nother patients at 6 months.\nSF-12 Questionnaire Measurement\nIn the SF-12 Questionnaire measurement on all the patients,\nphysical component summary (PCS) was 49.6 (\u00b15.6) at\ncomponent summary (MCS) was 44.7 (\u00b16.1) at baseline\ncompleted acupuncture, PCS was 49.2 (\u00b14.9) at baseline\n(Table 3).\nDiscussion\nIn Western society, 5 to 7 steps are required for patients to\nreceive CAM therapy under the guidance of their attending\nphysicians. To our knowledge, this is the first one-step patient-\ncentered integrative care program involving surgeons and\nTCM physicians for breast cancer patients in Taiwan. The\npatients can consult with surgeons and receive treatment by\nTCM physicians simultaneously in the same institution. The\njoint consultation between surgeon and TCM physician has 2\nTable 1. Patient Demographics (n = 45).\nCharacteristic n %\nStage\nTherapya\nDrugs for hormonal therapy\naThe patients may receive multiple therapies, so the total percentage\nadvantages. The first is that it addresses the issue of the sur-\ngeon's objection to the use of CAM. Second, it enables TCM\nphysicians to better understand the patient's history and to\ncooperate with surgeons in conventional cancer treatment.\nIt is noteworthy that the pattern of integrative cancer\ntherapy in Western society is quite different from those in\nChina and in Taiwan. In Western society, most CAM thera-\npies are paid for out of pocket17 while in China, TCM,\nwhich accounts for 90% of CAM, is covered by govern-\nment insurance.18 Owing to the insurance coverage of dual\nmedical systems, namely, modern medicine and TCM, the\nlatter is not defined as CAM therapy in Taiwan. The most\nstriking difference is the concern of drug-herb interaction.\nIn Western society, more than 50% to 60% of CAM use is\nprayer or mindfulness meditation and about 10% use herbal\nproducts--suggesting the consideration of nonpharmaco-\nlogical approach to integrative oncology.3,19 In contrast,\nmore than 50% to 70% of patients in China and one-third in\nTaiwan received co-prescriptions of Chinese herbs to treat\ntheir breast cancer, with no awareness of potential herb-\ndrug interaction.9,10 There is evidence that many Chinese\nherbal extracts might upregulate ER and HER2 gene\nexpression in vitro20,21 and interact with tamoxifen in vivo.22\nThis program did not include herbal medicine because\nprevious studies indicated that there may be drug-herb\ninteraction between herbal medicine and conventional ther-\napy whereas there is none between acupuncture and con-\nventional therapy. As the program went on, colleagues in\nthe hospital gradually accepted the integrative medicine and\nbegan to refer their patients to the program. Consequently, a\nnew integrative care program that provides traditional\nChinese herbal medicine is in progress and will enroll more\npatients.\nThe findings in our survey showed that most breast can-\ncer patients experienced various symptoms caused by can-\ncer or by cancer treatment. For most patients, the duration\nbetween the completion of adjuvant chemo/radiation and\ntheir joining this program is no more than three months.\nThere were only a few patients who were still undergoing\nadjuvant chemo/radiation when entering the program. Most\nof these patients have tried CAM to resolve these problems,\nwhich is consistent with existing studies. To help these\npatients, the program provides acupuncture in addition to\nconsultation. It is surprising that only 30 patients (66.7%)\nout of 45 chose acupuncture; yet only 16 received up to 6\nsessions of acupuncture. More than half of the patients did\nnot complete the whole course of acupuncture and none\ndropped out due to severe side effects. In the study by Frisk\nTable 2.

SF-12 Questionnaire Measurement at Baseline and 6 Months Afterward.\nAll patients (n = 45) \nPatients receiving acupuncture (n = 16) \nAbbreviations: SF-12, 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey; PCS, physical component summary of SF-12; MCS, mental component summary of SF-12.\n(73.1%) patients completed 12 weeks electro-acpuncture to\nimprove health-related quality of life and sleep.23 In the\nstudy by Hervik et al,24 59 women suffering from hot flashes\nfollowing breast cancer surgery and adjuvant treatment\n(tamoxifen) were randomized to either 10 weeks of tradi-\ntional Chinese acupuncture or sham acupuncture. All\npatients completed the study. In the study of Liljegren\net al,25 84 patients were randomized to receive either true\nacupuncture or control acupuncture twice a week for 5\nweeks. Seventy-four (88.1%) patients were treated accord-\ning to the protocol. When compared with other studies, the\ndropout rate for acupuncture is high in our study. This\nimplies that conventional medicine is still the major medi-\ncal option for these patients. The patients did not seem to\nlike acupuncture as expected although acupuncture has\nbeen practiced in Chinese society for thousands of years.\nPrevious studies show that the prevalence of acupuncture in\npatients who went through the whole course and some of\nthem even continued to receive acupuncture up to 6 months.\nThis suggests that some patients may have benefited from\nacupuncture.\nMost patients were satisfied with the program. SF-12\nshowed improvement significantly at the end of study. Most\npatients joined this program after they completed conven-\ntional cancer treatment, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and\nradiotherapy. There were various symptoms affecting their\nSF-12 scores. The improvement of SF-12 might be the\nresult of this program. The SF-12 score of the group that\ncompleted acupuncture did not show statistical signifi-\ncance. This may be due to small sample size. However, we\nobserved a trend of improvement of MCS, although it was\nnot statistically significant. There are 2 limitations to the\nacupuncture study. First, improvement in symptoms on the\nSF-12 scores might be due to the natural progression of\nrecovery after aggressive treatment. Second, the sample\nsize is small. Patients with different symptoms were pre-\nscribed with different acupoints. The number of patients\nwith the same symptom is too small to show differences.\nPrevious studies show that acupuncture is effective in\nrelieving nausea/vomiting, hot flush, and pain.13,23-25 In the\nfuture, further large scale studies with comparisons to a\ncontrol group is warranted.\nBreast cancer patients who visited the integrative outpa-\ntient care program were interviewed by a surgeon and\ngiven education materials on complementary/alternative\nmedicine and drug-herb interactions. However, the out-\ncome of the patient education was not collected. According\nto our understanding, the patients will not use the specific\nherbs that might interact with the drugs mentioned in our\neducation materials. For instance, herceptin may interact\nwith Radix Angelicae Sinensis, Rhizoma Chuanxiong,\nRadix Rehmanniae Glutinosae Conquitae, Radix Paeoniae\nLactiflorae. Chemotherapy may interact with some food\nsupplements and herbs. Radiation may interact with anti-\noxidants and herbs.\nAny specialist could be the physician for the clinic.\nHowever, surgeons are the primary caregivers and play a\nkey role in adjuvant treatments for breast cancer patients in\nTaiwan. A surgeon in the clinic would therefore be invalu-\nable to this program to win the trust and acceptance of other\nsurgeons. This will reduce politics in the hospital and\nincrease patient referrals. As the program progressed, sev-\neral surgeons and other specialists became interested.\nAlthough Chinese medicine is the traditional medicine\nin Taiwan, the conventional (Western) medicine has been\nthe mainstream in the medical system for several decades.\nMost medical centers have set up divisions of TCM.\nHowever, Chinese and Western medicines have not been\nintegrated in most hospitals. This is because of the medical\neducation system, regulations, and health insurance cover-\nage. This program is an innovative project designed to pro-\nvide a patient-centered service and to improve cooperation\nand mutual understanding of Chinese and Western medi-\ncines. Most patients were satisfied with this integrative care\nprogram and showed improvement in their quality of life.\nOur results showed that this program is feasible. Cancer\npatients often suffer from various problems that cannot be\nrelieved by conventional medicine. However, we should\nconduct more research to clarify issues such as the indica-\ntions and benefits of acupuncture, herb use, members of the\nclinics, and the outcome of patient education. CAM is\nincreasingly becoming more relevant by relieving some\nsymptoms and improving quality of life. It is important to\nconduct more research to build a model that integrates\nCAM with conventional medicine in Taiwan.\n"
