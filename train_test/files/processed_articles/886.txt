However, self-reported weights were signi\u00aecantly lower than measured weights among girls,\ncompared to boys (P ` 0.001). Correlation between self-reported height and actual height ranged from 0.82 \u00b1 0.91.\nThere were no differences in the accuracy of self-reported heights among boys and girls or racial groups. Differences\nbetween actual weight and self-reported weight were signi\u00aecantly greater for obese children compared with non-\nobese children (P ` 0.001). Nevertheless, the use of self-reported weight and height resulted in the correct classi\u00aeca-\ntion of weight status in 94% of children. As a result, small differences in self-reported weights and heights had no\nimpact in assessing obesity related morbidities.\nCONCLUSION: In\u00afuences of gender and racial biases in reporting of weight and height were relatively small. Self-\nreported heights and weights were extremely reliable for the predicting obesity related morbidities and behaviours.\nKeywords: body weight; body mass index; obese; adolescents\nIntroduction\nIn national surveys of youth behaviour, self-reported\nweights and heights are often utilized in place of\nactual measurement. In the United States, the Youth\nRisk and Behavior Surveillance Study (YRBSS),1 the\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health,2\nand the National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS)3\nrely on self-reported weight and height in order to\nassess the impact of body weight on adolescent self-\nesteem, dieting, and overall health.\nIn adults, the correlation between actual and\nreported heights and weights typically range between\ntions between actual and reported heights and weights\nyoung adolescents from a well-educated, high-income\ncommunity.6 However, self-reports may re\u00afect cul-\ntural biases resulting in differing accuracies among\nsexes and races. The correlation between actual and\nreported heights and weights in a cross-sectional\nnational survey of children has not been studied.\nIn order to clarify the accuracy of self-reported\nweight and height, data were analyzed from the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(cycle III), a nationally representative sample of\nwere also analyzed to determine whether self-reported\nweight and height resulted in differences between\npredicted risk of obesity related morbidities compared\nto actual weight and height.\nMethods\nThe National Health and Nutritional Examination\nSurvey, Cycle III (NHANES III) is the seventh in a\nseries of large national health examination surveys\nconducted in the United States since the 1960s.\nNHANES III examined a nationally representative\nsample of children and adults between 1988 and\nwere studied. Measured weights and heights were\navailable on over 99% of the children; self-reported\nweights and heights were available on 1657 children\nBody weight was determined to the nearest 0.05 kg\n(Toledo 2181 Scale) and height was measured to the\nnearest 0.1 cm using standardized measuring equip-\nment (Holtain Height Stadiometer).

Tanner pubertal staging was per-\nformed by trained study staff.\nNormal weight was de\u00aened as a body mass index\n(kgam2) less than the 85th percentile for age and\ngender; overweight was de\u00aened as a body mass\nindex (kgam2) greater than the 85th percentile for\nage and gender, and obesity was de\u00aened as a body\nmass index (kgam2) greater than the 95th percentile\nfor age and gender. Reference body mass index\npercentiles were derived from the \u00aerst National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey.7 This de\u00ae-\nnition is in accordance with recommendations of the\nExpert Committee on Clinical Guidelines for Over-\nweight in Adolescence.8\nAll children underwent a standardized interview\nwith trained staff. Children were asked the following\nquestions concerning weight, height, self-perceived\nweight, and weight control practices:\n\u00d0 How tall are you without shoes?\n\u00d0 How much do you weigh without clothes or\nshoes?\n\u00d0 How many hours of television did you watch\nyesterday?\n\u00d0 How many times each week do you exercise\nenough to make yourself sweat?\n\u00d0 Have you dieted during the past year?\n\u00d0 How often do you eat breakfast?\nBecause the NHANES III study over-sampled blacks,\nyounger children, and the elderly, the data was\nweighted so that all statistics re\u00afected a national\nrepresentative sample of children aged 12 \u00b1 16 years\nold. Differences in continuous variables were assessed\nusing the independent t-test. Differences in propor-\ntions were assessed using chi-square. Correlation\ncoef\u00aecients were calculated using linear regression.\nOdds ratios were calculated using logistic regression.\nIn order to adjust for complex sample design and\nclustering effects in the NHANES III sample, statis-\ntical signi\u00aecance was assessed using the balance\nrepeated replication method using the software pack-\nage WesVarPC (Westat Inc., Rockville, MD) as\nrecommended.9\nResults\n936 of the children enrolled were white/Hispanic\nother (5%) (Table 1). Approximately 16% of young\nadolescents were overweight (85th percentile ` BMI\npercentile). In addition, there were no signi\u00aecant\ndifferences in age distribution between normal\nweight (BMI ` 85th percentile), overweight and\nobese children. There was a small, but signi\u00aecantly\nincreased prevalence of obesity among blacks com-\ndifference in the prevalence of overweight among\nSelf-reported weight in young adolescents was\nwithin 2 kg of actual weight in 59% of children and\nwithin 5 kg of actual weight in 88%. Self-reported\nheight was within 2 cm of actual height in 57% of\nchildren and within 4 cm of actual height in 81%. 95%\nof adolescents reported a weight within 10 kg of actual\nweight, and over 95% of adolescents reported a height\nwithin 8 cm of actual height.\nOn average, reported weight was approximately\nand reported height was one cm lower than actual\nheight ( 7 1.0\u00c6 5.1 cms). Females were more likely\nto under-report their weight than males (1.0\u00c6 5.5 kgs\nence in the degree of under-reporting in females of\ndifferent races (P  0.4) or males of different races\n(P  0.8). There was also no signi\u00aecant difference\nbetween under-reporting of height among males and\ngroups (P  0.2) or pubertal stage (P  0.5). A small\nproportion of adolescents reported completely erro-\nneous weights and heights: Approximately 1% of\nadolescents reported a weight over 22 kg different\nfrom their actual weight, and 1% of adolescents\nreported a height over 20 cm different than their\nactual height.\nCorrelation between self-reported weight and actual\ngender or race (Table 2).

In addition,\nthere was no difference in age between those children\nwho under-reported or over-reported their weight by\nmore than 5 kg Table 3.\nSince obese children weighed on average 33 kg\nmore than non-obese children (88\u00c6 23 kgs vs\nweight and height had little impact on classifying\nwhether an individual was obese (BMI b 95th%) or\nnon-obese.

Similar results were demonstrated\nin both males and females (P  0.5) and among all\nraces (P  0.1). Consequently, odds ratios for obesity\nrelated behaviours were similar whether obesity\n(BMI b 95th percentile) was calculated using actual\nweight and height or self-reported weight and height\n(Figure 2).\nDiscussion\nCorrelations of self-reported and actual weights and\nheights in young adolescents ranged from approxi-\nactual weights and heights and measured weights\nand heights are lower in adolescents than those\nreported in adults,3 \u00b1 5 they remain extremely reliable\nFigure 1 Actual weight compared to self-reported weight in the sample of young adolescents (1A).

Since obese adolescents weighed approxi-\nmately 33 kg more than the non-obese adolescents,\neven moderate errors in self-reported height and\nweight had minimal in\u00afuence on misclassi\u00aecation of\nobesity status. As a result, the odds ratios for weight\nrelated behaviours (ie, dieting, television watching,\nexercise, etc) were virtually identical whether weight\nstatus was calculated using self-reported or actual\nweights and heights.\nSince self-reported weights and heights are easily\nobtained, they are appropriate to utilize in surveys in\norder to provide a reliable assessment of obesity\nrelated behaviours. However, self-reported heights\nand weights are not reliable for tracking weight\nchanges in longitudinal surveys where more precise\nmeasurements are necessary. In addition, self-reported\nheights and weights are not recommended for use in\nstudies of obesity related morbidities such as hyper-\ntension or hypercholesterolaemia where it is clearly\nmore appropriate to measure anthropometrics directly.\nFinally, self-reported heights and weights are not\nrecommended for identifying an individual as `over-\nweight' since a fairly narrow height and weight range\nis required for accurate classi\u00aecation (85th percenti-\nle ` BMI ` 95th percentile).\nThese data support the work of Epstein and collea-\ngues who have also demonstrated that in children the\nuse of self-reported heights and weights results in the\ncorrect classi\u00aecation of obesity in 91% of children\naged 6 \u00b1 12 y.10 Because children tend to under-report\nboth height and weight, calculations of body mass\nindex are less inaccurate than those obtained from\nlarge studies in adults, where self-reported height is\nover-estimated and self-reported weight is under-esti-\nmated. As a result, Kuskowska-Wolk et al have\ndemonstrated that over 30% of adults who were\noverweight by measured weight and height would be\nmisclassi\u00aeed by self-reported weight and height11\ncompared to the 6% misclassi\u00aecation observed in\nthis study.\nAlthough the correlations between self-reported\nweight and measured weight were high, there existed\nsigni\u00aecant gender and racial differences in reporting.\nIn particular, females are likely to under-report their\nweight to a greater extent than males. Similar results\nhave been previously described in both children and\nadults. Dwyer et al showed that teenage boys report\ntheir weight more accurately than teenage girls.12\nDiscrepancies in self-reported weight and actual\nweight were highest in heavy girls, similar to what\nwas observed in the current study.13 In adults,\nwomen's self-reported weights are found to be con-\nsistently lower than their actual weights across the\nweight spectrum; in contrast, only overweight men\ntend to under-estimate their actual weight.14 \u00b1 16\nGender differences in self-reported weight and\nweight status may indicate a general desire to weigh\nhave also reported that pre-teen and adolescent girls\nwere almost twice as likely as similarly aged boys to\nreport a desire to be thinner.\nThere were no signi\u00aecant differences in self-reported\nheightandweightbetweenblacksandwhites,althougha\nsmall difference in correlation between actual and\ncalculated BMI occurred between whites and blacks.\nThis is particularly surprising since signi\u00aecant racial\ndifferences exist in perception of weight status (for\nexample, `are you overweight?') between blacks and\nwhites. Neff and colleagues reported that white adoles-\ncent girls were almost twice as likely to perceive\nthemselves as overweight compared to black adolescent\ngirls.19 Racial differences in weight status perception\nhave also been reported in the Youth Risk and Behavior\nHealth Interview Survey (NHIS),3 and the Kids'\nEating Disorders Survey (KEDS).20\nIn conclusion, the in\u00afuences of gender and racial\nbiases in reporting of weight and height were rela-\ntively small. Biases in reporting weight and height\nwere much larger in obese individuals than non-obese\nindividuals, but remained inconsequential in a rela-\ntionship with obesity related behaviours. Small differ-\nences in self-reported weight in females may be\nrelated to a general desire to be thinner. However,\nracial differences between self-reported weight and\nactual weight were not observed despite previous\nevidence that whites are more likely to perceive\nthemselves as overweight.\nReferences\n1 Serdula MK, Collins E, Williamson DF, Anda RF, Pamuk E,\nByers BE.
