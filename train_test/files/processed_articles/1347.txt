Giles\n Key words: nutrition surveys, sex, trends\nIntroduction\nThe epidemic of obesity, defined using BMI, that has\nswept through the U.S. during the past 2 decades has been\nwell documented (1,2). BMI provides a measure of overall\nadiposity, but the distribution of adipose tissue in predicting\nhealth risks associated with obesity is also important. Ab-\ndominal fat deposition is generally considered to be a key\ncomponent of obesity (3). Waist circumference is a conve-\nnient way of measuring abdominal fat deposition and may\nbe an equally or more useful measure of obesity than BMI\nis for several reasons. First, waist circumference is associ-\nated as strongly or more strongly with risk factors for\ncardiovascular disease (4\u00ad7) and is as good or better pre-\ndictor of future risk of the metabolic syndrome, type 2\ndiabetes, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality (8\u00ad\n11). Second, waist circumference provides information\nabout health risks--such as diabetes, hypertension, and\ndyslipidemias--in addition to BMI (12). Third, waist cir-\ncumference may be a better predictor of medical care costs\nthan BMI (13). Fourth, waist circumference is conceptually\neasy to measure, although it does require some training and\nstandardization (14). Fifth, the public may understand waist\ncircumference more easily than BMI. Finally, measure-\nments of waist circumference are needed to diagnose the\nmetabolic syndrome (15). Recognizing the importance of\nwaist circumference, the NIH recommended in 1998 that\nwaist circumference be measured, especially in people\nWaist circumference data for National Health and Nutri-\ntion Examination Survey (NHANES)1 III have been de-\nscribed for participants 17 years old (17). In this analysis,\nwe provide additional detail about the distribution of waist\ncircumference in NHANES III and examine changes in\nDivision of Adult and Community Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention\nand Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.\nAddress correspondence to Earl Ford, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4770\nE-mail: EFord@cdc.gov\n1 Nonstandard abbreviations: NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\nResearch Methods and Procedures\nWe used data from two cross-sectional surveys of the\nU.S. population in this analysis.\n(18,19). Participants were selected using a multistage, strat-\nified sampling design and are considered representative of\nthe civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. Persons\n60 years old, African Americans, and Mexican Americans\nwere over-sampled. After an interview in the home, partic-\nipants were invited to attend one of three examination\nsessions in the mobile examination center: morning, after-\nnoon, or evening. Body measurements were performed us-\ning standardized methods and equipment. The waist circum-\nference was measured with a steel measuring tape to the\nnearest 0.1 cm at the high point of the iliac crest at minimal\nrespiration (19). BMI was calculated from measured weight\nand height. Weight was measured on a Toledo self-zeroing\nweight scale. Participants wore underwear, disposable paper\ngowns, paper pants, and foam rubber slippers. Height was\nmeasured with a stadiometer to the nearest millimeter.\nIn 1999, NHANES became a continuously operating sur-\nrepresentative sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized\nU.S. population was selected using a stratified multistage\nsampling design. Persons with low income, persons 60\nyears old, African Americans, and Mexican Americans were\nover-sampled. Using a computer-assisted personal interview\nsystem, trained interviewers talked with participants at home.\nParticipants were asked to attend the mobile examination cen-\nter, where they completed additional questionnaires, under-\nwent various examinations, and provided a blood sample.\nUsing standardized methods and equipment, body measure-\nments were performed similarly to those in NHANES III (21).\nTable 1.

Differences in estimates\nbetween the two surveys were tested by dividing the differ-\nence in the means or proportions by the pooled SE of the\ntwo estimates, which was calculated as the square root of\nthe sum of the squares of the two SEs. Analyses were done\nby using Software for the Statistical Analysis of Correlated\nData to obtain proper variance estimates for the complex\nsampling design (22). Sampling weights were used to cor-\nrect for the over-sampling in the surveys. Pearson correla-\ntion coefficients between waist circumference and BMI\nwere calculated by using SAS software (SAS Institute,\nCary, NC) and the examination sampling weight.\nResults\nAmong participants who attended the mobile examina-\ncircumference measurement. The waist circumference per-\ncentiles for both surveys are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The\npercentiles suggest that much of the waist circumference\ndistribution has shifted.\nBetween the two surveys, the age-adjusted mean waist\ncircumference increased by 3.0 cm among men and 3.2 cm\namong women (Table 3). Among men, an increase occurred\namong all demographic subgroups but was of borderline\nsignificance among men 30 to 59 years old. The greatest\nTable 2.

Among\nwomen, an increase occurred among all demographic\ngroups but was not significant among women 40 to 59 or\n70 years old, Mexican-American women, or women of\nother race or ethnicity.

Among both men and women, the greatest\nincreases in waist circumference occurred among those 20\nAmong all participants, significant increases in mean\nwaist circumference and percentage high-risk waist cir-\ncumference occurred among all educational groups and\nTable 3.

Among male participants who\nwere current smokers, neither the increase in mean waist\ncircumference nor the increase in the percentage with a\nhigh-risk waist circumference was statistically signifi-\ncant. The increase in mean waist circumference among\nwomen with 12 years of education and the increase in\nthe percentage of women with 12 years of education who\nhad a high-risk waist circumference were not significant.\nPearson correlation coefficients between waist circumfer-\nence and BMI were high in both surveys, and the magnitude\nof the correlation coefficients increased slightly between the\ntwo surveys (Table 6).

Only among obese participants was the increase\nin the prevalence of high-risk waist circumference significant.\nHowever, the median BMI for the three categories of BMI\nincreased over time, complicating the interpretation of the data.\nDiscussion\nWe have described the distribution of waist circumfer-\nence among U.S. adults in two national surveys and the\n2000. As the epidemic of obesity increases unabatedly,\nnot surprisingly, a corresponding increase in the nation's\nwaistline is occurring. For men, the largest mean waist\ncircumference was among whites; for women, it was\namong African Americans in both surveys. The unad-\njusted mean waist circumference increased by 3.3 cm in\nmen and 3.5 cm in women. Among the three major racial\nor ethnic groups, the largest increase occurred among\nwhite men and African-American women. In addition,\nthe percentiles from both surveys suggest that much of\nthe waist circumference distribution shifted, especially\namong women. Using age-specific rates of high-risk\nwaist circumference and the year 2000 U.S. population,\nwe estimate that 35 million men and 58 million women\nhad a large waist.\nTable 5.

This finding is consistent with data from the\nBehavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which showed\nprevalence of obesity was among people 18 to 29 years old\n(23). These trends are worrisome because they bode ill for\nthe future health of young adults. For example, because of\nthe epidemic of obesity among youth, the prevalence of type\n2 diabetes has reached historic dimensions (24). Data from\nthe Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System showed\nthat people 30 to 39 years old experienced the largest\nincrease in the prevalence of diabetes (25). The large in-\ncreases in obesity among young adults suggest that they\nshould receive high priority for intervention efforts to re-\nduce obesity.\nOn the basis of a study of Dutch participants, Han et al.\nand Lean et al. suggested that waist measurements of 94 cm\nin men and 80 cm in women corresponded to a BMI of 25\nkg/m2 (26,27). The authors termed these cut-points \"action\nlevel 1.\" By examining the relation between waist circum-\nference and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, these\nauthors also established an \"action level 2\" (waist circum-\nrecommended that people in this category seek medical\nattention and attempt weight loss.

The rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity among\nU.S. adults portends ominously for the future health of the\nnation. To slow the rate of increase in obesity, let alone\nreverse it, will require the concerted efforts of many health\ncare professionals and public health professionals. How\ncommonly waist circumference is measured by clinicians is\nunclear. Anecdotal evidence suggests that it is not practiced\nroutinely. However, more studies are demonstrating the\nvalue of measuring waist circumference. Although measur-\ning waist circumference correctly requires some practice,\nwe urge health care professionals to incorporate waist cir-\ncumference along with measuring weight and height in their\nroutine practice.\n"
