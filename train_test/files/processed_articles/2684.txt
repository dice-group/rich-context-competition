Few nationwide epidemiological studies include a large enough sample of older adults to provide estimates of\nchronic conditions in the older adult population. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of eight common chronic\nhealth conditions and examine socioeconomic inequalities in the diseases among older adults in China.\nMethod: Data are from SAGE-China Wave 1, including 13,157 people aged 50-plus years. Respondents were asked if they\nhad been diagnosed with any of the following chronic medical conditions: angina, arthritis, asthma, stroke, diabetes,\ndepression, chronic lung disease and hypertension. A set of validated symptom-based questions and related diagnostic\nalgorithms were also used to estimate disease prevalence for angina, arthritis, asthma and depression. Multivariate logistic\nregression was performed to examine the probability of developing chronic conditions in relation to sociodemographic\nvariables such as gender, age, urban/rural setting and household wealth level.\nResults: Fifty percent of respondents reported having one of the selected chronic conditions, 18.9% two conditions, 5.8%\nthree conditions, and 1.4% reported having four or more chronic conditions. Self-reported prevalence was generated for\nangina (8%), arthritis (22%), asthma (2%), stroke (3%), diabetes (7%), depression (0.3%), chronic lung disease (8%) and\nhypertension (27%). The symptom-based prevalence of angina, arthritis, asthma and depression was 10%, 20%, 4% and 2%,\nrespectively.\nConclusion: This study provides the best available prevalence estimates for major chronic health conditions among older\nChinese adults. Findings from this study indicated that major chronic conditions were common, so prevention and early\nintervention targeting adults aged 50 years and older should be prioritized.\nCitation: Wu F, Guo Y, Kowal P, Jiang Y, Yu M, et al.

According to\ndemographic forecasts, this proportion is expected to rise to 30\npercent by 2030. The absolute numbers are estimated to increase\nage, the risk of chronic conditions increases, such as diabetes, heart\ndisease, cancer and arthritis, with china's ageing estimated to\nincrease NCD burden by 40% by 2030. Chronic diseases are now\namong the most common and costly health problems worldwide\nincluding China [2], especially among the older population. An\nestimated 66% of the total Chinese health burden is expected to be\nin older Chinese adults by 2030 [3]. Given the high rates of\nmodifiable risk factors contributing to the increasing prevalence of\nchronic disease, more current and detailed information on the\nepidemiology of chronic conditions, especially among the rapidly\ngrowing population of older adults, is urgently needed to\nanticipate any major challenges for the health care system.\nCompared with higher income countries, few nationally\nrepresentative epidemiological studies with a large sample of older\nadults are available in lower income countries, in particular, the\nprevalence of chronic conditions in China. Although several\nprevious large-scale nationally representative studies have reported\nthe prevalence of some chronic conditions, such as CNNHS\n(China National Nutrition and Health Survey) and Chronic\nDisease Risk Factor Surveillance in China [4,5], these studies are\nnot designed specifically for older adults and lack comparability\ndue to differences in the socioeconomic indicators, age groups and\nthe definition of diseases.\nThe Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) China\nWave 1 is a cross-sectional population-based study designed to\nprovide high quality health and well-being data among the older\nadult population in China. To our knowledge, this was the first\nnationwide population-based older adults' health and well-being\nsurvey in China. This study uses SAGE-China Wave 1 data to\nestimate the prevalence of eight common chronic health\nconditions, examine socioeconomic inequalities in the diseases,\nand provide information about epidemiologic aspects of chronic\nconditions among older adults in China.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy Population and Design\nThe World Health Organization's SAGE is a longitudinal study\nof ageing and older adults health in six low- and middle-income\ncountries (China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russian Federation and\nSouth Africa) [6]. SAGE-China Wave 1 provides the baseline\nround of data for a national sample of respondents aged 50-plus. A\nprobability sampling design and a five-stage cluster sampling\nstrategy were used. First, eight provinces/municipalies (Guan-\ndong, Hubei, Jilin, Shaanxi, Shandong, Shanghai, Yunnan, and\nZhejiang) were selected from a total of 31 provinces/municipalities\nin China, according to its geographic area and social economic\nlevel (Figure 1). Second, one county from rural DSPs (national\nDeath Surveillance Points) and one district from urban DSPs in\neach province were selected. In total, eight provinces and 16 strata\nwere selected in SAGE-China. The study sample covers a total of\n64 principle sample units (PSU) (two urban and two rural\ntownships/communities from each county/district), and 127\nsecondary sample units (SSU) (2 Villages/enumeration areas\n(EAs) per township/community) and 254 tertiary sample units\n(TSU) (2 residential blocks per Village/EA). SAGE-China Wave 1\naged 50-plus years. In this study, the data analysis is restricted to\nthe Chinese adult population aged 50-plus. The response rates for\nthe individual questionnaire was above 98 percent, for a final total\nChronic Conditions\nInformation on chronic conditions was based on self-reports.\nRespondents were asked if they had been diagnosed with any of\nthe following chronic medical conditions: angina, arthritis, asthma,\nstroke, diabetes, depression, chronic lung disease and hyperten-\nsion. The question format used was, ``Have you ever been\ndiagnosed with/told by a health care professional you have... ?''\nfor each health condition.\nIn an effort to improve prevalence estimates based on self-\nreport, a set of validated symptom-based questions and related\ndiagnostic algorithms were also used to estimate disease prevalence\nestimates for angina, arthritis, asthma and depression [7]. In\naddition, blood pressure was measured three times, at intervals of\none minute, to estimate the prevalence of hypertension. An\naverage of the latter two measurements was used as the final blood\npressure. The diagnostic criteria and classification of hypertension\nwere based on the Chinese Guidelines on Prevention and Control\nof Hypertension [8] and the Sixth Joint National Committee on\nPrevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood\nPressure guidelines [9]. The definition of hypertension is systolic\nblood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mmHg and/or\ndiastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mmHg and/or\nself-reported treatment of hypertension with antihypertensive\nmedication in the last two weeks.\nSociodemographic Variables\nSocio-demographic variables include age, gender, education,\nrural/urban residence and income quintiles. For analysis purposes,\n70 to 79 years; and 80-plus years. Education levels were mapped\nto an international standard and categorized into six groups for\nanalysis [10]. The income quintiles are based on possession of a set\nof assets and a number of dwelling characteristics [11]. The\nvariable takes on the values Q1 to Q5 with Q1 being the quintile\nwith the poorest households and Q5 the quintile with the richest\nhouseholds.\nStatistical Methods\nAll analyses were carried out using normalized weights of each\nindividual to compensate for undercoverage, which was based on\nselection probability, nonresponse, and post-stratification adjust-\nments. These weights are used to calculate self-reported and\nsymptom-based reporting prevalence of chronic conditions.\nSTATA SE version 9 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX) was used\nin the analyses to calculate prevalence estimates, standard errors,\nand 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariate logistic regression\nwas performed to examine the relationship between chronic\nconditions and socio-demographics such as sex, age, urban/rural\nsetting and household wealth. Odds ratios are reported with 95%\nconfidence intervals and a two-side p-value of 0.05 used as the cut-\noff for statistical significance.\nEthics Statement\nThe study protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethical\nreview committee of Chinese Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention, to ensure the rights and the welfare of the subject are\nadequately protected; the potential risks are outweighed by\npotential benefits. Written informed consent was obtained from\nall participants.\nResults\nSample characteristics were presented in Table 1. From the\nmean age of was 62.6 years (SD 0.3). The majority of the\nof all respondents (47.3%) lived in a rural area. Fifty-eight percent\nhad completed primary school or beyond.\nThe self-reported prevalence of the eight major chronic\nconditions was estimated for the older population (See Table 2).\nThese conditions were commonly reported among respondents,\nespecially among the oldest\u00adold (aged 80-plus years), and varied by\ncondition. Hypertension and arthritis were most commonly\nreported, with a prevalence of 26.8% and 22.0% respectively,\nwhereas asthma and depression were least common in both sexes,\nwith a prevalence of 2.0% and 0.3%, respectively. Besides self-\nreported prevalence, symptom-reported prevalence was also\nexamined for angina, arthritis, asthma and depression. Self-\nreported prevalence of arthritis was close to the symptom-based\nreporting prevalence (22% vs. 20.4%), whereas the symptom-\nChronic Conditions among Older Chinese Adults\nbased reporting prevalence was higher than the self-reported rates\ndepression (2.0% vs. 0.3%). The prevalence of hypertension based\non measurements, was 59.7%, over two times higher than the self-\nreported rate (Figure 2).\nAs shown in Table 3, comorbid conditions were also common.\nBased on self-report data, 49.8% of respondents reported one of\nthe selected chronic conditions, 18.9% reported having two\nconditions, 5.8% reported having three conditions, and 1.4%\nreported having four or more conditions. Older age, female and\nurban residence were variables that increased the likelihood of\nhaving chronic conditions (Figure 3).\nMultivariate logistic regression analyses showed that the\nprevalence of self-reported chronic conditions differed significantly\nby sociodemographic variables. Respondents aged 70\u00ad79 were\nmore likely to report any chronic condition than those in other age\ngroups. Men were more likely than women to have a stroke,\nchronic lung disease and asthma. Wealthier respondents were\nmore likely to report diabetes and hypertension. All the selected\nchronic conditions were more common among urban dwellers,\nespecially diabetes and depression (see Table 4).\nDiscussion\nSAGE-China Wave 1 is a cross-sectional study which is also\npart of the multi-country longitudinal WHO SAGE study. In this\nstudy, the data analysis is restricted to the Chinese adult\npopulation aged 50 years and over. Our study provides the first\noverview of the magnitude of major chronic conditions based on a\nnationwide sample of Chinese older adults using self-reported and\nvalidated symptom-based reporting methods. Despite several local\nor national level studies, that have already reported the prevalence\ncompared with these studies, the present study has a number of\nstrengths: 1) SAGE China is based on a national probability\nsample, which can be generalized to Chinese older adults; 2)\nValidated and standardized questionnaires based on WHO's\nWorld Health Survey to improve cross-national comparability;\nand, 3) Validated symptom-reporting methods were also used to\nestimate and compare prevalence rates for several chronic diseases\nin an effort to improve prevalence estimates based on self-report.\nHowever, an important limitation of SAGE is that the data for\nsome chronic diseases were based on self-reports, which may have\nresulted in recall bias. Self-reported prevalence also may be\naffected by respondents' knowledge, their willingness to report the\ncondition, and frequency of contact with a physician.\nFigure 1. SAGE-China Wave 1 sample distribution.\nChronic Conditions among Older Chinese Adults\nFindings from SAGE-China Wave 1 show that chronic\nconditions are common among Chinese older adults. Overall,\n50% of Chinese aged 50 years and older reported at least one of\nthe eight major chronic conditions identified, increasing to 78%\nfor those aged 80 years and older. Compared to other available\ndata in China, noting the wide variation in definition of chronic\nconditions, in the selected survey population, and in sample sizes,\nthe prevalence of multiple chronic conditions among older adults\nhas been reported to range from 50% to 91%. This study\ngenerated prevalence-estimates that are generally lower.\nHypertension was most commonly reported among older\nChinese men and women, the prevalence of hypertension based\non measurement (59.7%) was more than two times higher than\nself-reported prevalence (26.2%). The prevalence from measured\nblood pressure was slightly higher than the findings from repeated\nmeasurements in the 2002 China National Nutrition and Health\naged 60 years or older, had hypertension [15]. The results from\nanother national survey study using repeated blood pressure\nmeasurements (chronic disease risk factor surveillance in China,\n2007), showed the overall prevalence of hypertension in Chinese\nsimilar to the findings of our study. Our results also indicated that\nless than half of those who were hypertensive were aware of their\nhypertension status. Dongfeng Gu et,al. [17] also found just 46%\nof those aged 65\u00ad74 with hypertension were aware of their\ndiagnosis. Since hypertension is a leading cause of death and risk\nfactor for stroke, heart disease and diabetes, action should be taken\nto promote awareness of hypertension in older Chinese adults.\nArthritis is more common among adults, especially older adults\n[18]. Self-reported arthritis ranked second in this study at 22%,\nand was very close to the prevalence generated through symptom\u00ad\nreporting method (20.4%). The most likely reason is that the\ndiscomfort and pain associated with arthritis are more likely to\nimpact activities and prompt people to seek health care services, as\ncompared to a ``silent killer'' like hypertension. Angina was ranked\nas the third most common chronic disease in our study: 7.9% by\nself-report and 10% using the Rose questionnaire, a recent\nhousehold-based, community survey showed lower prevalence,\nusing the Rose questionnaire among Chinese 60 years or older\nThe diabetes rate is increasing in China and becoming a\nburdensome chronic disease [19,20]. The present findings for\ndiabetes prevalence were slightly higher than those reported by the\n2007 Chronic Disease and Risk Factor Surveillance carried out by\nto be 3.0% and 5.3%, respectively [16]. Self-reported diabetes\nprevalence in our study (5.7% in men and 7.5% in women) is\nmuch lower than that reported in a previous nationally\nrepresentative study [21], which found a rate of 20.4% for people\n60 years and older using a clinical definition of fasting whole blood\nglucose of 6.1 mm or higher. This suggests that about half of the\nrespondents are unaware of their diabetic status. Glycosylated\nTable 1.

Self-reported prevalence of stroke in this\nstudy was 3.1%. it is very close to the prevalence rate among\nChinese Singaporeans aged 50 and older in other study [23]. Also,\nthis present findings for the self-reported prevalence of stroke\nanother study in china that estimated the self-reported prevalence\nTable 2.

Prevalence of chronic conditions by self-report and symptom reporting.\nChronic Conditions among Older Chinese Adults\nDepression is one of the most common mental health problems\namong older adults, but notoriously difficult to assess through\nhealth surveys in China [24,25]. So there has been little\ninformation about depression in older Chinese adults. In this\nstudy, the self-reported prevalence rate is only 0.3%, and\nconsiderably higher using symptom-reporting and diagnostic\nalgorithm (2%), but is still much lower than among western older\npopulations [26,27]. A meta-analysis on depression of older people\nin China also found a lower prevalence of depression in mainland\nChina compared to some western countries, and speculated that\nTable 3.

Prevalence of multiple chronic conditions by gender and age group.\nChronic Conditions among Older Chinese Adults\nthe possible reasons are Chinese tradition and culture [28]. In\naddition, as in many other societies, the stigma of mental health is\nlikely present, leading to underdiagnosis and low health care\nseeking behavior.\nIn China, respiratory diseases are the third leading cause of\ndeath in rural areas and the fourth leading cause of death in urban\nareas [29]. In SAGE, chronic lung disease is also relatively\ncommon among older Chinese men and women. Over 7% of\nrespondents aged 50 years and older reported having chronic lung\ndisease, consisting of 9.3% of men and 6.6% of women. The\nprevalence of asthma in this study appears to be a little high,\ncompared to prevalence observed in the west, with a rate of 2% by\nself-report and 3.9% by symptom reporting. However, this finding\nis very similar to the 2007 China chronic disease and risk factor\nsurveillance with self-reported prevalence of 2.7% among adults\nIn this study, increasing age is associated with higher self-\nreported prevalence of chronic conditions. It suggests that special\nattention is needed for older adults in primary care services.\nUrban/rural inequalities in the prevalence of these chronic\nconditions were also found in this study, which is a very important\nfinding. All these chronic conditions are more common in urban\nareas, especially diabetes, hypertension and depression. Other\nstudies also reported higher prevalence of self-reported chronic\nconditions in urban dwellers [4,15,30]. For example, the third\nChinese National Health Service Survey (CNHSS), found that the\nprevalence of self-reported physician diagnoses of chronic diseases\nwas lower among rural than urban residents [10]. The reasons for\nthe high prevalence in urban areas is probably due to (1) the\nhigher rates of common chronic condition risk factors among\nurban residents compared to rural residents, including low levels of\nphysical activity, air pollution, overweight and obesity; and, (2)\npersons who live in rural areas being less willing to tell interviewers\nabout their illness due to low education level, traditional\nunderstanding of diseases and consuetudinary restriction.\nA strong negative income gradient was found in the prevalence\nof diabetes and hypertension. Even after adjusting for age, sex and\nurban/rural residence. Wenying Yang et, al. also found diabetes\nprevalence to be slightly higher in developed region in China as\ncompared to undeveloped regions. Differences in nutrition and\nlifestyle may play a very important role. Yet SAGE results contrast\nfindings of other studies in developed counties [31,32]. For\nexample, Rabi, et, al. [31] found that low income is associated\nwith a higher prevalence of diabetes in Canada.\nFindings from this study indicated that chronic conditions were\ncommon among the older adult population in China. In view of\nthe large older population in China, chronic conditions are likely\nto be both a health issue and also a social challenge. Prevention\nand early intervention targeting older adults and urban residents\nshould be prioritized.\n"
