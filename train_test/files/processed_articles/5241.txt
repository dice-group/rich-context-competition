Associations between gene polymorphisms and\nantihypertensive therapy outcomes were assessed by generalized linear model fitting. A decrease\nof ! 10 mmHg in systolic blood pressure indicated an effective treatment outcome.\nResults: A total of 93 patients were included in the study. Mutant allele frequencies of 61.29% and\n58.60% were obtained for ADRB1 and CYP2D6, respectively. There was no significant interaction\nbetween the effects of ADRB1 and CYP2D6 gene polymorphisms on treatment outcome. Patients\nhomozygous for the mutant ADRB1 genotype (CC) had better treatment outcomes than those\nheterozygous for the mutation (GC). Interestingly, b-blocker treatment duration was an\nindependent factor associated with treatment outcome.\nConclusions: The ADRB1 1165G > C gene polymorphism and b-blocker treatment duration are\nindependent factors associated with b-blocker treatment outcome. These findings suggest that the\nselection of antihypertensive therapy should take into consideration the patient's genotype.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nimr.sagepub.com\n1Department of Laboratory Medicine, First Affiliated\nHospital of Fujian Medical University, Longyan, China\n2Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, First Affiliated\nHospital of Fujian Medical University, Longyan, China\n3SurExam Bio-Tech Co.

For example,\nChinese men homozygous for the Arg389\nvariant have been reported to show heigh-\ntened responses to metoprolol, in terms of\nresting heart rate as well as resting and\nexercise blood pressure.11 Furthermore, in\npatients with essential hypertension, both the\nhave been found to be associated with the\nresponse to metoprolol treatment: patients\nbest responders, while little or no response\nongoing debate concerning the importance\nof this effect, with one study reporting no\nmajor effect of these polymorphisms on the\nresponse to atenolol treatment.14\nThe enzyme CYP2D6 accounts for only a\nsmall percentage (<2%) of all hepatic cyto-\nchromes, but is responsible for the metab-\nolism of $25% of all drugs in current\nclinical use.15\u00ad17 Several studies have exam-\nined the effects of CYP2D6 phenotype in\nrelation to the cardiovascular system.18\nPolymorphisms of the CYP2D6 gene are\nassociated with a wide variety in CYP2D6\nenzyme activity, ranging from complete\ndeficiency to ultrafast metabolism.19 10-\nHydroxylation of the b-blocker bufuralol\nby CYP2D6 was markedly decreased with\nthe Pro34 variant, indicating that CYP2D6\nPro34Ser polymorphism is significantly\nassociated with CYP2D6 enzyme activity.20\nAlthough several studies have identified an\ninfluence of CYP2D6 polymorphisms on\nmetoprolol metabolism rate,16,21 inconsist-\nent data have been reported with regard to\nresponse to metoprolol therapy,22 with some\nstudies reporting an association23 and others\nshowing little or no effect.24\nAlthough there is some evidence that\nADRB1 and CYP2D6 gene polymorphisms\ninfluence the response to antihypertensive\ntherapy with b-blockers, there is ongoing\ndebate concerning the clinical importance of\nthese effects. Furthermore, it is not known\nwhether an interaction exists between the\neffects resulting from polymorphisms of\nthese two genes. The aim of the present\nstudy was to investigate the association\n(Pro34Ser) polymorphisms, and outcomes\nin patients with hypertension treated with\nthe b-blocker metoprolol.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nChinese patients attending the Department\nof Cardiovascular Medicine, First Affiliated\nHospital of Fujian Medical University,\ngrade I\u00adII essential hypertension (systolic\nnosed according to the 1999 World Health\nOrganization/International Society of\nHypertension guidelines,25 with no previous\nexposure to b-blockers, were recruited to the\n2012. Exclusion criteria included severe car-\ndiac, liver or renal disease, patient\nwithdrawal from the study or incomplete\nclinical data.\nWritten informed consent was obtained\nfrom all patients. The study protocol was\napproved by the Ethics Committee of the\nFirst Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical\nUniversity, Longyan, China.\nFasting blood samples were collected at\n$06.00 h from all patients on admission to\nthe study for the measurement of fasting\nblood glucose, triglyceride and uric acid.\nBlood glucose samples were collected using\npotassium oxalate as an anticoagulant. All\nsamples were sent for immediate analysis.\nAll patients received 25 mg metoprolol\ntwice a day or 40.5 mg sustained release\nmetoprolol tartrate once a day. No other\nantihypertensive therapy was given. Blood\npressure was measured every 4 weeks, and\npatients were followed up for 12 weeks. A\ndecrease of !10 mmHg in the systolic blood\npressure was considered to indicate an\neffective treatment outcome.\nGenotyping and xTAG liquid-chip\ntechnology\nBefore commencing antihypertensive treat-\nment, a 2ml peripheral blood sample, antic-\noagulated with 15mg/ml ethylenediamine\ntetra-acetic acid, was collected from each\npatient for genotyping. Samples were shaken\ngently approximately eight times to ensure the\nanticoagulant was well mixed, then stored at\n\u00ad20C until analysis. A DNA extraction kit\n(SurExam Biotech, Guangzhou, China) was\nused, according to the manufacturer's instruc-\ntions, to separate genomic DNA. Genotyping\n100C> T was performed using xTAG\u00d5\nliquid-chip technology (Luminex, Austin, TX,\nUSA). The xTAG protocol begins with a\nmultiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR),\nwhich is used to amplify regions of the target\ngenes containing the mutation site. The result-\ning PCR products are treated with exonuclease\nI and shrimp alkaline phosphatase to remove\nexcess nucleotides and primers, and cleaned\nusing Exo-SAP\u00d5 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara,\nCA, USA). They are then subjected to an\nallele-specific primer extension (ASPE) step\nusingspecificprimersequencescomplementary\nto the given genes of interest that are tagged\nwith an xTAG universal tag sequence. These\nprimer sequences were 50-CCGCAAGGCCT\nCGCAAGGCCTTCCAGC-30 for the muta-\npolymorphism. The ASPE products were\nthen hybridized to specific antitag probes\nprecoated onto polystyrene microspheres,\nand streptavidin phycoerythrin was added\nfor fluorescent detection using a Luminex\nStatistical analyses\nData were reported as mean \u00c6 SD.\nAssociations between the gene polymorphisms\nand treatment outcomes of b-blocker anti-\nhypertensive therapy were assessed using\ntwo-factor repeated measures analysis of\nvariance\n(ANOVA).

Patients'\nbaseline characteristics are summarized in\nTable 1, and their demographic and clinical\ncharacteristics according to age group are\ngiven in Table 2.

There were no significant\ndifferences in sex, smoking status or age for\nthe various ADRB1 and CYP2D6 genotypes\nanalysed (Table 4).\nCorrelations between polymorphisms and\ntreatment outcomes\nThere was no significant interaction between\nthe effects of the ADRB1 and CYP2D6 genes\non treatment outcome (Table 5). When the\n100 C > T polymorphisms on the outcome of\nantihypertensive therapy with b-blockers for\n12 weeks were analysed, ADRB1 poly-\nmorphism was shown to have a significant\neffect on therapeutic outcome (P < 0.05)\n(Table 6). Results of our analyses investigat-\ning the effects of CYP2D6 polymorphism on\nthe outcome of antihypertensive therapy in\nthis Chinese cohort were not statistically\nsignificant (data not shown).

Using multivariate ANOVA,\nfour correction methods indicated that dur-\nation of treatment with the b-blocker was an\nindependent factor associated with treat-\nment outcome (P < 0.05) (Table 7); however,\nthere was no correlation between ADRB1\npolymorphisms and the duration of b-\nDiscussion\nThe present study demonstrated that, in\nChinese patients with essential hyperten-\nsion, ADRB1 polymorphisms exert a much\nmore important effect on the outcome of\ntherapy with b-blockers than CYP2D6 poly-\nmorphisms, with superior efficacy found in\npatients homozygous for the ADRB1\nobtained for the ADRB1 and CYP2D6\nmutant alleles. There was no significant\ninteraction between the effects of ADRB1\nand CYP2D6 gene polymorphisms on treat-\nment outcomes.\nFurthermore, the duration of b-blocker\ntreatment was shown to be an independent\nfactor associated with treatment outcome\nfor antihypertensive therapy with b-block-\ners. Tailoring therapy to a patient's geno-\ntype could potentially improve the efficacy\nof antihypertensive treatment.\nThe pathogenesis of essential hyperten-\nsion is influenced by the interaction of many\nenvironmental and genetic factors.1,2\nSeveral gene variants have been evaluated\nas candidate determinants for hypertension.\nThe CYP2D6 gene is highly polymorphic,\nwith $80 distinct alleles and allele variants.\nCYP2D6 polymorphisms have been demon-\nstrated to affect the enzymatic activity of the\nshown to have a major impact on the\npharmacokinetics of the b-blocker metopro-\nlol.8,28 This has led to questions about the\neffects of these kinetic differences on drug\nadverse effects and efficacy.21,29 In the pre-\nmorphism had a starkly reduced effect on b-\nblocker efficacy compared with the ADRB1\nessential hypertension.\nGenotype Allele\nPolymorphism Wild type\nHeterozygous\nmutation\nHomozygous\nmutation Wild type Mutation\nData presented as n patients or alleles (%).\nTable 1.

Analysis of the effects on the outcome of antihypertensive therapy with b-blockers of ADRB1 gene\npolymorphisms using two-factor repeated measures analysis of variance.\nSource Degrees of freedom Type III sum of squares Mean square F-value Probability > F\nHence, it is likely that CYP2D6 polymorph-\nisms have no major clinical impact on the\nresponse to therapy with b-blockers.\nThe b-blockers play a major role in the\ntreatment of essential hypertension, and are\nwidely used for the management of cardio-\nvascular diseases. The efficacy of b-blockers\nis mainly attributed to their actions at the\n-adrenoceptor, which plays an important\nrole in regulating the activity of the sympa-\nthetic nervous system.30 However, the\nresponse to b-blockers varies between indi-\nviduals, and this may be due in part to\nADRB1 gene polymorphisms. Multiple stu-\ndies have demonstrated the influence of\nADRB1 polymorphisms on the response to\ntreatment with b-blockers. For example, the\nexpression level of myocardial ADRB1 was\nshown to affect the antihypertensive effects\nof metoprolol.31 In addition, a clear associ-\nation between ADRB1 polymorphisms and\nantihypertensive response to b-blockers\nsuch as metoprolol and carvedilol has been\ndemonstrated.32,33 Importantly, a frequent\nADRB1 polymorphism affecting the heart-\nrate response to carvedilol has been identi-\nfied.34 The present study demonstrated that\nthe ADRB1 mutation had a significant clin-\nical effect on b-blocker therapy. This is\nconsistent with reports that mutations in\nthe ADRB1 gene cause decreased b1\n-adre-\nnoceptor sensitivity,26,27 and is in good\nagreement with other findings in both\nhealthy individuals and essential hyperten-\nsion patients. In healthy men, homozygosity\nfor the Arg389 allele appeared to confer an\nenhanced response to metoprolol in terms of\nFigure 1.

MM, homozygous mutation; WM,\nheterozygous mutation; WW, wild-type.\nFurthermore, in essential hypertension\npolymorphisms were associated with\nthe response to metoprolol therapy,\nand worst responders, respectively.12,13\nOther studies have revealed an association\nbetween Gly389 and lower systolic and/or\ndiastolic blood pressures, as well as reduced\nrisk of essential hypertension.35\u00ad37 The\nSer49Gly polymorphism has also been\nshown to be associated with heart rate,7\ndiastolic blood pressure38 and the systolic\nblood pressure response to antihypertensive\nmedication.39 Interestingly, pharmacoki-\nnetic studies have shown an impact of\nADRB1 polymorphisms on carvedilol\npharmacokinetics.30 In particular, real-time\noptical recording has demonstrated differ-\nences in the response to carvedilol between\nA few limitations of the present study\nneed to be considered. First, this was a\npreliminary prospective study with loose\npatient inclusion and exclusion criteria, sus-\nceptible to the limitations and biases inher-\nent in such a design. Second, the sample size\nwas small, meaning that the data may not\nproperly define the gene\u00addrug interactions.\nFurthermore, the follow-up time was very\nshort. Therefore, a large-scale, prospective,\ncontrolled study is needed to conErm the\nimportance of ADRB1 and CYP2D6 gene\npolymorphisms on the antihypertensive\neffect of b-blockers.\nIn conclusion, the identification of appro-\npriate genetic markers may be of great\nbenefit for the management of hypertension\nand related chronic diseases in future,\nallowing the tailoring of personalized\nTable 8.
