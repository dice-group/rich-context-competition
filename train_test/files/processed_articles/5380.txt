    "abstract": "Abstract\nApparent biological motion is the perception of plausible movements when two alternating\nimages depicting the initial and final phase of an action are presented at specific stimulus onset\nasynchronies. Here, we show lower subjective apparent biological motion perception when actions\nare observed from a first relative to a third visual perspective. These findings are discussed within\nthe context of sensorimotor contributions to body ownership.\n",

Images taken from a third person perspective (3PP)\nhave been typically used, and recent studies with immersive systems investigated action\nobservation and action monitoring mechanisms in first person perspective (1PP; Padrao,\nGonzalez-Franco, Sanchez-Vives, Slater, & Rodriguez-Fornells, 2016; Pavone et al., 2016).\nTo date, the role of 1PP in ABM task has not been assessed.\nThirteen healthy right-handed volunteers wore an Head Mounted Display (Oculus DK1)\nand observed two avatars (Alvarez et al., 2011; Orvalho, Bastos, Parke, Oliveira, & Alvarez,\n2012): from a 1PP and a 3PP (Figure 1(a)). Participants assessed the plausibility of the\nCorresponding author:\nEmmanuele Tidoni, Department of Psychology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.\nEmail: emmanuele.tidoni@uniroma1.it\ni-Perception\nipe.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without\nfurther permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sage-\npub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nperceived ABM (through vs. above an obstacle) for the right index and little finger, in two\nseparate blocks, by pressing two buttons with the middle and ring finger of the left hand. The\ninitial and final positions of the fingers were presented for 90 ms and five stimulus onset\nincreased the perception of seeing the finger moving along a trajectory above an obstacle\n(Figure 1(a)). Two finger movements enabled to verify the generalizability of the results and\ndescribe any possible role of motor dexterity on visual perception (i.e., index finger\nmovements are more familiar than little finger actions; Plata Bello, Modron\n~ o, Marcano, &\nGonza\n~ o, Marcano, & Gonza\norder and response buttons were almost counterbalanced across subjects. There were 80 trials\nfor each block (8 trials for each SOA-Finger interaction; 40 for 1PP; 40 for 3PP). Participants\nwere allowed to watch the stimuli for as long as needed, and ``perceived ABM'' was collected\n(i.e., plausible ABM ``I perceived the finger as moving over the obstacle'' vs. implausible\nABM ``I perceived the finger as moving through the obstacle''). No visible movements\nof subjects' right fingers were noted during the experiment. After each block participants\nverbally rated on a 7-point rating scale their agreement with a set of questions\n(\u00c03 \u00bc completely disagree, 0 \u00bc neither agree nor disagree, 3 \u00bc completely agree; see\nFigure 1(b)) in order to control illusory sensations over the virtual bodies.\nBinary ABM answers were analyzed using logistic-GLMER mixed effects regression in\n``lme4'' package (Bates, Maechler, Bolker, & Walker, 2016; R Development Core Team,\n2013) with Perspective, SOA, and Finger as fixed effects. Ratings were analyzed using\nCumulative Linear Mixed Model (CLMM) in ``ordinal'' package (Christensen, 2015) with\nPerspective and Finger as fixed effects. For all multilevel analyses, a by-subjects random\nintercept was included, and the saturated model (i.e., the model with all the available fixed\nparameters, factors, and interactions) was simplified by hierarchically dropping effects and\ninteractions with p > .1. For the sake of simplicity, we report only the parameters of the final\nbest-fitting model by considering both Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information\ncriterion, and the log likelihood indexes.\nPlausible ABM (i.e., above the obstacle) was affected by SOA (p < .001, Figure 1(c)),\n(p \u00bc .053) indicated a lower tendency to report plausible ABM (i.e., ``above'') for the index\n(49.5%) relative to the little finger (53.3%). This was accounted for by a significant\nPerspective \u00c2 Finger interaction with a lower rate of plausible ABM for Index-1PP relative\nto all other conditions (all p < .001) and Index-3PP relative to Little-1PP (p \u00bc .011, Figure 1(d)).\nFinally, participants experienced full-body-ownership and perceived control (Tieri,\nTidoni, Pavone, & Aglioti, 2015a) over the observed movements (Tieri, Tidoni, Pavone, &\nAglioti, 2015b) as compared with control questions (all p < .001, Figure 1(f) to (h)).\nImportantly, participants embodied only the virtual hand observed in 1PP compared to\nthe hand in 3PP and to control questions (p < .001, Figure 1(g)).\nOverall, the present data indicate that ABM perception may be affected by perspective and\nmotor dexterity. That lower ABM was experienced only for the index in 1PP suggests a\ncombined role of motor familiarity (Plata Bello et al., 2013, 2015) and embodiment over\nABM perception. Crucially, participants were less prone to report a plausible ``above'' ABM\nwhen the action was observed from a 1PP, and further studies are necessary to disentangle the\nrole of visual perspective from body ownership and the perceived control over the observed\nreality represents a useful tool to test the role of bodily re-afferences and sensorimotor brain\nareas responsible of motion/action perception during perceptual judgments (Orgs et al., 2016;\nFigure 1. (a) An image showing the virtual environment and the initial and final position for index and little\nfingers in 1PP and 3PP. Obstacle's size was adjusted to cover $40% of the fingers' length for both 1PP and 3PP.\n(b) The items participants answered on a \u00c03 to \u00fe3 rating scale.
