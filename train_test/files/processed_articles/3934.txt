    "abstract": "Abstract\nMobile computing has supplanted internet computing because of the proliferation of cloud-based applications and mobile\ndevices (such as smartphones, palmtops, and tablets). As a result of this, workers bring their mobile devices to the workplace\nand use them for enterprise work. The policy of allowing the employees to work with their own personal mobile devices is\ncalled Bring Your Own Devices (BYOD). In this article, we discuss BYOD's background, prevalence, benefits, challenges, and\npossible security attacks. We then review contributions of academic researchers on BYOD. The Universiti Putra Malaysia\nonline databases (such as IEEE Xplore digital library, Elsevier, Springer, ACM digital library) were used to search for peer-\nreviewed academic publications and other relevant publications on BYOD. The Google Scholar search engine was also used.\nOur thorough review shows that security issues comprise the most significant challenge confronting BYOD policy and that\nvery little has been done to tackle this security challenge. It is our hope that this review will provide a theoretical background\nfor future research and enable researchers to identify researchable areas of BYOD.\n",

The PC era led the information\ntechnology (IT) world to internet computing. Mobile com-\nputing has supplanted internet computing because of the pro-\nliferation of cloud-based applications and mobile devices\n(such as smartphones, laptops, palmtops, and tablets). People\nare able to experience high-quality computing at their palms\nthrough cloud-based applications and mobile devices.\nWorkers bring their personal mobile devices to their work-\nplaces. Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets com-\nbine portability and voice and data services to open up a wide\nvariety of potential mobile applications, \"anytime and any-\nwhere\" (Disterer & Kleiner, 2013). People have started to\nbring their mobile devices to their workplaces and connect to\ntheir company networks to perform their jobs and connect to\nvarious social network platforms such as Facebook and\nBlackBerry Messenger (BBM).\nUsing personal mobile devices for work has given rise to\na trend called \"Bring Your Own Devices\" or BYOD\nBYOD programs and policies empower people to choose the\nbest device to get their work done, including personally\nowned consumer smartphones, tablets, and laptops (Citrix\u00ae,\n2013). BYOD is an enterprise IT policy that encourages\nemployees to use their own devices to access sensitive cor-\nporate data at work through the enterprise IT infrastructure\nBYOD as the use of employee-owned devices to access\nenterprise content and the enterprise network. A BYOD pol-\nicy not only allows employees access to enterprise data when\nat the workplace but also allows them to access enterprise\ndata outside the enterprise environment.\nIn the next sections, we discuss BYOD prevalence, bene-\nfits, challenges, and possible security attacks. We then review\nexisting work on BYOD by academic researchers. Our review\nsearches for peer-reviewed academic research publications,\nwhite paper/survey publications, and publications by infor-\nmation security experts by using The Universiti Putra\nMalaysia online databases published in English language\n(such as IEEE Xplore digital library, Elsevier, Springer, ACM\ndigital library) in the area of information and communication\n1Federal University of Technology, Minna, Nigeria\n2Universiti Putra Malaysia, Malaysia\nCorresponding Author:\nMohd Taufik Abdullah, Department of Computer Science, Faculty of\nComputer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Putra Malaysia,\nEmail: taufik@upm.edu.my\nA Review of Bring Your Own Device on\nSecurity Issues\nMorufu Olalere1,2, Mohd Taufik Abdullah2, Ramlan Mahmod2,\nand Azizol Abdullah2\n Keywords\nBYOD policy, security, data leakage, malware, distributed denial of services\n2 SAGE Open\ntechnology. To conduct general searches, the Google Scholar\nsearch engine was also used.\nPrevalence of BYOD\nAlthough BYOD began to surface in 2003, it really took off\nport the use of smartphones, tablets, and other personal\ndevices in the workplace means that ignoring the need to put\nin place some form of BYOD policy is no longer an option\nfor today's businesses (Millard, 2013). According to a Cisco\n(2012) survey, BYOD is a global phenomenon. Cisco carried\nout this survey across eight countries in three regions (Latin\nAmerica, Asia, and Europe) including both enterprises\nemployees). This survey was an expansion of an earlier con-\nducted survey in the United States that included 600 IT lead-\nconsumers in 17 countries in both emerging economies and\ndeveloped economies (Figure 1) revealed that 75% of users\nin countries with emerging high-growth economies such as\nMalaysia, Singapore, Brazil, India, and Russia use their own\nmobile devices at work, whereas 44% of workers in coun-\ntries with developed economies such as the United States,\nUnited Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, and Japan use their own\nmobile devices at work. Gartner (2014) predicted that by\npersonal smart devices. These reports show that BYOD has\nbecome prevalent in both emerging economies and devel-\noped countries.\nBenefits and Challenges of BYOD\nWhen employees have the flexibility to choose the best device\nfor their office work, they become more mobile and produc-\ntive. The business benefits by having access to its employees\nanytime, anyplace, blurring the work\u00adleisure divide, and it may\nsave costs by having employees purchase their preferred device\nrather than providing devices out of the corporate budget\n(2013) identified some valuable benefits of BYOD. These ben-\nefits are management flexibility, cost saving, maximized\nemployee contentment, and simplified IT infrastructure.\nBYOD also provides a high level of convenience to employees.\nThere are published white papers about BYOD from corporate\norganizations and information security experts that discuss the\nbenefits of BYOD. More details about the benefits of BYOD\nMorrow (2012). However, if both the organizations and their\nemployees are to reap the benefits of BYOD, then they must\nalso worry about the challenges of BYOD policy.\nAlthough businesses are mainly concerned with maintain-\ning security, employees are worried about preserving the con-\nvenience they need to work from their mobile devices, as well\nas the privacy they expect regarding the personal information\non the device (AirWatch, 2012). One of the biggest challenges\nfor organizations is that corporate data are being delivered to\ndevices that are not managed by the IT department. This has\nsecurity implications for data leakage, data theft, and\nFigure 1. Level of BYOD deployment in both emerging economies and developed economies (Ovum, 2012).\nNote. BYOD = Bring Your Own Devices.\nOlalere et al. 3\nthat the real BYOD challenge is security and that the real secu-\nrity challenge is not actually about the devices, it is about con-\ntrolling access from the devices to the corporate data. The\nsecurity challenges associated with BYOD are a point of con-\ncern for the captains and information security officers of enter-\nprises. This challenge has also attracted the attention of\nacademic researchers. Alharthy and Shawkat (2013) claimed\nthat loss or theft of mobile devices is the biggest risk that a\nbusiness could face by implementing BYOD because it leads\nto loss of data to an unknown user. Thielens (2013) argued that\na secure and scalable BYOD strategy is required to manage the\nrisks introduced by employee-owned devices as a result of loss\nof a mobile device, theft, or employee termination. A Forrester\nstanding of the impact of the BYOD program on their business\nunit or organization revealed that security concerns are among\nthe top challenges to implementing BYOD programs.\nBYOD and Mobile Devices\nManagement (MDM) Applications\nMDM applications are developed to address some of the\nchallenges associated with mobile devices (such as policy\nmanagement, software distribution, and inventory manage-\nment) that are not related to BYOD security. MDM function-\nality is similar to that of PC configuration life-cycle\nmanagement (PCCLM) tools; however, mobile-platform-\nspecific requirements are often also included in MDM suites.\nMore details on how MDM works can be found in MTI\nTechnology (2014). Many enterprises view most of the\nMDM applications as a solution to the security challenges of\nBYOD. However, MDM does not completely address the\nsecurity challenges of BYOD. MDM does not prevent a\nhacker from attacking an employee's device or a thief from\nstealing it and accessing sensitive data (Leavitt, 2013).\nBYOD programs will fail due to deployment of highly\nrestrictive MDM measures.\nPossible Threats of BYOD\nA survey carried out by security vendor Trustwave revealed\nthat 90% of vulnerabilities common in desktop computers\nwere also present in mobile devices, regardless of the operat-\ning system (Leavitt, 2013). Literature shows that data leakage,\ndistributed denial of service (DDoS), and malware are the\nmost challenging security threats to BYOD (Morrow, 2012).\nFigure 2. BYOD challenges with security concerns at the top (Forrester, 2012).\nNote. BYOD = Bring Your Own Devices.\n4 SAGE Open\nData Leakage\nData leakage occurs as a result of access to enterprise data\nanywhere and anytime by employees. An enterprise has little\nor no control over corporate data because corporate data are\nnow stored and accessed by personal mobile devices of\nemployees. If an employee losses the device, the enterprise\ndata on the device will be available to any person who finds\nthe device. If the data available in the lost personal device are\nconfidential enterprise data, they can be made available pub-\nlicly by the person in the possession of the device.\nA DDoS attack is a coordinated attack on the availability of\nservices of a given target system or network that is launched\nindirectly through many compromised computing systems.\nDDoS can deny regular employees from running machines\non computer networks or their own personal devices. Any\nenterprise that is subjected to a DDoS attack will negatively\nfeel the impact on its server, and this will ultimately deny the\navailability of the system to legitimate users.\nMalware\nMalware refers to malicious applications that can affect both\nmobile devices and corporate applications. Mobile malware\ninclude applications with code embedded within them that\ncompromise the security of a mobile device or related data.\nWhen a device is compromised by malware, corporate confi-\ndential data can be lost and corporate identities can be imper-\nsonated by the attacker. In addition to compromising\nindividual devices, malware can also affect corporate appli-\ncations, thereby rendering them unusable or non-functional.\nMalicious applications normally take the form of normal\ncorporate applications that have been injected with malicious\ncode. In addition, malicious applications can be encountered\nwhen a user visits a compromised site. More details on how\nmalware affects BYOD can be found in MTI Technology\n(2014). Table 1 summarizes causes and implications of com-\nmon threats described above.\nResearchers' Contributions on BYOD\nAlthough BYOD began to surface in 2003, it really took off\nwere executed by consulting firms that mostly offered\ndescriptions of the phenomenon and normative advice for\nexecutives (Bj\u00f6rn et al., 2012). There are white papers pro-\nviding frameworks under which BYOD can be deployed.\nSome of these white papers identified the risk associated\nwith BYOD and provided non-technical (policy-based\nsolutions) solutions. EY (2013) presented a white paper\nthat divides the BYOD risk landscape into three areas.\nThese areas are securing mobile devices, addressing appli-\ncation risk, and managing mobile environment. The paper\noffered non-technical solutions to these risks and concluded\nby presenting eight steps to secure and improve BYOD pro-\ngrams. The Deloitte (2013) research report comprises an\neffort to formulate an evidence-based commentary on the\nstate of BYOD in the United Kingdom. The report attempts\nto cut through confusion and offer pragmatic advice incor-\nporating a broad range of management perspectives from\nIT to risk management, tax, and talent. Another survey of\nTable 1.

BYOD = Bring Your Own Devices; DDoS = distributed denial of service.\nOlalere et al. 5\nmore than 500 IT professionals aimed to understand and\naddress risk-associated BYOD was carried out by Johnson\n(2012). The intent of this non-scientific survey was to\ndetermine the type of mobile device usage allowed for\nenterprise applications and what level of policies and con-\ntrols enterprises have around this type of usage. Denman\n(2013) presented their expert opinions on BYOD security\nissues and advice on how organizations can handle this\nsecurity challenge administratively. They identify data\nsecurity, malware, and BYOD network security as the main\nsecurity challenges.\nHowever, the literature shows that security issues in\nBYOD are a major concern for academic researchers.\nNiehaves, Koffer, Ortbatch, and Katschewitz (2012) claimed\nthat from an information system research perspective, a rig-\norous application of methods and theory to help practitioners\nunderstand the phenomenon of IT consumerization in gen-\neral, and its implications for employee performance in par-\nticular, remain lacking. However, tremendous efforts were\nmade in terms of research on mobile device security, though\nprior to workers owning mobile devices as tools for the\nworkplace. Different platforms call for different security\nmeasures. Moreover, most vendors do not design smart-\nphones primarily for businesses but rather for consumers\nwho will use their phones as personal devices (Grover, 2013).\nThe security mechanisms offered by most popular mobile\noperating systems offer only limited protection to the threats\nposed by malicious applications that may be inadvertently\ninstalled by the users, and therefore, they do not meet the\nsecurity standards required in corporate environments\n(Armando, Costa, & Merlo, 2013). Polla, Martinelli, and\nSgandurra (2013) presented a survey on security for mobile\ndevices.\nGheorghe and Neuhaus (2013) aimed to design and evalu-\nate concrete privacy mechanisms called Privacy-Preserving\nAccountability for personal Devices (PriPARD, pronounced\n\"prepared\") for mobile devices used in a corporate environ-\nment. The aim was to protect user privacy within the corpo-\nrate network and non-disclosure outside this network, and\nthe vision was to gather practical experience with trade-offs\nbetween monitoring and privacy need, to help both mobile\ndevice users and managers of corporate networks. PriPARD\ndoes not examine the overall privacy of existing approaches\nas perceived by the user of the device, but will look for ways\nto allow employees to check what private information is\nemitted and gathered when they work (Gheorghe & Neuhaus,\nopen problem of preventing (not only detecting) privacy\nleaks and simultaneously strengthening security against run-\ntime attacks on iOS. They present the design and implemen-\ntation of PSiOS, a tool that features a novel policy\nenforcement framework for iOS.\nLi et al. (2013) identified a number of issues using a\nstraightforward approach of checking BYOD smartphones\nperiodically to prevent security breaches. These issues\ninclude the following: running constantly scanning anti-\nmalware software on smartphones is power consuming and\nchecking all the smartphones is inconvenient for both the\nemployees and the employer. They propose a carefully\nplanned but otherwise random sampling approach called\nstrategic sampling to address these problems. The contribu-\ntions of their work are three-fold. They identify threats to\nenterprise network security based on the unique characteris-\ntics of smartphones, introduce a method to measure smart-\nphone security representative in an enterprise network based\non the owner's interests and the co-location logs, and pro-\npose to use strategic sampling (probability of use derived\nfrom a lottery tree that reflects the smartphones' representa-\ntiveness) to address the BYOD smartphone security prob-\nlem, which balances security responsiveness and cost\neffectiveness. The work of Jaramillo, Newhook, and Smart\n(2013) is also related to mobile device security in BYOD.\nTheir work discusses a framework that unifies numerous het-\nerogeneous devices and their software ecosystems into a\nsingle flexible platform for enterprise device management\nand message dissemination. This framework provides a\nfoundation that considers the myriad security, connectivity,\nand energy implications that are far different from those in a\nclassical enterprise system.\nTitze, Stephanow, and Schutte (2013) presented an exten-\nsible framework that allows companies to run automated\nsecurity checks tailored to their specific security require-\nments independent of application markets. Their framework\norchestrates different plug-in security services for checking\nmobile devices for malware, misbehaving applications, and\nconfigurations. In contrast to existing approaches, security\nservices with the framework are exchangeable and can be\nconfigured according to user-specific security requirements\nrity framework for mobile devices that ensures that only\napplications that comply with the organization security pol-\nicy are installed on the registered devices. Their framework\nconsists of a security policy manager that mediates access to\nthe application store and an installer application that tells the\nuser which applications can be safely installed. This is done\nby inferring behavioral models from applications and by\nvalidating them against a security policy. Zhao and Osorio\n(2012) presented a new mechanism to prevent the use of\nsmartphones for information leaking in corporate networks\nthrough the use of static analysis taint tracking. This mecha-\nnism is called \"TrustDroidTM.\" TrustDroidTM is a static ana-\nlyzer based on taint tracking that can be used to prevent\nleakage of sensitive information by an un-trusted Android\nsmartphone. TrustDroidTM will perform static analysis to\ndetermine if there is leakage of sensitive information, and if\nthe possibility of leakage exists, a warning of information\nleakage is delivered to the user of the device. Kodeswaran,\n6 SAGE Open\nFigure 3. Percentage of article obtained from different domains\nof literature.\nChakraborty, Sharma, Mukherjea, and Joshi (2013) described\na system that leverages sensors available on the phone as\nwell as on the enterprise infrastructure to identify business\ndata resident on the phone for further secure handling. They\nproposed a distributed architecture that leverages the context\nof the user for speculatively distinguishing enterprise data\nfrom personal data. The goal is to understand whether a user\nis engaged in enterprise or personal work by inferring her\ncontext from a combination of phone and infrastructure\nsensors.\nKim, Gong, Park, and Park (2013) in their work selected\nmajor domestic and external websites that provide cloud,\nVoIP, messenger, and email services and examined whether\ndata are encrypted or not for constructing a safe smart work\ninfrastructure. Wire shark was used as the inspection tool in\nboth wired/wireless environment, and they verified that both\nwired and wireless environments had a very high encryption\nrate of identity or passwords (average encryption rate =\n85.5%), but that the encryption rate of data was relatively\nlow (average encryption rate = 27.8%). To mitigate the prob-\nlem of security in the BYOD environment, Chung, Chung,\nEscrig, Bai, and Endicott-Popovsky (2012) proposed a novel\ndistributed access control architecture called 2-Tier Access\nControl (2TAC), which uses a double-layer access control\nalong with device security profiles, anti-virus or malware\nscanners, and social networking. 2TAC architecture consists\nof two individual and contained layers of security. A device\ncontrol tier is located on the device, and a cloud control tier\nis located in the cloud. Peng, Li, Han, Zou, and Wu (2013)\nbelieved that many existing BYOD security practices are\ncostly to implement and intrusive to employees, which to\nsome degree negates BYOD's perceived benefits. To address\nthis problem, they proposed prioritized defense deployment.\nA concept and a distributed algorithm both named\nT-dominance were proposed to capture the temporal-spatial\npattern in an enterprise environment. They identified a few\ndesirable properties of prioritized defense deployment and\nanalytically showed that T-dominance satisfied such\nproperties.\nKerravala (2012) claimed that BYOD requires new net-\nwork strategies. In this article, technical reasons why new\nnetwork strategies should be the way forward for BYOD\nwere identified. The challenges with current network archi-\ntecture were mentioned vis-\u00e0-vis proposed changes to net-\nwork architecture. Scarfo (2012) presented a brief survey\nabout the emerging methods and models to approach the\nBYOD phenomenon from the security point of view. The\nsecurity models around BYOD summarized in the brief sur-\nvey come from two opposite approaches: hand-off devices\nversus hand-on devices (Scarfo, 2012). Copeland and Crespi\n(2012) proposed a method of translating enterprise business\nobjectives into service delivery policy rules in mobile broad-\nband networks. This proposition enables the enterprise to\ncontrol their own session policies for BYOD user and apply\nselective funding with prioritized service delivery. The\nproposed Enterprise Business Context (eBC) policy process\nuses internal corporate data to define session context attri-\nbutes, which are evaluated against business policies to pro-\nduce an eBC profile.\nThe appendix presents the summary of contributions in\nresearch, research area addressed, and author(s) of the\nresearch. It is important to note that this summary is a result\nof our search for only BYOD-related publications using dif-\nferent academic and professional journals such as the IEEE\nXplore digital library, Elsevier, Springer,ACM digital library\ndatabases, and Google Scholar index journals.\nReview Analysis and Discussion\nWith the prevalence of BYOD in both the developed and\nemerging economics, there is no denying that BYOD is here\nto stay. Gartner Inc. predicts that half of employers world-\nwide will stop providing devices by 2017 and require\nemployees to bring their own (Leavitt, 2013). However, as\nboth the employees and employers enjoy the benefits of\nBYOD, they must also worry about the security challenges\nof BYOD policy. To address this challenge, there is a need\nfor both academic researchers and information security pro-\nfessional to have a better understanding of both the theoreti-\ncal and security challenges facing BYOD. This article\nhowever presents theoretical background on and security\nchallenges of BYOD by reviewing different publications\nfrom different domains of literature.\nHowever, in searching for publications related to BYOD,\nwe used BYOD, BringYour Own Device, BYOD Challenges,\nBYOD threats, BYOD challenges, and BYOD security\nthreats as keywords and phrases for our search. After thor-\nough searching with these keywords and phrases, we were\nable to gather 51 publications related to BYOD. Figure 3\npresents the percentage of publications obtained from differ-\nent domains of literature including ACM digital library,\nElsevier, IEEE Xplore digital library, Springer, white paper/\nOlalere et al. 7\nsurveys from different IT vendors, and other Google Scholar\nindex journals.\nMeanwhile, for the purpose of analysis, we divided all\npapers into three categories. The first category is publications\nfrom academic researchers, the second category is publica-\ntions from information security experts, and the third cate-\ngory is white papers/surveys publications from different IT\nindustries. It is important to note that in all three categories,\nsecurity has been identified as the most significant challenge\nfacing BYOD, as seen in Figure 4. Meanwhile, not much has\nbeen done by academic researchers to address this security\nchallenge. Out of 15 publications that address security issues,\n9 publications address the data leakage problem, 3 publica-\ntions address security policy, 3 address malware, and none\naddress DDoSs. Considering the benefits and prevalence of\nBYOD in both the developed and emerging economies, it is\nexpected that many academic researchers will be interested in\nproviding solutions to the security challenge.\nConclusion\nWe present a broad view of BYOD policy by providing a theo-\nretical foundation, deployment level, benefits, challenges,\npossible security attacks, and work done by researchers on\nBYOD. We conduct an exhaustive review of the literature to\nidentify publications and their methodological approaches and\nto identify topic areas of BYOD research. Our review shows\nthat security-related challenges are the most significant chal-\nlenges facing BYOD. We believe this state-of-the-art review\non BYOD contributes to practice and research by providing\nresearchers with theoretical foundations and open issues in\nBYOD research. Our future work will focus on the design of a\nBYOD network access control system. We aim to design a\ntwo-layer access control system. The first layer will use a two-\nfactor authentication technique to address the problem of\nunauthorized access to enterprise resources. This layer will\nserve as the authentication layer for mobile devices in BYOD\nenvironment. The proposed two-factor authentication tech-\nnique will use knowledge-based and biometrics-based authen-\ntication techniques. The second layer will serve as a monitor\nfor mobile devices when connected to enterprise resources.\nThis layer will monitor behavior of mobile devices while con-\nnected to the enterprise network. The layer will be based on a\ntrust model and Fuzzy logic concepts. Our overall future net-\nwork access control system will enable enterprise network\nadministrators to remotely control and monitor mobile devices\nbefore and after connection to the enterprise network.\nFigure 4. Security as the top-most challenge for all categories of\npublications.\nAppendix\nSummary of Researchers' Contributions on BYOD.\nNo. Author(s) Research area addressed Contribution to knowledge\n1 Alharthy and Shawkat\nSecurity They designed and implemented a BYOD solution, which builds a\nsecurity strategy. The strategy focuses on providing almost all details\nabout the latest BYOD threats affecting the network and security\nrequirements to prevent these threats.\n2 Armando, Costa, and\nSecurity Their study proposed a security framework for mobile devices that\nensures that only applications complying with the organization's\nsecurity policy can be installed.

Their results verified that both wired and\nwireless environment had a very high encryption rate of identity or\npasswords (average encryption rate = 85.5%), but a relatively low\nencryption rate of data (average encryption rate = 27.8%).\n9 Kodeswaran,\nChakraborty, Sharma,\nMukherjea, and Joshi\nSecurity They proposed a distributed architecture that leverages the context\nof the user for speculatively identifying enterprise data from personal\ndata.\n10 Lee, Lee, and Kim (2013) Security They suggested WLSA (White-List Based Security Architecture) for\nbetter mobile office security and presented required procedures and\nthe analysis of the expected security enhancement.\n11 Li, Peng, Huang, and Zou\nSecurity They came up with a method called strategic sampling. This method\naddresses the problem of periodic security checking for all BYOD\nsmartphones. The study proposed a carefully planned but otherwise\nrandom sampling approach.\n12 Mahesh and Hooter\nSecurity Their study developed and presented an integrated user-owned\nmobile device policy that will address the security of a business\nnetwork.\n13 Peng, Li, Han, Zou, and\nSecurity The authors believed many current BYOD security practices are\ncostly to implement and intrusive to employees, which to some\ndegree, negates BYOD's perceived benefits. Their study proposed\na concept and a distributed algorithm both named T-dominance,\nto capture the temporal-spatial pattern in an enterprise\nenvironment.\n14 Titze, Stephanow, and\nSecurity They proposed a framework that allows companies to run automated\nsecurity checks, tailored to their specific security requirements\nand independent of app markets. According to the authors, the\nframework operates on a virtual replica, which is created from a\nphysical device, thereby allowing deeper inspection than the current\nstate-of-the-art solution.\n15 Werthmann, Hund, and\nSecurity Their study addressed the open problem of preventing (not only\ndetecting) privacy leaks and simultaneously strengthening security\nagainst runtime attacks on iOS. Design and implementation of PSiOS,\na tool that features a novel policy enforcement framework for iOS,\nwas presented.\n16 Yang, Vlas, Yang, and\nDeployment issues Their study proposed the Risk Management Quintet as a model for\nunderstanding the BYOD practice. The relationships between the\ncomponents of the Quintet, that is, technology adoption, control,\nliabilities, user perception, and user behavior, were also examined in\nthe context of control mechanisms.\n(continued)\nAppendix(continued)\nOlalere et al. 9\nNo. Author(s) Research area addressed Contribution to knowledge\n17 Bj\u00f6rn et al.

The\nauthor recommended the following for next-generation Wireless\nLocal Area Network (WLAN) strategy: IT leaders need to have a\nlaser focus on user experience, embrace consumer technologies and\nBYOD, and be willing to accept change and develop new strategic\nrelationships.\n21 Scarfo' (2012) Security The work presented a brief survey about the emerging methods and\nmodels to approach the BYOD phenomenon from the security point\nof view.\nlevel\nThe study involved a survey that determined the level of deployment\nof BYOD in different sectors and industries. The study also depicted\nthe different threats that affected BYOD policy. The survey showed\nthat the application of BYOD policy would be lucrative for different\ntypes of organizations.\n23 Zhao and Osorio (2012) Security The paper presented a mechanism called \"TrustDroidTM,\" which is\na static analyzer that utilizes taint tracking to prevent leakage of\nsensitive information by an un-trusted Android Smartphone.\nNote.
