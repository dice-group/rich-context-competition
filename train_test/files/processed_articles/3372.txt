One such significant form of arrangement is\nbilateral investment treaties (BITs). As sizeable cost and resources are involved in treaty\nformation, it becomes important to examine the potential benefits of BITs for investment\nand whether such measures actually translate into higher FDI flows.\nThis article employs panel data regression on an augmented gravity model (under both\nstatic and dynamic conditions) to identify the determinants of FDI inflows into India with a\nspecial focus on the role of BITs. The panel data span over the period 2001\u00ad2012 and include\nthe top investing countries in India accounting for around 92 per cent of India's total FDI\ninflows. The explanatory variables employed are extended market size, vertical FDI drive,\ndistance, colonial links, common language, political stability, financial openness, and popu-\nlation growth rate. BIT is incorporated as a dummy variable which takes the value 1 if a BIT\nexists between India and the investing countries in a given year, otherwise 0.\nThe results for both the fixed effects and the two-step generalized method of moments\n(GMM) model specifications confirm the positive role of BITs in attracting FDI inflows\ninto India. BITs have contributed to rising FDI inflows by providing protection and\ncommitment to foreign investors contemplating investment in India. The model also\nfinds support for other factors facilitating FDI such as the large size of the economy and\na more liberal FDI regime.\nAs attracting FDI is an important policy objective of developing countries like India, the\nresults imply that one of the instruments of achieving this objective is for the govern-\nment to negotiate BITs with countries which are prospective investors. By laying down\nclear guidelines with respect to investment and widening the scope of investment activ-\nities covered under a bilateral agreement, an environment of certainty is created which\nwould facilitate FDI flows.\nVIKALPA\nThe Journal for Decision Makers\nManagement, Ahmedabad\nSAGE Publications\nsagepub.in/home.nav\nhttp://vik.sagepub.com\nExecutive\nSummary\nThe last three decades have been marked by a\ntremendous growth of international investments\nand trade along with the integration and open-\nness of international markets. This has led to intense\ncompetition among countries, particularly the devel-\noping ones, to attract FDI so as to boost their domestic\nrates of investment and accelerate economic develop-\nment. FDI flows are usually preferred over other forms\nof external finance because they are non-debt creating,\nless volatile, and facilitate transfer of knowledge, skills,\nIn view of the catalytic role of FDI in promoting\neconomic development, countries adopt various unilat-\neral as well as bilateral measures to create a conducive\nenvironment for FDI. The bilateral measures include,\ninter alia, double taxation avoidance agreements and\nBITs. The focus of this article is on BITs which are\nagreements that establish the terms and conditions\nfor FDI in a country. According to UNCTAD, `Bilat-\neral investment treaties are agreements between two\ncountries for reciprocal encouragement, promotion\nand protection of investment in each other's territo-\nries by companies based in either country' (UNCTAD,\nbeen negotiated across the world, of which 2,225 are in\nforce (UNCTAD, n.d.). The scope and depth of BITs are\nexpanding in terms of intra-regional and inter-regional\ncoverage, which, in turn, is expected to strengthen the\nflow of investment among economies. Most of the BITs\ncontain provisions for investment covering establish-\nment clauses, legal provisions, tax norms, dispute reso-\nlution procedures, administrative specifications, and\nother related protocols. They also promote equal treat-\nment towards domestic as well as foreign investors.\nSuch arrangements create an environment of certainty\nfor the foreign investors and, hence, are perceived as\ninvestment-friendly. At the same time, it needs to be\nnoted that treaty formation involves sizeable costs and\nresources of the governments. In the light of above, it\nbecomes important to examine the potential benefits of\nBITs for investment and whether such measures actu-\nally translate into higher FDI flows.\nThe literature review presented further shows that of\nthe existing studies that cover the impact of BITs on\nFDI flows into developing countries, there are very\nfew country-based studies. An aggregative study may\nnot be able to account for the peculiarities of a country\nwhich, in turn, could define the objective of BITs. For\ninstance, for a country that has started liberalizing, a\nBIT may hold more importance as it could attract more\ninvestment partners. In comparison, countries that have\nalready been attracting foreign investment for a long\nperiod could enter into BITs to facilitate flows from their\nexisting partners. We focus on the case of India as it is one\nof the top prospective destinations for FDI (UNCTAD,\n2014a) and also because it has been a part of the growing\ntrend of negotiating BITs to facilitate cross-border invest-\nment flow. India has been progressively liberalizing its\nFDI policy since 1991, which has resulted in an upward\nsurge in FDI inflows. FDI inflows in India in the early\n1990 were less than USD 1 billion and were more than\npromote FDI inflows, India has entered into a number of\narrangements with other countries such as double taxa-\ntion avoidance agreements, free trade agreements, and\nBITs. A number of studies have looked at the impact of\nthese diverse arrangements on India's trade and FDI. For\ninstance, Murthy and Bhasin (2015) captured the impact\nof one form of bilateral arrangement, that is, bilateral\ntaxation treaties, on India's FDI inflows. Another set of\nstudies examined the impact of globalization and trade\nagreements on India's trade (Bhasin & Manocha, 2014;\nSrinivasan & Archana, 2009). However, the literature on\nthe impact of BITs on FDI flows into India is relatively\nsparse. We, therefore, attempt to understand the deter-\nminants of India's FDI inflows with a special focus on\nthe role of BITs of India.\nIndia has been actively negotiating BITs since liberali-\nzation to intensify cross-border flows of investment. It\nwere 69 BITs in force out of the 84 negotiated (UNCTAD,\nn.d.). An upward trend in BITs for India can be seen in\nFigure 1. In developing countries like India, investment\ntreaties are considered as a commitment to protect\ninvestors and to provide them with a more certain,\npredictable, and supportive environment. Investors\ncontemplating FDIs require better institutional quality,\nsupportive policies, and reduced restrictions on entry\nand operation. A comparison of FDI trends along with\ntrends in BITs shows that along with an upward trend\nin BITs, India has also experienced a surge in the total\nFDI inflows in the last two decades (Figure 1). Post-\nliberalization, India is constantly working towards\nestablishing a conducive environment for FDI, and BITs\nare a significant step in this direction.\nTable 1 brings out the importance of treaty partners as\nsource countries for India's FDI flows. Of the total FDI\nBIT partners and the percentage increased to 81.4 per\ncent in 2012. Further, the number of BITs negotiated has\nthe propensity to sign BITs has increased along with the\nproportion of FDI received from treaty partners.\nTable 1: India's FDI Inflow (in Million USD)\nNo. of BITs negotiated and in force 32 68\nPercentage of FDI inflow from\ninvestment treaty partners\nSource: Based on data collected from International Investment\nPolicy Hub, UNCTAD, for BITs of India and from UNCTAD investment\nTable 2 shows the geographic coverage of India's BITs.\nRegion-wise distribution indicates that most of India's\nBITs are with Asian and European economies. This\ncould possibly be due to geographical proximity as\nwell as the fact that many of these countries have been\ntraditional trade and investment partners of India.\nTable 2: Region-wise Distribution of India's BITs (as on 31\nRegion No. of BITs (in Force)\nSouth America 2\nNorth America 1\nAustralia 1\nCentral America 1\nSource: Based on data collected from International Investment\nPolicy Hub, UNCTAD, for BITs of India.\n,\nFigure 1: Trends in India's BITs Negotiated (and in Force) and Total FDI Inflows (1995\u00ad2011)\nSource: Based on the data collected from International Investment Policy Hub, UNCTAD, for BITs of India and from UNCTAD investment report\nWe look at some of the recent literature capturing the\nrelationship between investment treaties and invest-\nment flows. While some studies estimated a positive\nassociation between BITs and FDI flows, others did\nnot come up with such encouraging results. Studies\nby Hallward-Driemeier (2003) and Tobin and Rose-\nAckerman (2004) found a negative relationship\nbetween FDI and BITs. Hallward-Driemeier (2003)\nanalyzed the impact of BITs using bilateral FDI flows\nfrom 20 OECD countries to 31 developing countries\nand found that BITs did not serve to attract addi-\ntional FDI. Tobin and Rose-Ackerman (2003) found\nthe number of BITs having little impact on a coun-\ntry's ability to attract FDI. However, there appears to\nbe an interaction between the conclusion of BITs, on\nthe one hand, and the level of political risk and prop-\nerty rights protection, on the other. Countries that are\nrelatively risky seem to be able to attract somewhat\nmore FDI by signing BITs. Mina (2010), using the\nGMM estimation methodology, found that domestic\nproperty rights protection institutions, as opposed to\nBITs, mattered more for OECD investors with invest-\nment coming from higher income, middle income,\nand lower income economies. Banga (2003) estimated\nthe impact of the total number of signed BITs on FDI\ninflows for 15 developing economies of South Asia,\nEast Asia, and Southeast Asia. The study found that\nBITs with developing countries did not have a signif-\nicant impact on aggregate FDI inflows but those\nwith developed countries had a significant impact\non FDI inflows. The author attributed such result to\nlarge aggregate FDI flows from developed economies\nin the sample covered.\nA number of studies on developed countries found\nBITs to support FDI inflows (Bae & Keum, 2013;\nbilateral outward FDI stock data from 19 OECD\nhome countries and 57 host countries (including 27\nOECD member countries) to show that BITs exerted\na positive and significant effect on outward FDI of\nhome countries in BITs partner host countries, if\nthe treaties were implemented. Grosse and Trevino\ncountries of Central and Eastern Europe during\nBITs (together with other institutional improve-\nments) as an assurance of equal treatment of foreign\nand domestic investors. Guerin (2011) concluded that\nBITs encouraged EU FDI outflows up to 35 per cent\nwith a partner developing economy. Bae and Keum\n(2013), covering Korean investment, found BITs\nsignificant and positive for outward FDI but negative\nand insignificant for inward FDI. Cardamone and\nScoppola (2012) assessed the impact of trade policies\non the outward stocks of FDI of the EU using a model\nbased on the knowledge-capital theory of multina-\nresults showed that BITs in force had a significant\nand positive impact on the outward FDI. Neumayer\nand Spess (2005) found that larger the number of\nBITs negotiated, better was the flow of FDI inflows\nto the developing countries. The results of studies\nfocusing on developing countries are mixed. Busse,\nKoniger, and Nunnemkamp (2008) showed that BITs\ndid promote FDI flows to developing countries and\nthat they could also substitute weak domestic insti-\ntutions. B\u00fcthe and Milner (2004) hypothesized that\nthe greater the number of BITs to which a developing\ncountry was a party, the more attractive it was as an\ninvestment location. Pradhan (2011) traced the origin\nand growth of outward FDI by emerging Chinese\nand Indian multinationals and examined the loca-\ntional determinants of such investments. He found\nthat while Chinese multinationals had preference for\nhosts with locational proximity, small size, and high\nnatural resource endowments, Indian firms appeared\nto choose countries with large size and those that\nhad a BIT with India irrespective of their physical\ndistance from India.\nAs is evident from the literature review, a number of\nstudies provide support for the formation of BITs and\ntheir impact on FDI. However, as mentioned before,\nBITs can have differing impact on different countries\ndepending on the stage of development, liberalization\npolicies, etc. The importance of India as an investment\ndestination has already been brought out earlier, and\ntherefore, an examination of the factors responsible for\nthis trend is warranted. In the light of this, we iden-\ntify the determinants of India's FDI flows with a special\nfocus on the role of BITs. Table 3 presents a summary of\nthe literature on the impact of BITs on FDI.\nWeemploypaneldataregressiononanextendedgravity\nmodel to identify the determinants of FDI inflows into\nIndia with special focus on BITs. The basic gravity\nmodel was proposed by Tinbergen (1962) to explain\ninternational bilateral trade. In the literature, studies\nexamining bilateral trade and investment patterns\nhave intensively used this model. Foreign investment\ncaters largely to two distinct domains, namely, expan-\nsion of market size (horizontal motives) and easing of\nproduction processes using cheaper labour (vertical\nmotive). Carr, Markusen, and Maskus (2001) captured\nthe extended gravity model for investment explaining\nboth horizontal motivation and vertical dimensions of\nFDI. We study the layout of the gravity model for FDI\ncapturing both horizontal and vertical aspects adapting\nthe knowledge-capital model (Carr, Markusen, &\nMaskus, 2001). To encompass the horizontal dimen-\nsion, the study uses the market size as an aggregate of\nthe GDP of both the trading economies. To examine the\nvertical motives (or factor endowment), we calculate\nthe difference in the GDP per capita of both the trading\npartners. So, we use the extended gravity-knowledge\ncapital model (also known as the CMM model) to\nexamine the determinants of FDI inflows.\nSample Period and Coverage\nto capture the impact of BITs on India's FDI inflows.\nThe countries covered are Japan, Italy, Singapore, Hong\nKong, Germany, France, Cyprus, the USA, the UK, the\nUAE, Switzerland, Spain, the Netherlands, Mauritius,\nLuxembourg, and the Republic of Korea. In 2012, these\ncountries accounted for 92 per cent (approximately)1\nof India's total FDI inflows and are even today the top\ninvesting countries in India. However, all the economies\ncovered as a part of the sample do not have BITs with\nIndia. Japan, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Singapore, and\nthe USA have no BIT negotiated with India till date,\nand although an investment treaty was negotiated with\nthe UAE in 2013, it did not come into force. All the other\neconomies in the sample are treaty partners of India\nand had treaties negotiated (and in force) before 2012\n(see Table A1 for country-wise year of negotiation).\nTable A1: Country-wise Year of BIT Negotiated\nCountry Date of Entry*\nHong Kong No treaty till date\nJapan No treaty till date\nTable 3: Select Literature on the Impact of BITs on FDI\nAuthor/s Sample Period and Coverage Model Specification Findings\nB\u00fcthe and Milner\ndeveloping countries are party\nFixed effects model specification Greater the number of BITs to which the developing\ncountry is a party, more will be the FDI received.\nGrosse and Trevino\nand Eastern European region\nRegression analysis BITs along with institutional improvements provide\nan assurance of equal treatment to both domestic\nas well as foreign investor.\nCooperation Countries (GCC) which\nnegotiate BITs\nGMM estimation Domestic property rights protection institutions\nmatter more, as opposed to BITs.\nNeumayer and Spess\ncountries\nFixed effects and random effects Larger the number of BITs negotiated, better is the\nflow of FDI inflows into the developing countries.\npartner economy.\nCardamone and\nfor EU\nKnowledge-capital theory of MBC The results show that the pattern of the outward\nFDI is a mix of vertical and horizontal FDI.\nHallward-Driemeier\ncountries into 31 developing\ncountries\nRegression Conclude that BITs do not serve to attract\nadditional FDI.\nSoutheast, East and South Asian\neconomies\nRandom effects BITs with developing countries do not show a\nsignificant impact on aggregate FDI inflows but\nBITs with developed countries had a significant\nimpact on FDI inflows.\nSource: Author's own compilation.\n(Table A1 continued)\nLuxembourg No treaty till date\nSingapore No treaty till date\nThe United Arab Emirates Negotiated in 2013 (not in\nforce)\nThe United States No treaty till date\nSource: UNCTAD Investment Policy Hub.\nNote: *It indicates the date when the treaty came into force.\nData Sources\nThe data on India's FDI inflows from a trading partner\nwere obtained from the UNCTAD database (UNCTAD,\n2014b). For independent variables, the GDP, the GDP\nper capita, inflation (measured as consumer price\nindex), and the official exchange rate were taken\nfrom the World Bank database. With respect to other\nexplanatory variables, political constraint index data\nwere collected from the Political Constraint Index\nDataset (POLCON) Macro Data Guide (NSD, 2011).\nThe data for BITs negotiated by India were gathered\nfrom Investment Policy Hub, UNCTAD (n.d.). The data\nfor the distance between the capitals of both the coun-\ntries were taken from CEPII (French Research Centre\nModel Specification\nThe majority of the empirical work on the gravity\nmodel for investment have either used FDI flows\nor FDI stock as a dependent variable. Since we are\nusing the panel data with different source coun-\ntries, it would be more appropriate to use FDI flows\nbecause the calculation of FDI stock would be heter-\nogeneous across countries (Globerman & Shapiro,\n2002). Moreover, data for India's FDI stock from its\ninvesting partners are available only for a very short\nFDI inflows as the dependent variable.\nWe use a double log model for panel data regres-\nsion to analyse the determinants of FDI inflows\nbetween India and its investing partner. As the data\nfigures for some of the years are zero, we follow the\nprotocol of expressing the dependent variable as\nlog(1 + FDI) in order to accommodate zero observa-\n& Duade, 2007). The basic regression equation used\nin the study is as follows:\nln(1 + FDI\nijt\n) =  + \nln(GDP\nit\njt\n) + \n ln GDPpc\nit\n- GDPpc\njt\n+ \njt\n+ \nijt\n+ \nlnFOpen\njt\n+ \nBIT\nijt\n+ \nComCol\nijt\n+ \nLANG\nijt\n+ \nPOLCON\nijt\n+\nijt\nIn order to take care of the dynamics in the equation,\nthe study also incorporates lagged FDI as one of the\nexplanatory variables (Egger & Merlo, 2007; Mina,\n2010). For dynamic adjustment, the equation is then\nwritten as\nln(1 + FDI\nijt\n) =  +  (1 + FDI\n) + \nln (GDP\nit\njt\n)\n+ \n lnGDPpc\nit\n- GDPpc\njt\n + \njt\n+ \nln\nDIS\nijt\n+ \nln FOpen\njt\n+ \nBIT\nijt\n+ \nComCol\nijt\n+ \nLANG\nijt\n+ \nPOLCON\nijt\n\nijt\n,\nwhere\nFDI\nijt\nis FDI inflows from the home country i to the host\ncountry j (India) for year t,\nFDI\nis one year lag of FDI inflows from the home\ncountry i to the host country j (India) for the year t,\nGDP\nit\nis the nominal GDP of the home country i,\nGDP\njt\nis the nominal GDP of the host country j (India),\nit\nis the per capita GDP of the home country i,\njt\nis the per capita GDP of host country j (India),\nDIS\nijt\nis the distance between the home and the host\ncountry (India),\nComCol\nijt\nis the colonial links between India and the\nhome country,\nLANG\nijt\nis the linguistic proximity between the home\nand the host (India) countries,\nPOPGROWTH\njt\nis the population growth rate of the\nhost country j (India),\nFDIopen\njt\nis the financial openness of the host country\nj (India),\n(Table A1 continued)\nPOLCON\njt\nis the political constraints index of the host\ncountry j (India),\nBIT\nij\nis a dummy variable taking value 1, if the coun-\ntries i and j have a BIT in the given year t, otherwise 0,\ni is the home country, j is the host country (India), t is\nthe time indicator, and  is the error term.\nWhile some studies used the GDP per capita of the\nhost country to measure the market size (Anwar &\nthe sum of the GDP of both the investing partner\ncountries in order to capture the market size (Resmini\n& Siedschlag, 2008). We take the sum of gross domestic\nproduct of both the economies to capture the horizontal\nor extended market size. The coverage of the vari-\nable is similar to the variables examined by Park and\nis expected to be positive in case the host economy\nacts as an extended market for the home economy\nattracting horizontal FDI.\nThe absolute difference between the GDP per capita of\nthe home and the host (India) countries captures the\nvertical FDI drive. Jang (2011) captured the difference\nbetween the GDP per capita of the home and the host\neconomies to measure the relative skill difference. The\ninflow of FDI is not only affected by the wage struc-\nture of the manufacturing sector but is also directly\nor indirectly magnified by the payment to be done to\nthe non-manufacturing (service sector) related regime;\ntherefore, the GDP per capita differential is incorpo-\nrated as a measure of skill differential. The variable is\nexpected to be positive if India is able to attract FDI\ndue to relative factor endowment. The coefficient of the\nvariable would depend on the extent to which India is\nable to encourage (discourage) the inward flow of FDI.\nDistance between the home and the host explains\nwhether the geographical proximity between both the\ncountries is attracting FDI or not. In studies covering\ntrade as a dependent variable, distance is associated\nwith the transportation cost. However, in the case of\nFDI as a dependent variable, the impact of distance\nwill vary depending upon the type of FDI (Egger,\nto achieve production efficiency (vertical FDI), then\nlesser the distance more is the flow of investment. For\nmarket expansion (horizontal FDI), larger distance will\npromote investment in the destination economy. The\ntendency to capture the market by enhancing trade\nincreases with lesser distance. Therefore, the impact\nof the variable is ambiguous. In order to measure the\nimpact of cultural distance between the home and the\nhost countries, the study incorporates two more invar-\niant variables along with distance, namely, common\ncolonial linkage and common language.\nCommon colonial link (ComCol) is incorporated as a\ndummy variable which takes the value 1 if both the econ-\nomies share a colonial heritage, otherwise 0. Countries\nwith similar colonial links tend to have some historical\nassociation which can positively affect FDI. Common\nLanguage (LANG) has been included to examine whether\ncountries that share a linguistic proximity tend to be\nbetter investing partners. The study incorporates the\nvariable as a dummy variable with value 1 in case both\nthe economies share a common language, otherwise 0.\nPolitical constraints measure whether the political struc-\nture and the related policies of India support FDI\ninflows to India. The study incorporates the POLCON\nproduced by Henisz (NSD, 2011), which measures the\npolitical constraints by identifying the underlying polit-\nical structures and the measures that support credible\npolicy commitments. This dataset developed by Henisz\ntive, executive, and judicial offshoots of a government\nset-up. The study used the index to measure whether\nthe Indian political structure and constraints were\nsupporting inflows in India. The impact of the variable\nis ambiguous and depends upon the strength of the\npolitical set-up. In order to capture the impact of the\npopulation growth rate on FDI inflows, we incorporate\nthe population growth rate of the host country (India) and\nstudy the impact of extension on the size of the market.\nThe variable measures the impact of the growth in the\nphysical size of the economy (market) on the invest-\nment inflows. An economy with growing physical size\ngenerally indicates an extension of labour as well as\nconsumer market. Though some studies (e.g., Akin,\n2009) had found population growth to not promote\nFDI, we expect the variable to be significant and posi-\ntive for a labour-intensive economy like India.\nFinancial openness of the host country is incorporated to\nmeasure the impact of India's investment policies on\nFDI inflows. The variable is calculated as the sum of\nFDI inflows and FDI outflows as a percentage of the\nGDP in the study. The variable is expected to have a\npositive impact on India's FDI inflows.\nThe variable of our interest, BIT, is incorporated as a\ndummy variable. The value of the variable is taken as\n1 in case a BIT exists between India and the investing\ncountries in the given year; otherwise, it is 0. The vari-\nable is used to capture the impact of BITs on India's FDI\ninflows and is expected to have a positive sign.\nStudies covering the panel data regression model\nhave intensively used the static model (fixed effects\nor random effects) specifications. A fixed effects (FE)\nmodel specification is incorporated in the studies where\nthe individual and/or time-specific effects are corre-\nlated with the explanatory variable. Moreover, each\ncross-sectional entity is recognized with some specific\nattributes of its own. Baltagi (2001) referred the fixed\neffects model to be suitable for specifications where the\nstudy focuses on a specific set of entities (an individual,\na country or firms) and the inference is restricted to\nthe set of such entities. The random effects model is\nmore appropriate when inferences are based on enti-\nties (individuals) randomly drawn from a large sample.\nMundlak (1978) argued that the random effects model\nassumed exogeneity for all explanatory variables with\nthe random individual effects, whereas the fixed effects\nmodel allowed for endogeneity of all explanatory varia-\nbles with individual effects. Therefore, it is basically the\nselection of all or none of the regressors for endogeneity\nand individual effects. The Hausman test is generally\napplied to choose between random and fixed effect esti-\nmations. The impact of the explanatory variables was\nexamined using both fixed effects as well as random\neffects specifications. The results of the Hausman test\nsupported the use of fixed effects (Table A1). Therefore,\nthe results were analysed using fixed effects and results\nfor time invariant variables were captured from the\nrandom effects specifications.\nIn order to account for the presence of endogeneity\nemerging from a reverse causality association between\nFDI flows and BIT (countries exchanging notable FDI\nmaytendtonegotiateBITandcountrieswithinvestment\ntreaties may experience higher flows of FDI), we also\nemploy dynamic panel regression, the GMM, proposed\nby Arellano and Bond (1991) with one year lag along\nwith random/fixed effects specifications. Anwar and\nCooray (2015) also examined the explanatory variables\nusing the GMM along with panel fixed effects in order\nto empirically estimate the impact of financial flows\non the per capita income of low- and middle-income-\ngroup economies. In this study, the GMM model was\nfound suitable mainly due to the presence of heteroske-\ndasticity and autocorrelation (Table A2). Moreover, the\ntime period (T) of the study was small and the number\nof countries (N) examined was large. The GMM uses\nthe lag of a dependent variable as one of the explana-\ntory variables in order to capture the impact of the one\nyear lag of FDI inflows on the dependent variable and\nalso to control the dynamics in the equation. But, the\nGMM given by Arellano and Bond (1991) incorporated\nfixed effect only because the model was fitted using\nfirst differences, and the time invariant got omitted in\nthe equation with first differences. The inflow of FDI is\naffected by the FDI flows in the previous year(s) and,\nthus, may cast a significant and positive impact on the\nFDI flow in the current year. We performed the Sargan\ntest to establish the validity of the instruments covered\nin the study. Due to the presence of heteroskedasticity,\nwe had to reject the null hypothesis for the one-step\nGMM under the Sargan test (Table A3). However, the\nestimates for the one-step GMM are consistent and\nsignificant as for the present study, T (time period) < N\n(number of countries). The study also estimates the\nexplanatory variables using the two-step GMM model\n(the Sargan test for the two-step GMM supports the use\nof instruments for examining the explanatory varia-\nbles) with one year lag.\nTable A2: Results of Heteroscedasticity and Autocorrelation for\nPanel Data\nH\n: Homoscedasticity\nWooldridge test for autocorrelation in panel data\nH\n: no first-order............... autocorrelation\nhttp://investmentpolicyhub.unctad.org/IIA\nTable A3: Results of the Sargan Test for the One-step GMM\n|Order | z Prob > z|\nH\n: No autocorrelation\n(Table A3 continued)\nSargan test of over-identifying restrictions for one-step GMM\nH\n: over-identifying restrictions are valid\nSource: Authors' calculation.\nThe descriptive statistics of the variables have been\nsummarized in Table A4a. Before starting the regres-\nsion, we check for multicollinearity among explanatory\nvariables (Table A4b). None of the explanatory varia-\nbles are found to be highly correlated. The results of\nthe Sargan test for the two-step GMM are encouraging\nand suggest that residuals of first differences are not\ncorrelated with the instruments. The results for serial\ncorrelation indicate that first-order serial correlation is\nmarginally significant at the 10 per cent level, but the\noutcome for second-order serial correlation exhibits no\nserial correlation for the error term.\nThe results for the model using random effects, fixed\neffects, and GMM specifications for a period of 12 years\ninflows, are depicted in Table 4. The Hausman test\nsupports the use of fixed effects (Table 4). Therefore, the\nresults for fixed effects along with GMM specifications\nare found to be more suitable for interpretation.\nTable 4: Panel Regression Results with FDI Inflows of India as a Dependent Variable\nRandom Effects Fixed Effects GMM Two-steps\nCoef.

With its large market\nsize, India is seen as a captive destination for market-\nseeking FDI. The variable population growth (POPGR)\nis found to be positive and significant (only for fixed\neffects specifications), indicating that the expanding\neconomic market of India is supporting FDI. The differ-\nence between the GDP per capita of both the economies\nshows a negative coefficient. This implies that India\nas a host economy for vertical integration is not able\nto attract enough FDI. A possible reason for this result\ncould be that labour cost differentials are not supported\nby other factors which are instrumental in driving\ninvestment decisions such as the quality of supporting\ninfrastructure and institutions. Further, differences\nin wage levels may not be compensated for by differ-\nences in productivity which might contribute to a nega-\ntive sign for the differential GDP per capita of both the\nThe coefficients for all the three time invariant variables,\nnamely, distance, common language, and common colo-\nnial links, are found to be insignificant using random\nmodel specifications. The variable capturing political\nconstraints is found to be negative but insignificant. This\nimplies that an unstable political environment which is\nnot investor-friendly discourages FDI inflows to India,\nthough not significantly. The variable FDI openness\nis found to be positive and significant, indicating that\nIndia is able to attract more FDI with better and liberal\neconomic policies towards investment. The variable of\nour interest, BIT, is found to be significant and positive,\nimplying that BITs are facilitating and promoting FDI\ninflows to India. Thus, a developing economy like India\ncan capture and magnify the FDI inflows by entering\ninto investment associations with prospective investing\neconomies. BITs are providing a certain, predictable and\ninvestor-friendly environment to multinational firms\ncontemplating investment in India, thereby positively\ninfluencing their decision to invest here.\nThe lag of FDI is found to be positive and significant.\nThis indicates that previous years' investment trends, if\nhigh, encourage investors to invest funds in subsequent\nyears. The lag of FDI is indicative of the existing invest-\nment environment in India for the current investment.\nThe results for the fixed effects and the GMM model\nspecifications are more or less similar. These results\nconfirm our expectations and reinforce the positive\nrole of BITs in facilitating foreign investment. For\ndeveloping countries like India, such treaties play an\nimportant role in creating a conducive environment for\nforeign investment.\nCONCLUSION\nIndiahasbeenattractinglargeamountsofFDIeversince\nit liberalized in 1991. The liberalization regime has also\nseen India become a part of the growing trend of nego-\ntiating BITs with a number of its trade and investment\npartners. This article sought to examine whether BITs\nwere achieving the intended objective of higher FDI\ninflows to India. Using an augmented gravity model\nand estimating both under static and dynamic condi-\ntions, we find that BITs are playing their desired role\nin attracting FDI inflows into India. They have contrib-\nuted to rising FDI inflows by providing protection\nand commitment to foreign investors contemplating\ninvestment in India. The model also finds support\nfor other factors facilitating FDI such as the large size\nof the economy and a more liberal FDI regime. As\nattracting FDI is an important policy objective of devel-\noping countries like India, the results imply that one\nof the instruments of achieving this objective is for the\ngovernment to negotiate BITs with countries that are\nprospective investors. By laying down clear guidelines\nwith respect to investment and widening the scope of\ninvestment activities covered under a bilateral agree-\nment, an environment of certainty is created which\nwould facilitate FDI flows.\nREFERENCES\nAnwar, S., & Cooray, A.
