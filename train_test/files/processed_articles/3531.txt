    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe investigated the familiar phenomenon of the uncanny feeling that represented people in frontal\npose invariably appear to ``face you'' from wherever you stand. We deploy two different methods.\nThe stimuli include the conventional one--a flat portrait rocking back and forth about a vertical\naxis--augmented with two novel variations. In one alternative, the portrait frame rotates whereas\nthe actual portrait stays motionless and fronto-parallel; in the other, we replace the (flat!) portrait\nwith a volumetric object. These variations yield exactly the same optical stimulation in frontal view,\nbut become grossly different in very oblique views. We also let participants sample their\nmomentary awareness through ``gauge object'' settings in static displays. From our results, we\nconclude that the psychogenesis of visual awareness maintains a number--at least two, but most\nlikely more--of distinct spatial frameworks simultaneously involving ``cue\u00adscission.'' Cues may be\neffective in one of these spatial frameworks but ineffective or functionally different in other ones.\n",

Of course, they do nothing of the sort, not being\nreal persons at all, but eidola at best. The experience of ``following'' must be due to your own\npsychogenesis. Notice that there are two distinct aspects to ``following,'' namely that the\ndepicted person ``faces you'' and that the gaze of the depicted person is such that it appears to\nfixate you. A famous example is the wartime propaganda poster depicting Lord Kitchener\n(Figure 1).\nThere is some literature on the spooky effect (Boyarskaya & Hecht, 2012; Boyarskaya,\nSebastian, Bauermann, Hecht, & Tuscher, 2015; Busey, Brady, & Cutting, 1990; Todorovic,\n2006, 2009), but most of the marginally relevant literature has to do with the deformations\nexperienced when viewing a perspective rendering from the ``wrong'' vantage point (Cutting,\nYang & Kubovy, 1999). Some of the literature on the perception of gaze direction is also relevant\nportrayed person is certainly seen to be a mere object, perhaps a realistic ``portrait,'' but\ncertainly not ``flesh and blood,'' yet it appears miraculously animated. This puts it squarely at\nFigure 1. At left, Alfred Leete's (1882\u00ad1922) war propaganda poster featuring Lord Kitchener. The\nimpression that the spectator is ``directly addressed'' from any view point is considered ``spooky'' by many\nobservers. At right, Lord Kitchener is ``facing'' the spectator, being deprived of his gaze. Gazing and facing are\ndistinct things.\nIn two earlier studies (Koenderink, van Doorn, de Ridder, & Oomes, 2010; Koenderink\net al., 2004), we touched on the phenomenology. In the present study, we attempt to address\nthe issue in more detail, staying as close to the actual facts--which necessarily have to be\n``first person reports''--as possible. The results from the previous work are highly relevant to\nthe present work. Although we avoided phenomenological accounts, sticking to objective\nmethods, various apparent ``open ends'' in the present study were actually addressed in the\nprevious one. This includes variations of real (e.g., rotating the monitor) versus pictorially\nsimulated slant, and so forth. We can hardly summarize that here; the interested reader is\nreferred to the previous, very extensive work.\nAll of the authors are experienced visual observers. We agree largely on our visual\nawareness of the uncanny effect. Viewing a panel depicting a face staring at you directly,\nthe depicted person apparently keeps facing you no matter where you are with respect to that\npanel. This is the familiar Lord Kitchener, or often called (right or wrongly) the Mona Lisa\neffect. We also notice other visual facts that are less often mentioned. These were already\nnoted in our earlier work (Koenderink et al., 2004), but could not be addressed in detail there.\nThese facts appear to us important and deserving of empirical investigation:\nFirst, as the obliqueness of the view changes, the portrait does not seem to be rigidly\nconnected to the frame, as it physically is. That is to say, the pigments are rigidly\nconnected to the panel and thus to the frame, but the portrayed face appears to change\nshape whereas the frame does not. The frame is seen to change its spatial attitude, but it is\nalso seen as rigidly moving, whereas the face suffers a non-rigid deformation;\nSecond, the Euclidean normal to the panel and the facing direction apparently coincide when\nviewing the panel from the front, but these directions diverge from each other when the panel\nis viewed obliquely. This suggests that the panel and the face are experienced as existing in\nmutually distinct mental spatial frameworks. In the space of the panel, psychogenesis\n``corrects'' for the foreshortening, whereas in the space of the face, the foreshortening is\nsomehow experienced as a deformation. In oblique view, the face appears to grow\n``leaner.'' Thus, we experience a ``scission of cues.''\nThese effects can easily by verified by the reader by watching our video clips put on the\npublisher's site. Such observations are conceptually most intriguing. Does stereopsis from\nmonocular cues indeed simultaneously maintain distinct but intermeshed spatial frameworks?\nThis is the topic of the present investigation. We pursue it in a study including a fairly large\nnumber of nai\u00a8ve observers and smaller groups of experienced observers from the arts and the\nsciences.\nMethods\nWe performed two experiments (henceforth denoted ``Experiment I'' and ``Experiment\nII''). The presentations were rather different in each case: Experiment I involved several\nshort video clip presentations, each followed by a formal questionnaire, whereas\nExperiment II involved static presentations in which participants interacted with the\nstimulus through the adjustments of certain ``gauge objects'' (Koenderink, van Doorn,\nIn all cases, the screen subtends 32.7 by 20.1 of visual angle and is viewed from a distance\nof 57 cm. Observers view the screen binocularly from a fixed head position. They wear their\nusual optical correction when necessary. These are almost a requirement in the case of nai\u00a8ve\nobservers.\nKoenderink et al. 3\nThe room is darkened, so the main impression is that of the luminous display, although\nthere is sufficient scattered light in the room that the physical display monitor remains\nnoticeable, but only of subsidiary visual importance. The participants are familiar with the\nroom, have a haptic relation to their chair, and so forth.\nIn Experiment I, the screen was dark and video clips were presented at its center. The clips\nafter the presentation. The participant could proceed to a next phase of the experiment by\nhitting the space bar after reading a written cue.\nThe video clips show a frame with certain content, rotating back and forth about a vertical\naxis. The slant varies linearly back and forth between \u00c640 extremes with a period of about\n1.5 s. Observers are invited to watch the display and answer five simple questions immediately\nafterwards.\nThe decision to limit the range to \u00c640 was a difficult one. The major effects that we intend\nto address are much clearer for narrower ranges. In the generic Leete poster display, we see the\nframe rigidly rotate but the face deform in a fronto-parallel attitude if the obliqueness is less\nthan about 20, whereas for larger angles, the face both rotates and deforms. We only selected\nthe higher value because we intended to involve a large number of nai\u00a8ve observers. The angle\nwas limited to 40 because the effect disappears for very large angles (Hecht et al., 2014).\nSince five questions severely tax the mental abilities of most observers, we familiarize the\nobservers both with the stimuli and with the list of questions before the actual trial. In a\nbriefing section--implemented as a short video clip--the observers read the list of questions\nfollowed by the sequence of video clips. Since the questions involve geometrical concepts,\nthese are illustrated after this first briefing run, after which the list of questions and the clips\nare identically repeated. The briefings can be watched on the publisher's site. They are\ndesigned so as to avoid asking ``leading questions'' or even suggesting answers. As\nmentioned earlier, the task is considered a hard one by generic participants as evident\nfrom freely offered remarks.\nIt would have been preferable to rerun the video clip for each question, but this was not a\npossibility given our resources.\nIn Experiment II, we use pictorial presentations on the flat display, the observer being at a\nfixed position with respect to the screen. The pictorial content has a flat, brick wall in either\nfrontal or oblique attitude with a panel consisting of a framed picture attached to the wall at\nthe center. The oblique attitudes of both wall and panel are thus pictorially rather than\nphysically given. This is different from various paradigms presented in the literature, but it\nallows us to implement convenient user interaction. The visual impression is that of a scene\nviewed from a certain angle. The frame has a width of 3:0. The slant of the wall and panel is\n40 of simulated Euclidean angle (in 3D) either facing the left or the right.\nWe present gauge objects either to the left or the right of the panel. One type of gauge\nobject is used to quantify the apparent slant of the panel and another one to indicate the\napparent direction of gaze and the apparent aspect ratio (``shape'') of the face. The observers\ncontrol the gauge objects using the arrow keys of a keyboard. They can take their time for\ntheir setting, this typically involves a few seconds per setting. The interface was summarily\nexplained in a short instruction video clip at the briefing.\nAll experiments were programmed in Processing 2\u00fe, a variety of JAVA developed at M.I.T.\nand aimed at visual artists and designers (Reas & Fry, 2010), thus the ideal tool for\nexplorative experimental phenomenology.\nObservers were solicited from the University of Giessen (Germany), Cardiff School of Art\n(UK), and University of Sassari (Italy). The Giessen observers were professional vision\nresearchers in various stages of their career, the Cardiff observers were art students,\nwhereas the Sassari participants might be regarded to be ``nai\u00a8ve observers.'' In the remainder\nof the article, we refer to the Sassari group as either ``Group A'' (short) or ``the group of\nnai\u00a8ve observers,'' to the Cardiff group as either ``Group B'' (short) or ``the group of\nartistically non-nai\u00a8ve observers,'' and to the Giessen group as either ``Group C'' (short) or\n``the group of scientifically non-nai\u00a8ve observers'' (where we mean ``vision science'' in\nparticular).\nThere were 166 participants in Group A, 13 participants in Group B, and 25 participants\nin Group C. Group A was the least controlled, as it took a heroic effort to collect the\nresponses. As expected, we needed to clean the data, which was done fully algorithmically\n(see later). Participants were selected as involved in the project if they had indeed answered all\nquestions, were likely to have understood the interface, and so forth.\nGender ratios are very unbalanced, Group A is 83% female, Group B is 92% male, and\nGroup C is 58% male. The majority of participants is young. The median age of Group A\n(interquartile range 27\u00ad43, range 24\u00ad72). Although group structure is reported here, we\ndetected no influence of age or gender on our results and will not discuss these issues in the\narticle.\nWe have no data regarding the participants' stereopsis. We think it likely--on the basis of\nKoenderink, van Doorn, & Kappers, 1994; Koenderink, van Doorn, Kappers, & Todd, 2001;\nKoenderink, van Doorn, & Todd, 2009; Koenderink, van Doorn, & Wagemans, 2011)--that\nthe generic population has very significant fractions of members with lacking or anomalous\nbinocular or monocular stereopsis. Unfortunately, this topic has been seriously\nunderresearched and virtually nothing can be considered definitely established. We\nimplicitly test for monocular stereopsis weakness in the course of this experiment. We also\nhave no data on the dominant eyes of our participants, so we include this as an implicit factor\nof uncertainty in our data.\nExperiments\nAs reported earlier, we conducted two mutually complementary experiments, denoted I and\nII. In the final analysis, we also freely draw on the extensive material collected in our previous\nstudy (Koenderink et al., 2004). The difference is the emphasis on the phenomenology of the\nmatter. Spookiness cannot be investigated with purely objective methods; it has to do with\nhow things appear. We address aspects of visual awareness, rather than physiology or proper\npsychophysics.\nHalf of the observers (randomly selected) started with Experiment I and the other half\nwith Experiment II, this in order to avoid sequence effects.\nIn the analysis, we prefer to ``let the data speak for itself,'' that is to say, we practice\nexplorative data analysis. We freely use Bayes factors instead of p values where this appears\nindicated (Jaynes, 2003; Jeffreys, 1961). In the discussion sessions, we cautiously interpret\nthese data.\nExperiment I\nIn Experiment I, we attempted to probe the introspective reports of the observers and\ninvestigate whether there might be anything resembling a unique ``majority report.'' Such\nwould strengthen the value of singular first person reports due to the power of\nKoenderink et al. 5\nintersubjectivity. In this experiment, we explore simple questions that are close to criteria as\nused in regular psychophysics.\nSince many participants are not familiar with various formal concepts from geometry, we\nstarted by showing examples of rigidity, non-rigidity, and partial rigidity. The examples were\nshort video clips (provided on the publisher's website) showing abstract 3D objects\ntransforming in various ways, they did not involve pictorial elements used in the actual\nexperiment.\nAn example is (absolute or relative) ``rigidity.'' By varying a parameter in a dynamic\nstimulus, one might indeed determine an objective threshold for noticing ``rigidity.'' One\nmight even do this without a notion of rigidity as a quality of visual awareness. Asking\nfor ``rigidity'' is asking whether a certain quality is present in visual awareness. One\naddresses a quality that purports to pertain to what is experienced as ``external visual\nobject.'' Yet, it is not clear that participants fully externalize such an experience (see later).\nSome may rely primarily on emotive feelings of various kinds.\nMethods of Experiment I\nStimuli in the experiment are four short (3-s each) video clips, three of these apparently\ninvolving portraits, that are flat counterfeits of some person's face. In one case, the\ngraphics was actually that of a rotating solid head, rather than a flat picture. The clips\nshow continuously varying views of the portrait, the visual direction varying uniformly\nbetween 40 away from frontal (0) to either side of frontal, an 80 sweep. The frame is\nseen to move between two extreme views, first one way and then back the other way. In one\ncase, only the frame moved, whereas the (flat) portrait remained stationary. See Figure 2 for\nthe actual stimuli. Figure 3 shows extreme versions, which may serve to understand the\ndesign of the stimuli better.\nThese are summary descriptions of the four cases:\nCase C1 depicts the Leete poster, framed and with lettering removed. The frame is a\nrectangular, flat, orange, ribbon, coplanar with the picture panel. Depiction is in proper\nperspective for the vantage point of the observer (the midpoint of the interocular\nsegment). See Figure 2 (top center).\nCase C2 again depicts the Leete poster, but it is always depicted as seen frontally,\nwhereas only the frame moves. Thus the plane of the frame only momentarily coincides\nwith that of the picture panel, namely when depicted in frontal view. See Figure 2 (top\nright) and Figure 3 (left).\nCase C3 depicts a portrait of an Athenian warrior (Wenman, 2015), seen frontally. This video\nclip is just like that of Case C1 (the rotating Leete poster) except for the fact that another\nperson (or rather object) is depicted. See Figure 2 (bottom center).\nCase C4 again depicts the portrait of the Athenian warrior, as in Case C3. However, here the\ndepiction is the rendering of a 3D, volumetric object. Thus the face does not look planar\nwhen the view changes, but looks articulated in three dimensions (at least, to many\nobservers). The frame is flat, its plane passing through the center of the 3D head. See\nFigure 2 (bottom right) and Figure 3 (right).\nNotice that Cases C1 and C3 are at least conceptually identical: an en face portrait rocking\nback and forth about a vertical axis. The only reason to admit this replication is that we\ncannot implement Case C4 for the Leete poster. The idea is that Cases C3 and C4 and C1 and\nC2 yield the interesting comparisons. Thus, all interesting comparisons are limited to C1 and\nC2 and C3 and C4, other pairings making little sense, except for the trivial comparison of C1\nand C3 where we expect similar responses.\nThere are five questions to each Case C1 to C4, each to be answered with yes, hmm, or no,\nthe same five questions for each clip. This is different from the conventional forced choice\nmethod (yes or no). The notion is that in 2AFC methods participants are forced to select an\nalternative, even if neither alternative makes sense to them. This is indeed exactly what one\nwants from an objective method, for ideally neither the observer nor the person running the\nexperiment should have the slightest notion of what is going on. ``Double blind'' is desirable\nwhen objectivity is what one strives for. This makes sense in objective studies because\n(subjective!) ``meaning'' should not play any role.\nIn contradistinction, in experimental phenomenology, the subjective meaning of the\nalternatives is crucial. Thus, the participant should be able to indicate that neither\nalternative makes sense. This implicates that the alternatives yes, hmm, and no are not\nmembers of a common continuum nor members on a common ``three-point scale.'' Hmm\nis categorically external to the range spanned by yes and no. Consequently, in our analysis, we\nwill treat the task in terms of two distinct binary choices: ``does the question make sense'' and\nif so, ``is the preferred alternative yes or no.'' This has consequences for the formal analysis.\nThe questions are:\nQ1: does the frame appear to rotate?\nFigure 2. The top row shows the cases involving the Leete poster and the bottom row those involving the\nAthenian warrior. The left column contains the frontal presentations. Top-center is a frame from the video\nclip C1, top-right from the video clip C2. This is far more striking in motion: in Case C1, the portrait rotates\nwith the frame and in Case C2, it is motionless (always frontal). Bottom-center is a frame from the video clip\nC3, bottom-right from the video clip C4. This is again far more striking in motion: in Case C3, the portrait is\nflat and in Case C4, it is volumetric (in both cases it rotates with the frame).\nKoenderink et al. 7\nQ2: does the frame appear to deform?\nQ3: does the face appear to rotate?\nQ4: does the face appear to deform?\nQ5: does the face rotate with the frame?\nQuestion 1 and 3 address rigid motion (Euclidean rotation) and Question 5 relative rigid\nmotion. Questions 2 and 4 explicitly address the experience of deforming shapes.\nQuestions 1 and 2 relate to the frame, which was presented identically in all four cases.\nQuestions 3 and 4 relate to the face. Question 5 relates to the face in relation to the frame.\nThus, it makes sense to consider the pair Questions 1 and 2 and the triple Questions 3, 4, and\n5 in the analysis.\nIn the analysis, we refer to the presentations as ``Case 1. . .4'' (or just ``C1. . .4'') and to the\nquestions as ``Question 1. . .5'' (or just ``Q1. . .5''), sometimes paired as for instance ``C2\u00adQ3.''\nThe participants view a clip, then the display changes to the list of questions with three\npossible responses for each of the fve questions, each choice indicated as a button. The\nparticipant clicks (using the mouse) on a button. Once clicked, the three buttons for that\nparticular question become unavailable. When all five questions have been responded to, the\nprogram proceeds.\nFigure 3. Such extreme poses as shown here were not actually used in the experiment, but they perhaps\nserve better than Figure 3 to illustrate what these cases attempt to target. In the case of the Leete poster\n(left, Case C2), the frame rotates whereas the portrait stays frontoparallel. The picture plane defined by the\nframe does not coincide with the ``actual'' picture plane. In the case of the Athenian warrior (right, Case C4),\nthe frame and the head rotate rigidly together, but the head sticks out from the nominal picture plane as\ndefined by the frame. In the poses depicted here, occlusions give away the actual spatial relations. In both\ncases, the ``frontal'' case is, in principle, not different from the leftmost column of Picture 2. We have slightly\nadjusted the frame dimensions here to make sure the depth structure is as explicit as can be (in the actually\nstimuli there were no such telling occlusions). In our experience, many nai\n\u00a8ve observers fail to fully grasp these\nrelations when occlusions do not ``give them away'' in the bluntest manner.\nResults of Experiment I\nThe possible responses are no, hmm, and yes. We have 4 (Cases) \u00c2 5 (Questions) is 20 answers\nper observer. We look for recurring patterns (over observers) in the responses.\nWe start by discussing the results of Group A, which is composed of nai\u00a8ve observers and\nthus likely to have the most diversity. It is also the largest group and thus will yield the\nstrongest statistics. We discuss Groups B and C in relation to A, thus more summarily,\nmainly looking for notable differences.\nFirst thing to do with a large group of nai\u00a8ve participants is to screen observers, in this case to\ncheck for consistent formats of the reports. We had to remove a few participants because one or\nmore answers were missing. The group we report on in this section includes 131 observers.\nAs a first pass through the data, we collect instances of hmm responses. In total, there are\n57 of those, implying a frequency of 2.2% (credibility range 1.7\u00ad2.8%), which is rather low.\nThere are eight observers that responded hmm four times, which seems excessive. Indeed, a\nPoisson dispersion test shows that the number of hmm responses per observer is very far from\ntruly random. The tendency to use hmm is highly idiosyncratic, as is only to be expected.\nOf course, it is of interest to see how the hmm responses are divided among the cases and\nquestions. This distribution is far from uniform as can be gleaned from Figure 4.\nA comparison with the results for Groups B and C (Figure 4) suggests that the pattern is\nsystematic, although there also appear to be inter-group differences. The main difference is\nC1\u00adQ2. Group C never hesitates whether the frame deforms, Group B does and for Group A,\nit is the major source of hmm decisions. Perhaps remarkably, this does not repeat in C3\u00adQ2.\nFact I.1: A minority of observers find it hard to decide whether the frame deforms or not.\nAfter considering the hmm responses, we concentrate on the yes\u00adno answers. In doing so, we\nomit the instances of observers using hmm. Although this is perhaps excessively conservative,\nwe have sufficient data not to worry about it. We specifically look for patterns in the data that\nmight fit the intention in setting up the questions. To make sure no important regularities are\nwilly nilly ignored, we also performed various types of analysis that are not reported here.\nThis makes that we are quite certain to report on the major features here. We discuss these by\ngroups of cases and questions.\nFigure 4. The distribution of hmm decisions for Groups A, B, and C (left to right) over all cases and\nquestions. The total number hmm decisions is rather low, we have indicated the number of instances for each\ngroup. Notice that the pattern of responses is similar for all groups, with the notable exception of hmm\ndecision for C1\u00adQ2 in Group C (``does the frame deform?'' for the generic Leete poster case). The area of\nthe black disks is proportional with the frequency.\nKoenderink et al. 9\nAll Cases, Questions 1 and 2\nThe Questions 1 and 2 address the mode of change of the frame, thus it appears natural to\nlook over all cases. After removal of the hmm responses, we end up with 501 yes\u00adno\nresponses. There are 23 hmm responses, 22 of which are of the Type YH (we use this\nnotation as shorthand for ``first question yes, second question hmm''). Thus, these\nobservers experience the frame as rotating, but are not fully decided on whether it\ndeforms. This corresponds to the aforementioned Fact I.1.\nNotice that the four possible response patterns are NN, YN, NY, and YY. In case there was no\nregularity, these would be equally likely, thus drawn from a binomial distribution with\nprobability 1/4. If there is a discernible pattern, it should deviate from this in a\nremarkable way. To quantify this, we compute the Bayes factors.\nThe Bayes factors are reported in bits. As a metric, we use the scale:\n< 1 bit: negative\nIntuitively, a Bayes factor of 10 bits implies that the hypothesis that the pattern exists predicts\nthe observation a thousand times (210 \u00bc 1024) better than the non-informative null\nhypothesis does. Thus, the Bayes factor is evidence in favor of the existence of the pattern.\nThe logarithmic measure makes the evidence an additive quantity. The majority of\nconclusions reported here are in the ``compelling'' category, except for those that apply to\nthe smaller groups, in such cases, we explicitly mention the strength of the evidence.\nThe advantage of the Bayes factors is that they fit our explorative endeavor much more\nnaturally than conventional hypothesis testing. It allows one to collect and quantify evidence\nin favor of a hypothesis instead of against some null hypothesis. To offer some solace to those\nwho mistrust Bayesian methods, we also show the 5% confidence interval for the binomial\ncase, as in Figure 5 (left). In no case do we report patterns that would not lead to very small p\nvalues in a classical hypothesis test.\nIn this case, the pattern is very clear, namely a huge majority YN (Bayes factor > 10:\n``compelling''). We find exactly the same pattern for the other groups. Thus, the evident\nconsensus for all groups is:\nPattern 1. For all groups and all presentations the frame appears to rotate rigidly.\nThis is perhaps not a great surprise (Saunders & Backus, 2007).\nCases 1 and 3, Questions 3, 4, and 5. This involves the ``standard'' stimuli. One expects similar\nresults for these cases. Indeed, they are not different (p value .35) in a t test, so we pool these\ncases. Possible patterns are NNN, YNN, . . . , YYY, eight in total. There is one pattern that\ndominates; it is YYY (Figure 5, center). For Group B, there is no clear pattern, for Group\nC there is, again YYY. (In all cases, Bayes factor > 10: ``compelling.'') Thus:\nPattern 2. For Groups A and C and for the generic stimuli, the face appears to rotate with the\nframe AND the face appears to deform. For Group B, there is no discernible pattern.\nCase 2, Questions 3, 4, and 5. This involves the special case of the Leete poster in static, frontal\nposition with a rotating frame. Again, there are eight possible patterns. For Group A, there is\none dominating pattern, it is NNN. For both Groups B and C, the pattern is also NNN. (In all\ncases, Bayes factor > 10: ``compelling.'') Thus:\nPattern 3. For all groups and for the static, frontal presentation with rotating frame, the face does\nnot appear to rotate (unlike the frame) and it does not appear to deform.\nCase 4, Questions 3, 4, and 5. This involves the special case of the 3D model of the Athenian\nwarrior that rotates with the frame. Again, there are eight possible patterns. For Group A,\nthere are two dominating patterns, they are YNY and YYY (Figure 5, right). As in all cases for\nGroup A, the evidence is rated ``compelling.''\nFor Group B, we find only the Pattern YNY, although the Bayes factor is only 3.9 bits\n(``positive''). For Group C, we find the Pattern YNY (Bayes factor 7.9 bits: ``strong''), as well\nas the Pattern YYY (Bayes factor 4.6 bits: ``positive''). Thus:\nPattern 4. For all groups and for the 3D, rotating Athenian warrior, the face rotates with the\nframe. Groups A and C report both deformation and rigidity and Group B only rigidity.\nSimilar results are seen in simple frequency counts over observers (Figure 6). We define the\ngroup response as the probability of yes among the yes\u00ador\u00adno answers. This probability is\nFigure 5. Left: The frequency of occurrence of a pattern (scale [0,1]) for the pair of questions Q1,2 and all\ncases for Group A. ``Does the frame rotate?'' and ``Does the frame deform?''. The Pattern YN is much more\nfrequent than the binomial null hypothesis predicts. The latter prediction is the black vertical line, and the gray\nband gives the two-sided 5% confidence interval. The Patterns YY, NN, and NY occur much less frequently\nthan predicted by the null hypothesis. The Bayes factor > 10 bit tells one that the existence of the Pattern YN\nis ``compelling.'' Thus, the pattern is that over all cases ``The frame does appear to rotate rigidly'' (Pattern 1).\nCenter: The frequency of occurrence (for Group A) of patterns involving Q3, 4, 5: ``Does the face rotate?'',\n``Does the face appear to deform?'', and ``Does the face appear to rotate with the frame?''

There is ``compelling''\nevidence in favor of the Pattern YYY: ``The face appears to rotate with the frame AND it appears to deform''\n(Pattern 2). Right: The frequency of occurrence (for Group A) of patterns involving Q3, 4, 5: ``Does the face\nrotate?'', ``Does the face appear to deform?'', and ``Does the face appear to rotate with the frame?''

Here,\nthere is ``compelling'' evidence in favor of both Pattern YNY: ``The face appears to rotate rigidly with the frame''\nand YYY: ``The face appears to rotate with the frame AND the face appears to deform'' (Pattern 4).\nKoenderink et al. 11\ncalculated by Bayesian estimation, using the binomial distribution and the non-informative\nJeffrey's prior. The credible intervals are based on a 5% credibility level.\nAlthough the resulting distribution warrants close study, it would appear that the search\nfor patterns as described earlier has largely exhausted the structure. To look ``deeper'' into\nthe data, one might attempt some form of ``blind source separation.'' Such an analysis might\nbe able to resolve ``the voices by which the data speak.''\nA simple way to perform such an analysis is by agglomeration. We first render the answers\nnumerically (yes ! \u00fe1, hmm ! 0, no ! \u00c01), thus obtaining 131 vectors in a 20D space. We\nnormalize, that is to say, each vector is transformed to zero mean unit variance. Conventional\nlinear methods such as principal components analysis find not much structure in this data,\nsince it requires 10 dimensions to explain three quarters of the variance. We then\nagglomerate, using Ward linkage and Euclidean distance, leading to the dendrogram\nshown in Figure 7 (left).\nApparently, there are at least four major clusters, all of appreciable size (45 in Cluster 1, 39\nin Cluster 2, 20 in Cluster 3, and 17 in Cluster 4). Now, we can limit the search for patterns to\nsingle clusters.\nThis does indeed allow one to resolve the ambiguity left in Pattern 4: Cluster 1 has YNY and\nCluster 2 has YYY as the dominant pattern (Figure 7, right).\nFact I.2: For Group A and for the 3D, rotating Athenian warrior, the face rotates with the frame.\nThere is a cluster of observers reporting deformation and another cluster reporting rigidity.\nLikewise, we further refine Pattern 2. Clusters 1, 2, and 4 yield the same pattern as the\ngroup responses YYY, but for Cluster 3, the pattern is NYN (Bayes factor > 10:\n``compelling''). Thus:\nFact I.3: There is a cluster for which the generic presentations are experienced differently: The face\ndoes not appear to rotate, but it deforms.\nFigure 6. The overall pattern of responses for Group A. The yes counts are indicated by yellow and the no\ncounts by blue. The cyan bands indicate the credibility intervals based on a 5% credibility level. Probability is\ncalculated by Bayesian estimation, using the binomial distribution and the non-informative Jeffreys prior.\nFor Groups B and C, clustering does not make much sense (and was not attempted),\nsimply because the group sizes are too small.\nDiscussion Experiment I\nWhat do these results imply? The overall answers of the Group A of nai\u00a8ve observers yield a\nvery clear picture, which needs only be nuanced slightly when Groups B and C are taken into\naccount.\nThe participants happen to report impressions that closely resemble the awareness of the\nauthors when viewing the video clips. The reader is invited to watch these clips on the\npublisher's website, for an understanding of our conclusions will be virtually impossible\nwithout such a personal experience. In various cases, it may be necessary to view a clip\nseveral times, with different questions in mind.\nThere is no doubt as to the efficacy of the video presentation--which, after all, takes place\non a flat screen: To the question ``does the frame rotate?'' 95.4% of the answers were yes and\nto the question ``does the frame deform?'' 82.8 responses were no. Apparently, most observers\nexperience a dynamic scene in cinematic space. However, in view of Fact I.1, the decision of\nwhether the frame rotates rigidly appears to be not immediately obvious.\nSurely, Pattern 1 is a decisive result: the frame rotates rigidly. This is important in\nattempting to make sense of the patterns that apply to the faces. We start with Pattern 2,\nwhich applies to the generic stimuli. Observers apparently experience the Leete poster and the\nflat, frontal portrait of the Athenian warrior, both rotating in a frame as similar. The faces\nappear to rotate with the frame, as is indeed what the graphics simulates. However, the faces\nare simultaneously seen to deform, how can that be? Notice that (Fact I.3) there is a cluster\nfor which the face does not rotate at all, but only deforms. Are these findings in conflict?\nIn our experience, one may indeed be aware of either rigid rotation with the frame in\ncinematic space or of a planar deformation (periodic shrinking and expanding in the\nFigure 7. Left: Dendrogram for the responses of participant of Group A in Experiment I. We used\nMathematica's DendrogramPlot[] function. Agglomeration for Experiment I was based on the Euclidean\ndistance function and Ward linkage on the normalized responses per observer. It may be regarded a form of\n``blind source separation.'' The major groups are evident, they occur after the first ``split.'' Right: Like Figure 5\n(right) but the analysis performed on the main two clusters of Group A. Notice that the division in clusters\nresolves the ambiguity in the overall group response. One cluster has the YNY pattern, the other cluster the\nYYY pattern.\nKoenderink et al. 13\nhorizontal direction) in the plane of the display screen. The latter mode appears mainly when\nthe frame is not too oblique, the former when it is near its most extreme slanted positions. It\nseems likely that the observers tried to somehow force such (not necessarily present in their\ndiscursive mind) complex visual awareness into the straitjacket of our questions.\nThe special cases do not yield major surprises. In the case of the static, frontal Leete\nposter, observers experience the situation much as the graphics simulates (Pattern 3). This\nis useful as a reference, perhaps a ``sanity check,'' but it hardly suggests a novel conceptual\nperspective. It serves to rule out some (in our view far-fetched) interpretations though, we do\nnot explicitly discuss these.\nIn the case of the 3D rotating Athenian warrior, most observers also experience exactly\nwhat the graphics simulates; however, a minority sees the face deform (Pattern 4 and Fact\nI.2). What to make of that? It is potentially interesting, for apparently, some observers relate\nthe (momentary!) picture of the face to the frame, whereas others do not. If they do, then\nthere is obvious (at one or other pictorial level) deformation, otherwise there is none (for all is\naccounted for!).\nExperiment II\nIn Experiment II, we use methods of ``fit'' to sample the apparent spatial attitude of the brick\nwall and the frame and methods of ``reproduction'' to sample the apparent direction of gaze\nand the apparent aspect ratio. We have explored the method of fit in many previous studies\n(starting with Koenderink et al., 1992). Both methods of reproduction are novel and were\ndesigned for the present experiment.\nAll methods were experienced as ``natural'' by the participants. They are of a primary\nvisual nature and involve no, or hardly any, reflective thought. Indeed, it is hard to imagine\nhow reflective thought might aid in performing (``solving'' does not really apply here) the\ntask. The settings simply have to ``look good'' and ``feel good.'' Again, this is experimental\nphenomenology, rather than cognitive science.\nMethods of Experiment II\nSince the stimuli in Experiment II are static, we use the brick wall background (Figure 8) to\nenhance the awareness of slant of the picture panel. The brick wall was not used in the video\nclips of Experiment I because the dynamic presentation already yields a vivid impression of\nspatial attitude.\nIn one setting, we have the participant indicate slant by fitting a simple elliptical gauge\nfigure to the surface of the wall (Figure 9, left\u00adtop; Koenderink et al., 1992). The ellipse\nshould look like it is a circle painted on the wall. The participant controls the simulated slant\nby means of the left\u00adright arrow keys on the keyboard.\nIn a second setting, we have the participant indicate the gaze direction of the portrayed\nhead by reproducing that gaze in the picture of a simple smiley (Figure 9, left\u00adcenter). The\nparticipant controls the simulated gaze (in the smiley picture) by means of the left\u00adright\narrow keys on the keyboard. (The gaze direction was simulated by the position of the\npupil in the smiley's eye. The offset was taken proportional to the sine of the simulated\ngaze angle.) As one changes the gaze parameter, one experiences the smiley to change\nviewing direction in a very lifelike manner, despite the fact that the smiley looks like a flat,\nicon-like picture at all times.\nIn a third setting, we have the participant indicate the shape of the portrayed head by\napproximating that shape in the picture of a simple smiley (Figure 9, left\u00adbottom).\nThe participant controls the aspect ratio (width over height) of the smiley by means of the\nup\u00addown arrow keys on the keyboard. As one changes the aspect ratio, one experiences the\nsmiley to change from ``frog faced'' to ``horse faced'' (or anuran to equine if you like).\nThe setting feels like a natural one.\nThree slants are presented, frontal and 40 either side from frontal. The gauge figures are\npresented once at the left of the frame and once at the right. Thus, the participant has to\ncomplete 18 settings in total. All conditions are fully randomized.\nIn Figure 9 (right), we illustrate the cases simulated by the graphics. The wall may be\nfrontal or oblique. If oblique, we distinguish two different attitudes, referred to as the ``left\nfacing'' and the ``right facing'' wall. In all these cases, the gauge objects may appear either to\nthe left or to the right of the stimulus. For most of the discussion, we present averages over\nthe latter two cases, but in a few instances we differentiate. Notice that Figure 9 (right) was\ndrawn for clarity and is only intended as schematic. In reality, the screen of the display unit\nwas a fixed rectangle in any case.\nResults of Experiment II\nAgain, the first thing to do is to screen observers. We use three criteria to omit observers from\nthe analysis:\n(1) If one or more slant settings are below the 2.5% or above the 97.5% quantiles, we omit\nthe participant;\n(2) If one or more gaze settings are below the 2.5% or above the 97.5% quantiles, we omit\nthe participant;\n(3) If one or more aspect ratio change values is higher than 1.2, we omit the participant.\nThis reduces the number of observers in Group A from 166 to 131.\nFigure 8. The presentation of the brick wall filled the full window.\nKoenderink et al. 15\nAs to Criterion 1, this simply removes a few observers that most likely did not understand\nthe task, did something random, or simply did nothing at all (left it at the random initial\nsetting);\nAs to Criterion 2, a few settings are to the extreme left or right (almost 90  gaze angle),\nthese are evidently erroneous. Leaving them out seems natural.\nAs to Criterion 3, some participants appear to see smiley faces become two or more times\nwider when viewed obliquely than when viewed frontally. What happens, as suggested by\npersonal interactions, is that these observers interchanged the horizontal and vertical\ndimensions. Indeed, if one swaps these, their results become generic. In view of the large\nenough numbers, it seemed best to omit such observers.\nThe selection process was carried out fully automatically by an algorithm based on these\ncriteria without exception.\nThus, we were left with 131 participants in Group A. Likewise, we retained 7 of 13\nparticipants in Group B and 20 of 25 participants in Group C.\nFigure 9. This figure introduces the gauge objects and some technical terms used to describe them in the\ntext. The gauge object for slant is illustrated at left\u00adtop, the gauge object for gaze direction at left\u00adcenter, and\nthe gauge object for facial shape (aspect ratio) at left\u00adbottom (notice that a single graphical object is used to\ngauge gaze and shape. However, its meaning and user interaction interface are very different in the two cases).\nThe gauge object for slant is the graphical rendering of a circle, indicating a flat disk and thus a planar spatial\nattitude and a rod sticking out at right angles from the plane of the disk. The combination of disk and rod\nenables good discrimination at all spatial attitudes. The rod is supposed to stick out forwards (toward the\nobserver) in all cases, so it resolves the mirror ambiguity about the fronto-parallel plane. The example at left\nhas negative slant and the one at right has positive slant. The gauge object for gaze direction is a smiley icon.\nThe position of the pupils in the eyes yield a sensitive measure of gaze. The example at left has negative gaze\nangle and the one at right has positive gaze angle. The gauge object for shape is also a smiley icon. The\nexample at left has aspect ratio greater than one (frog-faced) and the one at right has aspect ratio smaller than\none (horse-faced). At right is shown the geometrical convention referred to in the text. The graphics\nsimulates a wall that is either ``left facing'' or ``right facing.'' Gauge objects are placed alongside the stimulus\n(central square), either on the left or on the right. This makes a difference, as explained in Figure 10 (for a\n``right faced'' attitude, but the alternative is related by mirror symmetry about the vertical).\nThe geometry of the stimulus is worth special attention (Figure 10). Of course, this\ngeometry is partly defined by the physical setting (display unit, participant location), partly\nby the pictorial content (the perspective rendering of the brick wall, the frame, etc.). The effect\nof the geometry depends on the way the participant experiences the pictorial space. This is an\nidiosyncratic factor that we cannot control. However, we have considerable experience with\nsuch effects for the generic population from our earlier work (Koenderink et al., 2001;\n2009). Figure 10 is a drawing in the space simulated by the graphics, thus it is observer\nindependent.\nThe actual situation is even more complicated, since the observers view the screen\nbinocularly. Their responses are likely to be mainly determined by the location of their\ndominant eye or perhaps by the location of the virtual ``cyclopean eye'' in case eye\ndominance is weak or absent (Chaurasia & Mathur, 1976; Khan & Crawford, 2001; Porac\n& Coren, 1975). Since we have collected no eye dominance data, this implies a factor of\nuncertainty in the observations.\nThe stimulus proper is always presented at the center of the screen. The area around it is\nfilled with the brick wall. The wall texture is very important in pictorially specifying the slant\nof the frame. The smiley gauge is presented either on the left or the right of the stimulus\n(Figure 9, right). In the final analysis, we average over the two cases, but it is of some interest\nto consider the relevance of these placements. We have shown previously that generic\nobservers relate the spatial attitude of an object to the visual direction to that object\n(Koenderink et al., 2009). This suggests that the participant would experience the smiley as\nFigure 10. The geometry of the stimulus. These schematic drawings are in the space that is simulated by\nthe graphics (the display screen is frontoparallel in all cases!). In this drawing, E denotes the ``eye'' (actually the\nobserver's mid-ocular-segment or dominant eye), d the viewing distance (57 cm), and s the wall simulated by\nthe graphics (15 inch horizontal extent). In the drawing at left (frontal view), the locations L and R are places\nwhere the smiley gauge might occur. In the drawing at right, L and R denote the places where the slant gauge\nfigure might occur. The eccentricities of L and R (angles e,  and ) are about 15\nof visual angle. The smiley\nsubtends about 8\nthe slant gauge figure about 5\n. Of special interest are the angles a, , and c. The angle a is\n. The slant of the wall is 40\n.\nKoenderink et al. 17\nslanted over an angle a (about 14:2) in the ``frontal'' view. However, this effect of ``external\nlocal sign'' (Koenderink et al., 2010) is especially important if the object is volumetric. Since\nthe smiley is flat and not seen as ``on the wall,'' observers may well experience it as normal to\nthe local viewing direction and thus act as if a were zero. This is an issue that has to be\nresolved empirically, we address it in our analysis.\nThe gauge figures for slant are also presented once to the left and once to the right of the\nstimulus, conditions to be averaged over in the final analysis. This case is different from the\nprevious one, for various reasons. Notice that the angles  (about 25:6) and c (about 50:2)\nare very different. Their mean is about the slant of the wall (40), but one angle is much\nsmaller and the other much larger than that. Another reason this case is very different from\nthe previous one is that the observers are expected to ``see'' the ellipse of the gauge figure as\nbeing in the plane of the wall (Koenderink et al., 1992). In our analysis, we need to consider\nthe four cases of wall slanted to the left or right and gauge presented to the left or right as\nessentially distinct. Our analysis fully takes this into account. However, for the sake of\nconciseness, we present results in terms of suitable averages, occasionally mentioning\nsystematic deviations where relevant.\nThe gauge figure settings for obliqueness and the gaze settings are converted to degrees of\nvisual angle. The aspect ratio settings are reported as the ratio between the setting in oblique\nview to that in the frontal view. The latter normalizes aspect ratio estimate differences\nbetween participants. This is very important because absolute aspect ratio settings are\ninevitably idiosyncratic. We refer to this ratio as the ``aspect ratio change.'' It will be\nequal to one in the case of ``no effect.'' Any value different from one implies a non-rigid\ndeformation. As discussed here, we find a very significant effect of obliquity in that the face\nappears to grow leaner as the slant increases.\nIn the frontal view, the spatial attitude of the frame and the direction of gaze coincide.\nBoth the normal to the frame and the gaze direction point straight toward the observer.\nIn the oblique presentations, the spatial attitude of the frame is indeed indicated as\noblique. There is a clear dichotomy between a slant to the left and one to the right. Such a\ndichotomy is much less or absent for the gaze direction, which remains largely unaffected by\nthe oblique presentation. This is, of course, an objective demonstration of the familiar effect\nthat frontally counterfeited people always ``look at you'' or ``follow you'' when you walk past\nthe portrait--that is to say, the ``uncanny effect.''\nWe start the analysis with Group A, the large group of 131 nai\u00a8ve observers.\nIn Figure 11, we plot the observed slant and gaze angles against those implemented by the\ngraphics. Essentially, the same data is plotted in Figures 12 and 13, perhaps these are even\nmore intuitive. This already reveals the major effects in a nutshell:\nFact II.1: The slant settings for Group A are monotonically related to the angles implemented by the\ngraphics. However, the slant settings for the frontal presentation are ``frontal'' (irrespective the\nangle a) and those for the highest slants are severely underestimated.\nFact II.2: The gaze settings for Group A are unrelated to the magnitude of the angles implemented\nby the graphics. However, there is a systematic offset from frontal in the opposite direction of the\nslant. The settings in frontal presentation are ``frontal'' (irrespective the angle a).\nThe mean (over the gauge object locations) gaze settings for the left and right facing walls are\ncorrelated (Pearson correlation coefficient\u00ad.25) at the 0.004 level. The gaze settings for a right\nfacing wall and left and right gauge object locations are also correlated (coefficient \u00fe .27, at\nthe 10\u00c05 level), similar for the left facing wall.\nFor the frontal presentation, the gaze settings for left and right gauge object locations are\ncorrelated (coefficient \u00fe .29 at the 0.0003 level). The gaze directions differ by 1:3. If the gauge\nobject is located on the right of the stimulus, then the gaze direction is farther to the left.\nSimilarly, if the gauge object is located on the left of the stimulus, then the gaze direction is\nfarther to the right.\nThe average gaze directions are \u00c04:9 for the left facing wall, \u00c01:2 for the frontal wall,\nand 5:1 for the right facing wall. The quartile ranges (\u00c09:4 to \u00fe0:5 for the left facing wall\nand 0:63 to 9:4 for the right facing wall) do not overlap. Yet, the distributions are broad\nenough that the odds are that for a given instance four out of five gazes go to one side and\none out of five to the other.\nFact II.3: Gaze settings for left and right facing wall attitudes are correlated.\nFact II.4: Gaze settings for left and right locations of the gauge object are correlated for the\nslanted as well as for the frontal presentations.\nFact II.5: Gaze direction depends only upon the orientation of the wall, not on the location of the\ngauge object. Wall facing left implies gaze toward the right and vice versa. For the frontal wall,\nthe gaze is frontal.\nAnother essential issue involves the aspect ratio change. The median aspect ratio in the\nindeed attempt to estimate the shape of the head (which is evidently elongated vertically,\nsee Figure 2), they do not simply set a default (circular) smiley. The settings for the smiley on\nFigure 11. An overview of the slant (blue) and gaze (red) settings for Group A. The top and bottom of the\nboxes, with the horizontal line roughly at center show the quartiles of the settings. The vertical centered line\nshows the angles as obtained from Figure 10. These ``geometrical angles are the angles \u00c6, \u00c6 , and \u00c6\n.''\nThe left and right sides of the boxes show the bounds on the variation of these angles as the (unknown) eye\ndominance is taken into account. The black diagonal indicates the identity (settings equal to the angles\nsimulated by the graphics) and the dashed horizontal line indicates independence (the settings are frontal no\nmatter what the graphics is like).\nKoenderink et al. 19\nthe left and on the right are correlated (p value 210\u00c07). The inter-observer variation explains\n16.3% of the variance, thus the settings are to some extent idiosyncratic. This is even more\npronounced in the other groups. For instance, for Group C (the largest small group), 64% of\nthe variance is explained by the inter-observer variations.\nFigure 13. The observations of slant (in blue) and gaze (in red) indicated by their interquartile ranges,\nplotted in the space as simulated by the graphics. The oblique drawn lines indicate the medians. The dashed\nlines are perpendicular to the median slant directions. The vertical dashed lines indicate the forward\ndirection. Notice that the gaze is much closer to this forward direction than to the direction perpendicular to\nthe slant. The latter might be seen as the (nai\n\u00a8ve) prediction of where ``the face looks at.''\nFigure 12. Left: smooth histograms of the slant and gaze settings of Group A observers for the two oblique\nspatial attitudes simulated by the graphics. The vertical dashed lines show the predictions from the geometry\nexplained in Figure 10. In order not to complicate the figure too much, we averaged over the positions of the\ngauge objects. The slant settings for right facing walls are in red, the gaze settings in orange, whereas the slant\nsettings for left facing walls are in blue, the gaze settings in green. Right: Here, we show the slant settings for\nleft and right facing walls, but differentiated with respect to the location (left or right of the stimulus pane) of\nthe gauge object. (These are data from Group C, selected because the data of the group of these (many\nprofessional) observers has less variability than Group A.) Notice that the observers clearly resolve the\ngeometry explained in Figure 10, although the slant as simulated by the graphics is severely underestimated.\nThe same differentiation is found in Groups A and B, although somewhat less articulate.\nOf course, we are mainly interested in the aspect ratio change. Here, ``change'' is used to\nindicate that the reported values are normalized by the fronto-parallel settings. Ideally, the\n``aspect ratio change'' would be equivalent to the aspect ratio of an object that appears like a\ncircular disk in frontal view. In a nai\u00a8ve model, the aspect ratio change would be due to\ngeometrical foreshortening, the cosine of the angle of the oblique view. Here, we would\nnot know which angle to take. A ``veridical choice'' might be the angle simulated by the\ngraphics, but the slant setting might be the causally effective angle in the participant's mind.\nAll we can do is compare observations and expectations. In Figure 14 (left), the aspect ratio\nchange is compared with the foreshortening factor derived from the observed slants. There\nappears to be little relation. Correlation test also reveals the slant and aspect ratio settings to\nbe independent. The result is even more articulate for Groups B and C. Thus:\nFact II.6: For all groups, there is a pronounced aspect ratio change. The aspect ratio change is\nstronger than expected from the graphics. It is much stronger than the foreshortening factor derived\nfrom the observed slants. Slant and aspect ratio settings are not correlated.\nSome other observations are of interest, especially those that involve the relation between\nvarious parameters. Here, we mention a few that apply to Group A. The other groups are\noften too small (or marginal) to arrive at strong conclusions. However, they yield results that\nnever oppose those of Group A and typically echo them in a (statistically) weak form. In\nFigure 14 (center and right), we show the aspect ratio changes for these groups.\nThe slant settings for left and right facing walls correlate (p value 1:610\u00c06) and so do the\ngaze settings (p value .004); however, the slant settings do not correlate with the gaze settings\n(p values .47\u00ad.90). Both the slant and the gaze settings have a left\u00adright dependence, which\nmight suggest a relation (Figure 15), which is obviously spurious.\nThe gaze settings do not correlate at all with the aspect ratio changes (p value .78) nor with\nthe slant settings (p value .86).\nThese are all important observations:\nFact II.7: The observations of aspect ratio change have no relation to the observed slants or\ngazes. They are stronger than expected on basis of the graphics.\nFact II.8: The slant and gaze settings are mutually unrelated.\nFact II.9: Slant settings for left and right facing walls are highly correlated (so are left and right\ngaze settings; Fact II.3).\nFigure 14. Left: Smooth histograms for the aspect ratio change (red) and the foreshortening factor\npredicted by the observed slants for Group A; Center: idem for Group B; Right: idem for Group C. The black\nline indicates the foreshortening factor predicted by the graphics. There is no a priori reason to expect these\nvery different observations to be related except for the simplest geometrical model. Here, it is visually\nevident that the slant settings are useless to predict the aspect ratio settings. The slant simulated by the\ngraphics comes somewhat closer, but, of course, the observers have no immediate access to that.\nKoenderink et al. 21\nFact II.10: In the frontal presentation, both the slant and gaze settings are frontal, the angle a is\nnot taken into account.\nAs in Experiment I, one might expect a blind source separation to reveal additional structure.\nWe use data obtained by joining slant, gaze, and aspect ratio change observations. We\nnormalize each of these before joining, obviously necessary because of the categorically\ndifferent dimensions, then agglomerate using the Euclidean distance function and Ward\nlinking. In this case, we do not find much novel structure, and the major clusters differ\nmainly in the degree of underestimation of the slant.\nIndeed, the slant settings have a very large spread. If we study the slant settings for the case\nwhere the simulation from the graphics is 50:2, we find a median setting of 33 (thus the\naforementioned pronounced underestimation), with an interquartile range of 23 to 43,\nwhereas 10% of the settings are outside the range 11 to 56. Thus, the variation in the\ngroup of 131 participants is more than a factor of 5. The settings for left and right facing\nFact II.11: Clustering in Group A mainly reveals differences that relate to the slant settings.\nWhereas one cluster closely follows the expectation from the graphics, another major cluster\nseverely underestimates these. The variability of slant settings is at least a factor of 5. Settings\nfor left and right facing walls are correlated.\nDiscussion Experiment II\nAll observers experience the gaze direction as aimed at them, albeit with slight variations.\nSimultaneously, the frame is experienced as changing its spatial attitude over a range of tens\nof degrees (Facts II.1 and II.2). This evidently illustrates the familiar uncanny effect.\nFigure 15. Scatterplot of the slant and gaze of observers in Group A. Notice that the black regression line\nfits the data, but does not implicate that slant and gaze are related, only that both depend on the direction of\nthe obliqueness simulated by the graphics.\nThe face clearly has a different shape in the oblique presentations from its appearance in\nthe frontal presentation (Fact II.6). It is as if the expected automatic ``correction'' (Banks,\n1999) for the perspectival foreshortening is applied to the frame, but not to the face. This is a\nhighly remarkable and conceptually important result.\nIt is of some interest to study how this deformation effect corresponds to the\nforeshortening cue. Notice that we have six parameters of interest here:\n-- the depicted slant SP, as given by the perspective;\n-- the apparent slant SA, as indicated by the participant's settings;\n-- the slant SR, as derived from the change in aspect ratio;\n-- the actual foreshortening factor FP, as derived from the depicted slant;\n-- the foreshortening factor FA, as derived from the apparent slant;\n-- the deformation R, as determined from the observed aspect ratio changes.\nThe data show that neither FP nor FA are well estimated by R. Apparently, the aspect ratio\nchanges stand in no relation to either the observed gazes or slants (Fact II.7).\nWhat does this imply? Apparently, the aspect ratio estimates derive from the 2D visual\nfield, whereas the slants must derive from pictorial space, that is to say, monocular stereopsis.\nThis is corroborated by Facts II.7 and II.8, the aspect ratio change, slant, and gaze settings\nare mutually unrelated.\nSuch a conclusion fits the finding from Experiment I that the face appears to deform\ndespite the fact that it ``rotates with the frame.'' What appears to be the case is that the\nchange of the face over time is experienced as a deformation and a rotation, whereas the\nframe suffers a rigid rotation. The rotation and deformation of the face can be experienced\neach as such, simultaneously or successively. It is in such ambiguity of the presentation and\nlogical inconsistency in reflective thought that we have to look for an understanding of the\nresults. Numerous idiosyncratic effects are to be expected.\nThe two clusters of the Group A observers mainly relate to the strength of the\nmonocular stereopsis as revealed by the magnitude of the observed slants (Fact II.11).\nSuch slant estimate ``gain factors'' are evidently idiosyncratic as is shown by the\ncorrelation between left and right settings (Koenderink & van Doorn, 2003;\nKoenderink et al., 2001; Fact II.9). This is different from the relation between the gaze\ndirection settings and the slants, which are essentially uncorrelated. It is also different\nfrom the relation between the aspect ratio change settings and the slants, which are\nessentially uncorrelated too.\nGaze direction and aspect ratio change have apparently no relation to monocular\nstereopsis, whereas the slant observations have. These facts are highly relevant to the\ninterpretation of the main effect.\nThe gaze directions have an idiosyncratic component, as evident from Fact II.3. There is\nno dependence upon the location of the gauge object relative to the stimulus (Fact II.5), not\neven in the case of frontal presentation. Some part of the variance is possibly related to eye\ndominance, but we have no means to check this. At least one participant spontaneously\nremarked on the fact that the gauge object is not exactly presented frontally; thus, in\norder to have the face ``look at you,'' a small correction in the opposite location might be\npreferred. Indeed, such an effect might be expected due to the nature of the ``external local\nsign'' for the majority of the population, a strong effect that we have investigated before\n(Koenderink et al., 2009, 2010). However, we find no evidence for such a systematic effect\nhere, possibly due to the fact that the angle a is only about 14.\nKoenderink et al. 23\nLord Kitchener does not ``look straight at the observer'' (as in frontal presentation:\nmedian 0) when the wall is oblique, but looks slightly (median 4:5) over the right\nshoulder when the wall is facing left, and vice versa. Notice that this effect is quite\nappreciable, as it amounts to the interpupillary distance as seen from a range of about\n80 cm. It appears that we find quantitative evidence of the ``Wollaston illusion''\nIn Figure 17, we have collected the summary results for the three groups. The conclusion is\nevident in that the same pattern is repeated over all three groups. It neatly quantifies the\nanecdotal account that Lord Kitchener keeps looking at you (gazing and facing), even when\nviewed from the side. The aspect ratio change is hardly ever mentioned in the literature\n(Koenderink et al., 2004). It is also similar for all groups.\nOverall Discussion Experiments I and II\nIn this section, we summarize the main results that immediately follow from the initial\nanalysis.\nAll groups yield equivalent results for the main effect. What is novel in our analysis are\nmany refinements and details that allow one to speculate with more confidence about the\norigin of the effect. Some simple facts immediately gleaned from Figures 11 and 12 are that\nthe effect is indeed very significant, but that the slant is seriously underestimated.\nWhen the wall faces right, the expectation is for the gaze to go over your right shoulder, by\nan angle equal to the slant simulated by the graphics. This is not the case, the gaze is much\nFigure 16. Left: A frontal gazing smiley of unit aspect ratio (circular face) and two ``horse-faced'' smileys,\nalso with frontal gaze direction. This is a purely planar rendering. Right: Here, the smileys are identical as at\nleft, but we added a ``triptych'' in 3D. The smiley at center is drawn on the central, frontoparallel plane, but\nthe horse-faced smileys can be seen in any of two ways: They can be seen as frontal and horse faced, like at\nleft, but they can also be seen as circular, ``foreshortened'' smileys. The latter happens if you see them as\ndrawn on the oblique side panels--in pictorial space, of course. Consider how you would prefer to change\nthe positions of the pupils in the eyes so as to make the smileys ``look at you.'' In our case, if the panel faces\nleft, we would set the pupils so as to let the smiley ``look (just a little) over our right shoulder'' and vice versa.\nOf course, this supposes that you manage to see the smileys as slanted in 3D in the first place! Apparently, not\neverybody is able to do that. If you can indeed switch voluntarily between the 2D and 3D awarenesses, you\nare ready to experiment with the experiences that we believe induced our ``average observer'' to do what\nshe did.\ncloser to frontal, which is the conventional ``effect.'' One might guess that the effect would\nperhaps not be 100% and that Lord Kitchener might look slightly over your right shoulder.\nHowever, the opposite is the case. Lord Kitchener looks slightly over your left shoulder.\nLikewise, with the wall facing left, the gaze is over your right shoulder. We offer no\nexplanation, but this finding probably reflects the ``illusion'' described by Wollaston in 1824.\nOther relevant structures in the data derive from inter-individual differences as well as\nidiosyncratic uncertainties and even apparent contradictions in the introspective reports. We\ncan do this because the reports were severely straitjacketed (Experiment I) or framed in terms\nof quantitative indications of slant or gaze directions (Experiment II). The fact that we have a\nlarge number of participants enables us to collect various statistically significant inferences.\nThe inter-individual differences in the effect of monocular stereopsis (Fact II.11) are fully\nto be expected in the light of many previous findings. That a fairly large fraction of the\ngeneric population might have weak or perhaps even no monocular stereopsis is hardly a\nsurprise either. From considerable experience over an extended period, we estimate that\nperhaps a third of the generic population may lack a fully articulated monocular stereopsis\nThe effects found in this study are perhaps best understood by speculating that the\npresentations in visual awareness are composed in mutually distinct spatial frameworks. The\nframework that has the frame is pictorial space, which has a third dimension, depth, whereas\nthe framework that has the face, or the smiley, is the visual field, which lacks the third\ndimension. That the face would be put in the visual field makes some sense because there\nare no strong cues that would suggest the opposite. This is different for the frame, which\nFigure 17. Top: Comparison of the main results for the three groups. Colors as in Figure 12 (left). The top\nand bottom of the gray region indicate the average slant simulated by the graphics. All groups underestimate\nthese, albeit by different amounts. The whisker-box graphics indicate the quartiles and the 10% and 90%\nquantiles. The group of nai\n\u00a8ve observers has perhaps a somewhat larger spread, but the difference is slight. All\ngroups reveal the same pattern. Bottom: The ellipses visualize the aspect ratio changes for the three groups\n(median and quartile range). They are also very similar.\nKoenderink et al. 25\nchanges periodically between a rectangle and a trapezoid. The changes of the face are\npreferably presented as a simple 2D deformation, whereas those of the frame are more\neconomically presented as due to perspective in 3D. What is conceptually striking here is\nthat the presentations can ``split'' the material they present between distinct frameworks and\napply distinct cues to each.\nFinal Conclusions\nWe investigated the familiar phenomenon of the uncanny feeling that represented people in\nfrontal pose invariably appear to ``face you'' from wherever you stand. We deployed two\ndifferent methods.\nThe stimuli included the conventional one--a flat portrait rocking back and forth about a\nvertical axis--augmented with two novel variations. In one alternative, the portrait frame\nrotates whereas the actual portrait stays motionless and fronto-parallel and in the other, we\nreplace the (flat!) portrait with a volumetric object. These variations yield exactly the same\noptical stimulation in frontal view, but become grossly different in very oblique views. We\nalso let participants sample their momentary awareness through ``gauge object'' settings in\nstatic displays.\nFrom our results, we conclude that the psychogenesis of visual awareness maintains a\nnumber--at least two, but most likely more--of distinct spatial frameworks simultaneously\ninvolving ``cue\u00adscission.'' Cues may be effective in one of these spatial frameworks but\nineffective or functionally different in other ones.\n"
