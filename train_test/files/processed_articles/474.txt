Both field and animal studies have suggested a possibility that persistent\nlipophilic chemicals like OC pesticides can cause vitamin D deficiency, but there have been no human studies of exposure to\nany chemical as a possible cause of vitamin D deficiency. This study was performed to examine if serum concentrations of\nOC pesticides were associated with serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in the U.S. general population.\nMethodology/Principal Findings: Cross-sectional associations of serum OC pesticides with serum 25(OH)D were\nwith serum 25(OH)D levels. When study subjects were stratified by age, race, and the presence of various chronic diseases,\np,p9-DDT showed consistent inverse associations in all subgroups, although stronger associations tended to be observed\namong subjects with old age, white race, or chronic diseases.\nConclusion/Significance: The current study suggests that the background exposure to some OC pesticides leads to vitamin\nD deficiency in human. Considering the importance of vitamin D deficiency in the development of chronic diseases,\nchemical exposure as a possible cause of vitamin D deficiency should be evaluated in prospective and experimental studies.\nCitation: Yang J-H, Lee Y-M, Bae S-G, Jacobs DR Jr, Lee D-H (2012) Associations between Organochlorine Pesticides and Vitamin D Deficiency in the U.S.\nEditor: Yiqing Song, Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Harvard Medical School, United States of America\nCopyright: \u00df 2012 Yang et al.

Jacobs Jr.3,4, Duk-Hee Lee1*\n1 Department of Preventative Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea, 2 Department of Occupational Medicine, CHA Gumi Medical\nCenter, CHA University, Gumi, Korea, 3 Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America,\n4 Department of Nutrition, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway\n Introduction\nIn the past, the major health problems resulting from vitamin D\ndeficiency were rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults [1].\nRecently there has been intense interest in the role of vitamin D in\na variety of nonskeletal medical conditions. Indeed, vitamin D\ndeficiency has been associated with increases in cardiovascular\ndisease, cancer, and infection [1]. At present, despite controversy\nover the definition of vitamin D deficiency, insufficient serum\nvitamin D levels is very common in the general population [2,3].\nRecently, vitamin D supplementation has been recommended and\nwidely applied with the intention of preventing many diseases\nrelated to vitamin D deficiency [4,5].\nSunlight exposure is the primary determinant of vitamin D\nstatus in humans. Therefore, the control against sun exposure\nthrough avoidance and sun protection has been regarded as a\nmain cause of increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency [6]. In\naddition, decreased outdoor activity and obesity has been also\nassociated with vitamin D deficiency [6].\nTo our best knowledge, there have been no studies of exposure\nto any chemical as a possible cause of vitamin D deficiency in\nhuman. However, there was an interesting field study which\nobserved clear inverse associations of hepatic load of DDT and\npolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with circulating 1,25-dihydrox-\nyvitamin D3\nD) status in grey seals in the Baltic Sea [7].\nDDT and PCBs are chemicals which are Persistent Organic\nPollutants (POPs). POPs include a variety of chemicals such as\npolychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated di-\nbenzofurans (PCDFs), PCBs, and organochlorines (OC) pesticides,\nand have common properties like resistance to environmental\ndegradation, lipophilicity, and bioaccumulation in food chain.\nSupporting the observation from the field study, a couple of\nanimal studies reported that the exposure to PCBs decreased levels\nIn fact, there has been emerging evidence strong relations\nbetween the background exposure to POPs and various diseases\nincluding type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases\nthat exposure to POPs can affect metabolism of vitamin D,\nbecause vitamin D is a hormone.\nThis study was performed to examine if serum concentrations of\nPOPs were associated with serum concentrations of 25-hydro-\nxyvitamin D (25-(OH)D) in the U.S. general population, as\nrepresented in subsamples of the National Health and Examina-\nvarious kinds of POPs, there was no reportable association with\nPOPs belonging to subclasses of PCDDs, PCDFs, and PCBs. As\nonly POPs belonging to OC pesticides showed interesting\nassociations with serum concentrations of 25-(OH)D, we report\nresults on OC pesticides here.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy subjects\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) was designed to be nationally representative of\nthe non-institutionalized U.S. population. This report is a cross-\nwere interviewed, and 9,643 were examined in the Mobile\nExamination Center (MEC). OC pesticides were measured in\npersons aged 20 or more, the final sample size was 1,275 after\nexcluding pregnant women and subjects without information on\nOC pesticides and serum vitamin D levels. The study protocol was\nreviewed and approved by the CDC institutional review board;\nadditionally, informed written consent was obtained from all\nsubjects before they took part in the study.\nMeasurements\nVenous blood samples were collected in the MEC and shipped\nweekly to laboratories at 220uC. Thirteen organochlorine\npesticides were measured in serum by high-resolution gas\nchromatography/isotope-dilution high-resolution mass spectrom-\netry (HRGC/ID-HRMS). We selected the 7 organochlorine\npesticides for which at least 80% of study subjects had\nconcentrations.LOD; p,p9-DDE, p,p9-DDT, b-hexachlorocyclo-\nhexane, Dieldrin, Hexachlorobenzene, Oxychlordane, and Trans-\nnonachlor.\nSerum 25-(OH)D was measured by the Diasorin 25-(OH)D\nassay, which consists of a two-step procedure. The first procedure\nis an extraction of 25-(OH)D and other hydroxylated metabolites\nfrom serum, followed by an equilibrium Radioimmunoassay (RIA)\nprocedure based on a specific antibody to 25-(OH)D.\nStatistical analyses\nAdjusted means of serum 25-(OH)D levels across 5 categories of\nserum concentrations of POPs were examined by General Linear\nModels. Serum concentrations of OC pesticides were categorized\ninto quintiles and the last quintile was further divided into two\ngroups using the median values of each OC pesticides as OC\npesticides showed very right-skewed distributions. We also used\nsummary measure of OC pesticides by summing individual rank of\neach OC pesticide and the sum was categorized using the same\nmethod as with the individual OC pesticides. Serum 25-(OH)D\nlevels were log transformed because they also showed a right-\nskewed distribution. In addition, we used General Additive Models\nto check the possibility of a non-linear spline across the whole\nrange of serum concentrations of OC pesticides.\nAdjusting variables were sex, age (years), race, body mass index\n(continuous), smoking status (never, former, current), outdoor\nactivities (continuous, total frequency of walked or bicycled as part\nof getting to and from work, or school, or to do errands per day\nduring recent 1 month), and vitamin D supplementation\n(continuous, total amount of vitamin D intake by supplement\nduring recent 1 month).\nAs POPs levels were very different depending on age or race,\nstratified analyses by age (,60 vs. $60 years) or race (white vs.\nnon-white) were performed to see if there were consistent patterns.\nIn addition, we also performed stratified analyses by the status of\npresence of self-reported common chronic diseases (coronary heart\ndiseases, angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, stroke, emphy-\nsema, bronchitis, chronic liver diseases, thyroid diseases, cancer,\nhypertension, diabetes, or kidney diseases) because serum\nconcentrations of vitamin D are associated with various clinical\nconditions.\nAll statistical analyses were performed with SAS 9.1 and\nSUDAAN 9.0. Estimates of main results were calculated\naccounting for stratification and clustering [14], adjusting for\nage, race and ethnicity, and poverty income ratio instead of using\nsample weights; this adjustment has been regarded as a good\ncompromise between efficiency and bias [14,15]. As results were\nvery similar with SAS 9.1 and SUDAAN 9.0, we present the\nresults based on SAS 9.1.\nResults\n52.9% non-Hispanic white. Table 1 summarizes the distribution of\ndemographics, health behaviors, and other characteristics by\nquintiles of p,p9-DDT, one of OC pesticides which showed\nstrongest associations with serum 25-(OH)D level. Subjects with\nhigh serum concentrations of p,p9-DDT were older, more obese,\nnon-white race, and non-smoker, compared with those with low\nserum concentrations of p,p9-DDT. They had also higher\nprevalence of hypertension or diabetes. Other OC pesticides\nshowed similar associations with covariates as did p,p9-DDT (data\nnot shown).\nTable 1.

Based on beta-\ncofficients, the stronger associations were observed with p,p9-DDT\nand b-hexachlorocyclohexane rather than p,p-DDE. When we\nused the summary measure of 3 OC pesticides which showed\nsignificant inverse associations, the strength of association seemed\nto be a little stronger than individual OC pesticides.\nWhen study subjects were stratified by age, race, and the\npresence of various chronic diseases, p,p9-DDT showed consistent\ninverse associations in all subgroups (Table 3). However, stronger\nassociations tend to be observed among subjects at least 60 years\nold or having chronic disease, although none of the p values for\ninteraction reached statistical significance. Similar to the results for\np,p9-DDT, both p,p-DDE and b-hexachlorocyclohexane showed\nsignificant or marginally significant inverse associations with serum\n25-(OH)D levels only among older subjects or those with chronic\ndisease.\nWhen we fitted non-linear relationships, the U-shaped pattern\nwas observed with p,p9-DDT (Figure 1). Even though the\nassociation between p,p9-DDT and 25-(OH)D appeared to be\nlinear when we used the traditional quintile approach, the linear\ninverse association persisted only until about 200 ng/g lipid of\nFigure 1). For higher values, 25-(OH)D appeared to increase,\nmaking the U-shaped association.\nDiscussion\nIn this cross-sectional study, we observed significant inverse\nassociations between serum concentrations of several OC\npesticides, p,p9-DDT, p,p9-DDE, and b-hexachlorocyclohexane,\nand serum 25-(OH)D levels among the U.S. general population.\nTo our best knowledge, this is the first study that linked OC\npesticides and serum 25-(OH)D levels in human.\nIn fact, both POPs like OC pesticides and vitamin D deficiency\nhave been associated with a variety of chronic diseases in general\npopulations, but these two important factors have been separately\nstudied by researchers in different fields. As field and animal\nstudies observed that the exposure to POPs can disturb the\nmetabolism of vitamin D [7,8,9], we hypothesized that a similar\npattern existed in human.\nIn fact, there were strong positive correlations among serum\nconcentrations of p,p9-DDT, p,p9-DDE, and b-hexachlorocyclo-\nhexachlorocyclohexane = +0.56; p,p9-DDE vs. b-hexachlorocyclo-\nhexane = +0.66). Compared with other OC pesticides evaluated in\nthis study, serum concentrations of these three OC pesticides were\nmore strongly correlated with each other in this population.\nTherefore, even if there is a causal relationship between vitamin D\nconcentration and one or more POPs, it is difficult to know if all 3\nTable 2.

Therefore, even though DDT was\nbanned several decades ago in most developed countries, nearly all\nU.S. residents have substantial amounts of p,p9-DDE in their\nbodies. This persisting exposure is owing to the extreme stability of\np,p9-DDE and continuous exposure to p,p9-DDE through food\nconsumption, because our current food chain on earth is seriously\ncontaminated with POPs [17]. In this study, stronger and more\nconsistent patterns were observed with p,p-DDT in subgroup\nanalyses as well as analyses based on all subjects than p,p9-DDE.\nImportantly, DDT is still used for malaria control in Central\nAmerica, South America, Mexico, Africa and some developing\ncountries in Asia [18]. It may explain why non-white race had a\nhigher concentration of DDT compared with white race.\nb-hexachlorocyclohexane is an isomer of technical hexachloro-\ncyclohexane and byproduct of the production of the insecticide\nLindane [19]. Technical hexachlorocyclohexane and Lindane\nwere among the most extensively used OC pesticides produced\nmainly after the Second World War until the 1990s [20]. They\nhave not been produced in the U.S. since 1976, but imported\nLindane is available as insecticide or prescription medicine to treat\nscabies and head lice in humans [19]. Even though India is the\nonly country known where Lindane is currently produced, some\ndeveloping countries had produced Lindane until very recently\nIn fact, it is well-known that chronic exposure to DDT causes\nthin avian egg shells which is one factor in the decrease in\npopulation of certain avian species [22]. Thinning egg shells is\nclosely related to calcium metabolism which is largely regulated by\ntwo steroids, estradiol and vitamin D [22]. Although it has long\nbeen suspected that DDT disturbs the metabolism of vitamin D,\nearly experimental studies in 1960s or 70s failed to show that DDT\nHowever, this issue needs to be reevaluated with low doses of\nDDT similar to environmental exposure because the doses of\nDDT used in early experimental studies were very high. If DDT\ndisturbs hormone metabolism, including vitamin D, this distur-\nbance would likely happen due to endocrine disrupting properties\nrather than toxicity of DDT. In the case of endocrine disruptors,\ndose-response curves are often nonmonotonic and low dose levels\nare more relevant to biological effects than high dose levels [26]. In\nour previous epidemiological studies on POPs in relation to\nvarious chronic diseases, we have observed apparent low dose\neffects of POPs. POPs could be involved in the pathogenesis of\nthese diseases through endocrine disrupting properties of POPs\nThe results based on traditional linear modeling and category\napproaches showed a decrease of vitamin D mainly among\nsubjects with the upper 10% of p,p-DDT with the significant p\nvalue for linear trend, However, when we fitted the dataset using a\nTable 3.

The decrease of vitamin D was\nmainly observed up until the subjects had p,p9-DDT of 200 ng/g\nlipid, above which vitamin D showed an increasing trend with the\nincrease of p,p9-DDT. As p,p9-DDT had a very skewed\ndistribution, the interquartile range of p,p9-DDT was only\nTherefore, the increasing trend of vitamin D was mainly driven by\nonly a very small number of subjects with very high p,p9-DDT in\nthis sample who had largely background exposure to the pesticide.\nSimilar to our previous findings on POPs [11,13], this kind of\ndose-response relation may be explained by endocrine disrupting\nproperties of p,p9-DDT. However, the possibility of increasing\ntrend of vitamin D among persons with high p,p9-DDT needs to\nbe confirmed in further studies with sufficient sample sizes.\nThere are several limitations. First of all, we cannot rule out\nreverse causality as this study is cross-sectional. However, we are\nnot aware of mechanisms whereby higher vitamin D level would\nhelp to clear serum concentrations of OC pesticides. Also, field\nfindings on POPs and vitamin D levels suggest the possibility that\nOC pesticides influence vitamin D metabolism. Second, serum\nconcentrations of 25(OH)D are affected by sunlight exposure, and\nvary by season, time of outdoor activity, and residence latitude.\nSerum concentrations of 25(OH)D are highest in the summer and\nthe fall and are lowest in the spring. This seasonal variation limits\nthe usefulness of single measurements, and requires an average\nconcentration throughout the year or at least a seasonal\nadjustment. Unfortunately, we could not make seasonal adjust-\nments or adjust for residence latitude. However, a couple of studies\non variation of OC pesticides by region in the U.S. reported the\norder of concentrations of p,p9-DDE by West.South.Mid-\nwest.Northeast, reflecting the history of the geographic manu-\nfacture and use of these chemicals [27,28]. Therefore, the failure\nof adjusting for living area may lead to underestimation of the\nassociation between OC pesticide and vitamin D levels as subjects\nwith high exposure to sunshine are likely to have high exposure to\nOC pesticides. Finally, we could not exclude the possibility that\nother POPs not measured in this study could play a role in the\npathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, because serum concentrations of\nPOPs are highly correlated in the general population.\nIf the associations observed here were causal, as evidenced by\nconfirmation in prospective and experimental studies, avoiding\nexposure to OC pesticides and any efforts to decrease body burden\nof OC pesticides may be helpful to increase vitamin D levels and\ndecrease vitamin D deficiency-related diseases. There may be\nFigure 1. Spline regression of serum concentration of p,p9-DDT on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels (ng/ml).
