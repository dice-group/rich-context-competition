    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe signs of mating competition are written into the physiology of the human male, but they are not written equally into the\nphysiology of all racial groupings of human males. It seems that Asian males are different, different in that they are more fully\ndissimilar from the gorilla than are other races, showing less sexual dimorphism, muscularity, and less marked secondary\nsexual characteristics, and different in that they are more fully dissimilar from the chimpanzee than are other races, showing\nless sexual drive and activity as well as smaller testicles and lower sperm counts. It is presently argued that such anatomical\ndifferences are a testament to a more peaceably monogamous mating history. In turn, it is then argued that such physiological\nmarkers are directly associated with the collectivist ethos that has been historically, anthropologically, and sociologically\nobserved among the Asian people.\n",

I see an innumerable multitude of men, alike and equal,\nconstantly circling around in pursuit of the petty and banal\npleasures with which they glut their souls. Each of them\nwithdrawn into himself, is almost unaware of the fate of the rest.\nMankind, for him, consists in his children and his personal\nfriends. As for the rest of his fellow citizens, they are near\nenough, but he does not notice them. He touches them but feels\nnothing. He exists in and for himself, and though he still may\nhave a family, one can at least say that he has not got a fatherland.\nThese individualistic Anglo-American values are repre-\nsentative, not only of England and the United States, but of\nthe West more generally.\nAlternatively, collectivism, associated with the East, most\nspecifically the Asian cultures of China and Japan, \"favours\nmaintenance of social harmony over assertion of individual-\nity\" (Chiao & Blizinsky, 2010). Collectivism stresses com-\nmunion and interconnectedness above competition and\nindependence, as expressed in sport (Reid, 2010), economics\n(Dowdle, Gillespie, & Maher, 2013), management (Brew &\nYee, & Eastman, 1995), philosophical writings (Markus &\nmoral judgment (Fu et al., 2010), historical narratives\n(Imada, 2012), phenomenological apperception (Gudykunst,\nMatsumoto, Ting-Toomey, & Nishida, 1996; Lee, Beckert, &\nresolution (Ohbuchi, Sato, & Tedeschi, 1999; P.

Yang\ndichotomy between individualistic and collectivistic cultures\nis so thoroughly discussed as to be assumed a hackneyed\nheuristic or an antiquated artifact of social science texts.\nTruly, however, it is neither one nor the other. In spite of\ngeneral critiques (Takano & Osaka, 1999) and allegations of\nbinary simplicity (Briley & Wyer, 2001; Mateo, Cabanis,\nStenmanns, & Krach, 2013; Oyserman, Coon, &\nKemmelmeier, 2002), the individualism/collectivism dichot-\nomy is a well-supported division between Western and\nEastern styles of thinking, living, socializing, and being,\nseriously considered and actively generating research\n(Fijneman, Willemsen, & Poortinga, 1996; Rhee, Uleman, &\nerative research topic in cross-cultural psychology (Conway,\nHouck, & Gornick, 2014). Although widely documented,\nthis dichotomy is not well explained. As Chiao and Blizinsky\ngin of individualistic and collectivistic cultural values has\nlargely remained elusive.\"\nCulture: Autonomous Force or Biological\nOutgrowth?\nCollectivist culture, like culture generally, has historically\ndefied explanation because it is most often treated as a fully\nautonomous force with no identifiable antecedent.\nRepresentative of this view is renowned anthropologist and\nauthor of Primitive Society (Lowie, 1920) and Social\nlecture on Culture and Ethnology, asserted that \"culture is a\nthing sui generis which can be explained only in terms of\nstill prevalent view, now embodied in the Durkheim and Boaz\nadvanced the idea that culture is on the leash of the gene. In\nother words, cultural diversity is chained to evolved biology.\nWilson's quip is generally invoked to illustrate the functional\nsimilarities behind seemingly irreconcilable cultural practices.\nIn this way, the contemporary American male buying, driving,\nand polishing an expensive car is akin to a 19th-century\nArgentinian Hussar twisting his mustachios and pruning his\nepaulettes, which is, in turn, akin to an 18th-century English\naristocrat donning a powdered wig, stockings, and silver shoe\nbuckles. In all cases, these trappings and actions function as\ndisplay, advertising status to rival males and potential mates.\nEven though the surface features of these behaviors vary\ngreatly, their underlying motivation is the same. From this per-\nspective then, biology constrains cultural practices, such that\nevery culture has religion and religious institutions, law and\nsystems of justice, and marriage with associated rituals, all of\nwhich vary cross-culturally more in form than function.Yet, if,\nas Wilson states, evolved similarities give rise to cultural\nsimilarities, then shouldn't evolved dissimilarities give rise to\ncultural dissimilarities? If we encounter biological variation\nacross races,1 should we not question whether these gave rise\nto cultural dissimilarities?\nPurpose of the Present Article\nWe find such racial dissimilarities across anatomical and\nbehavioral characteristics of the Asian peoples, especially\nthe Chinese2 and Japanese. As differentiated from Caucasian\nand Africans, for example, Asians differ dramatically in sec-\nondary sexual characteristics, such as aggression, and sexual\ndimorphism, and they seem also to differ in testes weight,\nsexual activity, and sexual drive. It is the purpose of the pres-\nent article to review these intraspecific biological differences\nacross racial groupings, as they relate to interspecific bio-\nlogical differences across primates species. After extrapolat-\ning from animal models, the present work thereafter argues\nthat Asian biology minimizes mating competition, promot-\ning a more peaceable monogamous mating style, which, in\nturn, provided a biological substrate out of which collectiv-\nism could grow.\nOvert and Covert Signatures of Mating\nCompetition\nAll competition is resource competition. There are two\nclasses of resources: those which perpetuate the life of the\norganism and those which perpetuate the lineage of the\norganism. Clearly, animals compete for survival alone, as\nmany clonal species vie vigorously for space and food\n(Jackson & Coates, 1986). However, recombinatory repro-\nduction augments competition, adding sexual selection to\nnatural selection and buffeting organisms between the two.\nAs Butovskaya and Kozintsev (1999) stated, \"while females\ncompete for resources, they themselves are the main resource\nand the main object of competition for males\" (p. 262).\nThrough the mechanism of sexual selection, mating competi-\n& Kokko, 2010), generating some of the most conspicuous\nphenomena in nature: the exhausting and unending croak of\nthe bioluminescent flash of the firefly3 (Lewis & Cratsley,\nrecurved horns of the ibex, the elongated canine of the boar\n(Jennings & Gammell, 2013), the major cheliped claw of the\nfiddler crab (Briffa, 2013), as well as the horns and mandi-\nbles of beetles (Snell-Rood & Moczek, 2013).4 Likewise, the\nmarks of competition between males for females resulted in\nthe evolution of the dewlap of the lizard indicating bite force\n(Earley & Hsu, 2013), the comb of the rooster, honestly sig-\nnaling physical condition and testosterone levels (Pryke,\n2013), the lekking parade and plumage display of the sage-\ngrouse, advertising high genetic quality and low parasite\nload (Harrell, 2008), and the bellowing of the buck during\nthe annual rut, simultaneously indicating dominance to rivals\nand fitness to females (Jennings & Gammell, 2013). These\nare the subjects of nature documentaries, the sources of\ninspiration to aspiring biologists, and the spur to research\nstudies and conservation efforts.\nHowever, there is another world of competition between\nthe seminal discharges of males in the vaginal tracts of\nfemales: copulatory plugs, tandem sperm, capacitated sperm,\nhorn-like structures to reposition rival sperm, penile flagella\nto displace rival sperm, parasperm used to cheaply fill repro-\nductive tracts, and accessory gland proteins that manipulate\nfemales into laying more eggs and avoid remating (Arnqvist\nmales of some species are equipped with antiaphrodisiac gas\n(Price, 1999), enlarged testes, and short and muscular vas\ndeferens (A. F. Dixson, 2009), among other emblems of fur-\ntive competition. So there is overt competition and covert\ncompetition, sometimes, respectively, referred to as somatic\nand genital selection (Suonr, 1979). These forms of selec-\ntion, of course, act on primate species to varying degrees:\nOvert competition, exemplified among apes by the gorilla,\nmarks a polygamous mating style; whereas covert competi-\ntion, exemplified among apes by the chimpanzee, marks a\npromiscuous mating style. Armed with this dichotomy and\nthese primate models, it is instructive to view humans and\nhuman racial variation.\nGorilla gorilla: The Signature of\nPolygamy\nThe gorilla is the primate exemplar of polygamy, carrying\nmany markers of overt, somatic mating competition. With\ngroups of around eight (Parnell, 2002) often containing a\nsingle breeding male (Margulis, Whitham, & Ogorzalek,\n2003), reproductive success pivots on the ability to obtain\nand maintain a harem (Breuer et al., 2010). Massive heads\nwith prominent fatty ridges and resonating air pockets that\nundergird the oft-beat chest may be unique markers of polyg-\namy among gorillas (Breuer, Robbins, & Boesch, 2007);\nalthough, in addition to such stylized symbols, gorillas pos-\nsess the sexually dimorphic pelage variation, which signals\nintra-male polygamous conflict (Plavcan, 2001). In fact, the\ngorilla is the most dichromatic of all the primates, with the\nfemales possessing muted colors and the males possessing a\npronounced sagittal crest of silver gray (Breuer et al., 2007).\nAbove all else, the gorilla's high male mass is the most con-\nspicuous signature of polygamy. Heavily muscled and\naggressively territorial, the gorilla is not only the largest of\nextant primates, it is the most sexually dimorphic (Taylor,\n1997). By way of distinction, the enlargement of the male\nabove and beyond the female is not a feature of those pri-\nmates considered paradigms of monogamy: Indri, Aotus,\nCallicebus, Callithrix, Saguinus, Hylobates (A. F. Dixson,\namous primate species, males collectively weigh 662.7 kg,\nwhereas their female counterparts collectively weigh\nmates weighed 521.5 kg, whereas their female counterparts\nweighedonly310.9kg.Thedisparityisblatant.Quantification\nyields a body weight ratio of 1.04 across monogamous pri-\nmates and a body weight ratio of 1.68 across polygamous\ncomparisons show that monogamous primate species contain\nmales and females that are essentially the same weight,\nwhereas polygamous primate species contain males that are\noften more than 50% heavier than females. From such data\ncomes the zoological dictum, holding that \"the more females\nper male in the breeding group, the larger the male is in rela-\ntion to the female\" (Davies et al., 2012, p. 35). Similarly,\nWilson (2004) stated that, \"the average number of females\nconsorting with successful males closely corresponds to the\nsize gap between males and females when many species are\nconsidered together\" (p. 20).\nWith these correlates in mind, it is instructive to view human\ndata. Based on a cross-racial estimate of A. F. Dixson's (2012),\nHomo sapiens have a male\u00adfemale body weight ratio of 1.21.\nJudging from this sex-based weight disparity, polygamy\nappears to play both a moderate historical and contemporary\nrole in human mating--an assumption corroborated by anthro-\npological data, such as Ford and Beach's classic 1951 study\nsuggesting that more than 80% of cultures sanction polygamy\n(A. F. Dixson, 2012). So humans, by this standard, and when\ntaken as an undifferentiated population, seem to be far from the\npolygamous gorilla, but still about a third of the way in that\ndirection. Now to address pertinent racial particularities: It is\nclear that, when collapsing across both sexes, Asian popula-\ntions are smaller and lighter than, for example, Caucasian and\nAfrican populations (Deurenberg-Yap, Schmidt, van Staveren,\n& Deurenberg, 2000). Moreover, Asians appear to show a\nsomewhat less pronounced size dimorphism: For example,\nand a mean of 64.6 kg for males within a Chinese sample, cre-\nating a ratio of 1.19, somewhat below the cross-racial average\nof 1.21 reported by A. F. Dixson. This size dimorphism dispar-\nity, however, becomes more pronounced when looking at body\ncomposition specifically, as opposed to body weight generally.\nBy most measures and in most studies, Asian samples,\nwhen compared with Caucasian samples, have more fat and\nless muscle (Deurenberg, Deurenberg-Yap, & Guricci,\n2002). Again, compared with Caucasians, Asians have\ngreater bicep, abdomen, superilliac, and subscapular skin\nfold thickness (J. Wang et al., 1994).Alternatively, Caucasian\nmen show higher ratios of fat-free mass on the arms, thighs,\nand trunk, than Asian men. Furthermore, on these same mea-\nsures, Asian men are separated from Asian women less\nwidely than Caucasian men are separated from Caucasian\nwomen (J. Wang et al., 1994). What is perhaps of most acute\ninterest is that Asian men have body mass indexes (BMIs)\nthat remain essentially the same across the adult life span.\nGallagher et al. (2000) reported that Asian male BMI was an\n4 SAGE Open\nthat there is little difference between young men in their peak\nreproductive years and aged men in their post-reproductive\nyears. In contrast, Caucasian BMI follows a different devel-\nranges. One interpretation of these data is that Asians show a\nhigh BMI throughout development, but Caucasians, being\nmore pressured by mating competition, show a lower BMI\nthat only approaches Asian levels in the post-reproductive\nyears when mating competition has waned.\nWhile gross measurement of weight is instructive, direct\nmeasurement of muscle mass is more so (A. F. Dixson,\n2009). As compared with weight ratios of approximately\nbecause human females are singular among primates in their\nhigh degree of adipose tissue storage; consequently, the\nextent of human sexual dimorphism becomes evident only\nafter controlling for this by looking specifically at ratios of\nmale to female muscle mass (Puts, 2010). Moreover, male/\nfemale differences in muscle mass come principally from\nmales possessing more fast-twitch muscle, which is the type\nof muscle that adds visible bulk and anaerobically enables\nshort-lived explosions of speed and power. The effect of this\nis to endow the average man with 90% more upper body\nstrength than the average woman (Puts, 2010). But fast-\ntwitch muscle fiber is metabolically costly, exacting great\namounts of nutrition in both its production and maintenance.\nEver thrifty, the evolution of such a costly trait will not pro-\nceed without need. Females serve as the single most viable\nbenchmark of how much fast-twitch fiber a species needs for\nsurvival. Even male/female division of labor, such as the\ncommon hunting versus gathering dichotomy, should not be\nexpected to drive males far beyond females in terms of fast-\ntwitch muscle fiber mass. This is especially true because, in\nhunting, humans do not regularly use fast-twitch muscle to\noverwhelm their prey with superior strength, or outstrip them\nwith superior speed; rather, humans rely much more on intel-\nligence, collective action, and weapons technologies, trap-\nping and ambush (Bunn & Pickering, 2010). In fact, to the\ndegree that muscle was necessary for successful hunting,\nslow-twitch muscle might have been more important than\nfast-twitch muscle fiber. This conclusion comes from studies\nof modern hunter-gathers, such as the bushmen of the\nKalahari desert, who often employ persistence hunting,\nwhich entails tailing prey for extremely long distances until\nit becomes exhausted (Liebenberg, 2006). In contrast to fast-\ntwitch muscle, slow-twitch muscle, enabling protracted\nrepetitive motion, does not effectively separate men from\nwomen, such that female ultra-endurance swimmers\n(Eichenberger et al., 2012) and female ultra-endurance run-\noften perform nearly as well as their male counterparts. In\nences in musculature are not a product of male\u00adfemale\ndivision of labor, but of male\u00admale contest competition\n2010). In this light, it is of utmost relevance that \"sex differ-\nence in upper-body muscle mass in humans is similar to the\nsex difference in fat-free mass in gorillas,\" which suggest an\nevolutionary history of male rivalry for female access (Puts,\nHaving established the extent and significance of muscle,\nespecially of the fast-twitch variety, it is instructive to exam-\nine racial variation. This most sensitive marker of polygamy\nhighlights the extent of extant racial differences. Just as\ndecreased emphasis on the explosiveness of fast-twitch mus-\ncle greatly diminishes the performance gap between males\nand females, so it lessens the performance gap between Asian\nand non-Asian males. Chinese runners, for example, rarely if\never win gold medals except in endurance competitions\nslow-twitch muscle. It seems that Asian populations have less\nfat-free mass (Hull et al., 2011) and significantly less fast-\ntwitch skeletal muscle fiber (Rushton, 2000; Silva et al.,\n2010). Furthermore, not only do Asian men have less visible\nbulk, butAsian women may prefer less visible bulk.As a gen-\neral rule, females prefer males of the muscular mesomorphic\ntype. However, the ectomorphic male, one who is skinny and\nless muscled, obtained proportionally higher ratings among\nChinese samples (A. F. Dixson, 2009). Chinese women pre-\nferred average physiques to mesomorphic physiques, whereas\nBritish women, for instance, preferred mesomorphic phy-\nsiques to average physiques. Therefore, the mesomorphic\nphysique might be largely a product of sexual selection, gen-\nerated and perpetuated through the mechanisms of male com-\npetition and female choice (A. F. Dixson, 2009; B. J. Dixson,\nDixson, Li, & Anderson, 2007). Furthermore, data on Asian\nmuscle mass are complemented by genetics studies:\nImproving sprint performance, showing correlations with\nmuscle mass (Berman & North, 2010), conferring speed and\nvelocity (N.Yang et al., 2003), and being commonly described\nas a gene for speed (Berman & North, 2010; MacArthur &\nNorth, 2004), ACTN3 is specifically expressed in fast-twitch\nskeletal muscles (Lachance & Tishkoff, 2013; Norman et al.,\nhighest rates of -actinin-3-deficient genotype (577XX), as\ncompared with Caucasian and African samples (N. Yang\nFinally, there are two more corroborating points of evi-\ndence. First, as compared with Caucasian and African males,\nAsian males have longer life spans, and, according to A. F.\nDixson (2009), shortened male life span is possibly a product\nof the taxing nature of male\u00admale competition in the matrix\nof polygamous mating systems. Second, body hair is an\nimportant and prominent secondary sexual characteristic of\nwhich Asians have less (Ewing & Rouse, 1978; Montagna &\ndo Asian men have less body hair (Ewing & Rouse, 1978),\nbut Asian women, judging from a Chinese sample, seem to\nprefer less body hair (A. F. Dixson, 2009). Importantly, the\nbeard is not excepted; Asian men have appreciably less facial\nBeards, described by B. J. Dixson and Vasey (2012) as \"strik-\ningly sexually dimorphic androgen-dependent secondary\nsexual trait in humans,\" seem to signal status, dominance, and\naggressiveness (Addison, 1989; A. F. Dixson, Dixson, &\nAnderson, 2005), and in fact evolved \"primarily via intrasex-\nual selection between males\" (B. J. Dixson & Vasey, 2012).\nPan troglodytes: The Signature of\nPromiscuity\nThe chimpanzee is the primate exemplar of promiscuity, car-\nrying many markers of covert mating competition. Certainly,\nthere are attempts by males to impede matings by other\nmales, both by harassment and active interruption of coitus\nbefore insemination (A. F. Dixson, 2012), but there are no\nproprietary rights to females, no pair bonding, and no harem\nformation. The promiscuity of chimpanzees, who live in\nmulti-male/multi-female troops, is well documented. Similar\nto Papio ursinus and Brachyteles arachnoides, chimpanzee\nfemales are mounted and mated by several males, sometimes\nMultiple matings with multiple males over a discreet period\ncreates the conditions for sperm competition (A. F. Dixson &\nAnderson, 2004), such that a contest is carried out by proxy\nthrough sperm within the reproductive apparatus of the\nfemale chimpanzee. In consequence, male chimpanzees bear\nthe marks of sperm competition, principally by virtue of their\nlarge testes, which, in combination, rival the mass and vol-\nume of the brain. Compared with the polygamous gorilla,\nchimpanzee testes are 4 times heavier in absolute terms, and\n16 times heavier relative to body weight (A. F. Dixson,\n2012).Along with large testes, chimpanzees have high sperm\nvolume and high sperm counts. These are widely acknowl-\nedged to be physiological markers of promiscuity.\nAs humans do not show the prodigious sexual dimorphism\nof the gorilla, so they do not show the prodigious virility of\nthe chimpanzee. Still, as before, humans appear to be part of\nthe way in the same direction, though perhaps not progressed\nnearly so far along in that direction. Certainly though, human\ntestes are outsized for the requirements of monogamous mat-\nRhodes, & Peters, 2004). Some think this enlargement is ves-\ntigial and of little consequence (Brown, Shumaker, &\nthink this enlargement is active and exceedingly relevant\nmight be, as A. F. Dixson reasons from comparative analyses\nof human sperm activity, sperm mitochondrial density, sperm\nmid-piece volume, relatively low sperm recovery rates, and\nthe lack of a baculum, that reports of sperm competition are\ngreatly exaggerated; nonetheless, reports of strategic sperm\nShackelford, Goetz, McKibbin, & Starratt, 2007; White,\n1986), as well as prolonged intromission and the relatively\nlarge human penis, both of which are correlated with promis-\ncuity and sperm competition, remain as support, unexplained\nexcept with the recognition of human sperm competition.\nAlso, as Simmons and colleagues (2004) noted, evidence for\nmodest sperm competition comes from approximately 1 in\n400 double paternity dizygotic twins.\nWithout descending into the minutia of this argument, and\nassuming a modest, but relevant, role for human sperm com-\npetition, it is important to examine existing interracial differ-\ncompiled data on testes weight from multiple studies show-\ning that, collapsing across most racial groupings and includ-\ning inhabitants from countries as geographically disparate as\nAustralia and Finland, combined testes weight fluctuates\nbetween 30 and 50 g. All measured countries fall within this\nrange save China, which, according to one sample of 109\nindividuals, showed a mean combined testes weight of 16.55\nwhich showed a mean combined testes weight of 19.01 g (K.\nS. F. Chang, Hsu, Chan, & Chan, 1960). This is a striking\ndifference. A. F. Dixson remarked that \"Nigerian men have\ntestes more than twice as large as those of Hong Kong\nChinese subjects of similar height\" (A. F. Dixson, 2009, p.\n31). Although this is an extreme example, general American\nsamples indicate testicle weight almost twice that of Chinese\nsamples. Furthermore, even though most of the aforemen-\ntioned statistics do not control for body weight, they cannot\nbe explained by it (A. F. Dixson, 2009).\nAsian populations not only have less combined testicular\nmass but a relative reduction in the number and function of\nSertoli cells (Johnson et al., 1998), which reside in the semi-\nniferous tubules and secrete several hormones integral to\nspermatogenesis (Griswold, 1998). Although spermatogene-\nsis is anatomically dependent on Sertoli cells, it is physiolog-\nically dependent on testosterone (Sharpe, 1987; Weinbauer\n& Nieschlag, 1990). Although there are no reliably recorded\nabsolute differences in blood-circulating testosterone (Ewing\n& Rouse, 1978), when compared with Caucasian samples,\nAsian men, but notAsian women, have significantly less pre-\ncursor androgens, such as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate\nand androstenedione (Lookingbill et al., 1991). Furthermore,\nAsian males have less endogenous androgen receptors for\ntestosterone (Zitzmann & Nieschlag, 2001) and possibly also\nless of a particular enzyme requisite for converting testoster-\none into an active form (Greaves, 2001). Therefore, it is not\nsurprising that, following these anatomical and physiological\ndifferences, sperm counts are correspondingly low among\nAsian populations (Iwamoto, Nozawa, & Yoshiike, 2007;\nvon Eckardstein et al., 2001) and sperm production can be\nmore easily arrested with hormonal contraceptive injections\n6 SAGE Open\nReduced sperm production among Asian males has a genetic\nderivative, specifically found in racial variation in the num-\nber of cytosine, adenine, guanine (CAG) repeats (Bennett\nnoted that \"a slight increase in the number of CAG repeat\nsequences in exon 1 of the androgen receptor gene causes\nidiopathic oligozoospermia.\" Both this condition and its\ncause have been implicated in Asian male infertility prob-\nlems (Komori et al., 1999). Finally, racial differences might\nextend beyond spermatogenesis to encompass lower seminal\nfluid volume more generally. Among Asian males, the pros-\ntate, for example, appears to be less active, as judged by\nextremely low rates of prostate cancer (Rushton, 2000;\nSantner et al., 1998). This is significant because prostate can-\ncer and productivity are positively correlated, such that the\nmore metabolically active prostate will at once make its car-\nrier more fecund and prone to cancer (Greaves, 2001). In this\nway, a less active prostate might be a sign of relaxed mating\ncompetition.\nThese anatomical and physiological differences are cou-\npled with behavioral differences. Asian persons appear to be\nless sexually active than either European or African persons\nas judged by pornography usage (Lo, So, & Zhang, 2010),\nreports of sexual fantasy, age of first intercourse, and via per-\ncentage and frequency of pre-marital sexual encounters\n(Rushton, 2000). Furthermore, these racial differences in\npre-marital intercourse are present in post-marital inter-\ncourse, with Asian couples engaging in coitus approximately\nhalf as much as European and African American persons.\nSexual attitudes are also less permissive and feelings of guilt\nare more frequent. Even among Americans, and when con-\ntrolling for the independent effects of socio-economic status,\nAsian Americans have lower rates of divorce, less extramari-\ntal affairs, and fewer out of wedlock births than the national\naverage (Rushton, 1988). Finally, these racially based sexual\ndifferences correlate with extremely low rates of chlamydia,\nsyphilis, HIV, and other sexually transmitted diseases among\nAsians, which can be taken as a crude proxy of sexual behav-\nDiscussion\nIt is very fortunate that humans are as dissimilar from the\ngorilla and chimpanzee as they are. The polygamous mating\nsystem of the gorilla renders dominant harem-holders preoc-\ncupied with defense and subordinate juveniles preoccupied\nwith conquest. This breeds vigilance and anticipation on one\nside, and opportunism and aggression on the other. The young,\nroving male, unencumbered by children and insecure of his\ngenetic future, is a destabilizing force in any society, ape or\nhuman. Alternately, the promiscuous mating system of the\nchimpanzee is distractingly sexual. It encourages physiologi-\ncally taxing and time-consuming mating bouts as well as\nvigilance for, and following of, females in estrous. At the same\ntime, it creates paternal uncertainty and discourages joint\nparental care. Although under recent evolution humans have\nvery likely become less sexually dimorphic and polygamous\nas less sexually virile and promiscuous (Gavrilets, 2012), one\nmight lament that we are not even further away from both the\ngorilla and the chimpanzee so as to be strictly monogamous.7\nFor, in the absence of strict monogamy, not only is there always\nsome degree of male\u00admale competition but also male\u00adfemale\nantagonism, known as sexual conflict, of which infanticide\n(Arnqvist & Rowe, 2005), maternal effect lethals (Perrimon,\nEngstrom, & Mahowald, 1989; Shearn, Hersperger, &\nHersperger, 1978), and parental zygotic conflict (Werren &\nAll such competition, antagonism, and sexual conflict are\ndivisive--it is a spur to violence, if not its principal source.\nAs Gat (2006) said, sexual competition is \"that other princi-\npal source of human competition\" (p. 415). It is not only in\nmyth that a Helen can bring war. Among the much studied\nYanomamo peoples of the Amazonian forest, for example,\nwithin-village violence was most often precipitated by adul-\ntery and women-related quarrels. \"Some incidents were\ncaused by suitors' competition, some by women's abduction\nand forced sex, some by broken promises of marriage, and\nmost, perhaps, by jealous husbands over suspicion of wives'\ninfidelity\" (Gat, 2006, p. 69). In fact, it seems that the first\ninstance of conflict between the New World and the Old\nstemmed from male\u00admale conflict over access to native\nfemales (Landes, 1998). Likewise, \"women-related feuds\nwere the main cause of homicide\" among the !Kung (Gat,\ncross-cultural study (Otterbein, 1994) has found polygyny to\nbe one of the most distinctive correlates of \"feuding and\nmonopolize fertile females, young males are disposed toward\n\"abduction of women, elopement, and violence\" (Gat, 2006,\np. 181). By way of distinction, monogamy minimizes con-\nwith females [that] circumvent the need for continual contest\nvent . . . \"]). Not surprisingly, monogamy is encouraged in\nsociety, by governmental and within religious organizations,\nall of which provide incentives to enter into the marriage\nbond, and rituals to solidify that bond.\nAlthough cross-national crime rate comparisons evince\nmethodological problems (Maxfield & Babbie, 2014;\nas a function of the international database selected, it is sug-\ngestive that a study referencing INTERPOL, the International\nCriminal Police Organization, reports that Asian populations\ndisplay the lowest rates of violent crime, including rape,8\nand 35, as compared with combined averages for European\nThese international trends are recapitulated in the multiracial\nUnited States, as documented by United States Department of\nJustice Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal Justice\nInformation Services Division arrest rates from 2012, Table\n43,9 wherein rape, murder, and assault statistics fall out,\nrespectively as follows: (a) rape rate of 1.2% Asian/Pacific\nIslander versus a combined 97.5% for White/Black, (b) mur-\nder rates of 1.2% Asian/Pacific Islander versus a combined\n97.6% for White/Black, and (c) aggravated assault rates of\n1.6% Asian/Pacific Islander versus a combined 96.9% for\nWhite/Black. Importantly, although Asian/Pacific Islanders\nconstitute only an average of 1.33 arrests for rape, murder,\nand assault in the United States, they comprise 5% of the U.S.\nIn addition, restricted local violence engenders restricted\nnational violence. It is suggestive that China was seemingly\nfirst to transcend the bounds of kinship, band, and tribe, to\nwithout the facilitative ecological caging effects available,\nfor example, to Egyptian civilizations isolated on a fertile\nribbon amidst a sea of sand (Mann, 2012). Restricted mating\ncompetition will not necessarily result in less war between\ngroups, but it should reduce small-scale violence among\nthem. The point is most stunningly demonstrated by China, a\nland more or less constantly dominated by established dynas-\nties since 221 BC, each capable of imposing stable, central-\nized rule across approximately the same million square\nkilometers. By comparison, the West unified less than half\nthis territory for less than half this time under the Roman\nEmpire, and thereafter dissolved into fiefdoms, duchies,\nprincipalities, and municipalities, some of which only\nmatured into comparatively small states in the 18th and 19th\ncenturies (L. Chang et al., 2011). Concomitantly, Asia has\ncollectively engaged in less warfare, with only 26 recorded\nmajor wars within the modern era, specifically between 1648\nAsian military offensives come after 1945 and were waged\nagainst European powers, as insularity, starting with\nCommodore M. C. Perry's coerced opening of Japan in 1854,\ncontinued to erode (L. Chang et al., 2011).\nLow incidence of violent crime and reduced levels of\nintra-population warfare is found amid a culture that stresses\ncommunion, with individual competition being subordinate\nto collective action. In this way, Asian cultures seem to better\nsolve what Allport called the master problem, namely, the\nrelatively more pronounced subordination of individual\ninterests to societal needs (E. A. Locke, 2011). When one\njuxtaposes such criminal and military statistics, and the lit-\nerature describing collectivism, with the evidence of\ndecreased somatic and genital competition reviewed in this\narticle, there is a correlation suggestive of causation. These\nbiological corollaries of collectivism stand in contradiction\nto the traditions set forth by Lowie, Boaz, Durkheim, and\nMeade that create \"a sharp divide between biological and\ncultural evolution, denying that the former had any but the\nmost trivial significance in human affairs\" (Alves, 1999;\nConvinced that culture arises sui generis, those ethnogra-\nphers in the tradition of Lowie, might, for instance, explain\ncollectivism by way of Confucianism. In contradiction, the\nbiological perspective herein maintained would consider the\nConfucian ethics of loyalty as a correlate, rather than as a\ncause of collectivist communion. Prehistorically evolved\nbiological differences in mating physiology predisposed\nAsian populations to be receptive to both Confucian values\nspecifically and collectivism generally. In sum, basic traits\nand characteristics that are largely biologically shaped pre-\ndispose one to attach value to, adopt, espouse, hold, and\nchampion particular views--views that themselves are erro-\nneously held to be principal causal agents. In consequence, it\nmay be that the evolutionary biologist, comparative psychol-\nogist, and behavioral ecologist have as much to contribute to\nthe understanding of cultural variation as do the anthropolo-\ngist, historian, and sociologist.\nTo be clear, however, biology does not cause collectiv-\nism--at least not in the simple way that the impact of a reflex\nhammer causes a reflex. The relationship between biology\nand collectivism could never be so straightforwardly causal\nbecause biology and culture combine dynamically, and very\nlikely emergently, in a way that tempers the power of reduc-\ntionistic explanation. That being said, in the face of these\nco-occurring biological and cultural differences, it is hard to\nevade the possibility that collectivist culture is on the leash\nof the gene. As more and more researchers are now recogniz-\ning, greater understanding comes from viewing evolution\nand culture as reciprocal, together dynamically creating civi-\nlization (Lieberman & Gangestad, 2010). In the years since\nWilson's dictum, culture\u00adgene coevolution, otherwise called\ndual inheritance theory (Alberts, 2012), \"has emerged as an\ninfluential theory to explain how human behaviour is a prod-\nuct of two complementary and interacting evolutionary pro-\ncesses: genetic and cultural evolution\" (Chiao & Blizinsky,\nWilson, Packing, & Rare, 1981). Moreover, the Wilsonian\napproach, of which gene-culture coevolution is a sort of gen-\neral derivative, has more recently been extended specifically\nto collectivism, with some exploring the genomics of col-\n& Lieberman, 2010), while others explore the ecology of\ncollectivism (Van de Vliert, Yang, Wang, & Ren, 2013). Still\nmore research groups are looking to the prevalence and\nnature of host\u00adparasite interactions (Fincher & Thornhill,\ngen prevalence (Fincher & Thornhill, 2008; Murray &\nSchaller, 2014), neuron\u00adculture interaction (Bender & Ng,\nracial differences to explain the origins of collectivism\n(Chiao, Cheon, Pornpattananangkul, Mrazek, & Blizinsky,\n8 SAGE Open\nthese new and innovative explanations have intuitive appeal\nand might serve the end of finding an ultimate biological pre-\ncursor of collectivist values. Recognizing that some of these\nexplanations are not mutually exclusive, Van de Vliert and\ncolleagues have attempted to weave several together. It\nseems that the set of biological differences herein described\nshould take its place among these models as science contin-\nues on its newly assumed path toward the construction of a\nbiology of collectivism.\nAlthough compiling and contextualizing data, the present\nreview has been neither exhaustive nor systematic. Before\nintegrating the present model with those described above,\nmore studies should be surveyed, and perhaps undertaken, in\nsearch of corroborating or disconfirming evidence for the\npresent thesis. Female behavior and anatomy, only twice or\nthrice broached herein, should be further explored. Genetic\nanalysis should prove edifying, with special attention given\nto sexually antagonistic genetic regions (Rice, 1984; Saifl &\nstudies should investigate the significance of extreme 2D:4D\ndigit ratios (Manning, Stewart, Bundred, & Trivers, 2004)\nand extreme male-biased sex ratios (Garenne, 2002; Lazarus,\naddition to simply strengthening the physical and physiolog-\nical data as advised above, research efforts should be directed\ntoward fundamentally explaining the cause of such data.\nThough the present model succeeds in chaining cultural\ndiversity to evolved biology, it does not explain the origins of\nthis evolved biology. In this way, the most fruitful line of\nfuture research will search for an ultimate evolutionary\nexplanation of the proximate biological differences pre-\nsented herein. Doing so will entail the (a) review of prehis-\ntorical migration patterns, gene flow, inter-cultural conflict,\nand warring; (b) evolutionary history including founder\neffects, drift, and history; (c) ecological variables such as\nrainfall, temperature, soil, and climate; and (d) conducting of\na comparative examination of indigenous flora and fauna,\nmost especially parasites and predators.\nNotes\n1. Although the present article employs the term race, it does\nso, and should be read with the express knowledge that intra-\nspecific variation observed across human populations falls far\nshort of the formal biological use of the term: \". . . a geneti-\nTempleton (2014) decisively and unambiguously stated that\nraces do not exist within the human population, noting by\nway of proof, rates of gene flow, and admixture. \"There are,\"\nTempleton asserted, \"no biological races in humans; indeed,\ndespite our global distribution, we are one of the most geneti-\ncally homogeneous species on this planet\" (Templeton, 2014,\np. 807). However, Templeton went on to state that\nthis finding does not mean that all human populations are\ngenetically identical. Isolation by distance ensures that\nhuman populations are genetically differentiated from\none another, and local adaptation ensures that some of\nthese differences reflect adaptive evolution to the\nenvironmental heterogeneity that our globally distributed\nspecies experiences.\nIt is in reference to this subtle ecologically induced variation\nthat race is presently used.\n 2. As there is much similarity across racial groupings, so there is\nmuch difference within them. Broad categories such as Asian\nand Caucasian collapse across much genetic, ethnic, and lin-\nguistic diversity, falling somewhere between a useful heu-\nristic and an objective division. Problems persist even when\ndescending from super-national to national divisions. Fully\none fifth of the human species is Chinese, for example, and\nwithin the Chinese people are contained 56 nationally recog-\nnized ethnic groupings (Cavalli-Sforza, 1998). Therefore, to\nsay anything about Chinese persons collectively, much less\nAsian persons collectively, is to collapse across significant\ndiversity, a point which should be duly acknowledged and\nminded while interpreting this and other racially based reports.\n3. Signaling among fireflies is not exclusively used in mating;\nfemales, for instance, have been observed to co-opt these bio-\nluminescent signals to attract, and then ingest, males of sepa-\n4. Being one of the most diverse orders of life (Farrell, 1998),\nbeetles consequently afford a laboratory for studying the overt\nand covert forms of mating conflict presently discussed. It\nseems that species that invest more in overt competition, invest\nless in covert competition, and the other way around: \"the spe-\ncies which had evolved relatively longer horns,\" Snell-Rood\nand Moczek (2013) wrote, \"had also evolved relatively shorter\ncopulatory organs, and vice versa\" (p. 192).\n 5. These ratios, and the cross-species means from which they are\nderived, are calculations presently made from data presented\nin Table 3.2 of Dixon's Primate Sexuality.\n 6. It is important to note that rates of sexually transmitted disease\n(STD) may provide a proxy for rates of sexual behavior, as\nimplied herein; however, intervening factors, such as medi-\ncal treatments and prophylactic devices, could alternatively\naccount for reported differences in STD prevalence.\n 7. However, the relaxation of sexual selection that comes of strict\nmonogamy, while it may impart social order and facilitate\nsocial harmony, might equally diminish personality variability,\ninnovation, and genius.\n 8. Rape may be a particularly hard crime to measure.As compared\nwith, for instance, homicide, there are more definitional differ-\nences as to what constitutes rape. Also, unlike assault victims,\nfor instance, rape victims are more apt to experience shame and\nfear stigma, which can function to inhibit reporting, and the\nsense of shame and stigma may vary by culture, and therefore\nby nation. In addition, there are sundry other methodological\nproblems that suggest caution in interpreting cross-national\n 9. Federal Bureau of Investigation data were broken down by race,\nseparately reporting on four categories: (a) White, (b) Black, (c)\nAmerican Indian/Alaska Native, and (d) Asian/Pacific Islander.\nThe reported combined numbers for White/Black crime was cal-\nculated by the current researcher by adding, and then dividing,\nWhite/Black percentages. These data were retrieved on April 9,\n2015, at the following website: http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/\nabledatadecoverviewpdf\n10. U.S. Census data provided the following racial categories: (a)\nWhite, (b) Black or African American, (c) American Indian or\nAlaska Native, (d) Asian, (e) Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific\nIslander, and (f) Other races. The 5% reported above reflects\nthe addition, by the present researcher, of 4.8% Asian and\n0.2% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.
