Initially, this involves widespread\nrecognition of the discipline's ethnocentrism and its\nfailure to consider the sociocultural validity and gen-\neralizability of its research.\nHistorically, common knowledge and scientific evidence\nhave been used to rationalize mistreatment of certain racial\nparison to White men, minority groups in the United States\noccupy a particularly socially disadvantaged position.\nCritical examinations of epistemology argue that White men\nhave established the guidelines for knowledge, and their\nconstruction and reproduction of knowledge regarding how\nthe world is to be represented is often taken as absolute truth\n(Code, 1991). This matter-of-fact approach to establishing\ncommon knowledge gives rise to an environment that sup-\nports the appropriation of knowledge. The appropriation of\nknowledge is a tool for maintaining and preserving power,\nfor once you control knowledge, your power is limitless.\nPeople of color have a unique viewpoint that is often not\nrepresented in the common knowledge perspective (Crenshaw,\nGotanda, Peller, & Thomas, 1995), which has led to a defi-\nciency in the Western scientific knowledge base.An important\npoint to consider is how this exclusion of minority groups in\nthe construction of knowledge has affected the comprehen-\nsiveness of available mental health knowledge and thus the\nfield of psychology. In 1999, Surgeon General David Satcher\nsummoned scholars globally to join efforts to generate a more\ninclusive body of research exploring mental health data. For\ninstance, compared with non-Hispanic Whites, research\nreveals that Blacks are more likely to suffer from a mental ill-\nness yet less likely to seek treatment, and when they do seek\ntreatment, they are more likely to use emergency rooms for\nmental health care and thus are more likely to require inpatient\nAlegr\u00eda, Mendieta, & Linhart, 2011). Conversely, scholars\nargue that mistrust and concerns of discrimination and inac-\ncurate diagnoses among Blacks affect the accuracy of these\ntrends (Burgess, Ding, Hargreaves, Ryn, & Phelan, 2008;\nDepression and Bipolar Support Alliance, 2007; Suite, Bril,\n1Colorado State University\u00adPueblo, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nKamesha Spates, Colorado State University\u00adPueblo, 2200 Bonforte Blvd.,\nEmail: kamesha.spates@colostate-pueblo.edu\n\"The Missing Link\":The Exclusion of\nBlack Women in Psychological Research\nand the Implications for Black Women's\nMental Health\nKamesha Spates1\n Keywords\nAfrican Americans, women, psychology, scientific validation, race\n2 SAGE Open\nAlthough misdiagnosing of mental illnesses occurs in the\ngeneral population, it occurs on a more frequent basis among\nBlacks. For example, a recent study revealed an over diag-\nnosing of schizophrenia in the Black population. The authors\nconclude that widespread misinterpretation of African\nAmerican cultural differences and clinician biases play an\nimportant role in misdiagnosing Blacks (Gara et al., 2012).\nAlthough explanations for these discrepancies are unclear,\nmany scholars argue that practitioners' inability to identify\nand comprehend viewpoints, behaviors, and mental health\noutcomes of racially and ethnically diverse populations has\ncreated daunting challenges in the field of psychology\n(Alegria, Atkins, Farmer, Slaton, & Stelk, 2010; Comas-\nExisting knowledge gaps in mental health literature are\nfurther magnified when exploring mental health issues\namong Black women. Black women's experiences are sig-\nnificantly lacking in the psychology literature. According to\nThomas (2004), this lack \"results in missing bricks of foun-\ndational knowledge\" and \"yield[s] a psychological knowl-\nedge base that is faulty, inadequate, and incomplete\" (p.\n287). As a result, practitioners frequently have trouble\nexplaining culturally specific behaviors among Black women\nwithin the traditional boundaries of psychology.\nContemporary feminist literature, such as feminist psy-\nchology, offers social scientists a new framework to explore\nthe unique social stressors of women and girls in the mental\nhealth arena. Yet, feminist psychology still neglects to exam-\nine the unique struggles of Black women. This article extends\nthe existing literature by offering a historical analysis of how\nthe strained relationship among race, gender, and science\nwas fundamental in constructing a social environment that\nultimately resulted in existing knowledge gaps regarding\nBlack women in the field of psychology. The author argues\nthat feminist psychology has failed to address the knowledge\ngaps of Black women in the field of psychology and suggests\nthat combining Black feminist thought and feminist psychol-\nogy frameworks can provide mental health clinicians with a\nmore comprehensive perspective. This article also includes\ndiscussions of the unique oppressive conditions of contem-\nporary Black women and examines the direct mental health\nimplications of these occurrences.\nHistorical Constructions of Race\nThrough ScientificValidation\nScience is embedded in various aspects of our daily lives.\nHowever, concerns of the accuracy of some scientific\nknowledge have emerged (Duster, 2003), as have concerns\nover the lack of knowledge regarding viewpoints of minority\ngroups. To understand why basic information regarding\nBlack women is virtually absent from behavioral sciences,\nparticularly psychology, it is important to examine the asso-\nciation between Western science ideologies, common knowl-\nedge (Lopez, 1996), and construction of race and gender in\nthe United States. Dating back to the 18th century, common\nknowledge and scientific evidence have been used to ratio-\nnalize mistreatment of certain racial groups in the United\nStates. Scientists of the day sought to scientifically validate\nracialized and gendered perceptions of the \"common\" White\nman (Lopez, 1996). As a result, common knowledge and\nscientific validation, although actually contradictory, came\nto be synonymous. This contradictory knowledge was used\nto establish societal perceptions of racial and gender differ-\nences, and to deny women and people of color citizenship\nand basic human rights, granting only White men authorita-\nScientific claims were used to justify the belief in the infe-\nriority of women and people of color. For example, scientific\nevidence garnered through craniometry and Eugenics was\nheavily relied on to maintain the existence of gendered and\nracial hierarchies. During the early 1900s, craniometry, which\ndeclared that cranial size and brain weight were directly\ncorrelated to intelligence, was regarded as providing valid,\nreliable scientific evidence. It was assumed that the smaller\nthe individual's brain size, the less intelligent the person. This\nstudy implied that women and African Americans were intel-\nlectually underdeveloped (Haraway, 1997).\nDuring the same era, Eugenics, which involves the study\nof the physical and mental qualities of human beings\nthrough genetics, was also a popular scientific explanation.\nEugenics attempted to label people of color as inferior\nbased on genetics, rather than brain size. Intelligence,\nhealth implications, and scientific claims have all at one\npoint or another been linked to Eugenics, and some still are\n(Duster, 2003). For instance, IQ tests are still administered\nto children nationwide, despite the fact that these tests have\nbeen proven to contain cultural biases. According to Smith\n(2003), dependence on culturally biased tests is directly related\nto education disparities, which result in elevated high school\ndropout rates among minorities. Smith (2003) stated,\nThe reasons for this pervasive misidentification and\nreferral of African-American children were found by\nthe President's Commission to include \"reliance on IQ\ntests that have known cultural bias\" and the fact that\n\"minority children are much more likely to be placed\nin the emotional disturbance category because of\nbehavioral characteristics associated with the cultural\ncontext in which a child is raised.\" The mental retarda-\ntion category of Special Education is under the control\nof specialists too often using IQ tests that were devel-\noped with a concern for their validity with White\npopulations and sub-groups, but with no concern with\ntheir validity with minority populations. When their\noriginators found that girls were doing better than\nboys on early versions of the test, they changed the\ntests rather than their ideas about the relative skill of\ngirls and boys at such tasks. But when it was found\nthat the tests failed to deal equitably among ethnic and\nracial groups, the test developers took this to be a con-\nfirmation of the tests' validity. This is not news. It is\nnow generally acknowledged that IQ tests, and the\nvery concept of IQ, were deeply implicated in early\ntwentieth-century racist theories. And yet they con-\ntinue to be used. (p. 1)\nFollowing craniometry and Eugenics, from the 1940s\nthrough 1975, scientists began using ABO blood-maker fre-\nquencies as a source of knowledge. This information was\nused for all sorts of purposes, ranging from social sciences to\nmedical sciences. Scientists asserted that there were blood\ndifferences between the racial and ethnic groups, and used\nthe implication that individual races had common blood\ntypes to discourage miscegenation. Furthermore, according\nto Haraway (1997), blood was used as an inclusive determin-\ning factor. Although the use of blood-maker frequencies is\nno longer an appropriate measure, it does illustrate historical\nevidence of the earlier blood\u00adrace relationship.\nfrom blood frequency tests to genetic mapping and deoxy-\nribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis. A person's DNA attaches\nan individual to a gene, and this gene is said to provide a\nmap to our true heritage. Unfortunately, these results might\nWade, 2007). For instance, if the general assumption is that\nNative Americans are prone to alcoholism due to their\ngenetic makeup, society may tend to believe that Native\nAmericans will become alcoholics. Not only do these claims\nsupport racialized presumptions of the group but they also\ndiscount other contributing factors such as environmental\nand structural inequities that may influence disease rates\nThese scientific practices have had a tremendous impact\non the way society views race. Over the last few centuries,\nmany scientists made a conscious decision to extend sig-\nnificant efforts into attempting to prove genetic-based\nracial differences rather than seeking to contribute useful\ninformation about people of color to our scientific wealth\nof knowledge. It is no wonder, then, that we know very little\nabout the mental health of people of color. These choices\nhave had daunting consequences on scientists, particularly\npsychologists. American mental health researchers are cen-\nturies behind where they should be regarding fundamental\nknowledge of diverse populations. Specific mental health\nstudies of people of color are few. Despite several failed\nattempts to establish substantial evidence, science and\ngenetics are positioned in a unique yet somewhat strained\nrelationship.\nScience and Feminism\nThe historical relationship between common knowledge\nand science is one of great importance, but so too are its\nconsequences. As previously mentioned, Western science\nideologies and common knowledge embody the voices of\nWhite men. Objectivity, neutrality, and common knowledge\nare virtually synonymous with White men's viewpoints.\nConsequently, various professionals from scientific back-\ngrounds are inquiring about the underrepresentation of\nwomen and people of color in the sciences. Accordingly,\nfeminists' analyses attempt to expose the struggles of the\nunderrepresented, particularly women, as well as to offer\nmore inclusive suggestions to the field. Along these lines,\nfeminists would agree that implicating multiple perspectives\ninto their practices would be a huge milestone, not only for\nwomen but also for science (Lederman & Bartsch, 2001).\nA critical component of feminism examines the power\nstructure between men and women. Although the introduction\nof feminism brought about numerous positive changes for\nwomen and people of color, the field has failed to recognize\nthe power differentials that exist among women. Oppression\ncomes in all different forms, ranging from environmental to\nphysical to psychological; therefore, it is important to realize\nthat in general, women's circumstances are complex, and\npotential resolutions will need to be as well.\nThe study of feminism has repeatedly expressed the\nconcerns of White middle-class women without acknowl-\nedging the different forms of feminism. Feminist analyses\narticulated by women of color have generally been mar-\nginalized (Comas-Diaz, 1991). In turn, women of color\ntend to detach from the discipline. As Comas-Diaz (1991)\nstated,\nResearchers and activists alike have noted the rela-\ntively small numbers of women of color participating\nin feminist events and organizations that are typically\nincluded in historical accounts. Several interpretations\nwere offered to explain this low level of involvement.\nOne argued that ethnic women tend to resist feminism\nbecause it is egalitarian and universalistic and moves\nfrom an imperfect present to a more perfect future . . .\nThe interpretation ignored the germinal contributions\nof feminist activists from a variety of cultural back-\ngrounds and seemed to confuse participation with\nattitudes. Indeed, researchers suggest that some\nwomen of color endorse less traditional sex-role ste-\nreotyping than white women. (p. 599)\nIn no way does this article attempt to downplay the dis-\ncrimination and oppression experienced by White women,\nBlack men, or any other member of a minority group. Both\nWhite women and Black women continue to be victims of\ngender oppression in the 21st century. However, Black\nwomen are often criticized for not fitting into traditional sex\nroles; thus, Black women's intricate identities place them in\nan exclusive social position: gender and race. Black wom-\nen's body parts have been exaggerated, and they are often\nlooked at as hypersexual beings, which can instigate acts of\n4 SAGE Open\nsexual violence and disrespect toward Black women (Collins,\nWest (1999) declared that the voices of Black women are\nrarely heard, and when they are, their opinions are frequently\ntaken out of context. They are considered too emotional or\nnot objective enough (West, 1999). When it comes to the\nissue of racism, Black women are likely to feel powerless.\nThey claim that encounters with racism are thought of as a\nBlack man's problem. West interviewed Black women in an\nattempt to grasp how they perceive their position in this\ncountry, and one of the respondents revealed,\nBeing a black woman is difficult in the United States, to\nsay the least . . .. There's the dictum, I would say, in the\nblack community, that men come first, that black come\nfirst, that black men are the ones that are oppressed, and\nthe rest of us need to support them in surviving racism.\nLike, we don't have to survive racism, and we are\nsomehow privileged in this country that we get all the\ngood jobs; we get to go to college and we have it just\nfine here. And the poor black men are the ones that we\nneed to somehow reach out to and help, and I don't\nknow, sacrifice our lives for. That has always just struck\nme as being ridiculous. Anytime at all when racism is\ndiscussed in this country, it's discussed in terms of\nblack males. Everyone else is a kind of fodder for their\ntribulations. That what I think it means to be a black\nwoman. It's just like this kind of loss of a sense of self.\nYou are just kind of cast away. (p. 42)\nUnfortunately, the notion of feminism neglected to\naccount for the roles of racial, historical, cultural, and struc-\ntural conditions that Black women face. Thus, Black femi-\nnist thought emerged.\nBlack FeministThought\nThe struggles and concerns of Black women have been vital\nto the construction of Black feminist thought. Black femi-\nnism is centered around an African American critique on a\nEurocentric approach to knowledge. For example, accord-\ning to Collins (1989), \"Like other subordinate groups,\nBlack women not only possess distinct interpretations of\nBlack women's oppression but have done so by using alter-\nnative ways of producing and validating knowledge\"\n(p. 20). Black feminist thought encourages Black women\nto articulate their own standpoint and to value their own\nacts of resistance dispute two prominent approaches to\nstudying the consciousness of oppressed groups. The first\napproach claims that subordinate groups identify with the\npowerful and have no valid, independent interpretation of\ntheir own oppression. The second approach suggests that\nthe oppressed are less human than their rulers and, therefore,\nare less capable of articulating their own standpoint. An\nunderlying assumption of the two approaches is that the\nsubordinate group's perspective is inferior to that of the\ndominant group and that the subordinate group lacks the\nenthusiasm to pursue any kind of political activism.\nThe severity of the oppression that Black women have\nencountered has forced them to reinvent themselves\nforms of discrimination at once is a daily reality of the con-\ntemporary Black woman. Consequently, Black women\noccupy a unique social position, which thereby results in a\ndistinct set of experiences for the group. Sands (2001) con-\nducted an interview with Dr. Evelyn Hammonds, a Black\nfeminist author, who discussed the connection between\nfemaleness and Blackness. She explained,\nThey are not separate. Because they are not separate in\nme. I am always black and female. I can't say \"well,\nthat was just a sexist remark\" without wondering\nwould he have made the same sexist remark to a white\nwoman. So does that make it a racist, sexist remark?\nYou know, I don't know. And it takes a lot of energy\nto be constantly trying to figure out which one it is.\nTherefore, unlike with their counterparts (Black men and\nWhite women), with Black women, femaleness and black-\nness are interlocking identities. Over time, Black women\nhave discovered that they must play several different roles to\nsurvive. Multiple role-playing is exhausting and extremely\nstressful, and it has physical and psychological consequences\non the individual. Furthermore, success does not make an\nindividual immune to discrimination. Feagin and Sikes\n(1995) interviewed a successful Black woman entrepreneur,\nwho revealed,\nWhat is it like to be a black person in white America\ntoday? One step from suicide! What I'm saying is--the\npsychological warfare games that we have to play\neveryday just to survive. We have to be one way in our\ncommunities and one way in the workplace or in the\nbusiness sector. We can never be ourselves all around. I\nthink that may be a given for all people, but us particu-\nlarly; it's really a mental health problem. It's a wonder\nwe haven't all gone out and killed somebody or killed\nourselves. (p. 1)\nWhat you begin to see here is that racism and oppression\nhave real consequences, as evidenced in the interviewee's\nreferral to intense bouts of oppression as \"psychological\nwarfare\" (Feagin & Sikes, 1995). The next question to ask,\nthen, is this: \"How do these consequences that result from\nracism and oppression, along with the lack of knowledge on\nthe subject, affect Black women's overall well-being?\"\nMental Health Implications\nThe disconnect between the literature and Black women's\ncultural practices decreases the effectiveness of mental\nhealth therapy that Black women may desperately need to\nbuffer the many social stressors that they face in the United\nStates. Thus, Black women's perspectives on their experi-\nences are essential in developing a comprehensive treatment\napproach. Because of the severity of Black women's oppres-\nsion, they offer a unique perspective unfamiliar to any other\ngroup, including Black men, White women, and all other\ncentury, pertinent information necessary to explain Black\nwomen's culturally specific behavior is still essentially miss-\ning from the field.\nIn response to misrepresentations of women and people of\ncolor in behavioral sciences, feminist psychology emerged in\nthe early 1970s. Women rejected mainstream psychology\ntheories as harmful and declared that many of the medical\nfacts simply did not apply. Subtle representations of racist\nand classist assumptions go largely unnoticed by White femi-\nnist psychologists. In this manner, women of color call on\nscholarly communities to broaden the contexts of feminist\npsychology. As a result, a remaining challenge is to ensure\nthat the epistemological advances gained in the field move\nbeyond the White, Western, middle-class experience (Gergen\npsychologists have developed theories to ensure that one's\nsocial context is included as a psychological variable (Russo,\nPerspectives from women, women of color, and lesbians\nare oftentimes absent from mainstream psychology. Thus,\nfeminist psychologists have put forth a vast amount of effort to\ndiversify the perspectives within the field. However, despite\nthese attempts, the literature fails to reflect the experiences of\nall women. Many psychologists assume that gender is not a\nsignificant component to treating emotions. Yet, Western sci-\nence has played an intricate role in constructing polar opposite\ngendered perceptions of emotion and reason. These percep-\ntions have supported notions of the stereotyped \"emotional\nFischer and Manstead suggest that to truly analyze relation-\nships between gender and emotions, one must consider\nthe importance that the \"Western dichotomy\" has played in\nconstructing feminine (emotional) and masculine (rational)\nmeanings (Fischer & Manstead, 2000). Yet, emotional issues\nare the reality of men and women alike. Despite resistance, it\nis critical to continue to confront the biases that dominate\nmainstream psychology. Related research and scholarship\ncontinue to make huge strides for women in the field (Stewart\nFeminist psychologists present five principles that are\nparticularly applicable to women from diverse backgrounds\nciple focuses on examining the relevance of the woman's\ncontext. Although feminist psychology does acknowledge\nsociocultural components of women's lives, women of color\nclaim that the approach fails to consider the influence of\nethno/sociocultural variables. The second principle involves\ninstilling in women that differences are not deficiencies.\nTheories in human behavior and psychological applications\nhave too often neglected to take into account the cultural\ncontext in which group members exist (Brown, 1988). It is\nimportant that the premise of \"difference\" does not equate to\nthe pathological assumptions of \"the other.\"\nThe third principle is the equalization of power. Feminist\npsychology calls for the equal distribution of power between\nsocial positions. This principle is particularly important for\nwomen of color because they occupy positions of gender and\nracial subordination (Cammaert & Larson, 1988; Walker,\n2005). The fourth principle focuses on matters of empower-\nment. Feminist psychologists' goals of empowerment are\nessential to those who are at a disadvantage. Helping a woman\nunderstand that her grim circumstances are to some degree\nattributed to oppression provides her with a sense of empow-\nbegins to see herself as a victim of society rather than a per-\nsonal failure, and this perspective can lighten her stress load\nalmost instantaneously.\nThe final principle is one of social action. Feminist psy-\nchology asserts that women's problems are based on a soci-\netal and personal context. However, women of color differ\nfrom their counterparts in the aspect that their realities are\nbased on environmental, historical, societal, and personal\ncontexts. The basic premise of this principle is to encour-\nage women from all backgrounds, to use their oppressive\nrealities to draw together as an apparatus for social change\nin our paternalistic, racist, classist, and sexist society.\nTherefore, feminist psychologists suggest that addressing\nsocial issues through social action can act as a means of\ncoping, thus giving women of color more control over their\nAs indicated earlier, Black women experience unique\nstressors due to racism and sexism in the United States.\nHowever, again, there is a lack of empirically and theoretically\nbased knowledge concerning this phenomenon. The vast\nmajority of the clinical research that has been done has studied\nBlack women from a pathological perspective (Washington,\n2006). The negative mental health effects caused by issues\nsuch as substance abuse, dysfunctional family circumstances,\nand single parenthood issues are typically the topic areas of\n& Sterk, 2006). However, an examination of Black women\ndealing with their oppressive realities along with the mental\nhealth consequences deserves much more attention (Jones,\nResearchers argue that psychiatrists often overlook the\npsychological impact of racism in the lives of ethnic minori-\nties. They argue that the field of psychiatry reflects dominant\nsocial values that can be oppressive toward nondominant\n6 SAGE Open\npopulations (Bhugra & Ayonrinde, 2001). Bhugra and\nAyonrinde (2001) declared that there are direct correlations\namong racism, racial life events, and mental health. However,\nethnic minorities are less likely to report racial incidents of\ncrime, often due to feelings of shame, inadequacy, hopeless-\nness, or mistrust. Finally, the authors call for therapists to\nself-assess their present biases toward nondominant group\nmembers. To provide the type of treatment necessary for\nthese groups, therapists must acknowledge their role in\nalienating these clients.\nIn addition, Bhugra and Ayonrinde (2001) claimed that\noftentimes, minority groups experience stress due to their\nminority status in society. On an institutional level, occurrences\nsuch as stereotyping, rejection, prejudice, and devaluing non-\nWhite culture are common; similarly, on an individual level,\nstereotyping, rejection, prejudice, devaluation of non-White\nculture, threats, and attacks can influence an individual's per-\nception of life events, thereby leading to additional stress.\nBlack women deal or cope with stress in different ways\ncompared with their counterparts. Dr. Angela Neal-Barnett\n(2003) reported that White women are more likely to seek\nsupport from others, such as friends and children, whereas\nBlack women are inclined to immerse themselves in a stress-\nful situation in an attempt to mend the situation. What is also\nstriking about Dr. Barnett's findings is that the majority of\nthe Black women in her study were either unaware that they\nwere stressed or were not willing to admit it (Neal-Barrett,\nImplications for Future Study\nMissing blocks of fundamental knowledge in psychology\nconcerning Black women coupled with the fact that racism\nand sexism are causing mental health problems paint a\ndisturbing picture for Black women of the future. Social\nscientists and their allies have warned of the problems at\nhand (Satcher, 1999), and many practitioners have began\noffering recommendations for how to treat Black women's\nmultifaceted dilemma (Martin & Martin, 2002; Poussaint,\neven more complicated when we examine the strained\nrelationship between erroneous scientific claims about\nnondominant racial and gendered groups. With the face of\nour nation changing, it is essential that we seek to promote\nscientific knowledge outside that of the dominant paradigm.\nRecommendations for future study include examining the\nlong-term consequences that racism/sexism have on Black\nwomen's mental health. Black women are being forced to\nfind informal ways to cope with their oppression because the\nmental health field is incapable of handling these issues. But\nhow effective are the coping strategies that Black women are\nusing to deal with these issues? Studies are showing that sta-\ntistics in relation to Black women's depression rates are\nExisting knowledge gaps prove troubling to the mental\nhealth of Black women in the United States. Black women's\nmental health rates remain uncertain because scientific stud-\nies concerning women and non-Whites historically focused\nmuch of its attention on validating claims of biological differ-\nences and thus inferiority. Consequently, rather than setting\nout to prove biological differences, Western scientists must\nnow make a conscious effort to accurately speak to the expe-\nriences of the groups that have historically been neglected.\nIn addition, the recent gains associated with the estab-\nlishment of feminist psychology fall short in adequately\naddressing concerns of inclusivity in psychology literature.\nScholars must evade attempts to explain Black women's\nexperiences by way of mainstream psychological knowl-\nedge. I liken this phenomenon to the notion of attempting to\nfit a \"square peg into a round hole.\" Black women's strug-\ngles are simply too unique for this approach.\nThe only adequate solution for widening our knowledge\nbase of the Black woman's experience as it relates to men-\ntal health is to allow Black women themselves to contribute\nthe \"taken for granted\" knowledge often excluded from the\nliterature. I argue that one very reasonable approach to con-\nsider in moving forward is to fuse feminist psychology and\nBlack feminist literatures. Incorporating an effective way\nfor psychologists and therapists to handle the ill effects of\nracism and sexism into their practices is also necessary.\nRegardless of the dominant discourse, race and gender\nissues are very real, and the failure of mainstream scholars\nand clinicians to position themselves to recognize and\nappropriately treat the victims will have detrimental effects\non the society as a whole.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAlegria, M., Atkins, M., Farmer, E., Slaton, E., & Stelk, W.
