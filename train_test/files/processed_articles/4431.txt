    "abstract": "Abstract. The blue and black dress that \"melted the Internet\" is thought to have done so because\nits perceived color depended on people using different prior assumptions about discounting the\nilluminant. However, this is not the first monochromatic object to have confused the public. For a brief\nperiod during WWI, RMS Mauretania was dressed in (dazzle) camouflage shades of blue and black/\ngrey, yet she is sometimes depicted by artists, modelers, and historians in a much showier dress of\nred, blue, yellow, green, and black. I raise the possibility that this originates from a case of public\ndeception deriving from the momentary misperception of a playful artist who neglected to discount the\nilluminant, propagating the most (perhaps only) successful application of dazzle camouflage known.\n",

The\nreason? When forced between two alternatives, about half of the population saw it as blue and black,\nthe other half as white and gold (Figure 1). Broadly speaking, the generally accepted explanation is\nas follows: the low-grade photograph was overexposed and its chromatic content became seriously\ndistorted, resulting in a spectrum that can be parsed in at least two different ways: (1) yellowish light\nfrom the front that when discounted leaves a dress made from blue and black material; (2) a garment\nin dim shadowy blue light that when discounted leaves a dress made from white and gold material. A\nthird commonly reported visual interpretation is of a pale blue and brown dress where, presumably, the\nilluminant is not discounted at all (or is assumed to be made of flat white light), and the pixel wave-\nlengths are seen to be (close to) how they look in isolation.\nThe details of all this, including the properties of the fabric and why different people have dif-\nferent priors for the image/illuminant, are being investigated in several vision laboratories across the\nworld, and Journal of Vision is planning a special issue on the subject.\nThe purpose of this note is to bring to the attention of the scientific vision community a much older\n(~100 years) misperception of a rather different carrier of a blue and black (or gray) dress, possibly\ninvolving processes of the third kind described above. During the First World War, merchant ships\nand their escorts were painted in so-called dazzle camouflage consisting of crazy patterns of stripes\nand geometric shapes. Many schemes used black and white, but blues and pastel colors came to be\nused in some. It seems that the aim of this striking display was to dazzle the U-boat captains, confus-\ning their assessment of the speed and heading of their targets (e.g., Scott-Samuel, Baddeley, Palmer,\n& Cuthill, 2011; Hall, Cuthill, Baddeley, Shohet, & Scott-Samuel, 2013). Given the large number of\nvessels involved (over 4,000 merchant ships and 400 military ships from Britain alone, according to\nMurphy & Bellamy, 2009), the application of dazzle must have impressed the authorities, but whether\nthis strategy was truly effective in practice was never shown; it might well have been done more for\nmorale than for saving allied shipping.\nDuring WW1, the four-funnel liner RMS Mauretania was commandeered as a troop ship, and\nby 1918 she was dressed in dazzle camouflage. Photographs from this period are in black and white,\nand this has posed difficulties in assessing the true colors in which dazzle ships were painted, in\ngeneral. The c1919 painting by Burnett Poole (Figure 2) shows Mauretania in a scheme of blues and\ngrays. Whether these are the true shades that she carried, or whether the darker blue (such as that to\nthe aft) was closer to black, as shown in Admiralty diagrams (held by the Imperial War Museum),\nis not clear. However, the camouflage shades of gray in every one of the photographs of the ship I\nhave found on the Internet are consistent with each of these two (rather similar) interpretations. More\nBedazzled: A blue and black ship, dressed to deceive\nFigure 1.

The blue and black ship? Admiralty diagrams (not shown) indicate that the official scheme was blue,\nblack, and gray. (This image is public domain.)\nimportantly, I have found no evidence (photographic, eyewitness reports, or reference to Admiralty\nrecords) that Mauritania ever carried different coloration in any of the pale diamonds on the fore of\nthe hull. Builders of scale models have a tenacious interest in the subject of livery/camouflage, and\nInternet posts from them come to similar conclusions. Nonetheless, an alternative scheme is readily\nfound in reference books (Williams, 1989, 2001), paintings, (including one by Crossley) and Internet\nFigure 3. Seeing red. (a) Part of a post-war publicity poster for the Cunard Line. Almost certainly, this image\nis wrong in depicting RMS Mauritania in red, green, and yellow. This author does not know if the poster's true\ncolors have been accidently/subtly distorted during reproduction, but even so, that could not explain the large\nsplashes of red. Furthermore, the patchwork of gray in the original black and white photograph upon which this\nimage was presumably based (not shown) is inconsistent with a grayscale conversion of this image (not shown).\nThe speculation that the artificial colors were inspired by reflections at sunset is supported by the somewhat\niridescent quality of some of the red regions in the image, particularly around the lifeboats. (This image is\nassumed to be public domain.) (b) Photograph of the wing of an Airbus taken at sundown. A dazzling spectacle,\nsince commercial airlines do not usually paint the underwings of their aircraft red or pink! (In fact, knowledge\nof this might impede perception of a colored underwing (e.g., Hurlbert & Ling, 2005; Granzier & Gegenfurtner,\ncommentaries; it has exactly the same pattern as the established one, but includes large slabs of bright\nred on the hull and superstructure, and pastel shades of yellow and green on two of the funnels. So\nwhat is going on?\nThe origin of this (assumed) error is almost certainly a post-war publicity poster by the ship's\nowners, The Cunard Line, which depicts their liner (Figure 3a) in the exact alternative colors described\nabove; it seems that these have been taken on face value by those who have seen the poster, and\nthe myth has been propagated. But the question arises, why gild the lily? The answer might be that\nthe more colorful scheme was simply thought to be more appealing to potential passengers; but\nwhy choose those colors? After all, there is little evidence that bright red was used in British dazzle\nschemes; available records suggesting that more sombre maritime colors were by far the norm. (The\nImperial War Museum website hosts images of (at least) 2,185 scale models, photographs, paintings,\nand drawings of dazzle ships, many carrying the curiously named Wilkinson schemes (e.g., 9A, 9EX,\nbauxite or red oxide, not scarlet). We can't know for sure, but it is not so fanciful to suppose that the\nartist of the publicity poster had seen Mauritania (or other dazzle ships) in port at sunset; reflections of\nred, and arguably yellow and green, being directed to the artist by some of the paler (more reflective)\nfacets of the ship (a contemporary example is shown in Figure 3b). With a cognoscente, or even na\u00efve,\nprior that anything is possible with these dazzle ships, these splashes of narrowband illuminant might\nwell have been perceived as paint, at least for a few moments, and--enjoying the spectacle--the artist\nchose to share that with the public, in a stylized fashion.\nWhatever the underlying reason for this misperception of the blue and black ship, it has proved\nprovocative (e.g., the contemporary artwork in Figure 41), and it is delightfully ironic that what is\nprobably dazzle's greatest success in deception has nothing to do with the purpose for which it was\nintended; perhaps also, that a similarly misperceived blue and black dress should be the trigger for\nMauritania's public disrobing.\n1It is often thought that the cubist art of the period was the inspiration for the dazzle schemes of WW1. However,\nthe original proposals by Kerr were derived from observations of animal camouflage with the help of Thayer\n(Murphy & Bellamy, 2009), and it has been claimed that Wilkinson's schemes were derived quite independently\nof the fashionable art movement of the time, though experiments with cubist ideas were carried out by the French\nsections de camouflage (Murphy & Bellamy, 2009).\nFigure 4.
