The prevalence ratios (PRs)\nfor stage 3 CKD and albuminuria by the presence of these risk factors were compared across\nsurvey periods.\nP for change  0.898). Similar results were observed for undiagnosed diabetes (PR of CKD 1.38\nand 1.50; P for change  0.373). The association of cigarette smoking was similar in each time\nperiod. Besides obesity, for which the association remained stable over time, similar patterns\nwere observed for the PR of albuminuria.\nCONCLUSIONS -- In terms of CKD, improvements in hypertension and high cholesterol\nmanagement have been offset by both diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes. Further increases in\nCKD may occur if diabetes continues to increase.\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a\ncommon condition, affecting a sub-\nstantial proportion of adults in the\nU.S. and worldwide (1). A recent analysis\ndocumented a marked increase in CKD\nprevalence among U.S. adults over the\npast decade (2). Due to its impact on qual-\nity of life, cardiovascular disease (CVD)\nincidence, and mortality, CKD is an im-\nportant public health challenge (3\u00ad5).\nObesity, smoking, hypertension,\nhigh cholesterol, and diabetes are key risk\nfactors for CKD (6\u00ad9). Awareness, treat-\nment, and control of hypertension has im-\nproved over the past several decades\ncholesterol levels have occurred as well\n(12), likely due to dietary changes and\nincreasing usage of cholesterol-lowering\nmedications. However, the prevalence\nand incidence of diabetes continue to in-\ncreases in obesity (17).\nWe hypothesized that CKD related to\nhypertension and high cholesterol has de-\ncreased over time, likely due to improve-\nments in the management of these\nconditions. However, given an ongoing\nincrease in the prevalence of diabetes\nwithout significant improvements in its\ntreatment (18), we further hypothesized\nthat CKD related to diabetes has in-\ncreased. We tested these hypotheses by\nassessing trends in the association of cig-\narette smoking, obesity, hypertension,\nhigh cholesterol, and diabetes with CKD\nThird National Health and Nutrition Ex-\namination Survey (NHANES) III and\nMETHODS\nStudy sample\nare cross-sectional nationally representa-\ntive surveys of the noninstitutionalized ci-\nvilian population of the U.S. Briefly, each\nsurvey employs a multistage stratified\nprobability sample based on selection of\ncounties, blocks, households, and per-\nsons within households.

The sta-\ntistical significance of differences in the\nmeans and prevalence estimates across\nthe two surveys was determined using the\nWald 2 test. Test statistics were calcu-\nlated as the difference in prevalence esti-\nmates divided by the standard error of the\ndifference, calculated as the square root of\nthe sum of each estimate's variance. The\nprevalence ratios (PRs) of stage 3 CKD\nand albuminuria associated with cigarette\nsmoking, obesity, hypertension, high\ncholesterol, and diagnosed and undiag-\nnosed diabetes were estimated for each\ntime period, separately, using log-\nbinomial regression models including ad-\njustment for age, race, sex, hypertension,\nand self-reported diabetes. The statistical\nsignificance of changes in the PRs over\ntime was calculated using two sample t\ntests (i.e., the difference in the -coeffi-\ncients from the regression models divided\nby the square root of the sum of their\nvariance).\nSample weights that account for the\ncomplex survey design of NHANES, in-\ncluding unequal probabilities of selec-\ntion, over-sampling, and nonresponse,\nwere applied for all analyses using\nSUDAAN (Version 9.1; Research Trian-\ngle Institute, Research Triangle Park,\nNC).

However, we ob-\nserved no change in the PR of CKD due to\ndiabetes over time. These findings suggest\nthat similar improvements for diabetes\nmanagement have not occurred. The as-\nsociation between obesity and CKD de-\nclined over the time period under study.\nNational trends data have demonstrated\nimprovements in blood pressure and lipid\nvalues across categories of BMI over time\n(20). Therefore, despite increasing rates\nof obesity, improved risk factor manage-\nment may partially account for the\npresent findings.\nIn the context of the current\nliterature\nDiabetes is a critical risk factor for CKD\nfor nearly half of all incident cases of end-\nstage renal disease in the U.S. (8). Numer-\nous studies have shown that the\nprevalence and incidence of diabetes con-\ntinue to increase (13\u00ad16). The increase in\nnumber of U.S. adults with diabetes has\nlead to an increase in the attributable risk\nfor diabetes as a CVD risk factor relative to\nother traditional risk factors (23). Rates of\ntreatment and control of CVD risk factors\namong people with diabetes remains poor\n(18). Although U.S. vital statistics docu-\nment a marked decline in cardiovascular\nmortality over the past several decades,\nrecent data suggest that individuals with\ndiabetes have not experienced the same\nmortality reductions (24). We extend\nthese findings to relations between diabe-\ntes and CKD and show that the PR for\nCKD did not decline over the past decade.\nIn contrast, results for hypertension\nand high cholesterol are more encour-\naging. While hypertension has in-\ncreased among U.S. adults over the past\ndecade (11), rates of hypertension treat-\nment and control have also increased.\nThe improvement in overall manage-\nment of hypertension, despite its in-\ncreasing prevalence, is reflected in the\nreduced PR for hypertension as a CKD\nrisk factor. Rates of high cholesterol\nhave decreased over time (12).

Sim-\nilar to the results for hypertension, our\nresults indicate that an added benefit of\nthese interventions may be the reduced\nrisk of CKD and albuminuria associated\nwith high cholesterol.\nStrengths and limitations\nStrengths of the current study include the\nwell-characterized NHANES datasets,\nlarge sample size, and nationally repre-\nsentative data. We were able to examine\nCKD as defined by reduced eGFR as well\nas albuminuria, a well-established risk\nminuria identifies different subsets of in-\ndividuals at risk for CVD and all-cause\nmortality as compared with CKD alone\n(27). Limitations include the use of the\nMDRD equation to estimate GFR instead\nof a direct measurement (28), which\nwould not be feasible in a large popula-\ntion-based study. Further, the MDRD\nequation underestimates eGFR in healthy\nindividuals (29); how this impacts the di-\nchotomous classification of CKD is uncer-\ntain. We used a study design that\nincorporated serial cross-sectional studies\nand therefore cannot infer causality be-\ntween risk factors and CKD. However, we\nbelieve that this study design is the most\npowerful for determining overall trends\nin disease burden. Our sample was lim-\nited to individuals with stage 3 CKD due\nto small numbers of individuals with\nmore severe CKD. Measures of albumin-\nuria were based on a spot-urine collec-\ntion. However, the correlation between\n24-h collections and spot urine is accept-\nable (30). We relied on fasting plasma\nglucose and not an oral glucose tolerance\ntest to define diabetes. Therefore, we may\nhave underestimated the prevalence of\nundiagnosed diabetes in our sample.\nHowever, it is unlikely that this occurred\ndifferentially between NHANES III and\nunlikely to account for the observed\nfindings.\nImplications\nIncreases in obesity have lead to rises in\nthe prevalence of diabetes. As diabetes\ncontinues to increase, the prevalence and\nincidence of CKD may continue to in-\ncrease as well. Currently, individuals with\ndiabetes are suboptimally managed with\nrespect to CVD risk factors and overall\nglucose management (18). Less than half\nof individuals with CKD in the Framing-\nham Heart Study had optimal A1C levels\n(31). Further, among individuals with\nCKD, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslip-\nidemia, less than 10% of participants had\noptimal management of all of their risk\nfactors. Improvement in CVD risk factor\nmanagement, particularly diabetes, will\nbe necessary to prevent further increases\nin CKD prevalence. Whether interven-\ntions focusing on weight loss and choles-\nterol reduction will reduce the risk of\nCKD require further study.\nIn conclusion, improvements in hy-\npertension and high cholesterol manage-\nment have been offset by both diagnosed\nand undiagnosed diabetes. Further in-\ncreases in CKD may occur if diabetes con-\ntinues to increase.\n"
