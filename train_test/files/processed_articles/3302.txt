As a consequence, they have to estimate the other's altruistic intentions.\nUsing an economic game, we showed that without reputational information people have\nintrinsic expectations about the altruistic behavior of others, which largely explained their\nown altruistic behavior. This implies that when no information is available, intrinsic\nexpectations can be as powerful a driver of altruistic behavior as actual knowledge about\nother people's reputation. Two strategies appeared to co-exist in our study population:\nparticipants who expected others to be altruistic and acted even more altruistically\nthemselves, while other participants had low expected altruism scores and acted even less\naltruistically than they expected others to do. We also found evidence that generosity in\neconomic games translates into benefits for other social contexts: a reputation of financial\ngenerosity increased the attractiveness of partners in a social cooperative game. This result\nimplies that in situations with incomplete information, the fitness effects of indirect\nreciprocity are cumulative across different social contexts.\n",

Several theories have\nsuggested that even when altruistic acts are costly, altruists can gain if they are reciprocated\ndirectly or indirectly (Trivers, 1971). Direct reciprocity occurs when the receiver of an\nAltruism when reputational information is incomplete\naltruistic act in turn provides benefits for the individual that has acted altruistically\n(Axelrod, 1984). Indirect reciprocity involves altruism towards recipients, but the\nreciprocal benefits are provided by others than the recipients (Alexander, 1987; Roberts,\n1998). A particular human prosocial trait that facilitates maintenance of altruism is strong\nreciprocity, which predisposes people to cooperate with others and punish non-cooperators,\neven when this behavior cannot be justified in terms of extended kinship or reciprocal\naltruism (Gintis, 2000). Theoretical models have shown repeatedly that direct, indirect, and\nstrong reciprocity can overcome the short-term costs of altruistic behavior and, under\nspecific conditions, lead to long term fitness advantages of generous behavior (Fishman,\nThe main mechanism underlying indirect reciprocity is thought to be reputation\nbuilding or image scoring. Individuals that act altruistically will earn a good reputation that\nwill be repaid in future interactions (Alexander, 1987). Experimental economic games have\nshown that when potential partners know another's past behavior, they use this reputational\ninformation to modify their future social interactions (Barclay, 2004; Milinski, Semmann,\neconomic games with repeated social interactions, generous players benefit in the long-\nterm because they receive higher payoffs from other participants (Wedekind and\nBraithwaite, 2002). Variation among individuals in the tendency to donate money\naltruistically may also affect their chances of being chosen as cooperative partner in future\neconomic interactions, since the most generous people are preferred as cooperative partners\n(Barclay, 2004). Hence, the benefits of altruistic behavior depend not only on the altruistic\nact itself, but also on how this behavior ranks compared to the altruism of other\ncompetitors.\nHowever, in reality people seldom have complete information about the altruistic\nbehavior of others. For example, when individuals are amongst unknown people or when\nthe reputation of others concerns altruism in a different social or economic context, the\nlevel of generosity of potential competitors is unknown. Since economic games show that\nthe \"value\" of an altruistic act is dependent on the frequency and magnitude of generosity\nof other people, not knowing the altruistic reputation of others significantly hampers the\ndecision about the optimal level of generosity (Mitzkewitz and Nagel, 1993; Rotemberg,\n2008). Similarly, the choice for cooperative partners depends on the partners' level of\naltruism, but scarce knowledge about the altruistic reputation of potential partners prevents\nan optimal decision about cooperation. Instead, incomplete information will force people to\nrely on their intrinsic expectation of altruism of others, which is likely to be inaccurate due\nto widespread variation in generosity among humans (Camerer and Hogarth, 1999;\nForsythe, Horowitz, Savin, and Sefton, 1994). Alternatively, humans may rely on\nalternative cues if available, such as other types of social behavior such as a person's\nfaithfulness and loyalty to friends (Pradel, Euler, and Fetchenhauer, 2009). It is unknown to\nwhat extent generosity in economic games translates to trust in other types of cooperative\nbehavior.\nThe present study investigates decision-making when incomplete information is\navailable about the altruistic behavior of others. We test two hypotheses: a) when no\ninformation about altruistic reputation is available, an individual's expectation about other\npeople's altruism is correlated to their own level of generosity, and b) an altruistic\nAltruism when reputational information is incomplete\nreputation obtained in an economic game increases acceptance as a partner in a social\ndyadic task. We used the Dictator Game in combination with a questionnaire to measure\nobserved and expected generosity of participants. Subsequently, participants played a\ndyadic cooperative game, in which they received fictitious information about the Dictator\nGame decision of their prospective cooperative partner.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants and anonymity\nyears) and 435 females (average age 21.5 \u00b1 SD 2.7 years) from various universities in the\nNetherlands. They were recruited via university e-mailing lists to visit our internet site\nwhere they were asked to fill out an online questionnaire. Therefore participation was\nanonymous and there was no contact between experimenters and participants. All\nparticipants gave informed consent. The Dictator Game (see below) was played by all\nparticipants while a random subset of 240 participants (69 males and 171 females)\nperformed the cooperative task. To contain costs, we did not award all participants the\nmoney they accrued. Instead, we informed them that one randomly selected participant\nwould receive the amount he or she accrued. Students could not participate multiple times,\nbecause separate from filling in the questionnaire, they left personal details to be able to\nparticipate in the lottery, and if these details were already present in our database their\nquestionnaire was not entered in the database.\nGame play\nIn the online questionnaire the participants were asked for their gender and age. They\nreceived written instructions for the Dictator Game in which they could choose to share 60\nby donating half to an anonymous person or to keep the entire sum to themselves. After\nthey had made their decision, they were asked to estimate the proportion of participants that\nwould share the money (by choosing from 11 categories ranging from 0-100% of\nparticipants sharing), which is referred to subsequently as expected altruism.\nA random subset of the participants also played a dyadic cooperative game. They\nreceived instructions about a fictitious situation in which they could choose to work alone\nor cooperate with an unknown peer student to pass a course exam. Participants were told\nthat if they chose to work together with the unknown student, the workload of the course\nwould be halved because the work could be split among them. Hence, they would spend\nonly half the time on course attendance compared to working alone. However, it was made\nclear to the participants that cooperation contained a risk; because if their partner defected,\ntheir chances of passing the course exam would be strongly reduced. On the other hand, if\nthey chose not to cooperate they would have to spend full time on the course, yet their\nchances of passing the exam would increase. No information about the sex of the student\nwas provided. The participants were asked to make a single decision and were given the\npossibility to write a motivation for their choice. Also, they were asked to rank themselves\non a scale from 1-7 to indicate general willingness to collaborate with other people.\nThe experimental design of the cooperative game included three treatments by variation\nin the written information for the cooperative game. In the \"No information\" treatment no\ninformation was given about the peer student in the previous Dictator Game. The \"Share\nAltruism when reputational information is incomplete\nmoney\" treatment included information that the peer student had shared the money in the\nprevious Dictator Game, and the \"Keep money\" treatment included information that the\npeer student had not shared the money in the Dictator Game.\nStatistics\nWe used logistic regression analysis to assess the association between measured\ncharacteristics of the participants (sex, age and expected altruism) and their decision to\nkeep or share money in the Dictator Game. We also tested if the participants' altruistic\nbehavior in the Dictator Game agreed with their expectations about altruistic behavior of\nothers. For each category of expected altruism, the observed sharing percentage was\ncalculated and tested against a binomial distribution with the percentage expected altruism\nas the probability parameter.\nWe also performed a logistic regression on the decision to collaborate in the dyadic\ncooperative game. The backward stepwise procedure was used to obtain the best minimal\nmodel for the independent variables age, sex, general willingness to collaborate, expected\naltruism, and the participant's own decision in the Dictator Game. The three treatments with\nmanipulated information provided about the prospective partner's altruism were included in\nthe analysis as categorical variables using the indicator contrast method. To explore if the\nthree treatment levels needed to be maintained separately, alternative models were run with\ntwo treatment levels pooled. The significance of the resulting change in goodness of fit was\nassessed by comparing the change in deviance (-2 log likelihood) of the alternative models\nwith the chi-square distribution with df = 1 (Hardy and Field, 1998). All tests were run in\nResults\nOut of all the participants in the Dictator Game, 24.2% chose to share the money, hence\nacting altruistically. A logistic regression analysis showed that sex and age of the\nparticipants did not influence the frequency of altruistic behavior (see Table 1). There was\nsubstantial variation in the expected altruism scores of participants. Most participants had\nparticipants). Since the actual sharing percentage in the Dictator Game was 24.2%, only\naround a third of the participants had a realistic perception of altruistic behavior of their\npeers, nearly 40% underestimated the incidence of altruism, and almost a third\noverestimated the frequency of altruism.\nIn fact, expected altruism was the only variable in the logistic regression that explained\na significant proportion of the observed variation in sharing behavior among our\nparticipants (see Table 1). Participants with low expected altruism scores were less likely to\nshare than those participants with high expected altruism scores.

Participants with low expected altruism scores shared on average somewhat less\nfrequently than their own expectations of altruism. On the other hand, the participants with\nhigh expected altruism scores behaved on average even more altruistically than they\nexpected others to do (see Figure 1).\n3.2 Cooperative game\nIn total, 51.3% of the participants replied positively to the proposed collaboration.\nThe best model to explain variation in the decision to collaborate contained two\nindependent variables: the sex of the participant and the information provided about the\nprospective partners' altruism (see Table 2). The independent variables age, general\nwillingness to collaborate, expected altruism, and the participant's own decision in the\nDictator Game did not contribute significantly to the model. The analysis showed that\nfemales were less willing to collaborate than males (44.4 % vs 68.1% resp.). Independent\nof sex, if participants were led to believe that the unknown peer student had shared\naltruistically in the Dictator Game they were significantly more likely to agree to\ncollaboration (Figure 2, Table 2). Further reduction of the model resulted in significant loss\nof power if the \"Share money\"-treatment was pooled with any of the other treatments\nHowever, no explanatory power was lost if the \"No information\"-treatment and \"Keep\nIn other words, participants were equally likely to collaborate with documented non-\naltruistic partners as with unknown partners, but had a higher likelihood of collaboration\nwith documented altruistic partners.\nAltruism when reputational information is incomplete\nFigure 2.

Participants received different information about the altruistic\nreputation of their potential partners (Keep money, No information, Share money). Grey\nbars represent percentage collaborating, open bars represents percentage not collaborating.\nNumber in parentheses represents sample size.\nDiscussion\nTwo main findings result from our study on human altruistic and cooperative decisions\nwhen reputational information is incomplete. First, our data showed that in the Dictator\nGame individual variation in altruistic behavior was solely explained by intrinsic\nexpectations about the prevalence of altruism in other people. Second, we demonstrated\nthat positive reputational information is transferable across different domains of altruistic\nbehavior: information about altruistic behavior in an economic game enhanced the\nprobability of initiating collaborative social interactions. Surprisingly, collaboration with\npartners of unknown reputation and negative reputation was equally infrequent. Such lack\nof distinction suggests that people are cautious to engage in collaborations with unfamiliar\npartners.\nOur findings showed that roughly a quarter of the participants shared their endowment.\nDespite the fact that our participants did not use actual money, experiments that did use real\nmoney payoffs have found a similar percentage of participants giving away half of their\nendowment (Knafo et al., 2007). Previous work has shown that the average amount offered\nwhen money is hypothetical is remarkably similar to when real money is at stake (Ben-Ner,\nShare money\nNo information\nKeep money\n% of participants collaborating\nShare money\nNo information\nKeep money\nMales\nFemales\nAltruism when reputational information is incomplete\nseem to affect the amount of money offered (Cameron, 1999; Hoffman, McCabe, and\nSmith, 1996). Hence it is reasonable to assume that our results were not biased due to our\nreward system, which justifies a comparison with other work using real money.\nFurthermore, the behavior of subjects in the Dictator Game is known to be strongly\ninfluenced by the experimental context in which the decisions are made. The anonymity\nand observability of the participant's decisions are particularly vital to the level of\ngenerosity displayed, because reputational concerns are known to be a powerful force in\ndriving altruistic behavior (Bateson, Nettle, and Roberts, 2006; Burnham, 2003; Haley and\nFessler, 2005). In our experiment, participants filled out an anonymous internet\nquestionnaire so no interaction with the experimenters took place. Therefore, the results\nwere not influenced by overt factors allowing reputation management, or by unconscious\ninputs that determine the sense of anonymity.\nWe predicted that in the absence of reputational information of competitors, altruistic\nbehavior should be more prevalent among those participants with high intrinsic\nexpectations of altruism of others. Indeed, higher intrinsic expectations about the degree of\naltruism of others were significantly associated with more generosity. These results in\nthemselves are insufficient to demonstrate reciprocity in altruism, as the reported level of\nexpected altruism could have been directly related to the level of altruism the participants\nthemselves had displayed in the Dictator Game (cf. Orbell and Dawes, 1991). However,\nour findings are consistent with previous studies on conditional cooperation in donation\nstrategies. These show that people's donations are positively correlated with donations of\nother contributors, demonstrating that individuals are only willing to donate more if they\nknow that others do so. (Croson, 2007, Fischbacher, G\u00e4chter, and Fehr, 2001, Keser and\nAdditional evidence for the role of expectations in conditional cooperation is found in\nexperiments using public goods games, in which condition dependence seems to exist if\npeople only expect others to contribute more to the public good (Croson, 2007, Wit and\nWilke, 1992). It has been suggested that the similarity between participants' own\ncontributions and their expectations about others is due to concerns about free-riding\n(Kurzban, McCabe, Smith, and Wilson, 2001). The novelty of our results is that the\nDictator Game does not involve free-riding because it is a one shot interaction and there are\nno consequences of the other participant's generosity on one's own earnings. This implies\nthat when no information is available, expectations can be a powerful a driver of altruistic\nbehavior independent of free rider considerations.\nIn fact, participants who expected others to be altruistic acted even more altruistically\nthemselves (see Figure 1). Our findings therefore partly support the competitive altruism\nmodel (Roberts, 1998), which predicts that individuals aim to be more altruistic than others\nin order to be chosen for further cooperative interactions (Barclay and Willer, 2007). Our\ndata confirm this key prediction because the participants with high expected altruism scores\ndonated money significantly more frequently than they expected others to do (see Figure\n1), hence acting more altruistically than others. Yet at the same time, we found that\nparticipants with low expected altruism scores acted even less altruistically than they\nexpected others to do. One explanation is that these participants followed a free-rider\nstrategy, but it is not clear why this strategy was confined to participants with low expected\naltruism scores. Another explanation has to do with the fact that prosocial behavior can\nAltruism when reputational information is incomplete\nelicit anti-social punishment (Herrmann, Thoni, and Gachter, 2008), i.e. punishment\ndirected towards people who are more altruistic than the punisher. Although the Dictator\nGame does not involve a possibility for punishment, antisocial punishment in other\neconomic games is negatively correlated to social norms of cooperation and can severely\nlimit altruistic behavior (Herrmann et al., 2008).\nObviously, it remains to be tested whether this self-reported measure of expected\naltruism is stable over individuals' lifetimes. It is probably reasonable to assume that the\nlevel of expected altruism is the result of the combined influence of genes and\nenvironment, as is the case for many behavioral traits. Adjustment of expected altruism\nmay occur in response to the level of altruism experienced in other encounters (Barclay,\nstudies have shown that traits involved in altruistic behavior in economic games are\nheritable and suggest common environment to have a very modest role as a source of\nphenotypic variation (Cesarini et al., 2008; Wallace, Cesarini, Lichtenstein, and\nJohannesson, 2007). Recently, the level of generosity in the Dictator Game has been\ndemonstrated to be associated with genetic polymorphism in the length of the RS3 repeat in\nthe AVPR1a promoter region (Knafo et al., 2007). Future research is required to determine\nif variation in expectations of altruism can also be characterized by this common genetic\npolymorphism.\nWe also predicted that the willingness to collaborate in a social dyadic task would\ndepend on the altruistic reputation obtained in economic games (Kahneman, Knetsch, and\nThaler, 1986; Trivers, 1971). In our study, reputational information was manipulated by\nincluding information about previous Dictator Game decisions, which is potentially\nsusceptible to demand characteristics, i.e. participants may guess that this information\nshould influence their disposition (Bardsley, 2008; Orne, 1962). However, our results\nshowed that the decision to collaborate was only affected by a positive reputation of the\npotential partner, not by negative information, which may indicate that human image\nscoring is more geared toward positive images. Public goods games have demonstrated\nrepeatedly that refusal to show altruistic behavior is punished by other players, indicative of\nan aversion to cooperate with non-altruists (Egas and Riedl, 2008; Fehr and G\u00e4chter, 2000).\nIt is remarkable that when no information is available about a potential partner's reputation\na similar dislike of collaboration is displayed.\nThe fact that a good reputation has payoffs beyond the strict context in which the\nreputation is obtained suggests the long-term benefits of reputation building have been\ngreatly underestimated so far. Generosity has been considered in different contexts,\nincluding food sharing (Bird, Bird, Smith, and Kushnick, 2002; Smith, Bird, and Bird,\nSchimmel, and Butterworth, 1993), and time spent in public office (Price, 2003), and can\nbe indirectly rewarded by e.g. economic payment, sexual rewards, cooperative relationships\nand attributed social status and political support. Measuring the cumulative fitness effects\nof indirect reciprocity across different social contexts may be a prohibitively difficult\nundertaking, but may be essential to understand the evolutionary forces promoting altruistic\nbehavior.\nAltruism when reputational information is incomplete\n"
