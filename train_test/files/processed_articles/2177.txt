The subadditive\nmultivariate associations of CAs with the onset of psychi-\natric disorders have implications for targeting interven-\ntions to reduce exposure to CAs and to mitigate the harm-\nful effects of CAs to improve population mental health.\n(CAs) are among the most\nconsistently documented\nrisk factors for psychiat-\nric disorders.1-6 Research\nhas shown that several different CAs, in-\ncluding parental death, abuse, neglect, and\nfamily violence, are strongly related to\nmental disorders.6-10 Research has also\nshown that these diverse CAs often co-\ndence of co-occurrence, most research has\nfocused on single CAs7-9,14 or on a count\nof the number of CAs as predictors of men-\ntal disorders.1,3,15 This has led to an over-\nestimation of the effects of individual CAs\nand to the neglect of potentially impor-\ntant multivariate CA profiles.

We report such\ndata in the present study based on analysis of the Na-\ntional Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supple-\nment (NCS-A),19 a national survey of the prevalence and\ncorrelates of DSM-IV disorders among US adolescents.\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nAs previously reported in more detail,20 the NCS-A was per-\nlescents aged 13 to 17 years were interviewed face to face in\ndual-framehousehold-schoolsamples.20,21 Thehouseholdsample\nincluded adolescents who were recruited from households that\nparticipated in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication\n(NCS-R).22 A total of 879 school-attending adolescents partici-\npated in the household survey, with a response rate of 86.8%\n(conditional on adult participation in the NCS-R). The remain-\nder of the sample included 9244 adolescents recruited from a\nrepresentative sample of schools in NCS-R sample areas. The\nadolescent response rate in the school sample was 82.6% (con-\nditional on school participation). The total NCS-A sample, com-\nbining household and school samples, included 10 123 ado-\nlescents. Although the proportion of initially selected schools\nthat participated in the NCS-A was low (28.0%), replacement\nschools were carefully matched to the original schools. Com-\nparison of household sample respondents from nonparticipat-\ning schools with school sample respondents from replace-\nment schools demonstrated no evidence of bias in estimates of\nprevalence or correlates of mental disorders.20\nOne parent or guardian was asked to complete a self-\nadministered questionnaire (SAQ) about the participating ado-\nlescent's developmental history and mental health. The SAQ\nresponse rates (conditional on adolescent participation) were\n82.5% in the household sample and 83.7% in the school sample.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from parents or guard-\nians before approaching adolescents. Written adolescent as-\nsent was then obtained from adolescents before surveying ado-\nlescents or parents. Each respondent was given $50 for\nparticipation. These recruitment and consent procedures were\napproved by the human subjects committees of Harvard Medi-\ncal School and the University of Michigan. This study focuses\non 6483 adolescent-parent pairs for whom data were available\nfrom both adolescent interviews and SAQs.\nOnce the survey was completed, cases were weighted for\nvariation in within-household probability of selection in the\nhousehold sample and residual discrepancies between sample\nand population sociodemographic and geographic distribu-\ntions. The household and school samples were then merged\nwith sums of weights proportional to relative sample sizes ad-\njusted for design effects in estimating disorder prevalence. These\nweighting procedures are detailed elsewhere.20 The weighted\nsociodemographic distributions of the composite sample closely\napproximate those of the census population.21\nMEASURES\nDiagnostic Assessment\nAdolescents were administered a modified version of the World\nHealth Organization Composite International Diagnostic In-\nterview (CIDI),23 a fully structured interview administered by\ntrained lay interviewers. Previous factor analysis of lifetime\nDSM-IV disorders in the NCS-A demonstrated that they differ-\nentiated into the following 4 disorder classes24: (1) fear disor-\nders (social phobia, specific phobia, intermittent explosive dis-\norder, panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, and\nagoraphobia without history of panic disorder), (2) distress dis-\norders (separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety dis-\norder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and major de-\npressive disorder or dysthymia), (3) behavior disorders (conduct\ndisorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder), and (4) substance use disorders (al-\ncohol abuse with or without dependence and drug abuse with\nor without dependence). Although our finding that internal-\nizing disorders are best represented by separate fear and dis-\ntress dimensions is consistent with previous research,25,26 it is\nunclear how these dimensions will map onto the domains re-\ncently proposed in the National Institute of Mental Health re-\nsearch domain criteria.27\nParents provided information about adolescent symptoms\nof conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, attention-\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder, and major depressive disorder or\ndysthymia, disorders for which parent reports have previ-\nously been shown to have a large role in diagnosis.28,29 Parent\nand adolescent reports were combined at the symptom level\nusing an \"or\" rule, such that a symptom was considered pres-\nent if it was endorsed by either respondent. All the diagnoses\nwere made using DSM-IV organic exclusion rules. All but 2 di-\nagnoses were made using DSM-IV diagnostic hierarchy rules.\nThe exceptions were oppositional defiant disorder, which was\ndefined with or without conduct disorder, and substance abuse,\nwhich was defined with or without dependence.\nIn clinical reappraisal study,30 a subsample of NCS-A respon-\ndents was blindly reinterviewed using the Schedule for Affec-\ntive Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children\u00ad\nPresentandLifetimeVersion(K-SADS).Asreportedinmoredetail\nelsewhere,31 concordance between lifetime CIDI or SAQ and K-\nSADS diagnoses was good, with areas under the receiver oper-\ndisorder. Diagnoses of intermittent explosive disorder were not\nvalidated because this is not assessed in the K-SADS.\nChildhood Adversities\nThe NCS-A interviews and parent SAQs assessed 12 CAs. These\nincluded 3 types of interpersonal loss (parental death, paren-\ntal divorce, and other loss of contact with parents or care-\ngivers), 4 types of parental maladjustment (mental illness, sub-\nstance abuse, criminality, and family violence), 4 types of\nmaltreatment (physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse,\nand neglect), and family economic adversity. Parental death and\ndivorce were assessed only for biological parents, not steppar-\nents or other caregivers. However, the measure of other loss of\ncontact with parents or caregivers included any disruption of\na relationship that lasted for 6 months or longer that involved\na caregiver leaving the respondent's home (eg, the biological\nmother abandoned the family) or the respondent leaving home\n(eg, the individual was placed in foster care or was adopted).\nRespondents who were born to a single mother and never ex-\nperienced any further disruption of this parenting arrange-\nment were not coded as experiencing parental loss. We did not\ncode separations from caregivers that involved the respondent\nbeing placed in a juvenile detention center or running away from\nhome. We collected information on timing (ie, the respon-\ndent's age) for all parental loss events.\nPhysical and emotional abuse of the respondent by parents\nor caregivers was assessed using a modified version of the Con-\nflict Tactics Scales.32 Sexual abuse was assessed with questions\nfrom the CIDI about sexual assault, attempted rape, and rape.\n\u00a92012 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nInformation was also collected on the age at which sexual abuse\nfirst occurred. Neglect was assessed with a battery of questions\nused in investigations of child welfare that asked about the fre-\nquencies of having inadequate supervision, being required to\ndo chores that were age inappropriate, and not receiving ad-\nequate food, clothing, or medical care.33 Parental criminality\nwas assessed with questions in the CIDI and the SAQ about\nwhether a parent had engaged in criminal activities like bur-\nglary or the sale of stolen property or had ever been arrested or\nsent to prison for criminal activity.5 Parental mental illness (ma-\njordepression,generalizedanxietydisorder,panicdisorder,and\nsuicide attempt) and substance abuse were assessed using the\nFamily History Research Diagnostic Criteria Interview34 and its\nextensions,35 as well as with items completed by parents in the\nSAQ. Family violence was assessed using the modified Con-\nflict Tactics Scales and an item in the trauma section of the CIDI\nabout the respondent's age when he or she first observed in-\nterparentalviolence.Economicadversitywasassessedwithques-\ntions in the SAQ about whether the respondent's family had\nreceived welfare or other government assistance or often did\nnot have enough money to pay for basic necessities of living.\nANALYSIS\nThe associations of dichotomously scored CAs with first onset\nof psychiatric disorders were estimated using discrete-time sur-\nvival analysis with person-years as the unit of analysis,36 con-\ntrolling for respondent sex, age at interview, race/ethnicity (non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or other), and\nadditional DSM-IV/CIDI disorders with the onset before the fo-\ncal disorder under investigation. The controls for earlier-\nonset disorders were included to adjust for the associations of\nCAs with previous disorders and the associations of these dis-\norders with subsequent disorder onset. Several multivariate mod-\nels were estimated using the modeling approach developed in\nearlier work on this topic.4,16 Each model included dummy pre-\ndictor variables for CAs and controls. Model 1 was a series of\nbivariate models (ie, one CA at a time predicting disorders).\nModel 2 was an additive model that included a separate pre-\ndictor variable for each of 12 CAs. Model 3 included predictor\nvariables for a number of CAs without variables for specific types\nof CAs. Model 4 included 12 predictors for the type of CA and\nadditional predictors for the number of CAs, with the latter rep-\nresenting nonspecific interactions. Model 5 modified model 4\nby including separate counts of CAs associated with indica-\ntors of maltreatment and parental maladjustment or with other\nCAs. This distinction was based on evidence in our earlier adult\nstudy4 that maltreatment and parental maladjustment, which\nwe refer to collectively as indicators of maladaptive family func-\ntioning (MFF), were more important than other CAs in pre-\ndicting psychiatric disorders. Model 6 modified the counts in\nmodel 5 to distinguish aspects of MFF associated with harsh\ntreatment of the adolescent (physical abuse, sexual abuse, emo-\ntional abuse, and neglect) from other aspects of MFF (divorce,\ninterparental violence, parent mental illness, substance use dis-\norder, and criminality) based on the results of a factor analysis\nin the NCS-A that found this distinction in the data. Detailed\nresults of the factor analysis are available on request. Model 7\nincluded predictors not only for the type and number of CAs\nbut also for interactions between the type and number.\nThe Akaike information criterion (AIC)37 and the Bayesian\ninformation criteria (BIC)38 were used to select the best mul-\ntivariate model among models 2 through 7 to predict first on-\nset of any disorder based on a consolidated data file that stacked\n14 separate disorder-specific person-year data arrays and in-\ncluded 13 dummy variables to distinguish among these files,\nthereby forcing the estimated slopes of disorders on CAs to be\nconstant across 14 disorders. This best-fitting specification was\nthen used to predict first onset of psychiatric disorders within\neach of 4 DSM-IV disorder classes (fear, distress, behavior, and\nsubstance use disorders). Survival coefficients (standard er-\nrors [SEs]) were exponentiated and are reported as odds ra-\ntios (ORs) and 95% CIs.\nThe population-attributable risk proportions (PARPs) for the\noutcomes were computed for the best-fitting model to provide\na sense of the overall importance of CAs in predicting adoles-\ncent psychiatric disorders. The PARP is the proportion of ob-\nserved disorders that would not have occurred in the absence of\nCAs if the associations described in the survival coefficients re-\nflect causal effects of CAs.39 Although it is inappropriate to infer\ncausality from nonexperimental data, the calculation of the PARP\nis nonetheless useful to provide a sense of the magnitude of the\nassociations. The PARP was calculated using simulation meth-\nods to generate individual-level predicted probabilities of psy-\nchiatric disorders from the coefficients in the best-fitting model\nwith and without coefficients for CAs. The PARP is equal to 1\nminus the ratio of the predicted prevalence estimates in the 2\nspecifications.ThePARPforthepooleddatasetisthemeanPARP\nacross all psychiatric disorders based on a constant model across\ndisorders.

The types\nof CAs were always associated with increased odds of dis-\norder onset jointly (range, 2\nP  .001). Eight types of CAs were associated with the\nonset of behavior and substance use disorders, 6 with dis-\ntress disorders, and 4 with fear disorders. The MFF CAs\nwere significantly associated with the onset of fear, dis-\ntress, and substance use disorders (range, 2\n= 12.8, P = .12). In contrast, other CAs were associ-\nated with the onset of fear, distress, and behavior disor-\nders (range, 2\nP  .001) but not with substance use disorders (2\nP = .09) (Table 3).

For fear disorders, CAs\nwere most consistently associated with social phobia, spe-\ncific phobia, and intermittent explosive disorder and were\nunrelated to agoraphobia or panic disorder. For distress\ndisorders, CAs were most strongly and consistently as-\nsociated with PTSD, followed by major depressive dis-\norder or dysthymia; they were related less consistently\nto generalized anxiety disorder and were largely unre-\nlated to separation anxiety disorder. For behavior disor-\nders, CAs were associated most consistently with atten-\ntion-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Finally, CAs for\nsubstance use disorders were more consistently associ-\nated with alcohol abuse or dependence than with sub-\nstance abuse or dependence.\nTo evaluate whether the associations of CAs with psy-\nchiatric disorder onsets differed for male vs female re-\nspondents, we added interactions between sex and both\nthe type and the number of CAs to the best-fitting model.\nThe BIC indicated that the additive model fit the data best,\nwhile the AIC indicated that the interactive model fit best.\nGlobal 2 tests for the overall significance of interac-\ntions between CAs and sex were significant in predict-\ning any disorder, as well as each of 4 DSM-IV disorder\nclasses (range, 2\nspection of individual interactions found 12.0% to be sig-\nnificant at P  .05.

However, inspection of in-\ndividual interactions revealed no clear pattern of results,\nand only 6.0% of interactions were significant at P  .05.\nDetailed results are available on request.\nThe PARPs for the outcomes associated with CAs based\non the best-fitting model showed that CAs explain (in a\npredictive rather than a causal sense) 28.2% of all psy-\nof substance use disorders (Table 4). The MFF CAs were\nmore important than other CAs (23.7% vs 6.4%). The\nmost important individual CAs were parental criminal-\nity (9.2%) and parental mental illness (6.8%).\nCOMMENT\nThe results herein are limited in several ways. First, al-\nthough recall bias is expected to be less extreme in a sur-\nvey of adolescents than adults, recall bias is still a pos-\nsibility in NCS-A retrospective reports of CAs and lifetime\ndisorders. Special procedures shown experimentally to\nimprove the accuracy of reporting the age at onset of de-\npression41 were used to address this problem, but recall\nbias is impossible to eliminate completely. Second, our\nanalysis focused on the sample of adolescents for whom\nwe were able to obtain parent SAQs. It is possible that\nparents of adolescents with higher exposure to CAs were\nless likely to provide these SAQs, resulting in underes-\ntimation of CA prevalence. Third, the NCS-A assessed\nonly the timing of discrete CAs (parental loss events and\nsexual abuse), which means that some psychiatric dis-\norder onsets may have occurred before the CAs that we\nused as predictors. Reverse causation is a particular con-\ncern for behavior disorders because disruptive behavior\nproblems are known to increase the likelihood of harsh\nparenting.42,43 This limitation is especially important be-\ncause the associations of CAs with psychopathology may\nvary depending on the timing of exposure.44,45 Fourth,\nthe NCS-A lacks information on the frequency or sever-\nity of CAs. The stronger associations for MFF CAs than\nfor other CAs might, at least in part, be owing to this limi-\ntation. Fifth, our definition of CA was not exhaustive.\nWe focused specifically on family-related adversities, con-\nsistent with previous work,12,15 but numerous other ad-\nversities are associated with elevated risk for early-onset\nWithin the context of these limitations, the NCS-A re-\nsults suggest the following: that most US adolescents have\nbeen exposed to at least 1 of the CAs considered herein,\nthat exposure to multiple CAs is the norm among those\nexposed, that many of these CAs are significant corre-\nlates of child-adolescent mental disorders, that MFF CAs\n\u00a92012 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nare of special importance in this regard, and that the joint\nassociations of multiple CAs are subadditive. These re-\nsults are consistent with the findings in parallel stud-\nies4,16 of adults. The NCS-A results are similar for boys\nand girls and for adolescents from different racial/\nethnic backgrounds, a finding that is consistent with some\nprevious studies.49,50 We did not investigate whether the\nassociations vary as a function of socioeconomic status\nor other sociodemographic characteristics of respon-\ndents. This is a subject for future research.\nThe NCS-A results diverge in one way from previous\nadult studies,4,16 in that the latter investigations found little\nevidence of differential CA associations by disorder type.\nHowever, substantial variation of this sort is apparent in\nthe NCS-A because CAs are associated most strongly with\nbehavior and substance use disorders and least strongly\nwith fear disorders. The particularly strong associations\nwith substance use disorders and behavior disorders may\nreflect the relationships of CAs with the development of\nbrain areas related to impulsivity,51,52 a possibility that\nwarrants additional investigation in future research. One\nexplanation for the more specific pattern of associations\nin adolescents than in adults is that many of the disor-\nders unassociated with CAs in the NCS-A typically be-\ngin after adolescence.53 To evaluate this possibility, we\nconducted a more detailed analysis examining the asso-\nciations of CAs with individual disorders and found that\nthe CAs considered herein generally have the strongest\nassociations within DSM-IV disorder classes with the dis-\norders that have early ages at onset.53 For example, within\nthe fear disorders, CAs are more strongly associated with\nspecific phobia and social phobia than with panic disor-\nder or agoraphobia. This means that CAs are especially\nimportant in promoting the onset of temporally pri-\nmary disorders that, in turn, predict subsequent onsets\nof temporally secondary disorders.24 The one exception\nto this pattern is distress disorders, in which CAs are un-\nrelated to separation anxiety disorder, the disorder shown\nin previous research to have the earliest onset,24 and are\nassociated most strongly with PTSD, a condition with the\nlatest onset. The especially strong associations of CAs with\nPTSD in the NCS-A are consistent with prospective evi-\ndence indicating that CAs have particularly strong pre-\ndictive associations with this disorder.54\nWith regard to differential associations across CAs, pre-\nvious research identified stronger associations of sexual\nabuse than other CAs with subsequent onset of psychi-\natric disorders after accounting for other CAs.9,55-57 This\npattern was observed in the NCS-A as well. Indeed, the\nOR associated with sexual abuse was the largest or sec-\nond largest in predicting 3 (fear, distress, and substance\nabuse) of 4 DSM-IV disorder classes, as well as for 6 in-\ndividual disorders in these classes. Behavior disorders were\nthe only outcomes for which sexual abuse was not among\nthe strongest predictors. This pattern is consistent with\nour findings from an adult study.4\nTheevidenceofstrongco-occurrenceamongCAsisalso\nconsistent with previous work in adult samples4,16 and with\nprior studies12,58,59 of CAs in children and in adults. This\nhigh degree of co-occurrence suggests that previous stud-\nies focused on single CAs likely overestimated the impor-\ntance of those CAs. Furthermore, although the magni-\ntude of the associations of individual CAs with psychiatric\ndisorders is uniformly attenuated after adjustment for co-\noccurring CAs, virtually all the CAs continue to have sig-\nnificant associations with disorders in multivariate mod-\nels. This documents that no single CA or small group of\nCAs captures the full range of CA effects.\nThe results of the PARP analysis show that CAs are\nassociated with a substantial proportion of child-\nadolescent psychiatric disorder onsets, including more\nthan 40% of behavior disorder onsets and one-third of\ndistress and substance use disorder onsets. This is con-\nsistent with previous work in adult samples,4,16 although\nTable 4. Population-Attributable Risk Proportions (PARPs) Across Lifetime DSM-IV Disorder Classes Associated With\nChildhood Adversities (CAs) Among 6483 Adolescent-Parent Pairsa\nVariable\nDSM-IV Disorder Class\nAll Fear Distress Behavior Substance Abuse\naThe PARPs were calculated using simulation methods to generate individual-level predicted probabilities of the outcome disorders twice from the coefficients\nin the best-fitting model, the first time using all the coefficients in the model (probability of the disorder in those exposed to CAs) and the second time assuming\nthat the coefficients associated with CAs were all zero (probability of the disorder in those unexposed). One minus the ratio of the predicted prevalence estimates\nin the 2 specifications was then used to calculate the PARPs.\n\u00a92012 American Medical Association.

Because distress and substance use disorders have\nlater ages at onset,53 this pattern suggests that CAs may\nhavealargerroleinpredictingchild-adolescentonsetvari-\nants of certain distress and substance use disorders. In\ncontrast, CAs are associated with a smaller proportion\nof anxiety disorders in adolescents vs in the adult data\nated more strongly with early-onset than later-onset anxi-\nety disorders. The large PARPs in the NCS-A suggest that\nCAs are important as determinants of child-adolescent\nonsets of psychiatric mental disorders (causal risk fac-\ntors)orasmarkersofotherdeterminants(riskmarkers).60\nAs such, they represent promising targets for interven-\ntion efforts.\nThe NCS-A data cannot distinguish between the pos-\nsibility that CAs are causal risk factors rather than merely\nrisk markers. Only experimental studies can provide de-\nfinitive adjudication between these 2 possibilities. How-\never, experiments that randomly assign youth to expo-\nsure to CAs are virtually nonexistent, and interventions\nthat randomly assign youth to interventions aimed at ame-\nliorating the effects of these exposures are rare. The exis-\ntence of subadditive interactions among co-occurring CAs\nhas important implications for intervention planning be-\ncause the presence of these interactions implies that in-\nterventions aimed at protecting high-risk youth ex-\nposed to many CAs are unlikely to have strong effects if\nthey target only a subset of the adversities to which these\nyouth are exposed. The ameliorative effects of incremen-\ntal reductions in CAs would be expected to be small if\nharmful effects of incremental increases in CAs are small.\nWe would consequently expect interventions that ad-\ndress a large number of CAs (eg, home visiting pro-\ngrams aimed at preventing many different types of child\nmaltreatment61 or foster care62) to have much more pow-\nerful effects than interventions targeted at only one CA.63,64\nAlternatively, given the strong co-occurrence of the CAs\nexamined herein with parental psychopathology, inter-\nventions aimed at treating parents with psychiatric dis-\norders may also result in reductions in other CAs, such\nas maltreatment, criminal behavior, and family vio-\nlence. Indeed, some evidence suggests that successful\ntreatment of parental disorders can reduce psychopa-\nthology in children.65 We are unaware of any attempts\nto measure CAs among youth in such interventions, but\nthis would be useful information to obtain to allow an\nassessment of the extent to which intervention effects vary\nas a function of the number and type of CAs.\nCorrespondence: Ronald C.
