Extensive\nresearch has been so far unable to explain the aetiology of\nthis condition, whereas a growing body of evidence suggests\nthe involvement of environmental factors. Phthalates, given\ntheir extensive use and their persistence, are ubiquitous\nenvironmental contaminants. They are EDs (endocrine\ndisruptors) suspected to interfere with neurodevelopment.\nTherefore they represent interesting candidate risk factors\nfor ASD pathogenesis.

Nevertheless, it is difficult to determine how much of\nthis increase may be due to actual increase in the incidence or\nto increased awareness and diagnosis. The aetiology is\nunknown, but it is believed to result from disruption of normal\nneurobiological mechanisms primarily in the prenatal period\n(Nelson, 1991).

To the best of our clinical experience, not more\nthan 5% of all autism cases appear to be due primarily to single\ngene mutations. In particular, syndromic ASD accounts for 15\u00ad\n20% of ASDs, and other complex genetic factors appear to play\na major role in non-syndromic forms of autism. World literature\nevidence seems to indicate that autism has a strong genetic\nnot fully explain the prevalence of the disorder exponentially\nincreasing overthe last two decades. It is quite likely that\nexposure to potential environmental factors has differential\neffects depending on genetic background.\nAccording to our observation, the focus of autism research\nis shifting from purely genetic influences to multifactorial\ndiseases in which complex set of genes should be associated\nwith relevant environmental factors (Larsson et al., 2009;\nHerbert, 2010). To date, no information is available on the\npotential role in the pathogenesis of autism for phthalates,\nubiquitous contaminants (Griffiths et al., 1985; Bauer and\nHerrmann, 1997) used as plasticizers, solvents and additives in\nmany consumer products, i.e. vinyl flooring, wall coverings,\nfood containers and cosmetics (Schettler, 2006; Wormuth\net al., 2006). In particular, DEHP [di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate]\nrepresents one of the most commonly used plasticizer in\npharmaceutical and medical devices (U.S. FDA 2011). DEHP is\nprimarily metabolized to monoester, further oxidized in v\nand v-1 positions leading to a pool of secondary metabolites\nhypothesized that all DEHP metabolites, derived from a\nhydrolytic/oxidative pathway could, after glucuronidation, be\nexcreted in urine (Figure 1).\nChildren are known to be exposed to DEHP levels twice as\nhigh as those for adults (Hellerstedt et al., 2008; Wittassek\net al., 2009). Foetuses and neonates are highly sensitive to\nphysiologically active agents because they are exposed during\ncritical periods of human development (Latini et al., 2003; Kim\nin the case of intensive therapy procedures, neonates can have\nhigher exposure to phthalates and to their toxic monoesters\nsupposed to be EDs (endocrine disruptors) (Silva et al., 2003a,\nmother to the developing foetus across the placenta or to\nthe newborn through breast-feeding (Hines et al., 2009; Latini\net al., 2009). For these reasons, the French National Assembly\nhas required the ban of phthalates and parabens (Bill of Law\nadopted by French National Assembly on 3 May 2011).\nMoreover, very recently, prenatal phthalate exposure has been\nreported to decrease child mental/motor development, and\nincrease internalizing behaviour during the preschool years\n(Whyatt et al., 2011), thus consolidating the concept of an\nadverse effect of these contaminants on function of the CNS\n(central nervous system).\nThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the levels of\nthe primary and secondary metabolites of DEHP in autistic\nchildren by using innovative chemical reverse approach\nSubject population\nA total of 48 children with ASD (male: 36, female: 12; age at\nexamination: 11.0\u00a15 years) were recruited from the staff of\nChildren Neuropsychiatric Department, Siena, Italy.

Mean age at diagnosis was\nbetween 30 and 36 months. However, the diagnosis for the\nexamined ASDs population go back to procedures employed\nseveral years ago (today, mean age at the diagnosis for\ninfantile autism is about 18\u00ad24 months). Forty-five gender-\nand age-comparable HCs (healthy controls) [male: 25, female:\n20; age at examination: 12\u00a15 years] were randomly chosen\nfrom outpatients who had no pathological symptoms.\nUrine from children with ASD and HCs were collected in\npolypropylene specimen cups, divided into aliquots (1.0 ml) and\nfrozen at 220\u00b0C until analysis. Field blanks consisted in purified\nwater collected in polypropylene tubes and frozen at 220\u00b0C.\nDetermining secondary metabolites in urine\nThe metabolites measured in this study included: MEHP [mono-\n(2-ethylhexenyl) 1,2-benzenedicarboxylate] and 6-OH-MEHP\n[mono-(2-ethyl-6-hydroxyhexyl) 1,2-benzenedicarboxylate],\n5-oxo-MEHP [mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) 1,2-benzenedicar-\nboxylate] and 5-OH-MEHP [mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl)\n1,2-benzenedicarboxylate]. All these metabolites were synthe-\nsized in the Laboratory of Peptide and Protein Chemistry and\nBiology (PeptLab) following their previously described proced-\nure (Nuti et al., 2005). The unequivocally characterized\nsynthetic metabolites were used as pure analytical standards\n(.98% purity) for quantitative determination in urine from\nASD children and HCs.\nAll the solvents (acetonitrile, water, buffers, etc.), labware\n(polypropylene vials containing urine, solvent bottles, SPE\n(solid phase extraction) cartridge, Teflon capped-glass bottles,\npipettes) and instrumentation used during SPE procedure and\nthe HPLC-ESI-MS (HPLC electrospray ionization MS) analyt-\nical process, to detect MEHP and/or secondary metabolites\nin ASD patients and HCs, were verified to be MEHP\u00ad and\nsecondary oxidative metabolites-free. The internal standards\nwere prepared in acetonitrile and were used as reported in\nFirst morning urine specimens were collected. All speci-\nmens displayed urinary creatinine in the children reference\nvalue range, dependent on age and lean body mass (0.5\u00ad\n4.0 mg/kg per 24 h). For creatinine measurement, we used a\nSynchron AS/ASTRA clinical analyser (Beckman Instruments).\nWe used values (mg/l) for creatinine and (g/l) for dilution\ncorrection in the analyses.\nFor SPE treatment of urine, we prepared the following\nbuffers: ammonium acetate buffer 1 M, pH 6.5; acid buffer, pH\n2.0 by preparing a solution of NaH2\n; basic buffer was prepared by adding concentrated\nacetonitrile/water (200 ml). All buffers were stored in sealed\nbottles at room temperature (20\u00b0C): basic buffer was discarded\nafter 1 week, acid buffer after 1 month.\nHuman urines (1 ml) were defrosted, sonicated, mixed and\ndispensed in glass tubes. Then ammonium acetate buffer (250\nml, pH 6.5) was added. Incubation with b-glucoronidase (5 ml,\n200 units/ml, Roche Biochemical) was performed at 37\u00b0C for\n90 min, resulting in quantitative glucuronide hydrolysis of\nphthalates and metabolites. Escherichia coli K12 b-glucur-\nonidase has excellent glucuronidase activity and no mea-\nsurable lipase activity on phthalate diesters (Blount et al.,\ntreated with two steps of SPE, using SPE cartridge (3 ml/\n60 mg of Oasis HBL, Waters) to remove any contamination of\nbiological matrix, following the procedure described by\nBlount et al. (2000). The first cartridge was used to retain\nhydrophobic compounds while the phthalate metabolites\nwere eluted. The second cartridge was helpful in removing\nresidual salts. Analytes were finally eluted with acetonitrile\nand ethyl acetate, concentrated, re-suspended in water and\ntransferred into vials. All the samples were analysed by RP-\nHPLC-ESI-MS (reverse-phase HPLC-ESI-MS). One blank and\none QC (quality control) sample were included in each batch\nof samples. The QC sample was spiked with pooled urine and\nMEHP and secondary oxidative metabolite standards in\nknown concentration (200 ng/ml). When urine analysis\nresulted in values for metabolite concentrations exceeding\nthe linear range of the analytical method, we subjected a new\naliquot of the same sample to the entire process (deconjuga-\ntion and SPE) and we analysed again. Before analysis, known\nconcentration samples were treated by SPE and analysed by\nRP-HPLC-ESI-MS to test SPE efficiency. In our study the\nefficiency of SPE procedure is in accordance with the\nliterature (Mazzeo et al., 2007). Treated urine samples could\nbe stored at 4\u00b0C without degradation. Storage of untreated\nurines at 240\u00b0C for 6 months showed no decrease in\nphthalate monoester levels.\nThe analytical methodology adapted for measuring MEHP\nand secondary oxidative metabolites in urine had already\nbeen described in the literature (Blount et al., 2000; Silva\nIn particular, we used an HPLC tandem MS, RP-HPLC-ESI-\nMS (Waters, Alliance 2695, Waters, Micromass ZQ) equipped\nwith phenyl column (Betasil, 5 mm, 50 mm63 mm, Keystone\nScientific) and with a Waters 2996 Photodiode Array\nDetector.

Associations between\nvariables were tested by unvaried regression analysis. The\nefficiency of urinary phthalates metabolites in discriminating\nASD patients from HCs were evaluated using ROC (receiver\noperating characteristic) curve analyses. All analyses were\nconsidered to be statistically significant for P-values ,0.05. Cor-\nrection for multiple comparisons was made (Bonferroni's\ncorrection). The MedCalc version 9.5.2.0 statistical software\npackage (MedCalc Software) was used.\nRESULTS\nAmong the four metabolites (MEHP and secondary oxidative\nmetabolites) measured in urines of ASDs, we could detect\nurinary concentration with median values for MEHP (0.055\nand 5-oxo-MEHP (0.096 mg/ml). By contrast, in urine from\nHCs we found the following values for MEHP (0.028 mg/ml),\noxo-MEHP (0.04 mg/ml). However, the data illustrated in\nTable 2 are without urinary creatinine correction. Differences\nbetween groups by using creatinine-adjusted data were\ncomparable with those employing raw data (data not shown).\nThe statistical significance of variables was independent of\neffects of urinary creatinine concentration. In fact, it is well\nknown that urine concentration/dilution can affect the\nresults of measurements of urinary metabolites.\nWe found detectable levels of MEHP, 5-OH-MEHP and 5-\nrespectively (Table 1). Interestingly, 5-OH-MEHP was the\nmajor metabolite in terms of urine concentrations, followed\nby 5-oxo-MEHP and MEHP. Urinary excretion of 5-oxo-MEHP\nwas significantly higher in autistic patients compared with\ngender- and age-comparable HCs (Table 2). By contrast,\nHigh levels of 5-OH-MEHP were detected in 26.6% of HCs. A\nsignificant positive correlation between 5-OH-MEHP and 5-\noxo-MEHP could be observed only in autistic children\n(rs\n(rs\noxidized form of the metabolite pathway, corresponding to\n5-oxo-MEHP, had a specificity of 91.1% in identifying\nautistic children (Figure 2).\nThe efficiency of urinary secondary metabolites in\ndiscriminating ASD patients from HCs was evaluated using\nROC curve analyses (Figure 3, Tables 1 and 2).\nTable 1 ROC for DHEP secondary metabolite urinary excretion and infantile autism\nAUC, area under curve; 95% CI, 95% confidence intervals for the AUC; Sens., sensitivity; spec., specificity; +PV, positive value; 2PV, negative value;\nALL, total sum of all the examined di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate secondary metabolites (5-OH-MEHP+5-oxo-MEHP+6-OH-MEHP+MEHP).\nUrinary phthalate Cut-off AUC\u00a1S.E.M. 95% CI P-value Sens (%) Spec.

Total CARS scores were (means\u00a1S.D.)\nscores and urinary MEHP levels was observed (r50.429,\nlevels of the other examined metabolites were found (total\nMoreover, we compared ASDs with n510 patients with Rett\nsyndrome (a genetic form of autism due in up to 95% of cases to\nmutation of a gene, i.e. MeCP2), urinary phthalate metabolites\nappear to be, once again, significantly elevated in ASD patients\n(Table 3). Actual behaviour for most patients with Rett\nsyndrome is not autistic even if all of them do show autistic\ntraits during stage 2 of the disease. Therefore 5-oxo-MEHP urin-\nary excretion appears to be lower in Rett syndrome (P50.0344),\nMEHP (P50.7098) excretion is comparable with that observed in\nHCs, despite the heavy medication needed in this multi-system\ngenetic disease. These results indicate that medications are likely\nnot the main cause for the increased urinary phthalate excretion\nevidenced in ASDs, while suggesting the likely intervention of\nenvironmental factors in the pathogenesis of this pervasive\ndevelopment disorder.\nDISCUSSION\nAs ASDs are disorders of brain development, any factors that\nregulate brain development and are known to be altered in autism\nshould be considered as possibly contributing to the phenotype.\nOur findings, for the first time, demonstrate an association\nbetween phthalates and ASDs. It is interesting to note that, in\n87% of the ASD urine samples, we detected MEHP and\n5-oxo-MEHP levels higher than the levels recently reported,\nby Cho et al. (2010). In that study Cho et al. reported a\npossible relationship between environmental phthalate expo-\nsure (external contamination) and the intelligence level of\n667 school-age children randomly recruited from nine\nelementary schools in five South Korean cities. The reported\nmedian values were for MEHP (0.055 mg/ml), 5-OH-MEHP\nspot urines are among the most commonly used samples in\nclinical toxicology, we showed the data unadjusted for\ncreatinine. In fact, in epidemiological studies it is not\npractical to collect 24 h urine samples or, when young\nchildren are involved, even first morning voids. In particular,\nspot urines have also been used in a widely promoted paper\nrelating maternal urinary-phthalate metabolite excretion in\nmothers to psychomotor development in their children at age\n3, recently published (Whyatt et al., 2011). Likewise in ASDs,\nMEHP was found to be the minor urinary metabolite\ncompared with the corresponding oxidized metabolites as in\nsome adult metabolic diseases (Wittassek and Angerer, 2008).\nIt is possible to hypothesize that, in the case of ASDs, a high\nMEHP urinary excretion does not correspond to external\ncontamination, but rather MEHP could likely act as an ED.\nFrom our data it is possible to speculate that phthalate\nmetabolites as EDs may play an important and previously not\nrecognized role either in the neurotransmitter system and/or in\nneurodevelopment, possibly increasing the risk of ASDs. In any\ncase, our findings indicate for the first time that specific DEHP\nmetabolites are statistically significantly increased in ASDs. It is\nintriguing that urinary levels of the most oxidized form of the\nDEHP metabolites (5-oxo-MEHP) is able to efficiently discrim-\ninate ASDs from HCs (Figure 2). Nevertheless, it has already\nFigure 2 Differences between groups: scatterplots for 5-oxo-MEHP\nData are medians and inter-quartile range.\nFigure 3 ROC curve analysis (ASD patients versus HC) for DEHP\nmetabolites\nSecondary metabolite detection in autism\nE 2012 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nbeen reported that the most oxidized DEHP metabolites have\nlonger half-life of excretion in urine (Koch et al., 2006).\nTherefore it is possible that environmental factors and OS\n(oxidative stress) imbalance may interact in leading to\nincreased ASD risk, although further investigation is needed\nin dissecting this interaction in vivo.\nA link between oxidative brain damage and ASD has been\npreviously reported by several authors (James et al., 2004;\nthe last few years, our team has demonstrated that the\nbiological 'duo' hypoxia\u00adOS is a key player in modulating\ngenotype\u00adphenotype expression in Rett syndrome, a well-\nestablished genetic form of ASD (De Felice et al., 2009;\nMoreover, in previous reports, a correlation between OS\nand ASD has been widely explored by measuring different\nmolecules, possibly coming from oxidative pathway as\nmetabolic biomarkers of OS, in biological fluids (Chauhan\nTo the best of our knowledge, a strict relationship between OS\nentity and the in vivo presence of oxidized forms of DEHP has\nnot been reported before. Therefore we could speculate that, in\nsusceptible subjects, DEHP exposure, when finding OS condi-\ntions, can lead to in vivo accumulation of toxic metabolites (i.e.\nthe oxidized phthalate metabolites), possibly acting as EDs.\nConsidering that urinary 5-oxo-MEHP reported in our study as\nincreased in ASDs compared with HCs, we can state that our\nfindings are in agreement with an increased OS environment.\nMoreover, phthalates are known as EDs, but it is unclear\nhow they could be involved in aetiology of neurodevelop-\nment disorders. Phthalate metabolites activate a-PPARa\n(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a), interfering\nwith cellular proliferation and lipid metabolism. Activation of\nPPARa by phthalates may alter lipid metabolism in the brain\n(Clark-Taylor and Clark-Taylor, 2004). Recently the signal\ntransduction pathway of PPARa was correlated with\nprogression of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases.\nPhthalates also interfere with the TH (thyroid hormone)\nsystem by inducing hypothyroidism. Recent studies correlated\nin utero hypothyroxinaemia to decreased intellectual capa-\ncity, mental retardation and ASD (Roman, 2007), thus\nreinforcing our speculation. Moreover, exposure to DBP (di-\nn-butyl phthalate) seems to affect thyroid activity in\npregnant women, thus leading to adverse effects on the\nOn the other hand, transient intra-uterine deficits of THs\nhave been shown to result in permanent alterations of\ncerebral cortex similar to those found in brains of children\nwith autism (Roman, 2007). As a consequence, the current\nsurge of this disease could be related to transient maternal\nhypothyroxinemia resulting from exposure to anti-thyroid\nenvironmental contaminants.\nFor the first time in this study we correlated different\nlevels of the primary and secondary metabolites with ASDs\ncompared with HC children. These data generate the idea that\neither current exposure is higher in children with ASD, or\nalternatively, and more likely, ASD children may differ in their\nability to metabolize phthalates.\nIn conclusion, our findings generate the idea that prenatal\nplus postnatal phthalate exposure may have synergistic and\ncumulative actions affecting brain development, thus pos-\nsibly contributing to the ASD phenotype, according to the\ngeneral concept generated by Herbert (2010) of 'environ-\nmentally vulnerable physiology'. Therefore a prenatal/\npostnatal screening for urinary DEHP metabolites in the\npopulation at high risk for ASDs could have an important\nsocial impact.\n"
