    "reduced_content": "Suicide is a public health problem of enormous consequence,\n11th leading cause of death in the United States (1). Although\nseveral risk factors for completed suicide are established,\n\nsuicide rates have declined only slightly in recent decades (2),\nunderscoring the need to identify new, potentially remediable\nsuicide risk factors.\nThe epidemic of obesity in the United States has spurred\nincreasing interest in its relationship with mental health\ndisorders. If obesity is positively associated with depression\nand anxiety symptoms, as is commonly found (3,4), it might\nbe hypothesized that overweight and obese individuals would\nhave a higher risk of suicide. Surprisingly, a large series of\nprospective studies have now found the opposite (5\u00ad12), with\nrelatively consistent lower risks of completed suicide with\ngreater BMI. However, the possibility of confounding of BMI\nat the individual-level, particularly by changes in weight related\nto depression, has not been fully resolved. To date, only one\nnationally representative study had addressed this association\n(12), leaving its generalizability to the broader population of\nUS adults uncertain. Further, no previous study has examined\nBMI, suicide attempts, completed suicides, and method-\nspecific case\u00adfatality ratios simultaneously, an approach that\nallows us to explore possible mechanisms empirically.\nTo determine the association of BMI with risk of completed\nsuicide across the United States, we conducted an ecological\nanalysis of statewide rates of obesity, suicide attempts, and\ncause-specific completed suicides, based upon representative\nsurveysconductedthroughouttheUnitedStatesinrecentyears.\nBecause statewide rates of obesity are not subject to the same\nconfounding factors as individual BMI, these analyses offer the\nopportunity to re-examine the BMI\u00adsuicide \nrelationship with\na complementary approach.\nMethods And Procedures\nWe compiled state-level information on risk factors and rates of\nattempted and completed suicides from a variety of contemporaneous\nsources. In virtually all cases, the rank ordering of states for these factors\nis nearly identical year-to-year during the time period under study.\nSuicide mortality data for each state were obtained through the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention's Web-based Injury Statistics Query\nand Reporting System (13). Suicide data were further grouped by firearm\nBMI and Rates of Suicide in the United States:\nAn Ecological Analysis\nKenneth J. Mukamal1, Christina C. Wee1 and Matthew Miller2\nBMI has been inversely associated with risk of completed suicide in several cohort studies, but putative mechanisms\nfor this association and its generalizability throughout the United States are uncertain. We ascertained recent population-\nbased, state-level data on rates of obesity, completed suicide (by method), firearm ownership, smoking, major\ndepression, income, education, white race, and nonmetropolitan residence, compiled from federal agencies and surveys,\nand determined the adjusted population-weighted correlations of statewide obesity rates with measures of completed\nand attempted suicide. Statewide prevalence of obesity was strongly inversely correlated with ageadjusted suicide\nrate (multivariable-adjusted r = -0.66; P < 0.001). The correlation was somewhat stronger for rates of nonfirearm-related\ncorrelations of firearm prevalence with suicide rate (r = 0.75; P < 0.001) or of obesity with prevalence of diabetes (r = 0.41;\nP = 0.006). In analyses of fatal and nonfatal suicidal acts, obesity rates were inversely correlated with rates of suicidal\nalso inversely correlated with the case\u00adfatality ratios of acts using poisoning (r = -0.51; P = 0.01). Thus, statewide rates\nof obesity are strongly inversely correlated with rates of completed suicide in multivariable analyses, a finding that\nappears to relate to fewer attempts by suffocation and a lower case\u00adfatality ratio for poisonings, although the mechanism\nfor the inverse correlation with firearm-related suicides requires further elucidation.\n1Department of Medicine, Division of General Medicine and Primary Care, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; 2Department of Health\nPolicy and Management, Harvard School of Public Heath, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

The case\u00adfatality ratio for a particular\nmethod is defined as the state-specific number of completed\nsuicides with that method divided by the number of completed\nsuicides and hospitalizations (estimated by HCUP) with that\nmethod. As a result, the case\u00adfatality ratios calculated here are\nslight underestimates because the small number of hospitaliza-\ntions that result in death are double-counted (15).\nState-level data on the percentage of individuals living in\nhouseholds with firearms (gun prevalence) were obtained from\nthe 2004 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)\nrespondents in 2004), is an ongoing data collection program\nsponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\nwith all 50 states participating.

These data are publicly \navailable\n(http://factfinder.census.gov/).\nStatistical analysis\nBecause we have previously found BMI and firearm \nownership\nto be positively associated on an individual basis in the BRFSS\n(19), all results were adjusted for firearm ownership. As\ndescribed previously (20), we performed population-weighted\nPearson correlations of state-specific rates of obesity, age-\nadjusted suicide, and related factors, including all 50 states.\nThese analyses estimate the cross-sectional correlation across\nstates of two continuously distributed characteristics--the\nprevalence of obesity and the age-adjusted rate of suicide--\nwhile adjusting for covariates. Population weighting gives\ngreater influence to larger states, where more suicides occur,\nbut we also tested our results without such weighting.\nBoth obesity and suicide were approximately normally\ndistributed; joint tests of skewness and kurtosis did not reject\nnormality in either case (P = 0.77 and P = 0.10). Initial models\nderived partial correlation coefficients with adjustment for\nfirearm prevalence; multivariable models further adjusted for\nstatewide prevalence of white non-Hispanic race/ethnicity,\ncollege education, current smoking, and nonmetropolitan area\nresidence, and state-specific median household income and\ncomposite depression index score. To examine the magnitude\nof change in state-specific suicide rates with increments of\nrates of obesity, we performed linear regression models, using\nthe same variables as in multivariable correlation models, with\nrobust standard errors.\nWe first examined the associations of obesity with total\nsuicide mortality, then examined its associations with suicide\nrelated to firearms and suffocation (methods with generally\nhigh case\u00adfatality ratios), and poisonings. Analyses of case\u00ad\nfatality were restricted to the 26 states in the HCUP, although\nthe association of BMI and suicide was similar in these states as\nin the entire United States. None of the associations of BMI and\nsuicide were significantly changed if the prevalence of normal\nweight, rather than obesity, was used (observed correlations\nwere in the inverse direction, as expected).\nWe attempted to provide context for these associations in\ntwo ways. First, we examined the correlation of obesity rates\nwith rates of diabetes, a disorder with perhaps the best-known\nassociation with obesity. Second, we recalculated the correla-\ntion of suicide rate with firearm prevalence, which we have\npreviously demonstrated to be very strongly associated with\nAll analyses were performed with Stata Intercooled 10.1\n(StataCorp, College Station, TX).

In comparison, the\ncorrelation coefficient in these models for firearm prevalence\nstatistically\nsignificant was the proportion of population that was white\ncorrelation coefficient\nIn linear regression models, an increase in the statewide\nprevalence of obesity of 3% (the standard deviation in obesity\nrates) was associated with a decrease in the age-adjusted\nto -3.7). This corresponds to roughly the difference between\nthe 50th and 75th percentiles of state-specific suicide rates.\nWhen states were categorized in quartiles of obesity rates,\nthere was a stepwise decrease in age-adjusted suicide rates\nacross quartiles, with decreases of -0.2 (95% confidence\nascending quartiles.\nWe conducted several sensitivity analyses to test the\nrobustness of our findings.

Without population weighting, the\nmultivariable-adjusted correlation of obesity and completed\nsuicide was similar but numerically higher (r = -0.68; P <\n0.001).

The multivariable-adjusted correlation\nof obesity with nonfirearm-related suicide (r = -0.75; P <\n0.001) was higher than that with firearm-related suicide. For\nthe latter, multivariable adjustment substantially strengthened\nthe correlation, predominately due to addition of smoking\nand race/ethnicity as covariates. Among nonfirearm-related\nmethods, obesity appeared to be similarly associated with both\npoisonings and suffocation.\nTable 3 presents the correlation of obesity rates with\nstatewide rates of suicidal acts (i.e., attempted and completed\nsuicides) and statewide case\u00adfatality ratios for specific methods\nin 26 US states.

In addition, obesity rates were correlated\nwith lower state-specific case\u00adfatality ratio for poisonings but\nnot for other methods.\nDiscussion\nIn this study of statewide rates of obesity and suicide, higher rates\nof obesity were strongly correlated with lower rates of completed\nsuicide.Therewerelowerratesoffirearm-relatedandnonfirearm-\nrelated suicides, related to fewer firearm and suffocation-related\nacts and a lower case\u00adfatality ratio for poisonings.\nAn emerging body of literature supports an inverse\nrelationship of BMI with risk of suicide death. In Paffenbarger\nand Asnes' original study of male college students, the\nponderal index (height divided by the cube root of weight--a\nmarker of leanness) was significantly higher among men who\nlater committed suicide than among controls (5). Subsequent\nstudies in recent years have also found an inverse relationship\nof BMI and risk of suicide, particularly among Scandinavian\npopulations (6\u00ad8,10) (who have among the highest rates of\nsuicide worldwide); other, generally smaller studies have also\nsuggested an inverse relationship (9,11,12). An ecological\nstudy in the Caribbean Islands was null, but did not account\nfor firearm availability (25). In the Norwegian HUNT Study,\nBMI was inversely associated with risk of suicide despite a\ngenerally positive association with depression (7).\nOur results extend these previous findings in several\npotentially important ways. First, studies of BMI and health\noutcomes are prone to individual-level confounding (26) by\nhealth conditions and behaviors (like smoking (27)) that lead\nto both lower weight and higher risk of completed suicide.\nDepression has been hypothesized to be one such confounder,\nalthough it is possible that adiposity itself influences mood,\nimplicating depression as a potential intermediate rather than\na confounder alone. Regardless, statewide levels of obesity\nare highly unlikely to be influenced by weight loss related to\nmedicalconditionssuchasdepression,asuppositionsupported\nby the weak correlation of obesity and depression at the state\nlevel. As a result, our results strongly imply that the lower risk\nof completed suicide associated with heavier BMI is not merely\nthe result of confounding by such factors.\nSecond,oursisthefirststudytoourknowledgetorelateobesity\nto method-specific rates of suicide attempts, completed suicides,\nand case\u00adfatality ratio. Our results preliminarily implicate\nspecific mechanisms that may play a role in the observed BMI\u00ad\nsuicide association, although these will require confirmation in\nprospective studies. For example, obesity rates were associated\nwith lower case\u00adfatality ratios from poisoning, a result that, while\nintuitive, has not been previously established. Also, obesity rates\nwere associated with lower rates of acts by suffocation (which\nprimarily includes hanging), a method that tends to have a high\ncase\u00adfatality ratio (28,29). Although the rationale for this lower\nrate is necessarily speculative, the steps involved in hanging may\nbe burdensome, uncomfortable, or otherwise aversive for heavier\nindividuals. The correlation of obesity rates with lower rates of\ncompleted suicides and suicidal acts using firearms requires\nfurther investigation. However, firearm suicides often appear\nimpulsive (30,31), and hence this observation is consistent with\nthe hypothesis that high circulating insulin levels influence\ntryptophan metabolism and reduce impulsivity (6,32,33).\nThird, our results provide the most current and generalizable\ninformation available to date about BMI and suicide in the\nUS population. Because of the relative rarity of suicide in\ncohort studies, they necessarily require very large, typically\nunrepresentative samples followed for long periods of time to\naccrue sufficient numbers of completed suicides. As a result,\nevenrecentstudiesofthistopicrelyuponmeasurementsofBMI\ncollected one to two decades in the past, and do not necessarily\nreflect the current experience of the broader US population.\nOur findings, synthesized within the last few years from high-\nquality, nationally representative surveys administered by\nhighlyexperiencedfederalagencies,extendtheresultsofcohort\nstudies to a larger and more contemporaneous audience.\nEven if the relationship observed in this study were causal,\nthe risks of obesity far outweigh any potential benefit on\nsuicide prevention. Indeed, using this same approach, we\nclearly identified the expected strong correlation between\nrates of obesity and diabetes. However, the magnitude of\ncorrelation with obesity was nearly identical for diabetes and\ncompleted suicide, despite the far greater body of evidence\nlinking adiposity with diabetes. Given this, we urge that more\nattention and resources be devoted to the mechanisms by\nwhich obesity may influence suicide risk, given how strongly\nthese \nfactors relate.\nTable 3 Partial population-weighted Pearson correlation coefficients among 26 US states between prevalence of obesity\nand suicidal acts or method-specific case\u00adfatality ratio\nSuicidal acts (completed + attempted) Case\u00adfatality ratio (completed/total)\nTotal Firearms Suffocation Poisonings\nOther\nmethods Firearms Suffocation Poisonings\nOther\nmethods\nAdjusted for\nfirearm ownership\nMultivariable-\nadjusted\nSuicidal acts represent the sum of fatal suicidal acts reported on death certificate and suicide attempts admitted to medical hospitals. Multivariable models included\nstatewide prevalence of firearm ownership, white non-Hispanic race/ethnicity, college education, current smoking, and nonmetropolitan area residence, and median\nhousehold income and composite depression index.\narticles\n \nOur analyses have strengths but also limitations. All\necological studies are limited by an inability to infer that the\nobserved relationships apply to individuals, rather than to the\ngroups (in this case, the states) under study. That is, the BMI of\nindividuals who commit suicide may not, in fact, differ across\nstates regardless of overall state rates of obesity. However, our\nprevious findings from cohort studies provide substantial\nreassurance that BMI and suicide are indeed linked at both the\nindividual and state levels. We were also limited to 50 units\nof observation (i.e., states) for analyses of completed suicide\nand to 26 states for analyses that included attempted suicide,\nrestricting the power of our analyses, and to rates of obesity\nand suicide measured at a single cross-section in time. Further\nstudies that evaluate changes in obesity and suicide rates\nlongitudinally may provide additional insight into these issues\n(24); on a national level, the 1990s saw increases in obesity rates\nbut declines in suicide rates that support our findings (2).\nIn conclusion, states with higher rates of obesity tend to have\nlower adjusted rates of completed suicide, with a magnitude\nof correlation similar to other well-established correlates of\nobesity and suicide. Obesity rates also tend to be associated\nspecifically with lower rates of suicidal acts using firearms\nand suffocation, two of the methods most likely to prove fatal,\nand with a lower case\u00adfatality ratio for poisonings. Given the\nstrength of the observed relationships, further research to\nidentify its mechanisms could lead to important insights into\nprevention of this important cause of death.\n"
