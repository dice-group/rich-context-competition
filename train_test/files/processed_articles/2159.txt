We present a social network model of peer effects with ex ante\nheterogeneous agents and show how conformism and deterrence affect\ncriminal activities. We then bring the model to the data by using a very detailed\ndata set of adolescent friendship networks. A novel social network\u00adbased\nempirical strategy allows us to identify peer effects for different types of crimes.\nWe find that conformity plays an important role for all crimes, especially for\npetty crimes. This suggests that, for juvenile crime, an effective policy should\nbe measured not only by the possible crime reduction it implies but also by\n1. Introduction\nA large literature has developed on the general causes of, and the impact of\npublic policy on, crime. Yet, no consensus has emerged on quite basic issues,\nsuch as, for example, the effects of incentives, both positive and negative, on\ncrime.\nJuvenile crime is an important aspect of this debate. According to the US\nDepartment of Justice, juveniles were involved in 16% of all violent arrests\njuveniles are held in residential placement on any given day in the United\nUniversit\u00b4\na di Roma \"La Sapienza\", Facolta di Scienze Statistiche, P.le Aldo Moro, 5-00185,\nRome, Italy.
