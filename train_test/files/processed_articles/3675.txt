    "abstract": "Abstract\nTreatment fidelity is associated with improvement in research outcomes and increased confidence in significant findings.\nHowever, few studies report on recommended areas of treatment fidelity (i.e., study design, training, treatment delivery,\ntreatment receipt, and treatment enactment), leaving a dearth of information about implementation components that\ncontributed to a study's success. Without such information, it is difficult for researchers to correctly assess previous findings\nand for practitioners to correctly implement findings into practice. Thus, it is crucial that studies assess both treatment fidelity\nand applicability of treatment fidelity findings. We report measures of treatment fidelity in a randomized controlled trial of\nan intervention promoting colonoscopy in at-risk relatives of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. We describe assessments\nrelated to both treatment delivery and treatment receipt. We conducted separate ANCOVAs to model the change in each\nof the treatment receipt variables, comparing the two intervention arms. Compared with the control group, the intervention\ngroup had significantly greater improvements in CRC knowledge (f = 17.46, p < .0001), perceptions about susceptibility (f =\n(f = 19.59, p < .0001) from baseline to 1-month follow-up. Overall, our study adhered to most of the best-practice guidelines\nfor behavioral intervention fidelity. This demonstrates that our intervention was delivered as intended and positively affected\nthe cognitive processes that are purported to be predictive of adherent behavioral outcomes.\n",

Adherence to and\nreporting of treatment fidelity may seem like obvious tasks\nin any study, yet they are rarely published in relation to spe-\ncific behavioral intervention trials (Resnick et al., 2005). The\nlack of assurance that a study has been conducted according\nto protocol opens up the door to error when new studies build\nupon previous outcomes. Monitoring and reporting treat-\nment fidelity assure scientific transparency in a way that\nfacilitates reproducibility, as it both reports on and appraises\nstudy process methods. In addition, treatment fidelity mea-\nsures can be used to facilitate theoretical testing, to provide\nan outline for research dissemination in clinical practice, and\nto reduce random and unintended variability (Bellg et al.,\nChange Consortium recommends five areas of treatment\nfidelity best practices: study design, training, treatment\n1Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT, USA\n2University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, USA\n3Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand\n4University of Texas\u00adHouston Health Science Center, USA\n5Rutgers Cancer Institute, New Jersey, USA\n6University of New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nRebecca G.

Such low numbers indicate a dearth of\nimportant information about the processes by which behav-\nioral science research is being conducted. More recently, the\n2004 treatment fidelity recommendations have been\nexpanded, providing specific criteria for treatment fidelity\nassessment in each of the five fidelity categories (Borrelli,\n2011). In general, studies with higher treatment fidelity\n(according to the checklist of the 25 treatment fidelity attri-\nbutes) were more likely to demonstrate significant results\nthan studies with low treatment fidelity (Resnick et al.,\n2005). These findings highlight important considerations for\nthose interested in optimizing intervention research.\nYet, the importance of treatment fidelity to future research\nhas been contested by some researchers who argue that\nstrong adherence to fidelity measures presents potentially\nimportant limitations both to the study implementing these\nprocedures and to future research dissemination. In an article\nresponding to Bellg et al. (2004), Leventhal and Friedman\n(2004) presented concerns that treatment fidelity may impede\npersonalized medicine; if providers must adhere to rigorous\nguidelines, it may inhibit their ability to provide individual-\nized care where a situation requires it.\nLeventhal and Friedman (2004) also questioned the valid-\nity of treatment receipt, asserting that true comprehension of\na concept may be a more complex process than the ability to\nregurgitate knowledge. Furthermore, they argue that under-\nstanding may not be necessary in facilitating behavior\nchange. Finally, they expressed concerns that the idea of\ntreatment enactment may be indistinguishable from treat-\nment adherence (or study outcome). Leventhal and Friedman\n(2004) contested that this concept of enactment is highly\ndependent on the kind of study being conducted, and may not\nbe measurable under all circumstances. If an intervention\ndoes not involve participants learning a set of measurable\nskills, it may not be practical to attempt to assess for\nenactment.\nIn addition, Leventhal and Friedman (2004) and others\nargued that treatment fidelity, while potentially useful in pro-\nviding confidence in outcome efficacy, may actually impede\nflexibility when translated into clinical practice or when\nimplemented in future studies where conditions may differ in\nboth the populations being targeted and the resources avail-\nable. They question the value of treatment fidelity against the\nreality of adaptation in real-world settings. Hawe et al.\n(2008) echoed this concern in their response to Spillane et\nal.'s (2007) report of treatment fidelity in a randomized con-\ntrolled trial on heart disease prevention, noting that interven-\ntions that are tailored to context may be more effective than\nstudies intent on direct translation according to fidelity\nmeasures. Cohen et al. (2008) found that changes to inter-\nventions when translated into practice settings are both com-\nmon and, often, unanticipated.\nThese critiques present important considerations to exam-\nine for those who wish to implement treatment fidelity best\npractices in their study interventions. Critical assessment and\nevaluation of treatment fidelity measures increase confi-\ndence that Type I or Type II errors did not occur, thereby\nproviding assurance that unplanned effects of protocol devi-\nations do not lead to acceptance or rejection of study hypoth-\neses. However, research that identifies treatment fidelity\nmust also be willing to discuss how to incorporate elements\nof successful studies into practical, real-world scenarios, to\nallow for tailored implementation.\nThis article aims to address both the identified benefits\nand the potential limitations to treatment fidelity reporting\nby examining treatment fidelity in the context of the Family\nColorectal Cancer Awareness and Risk Education (Family\nCARE) Project, a randomized controlled trial of an innova-\ntive telehealth intervention that aimed to improve colonos-\ncopy uptake in individuals considered to be at intermediate\nrisk of familial colorectal cancer (CRC). Specifically, we\nexamined and evaluated treatment fidelity as defined accord-\ning to the five best-practice areas (Bellg et al., 2004, Borrelli\net al., 2005). We also identified and assessed potential limita-\ntions to existing treatment fidelity measures, and discuss the\ntranslatability of our intervention to future research and clin-\nical practice.\nMethod\nStudy Design and Participants\nFamily CARE was a randomized controlled trial investigat-\ning whether a personalized, remote, theoretically based risk-\nassessment, and counseling intervention was more effective\nthan a mailed, low-intensity targeted print message delivered\nto individuals who are considered at intermediate familial\nrisk for CRC. Research staff conducted a three-tiered recruit-\nment process: (a) identifying CRC patients through popula-\ntion-based cancer registries, (b) contacting these patients to\nrequest information about their at-risk relatives, and (c) con-\ntacting identified relatives (Simmons et al., 2013). At-risk\nfamily members who enrolled in the study were randomized\nby family unit to either the tailored intervention group\n(TeleCARE) or the minimal intervention group (PRINT). A\ndetailed description of the study methods and outcome is\nprovided elsewhere (Kinney et al., 2014; Pengchit et al.,\nate-risk family members of CRC patients, representing 337\nfamilies, were enrolled and randomized between September\nparticipating institutions approved all study procedures.\nFigure 1 provides a CONSORT diagram from initial assess-\nment through 1-month post-intervention evaluation.\nSimmons et al. 3\nWe assessed treatment fidelity using the checklist created\nby the NIH Behavior Change Consortium (Bellg et al., 2004)\nand expanded by Borrelli (2011). Figure 2 outlines the\nabsence or presence of best practices in the Family CARE\nstudy. Items that could not be implemented, due to study\ndesign, are noted. After outlining these best practices and\ntheir implementation, we evaluated fidelity measures of\ntreatment delivery and treatment receipt.\nTreatment Fidelity Adherence Step 1: Study\nDesign\nTheoretical models. We primarily used the Extended Parallel\nProcess Model (EPPM) to guide the TeleCARE intervention\nthat effective risk communication is optimal if individuals\nbelieve that the threat of a disease or health condition is per-\nsonally relevant (perceived susceptibility) and serious (per-\nceived severity), that the recommended action will help\nmitigate their risk (response efficacy), and that they have the\ntools necessary to execute the risk-mitigating action (self-\nWe used a motivational interviewing (MI) style of coun-\nseling for the TeleCARE telephone counseling facet of the\nintervention. MI is a directive counseling technique tradi-\ntionally used when patient ambivalence is a barrier to posi-\ntive action (Miller & Rollnick, 2009). Counselors use\nquestions and statements to strategically build rapport, elicit\ntalk in support of change, and collaborate with the patient on\na plan. Detailed explanation of the theoretical components as\nwell as the steps of the TeleCARE intervention is provided\nPilot testing. We conducted pilot testing prior to implement-\ning the Family CARE study. Pilot testing took place at the\nHuntsman Cancer Institute in January and February 2009,\nwith 35 CRC patients and their adult family members.\nPiloted intervention materials included all recruitment letters\nand brochures, the educational pamphlet intended for the\nPRINT arm, and the baseline questionnaire and cover letter.\nWe revised study materials according to pilot participant\nsuggestions.\nStudy contact.

Adherence to treatment fidelity best practicesa: Family CARE trial.\naThis checklist is based on the expanded treatment fidelity recommendations provided by Borelli (2011).\nbRatings included possible options: present (P), absent but should be present (A), and not applicable (NA).\nSimmons et al. 5\naverage of 39 min (SD = 12.2). We examined the primary\noutcome of the study (colonoscopy uptake by 9 months) in\nthe 9-month follow-up questionnaire. We also examined\nintermediate study endpoints, including participant experi-\nences and knowledge, sooner than at the 9-month follow-up.\nThus, our study protocol included contacting participants\nfrom both arms at baseline, 1 month, 9 months, and 15\nmonths post-intervention.\nProtocol monitoring. The TeleCARE sessions were audiotaped\nto assure fidelity and provide feedback to counselors. Prior\nto the intervention, counselors obtained permission from par-\nticipants to record the session. During the session, each\ngenetic counselor used a protocol checklist (referred to here-\nafter as the Family CARE checklist), to assure that all steps\nof the intervention were completed. Two study staff mem-\nbers randomly selected intervention audiotapes for review\nand individually completed the Family CARE checklist\nwhile they listened to the audio recordings. After reviewing\neach tape, the two staff members compared checklists and\noutcomes, and they discussed protocol deviations in weekly\nreview meetings with the counselors.\nPlan for implementation setbacks.We kept training minutes,\nmaterials, and the standardized counseling protocol and ped-\nigrees, in the event that new counselors needed to be trained.\nTreatment Fidelity Adherence Step 2: Training\nInterventionists\nSelection of interventionists. The study utilized genetic coun-\nselors, rather than other health care providers, to deliver the\nintervention. Genetic counselors have specific expertise in\nexplaining genetic information to lay populations, and as\npart of this study received theoretical training in behavioral\nchange mechanisms, and extensive experience tailoring can-\ncer screening messages based on known risk and psychoso-\ncial factors.\nStandardized training. Prior to the intervention start date, each\ncounselor received the Family CARE intervention manual,\nwhich outlined specific aspects of EPPM and MI and\nincluded a step-by-step overview of each component of the\ntelephone intervention.\nIn addition, all counselors received 16 hr of in-person MI\ntraining from an experienced MI trainer (S.W.), who trained\nthem as a group to ensure that they all received the same\ninformation. All counselors were provided with a manual\nthat explained the theory and mechanisms of MI, as well as\nexamples of MI practice. MI training incorporated lecture,\nvideo, demonstration, and practice, to effectively accommo-\ndate all learning styles.\nPractice and feedback. The counselors practiced the interven-\ntion on four analogue participants before conducting an\nintervention on actual study participants. Practice partici-\npants included other genetic counselors and individuals who\nagreed to provide feedback. The MI trainer reviewed the\npractice sessions, using the evaluation procedures provided\nbelow, to assure counselor proficiency prior to delivering the\nactual intervention.\nIntervention fidelity. All counselors participated in review ses-\nsions, which assessed compliance with both the theoretical\nmodels and the study protocol. During the review sessions,\nthe MI trainer reviewed a taped TeleCARE session to assess\nfor MI skill proficiency and address potential problems.\nEach session was coded prior to the review, using the Family\nCARE checklist, to assess for adherence to the theoretical\ntenets and key clinical aspects of the intervention. After the\nMI section of the review, adherence to these items was dis-\ncussed and any potential problems concerning adherence or\nthe protocol were addressed.\nTo assure that counselors were proficient in performing\nthe study and to address any problems that arose in the initial\nintervention implementation, review sessions took place\nweeklyforthefirst3monthsoftheintervention.Subsequently,\nreview sessions were held biweekly for approximately 6\nmonths. Toward the end of the intervention, when counselor\nproficiency was high, biweekly meetings were conducted to\nassess adherence to the study protocol, and monthly meet-\nings were conducted to assess MI performance.\nEnhance interventionist involvement. Three of the five counsel-\nors participated in the study design. This helped ensure that\nthe clinician interventionists both understood and endorsed\nthe purpose and methods of the study prior to\nimplementation.\nTreatment Fidelity Adherence Step 3: Treatment\nDelivery\nCreate collaborative relationships with interventionists. As noted\npreviously, genetic counselors played an important role in\nstudy design and implementation. The weekly review ses-\nsions provided the opportunity for them to discuss challeng-\ning situations. These discussions assured early resolution of\nspecific concerns or problems with the intervention.\nUse a scripted curriculum or treatment manual.As Borrelli\n(2011) noted, the use of scripted treatment manuals for inter-\nvention delivery is controversial. A scripted manual helps\nreduce differences between interventionists, but may also con-\nstrain a tailored intervention. Furthermore, the use of a treat-\nment script may be ill suited to MI, which relies heavily on the\ninterventionist/patient discourse to accomplish behavioral\nchange (Miller & Rollnick, 2009). As a scripted intervention\ndid not match the tailoring and MI-style aims of our study, we\nopted instead for the Family CARE manual and a checklist as\nguidelines. The checklist assured that interventionists covered\n6 SAGE Open\nall required theoretical areas, but were allowed some flexi-\nbility in delivery.\nAssess nonspecific effects on an ongoing basis. At the 1-month\nfollow-up survey, participants were asked whether they\nremembered the counseling session and/or printed materials.\nThey also reported on whether they found the information\nuseful, interesting, valuable, understandable, true, personal-\nized, and acceptable. Finally, participants were asked about\ntheir emotional reactions to the intervention. The response\nformat for these items was on a 7-point Likert-type scale\nwhere 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree.\nMinimize differences within treatments and maximize differences\nbetween treatments. Independent coders assessed counselor\nadherence to the Family CARE checklist and provided regu-\nlarly scheduled feedback sessions.\nEnsure adherence to the protocol. We used the Family CARE\nchecklist and two measures of MI--the Motivational Inter-\nviewing Treatment Integrity assessment (MITI; Moyers,\nMartin, Manuel, Hendrickson, & Miller, 2005) and the\nBehavior Change Counseling Index (BECCI; Lane, 2002)--\nto evaluate adherence to the theoretical protocol. Two\nresearchers (W.B. and R.S.) were trained to use the MITI, a\nbehavioral coding system designed to be used as a treatment\nintegrity measure for MI intervention trials. The MITI evalu-\nates global characteristics of the interview (e.g., evocation,\ncollaboration, autonomy-supportiveness), as well as specific\ncounselor behaviors (e.g., giving information, asking ques-\ntions, reflecting, confronting) that are consistent/inconsistent\nwith MI. The advantage of the MITI over simple clinical\nimpression is that the MITI provides objective feedback and\nspecific benchmarks on key aspects of MI. Several interven-\ntion trials have used a similar system for quality control pur-\nposes (Bennett, Roberts, Vaughan, Gibbins, & Rouse, 2007;\nThyrian et al., 2007). Studies tend to find a substantial agree-\nment between patient and observer ratings of MI skill, as\nwell as prediction of improved participant outcomes based\non certain aspects of MITI-related performance. Coders also\nreceived training on the BECCI, a short measure of brief MI\nmeant to be used in clinical health care settings. The BECCI\nconsists of 11 items which are scored in a Likert-type style\nand which provide a total score ranging from 0 to 44 (Lane,\n2002). We used both the MITI and the BECCI to assess\nwhether the two coding methods provided similar informa-\ntion about counselor proficiency.\nWe assessed inter-rater reliability between coders for both\nthe Family CARE checklist and the BECCI using Shrout\u00ad\nFleiss calculations of inter-class correlation coefficients\n(ICCs). This calculation is most appropriate when the same\nraters are assumed to comprise the entire rater population,\nand thus rate all subjects (Shrout & Fleiss, 1979). For the\nBECCI, we established internal consistency reliability esti-\nmates by calculating Cronbach's alpha. Variables used to\nassess proficiency in the MITI included: MI Spirit score\n(average of Evocation, Collaboration, and Autonomy/\nSupport), ratio of complex to simple reflections, ratio of\nopen to closed questions, and ratio of reflections to ques-\ntions. Our assessment of inter-rater agreement for these MITI\nitems used guidelines to create categories of agreement,\nincluding (a) not reaching proficiency, (b) beginning to reach\nproficiency, and (c) meeting competency.\nEstablish minimum competency levels, below which intervention-\nists are given remedial training.If coders noticed consistent\nproblems with an area on the Family CARE checklist, they\nbrought up the item for discussion during intervention review\nmeetings. Reasons for the inclusion of the item (or use of the\nitem in order) were reviewed and strategies for improving\nadherence were discussed. In general, protocol deviations\nwere rare.\nTo establish MI fidelity, we used competency thresholds\nas presented in the MITI manual (Moyers et al., 2010).\nCounselors were expected to meet minimum competency\nratings on the MITI global indicators and percent MI adher-\nent statements. This ensured that the overall tone of the inter-\nvention was consistent with MI. Because of the structured\nnature of the intervention and the inclusion of a substantial\namount of history-taking questions, counselors did not\nalways meet the threshold for behavior counts. In these\ncases, the MI trainer determined counselor proficiency.\nTreatment Fidelity Adherence Step 4: Treatment\nReceipt\nAsk participants whether they received the intervention materials\nand telephone counseling for those randomized to TeleC-\nARE.Participants were asked whether they remembered\nreceiving the counseling session and/or printed materials\n(yes vs. no). They were also asked whether they read the\nprinted materials they received (yes vs. some/no).\nAssess pre-and post-test client knowledge.To determine the\nextent to which participants were familiar with information\nabout CRC, colonoscopy, and screening recommendations,\nwe examined six knowledge-assessment questions in both\nbaseline and follow-up questionnaires. The genetic counsel-\nors specifically covered all six questions during the TeleC-\nARE intervention. These items included the following: (a)\ninformation regarding the severity of CRC in the United\nStates, (b) how family history increases risk of CRC, (c)\ninformation about the effectiveness of early detection of CRC\nin saving lives (two questions), (d) information about the\neffectiveness of colonoscopy, and (e) information about dif-\nferent screening recommendations based on family history.\nCronbach's alpha was not calculated for knowledge, which is\ngenerally reported as an index score rather than as a scale.\nSimmons et al. 7\nAdminister pre-and post-tests of participant decisional uncer-\ntainty. One aim of MI is to reduce participant ambivalence\nabout change. Congruent with this aim, we were interested in\ndetermining whether the intervention reduced participant\ndecisional uncertainty regarding colonoscopy screening.\nDecisional uncertainty measures personal perceptions of (a)\nuncertainty in choosing options; (b) modifiable factors con-\ntributing to uncertainty, such as feeling uninformed, unclear\nabout personal values, or unsupported in decision-making;\nand (c) effective decision-making such as feeling that the\nchoice is informed, values-based, likely to be implemented,\nand expressing satisfaction with personal choice (O'Connor).\nWe assessed this measure at the time of both baseline and\nfollow-up questionnaires. Cronbach's alpha was .77.\nAdminister pre-and post-tests of the Risk Behavior Diagnosis\n(RBD) Scale. The RBD scale measures the components of the\nEPPM model (i.e., perceived susceptibility to threat, per-\nceived severity of threat, perceived self-efficacy, and per-\nceived response efficacy) to determine whether an individual\nis ready for change (i.e., high threat and high efficacy; Witte,\nCameron, McKeon, & Berkowitz, 1996). We were interested\nin determining whether the intervention increased both threat\nand efficacy perceptions. Each subscale was comprised of\nfour items. Cronbach's alphas ranged from .83 to .90.\nEnsure that materials have appropriate health literacy and cul-\ntural relevance.To assure appropriate health literacy in our\nwritten materials, we submitted all brochures, pamphlets,\nand intervention documents to the Huntsman Cancer Insti-\ntute's Cancer Learning Center for readability testing using\nthe Flesch\u00adKincaid scale (Paasche-Orlow, Taylor, & Bran-\ncati, 2003). The readability for all documents was set at a\nseventh-grade level overall, with sections of each document\nset at no higher than an eighth-grade level. We presented\nnumerical information, so that it would be easy for study par-\nticipants to comprehend. Our study also attempted to address\ncultural relevance by incorporating photos of rural individu-\nals (as our study area had large rural populations), and those\nwith different ages, ethnicities, and racial backgrounds. Use\nof MI as a counseling technique helped assure respectful\nconsideration of cultural attitudes and beliefs.\nUse multiple formats for information delivery (verbal, pictures,\nwritten). The PRINT group received an illustrated brochure\nthat outlined the increased risk for family members of CRC\npatients, provided age recommendations for colonoscopy,\ngave information on how to obtain a colonoscopy, and pro-\nvided prevention guidelines. The TeleCARE group received\na packet of printed visual aids that were used in tandem with\nthe telephonic counseling session. These materials included\nthe following: (a) a picture of the participant's family tree\n(diagramming the history of CRC), (b) a graph showing the\ndifference between an average person's risk and the risk of\nsomeone with a similar family history of CRC, (c) a table\noutlining the stages of CRC diagnoses and their survival\nrates, and (d) a step-by-step list of how to obtain a colonos-\ncopy. During the counseling session, the genetic counselor\nreferred to each of these items and explained them in the\ncontext of the intervention.\nAssure that clients understood the material covered in interven-\ntion. After reviewing each printed document in the interven-\ntion packet, genetic counselors ascertained whether the\nparticipant understood the material covered. To ensure client\nparticipation and clarity, the counselors used MI techniques,\nwhich allowed them to integrate open questions such as\n\"What questions do you have about this information?\" into\neach session.Asking whether the participant had any remain-\ning questions was a final step on the Family CARE\nchecklist.\nPlan for action.The fourth and final document of the inter-\nvention packet requested that participants identify what date\nthey would begin the first step of obtaining a colonoscopy. In\naccordance with the Family CARE checklist, counselors\nhelped participants to brainstorm about the first step(s) to\nobtain a colonoscopy and (if appropriate) to set a specific\ndate for that first step (e.g., \"within the next month\" or \"after\nmy daughter's wedding in July\").\nAssess participant confidence in applying the intervention.Dur-\ning the telephone session, counselors asked participants to\nrate their confidence about being able to obtain a colonos-\nabsolute certainty). After the participant provided a rating,\ncounselors elicited the participant's reasons for the selected\nconfidence score (e.g., \"Ok, so you rated it as a 2 out of 10.\nWhat are some reasons that you rated it as a 2 rather than a\n1?\"). This concept aligned with the MI principle of promot-\ning change talk.\nContact for follow-up.Immediately after the telephone ses-\nsion, participants were mailed a tailored letter that included a\nsummary of the discussion and reiterated the participant's\nrisk of CRC, benefits of colonoscopy, and personalized\naction plan, including the planned start date. This letter also\nprovided the study's toll-free number, in the event that the\nparticipant needed more information on how to enact the\nsteps to obtaining a colonoscopy.\nStatistical Analysis\nAll analyses were conducted using SAS 9.2 (SAS, Cary,\nNorth Carolina). To adjust for the randomized cluster design\nof the study, random family effect was included in each ana-\nlytic model. Two-sided p values .05 were considered\nsignificant.\nChange in knowledge scores.We were interested in whether\nparticipant knowledge improved in the intervention arm\nfrom baseline to the 1-month follow-up questionnaire. We\n8 SAGE Open\nexamined the effect of the intervention on knowledge using\nANCOVA, adjusting for the participant's knowledge at\nbaseline.\nChange in decisional uncertainty.\nWe were interested in\nwhether levels of decisional uncertainty were reduced from\nthe baseline to the 1-month follow-up questionnaire, and\nwhether there was a greater improvement in the TeleCARE\ngroup, compared with the low-intensity PRINT group. We\nestimated the effect of the intervention on decisional uncer-\ntainty with the same methods as we used to assess change in\nknowledge.\nChange in RBD scale. We examined change in the four RBD\nmeasures from baseline to 1-month follow-up between the\ntwo intervention conditions. We conducted separate ANCO-\nVAs for each RBD measure to model the change in subscale\nscores.\nResults\nAs shown in Table 1, the two intervention groups did not dif-\nfer by baseline sociodemographic or clinical characteristics.\nTreatment delivery\nFamily CARE checklist. A total of 103 (47%) of the TeleCARE\nsessions were assessed for fidelity according to the Family\nCARE checklist. Of the sessions, the majority (98.7%) were\nfully compliant with the checklist. Of the sessions that did\ncompliance.\nThirty Family CARE checklists were double coded to\nassess for inter-rater reliability. The ICC was .93, indicating\nexcellent inter-rater reliability. The two coders demonstrated\nlargest discrepancy between coders for one session was 5\npoints.\nMI.Two coders (R.S. and W.B.) reviewed 24 of the same\ntapes for the five counselors. Table 2 provides an overview\nof MI outcomes according to categories created by. The two\ncoders agreed that counselors demonstrated proficiency in\nMI Spirit, but modest proficiency in the other three areas of\nMI. The structured nature of the MI sessions may account for\nthese areas of modest proficiency ratings.\nBECCI. Two coders scored the BECCI for 30 telephone coun-\nseling sessions. The average BECCI score was 40.5 (SD =\nassessment of MI. The ICC value for the BECCI was .47,\nwhich indicates fair inter-rater reliability. It should be noted\nthat the highly structured nature of the intervention truncated\nthe variation in BECCI scores, resulting in a lowered ICC;\nthis was not necessarily due to low inter-rater agreement. To\naddress this concern, we used additional indicators of the\nrater's level of agreement to determine whether the review-\ners came to the same clinical conclusion about counselor MI\ncompetence. When considering wider ranges of BECCI\nscores as indications of MI competence, the two reviewers\nagreed that all counselors demonstrated excellent MI skills\nof the time.\nTreatment receipt.Table 3 shows descriptive statistics and\nANCOVA results for all measures of treatment receipt,\nincluding changes in knowledge scores, RBD subscale\nscores, and decisional uncertainty scale scores from baseline\nto the 1-month post-intervention assessment.\nOn average, knowledge scores increased in both interven-\ntion groups; however, the TeleCARE group had a signifi-\ncantly greater increase in knowledge. The vast majority of\nparticipants perceived CRC as serious at baseline, and per-\nceptions about severity were unchanged in 67% of respon-\ndents (f = 0.35, p = .56). Perceived susceptibility was virtually\nunchanged in the PRINT group, but the TeleCARE group\nhad significantly higher scores following the intervention\nboth intervention groups, but the TeleCARE group had a sig-\nscores also increased in both groups, but again, theTeleCARE\ngroup demonstrated a significantly greater increase com-\nuncertainty change scores decreased in both intervention\ngroups; however, the TeleCARE group showed a signifi-\ncantly greater decrease in uncertainty regarding the decision\nDiscussion\nIn general, steps to assure treatment fidelity in the Family\nCARE trial remained consistent with the recommendations\net al., 2005). In our study, best-practice recommendations\nwere adhered to with regard to study design and training of\ninterventionists. Assessment of treatment delivery indicated\nthat counselors were adherent to the TeleCARE interven-\ntion's theoretical tenets.\nAssessment of counselor proficiency in MI demonstrated\na more complex picture of the intervention delivery. Coders\nratings suggested that the genetic counselors demonstrated\nhigh levels of MI Spirit (22/24 tapes indicated that counsel-\nors met competency), yet they also suggested that specific\nmeasures of MI utterances (open questions, complex reflec-\ntions, reflection-to-question ratios) demonstrated modest\nproficiency. This seeming difference in proficiency may be\ndue to the fact that MI was incorporated into the intervention\nmore as a style of delivery and less as a specific counseling\ntool. Traditional MI encourages clinicians to ask questions\nSimmons et al. 9\nTable 1.

Categories with three or more relatives were grouped together due to low counts.\nbRural/urban residence was based on Rural\u00adUrban Computing Area (RUCA) codes at the zip code level. RUCA codes were developed by the University of Washington\nRural Health Research Center and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Economic Research Service (ERS), with the support of the federal Health Resource\nand Service Administration's Office of Rural Health Policy and the ERS, using standard Census Bureau urbanized area and urban cluster definitions in combination with work\ncommuting data to characterize census tracts and zip codes. The 10 RUCA categories were aggregated into urban (1-3) and rural (4-10) as recommended by the Washington,\nWyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho (WWAMI) Rural Health Research Center.

Categories with three or more relatives were grouped together\ndue to low counts.\ncEmployment status was dichotomized as employed (employed for wages, self-employed) and not employed (out of work <1 year, out of >1 year, retired, homemaker, student,\nunable to work or other).\ndPrivate was defined as primary health care coverage that is provided through a current or former employer or union, health insurance plan that you purchase directly from\nan insurance company, health plan of someone who does not live in the household, and coverage through another source not mentioned. Public was defined as Medicare,\nMedicaid, or another government plan.\nthat can lead to deeper discussion and reflection on the issue\nat hand; whereas in the current intervention, genetic counsel-\nors were constrained by the requirement to address the theo-\nretical tenets of the intervention, which required them to\nprovide a psycho-educational approach. This may have\ninhibited proficiency counts based on utterance scores.\nPrevious studies (Miller & Rollnick, 2009) have demon-\nstrated that for studies that incorporate MI into structured,\nmulti-theoretical models, the use of traditional utterance\ncounts to examine counselor proficiency may not represent\nthe best method of assessment. For the more global MI\nassessment scores (MI Spirit and the BECCI), coders agreed\nthat counselors were proficient in MI. These findings indi-\ncate that future studies which incorporate MI into interven-\ntion structures may find that global ratings of MI are better\nindicators of counselor proficiency; or, conversely, that a\nmore detailed assessment such as the Motivational\nInterviewing Skill Code, which assesses interventionist/ par-\nticipant interactions rather than interventionist utterances,\nmight provide better information about the level of MI\nproficiency in such studies (Madson & Campbell, 2006;\nRecommendations for assessing treatment fidelity include\nadministering pre-and post-tests of knowledge as part of\ntreatment receipt assessment (Borrelli, 2011). However, as\nprior research has demonstrated that increases in knowledge\nalone do not appreciably affect CRC screening behavior\n(Manne et al., 2002), we included additional measures of\ntreatment receipt that aligned with our study's aims and theo-\nretical rationale. All of these measures (e.g., decisional con-\nflict, RBD subscale scores), with the exception of perceived\nseverity, were found to significantly improve at the 1-month\nfollow-up. These findings indicate that our TeleCARE inter-\nvention was successful in addressing the theoretical targets.\nFuture plans include assessing whether these theoretical tar-\ngets mediated the effect of the intervention on colonoscopy\nuptake. Other cancer screening studies have also shown little\nvariation in perceived severity. This is likely due to a ceiling\neffect, wherein individuals already perceive cancer as a seri-\nous disease and, consequently, scores do not change much\nover time.\nOur study has several limitations. The low number of par-\nticipants representing ethnic and racial minorities limits the\ngeneralizability of our study's findings. We did not include\nthe treatment fidelity area of \"treatment enactment\" as sug-\ngested in the recommendations for best practices for treat-\nenactment is a method of assessing whether the skills a par-\nticipant acquires from an intervention are appropriately\nimplemented, so as to assure intended study outcomes\n(Borrelli, 2011). The difference between enactment and out-\ncomes is the measurement of enactment throughout the\ncourse of the study, instead of at the end of the follow-up\nperiod. In certain study designs, such as behavioral interven-\ntion trials designed to motivate cancer screening or single-\nevent decision behaviors, it may not be practical to assess for\nimplementation of self-regulatory skills, as these skills may\nnot be measurable. In our study, the primary outcome was\ncolonoscopy uptake by 9 months after the intervention; skills\nneeded to carry out this task are difficult to measure sepa-\nrately from the event itself. For example, steps to obtain a\ncolonoscopy include the following: (a) contacting a primary\ncare physician for a colonoscopy referral, (b) making an\nappointment with the colonoscopy center, (c) obtaining a\nprescription for and ingesting the preparation the night\nbefore, and (d) finding someone to take the participant to and\nfrom his or her appointment. Most of these steps are proce-\ndural and do not require a particular skill set. In our case,\nenactment essentially overlaps with outcome. Therefore, this\nmeasure of fidelity may be design-dependent and not always\nmeasurable. Future studies that assess treatment fidelity may\nneed to determine whether treatment enactment is possible\nprior to study implementation. Studies that examine adher-\nence to treatment fidelity may also be advised to take study\nTable 2.

The Family CARE study adhered to most of the\nbest-practice guidelines outlined previously, demonstrating\nthat our intervention was delivered as intended and posi-\ntively affected the cognitive processes that are thought to\npredict desired behavioral outcomes. Given the complex\nnature of behavioral interventions, we recommend the poten-\ntial use of multiple treatment receipt assessments, to assure\nthat cognitive intervention targets are assessed. Finally, we\nrecommend that future treatment fidelity assessments con-\nsider the appropriateness of including treatment enactment\nas a required component of the treatment fidelity checklist,\nas it may not substantially differ from study outcomes in\nresearch areas, such as cancer\nAuthors' Note\nThis content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not\nnecessarily reflect the opinions or views of the funding and support-\ning agencies.\n"
