Results: Substantial geographic variation exists in\nrates of current cigarette use among adults within the\nUnited States. In general, adults in the southern United\nStates have higher rates of smoking and adults in the\nwestern states have lower rates of smoking than adults in the\nrest of the country, although differences in smoking be-\nhavior between men and women and among various racial\nand ethnic populations strongly influence these patterns.\nOnly two states, Kentucky and West Virginia, exhibited\nadult smoking rates (men and women combined) of 30% or\nreported from 20 states.

To address\nthis problem, in October 1991 the National Cancer Institute\n(NCI), in conjunction with the American Cancer Society (ACS),\nbegan the largest tobacco prevention and control project ever\nundertaken in the United States. Called the American Stop\nSmoking Intervention Study for Cancer Prevention--ASSIST--\nit represents the first federally funded program whose specific\naim is to establish a long-term public health infrastructure for\ntobacco control at the state level (4). After a year-long national\ncompetition involving 37 states, 17 state health departments\nwere awarded ASSIST contracts. These 17 states' have a com-\nbined population of 91 million people; 23 million are children\nunder the age of 20 (approximately 2.0 million of whom are\nsmokers), 10 million are African-American, and 7 million are\neither Hispanic or another ethnic minority. Nearly 19 million are\nadults who report regular tobacco use (4).\nASSIST also represents a national-state partnership, since it\ninvolves not only the NCI, the ACS, and health departments in\n17 states, but also thousands of institutions, agencies, and in-\ndividuals who have joined state and local tobacco control coali-\ntions (5). The goal of the project is to reduce smoking\nprevalence among adults in ASSIST states to no more than 17%\ngoals is estimated to result in 4.5 million adults quitting smok-\ning and preventing 2 million children from ever taking up the\nhabit.

The three main sources were\nhouseholds listed in the most recent decennial census (for the 1992-1993 survey,\nthe 1980 census base was still used), updated building permits, and area sam-\nsample was drawn from 729 primary sampling units comprising 1973 counties\nand independent cities with coverage in every state and the District of Columbia.\nApproximately 59 000 housing units or living quarters are assigned for inter-\nare interviewed each month. All strata are defined within state boundaries, and\nthe sample is allocated among the states to produce state, census region and\ndivision, and national labor force estimates, keeping the total sample size to a\nminimum. Also included are demographic data for approximately 33 000\nchildren 0-14 years old and 550 Armed Forces members living with civilians\neither on or off base within households.\nInterviews\nInterviews are conducted with a knowledgeable household respondent, who\ngenerally responds for all household members 15 years old or older. Slightly\nmore than half of all of those interviewed are typically self-respondents, and the\never, an attempt was made to minimize the proportion of proxy responses be-\ncause answers to some questions of interest to the NCI would be known only by\nthe person to be interviewed.

Approximately\n25% of all interviews were conducted in person and 75% by telephone.\nFor all non-English-speaking respondents, interviews were conducted by\nforeign language interviewers from a regional office of the Bureau of the Cen-\nsus; if a foreign language interviewer was not available, a person from a nearby\nuniversity or another household member was recruited. For Spanish language in-\nterviews, a fully translated Tobacco Use Supplement was utilized. Data\npresented by race and ethnic origin were based on standard Bureau of the Census\nclassifications. Where estimates were presented for whites and blacks, they were\nnon-Hispanic.\nBoth proxy and self-reported responses were used for producing smoking\nprevalence estimates summarized in this analysis. Information on adult current\ncigarette use obtained from proxies has been shown to closely agree with that\nobtained through self-reports in both surveys and clinical trials (11-14). Supple-\nment weights for nonresponse were developed according to a special algorithm\nby the Bureau of the Census.\nDefinitions Used to Determine Smoking Status\nment were based on the newly developed series of questions adopted for use on\nthe National Health Interview Survey (15). All respondents were asked if they\nhad ever smoked 100 cigarettes in their entire life. Those responding \"no\" were\nconsidered never smokers; those responding \"yes\" were asked if they currently\nsmoked cigarettes every day, some days, or not at all. Respondents answering\neither \"every day\" or \"some days\" were classified as current smokers; those\nresponding \"not at all\" were considered former smokers.\nCurrent smoker status in the 1985 CPS was based on slightly different criteria\nCPS were asked if they had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their entire life;\nthose responding \"no\" were classified as never smokers. However, those in-\ndividuals who responded \"yes\" were asked only, \"Do you smoke cigarettes\nnow?\" Those responding in the affirmative were considered to be current\nsmokers, whereas those responding \"no\" were considered to be former smokers.\nthose individuals responding \"don't know\" to either the 100-cigarettes question\nor to the question \"do you smoke now''\" (a choice only in 1985).

As might be expected, rates of divisions\ntended to parallel regional rates. The East South Central\nDivision--which includes Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and\nMississippi--had the highest reported smoking rate for males\n(32.7%), followed by the East North Central Division (28.8%),\nthe South Atlantic Division (28.5%), and the West South\nCentra] Division (28.2%).

Although rates for females paralleled those\nfor males in the East North Central Division and in the East\nSouth Central Division (male and female rates in each division\nbeing high), the male-female patterns observed for the South\nAtlantic Division and the West South Central Division were less\ncongruent. In the latter case, the rates for males were high, but\nthe rates reported for females were lower, similar to those in the\nNew England Division and the Mountain Division.\nMoreover, the rates revealed a trend toward less difference\nbetween males and females in regions, divisions, and states\nwhere smoking rates were comparatively lower. For example,\nwith a few exceptions, the smoking rates for females were only\n1 or 2 percentage points lower than those for males for most\nstates in the Northeast and West, whereas the smoking rates for\nfemales in the Midwest and South were 5-9 percentage points\nlower than those for males.\nBy and large, smoking rates for men and women followed\nsimilar patterns by state (Table 1). A major difference was noted\nfor North Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi, where the rates\nwere comparatively higher for males but substantially lower for\nfemales, compared with rates for females elsewhere. But in two\nstates, Rhode Island and Montana, smoking rates were higher\namong women than among men; these are the only states where\nthis phenomenon was observed. Of interest, the smoking rates\nfor males and females residing in Utah remained the lowest in\nthe nation (20.5% and 13.8%, respectively). Similarly, the rates\namong adult women in California were just a few percentage\npoints higher (16.2%) than those among adult women in Utah.\nDifferences by Race/Ethnicity\nTable 2 shows smoking patterns by race/ethnicity and sex for\nwhites, African-Americans, Hispanics, Asian/Pacific Islanders\n(Asian/PI), and other races. Prevalence rates among both men\nand women and at virtually all geographic levels were highest\namong other races. But given the undefined nature of this\ncategory and the relatively smaller sample, the remaining dis-\ncussion will focus only on the four major racial/ethnic groups. It\nis also important to note that the census does not weight or ad-\njust Asian/PI as a group separate from others (see Table 2).\nNationally, among males, the highest rates were reported by\nsmoking rates between white and Hispanic males, whether\nmeasured nationally, regionally, or within the nine census\ndivisions, were quite small, usually varying by no more than\nl%-2%; the notable exception occurred in the West North\nCentral Division.\nAmong males, there was a variation in rates by region; e.g.,\nthe highest prevalence rates for whites were found in the South,\nwhile the highest prevalence rates for African-Americans and\nHispanics were in the Midwest and those for Asian/PI were in\nthe West. The lowest rates for white and African-American\nmales were in the Northeast, while the lowest rates for\nHispanics were in the West. Among Asian/PI, there was no dif-\nference between the Northeast, Midwest, and South; rates of ap-\nproximately 19% have been reported from all of these regions.\nWhite and African-American females nationally experienced\nsimilar smoking rates (22.9% and 22.5%, respectively), whereas\nsmoking among Hispanic women (12.7%) and women classified\nas Asian/PI (8.0%) was significantly less (P<.0001). Asian/PI\nwomen experienced the lowest smoking rates of all the major\ndemographic groups in the United States. Regionally, the pat-\ntern for women was identical to that seen among men; i.e., the\nhighest smoking rates were in the South (24.3%) for whites, in\nthe Midwest for both African-Americans and Hispanics (26.5%\nand 16.1%, respectively), and in the West for Asian/PI (8.8%).\nThe greatest male-female differences nationally within race/\nethnicity were found among Asian/PI (14.8-percentage-point\ndifference), followed by Hispanics (12.3-percentage-point dif-\nference), African-Americans (8.8-percentage-point difference),\nand whites (3.5-percentage-point difference). For all races, the\ngreatest male-female difference by region was observed in the\nSouth, except for Asian/PI, for whom the largest differences\nwere seen in the Midwest and West. Generally, however,\nsmaller differences between men and women, within race, oc-\ncurred in the West and Northeast.\nDifferences by Age, Sex, and Region\nTable 3 reports smoking rates for males and females by 10-\nyear age groups, by census region, and by division. With only a\nfew exceptions, smoking prevalence was highest through ages\n30-39 years for both men and women, then declined with in-\ncreasing age. Men experienced higher smoking prevalence than\nwomen at practically every age and geographic level, with the\nsingle exception of 60- to 69-year-old women in the New\nEngland Division. Male-female differences by age were\ngreatest in the South, where a consistent 5- to 7-percentage-\npoint difference existed between the sexes for nearly every age,\nexcept those in the very oldest age category, where the rates nar-\nrowed considerably; a similar pattern was observed for each of\nthe three southern divisions as well. Smaller differences in\nprevalence were noted between men and women in the youngest\nage group (ages 20-29 years) in the Northeast Region and the\nTable 2.

Among both males and females, the highest rates\nof smoking for each of the three major occupational groups oc-\ncurred in the Midwest and the South. The rate of smoking\namong blue-collar and service workers was significantly higher\n(P^.0001) than that of their white-collar peers. This finding was\ntrue for both men and women and was consistent across all\ngeographic levels.\nNationally, it is interesting to note that female white-collar\nworkers reported slightly higher smoking prevalence rates than\nmale white-collar workers (20.8% versus 19.8%, respectively).\nCompared with male white-collar workers, female white-collar\nworkers had higher rates of smoking in virtually every geographic\npart of the country (i.e., three out of four regions and every\ndivision, except the Pacific). Female blue-collar workers living in\nthe West and, to a somewhat lesser extent, female service workers\nliving in the same region reported lower smoking rates than their\ncounterparts in the other regions of the country (Table 4).\nRates of 40% or greater were observed among male blue-col-\nlar workers in the South (including two of three southern\ndivisions) and among male service workers in the West North\nCentra] Division in the Midwest. The highest rate among\nfemales was observed among blue-collar workers in the Mid-\nwest Region, where the rate was 38.8%--a rate identical to that\nreported for male blue-collar workers in the region.\nAmong females residing in the West, an interesting pattern\nwas seen in the smoking rates among the occupational groups\nbetween the Mountain Division and the Pacific Division, where\nrates were lower in the latter compared with the former. This\npattern was especially pronounced among women working in\nblue-collar and service jobs. For example, female blue-collar\nworkers in the Pacific Division reported a prevalence rate of\nblue-collar workers in the Mountain Division.\nState Ranking by Sex\nSex-specific smoking prevalence rankings, both high and\nlow, by state are presented in Table 5.

Prevalence declined the\nmost in the Northeast (-20.5%) and the West (-19.1%) and the\nleast in the Midwest (-12.9%), followed by the South (-16.1%).\nDiscussion\nConsideration of potential limitations in survey methodology\nthat may affect interpretation of results are in order. Although\nthere was a change in the definition of current smoker between\nthe two Current  s, the impact of this change\non any real difference in smoking prevalence should be mini-\nmal. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion in analyzing their own survey results, just a 0.9% difference\nin prevalence could be attributed to the new definition based on\ntheir analysis of 1992 data from the National Health Interview\nSurvey (75). The percentage of proxy responses obtained on the\ntained in 1985 (45%). As noted earlier, however, other studies\n(77-74) have shown that proxy responses for estimating adult\nsmoking behavior correspond well with self-responses. A\nstrength of the CPS comparisons over time comes from other\naspects of the design and interview methodology that were con-\nstant for both surveys.\nOther variations in methodology, such as personal versus\ntelephone interview, and potential biases of nonresponse to the\nsupplement within a given survey should also be minimal.

In general, the\nSouth and Midwest experienced higher rates of smoking\nprevalence than the rest of the country, and the West ex-\nperienced the lowest, although differences in smoking behavior\nbetween men and women and among various ethnic and racial\ngroups within regions strongly influence these patterns. There\nwas also considerable variability in smoking among the major\nracial and ethnic groups of the population nationally, with the\nhighest rates recorded among African-American males (31.3%)\nand the lowest among Asian/PI females (8.0%).\nTable 6.

In the\ncurrent analysis, smoking rates declined after ages 30-39 years.\nSmoking rates for women working in white-collar oc-\ncupations now exceed those of their white-collar male\ncounterparts. This is the first time such a crossover has\nbeen reported and may indicate the generally lower rates of\ncessation observed in women than in men. Smoking among\nmale white-collar workers decreased nearly 25% since\nworkers. As noted earlier, female white-collar workers in 1992-\n1993 experienced higher rates of smoking than male white-col-\nlar workers in virtually every part of the United States. Declines\nin smoking among male service workers and blue-collar\nworkers since 1985 were not as steep as those observed among\ntheir white-collar peers. Nevertheless, smoking rates declined\n16% among male service workers and 12% among male blue-\ncollar workers during this period. Smoking rates among female\nservice and blue-collar workers each declined 11% since 1985.\nMany of the states that ranked high in smoking prevalence in\nthe 1985 CPS also ranked high in the latest analysis, and this\nwas true for both men and women. There are, however, several\nnotable exceptions. For example, Alaskan males had the highest\n28.4% were smoking--a 33% decline--nearly double the rate\nof decline seen in males nationally. Smoking declined among\nAlaskan females as well, but the rate of decline in women was\nconsiderably lower than that in Alaskan men. The reasons for\nthis sharp decline among men but not among women are un-\nclear, but they could be related to changes in the state's\ndemographic makeup between the two study periods.\nUtah continues to experience the lowest overall smoking\nprevalence rate of any state in the nation, a position it also held\nin 1985. While prevalence increased in Utah between the two\nstudy periods, the difference was not statistically significant (P\nterval around the increase included no change. Smoking in\nseveral states (Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri,\nMontana, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee,\nand West Virginia) can also be characterized as relatively un-\nchanged.\nRhode Island experienced the greatest relative decline in\nnoting for their decline in smoking prevalence include Delaware\nwas already reporting relatively low rates for men and women in\n1985, has improved its position in the latest survey. California\nranked ninth lowest in prevalence among men and fifth lowest\namong women in the 1985 study; it is now the fifth and second\nlowest among men and women, respectively, and the second\nlowest overall. The decline in smoking among California adults\nis attributed, to a large extent, to the aggressive statewide smok-\ning control actions implemented there in 1989 following a $.25-\nper-pack increase in the state excise tax {17). However, other\nfactors may have contributed to the decline, including an in-\ncrease in populations whose smoking histories have been tradi-\ntionally much lower than those of other demographic groups\n(e.g., Asian and Hispanic females).\nRegardless, California and Utah are the only states where\nsmoking is under 20% among adults. Several other states, in-\nHawaii, Nebraska, and New York (each 22.0%), are reporting\nrates in the low 20's percentiles and should soon be below 20%\nif current trends continue. Massachusetts may be particularly\nwell positioned to reach this goal. Like California, Mas-\nsachusetts increased its cigarette excise tax by $.25 a pack in\nJanuary 1993, and a substantial portion of the revenues was\ndedicated to a statewide tobacco-use reduction initiative. A\nsharp drop in cigarette sales (-12.5%) was recorded in Mas-\ndecline nationally {18).\nFinally, as smoking control is increasingly seen as a com-\nmunity health priority, it will become increasingly important to\nhave a surveillance mechanism in place that is capable of sys-\ntematically monitoring changes in tobacco use at the state and\nlocal levels (5,7). In addition to NCI's 17-state ASSIST demon-\nstration project, in 1993 the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention initiated its own program--IMPACT (Initiatives to\nMobilize for the Prevention and Control of Tobacco Use)--for\nstates not receiving funding under ASSIST (6). While the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention provide funding to\nmore states (32 states and the District of Columbia), annual\nfunding under IMPACT is more modest, averaging about $150 000\nper state, compared with ASSIST's approximately $1 million\nper state. Both programs, however, share many common charac-\nteristics, including an emphasis on policy-based interventions to\nreduce smoking among both adults and children. More recently,\nthe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation announced formation of\nits own program--called Smokeless States--which provides ad-\nditional fiscal support to 19 states. This program, however, does\nnot support comprehensive statewide programs for all states\nreceiving funding.\nThe CPS, with its comprehensive sampling scheme (more than\nterviews per month), is ideally suited to accurately monitor state\ntobacco use trends as well as trends in other areas. For example,\nthe Tobacco Use Supplement collects data on cessation counsel-\ning by physicians and dentists; on the existence of workplace\nsmoking policies and the characteristics of those policies (19);\non public attitudes toward smoking restrictions in various public\nsettings, such as restaurants, indoor worksites, and indoor shop-\nping malls (19); and on public opinion about smoking control\npolicies, such as the ease with which minors can buy tobacco in\ntheir communities.\nMany of the questions contained on the NCI Tobacco Use\nSupplement represent areas for which state health departments\nare increasingly taking responsibility or represent areas that\nstates may be required to monitor under various federal require-\nthe Synar Amendment) and the more recently proposed Food\nand Drug Administration regulations are specifically intended to\nreduce smoking rates among youth by reducing illegal sales of\ncigarettes and tobacco products to minors (20, 21). The supple-\nment can help monitor trends related to many of these issues.\nFurthermore, the CPS collects information on tobacco use\namong all household members 15 years of age and older; thus,\nthe CPS can help monitor, at least on a national-regional basis,\nThe Tobacco Use Supplement was specifically designed by\nthe NCI to provide prevalence and other information for its 17-\nstate ASSIST demonstration project, but because the CPS in-\ncludes information on all states in its sampling scheme, not just\nthose involved in ASSIST, data are available for each of the 50\nstates and the District of Columbia. Furthermore, beginning in\n1995, the Bureau of the Census increased the number of primary\nsampling units in its sampling scheme to 818 (by way of com-\nparison, the National Health Interview Survey in 1994 increased\nthe number of primary sampling units used in its sampling\nscheme from 201 to 400); thus, both coverage and reliability of\nstate estimates collected via the CPS should be enhanced even\nfurther.\nReferences\n(/) Doll R, Peto R.
