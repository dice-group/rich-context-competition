Morbidity\nfrom chronic respiratory disease includes not only\nhospitalizations and emergency department visits,\nbut also restricted activity and functional limitations\nBoth diagnosed and undiagnosed obstructive lung\ndisease are known to be associated with increased\nfunctional limitation [3]. In a recently published\nanalysis of data from the Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), Coul-\ntas et al. found that undiagnosed airflow obstruction\nwas associated with impaired health and functional\nstatus. However, that analysis did not look at indi-\nviduals with restrictive lung disease or respiratory\nsymptoms, and these subjects were included in the\nreferent group that did not have obstructive lung\ndisease. Restrictive lung disease can have a variety\nof aetiologies, including diseases such as muscular\nweakness, congestive heart failure, interstitial lung\ndisease, diabetes mellitus and obesity, all of which\ncan also be associated with increased limitation and\nmorbidity [4\u00ad8]. In addition, respiratory symptoms\nsuch as chronic cough or sputum production may\nhave their own significant morbidities [9, 10].\nSpirometric criteria were applied to define\nobstructive and restrictive lung disease in adults\nwho had pulmonary function measurements\nobtained as part of phase 2 of NHANES III. In\naddition, a group of subjects who reported respirat-\nory symptoms in the absence of lung function\nimpairment were assessed. Then the relationship\nbetween impaired lung function and respiratory\nsymptoms with reported functional limitations and\nself-reported health status, controlling for potential\ncovariates that may also influence these measures,\nwas assessed.\nMethods\nStudy population\nThe NHANES III was conducted in two nationally\nNational Center for Health Statistics of the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA\n[11]. In this study a stratified multistage clustered\nprobability design was used to select a representative\nsample of the US population, yielding results which\ncan be extrapolated to the noninstitutionalized\ncivilian US population. Study participants completed\nextensive questionnaires in the household and a\ncomprehensive physical examination, including pul-\nmonary function testing, either in the household or\nat a specially equipped mobile examination centre.\nThe study was approved by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics' Institutional Review Board.\nSubjects and demographics\nThe study sample was limited to adults aged\n17 years and older who participated in phase 2 of\nfunction testing performed in either the household\nor the mobile examination centre, and had complete\ndata on their race, smoking status, body mass index,\nfunctional status and presence of respiratory symp-\ntoms. Functional status was not available for all\nadults in phase 1 of NHANES III, so the analysis was\nlimited to phase 2 participants. Of the 9930 adult\nsurvey participants in phase 2 of NHANES III, 802\ndid not undergo medical examination, 687 did not\nundergo pulmonary function testing, 155 were\npregnant, 659 were missing data on function\nlimitations and 124 were missing data on other\nvariables. After the exclusions, data from 7503\n(75.6%) subjects were available for the main ana-\nlysis.\nVariable definition\nThe race of the participants was classified as `White',\n`African-American', `Mexican-American' or `Other'\nand was determined by self-report on the question-\nnaire. Other demographic covariates included sex,\nsubjects were stratified into four age strata: 17\u00ad44,\nmass index was calculated by dividing the weight in\nkilograms by the square of the height in metres and\nthe following classifications were used: <18.5,\nwere defined as being current smokers, former\nsmokers, pipe or cigar smokers, or never smokers,\nbased on their responses to series of questions.\nCurrent pipe or cigar smokers were considered\n`current smokers'. One had to have smoked at least\ntobacco to qualify as a former or current smoker.\nThe subjects were classified as having a respirat-\nory symptom when they gave a positive response to\nany one of the following questions involving specific\nsymptoms (cough, phlegm, wheeze and dyspnoea):\n`Do you usually cough on most days for 3 consecu-\ntive months or more during the year?'; `Do you bring\nup phlegm on most days for 3 consecutive months\nor more during the year?'; `Have you had wheezing\nor whistling in your chest at any time in the past\n12 months?' and `Are you troubled by shortness of\nbreath when hurrying on level ground or walking\nup a slight hill?' The subjects were classified as\nhaving or not having: cardiovascular disease (pos-\nitive response to physician diagnosed myocardial\ninfarction, stroke or congestive heart failure);\ndiabetes mellitus (positive response to physician\ndiagnosis of diabetes mellitus) or arthritis (positive\nresponse to physician diagnosis of osteoarthritis or\nrheumatoid arthritis).\nPulmonary function data\nUsing either a dry rolling seal spirometer in the\nmobile examination centre or a portable spirometer\nin the household examination, spirometry was\nconducted on the examinees. Procedures for testing\nwere based on the 1987 American Thoracic Society\nrecommendations [12]. In order to obtain curves\nacceptable according to the protocol, examinees\nperformed five to eight forced expirations. Subjects\nwere excluded from this analysis if they either did\nnot perform spirometry or had results that were not\nreliable. Values used in this analysis included the\nforced vital capacity (FVC), the forced expiratory\n) and the FEV1\n/FVC ratio. The\npredicted values of FEV1\nand FVC were determined\nusing previously published prediction equations\n[13]. The sex-specific model for white participants\nwas applied to people of `Other' race. The subjects\nwere classifed using a modification of the global\ninitiative for chronic obstructive lung disease\n(GOLD) criteria for COPD into the following mutu-\nally exclusive categories using the FEV1\n, the FVC,\n/FVC ratio, and the presence of respiratory\nsymptoms: severe COPD (FEV1/FVC < 0.70 and\n< 50% predicted), moderate COPD (FEV1\n/\nmild COPD (FEV1\nsymptoms only (presence of respiratory symptoms in\nthe absence of any lung function abnormality),\nrestrictive lung disease (FEV1\nFVC < 80% predicted) and no lung disease [14].\nFunctional limitation and reported health status\nFunctional limitations were determined based on\nself-response to questions asking whether they had\n`no difficulty, some difficulty, much difficulty or are\nunable to do certain activities'. Limitations included\nwalking for a quarter of a mile and lifting or\ncarrying something as heavy as 10 pounds and\nconsidered any reported difficulty as a limitation.\nSubjects were also asked `Because of any impair-\nment or health problem, do you need the help of\nother persons in handling routine needs, such as\neveryday household chores, doing necessary busi-\nness, shopping or getting around for other purpo-\nses?' and a positive response was considered as a\nlimitation. Subjects categorized their general health\nstatus as `excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor'\nand we stratified the responses into fair or poor\nversus good or better.\nAnalysis\nAll estimates were calculated using the sampling\nweight to represent adults aged 17 years and older\nin the US. The purpose of these sampling weights\nwas to adjust for unequal probabilities of selection\nand to account for nonresponse. All percentages\nshown are weighted and age-adjusted to the distri-\nbution of participants in the final analytic sample.\nUnivariate and multivariate logistic regression\nmodels were developed to describe the relationship\nbetween impaired lung function and respiratory\nsymptoms with functional limitation or health\nstatus. Multivariate models adjusted for age, sex,\nrace, smoking status, body mass index and comorbid\nchronic conditions including cardiovascular disease,\nmodels were evaluated for interaction by the cova-\nriates. Both SAS and SUDAAN, a program that\nadjusts for the complex sample design when calcu-\nlating variance estimates [15, 16], were used in this\nanalysis.\nResults\nThe final data set comprised 7503 subjects repre-\nsenting an estimated 165 million adults in the US.\nThe 2427 adults not included in the final analytic\nsample because of missing data were older than the\nThe pulmonary function criteria classified 1.3%\nof subjects as having severe COPD, 5.1% as having\nmoderate COPD, 6.8% as having mild COPD, 6.6%\nas having restrictive lung disease, and 23.4%\nhaving respiratory symptoms in the absence of\nlung function impairment (Table 1). The propor-\ntion of subjects with moderate or severe COPD was\nhigher in older age groups and current or former\nsmokers (Table 1). The proportion of subjects with\nrestrictive lung disease was higher in older age\ngroups and people with diabetes mellitus, but not\nin current or former smokers (Table 1). The\nproportion of subjects with moderate or severe\nCOPD in this analysis (6.4%) was similar to the\nproportion (6.8%) found in a previous analysis of\nthe larger NHANES II phase 1 and 2 data sets [17].\nPrevalence of functional limitations and reported\nfair or poor health status are shown in Table 2. The\nreported prevalence of most of these indicators were\nhigher in older age groups, in the presence of\nchronic comorbid conditions, amongst African-\nAmericans and Mexican-Americans, amongst\nwomen and amongst current smokers.\nIn univariate models, all strata of impaired lung\nfunction or respiratory symptoms were associated\nwith a higher odds ratio (OR) of functional limitation,\nor fair or poor health status (Table 3). Significant\ninteractions between measures of lung function\nimpairment and other covariates were not detected.\nTable 1 Participants stratified by age, race, sex, education level, smoking status, body mass index, cardiovascular disease, diabetes\nmellitus, and arthritis and the age-adjusted, weighted proportion (standard error in parenthesis) within each subgroup with each class of\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or restrictive lung disease.

Whilst severe COPD had the\nhighest OR of limitations, moderate COPD, restrict-\nive lung disease and respiratory symptoms in the\nabsence of impaired lung function were all associ-\nated with a higher OR of functional limitations and a\nfair or poor health status to a similar extent.\nThe prior analysis of this database restricted the\nanalysis to white participants 45-years old and\nfocused only on obstructive lung disease as the\noutcome of interest [3]. In that analysis the\ncomparison group of `normal' subjects included\npeople with both restrictive lung disease and respir-\natory symptoms, which could have resulted in\nunderestimating the effect of COPD on functional\nlimitations or health status. For example, in the\nprior analysis the multivariate regression model for\nfair or poor health status amongst subjects with\nStage II or III COPD (roughly corresponding to\nsevere COPD category of the present study) yielded\nwhereas the present analysis yielded an OR of 5.3\nother end-points [3]. Similarly, none of the models in\nthe prior analysis amongst subjects with Stage 1b\nCOPD (roughly corresponding to moderate COPD\ncategory of the present study) were associated with\nan increased risk of limitations, whereas all the\npresent models, with the exception of `Needs help\nwith daily activities' were.\nThe finding that restrictive lung disease is asso-\nciated with a higher OR of functional limitations and\nfair or poor health status is expected. Restriction on\nspirometry can be related to a variety of aetiologies,\nincluding interstitial lung disease, obesity, muscular\nweakness and small airways disease [4, 18, 19]. The\nprecise determination of restriction requires the\nmeasurement of total lung capacity [20] although\nothers have shown that most patients with restric-\ntion on spirometry have this confirmed when the\ntotal lung capacity is measured [21]. In addition, it\nis possible that subjects with `normal' lung function\nwho did not complete the test were included in the\n`restrictive' category. This bias could have the\npotential to underestimate functional limitation\namongst subjects with restrictive disease [22].\nA surprising finding was that people reporting\nrespiratory symptoms in the absence of lung func-\ntion impairment also reported fair or poor health\nstatus, or functional limitations at a level similar to\nthat seen in moderate COPD. In the GOLD criteria for\nCOPD the presence of respiratory symptoms in the\nabsence of lung function impairment is considered\nStage 0 COPD, with the recommended intervention\nbeing `information and advice about reducing risk\nfactors' [14]. The data suggest that some of these\nTable 3 Results from logistic regression models predicting functional limitations in both univariate models and multivariate models\nadjusted for age, sex, race, smoking status, body mass index and the presence of chronic disease.

Although diagnosed cardiovascu-\nlar disease was controlled for in this analysis (and a\nhigher proportion of subjects with diagnosed disease\nhad respiratory symptoms in the absence of lung\nfunction impairment, Table 1), it is possible that\nundiagnosed cardiovascular disease may be related\nto both the presence of respiratory symptoms and\nthe reporting of functional limitations [10].\nAnother somewhat surprising finding was the\nhigh proportion of subjects with lung function\nimpairment who did not report functional limita-\ntions. For example, only 18% of subjects with severe\nCOPD reported they were unable to walk a quarter\nof a mile (Table 2). This paradox can be explained,\nin part, by age-adjustment, which weighted the\nresults towards the younger participants. In non\nage-adjusted results, 45.5% of subjects with severe\nCOPD reported being unable to walk a quarter of a\nmile, but these were over represented amongst the\nolder subjects. It is still likely, however, that people\nunderreport functional limitations.\nThis analysis has some limitations. As a cross-\nsectional study, it could not determine whether the\nlung function impairment or respiratory symptoms\nactually led to the higher level of functional limita-\ntions. This is particularly true with regard to\nrespiratory symptoms; it is possible that people\nreporting more respiratory symptoms report many\nthings, including functional limitations, more fre-\nquently. Over 20% of the eligible sample was\nmissing data on either covariates or outcomes and\nwas excluded from the analysis. Those excluded\ntended to be older and, presumably, sicker, than\nthose included, so findings may actually underesti-\nmate the extent of limitation associated with lung\nfunction impairment or respiratory symptoms.\nIn conclusion, this analysis finds that obstructive\nlung disease, restrictive lung disease and respirat-\nory symptoms are all associated with a significantly\nhigher risk of functional impairment and fair or\npoor health status. A large proportion of lung\ndisease is undiagnosed in the US, which has led to\ninitiatives such as the National Lung Health\nEducation Program that promote more widespread\nuse of spirometry in primary care settings [24, 25].\nAlthough the main objective of this programme is\nthe early detection of COPD, spirometry would also\ndetect restrictive lung disease, which would require\nfurther clinical evaluation and treatment. In addi-\ntion, this analysis highlights the importance of\nchronic respiratory symptoms that may be amen-\nable to clinical interventions or considered in\nstudies looking at functional limitations as end-\npoints.\nConflict of interest statement\nNo conflict of interest declared.\nReferences\n1 Mannino DM, Homa DM, Akinbami L, Ford ES, Redd SC.\nSurveillance for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \u00ad\n2 Gay SE, Kazerooni EA, Toews GB et al.
