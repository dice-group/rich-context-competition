But understanding,\nclassifications, methodologies, characterization, typology,\nand so on of human behavior--incorporating body, mind,\nand soul--has been a corner stone of the Indian medical\nsystem, which has a significant segment on psychological\naspects of human behavior, although it is not detailed under\nthe name of \"Psychology.\" The coining of the term is a rela-\ntively recent phenomenon compared with the medical tradi-\ntion. Although psychology per se was not studied, some of\nthe essential thoughts that burned at stalwarts of Indian intel-\nlectual traditions were the following: \"Who is the person?\"\n\"How does he think?\" \"What is thinking?\" \"What is seeing?\"\n\"What is the mind?\" and \"What is it made up of?\" These and\nmany more questions that delve into a person's psyche were\nof utmost importance to our seers and sages. These have led\nto immense bodies of knowledge--spiritual, technical, prac-\ntical, and empirical--which are yet to be explored and dis-\nseminated even to this day. \"Indian psychology is a complex\nsubject variously viewed as esoteric and spiritual, philo-\nsophical and speculative, practical and ritualistic, and of\ncourse, as we believe, systematic and scientific understand-\ning of human nature. There is truth in all these characteriza-\ntions\" (Rao, Paranjpe, & Dalal, 2008, p. xvii). Indian\npsychology can also mean the psychology practiced by\npsychologists in India but is not restricted to this, although\nthis is what most people think it is. Although the psychology\nstudied in Indian colleges and universities is western in\nnature, there are now some universities that offer a basic\ncourse on Indian psychology.\nIndian psychology refers partly to aspects of psychology\nthat are directed to understanding the\nbehavioural perspectives and psychologically relevant\nexistential problems of Indians.

All these and more open up new\nfrontiers for serious psychological study and research\nanchored in Indian conceptual system. (Rao et al.,\nStudy of Personality in India\nPersonality has always captured the attention of psycholo-\ngists in the past. This tradition has influenced Indian psy-\nchology too. Personality is studied and understood with\nreference to two systems in Indian traditions. One is the\nbiological system and the other is the psychological system.\nThe biological system is set forth and understood by the\nmedical texts and scriptures like Ayurveda, which have very\nspecific ways of understanding health and ill-health and how\nit is to be treated. These texts are very descriptive and exhaus-\ntive, where Ayurveda is considered to be a part of the Atharva\nVeda. These rely heavily on the Pancha Mahabhutas, their\ncombinations yielding to the biological humors of Tridoshas--\nVata, Pitta, and Kapha (VPK)--and their psychological\ncorrelates of Trigunas--Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas (SRT)--to\nexplain the body, the mind, their constituents, and the cor-\nresponding behavior patterns including the spiritual aspect\ninvolved.\nWhile Charaka and Susruta have enumerated the different\npsychological typologies that people can be classified under\nin addition to an exhaustive description of the Tridoshas,\ntheir balanced states and consequences of the imbalances,\nthey have not gone into minute details with regard to the\nTrigunas as they have done with Tridoshas. It is to be noted\nhere that the Tridoshas, or the physiological humors and the\nTrigunas, are fundamental constituents of Prakriti as enunci-\nated in the Samkhya-Yoga system of philosophy. Both are\ncomposed of the Pancha Mahabhutas, but their action and\ninfluence are on different systems that operate on man--the\nphysical-physiological (Tridoshas) and the psychological\n(Trigunas). Each has their own unique actions, methodology\nof behavior, and categorization, and one cannot replace the\nother, although all six of them act in tandem and one cannot\nexist without the other. All six of them are present in all\nbeings at all times, only the combinations and dominations\nThe ayurvedic concepts of Tridosha and Triguna are well\ndelineated and appear to be a consolidation of the concepts\nthat have been borrowed from the other schools of thought or\nrather Darsanas. Even so, there is no coherent consolidation\nof the different aspects of personality from the various sources\nof Indian philosophical systems. Admittedly, the Indian liter-\nary corpus is a vast ocean--of systems, philosophies, schools\nof thought, literary influences, artistic influences, and what\nnot. But the commonality in each of them remains to be\nfound. The characteristics of man, or the Lakshanas of great\nmen as Varaha Mihira puts it in his Brhat Samhita, which is\nan extension of his Brhat Jataka, is one such example. In the\nsame way, each of the different scriptural sources of India, be\nit the Vedas, the Upanisads, the Bhagavad Gita, the\nMahabharata, the Nirukta, the Puranas, the Samkhya, and\nthe Yoga to name a few, has interpretations of the different\ncharacteristics of how people are to be assessed and under-\nstood to be of different kinds. Psychology as a field of human\nunderstanding, which is the main focus of psychology, would\nbe enriched as a consequence of studying the nature or\npsyche of man through this elemental method of scientific\nand ancient tradition, which is a treasure trove of psychologi-\ncal concepts waiting to be tapped.\nBackground Information\nAbout the Study\nThis article consists of the standardization procedure that\nwas undertaken by the authors while developing a scale to\nassess personality of people based on Trigunas. This forms\nonly part of the work that was undertaken by the first author\nas a part of the thesis submitted for award of a doctoral\ndegree, while the second author is the guide and mentor for\nthis doctoral work.\nThe thesis consisted of developing and standardizing a set\nof scales to assess personality of people from the Indian\npsychological perspective, namely, Tridoshas (physical-\nphysiological component) and Trigunas (psycho-spiritual\ncomponent). The scale that was developed to assess the\nTridoshas has also been standardized; the same has been\naccepted for publication in a reputed international peer-\nreviewed journal. This article comprises the standardization\nprocedure that was followed for the scale based on the\nTrigunas. Both these scales, one based on the Tridoshas and\nthe other based on the Trigunas, are stand-alone scales that\ncan be used alone (to assess the Tridoshas or Trigunas in a\nperson) or in conjunction with each other to arrive at a com-\nplete and holistic understanding of personality from the\nIndian concepts. What is presented here is the first-level anal-\nysis that is conducted to assess the dominant guna combina-\ntion of a person. The raw scores of the person is calculated\n(simple addition) and converted to Stanine scores. The salient\ncharacteristics of each of the gunas are also delineated.\nThe third scale is also a Triguna scale, but it is not a stand-\nalone scale and is an adjunct to the main Triguna scale (the\npresent article and scale is the main one). It is not necessary\nfor the first-level analysis but is an integral part of the second-\nand third-level analyses.\nThere are 189 traits (common for the physical and psy-\nchological aspect; hence, there are 189 physical or VPK\ntraits and 189 psychological or SRT traits) that have been\nidentified, which comprise the gamut of human behavior.\ntraits. Based on answers that are obtained in the question-\nnaires, these 189 traits can be measured. (The answers are\nDatar and Murthy 3\nrearranged in a predetermined combination that yields the\n189 VPK and SRT traits.) The raw scores for each of the\nto Stanine scores. The interpretations for the Stanine scores\nare also delineated. This comprises the second-level\nanalysis.\nadded to give one consolidated score. Then, these 189 traits\nare again combined in a set logic, wherein each trait is a\ncharacteristic behavior exhibited by one (or more) of the 16\nclassical personality types (16 CPT) as delineated in classi-\ncal and ayurvedic texts. So these 189 traits are all character-\nistics of these principal 16 CPT (these personalities too\ncan be combined to give various combinations, to under-\nstand and classify people). This comprises the third level of\nanalysis.\nAlthough every individual answers three scales, the\nanswers undergo three different levels of analyses. After\nthese analyses, first, the unique and specific Tridosha and\nTriguna combination of the person is tabulated and salient\ncharacteristics mentioned. Next, his or her scores and inter-\npretations for the 189 traits (physical as well as psychologi-\ncal) are delineated. Next, he or she is compared with the 16\nCPT--Raw scores as well as Stanines, after they are tabu-\nlated. In addition, the percentage of each of the 16 CPT is\nalso calculated. This calculation happens in three different\naspects of Sattva types, Rajas types, and Tamas types of per-\nsonality and their relative dominance in each individual.\nThis details the dominance of each category of personality in\nthe individual and can be compared with the first-level analy-\nsis for a further reinforcement of combinations of Trigunas in\npeople.BecausetheVPKaswellasSRTanswersareencrypted\nin the 16 CPT analysis, there is no question of faking, social\ndesirability index, and so on, which are commonly thought to\nhave effects on answers, as all raw scores are also converted\nto Stanine and each and every answer the individual gives is\nalso rated by himself or herself.\nIn this background, the present article is the standard-\nization procedure followed for the Triguna scale. Although\nsome of the Tamo guna items would incur social desirabil-\nity answers, thereby leading people to answer in ideal sce-\nnarios, the authors noticed that it did not really have much\nof an impact. This is because, based on the answers the\nperson gave, and the different levels of analyses that were\nconducted, both analyses at the first level and the third\nlevel matched. Also, a statistical intercorrelation of VPK\nand SRT was also undertaken based on the answers\nobtained. The intercorrelations were found to follow the\nsame pattern as delineated in ayurvedic texts (with some\nminor changes). This too has been submitted as an article\nto another international journal, and has been accepted for\npublication.\nThe mandate of one of the authors (whose doctoral work\nthis comprised) was to study the personality patterns of peo-\nple from three different professions, namely, teachers, IT\nprofessionals, and police personnel. This was required so\nthat a personality profile of these three professions could be\ndeveloped and compared. Hence, the different inclusion/\nexclusion criteria were exercised so as to enable them to take\nonly those respondents who fitted these conditions, so as to\ndevelop a personality profile of people working in these dif-\nferent professions.\nDevelopment of the Mysore\nTriguna Scale\nIn this article, an attempt is made to describe the test\nconstruction and the standardization procedures and\nresults that were obtained for the development of the\nscale based on Trigunas, their permutation and combina-\ntion, and relative domination in personality assessment.\nThis scale will hereafter be referred to as the Mysore\nTriguna scale.\nInformation about the Pancha Mahabhutas and Trigunas\nwas collected from various sources of Indian philosophy,\nancient texts, and all other material related to psychology\nfrom an Indian perspective. These texts and scriptures\ninclude the Vedas, Upanishads, Mimamsa Sutras, Samkhya,\nYoga Sutras of Patanjali, Yoga Vasistha of Valmiki, 17 Maha\nPuranas (the researcher was unable to find one Maha\nPurana, which was out of print), 5 Upa-Puranas, Srimad\nRamayana of Valmiki, Mahabharata, Shrimad Bhagavad\nGita, Dharmashastras, Ayurveda, Encyclopedia of Indian\nMedicines, Nighantu and Nirukta, Bhaktirasamrta Bindu of\nRupa Goswamin, Natya Sastra of Bharata, Iswara Samhita,\nManu Smriti, Brhad Devata, Elements of Hindu Iconography,\nto name a few.\nIn the Indian psychological literature, Guna theory is\nalready empirically tested and accepted (Murthy, P.K., &\nKumar, 2007). Each guna gives certain characteristic quali-\nties to the person based on which an individual can be classi-\nfied as belonging to that particular guna type. Charaka and\nSusruta recognize seven types or categories into which peo-\nple can be classified, depending on the dominance of the\ngunas in their body. They are said to belong to a particular\nguna combination, as follows:\n1. people with dominant Sattva Guna\n2. people with dominant Rajas Guna\n3. people with dominant Tamas Guna\n4. people with dominant Sattva-Rajas Guna combination\n5. people with dominant Sattva-Tamas Guna combi-\nnation\n6. people with dominant Rajas-Tamas Guna combi-\nnation\n7. people with balanced gunas or with Sattva-Rajas-\nTamas Guna combination.\nOn observing the aforementioned classification that can\nbe used for categorizing people, we can confidently say that\n4 SAGE Open\nthere can never be a state when either one or two of the gunas\nare absent in any person at any point of time whatsoever.\nHence, all people are only combinations of these three gunas\nin varying combinations and permutations. Depending on the\ncircumstances, the dominance of the gunas are changing, but\nin relatively small quantities that give rise to our expressions\nof anger, fear, anxiety, sadness, joy, and so on. If there were\nno movement of the gunas, then the expression of different\nemotions would not be there in our behavior too. No person is\nalways happy, always sad, or always depressed and so on.\nHence, the study of the gunas, their movement in people, and\nhow they affect our daily life and behavior make for fascinat-\ning study. Thus, the relative dominance and relevance of the\ngunas in people can be studied and classified accordingly\nto ensure a better understanding of human behavior. This\narticle is just the beginning of this journey.\nReview of Literature\nThere have been various attempts by researchers to develop\ntools from these three models, Pancha Kosas, Tridoshas, and\nTrigunas, to study and assess personality from the Indian\nperspective. The different studies and tools that have been\ntaken up and developed from these three domains have been\nmentioned here.\nThe Trigunas and their manifestation, and their effect\non the human mind and consequently on human behavior,\nare subjects that have attracted the attention of psycholo-\ngists across the world, with researchers not only from\nIndia but from other countries too having studied it.\nConsequently, there are many tools that have been devel-\noped to study the play of the Trigunas on the human per-\nsonality (Krishnamurthy, Lakshmi, & Parameswaran, 1971;\nsonality development (Modh, personal communication,\nA projective-inventory method for personality assessment\n(Puhan, 1995) has also been attempted from the Indian perspec-\ntive.ThewellknownandreveredIndianepic,theMahabharata,\nhas also been studied for its contribution to the understanding of\nhuman behavior and dynamics based on which there has been\na tool developed (Singh, R., 1971), while the Bhagavad Gita,\nwhich is universally acknowledged as a classical text in under-\nstanding human personality and psychology by one and all, has\nalso been the basis for a good number of tools to be developed\nto study personality (Das, R.C., 1991; Laxmibai, Murthy, &\nInfant temperament from an Indian perspective has been\nstudied by Kapur, Hirisave, Reddy, Barnabas, and Singhal\n(1997), using a previous tool developed by Marutham et al.\n(1998) for the assessment; a shorter version of the tool devel-\noped by Pathak, Bhatt, and Sharma (1992) was developed to\nstudy self-concept and job satisfaction vis-\u00e0-vis the three\ngunas (Sharma, R., 1999). The IAS Rating scale developed\nby Matthew (1995) was used to study the three gunas, psi\nexperience, and personality dimensions (Sebastian &\nwas used in another study that delved into the Trigunas and\nhow they associated with psychological problems (Das &\nThe role of the three gunas among anxiety disorders\n(Velayudhan, Balodhi, & Mishra, 1998) and among patients\nwith depression (Kumar, 2006) has also been looked into\nbriefly. In the same vein, the effect of chanting the Hare\nKrishna Maha Mantra to increase Sattva and decrease Rajas\nYoga, pranayama, and thermal biofeedback techniques in the\nmanagement of stress and high blood pressure (Latha &\nKaliappan, 1991); and Yogic techniques that would promote\nmental health and alleviate mental and emotional distress\n(Kapur, R.L., 1994) were also explored. A randomized con-\ntrol trial of the effect of yoga on gunas (personality) and\nhealth in normal healthy volunteers of both sexes has been\nconducted (Deshpande, Nagendra, & Raghuram, 2008), and\nconclusions drawn.\nMysore Triguna Scale Construction\nThe constructs to assess the gunas in a person were identi-\nfied based on previous tools and from the vast amount of\nliterature available in the Indian tradition, like the Vedas,\nUpanishads, the Mahabharata--including the Bhagavad\nGita that forms a part of it, Samkhya, Yoga, Puranas, and\nAyurveda to name a few.\nThe scale underwent several revisions. Each one was cor-\nrected for grammatical errors, ambiguity, syntactic errors, and\nso on. The scale was thus finalized for the final pilot study.\nThis scale was later modified, by putting all constructs assess-\ning similar traits into a cluster. The markings indicating the\nstatements to be Sattva, Rajas, or Tamas were removed. In\neach construct itself, the three statements were jumbled up so\nthat there was no definite order of appearance of the three\ntypes of statements in all the construct-wise questions. The\nscale comprised 63 statements each to identify SRT. The total\nSampling Framework\nThe researchers intended to study three different sets of\nadults of occupational groups covering teachers, IT pro-\nfessionals, and the police personnel of Bangalore city.\nAlong with this, another group of people from different\nprofessions other than the three already mentioned was\nalso selected.\nTo this end, many different colleges, IT companies,\nand the police department were approached for their\ncooperation. Adults from the above groups were drawn\nDatar and Murthy 5\nrandomly, based on a set of criteria indicating job satis-\nfaction, absence of any psychiatric problems, and a mini-\nmum of 5 years of continuous practice in their chosen\nvocation.\nAs can be seen in Table 1, there were a total of 358 teach-\nthe general adult category, thus making the total number of\nrespondents for the study 1,548. The Mysore Triguna scale\nwas thus standardized on this sample, and results and infer-\nences drawn therein.\nCriteria for Inclusion and Exclusion\nThe criteria followed for the inclusion of people's data\ninto the final study and standardization of the scale were\nas follows.\n1. Only those people who had job satisfaction were\nincluded in the final analysis. To assess job satis-\nfaction, the Job Satisfaction Scale (Singh, A., &\n2. Only those who had no problems with mental\nhealth as assessed by the Modified MINI (Sheehan\n3. Only those who had no problems with drinking\nbehavior as assessed by the Alcohol Use Dis-\norders Identification Test (AUDIT; Babor, Higgins-\nBiddle, Saunders, & Monteiro, 2001) were\nincluded.\n4. Only nonsmokers as determined from the Fag-\nerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND;\nHeatherton, Kozlowski, Frecker, & Fagerstrom,\n1991) were taken into consideration and included.\n5. Only those people practicing in the profession for a\nminimum of 5 years consecutively were included.\nOnly those people who satisfied all the aforementioned\ncriteria were included in the study. There were 2,142\nrespondents for initial screening, and finally 1,548 were\nselected after satisfying various inclusion criteria.Although\nsome of the Tamo guna items would incur social desirabil-\nity answers, thereby leading people to answer in ideal\nscenarios, the authors noticed that it did not really have\nmuch of an impact.\nThe researchers wanted to study the domination of gunas\nin people belonging to different professions like teachers, IT\nprofessionals, and police personnel. Hence, all the aforemen-\ntioned criteria were used for inclusion and those who did not\nqualify were excluded from the study. This was to ensure\nthat as \"pure\" a sample as possible of individuals who clas-\nsically fit into the profession was obtained for comparison\nwith people from other professions.\nAn example of the kind of items included in the Triguna\nscale:\nDescription of my speech:\nA When I talk to other people, I get agitated easily but control\nmyself. Min. Avg. Strong.\nB \nWhen I talk to other people, I am calm, peaceful and\ntolerant.Min. Avg. Strong\nC I don't think before I talk. Min. Avg. Strong\nThe respondents were asked to tick the statement (1, 2,\nor all 3 if it is true of the respondents) that is most appli-\ncable to them, and also mark the degree to which it is\npresent in them, making the respondents rate their own\nbehavior in different situations. No triplet of answers\ncould be ignored. Because software was developed for the\npurpose of assessment of personality, this could be\ncontrolled.\nEstablishing the Psychometric\nProperties of the Scale\nReliability, validity, and norms for the Mysore Triguna scale\nwere developed as follows:\nReliability\nThe researchers have attempted to establish different pos-\nsible types of reliability.\nCronbach's alpha reliability. The reliability statistics that\nwere observed on administering the scale to the sample of\n1,548 people for the standardization of the scale are shown in\nTable 1.

Reliability Coefficients for Mysore Triguna Scale\nConstructs Cronbach's  coefficients Items\n6 SAGE Open\nSRT scale is a self-rating scale, which has 189 items, with\n63 items each for assessing SRT in a respondent. The\nCronbach's alpha for the scale was .969 for Sattva, .911 for\nRajas, and .876 for Tamas. Thus, the reliability coefficient is\nvery high.\nSplit-half reliability. Split-half reliability of the scale was\nalso found. The scale was divided into two parts, wherein\nThe mean for Part 1 was found to be 59.71 and that of\nPart 2 was found to be 57.44, as shown in Table 3. The alpha\nvalue for Part 1 was found to be .93 and that of Part 2 was\n.92. The correlation between forms was found to be .96. The\nSpearman-Brown coefficient was applied; the value for\nequal length was found to be .98 and that of unequal length\nwas found to be .98. The Guttman split-half coefficient was\nalso computed and it was found to be .98. Thus, the high\nlevel of correlation indicates that the scale is highly reliable\n(Table 4).\nTest\u00adretest reliability. Test\u00adretest reliability of the scale was\nestablished by administering the test to a group of 60 people\nwith a gap of about 20 days from the first administration.\nThe Pearson correlation for Sattva items was found to be\npositive and significant at the .01 level, as can be seen in Table 5.\nThus, it can be concluded that this scale is a reliable one.\nValidity\nTwo kinds of validity were established, as follows:\nContent validity. Content validity was established by sub-\njecting the items of the scale to the scrutiny of ayurvedic,\nphilosophy, and Sanskrit specialists, and their concordance\nwas obtained. Wherever possible, their suggestions to\nenhance the items were incorporated, and the items were\nrephrased so as to elicit better responses.\nThe items were developed for the Triguna scale and\nshown to experts and other scholars in the field of\nSanskrit and philosophy along with Ayurveda, to get\ntheir ratings, which were the bases for developing the\nscale other than referring to other tools that assess gunas\nin a person.\nTable 6 indicates that 100% of the ayurvedic experts have\nagreed that these items are measuring SRT. Thus, the items\nhave very high content validity.\nThe items of the Mysore Triguna scale were shown to\nexperts in the field of Sanskrit and philosophy, and their rat-\nings are indicated in Table 7.\nThe items of the Mysore Triguna scale were shown to\nSanskrit scholars and philosophers to get their approval, as\nthis was a multidisciplinary work involving knowledge derived\nfrom the fields of Ayurveda, Sanskrit, and philosophy--from\nthe psychological perspective of understanding human\nbehavior and its dynamics. There was concordance from all\nthe specialists about the items as all of them have agreed that\nthe items are acceptable.\nApart from getting the ratings on the items by the above\nspecialists, the ratings of psychologists were also sought to\nvalidate it from the domain of psychology. The ratings\nreceived from psychologists are indicated in Table 8.\nAn analysis of Table 8 indicates that 90% of the psycholo-\ngists have agreed that the items developed for assessing\nTriguna do really assess Triguna. Hence, the scale has a high\nmeasure of content validity.\nConcurrent validity. Concurrent validity of the scale was\nalso established by comparing the responses of the same\nrespondents on the Mysore Triguna scale and those on the\nRenu Sharma's SRT Scale, which assesses SRT in an indi-\nvidual. Renu Sharma's tool was administered to 60 people\napart from the present tool. Thus, all the 60 respondents took\nboth the tests. The obtained results were subjected to correla-\ntion, which yielded the following.\nAn analysis of the Table 9 indicates that the correlation\ncoefficient was found to be .776 for Sattva, .835 for Rajas,\nand .427 for Tamas, and the coefficients were found to be\nstatistically significant at the .01 level. This means that,\nbecause the correlation between the two scales is high and\nstatistically significant, the validity of the Mysore Triguna\nscale developed by the researchers is highly valid. This indi-\ncates that the present scale is a valid one.\nThe salient characteristics of SRT were identified and can\nbe seen in Table 10.\nTable 3.

These score ranges can be converted into\nStanine scores using Table 11. Thus, an individual can be\nassessed on SRT based on their responses. Stanines 1 to 3 indi-\ncates a lower presence of the guna, 4 to 6 indicates average, and\n7 to 9 indicates a higher presence of the guna. Thus, individuals\ncan be identified and categorized on different levels of guna.\nAn analysis of Table 12 indicates that the distribution of\nscores are closer to a normal probability curve, as all the\nmeasures of central tendency are very close to each other.\nThus, it suggests that these gunas are distributed normally in\nany population. Furthermore, one can also infer that the pres-\nent sample also represents the population adequately well.\nConclusion\nThe authors have been able to develop a scale to assess\nSRT--the concepts taken from the Indian intellectual tradi-\ntion and Ayurveda--and validated it from the domain of\npsychology using psychometric procedures.
