To reduce attrition and ensure continual growth in online courses, it is important to continue to review current and\nupdated literature to understand the changing behaviors of online learners and faculty in the 21st century and examine how\nthey fit together as a cohesive educational unit. This article reviews literature to ascertain critical reasons for high attrition\nrates in online classes, as well as explore solutions to boost retention rates. This will help create a starting point and\nfoundation for a more, in-depth research and analysis of retention issues in online courses. Examining these issues is critical\nto contemporary learning environments.\n",

With the rapid rise in online course enrollment\ncomes a growing concern for low retention rates in many\nonline courses and programs. Heyman (2010) points out that\none of the biggest concerns in online education emanates\nfrom the excessively high attrition rates in fully online pro-\ngrams compared with traditional classes. Online courses\nhave a 10% to 20% higher failed retention rate than tradi-\nto 80% online students drop out of online classes (B. Smith,\n2010). Review of existing literature indicates that online\ncourses have several social, technological, and motivational\nissues existing from both the learners' and the faculty's\nperspectives.\nThe Importance of Studying Retention\nIssues in Online Courses\nThe online delivery system has revolutionized educational\ntechnology and has provided easy access to learning for mul-\ntitudes of students, including many who were unable to go to\nschool prior to this revolution. Today, online education is one\nof the top industries in the world, providing support, knowl-\nedge, and jobs to a large segment of the world's population.\nAllen and Seaman (2011) report that more than 6 million stu-\ndents were taking at least one online course in the year 2010\nand that there is a steady 10% growth in online course enroll-\nments. Online learning is also becoming an integral part of\ncorporate training. Organizations that utilize this platform\nhave better chances at business and financial gains, as it pro-\nvides a positive impact on workplace motivation. Access to\nelectronic data and a self-paced learning environment may\nincrease the interest and value of on-the-job training\nDespite all these benefits, online classes continue to dis-\nplay serious retention issues, which need to be addressed. A\ngood place to start this is by examining why online learners\nleave, when in their academic careers are they most prone to\nleave, and what can be done to eliminate or mitigate these\ncauses. Literature reviews indicate that the online attrition\npattern is not limited to any specific period or level of gradu-\nation. Students may withdraw from online classes anytime in\nthe semester and at any level of their learning process.\nSeveral studies have been conducted specifically to observe\nwhen and why students withdraw from graduate programs.\nThe study conducted by Perry, Boman, Care, Edwards, and\nhad withdrawn from the graduate program, 17 had been\naccepted, but they did not begin any class work prior to with-\ndrawing. The balance consisted of students who had been\nregistered and had started attending their classes, and yet\ndecided to drop the program. These students stayed in the\n1Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nPapia Bawa, Purdue University, 1623 Lionheart Lane, West Lafayette, IN\nEmail: pbawa@ivytech.edu\nRetention in Online Courses: Exploring\nIssues and Solutions--A Literature Review\nPapia Bawa1\n Keywords\nonline courses, student retention models, social and motivational issues, technology in online courses, online learners and\nfaculty, computer-mediated communications, online course design\n2 SAGE Open\nprogram anywhere between 2 months and 2 years. Willging\nand Johnson's (2009) study indicated that although students\nwere less likely to leave after investing in several semesters,\nthere was no dominant reason for dropping out. Most stu-\ndents dropped out of a program due to personal, job-related,\nand program-related reasons. Perry et al. (2008) mention the\nCanadian Association of Graduate Schools Report of 2004,\nwhich indicates that withdrawals from programs may occur\neven after several semesters.\nJaggars (2011) refers to several research reviews indicat-\ning that the mid-semester withdrawal rates for online courses\nmay be higher than face-to-face courses. Levy's (2007) study\nindicates that students at a lower learning level at college are\nat a higher risk of dropping out than upper level students.\nStudents who are less experienced and at an earlier semester\nof their program are more likely to drop the program. Levy\nindicated that students who are in the early stages of their\nprogram feel less prepared to deal with the academic rigors.\nOn the contrary, students who have spent longer time in the\nprogram may be more motivated to complete the course,\nbecause they have already invested considerable time and\nefforts on it. The input in time and effort is a critical determi-\nnant as to when a student is more likely to withdraw.\nThe fact that students are liable to withdraw at any given\nstage makes it even more crucial to explore ways and means\nto mitigate the underlining causes of this phenomenon.\nStanford-Bowers (2008) points out that a fall in online attri-\ntion rates will benefit students, faculty, and institutions. They\nbelieve that this can be accomplished if all those who have a\nvested interest in online learning recognize the significance\nof this new trend in the educational industry and examine\nevery aspect of this revolutionary learning medium (Stanford-\nTheoretical Backgrounds for Examining\nOnline Learners\nA synthesis of literature information pertaining to retention\nissues and solutions for online environments must begin with\na discussion of the theoretical concepts that determine the\ncontexts within which online learning environments and\nlearners are placed. There are several sociological theories,\nwhich explain learner behaviors in an online context. These,\nin turn, can become predictors and precursors of issues and\nsolutions pertaining to online environments. Theories of\nmarginalization or social exclusion have been used in litera-\nture to explain decisions of learners to select or reject the\nonline platform. Ball, Davies, David, and Reay (2002) dis-\ncuss how \"the perceptions and choices of prospective HE\n(higher education) students are constructed within a complex\ninterplay of social factors that are underpinned by basic\nsocial class and ethnic differences\" (p. 53). Based on their\nstudy, Ball et al. determined that learners used cognitive and\nsocial criteria to determine their choices.\nFor the social criteria, the determining factors are the\nlearners' perceptions of social classification of self and insti-\ntutions. Many times, learners gravitate toward online envi-\nronments as it provides them with the perceived benefits of\n\"virtual\" anonymity and protection from being at the receiv-\ning end of discriminatory behavior. However, in the context\nof marginalization issues, although online environments can\nprovide some protection, under certain circumstances, this\nenvironment can become the issue. D. Smith and Ayers\n(2006) discuss such implications through the lens of com-\nmunity colleges. Their examination points to the critical\nissue of the prevalence of Westernized curriculum within the\nUnited States that places marginalized learners in a situation\nwhere \"the pro-Western bias inherent in the technological\nfoundations of distance learning presents an obstacle both to\naccess and to understanding\" (D. Smith & Ayers, 2006,\np. 402). Nuances of cross-cultural communication, coupled\nwith technological impediments, can create untenable learning\nenvironments, leading to attrition. \" . . . when discourses are\nintricately nuanced with specific cultural meanings, such mean-\ningsmaybe`lostintranslation'astheyareconvertedtoWestern-\nThus, although technology can be considered neutral, there is\nalways the danger of its hegemonic contamination.\nMotivational theories of self-determination and self-\nefficacy are also pertinent to examining learners within\nonline environments. Self-determination is defined as action\ngenerated by one's own mind or free will, with no influence\nfrom outside situations or entities (Wehmeyer, Abery,\nhow in the context of online learners, self-determination the-\nory prescribes three needs, namely, a sense of control, feel-\nings of competency for tasks, and sense of inclusion or\naffiliation with others. Just as the satisfaction of these needs\nfosters better performance, the absence may actually produce\nhighly negative results. While examining a model of online\nlearner motivation based on Deci and Ryan's (1985) self-\ndetermination theory, Chen and Jang demonstrated the direct\ncorrelation between contextual support by teachers, need sat-\nisfaction of students, motivation, and performance. They con-\ncluded that online learners have different reasons to participate\nin class, including their perceptions of how the three needs of\nself-determination are met or unmet. Learners belonging to\nmarginalized groups will need special consideration if these\nneeds are to be satisfied, which means teachers need to be\ncognizant of the student backgrounds and design their contex-\ntual support strategies accordingly. In fact, the study sug-\ngested, \"haphazard and aimless supports without addressing\nstudents'needs are likely to lead to adverse--even worse than\nUnfortunately, the online environments may include cul-\nturally unaware faculty who are rapidly being thrown into a\nsituation that they were not historically prepared to face.\nAlthough the globalization of education is a relatively new\ntrend, it has escalated exponentially within this decade. This\nhas given birth to a situation wherein many faculty and\ninstructors have had little to no time to increase their own\ncultural awareness, at least not to the extent required by the\ncultural rigors of this evolving situation. Due to education\nglobalization, this issue is becoming increasingly pro-\nnounced, as more and more foreign students seek to enroll\nthemselves in courses offered by the United States and\nEurope, attracted by the perceived value that credits and\ndegrees from such courses/institutions may provide for them.\nIn the majority of the cases, such learners enroll in courses\nled by faculty who may have little to no exposure to the inter-\nnational community (Stewart, 2012). Despite having the best\nintentions, the lack of cross-cultural interaction also creates a\nlack of empathy for one another on part of both students and\ntive or negative self-determination situations nestled within\nonline environments will affect the retention of online\nlearners.\nProponents of socio-cognitive views and models\nself-efficacy beliefs of learners determine their abilities to\npersist and self-regulate. Shea and Bidjerano (2010) studied\nthe Community of Inquiry model as proposed by Garrison,\nAnderson, and Archer (2000), and concluded that human,\nface to face, interaction may have a more positive effect on\nlearners' self-efficacy beliefs. They indicated that \"This\nresult provides support for the assumption that the absence of\ntraditional and familiar classroom conventions may result in\nadditional uncertainty for fully online students\" (p. 1727) and\nsought to argue in favor of the need \"to pay more attention to\nsupporting the relationship between teaching presence and\nself-efficacy in fully online environments\" (p. 1727). Thus,\nthey supported blended environments as opposed to fully\nonline ones. The fact remains that not all online programs\ncan afford to provide \"live\" student\u00adteacher interaction,\nwhich means that the underpinning issues of learner demoti-\nvation remain at large in fully online environments.\nConstructivism and andragogy are closely related con-\ncepts and a huge factor in determining the content, structure,\nand climate of online learning environments. Chu and Tsai\n(2009) studied the factors that influence adult learners to\nselect online programs/courses. They concluded that even\nthough adult learners have concerns about their Internet effi-\ncacies, they find the constructivist approach of self-directed\nlearning prevalent in online environments very attractive.\nHowever, this preference may not be enough to sustain such\nlearners within the online environments, given their lower\neducational technology and Internet usage skills. Most of\nthese learners belong to the \"digital immigrant\" group\n(Prensky, 2001), and although they could be technology users\nfor personal things, they may not be equally well informed\nwhen it comes to using educational technology. Thus, online\neducators and course designers have a greater responsibility\nto give enough time to adult learners to practice online\nactivities to increase confidence, design content that the\nlearners can connect to their everyday lives, and provide\nresources to allow the learners to construct their own knowl-\nedge of pedagogy and technology (Chu & Tasi, 2009). In the\nabsence of such comprehensive teaching and designing\napproaches, it is very likely that adult learners may not pre-\nvail within an online environment.\nCognitivism and related theories are critical to under-\nstanding online education, particularly when viewed through\nthe lens of globalized content creation and management, as is\nrequired in many online learning programs that have interna-\ntional students. Silva, Costa, Rogerson, and Prior (2009)\nconducted a meta-analysis of different learning theories to\ndefine knowledge and content with respect to different peda-\ngogical approaches. When defining the boundaries of knowl-\nedge with relationship to online learning environments, they\nstate that cognitive appropriation is key to justifiable knowl-\nedge. Budin (2008) discussed the significance of content as\nbeing culture-bound, meaning that the users of content may\ncome from widely diverse populations. Hence, the process of\ncontent management must include a justifiable consideration\nfor cultural factors with respect to content design.\nSiemens's (2014) theory of \"Connectivism\" provides a\nnew spin on traditional learning theories, by addressing the\ntechnological and digital aspects of learning. Traditional\ntheories rely on the belief that learning takes place within\npeople and that it is a social process. Siemens argues that\nlearning also occurs outside of people, within the realms of\ntechnology and organizations as individual entities. His\nbelief is that given the importance of technology in the learn-\ning environs, the focus of discussion and analysis must shift\nfrom the actual process of learning to understanding the\nvalue that any learning can bring. Siemens defines learning\nas \"actionable knowledge\" (p. 5) that can exist outside the\nrealm of human cognition, within organizations and data-\nbases. Being able to make connections within and between\nspecialized information that enables us to learn more \"are\nmore important than our current state of knowing\" (p. 5). In\nthis context, Connectivism is \"The ability to draw distinc-\ntions between important and unimportant information . . .\nThe ability to recognize when new information alters the\nlandscape based on decisions made yesterday\" (p. 5). This\nline of thought highlights new paradigms and possibly new\nchallenges, which must be taken into cognizance when ana-\nlyzing online environments.\nExamining High Attrition Rates in\nOnline Environments\nMisconceptions Relating to Cognitive Load\nOnline learning may sometimes be a completely new plat-\nform for learners, but learners still choose it using several dif-\nferent criteria and assumptions. Common assumptions related\nto online learning are that because face-to-face presence is\n4 SAGE Open\nnot required, an online platform will be less demanding on\ntime, will require less effort to manage workload, and will\nnot disrupt the learners' lifestyle. Schaarsmith (2012) indi-\ncates that some of the reasons students have for joining\nonline courses is related to financial factors, such as saving\nmoney on transportation, and the ability to continue working\nwhile pursuing a degree. Shay and Rees's (2004) research\ndata indicate something similar. When asked about the most\nimportant reasons for choosing online classes, students indi-\ncated that they chose online courses based on considerations\nsuch as convenience, flexibility, opportunity to fuse their\ncurrent lifestyles to their desire to study, availability of pro-\ngrams, and affordability (Shay & Rees, 2004).\nAlthough most of these reasons could be valid and viable,\nthey are also indicative that learners do not consider the mag-\nnitude of workload and the required depth of their involve-\nment in the online courses as reasonable criteria to make the\ndecision to go online. As a result, when they attend the online\nclasses, many of them are unpleasantly surprised to find that\nthe conveniences of flexible hours and lower cost outweigh\nthe inconveniences of excessive demands on lifestyles, tech-\nnical issues, and concerns related to the attitude and aptitude\nof learners toward a new platform. Online learning environ-\nment is very largely self-driven and dependent on the learn-\ners' ability to manage academic responsibilities, with fewer\nprops than those available in face-to-face classes. If learners\nhave not experienced this kind of self-imposed academic dis-\ncipline before, they are very likely to experience demotiva-\ntion, forcing them to quit. Another factor in this equation is\nthat many online classes follow constructivist models of\nteaching, wherein learners are given props and aids to learn,\nbut are left to solve complex problems on their own. If learn-\ners are not comfortable with self-learning and constructing\nknowledge out of their own initiatives, the online environ-\nment can become intimidating for them.\nSpiro, Coulson, Feltovich, andAnderson (1988) researched\nthe issues and impediments related to \"advanced knowledge\nacquisition in ill-structured domains\" (p. 2). While discussing\ntheir cognitive flexibility theory, they refer to the need for the\nlearner to \"attain a deeper understanding of content material,\nreason with it, and apply it flexibly in diverse contexts\" (p. 2).\nDriscoll (2005) takes cue from this concept when she dis-\ncusses how \"errors of oversimplification, overgeneralization,\nand overreliance on context-independent representations\" can\noccur when learners attempt to understand \"ill-structured\ndomains,\" by applying the same information they had used to\nunderstand \"well-structured domains\" (p. 398). When learn-\ners use their experiences from the well-structured domains of\nface-to-face courses as benchmarks for online classes, they\nmay perceive the online environment as ill structured. A\nreview of literature indicates that these misconceptions\nrelated to the cognitive loads or overloads may significantly\ncontribute to higher attrition rates. Paas, Renkl, and Sweller\n(2004) refer to the concept of cognitive load as a situation where\nlearners are intimidated by a large amount of information that\nneeds to be processed all at once before real learning can\nbegin. Their study discusses the importance of \"managing\nworking memory load in order to facilitate the changes in\nlong-term memory associated with schema construction and\nWhen learners are not familiar with the online educational\ndelivery system, they are more apt to be frustrated with the\ndisparities existing between the long-term memories of their\nface-to-face course associations and the new realities of\nonline learning that they are forced to face. McQuaid (2009)\nanalyzed the effects of cognitive load on online learners and\ndiscussed how important it is for learners to adapt to the\nonline learning environment for meaningful learning to take\nplace, as well as the critical need for instructional designers\nto adapt to the learners' assumptions about their ability to\ncomplete a course.\nAnother thing to consider is the fact that online courses\nallow for less student\u00adteacher interaction, as opposed to\nface-to-face. Even though multiple communication options\nare available in online setups, they may not be used as exten-\nsively as they should be, simply because the usage is largely\ndependent on the learners' own initiatives. Consequently,\nonline learners tend to communicate with their instructors\nmore to get help with a problem and less to take actual guid-\nance to facilitate their learning. As a result, the online envi-\nronment can become less guidance-oriented, which in turn\nmay be non-conducive to retention. Kirschner, Sweller, and\nthe free exploration of a highly complex environment may\ngenerate a heavy working memory load that is detrimental to\nlearning. This suggestion is particularly important in the case of\nnovice learners, who lack proper schemas to integrate the new\ninformation with their prior knowledge. (p. 80)\nOngoing research also lends support to the fact that cognitive\nload may be closely related to student satisfaction with online\ncourses. Bradford's (2011) research using his Factor\nCorrelation Matrix and the Principal Components Analysis\nindicates that there are significant connections between cog-\nnitive load and satisfaction and that \"approximately 25% of\nthe variance in student satisfaction with learning online can\nbe explained by cognitive load\" (p. 217).\nSocial and Family Factors\nThe reasons for high attrition rates in online classes could be\na combination of social factors, as well as the attitude, apti-\ntude, and motivational threshold of the students. Family\ncommitment and social obligations of the student could be\ncontributing factors in low retention. Evans (2009) discusses\nhow students indicate obligations to their families as a pri-\nmary and recurring reason for why they drop an online\ncourse. Other key studies in this field, for example, the works\nof Tinto and Summers, indicate the involvement of social\nfactors in retention, and although these authors discussed\nretention in traditional classrooms, some of the things they\npropounded may hold true for e-learning as well. For exam-\nple, Summers (2003) discussed the retention issues in rela-\ntion to community college students and observed that\nstudents who had value orientations that were different from\nthe norm were not able to interact socially with their peers.\nAs a result, such students felt incompatible with the institu-\ntion's social system and were more likely to drop out. Tinto\nfamily and society plays so that it helps institutions to create\nbetter and more effective support programs for students with\ndiverse situations and backgrounds.\nA turning point in the retention research came with Alfred\nRovai's (2003) discussion of the Composite Persistence\nmodel, which was designed to gauge factors affecting reten-\ntion for online students. This model discusses several factors\naffecting retention, both prior to admission and after, and\nincludes social integration and family responsibilities as\napplicable factors in the retention equation.\nMotivational Factors\nMotivational aspects can also cause high attrition rates in\nonline classes. Because online courses are heavily self-\ndirected and self-learned, motivation or lack thereof can be a\ndeciding factor in attrition. Erin Heyman (2010) indicates\nthat motivation and accountability are closely related to stu-\ndent retention in online programs. Motivation in online\ncourses can be directly linked to the overall course design, as\nwell as the students' own aptitude and attitude toward learn-\ning and technology. Studies reveal that several factors such as\nthe time needed to complete modules, lack of real world\nissues and contexts in course materials, and problems with\naccessibility and availability of resources and support sys-\ntems create motivational constraints (Smart & Cappell, 2006).\nTechnological Constraints and the Digital Natives\nPrensky (2001) refers to the term \"digital natives\" to describe\nlearners who may be familiar with popular technology but\nare not conformable with educational technology. Several\nstudies support this idea and indicate that student satisfaction\nrelated to the overall course design is a key concern and\ndeterminant in student retention. Weber and Farmer (2012)\nindicate that students consider satisfaction regarding course\ndelivery as a major cause of continuing or withdrawing in\nonline classes. Another issue relates to the technical exper-\ntise of the students in relation to the course design. Although\nthis generation of students may have technical knowledge\nrelating to social media and digital entertainment options\nsuch as video games, these skills may not be enough to be\nsuccessful in an online course. A key flaw when assessing\nstudent compatibilities with technology is crediting them\nwith more capabilities than they actually possess in relation\nto the online course materials. Overestimating the technol-\nogy readiness of online students is a mistake (Clark-Ibanez\n& Scott, 2008). Prensky's research leading to the coining of\nthe phrase \"digital natives\" to describe learners who live a\nhighly digitized life, surrounded by technology, is critical to\nunderstanding the important role this factor plays in e-learn-\ning attrition. A key reason for high attrition rates in online\ncourses is related to ineffective course designs that are cre-\nated based on assumptions about the online learner, which\nmay or may not be true. One such assumption is that if a\nstudent is \"tech savvy\" and is familiar with mobile and/or\nsocial media technology, he or she is a perfect fit for online\nlearning. Ng's (2012) study reveals key aspects of this issue\nand discusses it from a solution point of view, rather than just\narticulating the problem. Ng contends that the digital natives,\nwho can also be the online learners, prefer to be online for\neverything including accessing information, getting enter-\ntainment, and socializing. They prefer quick delivery and\nexchange of information, like to multi-task, and respond bet-\nter to graphics instead of text. The article examines the argu-\nment that although such learners can use technology, they do\nnot possess skills required to use them for learning. In\nessence, a large segment of today's online learners know\nhow to use technology and are familiar with the digital envi-\nronment; however, it does not necessarily mean that they are\nequally conversant with educational technology and e-learn-\ning environments as envisioned by institutions that offer\nonline courses and programs. The article describes educa-\ntional technology as the use of materials and processes to\nfacilitate teaching and learning. Such educational technolo-\ngies could be related to formal and/or informal learning, for\nexample, an online course or self-learning by surfing the\nInternet. Although almost all participants in the study were\nfamiliar and comfortable with sites such as Facebook and\nYouTube, they were far less conversant with the usage of\nteaching/learning technologies such as wikis, blogs, Google\nDocs, Movie Maker, and Photoshop, to name a few. Almost\nnone of them was familiar with widely used educational\ntechnologies such as Prezi or VoiceThread. They were also\nunfamiliar with concepts of ePortfolio or cloud computing\n(Ng, 2012). Therefore, it is quite possible that students of\nonline classes often experience computer-related issues,\nespecially at the beginning of the semester, and probably\nduring the course of the semester, if they choose to continue\nin the class. This causes many of them to drop the course\nwell before they get the opportunity to become comfortable\nin the courses' cyber zones and also after they have made it\nseveral weeks into the semester.\nLack of Instructor Understanding of Online\nLearners\nIt is not only the learners but also the instructors and course\ndesigners who face similar challenges relating to interaction\nin online classes. Many times, the individual perceptions of\n6 SAGE Open\nthe students and the teachers are dramatically different,\nresulting in overall poorly designed courses that are confus-\ning and dissatisfying for the learners. To do a good job of\ndesigning online courses, instructional designers need to\nunderstand how an online learner perceives things. Available\nliterature suggests that online instructors find it increasingly\nchallenging to maintain a cohesive learning atmosphere in\nthe class compared with face-to-face classes. Muirhead\n(2004) points out that online instructors feel challenged to\ncreate collaborative learning atmospheres that generate true\nand meaningful learning. Many times, this difference in per-\nception results in a certain amount of apathy on the instruc-\ntors' part to recognize student emotions and feelings.\nTallent-Runnels et al. (2006) indicate that research results\npoint to the need to create more student-compliant courses.\nFor example, instructors should be more cognizant of the\npsychological aspects of student reactions as revealed in the\nstudent responses to discussions. Knowing why students\nreact the way they do can provide an insight into modulating\ndiscussions and other collaborative avenues to make courses\nmore flexible and learner friendly.\nFaculty Limitations of Using Technology: The\nDigital Immigrant Issues\nPrensky (2001) refers to the term \"digital immigrants\" to\ndescribe instructors who are unable to keep up or understand\nthe language of the digital native community, stating that\n\"our Digital Immigrant instructors, who speak an outdated\nlanguage (that of the pre-digital age), are struggling to teach\na population that speaks an entirely new language\" (p. 2). Ng\n(2012) makes similar assertions when she points out that\neducators are responsible for raising awareness of educa-\ntional technologies in digital natives, so that they can be used\nto facilitate the digital natives'formal learning. This is exem-\nplified by comparing how children need to be introduced and\ntaught to speak languages or use appliances to facilitate their\ninformal learning. She further contends that digital natives\nare less likely to self-explore or look to use educational tech-\nnology, unless they are formally introduced to them.\nBased on the results of her study, Ng (2012) inferred the\nneed for educators to be aware of the benefits and possibili-\nties that various technological tools provide for teachers'\ntraining and students' learning. Digital natives, although\nfamiliar with technology and Internet, may have severe limi-\ntations in understanding how technology could support their\nlearning. Therefore, they need constant guidance from their\nteachers until they become familiar with the educational tech-\nnologies (Ng, 2012). However, this need for the technical\n\"savviness\" of educators is not being met, because the instruc-\ntors who are teaching online courses are not technically liter-\nate to the extent required. Prensky (2001) also points out those\ndigital immigrant instructors have incorrect assumptions that\ntoday's online learners are no different from what learners\nhave been in the past, and that the teaching methods that were\nsuccessful yesterday will be effective today. As a result, there\nis a marked dissatisfaction among online learners regarding\nthe lack of technical knowledge of their instructors. The new\ngeneration of e-learners is \"networked most or all of their\nlives\" and possesses \"little patience for lectures, step-by-step\nlogic, and `tell-test'instruction. Unfortunately, for our Digital\nImmigrant teachers, the people sitting in their classes grew\nup on the `twitch speed'of video games and MTV\" (Prensky,\nThe key contributing factor for this is the paucity of tech-\nnical resources and expertise available to online faculty and\ncourse designers. Liu, Gibby, Quiros, and Demps (2002)\nhighlight the challenges faculty face when trying to keep\npace with the ever emerging and rapidly evolving technolo-\ngies that are necessary to create effective online course\ndesigns. They point out that although instructional design\ncourses make students well conversant with the theoretical\naspects of the subject, they do not provide the expertise and\nknowledge required for practical applications of technolo-\ngies. Another key factor leading to ineffective online course\ndesigns is the level of confidence and comfort that the fac-\nulty have with respect to online classes and using technology\nin the classroom. The results of a case study by Osika,\nJohnson, and Buteau (2009) show that this could be due to a\ncombination of factors such as the faculty's belief that online\ncourses are not equal to face to face with respect to learning\nquality. Many faculty do not subscribe to the concept of\nonline course delivery as a full-time medium of instruction.\nA large number of faculty from the study group expressed\nconcern over the lack of support they receive from the insti-\ntution, indicating that this was a major factor that made\nonline courses unattractive to faculty. Young (2004) refers to\na national survey released in 2004 by the Educause Center\nforApplied Research that reveals that students were very dis-\nsatisfied with the way instructors used, or did not use, tech-\nnology. Young reports that students complained that\nsometimes professors perform poorly, because of technol-\nogy, indicating that such professors are better off when they\nuse the chalkboard.\nInstitution Limitations to Training Faculty\nOne of the prime reasons for lack of good faculty input in\nonline courses is the lack of drive of educational institutions\nto create good training programs for their faculty. The\nemphasis is more on developing and deploying online\ncourses rapidly to increase enrollment, rather than create a\nbody of well-trained faculty to boost retention. Young (2004)\npoints out that although colleges spend top dollars for adding\ntechnological components in classrooms, far fewer resources\nare devoted to train professors to use these technologies.\nAnother key reason that institutions and organizations should\nspend more time, money, and effort on training faculty is the\nchanging expectations for online courses and course designs\nthat involve the use of many different media and technologies\nto deliver course content. In their report, Liu et al. (2002)\ncompare the process of instructional designing today with a\nmovie production or conducting a symphony. The authors\ndiscuss how instructional designers like to use different\nmedia to create a harmonious blend of technology and learn-\ning to incite the attention of the students, just as movie direc-\ntors or symphony conductors do when they try to attract their\npatrons and viewers (Liu et al., 2002). The modern trends in\nthe changing attitudes and aptitudes in education technology\ncreate a need for better trained faculty. As the existing litera-\nture review indicates, several factors relating to online course\ndesign can cause high attrition rates in online classes.\nKeeping these factors in mind while designing online courses\nmay help regain and retain students.\nSome Solutions to Improve the Online\nCourse Experience\nMake Orientation Programs Mandatory\nOne of the biggest deterrents to online retention is the over-\nestimation of student capabilities with respect to the demands\nof time, commitment, and technological skills required in\nonline learning. One way to deal with this is through orienta-\ntion programs that introduce students to the rigors and unique\ndemands of the online classes. However, that in itself can be\na challenge. Studies conducted by Bozarth, Chapman, and\nLaMonica (2004) reveal the need for designers and facilita-\ntors to understand that students' own perceptions or miscon-\nceptions of their technological skills becomes the biggest\nchallenge as it makes students feel that an online orientation\nprogram is not required. As a result, many students show\nresistance to what they perceive as unnecessary intervention\nto their course penetration. Instead of feeling frustrated with\nthis attitude, instructors and institutions must think about\nstrategies that will enforce orientation, rather than make it\nobligatory. Instructors should also evaluate their own techno-\nlogical, communication, and facilitation skills and attempt to\nupdate them if necessary.\nUsing \"Live\" Interaction and Transparency in\nComputer Mediated Communication (CMC)\nAs indicated by the literature reviews above, social factors\nplay a significant part in determining student retention. There\nis already a preexisting prejudice against online courses\nrelating to the level of interaction between students and\nteachers. According to Roblyer and Ekhaml (2000), several\nstudies indicate that students and faculty alike have huge\ndoubts regarding the depth of interaction possible in an\nonline environment. This creates a serious discomfort in the\nminds of learners and educators when it comes to embracing\nonline delivery systems. Literature reviews also support that\nenhancing the social culture of an online class goes a long\nway in allowing students to continue with their e-learning\nand complete their education.\nDow (2008) provides insight as to how designing online\ncourses to foster effective dialogue, ease of the use of media\ntools, well-structured interactions, and transparency of CMC\nhelped create a better learning environment. Dow's study\nreveals that not having a \"live\" component in the interactions\nwas very detrimental to the online learning atmosphere. He\nlists several areas of concern in this regard such as the absence\nof live conversations, not having any visible identifiers such\nas photos of teachers and peers, and a general frustration\nabout the time gaps between communications. Students feel\nuncomfortable when they are unable to see the people they\nare conversing with, which in turn hinders how they may\ngauge the feelings of their peers online. Consequently, online\ncourses should be designed to foster more social interaction\nbetween peers and students-teachers.\nCreating Classes Structured for Collaborative\nLearning\nIn the study conducted by Dow (2008), participants indicated\nhow difficult it was to gauge social presence of their peers\nand instructors, in the absence of any cohesive working\nstructure and continued interactions. Another research con-\nducted by Moallem (2003) studied the impact of applying an\ninteractive design model for creating an online course that\nwas more structured for collaborative activities, and conse-\nquently more amenable to online learning. When applying\nthis model, emphasis was placed on collaborative problem-\nsolving tasks, individual accountability, encouraging com-\nmitment to group and its goals, facilitating communication\nbetween group members, and providing stability so that\ngroup members could work productively together for longer\nperiod. The results of Moallem's study indicated that having\ncohesive and structured tasks, as well as an intuitive design\nmodel, might influence positive interactivity and interaction\namong students in an online course. Muirhead (2004) recom-\nmends that instructors develop strategies that will enhance\ntheir guidance for the students, such as creating a timeline for\nfeedback and having a specific feedback rubric. This may\nmitigate the struggle instructors face when trying to establish\na meaningful presence in their online classes. This may also\nfacilitate the instructors' own discovery and experimenta-\ntions to develop strategies for a seamless collaboration with\nand between the students.\nEnhancing Faculty Training and Support\nLiterature supports the importance faculty training has in\nonline course design and overall retention. Kate (2009) dis-\ncusses the need to focus more on re-training professors who\nare taking a huge leap when shifting from face to face to an\nonline environment. Simply having `good teaching' as part of\nan institution's mission is not enough, unless it is comple-\nmented by having support infrastructures for the faculty. Only\nthen can an institution be able to provide effectuve online\ncourse delivery. Even when an institution claims excellence in\n8 SAGE Open\nteaching as its core value, it does not necessarily mean that\nthe institution has appropriate support structures for the\nteachers. Kate also highlights the importance of including\ndiscussions about training faculty whenever institutions dis-\ncuss educational excellence and quality. Levine and Sun\n(2002) highlight the connection between effective course\ndesign and faculty training when they discuss how faculty\ntraining and course deigning are connected, and how these in\nturn are critical to students. They show concern over the fact\nthat many times faculty do not receive formal training, which\nthey believe is required to create good learning environments\nin their online classes.\nThe literature reveals instances of unique and successful\nsolutions to faculty training and support. One such success\nstory is that of University of Illinois where administrators\ngave faculty a full semester off before teaching online\nclasses, so that faculty could use that time to train and pre-\npare for a smoother transition from face to face to an online\nenvironment (Kate, 2009). Another example is that of San\nJose State University, where a grant received was used to\ncreate a 2-week program that successfully trained instructors\nusing one on one training by professional instructional\ndesigners (Kate, 2009). As supported by research, it is pos-\nsible that faculty will perform better as far as online course\ndesign modification and teaching are concerned if some form\nof training takes place before a faculty teaches an online\ncourse for the first time. In a quantitative study, Julie Ray\n(2009) concluded that training instructors prior to their start-\ning to teach online courses resulted in better preparation for\nthe classes. Similarly, Ray refers to a study of pharmacy\ninstructors that showed how only 3 hr of training resulted in\na significant increase in instructors' perceived ability to\ninstruct online. Ray concluded that no matter what and how\nthe training is imparted, it always has a positive influence on\nthe instructor's ability to teach online.\nSynthesis of Literature Used\nThe article provided a synthesis of literature to analyze\nonline learning environments and learners with the intention\nof highlighting retention issues and recommending solu-\ntions. The high attrition rate in online courses is a cause for\nThis phenomenon needs to be studied in light of the growing\ndemand for online programs in academic and corporate set-\ntings, and the fact that a fall in attrition rates will benefit\nstudents, institutions, and businesses (Allen & Seaman,\nies have been conducted specifically to observe when and\nwhy students withdraw from graduate programs (Jaggars,\n2009). The results of these indicate that students were more\napt to drop out during earlier stages of the semester, and there\nare multiple reasons for doing this including personal prefer-\nences, profession-related, and program-related issues.\nLearning theories such as social exclusion, self-determina-\ntion, self-efficacy, cognitivism, constructivism, and connec-\ntivism can provide a deeper insight into the workings of\nonline learning environments, including leaners, instructors,\nSeveral critical factors lead to high attrition rates in online\nenvironments. One of them is the misconceptions learners\nhave about the workload, cognitive challenges, and general\nexpectations. Learners may select online classes for personal\nreasons, without recognizing that they may have issues with\ntheir entry-level skills pertaining to the subject or technology\nbeing used in online classes. This could place novice-level\nlearners, who are used to the structured forms of face-to-face\ncourses, in the fluid, ill-structured domains of online envi-\nronments, leading to demotivation and attrition (Bradford,\nFamily commitment and social obligations of students\ncould be contributing factors in low retention. In addition,\nstudents without the norm value orientations may be unable\nto interact socially with their peers. As a result, such students\nfelt incompatible with the institution's social system and\nself-oriented nature of online learning can create issues of\nmotivation, particularly for learners with technological skill\nlimitations. The assumptions of online course designers and\neducators about the technological compatibility of the digital\nnative learners can lead to issues with course designs. These\nfactors have been known to accelerate attrition rates (Clark-\nIn addition, the profiles, attitudes, and aptitudes of online\nfaculty could become issues for online learning environ-\nments. Research indicates that a large number of online fac-\nulty have a low level of understanding of the way online\nlearners learn. Many times, face-to-face faculty are invited to\nteach or design online courses, with minimal or zero expo-\nsure to the pedagogical aspects of online environments.\nConsequently, they may work under the erroneous assump-\ntion that what works for on-ground will work equally well\nfor online. Some of the challenges such faculty face are\ndeveloping and sustaining interactive and dynamic collab-\norative climates in their online classes, adjusting their own\ngaps in technology skills, and falling prey to their inherent\nprejudice against the perceived lack of value of online classes\nversus face to face ones. The paucity of training and profes-\nsional development opportunities compound the problems\nGiven the magnitude and depth of the issues, researchers\nhave looked for viable solutions. Rigorous orientation pro-\ngrams can help online learners become better prepared for\ntheir academic journeys online. Faculty should also evaluate\ntheir own technological, communication and facilitation\nskills and attempt to update them as and when needed so that\nthey can create a more transparent and collaborative online\nlearning environment within their classes and be effective\nguides of technology for their students. Institutions must find\nways to enhance faculty training for online teaching. Using\nsuch simple measures can greatly help contain attrition and\nincrease retention rates in online classes/programs (Bozarth\nImplications for Future Research\nAs a survey and review of literature reveals, the causes of\npoor retention in online courses are many, and although there\nhas been some headway in the area of providing viable solu-\ntions to this issue, much deeper and wider studies are required\nto develop a better understanding of ways and means to solve\nonline course issues and improve online classes and course\ndesigns to facilitate and benefit both learners and educators.\nThe most desired outcome of such research should be to help\nboost retention. At present, there are many emerging trends\nin the world of e-learning that presents different avenues for\nfuture research such as Rovai's (2003) Composite Persistence\nmodel or Bradford's (2011) concept of Factor Correlation\nMatrix and the Principal Components Analysis. However,\nmodels and concepts such as these need to be examined in\nthe light of more real world context using larger participant\ngroups. Faculty and institutional involvement, as well as the\nimportance of creating more interactive and better-designed\nonline course content in the retention equation, must also be\nstudied. This article is a small beginning toward a larger and\nbroader scaled research in this field.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAllen, E.
