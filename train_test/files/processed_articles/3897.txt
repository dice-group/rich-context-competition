Central to this field is the recognition that the occu-\npational structure is an important foundation for the main\ndimension of social stratification (Blau and Duncan, 1967:\n6\u00ad7). Within sociology, there is a long-standing recogni-\ntion that in industrialised societies, occupations are the\nmost powerful single indicator of levels of material\nreward, social standing and life chances (Parkin, 1971).\nThe occupational information that is routinely provided in\nlarge-scale social surveys is a key resource for studying\ncontemporary social life, and occupation-based indicators\nare central to sociological investigations.\nDespite the sociological consensus that occupations are\ncentral to understanding social stratification, there is no sin-\ngle obvious and agreed on way of measuring occupations.\nDebates have been exacerbated because of the complex\nnature of the occupational structure in contemporary labour\nmarkets. Within sociology, a wide range of measures have\nbeen advocated. These measures are often linked with main-\nstream sociological theories and concepts, most notably\nrelated to `social class'. This article is not orientated towards\nan evaluation of social class measures or other measures\nA Review of occupation-based social\nclassifications for social survey research\nRoxanne Connelly1, Vernon Gayle2 and Paul S.

Nor does this article docu-\nment the history or development of the measures. Rather, it\nis orientated towards the more prosaic, but usually over-\nlooked, practical aspects of using occupational information\ncollected via social surveys in sociological research.\nThe theorisation, measurement and operationalisation of\noccupation-based measures has received great attention in\nthe specialised field of social stratification research but has\nreceived far less attention in other areas of social science\ndespite the centrality of occupations for many empirical\nanalyses. It is our conjecture that appropriately measuring\noccupations and using occupational information in sociolog-\nical analyses requires thought and in-depth knowledge of\nthese measures. The aim of this article is to document issues\nassociated with utilising occupation-based social classifica-\ntions in social survey analyses and to provide some clear pre-\nscriptions for sociologists who are not experts in this field.\nWe begin with an outline of how to handle raw occupa-\ntional information. This is followed by an introduction to the\ntwo major approaches to measuring occupations and a third\nlesser known but intellectually innovative approach. The three\napproaches are social class schemes, social stratification scales\nand the microclass approach. In addition, occupation-based\nmeasures for international comparisons are briefly described\nbecause this area is seldom highlighted. We conclude with a\ndiscussion of the intersection of other key variables such as\nage and gender and discuss a range of issues related to the\ninclusion of these measures in sociological analyses.\nRationale for occupation-based social\nclassifications in social surveys\nThe most common justification for using occupation-based\nsocio-economic measures is that they make reliable, parsi-\nmonious indicators of the social positions of individuals\nification researchers, occupation-based socio-economic\nmeasures do not simply act as a proxy where income data\nthemselves are unavailable, they are measures designed to\nhelp us better understand fundamental forms of social rela-\ntions and inequalities to which income is merely epiphenom-\nenal (Rose and Pevalin, 2003: 39). Empirical inquiries using\nrepeated contacts data have convincingly shown that there is\na high degree of income churning from year to year which\nmakes income data unlikely to consistently represent indi-\nviduals'positions in industrial economies (Jarvis and Jenkins,\ntion-based socio-economic measures are more stable\nand, therefore, better describe lifetime earnings profiles\nHauser and Warren (1997) contend that the social sci-\nences have been suffering from a preoccupation with meas-\nures of income and poverty. This focus possibly stems from\nthe assumed utility of monetary measures for impact or `real-\nworld' relevance. The focus on income might also reflect the\nrelative disciplinary esteem of the field of economics within\nthe social sciences. Bourguignon (2006) and Goldthorpe\n(2012) both assert that it is possible that this economic focus\nmay have diverted some social scientists from major and\nconsequential dimensions of social inequality which are not\ncaptured by focusing purely on income.\nSome contemporary sociologists dispute the continued rel-\nevance of occupation-based social classifications. Against the\nbackdrop of a vast quantity of empirical results charting con-\ntinued class-based inequalities (e.g. Erikson et al., 1979;\nWright, 1997), a parallel stream of literature has claimed that\n`class as a concept is ceasing to do any useful work' (Pahl,\ngenerally argue that the lives and experiences of individuals in\nmodern society are too fluid and transient, and too influenced\nby the processes of globalisation, to fit neatly within-class cat-\negories. Pakulski and Waters' (1996) account of the `death of\nclass' centres on two main ideas. First, the class-based divi-\nsions peaked in industrial society and have been declining ever\nsince. Second, although there are inequalities in modern soci-\nety, these are not aligned with traditional social classes.\nThere are, however, a number of weaknesses in the `end\nof class'thesis. Goldthorpe and Marshall (1992) note that the\nconcept of class which is being attacked is a concept which\nis never clearly defined, is most aligned to the Marxist tradi-\ntion and differs greatly from the more recent sociological\nconcepts of social class that have been developed and\ndeployed in empirical studies. The more nuanced aspects of\nthe concept of social class are largely overlooked by those\nwho argue that class is dead, and social class is often repre-\nsented in a caricatured and simplistic manner (Goldthorpe\nconcerns in contemporary class analysis include the notion\nof changes in the influence of class, the declining importance\nof class and the intersectionality of other variables such as\ngender and ethnicity. We would add that a central theme in\ncontemporary class analysis is the study of the extent to\nwhich the influence of social class has decreased over time in\nrelation to major economic and social changes (e.g. Breen,\nWhile class analysts have researched these issues in some\ndepth, Goldthorpe and Marshall (1992) assert that sociolo-\ngists who claim that class is dead have provided little con-\nvincing evidence to support their arguments. Furthermore,\nthey have also noted that there has been no attempt to provide\nlongitudinal evidence of change in the nature or influence of\nclass to provide adequate support for the `death of class'argu-\nment. It is also notable that many theoretically oriented soci-\nologists, from very different standpoints, have continued to\ndescribe the importance and relevance of class in contempo-\nConnelly et al. 3\nSavage et al. (2013) recently proposed a new model of\nsocial class influenced by the writings of the French sociolo-\ngist Bourdieu.1 From this theoretical standpoint, occupa-\ntions are not the main indicators of social stratification\npositions. This work has led to an extensive amount of dis-\ncussion over the last year. The new models of class devel-\noped by Savage et al. (2013) are based on the concepts of\neconomic capital (e.g. income and wealth), cultural capital\n(e.g. engagement with cultural goods and activities) and\nsocial capital (e.g. social contacts and networks; see\nBourdieu, 1984). These concepts are measured using indica-\ntors such as household income, savings, property value, the\nnumber of social contacts held and the occupations of these\nsocial contacts, engagement with `highbrow culture' (e.g.\nvisiting museums or listening to classical music) and\nengagement with `emerging cultural capital'. Emerging cul-\ntural capital describes activities once considered `lowbrow\nculture' but that may now be more ubiquitous. Examples\nmight include using social networking websites, going to a\ngym or online gaming.\nRather than theorising occupations as the main basis of\nthe opportunity structure, Bourdieu (1984) argues that the\nthree capitals can be used to better explain the processes of\nsocial reproduction. Based on this theory, Savage et al.\n(2013) contend that by measuring individuals' levels of\nthese capitals, a far more informative social class scheme\ncan be developed than the traditional occupation-based\nmeasures that are widely used. Payne (2013) has noted that\nthe seven `new' classes proposed by Savage et al. (2013)\nare very similar to the established UK National Statistics\nSocio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC) categories but\nwith the added distinction of an `elite' category. Therefore,\nthis new scheme does not represent a revolutionary re-\nworking of the established social class categories. The\nmeasure proposed by Savage et al. (2013) has been exten-\nsively critiqued (Bradley, 2014; Lambert and Griffiths,\noffered by the `end of class' theorists, and the direction pro-\nposed by Savage et al. (2013), there is no strong empirical\nevidence that dissuades us of the extremely high value of\nusing existing occupation-based measures in the secondary\nanalysis of large-scale social surveys.\nStandardised occupational\nclassifications\nModern industrial economies are characterised by a wide\nrange of occupations, each of which contain numerous dif-\nferent jobs. Collecting job-related information (e.g. job titles)\nis routinely the first step in collecting occupational informa-\ntion within social surveys. The next step is usually marshal-\nling this information into a recognised occupational scheme.\nThe raw occupational information in large-scale micro-\nlevel social surveys is usually coded into a standardised\noccupational unit group scheme. In the United Kingdom, it is\ncommon for social survey data to be coded into the Office for\nNational Statistics (2010) Standardised Occupational\nClassification, which are known as SOC codes. Some sur-\nveys are coded into the International Labour Organisation's\nInternational Standard Classification of Occupations, which\nare known as ISCO codes (see Ganzeboom, 2010). This\ninformation is often augmented with additional employment\ndata such as employment status (e.g. self-employed or super-\nvisory). Occupational unit group codes are produced by\nmatching original textual occupational descriptions (e.g.\nfrom survey question responses) with a standardised list of\noccupations. We consider that it is extremely important that\ndata collectors maintain occupational data in the form of an\nestablished protocol (e.g. using SOC codes). Coding raw\noccupational data (e.g. textual descriptions) directly into\nsocio-economic measures is highly unsatisfactory because it\nwill result in the loss of valuable detailed occupational infor-\nmation. As Lambert (2002) demonstrates, without the use of\nan established protocol for coding raw occupational informa-\ntion (e.g. using SOC codes), it is later impossible to test for\ncomparability between both current and future occupation-\nbased measures.\nTranslating raw survey data into unit group codes can\nbe a time-consuming exercise, but the burden is greatly\nreduced through the use of computer-assisted and computer-\nautomated coding procedures (Elias et al., 1993). The\nComputer-Aided Structured Coding Tool2 (CASCOT) is an\nonline resource for the quick and reliable coding of occupa-\ntional descriptions, which was developed by the Institute of\nEmployment Research at the University of Warwick (Jones,\n2004). The CASCOT programme compares the text in the\ndescription of an occupation with the text in standardised\ndescriptors for occupational classifications. The software\nthen presents a list of recommended matches. CASCOT also\nprovides a score for the matches indicating the degree of cer-\ntainty that the given occupational code is correct. The Office\nfor National Statistics also publish an open-access online\ncoding tool3 that operates in a similar manner, and these and\nother coding software are available as offline packages suit-\nable for bulk-processing large volumes of data.\nSchemes of unit group codes are updated periodically, and\nthe current nationally specific UK scheme is SOC2010.4\nAnother example of a standardised occupational code is the\nISCO5 (International Labour Organization, 2010). ISCO is\nalso widely used in both cross-national and nationally spe-\ncific survey datasets (Bergman and Joye, 2005). ISCO repre-\nsents an important effort to develop internationally\ncomparable occupational codes, which facilitate cross-\nnational comparisons in social surveys (Elias, 1997). In\nmany countries, `cross-walks' are available that enable val-\nues of the national standardised occupational unit group\nscheme (e.g. SOC2010) to be translated into ISCO.6 These\ncross-walks are usually written by researchers and/or national\nstatistics agencies.\n4 Methodological Innovations\nOccupation-based social classifications\nOrganising occupational information into standardised\noccupational codes is only the first stage in the process.\nSecondary data analysts will generally not need to engage\nwith this stage of the process when they are using existing\nsurvey resources that are well curated.The British Household\nPanel Survey is a prime example of a large-scale social sur-\nvey with well-curated occupational data that are readily\navailable for secondary data analysis (Taylor et al., 2010).\nThe second stage in the process of developing occupation-\nbased social classifications is to convert these data from\nstandardised lists of occupational unit groups (e.g. SOC\ncodes) into the required socio-economic measure.\nThe means to convert unit group codes and employment\nstatus data into occupation-based measures is typically sup-\nplied in a listing of occupational unit groups alongside the cor-\nresponding levels of an occupation-based measure. This may\ntake the form of a table, textual description, statistical software\ncommand file or a matrix of data for matching (see Lambert\nand Bihagen, 2012, for a more extended description). In order\nto carry out these operations, the researcher will usually\nrequire some skills in the use of statistical software for data\nLambert and Bihagen (2014) report that there has been a\ngreat deal of inconsistency in how researchers have organ-\nised occupational information into occupation-based social\nclassifications. For instance, they claim that upwards of a\nthousand different measures based upon occupations have\nbeen used in contemporary social science.7 It is unsurprising\nthat this surfeit of measures may initially seem daunting for\nresearchers, especially those who are not social stratification\nspecialists. It is notable that many social classifications\nemerge from very different sociological theories, which\ninfluence both their conceptual and empirical foundations.\nIt is well observed that in many secondary analyses of\nlarge and complex social surveys, the analysts tend to select\na single occupation-based measure. The choice of measure\nmight be made as a result of theoretical fiat, or due to more\npractical operational issues, or even a mixture of both. Our\nmethodological advice is that researchers should utilise\nexisting measurement options whenever possible and should\navoid producing their own measures or using existing meas-\nures in an ad hoc manner, unless they have very strong and\nclearly justified reasons. Social survey methodologists have\nmade this point on several previous occasions (Bechhofer,\nBechhofer (1969) states, `researchers are advised not to add\nto the already existing plethora of classifications without\nOur advice is based on the following premises. First, the\nfield of stratification research is highly specialised, and a\ngreat deal of theoretical thought and empirical testing has\nbeen directed towards the development of occupation-based\nmeasures. Therefore, it is probable that a measure suitable\nfor most analyses already exists. Second, the adoption of an\nexisting measure is almost always more time efficient.\nThird, and most importantly in our view, existing measures\nhave agreed and documented standards and, therefore, facil-\nitate replication. As Lambert and Bihagen (2012) assert, this\nlocates firmly within the culture of cumulative social scien-\ntific endeavour.\nSocial class schemes\nSocial class schemes are very widely used in sociological\nresearch and can generally be regarded as socio-economic\nmeasures that divide the population into unequally rewarded\nnot necessarily hierarchical, although an ordinal structure is\nplethora of social class schemes, and these measures are\noften informed by different theoretical standpoints (see\ngroups of social class measures which could be classified as\nbeing Marxist,8 Weberian or Durkhiemian in their approach.\nAs we have described above, more recently, the measure pro-\nposed by Savage et al. (2013) has its genesis in the theoreti-\ncal work of Bourdieu. However, Marxist and Bourdieusian\nsocio-economic measures are not usually readily derived\nfrom occupational information alone and do not ordinarily\nfeature in social survey datasets.\nMany of the earliest published social class schemes\nfocussed on differences in the skill levels of occupations and\ndefined social categories in those terms. Skill categories\nwere sometimes calculated based on typical qualification\nrequirements, but their identification was also often associ-\nated with evaluations of the relative prestige or social stand-\ning of the occupation. A prominent example is the United\nKingdom's long-standing `Registrar General's Social\nClassification'9 (e.g. Szreter, 1984). There is evidence that\nskill-based measures are empirically very powerful, and they\nremain a popular choice in social research (see Elias and\nThe work of Goldthorpe has arguably generated the most\ninfluential occupation-based social classification in sociol-\nogy and allied disciplines (Evans, 1992) \u00ad the Erikson\u00ad\nGoldthorpe\u00adPortocarero (EGP) schema (see Erikson et al.,\n1979). The theoretical principles of the EGP approach led to\nthe development of subsequent cognate schemes, including\nCASMIN (Erikson and Goldthorpe, 1992), the United\nKingdom's NS-SEC (Rose et al., 2005; Rose and Pevalin,\n2003) and the European Socio-Economic Classification\n(Rose and Harrison, 2007). In this tradition, employment\nrelations in the labour market are held to be of key impor-\ntance to the allocation of individuals into social class catego-\nwithin a social class are considered to share similar `market\nsituation' (e.g. levels of income, economic security and\nchances for economic advancement) and `work situation'\nConnelly et al. 5\n(e.g. authority and control; Goldthorpe, 1980; Lockwood,\n1958). Accordingly, those individuals within a social class\nare thought to hold similar life chances and often lifestyles.\nIn its least aggregated form, the EGP schema identifies 11\nclasses, although a 7-class version is widely used in empiri-\ncal analyses (see Table 1). Erikson and Goldthorpe (1992)\nrecommend that researchers move between the seven-, five-\nand three-class versions based on the need to balance explan-\natory comprehensiveness with explanatory parsimony. They\nstate that the schema could be extended to include more\nclasses if there was good reason to do so (Erikson and\nschema is consistent with the claim that the measure is an\ninstrument du travail rather than a definitive representation\nof social class groupings in the United Kingdom (Erikson\nIn 1994, the UK Office for National Statistics commis-\nsioned the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)\nto facilitate a review of social classifications. As a result of\nthis review, the EGP approach was adopted as the basis of a\nnew government measure of social class (Rose, 1995; Rose\nNS-SEC was developed, and since 2001, this occupation-\nbased measure, described in Table 2, has been used in official\nstatistics and government research in the United Kingdom\n(Office for National Statistics, 2010). In congruence with the\nEGP approach, the NS-SEC approach comprises of aggre-\ngate groupings of individuals who are considered to share\nsimilar life chances and lifestyles as a consequence of their\nemployment relations. Similarly, various reduced versions of\nthe schema are recommended (see Table 2).\nIn a recent and related exercise, a `European Socio-\neconomic Classification' (ESeC) has been developed\na social class schema, based on the EGP model, which is\ndesigned to facilitate cross-nationally comparative research.\nESeC10 comprises a nine-class categorical measure, with rec-\nommended reduced versions of five or three classes, which\ncan be readily operationalised from data coded into the three-\ndigit version of the ISCO occupational unit group scheme.\nThe `ESeC' scheme is specifically designed for international\nresearch, although other UK-oriented versions of the EGP\nscheme have also been exploited in cross-nationally com-\nparative studies (e.g. Blossfeld and Hofmeister, 2005; Breen,\nThe EGP social class schema and its derivatives are\nwidely used in British sociology, and several studies have\nprovided evidence of acceptable construct11 and criterion12\nvalidity for this measure (e.g. Evans, 1992; Evans and Mills,\nalso been evaluated critically. Questions have been asked\nabout the degree of within-class homogeneity in social class\ncategories, and concerns have been raised that individuals\nplaced within the same social class can hold very different\npositions within social hierarchies (Bergman and Joye, 2005;\nthat the EGP schema's categories downplay the key element\nof hierarchy in social stratification. Finally, measures from\nthe EGP schema have a relatively high number of categories,\nso it is sometimes suggested that they are not well suited to\nincorporation in multivariate statistical analyses (e.g. regres-\nsion models) because having a large number of categories\ninhibits the estimation of interaction effects. A consequence\nis that this limitation might encourage researchers, de facto,\ninto the less desirable practice of simplifying the measure\ninto a more coarse-grained format.\nSocial stratification scales\nHaving introduced categorical social class schemes, we now\nturn our attention to occupation-based scales. The principal\ndifference between categorical social class schemes and\nstratification scales is that rather than placing individuals\ninto qualitatively distinct categories, social stratification\nscales place individuals at some point on a continuous or gra-\ndational one-dimensional hierarchy (Bergman and Joye,\n2005). The dimension captured by occupation-based scales\ncan usually be described as a representation of `relative\nsocial advantage' (Jonsson et al., 2009). In some traditions,\nall occupation-based scales are referred to as `status' scales,\nbut this terminology is ambiguous, since in some interpreta-\ntions, `status' refers to a very specific form of social inequal-\nity (Chan and Goldthorpe, 2007). Scaling approaches also,\ntechnically, accommodate measurements that assign scores\nto occupations in more than one dimension (e.g. Levine and\nSpadaro, 1988), but in practice, scales are only regularly\nused in a single dimensional framework in applied research.\nA notable example of a social stratification scale is the\nCambridge Social Interaction and Stratification Scale\nempirically constructed scale that is based on the theoreti-\ncal idea that there is a stratification order derived from a\nhierarchical structure of advantage (and disadvantage) aris-\ning from the unequal distribution of social, cultural and\neconomic resources. In the CAMSIS approach, individuals\nare embedded in social networks of relationships within\nwhich they engage in social, cultural, political and eco-\nnomic interactions. These social interactions are circum-\nscribed by the social distance of these social actors. The\nidea of the centrality of `social space' is not unique to the\nCAMSIS approach and has a long history in the sociologi-\nproject that constructed occupation-based scales by analys-\ning social interaction patterns using a very similar approach\nto the CAMSIS perspective.\nThe CAMSIS approach is based on examining patterns of\nsocial interaction between occupations that are uncovered by\nexamining the frequency of links between people in different\noccupations. These links are typically defined either by\n6 Methodological Innovations\nFull version Collapsed versions\nSeven-class version Five-class version Three-class version\nI Higher grade professionals, administrators\nand officials; managers in large industrial\nestablishments; large proprietors\nI+II Service class: professionals,\nadministrators and managers; higher\ngrade technicians; supervisors of non-\nmanual workers\nI\u00adIII White-collar\nworkers\nI\u00adIII+IVa+b Non-manual\nworkers\nII Lower grade professionals, administrators\nand officials; higher grade technicians;\nmanagers in small industrial establishments;\nsupervisors of non-manual employees\nIIIa Routine non-manual employees, higher\ngrade (administration and commerce)\nIII Routine non-manual workers: routine\nnon-manual employees in administration\nand commerce; sales personnel; other\nrank-and-file service workers\nIIIb Routine non-manual employees, lower\ngrade (sales and services)\nIVa Small proprietors, artisans and so on, with\nemployees\nIVa+b Petty bourgeoisie: small properties and\nartisans and so on, with and without\nemployees\nIVa+b Petty bourgeoisie\nIVb Small proprietors, artisans and so on,\nwithout employees\nIVc Farmers and small holders; other self-\nemployed workers in primary production\nIVc Farmers: farmers and small holders and\nother self-employed workers in primary\nproduction\nIVc+VIIb Farm workers IVc+VIIb Farm\nworkers\nV Lower grade technicians; supervisors of\nmanual workers\nV+VI Skilled workers: lower grade technicians;\nsupervisors of manual workers, skilled\nmanual workers\nV+VI Skilled workers V+VI+VIIa Manual\nworkers\nVI Skilled manual workers\nVIIa Semi-skilled and unskilled manual workers\n(not in agriculture etc.)\nVIIa Non-skilled workers: semi- and unskilled\nmanual workers (not in agriculture etc.)\nVIIa Non-skilled\nworkers\nVIIb Agricultural workers and other workers in\nprimary production\nVIIb Agricultural labourers: agricultural and\nother workers in primary production\n\nConnelly et al. 7\nfriendship or by marriage or cohabitation. CAMSIS scales\nare formed using statistical analysis of `dimensions' within\napproach, country- and time-specific scales are usually cal-\nculated, and different CAMSIS scales can also be generated\nfor men and women and could also be generated for other\nimportant socio-demographic differences if desired (e.g. eth-\nnic groups or geographical regions). Lambert et al. (2008)\nconclude that this quality of `specificity' has attractive prop-\nerties for a wide range of analyses where more detailed reso-\nlution might be illuminating.\nTwo other important stratification scales are the Standard\nInternational Occupational Prestige Scale (SIOPS; see\nSocio-Economic Index (ISEI; Ganzeboom et al., 1992).\nSIOPS is devised by taking survey information on prestige\nratings given by respondents to samples of jobs and calculat-\ning averages within and across societies (Treiman, 1977).\nTreiman's original analysis compared ratings from over 60\nsocieties and drew the important conclusion that variation\nfrom society to society, and across time, in the prestige allo-\ncated to occupations was minimal. This axiom is often\nreferred to as the `Treiman constant' within stratification\nbased on analyses which focus on the cognitive issues\ninvolved when asking individuals to rank occupations.\nof distinctions people might draw between occupations.\nThey experimented with tasks such as asking respondents to\nsort occupations into groups and asking the respondents to\ndescribe the criteria by which occupations could be ordered.\nThey argue that these evaluative tasks should have preceded\nTreiman's protocol to rank the occupations by prestige, in\norder to ensure the respondents had a clear basis by which to\nrank the occupations (Coxon and Jones, 1978). Coxon and\nranking of occupations can vary between individuals and\ngroups which may be overlooked when producing average\nrankings or scales. For example, individual's exhibit a pat-\ntern of `occupational egoism' whereby they give more\nfavourable ratings to their own occupations and occupations\nsimilar to their own (Coxon and Jones, 1978).\nThe SIOPS provides a hierarchical ranking from the least to\nthe most esteemed occupations according to average ratings,\nand scores are shown to correlate strongly with the socio-eco-\nnomic circumstances of individuals who hold these occupa-\ntions. The ISEI by contrast calculates scores for occupations\nbased on their average profiles in terms of the income and edu-\ncational qualifications held by their incumbents (with some\nadjustment for age profiles). Further examples of social stratifi-\ncation scales include scales based only on the average income\nof occupations (e.g. Sobek, 1995), career prospects in terms of\naverage wage growth (e.g. Bihagen and Ohls, 2004) or job\nBecause they are continuous measures, all of the occupa-\ntion-based social stratification scales lead to numeric values\nbeing attached to occupations, but the relative importance of\na specific value is only meaningful in comparison with other\noccupations on the same scale. For example, the CAMSIS\nscales are usually standardised to a mean of 50 and a stand-\nard deviation of 15 in each version, but the SIOPS and ISEI\nmeasures are scaled in terms of their original measurement,\nand they typically have a mean of around 40, and a standard\ndeviation of about 14, in a nationally representative sample.\nCAMSIS scales tend to be specific to particular societies,\nwhereas ISEI and SIOPS are designed to be `universal' (i.e.\nthe same scores are applicable to the same occupations across\ndifferent societies). However, socio-economic index and\nprestige scales can also be calculated `specifically' within a\nsociety, and a `universal' version of the CAMSIS scale is\nTable 2.

In many cir-\ncumstances, this parsimony offers a major improvement\nover the inclusion of a categorical social class schema. In\nstatistical analyses where the socio-economic measure may\ninteract with other explanatory variables included in the\nanalysis, the parsimony that emerges from using a scale is\nfurther emphasised.\nAnother important attraction of using stratification scales\nas occupation-based measures is that their numerical func-\ntional form lends them to arithmetic standardisation strate-\ngies that may aid comparative evaluations of social change.\nFor instance, in some analyses in stratification research, it is\ncommon practice to apply mean-standardisation to scale\nscores within the country or year of a particular dataset.\nSubsequent results such as association statistics are expressed\nin terms of their relative influence in each context. It is well\nknown in stratification research that similar comparisons are\nmuch harder to conduct when categorical occupation-based\nmeasures are used. This is because there are often substantial\nchanges in the distribution of cases to occupation-based cat-\negories over time or between countries.\n`Microclass' approaches\nGrusky and colleagues have provided a critique of traditional\nsocial class schemes which has led to their development of\nthe `microclass' approach (Grusky and S\u00f8rensen, 2001,\nsuggests that the categorical approach of class schemes is\ndesirable but that there are many other important divisions\nthan are conventionally demarked in `big class' approaches\nsuch as the EGP schema. `Big class' schemas generally fea-\nture a modest number of social class categories (e.g. nine in\nEGP). These `big classes' contain a large number of occupa-\ntions, for example, there are 88 occupations measured by\nsemi-routine occupations category (NS-SEC 6) of the UK\nNS-SEC. By contrast, the microclass approach defines a\nmuch larger number of classes based on institutionalised\noccupational divisions. Microclass approaches typically fea-\nture around 80\u00ad100 different classes. Grusky and S\u00f8rensen\n(1998) contend that traditional social class schemes fail to\nrepresent detailed social structures within big classes and\nthat the social structure is not adequately represented by uni-\ndimensional hierarchical scales.\nDetails of the microclass scheme can be found in\nGrusky and S\u00f8rensen (2001). Theoretically, microclasses are\ndefined by the social and/or technical institutionalisation of\noccupations (e.g. plumber, baker and doctor) rather than agglom-\nerate classes (e.g. skilled manual workers or professionals). In\npractice, however, the empirical operationalisation of micro-\nclasses usually results in some groups being more homo-\ngeneous and more clearly institutionalised than others.\nNevertheless, a major attraction of the microclass approach is\nthat it facilitates the investigation of potentially important\nsubstantive differences at the detailed occupational level that\nmay be hidden within the large categories of `big'social class\nschemes.\nThe microclass approach is still comparatively new, but it\nhas been successfully employed to study both social mobil-\nity and educational inequalities (Gayle and Lambert, 2011;\nJonsson et al., 2009). Despite the appeal of the microclass\napproach, it has been subject to theoretical critiques (see\ndisaggregation of categories mean that patterns linked to\nmicroclasses cannot be clearly interpreted within the theo-\nretical framework that is useful to a `big class' measure. At\na practical level, the inclusion of a large multiple category\nexplanatory variable tends to decrease parsimony in stand-\nard statistical models. In addition, to ensure adequate statis-\ntical power when working with survey data covering the\nlarge number of microclass categories, large sample sizes\nare required. We have stated above that compared with cat-\negorical measures, scales better facilitate analyses that\ninclude interaction effects, and we, therefore, note that this\nissue will be amplified with a categorical variable with a\nlarge number of categories.\nSelecting an appropriate\nsocio-economic measure\nWith so many different socio-economic measures available,\nselecting an appropriate measure may at first appear to be a\ndaunting task, especially for researchers who are not social\nstratification specialists. We argue that a sensible and defen-\nsible solution is to proceed by selecting several different\noperationalisations of the measures. We stress that operation-\nalising an occupation-based measure is not necessarily a\nsimple case of selecting one superlative measure.15 Therefore,\na good solution is to construct a number of measures and\nevaluate them through a `sensitivity analysis'.\nWe use the term `sensitivity analysis' to describe the pro-\ncess of investigating the influence which small alterations to\na statistical analysis, for example, the use of different opera-\ntionalisations of an explanatory variable in a statistical\nmodel, have on substantive results. In most circumstances, a\nnew sensitivity analysis is probably required for each new\nanalysis. This is because the particular features of an occupa-\ntion-based measure are likely to be varied in different analy-\nses and, more importantly, cannot be predicted a priori. The\nprocess of conducting a sensitivity analysis can seem bur-\ndensome and even uninspiring; however, modern software\ncapabilities mean that at least in principle it is now quite easy\nto re-run analyses using different candidate measures. We\ncontend that undertaking sensitivity analyses is of\nConnelly et al. 9\nconsiderable benefit to social science more generally as it\nincreases rigour and, therefore, adds confidence to results. In\nthe same way, as good analysts put effort into comparing the\nresults of different forms of statistical analysis, similar effort\nshould be put into comparisons of measures based on alter-\nnative key social science variables.\nSocio-economic classifications and\nrelationships with demographic\nstructures\nAn important consideration when analysing occupation-\nbased socio-economic measures is their relationship with\nother key social science variables (e.g. age, gender and time\nperiod). In many analyses, occupation-based measures will\nshow moderate correlations with other key variables. In\nsome extreme cases, if this is ignored, there is a danger that\nthis may result in misleading interpretations (Lambert\nthis issue focussing on time periods, countries and gender.\nThey concluded that while temporal changes in the mean-\ning of occupations are slight, gender differences in occupa-\ntional distributions are so entrenched that they should be\nconsidered fundamental to the evaluation of occupation-\nbased measures (see also Gabriel and Schmitz, 2007;\nThe role of age differences in occupational classifica-\ntions has received far less consideration than the effects of\ngender. However, several recently advocated occupation-\nbased measures are known to have strong associations with\nage (see Kunst and Roskam, 2010). Multidimensional meas-\nures of stratification, for example the approach recently\ndeveloped using data from the Great British Class Survey\n(Savage et al., 2013), also appear to be strongly linked to\nage differences.\nA suitable analytical response may be to include meas-\nures of age and gender as control variables within analysis,\nalso investigating possible interaction effects between the\nage and gender measures and the occupational classifica-\ntion. In practice, these controls may reduce the parsimony\nof the model or introduce further challenges to interpreta-\ntion, so researchers may have to make a careful judgement\non the best way to address correlations between occupa-\ntion-based classifications and age or gender (or other com-\nparable factors).\nAn alternative approach to providing increased con-\ntrol for these relationships is to use occupation-based\nmeasures that have been derived for specific groups.\nExamples of such measures include the gender-specific\nCAMSIS scales or the social class scheme for women's\njobs recommended by Martin and Roberts (1984). With\nregard to age patterns, the concept of occupational matu-\nrity is also important. An argument expressed by\nGoldthorpe et al. (1987) is that most adults reach a point\nof `occupational maturity', around about the age of 35,\nafter which it is relatively unlikely they will experience\nmajor changes in their occupational position (p. 51).\nAnalyses, particularly in the area of social mobility for\nexample, have often been restricted to samples of adults\nover this age (see Erikson and Goldthorpe, 1992). More\nrecently, Tampubolon and Savage (2012) have suggested\nthat the appropriate age of occupational maturity may\nhave risen slightly over time. Secondary survey data ana-\nlysts using occupation-based socio-economic classifica-\ntions should be cognisant of the concept of occupational\nmaturity and consider adjusting their analyses whenever\nit is required.\nA further issue when using occupation-based meas-\nures relates to how they can be used to represent house-\nholds rather than individuals. This has been expressed in\nstratification research as a debate between `individual',\n`dominance' and `conventional' approaches to social\nclassification (e.g. Erikson, 1984). The individual\napproach uses the individual's current or last occupation.\nThe `dominance' approach measures all jobs in the\nhousehold and typically assigns a measure based on the\neconomically dominant occupation within the house-\nhold. This is usually the occupation which contributes\nthe most to household circumstances and is generally the\none with the longest hours of work. The `conventional'\napproach assigns a position on the basis of the occupa-\ntion of the `conventional head of the household'. This is\nmost commonly the oldest employed male living within\nthe household.\nAnother alternative is simply to incorporate the neces-\nsary individual variables that relate to occupational charac-\nteristics within the household. For example within a\nstatistical model of a child's educational attainment, infor-\nmation on both their mother's and their father's occupation\nmight be included. In practice, in some analyses, such meas-\nures may be highly correlated, and suitable thought must,\ntherefore, be put into the precise interpretation of these\neffects. We advocate that secondary analysts of survey\ndatasets should explore alternative model formulations,\nthoughtfully consider their effects and then suitably docu-\nment alternative results.\nFinally, an enduring problem when using occupational\nmeasures is the complexity of making comparisons over\ntime when the underlying structure of the labour market has\nchanged. In some secondary analyses of large-scale social\nsurveys where occupation-based measures are included as\nexplanatory variables, this will not be an issue due to\nthe restricted time frame of the analysis. In more special-\nised analyses, for example, in research on inter- and\nintra-generational mobility, more thought will be required\nregarding structural changes in the labour market. We sug-\ngest that in such analyses, specialist statistical approaches\nthat are directed towards providing increased control to\nhelp to combat this problem should be considered (see\nespecially Erikson and Goldthorpe, 1992).\n10 Methodological Innovations\nConclusion\nWe began this article by stating that despite occupations being\ncentral to a broad portfolio of substantive social science\nresearch questions, there is no single agreed on way of meas-\nuring occupations. An aim of this article has been to improve\nthe awareness that there are a number of varied occupation-\nbased measures which can be used in social research. We\nhave highlighted that there are a series of issues which require\nthought when including occupation-based measures in any\nsubstantive analysis. Most importantly, we strongly advise\nresearchers not to develop their own measures without strong\njustification or to use existing measures in an un-prescribed\nor ad hoc manner. Our clear recommendation is that research-\ners should always use existing occupation-based measures\nthat have agreed on and well-documented standards.\nWe are careful to emphasise that we are not advocating\nthe uncritical adoption of any one particular socio-economic\nmeasure over and above other alternatives. Rather, we are\nadvocating that researchers chose from the portfolio of exist-\ning socio-economic measures in an informed and empirically\ndefensible way. As Lambert and Bihagen (2014) conclude,\nmeasures are often selected on theoretical grounds, which\nrest on the claim that a given measure captures a specific\naspect of the occupational structure. Recent empirical\nendeavours which have attempted to provide sensitivity\nanalyses indicate that the theoretical orientations usually\nascribed to specific occupation-based measures do not nec-\nessarily exert appreciable influence on substantive results\nWe conclude that rather than adopting a particular socio-\neconomic measure on theoretical grounds, the secondary\ndata analyst should focus more attention on the analytical\nbenefits of competing measures. These considerations should\ninclude operational issues such as the specific form of the\nsocio-economic measures, how to best maximise model par-\nsimony, how to effectively specify models with suitable\nadditional key variables and where appropriate how best to\ninclude relevant interaction effects.\nWe advocate that secondary data analysts evaluate the\nwidest possible number of socio-economic measures and\nmake the results of these explorations available in the form\nof a `sensitivity analysis', for example, in a data appendix.\nIn many well-curated large-scale surveys, a number of alter-\nnative measures will be deposited with the data. Therefore,\nsensitivity analyses can easily be undertaken. In datasets\nwhere alternative measures are not readily available, we\nadvocate that secondary data analysts place effort into con-\nstructing as many alternative measures as possible using\ndetailed standardised occupational unit group codes. The\nsecondary data analyst must always be cautious not to use\noccupation-based socio-economic measures in an ad hoc\nmanner. An obvious example of this is combining categories\nof a social class measure in an unstandardised or un-\nprescribed manner. We hope that this article provides succinct\ninformation on the foundations of existing occupation-based\nmeasures. In addition, we have attempted to provide practi-\ncal advice that will make a positive contribution to how\nexisting socio-economic measures can be better incorpo-\nrated into social science analyses.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n 1.

It has been argued that occupation-based social classifications\nmeasure different aspects of social stratification dependent\non their conceptual basis (see Bukodi et al., 2011; Chan and\nRose and Harrison, 2010). If this is the case, a sensitivity anal-\nysis will provide an indication of the robustness of social sur-\nvey analyses across different occupation-based measures. In\nrecent work, Lambert and Bihagen (2014) have demonstrated\nthat, generally, occupation-based social classifications are\nhighly correlated regardless of their theoretical or conceptual\nbasis.\nReferences\nAtkinson W and Rosenlund L (2014) Mapping the British social\nspace: Towards a Bourdieusian class scheme (working paper).\nBristol: University of Bristol.\nBechhofer F (1969) Occupations.
