There is\nalso concern that diabetes may be occurring at a greater frequency in youth and\nin young adults. We describe US population trends in self-reported age at diagno-\nsis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nMETHODS We undertook a secondary analysis of data from the National Health\n1994). Both surveys are stratified, multistage probability samples targeting the\ncivilian, noninstitutionalized US population, which allow calculation of popula-\ntion estimates. We included adults aged 20 years and older. We compared self-\nreported age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes between the 2 survey periods.\nCONCLUSIONS The age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus has decreased\nwith time. This finding likely represents a combination of changing diagnostic cri-\nteria, improved physician recognition of diabetes, and increased public awareness.\nYounger age at diagnosis may also reflect a true population trend of earlier onset\nof type 2 diabetes.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe prevalence of diagnosed diabetes in the United States is increas-\ning, coincident with increases in the prevalence of obesity and\nsedentary lifestyle.1-3 Among adults in the United States, population\nestimates of the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes increased from 3.4% in\nof diagnosed diabetes for racial and ethnic minorities generally exceeded\nthat of non-Hispanic whites.4-6\nThere has been concern that child and adolescent age-groups have also\nbeen affected by rising trends in type 2 diabetes mellitus.7,8 The preva-\nlence of overweight children and adolescents is increasing in the United\nStates.9,10 Although there have not been US population estimates of the\nprevalence of type 2 diabetes in youth, an increase in type 2 diabetes has\nbeen noted in pediatric diabetes referral centers, as well as in Pima Indi-\nans.11,12 Additionally, there have not been estimates of population trends in\nage of onset of type 2 diabetes among adults in the United States.\nGiven the increasing prevalence of diabetes in the United States and\nthe evidence that type 2 diabetes is being diagnosed in younger popula-\ntions, the onset of type 2 diabetes may be occurring at a much younger\nage in the US population as a whole.

We\nreport the mean self-reported age at diagnosis of type\n2 diabetes and make comparisons between the most\nrecently available population data from the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES\nand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)\nMETHODS\nData Sources\nthe NHANES III. The National Center for Health\nStatistics (NCHS), Division of Health Examination\nStatistics, part of the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (CDC), has conducted the NHANES\nseries of health and nutrition surveys since the early\n1960s. The most recent NHANES spans the years\ninterview, physician examination, laboratory testing,\nand other diagnostic testing at mobile examination\ncenters. The NHANES survey designs are stratified,\nmultistage probability samples that target the civilian,\nnoninstitutionalized US population. The sampling\ndesign and weighting system of the surveys allow\ncalculation of estimates of the number and percentage\nof persons in the US population and designated age\nand race/ethnicity subgroups with selected diseases,\ndespite intentional oversampling of children and\nminorities.13 Although the NHANES III spans 6 years,\nthe NCHS recommends that computation of national\nestimates from the total NHANES III is the preferred\nanalysis method, because individual phase estimates\nmay be highly variable.13\nAssessment of Diagnosed Diabetes\nand Age at Diagnosis\nThe NHANES surveys assessed participants for diag-\nnosed diabetes using the question, \"Other than during\npregnancy, have you ever been told by a doctor or\nhealth professional that you have diabetes or sugar\ndiabetes?\" We defined participants with diagnosed\ndiabetes as those who answered \"yes\" to this ques-\ntion about the presence of diagnosed diabetes, which\nexcluded gestational diabetes mellitus. Age at diag-\nnosis for those defined as having diagnosed diabetes\nwas determined by the participant's self-report of their\nage \"when a health professional first told you that you\nhad diabetes or sugar diabetes.\" Participants with dia-\nbetes who did not report their age at diagnosis were\nexcluded (n = 27 for NHANES III; n = 5 for NHANES\nDifferentiating Type 1 from Type 2\nDiabetes Mellitus\nBecause we wanted to investigate differences in age at\ndiagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, it was necessary\nto differentiate type 2 diabetes from type 1 diabetes in\nNHANES participants. These 2 disease processes are\nvery different and tend to have different ages of onset.\nNHANES, however, does not specifically categorize\nparticipants with regard to type of diabetes and does\nnot measure islet cell autoantibodies. Considering the\nusual clinical course of type 1 diabetes, we defined any-\none with diabetes diagnosed before the age of 30 years\nwho was taking only insulin therapy as having type 1\ndiabetes mellitus and excluded that person from our\nsample. This definition is consistent with United King-\ndom Prospective Diabetes Study Group (UKPDS) find-\nings that autoantibodies to islet-cell cytoplasm and glu-\ntamic acid decarboxylase decline markedly with age.14\nStratification by Age and Race/Ethnicity\nWe stratified groups by participant self-identified\nrace/ethnicity. Race/ethnicity groups are defined by\nthe NHANES as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nblack, Mexican American, other, and other Hispanic.\nFor our analyses we combined the Mexican Ameri-\ncan and other Hispanic groups into a single Hispanic\ngroup. We judged the \"other\" group to be both too\nheterogeneous and small to make meaningful popula-\ntion estimates, consistent with the NCHS guidelines\nfor analysis of the NHANES III,13 and this group was\nexcluded from the analysis (n = 155 for NHANES III,\nAnalysis\nStatistical analyses were carried out using SUDAAN\nversion 8.0.2 (Research Triangle Institute, Research\nTriangle Park, NC) to account for the complex weight-\ning scheme and clustering of the NHANES surveys\nand to generate US population estimates from the\ndata. Average age at diagnosis of diabetes is reported\nfor each race/ethnicity group after using appropriate\nsampling weights from each NHANES survey to arrive\nat population estimates. We tested for differences in\nage at diagnosis by race/ethnicity using a series of t\ntests to compare each race/ethnicity group pair. The\nInstitutional Review Board of the Medical University\nof South Carolina approved this research.\nRESULTS\npersons aged 20 years and older: 47.7% was male; the\nHispanic. Of these survey participants, we determined\nthat 430 had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nAfter applying sampling weights, these 430 partici-\npants represent 11.6 million persons with type 2 diabe-\nHispanic was black, and 9.5% was Hispanic.

Whites had diabetes diag-\nnosed at a significantly older age (53.2 years) than\nthe mean age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes decreased\nto 46.0 years (Table 1). Age at diagnosis did not dif-\nfer significantly by race/ethnicity (P = .58 for whites\nvs blacks or Hispanics) in the more recent NHANES\nDISCUSSION\nThe mean age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus in\nthe United States has decreased from 52 years, reported\nnations that might account for this rather dramatic\ndecrease occurring during a course of a decade. This\nchange may represent earlier onset of type 2 diabetes\nor earlier detection or a combination of these 2 effects.\nWhether the decrease in age at diagnosis was due to an\noverall decrease in actual age of onset among Ameri-\ncan adults or to earlier detection of type 2 diabetes by\nphysicians is unclear and cannot be determined from\nthese data. Decreasing age at diagnosis could also occur\nthrough increased public awareness, leading to earlier\nphysician consultation about recognized symptoms of\ndiabetes, which might reflect better education of the\npopulation about their risks for diabetes.\nEarlier detection by physicians is almost certainly\na factor influencing the decreasing age at diagnosis.\nThe diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus changed\nplasma glucose 140 mg/dL or a 2-hour plasma glucose\n200 mg/dL to the current American Diabetes Associa-\ntion (ADA) criteria of a fasting plasma glucose of 126\nmg/dL.15,16 The institution of yearly updated recom-\nmendations for clinical practice and screening from the\nADA may play a role in increased detection of diabetes\nby physicians and other health care clinicians.16,17\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force\n(USPSTF) has recommended against mass screening\nof asymptomatic persons for type 2 diabetes, conclud-\ning that the evidence for or against mass screening\nis inconclusive.18,19 The Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (CDC) Diabetes Cost-Effectiveness\nStudy Group concluded that opportunistic screening\nof all adults older than the age of 25 years would cost\nadjusted life-year gained, and it has generally recom-\nmended against mass screening for type 2 diabetes in\nadults.20 The ADA does not recommend general popu-\nlation screening, but it does recommend that screen-\ning be considered every 3 years for subgroups such\nas those aged 45 years and older, as well as increased\nscreening based on family history of type 2 diabetes,\nminority race/ethnicity, and other risk factors.17 As\nsuggested by these nationally representative findings\nof decreasing mean age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes,\nthese recommendations might need to be reexamined\nto include clinical screening recommendations for\nyounger age-groups, especially those at high risk.\nTable 1.

The\nNHANES did not ask participants to differentiate\nwhether they had type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nFor our analysis, we needed to differentiate individu-\nals with these 2 very different disease processes to\nobtain meaningful data. We believe we have created a\nconstruct that allows for the categorization of subjects\nin a manner that minimizes misclassification bias. As a\ncheck on our categorization scheme, we looked at the\ndistribution of C peptide levels in those that we cat-\ndata set. We found that among these participants who\nhad the fasting laboratory test performed (n = 156),\nsistent with type 2 diabetes.21 In addition, both the age\nat diagnosis and the diagnosis itself are self-reported,\nwhich may lead to the question of validity of the\ndiagnosis and correct recall of age at diagnosis. Self-\nreports of diabetes have been used as the basis of many\npopulation-based studies and should not be systemati-\ncally biased in a way differing from NHANES III to\nat the time of diagnosis of other health conditions has\nbeen shown to be fairly accurate when compared with\nUsing the NHANES data set is probably the only\nexisting method to make nationally representative\npopulation estimates about age at diagnosis of type 2\ndiabetes. The observed decrease in the age at diag-\nnosis may reflect population trends in the true age\nof onset of type 2 diabetes. Alternatively, health care\nclinicians may be doing a better job at recognizing the\nsubtle symptoms of diabetes. They are also likely to\nbe making earlier diagnoses as a result of more strin-\ngent diagnostic criteria. It is further possible that our\npopulation may be becoming better educated about\nthese symptoms, leading them to more readily seek\nappropriate health care. In either case, it is likely that\nwe are detecting type 2 diabetes earlier in the course\nof the disease, with likely positive health benefits for\nthis population. Identification of factors that can fur-\nther improve our detection of type 2 diabetes may be a\npromising area for future research.\nTo read or post commentaries in response to this article, see it\nonline at http://www.annfammed.org/cgi/content/full/3/1/60.\n",
