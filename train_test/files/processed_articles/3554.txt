    "abstract": "Abstract\nOwing to the cardinal and acknowledged importance of autonomy (AU) in learning, especially second-language learning,\nand influenced by the importance of inspecting its nature and the way it is associated with other psychological/cognitive/\nmetacognitive factors, this research investigated the relationship among English as a foreign language (EFL) learners' AU,\ncreativity (CR), and critical thinking (CT). The population for this study comprised of undergraduate EFL learners, between\nage\n= 22 years), from which 182 male and female subjects were selected via random selection. These\nparticipants, who were receiving formal instruction mainly through English, filled out three questionnaires related to CR, CT,\nand AU. Pearson's product\u00admoment correlation coefficient was used to analyze the data obtained. The results indicated that\nthere is a significant and positive relationship between EFL learners' CR and AU, CR and CT, as well as their CT and AU.\nConsidering AU as the predicted variable for this study, it was confirmed that CT makes the strongest unique contribution\nto explain AU. It is hoped that the results of this study will reveal the nature of AU more and will equip EFL teachers with a\nwider perspective on the characteristics of AU and the way CR and CT can predict and promote AU among EFL learners.\n",

According\ninherent source of motivation for learners that generates a\nproactive desire to interact with the environment to advance\none's personal growth, social development, and psychologi-\ncal well-being. The three psychological needs central to\nlearners are autonomy (AU), competence, and relatedness\n(Deci, Vallerand, Pelletier, & Ryan, 1991). Learners need to\nfeel autonomous, competent, and related to others to grow, to\nmake progress, and to be, by and large, well (O'Donnell,\nAU is the psychological need to experience self-direction\nin the initiation and regulation of one's behavior (Deci &\nRyan, 1985). Current English as a foreign language (EFL)\npedagogical trends seem to primarily focus on a student-\ncentered methodology in which learner AU is given a great\nsay that EFL learners are now given a meaningful role in\npedagogic decision making by being treated as active and\nAccordingly, language learners are becoming the focus of\ncurricula design (Nation & Macalister, 2010), and research-\ners are recognizing the significant role of learner AU in their\nAU, according to Scharle and Szab\u00f3 (2000), is the free-\ndom and ability to manage one's own affairs, which entails\nthe right to make decisions as well. An autonomous person,\naccording to Paul and Elder (2008), is not dependent on oth-\ners for the direction and control of one's thinking. They\nassert that it is the self-authorship on one's beliefs, values,\nand ways of thinking. The basis of learner AU, according to\nChang (2007), is that learner accepts responsibility for his or\nher learning. Little (1995) argues that the pursuit of AU in a\nformal educational context is a matter of both learning and\nlearning how to learn.\n1Islamic Azad University at Central Tehran, Iran\n2Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Branch, Tehran, Iran\nCorresponding Author:\nAlireza Zaker, English Department, College of Foreign Languages and\nLiterature, Islamic Azad University, West Kabirzadeh Boulevard, South\nEmail: alirezazaker@gmail.com\nMetacognitive Attributes and Liberated\nProgress: The Association Among\nSecond-Language Learners' Critical\nThinking, Creativity, and Autonomy\nMania Nosratinia1 and Alireza Zaker2\n Keywords\ncreativity, critical thinking, learning autonomy, psychological needs, second-language learning\n2 SAGE Open\nA very obvious reason for promoting learner AU is that\nteacher may not always be available for guiding or instruct-\ning. Therefore, according to Nation and Macalister (2010),\nAU proffers learners the capability to know \"how to learn a\nlanguage and how to monitor and be aware of their learning,\nso that they can become effective and independent language\nlearners\" (p. 38). There is an intimate relationship between\nAU and effective learning. In other words, the development\nof AU implies better language learning (Benson, 2001). The\nexplicit recognition of AU as an important and highly influ-\nential mental attribute in the process of learning a new lan-\nguage gives ample justification for investigating the way it is\nrelated to the other mental and personal factors and the way\nit can be enriched directly or indirectly (Nosratinia & Zaker,\nAU requires support from environmental conditions, and\nthe key source of support for learners'AU in the classroom is\nthe teacher (O'Donnell et al., 2012). It is believed that when\nEFL teachers are AU supportive toward learners, it would\ndirectly affect the degree of AU among learners (Chan,\n2001). However, to develop the sense of AU among learners,\nteachers need to have a broader perspective on the process of\nlearning and the affecting factors which directly or indirectly\naffect the process of learning, AU in learning, and target lan-\nattempt to establish AU enhancing techniques and to know\nthe nature of AU seems to be perfectly justified. In this\nregard, discovering the relationship between AU and other\npsychological/cognitive/metacognitive factors not only\nreveals the nature of AU more but also equips EFL teachers\nwith a higher degree of knowledge and a wider perspective\nregarding the characteristics of learners and the way they\nwill better progress in their learning.\nThe main purpose of the present study was to investigate\nthe way AU is related to creativity (CR) and critical thinking\n(CT) among EFL learners. CR and CT are not only among\nthe hot topics in the teaching English as a foreign language\n(TEFL) profession, but they are also widely acknowledged\nto be among the metacognitive factors, which substantially\naffect, influence, and shape the process of learning English\nas a second/foreign language (Connolly, 2000; Kabilan,\nline with Kabilan's (2000) statement where he argues that for\nlearners to become proficient in a language, they clearly\nneed to employ creative and critical thinking through the tar-\nget language. Therefore, inspecting the relationship among\nAU, CT, and CR seems justified, indispensable, essential,\nand promising toward the elevation and advancement of\nclassroom practice and teacher education.\nSocrates began the tradition of CT by reflectively ques-\ntioning common beliefs and expectations, and separating\nbeliefs that are reasonable and logical from those that lack\nevidence or rational foundation (Zireva & Letseka, 2013).\nAccording to Kress (1985), CT is a social practice and is\nlanguage itself. CT, as a high level of cognitive function, \"is\na purposeful, self-regulatory judgement which results in\ninterpretation, analysis evaluation, and inference, as well as\nexplanations of evidential, conceptual, methodological or\ncontextual considerations upon which the judgement is\nthat CT makes it possible to look at issues from different\nperspectives. Educators have also argued for the importance\nof promoting higher order thinking skills in English as a sec-\nond language (ESL) and EFL classrooms (Chamot, 1995;\nTarvin & Al-Arishi, 1991), and empirical evidence supports\nthe effectiveness of teaching CT skills along with learning\nand teaching English as a second or foreign language\nCR is another metacognitive trait which can be justifiably\nincluded in the category of learning affecting elements\n(Mishan, 2005).As Pink has stated (as cited in Rao & Prasad,\n2009), humankind is \"entering a new age where creative\nthinking is becoming increasingly important\" (p. 31). Thanks\nto the outstanding attempts made by Guilford and Torrance,\nthe field of CR has developed as it is widely known today\n(Sternberg, 2009). In the modern world, CR is fundamentally\nimportant in all aspects of life, and as CR is complex in\nnature, different viewpoints have been put forward to explain\nthe concept emphasizing its different aspects (Sarsani, 2006).\nAs stated by T. I. Lubart (1999), CR is generally character-\nized as the ability to create new and original products which\nare considered appropriate for the features and limitations of\na given task, where products can refer to a variety of ideas,\nviewpoints, and innovations. T. Lubart and Guignard (2004)\nbelieve that these products must be original because they\ncannot be just a mere copy of what already exists.\nHumans are all born with a huge potential for CR and\nlearning in varying degrees, and CR can be nurtured \"at all\nages and in all fields of human endeavor\" (Sarsani, 2005,\np. 47). To this end, developing CR at all levels in the educa-\ntion system is increasingly recognized as being critical in\nimproving educational attainment and life skills (Agarwal,\n1992). Second/foreign language teaching of course is one\nsuch educational attainment and arguably a life skill.\nMoreover, in the words of Carter (2004), \"Discussions of\ncreativity in relation to language teaching and learning have\nbeen extensive and continue to be a very major point of\napplication of a wide range of theories of creativity\" (p. 213).\nAccording to Sarsani (2005), \"Philosophy sees creativity\nas a process of change\" (p. 132). Education must thus \"enable\npeople to generate and implement new ideas and to adapt\npositively to different changes in order to survive in the cur-\nrent world\" (Jeffrey & Craft, 2001, p. ix). In all actuality,\n\"Creativity is an inherent aspect of all pedagogical tasks\"\n(Mishan, 2005, p. 83). Therefore, it seems to be quite reason-\nable to state that the TEFL/TESOL (teaching English to\nspeakers of other languages) practice and its product which\nis second-language (L2) proficiency can be highly influ-\nNosratinia and Zaker 3\nThe put forward premises give ample justification for wit-\nnessing a growing body of research in our field that aims at\nconducting further investigation into the nature of CR, CT,\nand AU and the way they promote learning a new language.\nHowever, the question that is raised here is whether CR, CT,\nand AU are associated to each other and if so, to what extent.\nThis issue intrigued the researchers of this study to investi-\ngate the relationship among EFL learners' CR, CT, and AU.\nTo fulfill this objective, the following research questions\nwere proposed:\nResearch Question 1: Is there any significant relation-\nship between EFL learners' CR and CT?\nResearch Question 2: Is there any significant relation-\nship between EFL learners' CR and AU?\nResearch Question 3: Is there any significant relation-\nship between EFL learners' CT and AU?\nAssuming a significant relationship among the three vari-\nables, the following research question was posed:\nResearch Question 4: Is there any significant difference\nbetween EFL learners' CR and CT in predicting AU?\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe participants in this research consisted of undergraduate\nEFL learners majoring in English translation and English lit-\nerature at the Islamic Azad University, Central Tehran and\nRoudehen branches. In these full-time undergraduate\ncourses, English is the main medium of instruction; however,\noccasional use of learners' first language (L1; Persian) is\nallowed. This point is based on the fact that the initial level\nof English language proficiency among these undergraduate\nstudents is assumed to be intermediate to upper-intermediate,\nas tested by the university entrance examinations in Iran.\nFrom the above-mentioned population, 182 male and female\nselected via cluster random sampling. There is no age limit\nfor enrolling in these undergraduate courses; therefore, it\nwas observed that a limited number of participants (n = 3)\nwere fairly older than the rest of the participants.\nInstruments\nThree instruments utilized to collect data pertaining to the\nsubjects' levels of CR, CT, and AU were as follows:\n1. A questionnaire of AU by Spratt, Humphreys, and\n2. A questionnaire of CR created by O'Neil, Abedi, and\n3. A questionnaire of CT developed by Honey (2000).\nLearner AU Questionnaire\nTo evaluate participants' level of AU, a questionnaire of AU\nincluding 52 items was administered. The questionnaire\nthough designed by Spratt et al. (2002), is strongly influ-\nenced by Holec's (1981) definition of AU. Holec defines AU\nas \"the ability to take charge of one's own learning and where\nto take charge of one's learning is to hold the responsibility\nfor all the decisions concerning all aspects of this learning\"(as\nHolec, according to Spratt et al. (2002), argues that ability\nand responsibility are functioning in five principal areas:\n\"determining objectives; defining contents and progressions;\nselecting methods and techniques to be used; monitoring the\nprocedure of acquisition; and evaluating what has happened\"\n(p. 249). All these notions of ability and responsibility are\nincorporated in the questionnaire.\nThe questionnaire has four sections. The first section (13\nitems) focuses on examining students' views of their respon-\nsibilities and those of their teachers. The second section (11\nitems) evaluates participants' confidence in their ability to\noperate autonomously. The third section (1 item) aims to\nmeasure the levels of student motivation to learn English.\nThe fourth section (27 items) investigates students' practice\nof autonomous learning in the form of both inside and out-\nside class activities.\nRespondents were asked to indicate their answers in 20\nmin in a Likert-type scale, sequentially assigning values 1, 2,\n3, 4, and 5 to options not at all, a little, some, mainly, and\ncompletely in Section 1. Counting 1 for \"very poor\" to 5 for\n\"very good\" in Section 2. Setting 5 to 1 beside the first to the\nlast choices in Section 3; and attributing values of 1, 2, 3, and\n4 to options of \"never,\" \"rarely,\" \"sometimes,\" and \"often\"\nin Section 4. In this regard, the result can vary from 52 to\n233. It is self-evident that the higher the mark, the more\nautonomous the participant is.\nIn this study, the Persian version of this questionnaire that\nwas translated and validated by Fahim and Sheikhy (2011)\nwas employed to make sure the participants fully compre-\nhended it. The reliability of AU questionnaire was estimated\nto be .84 using Cronbach's alpha coefficient, which demon-\nstrated a good degree of reliability.\nCR Questionnaire\nThis questionnaire was originally designed by O'Neil et al.\n(1992) and is called the Abedi\u00adSchumacher Creativity Test\nor the ACT (as cited in Cropley, 2000). According to Abedi\n(2002), the estimated correlation coefficient between the\nfour subscales of the ACT and the Torrance Test of Creative\nThinking (TTCT) was meaningful at .01 level of signifi-\ncance. Therefore, the concurrent validity of ACT was estab-\nlished. It is worth noting that the TTCT is one of the best\n4 SAGE Open\nknown tests of CR, which consists of two sections: verbal\nand nonverbal or figural sections. In fact, the development of\nthe ACT was an attempt to shorten the time needed for the\nadministration and scoring of the TTCT. The estimated reli-\nability of each of the subscales of the ACT was .61 to .75,\nwhich demonstrated that the test is also reliable (Auzmendi,\nIn this study, the Persian version of this questionnaire,\ndeveloped and validated by Zaker (2013) based on the origi-\nnal test, was utilized. Zaker provides the following sections\nto assess and appraise the validity of the instrument: a report\non content validity, checking the criterion-related validity, an\nanalysis of the internal structure of the instrument using\nexploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and a report on\nthe reliability of the instrument including 50 items. The 50\nmultiple-choice items of this test have three options ranging\nfrom least to most creative responses with a range of scores\nbetween 0 and 2; therefore, the scores of the test could range\nrespond to the questionnaire. In this study, the internal con-\nsistency of this test was estimated to be .87 using Cronbach's\nalpha coefficient.\nCT Questionnaire\nThe CT questionnaire intends to explore what a person might\nor might not do when thinking critically about a subject.\nDeveloped by Honey (2000), the questionnaire aims at evalu-\nating the three main skills of comprehension, analysis, and\nevaluation of the participants. This questionnaire is a Likert-\ntype questionnaire with 30 items, which allows researchers to\ninvestigate learners'ability in note-taking, summarizing, ques-\ntioning, paraphrasing, researching, inferencing, discussing,\nclassifying and outlining, comparing and contrasting, distin-\nguishing, synthesizing, inductive and deductive reasoning.\nThe participants were asked to rate the frequency of each\ncategory they use on a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging\nfrom never (1 point), seldom (2 points), sometimes (3 points),\noften (4 points), to always (5 points). The participants' final\nscores are calculated by adding up the numbers of the scores.\nThe ultimate score is computed in the possible range of 30\nto150. The participants were allocated 20 min to complete\nthe questionnaire.\nIn this study, the Persian version of this questionnaire was\nemployed, which was translated and validated by Naeini\n(2005). In a study conducted by Nosratinia and Abbasi\n(2013) on EFL learners, the reliability of this questionnaire\nwas estimated to be .79 using Cronbach's alpha coefficient.\nIn this study, the reliability of CT questionnaire was esti-\nmated to be .81 using Cronbach's alpha coefficient, which\ndemonstrated a fair degree of reliability.\nProcedure\nIn descriptive research, the procedures should be described\nas accurately and completely as possible, so that the\nreplication of research by other researchers would become\npossible (Best & Kahn, 2006). To achieve the purpose of this\nstudy and address the questions posed, certain procedures\nwere pursued which are explained below.\nAfter obtaining a formal approval for conducting the\nresearch in the universities mentioned above (see partici-\npants), for every session of administration, three available\nclasses were codified. Next, one class was chosen randomly\nand the other two classes were excluded from the study. This\nprocedure resulted in having samples selected on a cluster\nsampling basis, which according to Springer (2010) and Best\nand Kahn (2006) would increase the validity and generaliz-\nability of the findings of a descriptive study. All the EFL stu-\ndents in the selected class were then informed about the aim\nof the study and were given the choice whether to fill in the\nquestionnaires or not. They were also informed that the\ninformation supplied by them will be treated as confidential.\nBefore administering the questionnaires, the participants\nwere fully briefed on the process of completing the question-\nnaires. This briefing was given in Persian by explaining and\nexemplifying the process of choosing answers. Due to the\nnature of this correlational study, no criterion for establishing\nhomogeneity was adopted. Moreover, the researchers inten-\ntionally randomized the order of questionnaires administered\nto control the impact of order upon the completion process\nand validity of the data.\nThereafter, the three questionnaires were administered to\nthe participants. The researchers randomly observed the fill-\ning out process of some individuals to make sure that they\nwere capable of fully understanding the questions and\nresponses. It should be added that the whole length of the\nclass periods of 90 min was devoted to administering these\nquestionnaires and the responses were handled with\nconfidentiality.\nSubsequently, the questionnaires were scored to specify\nthe participants' CT ability, the degree of AU, and the degree\nof CR. This was followed by the statistical analyses which\nwill be elaborated later in the following parts. It is worth\nmentioning here that, of the initial 300 administered ques-\ntionnaires, 182 sets of fully answered questionnaires of all\nthe three ones were considered for statistical analyses to\ndetermine the relationship among the variables. The other\n118 sets of questionnaires were excluded from the analyses\ndue to their incomplete answers.\nResults\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship\namong EFL learners' CR, CT, and AU. Accordingly, the\nresearchers conducted a series of pertinent calculations and\nstatistical routines to investigate the questions raised and\ncame up with certain results that are elaborated comprehen-\nsively in this part.\nThe data analysis provided both descriptive statistics and\ninferential statistics. Descriptive statistics such as mean,\nstandard deviation, and standard error of the mean were\nNosratinia and Zaker 5\nobtained. Next, to check the normality of distribution, the\nassumptions of linear correlation were checked. Moreover,\nthe reliability of the research instruments was estimated\nthrough Cronbach's alpha coefficient. In view of the normal\ndistribution of the variables in the inferential statistics,\nPearson's product\u00admoment correlation was then applied to\nthe data. The design of the present study is descriptive as the\nprimary motivation of the researchers was to investigate the\nrelationship among the three variables with no preceding\nTabachnick & Fidell, 2007). CR and CT were the predictor\nvariables of the predicted variable, AU. Furthermore, age\nand gender were categorized as an intervening variable.\nChecking the Assumptions of Linear Correlation\nTo run correlation, according to Tabachnick and Fidell\n(2007), the following assumptions should be checked:\n1. Linear relation between each pair of variables,\n2. Normality of the distribution of the variables, and\n3. Homoscedasticity.\nLinear relation between each pair of variables.To check the\nlinearity of relations, it was needed to visually inspect the\ndata by creating scatter plots. As there were multiple vari-\nables in the study, the researchers created a multiple scatter-\nplot for CR, CT, and AU, which showed that there was no\nkind of nonlinear relationship between the scores on CR, CT,\nand AU, such as a U-shaped or curvilinear distribution.\nNormality of the distributions.To check the normality of the\ndistributions, the descriptive statistics of the data were\nobtained and are reported in Table 1. As demonstrated in\nTable 1, the distribution of data for CR, CT, and AU was\nnormal as both the skewness and kurtosis ratios fell within\ntion did not show a significant deviation from normality.\nMoreover, the actual shapes of the distributions for CR, CT,\nand AU were inspected by checking the histograms of distri-\nbutions. This inspection demonstrated that scores were nor-\nmally distributed.\nHomoscedasticity.To check the assumption of homoscedas-\nticity, that is, the assumption that variance of residuals for\nevery pair of points on the independent variable is equal\n(Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007), the residuals plot was exam-\nined (Figure 1). As demonstrated in Figure 1, the cloud of\ndata is scattered randomly across the plot and thus the vari-\nance is said to be homogeneous. As the assumptions of linear\ncorrelation were all observed for CR, CT, and AU, the data\nwere analyzed by Pearson's correlation with the aim of seek-\ning the answers to the questions of the study.\nThe First Research Question\nIt has been a common belief among many educators and psy-\nchologists that CR and CT are closely associated, and they\nboth amplify and foster higher order thinking (Chamot,\ncally investigate the way CT and CR are associated among\nEFL learners, the following question was posed as the first\nresearch question of this study:\nResearch Question 1: Is there any significant relation-\nship between EFL learners' CR and CT?\nTo answer this question, the data were analyzed by\nPearson's product\u00admoment correlation coefficient. The\nresults showed that there was a significant and positive cor-\nand high levels of CT were associated with high levels of\nTable 1.

Table 3 reports the results of ANOVA,\nAlso, Table 4 demonstrates the Standardized Beta\nCoefficients, which signify the degree to which each predic-\ntor variable contributes to the prediction of the predicted\nvariable.

However, the comparison of beta values revealed\np = .0005). This means that this variable makes the strongest\nstatistically significant unique contribution to explaining\nAU. Therefore, it was concluded that CT could predict more\nsignificantly the AU scores of the participants.\nUltimately, although normality of the distributions was\nchecked for correlation in the previous sections, the residuals\ntable (Table 5) also verified the absence of outstanding outli-\ners as the Cook's distance values did not exceed 1 and\nMahalanobis distance values did not exceed 13.82\n(Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). Thus, the P\u00adP plot (Figure 2)\nwas used to visually inspect the result.\nTable 2. Model Summary--R and R2.\nModel R R2 Adjusted R2 SE of the estimate\nNote.

Based on\nthe pertinent data analyses carried out, the researchers\nobserved that there were significant relationships among the\nabove-mentioned variables. The relationship between EFL\nlearners' CT and CR showed a high degree of significance\nr = .825), which supports the notion that CR and CT as two\nprincipal metacognitive and mental factors are closely\nrelated. This finding was supported by previous research\nwhere it was reported that both CR and CT significantly\nintensify and contribute to the quality of mental processes\nand, as a result, the quality and extent of learning (Agarwal,\nof the multiple regression analysis indicated that between CT\nand CR, CT plays a more important role in predicting AU\nThe observed significant relationship between CT andAU\nwas in line with the results of another study conducted by\nFahim and Sheikhy (2011) where a significant, though\nsmaller, relationship was observed between CT and AU (r =\n.546). However, this study attempted to not only follow a\nmore careful and systematic pattern of progress but also to\ncompare the relationship between CT and AU with the rela-\ntionship between CR and AU. This study confirmed that a\nsignificant relationship exists between CR and AU (r =\n.665), which indicates that CR and creative thinking can sig-\nnificantly contribute to the degree of AU among EFL learn-\ners. It was systematically confirmed that CR makes a large\n(maybe not the largest) unique contribution to explaining AU\namong EFL learners.\nBy and large, the results of the present study revealed that\nwhen there is variance in any of the observed variables,\nnamely, CR, CT, and AU, there also exists variance in the\nother variable(s). Put simply, the three variables are closely\nand significantly interrelated. Furthermore, between CR and\nCT, CT is a better predictor of AU among EFL learners, as\nobserved in this sample. These points may provide EFL\nteachers with a deeper understanding of learners' CR and CT\nand the way their components are associated. Therefore,\ntheir basic components, that is, those of CR (fluency, flexi-\nbility, originality, imaginativeness, and elaboration) and CT\n(identifying and challenging assumptions, imagining, explor-\ning, and enumerating other options, respecting evidence and\nreasoning, defining the context, listing reasons explicitly,\nand self-correction) should be considered as important fac-\ntors among EFL learners. These factors, as the practical dem-\nonstrations of CT and CR, not only would encourage each\nother but would also promote AU and better learning among\nEFL learners. The above-mentioned relationship gives ample\njustification for integrating all of the components of CR and\nCT into the classroom practice through different stages (from\nmaking decision on the content to assessment and evaluation\nprocess) and the body of tasks to increase the chance of pro-\nmoting AU as well as the chance of promoting learning as\nthe direct influence of CR and CT.\nDue to the importance of the above-mentioned factors,\nthis study suggests that EFL teachers inform EFL learners of\nthe ways through which CT, CR, and AU can contribute to a\nmore independent, reliable, and effective learning process. In\nthis research, it was revealed that the more creative and criti-\ncal thinker the learners are, the more they are equipped to act\nautonomously and independently, which would result in a\nmore personalized learning. Therefore, EFL teachers are rec-\nommended, when planning classroom activities, to include\nCT-, CR-, and AU-oriented activities. These activities would\nbe based on highlighting the basic components of CT and\nCR, as stated in the previous paragraph. Creating an environ-\nment in which CR, CT, and AU are properly valued and in\nwhich learners take the responsibility for their own learning\nseems to be a considerable step toward benefiting from the\npotential capacities of CR, CT, and AU toward learning.\nBased on the peculiarities of each context and the peda-\ngogical objectives, EFL teachers might be able to orchestrate\nthe instruction to arm learners with CR, CT, and AU, which\nare believed to bring about significant advantages for EFL\nlearners. These attempts may include helping learners mak-\ning appropriate choices and encouraging them to expand\nTable 5.

All in all, teachers are expected to realize\ntheir role as a contributor to the improvement of their learn-\ners' mental capacities by exposing them to different innova-\ntive, problem-solving, andAU strategies on one hand, and by\nproviding a way to progress gradually to be more active and\nresponsible for their own learning, on the other hand.\nDue to the fact that language learning is a multidimen-\nsional phenomenon, not only language teachers but language\nlearners also are required to play their role properly to facili-\ntate and optimize this complicated process. Therefore, the\nresults of the current study have implications for language\nlearners, encouraging them to become more creative, auton-\nomous, and critical about their learning activities. It is hoped\nthat the results of this study would make EFL learners more\ninternally motivated to value autonomous learning and cre-\native and critical thinking. Furthermore, improving thinking\nskills in a learning context can help learners to be equipped\nwith tools designed to instill positive attitudes toward learn-\ning a new language and positive views of themselves as\nlearners. When students are empowered with metacognitive\nskills in tandem with AU-oriented activities, they become\nconfident, independent, autonomous, and fluent learners.\nGiven the content of EFL/ESL materials, in the present era\nand influenced by the heightened knowledge of TEFL, the\nlanguage learners are also becoming the focus of curricula\nalso assist syllabus designers and curriculum developers to\nintegrate AU, CR, and CT into the body of EFL materials in a\nway that serves the purpose of instruction and teaching best.\nMoreover, possessing a higher degree of understanding\nregarding these metacognitive variables (CR, CT, and AU)\nwould enable syllabus designers and curriculum developers\nto proffer the learners the capability to know how to learn a\nlanguage, how to monitor themselves, and how to develop\ntheir learning, so that they can become effective and indepen-\ndent language learners (Nation & Macalister, 2010).\nSyllabus designers, as providers of a great portion of the\nlanguage learning setting, have a fundamental role to make\nthe process easier. They are expected to appreciate the\nimmense value and great potential of CR and CT for enhanc-\ning the level of learning and AU among EFL learners, which\nresults in having intellectual, active learners that through\nusing thinking skills can overcome their learning difficulties.\nSyllabus designers are strongly recommended to incorporate\nCR and CT tasks into EFL materials in which fluency, elabo-\nration, identifying the problem, defining the context, enu-\nmerating choices, analyzing options, listing reasons\nexplicitly, and self-correction are valued. This way, the learn-\ning context is given the chance to let thinking skills surface\nthrough learning activities. It is also reasonable and well-\njustified to incorporate CR, CT, and AU into the body of\nachievement and diagnostic tests where it might provide the\ncontext-sensitive teachers with a better understanding of the\nmental and cognitive states of the learners and the way the\ninstruction has been successful or should be adapted. In the\nsame vein, it is also suggested to include CR, CT, and AU in\nthe prognostic tests of English courses, namely placement\ntests.\nThe findings of this study confirmed that CR and CT\nwould facilitate learning a new language through promoting\nAU. Moreover, it was observed that, in this context, CT\nmakes the strongest unique contribution to explain AU.\nHowever, considering the inherent lack of control or knowl-\nedge regarding the influential factors in correlational research\ninspect the way other mental and personality factors interact\nwith the variables of this study. Moreover, the same study\ncould be conducted among other age groups regarding the\ndifference among different age groups with respect to mental\nand personal qualities. This study can also be replicated\nemploying some qualitative instruments, for example, inter-\nviews, to increase the validity and generalizability of the\nfindings.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAbedi, J.
