In this paper, we provide evidence on this issue. We focus\non the effect of MW policy on the gender wage gaps1 for the following two reasons.\nFirst, the implementation of the MW, in theory, may increase the income of low-\nwage workers and is beneficial to reduce poverty. Therefore, the MW is enacted as an\nimportant labor policy. To examine the policy effect, many empirical analyses have\nbeen conducted in other countries. In contrast, although the MW has been in effect\nsince 1993 in China, empirical analysis of it using micro-data is rare.\nSecond, while the main objective of MW implementation is to increase the wage\nlevel of low-wage groups, most studies only focus on the effect of MW on low-skill\nworker employment2 (which appears to be the most important issue). Moreover, these\nstudies overlook the effect of MW on wage gaps, particularly gender wage gaps. The\neffects of the MW on gender wage gap depend on many factors. Some of these factors\ninclude, the gender gap in the proportion of workers whose wages are below the\nregional MW level and the gender gap between actual wages and the MW level before\nthe implementation of the MW (Robinson 2002, 2005). Therefore, although the imple-\nmentation of the MW does not imply a reduction of gender wage gap in theory, we\nneed to verify its effects through an empirical analysis.\nThis paper attempts to answer the following questions through an empirical analysis\nusing micro-data from Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP) survey. First, is the\nproportion of the population with wages below the MW level greater for males than\n\u00a9 2015 Li and Ma.

Is the gap between actual wages and the MW level greater for females than\nfor males? Second, would different MW levels adopted in various regions lead to a\nregional difference in gender wage gap? Third, does the MW system affect gender wage\ngap? What are the effects of endowment differentials? What are the effects of endow-\nment return differentials? Fourth, has the MW system, which was implemented in\n1993, affected the gender wage gap? If it has, is there a difference in short-term and\nlong-term effects? Because we use the cross-sectional micro survey data from three\nperiods, a repeated cross-section analysis should also investigate the changes (if any) in\nthe abovementioned issues along with policy changes. Considering that the MW pri-\nmarily affects low-income groups, we employ different models to conduct the analysis\non average wages and wage distribution.\nThis paper is structured as follows. Part II introduce the implementation of the MW\nin China, Part III reviews the literature. Part IV describes analysis methods, includ-\ning introduction to data and models. Part V answer the first question presented\nabove using statistical description results. Part VI states the quantitative analysis\nresults to answer the second, third and fourth questions. Part VII presents the\nmain conclusions.\n2 The implementation of the MW in China\nIn China, since the 1980s, there has been increasing migration from rural to urban\nareas, which has been accompanied by an increase in the low wages of migrants and a\nrise in income inequality. To deal with these social problems, the MW policy was first\npromulgated as a law in 1993. The MW is applicable to two kinds of wages, the\nmonthly wage and the hourly wage. Minimum monthly wage standards are applied to\nregular workers, while the minimum hourly wage is applied to non-regular workers.\nWage, which is defined by the MW policy, is the basic wage with the exception of over-\ntime work payment and some allowances.\nAs per policy, the MW level is determined by the regional government, the union,\nand the representatives of companies. However, in reality, MW levels are determined\nprimarily by the regional governments.\nThe MW level is adjusted once every two years, according to many factors such\nas the regional lowest living cost, consumer price index of urban residents, social\ninsurance, the housing fund that individual workers are paid, the regional average\nwage level, the status of economic development, and employment status. The ad-\njustment of the MW level is carried out by the local government (province or city\ngovernments); as a result, there are regional disparities. For example, the MW level\nis higher in the eastern regions as compared to the western and central regions,\nand the increase within these bands of the MW levels are also different across re-\ngions (see Fig. 1). These regional disparities allow us to use a quasi-natural experi-\nment model to prove the effects of MW. We will provide detailed explanations\nabout this in the following paragraphs.\nAlthough the government enforced the implementation of the MW, there are no\npenalties for violations; hence, there are several compliance problems and MW is not\nthoroughly implemented in the private sector. These compliance problems account for\nthe phenomenon of workers with wages below the prescribed level, although the MW\n3 Literature review\nThere are a large number of empirical studies of the effects of the MW on employment,\nbut the studies on wage distribution are scarce. The studies related to the empirical\nanalyses in this paper are reviewed in the following.\nDiNardo et al. (1996) conducted studies on the effects of a MW on a wage gap. In\nparticular, they assumed other things equal to evaluate the wage distribution in 1988\nbased on the fixed MW level in 1979, and then compared the 1979 level with the actual\nlevel in 1988 to reveal the effects of the MW system on a wage gap. The analysis shows\nthat there is an increase in the wage gap in 1988 compared with 1979; the decrease of\nthe MW level results in an increased wage gap (17% for male, 24% for female). Card\nand Krueger (1995) conducted a study on the effects of changes in the MW level from\n1989 to 1992 on changes in wage gaps in the U.S. Using a natural experiment model\nbased on the MW system change, in which the MW level was increased in some states\nin 1990 and 1991, they indicated that the Minimum Wage Act pulled up the incomes\nof low-wage workers and narrowed the regional wage gap.\nIn addition, to investigate the effects of the MW on gender wage gap, Robinson\neffects of the MW implemented throughout the country in April 1999 on gender wage\ngap. The analysis, based on a quasi-DID model (using London, whose gender wage gap\nis the smallest before the implementation of the MW, as a control group and other\nregions as treatment groups), shows that the effects of the MW on gender wage gap\nvary in different regions. Shannon (1996) utilized the Canadian Labor Force Survey\ndata in 1986 and the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method to conduct a relevant\nstudy that shows that the MW narrowed the gender wage gap among the population\nFig. 1 Regional Disparities of the MW levels (2004 and 2006). Source: published information by each\nregional governments\nCurrently, there is no empirical analysis of the effects of the MW on gender wage\ngap in urban China. Our study may address this lack to a certain extent.\n4 Methodology and data\n(1)Robinson model for the effects of the MW on gender wage gap\nRobinson (2002, 2005) established a model to analyze the effects of the MW system\non gender wage gap in the UK. This model is primarily used to show that there are two\nreasons for the effects of the MW on gender wage gap. First, the MW level (MW) has\nvarious effects on wage distribution:\nWi\n\u00bc Wi\nif Wi\n> MW\nWi\n\u00bc MW if W\u00c3\ni\nEquation (1) shows that for groups with a wage greater than the MW level (Wi\n> MW)\nbefore the implementation of the MW, the wage remains the same after such implemen-\ntation; whereas, for those with a wage lower than the MW level W\u00c3\ni\nbefore the\nimplementation, the wage increases to the MW level after such implementation. As a\nresult, the average wage after the implementation of the MW should be a composite value\naffected by these two weights and expressed as follows:\n\u00bc\nX\nmw\nMW\n\u00f0 \u00de\nNmw\n\" #\n\u00c3\nNmw\nN\n \n\u00fe\nX\nN-Nmw\nWi\n\u00f0 \u00de\nN-Nmw\n\" #\nN-Nmw\nN\n \n\u00bc\nX\nmw\nMW\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00c3\nN\n\u00fe\nX\nN-Nmw\nWi\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00c3\nN\nThe changes in the average wage before and after such implementation can be\nexpressed as follows:\nW \u00bc\nN\nX\nmw\n\u00f0 \u00de\n\" #\nEquation (3) indicates that there are two reasons for the changes in average wage\nbefore and after the implementation of the MW: the number of workers with wages\nlower than the MW level and the gap between the actual wage and the MW level.\nConsequently, the gender wage gap before the implementation of the MW can be\nexpressed as Eqs. (4) and (5):\nWf\nWm\n before\n\u00bc\nX\nWf\nMW\nWf\n\u00fe\nX\nWf\nWf\nX\nWm\nMW\nWm\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00c3 1=Nm\n\u00fe\nX\nWm\nWm\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00c3 1=Nm\nWf\nWm\n after\n\u00bc\nX\nWf\nMW\nMW\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00c3 1=Nf\n\u00fe\nX\nWf\nWf\nX\nWm\nMW\nMW\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00c3 1=Nm\n\u00fe\nX\nWm\nWm\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00c3 1=Nm\nThe following assumptions are drawn based on a comparison between Eqs. (4)\nand (5). i. When the number of females is greater than that of males among\nworkers having wages lower than the MW level before the implementation of the\nMW, and ii. When the gap between actual wages and the MW level for females is\ngreater than that for males before the implementation of the MW, such an imple-\nmentation may contribute to narrowing the gender wage gap at the low-wage\ndistribution.\nBecause i. and ii. stated above are only assumptions, the implementation of the MW\ndoes not imply a certain reduction of gender wage gap in theory. Further investigations\nmust be conducted with the following models.\n(2)Estimates of gender wage gap of regions by the MW level\nBased on the MW level, we classified the samples into high MW regions, medium\nMW regions and low MW regions3 to estimate the wage function. The wage function\nis represented with Eq. (6).\n\u00bc aijt\n\u00fe Xijt\n\u00fe ijt\nIn Eq. (6), i represents individual workers, t represents periods and j represents three\ncategories of regions (high MW regions, middle WM regions and low MW regions). X\nis other variables affecting wages (such as education and work experience as a proxy\nfor human capital, or male dummy variable), a is a constant,  is an error term and \nrepresents the coefficient estimates of variables. Using coefficients of the male dummy\nestimated by regional sub-groups, we compare the regional differentials of gender wage\nTo see the different effects by wage distribution, we adopt the Quantile Regression\nModel (Koenker and Baset 1978), which can be expressed as:\nmin\nX \n\u00f0 \u00de\nX\n \n\u00f0 \u00deXi\n- \n\u00f0 \u00deXi\nj j \u00fe\nX\n<\u00deXi\n- \n\u00f0 \u00deXi\nj j\n\n\n\u00f0 \u00de\nIn Eq. (7), i represents individual workers, and  represents quantile of wages\n(1% quantile is expressed as 1th). The equation's other variables are the same as\nthose of Eq. (6). \n(.) is a check (or indicator) function. The QR model is de-\nsigned for estimation using the optimal method, which minimizes the two error\nterms in Eq. (7).\n(3)Decomposition model for the effects of the MW level on gender wage gaps\nTo decompose the effect on gender wage gaps, the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition\nposition method using estimated coefficient and average values of males or females\nmay lead to an index number problem. To address this problem, this paper adopts the\nOaxaca-Ransom decomposition model (Oaxaca and Ransom 1994).\n\u00bc Xm\n-Xf\n\u00c3 \u00fe Xf\n\u00c3-\nf\n \n\u00fe Xm\n\nm\n-\u00c3\nIn Eq. (8), m represents males, f represents females, lnW is the logarithm of the aver-\nage wage, X is the average of variables, and m\nand f\nrepresent the estimated coeffi-\ncients resulting from the wage function of males and females, respectively. Note the *\n(no-discrimination wage structure) therein, which is a gender-neutral coefficient esti-\nmated based on wage functions using the entire sample. Concerning the Oaxaca and\nRansom model, Xm\n-Xf\n\u00c3 represents the gender wage gap resulting from a difference\nin endowment including, for example, human capital, Xf\n\u00c3-\nf\n \nrepresents the\ngap caused by too-low endowment return of females (known as \"female loss\") and\nXm\n\nm\n-\u00c3\nrepresents the gap generated by too-high endowment return of males\n(known as \"male gain\"). The sum of these two decomposition values stands for the\ngender wage gap resulting from differences in endowment return, including dis-\ncrimination.6 We add the variable of the MW levels and Kaitz Index7 in this model\nto decompose these MW factors' effects on gender wage gap.\n(4)DID analysis for the effects of the MW on gender wage gap\nAlthough the effect of the MW on gender wage gap can be decomposed by the\nendowment difference and endowment returns difference as described above, it is\nnecessary to provide evidence on whether the MW has affected gender wage differen-\ntials. Here, we apply the DID model, which is frequently used for policy evaluation.\nDID analysis8 can be represented as follows:\nlnWijt\n\u00bc a \u00fe \nx\nXijt\n\u00fe \nye\nYearij\n\u00fe \ntr\nTreatijt\n\u00fe \nm\nMaleijt\n\u00fe \nyetr\nYear \u00c3 Treatijt\n\u00fe \nyem\nYear \u00c3 Maleijt\n\u00fe \ntrm\nTreat \u00c3 Maleijt\n\u00fe \ndid\nDIDijt\n\u00fe vijt\nIn Eq. (9), i stands for the individual, t for years, j represents categories of regions,\ntreatment group, Male for the male dummy variable, a is the constant term, and v is\nthe error term.  represents the estimated coefficient for each variable.\nWe used the retrospective data of CHIP1995 to gain wages information for the previ-\nous five years and generated several treatment groups and control groups.9 Specifically,\nation years. We distinguish the treatment group and control group.\nWe sampled districts with relatively large gender wage gaps in the initial years before\nthe implementation of the MW and relatively high MW levels (where the value of Kaitz\nindex is higher) during the implementation years as the simulation treatment groups. It\nis thought that the MW should provide the largest effect to this group. For example,\nusing the 1990\u00ad1995 data, we defined Henan province as a treatment group because\nthe gender wage gap is largest in 1990, as the ratio of female and male wage is\ndistricts with relatively small gender wage gaps during the initial years and a MW\nlevel lower than that of the treatment group in the policy implementation years as\na control group. In this case, the MW should have the smallest effect on these\ngroups. Since 1993, MW was implemented across all districts in China; therefore,\nwe cannot treat a non-implementation district as a treatment group (this is the\nstrict definition). Accordingly, we defined the treatment groups as the district most\nimpacted by the MW implementation.10\nHere, the DID item is the cross term of the three items used--male, the policy\nimplementation years and treatment group (Male * Year * Treat). If the estimated\ncoefficient of DID is statistically significant, it indicates that the implementation of\nthe MW has an effect on gender wage gap. If the estimated coefficient is a nega-\ntive value, it shows that the MW system has some effect on reducing gender wage\ngap, and vice versa.\nsurveys of the CHIP conducted by NBS, Economic Institute of CASS and Beijing\nNormal University, including respective information about employment and wages of\nurban residents.

Considering the retirement system of the state-owned sector, to reduce\nthe effect of that system on the analysis result, the analytic objects are limited in the\ngroups to between the ages of 16 and 60.\nIn the wage function, the explained variable is the logarithm of the monthly wage,14\nand the explaining variables are the variables likely to affect the wage, such as educa-\ntion (primary school or below, junior high school, senior high school/vocational school,\ncollege, university15 and above), experience years,16 ownership (state-owned enterprises,\ncollectively owned enterprises, foreign/private enterprises), occupation (manager, tech-\nnician, clerk, manual worker), industry (agriculture, fishing & forestry, manufacturing,\nmining, construction, transportation/communication, wholesale, retail, and catering,\nreal estate, health and social welfare, education, culture, and arts, financial industry,\npublic management and social organizations, and other industries).\nWe apply the Chinese National Minimum Wage Databases to classify the regions by\nthe MW level, as shown in Table 1.

These calculations show that in 1995, females' wages were\nconsiderably lower than the MW level compared with those of males; in 2002 and\n2007, in contrast, males' wages were considerably lower than the MW level compared\nwith those of females.\n6 Econometric analysis results\n6.1 Estimated results of gender wage gaps in regions with different MW\nTable 3 shows the estimated gender wage gaps by the regional groups.

In the middle MW region, the gender wage gap is smallest, with an estimated\nSecond, the main results using the QR model are as follows.

Conversely, in all regional groups whose wage distributions are greater\nover the 6th quantile, the male dummy coefficients are statistically significant at 1% or\nTable 1 Regional classification by the MW levels\nLow-MW region Mid-MW region High-MW region\nregions Shanxi, Anhui, Shichuan,\nYunnan, Gansu\nJiangsu, Hernan, Hubei Beijing, Liaoning\nregions Shanxi, Hernan, Shichuan,\nGansu\nLiaonin, Anhui, Hubei,\nYunnan\nBeijing, Jiangsu,\nGuangdong\nregions Anhui, Hubei, Yunnan, Gansu Shanxi, Liaonin, Hernan,\nGuangdong, Shicuan\nBeijing, Jiangsu\nNote: Chinese National Minimum Wage Database\n5%, which indicates that the gender wage gap in these wage distribution intervals are\nobvious. However, as the wage level increases, the gender wage gap narrows accord-\ningly, which shows that, except for groups with an extremely low-wage distribution, the\nTable 2 Statistical descriptions\nMale Female F-M Male Female F-M Male Female F-M\nEducation\nOwnership\nOccupation\nIndustry\nPublic administration and social\norganizations\nNotes:\n1) the gender wage gaps = female wage mean values/male wage mean values\n2) the gender gaps of another variables = female variable mean values-male variable mean values\ngender wage gaps in the low-wage distribution groups are greater than are those in\nmiddle- and high-wage distribution groups, i.e., there is the sticky floor phenomenon.\n(2) In high MW and middle MW regions in 1995, the gender wage gaps at the 1st and\n3rd quantiles are not statistically significant. In 2007, however, an obvious gender wage\ngap at the 3rd quantile emerges. This may be because the proportion of females with\nwages lower than the MW level is greater than that of males in the early state of the\nimplementation of the MW (see Fig. 1).\nFig. 2 Proportions of Males and Females with Wages below MW Levels. Note: Calculated results shown in\nfig. 1 are the ratios of the workers whose monthly wage is below the MW level to the total workers in each\nFig. 3 Gender Gap and the Difference between Wage and MW Levels.

Wages in three periods are adjusted by CPI.\n6.2 Impact of MW level on males and females' wage\nTo compare the effects of MW level and Kaitz Index on males and females' wage, we\nmade the estimation by Model 1 (MW level model) and Model 2 (Kaitz Index model).\nThe analysis results were obtained with OLS and the quantile regression model. The\nsimulation results are shown in Fig. 4.\nSeen from the estimated results of average value, if the MW level rises by 1 yuan, the\nincrease of males and females' average wages are 3.2 yuan and 2.7 yuan, respectively,\nshowing that the rise in the MW level has a slightly greater effect on males' average\nwage than on females' average wage. Seen from the estimated results of the wage quan-\ntile, only in the extreme low-wage distribution (e.g., 1st and 3rd quantile groups) does\nthe rise in the MW standard have a slightly greater effect on females' average wages\nTable 3 Results of gender wage gaps in regions with different MW levels\nTotal High MW region Middle MW region Low MW region\nCoeff.

However, the opposite is the case in groups of other\nwage quantiles (e.g., the groups at middle/high wage levels); particularly in the high-\nwage group (e.g., the group in the 90th quantile wage), the rise in the MW level has\ngreater effect on males' wages.\n6.3 Decomposition results of gender wage gaps\nThe results in Fig. 4 above show that the effect of the MW level on male and female\nwage levels differ from one another. To understand further the impact of the MW level\non gender wage gap, we conducted the decomposition analysis for the gender wage gap\nby using the Oaxaca-Ransom decomposition model. Considering that the Kaitz Index\nmay affect the gender wage gap, we also provide the decomposition result based on\nKaitz Index. See the decomposition result in Table 4.\nAbove all, seen from the overall decomposition result, the effect of a difference\nin endowment return on gender wage gap is greater than that of endowment dif-\nferentials. For example, in 1995, the difference in endowment return is 57.0% and\n63.5%. The analysis result based on Kaitz Index also shows that, in both 1995 and\n2007, the differences in endowment return are greater than endowment differen-\n2007, the effect of differences in endowment return has increased. The increase in\nimpact of differences in endowment return on gender wage gap shall be brought\nto the forefront because one of its causes lies in the increase in terms of effect of\ngender discrimination.\nNow, we discuss the effect of MW level on gender wage gaps. In 1995, the endow-\nment difference of the MW was 0.7%, and the difference in endowment return of the\nMW was -12.5%, showing that the gender wage gap is caused by that proportion of\nmales in the regions whose relatively high MW level is greater than those of females.\nThe reason that the impact of the MW level on wage is greater for females than for\nmales comes from the narrowing of the gender wage gap. Compared with the situation\nlevel is -3.0%, and its difference in endowment return is 8.7%. These numbers show\nthat the reason that the proportion of workers in the regions with relatively high MW\nlevel is greater for females than for males is the narrowing of the gender wage gap, and\nFig. 4 Impact of MW Level on Males and Females' Wages.

In 2007, both the endowment difference and differ-\nence in endowment return of the MW level are positive values, i.e., 1.2% (endowment\ndifference) and 8.1% (difference in endowment return). These differences reveal that\nfor both factors, the proportion of workers in the regions with relatively high MW level\nis greater for males than for females and that the MW level has greater impact on\nwages for males than for females, affecting the gender wage gap. The decomposition\nresults of all three periods show that the gender difference in terms of the effect of the\nMW level on the wage (difference in endowment return) has a greater effect than\nthe gender difference of the distribution in the regions with different MW levels\n(endowment difference).\nFinally, we discuss the effect of the Kaitz Index on gender wage gap. In 1995, the\nendowment difference of the Kaitz Index is -1.3% and the difference in endow-\nment return of the Kaitz Index is 86.6%. These results reveal that the reason that\nthe proportion of workers in the regions with a relatively high Kaitz Index is\ngreater for males than females is the narrowing gender wage gap, and the gender\nwage gap is caused by the Kaitz Index having a greater effect on wages for males\nthan for females. In 2002, the direction of the Kaitz Index has an effect on gender\nwage gap similar to that in 1995; for example, the endowment difference of the\nKaitz Index is -1.8% and the difference in endowment return of the Kaitz Index is\n24.0%. Note that, compared with 1995, the reason that the Kaitz Index has a\ngreater effect on wages for males than for females is that its effect decreased. In\n2007, both the endowment difference and difference in endowment return of the\nKaitz Index are negative values, i.e., -0.5% (endowment difference) and -16.8%\n(difference in endowment return). These changes have two causes: the proportion\nof females in the regions with relatively higher MW level is greater than that of\nmales, and the Kaitz Index has greater effect on females' wage level, thus having\nan effect on narrowing the gender wage gap. The decomposition results of all three\nperiods show that the gender difference in terms of the effect of the Kaitz Index on the\nwage (difference in endowment return) has a greater effect than does the gender differ-\nence of distribution in regions with different Kaitz Indexes (endowment difference).\n6.4 DID analysis results of gender wage gaps\nTo further examine the effects of the MW implementation on gender wage gap, we also\nconducted DID analysis. See Table 5 (OLS) and Table 6(QR) for these results.\nFirst, the effects of the MW on gender wage gap varied by period (Table 5). For ex-\nimplementation contributed to narrowing the gender wage gap. However, in other\ngap are statistically insignificant. These results indicate that the MW implementation\ncontributes to narrowing the gender wage gap in the long term, but this effect is not\nobvious in the short term.\nSecond, the MW has a more noticeable effect on narrowing gender wage gap in\nlow-wage and mid-wage groups (Table 6) in comparison with high-wage groups.\nHowever, the MW has a more significant effect on narrowing gender wage gap in\nthe low-wage group, which is possibly because that increase of MW level has the\nlargest influence on wages of people in a low-wage group (i.e., at slightly higher or\nlower than MW level). Therefore, if there are more female than male workers at\napproximately the MW level, the increase of the MW level can narrow a gender\nwage gap. Figure 1 shows that, in three periods, the proportion of workers having\nwages lower than the MW level is greater for females than males. The related\nMW contribute to narrowing the gender wage gap of mid-wage groups? It may be due to\nthe spread effect brought by a wage increase for low-wage groups (this effect is called \"the\nspillover effect\" of the MW); in other words, the wage of mid-wage groups will go up\nwhen that of low-wage groups goes up. The analysis results indicate that, in China's urban\nlabor market, the increased MW level has influenced not only the lower-wage workers\nwhose wage approaches the MW level but also wage levels to a significant extent.\nTable 5 DID analysis results--based on OLS estimations\nThe initial years: 1990 Coeff.

Conversely, the\nChinese government has been officially implementing the MW system since 1993. The\nimplementation of the MW policy contributes to increasing incomes of low-wage\ngroups. Therefore, if the proportion of workers with wages lower than the MW level is\ngreater for females than for males, the MW may narrow gender wage gap. This paper\nprovides evidence on whether the MW has had an effect on gender wage gaps in urban\nFirst, by the descriptive statistical analysis, we had the following two findings. (1) In\nwas greater for females than for males. (2) The gaps between wages and the MW level\nfor males and females are different during three periods. In addition, the local MW\nlevels in different regions influence males and females' wages differently.\nSecond, the gender wage gap is largest in regions with high MW levels, and smallest\nin regions with middle MW levels. Although the gender wage gap is not obvious at the\nextremely low-wage distribution (e.g., in the 1st quantile), in wage distributions in\nwhich quantile is higher than 6th, the gender wage gap tends to narrow with increasing\nwage levels, showing that there is a sticky floor phenomenon.\nFurthermore, the decomposition results using the Oaxaca-Ransom model show that\ngender differences in returns on endowments in the MW levels and Kaitz Index have a\ngreater influence on gender wage gap, in comparison with gender differences in\nendowments.\nFinally, the results obtained by DID analysis model show that, in the long term,\nimplementation of a MW system contributes to narrowing gender wage gap and that\nsuch an effect in a low-wage group is more significant than that in a high wage group.\nHowever, that effect is not obvious in the short term.\nAlthough according to these empirical analysis, we can conclude that the MW imple-\nmentation contributes to narrowing gender wage gap in the long term, there are three\npoints worthy of attention. First, the analysis results show that MW started to contrib-\nute to narrowing the gender wage gap after the MW system had been implemented for\ninfluenced during a shorter period of implementation of this system. Why does the\nlong-term effect differ from the short-term effect? It is necessary to extend the analysis\nin the future. This may be because we could only use the quasi-DID model instead of\nTable 6 DID analysis results-based on quantile regression estimations (Continued)\ngroup\nNote:\nl. The other variables such as education, experience years,han race,married are also estimated\n2. SE values are showed in ( )\nthe real DID analysis model. Second, the MW system has a greater influence on gender\nwage gap at an extremely low-wage distribution, which may be related to a greater pro-\nportion of females at the low-wage distribution. To further analyze the causes of gender\nwage gap at the low-wage distribution is a promising area of issues for discussion, such\nas an in-depth investigation of females' poverty.\nThird, although this paper only discusses the MW effect on gender wage gaps, there\nmay be gender gap effects of unemployment and informality (Hunt 2002; Muravyev and\nOshchepkov 2013).17There are many factors influencing female labor participation such\nas household structure, macro-economic environment, firm recruitment, and employ-\nment system, so detailed empirical studies on this issue should be done in the future.\nEndnotes\n1For other empirical studies on the gender wage gap that don't focus on the MW\n2Regarding the debate on the MW employment effect in the 1980s, it is indicated that\nthere is a negative significant but modest -1% to -3% employment effect (Brown, et al.,\nBurkhauser et al. (2000) also found results consistent with the standard model predic-\ntion of a negative employment effect. On the other hand, using panel data to conduct\nand Krueger (1995) pointed out that there are no unemployment effects. Similarly,\nthere is no consensus on the effect of MW on employment.\n3We apply Chinese National Minimum Wage Databases to classify the regions by the\nMWLevel; the regions are shown in Table 1.\n4Another approach to investigating regional differences in the gender wage gap is to\nuse the cross term of males and regions. However, such an approach compares based\non the assumption that there is the same endowment of human capital in each region,\nwhich allows for variables with assumptions but is not very realistic. We therefore relax\nthe limiting conditions to estimate by region groups. Anyone who is interested in the\nresults of using cross term may contact the author directly.\n5The Oaxaca-Blinder composition method can be expressed with the following two\nequations. Please note that the coefficient estimates and average of variables used in\n\u00bc \nm\nXm\n-Xf\n\u00fe \nm\n-\nf\n \nXf\n\u00bc \nf\nXf\n-Xm\n\u00fe \nf\n-\nm\n \nXm\n6Strictly speaking, the decomposition value here does not represent discrimination as\na whole because it also contains a part of the gap resulting from some interpreted\nvariables that cannot be observed, for example, working attitude and abilities.\n7The Kaitz index is defined as the ratio of the MW to the average wage of the\nworking population.\n8Please note that we can use only the quasi-DID model rather than the real DID\nmodel. The main reason is that the Chinese government published the Minimum Wage\nRegulations for Enterprises in 1993, and the MW policy was carried out in all regions\n(provinces) covered by the CHIP survey. In other words, we cannot find the real con-\ntrol group (the province in which the MW is not implemented during two compared\nperiods). Therefore, we applied this alternative method.\nexperiment model, the use of multiple treatment groups and multiple comparison\ngroups is the development direction of future quasi-natural experiments. Based on that\nstatement, this paper has made full use of the characteristics of CHIP data and selected\nmultiple treatment groups and control groups when applying the DID method.\n11There may be representative error when make the master sample by consolidating\nthe data in each region. Therefore, the weight can be used for adjustment. However, it\nis not applied in this paper, first, because CHIP is applied by the NBS according to a\nnational survey sample. It is a stratified multiple stage sample in which the master sam-\nple consolidating error arising from the difference in sample number in regions can be\nforecast to be very small. Second, according to the calculation of Li and Song (2013),\nand CHIP2007 are used as the weight. The adjusted results are the same as the results\nwithout being adjusted. Moreover, no relevant data against CHIP1995 can be used to\ncorrect it. For more details regarding this point, please see Li and Song (2013, note 1).\n12According to the MW Article published in 1993, the main content of the MW con-\nsist of total earnings from work (except the overtime hours subsidy), any risk job sub-\nsidy and social security subsidy. We cannot distinguish the detail subsidy items from\nCHIP data. We also made an analysis using the basic wage. The results are similar to\nthe results using the total wage. Therefore, we show the results using total wage in this\npaper. The earnings data does not include unofficial payments, and if such payments\nare more likely to be made to men, the gender wage gap will be underestimated.\n13We calculated the total values of the material objects and added them to wage\naccounts.\n14There are two reasons for using the logarithm of monthly wage as the explained\nvariable.First, there is only monthly wage information in the CHIP 2007; therefore, we\nfor a regular worker in each region is defined based on a monthly wage. The data of\nthe urban worker in the CHIP we use is dominated by regular worker data, so we per-\nform the analysis by taking the regular worker as the object according to the MW\nstandard based on monthly wage. Therefore, we use the corresponding logarithm of\nthe monthly wage as the explained variable in the wage function.\n15In China, college courses are for three years whereas university courses are over\nfour years.\n16Experience years \u00bc age \u00ad years of education\n17Hunt (2002) shows that with a fall in the gender wage gaps, the unemployment of\nlow-skilled women increased in Germany. Muravyev and Oshchepkov (2013) further\nindicates the effects of MW on the informality and unemployment in Russian regions.\nCompeting interests\nThe IZA Journal of Labor & Development is committed to the IZA Guiding Principles of Research Integrity.
