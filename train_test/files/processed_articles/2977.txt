Previous studies suggest that non-Hispanic blacks have higher levels of se-\nrumcotininethannon-Hispanicwhiteswhoreportsimilarlevelsofcigarettesmoking.\nObjective.--To investigate differences in levels of serum cotinine in black, white,\nand Mexican American cigarette smokers in the US adult population.\nParticipants.--A nationally representative sample of persons aged 17 years or\nolder who participated in the survey.\nOutcome Measures.--Serum cotinine levels by reported number of cigarettes\nsmoked per day and by race and ethnicity.\nResults.--A total of 7182 subjects were involved in the study; 2136 subjects re-\nported smoking at least 1 cigarette in the last 5 days. Black smokers had cotinine\nconcentrations substantially higher at all levels of cigarette smoking than did white\nor Mexican American smokers (P.001). Serum cotinine levels for blacks were\nMexican Americans. These differences do not appear to be attributable to\ndifferences in environmental tobacco smoke exposure or in number of cigarettes\nsmoked.\nConclusions.--To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence from a\nnational study that serum cotinine levels are higher among black smokers than\namong white or Mexican American smokers. If higher cotinine levels among blacks\nindicate higher nicotine intake or differential pharmacokinetics and possibly serve\nas a marker of higher exposure to cigarette carcinogenic components, they may\nhelp explain why blacks find it harder to quit and are more likely to experience higher\nrates of lung cancer than white smokers.\nFrom the National Center for Chronic Disease Pre-\nvention and Health Promotion (Drs Caraballo, Giovino,\nPechacek, Richter, Sharp, and Eriksen) and the Na-\ntional Center for Environmental Health (Dr Pirkle), Cen-\nters for Disease Control and Prevention, and Batelle\nMemorial Institute (Messrs Mowery and Strauss), At-\nlanta, Ga; and the National Center for Health Statistics,\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, Bethesda,\nMd (Dr Maurer).\nReprints: Ralph S.

Previous\nstudies1-4 have suggested that non-His-\npanic blacks have higher levels of serum\ncotininethandonon-Hispanicwhiteswho\nreportsimilarlevelsofcigarettesmoking.\nThe interpretation of the results in these\nstudies has been subject to debate, how-\ngested that differences between levels\nof serum cotinine in non-Hispanic black\nsmokers and non-Hispanic white smok-\ners are attributable, at least in part, to\nracial differences in nicotine metabolism\nor elimination. Others5 believe that such\ndifferences are attributable to other vari-\nables, including differences in the type\nof cigarette smoked (length of cigarette,\nmentholornonmenthol,filterornonfilter,\nand nicotine yield) and differences in how\nthe cigarettes are smoked (blocking ven-\ntilation holes by fingers or lips, frequency\nand depth of inhalation, retention time of\nsmoke in the lungs, and percentage of\navailable tobacco smoked). Serum coti-\nnine differences by race have also been\nattributed to differences in the accuracy\nof cigarette smoking self-reports2,9-12 and\nCotinine is widely applied as a marker\nof both tobacco use and exposure to en-\nvironmental tobacco smoke (ETS) be-\ncause it has a longer half-life (average, 18\nto 20 hours) than nicotine does (average,\n2 to 3 hours). On average, a cigarette\nsmokerabsorbsabout1mgofnicotineper\nblood nicotine concentration after smok-\ning a single cigarette ranges from 0.031\nIn adult smokers, a nicotine intake of\napproximately 1 mg can be estimated\nfrom a blood cotinine level of 71 nmol/L\n(12.5 ng/mL) using a conversion factor of\nunder steady-state conditions.14 The co-\n\u00a91998 American Medical Association.

The nationally representa-\ntive sample of the eligible population\nsurveyed during phase 1 permitted cal-\nculation of national estimates.\nSubjects and Demographics\nOur study sample was limited to par-\nticipants aged 17 years or older who de-\nscribed themselves as non-Hispanic\nblacks, non-Hispanic whites, or Mexican\nAmericans, who had a serum cotinine\nmeasurement and provided tobacco use\ninformation in the MEC, and who did not\nuse any other significant sources of nico-\npersons selected, 2271 refused the inter-\ndidnotvisittheMECs;281didnotanswer\nthe MEC tobacco questionnaire; 682 had\nno cotinine measurement; 434 reported\nusing other significant sources of nicotine\nthan non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nblack, and Mexican American.

In addition, one of the\nfamily members was asked how many\nrooms were in the home, excluding bath-\nrooms. The number of rooms in the home\nwas categorized as 1 to 4 or 5 or more.\nPersons aged 17 years or older who re-\nported having a job or business were also\naskedhowmanyhoursperdaytheywere\nclose enough to tobacco smoke at work\nthattheycouldsmellthesmoke.Thenum-\nber of hours exposed to ETS at work was\ncategorized as 0, 1 to 3, or 4 or more. Data\nwerealsocategorizedbyregionasNorth-\neast, North Central, South, or West, ac-\ncording to standard US Bureau of the\nCensus definitions.\nThe MEC tobacco questionnaire asked\nparticipants: \"How many cigarettes have\nyousmokedinthepast5days?\"Asmoker\nwas defined as a person who reported\nsmoking 1 cigarette or more during the\nprevious 5 days. The average number of\ncigarettessmokedperdaywascalculated\nand used for the analyses.\nSerum Cotinine Measurement\nBiochemical determination of tobacco\nexposurewasperformedbymeasuringse-\nrumcotininelevelsinbloodspecimensob-\ntained by venipuncture in the MEC. The\ncotinine assay involved isotope dilution,\nliquid chromatography, and tandem mass\nspectrometry.24 As in the study by Pirkle\nand colleagues,13 we used cutoff points of\nnmol/L (15 ng/mL) or less of cotinine in\nserum to designate active tobacco users\nand nontobacco users, respectively.\nCotinine data were originally re-\nported in nanograms per milliliter. A\nconversionfactorof5.67wasusedtocon-\nvert cotinine levels in nanograms per\nmilliliter to cotinine levels in nanomoles\nperliter,basedonamolecularweightfor\n0.006 was used to convert nicotine levels\npreviously reported in nanograms per\nmilliliter to nicotine levels in micro-\nmoles/liter, based on a molecular weight\nStatistical Analysis\nDeterminationofserumcotininelevels\nby race and ethnicity involved fitting a\nseries of nonlinear exponential regres-\nsion models of the form: ln(cotinine)\nO) + error,whereln(co-\ntinine) is the natural logarithm of serum\ncotinine; O is the number of self-reported\ncigarettes smoked per day; 0\nare parameters that describe the expo-\nnential relationship; and error is the\nresidual error left unexplained by the\nmodel.Thisexponentialmodelfacilitated\nmodeling serum cotinine as a monotoni-\ncallyincreasingfunctionofthenumberof\ncigarettessmoked,withcotinineincreas-\ning at a decreasing rate toward an upper\nasymptote. The variable 0\nrepresents\nthe upper bound (maximum achievable\nlevel) of ln(cotinine) at the highest levels\nof daily smoking, and 2\nrepresents the\nrateatwhichcotinineincreaseswithcon-\nsumption. The quantity (0\n) repre-\nsents the expected ln(cotinine) at a con-\nsumption level of 0 cigarettes per day.\nPriortomodelfitting,wedividedtheself-\nreported number of cigarettes smoked in\nthe last 5 days by 5 and rounded to the\nnearest integer.

In\nterms of sociodemographic character-\nistics, Mexican American smokers dif-\nferedfromotherracialandethnicgroups\nof smokers more than either their white\nor black counterparts.\nAmong self-reported smokers, both\nblacksandwhiteshadserumcotininelev-\nels consistent with their reported smok-\ning levels (Table 2). Therefore, among\nblacks and whites, the ability of the bio-\nchemicalmeasurementtodetectsmokers\nand nonsmokers was similar. Self-re-\nported Mexican American smokers were\nless likely than blacks or whites to have\nserum cotinine levels consistent with\ntheir reported smoking levels. Self-re-\nported nonsmokers (97.9% of blacks,\nAmericans) had biochemically assessed\ncotinine threshold levels consistent with\ntheir reported smoking levels.\nSelf-reported and biochemically as-\nsessedsmokingprevalencesamongblacks\nhigher than Mexican Americans (27.0%,\n20.1%) (results not shown). Although\nblacks were as likely to have smoked in\nthe past 5 days as whites, they reported\nsmoking fewer cigarettes per day than\nwhites (Table 3). Mexican Americans\nsmokedfewercigarettesperdaythandid\neither blacks or whites.\nStatistics and Modeling\nFitting a nonlinear exponential unad-\njusted regression model (Figure) to de-\ntermine the relationship between serum\ncotinine levels and self-reported ciga-\nrette smoking showed that cotinine con-\ncentrations were substantially higher\namong black smokers than among white\nor Mexican American smokers at all lev-\nels of cigarette smoking. Whites and\nMexican Americans had similar serum\ncotinine levels when they smoked up to 5\ncigarettes per day, but serum cotinine\nlevels increased significantly more for\nwhites than for Mexican Americans with\neach additional cigarette smoked.

For whites, the number of\nhoursofETSexposureatwork,sex,age,\nthe number of smokers living in the\nhome, and body weight were of descend-\ning importance in explaining signifi-\ncantly reduced variability of serum\ncotinine levels. And for Mexican Ameri-\ncans, 2 covariates were responsible for\nreducing this variability: the number of\nhours of ETS exposure at work and the\nnumber of smokers living in the home.\nCOMMENT\nThis study provides the first evidence\nfrom a national study that black smokers\nhavehigherserumcotininelevelsthando\nwhite or Mexican American smokers, af-\nter adjustment for the number of ciga-\nrettes smoked per day, age, sex, body\nweight, number of smokers living in the\nhome, and number of hours exposed at\nworktoETS.Ourfindingisconsistentwith\nthe results of previous smaller studies1-4\nthat have found that blacks have higher\nserum cotinine levels than whites do at\nsimilarlevelsofself-reportedsmoking,but\ndiffersfromthatof1previousreport12 sug-\ngesting that Mexican Americans derive\nmorecotininepercigarettethanwhitesdo.\nThe analysis in our study was limited\nbythelackofdataonthetypeofcigarette\nsmoked (eg, menthol vs regular or filter\nvs nonfilter), smoking topography (eg,\ndepth of inhalation or vent blocking),\nor nicotine pharmacokinetics. Previous\nstudies have assessed the contribution of\nsome of these factors (eg, the use of men-\ntholatedornonmentholatedcigarettes)to\nserum cotinine levels among black smok-\ners and white smokers. Some of these\nof mentholated cigarettes have higher\nlevels of serum cotinine than smokers\nof nonmentholated cigarettes; others3,29\nhave reported no significant differences.\ngenknecht and colleagues found that the\neffect of mentholation on serum cotinine\nforwhitesmokers;neitherdifferencewas\nstatistically significant. The authors con-\ncluded that higher serum cotinine levels\nin black smokers of mentholated ciga-\nrettes explained part but not all of the ra-\ncial difference in serum cotinine levels. In\naddition to considering the mentholation\nof cigarettes, these authors adjusted the\nresults for nicotine content of the ciga-\nrette,inhalationfrequency,howfarsmok-\ners let their cigarette burn when they\nsmoked, and weekly exposure to side-\nstream smoke from the burning end of a\ncigarette. The serum levels of thiocya-\nnate, a metabolite of cyanide that reflects\nexposure to tobacco smoke, were similar\nfor the groups when the results were ad-\njusted for the number of cigarettes\nsmoked per day. This finding suggests\nthat the higher cotinine levels found\namongblackswerenottheresultofinhal-\ning more smoke than whites do.7\nSerum cotinine differences between\nblacksmokersandwhitesmokershavealso\nbeen suggested to be attributable to dif-\nferential reports of the number of ciga-\nrettes smoked. Although we did not mea-\nsurethevalidityofthestudyparticipants'\nself-reports,wefoundnodifferencesinthe\nreliability of self-reports among blacks,\nwhites, and Mexican Americans.

If the study by\nClark et al can be generalized to the US\npopulation, it seems unlikely that report-\ning differences biased our results.\nWealsoconsidereddifferencesinself-\nreported exposure to ETS between the\n3 racial and ethnic groups. Even after\nadjustment of the results for number of\nsmokers living in the home, number of\nhours of ETS exposure at work, number\nof rooms in the home, and region of the\ncountrywheretheparticipantslived,the\ndifferences in the relationships between\nserum cotinine level and self-reported\ncigarette consumption for the 3 racial\ngroups remained statistically signifi-\ncant. A limitation of this measure, how-\never, is that it relies on self-reports, not\na precise ETS measurement. On the\notherhand,chamberstudyresults32 sug-\ngest that the ETS exposure generated\nby smokers smoking 10 different brands\nof US cigarettes is similar, thus provid-\ning no basis for believing differential\nbrand exposure could account for differ-\nencesobservedbetweenblackandwhite\nor Mexican American smokers.\nOur results documenting differences\nbetweentheserumcotininelevelsofblack\nsmokers and white smokers are consis-\nferencesinserumcotininelevelsbetween\nblacknonsmokersandwhitenonsmokers.\nIn these reports, blacks had higher coti-\nnine levels than whites, even after ETS\nexposure and other factors were taken\ninto account. For example, after adjust-\ning for self-reported levels of ETS expo-\nsure,Pirkleandcolleagues13 foundhigher\ncotinine levels for blacks than for whites\nor Mexican Americans among persons\naged 17 years or older.\nResultsfromourstudysuggestthatdif-\nferences in serum cotinine levels be-\ntween blacks and whites cannot be ex-\nplained by differences in reporting the\nnumber of cigarettes smoked or differ-\nences in ETS exposure. The differences\nmay be influenced by group-specific pat-\nternsofsmokingbehaviorandmayalsobe\ninfluencedbydifferencesinnicotinephar-\nmacokinetics and brand mentholation.\nFurther research is needed to clarify\nthe relationship between smoking prac-\ntices and serum cotinine levels in ethnic\ngroups in the United States. Although\nthere is no definitive explanation why\nblacksmokershavehigherserumcotinine\nlevels than both whites and Mexican\nAmericans, this finding is intriguing for 2\nreasons:(1)blacksmokersaremorelikely\ntotrytoquitbuthavealowersuccessrate\nthanwhitesmokers,36 and(2)blacksinthe\nUnited States are at higher risk than\nwhites of developing and dying from lung\ncancer.37 Whether higher serum cotinine\nconcentrations contribute to higher rates\nof nicotine addiction among blacks than\nwhites is unknown. If higher serum coti-\nnine levels serve as a marker of higher\nnicotine intake and absorption, they may\nhelp explain the lower quitting success\nrateamongblacksmokerscomparedwith\nwhite smokers. If higher serum cotinine\nlevels serve as a marker of higher expo-\nsure to other cigarette components such\nas carcinogenic constituents in cigarette\nsmoke,theymayhelpexplainhigherlung\ncancer deaths among black smokers com-\npared with white smokers.\nFuture research should focus on clari-\nfying the independent and interactive in-\nfluences of race and ethnicity, nicotine\nintake, nicotine pharmacokinetics, and\nnicotine addiction, as well as the relation-\nship between serum cotinine levels and\nthe risk for smoking-related diseases. At\npresent, it is not known whether the dif-\nferences in serum cotinine levels have\nimportant implications for smoking pre-\nvention strategies and public health.\nNonetheless, the racial or ethnic differ-\nences observed in this research provide a\nplausible basis for consideration of differ-\nent patterns of tobacco use and related\nhealth consequences.\nJyothi Nagaraja, MS, provided technical and\nprogramming support.
