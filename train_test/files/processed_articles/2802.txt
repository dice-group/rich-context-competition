In this research, we study the effect of HWT on the nutritional status of primary-aged children in India\nfemales) in 12,839 households from the second wave of the India Human Development Survey (IHDS-II).\nMethods: The IHDS-II is a nationally representative, household-based, comprehensive, and face-to-face survey.\nHouseholds were selected using stratified random sampling, and a team consisting of one male and one female\ninterviewer visited each household between November 2011 and October 2012. A knowledgeable member, typically\nthe male head of household, was interviewed about the socioeconomic condition of the household. An ever-married\nwoman between the ages of 15 and 49, typically the wife of the male head of household, answered questions related\nto education and health. The height and weight of all eligible household members were measured by interviewers.\nCorrelation between HWT and nutritional status was computed first, and the estimation of a generalized simultaneous\nequation model, in which a binary indicator of HWT and other covariates was included, was carried out afterward.\nResults: Bivariate analysis shows a negative association between the nutritional status of children and HWT. Additionally,\nfindings from the generalized simultaneous equation model demonstrate that HWT increases the probability of producing\nnormal-weighted primary-aged children by 1.7 %, while it decreases the probability of primary-aged children being thin\nby 2.5% and being severely thin by 1.7% in India.\nConclusions: This study indicates that HWT has the potential to advance the nutritional status of primary school-aged\nchildren in India.\n",

As a developing\ncountry with the world's fastest growing major economy\n[1] as well as the second largest population, poor water\nquality has been an ongoing problem [2, 3] in India be-\ncause the country lacks water-treatment facilities that can\nhandle the pollution caused by rapid industrialization and\nurbanization [4]; open defecation in many areas without\nsanitation infrastructure exacerbates the problem [5]. The\nnegative effects of water supply are of increasing concern\nfor people and policy makers with regard to human health\nat regional and national levels [6\u00ad10]. Therefore, water\ntreatment is becoming particularly important in improv-\ning the quality of water for cooking or drinking and de-\ncreasing human-health risks. Considering the challenges\nand costs of managing the public water-supply infrastruc-\nture, household water treatment (HWT) has been\nregarded as an important and frontline procedure to\nachieve safe water supply in India [11].\nMalnutrition among children continues to be a critical\npublic-health issue in developing countries, and India is\nno exception. In fact, an estimated 39% of children be-\ntween the ages of 0\u00ad59 months were stunted, and 29%\nwere underweight, while 62.5% of the adolescent girls\naged 10\u00ad18 were severely or moderately thin between\npolicies and measures implemented to improve chil-\ndren's nutritional outcomes, children's nutritional status\nis still a serious and concerning public-health problem\nAs pointed out in the literature, drinking unclean\nwater is a major contributing factor to diarrhea, an ill-\nness that claims numerous children's lives in developing\ncountries because contaminated water contains patho-\ngenic bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can cause\ngastrointestinal diseases [15]. Moreover, diarrhea in-\ncreases malabsorption, in turn increasing the likelihood\nof malnutrition. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that\nwater quality in the household has a significant impact\non children's nutritional status in India.\nThe effect of water quality on children's risk of diar-\nrhea in India has been well documented [16\u00ad18].\nHowever, studies on the impact of water on children's\nnutritional status in India are relatively rare. One study\nfound that the quality of piped water positively\ninfluences 627 children's weight-for-age and weight-for-\nheight in Madras, India, but the magnitude and signifi-\ncance of this effect vary across age groups [19]. Another\nstudy has demonstrated the benefits of access to piped\nwater in the household on the nutritional status of\nprimary-aged children in India [7]. However, these two\nstudies have a common limitation: they rely on either\nquality of piped water [19] or access to piped water [7]\nas an indicator of the quality of domestic water supply,\nan approach we believe is problematic because, in con-\ntrast to the situation in developed countries, piped water\nis a questionable source of drinking or cooking water in\nIndia. For example, more than half of the pipes in rural\nareas in India deliver untreated water [20]. Therefore,\nthe effect of water quality on children's nutritional status\nin India has still not been clearly established.\nTo better understand the effect of water quality on\nchildren's nutritional status in India, this study uses indi-\nvidual-level data from the India Human Development\nSurvey (IHDS) to investigate whether HWT accom-\nplished by boiling, filtering via a purchased filter,\nusing an AquaGuard, or adding chemicals has signifi-\ncant effects on the nutritional status of primary-age\nchildren. Given the sanitation habits and infrastruc-\nture of water treatment in India, we believe that\nHWT is a more reasonable indicator of water quality\nin India than piped water.\nMethods\nData\nThe IHDS is a nationally representative, multi-topic sur-\nvey in India. Thus far, two IHDSs have been conducted:\nsurvey wave, a range of information about households\nand individuals was collected, including demographic\ncharacteristics, socioeconomic status, anthropometry,\nIHDS (IHDS-II) because it was the most recent round\nand the only one to include precise information about\nseveral variables used in our statistical analysis.\nThe IHDS-II used face-to-face interviews, and house-\nholds included in the IHDS-II were chosen using stratified\nrandom sampling. The interviewers asked a knowledgeable\nperson, typically the male head of household, questions re-\nlated to the socioeconomic status of the household (mem-\nbers), including questions related to income, employment,\nconsumption expenditure, and social capital. An ever-\nmarried woman between the ages of 15 and 49 in each\nhousehold was interviewed about health, education, family\nplanning, marriage, and gender relations in the household\nand community. Adolescents between the ages of 15 and\n18 were interviewed about their education, employment,\nmarriage, life skills, future planning, friendships, and risky\nconfidential behaviors. The IHDS-II interviewers also mea-\nsured and recorded he weights and heights of all eligible\nhousehold members during the interviews.\nhouseholds, but there were only 36,554 respondents be-\nthis sample were used in our study due to a lack of\ninformation on independent or dependent variables in\nsome observations.\nChildren's nutritional status\nIn line with the World Health Organization's (WHO)\nchild-growth standards, children's nutritional status in\nthis study was assessed by BMI (body mass index)-for-\nage z-scores, which are defined by the number of stand-\nard deviations that a child's BMI is above or below the\nmedian of BMI of the reference population provided by\nthe WHO/National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).\nIn other words, a child's BMI-for-age z-score was calculated\nusing the following formula:\nMeasured value of BMI-Median value of BMI of the reference group\nStandard deviation of BMI of the reference group\nAfter each individual child's z-score was computed,\nhis or her nutritional status is defined by one of the\nfollowing integer values: 1 (obese if z-score > 2), 2\n(overweight if 1< z-score  2), 3 (normal if -2  z-\n(severely thin if z-score < - 3).\nHousehold water treatment (HWT)\nTo measure if the water of a household in which a\nchild resides is treated, we created a dichotomous\nvariable (HWT) based on answers to this question\nfrom the IHDS-II: \"During a normal week, do you\never treat or purify your drinking water by boiling\nthe water OR by filtering the water with a purchased\nfilter OR by using AquaGuard OR by adding chemi-\ncals?\" Answers to this question are classified into four\ncategories with adjective descriptions: 1 (never), 2\n(rarely), 3 (usually), and 4 (always). HMT equals 1 if the\nanswer is 3 (usually) or 4 (always) and 0 if the answer is 1\n(never) or 2 (rarely).\nIncidence of diarrhea\nIt is impossible to achieve precise estimates of the mag-\nnitude and significance of the connection between HWT\nand children's nutritional status without taking the effect\nof diarrhea into consideration in light of the relationship\nbetween water quality and nutritional status described in\nthe background section. Hence, we created a binary indi-\ncator (diarrhea) based on answers to the following ques-\ntion from the IHDS-II: \"Have you had diarrhea in the\nlast 30 days?\" Answers to this question are classified as 1\n(yes) and 0 (no). Diarrhea equals 1 if the answer is yes\nand 0 if the answer is no.\nControlled variables\nSeveral variables were controlled for in our statistical\nanalysis, including number of children in the household,\nnumber of meals in the household per day, hours of TV\nwatching per day on an average day, gender (1 if male; 0\nif female), whether the household income is below the\npoverty line (1 if yes; 0 if no), dummies for the highest\neducation level of adults in the household (less than\nelementary school; elementary school; middle school),\ndummies for caste categories (Brahmin, Forward/General\n(except Brahmin), Other Backward Castes (OBC),\nScheduled Castes (SC), and Scheduled Tribes (ST)),\nwhether cooking is generally done outdoors (1 if yes; 0 if\nno), whether the household has a toilet (1 if yes; 0 if no),\nwhether hands are washed after defecating (1 if yes; 0 if\nno), and 32 state dummies. Table 1 shows the descrip-\ntive statistics for all variables in our analysis except the\nStatistical analysis\nOur statistical analysis was carried out in two steps.\nFirst, the association between children's nutritional\nstatus and HWT was examined to give us a rough\nidea of the empirical relationship between the two.\nTreating HWT as an indicator of water quality and\ngiven the relationship between water quality and nu-\ntritional status explained in the background section,\nthe effect of HWT on children's nutritional status can\nbe decomposed into direct effect (effect A in Fig. 1)\nof HWT and HWT's indirect effect via diarrhea (ef-\nfect B \u00d7 effect C in Fig. 1). In light of this decom-\nposition and to assess the effects of HWT, we\nsubsequently estimate a generalized simultaneous\nequation model, in which HWT, incidence of diar-\nrhea, and all confounding factors described in the\nprevious subsection were controlled, to assess the\neffects of HWT.\nThe generalized simultaneous equation model consists\nof two equations that define the relationship between\nHWT and diarrhea on one hand and diarrhea, HWT,\nand children's nutritional status (ni\n) on the other.\nMathematically, our generalized simultaneous equa-\ntion model is specified as follows:\nn\u00c3\ni\n\u00bc HWTi\n \u00fe Diarrheai\n \u00fe xi\n \u00fe i\nDiarrhea\u00c3\ni\n\u00bc HWTi\n \u00fe zi\n \u00fe i\nwhere n\u00c3\ni\nis an underlying latent variable representing\nan individual child i's propensity to be in a specific status\nof nutrition ni\n, which takes one of the following integer\nvalues: 1 (obese), 2 (overweight), 3 (normal), 4 (thin),\nand 5 (severely thin). Diarrhea\u00c3\ni\nis an underlying latent\nvariable representing an individual child i's propensity to\nhave diarrhea within the 30-day interval of the interview\ndate. Diarrheai\nequals 1 if Diarrhea\u00c3\ni\nwise. Variables , , , , and  are the regression param-\neters, and i\nand i\nare error terms that are assumed to\nfollow a multivariate logistic distribution. xi\nis the vector\nof independent variables that includes number of\nchildren in the household, number of meals in the\nhousehold per day, hours of TV watching per day on an\naverage day, whether the household income is below\nthe poverty line, the highest education level of adults\nin the household, dummies for caste categories, and\n32 state dummies. zi\nis the vector of independent\nvariables that includes whether the household in-\ncome is below the poverty line, dummies for caste\ncategories, whether cooking is generally done out-\ndoors, whether the household has a toilet, and\nwhether hands are washed after defecating. All\nparameters of interest, including , , ,  and , are\nestimated jointly using maximum likelihood. Given\nthat there are several binary regressors in the model,\nthe marginal effect of HWT on nutritional status\n(ni\n), the marginal effect of diarrhea on nutritional\nstatus (ni\n), and the marginal effect of HWT on diar-\nrhea were evaluated at a representative value of in-\ndependent variables and used to estimate effect A,\neffect B, and effect C, respectively (see Fig. 1). Table 1\nshows the summary statistics of all variables in our gener-\nalized simultaneous equation model.\nTable 1 Summary statistics of dependent and independent variables (N = 20,315)\nVariables Mean Standard Deviation\nNutritional status (ni\nHaving diarrhea in the last 30 days (Diarrheai\nHousehold water treatment (HWTi\nHighest education of adults in the household: less than elementary school (=1 if yes; =0 otherwise) 0.149 0.356\nHighest education of adults in the household: elementary school (=1 if yes; =0 otherwise) 0.536 0.499\nNote: the poverty line, which varies by state and urban/rural residence, is based on calculations of income needed to support minimal calorie consumption in\n1970s and was adjusted by price indices since then\nFig. 1 Connection between household water treatment (HWT) and children's nutritional status\nResults\nBivariate analysis\nTable 2 shows the distribution of our sample's nutri-\ntional status by HWT.

Additionally, a\nlower percentage of children with access to treated water\nhave a \"normal\" nutritional status (relative to those with-\nout such access). Overall, Table 2 shows there is a\nnegative association between HWT and nutritional sta-\ntus among primary-aged children in India.

Tables 4, 5, and 6 report the es-\ntimates of effect A, effect B, and effect C, respectively,\ndefined in Fig. 1, which is developed based on the rela-\ntionship between water quality and nutritional status\ndiscussed in the background section. As Table 4 shows,\nHWT increases the probability of having a normal\nweight, being overweight, and being obese by 1.7%, 1.3%,\nand 1.1%, respectively. However, it decreases the prob-\nability of being thin by 2.5% and severely thin by 1.7%.\nTable 5 shows that having diarrhea decreases the prob-\nability of having a normal weight, being overweight, and\nHowever, it increases the probability of being thin by 1.9%\nand severely thin by 1.4%, which is consistent with the fact\nthat diarrhea increases malabsorption, which was men-\ntioned in the background section. Table 6 shows that the\nimpact of HWT on diarrhea is very small and statistically\ninsignificant; hence, the indirect effect of HWT on nutri-\ntional status, which essentially mirrors what is reported in\nTables 5 and 6, is almost negligible when calculating the\ntotal effect of HWT on nutritional status. As a result, the\noverall impact of HWT on children's nutritional status\n(the sum of direct and indirect effects of HWT) reported\nin Table 7 is identical to those reported (effect A in Fig. 1)\nin Table 4. Based on the estimates reported in Table 7,\nchildren who consume water treated by boiling, filtering\nwith a purchased filter, using AquaGuard, or adding\nchemicals in the household were less likely to have poor\nnutritional status than other children in India.\nDiscussion\nMain findings of this study\nFirst, based on the average of HWT reported in Table 1,\nonly approximately 17.8% of children in our sample are\nreported to have access to safe drinking water, which is\nlow. Given that it has been reported that the use of\nHWT is related to household characteristics, such as\neducation level and income level [21\u00ad24], and our sam-\nple consists of a high percentage of poor households\nwith less-educated heads of household, this low percent-\nage is not a surprise.\nSecond, based on the results from our generalized sim-\nultaneous equation model, it was found that HWT\nwould decrease children's chances of being \"thin\" and\n\"severely thin,\" while it would increase, although the\neffect is smaller, their chances of being \"normally\nweighted,\" \"obese,\" or \"overweight\" in India. Therefore,\nthis study revealed that, in general, HWT increases chil-\ndren's nutrition level in India. Our results make sense\nfrom a chemistry and epidemiology point of view.\nAccording to studies in these two fields, HWT is effect-\nive in terms of controlling volatile disinfection by-\nproducts, which are responsible for unsafe drinking\nwater [25]. Additionally, treated drinking water by boil-\ning in the household had a low risk of containing ther-\nmotolerant coliform compared to untreated water [26],\nTable 4 Marginal effects of HWT on children's nutritional status\n(effect A) (from eq.

Moreover, HWT\nfilters are effective in the removal of turbidity and some\nAs mentioned in the background section, literature of\nthe relationship between water quality and nutritional\nstatus of children in India have a common limitation:\nthey rely on either quality of piped water [19] or access\nto piped water [7] as a measure of water quality, but\npiped water is a questionable source of drinking or cook-\ning water in India. Different from the literature, this\nstudy uses a more appropriate measure of water quality,\nwhich is HWT, to estimate the effect water quality on\nnutritional status of children in India, and hence a more\nprecise estimate is anticipated to be generated.\nLimitations\nThis study has certain limitations. First, although we\nconsidered as many control variables as possible, some\nimportant factors, such as residential area, were not con-\ntrolled for because they are presently restricted by the\nIHDS-II for public use. Furthermore, this research ex-\nplored the effect of general HWT on children's nutri-\ntional status and did not include modes of HWT in the\nanalysis due to data limitations. An analysis that takes\nthe modes of HWT into consideration will help us\nunderstand the difference in the efficiency of HWT with\nrespect to improving children's health in India once the\ndata are available in the future.\nConclusions\nIndia still lags behind the United Nations Millennium\nDevelopment Goals for childhood diarrhea and child\nmalnutrition [29]. This study indicates that HWT de-\ncreases the probability of malnutrition for children in\nIndia. The findings in this study have important implica-\ntions for the people and government of India. First,\nwhile HWT is effective, the Indian government should\ninvest more heavily in improving access to potable water,\nsuch as scaling up well-structured, continuous piped\nwater sources and improving access to HWT for families\ncurrently lacking reasonable-quality water supply. This is\nparticularly important among poor households and poor\nregions/states that are disproportionately burdened by\nchild malnutrition, morbidity, and mortality [30]. Fur-\nthermore, programs and policies are needed to commu-\nnicate the importance of treating drinking water in order\nto prevent waterborne illness and associated diarrhea\nand malnutrition [29].\nAbbreviations\nHWT: Household Water Treatment; IHDS: India Human Development Survey;\nNCHS: National Center for Health Statistics; WHO: World Health Organization\n"
