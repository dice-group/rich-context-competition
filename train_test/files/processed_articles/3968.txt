Although\ndiversity is often thought of in relation to students' back-\ngrounds and abilities (e.g., students receiving special educa-\ntion services, English language learners, culturally and\nlinguistically diverse students), variability is not limited to\nany particular category of students. Learner variability comes\nin many forms and applies to all students and includes indi-\nvidual and personal attributes of students that impact how\nthey experience schooling. For example, students process\ninformation in different ways and work at different paces.\nThey have varied family backgrounds, and bring different\nknowledge bases and experiences to class. Students vary in\ntheir approach to completing tasks (e.g., some find it easy to\ngenerate writing whereas others labor over the task), in the\nways they interact and communicate in class (e.g., some are\nreserved whereas others are more talkative), and in the ways\nthey organize and process information. In addition, Meyer,\nRose, and Gordon (2014) note that \"personal qualities and\nabilities continually shift, and they exist not within the indi-\nvidual but in the intersection between the individual and their\nenvironment, in a vast, complex, ever-changing dynamic\nbalance\" (p. 81). The existence of learner variability in any\ngiven classroom poses a complex set of factors for teachers\nto consider as they design instruction to meet the needs of all\nstudents. Developing lessons that align with grade-level aca-\ndemic standards while taking into account the varied needs\nof students is a common challenge for teachers.\nUniversal Design for Learning (UDL) is a framework for\ndesigning flexible instructional environments and proac-\ntively integrating supports that address learner variability.\nUDL is based on the premise that instruction can be accessi-\nble to a wider range of learners when lessons are intention-\nally designed to include multiple means for accessing,\nprocessing, and internalizing information (Rose & Gravel,\n2009). By considering the UDL guidelines during the lesson\nplanning phase, teachers can build in flexible pathways from\nthe outset, integrating elements that address the range of\nbackgrounds, preferences, abilities, and needs of their stu-\ndents and ensure that their lessons are comprehensible and\nengaging for all.\nDespite the fact that learner variability exists in all class-\nrooms, UDL-based lesson development does not compel the\nteacher to develop unique paths for each student's needs.\nBecause learner variability is both systematic and predict-\nable, teachers can reasonably predict some of the ways in\nwhich their students will vary and include flexible options\nthat will support a range of learners in any given class.\nTeachers can address variability by including flexible path-\nways within a lesson, which in turn proactively provide sup-\nports and scaffolds that take into consideration the diverse\nattributes of students.\n1University of Hawai'i at Mnoa, Honolulu, HI, USA\n2Center for Applied Special Technology, Wakefield, MA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nKavita Rao, Department of Special Education, College of Education,\nUniversity of Hawai'i at Mnoa, Wist 120, 1776 University Ave., Honolulu,\nEmail: kavitar@hawaii.edu\nUsing Universal Design for Learning to\nDesign Standards-Based Lessons\nKavita Rao1 and Grace Meo2\n Keywords\nspecial education, education, social sciences, curriculum, diversity and multiculturalism, teaching, students\n2 SAGE Open\nIn this article, we describe a process that teachers can use\nto develop standards-based lessons that address learner vari-\nability with UDL. By undertaking this process during the les-\nson planning phase, teachers can increase access for all\nlearners, including students with disabilities and culturally\nand linguistically diverse students. We describe how teachers\ncan (a) analyze and unwrap academic standards to determine\nthe core skills and concepts that they need to teach and (b)\napply UDL guidelines to the four lesson components--goals,\nassessments, methods, and materials. This process gives\nteachers a systematic way to design lessons that include flex-\nible pathway and supports to help students progress toward\nmastery of standards-based lessons.\nBackground on UDL\nThe UDL framework is based on three main principles of\nproviding multiple means of representation, action and\nexpression, and engagement (see Figure 1 for one-page over-\nview of the UDL framework). These three principles of UDL\nare based on brain research on cognition and learning, which\nhas shown that individuals process information in varying\nways. The first principle, multiple means of representation,\nis linked to the \"recognition\" networks of the brain. The sec-\nond principle, multiple means of action and expression, is\nlinked to the \"strategic\" networks, and the third principle,\nmultiple means of engagement, is linked to the \"affective\"\nnetworks (Meyer et al., 2014). When we acquire new skills\nand knowledge, these three networks interact, allowing us to\nrecognize, comprehend, internalize, express, and relate to the\ninformation we are learning. The UDL framework presents a\nstructure for designing instructional environments and activ-\nities that take into account the varied ways in which these\nlearning networks function for each individual.\nThe UDL framework presents a set of guidelines for inte-\ngrating flexible options into curriculum and instruction (see\nFigure 1) under the three domains of representation, action\nand expression, and engagement. UDL has nine guidelines\nand 31 \"checkpoints\" that provide greater definition on how\na teacher can build flexible pathways into a lesson (Hall,\nMeyer, & Rose, 2012). Educators can refer to the UDL\ncheckpoints as they design lessons, to intentionally consider\nand proactively build in strategies that support academic and\naffective needs of students (Israel, Ribuffo, & Smith, 2014).\nThe 31 checkpoints define how to provide physical access,\ncognitive access, and options for engagement. Physical\naccess refers to the representation of information and the for-\nmats by which students can receive/express information\n(e.g., vary the methods for response and navigation, offer\nalternatives for visual information). Cognitive access\nincludes the provision of supports and scaffolds to help stu-\ndents achieve instructional goals. For example, checkpoints\nFigure 1. Universal Design for Learning (UDL) guidelines version 2.0.\nRao and Meo 3\nunder the UDL Guideline \"Provide options for executive\nfunction\" (e.g., goal setting, supporting planning and strat-\negy development, and monitoring one's own progress) are\nexamples of methods to provide cognitive access. Some\ncheckpoints address strategies to foster student engagement\n(e.g., optimize individual choice and autonomy, heighten\nsalience of goals and objectives). The 31 UDL checkpoints\nprovide a menu of ideas of various scaffolds and options that\ncan be incorporated to make a lesson comprehensible and\nengaging for varied learners. The Center for Applied Special\nTechnology website (www.cast.org) has more information\non how the guidelines can be applied to instruction. An inter-\nactive graphic of the UDL framework version 2.0 can be\nfound on the National Center for Universal Design for\nLearning (NCUDL, 2010) website at http://www.udlcenter.\norg/aboutudl/udlguidelines.\nA research base on how UDL can be applied to curricu-\nlum and instruction has been emerging in the past decade. A\nreview of research studies on UDL in the classroom (Rao,\nOk, & Bryant, 2014) found that researchers have applied\nUDL to various levels of curriculum and instruction.\nResearchers have examined how UDL can be applied to\nteacher-developed lessons and curricula (Browder, Mims,\nSpooner, Ahlgrim-Delzell, & Lee, 2008; Dymond et al.,\nined academic outcomes and engagement with UDL-based\ndigital learning environments (Coyne, Pisha, Dalton, Zeph,\nRappolt-Schlichtmann et al., 2013). Studies have demon-\nstrated that UDL-based instruction results in positive aca-\ndemic gains and increased engagement for students.\nUDL focuses on the reduction of barriers in the learning\nenvironments to make lessons more inclusive for all students.\nTeachers can start by considering what the existing barriers are\nwithin a lesson and then develop an instructional plan that\nreduces those barriers by giving students various ways to\naccess and engage with instructional activities. By considering\nwhat the barriers are, teachers can build in supports from the\noutset rather than modifying lessons after the fact to address\nthe needs of learners. General educators and special educators\ncan use UDL to create standards-based lessons for inclusive\nclassroom settings (Meo, 2008).Although UDL-based lessons\nbroaden access for varied learners and build in supports that\ncan address a range of learner needs, it is worth noting that for\nsome students, additional accommodations and modifications\nmay also need to be made to address specific needs and objec-\ntives on their individualized education plans.\nAcademic Standards and UDL\nAcademic standards are commonly used to articulate shared\nexpectations of what students should learn as they progress\nthrough their schooling. Some countries have developed\nnational curriculum frameworks that include academic\nstandards and achievement objectives for elementary and\nsecondary grade levels. For example, Finland, Australia,\nand New Zealand have developed curriculum frameworks\nthat specify benchmarks and learning objectives (Sargent,\nHoughton, & White, 2011) to be addressed in each grade\nlevel across in core content areas. Curriculum frameworks\ngenerally include guidance in the inclusion of all students in\nstandards-based education, establishing an imperative to\ndesign standards-based instruction with necessary learning\nsupports for students with special educational needs.\nIn the United States, the Common Core State Standards\n(CCSS) were developed as a set of national standards that\nstates can choose to adopt. The CCSS is comprised of a com-\nmon set of learning targets for Grades K-12 in two main\ndomains, English language arts (ELA) and mathematics. In the\nCCSS, literacy is integrated across the content areas and con-\ntent areas such as social studies, science, and technical subjects\nare addressed under the ELA domain. The CCSS establishes a\nshared set of expectations that focused on achievement for all\nstudents, including students who receive services for special\neducation and English language learners (CCSS Initiative\n[CCSSI], 2015). The CCSS makes reference to UDL in the\ndocument titled \"Application to Students With Disabilities,\"\nwhich is available on the CCSS website (http://www.corestan-\ndards.org/about-the-standards/frequently-asked-questions).\nAligned with the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act\n(IDEA) mandate to ensure access to the general curriculum for\nstudents with disabilities, this document notes that the CCSS\ncan improve access to the rigorous academic content standards\nand identifies UDL as a means to create access, stating,\nPromoting a culture of high expectations for all students is a\nfundamental goal of the Common Core State Standards. In order\nto participate with success in the general curriculum, students\nwith disabilities, as appropriate, may be provided additional\nsupports and services, such as: Instructional supports for\nlearning-based on the principles of Universal Design for\nLearning (UDL) which foster student engagement by presenting\ninformation in multiple ways and allowing for diverse avenues\nof action and expression. (p. 1)1\nDesigning Standards-Based Lessons\nWith UDL\nAcademic standards are usually worded broadly, without being\nprescriptive about how to achieve the objectives defined within\n1The definition of UDL is taken from the from the Higher Education\nOpportunity Act (PL 110-135 as a scientifically valid framework\nfor guiding educational practice that (a) provides flexibility in\nthe ways information is presented, in the ways students respond\nor demonstrate knowledge and skills, and in the ways students are\nengaged; and (b) reduces barriers in instruction, provides appropri-\nate accommodations, supports and challenges, and maintains high\nachievement expectations for all students including students with\ndisabilities and students who are limited English proficient.\n4 SAGE Open\nthe standard. The CCSS presents broad goals and benchmarks\nand does not dictate the means by which the standard should be\nmet (Rose, Meyer, & Gordon, 2014). Teachers can design les-\nsons to meet the standards using strategies and resources of\ntheir own choice. As they develop instructional activities, they\ncan consider how to address standards and learner variability\nusing UDL. Whereas the academic standards highlight \"what\"\nstudents should learn, UDL can be used to identify \"how\" les-\nsons can be designed to minimize barriers and support students'\nmastery of standards-aligned goals.\nIn the following sections, we present a process for devel-\noping standards-based lessons, using UDL to increase\naccess for all learners. We provide an example of how this\nprocess can be applied to one standard. The process has two\nparts: (a) unwrapping the standard (Ainsworth, 2003) and\n(b) applying UDL guidelines to four lesson components dur-\ning the lesson planning process. This process can be used by\nteachers to develop standards-based lessons and to proac-\ntively integrate a variety of instructional supports that\naddress learner variability.\nUnwrapping Standards\nAcademic standards are written as broad goal statements that\nprovide the foundations for instruction by denoting the skills\nand knowledge that students should acquire each year. The\nwording of a standard can be complex and dense, incorporat-\ning multiple skills and concepts within one statement. The\nstandards are intended to guide instructional planning.\nHowever, because the standards are meant to be broad and\nprovide guidelines for what students should master, the\nwording often leaves room for teachers to analyze and inter-\npret the standard and design lessons accordingly. Teachers\ncan \"unwrap the standard\" to clarify the specific knowledge\nand skills they will address as they design lessons.\nAinsworth (2003) describes a process for coding or\n\"unwrapping\" the standards, breaking wording down into\ncomponent parts. Morgan et al. (2014) illustrate how a table\nwith two columns can be used to unwrap the standard, to iden-\ntify the core skills and concepts that need to be taught.Teachers\ncan use this unwrapped standard as the basis for defining\ninstructional goals and designing instructional activities.\nUnwrapping a standard consists of identifying two parts\nof the standard to determine what students need to do and\nknow. First, you identify the skills within the standard, by\nfinding words that denote what the student must be able to\ndo. Skills often correspond to the verbs in the standard,\nbecause verbs define the action required. Next, you identify\nthe key concepts, the knowledge and background that a stu-\ndent needs to have to complete the skill. Within the wording\nof a standard, the nouns and descriptive phrases often corre-\nspond to the concepts that students need to learn.\nFigure 2 illustrates how this process can be applied to\none CCSS ELA standard. The standard we unwrap in this\nexample is a CCSS ELA Literacy Writing standard (CCSS.\nIn the example, we have used bolded text to denote the\nskills and underlined the phrases that denote the concepts.\nThe example presents one way to unwrap this standard;\nindividuals may interpret the wording differently and feel\nthat other words and phrases denote skills/concepts within\nthe standard. It is acceptable to code the standards in varied\nways. The essence of the \"unwrapping\" process is to make\nsense of the wording of the standard by considering its\ncomponent parts to identify the core skills and concepts\nthat should be addressed.\nBy breaking down the standard and examining its compo-\nnent parts, the teacher can determine how to develop an\ninstructional plan that addresses the skills and concepts\nwithin the standard. In the example in Figure 2, by noting\ndown the verbs that denote the skills embedded in this stan-\ndard's wording, it becomes clearer that the standard addresses\ntwo skills, \"write narratives\" and \"develop experiences or\nevents.\" The unwrapped standard also highlights the con-\ncepts that students should develop and demonstrate through\na lesson that addresses this standard. Students will need to\nuse \"effective technique,\" incorporate \"descriptive details,\"\nand develop \"clear event sequences.\" After unwrapping the\nstandard, the teacher can consider how to develop lesson(s)\nthat support students as they progress toward mastery of the\nskills and concepts identified.\nApplying UDL to Lesson Components\nUDL can be applied to the four lesson components--goals,\nassessments, methods, and materials--in relation to the skills\nand concepts denoted in an academic standard. Regardless of\nthe various formats used for lesson plans, the lesson planning\nFigure 2. Example of how a CCSS ELA literacy writing standard\ncan be unwrapped. By unwrapping a standard, teachers can\nidentify the core skills and the concepts to address as they\ndesign a lesson. To begin unwrapping the standard, teachers can\nstart by highlighting and underlining keywords (in this example,\nthe skills are highlighted as bold text and the concepts are\nunderlined). CCSS = Common Core State Standards; ELA =\nEnglish language arts.\nRao and Meo 5\nprocess typically entails these common elements that corre-\nspond to the four lesson components: identifying lesson\ngoals and objectives that align to standards (goals), develop-\ning instructional strategies (methods), choosing resources\nand materials (materials), and assessing student progress and\noutcomes (assessment). Figure 3 illustrates the cycle of\ninstruction, denoting how academic standards can guide the\ndevelopment of goals, which, in turn, guide the development\nof assessments, methods, and materials.\nAfter unwrapping the academic standard, teachers can\nbegin the lesson planning process by reflecting on four key\nquestions listed in Table 1. Teachers can choose to apply\nUDL guidelines to one or more of the lesson components.\nThere is no prescriptive way to apply UDL; it is left to a\nteacher's discretion to add flexibility and options in ways\nthat are best suited to the standards and content being\naddressed. Knowing the needs of their students, teachers can\napply UDL guidelines in various ways to address their par-\nticular context. This process of designing lessons with UDL\ncan be applied to an individual lesson or a series of lessons;\nbecause standards are written as broad learning targets, it can\nrequire a series of lessons (e.g., a unit of instruction on a\ntopic) or various lessons over the course of several months or\nan academic year to address a specific standard.\nIn the sections below, we describe how UDL can be\napplied to goals, assessments, methods, and materials. In\nTable 2, we provide an example of the process, demonstrat-\ning how these four lessons components connect to one\nanother and to the academic standard being addressed by a\nlesson. In the example in Table 2, we refer to the ELA stan-\ndard unwrapped earlier (see Figure 1) and illustrate how a\nteacher can develop clear goal statements based on an\nunwrapped standard and subsequently reduce barriers by\nbuilding flexible pathways in the assessments, methods, and\nmaterials related to the goals.\nStep 1: Goals\nDeveloping clear goal statements is a first step to designing\nstandards-based lessons that are accessible for all learners.\nBy writing clear goal statements, teachers can articulate how\ntheir lesson objectives connect to the academic standard, and\nclearly define what they expect students to learn in a lesson.\nIn the process of identifying clear goals, teachers can con-\nsider potential barriers students may have when reaching the\ngoal and, as a result, include flexible options in their meth-\nods, materials, and/or assessments to support students as\nthey learn skills and concepts. For standards-based lessons,\nteachers can develop clear goals statements by unwrapping\nthe academic standard and then asking the question, \"Based\non the standard, what are the skills and concepts that we want\nstudents to master?\"\nAcademic standards often include words that specify how\nstudents should express knowledge. For example, in Figure 2,\nthe CCSS ELA standard starts with the phrase \"write narra-\ntives.\"After noting that the standard includes information on a\nspecific format for expression of knowledge (in this case, writ-\ning), teachers can consider how they would like to develop a\ngoal statement for their lesson based on this standard. Teachers\ncan use professional judgment to develop goals based on the\nstandard, taking into consideration the needs of students and\nthe goals of a lesson. In some cases, it might be appropriate to\nmodify the format to help students develop mastery of the\nvarious skills and concepts within a standard.\nOne teacher might decide to interpret the standard liter-\nally and clarify that the goal is to have students \"write nar-\nratives.\" Another teacher might decide that the goal is for\nstudents to learn how to develop narratives without\nFigure 3.

Using the example of the CCSS ELA Literacy standard that was unwrapped in Figure 1, this table\ndenotes how a teacher can develop lesson components that address skills and concepts within the standard: CCSS.ELA-Literacy.W.3.3, 4.3, 5.3: Write narratives to develop real or imagined experiences\nor events using effective technique, descriptive details, and clear event sequences. UDL = Universal Design for Learning; ELL = English language learner; CCSS = Common Core State Standards; ELA =\nEnglish language arts.\nTable 2. (continued)\n8 SAGE Open\ndefining the specific format in the goal statement. This\nteacher might want to give students options to develop a\nnarrative with a choice of formats (e.g., oral retelling, mul-\ntimedia presentation, in writing). She or he can develop a\ngoal statement that states that students can \"create narra-\ntives in written, oral, or multimedia format,\" denoting the\nconnection to the academic standard and clearly stating\nhow it was modified for purposes of this lesson. Another\nteacher might decide that the ultimate goal is to have stu-\ndents write narratives, as stated in the standard, but to give\nstudents flexible pathways that incorporate other formats\nfor expression during the instructional process. This teacher\ncan design a lesson in which students have the choice to\ndevelop their narratives in various formats as they work\ntoward ultimately creating a written narrative. In these\nways, based on their objectives for a lesson and for their\nstudents, teachers can develop clear goal statements in rela-\ntion to the academic standard.\nStating a clear goal statement is important because the\ngoal drives the other lesson components (assessments,\nmethods, materials). For example, if the teacher's goal for\na particular lesson is to have all students \"write narratives\"\nin this specific format, it is important to consider the fact\nthat writing can pose barriers for some students. The teacher\ncan take into consideration ways to facilitate the writing\nprocess. Some students benefit from drafting their writing\non a computer and/or utilizing software that helps them\norganize or generate words (e.g., graphic organizer soft-\nware; Bouck, Meyer, Satsangi, Savage, & Hunley, 2015).\nStudents can also develop fluency with writing through the\nuse of multimodal scaffolds, such as writing captions to\nimages, describing their narratives orally, or recording their\nnarratives before putting them in written format (Rao,\nDowrick, Yuen, & Boisvert, 2009; Wolsey & Grisham,\n2012). By including these options, as appropriate, within a\nlesson, the teacher can build in supports to help students\nmaster the goal. In contrast, if a teacher's goal is to have\nstudents develop a narrative in a format of their choice, the\nteacher can provide supports and scaffolds for students to\nhelp them develop their work. By starting the planning pro-\ncess with a clear goal statement, teachers can make key\ndecisions about the scaffolds and supports they can include\nwithin their instructional activities.\nTable 2 illustrates how the UDL framework can be used\nto define clear goal statements and how the assessments,\nmethods, and materials for the lesson are linked to that goal\nstatement. In the \"Goals\" row of Table 2, the teacher chooses\nto modify the \"write narratives\" skill within the standard\nand allows students the choice to \"create narratives\" in var-\nied formats of their choice. This aligns with the UDL by (a)\ngiving students the opportunity to use multiple media for\ncommunication (UDL Checkpoint 5.1), (b) letting students\nuse multiple tools for construction and composition (UDL\nCheckpoint 5.2), and (c) optimizing individual choice by\nletting students select their preferred format for expression\n(UDL Checkpoint 7.1). The teacher also develops a clear\ngoal statement to address the three main concepts within the\nstandard stating that, \"students will demonstrate their\nknowledge of effective technique by including descriptive\ndetails and clear event sequences in their narratives.\" By\nclearly describing what is expected of the students, the\nteacher can build in supports to help students achieve these\ngoals linked to the standard.\nStep 2: Assessments\nAssessments are closely tied to instructional goals. The goal\nstatement(s) describes what the teacher would like students\nto learn, do, or engage with to reach mastery of skills/content\nrelated to a standard. To assess whether students are reaching\nmastery, teachers can build in two kinds of assessments--\nformative assessments that allow students to demonstrate\ntheir progress as they learn and summative assessments that\nshow what a student has learned from the lesson or at the end\nof a unit. UDL guidelines can be applied to developing both\nformative and summative assessments. The teacher can\nbegin by asking the question \"How can students demonstrate\nachievement of the identified goals in varied ways?\"\nIf the goal statement does not state the specific format for\ndemonstration of knowledge, the teacher can evaluate a stu-\ndent's knowledge by offering options of various formats, not\nlimiting the evaluation to just one type of product. In the exam-\nple in Table 2, the teacher gives the students various choices for\nthe end product. The student can create a poster, multimedia\npresentation, oral presentation, or a written narrative. This\ngives students the opportunity to use (a) multiple media for\ncommunication (UDL Checkpoint 5.1) and (b) multiple tools\nfor construction and composition (UDLCheckpoint 5.2).When\nstudents are given choices of various formats, it is useful to\nprovide clear criteria for what is expected. By creating a check-\nlist or rubric, teachers can establish expectations and clarify\nwhat the end product must include, regardless of the format the\nstudent chooses. Using these criteria, the teacher can assess stu-\ndents' progress toward or mastery of the skills and concepts\nlearned during the lesson(s). This aligns with UDL by (a) guid-\ning appropriate goal setting by clearly articulating the end goals\n(UDLCheckpoint 6.1) and (b) enhancing the capacity for mon-\nitoring progress by providing a format for students to assess\ntheir own work (UDL Checkpoint 6.4).\nMany times, teachers are required to use a summative\nassessment in a specific format (e.g., a written report that all\nteachers at the grade level have assigned). In this case, flexi-\nbility can be built into formative assessments of a student's\nprogress prior to the summative assessment. If the student has\nto ultimately generate a written narrative, the artifacts that a\nstudent creates in the development process can be assessed\nalong the way. As an interim step to developing a report, the\nstudent can be asked to orally state the key points or to create\nRao and Meo 9\na presentation that includes the key points. The teacher can\nassess whether the student is demonstrating proficiency with\nthe concepts within the standard (e.g., effective technique,\ndescriptive details, and clear event sequences) and provide\nfeedback to the student to support the development of his or\nher written narrative. If students have used other supports\nsuch as graphic organizers, audio recordings, drawings, they\ncan also turn in these artifacts along with the written narra-\ntive. By assessing these formative stages, teachers can \"pro-\nvide mastery-oriented feedback\" (UDL checkpoint 8.4) and\nassess the interim steps a student takes to generate the final\nwritten narrative. For students who struggle with or feel anx-\nious about tests, assessing their formative work can be a way\nto provide incremental feedback, give students opportunities\nto make progress with skills with feedback, helping them feel\nlike more successful learners and building a sense of confi-\ndence as learners. These strategies align with UDL check-\npoints of (a) promoting expectations and beliefs that optimize\nmotivation (UDL Checkpoint 9.1), (b) facilitating personal\ncoping skills and strategies (UDL Checkpoint 9.2), and (c)\ngiving students the opportunity to develop self-assessment\nand reflection (UDL Checkpoint 9.3).\nA note on standardized testing. Teachers often have to prepare\nstudents for standardized tests, limiting the flexibility they\ncan provide in a lesson. In this case, teachers can identify\ngoals that are directly linked to test-taking strategies and pro-\nvide students with supports and practice to be able to respond\neffectively to standardized test formats (Novak, 2014). For\nexample, a goal might be to have students gain comfort with\nstandardized test structures, to help students prepare for the\ntest and to minimize stress. Within a standards-based lesson,\nthe teacher can include goals related to the content being\ntaught and also include goals related to familiarizing stu-\ndents with the formats they will encounter on the test when\nthey are assessed on this content. UDL guidelines that align\nwith standardized test preparation are (a) providing clarifica-\ntion of test language (UDL Checkpoint 2.1), (b) highlighting\npatterns that the student can expect to find in the test (UDL\nCheckpoint 3.2), (c) building fluency in the test format\nthrough practice (UDL Checkpoint 5.3), (d) minimizing\nthreats and distractions by pre-teaching specific test-taking\nstrategies (UDL Checkpoint 7.3), and (e) facilitating per-\nsonal coping skills by preparing the student for the test (UDL\nStep 3: Methods\nMethods are at the heart of the instructional process; these\nare the strategies teachers use to implement a lesson to con-\nvey information and engage students in the process of devel-\noping mastery of skills and content. After unwrapping the\nstandard, stating a clear goal, and determining how students\nwill be assessed, there are numerous ways in which teachers\ncan apply UDL to the instructional strategies they will use\nduring a lesson. Because the lesson goals are linked to the\nskills/concepts identified within the standard, the teacher can\nuse UDL to ensure that students have flexible and engaging\nways to work toward that goal, as they progress toward mas-\ntery of the academic standard that guides the lesson. As they\nconsider instructional strategies to use, teachers can ask the\nquestion \"What supports and scaffolds can be used as part of\ninstruction to help students acquire the content and demon-\nstrate what they are learning?\"\nMany of the UDL checkpoints provide direct suggestions\nfor supports that can be used during instruction. UDL\nGuideline 2 (provide options for language, mathematical\nexpressions, and symbols) and Guideline 3 (provide options\nfor comprehension) and their checkpoints suggest various\ntechniques that can help make information comprehensible\nto a wide range of learners. The UDL checkpoints also pro-\nvide ideas for scaffolds that can be provided during instruc-\ntional activities. Scaffolds are the incremental supports that\nare provided during the instructional process and can be\nfaded as students master concepts. Scaffolds are useful in\naddressing learner variability because they can be used by\neach student to the degree that they are needed. Given the\nvaried background experiences, knowledge, and abilities of\nstudents, scaffolds can provide varied levels of support and/\nor challenge for students as needed. For example, teachers\ncan provide scaffolds to support executive function, which\nfalls under UDL Guideline 6. Executive function refers to the\nindividual's ability to organize, manage, and act upon infor-\nmation. Teachers can build in scaffolds for executive func-\ntion by integrating opportunities for goal setting, planning\nand strategy development, and self-monitoring as part of the\nactivities within a lesson. Teachers can also ask themselves\nwhere they can build fluency with new skills/content by pro-\nviding graduated support for practice and performance (UDL\nCheckpoint 5.3). These scaffolds can address learner vari-\nability by providing students with various supports as they\nlearn, giving them ways to practice and master skills as\nappropriate for their ability levels.\nIn the example in Table 2, the teacher uses various sup-\nports and scaffolds to help students \"demonstrate their under-\nstanding of effective technique by including descriptive\ndetails and clear event sequences in their narratives,\" which\nis the instructional goal linked to the concepts for the stan-\ndards that guide this lesson. To do this, the teacher includes\nactivities that give students opportunities to describe objects\nand reflect on how they can be more accurate or vivid in\ntheir descriptions. She asks students to bring in artifacts that\nare meaningful to them and to come up with as many\ndescriptive words about that object. In this way, she\naddresses various UDL guidelines related to vocabulary.\nThis activity helps (a) students clarify vocabulary and sym-\nbols (UDL Checkpoint 2.1), (b) students clarify syntax and\nstructure (UDL Checkpoint 2.2), (c) promote understanding\nacross languages for students who are culturally and linguis-\ntically diverse (UDL Checkpoint 2.4), and (d) illustrate con-\ncepts with the use of multiple media (UDL Checkpoint 2.5).\nThis activity also engages students in the development of the\nconcept by starting with something that is relevant and\nauthentic to them (UDL Checkpoint 7.2). The teacher can\nuse various formats for this activity to support student learn-\ning. For example, they can first describe their objects to a\nsmall group and get feedback from their classmates. Then\nthey can share their artifact and descriptive details with the\nwhole class. This fosters community and collaboration in a\nway that can be supportive for students (UDL Checkpoint\n8.3). These activities serve to give students opportunities to\nclarify and practice what they are expected to do before they\nare asked to work on their narratives independently (UDL\nTo develop students' understanding of \"clear event\nsequences,\" the teacher does a guided activity in which the\nstudents reflect on narratives she has chosen to identify the\nevent sequences. This can (a) activate or supply background\nknowledge before students try to develop event sequences on\ntheir own (UDL Checkpoint 3.1) and (b) highlight patterns,\ncritical features, big ideas, and relationships (UDL\nCheckpoint 3.2). Teachers can also provide students with\nimages or strips of text that they have to sequence to practice\nwhat a clear event sequence is, guiding information process-\ning and visualization (UDL Checkpoint 3.3). These are just a\nfew examples of instructional supports and scaffolds that a\nteacher can integrate to address specific skills and concepts\nof the standards-based lesson. All the supports described\nabove can be helpful to a range of students by providing vari-\nous options that support perception, comprehension, pro-\ncessing, expression, and engagement for varied learners.\nIntegrating strategies that motivate and engage students dur-\ning the learning process is an essential aspect of learning as\nstudents build skills and knowledge.\nStep 4: Materials\nThe resources and materials that teachers use in a lesson\nshould align closely with the instructional strategies and\nscaffolds used in the lesson. Teachers can decide how to pro-\nvide flexible options and support learning processes using a\nvariety of materials. Materials can include \"no tech\" or low\ntech resources such as post-it notes, index cards, and flash\ncards. They can include high tech tools, such as computers\nand tablets. Materials can be used to help students chunk\ninformation (e.g., writing down information on an index card\nor brainstorming and generating a classroom list with post-it\nnotes) or process information in varied ways (e.g., using\ngraphic organizers to organize information). Teachers can\nask themselves, \"What resources, materials, and tools can be\nused to provide multiple means to represent and express\ninformation and concepts or to engage with content?\"\nTeachers can also include materials that support the pro-\ncess of learning. For example, a mobile device such as a tab-\nlet or smartphone can be used to have the students record\nwhat they have to say as an interim step to developing a writ-\nten narrative. Sometimes materials and tools are made avail-\nable only to specific students, for example, visual organizers\nor technology tools are given to students who have that on\ntheir individualized educational plans (IEPs). For a UDL-\nbased lesson, it is optimal to provide supports to all students\nand give students the choice to use various materials, instead\nof providing them as modification or accommodation only\nfor specified students.\nIn the example in Table 2, the teacher uses a \"storyboard\nworksheet\" to help students develop a narrative. This work-\nsheet provides a way for students to plan out their narrative\nusing images and captions. The teacher also gives students\nthe opportunity to use digital graphic organizer software to\nbrainstorm ideas prior to creating their storyboard. Students\ncan also use digital devices, such as apps on a tablet or smart-\nphone or software on a laptop to record their thoughts and to\nuse their audio recordings to develop structured narratives.\nThe use of these materials (a) offers alternatives for auditory\ninformation (UDL Checkpoint 1.2) and for visual informa-\ntion (UDL Checkpoint 1.3), (b) varies the methods for com-\nmunication (UDL Checkpoint 4.1), (c) gives students access\nto tools and assistive technologies (UDL Checkpoint 4.2),\nand (d) lets students use multiple tools for construction and\ncommunication (UDL Checkpoint 5.2).\nA note about digital tools. It is worth mentioning that although\nUDL does not require the use of technology, digital tools\nhelp to create flexible environments. For example, laptops\nand tablets present text in a digital format. This \"digital\ntext\" inherently includes options that increase flexibility and\naccess. For example, digital text can be easily manipulated.\nThe font size or color can be modified, text spacing can be\nchanged, and text-to-speech features of the computer can be\nused to listen an audio version of the text on screen. Digital\ntext can also be linked to definitions, words, and phrases.\nDigital text can be formatted to help students chunk infor-\nmation and to remove visual clutter. For teachers who have\nthe opportunity to integrate computers or tablets into the\nclassroom, digital text and media provide many options for\nflexibility that can support student needs during the learning\nprocess, consistent with UDL Guideline 1 (provide options\nfor perception) and UDL Guideline 4 (provide options of\nphysical access). Simply providing students with digital text\nmay not be enough however. It is important for teachers to\nknow how digital text can be used as part of a set of flexible\nmethods and materials to make content more accessible to\nstudents. To this end, it is important to provide teachers with\nthe professional development and support to understand\nhow to incorporate these features into their instructional\nstrategies.\nConclusion\nAcademic standards provide a benchmark for essential\nskills and knowledge that students need to master as they\nprogress through the grade levels. Teachers can identify\ngoals that are aligned to academic standards and provide\nvarious ways for achieving the goals, integrating instruc-\ntional strategies that serve as supports and scaffolds to help\nall students progress toward mastery of the standards-based\nlessons. The instructional design process described in this\narticle highlights how teachers can proactively differentiate\nlessons using the UDL guidelines as a menu of options to\nconsider during the lesson planning process. The example\nof how UDL can be applied to the lesson components to\naddress one ELA standard illustrated just a few ways in\nwhich teachers can integrate flexible goals, methods, mate-\nrials, and assessments. Teachers are free to choose the ele-\nments that resonate for them, given the reality of their\nclassrooms and the initiatives at their schools. If a school\nhas adopted a packaged curriculum, teachers may not have\nroom to make all components flexible, but can ask them-\nselves how to add in some flexibility, as a scaffold to hav-\ning students reach the end goals. By considering UDL\nduring the planning process and adding in flexible path-\nways to reaching the learning goals, teachers can reduce\nbarriers that exist in curricula and increase opportunities\nthat allow all learners to reach the same high standards.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAinsworth, L.
