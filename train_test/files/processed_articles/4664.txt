Here, we asked whether different visual experiences of our bodies influence body width estimates.\nIn Experiment 1, width estimates of three body parts (foot, hips, and shoulders) without any visual\naccess were compared to estimates with visual feedback available in a mirror or from a first-person\nperspective. In the no visual access and mirror condition, participants additionally estimated their head\nwidth. There was no influence of viewing condition on body part width estimates. Consistent with\nprevious research, all body part widths were overestimated with greater overestimation of hip and\nhead width. In Experiment 2, participants estimated the size of unfamiliar noncorporeal objects to test\nwhether this overestimation was partially due to the metric body size estimation method or our\nexperimental conditions. Object width was overestimated with visual feedback in a mirror available as\ncompared to when directly looking at the object, but only for objects placed at shoulder and head\nheight. We conclude that at least some of the overestimation of body part width seems to be body\nspecific and occurs regardless of the visual information provided about the own body.\n",

The conscious representation of our physical appearance is often\nreferred to as our body image. Body image is characterized as a unity of present body\nsensations linked with social and perceptual experiences in the past and allows comparing\none's physical appearance to others. It is traditionally distinguished from body schema, an\nunconscious representation of the bodily dimensions used for action control (Dijkerman &\nDe Haan, 2007; Paillard, 1999). Generally, body image is described as consisting of two\ncomponents that are largely independent of one another, an attitudinal and a perceptual\nCorresponding author:\nAnne Thaler, Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Tu\n\u00a8bingen, Germany.\nEmail: anne.thaler@tuebingen.mpg.de\nCreative Commons CC BY: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/\nopen-access-at-sage).\ni-Perception\njournals.sagepub.com/home/ipe\ncomponent (Gardner & Brown, 2014; Slade, 1994). The attitudinal component comprises\nfeelings and thoughts that are placed on the whole body or body parts as a result of, for\nexample, sociocultural norms of body ideals (Grabe, Ward, & Hyde, 2008), social\ncomparison (Myers & Crowther, 2009), and appearance-related feedback from others.\nNegative social feedback and excessive appearance-related social comparison have been\nlinked to poor psychological health and the development of body image and eating\ndisturbances (J. K. Thompson, Coovert, & Stormer, 1999). Most research on the\nperceptual component of body image has used visual body size estimation tasks to\ninvestigate how veridically people estimate their own bodily dimensions. It is not clear yet\nwhether and how nonvisual bodily information influences visual estimates of own body size.\nHowever, there are multiple factors suggesting that one's body image is largely influenced by\nthe visual experience with one's own body, such as the higher spatial resolution of the visual\nsystem as compared with the somatosensory system, and the fact that perception of others'\nbodies and thus self-other comparisons appear to be guided by vision.\nIt is currently unknown how different visual experiences that one has in daily life\ncontribute to the mental image of one's own body. Which visual information is\npredominantly used to form people's perceptual body image? One's body image could be\nformed by information about the bodily dimensions from the visual experiences with our\nbody from a first-person perspective--as we see our body most of the time--or the third-\nperson perspective through indirect media such as mirrors, reflections, or pictures.\nThe goal of this research was to investigate how two different visual perspectives on one's\nbody (first- and third-person) contribute to the mental representation of own bodily\ndimensions that is assessed in a body size estimation task. Understanding how different\nvisual experiences may, or may not, influence the visual representation of own body size\ncould improve our theoretical understanding of how body representations are formed and\nthus provide a fruitful and novel area to understanding differences between clinical and\nnonclinical populations with body image disturbances. To motivate this work, we briefly\nreview empirical research using body size estimation tasks, the sparse literature on how\ndifferent experiences contribute to body size perception, and some indications that body\nsize estimations may be distorted when viewing one's own body in a mirror.\nEmpirical Research on Body Size Estimation\nSeveral methods have been developed aiming at externalizing one's body image to measure its\ndimensions. As the traditional concept of body image is that of a visual body representation,\nthe methods rely on visually comparing dimensions of one's own body to a reference. Two\ntypes of body size estimation methods are distinguished: metric and depictive body size\nestimation methods (Longo & Haggard, 2012). In metric methods, often also referred to\nas body part methods, the size of body parts is estimated against a spatial measure (e.g., a\ncaliper or a measure tape) and thus local spatial estimates of body parts are assessed (Home,\nVan Vactor, & Emerson, 1991; Slade & Russell, 1973). In depictive methods, often also\nreferred to as whole body methods, the size and shape of the whole body are compared\nwith another body of self or other identity (e.g., photographs or computer-generated bodies)\nusually manipulated in body weight (Mo\n\u00b4 e, Benson, Emery, Mason, & Cohen-Tove\nthat healthy people on average accurately estimate their own bodily dimensions in depictive\nmethods, whereas they overestimate in metric methods (Mo\nAlthough it is often argued that body size estimation tasks assess the perceptual\ncomponent of body image, the estimates were found to be influenced by cognitive-affective\nfactors. Specifically, findings show that the accuracy of body size estimation correlates with\nattitudes toward the body in healthy women (Ben-Tovim, Walker, Murray, & Chin, 1990),\nand the degree of overestimation of certain body parts is influenced by body dissatisfaction\nand self-esteem in anorexia nervosa (Garner & Garfinkel, 1982). In line with this, different\ntask instructions were found to have an effect on the estimates of own body size (Bowden,\nTouyz, Rodriguez, Hensley, & Beumont, 1989).\nOverall, this research suggests that the size of own body parts is often overestimated in\nmetric body size estimation methods and the degree of overestimation might be influenced by\naffective factors. However, it does not address how the mental image of our body is formed.\nWhat visual experience do we have with our own body that may allow us to make body-\nrelated self-other comparisons? We hypothesize that social comparison is best served by\nrepresenting our body in a manner that is consistent with judging and comparing to\nothers' bodies, namely, from a third-person perspective. Specifically, viewing ourselves\nthrough, for example, a mirror allows a perspective on our own body that may be the\nbasis of the mental image of our body.\nBody Size Estimation With Mirrors\nA particularly salient visual experience of one's body is viewing it through a mirror. Mirrors\nhave been used to investigate body size estimation, especially in individuals with eating\ndisorders and obesity, and are often used as a therapy tool to improve self-body\nevaluation through mirror confrontation (Cappon & Banks, 1968; Delinsky & Wilson,\nSome researchers have argued that body size estimation tasks assess memory of own body\nsize rather than perception (Farrell, Shafran, & Fairburn, 2003; Shafran & Fairburn, 2002;\nSmeets, 1997). To address this issue, some studies have investigated body size estimation with\nvisual feedback in a mirror available (Ben-Tovim & Walker, 1990; Gardner, Gallegos,\nMartinez, & Espinoza, 1989). For example, Ben-Tovim and Walker (1990) asked healthy\nadolescent girls to estimate the width of their bodies at several heights (face, shoulder, chest,\nwaist, and hip) by adjusting the distance between two moveable light sources with and\nwithout mirror feedback. In the mirror condition, participants could see their mirror\nimage in a full-length mirror that was placed adjacent to the moveable caliper apparatus\nwhile making the estimates. The results showed that participants significantly overestimated\nall body widths when compared to measurements of their actual body in both the mirror and\nthe no mirror condition. The mirror feedback only influenced width estimates of the\nshoulders, such that overestimation was smaller than without mirror feedback. Similarly,\nGardner et al. (1989) had obese and normal weight participants match the body size of a\npreviously taken photograph shown on a monitor in the presence and absence of a mirror.\nThere was no difference in results between the two groups; however, overall participants were\nmore accurate in estimating their body size when the mirror was present.\nIn other studies, participants were presented with an image of themselves that was\nprojected next to a full-length mirror with the projection having the same height as the\nmirror reflection (half of the physical body size). Participants' task was to adjust the\nprojected image such that it corresponded to their mirror reflection (Farrell et al., 2003;\nShafran & Fairburn, 2002). In addition, Farrell et al. (2003) compared body size estimates\nto a condition in which participants had to adjust the size of an image projection of their\nbody in life size to match their own body size from memory. Contrary to expectations, the\nresults showed that participants overestimated their body size significantly more in the mirror\ncondition compared to the memory condition. The authors argued that this might have been\nThaler et al. 3\ndue to the different sizes of stimuli that were used in the two conditions. Using the same\nmethod but matching the image size between both conditions, \u00d8vera\n\u00b0 s, Kapstad, Brunborg,\nLandr\u00f8, and Lask (2014) found that patients with anorexia nervosa overestimated their body\nsize more than controls in both the memory and perception condition. As in Farrell et al.\n(2003), they found that body size was overestimated more in the mirror compared with the\nmemory condition but only for patients and not for healthy controls. Docteur, Urdapilleta,\nand Duarte (2012), on the other hand, found that healthy women accurately estimated their\nbody size using a similar mirror-based method, but they overestimated in the memory\ncondition. Furthermore, when adjusting an image so it matched a printed photograph of\nthemselves, participants made accurate estimates.\nOverall, these studies present inconclusive results as to whether perception and memory of\nown body size differ and how exactly they are distorted. Furthermore, most previous studies\nusing a depictive body size estimation method do not allow to draw conclusions about differences\nin size estimation of single body parts because the body could only be adjusted as a whole,\nnamely, in body weight, and not independently for single body parts (see, however, Gardner,\nMartinez, Espinoza, & Gallegos, 1988; McCabe, Ricciardelli, Sitaram, & Mikhail, 2006; Tove\n\u00b4 e\net al., 2003). So far, none of this work has related estimates of body size in a mirror to those from\nmemory and from a first-person perspective--as we see our body most of the time.\nOverview of the Experiments\nThe goal of the current experiments was to investigate how different visual experiences\nmay contribute to the conscious representation of our bodily dimensions. In Experiment\n1, we compared estimates of body widths without any visual access with estimates made\nwhen viewing one's body in a mirror or from a first-person perspective. If estimates of\nown body size without visual access are more similar to those made when seeing one's\nbody in a mirror as compared to the first-person perspective, then it would suggest\nthat participants' mental representation of their bodily dimensions might partially be\ninfluenced by visually experiencing one's body from a third-person perspective.\nIn Experiment 2, we compared estimates of object widths placed at the height of the\nsame body parts as in Experiment 1, when viewing the objects in a mirror and when\ndirectly looking at the objects.\nExperiment 1\nMethods\nParticipants. Forty-eight (32 female, 16 male) people from the Tu\n\u00a8 bingen community\nparticipated in the experiment. All participants were naive to the purpose of the\nexperiment and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The experiment was approved\nby the ethics committee of the University of Tu\n\u00a8 bingen and was performed in accordance with\nthe Declaration of Helsinki. Participants gave written informed consent and were\ncompensated with E8 per hour for their participation.\nApparatus. In the Mirror condition, participants viewed their reflection in a 34 cm \u00c2 110 cm\n(width \u00c2 height) sized standard mirror, mounted on a wall with a floor offset of 70 cm,\n1.75 m from the viewers' location. The mirror was tested, and no obvious distortions were\nfound. For the visual matching task, a standard 3 m steel tape measure was used with\nmetric values displayed only on one side (experimenter), the opposite side (participant)\nwas blank.\nDesign. A mixed design was implemented. Condition (Mirror, No Visual Access, and First-\nPerson Perspective; Figure 1) was manipulated between participants. All participants\nestimated the width of three body parts (foot, hips, and shoulders) and participants in the\nMirror and No Visual Access conditions additionally estimated the width of their head.\nParticipants in the First-Person Perspective condition did not estimate the width of their\nhead as it is impossible to view this dimension when looking down at one's body. The width\nof every body part (foot, hip, shoulder, and head) was estimated twice, once with the tape\nmeasure starting small and once starting long. Participants were instructed to estimate the\nwidth of their right foot at the widest point, of their hips at the widest point, of their\nshoulders at the point at which they begin to curve down, and of their head at the cheek\nbones. In the Mirror condition, participants estimated the physical width of each body part\nas seen in the mirror but were explicitly instructed that they were not allowed to look down or\ntouch their body parts with their hands. In the No Visual Access condition, participants\nestimated the physical width of each body part as they remembered it but were not allowed to\nlook down at their body, touch specific body parts, or look into a mirror. In the First-Person\nPerspective condition, participants estimated the physical width of each body part from\nlooking down but were not allowed to touch specific body parts or look into a mirror.\nThe experimenter verified that the participants did not violate the instructions. The order\nof body part estimates was completely randomized without restriction.\nProcedure. After filling out the informed consent form, participants were randomly assigned\nto one of the three conditions. To estimate the size of each body part, participants performed\na metric body size estimation task (visual matching task) whereby the experimenter would\neither slowly extend or contract the length of a tape measure. The numbers of the tape\nmeasure were not visible to the participant. The participants' task was to adjust the length\nof the tape measure through verbal instructions so that it corresponded to the width of the\nbody part currently being estimated. They were free to adjust the length of the tape measure\nas often as necessary. After participants had completed the experiment, they were asked\nFigure 1. Overview of the three experimental conditions in Experiment 1. Participants either estimated\ntheir body size without visual access with visual feedback in the mirror available or from a first-person\nperspective.\nThaler et al. 5\nabout their thoughts about the hypothesis of the experiment and the widths of all estimated\nbody parts were measured. The experiment lasted approximately 30 min.\nAnalysis\nFor getting a measure of the accuracy of the body part width estimates, a body perception\nindex (BPI) was calculated according to the formula: BPI \u00bc (estimated size/actual size) \u00c2 100\n(Slade & Russell, 1973). To analyze the influence of viewing condition (No Visual Access,\nMirror, and First-Person Perspective) on the BPI of the different body parts, a multilevel\nregression analysis was conducted. This analysis was chosen over an analysis of variance as it\ncan effectively deal with missing data points and therefore allows to analyze the BPI for all\nbody parts and conditions simultaneously even though participants did not estimate their\nhead width in the First-Person Perspective condition. The analysis was done using the lmer\nfunction of the lme4 package in R (Bates, Ma\n\u00a8 chler, Bolker, & Walker, 2014). The BPI\nwas regressed onto the body part (foot, hip, shoulder, and head), and the condition\n(No Visual Access, Mirror, and First-Person Perspective). All factors were allowed\nto interact. Specifically, the following mixed-effects model was fitted (in Wilkinson\nnotation; Wilkinson & Rogers, 1973): BPI $ body part \u00fe condition \u00fe body part:\ncondition \u00fe (1jparticipant). The results reported are with Satterthwaite approximation for\ndegrees of freedom. For the pairwise comparisons, t tests with Bonferroni corrections were\nused because in the mixed-effects model the predicted value at combinations with the head\ncould not be estimated due to the head width not being estimated in the First-Person\nPerspective condition. Effect sizes are reported as Cohen's d.\nResults\nThe multilevel analysis revealed that there was no main effect of condition (No Visual Access,\nthe body width estimates did not differ across conditions. However, there was a main effect of\nBonferroni p value corrections showed that the BPI for the foot (M \u00bc 106.21, standard deviation\nd\u00bc 1.01. There was no difference in BPI between the foot and shoulder (p\u00bc .32, d\u00bc 0.47) and\nbetween the hip and head (p\u00bc .28, d\u00bc 0.39). The results are shown in Figure 2. To examine\nwhether the BPI for the different body parts significantly differed from accurate size estimation\n(BPI\u00bc 100), one-sample t tests were conducted. The results showed that the size of all body parts\nDiscussion\nThe results of Experiment 1 show no effect of viewing condition on the accuracy of body width\nestimates. We found, however, that the width of all body parts was significantly overestimated.\nThis finding is in line with a recently published review on body size estimation suggesting that\nhealthy people tend to overestimate their body dimensions in metric body size estimation tasks\nsimilar to the one used here (Mo\n\u00a8 lbert et al. (2017) suggest that metric tasks\nmight also recruit more implicit body representations, for example, from proprioception, that\nare used for action control. Part of this overestimation of body width could be that when\nnavigating through space, we often leave a margin of error (Warren & Whang, 1987).\nFurthermore, our results show that the width of the hip and the width of the head were\noverestimated to a greater extent than the width of the foot and width of the shoulders. The\nprevious literature has suggested that estimates of emotionally salient body regions (e.g., hip and\nshoulder widths) could be inflated due to cognitive-affective factors (Ben-Tovim et al., 1990;\nGarner & Garfinkel, 1982). It would therefore be expected that women and men show more\ninaccuracies in estimates that are involved in the sociocultural ideal of the body of their own sex\n(e.g., for men, the chest and upper torso and for women, the mid and lower torso). Some of the\noverestimation of shoulder and hip width seen in our results might be due to body\ndissatisfaction. However, although some previous studies have found that women\noverestimated the width of the hips (Gorham & Hundleby, 1988; Pierloot & Houben, 1978),\nother studies reported that men and women consistently overestimated body widths of\nthe various body regions to the same extent (Dolan, Birtchnell, & Lacey, 1987; Gardner\nThe overestimation of head width is likely not related to psychosocial factors. Bianchi,\nSavardi, and Bertamini (2008) suggest that there might be an estimation bias toward head\nenlargement with normal proprioceptive information independent of whether visual\ninformation is provided or not. In Experiment 2, we asked whether this overestimation of\nbody part widths could partly be due to generally overestimating dimensions in a metric size\nestimation task. Furthermore, the greater overestimation for certain body parts could also be in\npart due to viewing and estimating dimensions in our experimental setup, that is, due to the\ndistance to the stimuli, the viewing angles, or the use of a mirror.\nExperiment 2\nThe goal of Experiment 2 was to determine whether the widths of noncorporeal objects\nwould be similarly overestimated as body parts. In Experiment 1, participants\nFigure 2. Body perception index as a function of body part, collapsed across the three experimental\nconditions of Experiment 1. Values higher than 100 indicate overestimation in terms of percentage of the\nactual body size. Error bars represent one standard error from the mean.\nThaler et al. 7\noverestimated the size of all body parts. Is part of this overestimation due to the metric size\nestimation method use or due to our experimental setup? To investigate this question,\nparticipants estimated the width of four objects, strips of paper, when viewed in a mirror\nor when viewed without a mirror, using the same visual matching task as in Experiment 1. If\ndimensions are generally overestimated in metric size estimation tasks or in the viewing\nconditions of our experimental setup, the object widths should be similarly overestimated\nas the widths of the body parts in Experiment 1.\nMethods\nParticipants. Thirty (17 female, 13 male) people from the Tu\n\u00a8 bingen community participated in\nthe experiment. All participants were naive to the purpose of the experiment and had normal\nor corrected-to-normal vision. The experiment was approved by the ethics committee of the\nUniversity of Tu\n\u00a8 bingen and was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nParticipants gave written informed consent and were compensated with E8 per hour for their\nparticipation.\nApparatus. The objects were four strips of paper with a length of 10 cm, 15 cm, 30 cm, and\n45 cm and a width of 5 cm. The lengths of the strips of paper were roughly based on the\naverage width of participants' body parts (foot, hips, shoulders, and head) in Experiment 1.\nIn the Mirror condition, participants viewed the objects in a 34 cm \u00c2 110 cm (width \u00c2 height)\nsized mirror, mounted on a wall with a floor offset of 70 cm at a distance of 1.75 m from the\nviewers' location. The objects were placed on an occluder (2 m tall, 1 m wide) at the height of\neach participant's body part (foot, hips, shoulders, and head). The occluder was positioned\nbetween the participant and the mirror and contained an 18 cm \u00c2 12 cm (width \u00c2 height) hole\nthat could be adjusted in height such that it was centered around each participant's eyes.\nThe occluder allowed participants to view through and see the reflection of the objects\nattached to the other side of the occluder (Figure 3, left). In the No Mirror condition,\nparticipants stood 3.5 m from the objects that were attached to the occluder in the same\nway as in the Mirror condition to equate visual angle size across conditions (Figure 3, right).\nFor the visual matching task, a standard 3 m steel tape measure was used with metric values\ndisplayed only on one side.\nDesign. A mixed design was implemented. Condition (Mirror and No Mirror) was\nmanipulated between participants; half of the participants viewed the objects reflected\nthrough a mirror and the other half without the mirror. All participants estimated the\nwidth of each object four times, twice with the tape measure starting small and twice\nstarting long. The order of estimates was completely randomized without restriction.\nProcedure. After filling out the informed consent form, participants were randomly assigned\nto one of the two conditions. They then estimated the widths of the objects using the same\nvisual matching task as in Experiment 1. The experiment lasted approximately 30 min.\nAnalysis\nSimilar to the calculation of the BPI in Experiment 1, an object perception index (OPI) was\ncalculated for getting a measure of the accuracy of the object width estimation:\nOPI \u00bc (estimated size/actual size) \u00c2 100. As in Experiment 1, a multilevel regression\nanalysis was conducted. The OPI was regressed onto the objects placed at the height of\nthe different body parts (foot, hip, shoulder, and head) and the condition (Mirror and No\nMirror). All factors were allowed to interact. Specifically, the following mixed-effects model\nwas fitted (in Wilkinson notation; Wilkinson & Rogers, 1973): OPI $ objects \u00fe\ncondition \u00fe objects: condition \u00fe (1jparticipant). The reported results are with Satterthwaite\napproximation for degrees of freedom. t Test were used for planned comparisons; effect sizes\nare reported as Cohen's d.\nResults\nThe analysis revealed a main effect of objects, F(3, 84) \u00bc 6.95, p < .001. However, planned\ncomparisons using independent t tests with Bonferroni p value corrections showed that there\nwas no significant difference in OPI across the objects placed at the height of the different\nbody parts. There was also no main effect of condition, F(1, 28) \u00bc 2.61, p \u00bc .12. The accuracy\nof object width estimation was on average similar across the Mirror and No Mirror\ncondition. However, the interaction between objects and condition was significant, F(3,\n84) \u00bc 3.11, p \u00bc .03. The results are shown in Figure 4. Planned comparisons were run for\neach of the four objects to test whether the OPI differed between the Mirror and No Mirror\ncondition. For the object placed at shoulder height, the OPI was significantly larger in the\nsignificant difference in OPI between the Mirror and No Mirror conditions.\nUsing one-sample t tests, the OPI at each object height was tested to a value of 100\n(accurate width estimation). The OPI of objects placed at shoulder and head height\np \u00bc .01, d \u00bc 0.48. This effect, however, seems to be driven by a greater overestimation of\nthe object width when viewing it in a mirror. The OPI of objects placed at foot and hip\nDiscussion\nThe results of Experiment 2 show that the width of objects placed at foot and hip height was\nestimated accurately, but the width of objects placed at shoulder and head height was\nFigure 3. Overview of the two experimental conditions in Experiment 2. Participants either estimated the\nobject widths attached to the occluder with visual feedback in the mirror available or by directly looking at\nthe objects without a mirror.\nThaler et al. 9\noverestimated. Importantly, this width overestimation of objects at shoulder and head height\nseems to be driven by a greater overestimation of these dimensions when viewing the objects\nin a mirror. While the results suggest that dimensions are not generally overestimated in\nmetric size estimation methods, they do not allow to draw conclusions about what it is about\nviewing objects placed at the height of the shoulder and the head in the mirror in our\nexperimental setup that leads to a size overestimation. However, the results of Experiment\n2 suggest that part of the overestimation of body part widths in Experiment 1 may be due to\nbiases when viewing or estimating the size of one's body parts in the mirror. Notably, across\nthe viewing conditions, the width of objects placed at the height of the foot and the hips was\nestimated accurately, whereas the width of the foot and hips in Experiment 1 was significantly\noverestimated to a degree of around 6% and 23%. The width of objects placed at the height\nof the shoulder and the head in Experiment 2 was overestimated by around 6% and 9%,\ncompared to an overestimation of 12% for the shoulder width and 32% for the head width in\nExperiment 1.\nGeneral Discussion\nThis research aimed at investigating how different visual experiences when looking at one's\nown body may contribute to the conscious representation of one's bodily dimensions.\nOur results of Experiment 1 demonstrate that body width estimates with visual access in\nthe mirror available, from a first-person perspective, and with no visual access, were\nconsistent. These findings are in line with previous research showing that visual feedback\nin a mirror did not improve the accuracy of estimating own bodily dimensions when\ncompared to body size estimates from memory (Ben-Tovim & Walker, 1990; Farrell et al.,\n2003). This suggests that people might use a common body representation when making body\nsize estimates under different viewing conditions and without visual access. Furthermore, our\nresults show that body part widths were overall overestimated, and the hip and head width\nwas overestimated to a larger degree than the foot and shoulder width. The results of\nFigure 4. Object perception index for objects placed at the height of each participant's right foot, hip,\nshoulder, and head when viewed directly (no mirror) or when viewed in a mirror (mirror) in Experiment 2.\nValues higher than 100 indicate overestimation in terms of percentage of the actual size. Error bars represent\none standard error from the mean.\nExperiment 2 demonstrate that noncorporal object widths were accurately estimated for\nobjects placed at the height of the foot and the hips but were overestimated for objects\nlocated at the height of the shoulder and the head. This overestimation of shoulder and\nhead width, however, seems to be driven by larger estimates when viewing the objects in\nthe mirror relative to when viewing the objects directly.\nWe found that participants generally overestimated the width of their body parts.\nThis overestimation is in line with the previous literature showing that bodily dimensions\ntend to be overestimated in metric body size estimation tasks also in healthy participants\n(Mo\n\u00a8 lbert et al. (2017) has argued that this overestimation of body\ndimensions in metric tasks might be due to the tasks assessing not only explicit knowledge\nabout own body dimensions but also implicit body representations that rely on\nsomatosensation. Implicit body representations, on the other hand, have been argued to be\nmassively distorted in size and seem to be characterized by i.a. an overestimation of body part\nFurthermore, our results show that hip and head width was overestimated to a greater\nextent than shoulder and foot width. Using a similar visual matching task than the one used\nin our study, Bianchi et al. (2008) also found a significant overestimation of head size both\nwhen estimating head height without visual access and with visual feedback in a mirror\navailable, in their case, overestimation was, however, reduced with visual feedback. In line\nwith the claim that metric methods might also recruit distorted implicit body representations,\nBianchi et al. suggest that there might be a bias toward enlargement of heads with normal\nproprioceptive information that is independent of whether visual information is available or\nnot. Interestingly, Bianchi et al. additionally analyzed paintings of portraits of self and others\nand found that painters drew their own head larger than other people's heads.\nSeveral researchers have argued that performance in body size estimation tasks can be\ninfluenced by cognitive-affective factors (Ben-Tovim & Walker, 1990; Bowden et al., 1989;\nGarner & Garfinkel, 1982). Thus, estimates of emotionally salient body region, such as the\nhips and shoulders, might be inflated due to body dissatisfaction, and this could also\ncontribute to the overestimation of body part widths seen in Experiment 1. As our\nexperiment was not designed for looking at sex differences in the accuracy of body width\nestimates, but at the role of visual information, it remains up to future research to determine\nif and how psychosocial factors correlate with estimates of own body size. An influence of\nattitudinal factors on the accuracy of body size estimates should theoretically reveal sex\ndifferences, with more overestimation of the hip region for women and more\noverestimation of the shoulder region for men according to societal beauty ideals.\nHowever, several studies found no sex difference in body width estimates of the different\nPerception of own body size can also be influenced by the bodies that one has been\nexposed to in the past. There is consistent evidence that familiarity or expertise with\ndifferent body sizes modulates how bodies are perceived. For example, aftereffects result\nfrom prolonged or repeated exposure to a given feature and manifest themselves in a\nsubsequent shift of perception of this feature into the direction opposite of the adapted\nfeature (P. Thompson & Burr, 2009). Such biases in perception of bodies have been found\nin adaptation experiments in terms of body normality (Glauert, Rhodes, Byrne, Fink, &\nattractiveness (Winkler & Rhodes, 2005). Similarly, Hummel et al. (2013) found that after\nadaptation to a thin body, participants judged a picture depicting a thinner version of\nthemselves as most realistic and after adapting to a fat body, a fatter version as most\nrealistic. Aftereffects were also found to transfer across self and other identity, suggesting that\nthey might also explain the sociocultural influence on disturbances of body image as repeated\nmedia exposure to extreme thin bodies should make bodies appear fatter (Brooks, Mond,\nStevenson, & Stephen, 2016). Repeated visual exposure to distorted mirrors, an extreme case\nwould be funhouse mirrors, could therefore also affect how one's own body size is perceived\nand estimated.\nIn Experiment 2, we tested whether the width overestimation was specific to body parts or\nmight be partly due to the metric method used or aspects of our experimental setup and\nwould therefore also affect estimates of noncorporeal objects. The results demonstrate that\nthe width of objects placed at the height of the foot and the hip was accurately estimated,\nsuggesting that dimensions are not generally overestimated in a metric size estimation task,\nwhereas there is a large body of literature on estimates of object sizes within mirrors, this\nstudy provides a further contribution to this previous literature by manipulating object height\nand size to match a situation of judging body part widths. We only found some\noverestimation of object widths when looking in the mirror, specifically at the height of\nthe shoulder and the head. However, the magnitude of this overestimation was much less\nthan for the body size estimates in Experiment 1.\nPrevious work has asked participants to estimate the size of objects, as they appear on\nthe mirror surface (Lawson & Bertamini, 2006) or when viewed through a window\n(Lawson, Bertamini, & Liu, 2007). Those results show that participants have difficulties\nestimating the object size as it appears on the mirror surface (estimates should be one half\nof the actual width) and tend to make estimates close to the true size of the object.\nFurthermore, size estimates on the mirror surface were found to depend partially on\nthe distance between the viewpoint (participants' eyes) and the horizontal displacement\nof the object. For both mirrors and windows, the physical size of an object was, however,\naccurately estimated. Our results demonstrate that the width of objects placed at the\nheight of the shoulder and the head was overestimated when participants were asked to\nestimate their actual width, when seeing the object reflection in a mirror as compared with\nwhen directly viewing the objects. The difference in results could be due to having a size\nreference, namely, the mirror reflection of one's own body in the study by Lawson et al.\n(2007), whereas participants in our study had to judge the size of an object without any\nfamiliar size they could use as a reference. However, lack of familiar size cues cannot\nexplain why the width of objects placed at the height of the foot and the hip was\naccurately estimated. There might be a relationship between vertical displacement\nbetween the object being judged and the viewpoint. Although this mirror effect cannot\nentirely explain the overestimation of body part widths of Experiment 1, it suggests that\nvisual experience of one's body in the mirror and potential distortions thereof could also\nbe reflected in the mental image of own body dimensions.\nAnother prominent visual experience of one's own body is viewing it in a picture.\nDocteur et al. (2012) found that participants accurately estimated their body size when\nthey had to adjust an image so it matched a printed photograph of themselves. Although\nperception of body size in photographs provides another interesting field for\nunderstanding body image distortions, the size of one's body in an image also\nrelies heavily on familiar size cues and indirect extrapolation of one's size given the\nenvironment. Moreover, in most such depictive body size estimation tasks where\nthe reference is an entire body that has to be matched to one's own body shape, the\nbody stimulus can only be adjusted as a whole, most often in body weight, and not\nindependently for single body parts. Thus, estimates are probably influenced by relative\nproportions of the body and the overall body shape.\nAnother possible indirect experience of one's body size is how we interact with the world\naround us by stepping up onto objects or passing in between obstacles. Previous work has\nshown that much of our interpretation of the spatial layout is scaled to the size of one's body\n(Warren & Whang, 1987). It would be interesting to see whether and how manipulating one's\nability to act in the world alters subsequent estimations of one's body width in body size\nestimation tasks.\nFinally, this study has some limitations. First, we only examined the visual estimation of\nthe width of four body parts, and second, we did not use a measure for body dissatisfaction,\nespecially with regard to the body parts that were estimated. Future research should include\nmore measures of the attitudinal component of body image to understand the contribution of\nvisual and cognitive factors to body size estimation. Another limitation of our study is that\nthe overestimation of object widths in the mirror of Experiment 2 cannot be traced to the size\nor the height of the objects because the object widths were matched to the body part widths of\nExperiment 1 and the objects were placed at the height of the respective body part for each\nparticipant. Future studies should test size estimation of the same object at different heights.\nFurthermore, similar methods could be used to understand how other experiences with\ndifferent senses influence body size estimation, for example, how mirror exposure and\nsimultaneous tactile stimulation alter visual size estimates.\n"
