Inclusion criteria for this analysis were age\n60\u00ad79 and presence of radiographic knee OA. SRHS, elicited as a five-item domain (excellent, very good, good, fair, poor),\nwas analyzed by dichotomizing the general health status measure as ``fair/poor'' versus all other states. We estimated the\nproportion of participants in fair/poor health from each study. Propensity score methodology was used to adjust for the\ndifferences in sampling strategies between the two studies.\nResults: Thirty-four percent (N = 1,608) of OAI and 29% (N = 756) of NHANES-III participants satisfied inclusion criteria. The\nproportion in fair/poor health was higher in NHANES-III (28%) than in OAI (5%). After adjusting for the propensity score, the\nproportion in fair/poor health was four times higher in NHANES-III than in OAI.\nConclusion: SRHS was substantially better in OAI than in NHANES-III. Self-selection bias may contribute to overestimation of\nSRHS in prospective cohort studies such as OAI.\nCitation: Reichmann WM, Katz JN, Losina E (2011) Differences in Self-Reported Health in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) and Third National Health and Nutrition\nEditor: Joel Gagnier, University of Michigan, Canada\nCopyright: \u00df 2011 Reichmann et al.

Among US adults age 60 or\nolder, knee OA is one of the five leading causes of disability [1]\nStudies have shown that knee OA greatly diminishes health status\nin the elderly [4,5].\nSelf-reported health status (SRHS) is a subjective measure of how\none perceives and reports his or her own well-being. SRHS is often\nmeasured by asking individuals to rate their health as excellent, very\ngood, good, fair, or poor. This type of self-reported information is\nconsidered an important indicator of a person's health status [6]. It\nhas been shown to be a stable measure of one's health and to be\nassociated with the number of physician contacts [7] and mortality\n[7,8]. Often SRHS is measured in national surveys to monitor\npopulation health and this measure has been used in the United\nStates [8], Canada [6], England [9], and Australia [10].\nSRHS in persons with radiographic knee OA could be studied\nin national population-based studies, such as the Third National\nHealth and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES-III), or\nlarge longitudinal prospective cohort studies, such as the\nOsteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). Each study design has its own\ndistinct advantages and disadvantages. An advantage of well-\ndesigned population-based studies is that they exhibit good\ninternal and external validity [11]. However, most of these studies\nare cross-sectional in nature, which makes it challenging to\nevaluate how SRHS changes over time [12]. An advantage of\ncohort studies is that most are longitudinal so they are able to\nevaluate how SRHS changes over time. However, these studies\nusually rely on volunteer study subjects that may be healthier than\nthe general population rendering the studies vulnerable to\nselection bias [13]. Selection bias in turn limits the extent that\nstudy results can be generalized to the general population.\nPropensity score methodology has been used to account for\nselection bias in non-randomized studies [14\u00ad17]. This analytic\napproach assigns each subject a propensity score, defined as the\nprobability of the subject receiving one of the treatments under\nconsideration, as opposed to the other. The propensity score\npermits investigators to adjust for selection bias due to measured\nfactors, but it still cannot account for selection bias that is due to\nunobserved factors [18].\nOur objective was to report the SRHS from two studies focused\non knee OA. We sought to examine the differences in SRHS, and\nfactors explaining these differences, between the two studies. As a\nmethodological aim, we also sought to assess the differences in\nSRHS due to study design and to evaluate how much of these\ndifferences can be remedied by using propensity score methodol-\nogy. Evaluation of SRHS in these two cohorts will demonstrate the\ndifferences in SRHS between a nationally representative sample\n(NHANES-III) and a volunteer cohort (the OAI). These\ndifferences have implications both for interpreting OAI data per\nse and more generally for the use of volunteer cohorts to\nunderstand population level effects.\nMethods\nEthics statement\nThe Brigham and Women's Hospital institutional review board\napproved the study. Since all data is available freely on the web\nand all data analyses were secondary, we did not obtain written\ninformed consent from the subjects.\nData sources\nNHANES-III. NHANES-III is a national population-based\nCenter for Health Statistics of the Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention. The survey was conducted in two phases. Phase I took\nIII survey data were collected during a face-to-face interview. All\nparticipants were then asked to schedule an appointment at a\nmedical examination center where additional data would be\ncollected. Additional details about patient recruitment and\nselection for the NHANES-III survey has been documented [19].\nRadiographs were performed during Phase II for all NHANES-\nIII participants who were 60 years of age or older and could\ntransport themselves to the radiograph table under their own\npower. The radiographs were performed using a non-weight\nbearing anteroposterior approach according to NHANES-III\nprotocol [20]. To be included in this analysis, participants had\nto be between the ages of 60 and 79 with evidence of radiographic\nknee OA.\nOAI. OAI is an on-going multi-center, longitudinal,\nprospective cohort study. Participants were eligible for the study\nif they were between 45 and 79 years old at entry. Participants\nwere excluded if they had rheumatoid or any inflammatory\narthritis, were unlikely to show measurable joint space narrowing,\nhad total knee replacement (TKR) in both knees or planned to\nhave TKR in both knees in the next 3 years, were unable to\nundergo an MRI, had a positive pregnancy test, were unable to\nprovide a blood sample, used ambulatory aids other than a straight\ncane, had comorbid conditions that would prevent them from\nparticipating in a four-year study, were unlikely to reside in the\nclinic area for at least three years, were participating in a double-\nblind randomized control trial at the time, or were unwilling\nto sign the informed consent. Socio-demographic and clinical\ndata were collected via a computer-based self-administered\nquestionnaire. The radiographs were performed using a pos-\nteroanterior fixed-flexion weight-bearing approach according to\nOAI protocol. For our analysis we further restricted the OAI\nsample to those between the ages of 60 and 79 and had evidence of\nradiographic knee OA at their baseline visit.\nData used in the preparation of this article were obtained from\nthe Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database, which is available for\npublic access at http://www.oai.ucsf.edu/. Specific datasets used\n``PhysExam00'', ``SubjectChar00'', and ``Biomarkers00''. Addi-\ntional documentation describing various aspects of the design and\nmethods of the OAI is available on the OAI Online website\n(http://www.oai.ucsf.edu/).\nDifferences in study design characteristics are defined in detail\nin Table 1.\nDefining knee OA: Radiographic assessment\nKnee radiographs were assessed by trained radiologists in both\nNHANES-III and OAI. In NHANES-III, K-L grades were\ncomputed by the radiologist. In OAI, osteophyte and joint space\nnarrowing scores were computed for each knee by trained\nradiologists based on OARSI Atlas grades. From these scores we\nthen computed K-L grades for each knee based on the algorithm\nprovided on the OAI website [21]. For our analysis we used the\ngreater of the right and left K-L grades, and we defined\nradiographic knee OA in the tibiofemoral joint as having a K-L\ngrade of at least 2.\nOutcome: Self-reported health status\nSRHS was elicited in both NHANES-III and OAI by asking the\nparticipant to rate their overall health as excellent, very good,\ngood, fair, or poor. As has been done in previous studies, SRHS\nwas analyzed as a dichotomous variable (excellent, very good, or\nPotential correlates of self-reported health status\nascertained in both studies\nSociodemographic characteristics. We hypothesized that\nage, gender, race, and income are possible correlates or\nconfounders of SRHS. NHANES-III and OAI had different\nage criteria to be included in their studies although there was\nsignificant overlap. NHANES-III performed knee radiographs on\nparticipants age 60 and older, while OAI included participants\nbetween the ages of 45 and 79. To best take advantage of these\nage criteria, we included participants who were between the ages\nas being of white or nonwhite race. We inflated participant's\nthe CPI conversion index calculator provided by the US Bureau\nof Labor Statistics website so that a participant's income in\nNHANES-III would be comparable to a participant's income\nfrom OAI [26]. We then classified income into five categories;\nmissing.\nComorbidity. We identified several closed-ended questions\nconcerning the presence of medical problems at the time of the\nsurvey or in the past in both studies. A comorbidity index was\ncomputed by counting the total number of self-reported medical\nproblems. These included asthma, chronic bronchitis or\nemphysema, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction,\nstroke, diabetes, cancer (including skin cancer), fractures of the\nhip or spine, gout, and back pain most days for at least one month.\nWe then dichotomized the total number of comorbidities as those\nhaving 0-1 comorbidities versus 2 or more. Obesity status was\nconsidered as a separate factor with obesity defined as body mass\nindex (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 [27].\nKnee Pain. We defined NHANES-III participants as having\nknee pain if they answered `Yes' to having knee pain for most days\nfor six weeks or more. OAI participants were considered as having\nknee pain if they answered `Yes' to having knee pain most days for\nDifferences in Self-Reported Health\nStatistical analysis\nDemographic and clinical features of the two samples are\ncompared using percentages and are displayed in Table 1. We\ncalculated the proportion of participants in fair/poor health along\nwith 95% confidence intervals for both cohorts stratified by the\npreviously described correlates. To account for the over-sampling\nof minorities in NHANES-III, we applied the appropriate\nsampling weights for this unadjusted analysis. There were no\nsampling design features that require the use of sampling weights\nin the analyses involving OAI participants.\nTo evaluate the effect of study design on SRHS we conducted\nfive analyses. The first analysis compared SRHS between the two\ncohorts without adjusting for any other factors using the whole\nsample. The second analysis compared SRHS between the cohorts\nby adjusting for the covariates we have previously mentioned using\nthe whole sample. Analyses three through five involve constructing\na propensity score model, which estimates the probability of being\nin the NHANES-III cohort as opposed to the OAI cohort [14].\nThis was done by performing multivariable logistic regression with\nstudy (NHANES-III or OAI) as the dichotomous outcome and\nage, gender, race, obesity status, comorbidity, K-L grade, knee\npain, and income as covariates. Since the propensity score model\nis evaluating the probability of being selected into NHANES-III\ngiven a set of covariate values, we did not apply sample weights to\nthis model. To evaluate the performance of our propensity score\nmodel we first trimmed the sample to those with propensity scores\nbetween 0.2 and 0.8 because that is the region where there was\nsubstantial overlap between the two groups (Figure 1). We\nevaluated how well the propensity score model was able to\nbalance the covariate distributions between the cohorts by\nregressing the interaction between cohort status and quintile of\nthe propensity score on each covariate using generalized logistic\nregression. Statistically significant interactions indicate that given\nthe quintile of the propensity score, the cohorts differ for that\nparticular covariate [14]. In analysis three we compared SRHS\nbetween the two cohorts without adjusting for any factors in those\nwho had a propensity score between 0.2 and 0.8 (i.e. those\nincluded in the trimmed sample). In analysis four we used\nmultivariable logistic regression to analyze the difference in SRHS\nbetween the cohorts while adjusting for covariates in the trimmed\nsample. In analysis five we used multivariable logistic regression to\nanalyze the difference in SRHS between the cohorts while\nadjusting for the propensity score in the trimmed sample.\nIn our models that adjusted for the propensity score or for other\ncovariates we created dummy variables for missing race, obesity\nstatus, and income to minimize the number of observations that\nneeded to be removed for missing data.\nResults\nSample\nTwo thousand five hundred eighty-six participants com-\npleted the NHANES-III household questionnaire and had\nTable 1.

NHANES-III participants were likely to have more\ncomorbidities (25% with 2+ comorbidities versus 8% in OAI).\nOAI participants were more likely to have more severe disease and\nknee pain than NHANES-III participants. Twenty-four percent of\nOAI participants had a K-L grade of 4 and 46% had knee pain. In\nNHANES-III, 6% were K-L 4 and 34% had knee pain.\nDistributions of age, gender, race, obesity, and income were\nsimilar between the two cohorts (Table 2).\nSelf-reported health status (SRHS)\nThe prevalence of being in fair/poor health for participants in\nprevalence of being in fair/poor health for OAI participants was\nparticipants maintained a substantially higher prevalence of being\nin fair/poor health across all subgroups. Participants who were of\nnonwhite race, had more comorbidities, and reported lower\nincomes were more likely to be in fair/poor health regardless of\nthe cohort. Additionally, OAI participants who were more obese\nand reported having knee pain were more likely to be in fair/poor\nhealth. In NHANES-III, the proportion in fair/poor health\nincreased with increasing obesity status but the 95% confidence\nintervals overlapped (Table 3).\nMultivariable analysis and propensity score adjustment\nThe distribution of propensity scores, where the propensity\nscore is defined as the probability of being selected into the\nNHANES-III cohort, stratified by cohort is shown in Figure 1.\nThe distribution of propensity scores in OAI is right skewed and\nconcentrated in the 0.0 to 0.2 range, while the distribution is fairly\nuniform across all values in NHANES-III, indicating substantial\ndifferences in populations participating in each study.

We analyzed SRHS as a dichotomous\noutcome using the general health status question. We found that\nthe SRHS in OAI was substantially better (lower prevalence of\nbeing fair/poor health) than in NHANES-III. We also found that\nFigure 1.

The propensity score (x-axis) is defined as the probability of being selected into the NHANES-III cohort. The percentage of\nindividuals with that propensity score (estimated using Kernel density estimation) in each cohort is shown on the y-axis. The solid line represents\nNHANES-III, while the dashed line represents OAI.\nDifferences in Self-Reported Health\nthese differences were not sensitive to any of our adjustment\nprocedures, which included covariate adjustment, and propensity\nscore adjustment with trimming of the sample. In NHANES-III,\nthe prevalence of being in fair/poor health was at least 18% higher\nregardless of the adjustment procedure.\nThe implication of this finding is that study design and sampling\nprocedures affect estimates of SRHS. In particular, prospective\ncohort studies that try to ensure complete follow-up may exclude\nparticipants that report a lower health status. Evaluating SRHS in\nthese cohorts may underestimate true population levels and may\nlead to insufficient power to determine the differences among\nsubgroups since between group differences may be attenuated.\nThis especially holds true for assessing absolute differences and\nmay hold true for assessing relative differences if there is not\nsufficient variability in the outcome and exposure [11]. In OAI the\nvariability in SRHS is reduced making it difficult to observe\nclinically and/or statistically significant differences in SRHS\nbetween different groups.\nTable 2.

A statewide study conducted by\nDominick et al. using Pennsylvania's Pharmaceutical Assistance\nContract for the Elderly in 1997 found that 55% of OA patients\nwere in fair/poor health, which is much higher than NHANES-\nIII. The mean age of the cohort was 80 years and the mean\nCharlson Comorbidity Index was 2 [4]. Another statewide study\nconducted in Missouri by Andresen et al. in 1999 of participants\nwith a mean age of 40 found a 20% prevalence of being in fair/\npoor health [25]. The Beaver Dam Health Outcomes Study is a\ncommunity study of participants between the age of 45 and 89.\nApproximately 12% of participants reported being in fair/poor\nhealth, which is higher than the estimate from OAI, but 82% of\nthe participants reported at least one comorbid condition.\nDifferences in SRHS between OAI and NHANES-III may be\ndue to the two mechanisms of participation. The first mechanism\nis the exclusion of subjects in OAI. OAI had many more\nexclusions, which may have precluded the enrollment of\nparticipants who have a lower SRHS. The second mechanism is\nrefusal to participate among those who are eligible. Data on\nparticipation rates are not made readily available so we can not\nobjectively assess the differences in participation between the two\nstudies. However, the longitudinal nature of the OAI study may be\nperceived as especially burdensome by eligible participants,\nespecially those in poorer health.\nAs any analysis utilizing observational studies, our analysis was\nsubject to limitations of such a design. In particular, we were\nunable to adjust or account for the differences in SRHS observed\nbetween the two cohorts that may be due to unmeasured variables.\nWe developed several propensity score models before settling on\nthe one reported in this paper. The propensity score presented in\nthe paper allowed us to maximize the balance covariates between\nthe two studies. Some residual lack of balance across two cohorts\nwith respect to knee pain suggests there is an underlying\nunmeasured variable or mechanism that may account for some\nof these differences. These variables could be unmeasured in one\nor both studies. Another limitation is that the radiographs in\nNHANES-III and OAI were not performed using the same\nprotocol. NHANES-III used a non-weight bearing approach,\nwhile OAI used a more accepted weight bearing method. Because\nnon-weight bearing radiographs were used in NHANES-III,\nradiographic severity may have been underestimated [28]. While\nthis would affect estimates of SRHS within NHANES-III, it is\ndoubtful that the misclassification of radiographic severity would\naccount for the large discrepancy between the two study\npopulations.\nOAI collected SRHS and other data via a computer-based self-\nadministered questionnaire, while NHANES-III collected their\ndata via face-to-face interview. While the impact of survey\nmodality on responses has been well documented when studying\ntopics of sensitive nature, such as HIV [29], the topic has not been\nrigorously studies when evaluating SRHS. One study found that\nthose responding via a self-administered questionnaire were more\nlikely to report decrements in health-related quality of life [30].\nHowever, in our analysis those responding via a self-administered\nquestionnaire (those in OAI) reported a higher SRHS.\nFigure 2. Comparison of the proportion of participants in fair or poor health from in OAI and NHANES-III. On the x-axis is the analysis\ntype and on the y-axis is the percent in fair/poor health. The trimmed sample is defined as participants with propensity scores between 0.2 and 0.8.\nDark bars represent OAI, while gray bars represent NHANES-III.\nDifferences in Self-Reported Health\nLastly, SRHS was assessed about 10 years earlier in NHANES-\nIII than in OAI. While it is possible that the time difference could\naccount for the difference it in SRHS, it is unlikely. Hayes et al.\nand found that 17% were in fair/poor health [23]. While this is in\nthe middle of the estimates found in NHANES-III and OAI, 78%\nof the sample was below the age of 60. It is likely that if this\nanalysis was restricted to persons over the age of 60 that the\nprevalence of being in fair/poor health would increase because of\nthe increase in comorbidity.\nWe found that SRHS in a national sample of persons with\nradiographic knee OA was substantially worse than those in a\nsample from a prospective cohort study conducted in four centers,\nregardless of the adjustment procedure performed. Since SRHS is\nan outcome of great interest in persons with knee OA, it is\nimportant to note the effect that study design has on this subjective\noutcome. Strict selection criteria in prospective cohort studies to\nensure complete follow-up may make it difficult to study SRHS\nand how it changes over time because the participants are more\nlikely to have a high SRHS and maintain it over the course of the\nstudy. Future studies of SRHS in these cohorts should take into\naccount these possible limitations of their sample.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: WMR EL.
