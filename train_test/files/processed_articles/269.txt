To avert\nfalse-positive diagnoses, DSM criteria for MDD exclude\nuncomplicated bereavement of brief duration and mod-\nest severity.

Moreover, uncomplicated reac-\ntions, whether triggered by bereavement or other loss,\nare significantly lower than complicated reactions on al-\nmost all disorder indicators.\nConclusion: The NCS data do not support the validity of\nuniquelyexcludinguncomplicatedbereavementbutnotun-\ncomplicatedreactionstootherlossesfromMDDdiagnosis.\nDSM symptom-based di-\nagnostic criteria is that\ntheir failure to consider\nstressful contexts results in\nfalse-positive diagnoses, that is, the clas-\nsification of psychiatrically normal per-\nsons as mentally disordered.1,2 False-\npositive diagnoses can potentially lead to\nstigmatization, inappropriate care, and in-\nflated epidemiological prevalence rates that\nundermine the credibility of the diagnos-\ntic system.2 Conversely, restricting diag-\nnostic criteria to exclude persons with-\nout mental disorder but with symptoms\ncan inadvertently lead to false-negative di-\nagnoses, that is, classification of genu-\ninely disordered individuals as nondisor-\ndered, potentially leading to failure to\nobtain needed treatment.\nThis false-negative/false-positive ten-\nsion is nowhere more apparent than in\nthe DSM-IV bereavement exclusion for\nmajor depressive disorder (MDD). A\ndiagnosis of MDD requires at least 1\nmajor depressive episode (MDE) not\ncaused by bipolar or nonaffective psy-\nchotic disorders. Criteria for an MDE\nrequire at least 5 of 9 symptoms includ-\ning sadness or lack of interest or plea-\nsure, at least 2 weeks' duration, clinically\nsignificant impairment or distress, and\nexclusion of substance-induced and gen-\neral medical etiologies. However, some\nindividuals who meet these symptom\nand impairment criteria are not experi-\nencing a mood disorder but intense nor-\nmal sadness in response to bereavement.3\nThe DSM criteria for MDE use an exclu-\nsion criterion in an attempt to prevent\nAuthor Affiliations: School of\nSocial Work, New York\nUniversity, New York\n(Dr Wakefield); School of Social\nAdministration, Temple\nUniversity, Philadelphia, Pa\n(Dr Schmitz); Department of\nPsychiatry, Columbia University\nCollege of Physicians and\nSurgeons, and Biometrics\nResearch Department, New\nYork State Psychiatric Institute,\nNew York (Dr First); and\nDepartment of Sociology and\nInstitute for Health, Health\nCare Policy, and Aging\nResearch, Rutgers University,\nNew Brunswick, NJ\n(Dr Horwitz).\n\u00a92007 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nfalse-positive diagnoses, requiring that the symptoms\ncannot be better explained by bereavement.\nBereavement can sometimes trigger genuine mood dis-\norders. Thus, excluding all cases of bereavement from\nMDEs would yield false-negative diagnoses. The DSM ad-\ndresses this problem by using unusual duration, impair-\nment, or symptoms to identify exceptions to the bereave-\nment exclusion that likely represent true disorder. The\nDSM-IV, for example, classifies bereavement responses\nas MDEs if the symptoms last more than 2 months or if\nthere is marked functional impairment, morbid preoc-\ncupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psy-\nchotic symptoms, or psychomotor retardation.\nThe DSM uses the term \"complicated bereavement\"\nfor bereavement that triggers MDD. However, this term\nhas recently become widely used to also denote a non-\ndepressive mourning-related pathologic condition in-\ncluding such symptoms as unremitting yearning and sense\nof loss.4-6 To avoid confusion, we refer to bereavement-\ntriggered depressive disorder as complicated bereavement-\ntriggered depression.\nThe DSM criteria for MDD ignore the many other kinds\nof serious losses that can cause intense symptoms of nor-\nmal sadness. (We use the term \"sadness\" as a generic la-\nbel for normal and abnormal depressive responses to vari-\nous losses.) This asymmetry raises the question of whether\nthe DSM is justified in singling out bereavement as the\nonly type of loss that produces normal intense sadness\nsymptomatically similar to MDE.\nHistorical precedent, common sense, and research on\nloss responses all suggest that many types of losses can trig-\nger intense normal sadness. From early Greek and Ro-\nman physicians through Kraepelin and Freud to pre-DSM-\nIII diagnostic manuals, psychiatric thought generally\ndifferentiated depressive disorder from symptomatically\nsimilar sadness resulting from various losses including not\nonly bereavement but also romantic betrayal and rejec-\ntion, economic misfortune, severe physical illness, loss of\ncherishedpossessions,andfailuretoattainimportantgoals,\nAs is the case in bereavement,10,11 ample research sug-\ngests that many other types of loss, such as marital dis-\nsolution, unexpected job loss, and natural disasters, can\ntrigger intense sadness that soon after the loss may sat-\nisfy MDD symptom criteria yet often naturally desists with\ntime or when circumstances improve.12-21 Such intense\nsadness responses to major nonbereavement losses are\ngenerally considered normal.7,8,22 Moreover, the evi-\ndence suggests that intense sadness is a biologically de-\nsigned response to a broad range of circumstances, in-\ncluding separation from a love object and loss of social\nstatus.23,24 Evolutionary approaches to the distinction be-\ntween normal and disordered functioning,25-28 there-\nfore, imply that depressive symptoms should not auto-\nmatically be classified as a disorder, even at levels that\nsatisfy DSM symptom criteria, without considering the\nnature of their trigger. From this perspective, bereave-\nment may be considered a model for other types of loss\nresponses, which might similarly be grounds for exclu-\nsion from a diagnosis of MDD.\nLike bereavement, other stressors may also trigger com-\nplicated, truly disordered reactions. Consequently, if the\nbereavement exclusion were extended to other stress-\nors to avert false-positive diagnoses, the distinction be-\ntween complicated vs uncomplicated bereavement would\nalso have to be applied to other stressors to avoid false-\nnegative diagnoses.\nOur overarching view is that the DSM uncompli-\ncated vs complicated bereavement distinction reflects\nlikely nondisorder vs disorder but that grief is not unique\nin this regard and the same approach has comparable va-\nlidity for reactions to other types of loss. We tested 2 spe-\ncific hypotheses predicted by this view. First, uncompli-\ncated bereavement and uncomplicated reactions to other\nlosses are no different across a range of variables gener-\nally considered indicative of disorder (eg, duration, re-\ncurrence, and service use). Second, uncomplicated re-\nsponses to bereavement and to other losses are less severe\non such disorder indicators than are complicated reac-\ntions to either type of trigger. In effect, the second hy-\npothesis is a validity check on the uncomplicated-\ncomplicated distinction.\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nIt is difficult to compare complicated and uncomplicated epi-\nsodes in clinical samples, which generally exclude individuals\nfalling under the bereavement exclusion and contain few non-\ndisordered individuals. Thus, we used publicly available data\nfrom the first-wave National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), a com-\nmunity-based epidemiological survey administered between Sep-\n15 to 54 years who are representative of the US population.29\nThe NCS uses DSM-III-R\u00adderived algorithms for diagnos-\ning disorders, including MDD. Note that DSM-III-R criteria for\nMDD differ from DSM-IV criteria because they do not require\nclinically significant distress or impairment in addition to symp-\ntoms. The NCS operationalization of DSM-III-R MDD criteria\nrequire that a respondent satisfy 4 criteria. First, during a 2-week\nindex episode (for individuals with multiple episodes, the in-\ndex episode is the episode with the most symptoms), the re-\nspondent must report at least 1 symptom from each of 5 symp-\ntom groups or more (constructed to reflect DSM MDD symptom\ngroups), none of which are from organic causes. For example,\n1 symptom group includes lost appetite, lost weight, in-\ncreased appetite, or increased weight; another includes trouble\nin concentrating, slow thinking, or inability to make deci-\nsions. As in the DSM, 1 of the 5 endorsed symptom groups must\nbe either the sad-blue-gloomy group or loss of interest. Sec-\nond, the condition is not covered by the bereavement exclu-\nsion (see \"Uncomplicated vs Complicated Responses\"). Third,\nthe respondent must never have had mania or hypomania.\nFourth, the respondent does not have delusions or hallucina-\ntions indicative of nonaffective psychotic disorder, as indi-\ncated by either psychotic diagnoses or the occurrence of psy-\nchotic ideation for 2 weeks outside of affective episodes.\nTo test our hypotheses, we formed an overall analytic sample\nconsisting of 4 subsamples: uncomplicated bereavement trig-\ngered (n=56; 6.5% of the analytic sample); complicated bereave-\nment triggered (n=101; 11.6%); uncomplicated other loss trig-\n(n=536; 61.8%). These groups are derived from the NCS sample\n\u00a92007 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nin several steps; they exclude a considerable number of cases in\nwhich the NCS data set does not contain the necessary informa-\ntion. The Figure shows the sequence of steps by which the ana-\nlytic sample and its subgroups were identified. (The precise al-\ngorithms are available from the authors on request.)\nTo persons meeting lifetime NCS criteria for MDD, we added\nthose who meet other MDD criteria but are eliminated from\nMDD by the bereavement exclusion (n=65), yielding the MDD\npool (n=1308). All subsequent analyses use this expanded MDD\npool to enable comparisons of uncomplicated and compli-\ncated bereavement.\nWe next identified 2 MDD pool subsamples who reported\nthat either grief or other triggering events caused their epi-\nsodes (typical NCS questions were as follows: \"Did that pe-\nriod of feeling sad/blue occur just after someone close to you\ndied?\" \"Was there anything else going on in your life at that\ntime which caused you to feel sad/blue?\"). For analytic pur-\nposes, it is essential to identify the trigger of the index episode\nbecause that is the only episode for which the NCS reports de-\ntailed symptom information. (The index episode for single-\nepisode cases is the individual's only episode; for multiple-\nepisode cases, it is the individual's worst episode in terms of\nnumber of symptoms, or, if no episode is worse than others,\nthemostrecentepisode.)Toidentifybereavement-triggeredcases\n(n=157), we used the NCS algorithm for bereavement to iden-\ntify individuals whose index episode of MDD was bereavement-\ntriggered. The NCS instrument is such that only by identify-\ning those multiple-episode cases with all grief episodes could\nwe identify cases in which the index episode was bereavement\ntriggered; thus, even for multiple-episode cases, this is a pure\nbereavement sample. Analogously, other loss\u00adtriggered cases\n(n=710) included those in which the index episode was trig-\ngered by other loss, and multiple-episode cases included those\nin which no other episodes were bereavement triggered. This\nalgorithm allows nonindex other loss\u00adtriggered episodes to be\nuntriggered, but the NCS data do not permit us to determine\nexactly how often this occurred. However, the overall rate of\nuntriggered episodes in the sample was so low (5% of single-\nepisode cases and 4% of index episodes in multiple-episode\ncases) that this approximation to a purely other loss\u00adtriggered\ngroup seems warranted.\nOf single-episode MDD pool cases (n=410), 93% were either\nbereavement triggered (n=108) or other loss triggered (n=276)\nand are included in the analysis. We excluded 5% (n=20) be-\ncause they were untriggered and 1% (n=6) because of missing\ndata. Among multiple-episode MDD pool cases (n=898), 54%\n(n=483) had index episode triggers identifiable as grief or other\nloss and were included in the analysis. We excluded cases with\nmissing data (1%; n=6), those with untriggered index epi-\nsodes (4%; n=34), and those in which the type of index epi-\nsode trigger (bereavement vs other type of loss) could not be\ninferred from the data (42%; n=375). The type of index epi-\nsode trigger sometimes cannot be inferred because if an indi-\nvidual reports experiencing both types of triggers at various\ntimes, there is no way within the NCS data of establishing which\ntype specifically applies to the index episode.\nOur resulting analytic sample (n=867; 44% single-episode\ncases and 56% multiple-episode cases) consists of the 66% of the\nMDD pool that can be established to be either bereavement-\ntriggered (n=157) or other loss\u00adtriggered (n=710) cases. Mean\n(SD) demographic data for the analytic sample were as follows:\ndata did not differ significantly from those for the excluded 34%\nof the MDD pool. Table 1 indicates that these demographic char-\nacteristics are not significantly different between the bereave-\nment- and other loss\u00adtriggered categories.\nTo divide trigger groups into uncomplicated and complicated\ncategories, we strictly extended the NCS algorithm for differ-\nentiating uncomplicated vs complicated bereavement-\ntriggered episodes to nonbereavement, other loss\u00adtriggered epi-\nsodes. The NCS algorithm for complicated bereavement is\nderived from DSM-III-R criteria. The DSM-III-R exclusion clause,\nwhich differs slightly from the DSM-IV clause, states that \"Mor-\nbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, marked\nfunctional impairment or psychomotor retardation, or pro-\nlonged duration suggest bereavement complicated by major de-\nin First-Wave NCS Sample\nCases With a Single Episode\n410 Cases With Multiple Episodes\nCases With NCS Major Depressive Disorder\nPlus Excluded Bereavement Cases\nUncomplicated\nBereavement-Triggered\nCases\nBereavement-Triggered\nCases\nOther Loss\u00adTriggered\nCases\nOther Loss\u00adTriggered\nCases\nBereavement-Triggered Cases\n157 Other Loss\u00adTriggered Cases\nCases With\nBereavement\nTrigger\nOther Loss\nTrigger\nNo Trigger\nor Missing\nTrigger Data\nBereavement-Triggered\nIndex Episode\nLoss\u00adTriggered\nIndex Episode\nIndex Episode\nTrigger or\nMissing Trigger\nData\nBereavement- and\nOther Loss\u00adTriggered\nEpisodes: Index Episode\nTrigger Unknown\nFigure.

There-\nfore, the NCS requires 2 symptoms or more for complicated\nbereavement, unlike the later 1-symptom DSM-IV approach.\nThe NCS adds a sixth symptom, suicide attempt, to the DSM-\nIII-R list; it operationalizes prolonged duration as longer than\n12 weeks, and operationalizes marked impairment by agree-\nment with the item, \"Kept you from working or from seeing\nfriends or relatives.\" Bereavement and other loss\u00adtriggered epi-\nsodes are considered uncomplicated unless they are classifi-\nable as complicated based on having 2 or more of the 6 NCS\nduration, impairment, and other symptom features.\nWe could not evaluate each episode in multiple-episode cases\nfor complicatedness because the data only contain index epi-\nsode symptoms. We followed the NCS algorithm in classify-\ning multiple-episode bereavement cases as uncomplicated or\ncomplicated based on which category applied to the index epi-\nsode. The rationale was that the index episode was the indi-\nvidual's worst episode and complicated symptoms indicate se-\nverity; thus, an uncomplicated index episode likely implies all\nuncomplicated episodes. We applied this same procedure in\nother loss\u00adtriggered cases to identify uncomplicated vs com-\nplicated multiple-episode cases. There were no significant demo-\ngraphic differences among the 4 uncomplicated and compli-\ncated bereavement- and other loss\u00adtriggered groups for age, sex,\neducational achievement, or race/ethnicity (Table 2).\nTo evaluate whether the 4 groups (uncomplicated vs compli-\ncated bereavement-triggered and uncomplicated vs compli-\ncated other loss\u00adtriggered episodes) differ in disorder vs non-\ndisorder status, we compared the groups on descriptive variables\nthat have face validity and are commonly used to indicate dis-\norder. Three indicators concern index episode features: sever-\nity (mean number of the 9 MDD symptoms); melancholic de-\npression (percentage of patients satisfying DSM-IV\u00adtype criteria\nfor melancholic depression); and suicide attempt. Although the\nsuicide attempt indicator is contaminated because it is also an\nNCS complicatedness symptom, we included it because we think\nit is pragmatically important to establish whether cases involv-\ning suicide attempts would be classified as disorders.\nSix other disorder indicators concern lifetime history; thus,\nfor multiple-episode cases, these indicators do not necessarily\napply specifically to the index episode but set an upper bound-\nary for that episode. These 6 indicators are as follows: dura-\ntion (mean duration of the longest episode); interference with\nlife (whether episode or episodes interfered with life or activi-\nties \"a lot\"); ever saw a mental health professional because of\ndepression; ever took medication for depression; was ever hos-\npitalized because of depression; and recurrence (mean num-\nber of episodes). Note that duration is contaminated to some\nextent because duration longer than 12 weeks is a symptom of\ncomplicatedness. To reduce the effect of outliers on recur-\nrence and duration means, we coded respondents reporting more\nthan 20 depressive episodes as having 20 episodes, and respon-\ndents reporting their longest episode as lasting more than 104\nweeks as having a longest episode of 104 weeks.\nInterference with life and service use indicators follow the\nclinical significance disorder indicators of Narrow et al.31 Ser-\nvice use indicators are based on disorder-specific questions (eg,\nseeing a professional because of depression) to minimize con-\nfounding by service use for comorbid conditions.32 A long tra-\ndition considers melancholic depression as indicating disor-\nder.7 We constructed criteria that approximate DSM-IV\nmelancholic depression criteria, requiring inability to enjoy usual\nactivities plus 3 or more of the following: retardation observed\nby others, or agitation; feel bad in the morning; early awaken-\ning (at least 2 hours early); lost weight; and excessive feelings\nof guilt.\nTests of Significance\nAll data used in the analyses were weighted and corrected for\nsampling design. Statistical analyses were performed using the\nsurveyestimationproceduresinSTATAsoftware,version9(Stata-\nCorp, College Station, Tex), which calculate weighted coeffi-\ncients and use Taylor series linearization to calculate SE. Analy-\nsis of variance with planned comparisons were used to determine\nthe mean differences between groups. When doing the planned\ncomparisons, the nature of our 2 hypotheses dictated different\nstatistical procedures. We used 2-tailed tests to evaluate the hy-\npothesisthatuncomplicatedbereavement-triggeredvsotherloss\u00ad\ntriggered episodes are not different on disorder indicators. Be-\ncause we predicted that uncomplicated categories would be lower\nthan complicated categories on disorder indicators, we used\n1-tailed tests of our second hypothesis.\nStatistical Power\nBecauseourhypothesesproposenosignificantdifferencesinmean\nvalues of indicator variables between 2 groups (uncomplicated\nbereavement-triggeredvsuncomplicatedotherloss\u00adtriggeredepi-\nsodes), statistical power is an important concern.

An example of a small mean difference would be 10 weeks'\nduration, 0.3 in interference score, and 6% for proportion of cases\nseeing a mental health provider.

(Symptom differences between uncomplicated and\ncomplicated cases are assured by definition.) No signifi-\ncant differences were found for 8 of 9 symptom groups\n(see Table 4). The only significant difference is that the\nuncomplicated bereavement-triggered group endorsed the\nsuicide and death thought symptom group more fre-\nquently (80.6%) than the uncomplicated other loss\u00ad\ntriggered group (42.9%). This difference is entirely at-\ntributable to a significant difference between the 2 groups\nis understandable because the bereaved have recently been\nexposed to the death of a loved one.\nTable 3 also gives the results of tests of our second\nhypothesis, that uncomplicated bereavement- and other\nloss\u00adtriggered cases are lower on disorder indicators than\ncomplicated bereavement- and other loss\u00adtriggered cases.\nSeven indicators fully confirm this hypothesis: severity,\nmelancholic depression, suicide attempt, duration, in-\nterference, saw a professional, and took medication. The\nremaining 2 indicators partially confirm the hypothesis.\nResults for hospitalization support 3 of 4 subhypoth-\neses, but, contrary to our prediction, individuals in the\nuncomplicated bereavement group are not less likely to\nbe hospitalized than are those in the complicated other\nloss group. Results for recurrence confirm 2 of 4 subhy-\npotheses but do not indicate that either uncomplicated\nbereavement- or uncomplicated other loss\u00adtriggered cases\nare significantly less likely than complicated bereave-\nment cases to recur. Examination of significant differ-\nences between complicated and uncomplicated cases in-\ndicate that the effect sizes are medium to large.\nCOMMENT\nThe DSM bereavement exclusion acknowledges that some\nintense episodes of sadness that satisfy symptomatic cri-\nteria for MDD are not disorders; however, the exclusion\nincludes only bereavement and not responses to other\nTable 2.

Based on traditional distinctions between depres-\nsive disorder and normal intense sadness and on an evo-\nlutionary view of sadness and disorder, we hypoth-\nesized that the bereavement exclusion represents a valid\nattempt to avert false-positive diagnoses that applies\nequally to other losses. Using NCS data, we tested our\nhypothesis that bereavement and other losses are sym-\nmetric against the contention, implied by the DSM MDD\ncriteria, that bereavement is categorically different from\nother stressors on the dimensions assessed in this study.\nTheresultsoverwhelminglysupportourhypotheses.They\nconfirm 8 of 9 predicted relationships of no difference be-\ntween uncomplicated categories, regardless of the type of\ntrigger, and 33 of 36 predicted directional differences be-\ntween uncomplicated and complicated categories.\nThe results have substantial implications for MDD di-\nagnosis,especiallyinasmuchasbereavementorsomeother\nloss reportedly precedes more than 90% of index epi-\nsodes in MDD cases in the NCS. The results do not sup-\nport the current categorical distinction between uncom-\nplicated bereavement-triggered and uncomplicated other\nloss\u00adtriggered episodes. Rather, they imply that if the cur-\nrent criteria correctly label uncomplicated depressive epi-\nsodes after death of a loved one as nondisorders, then\nuncomplicated episodes that occur after other losses are\nalso plausibly nondisordered. Moreover, the differences\nbetween uncomplicated and complicated cases suggest\nthat the bereavement exclusion reflects a valid distinc-\ntion. Overall, our results suggest a potentially serious prob-\nlem with MDD in the diagnosis of responses to major non-\nbereavement losses.\nThese results also have implications for MDD preva-\nlence. The NCS reports a lifetime prevalence of 14.9%\nfor MDD, a figure that has caused much skepticism.2 Ex-\ntending the bereavement exclusion to our other loss\u00ad\ntriggered group, of which 24.5% of cases (2.2% of the total\nNCS sample) were uncomplicated, reduces NCS MDD\nprevalenceto12.7%.However,ouranalysisexcludesmany\ntriggered cases because the trigger was unidentifiable. Ex-\ncluding from diagnosis all NCS MDD cases with a trig-\nger that were uncomplicated decreases MDD preva-\nlence to 11.3%, an overall reduction of almost one fourth\nsimilarly reduced about one fourth, to 6.5%.\nDespite overall strong support for our hypotheses, there\nare several exceptions. Contrary to our first hypothesis,\nsignificantly fewer uncomplicated bereavement- than un-\ncomplicated other loss\u00adtriggered cases report that de-\npressive episodes interfered with life a lot (4.6% vs 12.4%;\nt=2.62). This finding is not repeated with other clinical-\nsignificance measures, and both uncomplicated catego-\nries are substantially lower on interference than either\ncomplicated bereavement-triggered or complicated other\nloss\u00adtriggered categories (grief, 4.6% vs 46.2%; other loss,\ning is that bereavement is a socially acknowledged and\nfrequently ritualized experience that often legitimates ex-\ncuses from normal responsibilities. In contrast, social\nnorms are less likely to allow withdrawal from normal\nrole functioning in other loss\u00adtriggered cases; thus, greater\ninterference with expectable levels of social engage-\nment and responsibility might be experienced.\nContrary to our second hypothesis, the 5% of hospi-\ntalized patients with uncomplicated bereavement-\ntriggered sadness is not significantly lower than the 8.9%\nof hospitalized patients with complicated other loss\u00ad\ntriggered sadness (t=0.87). We speculate that if bereave-\nment is more likely than other triggers to be considered\na health risk, providers may occasionally hospitalize pa-\ntients with uncomplicated sadness as a preventive mea-\nsure. This is an area worthy of further investigation.\nAlso contrary to our second hypothesis, neither un-\ncomplicated bereavement-triggered episodes nor uncom-\nplicated other loss\u00adtriggered episodes are significantly\nlower than complicated bereavement in mean recur-\nrence. However, these findings have a simple explana-\ntion; bereavement episodes, by definition, occur only af-\nter the death of a loved one and, thus, are severely\nconstrained insofar as recurrence. Thus, the failure of this\nprediction seems less a disconfirmation than an anoma-\nlous situation.\nThis study has several limitations. The age range of\nthe NCS sample (15-54 years) means that the sample does\nnot include the elderly, a major group affected by be-\nreavement and other losses, and a target of much recent\ndepression research; it remains for future research to dem-\nonstrate whether the present results can be generalized\nto this important group. Another limitation is that we\neliminated from analysis a substantial number of NCS\nmultiple-episode MDD cases in which it was reported that\nthe index episode was triggered, because the nature of\nthe NCS data does not allow us to identify the type of\ntrigger (bereavement vs other loss). In addition, we con-\nservatively accepted the NCS algorithm for identifying\nuncomplicated vs complicated episodes and did not em-\npirically examine alternative formulations. Further-\nmore, the accuracy of the NCS respondents' self-reports\nof triggering events is unknown; respondents may mis-\nremember whether there was an event or whether the tim-\ning of an event was before an episode or may misat-\ntribute the cause of an episode to an event when they were\nTable 4.

However, depressive symptoms can be mi-\nsattributed to death of a loved one and to other losses,\nand the crucial complicated vs uncomplicated distinc-\ntion we used is based on symptom reports and not on\ncausal self-attributions alone.\nAnother limitation is that we were unable to examine\nthe qualitative nature of nonbereavement triggers; such\nqualitative data were collected but are not publicly avail-\nablebecauseofinstitutionalreviewboardrestrictions.Con-\nsequently, we were unable to examine distinctions among\nnongrief stressors or to make finer discriminations of pro-\nportionality between stressor and symptoms, for ex-\nample, to judge when a reported trigger is not major and\nperhaps is so mild as to potentially suggest disorder even\nin uncomplicated episodes. Future studies should be de-\nsigned to identify and evaluate the stressors directly. Un-\ncomplicated bereavement-triggered and uncomplicated\nother loss\u00adtriggered groups might differ in ways we did\nnot detect; we can only say that at the level of detection\nthese data make possible, there is no reason to consider\nother loss\u00adtriggered conditions as substantially different\nfrom bereavement conditions on disorder indicators and,\nthus, no support for the current DSM asymmetry in ap-\nplying the complicated vs uncomplicated distinction to be-\nreavement but not to other stressors.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results, even if replicated, cannot by themselves\nfully resolve the issue of when to consider uncompli-\ncated depressive episodes as nondisordered. While there\nare clear cases of complicated conditions that are disor-\nders and uncomplicated conditions that are nondisor-\nders, there is also growing awareness that depressive symp-\ntoms occur on a continuum; thus, many clinical patients\nmight not fall clearly to one side or the other of the dis-\norder-nondisorder divide. Moreover, it might be argued\nthat our results for the disorder indicators are consis-\ntent with the position that uncomplicated episodes in re-\nsponse to both bereavement and other stressors are merely\nmild disorders. For example, Zisook et al,34 also noting\nthe asymmetry between bereavement and other losses in\nDSM MDD criteria, claim that the bereavement exclu-\nsion should be eliminated: \"No other life event (or pre-\ncipitant) negates the diagnosis of depression when the\nfull syndrome occurs. It is not clear why death of a loved\none should cancel out the diagnosis of major depressive\nOur findings, therefore, directly challenge only the cur-\nrent asymmetry between bereavement and other loss situ-\nations in the MDD bereavement exclusion. Given the ab-\nsence of an objective gold standard for differentiating\nclinical depression from normal sadness, further empiri-\ncal research should explore the prognostic, treatment, and\npolicy implications of different classifications of uncom-\nplicated nonbereavement episodes, as well as the con-\nceptual underpinnings of MDD.\nTraditionally, diagnosis of depressive disorder re-\nflected the notion that sadness in response to loss is natu-\nral and normal and that the indication of disorder lies in\nthe sadness being without sufficient cause in given en-\nvironmental contexts or being disproportional to actual\nloss.7 The DSM MDD complicated bereavement exclu-\nsion can be interpreted to mean that clinical depression\nshould be diagnosed if the response is symptomatically\nout of proportion even to loss of a loved one. In attempt-\ning to extend the bereavement exclusion to reactions other\nthan grief, further research is required to determine\nwhether DSM-type symptom severity criteria should also\nbe adopted for other stressors or, as much research sug-\nality that considers the typical or individual meaning of\nthe stressor is necessary and clinically feasible. In addi-\ntion, some other losses (eg, financial reversal or marital\nalienation) may be less clear-cut than death of a loved\none and it may be harder to judge the severity of these\nlosses, leading to challenges to reliable measurement. The\nimportance of reliability, however, does not obviate the\nneed to address substantial failures of validity. Al-\nthough death is clear-cut, the bereavement exclusion it-\nself depends on the complicated-uncomplicated distinc-\ntion, which is not clear-cut.\nIn extending our results to clinical practice, we do not\nintend to suggest that treatment after major stressors is\nappropriate only for individuals experiencing compli-\ncated episodes. So-called uncomplicated episodes can in-\nvolve substantial suffering and, in vulnerable individu-\nals, may evolve into complicated episodes. Treatment,\nincluding psychotherapy or medication,33 may some-\ntimes be appropriate for intense normal sadness. Never-\ntheless, the current DSM distinction between compli-\ncated vs uncomplicated bereavement-triggered depression\nhas implications for treatment planning, prognosis, and\nstigmatization. Our results suggest that the same rea-\nsons dictate recognition of intense normal sadness re-\nsponses to stressors other than bereavement. If further\nresearch confirms these findings, the DSM MDD bereave-\nment exclusion likely should be reconsidered in DSM-V,\nwith equal attention to bereavement and nonbereave-\nment triggers of intense sadness.\nCorrespondence: Jerome C.
