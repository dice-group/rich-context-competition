Crichlow *\nSchool of Criminology & Criminal Justice, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL 33431, USA;\n Keywords: community policing; social disorganization; crime prevention; communities and crime\n1. Introduction\nThe ebb and flow of police-citizen relations has garnered a great deal of attention from scholars\nand practitioners. The need to examine policing strategies is increasingly important due to the\nquestionable incidents of officer-involved shootings in minority communities in the United States.\nThe aftermath of public outrage often characterized by Black Lives Matter protests, and riots in some\ninstances are additional reasons why policing strategies are worthy of scholarly assessment. Some\nhave argued that community-oriented policing (COP) is part of a necessary prescription for building\ntrust in many large metropolitan areas where such police-civilian conflicts often occur (Gill et al. 2014;\nKelling and Moore 1988). It is also widely held that community-oriented approaches can be successful\nin reducing crime in problematic inner-city areas (Connell et al. 2008; Rosenbaum and Lurigio 1994).\nAlthough most empirical studies examine policing strategies such as COP within the context of\nlarge metropolitan cities and agencies, it is equally important to contribute to the limited research on\nsmaller populations to increase knowledge of the applicability of COP in less studied settings.\nIn addition, it is important to note that crime is not the sole burden of police. Rather than focusing\nsolely on policing strategies, it is reasonable to incorporate social factors into crime prevention\nframeworks (Brogden and Nijhar 2005). Based on this reasoning, we bring the theory of social\ndisorganization into this discussion. We suggest that the practical implications of COP and the\ntheoretical implications of social disorganization are complementary perspectives that ought to be\nconsidered together. Moreover, prior research shows that individuals living in socially\ndisadvantaged neighborhoods are more likely to hold less favorable views of police and experience\nhigher crime rates (Kubrin and Weitzer 2003; Sampson and Bartusch 1998), and neighborhoods that\nin theory should benefit the most from COP are often the locales that are most resistant to any type\nof formal control (Grinc 1994). It is also noteworthy that communities with weaker social ties and\nhigher levels of disorganization may be subject to higher crime rates due to changes in routine\nThe ongoing discussion on crime in communities should therefore not only comprise the\nimplementation of COP, but also solutions for improving social organization conditions. Throughout\nthe implementation stages of COP, if community conditions are not accounted for, the introduction\nof these strategies might prove to be more harmful than beneficial to some communities. With these\nissues in mind, this study examines the degree of community policing implementation while\ncontrolling for social disorganization factors. The analysis is based on data collected from a national\nsample of small police agencies and cities across the US. We also discuss the implications for police\npractice and directions for future research on crime prevention in smaller cities.\n1.1. The Context of Community-Oriented Policing Implementation\nIn our quest to understand the nuances of community-oriented policing, the exclusion of smaller\ndepartments and populations may be problematic due to the dissimilarities in how crime is generated\nwithin urban and rural areas. Moreover, the extent to which citizens are willing to act as co-producers\nof crime control alongside law enforcement also differs based on the social organization of the\ncommunities in which community-oriented policing is implemented (Gill et al. 2014; Greene and\nPelfrey 2001). Nonetheless, what has become increasingly evident amid recent backlashes against the\npolice, is that COP has become preferred to the traditional model of policing that relied largely on\nreactive measures such as issuing tickets and making arrests (Maguire and Mastrofski 2000; Pelfrey\nTo address the gap in the literature, in terms of nonmetropolitan communities, Wells and\nWeisheit (2004), used county-level data to examine whether crime-predicting variables used in urban\nmodels were in fact applicable to rural settings. Contrary to their original hypotheses, the researchers\nfound that ecological and structural characteristics predicted urban crime to a better extent than rural\ncrime, leaving them to conclude that the set of variables that best predicted crime in urban areas were\nnot the same variables that predicted rural crime rates.\nTherefore, understanding the context in which COP is implemented is extremely vital to the\nsuccess of the strategy. As noted by Brogden and Nijhar (2005), when community conditions are\nunaccounted for during the implementation of COP, the introduction of these strategies may prove\nto be more harmful than constructive to communities. Disregarding community composition, could\nmake the goal of reducing fear of crime, or increasing police legitimacy through the building of citizen\nrelationships, practically unattainable.\n1.2. Social Disorganization\nThe theory of social disorganization can be traced to the Chicago School and the work of Shaw\nand McKay (1942), and it has come a long way since its original conceptualization. Shaw and McKay\n(1942) were one of the first to argue that communities that lack necessary resources due to low\neconomic status would generally have weaker social cohesion (i.e., social ties) and in return be subject\nto higher crime rates. To further support the theory, recent literature has linked structural\ncharacteristics to crime and delinquency and has provided claims that informal controls can mediate\nthe relationship between the two (Bursik and Webb 1982; Hart and Waller 2013; Smith and Jarjoura\n1988). To extend the study of community social disorganization and crime beyond urban settings,\nOsgood and Chambers (2000) conducted county-level analysis on more than 250 nonmetropolitan\ncounties across four states. The study found not only that the themes from the theory are applicable\nto communities of all sizes, but also that nonmetropolitan communities present different patterns of\nstructural variables that are worth examining further.\nThe more recent studies on social disorganization seek to incorporate informal controls such as\ncollective efficacy and social cohesion to obtain a better understanding of community conditions and\ntheir relation to crime. Collective efficacy is a predictor of community functioning (Warner 2007) and\nis generally represented by trust in residents, a willingness to intervene in neighborhood problems\nand maintaining social controls for the common good (Sampson 2012). Social cohesion is formed\nthrough neighborhood interaction and generally leads to stronger social ties (Gau 2014; Sampson and\nRaudenbush 1999). Uchida et al. (2014) explain that when social cohesion and or trust among\nneighbors is at its peak, the potential to build upon collective action or collective efficacy is greater.\nIn short, however, it can be summarized that if a community is facing hardships and lacks necessary\ninformal controls needed to prevent crime, formal controls, such as the intervention of COP officers,\nWhen discussing the differential levels of disorganization in communities as they relate to crime\nand deviance, it is important not to neglect supporting theories such as routine activities and the idea\nof capable guardianship. Both the theory of social disorganization and routine activities share the\nidea that crime has a geography and, because human behavior is often situated in a particular place,\nthe location of crime must be heavily emphasized (Andresen 2006). Cohen and Felson (1979), the\nstudy often credited for developing the routine activity theory, contends that for crime to occur there\nmust be a motivated offender, a suitable target, and a perceived lack of guardianship. To relate this\ntheory back to social disorganization, it must be acknowledged that different locales--due to their\ndiffering socio-economic characteristics and demographics, display different routine activities which\nin turn leads to crime and deviance being neither uniformly or randomly distributed (Mustaine and\n1.3. Community-Oriented Policing\nCommunity-oriented policing strategies vary across agencies as some may require different\nstrategies to tackle unique community-related problems. This variance may be regarded as\ndisadvantageous to the extent that it prevents a uniform definition and implementation of COP,\nhowever, it is advantageous in the sense that each agency can implement the strategy as necessary to\nthe community that it serves. However, defining community-oriented policing is much easier said\nthan done. Consensus has not been reached on defining COP (Sozer and Merlo 2013), but it is\ngenerally referred to as a philosophy that aims to empower communities rather than control them.\nCOP encourages police to find solutions for a multitude of community problems and concerns such\nas crime, fear of crime, quality of life, and neighborhood conditions (Lord et al. 2009; Reisig and Parks\nSince its rise in popularity over the last thirty years, notably during the mid-1990s with the\ncreation of the Office of Community-Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office), many law\nenforcement agencies in the US have implemented programs that are generally in accordance with\nthe overall components of community policing (Somerville 2009; Morabito 2010). These components\ninclude community partnerships, organizational transformation and problem-solving, with terms\nsuch as \"community involvement\" and \"decentralization\" often used interchangeably (Somerville\nMost advocates of COP believe that it can strengthen cohesion among community residents as\nwell as social organization, further leading to reduced crime and disorder (Kerley and Benson 2000;\nSadd and Grinc 1994). It is important to understand, however, that community-oriented policing does\nnot flow in one direction--police to community--but instead works best when there is a flow\nbetween the two (Bain et al. 2014). To that point, a proactive style of policing is more likely to garner\npositive public perceptions of police and allow for COP initiatives to function more effectively (Wentz\nand Schlimgen 2012). Positive encounters with police should then theoretically increase community\nconfidence in police work and relationships in which members are willing to approach officers with\ntheir local problems (Bain et al. 2014). This in turn may lead to higher crime reporting rates in\ncommunities in which COP is implemented properly. This type of outlook should not be dismissed\nbut instead considered when answering the question as to why studies on COP effectiveness may\nhave varying conclusions regarding increasing and decreasing crime rates.\nGill et al. (2014) conducted a meta-analysis that included thirty-seven independent tests on COP.\nTheir study found evidence that community policing increased citizen satisfaction and perceptions\nof police legitimacy. However, regarding crime prevention, Gill et al. (2014) did not find any\nconsistent evidence to support the assumption that COP influences crime rates. Moreover, they found\nthat problem-solving strategies, whether utilized within an agency or not, also had no impact on\ncrime rates. In general, their study produced support for the main objective of COP in improving the\nrelationship between the community and public, but as noted by the researchers, their findings were\nalso a reflection of the complexities in the relationship between COP and all other variables, such as\ndisorder, fear, and social controls.\n1.4. Community-Oriented Policing and Nonmetropolitan Communities\nContributing to the limited research on COP and nonmetropolitan communities, Connell et al.\n(2008) examined whether community policing can reduce serious crime in a suburban setting. The\nresearchers used data from both, interviews conducted with officers involved in a COP initiative, as\nwell as crime rates over an eight-year period within the locations that COP was implemented.\nRunning a time series analysis on the data, the researchers found a significant reduction in property\nand violent crimes in areas that COP was implemented. Furthermore, the interview portion showed\nthat the officers involved in COP were very eager to implement strategies within their jurisdiction.\nOfficers who did not share this view within the department were able to switch beats and shift to\nother positions within the agencies. By doing so, the potential success of the COP strategies would\nnot be hindered by those who lacked interest in the intervention. This supports the argument made\nby Sadd and Grinc (1994), that in order for community-oriented policing to be successful, officers or\npersonnel must believe in the means and goals.\nSozer and Merlo (2013) provide a foundation for the present study, as their main objective had\nbeen to examine the relationship between level of implementation of COP and crime rates across\nvarious agency sizes. To observe this relationship, the researchers separated agencies by those\nthree dimensions were used to measure the level of COP implementation across agencies. These\nincluded community contribution, problem-solving partnerships and training, and problem-solving,\nwhich were all created through reducing 35 dichotomous variables through factor analysis. In the\nend, Sozer and Merlo (2013) found no evidence of COP in terms of a crime reduction effect, and in\ncontrast to expectations, the researchers found certain community policing strategies to be associated\nwith higher crime rates in both small and large cities.\nThe need to examine community-oriented policing implementation outside of urban areas is due\nin part to the recognition that structural variables present differently in nonmetropolitan locations\nthan they do in urban ones (Kaylen and Pridemore 2013; Osgood and Chambers 2000). As stated by\nAdams et al. (2005), more often than not, these smaller departments that lack empirical evaluations\nare those that comprise the majority of publicly funded law enforcement agencies. Moreover, since\ncommunity-oriented policing is based on the idea of strengthening the social organization of\ncommunities, it is surprising that an underwhelming amount of research has been directed towards\nexamining the relationship between the two, especially as various community characteristics might\nalso influence styles of policing (Maguire et al. 1997). The purpose of this present study is not only to\ndetermine COP's effect on violent and property crime, it is also to examine whether COP\nimplementation can predict crime rates when controlling for social disorganization.\n2. Materials and Methods\nThis study merges three data sets--The 2013 Law Enforcement Management and Administrative\nStatistics Survey (LEMAS), the 2012 Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), and the 2012 US Census 5-Year\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS). The aim was to examine both the implementation of COP\nwithin 309 law enforcement agencies as well as social organization and crime rates in the areas where\nthese agencies are located. The study sought to answer the following questions: (1) Is the\nimplementation of community policing predictive of crime rates, controlling for agency size and\nindicators of social disorganization? (2) Are characteristics of social disorganization predictive of\ncrime rates in small cities? It was hypothesized that there would be an inverse relationship between\nthe degree of COP implementation and crime rates. It was also expected that variables pertaining to\nsocial disorganization would influence both property and violent crime rates.\nTo create a sample of smaller-sized law enforcement agencies and jurisdictions, only those\nemploying between 40\u00ad80 full-time sworn personnel were included within the study. Therefore, from\nthe initial LEMAS dataset comprised of 2822 law enforcement agencies, the following agencies were\neliminated: 895 sheriff's offices, 50 state agencies, agencies with 100 or more sworn personnel, and\nagencies with 39 or fewer sworn full-time personnel. Moreover, after merging and examining all three\ndatasets, 3 agencies were eliminated due to an extensive amount of missing LEMAS data, 1 agency\nwas eliminated due to not holding a primary jurisdiction within the ACS or UCR data, and 15\nagencies were deleted as there was neither property nor violent crime rate data available. The final\nsample size therefore consisted of 309 law enforcement agencies.\nThe dependent variables, property and violent crime rates, were generated from the 2012 Crime\nReporting Program using the FBI's classifications for each offense. Burglary, larceny-theft, and motor\nvehicle theft were combined to form the property variables, whereas murder, forcible rape, robbery,\nand aggravated assault were combined to form the composite violent crime variable. Although arson\nis a part of the FBI property crime classification, it was not included in the present study as issues\nexisted in reporting. To control for population size, crime rate per 1000 residents was used.\n2.1. Measuring Community-Oriented Policing Implementation\nRegarding the measurement of COP implementation, we used 2013 LEMAS data to generate a\nsingle composite-variable. At the time of writing, these were the most recent available national-level\ndata on the subject. Variables that best fell in line with the overarching theme of COP presented by\nthe Office of Community-Oriented Policing Services (COPS) were selected to form an index variable.\nThese variables included problem-solving partnerships, geographic assignment of officers, the\nencouragement of SARA\u00adtype (Scanning, Analysis, Response, and Evaluation) problem-solving\nprojects, the utilization of information from community survey, and lastly, at least 8 h of in-service\nCOP training. These variables, which were captured through the survey design in a dichotomous\nfashion, were then coded into new variables in which 0 signified \"no,\" and 1 signified \"yes.\" Within\nthe context of the index variable, a 0 therefore meant no implementation whereas 5 highlighted the\nimplementation of all variables within an agency. The variations of implementation are depicted in\nFigure 1. Frequency of COP implementation.\nIt is evident from the descriptive statistics that of the 309 law enforcement agencies selected for\nthe study, the majority of agencies (n = 77), reported implementing at least 3 of the 5 community-\noriented policing strategies included in this study, whereas only 27 implemented all 5 strategies\nwithin their agencies. The remaining agencies reported implementing zero, one, two, or four\nstrategies and of the 309 agencies, seven agencies did not report for any of these five strategies and\nare not depicted in the figure. In addition, the total number of full-time sworn personnel was used as\na control for law enforcement agency size. Based on the definition provided by LEMAS, sworn\npersonnel are deputies and law enforcement officers with general arrest powers. Only agencies\nemploying between 40\u00ad80 full-time sworn personnel were included in the study to depict smaller-\nsized agencies.\n2.2. Measuring Social Disorganization\nThe underlying theme of social disorganization emphasizes both environmental and social\ncharacteristics in explaining the etiology of crime and anti-social behavior (Shaw and McKay 1942).\nThis study utilized the Census Bureau's 2012 American Community Survey to depict the social\norganization of cities in which community-oriented policing was implemented. The variables\nincluded were the percentage of individuals whose income was below the poverty level, percentage\nof individuals foreign-born, percentage of female householders with children under the age of 18\nwith no husband present, and percentage of the population black or African American (See Table 1).\nAlthough the study initially incorporated the percentage of renter occupied housing units, the\nvariable was removed due to its high level of collinearity with the percentage of individuals whose\nincome is below the poverty level.\nTable 1. Measures of Central Tendency of Independent, Dependent, and Control Variables (n = 309).\nVariable Minimum Maximum Range Mean Median Standard Deviation\nAlthough skewed data indicates that outliers exist, in a study examining the social organization\nof 309 various cities located across the US, these outliers are almost expected. Moreover, the variation\nin variables such as the percentage of population black or African American or percentage of\nindividuals whose income is below the poverty level for example, are a clear indicator of the\nimportance of taking the social context of communities into consideration when deploying policing\nstrategies.\nIn order to yield a model that infers any relationship between variables and their predictive\npower within the observed populations, the statistical technique utilized for this study was ordinary\nleast square (OLS) regression. This allows for the identification of any unique contributions made by\nthe key independent variables and likewise allows for the determination of how well the model\naccounts for or explains the variations that occur in the dependent variable.\n3. Results\nTo gain better understanding of the impact of each of the variables included within the\ncommunity-oriented policing implementation outside of the index variable, the model depicted in\nTable 2 examines each community policing strategy and its overall impact on the variation of both\nproperty and violent crime rates separately. Table 3 shows the impact of the composite COP variable\nand its effect on crime rates alone without the inclusion of any social disorganization characteristics.\nTable 2. Multiple Regression Model for Individual COP Variables and Property and Violent Crime\nVariable B SE B Beta Sig. B SE B Beta Sig.\nWhen examined individually, the five community-oriented policing strategies, including\nproblem-solving partnerships, geographic assignment of officers, the encouragement of SARA--type\nproblem solving projects, the utilization of information from community surveys, and at least 8 hours\nof in-service COP training showed no significant contributions to the variations of property and\nviolent crime rates. Both models held very low R-values of 0.108 in the property crime model, and\n0.175 in the violent crime model. Therefore, given the low R-values and F ratios that are not\nstatistically significant, the models did not hold high explanatory power. Likewise, although\ninsignificant it is interesting to note that a one-increment increase in the geographic assignment of\nofficers (beat patrol), and the utilization of information from community surveys were associated\nwith higher rates of reported property crimes.\nTable 3. Regression Model for COP Composite Variable (n = 309).\nB SE B Beta Sig. B SE B Beta Sig.\nThe regression model for the community-oriented policing composite variable provides similar\nresults to the findings presented in Table 2. Although an argument can be made that community-\noriented policing implementation alone makes no significant contribution to the variation of property\nand violent crime rates, the null results should not be viewed in a negative light. Instead, it should\nbe noted that the overall directions of the results displayed in Table 3 are in the direction originally\nhypothesized. Nonetheless, the R-value of the property crime model is extremely low, at only 0.021\nwhereas the R-value of the violent crime model reaches 0.080. In addition, both F-ratios are not\nstatistically significant, further indicating the lack of contribution made to the models by the\ncomposite variable.\nThe full model demonstrates the changes in significance when theory and practice are\nintegrated. In Table 4, property crime rate per 1000 and violent crime rate per 1000 are regressed\nagainst the following variables, the total number of full-time personnel, COP implementation,\npercentage of the population black or African American, percentage of individuals foreign-born,\npercentage of female householders with child under the age of 18 and no husband present, and\npercentage of individuals whose income is below the poverty level, using the enter method.\nTable 4. Final OLS Regression Model for Property Crime and Violent Crime Rates per 1000 (n = 309).\nVariable B SE B Beta Sig. B SE B Beta Sig.\nFemale;\nPoverty\nLevel\nAccording to Hinton et al. (2014), the closer the R-value is to 1.00, the higher the explanatory or\npredictive power of the model. Evaluating the results of the multiple regression model displayed in\nTable 4, the property crime rate model had an approximate R-value of 0.587, whereas the violent\ncrime model held an R-value of 0.561. The predictive power of the models as determined through the\nANOVA test and F ratio indicated a statistically significant result at the 0.000 level for property crime\nrates (25.75) and likewise a statistically significant result for violent crime rates (21.69). This is an\nindication that the models' predictions of changes in the dependent variables are more accurate than\njust chance alone. The property crime model accounted for 34.4% of the variance in the population,\nwith an adjusted R-Square of 33.1%. In terms of the violent crime model, the model accounted for\n31.5% of the variance in the population with an adjusted R-Square of 30.1% indicating a slightly more\npowerful property crime model than the latter. Provided that most models in criminal justice research\ndo not exceed 40% (Weisburd and Britt 2007), it can be said that both models predict crime rates fairly\nwell. The contribution of individual variables within the models will be examined subsequently.\n3.2. The Property Crime Model\nThe control variable of full-time sworn personnel had the second weakest contribution to the\nmodel with a Beta of -0.033. However, it was found that a one-increment increase in the amount of\nfull-time sworn personnel resulted in a 0.054 decrease in property crime per 1000, which is in the\ndirection hypothesized but not statistically significant. The amount of COP implementation, which\nranged on a 0\u00ad5 scale, did not make a statistically significant contribution to the property crime model\nas it had the lowest Beta of -0.001. However, a one-increment increase in the amount of\nimplementation resulted in a 0.017 decrease in crime, which is also in the direction hypothesized but\nnot holding any statistical significance. The percentage of the population black or African American\nhad a rather weak contribution to the property crime model with a Beta of 0.039. Although not\nstatistically significant, a one-increment increase in Black or African American individuals resulted\nin an increase of property crimes per 1000 by 0.041, which is in the direction originally hypothesized.\nA significant predictor to the property crime model was the independent variable of percentage\nforeign-born individuals with a Beta of -0.236. This variable had an unstandardized coefficient of\n-0.435, therefore holding all other variables constant, a one-increment increase of foreign-born\nindividuals equates to a decrease of 0.435 in property crime rates per 1000. Although in the direction\nhypothesized, it is important to note that this result is contrary to the theory of social disorganization,\nwhich asserts that communities with more foreign-born individuals have less social cohesion and\nmore crime.\nPercentage of female householder with child under the age of 18 and no husband present was\nthe second strongest and significant predictor of property crime rates with a Beta of 0.272. This\nvariable had an unstandardized coefficient of 1.442, which means that holding all other variables\nconstant, a one-increment increase in the percentage of female householders equates to a 1.442\nincrease in property crime rates per 1000, an expected result in accordance to the hypothesis. In terms\nof contribution to the prediction, the percentage of individuals whose income is below the poverty\nlevel was the highest significant predictor of property crime rates per 1000 with a Beta of 0.273. This\nvariable had an expected unstandardized B coefficient of 0.513, which means that a one-increment\nincrease in the number of individuals whose income is below the poverty level equates to a 0.513\nincrease in property crimes per 1000. Thus, a 10% increase would result in an additional 5 crimes per\nperson.\n3.3. Violent Crime Model\nIn the violent crime model, full-time sworn personnel also had the second weakest contribution\nwith a Beta of 0.068, indicating that a one-increment increase in full-time sworn personnel resulted in\na 0.029 increase in violent crime. Not only was this result insignificant, it was also not in the direction\nhypothesized. Moreover, COP implementation also made a weak contribution to the model with a\n-0.057 Beta. However, a one-increment increase in the amount of implementation within an agency\nresulted in a 0.204 decrease in crime, a result greater than what was seen with the property crime\nmodel. Nonetheless, while this result is in the direction hypothesized, it did not hold any statistical\nsignificance. Percentage of the population black or African American had a rather strong and\nsignificant contribution to the model with a beta of 0.136. This result is in the direction hypothesized.\nThe percentage of foreign-born individuals did not make a significant contribution to the model,\nholding a Beta of -0.083. However, similar to the property crime model, a one-increment increase of\nforeign-born individuals also resulted in a 0.040 decrease in violent crime rates per 1000, a result in\nagreement with the hypothesis but in overall contrast to social disorganization literature. The\nstrongest contribution to the model was made by the percentage of female householders with\nchildren under the age of 18 and no husband present, with a Beta of 0.322. These findings reflect the\nhypothesis and literature on the theory of social disorganization. Lastly, percentage of individuals\nwhose income is below the poverty level also made a strong significant contribution to the model.\nThese findings are consistent with decades of research on poverty and crime.1\n4. Discussion\nThe purpose of this study was to observe the variations of community-oriented policing\nimplementation within smaller agencies while accounting for the social context. Predictors of social\ndisorganization alongside community policing variables were examined to assess their impact on\nboth property and violent crime rates within smaller locales. To measure implementation, five main\nstrategies that fell under the general definition of community-oriented policing were combined to\nform an additive scale in which all variables were comprised of equal weight. These strategies\nincluded problem-solving projects, utilization of community surveys, the encouragement of SARA\u00ad\ntype problem-solving projects, the geographic assignment of officers, and at least 8-h of in-service\ncommunity policing training.\nOf the 309 agencies observed, the majority (77) of these agencies implemented at least three of\nthe five strategies within their departments, whereas only 27 reported implementing all five.\nAlthough it was hypothesized that controlling for both agency size and social disorganization, a\ngreater degree of COP implementation would be associated with fewer property and violent crime\n1 We also conducted a poisson regression with these data to determine whether this would make a difference\nin the observed relationships. However, there were no noteworthy differences found when comparing the\nfindings from the OLS model and the additional analyses. Additional analyses can be provided upon request.\nrates across smaller locales, this study did not find any strong evidence to justify that community-\noriented policing implementation impacts city-level crime rates (Gill et al. 2014; Kerley and Benson\n2000; Sozer and Merlo 2013). It is important to note, however, that although not statistically\nsignificant, the findings of the study were in the direction hypothesized and call for further\nconsideration.\nThe null results can be explained as follows. First, the adoption of community policing occurred\nat a time in which the professional model became highly criticized and deemed ineffective (Roh and\nOliver 2005). Agencies that began implementing COP shifted away from reactive measures and\nprimarily focused on finding ways to proactively respond to crime and on becoming more attentive\nto physical and social community disorder to decrease fear of crime and find solutions to local\nproblems. It was not until the mid-1990s, with the establishment of the Justice Department's Office\nof Community-Oriented Policing Services, that crime reduction became an increasingly important\nobjective behind particular strategies (Skogan 2006). As a result, community-oriented policing began\nto be evaluated in terms of its crime reduction potential. However, as stressed by Gill et al. (2014), it\nis ironic that researchers continue to dedicate time and resources towards evaluating COP on its\nability to reduce crime rates. It has become clear that achieving a direct impact on crime rates was\nnever the primary objective of COP to begin with. Therefore, by disregarding the success of\ncommunity policing on factors such as the decrease in fear of crime or increase in police legitimacy,\nand instead deeming the practice as either effective or ineffective based solely on its ability to impact\ncrime rates, defies the basis of the philosophy.\nCommunity policing, based on its success in creating positive shifts in police-citizen culture,\nshould instead be regarded as a catalyst for social change and order. The reduction of fear of crime is\njust as important as the reduction of crime rates themselves and allows for a community to self-police.\nIndividuals will not act on crime control if they have any indication or fear that their actions may\naffect their safety in any way (Bureau of Justice Assistance 1994). Furthermore, when police engage\nin community-oriented strategies that indirectly impact crime, they potentially improve relationships\nwith the public while increasing police presence. This increased level of presence alone, has the ability\nto raise levels of satisfaction among community members, allowing for the growth of social cohesion\nand collective efficacy within their communities to occur (Trojanowicz 1983). An increase in informal\ncontrols likewise increases the likelihood that formal authorities, such as COP officers within the\ncommunity, will be contacted when criminal or deviant activity occurs. Therefore, though it may\nseem paradoxical, it should be expected that communities with effective COP implementation will in\nfact have higher rates of reported crime in the short-term.\nWhen it comes to integrating practice with theory, scholars have suggested that community-\noriented policing must be cognizant of the characteristics of the community in which it is\nimplemented. COP is also at its strongest when risk factors or influences of crime such as economic\ndisadvantage or varying levels of family disruption are considered (Sherman and Eck 2006; Sozer\nand Merlo 2013). Implementing any type of formal control, without considering social context may\ninstead lead to a backfire effect which can be manifested in declining public support for police. This\nhas become evident in disorganized locales in Fergusson, Missouri and Baltimore, Maryland, after\nhighly publicized incidents involving police use-of-force decisions and the death of unarmed\nresidents. The influence of some social disorganization factors supports the assertion that there\nremains a need to assess policing strategies and the extent to which they are implemented within\ncommunities. The main findings are addressed below.\nExtant research has provided evidence that neighborhoods with more concentrated\ndisadvantage generally experience an increase of crime over a period of time (Bellair 1997; Hart and\nWaller 2013; Sampson and Groves 1989). While the findings of this study are in support of prior\nresearch, it cannot be assumed that disadvantage necessarily causes more crime. Although this is\noutside the scope of this study, there may be evidence of reciprocal effects between disadvantage and\ncrime, in that, crime and disadvantage are bidirectional in nature--each variable is influenced by the\nother. In addition, the race variable in this study presented noteworthy findings. While scholars have\nsuggested that social disorganization is far more prominent in communities with a higher percentage\nof Black or African American individuals, our findings are in support of Hipp (2010) who found no\nrelationship between the percentages of population Black or African American and property crime,\nbut a positive association with violent crime. With more recent literature breaking the stereotype\nassociated with people of color, one may question whether race is merely a proxy for social factors\nthat impact residents who live in cumulatively poor conditions.\nWe must also consider the influence of family disruption on crime. This proved to be one of the\nstrongest contributors to the full model. There was a significant positive relationship between both\nproperty and violent crime rates and the percentage of female-headed households with children\nunder the age of 18 and no husband present. As expressed by Silva (2014), due to significantly less\nparental monitoring within households, communities with a higher degree of family disruption not\nonly experience weaker social controls, but also predict crime rates to a greater extant. Nonetheless,\nimplementing community policing initiatives within these communities that may drive children\naway from acts of deviance may alleviate the degree to which crime occurs. This once again addresses\nthe importance of viewing COP as, at best, an indirect crime fighting tool.\nThis study is not without limitations. Due to the lack of a uniform definition of community\npolicing, as well as a uniform system of implementing strategies within agencies, the measurement\nconstructed for COP implementation in this study may not have been an accurate representation of\nimplementation across all agencies. Moreover, there may be significant differences between small\ntown or rural policing organizations and larger urban areas. Caradelli et al. (1998) suggested that\ncommunity policing might not be implemented to its full potential in many smaller locales as officers\nassume community cohesion and social control mechanisms are deeply rooted in such tight knit\ncommunities. This type of reliance may translate into less formally structured strategies being\nimplemented.\nIn addition to differential implementation, the binary approach in coding the implementation of\nindividual COP items (0 = No, 1 = Yes) did not capture the nuances of design and community policing\nstrategies within departments. This limitation may be traced to the data itself. With most community\npolicing questions requiring departments to either answer yes or no, the results of the 2013 LEMAS\nsurvey did not acquire optimal explanatory power. Thus, while the questions allow for the basic\nassessment of whether agencies utilize COP strategies, there is no knowledge of how these strategies\nare implemented and to what degree. This leads to further problems in addressing similarities across\ndepartments. More in-depth investigations may reveal that two departments utilizing the same\nstrategy may in fact be implementing it in a vastly different manner. Police departments may even\nbe implementing strategies that are praiseworthy in nature but yet do not reflect the needs of their\ncommunities.\nIssues with the measurement of social disorganization can also be addressed. Due to data\nlimitations the theory was not tested at the community level but at the city level. Although it can be\nargued that the theory should be tested at varied levels in order to contribute to literature, examining\nthe theory under such a broad scope did not allow for the measurement of variables that are generally\naccounted for in the extended models of the theory (friendship networks, social ties). It is evident that\nsince the re-establishment of the theory, studies conducted on social disorganization incorporate\nsocial ties and informal controls such as collective efficacy and cohesion into their models as they\nplay a vital role in achieving the best representation of community social disorganization. However,\nthe inclusion of these variables could have potentially hindered the study, as a precise definition of\nthese concepts is lacking. As explained by Kubrin and Weitzer (2003), this conceptual fuzziness does\nnot allow for a clear understanding of the distinction between certain variables such as social ties and\ninformal controls.\nIt is also acknowledged that the crime rates used in this study may have been underreported.\nA shortcoming of the UCR data is that only crimes known to police are included and not reports of\nvictimization. Local police therefore may underestimate the true value of crime given that all\nindividuals in a community report their experiences. It should also be considered that unreported\ncrime may be resolved through internal community action rather than formal law enforcement\nprocedures, and this phenomenon may not be reflected in official crime statistics (Winfree and\nNewbold 1999). While it is acceptable to use UCR data despite these limitations, future research\nshould consider using National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data and further comparing the\nresults across data sources. This study utilized a cross-sectional design. Depending on the context of\na study, focusing on only one time period may not necessarily produce the most accurate results and\nmay not be able to capture change in demographics, COP implementation and crime rates. As argued\nby Steenbeek and Hipp (2011) there are pros and cons to using cross-sectional data as opposed to\nlongitudinal data. Still, although longitudinal data is useful in studying long-term effects, it is also\nimportant to focus on a central time period in which certain processes occur.\n4.2. Policy Implications\nThe policy implications that can be derived from this exploratory study largely pertain to the\nconsideration of social context in the process of implementing community-oriented policing\npractices, especially in small cities which might not be as diversified as their counterparts. However,\nwhat has become overwhelmingly evident from this present study is that COP implementation,\nwhether examined in a singular manner or as a composite measurement, holds very little predictive\npower in the context of crime rates. Instead it is clear that some determinants of social disorganization\nmay impact the success of community-policing strategies or prevent them from reaching statistical\nsignificance within the models.\nAs stated by Hughes and Rowe (2007), the community is at the heart of not only political policies\nbut also those involving policing. With this in mind, the central focus of police departments\nimplementing COP should be on improving social controls through the increase of police legitimacy\n(i.e., increase faith in police) and the decrease in fear of crime. If a disjuncture exists between\ncommunity members and local police, negative perceptions towards police could persist despite their\nbest efforts (Bain et al. 2014). This gap can be filled if opportunities are provided for communities to\nbe actively involved in implementing community-oriented, strategies rather than merely being\ninformed of the types of community policing initiatives that exist (Kerley and Benson 2000).\nIn a study focused on community members' perceptions of police, Crichlow and McGarrell\n(2015) highlighted the significance of both proper police treatment and quality of police performance\non police legitimacy. Not only are members of communities that lack the necessary trust in authority\nmore inclined to disobey the law (Sunshine and Tyler 2003), these communities also generally lack\nstable social controls that can further impact the success of COP implementation (Warner et al. 2010).\nFor COP implementation to thrive effectively, community-policing officers must recognize that\nvaried community constituencies (i.e., individual citizens, business associations) bring differing\nperspectives and ideas to the overall discussion on local problems (Lab 2003). Without the\ncooperation of both community members and COP officers, problem-solving strategies may not\nproperly target the real issues that communities face. In a study involving the Los Angeles Police\nDepartment, many officers within the community police unit admitted to being unaware of what the\nphilosophy specifically entailed or required of them (Glen et al. 2003). Considering the inclusion of\ntraining in the implementation process of COP, this should never be the case. However, as noted by\nLab (2003) this lack of understanding is the result of the amount of weight still placed on taking\nreports, criminal codes, making arrests and other similar tasks, whereas more emphasis should\ninstead be placed on problem-solving, identifying intervention strategies and community advocacy.\nIn addition, the inherent challenges of policing predominantly Black or African American\ncommunities cannot be overlooked. Although the argument that racial disparities do not exist within\npolicing is untenable, based on the findings of this study it would be unreasonable to suggest that all\nsmall cities with a higher percentage of Black or African American individuals are prone to a higher\nrange of crime rates. Policy should focus on the organizational culture within police departments and\nprioritize police legitimacy in order to address issues in police-citizen conflict.\n5. Conclusions: Directions for Future Research\nTo address measurement issues and to translate implementation efforts into comparable data\nacross agencies, we recommend that more rigorous research should be conducted with a small\nsample of police agencies to assess variation in implementation strategies. Although LEMAS\nprovides data on various aspects of policing, the community-policing portion of the survey does not\nprovide a clear picture of an agency's level of implementation. In addition, there is a need to evaluate\nofficer outlook on the community policing philosophy itself. Research has demonstrated the\nimportance of officer perception and its linkage to community-oriented policing effectiveness\nsuch as COP are heavily reliant on support and input from law enforcement personnel.\nAlthough the implementation process is not standard, there is a degree of consistency in regard\nto the overarching concept of community-oriented policing. Community policing models\nimplemented within agencies can help to define roles for officers to ensure effective and consistent\nimplementation. Whether proper training is provided is another important concern. Graziano et al.\n(2013) note that training is the primary vehicle through which change in American policing is\norchestrated, yet very little controlled research has been conducted on the subject. We agree that\nresearch on training effectiveness, especially in the implementation of such strategies, must be further\nexamined.\nWe must also ask whether grouping all five of the implementation variables into an index\nvariable provided insight into the nuances of COP. Future research must consider going beyond\nbroad terms and examine whether the pairing or grouping of selected strategies may be more\nbeneficial to some locales. This could be managed through conjunctive analysis techniques, which\nwould represent all possible combinations of implementation that could be observed simultaneously\n(Hart and Miethe 2011). This might also shed light on the compatibility of particular strategies and\nwhether or not such strategies may be contradictory to the needs of the community.\nRegarding social disorganization theory, future research should aim to incorporate the full\nmodel of the theory. This would require emphasis on intervening variables and measurement of\nsocial cohesion and friendship networks among other variables. As noted by Kerley and Benson\n(2000), when linking the social disorganization theory to community policing implementation, there\nis a need for additional measures of community characteristics or processes to be tested in various\nsettings with a rich variety of COP strategies.\nThe continuing interest in policing strategies and crime control is likely to develop more insight\ninto unanswered questions regarding community-level explanations of crime. The null findings\nconcerning COP implementation within this study and others are therefore not disheartening but\ninstead are a part of an empirical process of trial and error. What is evident, however, is that\npopulation or community demographics play a salient role, not only in the implementation process,\nbut ultimately on the success of community-oriented policing. Therefore, law enforcement agencies\nmight consider the social context of the communities they serve and implement policing strategies\nthat are tailored with these characteristics in mind. While community policing's impact on crime is\ninconclusive (Gill et al. 2014; Sozer and Merlo 2013), research pertaining to policing and community\nrelations is still needed. Given the current state of policing, and questions pertaining to police\nlegitimacy, police should be encouraged to build stronger relationships with the public, and law\nenforcement agencies are encouraged to also take community factors into account when\nimplementing COP.\n"
