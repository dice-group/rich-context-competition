[cries] We don't talk about it. . . .\nIt's not diabetes where you need regular treatment, and it's not\nTERT syndrome or any other known syndrome. The very fact\nthat it's not spoken about means that I have a secret--a secret\nI'm aware of because it wasn't repaired from birth and I had to\nlive on pills. I'm telling you that from birth they hooked me up\nto a \"respirator\" that I can only be disconnected from when I'm\nHearing this testimony represented a foundational,\ninsightful moment for me as a person who has been research-\ning the intersexed body for the past 7 years. This was the\nmoment at which I first understood the significance and pro-\nfound power of the secret in the everyday living experience\nof many intersexed people. I had known that intersexed peo-\nple were told lies and lived with secrecy (Chase, 1998; Cote,\nPreves, 2003), yet, even when for years the secret and secrecy\nsurrounding intersexed people made it difficult for me to col-\nlect research data and contact intersexed people and parents\nof intersexed children and adults in Israel, I accepted this\nsituation as a given, assuming that the phenomenon itself\nwas an extremely private matter, kept within the confines of\nhospitals to maintain patients' privacy.1 But when Or cried\nand explained how the secret controls and damages her social\nand familial life and how suicidal thoughts ran through her\nhead, I realized that I needed to reframe the secret as a force-\nful social agent that threatens the very being of intersexed\npeople. In my doctoral dissertation Meoded Danon, 2012), I\nexamined the ways in which the secret is a significant part of\nthe medical treatment of intersexed people in Israel and other\nexplored the ways in which the secret is reproduced by par-\nents of intersexed children and becomes part of family lives.\nIn this article, I focus on the embodied particular experi-\nence of the secret in the narratives of three intersexed adults.\nI chose to focus on only three narratives to explore in depth\neach individual's experience of living with an intersexed\nbody and the secret that surrounds it. While every participant\nin this study experienced the powerful secrecy that surrounds\ntheir bodies and is manifested in the complexity of the body/\nsecret relationship, the narratives of these three participants\nin particular highlight the complexity of living with the\nsecret and secrecy as well as the practice of body/secrecy in\nfamilial, medical, and personal relations. Hence, I chose to\nfocus on each of these narratives to reveal the particular,\nunique living experiences that they portray.\nIn these narratives, the motifs of secrets and secrecy are\nprominent, as they are in narrative studies and other kinds of\nstudies that focus on the life experiences of intersexed peo-\nple. Secrets and secrecy characterize both treatment policies\nand the behavior of the parents of intersexed people, thus\ncomprising an integral element in their life stories. Secrets\n1Ben Gurion University, Beer-Sheva, Israel\nCorresponding Author:\nLimor Meoded Danon, PhD, Ben Gurion University of the Negev,\nBeer-Sheva, P.O.B 653, Israel.\nEmail: limormdanon@gmail.com\nThe Body/Secret Dynamic: Life\nExperiences of Intersexed People in Israel\nLimor Meoded Danon1\n Keywords\nintersexed people, body, secret, min-guf process, Israel\n2 SAGE Open\nand secrecy encourage stigma, shame, low self-esteem, lone-\nliness, lack of trust in others, difficulty in creating intimate\nrelationships, and a host of other problems (Feder, 2006;\nhave historically attempted to prevent these negative phe-\nnomena, so they have often attempted to normalize the body\nthrough surgery and hormones, tailoring it to one of the two\ntypical sexes/genders: male/female, man/woman.\nThe moment of discovering the secret, that is, their par-\nticular \"intersex\" physical condition and their treatment his-\ntory, was perceived by intersexed people as a significant,\nlife-changing event that not only legitimized their emotions\nboth in the past and in the present but also opened many\nquestions and left them with a great deal of anger and frustra-\ntion toward their doctors and parents, who had concealed\ninformation from them. Studies of the life experience of\nintersexed people, such as those of Sharon Preves (2003),\noften related to the intersexed body as a discursive, medical\nbody, a passive product of biomedical science. Unlike previ-\nous studies, this one aims to demonstrate how the material\nintersexed body, like any other human body, is dynamic, and\nsenses, experiences, and even opposes attempts to normalize\nit in its own unique ways. Moreover, this study describes the\ncomplex relationship between the body and the secret and\nreveals how the secret is experienced as a foreign object that\nthe body cannot tolerate. It also interrogates the ways in\nwhich the secret is established in the body and its effects on\nthe embodied subject, and explores what causes intersexed\npeople to feel alienation from their lives in general and their\nbodies in particular.\nThe existence of the intersexed body and the act of keep-\ning it secret have been linked, in an institutionalized manner,\nthrough the traditional protocol2 outlined by Johns Hopkins\nHospital in the 1950s. At the time, John Money and his col-\nleagues were conducting pioneering clinical and psychologi-\ncal studies on \"hermaphroditism,\"3 and were considered the\nleading authorities on the subject. The Johns Hopkins profes-\nsionals believed that gender role and gender identity (Gender\nR/I) should establish and guide the treatment policy of \"her-\nmaphrodite\" children. According to this perception, the core\nproblem of \"hermaphrodite\" adults was being assigned to the\n\"wrong gender,\" which caused social alienation, stigma, and\npsychopathological problems. Hence, they claimed, her-\nmaphrodite children should be assigned a coherent gender\nrole as early as possible (no later than 18 months of age), and\nraised in accordance with it, while those with ambiguous\nexternal genitalia should undergo surgical correction. Money\nand his associates asserted that normal looking external geni-\ntals are more crucial than chromosomes, gonads, and internal\nand other sexual characteristics for establishing a \"normal\"\ngender role/identity (Money, 1955; Money, Hampson, &\nfocused on diminishing and concealing bodily ambiguity as\nquickly as possible, which would allow \"hermaphrodite\"\nchildren to be socially accepted and unstigmatized. In fact,\nMoney et al. (1955) encouraged doctors to \"talk frankly\"\nwith hermaphrodite children, and claimed that \"truth is sel-\ndom as distressing as the mystery of the unknown\" (p. 294).\nTheoretically, they argued in their article that \"hermaphro-\ndite\" children should not be kept in the dark regarding their\nphysical state, but, unfortunately, we revealed that only four\ndecades later, there is a tremendous gap between their theory\nand the actual realities of intersexed people.\nSince the 1990s, much criticism has been voiced against\nthe \"Money Protocol,\" especially regarding the problematic\nconnection between gender identity and the \"true sex\" of\nintersexed people. For example, Suzanne Kessler claimed\nthat Money and his colleague evaluated penis size (\"a good-\nsized penis\") as the sole condition for raising a newborn as a\nboy. Chromosomes and other physiological characteristics\nwere less relevant than penis size, so babies with penises\nsmaller than the ideal of the medical staff, with hypospadias,\nwith XY46 sex chromosomes and testes were forced to\nundergo \"corrective\" genital surgery and raised as girls\nargued in her pioneering article \"The Five Sexes: Why Male\nand Female Are Not Enough\" that the biomedical profes-\nsionals at Johns Hopkins disciplined intersexed bodies\naccording to stereotypical gender norms, instead of seriously\nand deeply studying the many (at least five) sexes of the\nhuman body. In the summer of 1993, soon after the publica-\ntion of \"The Five Sexes,\" Sheryl Chase, an intersexed activ-\nist, established the Intersex Society of North America\n(ISNA), the first organized group of intersexed activists.\nChase, like most ISNA members, had been treated and oper-\nated on according to the \"Money protocol,\" for 60 years,\nwhich was internationally recognized and followed. ISNA\nbegan to voice its criticism of this protocol on the Internet, in\nthe popular media, and in literature. The writings presented\nin the book Intersex in the Age of Ethics (Dreger, 1999)\nbrought to light the living experience of many intersexed\npeople, revealing that they had grown up unaware of their\nphysical diagnosis and the significance of their physical\u00ad\nsurgical histories, as their physicians and families had lied\nand concealed this information from them, and they had to\ndiscover it on their own. For most of them, this discovery\nwas traumatic. They felt that they had been living a lie for\nyears and were forced to cope alone with the consequences\nboth of the surgeries carried out on their bodies, which\ncaused much physical and emotional damage, including lack\nof genital\u00adsexual sensation, and of the revelation of their\nbodily secret.As more studies were published and an increas-\ning number of intersexed people revealed their stories, the\nsecrets and secrecy surrounding their bodies have become\nknown as a familiar feature of the dominant narrative and an\nintegral element of traditional treatment policy (Chase, 1998,\nMeoded Danon 3\nConference of 2005, organized by the ISNA4 and other inter-\nsex advocates and biomedical professionals, aimed to change\nthe traditional and problematic \"Money Protocol.\" The main\nchanges of the medical treatment concerned clinical and\npathological nomenclature, with the term Disorder of Sex\nDevelopment (DSD) replacing the old terms \"hermaphrodit-\nism\" and \"intersex conditions\" (Lee, Christopher, Faisal, &\nLeuan, 2006). The new guidelines are more centered on\npatients and families. Experts advocate sharing information\non patients' physical condition and treatment with parents,\nand the optimal sex/gender of the newborn is determined by\nmultidisciplinary teams that consider the best interests of\npatients and families. Interestingly, these teams do not\ninclude intersexed subjects who could talk about their expe-\nriences and the consequences of treatment. Other changes\nprimarily involve improved biomedical diagnostic technol-\nogy and better surgical techniques (Ganka et al., 2010).\nNonetheless, the new DSD guidelines are still motivated by\nconcealing bodily ambiguity, especially ambiguous external\ngenitalia, and assigning \"normal\" sex/gender to \"DSD\" chil-\ndren. The bodily autonomy of intersexed children is still in\ngreat doubt under the terms of current treatments.\nFurthermore, the very term DSD, as Davis (2011) claimed,\n\"constructs `sex' as a scientific phenomenon\" in ways that\nmaintain biomedical authority over intersexed bodies.5\nTheorizing Intersexed Bodies and the\nPower of the Secret\n\"Intersexed\" bodies include a broad range of physical states\nthat challenge the significance, components, and develop-\nment of the sexual body. They comprise various configura-\ntions of sex chromosomes and different structures of the\nexternal and internal genitalia. Just as the body cannot be\ndefined as male or female in a separate, stand-alone category,\nand the one always depends on and is compared with the\nother, so it is impossible to define and diagnose the inter-\nsexed body except in comparison and in relation to typical\nfemale or male bodies. Male and female are sexes that were\nestablished in the past continue to be established by the bio-\nsocial establishment and are not disconnected from cultural\nbiases and heteronormative perceptions of sex, gender, and\nsexuality.\nalist discursive view of the human body, established through\npower relations (especially the biopower of human science)\nand the discipline of knowledge, influenced writers such as\nnormative Western discourse on sex and gender categories.\nPoststructuralism critiques the notion that sex categories are\nnatural, claiming that, like other social categories, they are the\nresult of a discourse based on and formed through power rela-\ntions. Biomedical science is not disconnected from social\npower relations and a heteronormative perception of gender,\nso its research, gaze, and perception of the body are all fil-\ntered through language, through a system of meanings that\nmark the body as female-feminine or male-masculine. The\nparadox is that the normative sexual order is imaginary;\nphysical-sexual reality is not organized into two unambigu-\nous sexes. Science, in its attempt to characterize or assess the\nfactors or characteristics of the development of sex in the\nbody, repeatedly encounters \"undesirable\" results in bodies\n(whether those of mice or people) that challenge its\nassumptions.6\nIn contrast to poststructuralism, which perceives the\nhuman body as \"discursive,\" a product of construction and\nsocial power relations, the phenomenological approach to\nthe body, established through the work of Maurice Merleau-\nPonty (1978), relates to the \"subjective\" body, focusing on\ncorporeal, sensory experience. Merleau-Ponty claims that\nour perceptions, consciousness, knowledge, and understand-\ning of the world are manifested through our own bodies,\nwhich are situated in the world as the heart is in the organ-\nism, breathing life into it, carrying it inside itself, and shap-\ning our perception and understanding of the world around us.\nIn other words, our flesh, our material, sensual body con-\nstructs our living experience, our being in this world. A phe-\nnomenological approach allows us to analyze the experience\nof intersexed people through their own feelings, senses, and\nways of adjusting to social norms through their own particu-\nlar bodies.\nA secret, like a human body, is difficult to define and\nframe theoretically. It is elusive and hard to estimate accord-\ning to any measure, because it is multidimensional and mul-\ntihued. The secret depends greatly on the different contexts\nand social interactions within which it exists. Sissela Bok\nnotes that the Latin source of the word secrecy (secretum) is\nsecernere, to separate, to create a kind of boundary between\nthe external, those who do not know the contents of the\nsecret, and the internal, those who conceal it (Bok, 1984).\nThis word actually implies the kind of internal conflict inher-\nent in all secrets. Evan Imber-Black (1998) described differ-\nent types of secrets, including positive ones, which strengthen\ninterpersonal relationships; negative, toxic ones, which poi-\nson relationships, limiting our lives and our ability to make\nclear and effective decisions; and dangerous ones, which\npose immediate physical or emotional danger and can cause\ndamage to others and even lead to suicide (Imber-Black,\n1998). These toxic and dangerous secrets are the ones rele-\nvant to our context of intersexed people, because they poison\nbodily experience and make the existence and experience of\nintersexed people extremely difficult. For Georg Simmel\npositive and essential in social life, and help to protect us\nfrom stigma and keep us from harm while we interact with\nothers. Simmel describes what he calls the dialectic of the\nsecret, in which, for example, the secret creates boundaries\nand increases diversity among people, but, however, entails\n4 SAGE Open\nthe temptation to break down boundaries and blur differ-\nences, especially when it is revealed. On one hand, the secret\nacts as a protective sheath that gives power to those who\nknow it, but on the other, it produces the tension and danger\nassociated with its revelation (Simmel, 1906). Unlike\nSimmel, Bok (1984) claimed that holders of secrets experi-\nence negative tensions and conflicts that are embodied in\neverything they do.\nThe dynamics of power can be destructive, as Mark\nKarpel (1980) explained with regard to family secrets, claim-\ning that holders of secrets have a sort of \"nuclear bomb\" that\nis saved for later use, and the only way to be saved from the\ncruel secret and its destructive repercussions is to reveal it (p.\n296). In a more particular, practical, embodied way, cogni-\ntive researchers such as Julie Lane and Daniel Wegner (1995)\ndescribe the difficulty of keeping a secret, explaining how\nmuch energy and effort we need to expend to manage our\nthoughts, our behavior, and especially our body language\nwhen keeping a secret. Paradoxically, the more we try to\nconceal it, the more we reveal the existence of the secret,\nbecause techniques for discovering secrets improve over\ntime and constantly threaten the shell of secrecy, and also\nbecause our own bodies struggle with the secret. To theorize\nthe relationship between intersexed bodies and the power of\nthe secret, I embrace both the poststructuralist and the phe-\nnomenological approaches to the body and demonstrate the\ntension that exists between them. While these two approaches\ndiffer from one another, combining them provides a theoreti-\ncal perspective that focuses on the phenomenology of social\npower that describes how the subjective body experiences\nthe power exerted upon it through the agents of social power\nin general and the power of the secret in particular. This\napproach corresponds with that of Chris Shilling (2005),\nwho coined the term \"corporeal realism\" to describe both the\nconnection between body and society and the distinction\nbetween them. Shilling's approach ignores neither the estab-\nlished social forces, their influence on the experience of the\nbody, nor the body's unique power, development, and mate-\nrial traits. Therefore, this article adopts Shilling's perspec-\ntive, and both offer an analysis of the power relations that\ndiscipline the body, in our case the intersexed body, and con-\nsider the particular bodily experience of individuals and their\nreactions to social power relations.\nMethod and Secrecy\nThis article is part of a comprehensive study conducted in\ntreatment of intersexed people and the life experience of\nintersexed adults. It included 22 semistructured interviews\nwith biomedical and other professionals in Israel. The most\ndifficult task was to reach intersexed people. Fortunately, a\nsupport group for intersexed people began to operate at the\nsame time that I started my research). One of the endocri-\nnologists gave me their brochure and suggested I speak with\nthe moderator of this group, who had been born intersexed\nand would be happy to help. It took me 3 years to find other\nintersexed people for my study. After publishing calls for\nparticipants on various Internet sites and forums, in particu-\nlar endocrinology, parenting, and fertility forums, I eventu-\nally made contact with 11 intersexed adults and 7 parents of\nintersexed children and adults. All of the names of the par-\nticipants have been changed to maintain their anonymity, and\neach of the participants signed a consent form, which\ndescribed the purpose of the research, their right to stop and\nleave the study at any time, their right to secrecy and ano-\nnymity, and my contact information, including phone num-\nber and email address.All the participants chose the locations\nand times of their interviews, to ensure a relaxed and pleas-\nant atmosphere. With seven of the intersexed adults, I con-\nducted follow-up interviews to learn more about the changes\nin their lives and to examine many aspects and themes that\nwere absent in the first interview. During the study, I realized\nthat the secret and secrecy were integral parts of the treat-\nment policy and the life experience of intersexed people, so I\nplayed a role in keeping their secrets. I had to build their trust\nin me and provide a comfortable and safe space in which\nthey could expose their lives to me. To foster their trust, dur-\ning the interviews I informed all the participants about the\nvarious stages of the study, its purpose, and what I had\nlearned so far.\nDuring the research process, as I conducted the interviews\nand analyzed my findings, I used the stages and ideas of\nGrounded theory makes it possible to focus on the dynamics\nand changes of the research field, and data from the field\nform the core of the theory. The processes of sampling and\nfinding participants were actually part of the fundamental\ntheme of this research. Only after several interviews with\nintersexed people did I understand that the reason for the\ngreat difficulty involved in finding intersexed people in\nIsrael was the forceful social agent of the secret. In contrast\nto the public activism of intersex support groups in North\nAmerica, the United Kingdom, Germany, and other coun-\ntries, in Israel this group and intersexuality in general are\nshrouded in secrecy. There are few participants, not because\nof the number of intersexed people in Israel, but because the\nsecret surrounding intersexed bodies is reproduced and man-\nifested beyond hospital walls, assimilated into and practiced\nin everyday social interaction. There are very few (closed)\ngroup meetings during the year, and there is no critical activ-\nity that challenges the biomedical discourse. As in other\nWestern countries, the biomedical system in Israel is authori-\ntative and asserts its power over intersexed people.\nThe term I coined to describe the whole treatment process\nof intersexed people is \"the min-guf process\" (Meoded\nDanon, 2012). Min in Hebrew means sex, kind, or type. Guf\nmeans body. My term, min-guf, implies both the separation\n(the human body is more than the sum of its sexual organs)\nand the connection (intersexed bodies treated by the medical\nMeoded Danon 5\nestablishment as unfixed sexual bodies) between sex and\nbody. In English, it could be understood as \"the sexing pro-\ncess\" or the sexual transformation of the body. I chose this\nterm to focus on the sex category and its various manifesta-\ntions in the human body and on the bodily consequences of\nmedical treatment. Rather than considering the gender cate-\ngory as the main frame for normalizing and disciplining\nintersexed people, I claim that sex and gender categories,\nmuch like the body and society (sex\u00adbody/gender\u00adsociety),\nare intimately integrated and historically manifested in one\nanother; that there is no actual, clear line between them.7 The\nstages of the min-guf process that intersexed people undergo\nthroughout their lives embody the blurring of the boundaries\nbetween sex/gender and body/society. These stages include\ndiagnosing the sexual characteristics of the body, shaping the\nbody according to one of two typical sexes (female or male),\nand performing clinical follow-up of the development of the\nbody according to its new conditions. The secret is an insepa-\nrable part of the min-guf process, as I will describe in the\nfollowing three case studies of intersexed adults. Each of\nthese stories presents a unique example of the problematic\nand paradoxical living experience engendered by the min-guf\nprocess, which aims to conceal intersexed bodies. Despite\nthe fact that the experiences described in these stories took\nplace decades ago, and biomedical technology in many\ncountries, including Israel, has changed considerably in the\nmeantime, the secrets and secrecy surrounding intersexed\nbodies still have not changed and continue to exist alongside\nurgent physical intervention at a very early age.\nThrough the stories of the intersexed subjects of this\nstudy, I will explore the ways in which the secret is estab-\nlished in the body and examine the dynamics of the secret in\neach particular, embodied subject's life. It is important to\nemphasize that these stories are not intended to reflect the\nlife experience of all intersexed people; on the contrary, they\naim to expose the subjective embodied experience of indi-\nvidual subjects to emphasize the particular struggles with the\nsocial forces that act on each body. Bodily particularity\ninforms us, casting doubt on the existence of any universal or\nunisexual physicality.\nShai: \"A Hospital Child\" (August 22,\nShai was born in Israel in 1955. Despite his age, his body\nlooks like that of a young boy. Large green eyes illuminate\nhis face, his hands and feet are small, and he is short. At the\nbeginning of our meeting, Shai showed me a 1958 medical\ndocument that described his physical diagnosis and the deci-\nsions his doctors made about his body. This is the only medi-\ncal document Shai has obtained from his own medical file.\nShai does not know about everything that happened to his\nbody during his childhood and is interested in reading his\nmedical file, but the hospital where he was treated is conceal-\ning his records, despite his legal right to see them and his\nattempts to obtain them. Before I introduce the contents of\nthe document, let us connect to Shai's experience of child-\nhood and adolescence:\nI always felt unusual, different, let's say, from infancy, but I\ndidn't understand why. I looked like a girl. . . . I was in the\nhospital all the time, sometimes for long periods, which\nautomatically makes you feel different. . . . To the outside world\nI showed that I was a boy in an extreme way, being the epitome\nof what a bad boy was and pushing this to the limit, because I\nfelt different. . . . For example, from a very young age I felt\nattracted to boys, but I realized that it was forbidden, that you\nwere not allowed to talk about it and no one should know. I used\nto play secretly with dolls. I loved playing with dolls.\nSocial responses to Shai's appearance sometimes led peo-\nple to mistake him for a girl and treat him like one, which\ncaused him frustration, pain, and a counterreaction that man-\nifested itself in a radicalization of his \"boy\" behavior. Thus,\nhis behavior toward the world was extreme, extroverted, and\ninterpreted by him and those around him as \"boyish,\" in con-\ntrast to his behavior in his own world, without peer pressure,\nwhere he could express his feelings and desires. His physical\nappearance as a boy\u00adgirl caused a contradiction, a dialectic\nbetween his inner world and the outside world, as he explains,\nYou have to understand that all my life I've simply been acting,\nand I'm a very, very honest person, so it always bothered me that\nI had to act. . . . Outside, I looked different. Even today, when\neveryone knows me, they call me \"Shai, a man with balls.\" In\npoint of fact, I have no balls at all [laughs], \"Shai with the ostrich\neggs\" everyone calls me.\nShai was unaware of the cause of the hospitalizations and\nhis physical characteristics, but he understood his body as\n\"sick.\" The third important issue in the context of Shai's\nsense of difference is his sexuality and attraction to boys,\nwhich was perceived as forbidden in his social environment\nand never spoken of. Thus, Shai learned to conceal his sexu-\nality and keep it secret.\nSecondary sex characteristics, the growth of the penis and\npubic hair, appeared in Shai's body at a very young age (5-6),\nand he was ashamed of them. His communication with his\nparents was minimal, and he did not ask questions about his\nphysical condition or share with them the physical changes\nhe was undergoing. This surprised me because parents are\nusually aware of physical changes in their children's bodies,\nbut Shai claims that he learned to be independent at a young\nage, to shower alone, and take care of his own needs.\nDuring his childhood hospitalizations, he felt that his\nbody was perceived by doctors as something rare, but he was\nnot sure why:\nYou're a little kid and all day they strip you and dress you and\nlook at you; that's how it was. I understood that mine was a rare,\nspecial case, so they all wanted to see, they all wanted to touch,\nthat's how it was. Just like an exhibit in a museum.\n6 SAGE Open\nDespite Shai's otherwise excellent memory, his recollec-\ntion of the years when he was hospitalized has been erased.\nDuring these years, a number of surgeries were performed on\nhis body, including one to remove his uterus, ovaries, and\nfallopian tubes.\nBy the time he was 13, Shai's body had developed in\naccordance with its material terms (due to increased andro-\ngen secretion, he underwent puberty very early, but from age\n13, he stopped growing and remained quite short). Each\nmonth, Shai would arrive at the hospital for monitoring. He\ndescribes how the doctor treated him like an object, without\nasking how he felt. He would ask him to strip and check the\nlength of his bones, limbs, and penis. For some reason, even\nwhen it was obvious that his bones were not growing, the\ndoctor ignored this fact.\nAt 17, Shai received his first draft notice for compulsory\nmilitary service and underwent a physical examination,\nincluding an examination of his scrotum. During the exami-\nnation, it became clear to Shai, through the body language of\nthe doctors as they looked at one another, that something was\namiss with his genitalia. They said nothing to him. He\ndressed and went home. One month later, he received a letter\nstating that he was exempt from military service (on grounds\nof being \"permanently unsuitable\"). He attempted to appeal\nthe decision and asked to volunteer, in any capacity, \"just to\nwear a uniform,\" but without success. In retrospect, Shai\nsays that he understands why the military doctors never told\nhim anything, as this would have been an extremely difficult\ntask and a great responsibility to assume, considering that the\ndoctors who treated him during his childhood had not told\nhim anything. So the military doctors maintained his civilian\ndoctors' rules of secrecy.\nTwo years later, Shai was surprised to receive a draft\nnotice for 3 years' service. He now refused to join both\nbecause the army had rejected him in the past and because he\nhad continued with his life and now had a job and plans for\nthe future, so he appealed the recruitment and was subse-\nquently summoned to a meeting of the Medical Committee.\nBefore the meeting, he unexpectedly received a large pack-\nage containing all his medical documents. This is how Shai\ndescribes his experience of discovering the secret:\nIt said \"female pseudohermaphrodite,\"8 but one sentence deeply\nshocked me. I'll remember it to my dying day. . . . It said they\nwere making me into a boy because my parents were primitive\nMoroccans. . . . I remember that I went to the committee and like\nan idiot gave them all the documents. . . . I understood why I felt\ndifferent and what was different and what was wrong with me. .\n. . I didn't want to talk about it, I was ashamed. . . . I buried it in\nsome corner of my body and covered it with stones and didn't\nwant to talk about it.\nAmong all the medical documents in the package was the\ndocument Shai presented to me early in our meeting. It includes\na description of the min-guf process that Shai underwent during\nhis childhood, and reflects both the medical\u00adtechnological\nconditions in Israel at the time and the biosocial perceptions\nof Shai's physicians. The document notes the following:\nEmpty right scrotum. On the left side a small mass can be felt,\nlarge penis, uterus, ovaries are present. In conclusion, the child\nis genetically female, gonadal sex female with completely male\nexternal genitals, the penis is large, urethral tube inside the\npenis, a well-structured but empty scrotum. Regarding the\nchild's future, of course he will have to live as a male, and this is\ndue to the following: the external genitalia are completely male.\nConstructing a proper vagina to allow a normal sex life as a\nfemale is a complicated and difficult thing, and the results are\ndoubtful. The condition of the ovaries cannot be determined\nwith certainty. Will there be fertility? If he continues to live as a\nmale it would be possible to stop administering cortisol.\nIncreased androgenization will ensure the development of\nmenstrual periods. In the meantime, we will not perform any\nsurgery, and if there is a need, we will perform the following\nrequired surgeries: partial or complete hysterectomy and\nremoval of the ovaries. We see no justification for shocking\n[words deleted from the document] the parents and telling them\nabout our findings. We released the child with a recommendation\nto administer 25 mg of cortisone and instructed the parents to\nbring him back for a follow-up visit in 10 days.\nShai's physical characteristics are described here in a way\nthat presents different kinds of sex: genetic sex, gonadal sex,\nand external sex. His multisexual body shocked the doctors,\nso they could not justify telling his parents about his physical\ncharacteristics. The medical document suggests that the doc-\ntors were being considerate of the parents and preventing\nthem from being shocked, but in the document that Shai read\nand is now unable to obtain the doctor wrote that his parents\nwere \"primitive Moroccans,\" so the reason for concealing\nthe information from them was the prejudiced perception of\nhis doctors, who assumed that because of their ethnicity, his\nparents would not be able to understand and cope with Shai's\nphysical condition. Keeping Shai's intersexed body a secret\ncaused his physicians to perform the min-guf process on him\nwithout sharing it with his parents and without their permis-\nsion. Shai became a \"hospital child,\" a child who belonged to\nthe world of those who treated him and its perceptions.\nShai was born with classical congenital adrenal hyperpla-\nsia (CCAH), which involves a lack of salt in the body and\nhormonal imbalances that result from an increased secretion\nof androgens. Shai's doctors sexed his body as masculine,\nthe reason for this decision being the appearance of his penis,\nin particular its size. Shai's uterus and ovaries were removed,\nsilicone testicles were implanted in his body, and cortisone\nwas administered to balance his hormones.\nIn a conversation I had with Prof. B., one of Shai's doc-\ntors, he related the following9:\nI remember a patient who came from Pediatric Surgery at age\ntwo and a half. In a general exam, the doctor said his penis was\nlarge. The person who conducted the Barr body test [used for\ndetecting the X chromosome] said, \"You know, it's female.\nMeoded Danon 7\nWhat shall we do with him now? Cut him? He has a functioning\nuterus, ovaries. If he's treated with cortisone he'll reach sexual\nmaturity and then what? The ovaries will wake up, estrogens\nwill make breasts, and then there will be menstruation, he'll\n`urinate'blood. It has to drain into something. It will accumulate\nin the uterus. What can we do to remedy the problem?\" So if you\ndecide to raise the child as a male, you remove the uterus. . . . We\ntold the parents there was an \"incompatibility.\" [long silence] At\nthe age of two and half, the child was already big--there was no\nchoice. I believe we made the right decision. Here you have to\ndecide whether to amputate this penis. I remember my boss said,\n\"You don't amputate a penis like this!\"\nThe doctor's words indicate that treatment practices in\nShai's case--that is, the process of sexing him as mascu-\nline--were carried out because of his large penis. This is in\nline with the Johns Hopkins University approach of the time,\nthe phallocentric approach, according to Kessler (1998),\nwhich related to penis size. However, there is ambiguity\nregarding the process of the medical monitoring of Shai's\nbody, the ramifications of the surgery for his body, and what\nall the doctors did when they noticed during follow-up that\nShai's bones had stopped growing, his body had stayed the\nsame size, and his \"large penis\" was now relatively small, as\nhe stopped growing at age 13. Shai is angry at his doctors,\nwho prevented his body from growing and did not prescribe\nhormone replacement therapy for him. He realizes in retro-\nspect that the reason for this was to keep the secret from him:\nIn order not to reveal the truth, [the doctor] would not give me\nhormones so I wouldn't ask questions. . . . If you decide to make\nme a boy, let me look like a boy! For G-d's sake, give me the\nhormones on time! Everyone in our family is tall, so if you see .\n. . that I have stopped growing, give me [the hormones], help me\ngrow. . . . So, you see that all the signs show that he simply did\nnot want this secret to be revealed.\nAt the age of 22, when Shai discovered the secret, he con-\ncealed it from his friends and family, maintaining the rules of\nsecrecy and hoping that it would disappear. He did not share\nthe discovery with his parents and was especially angry at his\nfather because he thought that he (who had accompanied him\nto the hospital during his childhood) had known about every-\nthing and been involved in the doctors' decision making.\nOnly in 1997, years after his father's death, when Shai was\nable to read all the medical documents, did he realize that his\nparents actually had not been informed.\nShai decided to tell Dr. H., the new endocrinologist who\nreplaced the doctor who had treated him throughout his child-\nhood, that he knew what had happened to him and that it both-\nered him that people mistook him for a girl. Dr. H. never\nspoke to Shai about his physical history, but he was kind to\nhim, explains Shai, and prescribed testosterone, which Shai\nhas taken ever since. He describes the changes in his body:\nI started shaving, which made me very happy. [smiles] I also\ngrew a beard. For years I had a beard to show that I was male\nand not female. . . . I had a somewhat feminine voice, but\nrelatively low. The hormones made my voice much lower.\nToday, Shai undergoes hormonal monitoring in the adult\nendocrinology department, with a kind new endocrinologist\nof whom he is very fond. She arranged for Shai to have sur-\ngery to replace the small silicone testicles implanted when he\nwas a child with larger ones.\nAs Shai began to deal with the secret of his life and learn\nabout his medical past, he became severely depressed and\nrequired psychological and psychiatric treatment. The more\nhe investigated, the more new things he discovered, includ-\ning flashes of negative experiences from the hospital and\nphysical and emotional abuse by his doctors. Shai's coping\nalone with the discovery of the secret, while he continued to\nhide it from others, threatened his life to the point where he\nconsidered suicide, but he decided not to bury his secret with\nhim. Several years ago, he began to suffer extreme pain in his\nlower abdomen and underwent a series of tests that revealed\nthe stump of a uterus in his body, a kind of historical, mate-\nrial remnant through which the body signaled, in its own\nway, the physical secret it held inside.\nThe bodily secret, that is, the social, material product of\nthe min-guf process, caused Shai to live in a world divided\nbetween the external and the internal. These divisions, the\nsame separation that produces the secret, as Bok (1984)\nclaimed, are experienced by the body. The differences\nbetween his internal and external worlds caused Shai to learn\nto become an excellent actor, especially in highlighting his\nso-called \"masculine\" features in his social environment as\nopposed to his \"feminine\" features in private. Shai was seen\nby his friends as a \"man with balls,\" a kind of \"bad boy\" who\nacted violently and stood out. My intention in pointing out\nthis behavior is not to distinguish between \"masculine\" and\n\"feminine\" features and to perceive them as given, or to\nreproduce gender stereotypes, but rather to show how Shai\ndistinguishes between these two worlds and to demonstrate\nhow this separation establishes embodied negative emotions,\nfrustration, and loneliness. Here, the body itself undermined\nthe concealment of the secret, especially in the external\n\"boy\u00adgirl,\" appearance that caused people to mistake Shai\nfor a girl. The more people mistook him for a girl, the more\nextreme were his reactions--\"bad boy\" behavior and chang-\ning his appearance as an adult, growing a beard, and having\nlarger silicon testicles implanted. However, the concealment\ngame is exhausting and frustrating. For Shai, the hormones\nare \"a sham,\" not a part of him. He says that he would like to\nrest from his frustrating struggle with the bodily secret and\nsocial conservatism.\nShai's min-guf process established a bodily secret that\ntransformed his body and poisoned its being. The treatment\npolicy, together with the bodily secret, led to Shai's body being\nneither female nor male, but rather a different kind of body, a\nbody without internal sex organs, with a small penis and sili-\ncone testicles, a body that depends on synthetic hormones.\n8 SAGE Open\nShai physically experiences resistance to the bodily secret in\nvarious ways. For example, the body remembers its missing\norgans, as evidenced by the experience of physical pain that\ncaused Shai to discover the stump of the uterus in his body.\nIn addition, Shai has always experienced the bodily secret in\nhis own unusual nature and difference, through his frequent\nhospitalizations and through the way in which his doctors\nlooked at his body as though it were an object in a museum.\nThus, even when he was unaware of the contents of the\nsecret, it was palpable and real in his life, like a foreign body.\nRonnie: \"I Once Had Testicles\" Is\nSimilar to \"I Have Testicles\" (October\nRonnie's story is very different from Shai's; they grew up in\ndifferent environments, at different socioeconomic levels,\nwith different cultural values and different intersex condi-\ntions. Yet, a similarity exists between them in terms of their\nembodiment and their bodily experience, which are closely\nlinked to the secrets that surround their bodies. The course of\nRonnie's life intersects with that of her sister, who is 4 years\nolder. Both were born with Complete Androgen Insensitivity\nSyndrome (CAIS).10 Although her sister did not participate\nin the current study, her presence was felt in Ronnie's story,\nbecause she experienced the min-guf process and the estab-\nlishment of the bodily secret first, and Ronnie later went\nthrough the same process. This is how Ronnie began her life\nnarrative:\nI was twelve, and my older sister was sixteen and hadn't gotten\nher period, and my parents took her to all kinds of tests because\nof this matter. Later, they also took me for tests. Everything she\nwent through, I went through, and they didn't explain why and I\ndidn't ask too many questions. . . . They told me I had been born\nwithout a uterus and couldn't have children and I wouldn't\nmenstruate. They even took the trouble to tell me that studies\nprove that the girls who have this syndrome are pretty, tall, and\nnot hairy. I remember that I didn't believe them and thought it\nwas nice of them to tell me this, but it was clear they had done it\nto be kind, to make me feel good after the blow they had just\ndealt me.\nWhen Ronnie describes the \"matter,\" and what she calls\n\"this syndrome,\" there is a sense of alienation, a certain dis-\ntance--alienation that I feel as a listener and alienation and\ndistance experienced by Ronnie. The common perception is\nthat androgen insensitivity syndrome produces \"beauty\"--\ngirls who are pretty, tall, and not hairy. This is how doctors\npresent the characteristics of this physical condition to par-\nents. This myth of \"beauty\" is also reflected in popular litera-\nture, for example, in the novel Middlesex by Jeffrey\nEugenides (2002) and in the media (in one of the episodes of\nthe television series House).\nRonnie cannot describe in words what she felt after her\nparents told her she would not menstruate or bear children.\nShe felt terrible and cried all night. Until that evening, she\nhad expected to menstruate--Menstruation was something\neveryone was talking about as teenagers. Later, Ronnie lied\nto her friends said she had gotten her period. She bought\nsanitary pads and kept them in a cupboard. When her mother\nsaw them she asked Ronnie why she had them, Ronnie was\nembarrassed and explained that if a friend needed a pad, she\nwould have one. Ronnie lied to decrease the social pressure\naround her, thus participating in the establishment of the\nbodily secret.\nRonnie began to undergo examinations by the gynecolo-\ngist who treated her older sister with no explanation about\nthe nature of the tests or the reason for them. She underwent\nthe examinations as part of her routine, asking no questions.\nAfter examining her, the gynecologist told her mother that\nRonnie could have normal sex--that is, heterosexual sex--\nbecause she had a vagina. In some cases of CAIS, the vagina\nis narrow and doctors recommend expanding it with\nRonnie and her sister each experienced the min-guf pro-\ncess alone. Ronnie's sister underwent surgery at this time to\nremove her testes. This process was not shared with Ronnie.\nWhen Ronnie began to mature, the physical examinations\nwere geared toward surgery to remove her gonads. This is\nhow she describes the experience:\nIn the summer between eighth and ninth grade, I had surgery.\nMy mother told me to say that it was hernia surgery, and that's\nwhat I said. . . . I was told that they were removing my residual\novaries, so I wouldn't get cancer or something. I didn't know it\nwas something else. . . . I have scars on my lower abdomen\n[from the surgery].\nRonnie's parents lied, concealing the real reason for her\nsurgery; instead of telling her that testicles were being\nremoved, they told her that residual ovaries were being\nremoved to prevent them from becoming cancerous. Ronnie\ntold her friends that she had hernia surgery, as her mother\nasked her to. The scars from her surgery remain on her lower\nabdomen, a sign that her body remembers what happened to\nit, a mark of its physical history. Following surgery, Ronnie\nbegan to take synthetic hormones. In this way, through medi-\ncal treatment and her parents' cooperation with it, the secret\nwas established in Ronnie's body.\nOne day her sister sent her an email with a link to the\nAndrogene Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) group in England.\nRonnie kept the email in a folder and did not open it. When I\nasked her why, she replied,\nWhen I saw that in the initials \"AIS\" the first word was androgen,\nmy only familiarity with that word was that it had to do with\nsomeone whose biology and gender are undefined, something\nbetween a man and a woman, and it was very frightening to me.\n. . . I put it in a folder and forgot about it. After about two years\n. . . I told my friend, a doctor. . . . I told her what I tell everyone,\nand then she asked me, \"So when did have your testicles\nMeoded Danon 9\nremoved?\" and I felt like I'd been punched in the stomach, just\nashamed that I didn't know. So I told her at age fourteen, as if I\nsuddenly had made all the connections to the surgery I had had\nthen. Then she left, and I went to the website that my sister had\nsent me . . . and only then did everything become clear to me.\nRonnie experienced the moment of the secret's revelation\nin her body as a punch in the stomach, a feeling directly con-\nnected to her abdominal surgery, which the body remembers\nthrough a scar. Ronnie immediately made the connection\nbetween her surgery at 14 and the removal of her testes. The\nsecret, now revealed, that her body had contained testes, and\nnot damaged ovaries, frightened and deeply troubled Ronnie,\nbecause the organ she most associated with masculinity had\nbeen part of her body. She explains,\nThe subject of the testicles was the most problematic for me then\nand has been ever since. I didn't tell my boyfriend about the\ntestes, but only that I don't have a uterus, and he took it with\nindifference. I don't want to tell him about the testicles, because\nI think this would have been a sexual turn-off for him.\nAfter uncovering the secret, Ronnie began to explore her\nphysical condition; she read studies and wrote an academic\npaper on the different forms of AIS, which she gave to her\nsister and parents to read. Ronnie also recognizes the bene-\nfits of her physical condition, such as being tall and not being\nhairy. Ronnie expresses her discomfort with the term\n\"intersex\":\nI don't think of myself as intersex. . . . I don't have any problem\nwith my sex. I also think it has to do with the form of the\nsyndrome that one has. The physical appearance of those with\ncomplete AIS is that of a woman and it's different from other\nsyndromes, where there are elements of both sexes. . . . Despite\nmy condition, it's clear to me that I'm a woman; my sex was\nconfused, but my gender was not. I will elaborate. Yes, I had\nproblems when I was younger. I was flat-chested and had short\nhair, so people would mistake me for a boy and I was very\ninsulted. My hands are not feminine either, but I cannot imagine\nliving life as a man.\nRonnie's \"physical reality\" is dialectical, expressed in the\ntension between her internal corporeality and the external\ncorporeality resulting from her \"syndrome.\" The dialectic is\nbetween her internal \"masculinity\" (testes, XY46 sex chro-\nmosomes) and phenotypical femaleness (female external\ngenitalia). On one hand, Ronnie says that her corporeality,\nher outer appearance as a woman with CAIS, is that of a\nwoman, unlike what outer appearance may be in other physi-\ncal conditions of intersexuality. On the other hand, she says\nthat her physicality as a child made people mistakenly think\nshe was a boy, and that she had been offended by this.\nSimilarly, she adds that her \"sex\" is confused, but her \"gen-\nder\" is stable, clear, and decidedly feminine. When I asked\nRonnie to describe what it means to her to \"feel like a\nwoman,\" she responded that she had no idea, but that she still\nknew she was a woman and not a man in the existing social\u00ad\ngender dichotomy.\nRonnie, like Shai, experienced the physical dialectic. This\ntook place during the surrogacy process, 3 years after our first\ninterview. Ronnie told me that she had married her partner and\nthey had begun the surrogacy process, during which she was\nrequired to undergo general medical examinations and provide\nmedical documentation confirming her inability to conceive:\nWhen I do an ultrasound there is something comfortable in the\ndoctor just writing \"uterus and ovaries not detected\" and not\n\"but testicles were detected\" . . . because there is still a\ndissonance between the self-concept, the gender I chose, and the\nfact that I once had testicles. It's a dissonance that needs to be\ndealt with, and this solves the problem of the need to deal with\nit. It doesn't completely solve it because, bottom line, \"I once\nhad\" is similar to \"I have,\" but it still allows me to deal with it\nand explain myself to myself and not explain it to the ultrasound\ntechnician, let's say.\nRonnie's bodily secret continues to exist, even when there\nare no testicles in her body. Ronnie says that she deals with\nthe secret by keeping it to herself. Thus, she maintains the\ndissonance--the bodily dialectic. In retrospect, Ronnie\nexplains that the secret has affected her life, her social abili-\nties, her interpersonal relations, and her trust in others.\nThe min-guf process that Ronnie underwent created a\nphysical secret that, in turn, produced a dialectic in her life\nbetween her body and her gender. The bodily secret here is\nactually a family secret, shared by her older sister, their par-\nents, and their doctors. The secret no longer depends on the\nmaterial physical characteristics of the intersexed body; even\nafter Ronnie's testes were removed, she experienced the ten-\nsion produced by the bodily secret. The removal of the testes\ndid not produce a blurring or disappearance of intersexed\ncorporeality, but rather strengthened it and preserved it as a\nbodily secret. The body is the secret, but at the same time it\nalso undermines the secret. The feeling that Ronnie describes,\nthe self-dissonance, threatens to reveal the secret. In other\nwords, on one hand, the physical secret, concealing the inter-\nsexed physicality, protects Ronnie from the threat and the\nresponse to the disturbing physicality associated with mascu-\nlinity. But, on the other hand, the body cannot conceal the\nsecret, and leaves the physical scars of the min-guf process.\nThere are also emotional scars that are experienced physi-\ncally, for example, the sense that the testicles exist even in\ntheir absence. The secret provides power, presence, and exis-\ntence to the particular intersexual corporeality.\nOr: \"I Was Hooked Up to a\nOr, 28, is an academic. She is interested in researching the\ngenetics of her physical condition--congenital adrenal\nhyperplasia (CAH). Or is active in the CAH community on a\nwell-known Internet site and often provides biomedical\ninformation to parents of intersexed children and to inter-\nsexed people with CAH. She begins with the story of her\nbirth:\nI was born prematurely, in the eighth month, and it was a breech\nbirth. I've always been kind of contrary. They noticed something\nstrange and my mother told me that there was a doctor who . . .\nrecognized the syndrome. Actually I was, I am, a classically\ndifficult case. The term is CAH due to 21OH deficiencies, which\nmeans CAH due to damage to enzyme 21 accompanied by the\nloss of salts. I have all the problems. Aside from that, he\nrecognized that I did not look normal and so they monitored me\nclosely, so I did not become dehydrated.\nImmediately after birth, Or underwent a series of tests to\nmonitor levels of hormones and salts in her body. Her exter-\nnal genitals included an \"enlarged clitoris\" and closed labia,\nand this situation brought about the initiation of the min-guf\nprocess and diagnostic tests to determine her physical condi-\ntion. She and her parents were referred to the best hospital\navailable at the time--Johns Hopkins University, which spe-\ncialized in these surgeries. She recalls,\nBy age 5, I actually already realized that I was different. I didn't\ngo to change clothes in the locker room at the pool. At five I\nunderwent the first surgery. And then they arranged the external\nform [of my genitals], arranged what needed to be arranged.\nOr reveals here that at an early age, she had become aware\nof the physical differences reflected in the appearance of her\nexternal genitals. She describes the difference she sensed at a\nvery young age when she saw that the women in the locker\nroom did not have the same organ as she did. Or explains\nhow she experienced her difference: \"From the day I first\nknew who I was, I knew somehow that I was not normal. To\nhave surgery at age five pretty much establishes this fact.\"\nOr's statement attests to the fact that genital surgeries\nthemselves increase the sense of difference in intersexed\nchildren and do not facilitate their adaptation or sense of\nsocial belonging, as biomedical experts claim. Or does not\nremember many details of the meeting with the psychologist\nat the clinic before her surgery, but she recalls that her mother\ntalked with the psychologist, and she mainly played with\ntoys she defines as \"boys'toys\"--tractors and trucks. During\nher childhood, Or remembers, she had to take medications,\nwhich increased her sense of difference and alienation\nregarding her corporeality.\nAt 12, Or underwent a second operation to continue the\nconstruction of her external genitals. While the first surgery\nconstructed the outer labia, corrected the urethra, and reduced\nthe size of the clitoris, the second was aimed at constructing\na vagina and allowing the passage of menstrual fluid from\nthe cervix. Or reports her recollection of learning from her\nmother about the second surgery: \"I remember she explained\nthat I had to have surgery so I could lead a normal life. I\nremember I asked why they hadn't removed my uterus dur-\ning the first operation.\"\nOr was aware of her corporeality early on. Her response\nto her mother's news about the impending surgery can be\nseen as an attempt to resist ordinary life, a uterus, fertility,\nthe kind of life her mother wishes for her. Or traveled to the\nUnited States with her mother to undergo the second opera-\ntion. She does not remember pain, but recalls that she recov-\nered quickly and was released early. After surgery, she had to\npreserve the vagina in her body and to use different expand-\ners to widen it. As this was very painful for Or and for her\nmother, who tried to help her, in time they stopped. After the\nsecond surgery, Or increasingly shut out her friends. When I\nasked her why she thinks she isolated herself, she replied,\nThe main reason, I think, is that when I was born the doctors\nadvised my parents not to tell. They told the grandparents, aunts\nand uncles, and that was it. I mean, they knew what I had, but it\ndidn't come up. . . . The parents didn't tell. You understand, they\ndidn't talk about it. My siblings don't know.\nAt age 17, Or had a third operation and later an additional\none to open and expand the vagina, which her body had\nclosed over time. The purpose of the operations was to\nencourage her sexuality, especially the act of penetration. Or\nclaims that, although she is not in a relationship and does not\nwant to be in one, she still preserves the opening of the\nvagina because it is threatening to close again.\nOr's min-guf process and the establishment of her physi-\ncal secret caused her alienation and self-hatred. She does not\nlike to be photographed or to see herself in pictures, and is\nrevolted by psychologists. Her sense of alienation is increased\nand reproduced both by the expansion of her vagina and the\noperations she underwent and through her bodily secret,\nwhich is not spoken of. This is a kind of vicious circle--a\nbodily secret that is not mentioned, but which controls her\nlife and threatens its existence.\nOr attempted to escape this vicious circle. When she was\ndrafted into the army at age 18, she decided to stop taking the\ndexamethasone (a type of cortisone) she had taken all her\nlife. Or decided to get, as she says, \"off the respirator\" to\nwhich she had been attached since birth, which meant break-\ning free from her bodily secret. When her doctor called her in\nfor a blood test, Or told her that she had stopped taking the\npills. The doctor informed her parents at once, and they\nasked her to resume taking the medication. Thus, the doctor\nviolated medical confidentiality, and Or claims that if she\nhad filed a complaint, the doctor would have lost her license.\nBut she did not file a complaint. The physical effects of stop-\nping her medication included fatigue, depression, and facial\nhair growth.\nOr and her parents conceal the secret from her siblings,\nand thus the physical secret becomes a family secret that cre-\nates a boundary between those who share it and those who do\nnot within the family system. The secret sabotages family\nrelationships and communication between family members.\nThe relationship between Or and her siblings and her parents\nis cool and distant.\nWhen I asked Or about love and intimate relationships in\nher life, she explained that she has never experienced love\nthat it is impossible for her:\nHow can I tell someone I was born different, that what you see\nnow is the result of a successful plastic surgeon, more or less? I\nhave no idea what I look like compared to someone normal. I\nwould argue that the work they did wasn't one hundred percent\nperfect, that I'm quite different. I don't know, I mean they forgot\nto tattoo an orientation map on my genitals [laughs].\nOr asks how she can develop a relationship with another\nperson when she is unable to accept herself. She has a great\ndeal of anger that erupts dramatically when someone annoys\nher. Or's anger is directed at herself, and she often sinks into\ndepression and talks to no one.\nOr's most dominant conflict is the struggle between the\nbody and the secret. Throughout her life, the secret was\nestablished in her body with the aim of concealing the body\nand its physical history. It thus undermines and suppresses\nthe particular experience of the body, its appearance, its\nbeing in the world, and particularly its interaction with its\nenvironment and with others. Throughout her life, Or learned\nthat her body was a secret, something different, and therefore\neveryone was concealing it. The medications she takes, the\nsurgeries she has undergone, and keeping the secret all reaf-\nfirm and intensify her difficult feelings. The bodily secret\npoisons her existence and causes conflicts and alienation\nfrom herself and others.\nConclusion\nThe min-guf process of intersexed people, the surgical, hor-\nmonal practices, the deliberate concealment of the intersexed\nbody, and the attempt to make it \"disappear\" all establish a\nbodily secret. The secret is embodied as an organic feature\nthrough treatment practices. Over time, it becomes a foreign\nobject that undermines the body's orientation and existence.\nThe bodily secret is a force that surrounds the body and pro-\nduces stress, frustration, and the alienation of intersexed sub-\njects from their bodies. Physical secrets, like other toxic and\ndangerous secrets, cause the subjects who experience them\nto occupy opposing worlds. On one hand, intersexed subjects\nlive in a world run and disciplined by the rules of the secret\nand its agents, a world whose social, gender, and sexual\nnorms are reproduced, filed under an imaginary sexual/gen-\nder ideal. On the other hand, they experience in their bodies\na world that opposes both the rules of the secret's game and\nthe secrecy and social norms regarding sex/gender. The body\ndoes not \"know\" how to conceal the secret and treats it like a\n\"foreign body,\" causing tension and unease. Thus, it reveals\nthe secret through pain, inflammation, scarring, residual\ninternal genitalia, and the side effects of synthetic hormones,\nproducing a kind of dialectical \"corporeal realism\" (Shilling,\n2005) experienced by the intersexed subject, according to\nwhich his or her body simultaneously exists/does not exist, is\npresent/absent, is hidden/visible. This dialectical corporeal\nrealism produces a vicious circle; when intersexed subjects\nreveal the physical secret and become aware of the differ-\nence between their bodies and social sex and gender norms,\nthey become its agents and reproduce the rules that conceal\nit. Thus, Or, Shai, and Ronnie conceal their physical secrets\nfrom their siblings and other relatives, just as individuals\nwith conditions such as CAIS, ovotestis, or gonadal digene-\nsis may conceal their chromosomal and gonadal characteris-\ntics, or CAH individuals conceal their presurgery genital\ncharacteristics, from intimate partners. But the body objects\nand responds in its own particular terms, a situation that cre-\nates tension and conflict with the rules of concealment and\noften leads to a continuation of the \"normalization\" of the\nbody into a particular sexual ideal. And yet, the more the\nbodily secret continues to operate in the lives of the inter-\nsexed, the longer they try to conceal it from those around\nthem and from themselves, the more they experience alien-\nation from the body, alienation caused by the body and expe-\nrienced in the body. The bodily secret disconnects and\nseparates body and mind, and distinguishes between them as\nwell as between consciousness and being and between soci-\nety and its norms and the material body. Bodily secrets pro-\nduce a constant conflict that makes the existence of embodied\nsubjects impossible, as they are caught between conflicting\nworlds. The only way to escape the vicious circle in which\nintersexed people are imprisoned is to end the paradoxical\nattempt to conceal the intersexed body in the public space in\ngeneral and from intersexed subjects in particular. That is,\nthe surgical practices and the secrecy that surround them,\nwhose goal is to reproduce some kind of typical sexual/gen-\nder ideal and not necessarily to save lives or prevent physical\ndanger (except in rare cases in which gonads become cancer-\nous), do not ensure the welfare and happiness of intersexed\nsubjects. On the contrary, they endanger their lives and\nundermine their social, familial, and intimate relationships.\nThe intersexed body has existed since the dawn of history.\nAttempts to make it disappear or to conceal it are damaging\nnot only to intersexed people and their families but also to\nbiomedical science, which, instead of attempting to normal-\nize intersexed bodies, could learn much from them about the\ndifferent ways in which the human body develops and the\nmany challenges that it presents.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n1. I understood the difference between privacy and secrecy at\na later stage of my research. While privacy and secrecy are\nsimilar in that they both include an element of concealment,\nresearchers who differentiate between these two concepts\nclaim that privacy is legitimate and ethical because every per-\nson has a right to protect his privacy as long as it does not\nharm others. While secrets and secrecy are supposed to be\nconcealed, this concealment is directed at people from whom\nthe secret is concealed, to whose lives the secret is connected.\nWhen information connected to the life, emotions, or body of\nanother person is involved, the secret is unethical and damages\nthe lives of others, from whom it is kept and to whose lives it\n 2. This traditional protocol was also called the \"Money Protocol\"\n3. Hermaphroditism was the traditional clinical term for inter-\nsexed patients and was replaced in 2005, following the Chicago\nconference, to \"Disorder of Sex Development\" (DSD).\n 4. Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) fell apart follow-\ning its support of the term \"DSD\" and Chase, now called Bo\nLaurent, became the head of Accord Alliance group, which is\ndevoted to supporting research and clinical cooperation with\nbiomedical professionals.\n5. Currently, various intersex and interdisciplinary groups are\nacting to raise awareness of intersexed peoples' rights and to\nchange medical treatment. Among these are the Organization\nof Intersex International (OII), European Network for\nPsychSocial studies in Intersex/DSD (EUROPSI), Accord\nAlliance, and others.\n 6. Joan Fujimura (2006) analyzed the protocols of genetic stud-\nies and the attempt of science to determine which genes cause\nthe formation of female and male sex. It was found that sci-\nence is deliberately ignoring findings that are inconsistent with\nthe dual sexual perception. For example, while scientists sug-\ngest that SRY is the gene that causes the formation of male\ncharacteristics such as testicles, they ignored a fertile female\nmouse with an XX chromosome bearing the SRY gene, pos-\nsibly because they could not explain this finding.\n 7. Can we separate the human body from social forces, language,\nand norms? Examining and researching human bodies, the\nmedical discourse makes no separation between sex and gen-\nder norms. How can we capture the gender category and its\nmanifestation in the sexual body? Parents use gendered lan-\nguage with their babies, but could they really predict that their\nbabies will grow up to be a sis-gender person? Where does\nsex (body) begin and gender (socialization) end? Intersexed\npeople become \"intersexed\" immediately after integrating\nwith the biosocial gaze, which characterizes and defines them\naccording to normative sex/gender frames. I would like to\nthank the reviewers for their insightful comments on this point.\n 8. This is an outdated medical term that indicates a situation in\nwhich the internal sex organs are \"female,\" and include uterus,\novaries, and fallopian tubes, while the external physical char-\nacteristics (phenotype) are male and the external genitals\nappear \"male.\" In Shai's case, this took the form of a penis\nwith a \"normative\" urethral opening at the tip of the penis and\nnot elsewhere as happens in similar conditions (adrenal hyper-\nplasia) and the structure of a scrotum, but no testes.\n9. I interviewed Shai's endocrinologist to get a historical per-\nspective on treatment methods in cases of the intersexed in\nIsrael. Without being asked, the doctor began to tell me about\na unique case that he had treated and I understood that he was\ntalking about Shai.\n10. This syndrome is attributed to people with XY46 sex chro-\nmosomes. There are two forms of \"androgen insensitivity\nsyndrome\"--complete and partial. In the complete form, the\nbody does not respond to androgens and does not develop as\nmale. The gonads--testicles--are undeveloped and remain in\nthe groin (in some cases creating a hernia) or abdomen. The\nphenotype appears \"female,\" with female external genitalia--\nexternal labia, vagina, and clitoris. Frequency is 1 in 13,000 to\n20,000 births. In the partial form, the body responds to andro-\ngenic hormones partially, testes develop, and the phenotype\nis integrated--\"ambiguous genitalia.\" The older term for AIS\nwas \"testicular feminization syndrome\" (Harper, 2007).\n11. For example, Ronnie told me about a woman with Complete\nAndrogen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS) whom she met, who\ntold her she had vaginismus, a condition in which the vagina is\ntight or shrinks during intercourse (with penetration), and that\nit caused her pain and discomfort.\nReferences\nAudi, L.
