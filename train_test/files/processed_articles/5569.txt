    "abstract": "Abstract\nA number of recent studies have found that temporary members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)\nexperience increased foreign aid inflows. We use a constrained permutations approach to replicate analyses found in\nVreeland and Dreher (2014). Permuting the timing of country membership on the Security Council, we create placebo\nUNSC membership histories which plausibly could have been observed. We use these placebos to construct a reference\ndistribution for the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between UNSC membership and foreign aid flows and\nthen observe whether or not the observed test statistic for the correlation found in the real-world data is in the tails of\nthis distribution. In other contexts, such empirically based hypothesis tests have revealed a high false-positive rate for\ntraditional, model-based time-series cross-sectional inference. Given the controversial nature of studies about increased\naid flows as secondary benefits of UNSC membership, it is valuable to subject such analyses to additional scrutiny. Our\nreanalysis largely validates existing findings.\n",

A recent wave of aid allocation studies has turned to\nunderstanding how aid flows respond to specific geopoliti-\ncal events. A number of these studies have focused on how\nthe rotation of aid-receiving countries into the 10 non-per-\nmanent United Nations Security Council (UNSC) seats\nKuziemko and Werker (2006) find that US aid flows\nincrease by 59% to countries rotating onto the Security\nCouncil. Vreeland and Dreher (2014) find that temporary\nUNSC members receive nearly twice as much aid as non-\nmembers from the five major bilateral donors; are more\nlikely to participate in IMF programs with lower levels of\npolicy conditionality; and are more likely to receive multi-\nlateral development bank projects. In sum, there is evidence\nthat international development actors change their behavior\ntoward countries that rotate into UNSC membership.\nForeign aid funnel? A placebo-based\nassessment of aid flows to\nnon-permanent United Nations\nSecurity Council members\nEvangeline M. Reynolds and Matthew S. Winters\n Keywords\nForeign aid, United Nations Security Council, randomization inference, time-series cross-sectional data\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA\nCorresponding author:\nMatthew S. Winters, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 315\nEmail: mwinters@illinois.edu\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nThese studies argue that the institution of non-perma-\nnent member rotation provides leverage for causal identifi-\nidiosyncratic selection process [of non-permanent UNSC\nmembers] and the exogenously enforced term limits allow\nus to make controlled comparisons of (1) individual coun-\ntries on and off the UNSC over time and (2) different coun-\ntries on and off the UNSC during the same period of time.\"\nAlthough countries are not randomly assigned to serve on\nthe Security Council, the selection process is understood to\nsuch an extent and limited in such ways as to make state-\nments about counterfactuals convincing.\nExisting studies have relied on multivariate regression\nmethods for time-series cross-sectional data in order to\nestimate the effect of UNSC membership. Characterizing\nuncertainty in the findings therefore has depended on\nassumptions about and adjustments to the standard errors\nestimated in those regressions. The baseline assumption\nof errors estimated by ordinary least squares regression is\nthat the observations are independently and identically\ndistributed. Clustering in the data means that the number\nof informative observations in the data is less than the\nraw N would suggest; unadjusted standard errors might\nbe overoptimistic (Angrist and Pischke, 2009; Erikson\net al., 2014). One solution--employed by existing studies\nof the UNSC\u00adforeign aid link--is to calculate standard\nerrors to account for clustering. In this paper, we test the\nrobustness of this correction using constrained randomi-\nzation tests.\nStandard regression methods estimate a test statistic\nbased on the ratio of an estimated coefficient to an esti-\nmated standard error. When the coefficient is sufficiently\nlarger than the standard error, the test statistic appears in the\ntails of a theoretical probability distribution, and the analyst\nrejects the null hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to\nzero, deeming the estimate \"statistically significant.\"\nPlacebo-based randomization tests create a reference distri-\nbution from the data itself, rather than relying on assump-\ntions about the shape of disturbances in the data (Erikson\net al., 2014). In our constrained randomization test, we cre-\nate a reference distribution of test statistics based on 1000\nplausible but invented Security Council. For each of these\nplacebos, we estimate the relationship between member-\nship and foreign aid flows using the replication dataset and\nmodeling strategy from Vreeland and Dreher (2014). We\nthen determine whether the test statistic produced by the\noriginal data is truly outlying within the distribution of sta-\ntistics estimated using the placebos. The placebo-based\nmethod is less susceptible to false positives than traditional\ndistribution-based tests because the placebo data should\ncontain the real-world clustering and time dependence that\nmight lead to deflated standard errors in traditional tests.\nOur constrained randomization tests largely replicate the\nestimates of uncertainty from Vreeland and Dreher (2014).\nUsing a non-parametric test of statistical significance, we\ndemonstrate the robustness of their claims, providing addi-\ntional evidence that there exists a meaningful correlation\nbetween temporary UNSC membership and increased for-\neign aid flows.\nThe logic linking foreign aid to UNSC\nmembership\nThe idea that foreign aid is a tool of statecraft is well estab-\nlished. As Morgenthau said, \"Much of what goes by the\nname of foreign aid today is in the nature of bribes ... a\nprice paid for political services rendered or to be rendered\"\npro quo transfers. Given the temporary elevation in geopo-\nlitical prominence of states elected to the Security Council,\nsuch states might be the target of additional aid. With regard\nto services being rendered by these temporary UNSC mem-\nbers in exchange for aid, Vreeland and Dreher (2014) pro-\npose that the most powerful countries in the world want to\ngain increased legitimacy for the actions that they take by\nwinning UNSC votes by large margins.\nWhile Vreeland and Dreher (2014) offer several exam-\nples of explicit quid pro quo exchanges (e.g. the United\nStates cutting foreign aid to Yemen in 1990 after it voted\nagainst UNSC Resolution 678 to authorize the use of force\nagainst Iraq), they suggest that increases in foreign aid to\nnon-permanent UNSC members result from a \"complex\nweb\" of connections among ambassadors and government\nagencies. Because of a high-level desire to court the favor\nof temporary UNSC members, foreign aid to these coun-\ntries is more likely to be discussed within national aid agen-\ncies and multilateral institutions.The quid pro quo exchange\nmay be more implicit than explicit.\nBeyond the theoretical arguments for why UNSC mem-\nbership might lead to increased foreign aid flows, this\nexplanatory variable has characteristics that are desirable\nfrom the standpoint of causal inference. Rotation on and off\nthe Security Council allows us to make predictions about\nprecise windows during which treatment effects should be\nobserved. While service on the Security Council is not ran-\ndom, the timing of service on the Security Council is\ndemonstrably orthogonal to other determinants of aid\nflows, such as a state's level of economic development or\nthe amounts of aid that it has received in previous time peri-\nods (Bueno de Mesquita and Smith, 2010; Vreeland and\nDreher, 2014). In fact, the most important determinant of\nservice seems to be the amount of time since a country last\nserved on the Council (i.e. there exists a norm of turn-tak-\ning, particularly among African countries; Vreeland and\ndescribe temporary UNSC membership as something that\ncan be considered \"a chance event.\"\nReynolds and Winters 3\nExisting methods\nAlthough Vreeland and Dreher (2014) assert the exogeneity\nof UNSC membership, their main analyses rely on multivari-\nate linear regression models controlling for background char-\nacteristics that plausibly affect both election to the Security\nCouncil and foreign aid flows. Specifically, they control for\nwhether a country--in a given year--is a pariah state or at\nwar, and also for the country's GDP per capita, regime type,\nand level of incoming military assistance from the United\nStates. To control for other time-invariant country character-\nistics, they include country fixed effects. They also include\nyear fixed effects and a region-specific quartic time trend. A\nsimilar strategy is employed in Kuziemko and Werker (2006)\nof UNSC membership on economic growth, democracy,\nand press freedom, Bueno de Mesquita and Smith (2010)\nuse a nearest-neighbor matching analysis to identify the set\nof counterfactual non-UNSC-member cases that are most\nsimilar to temporary members in a given year in terms of\npopulation, GDP per capita, and level of democracy.\nThe constrained permutation method\nmutation method to construct a randomization test. We com-\npare the test statistic for the observed correlation between\nUNSC membership and foreign aid flows to a distribution of\nteststatisticsfromcorrelationsestimatedusingplaceboSecurity\nCouncil. This process yields an empirically derived p-value\nthat we compare to those in Vreeland and Dreher (2014).\nThinking about alternative UNSC membership profiles\nthat realistically might have been observed, we know that\nexactly 10 countries will be on the Security Council each\nyear, and these countries obviously must be members of the\nUnited Nations.1 We know that these countries will come\nfrom five different regional groups.2 And we know that\ntreatment for each country will start and stop at a particular\nmoment in time and that, given the rule against reelection,\nno country will receive consecutive treatments. Finally, we\nrecognize that some countries appear on the Security\nCouncil with greater frequency than others.\nThus, our constrained permutation approach creates pla-\ncebo Security Councils based on (a) membership rules and\n(b) the observed frequency of UNSC participation. We\nassign countries to terms on our counterfactual Security\nCouncils based on the number of times that they have his-\ntorically served on the Security Council (since 1946), while\nrespecting the regional distribution and the prohibition on\nback-to-back terms. Brazil, for instance, has served on the\nSecurity Council 10 times. Therefore, in each of our pla-\ncebo UNSC histories, Brazil appears on the Security\nCouncil 10 times. For each permutation, however, the spe-\ncific terms for which Brazil has tenure on the Council have\nbeen independently assigned.3\nWe also constrain our placebos to account for two tem-\nporal variations in the operation of elections to the\nSecurity Council. First, regional groupings changed in\n1966. Our permutations, therefore, create hypothetical\nthe five regional groupings that existed over that time\nperiod and hypothetical Security Councils for the period\nthere have been 15 instances in which countries have\nserved only a single-year term. Three of these were on the\nthese single-year terms are constrained to be single-year\nterms in historical time, and a country that is assigned to\none of the relevant terms (e.g. the slot that was actually\nheld by the Philippines in 1963) serves only a single year\non that placebo Security Council rather than the standard\ntwo years. Countries are assigned only to a tenure held by\na country from their same regional grouping and are\nassigned only in the years during which they were UN\nmember states.4 As a general rule of thumb, we would\nwant someone knowledgeable about the Security Council\nto have difficulty identifying which Security Councils\nactually existed and which are placebos.\nOther scholars have used permutation in a less con-\nstrained way. Erikson et al. (2014) scramble at random the\nidentities associated with countries for the independent\nvariable of interest in order to create a reference distribu-\ntion in a time-series cross sectional setting. In the context of\nUNSC compositions, we are less comfortable with such an\nunconstrained permutation because such a procedure would\nresult in implausible compositions. For example, an uncon-\nstrained permutation might substitute Palau's Security\nCouncil profile for Italy's. Such a move might contribute to\nobserving an incorrect number of states from the regional\ngroups or to countries being assigned an unrepresentative\nnumber of times: Palau has never served on the Security\nCouncil while Italy is a relatively frequent member. Our\ncomparisons therefore are constrained in the sense that per-\nmutations are plausible given what we know about the his-\ntory of UNSC elections.\nWe merge 1000 placebo UNSC histories with the data\nfrom Vreeland and Dreher (2014), which covers the period\nexclude the parts of the placebo histories that are outside of\nthis period. In Chapter 5 of their book, Vreeland and Dreher\near regression models of foreign aid. There are four types of\nmodels, each of which is estimated across 13 different\ndonors: the largest five bilateral donors and eight multilat-\neral donors.5 The first set of regressions model aid to 125\ncountries as a function of an indicator variable for tempo-\nrary UNSC membership. The authors' estimate for the\nUNSC indicator is statistically significant for Japan,\nGermany, the International Bank for Reconstruction and\n4 Research and Politics \nDevelopment (IBRD), and the UN High Commissioner for\nRefugees (UNHCR).6 The second set of regressions is iden-\ntical except that the authors interact the UNSC indicator\nwith indicators of UNSC activity in a given year, classify-\ning each year as unimportant, somewhat important, or\nimportant. In these models, Vreeland and Dreher (2014)\nfind statistically significant correlations between UNSC\nmembership during important years and aid flows from the\nUnited States, Germany, and the IBRD.7 The third set of\nmodels are estimated for 49 African recipient countries and\nthe authors find that UNSC membership significantly pre-\ndicts increased aid flows to these countries from Japan, the\nIBRD, the International Development Association (IDA),\nthe United Nations in general, the World Food Programme\n(WFP), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and\nthe UNHCR.8 Finally, the fourth set of regressions model\naid toAfrican recipient countries as a function of serving on\nthe Security Council during important years or not.\nVreeland and Dreher (2014) find significant correlations\nbetween UNSC membership by African recipients in\nimportant years and aid flows from the United States, the\nIBRD, the WFP, and the UNHCR.9\nWe replicate the regression models just described using\nthe set of 1000 placebo Security Councils. For each\nregression model that we estimate, we use the same speci-\nfication as Vreeland and Dreher (2014) and retain the esti-\nmated t-statistic on the variable of interest (UNSC\nmembership in the first two sets of regressions and UNSC\nmembership during important years in the latter two sets\nof regressions). The t-statistic on the coefficient of inter-\nest is a \"pivotal statistic\" because it is adjusted for correla-\ntion among the other variables included in the regression\nWe create reference distributions and generate randomi-\nzation-based two-tailed p-values by doubling the propor-\ntion of test statistics in the reference distribution which are\nmore extreme than the observed t-statistic produced by the\nstatistical model of the real world data.10 This number tells\nus whether or not that original t-statistic was outlying based\nnot on the Student's t-distribution but instead on an empiri-\ncal distribution of t-statistics produced by analyzing the\npatterns found in the placebo data.\nResults\nAs can be seen in Tables 1\u00ad4, our randomization-based\np-values are almost always quite close to the distribution-\nbased p-values reported in Vreeland and Dreher (2014). In\nsome cases, they suggest slightly more precision (e.g. for\nJapanese and German aid flows in Table 1), and in some cases\nthey suggest slightly less precision (e.g. for US and UNICEF\naid flows in Table 1).11 But generally speaking, the randomiza-\ntion-based methods that we employ validate the levels of sta-\ntistical significance reported in Vreeland and Dreher (2014).\nThe model for which we see a relatively substantial\nchange in the p-value linked to a regression coefficient that\nVreeland and Dreher (2014) consider to be statistically sig-\nnificant is found in Table 2. The randomization p-value\nreported for the coefficient on the relationship between\nUNSC membership in important years and aid flows from\nthe United States is more than five times the distribution-\nbased p-value reported in Vreeland and Dreher's Table 5.1:\nfidence interval and report that dropping certain control\nvariables from the model increases the size of the t-statistic,\nTable 1.

In each figure, we plot a theoretical\nt-distribution and the t-statistic from the real-world data.\nWe then overlay the reference distribution created from the\nt-statistics produced using data from the 1000 placebo\nSecurity Councils, and we report the median t-statistic\nobserved in this reference distribution. Figure 1 draws on\nthe analyses of US aid flows; Figure 2 on analyses of\nJapanese aid flows.\nIn the plot in the lower left-hand corner of Figure 1\n(reflecting the models using the African subset and study-\ning all years) and across three of the four plots in Figure 2,\nwe see a very strong incidence between the Student's t-dis-\ntribution and the randomization-based distribution. In the\nremaining three plots in Figure 1 and in the fourth plot in\nFigure 2, the coincidence of the theoretical and randomiza-\ntion-based distributions is somewhat less. For the US data,\nin particular, this non-coincidence of our placebo-based\nreference distribution and the standard t-distribution sug-\ngests that there are aspects of the data that make standard\nsignificance tests inappropriate.\nAs the first rows of Tables 2 and 3--corresponding to\nthe two plots in the right-hand column of Figure 1--make\nclear, the level of uncertainty in the findings for the United\nStates is somewhat greater than what conventional tests\nindicate. The observed t-statistic of 1.90 from the real\nUNSC data is not located as deeply in the tail of the pla-\ncebo-based reference distribution as in the tail of the theo-\nretical t-distribution. This more central location implies a\nrandomization p-value of p < 0.33, more than five times as\nlarge as the p-value of p < 0.06 calculated using the theo-\nretical t-distribution. In Figure 2, on the other hand, it is\neasy to see how the observed t-statistics from the regres-\nsions of Japanese aid on real-world UNSC membership are\nin the tails for the plots related to Japanese aid flows to all\ncountries and to African countries, mirroring the small\np-values presented in Tables 1 and 3.\nConclusions\nPrevious work has pointed out that p-values produced by\nstandard statistical analysis of complicated time-series\ncross-sectional data might not accurately reflect the level of\nuncertainty in coefficient estimates (Erikson et al., 2010,\n2014). One method for addressing this and creating more\naccurate statistical significance estimates is to create a ref-\nerence distribution for a test statistic based on a set of coun-\nterfactual placebos generated by permuting the existing\ndata. Such permutation-based tests are popular in the\nexperimental literature (Gerber and Green, 2012) and have\nbeen increasingly applied to observational data.\nIn this paper, we have replicated a substantial portion of\nthe analysis from Chapter 5 of Vreeland and Dreher's\n(2014) book on how foreign aid flows respond to tempo-\nrary membership on the Security Council. We largely\nreproduce the statistical uncertainty estimates that those\nauthors obtain using clustered standard errors in a multi-\nvariate regression. We have provided additional validation\nof the inferential claims that the authors make.\nIn doing so, we have made use of constrained permu-\ntype of analysis creates a placebo test using a simulation\nprocess that mirrors as closely as possible the data-gen-\nerating process. In our case, we have constrained our\nhypothetical Security Council to follow the regional dis-\ntribution of temporary UNSC members and to respect\nthe prohibition of consecutive terms for temporary\nUNSC members. Just as permutation-based tests in the\nexperimental literature make use of information that the\nanalyst has about the way in which the randomization of\ntreatment occurred, our constrained permutation tests\nwill be most plausible where the analyst has extensive\nknowledge about the data-generating process.
