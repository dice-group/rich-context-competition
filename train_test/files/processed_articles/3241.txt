The focus is on the integration of\ninformation about asymmetric developments, upward or downward risks, in the\ninput factors of forecast variables. Parametric as well as non-parametric\nprocedures are discussed.\nThe parametric approach is based on asymmetrically weighted normal\ndistributions, using a logistic function to obtain a continuous density. This allows\nto integrate asymmetric information about the distribution of input factors, which\nmay be correlated, and to aggregate them consistently. To generate\nasymmetry, this procedure requires weaker modifications of the underlying\nnormal distribution than other widely used methods.\nMore complex forecast models do not allow to determine forecast\nuncertainty analytically. In these cases stochastic simulation techniques can be\napplied. This paper uses non-parametric bootstrap procedures as they\ncircumvent the need to make artificial assumption about the distribution of the\nstochastic shock terms in the model. To generate forecast intervals for the\nendogenous variables, the bootstrap recurs to the same asymmetric weighting\nscheme as in the parametric approach.\nFinally, the asymmetric bootstrap is applied to the econometric model of\nthe Bundesbank. The Bundesbank model is an empirically estimated, dynamic\nand non-linear macroeconometric model for Germany with about 180 variables.\nIf the estimated residuals of the model are used asymmetrically in the bootstrap,\nasymmetric forecast intervals of the endogenous variables are obtained.\nHowever, the asymmetry of the shocks is partly absorbed within the model\nstructure such that the endogenous variables of interest, like real growth and\ninflation, exhibit markedly less skewness than the shocks.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nIn der vorliegenden Arbeit werden Methoden zur Quantifizierung von\nRisiko und Unsicherheit bei der Prognose makro\u00f6konomischer Variablen\nentwickelt.

Introduction\nMonetary policy decisions are based on forecasts of inflation, output\ngrowth and many other macroeconomic variables. Central banks often rely on\ndeterministic point forecasts, usually supplemented by verbal qualifications.\nFrequently, baseline forecasts are complemented by alternative scenarios,\nsingled out as likely alternatives to the baseline. The obtained range of point\nforecasts, however, is not a forecast interval which covers a well-defined\nprobability of outcomes.\nDeterministic forecasts do not allow to quantify the associated uncertainty\n(dispersion of the distribution) and risk (degree of asymmetry) properly. Wallis\n(2007, 54) points out that \"it is now widely recognised that a point forecast is\nseldom sufficient for well-informed decision-making in the face of an uncertain\nfuture, and that it needs to be supplemented with an indication of the degree of\nuncertainty.\" Uncertainty intervals underline the inherently uncertain nature of\nforecasts, they enhance the transparency of a central bank in its communication\nwith the public, and they facilitate the internal discussion by focussing it on the\nsources of uncertainty and their quantitative importance (Blix and Sellin, 1999).\nThe shape of the uncertainty intervals provides the public with information about\nthe forecast risks. Depending on the loss functions of the public, information\nabout forecast risks can be as important as information about forecast\nuncertainty. As an example, consider large losses only in case of deflation, and\na positive inflation forecast with low uncertainty but a large downward risk.\nCentral banks do not rely on a single econometric model to generate their\nforecasts. Usually a suite of models is applied and subjective judgements play\nan important role. The quantification of forecast risk and uncertainty in such an\nenvironment is not a straightforward task. Resulting in the well-known \"fan\ncharts\", the Bank of England (Britton, Fisher, and Whitley, 1998) pioneered a\nparametric procedure to determine the distribution of a linear combination of\nskewed, yet independent, random input variables. The two-piece normal\ndistribution is utilised to introduce skewness into the forecast input variables.\nRecently, at the Bank of Portugal a parametric method was developed that\nachieves skewness by a combination of normal and exponential variates and\nallows for correlated input variables (Novo and Pinheiro, 2005).\nIn this paper, we discuss a parametric and a non-parametric procedure for\nquantification of risk and uncertainty in macroeconomic forecasts, mainly\nfocussing on risk. Whereas the former procedure is based on a generalisation\nof the normal distribution, the latter relies on bootstrap simulations. Skewness is\nintroduced by an asymmetric weighting scheme.\nSection 2 introduces a parametric class of asymmetrically weighted normal\n(AWN) distributions for constructing forecast intervals. In section 3 a non-\nparametric asymmetric bootstrap procedure to calculate forecast intervals that\ntake risk into account is discussed. This procedure is closely related to the AWN\ndistributions investigated in section 2. The methods presented in both sections\nallow to handle skewness without affecting the mean and the variance of the\ninput variables. In section 4 the asymmetric bootstrap is applied to generate\nforecasts with the structural macroeconometric model of the Bundesbank.\nSection 5 concludes.\n2. Forecast intervals based on AWN distributions\nTo quantify forecast risks, according to Azzalini (1985, 171): \"it would be\nideal to have at hand a class of densities with the following properties: \"strict\ninclusion\" of the normal density, mathematical tractability, wide range of the\nindices of skewness and kurtosis.\" Based on the Gaussian normal distribution,\nwe introduce a class of asymmetrically weighted normal (AWN) distributions\nwhich comes close to these requirements. AWN distributions include the normal\nas a special case, they allow to quantify asymmetric risk by a single, easily\ninterpretable parameter, the density of a linear combination of correlated AWN\nvariables can be obtained by standard numerical integration techniques, and for\none of the AWN distributions, there is no lower or upper bound for its skewness\nand no upper bound for its kurtosis.\n2.1.Forecasts as linear combinations of input factors\nAssume that the deterministic point forecast for a macroeconomic variable\n(W)\n , i.e. inflation or output growth, is a linear combination of input variables\nk\n(X )\n\nw x ... x , h T 1, ... ,T H\nD   D  \n  \nwhere the Dk,h\nare (estimated or calibrated) interim multipliers or elasticities and\nh denotes the forecast horizon.1 The forecasts may be the output of an\neconometric forecasting model, they may be based on expert judgement, or on\na combination of both.\nWe assume that the forecast errors of the input variables, denoted as\nk,t k,t k,t\n  , are normal, with zero mean (unbiasedness) and variance V2 >\n(z; ) e\n\u00a7 \u00b7\n \u00a8 \u00b8\nV\nSV\nWe are interested in the density of a linear combination of forecast errors\nh h h\n  :\ny z ... z\nD   D\nThe error variables Zk\nmay be correlated with covariance matrix 6. The density\nof their linear combination (3) can be obtained by standard procedures (Fisz,\n1976). The resulting density would be symmetric, however.\n2.2.The asymmetrically weighted normal (AWN)\ndistribution\nOften, in a specific forecasting round, the forecaster may have information\nwhich leads him to judge the forecast risks to be asymmetric, tilted upward or\n1 We adopt the common convention to use uppercase letters for random variables and\nlowercase letters for their realizations.\ndownward. Hence, led by subjective judgement, he may wish to deviate from\nthe normal distribution by rendering the forecasts asymmetric.\nDespite the importance of risk in macroeconomic forecasts, there is no\nestablished procedure for quantification of these risks. According to Machina\nand Rothschild (1987), there are two basic requirements for a measure of risk.\nFirst, the measure of risk must be related to the probability distribution of the\nunderlying random variable, e.g. inflation or output growth. Second, the risk\nmeasure should be linked to preferences of the forecasting agent. Often,\nquadratic loss functions are used in order to represent such preferences, as\npointed out by Woodford (2003, ch. 6). However, loss functions can take many\nfunctional forms. Kilian and Manganelli (2007), for example, proposed an\nasymmetric loss function for the risk of deflation and excessive inflation.\nBecause there is no generally accepted specification of a loss function, in this\npaper we express the risk assessment of the forecaster simply as a probability.\nAn upward (downward) risk in the forecast of an input factor is measured by the\nprobability of a positive (negative) forecast error.\nAssume that for the forecast period an upward forecast risk with probability Z is\nexpected. To take this into account, the random variable Z is transformed\naccording to Z J( ) Z (1 J( )) Z\n{ Z   Z , where J(Z) is an indicator variable which\ntakes the value 1 with probability Z and the value 0 with probability 1\u00adZ. The\ndensity function of the variable Z is defined as\n Z M V \n\nV Z \u00ae\nZ M V t\n\u00af\nf(z; , )\nd Z d denoting the probability of an upward risk.2 The (risk\u00adadjusted)\nrandom variable Z has an asymmetrically weighted normal (AWN) distribution\nwith density f(z; , )\nV Z : Z AWN( , )\n .\nThe transformation shifts probability mass from the left hand side of the\nunderlying normal distribution to the right hand side (or vice versa) by\n2 The asymmetric weighting scheme can be applied to any parametric density function. In\nsection 3 we apply the asymmetric weighting scheme non\u00adparametrically in stochastic model\nsimulations.\nproportionally scaling the density up or down, respectively. The AWN\ndistribution has two parameters, V as a measure of uncertainty and Z as a\nmeasure of risk (asymmetry). For Z = 0.5 the normal distribution with zero mean\nis obtained as a special case. For 1( 0)\nZ o o the so called half-normal\ndistribution results, which may be regarded as extreme asymmetry. The mode\nof the AWN is zero. The AWN density jumps at z = 0, the absolute size of the\nZ  M . For the interval [a,b] \n \\ , with a b\n , we obtain:\nP(z 0) P(a z b)\nt Z d d\n  Z  d d \nHence, the asymmetric weighting scheme does not distort the relative\nprobabilities of the underlying normal distribution M(z). This is a desirable\nfeature because no a priori knowledge with regard to more or less likely sub-\nintervals for upward or downward risks is implied. The mean of the AWN is\nV\nZ  Z  V\nS\nand its higher (central) moments turn out as:\nV m\nV \nV\nV   V\nwhere V denotes the second, S the third and W the fourth central moment. For\nZ = 0.5 the moments of the normal distribution are obtained: m = 0, V = V2, S =\nThe forecaster may not wish that the risk assessment changes the mean and\nvariance of an input variable. In this case the following modification of the\ndensity function (4) can be applied:\n Z M V \n\nV Z \u00ae\nZ M V t\n\u00af\nf(z; , )\nwith\nZ  Z\n Z Z\n,\nSimilar to the two-piece normal distribution (John, 1982), the underlying normal\ndistribution has variance V1\n) for negative (positive) values of Z. The\nprobability for positive outcomes for the variable Z is\nf\n! ZM V Z Z\nP(z 0) 2 (z, )dz 2 / 2 , as desired. Moreover, its mean and\nvariance are zero and V2, respectively:\nE(z) 2(1 )z (z, )dz 2 z (z, )dz\nf\nf\n Z M V  Z M V\n Z  V S  Z V S\nV(z) 2(1 ) z (z, )dz 2 z (z, )dz\nf\nf\n Z M V  Z M V\n Z  Z V\nHence, despite skewness, the mean and the variance of the distribution remain\nunchanged. Also note that no new parameter was introduced to get this\nproperty. The skewness s(z) and the kurtosis w(z) are given by\n   \n Z\n\nS  Z Z\n Z Z\n.\nObviously, there is no upper or lower limit for skewness and no upper limit for\nkurtosis. The lowest kurtosis equals 3 and is obtained with Z = 0.5, i.e. in the\ncase where Z is normally distributed.\n2.3.The logistic asymmetrically weighted normal\n(LAWN) distribution\nIn principle, the density of the linear combination (3) of several AWN\u00adrandom\nvariables could be calculated. However, due to the discontinuity, this exercise is\nburdensome because a rapidly increasing number of cases has to be treated\nseparately. For this reason we apply a continuous approximation of the AWN.\nConsider the logistic function\nz\nz\ne\n f d d f d d\n\nIts derivative H'(z) is a density, which is symmetric about zero. The logistic\nasymmetric weight function is now defined as\n(9) O Z  Z  O  Z O\nG( z; ) (1 )(1 H( z)) H( z)\nd Z d , and O > 0 is a technical coefficient that controls the closeness\nof the approximation to the step function (4). Chart 1 shows the logistic weight\nWith increasing O the approximation to the weighting scheme of the AWN\nbecomes closer. In the limit we get:\nOof\nZ t\n\nO Z \u00ae\n Z \n\u00af\nlim G( z; )\nWe define the logistic asymmetrically weighted normal (LAWN) distribution for\nthe random Variable Z as:\n(11) f(z; , , ) 2G( z; ) (z; )\nwhere M V\n(z; ) is the density of a normal random variable Z with zero mean and\nvariance V2: Z LAWN( , , )\n .\nthe following\nLemma: Let M be a density function symmetric about zero, and : an\nabsolute continuous distribution function such that :' is symmetric about\n0. Then : O M f   f\n2 ( z) (z) ( z ) is a density function for any real O.\nFrom this lemma we deduce the\nCorollary: If : O M\n2 ( z) (z) is a density, and G(Oz) is the logistic weighting\nfunction (9) then 2G( z) (z)\nO M is a density function as well.\nProof: The logistic function H in (8) satisfies the requirements of : in the\nlemma. Since G(Oz) in (9) can be written as (2 1)H( z) 1\nZ  O   Z, the\nfollowing holds:\n2G( z) (z)dz\nf\nf\nf f\nf f\nZ  O M   Z M\nZ    Z\nSince, in addition, all other conditions for density functions are fulfilled by\n(11), f(z; , , ) 2G( z; ) (z; )\nZ V O O Z M V is a density function.\nIf the forecaster wants to preserve the mean and variance of the risk-adjusted\nforecast, a modification similar to (4') can be applied\nf(z; , , ) 2(1 )(1 H( z)) (z; ) 2 H( z) (z; )\nV Z O  Z  O M V  Z O M V\nare defined in (4').\nChart 2a shows the density function (11) for [V 1,Z=0.5,O=0] (standard\nshows the same distributions with mean and variance preserved according to\nTable 1 provides numerical moments of the LAWN\u00addistribution. For Z = 0.5\n(any O) or for O = 0 (any Z) the normal distribution is obtained as a special case.\nWith increasing O the moments of the LAWN distribution rapidly approach to\nthose of the AWN distribution.\nTable 1: Moments of LAWN - distributions\nZ O P(z > 0) m s V w\nV = 1 ; mean = m = E(Z), variance = V = E(Z-m)2, skewness = s = E(Z-m)3/V3/2 ,\nkurtosis = w = E(Z-m)4/V2; mean and variance preserved values in brackets\nAs the figures in brackets of Table 1 show, applying the mean- and variance-\npreserving modification effectively fixes the mean and the variance of the LAWN\ndistribution at 0 and 1, respectively. However, skewness as well as kurtosis\nincrease sharply, indicating a stronger deviation from the underlying normal.\n2.4. Comparison to other skewed distributions\nIn this section we briefly discuss three alternative skewed distributions, all\nbased on the normal, and compare them to the LAWN.\nAzzalini (1985) defines the \"skew-normal distribution\" (SN) as3\nV D ) D M V\nwhere\nz\n(z; ) e , ( z) (t)dt\n\u00a7 \u00b7\n D\n\u00a8 \u00b8\nV\nf\nM V ) D M\nS\nare the density and the distribution function of the normal, respectively. The\nshape parameter D generates skewness. For D o f the SN distribution\nconverges to the half-normal. The normal is included as a special case for D =\nAt the Bank of England, Britton, Fisher and Whitley (1998) use the \"two-piece\nnormal distribution\" (TPN) with density\n(z; ), z 0\nf(z; , )\n(z; ), z 0\nV\n\nM V \n\u00b0 V  V\n\u00b0\nV V \u00ae\nV\n\u00b0 M V t\n\u00b0V  V\n\u00af\nHere,\nj\n(z; )\nM V , j=1,2, denotes the density of the normal distribution with zero\nmean and variance 2\nj\nV . The TPN distribution is also discussed by Blix and Sellin\nno convenient multivariate generalisation\".\nAt the Bank of Portugal, Novo and Pinheiro (2005) developed the \"skewed\ngeneralized normal distribution\" (SGN) as a linear combination of two\nindependent random variables\nT  T  T , where\nT T  T !\n\\ .\nis a standard normal variable and Z2\nfollows an exponential\ndistribution.

The final column gives the Jarque-Bera (JB)\u00adstatistic for testing normality:\nJB s\n\u00aa \u00ba\n\n\u00a7 \u00b7\n\n\u00ab \u00bb\n\u00a8 \u00b8\n\u00ab \u00bb\n\u00ac \u00bc\nwhere the sample size was arbitrarily set to n = 100. The widely used JB\u00ad\nstatistic, which is independent of V2, tests whether a linear combination of\nskewness and kurtosis deviates from the values implied by the normal\ndistribution (s = 0, w = 3).4 Measured by the JB\u00adstatistic, the LAWN distribution\nyields the smallest distortion of the underlying normal distribution, closely\nfollowed by Azzalini's SN distribution. Achieving the same upside risk of Z =\n0.40 with the TPN distribution results in a somewhat bigger distortion of the\nnormal. However, in all three cases the deviation from the normal would not be\nstatistically significant at the 5 % level.\nTable 2: Moments of asymmetric distributions\nDistribution P(z > 0) m s V w JB\nMean = m = E(Z), variance = V = E(Z-m)2, skewness = s = E(Z-m)3/V3/2 , kurtosis = w = E(Z-\nIn contrast, using the SGN distribution to introduce asymmetry yields a huge\ndistortion of the normal. Partly this may be due to the fact that the SGN fixes the\nmean at zero.

In this case the JB\u00adtest rejects normality. However,\ncompared to the SGN distribution, the same degree of asymmetry is obtained\nwith a much smaller deviation from normality.\n2.5.The multivariate asymmetrically weighted normal\ndistribution (MLAWN)\nTo calculate the distribution of a linear combination of several LAWN\u00ad\ndistributed input factors, which may or may not be correlated, we generalise the\nlogistic weight function (9) in the following way:\ni i i\nG(z; , ) G (z ; , )\n\nwhere\ni\ni i\nx\ni i i\nx x\nO\nZ   Z\n \nz (z ,z , ...,z ) and\n( , , ..., )\nWith\nZ Z , charts 4.1 and 4.2 show the bivariate logistic weight\nO .\nIncreasing O yields a more pronounced step function.

Charts 5.1 to 5.3 show the MLAWN for the parameters\nU  :\nIn Table 3 it is shown how the weighting scheme influences the probabilities for\ncertain outcomes under the MLAWN compared to the MLAWU uniform\ndistribution in the first row.\nTable 3: Probabilities under the MLAWN distribution\n*) Multivariate logistic asymmetrically weighted uniform distribution\nwith f(zi\n+) Multivariate logistic asymmetrically weighted normal distribution; Z1\nWe now turn to the distribution of a linear combination of MLAWN\u00addistributed \u00ad\npossibly dependent \u00ad random variables, i.e. we want to calculate the aggregate\ndensity of Y in (3).

Forecast intervals based on asymmetric bootstrap\nsimulations\nMany economic models do not allow for an analytical investigation of\nforecast risk and uncertainty. This can for example be due to the size of the\nmodel or due to non-linearities. In this case, stochastic simulations can be used\nto obtain estimates of forecast uncertainty. Stochastic simulations require\nrandom draws from the model's shocks. While this can be achieved using\ndistributional assumptions, it is also possible to use the distribution-free\nbootstrap-approach. In the following it is discussed how the bootstrap approach\ncan be modified to incorporate risk and uncertainty assessments into the\nstochastic simulations. The approach chosen generates shocks which have an\nAWN distribution, if the residuals of the model are normally distributed.\n3.1.Stochastic simulations\nConsider the reduced form of a dynamic economic model consisting of g\nequations given by\nt t 1 t t t\ny F(y , y ,x ,u ; ) t 1...T.\nF denotes a g-vector of functions, yt\n) denotes a g-vector of endogenous\n(lagged endogenous) variables, xt\ndenotes a k-vector of exogenous variables, ut\ndenotes a g-vector of shocks, T is a vector of coefficients, and t = 1...T denotes\nthe estimation sample of the model.

From these samples, the statistics of interest like\nmean, variance, skewness or confidence bounds can be computed.\n3.2.Bootstrap simulations\nFor stochastic simulations, random shocks m\nh\n^\nu are needed for every\nforecast period h and every run m. One way of generating these shocks is\ndrawing random variables from an appropriate distribution. However, often it is\nunclear what the appropriate distribution is. In this case, it can be convenient to\nresort to the bootstrap method. The bootstrap method uses the set of the\nestimated residual vectors ^ `\n^ ^ ^\nu ,u ,...,u from which shocks are drawn with\nreplacement.6 So for every forecast period h and every run m, a number W from\nthe set ^ `\n1,2,...,T is chosen randomly, and the vector W\n^\nu is used as the vector\nof shocks m\nh\n^\nu . The bootstrap method preserves all moments of the empirical\nresiduals like for example variance, skewness and correlations.\n3.3.Asymmetric bootstrap\nIn certain situations, as discussed above, it might be preferable to adjust\nthe moments of the empirical residuals in the stochastic simulations in a certain\nway. Information beyond those contained in the model might point to important\nchanges in moments. For instance, rising political tensions in major OPEC\ncountries or the expectation of a very active hurricane season in the Gulf of\n5 In principle one could also draw random values for T\n^ . However, we abstract from parameter\nuncertainty in this work.\n6 If the residuals have non-zero means, they are recentered prior to resampling as suggested\nMexico can be expected to increase the level and the volatility of the oil price. It\ncan also be appropriate to model asymmetric shocks, for example due to\nupcoming elections which will be won by a liberal party with high probability or\nby a socialist party with low probability. In these cases the standard bootstrap\nmethod can be modified in order to incorporate judgement about future shocks.\nSuppose that the forecaster wants to add judgement about mean and volatility\nof the shock z, where z denotes the i-th element of m\nh\n^\nu ( { m\ni,h\n^\nz u ), i.e. the shock\nto equation i for the forecast horizon h in the run m. This can of course be\nachieved by simply transforming the shock z according to\n\nz a bz b 0\nwhere a is the judgemental mean, b is the judgemental volatility factor for shock\n\nz , and z denotes the original shock. Note that these transformations do not\nchange the correlations with other shocks. Of course, a and b can differ for\neach forecast horizon h and each equation i, but they are constant for every run\nm.\nIf the forecaster wants to incorporate judgement about asymmetric risk, this can\nbe achieved by applying the transformation\n   Z\n\nz J z 1 J z with J J q\nwhere J(q < Z) is the indicator function that takes the value 1 if the condition q <\nZ is satisfied and 0 else; q is the realisation of a random variable which is\nuniformly distributed over the interval [0,1] and Z denotes the judgemental\nprobability that the shock will be larger than zero.7 So J(q < Z) equals 1 in\napproximately 100Z percent of the runs.\nIf the empirical residuals i,t\n^\nu from which the z's are drawn are normally\ndistributed, equation (26) implies that \nz has an AWN distribution, i.e. its density\nis given by (4). Note that with Z = 0.5, \nz is symmetrically distributed regardless\nof the symmetry properties of z.\n7 Z can differ for each forecast horizon h and each equation i, but it is constant for every run\nm.\nIf one intends to preserve the zero-mean property and the variance of the\nshocks, the formula\n Z Z\n \nZ  Z\nz J z 1 J z\ncan be used, which in the case of normally distributed residuals yields the\ndensity (4') for \nz . However, in contrast to (4'), one does not have to assume a\nspecific distribution for z. The mean of \nz equals zero regardless of the\ndistribution of the empirical residuals i,t\n^\nu , since the expectation of \nz is given by\n> @  \n \n\u00aa \u00ba\n Z Z\n \n\u00ab \u00bb\nZ  Z\n\u00ac \u00bc\n\u00aa \u00ba\n Z Z\nZ   Z\n\u00ab \u00bb\nZ  Z\n\u00ac \u00bc\nE z E J z 1 J z\nIn order to investigate the variance of \nz , it is helpful to note that\n\u00aa \u00ba\n\u00aa \u00ba \u00aa \u00ba\nZ    Z\n\u00ac \u00bc \u00ab \u00bb\n\u00ac \u00bc \u00ac \u00bc\nhold.

This means that the variance\nof \nz equals the variance of the empirical residuals if the empirical residuals are\nsymmetrically distributed.\nOf course, (26) and (27) can be combined with (25) to generate shocks with\njudgemental mean, volatility and asymmetry. In this case, one first uses (26) or\n(27) to obtain an asymmetric shock \nz and then applies (25) to this shock in\norder to obtain an asymmetric shock with mean a and standard deviation bV,\nwhere V is the standard deviation of \nz .\nThe correlation of \nz with all other shocks equals zero. Therefore, the proposed\nmethod for generating asymmetries is useful especially if empirical correlations\nare low in absolute value.8 In principle, it is possible to modify the approach\npresented so that correlations can be preserved in many cases. In the\nAppendix, we show how one can generate \nz according to (26) and impose\ncorrelations with another possibly asymmetric shock. However, this modification\nbecomes very complicated if many shocks are involved. Furthermore, not all\nasymmetries can be reconciled with all correlations. For example, if two\nvariables are supposed to be greater than zero in a large number of cases, i.e.\nif both variables have a high Z, this can be incompatible with a negative\ncorrelation between these variables.\nIf the model's residuals have a normal distribution, are independent, and the\nmodel F(.) is linear, the bootstrap approach yields uncertainty and risk\nassessments for the endogenous variables which are identical to those\nobtained analytically in the previous section with the class of AWN distributions.\n4. Stochastic forecasts with the Bundesbank model\nThe Bundesbank model is a dynamic non-linear structural\nmacroeconometric model for Germany containing about 180 variables of which\nabout 40 are exogenous. The model has 50 behavioural equations. In order to\nuse this model for stochastic forecasts, it is transformed in two ways. First, the\nexogenous variables are endogenized by specifying equations in which they\ndepend on their own past values and possibly other formerly exogenous\nvariables. The only variables remaining exogenous are dummies, trends and\n8 This is the case for the Bundesbank model used in Section 4. In this model, more than 90\npercent of the correlations between the residuals do not differ significantly from zero at a\nsignificance level of 5%.\ntax rates. Second, autoregressive equations are specified for the residuals of all\nmodel equations, so that these original residuals become endogenous variables\nof the model, and the new residuals of the autoregressive equations are the\nmodel's residuals. This last step is convenient in order to obtain residuals which\nare free from autocorrelation.9\n4.1.Forecast intervals\nThe stochastic simulations of the Bundesbank model are performed for the\nsimulations. Since the results will be compared to those of an asymmetric\nbootstrap simulation, we use symmetric residuals here. This is achieved by\nmultiplying all residuals of a given run m with a constant O determined by\n \nO   , where again J(q < 0.5) is the indicator function that takes\nthe value 1 if the condition q < 0.5 is satisfied and 0 else, and q is the realisation\nof a uniformly distributed random variable in the interval [0,1].\nChart 7 shows the resulting forecasts for the four-quarter growth rates of GDP\nand the consumption deflator. Confidence bands centred on the median and\ncovering 90% of the forecast distributions are displayed. Each confidence band\ncorresponds to a probability mass of 5%. The dotted line indicates the mean.\nAs one can see for both variables, the mean is almost indistinguishable from the\nmedian. This implies that there is at least no apparent sign of asymmetry for the\nvariables under study.10 The upward shift in the forecast for the consumption\ndeflator in 2007 is caused by the increase in the VAT rate. This tax rate\nincrease also leads to a downward shift of GDP growth in 2007.\n9 One of the reasons why the original residuals can be autocorrelated is the fact that the\nestimation samples can differ from the sample used for bootstrapping. Since every equation of\nthe Bundesbank model is estimated separately, estimation samples can differ from each other.\nThe sample used for bootstrapping is the largest common estimation sample.\n10 The results would be different for example for the growth rate of the energy component of the\nHICP which is strongly asymmetric due to large excise taxes on fuels.\nChart 7: Fan charts for growth rates of real GDP and consumption deflator\n\u00ad symmetric shocks\nfour-quarter growth rate of real GDP\nfour-quarter growth rate of the consumption deflator\nTable 5 shows moments of the stochastic GDP and consumption deflator\nforecasts. Skewness is presented for three different types of growth rates: four-\nquarter growth rates, quarterly growth rates and annual growth rates. For none\nof these growth rates, the coefficient of skewness exceeds 0.1 in absolute\nvalue. Thus, there are no indications of asymmetry for the growth rates of both\nvariables under study.\nTable 5: Moments of stochastic forecast with symmetric shocks\nGDP\nConsumption Deflator\nFor four-quarter and quarterly growth rates, the value for a specific year is\ncalculated as the average quarterly moment observed in that year\n4.2.Asymmetric bootstrap forecasts\nIn order to investigate the results of asymmetric shocks, we choose to\nassume strongly asymmetric shocks for almost all model equations, aiming at\ncreating strongly positively skewed growth rates of GDP.\nUsing formula (27), we set Z to 0.3 for all equations of the expenditure\ncomponents of GDP. Moreover, we set Z to 0.7 for all price equations. In almost\nall other equations, Z is set either to 0.3 or to 0.7, depending on the equation's\ninitial impact on GDP. If a positive shock in the equation under study is\nsupposed to increase GDP growth in the short-run, Z is set to 0.3. If such a\nshock decreases GDP growth in the short-run, Z is set to 0.7. Due to the\nstructure of the model, where higher prices dampen demand, this approach can\nalso be expected to generate negatively skewed growth rates of the\nconsumption deflator.11 The number of asymmetric shocks amounts to about 80.\nChart 8 shows the forecasts resulting from the asymmetric shocks. The mean\nnow lies above the median for the GDP forecast and below the median for the\nconsumer price inflation forecast. However, the differences between mean and\nmedian are very small. Asymmetries of the confidence bands are not too\nevident either. Only the outer two confidence bands appear to differ in size.\nWhile the lowest confidence band for GDP seems to be slightly smaller than the\nhighest one, the lowest confidence band for the consumption deflator appears\nsomewhat wider than the highest one.\n11 Of course, there are several equations where a shock with a positive impact on GDP growth\nalso has a positive impact on inflation. The wage equation is an example, where a positive\nshock temporarily leads to higher GDP growth via higher demand, but also to higher prices\nvia the production cost channel. With the approach chosen, such an equation would cause\npositively skewed inflation. However, one can expect the shocks to the price equations to\ndominate the skewness of inflation.\nChart 8: Fan charts for growth rates of real GDP and consumption deflator\n\u00ad asymmetric shocks\nfour-quarter growth rate of real GDP\nfour-quarter growth rate of the consumption deflator\nTable 6 displays moments of the stochastic forecasts with asymmetric shocks.\nAgain, we consider three types of growth rates. It turns out that the means of\nthe forecasts are not affected by the asymmetry of the shocks. Since the\nasymmetry of the shocks does not change their means, this result can be\ninterpreted as another indication for the almost linear behaviour of real GDP\nand consumption deflator growth in the Bundesbank model. The standard\ndeviations of consumer price inflation also remain unchanged with respect to\nthe simulation with symmetric shocks. Those of GDP growth, however, increase\nby 20 to 40 %. The increase is strongest in the first year and weakest in the\nthird. While the method used for generating asymmetric shocks leaves their\nstandard deviations unchanged, the asymmetric shocks are assumed to be\nindependent. In the case of real GDP growth, ignoring the interdependencies\nbetween the shocks apparently leads to higher volatility.\nTable 6: Moments of stochastic forecast with asymmetric shocks\nReal GDP\nConsumption Deflator\nFor four-quarter and quarterly growth rates, the value for a specific year is\ncalculated as the average quarterly moment observed in that year\nThe skewness of the variables under study clearly differs from zero. While the\nskewness of real GDP growth is positive, consumer price inflation is negatively\nskewed. Evidently, the coefficients of skewness depend on the growth rates\nused. Annual and four-quarter growth rates exhibit less skewness in absolute\nvalue than quarterly growth rates. The reason is that the former growth rates\nstrongly depend on the sum of four quarterly shocks, whereas quarterly growth\nrates are rather determined by the shocks of a specific quarter.12 For the same\nreason, the degree of asymmetry decreases over time. In the third year, due to\nthe dynamics of the model, shocks from all three years affect the simulation\nresults, whereas in the first year, only the shocks of the first year matter.\nIn general, the skewness of aggregates in large interdependent models can\nalways expected to be considerably smaller than the skewness of the shocks.\nThis is related to the following property of skewness\n12 The sum of several independent equally asymmetric shocks is less asymmetric than the\nindividual shocks, because the sum approaches normality as stated by the central limit\ntheorem.\n\u00a7 \u00b7\n\n\u00a8 \u00b8\n\u00a8 \u00b8\n\u00a6\nn\ni i\ns\ns z with s s z for i 1,2,...,n\nn\nwhere the zi\n's are i.i.d. random variables. For the purpose of illustration, it might\nbe helpful to consider an aggregate that is affected by the sum of 80 i.i.d.\nshocks which is the number of asymmetric shocks used in the stochastic\nsimulation. The skewness of this aggregate would be about 9 times smaller in\nabsolute value than the skewness of the shocks.\nWhile the skewness of shocks with Z set to 0.3 equals 1.4, the skewness of\nGDP growth only equals 0.5 in the first year. Similarly, while the skewness of\nshocks with Z set to 0.7 equals \u00ad1.4, the skewness of consumer price inflation\nattains only \u00ad0.7 in the first year. These results indicate that a considerable\namount of asymmetry is indeed absorbed in the aggregation and propagation of\nthe shocks. However, given that the absolute skewness of the TPN distribution\nand of the SGN distribution, for example, cannot exceed 1 and 2, respectively,13\nthe coefficients of skewness observed in the first year can still be regarded as\npronounced at least in absolute terms.\nFor four-quarter and annual growth rates in the second and third year, the\nabsolute values of skewness appear relatively small given the large asymmetry\nof the shocks.\nIn order to inspect the nature of the asymmetries in detail, it is interesting to look\nat the distribution for a single forecast horizon. Consider the four-quarter growth\nrates of real GDP and consumer price inflation in 2007q1. With the asymmetric\nstochastic simulations, the former has a skewness of 0.24, and the latter of\n\u00ad0.24. One would thus expect the densities of both variables to look broadly like\nmirror images of each other in this case. With the symmetric simulations, both\ncoefficients of skewness equal 0.05.\nIn Chart 9, histograms containing the mentioned growth rates of 2007q1 in their\nstandardized form, i.e. after mean subtractions and division by their standard\ndeviations, are displayed. The upper panels contain one histogram for the\nsimulation with asymmetric shocks and one histogram for the simulation with\nsymmetric shocks. The lower panels contain the same data as the upper\npanels, but here one histogram contains only the growth rates of GDP and the\nother only the growth rates of the consumption deflator.\nThe histogram for the simulation with asymmetric shocks, shown in the upper\nleft panel, shows that the upward skewed growth rate of GDP has relatively few\nmoderately positive and extremely negative observations, but relatively many\nmoderately negative and extremely positive observations. For the consumption\ndeflator, indeed a mirror image emerges. The histogram in the upper right\npanel, displaying the results of the simulation with symmetric shocks, does not\nreveal obvious differences between both variables.\nfour-quarter growth rates with asymmetric shocks\nreal GDP\nconsumption deflator\nfour-quarter growth rates with symmetric shocks\nreal GDP\nconsumption deflator\nstandardized four-quarter real GDP growth\nsymmetric shocks\nasymmetric shocks\nstandardized four-quarter consumption deflator growth\nsymmetric shocks\nasymmetric shocks\nTurning to the lower left panel for the comparison of the real GDP growth rates\nin the symmetric and asymmetric case, it is striking that differences between\nboth cases seem to be very small. In the asymmetric case, slightly more\nextremely positive and moderately negative values and slightly less extremely\nnegative and moderately positive values appear to be observed. In contrast to\nthat, for consumer price inflation the differences between the asymmetric and\nthe symmetric case are much larger, especially for moderately positive or\nnegative observations. This might be explained by the fact that the skewness of\nreal GDP growth in the asymmetric case increases only by about 0.2 with\nrespect to the symmetric case, whereas the skewness of consumer price\ninflation decreases by about 0.3.\nIn any case, it seems fair to say that the strong asymmetries of the shocks do\nnot yield strongly asymmetric four-quarter growth rates in the fifth quarter after\nthe beginning of the forecast. Since in subsequent periods, asymmetries of the\nfour-quarter growth rates are generally even less pronounced, it can be\nconcluded that when focusing on four-quarter growth rates of real GDP and the\nconsumption deflator, asymmetries are of minor importance in the medium to\nlong term, even if shocks are strongly asymmetric. The interdependent structure\nand transmission mechanisms of the model appear to level out asymmetries to\na large extent.\n5. Conclusions\nIn this work, we have discussed a parametric and a non-parametric\nmethod to quantify risk and uncertainty in macroeconomic forecasts, mainly\nfocussing on risk quantification. Both methods can be applied such that the\nincorporation of asymmetric risk does not affect the mean and variance of the\ninput variables.\nThe parametric method is based on a class of asymmetrically weighted normal\ndistributions. It was shown how this class relates to other asymmetric\ndistributions and how to consistently aggregate the risks and uncertainty of\ninput factors with asymmetrically weighted normal distributions in a linear\nmodel. The non-parametric method presented also relies on asymmetric\nweights but uses the bootstrap procedure to generate forecast intervals. Both\napproaches are closely related and give identical input factors if the model's\nresiduals are normally distributed. If, in addition, the model's residuals are\nindependent and the model is linear, both approaches yield identical uncertainty\nand risk assessments.\nThe asymmetric bootstrap is used to generate stochastic forecasts with the\nstructural macroeconometric model of the Bundesbank for Germany. It turns out\nthat asymmetries matter for real GDP growth and consumer price inflation\nmainly in the short run. In the short run or with quarterly growth rates,\nasymmetries of real GDP growth and consumer price inflation can be rather\npronounced if shocks are strongly asymmetric. However, the propagation\nmechanisms of the model absorb a substantial share of the shocks'\nasymmetries, so that the endogenous variables considered are far less\nasymmetric than the shocks. In the medium to long run, asymmetries tend to be\nsmoothed out at least if four-quarter and annual growth rates are considered.\nReferences\nAzzalini, A.

The question now is how\nto construct J1\n, so that \nz and \nz also have a covariance equal to\n).\nIn order to achieve this, consider the following table containing joint probabilities\nand the unconditional probabilities of the indicator functions J1\n.\n= 0 uncond. prob.\nuncond. prob. Z1\nFor example, the joint probability of J1\n+D. The\nunconditional probabilities are independent of the parameter D.\nFrom this setup, it follows that the covariance of \nz and \nz , denoted as\nCov( \nz , \nz ) is given by\n   \n\u00aa \u00ba\nD  \u00ac \u00bc\nZ  Z  Z  Z\nE z z\nCov z ,z\n.\nGiven a joint distribution of z1\nand probabilities Z1\n, one can thus\ntry to set D in such a way that Cov( \nz , \nz ) equals Cov(z1\n).\nIn order to inspect under which conditions this approach works, it is helpful to\nequal to Z2\nand to use a bivariate standard normal distribution with\ncorrelation coefficient U for z1\n. Since the standard deviations of z1\nequal 1, the correlation is equal to the covariance. Chart A shows the joint\nprobabilities of J1\nlatter is identical to the joint probability of J1\n.\nThe chart also displays the value of D following from (A.1). Values are shown for\nU = 0.5 in the left chart and for U = \u00ad0.5 in the right chart; Z denotes the value of\n.\nChart A: Joint probabilities and D\nEvidently, there is no problem to replicate the correlation of z1\nif U equals\n0.5. D must simply be set to values between 0 and 0.2, depending on the value\nof Z. However, if z1\nare negatively correlated, only for certain values of Z\nthe correlation of z1\ncan be replicated for \nz and \nz . For Z smaller than\n0.4 or larger than 0.6, the joint probabilities of J1\n= 0 implied by the value of D become negative. Experimenting with other\nvalues of U leads to the conclusion that the more negatively z1\nare\ncorrelated, the closer Z has to be to 0.5 in order to be able to replicate this\nnegative correlation with \nz and \nare allowed to differ from each\nother and z1\nare positively correlated, this can lead to the same problem,\nespecially if the correlation of z1\nas well as the difference between Z1\nare large.\nThe following Discussion Papers have been published since 2006:\nSeries 1: Economic Studies\novernight rate, the ECB's policy rate and the Dieter Nautz\nterm spread Christian J.
