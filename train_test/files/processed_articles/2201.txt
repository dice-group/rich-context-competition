The objective of work\nfocuses on determining hidden relevant patterns which\ncan't be processed by human capabilities all alone.\nCalifornia Drug and Alcohol treatment Assessment\n(CALDATA) of administrative type database can be\nrelevant study for the medical diagnosis in usage of\nalcohol and drugs for patients admitted and discharged\nduring the stay in hospital to discover knowledge for\nrecovery process.\nMethods\nWe utilized the observational study on cases registered to\nCalifornia Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs\n(ADP) to promote the initiative for increasing availability\nof abusive drug usage data for better drug recovery ser-\nvices among the California. The cases were diagnosed\nwith Minitab diagnostic tool to access the Casemix data-\nbases for retrieval of hidden information using data\nmining tools. The K means clustering having used with\ndendrogram to determine the possibility of existence of\npatient admitted and discharged on the accountability for\nThe classification of data is done among the educated\nand uneducated class for categorized race with correla-\ntion age at the time of admission to hospital. The analysis\nhas been performed on the patients admitted due to abu-\nsive substance usage and treatment provided during the\nstay in hospital and discharge status for final medical\ndiagnosis provided to patient those have suffered for long\nstay during hospitalization.\nResults\nThere has been a tremendous increase in the incidence\nrate of admission cases in age group 45-49 years. The\nprobability of over 40% cases acquiring maximum num-\nber of abusive substance exists in patients who have\nobtained post graduate education. The decline approxi-\nmately 2.3% of criminal activities after proper diagnosis\nto patients with high level of alcohol dependency among\nthe cases observed.\nThe total number of cases evaluated to study was\nwas 1,205 for each case diagnosed. The cases were diag-\nnosed on the basis of admission and discharge among\nthe prevalence of abusive substance usage. The subject\nwas classified for different subjects such as education,\nage, duration of stay in the hospital, estimated reduction\non criminal cases, decrement of hospital cases while the\ntreatment provided during the stay.\nWe calculated the overall usage of abusive substance\namong the categorized race at time of admission with\nreference to the age. The results shows white were\namong the categorized age group of 17 and under has\nthe maximum usage of abusive substance whereas native\nAmericans are the one those who have minimum con-\nsumption of abusive substance usage. In diagnosis of\nlongest time of stay during the treatment in hospital\nfrom day of admission to day of discharge due to abusive\nsubstance usage we have calculated the overall maximum\nwe have found that longest stay was observed for male/\nfemale aged below 17 years year and were correlated to\nmarital status that is unmarried. The clusters in the den-\ndrogram has been observed, where the largest cluster\nrepresents the maximum number of unmarried male/\nfemale patients diagnosed for highest abusive substance\nusage, whereas the second cluster represents the second\nhighest cases for divorced/ separated has the maximum\n* Correspondence: harleen.k@unu.edu\n1United Nations University International Institute of Global Health (UNU-IIGH),\nMalaysia\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2012 Kaur et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

The\nprobability of patients acquiring the abusive substance\ndepends on several factors such as education, age, marital\nstatus and several other factors related to patients. The\ndischarge status of these highly correlates to criminal\nactivity and discharge status of hospitalization cases\nwhich have reduced down tremendously after providing\ntreatment to admitted patients.\nAuthor details\n1United Nations University International Institute of Global Health (UNU-IIGH),\nMalaysia. 2Hamdard University, New Delhi, India.\nCite this article as: Kaur et al.: Data mining cluster analysis on the\ninfluence of health factors in Casemix data.
