    "abstract": "Abstract: When women are scarce in a population relative to men, they have greater\nbargaining power in romantic relationships and thus may be able to secure male\ncommitment at earlier ages. Male motivation for long-term relationship commitment may\nalso be higher, in conjunction with the motivation to secure a prospective partner before\nanother male retains her. However, men may also need to acquire greater social status and\nresources to be considered marriageable. This could increase the variance in male marital\nage, as well as the average male marital age. We calculated the Operational Sex Ratio, and\nmeans, medians, and standard deviations in marital ages for women and men for the 50\nlargest Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States with 2000 U.S Census data. As\npredicted, where women are scarce they marry earlier on average. However, there was no\nsignificant relationship with mean male marital ages. The variance in male marital age\nincreased with higher female scarcity, contrasting with a non-significant inverse trend for\nfemale marital age variation. These findings advance the understanding of the relationship\nbetween the OSR and marital patterns. We believe that these results are best accounted for\nby sex specific attributes of reproductive value and associated mate selection criteria,\ndemonstrating the power of an evolutionary framework for understanding human\nrelationships and demographic patterns.\n",

Women\ninvest physiologically in their offspring through gestation and lactation, and faced\nconsiderable mortality risk from childbirth before modern medicine and public health\nmeasures (Guyer, Freedman, Strobino, and Sondik, 2000). It is in a male's best\nreproductive interest to mate with highly fecund females. Female fertility declines with age\nsubstantially more so than male fertility, so men tend to prefer younger women as potential\nMen typically invest resources in their partner and offspring. Before fungible\ncurrencies, this investment took the form of the acquisition of food and shelter, as well as\nphysical care and protection. Thus, women prefer males with high socioeconomic status\n(SES), those with an abundance of acquired resources, as marriage partners (Buss, 1989;\nHopcroft, 2006; Otta et al., 1999). Both marriage and divorce rates in the United States\ndemonstrate the preference for high SES in male marital partners \u00ad male unemployment is\nnegatively correlated with both marriage rates and divorce rates (South and Lloyd, 1992a;\nSouth and Spitze, 1986). Previous research has also found a decrease in female non-marital\nfertility rates as male unemployment rates increase (South and Lloyd, 1992b).\nHigher SES is associated with older male ages because of the time necessary to\nacquire and accrue social status and resources \u00ad attributes related to mate preferences that\nhave been found in the marital practices of several cultures in different areas of the world\nand Huber (2007) found that the maximum number of offspring produced in a marriage\noccurred when the female was six years younger (as reported by Swedish males) and when\nthe male was four years older (as reported by Swedish females). Although these findings\nhave sparked a heated debate, especially over the sex-specific aspects of age and maximum\noffspring production (Bookstein, Fieder, and Huber, 2008; Boyko, 2008; Fieder, Huber,\ngeneral findings provide insight on the sex difference in marital age preference. Ultimately,\nmales prefer younger females, while females prefer older males, as optimal marital\npartners.\nOperational Sex Ratio\nOne of the most important factors influencing marriage rates is the Operational Sex\nRatio (OSR), originally defined as the number of sexually active males per 100 sexually\nreceptive females (Emlen and Oring, 1977). If the OSR is 100, the population is perfectly\nbalanced between the sexes. However, in environments where one sex outnumbers the\nother, the rarer sex has a reproductive advantage (Fisher, 1958). Members of the scarce sex\nare able to be more selective of their partners whereas the other sex faces greater\nintrasexual competition in securing a potential mate (Kvarnemo and Ahnesj\u00f6, 1996).\nWhen the OSR is male biased, available men outnumber available women and the\ngreater degree of female choice will increase the male social status and resource potential\nnecessary for securing female partners. A larger number of available males leads to an\nincrease in female marital rates (South and Lloyd, 1992a), and with greater bargaining\npower, women can secure mates with higher SES, higher fidelity, and a greater willingness\nFemale scarcity and marital age\nto invest in offspring (Pedersen, 1991; Pollet and Nettle, 2008). Thus, men with lower SES\nmay have an especially difficult time securing a marriage partner in male biased\nenvironments (Pollet and Nettle, 2008). However, a larger proportion of younger men are\nmarried in male biased populations compared to female biased populations, indicating a\ngreater willingness for earlier commitment to long-term relationships (Kruger and\nConversely, in an environment where the OSR is female biased, males tend to\npursue short-term mating as long as possible (Kruger and Schlemmer, 2009). The lower\nintrasexual competition associated with a relative shortage of male competitors allows them\nto decrease resource expenditures and avoid marital commitments. Males can continue\nshort-term mating strategies much longer than in a less female biased population. The\nfemale biased OSR has been linked to increased divorce rates, family conflict, out-of-\nPedersen, 1991; South and Lloyd, 1992a). In addition, women have greater difficulties in\nobtaining their first marriage (Lichter, Kephart, McLaughlin, and Landry, 1992).\nPrevious research on imbalanced OSRs has led to other conclusions regarding\nmarital patterns. For instance, South and Lloyd (1992a) found that male-biased\nenvironments were not only associated with a decrease in birth rates of illegitimate\nchildren, but also increases in both marriage and divorce rates. The increase in marriage\nrates, coupled with the decrease in illegitimacy rates, supports the notion that males are\nmore likely to exhibit long-term mating behaviors in male-biased environments. However,\nthe increase in divorce rates suggests that an abundance of available males may increase a\nfemale's marital opportunities, possibly leading to mate switching even after marriage.\nHypotheses\nIn male biased environments, women may encounter many more male suitors and\nmay also secure a male willing to commit to marriage at an earlier age than women in sex-\nbalanced or female biased environments. The increased power of female choice may\nincrease the average marital age of men, as the men may need to acquire higher social\nstatus and a greater extent of resources. Simultaneously, men may be more willing to enter\ninto committed relationships at earlier ages when women are scarce, and these divergent\ninfluences would lead to greater variance in male marital age. Because of this divergence,\nthe net effect of the OSR on average male marital age is likely to be weaker than that for\naverage female marital age. The truncated plausible range for male age in younger\nmarriages compared to the possible age range in older male marriages may lead to a net\nresult of older male marriages on average. The present study aims to further our\nunderstanding of human marital commitments in sex-biased populations by testing the\nfollowing hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1: In populations where women are relatively scarce, the average\nmarital age of women will be significantly lower than in sex-balanced or\nfemale biased populations.\nHypothesis 2: In populations where women are relatively scarce, the\nvariance in male marital age will be higher than in sex-balanced or female\nbiased populations.\nFemale scarcity and marital age\nHypothesis 3: In populations where women are relatively scarce, the average\nmarital age of men will be somewhat higher than in sex-balanced or female\nbiased populations.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe Operational Sex Ratio (OSR) in humans is operationally defined as the ratio of\nunmarried men to unmarried women, multiplied by 100. Thus, an OSR of 100 indicates a\nbalance between available men and available women, a male biased OSR of 110 indicates\n11 men available for every 10 women available. Using the SPSS 17.0 statistical package,\nwe calculated the OSR of people between the ages of 18 and 64 years, and the means,\nmedians, and standard deviations in marital ages for women and men for the 50 largest\nMetropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the United States with year 2000 Census data\n(U.S Census, 2001). The 18-64 years-old age cut-off was used in calculating the OSR\nbecause this is the age range from the legal definition of adulthood age until traditional\nretirement age in the USA. We used the top 50 MSAs because this sample has previously\ndemonstrated adequate statistical power for other similar demographic analyses (Kruger\nand Schlemmer, 2009). We examined the relationship between the OSR and marital age\nindicators both directly (Zero-Order) and controlling for median household income, median\nmale age, median female age, proportion Black or African American, and proportion\nHispanic or Latino in each MSA (Partial, see Table 1). We controlled for income and race\nbecause of their potential influence on marital behavior. South (1993) found that African-\nAmerican men and women tend to desire marriage less than Caucasian men and women,\nwhereas Hispanic men have an increased desire to marry compared to Caucasian men\n(though Hispanic women do not differ from Caucasian women). In addition, income may\nhave a strong influence on marital age because, as South and Lloyd (1992a) discussed,\nwhen males are unemployed they seem to be less likely to marry but also less likely to\ndivorce.\nResults\nThe OSR for individuals ages 18 to 64 ranged from 88 in Birmingham, AL and\nMemphis, TN, to 116 in Las Vegas, NV (M = 99, SD = 7). See Table 2 in the Appendix for\nthe descriptives of each MSA. As predicted, when women are scarce they marry earlier on\naverage (see Figure 1) and the variance in male marital age increased, however there was\nno significant relationship with male marital ages (see Figure 2), though the trend was for\nearlier marriages. See Table 1 for the correlations.\nFemale scarcity and marital age\nTable 1. Correlations between the OSR 18-64 and the mean male and female marital ages,\nmedian male and female marital ages, and variance in male marital age\nMarital Age\nMale Female\n* Significant at the p < .01 level, ** Significant at the p < .001 level.\nFigure 1. Mean female marital age by MSA Operational Sex Ratio for ages 18-64\nFemale scarcity and marital age\nFigure 2. Mean male marital age by MSA Operational Sex Ratio for ages 18-64\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between an\nimbalanced Operational Sex Ratio (OSR) and marital ages. When the OSR becomes male\nbiased, females are presented with an abundance of male suitors, which enables greater\nselectivity (Pedersen, 1991; Pollet and Nettle, 2008). As predicted, male abundance was\nsignificantly correlated with earlier mean and median female marital ages. This is likely\ndue to a greater degree of female choice, higher male motivation for commitment to long-\nterm relationships, and motivation to prevent a prospective female partner from being lost\nto a competitor (Kvarnemo and Ahnesj\u00f6, 1996).\nFemale scarcity was also correlated with a greater divergence in male marital ages,\nsupporting our second prediction. Males who are able to secure marriages with females\nearlier in life may be more motivated to do so, yet other males need additional time to\ndisplay characteristics making them desirable as long-term mates. Thus, in male biased\npopulations, there will be both more men who are more similar to their wives in age, and\nmore men who are considerably older than their wives. This contrasts with a non-\nsignificant inverse trend for female marital age variation.\nWe did not find a significant relationship between female scarcity and average male\nmarital age. The trend suggests that the more men committing to marriages at earlier ages\noutweighs the longer durations of social status and resource accrual by men facing greater\nintrasexual competition and female selectivity. Our sample size may have been inadequate\nFemale scarcity and marital age\nto uncover weak net effects, and increasing the sample size may render this relationship\nstatistically significant.\nLimitations\nThe present study used 2000 U.S. Census data to calculate the OSR, mean and\nmedian male marital age, and mean and median female marital age. Census data do not\nindicate marital order, only whether an individual is married or not married. Because many\nmarriages in the U.S. end in divorce, it is possible that the marital ages calculated in this\nstudy may not fully reflect the mean and median age of first marriage. However, the pattern\nof effects found in this study holds when also controlling for both the proportion of men\nand proportion of women who are divorced.\nThe correlational methodology used in this study does not allow us to directly infer\na causal direction from the OSR to marital age. However, imbalanced OSRs in the\nmetropolitan areas of the USA are believed to be primarily due to economic migration\n(Gwin, 2007). In the Northeastern USA, women have moved from predominantly rural\nareas to cities for white collar office careers. Men have moved to cities in the Western USA\nfor technology-oriented careers (Gwin, 2007). These limitations open possibilities for\nfuture research to replicate our findings and strengthen understanding.\nConclusion and Future Implications\nThe implications of this study are immense in both their predictive power and\nrelation to current social issues. For example, recent studies document the massive\ndemographic imbalance of men and women in China, the world's largest national\npopulation. Because of the implementation of China's single-child law in 1979, combined\nwith the preference for male children and the progression of ultrasound technology\nenabling sex-specific abortions, the OSR in China is increasingly male biased (Ding and\noverall OSR of 119, some areas are reporting an OSR as high as 130. These researchers\nproject that by the year 2020 there will be 24 million more men than women in China, and\nthat if these men do not get married by age 40, they will stand a minimal chance of ever\ngetting married, will have fewer resources, and will be reliant on social security in old age\nAs previous studies have indicated, women in China will become increasingly\nselective of their mates and men will need to commit to long-term relationships whenever\npossible to secure and retain a partner (Pedersen, 1991; Pollet and Nettle, 2008). Our\nresults predict that in China (and anywhere else with a male biased population), women\nwill marry younger and male marital ages will stratify. Overall, our study demonstrates the\nvalue of an evolutionary theoretical framework for predicting and understanding human\nrelationships and demographic patterns.\nReferences\nBarber, N. (2000).
