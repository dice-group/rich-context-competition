To see whether three dimensions of religion (private religious practices, religious coping, and belief in the\nafterlife) buffer the effect of the death of a significant other on change in self-reported hypertension over time.\nMethods. Interviews were conducted with a nationally representative sample of people aged 60 and older in Japan at\nries of questions about their religious beliefs and practices, whether a family member or close friend had died in the past\nyear, and whether they had hypertension.\nResults. The data suggest that older adults in Japan who experienced the death of a loved one but who believed in a\ngood afterlife were less likely to report they had hypertension at the follow-up interview than elderly people in Japan\nwho lost a close other but did not believe in a good afterlife.\nDiscussion. The results suggest how one overlooked dimension of religion (i.e., religious beliefs) may bolster the\nhealth of older people in the face of adversity.\nconvincing body of research has suggested that older\npeople who are religious tend to enjoy better health\nthan elderly people who are less religious (Koenig, 1999;\nKoenig, McCullough, & Larson, 2001). The relationship\nbetween these constructs appears to hold for an impressive\narray of outcomes, including global measures of self-rated\nhealth, functional disability, hypertension, heart disease,\ncancer, and mortality (see Koenig et al., 2001, for a compre-\nhensive review of this literature).\nA key task facing researchers is to explain why religion\nmay exert a salubrious effect on the health of older people.\nAlthough a number of causal factors are likely to be in-\nvolved, one line of reasoning that appears to be especially\npromising is pursued in this study. In particular, as Ellison\nand Levin (1998) pointed out, religion may exert a benefi-\ncial effect on health because it helps elderly people cope\nwith the deleterious effects of stressful life events. Even\nthough several investigators have already explored the in-\nterface between religion, stress, and health in late life (e.g.,\nKrause, 1998), we hope to contribute to the literature in\nthree potentially important ways.\nFirst, we explore the relationships among religion, stress,\nand health in a diverse cultural setting--Japan. As Musick,\nTraphagan, Koenig, and Larson (2000) argued, the wide\nmajority of studies on religion and health have focused on\nolder Americans with Judeo-Christian religious orienta-\ntions. Consequently, these investigators have argued that a\ntop priority be placed on conducting research in culturally\ndiverse settings so researchers can learn more about the ro-\nbustness of the relationship between religion and health.\nMore specifically, this type of work will help researchers\nfigure out whether the potentially salubrious effects of reli-\ngion are restricted to the Judeo-Christian religions of the\nWest, or whether there is something common to faiths in all\ncultural settings that may benefit health.\nSecond, Ellison and Levin (1998) argued that if further\nheadway is to be made in the study of religion and health, in-\nvestigators must use data that have been gathered prospec-\ntively. We aimed to contribute to the knowledge base by ana-\nlyzing data that came from a nationally representative sample\nof older people in Japan who were interviewed at more than\none point in time. Doing so allowed us to observe the effects\nof religion on change in health over time. Throughout, we fo-\ncus on one particular chronic illness, hypertension.\nThird, far too many epidemiologic studies have examined\na limited range of religion measures. In fact, many have fo-\ncused solely on the frequency of church attendance (e.g.,\nStrawbridge, Cohen, Shema, & Kaplan, 1997). Although\nthis work has produced a number of valuable insights, many\ninvestigators do not take advantage of the fact that religion\nis a complex multidimensional phenomenon. If further ad-\nvances are to be made in the field, researchers must examine\nthe effects of multiple facets of religion on health within a\nmultivariate framework. Consistent with this view, three\ndimensions of religion are examined in the analyses that\nfollow: private religious practices, religious coping, and\nreligious beliefs. This measurement strategy follows the\nguidelines specified by Ellison and Levin (1998), who\nmaintained that researchers should investigate the func-\ntional aspects of religious involvement (e.g., coping) in con-\njunction with behavioral markers of religion (e.g., private\nreligious practices).\nA\nIn the discussion that follows, we begin by developing\nthe theoretical underpinnings of this study. The sample and\nsurvey measures are introduced after this. Finally, the re-\nsults are presented and discussed.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no published em-\npirical research on the relationships among religion, stress,\nand physical health among older adults in Japan. Conse-\nquently, we initially turn to studies that were conducted in\nthe West to frame the study hypotheses. This is accom-\nplished by first examining research on the relationship be-\ntween religion and hypertension. Following this, we expand\nthe scope of inquiry by reviewing research on religion and\nstress. Finally, select studies on religion in Japan are re-\nviewed in an effort to embed the emerging hypotheses in a\nproper cultural context.\nReligion and Hypertension\nIn their comprehensive review of the literature, Levin and\nVanderpool (1989) made a compelling case for why reli-\ngion may be associated with hypertension. In fact, they pro-\nvided 12 hypotheses that help explain why these constructs\nmay be related. This important conceptual work, coupled\nwith a surprisingly large number of empirical studies that\nhave already appeared in this area, led Koenig and his col-\nof religion are going to be found anywhere, they will be\nfound in hypertension studies.\"\nEven though Levin and Vanderpool (1989) developed an\nimpressive array of hypotheses to explain the relationship\nbetween religion and hypertension, they did not devote suf-\nficient attention to the potentially significant role of stress.\nThis is important because researchers working outside the\ncontext of religion have been studying the relationship be-\ntween stress and hypertension since 1932 (see Gerin et al.,\n2000, for a review of this research). Although far from con-\nclusive, this secular literature has indicated that people who\nare exposed to stressful experiences may be at risk for de-\nveloping hypertension. Unfortunately, as Gerin and his as-\nsociates pointed out, there is little consensus on the precise\nphysiological mechanisms linking stress and hypertension,\nbut most explanations focus on cardiovascular reactivity\n(e.g., increased heart rate and arterial wall pressure follow-\ning exposure to stress; Gerin et al., 2000). Nevertheless,\nGerin and his colleagues went on to identify an intriguing\npossibility that has not been examined frequently in the lit-\nerature. In particular, they argued that instead of being due\nsolely to cardiovascular reactivity per se, the key risk factor\nmay involve the person's ability to return to prestress rest-\ning levels following a period of physiological hyperarousal.\nExtensive research by Benson (1996) on the relaxation\nresponse is especially helpful for shedding light on how\nsome people are able to return to prestress levels of cardio-\nvascular functioning. Benson defined the relaxation re-\nsponse as a physiological state in which \"blood pressure is\nlowered and heart rate, breathing, and metabolic rate are de-\ncreased\" (p. 17). Two key findings from Benson's research\nare especially helpful for studies attempting to examine\nstress, religion, and hypertension. First, Benson argued that\nreligious beliefs and rituals are among the most important\nfactors eliciting the relaxation response. Second, Benson re-\nviewed research showing that hypertensive patients who\nwere able to cultivate the relaxation response subsequently\nexperienced a decrease in blood pressure. Given these pro-\nvocative possibilities, we need to learn more about how reli-\ngion may foster the relaxation response in the face of adver-\nsity.\nReligion and Stress\nThere are several ways in which religion may help pro-\nmote the relaxation response when older people are con-\nfronted by stressful life events. However, to gain a better\nunderstanding of how this may happen, it is important to\nfirst examine a general issue that must be addressed when\nstudying stressful life events. There are two broad ap-\nproaches to the study of stress. First, some investigators rely\non long checklists that assess exposure to a diverse array of\nlife events. Here, the goal is to carefully enumerate all life\nevents a person has experienced during a given time period.\nThis approach is important because it rests on the plausible\nassumption that one cannot understand the impact of any\none event without also examining other stressors that were\npresent at the same time. In essence, this perspective sug-\ngests that it is the cumulative effects of stress that matter\nmost. The second approach to studying life stressors in-\nvolves focusing on single life events. Studying events indi-\nvidually is important because this strategy allows investiga-\ntors to probe more deeply into the rich psychosocial context\nsurrounding a particular stressor, thereby arriving at a more\ncomplete understanding of how specific coping resources,\nlike religion, operate.\nIn the analyses that follow, we focus on a single life\nevent, the death of a loved one. There are two reasons why\nit is important to examine this particular type of stress. The\nfirst has to do with Japanese culture. As Doi (1973) and\nmany others have pointed out, Japan is a collectivist society.\nIn this tightly integrated culture, people are highly depen-\ndent on each other, and individual identities are overshad-\nowed by the group. Individual success arises from group\nsuccess, just as individual failure is viewed as a failure of\nthe group. In fact, Doi coined the term amae to underscore\nthe high level of interdependence among people in Japan. If\nindividual lives are fused so tightly, it follows that the loss\nof a close other may be especially challenging for older peo-\nple in Japan. Evidence of this may be found in a recent\nstudy by Brannigan (1998). His research revealed that the\ndeath of a close other in Japan \"constitutes the death of a\nThe second reason for focusing on the death of a loved\none may be found in a series of empirical and theoretical pa-\npers suggesting that religion may be especially useful for\ncoping with the effects of bereavement. Evidence for this\nmay be found in the work of Hood, Spilka, Hunsberger, and\nized faith . . . plays many roles in life, but the issue of death\nlies at its core.\" Although Hood and colleagues explored a\nnumber of ways that death figures prominently in religion,\nthey noted that it may be especially helpful for coping with\nthe loss of a loved one. Evidence of this may be found in re-\nsearch by Mattlin, Wethington, and Kessler (1990). These\ninvestigators examined whether a wide range of coping re-\nsponses reduces the deleterious effects of six different types\nof stressful events on psychological well-being. Their find-\nings revealed that religion is especially useful for helping\npeople cope with the death of a loved one, but it is less ef-\nfective for dealing with other types of stressors (e.g., inter-\npersonal difficulties).\nIf religion is a complex multidimensional phenomenon,\nthen it may help people deal with grief and bereavement in\nmore than one way. As noted earlier, three dimensions of\nreligion are examined in this study: private religious prac-\ntices, religious coping, and religious beliefs. In the discus-\nsion that follows, we speculate on how each dimension may\noffset the noxious effects of losing a significant other. In the\nprocess, we show how each facet of religion may elicit the\nA number of specific behaviors are typically included in\nmeasures of private religious practices, including prayers\noffered at home when one is alone and the reading of sacred\nscriptures. Also, in Japan, people typically make offerings\nof water and food to deceased ancestors (Klass, 1996). As\nBenson (1996) argued, these regularly occurring ritual be-\nhaviors help elicit the relaxation response by providing a\ntemporary respite from troubling thoughts and concerns.\nMoreover, as Levin and Vanderpool (1989) pointed out, the\nregular practice of religious rituals may also lower the risk\nof hypertension by easing a sense of dread, reducing anxi-\nety, allaying fears, and moderating loneliness. The latter\nfactor (i.e., moderating loneliness) may be especially rele-\nvant when a loved one has died.\nThe rationale developed up to this point leads to the first\nhypothesis to be evaluated in this study:\n: Compared with older adults who do not engage in\nprivate religious practices, older adults who regularly\nperform private religious rituals will be less likely to\ndevelop hypertension when a loved one dies.\nA vast literature has also suggested that one of the pri-\nmary functions of religion is to provide people with an ex-\nplicit set of coping responses that helps reduce or offset the\npotentially deleterious effects of stress on health and well-\nbeing (Pargament, 1997). Although religious coping is a\ncomplex multidimensional domain in its own right, mea-\nsures of this facet of religion typically focus on things like\noffering prayers for guidance, direction, and understanding\n(i.e., meaning), as well as pleas for the resolution of a diffi-\ncult situation. As Pargament pointed out, religious coping is\nimportant for a number of reasons. However, one is espe-\ncially important for the purposes of this study. In particular,\nhe noted that those who engage in religious coping re-\nsponses often find a sense of comfort, solace, and relief.\nThese potential important benefits are closely akin to the\nkey characteristics of Benson's (1996) relaxation response.\nConsistent with this literature, the analyses presented below\nalso empirically evaluate the following hypothesis:\n: Older adults in Japan who turn to religious cop-\ning responses when a significant other dies will be\nless likely to develop hypertension than those who do\nnot rely on religious coping responses.\nReligious beliefs are obviously an integral part of any\nfaith, yet the study of this conceptual domain remains elu-\nsive because the number of specific religious beliefs seems\nalmost limitless. However, this daunting task is simplified\nin studies that focus on a particular type of life event be-\ncause researchers can examine only those beliefs that per-\ntain to the particular stressor at hand. We capitalize on this\nstrategy below by focusing on one specific type of religious\nbelief that is especially relevant for studies of bereavement,\nbelief in the afterlife. More specifically, we evaluate the po-\ntentially salubrious effects of believing that those who die\ngo on to live in another place that is better than the present\nlife.\nTo see why belief in the afterlife may play a key role in\nreducing the noxious effects of bereavement, it is important\nto examine the psychosocial challenges that arise when a\nloved one dies. Three issues are especially important in this\nrespect. First, existing ties with the deceased are clearly sev-\nered. As a result, those who were once an important source\nof social support are no longer directly accessible. Believing\nthere is life after death holds out the prospects of seeing the\ndeceased again and speaks to the likelihood of resuming\nclose ties with them following one's own death. Second, for\nmany death is an uncertain outcome. No one has direct\nknowledge about whether there is life after death. More-\nover, even if there is an afterlife, no one knows for certain\nwhat it is like. Consequently, when a significant other dies,\nthose who are left behind may worry about what has hap-\npened to someone they love. More specifically, deep con-\ncerns may arise about whether the deceased continue to ex-\nist at all and, if they do, whether they are safe, cared for, and\nhappy. Finally, the death of a significant other clearly brings\nthoughts of one's own mortality to the foreground (Wuth-\nnow, Christiano, & Kuzlowski, 1980). Believing there is no\nlife after death, or believing that the deceased may face a\nprecarious existence in the next life, may be a source of sig-\nnificant distress for those who remain behind.\nGiven these challenges, Marrone (1999) argued that one\nof the most important tasks in dealing with the loss of a\nloved one involves a cognitive restructuring of the bereaved\nperson's worldview. In particular, the bereaved individual\nmust make sense of what happened and assimilate the death\nof a close other into a cognitive schemata that helps them\nget past the uncertainties of death and function effectively\nin the present life. Marrone maintained that some people are\nable to meet this challenge by relying on specific religious\nbeliefs. In particular, he suggested that \"the belief in an af-\nterlife may be the most common religion-based assimilation\nstrategy observed in individuals dealing with loss\" (p. 500).\nIn fact, several empirical studies have shown that those who\nbelieve in the afterlife recover more quickly (i.e., derive a\nbetter sense of well-being) from the death of a loved one\nthan those who do not believe in life after death (Smith,\nBenson (1996) argued that worry is one of the primary\nfactors that promotes physiological hyperarousal. More-\nover, he suggested that factors eliciting the relaxation re-\nsponse counteract these effects directly by helping people\ndispel their concerns. Cast within the context of bereave-\nment, these observations suggest that belief in the afterlife\nmay allay worries and concerns about the departed, and the\nresulting comfort and solace afforded by these beliefs may\nultimately lower the risk of developing hypertension. Stated\nmore formally, the third, and final, hypothesis to be exam-\nined in this study states the following:\n: Older adults who believe in the afterlife will be\nless likely to develop hypertension following the\ndeath of a loved one than those who do not believe in\nlife after death.\nReligion in Japan\nAt first glance, religion in Japan may seem puzzling to\nthose with a Judeo-Christian religious orientation. More\nspecifically, it is difficult to identify the particular faith of\nJapanese people because most belong to more than one reli-\ngion. As Miller (1992) pointed out, the majority of people in\nJapan practice a mixture of Shinto and Buddhism. This is\nreflected in data provided by the Japan Agency for Cultural\nAffairs, who reported that 93% of Japanese say they are\nShinto, and 74% also indicate they practice Buddhism (Ka-\nappear that straddling two faiths would create difficulty in\ndaily life, it is not a major problem because most people use\nthe two religions for different purposes that reflect differ-\nences in the underlying worldviews of these faiths. More\nspecifically, themes of birth and life are more evident in\nShinto, whereas Buddhism is more concerned with suffer-\ning and issues related to death. Consequently, it is not un-\nusual to have a child \"confirmed\" by a Shinto priest, yet\nhave a relative buried by a Buddhist priest (Miller, 1995).\nReligion in Japan also differs significantly from Judeo-\nChristian orientations because regular institutionalized par-\nticipation in formal worship services is not as deeply in-\ngrained as regular Sunday worship is in the United States\n(Musick et al., 2000). Instead, a good deal of worship in Ja-\npan takes place in the home, where people often maintain\neither a Buddhist altar (butsudan) or a Shinto god shelf (ka-\nmidana). It is especially important for the purposes of this\nstudy to note that the primary function of the butsudan is\nveneration of the dead.\nAlthough there are differences between Japanese reli-\ngions and those of the West (e.g., Christianity and Judaism),\nthere are also similarities. For example, research has indi-\ncated that, as in the West, older people in Japan tend to be\nmore religious than their younger counterparts. Evidence of\nthis may be found in research reviewed by Swyngedouw\nlieve in Shinto deities and only 31% in this age group be-\nlieve in Buddhist deities. But for age 70, these figures rise to\n65% and 48%, respectively. This suggests that if religion\nimproves health in Japan, then these effects should be espe-\ncially evident among older people in this culture.\nAs Musick and colleagues (2000) pointed out, Japanese\nreligious behavior tends to be focused on specific goals,\nsuch as improvement in health or success in academic en-\ntrance examinations. Viewed more broadly, this instrumen-\ntal religious orientation is geared specifically toward find-\ning relief from stress. This is captured succinctly in a\nJapanese phrase that is identified by Musick and his col-\nleagues: Kurushii toki no kamidanomi, which means \"turn\nto the gods in time of distress.\"\nAlthough older people in Japan may be inclined to turn to\nreligion during stressful times, there is evidence that they\nmay be especially likely to do so when a significant other\ndies. In fact, elaborate rituals that traditionally last 49 days\nare often performed when a loved one passes on (see Klass,\n1996, for a detailed discussion of these ancestor worship rit-\nuals). The purpose of these rituals is to convince the de-\nparted that they are dead and help ensure their entrance into\nthe Buddhist Pure Land (i.e., heaven). However, if the pre-\nscribed rituals are not performed, Klass reported the dead\nwill be turned into harmful spirits, who cause bad things to\nhappen in the world of the living.\nIf religion is used to deal with adversity in Japan, and a\ngood deal of religious ritual focuses on care for the dead,\nthen it follows that religion may help older people in Japan\navoid the deleterious health effects associated with bereave-\nment. However, as relatively little is known about religion,\nstress, and health in Japan, it is difficult to determine\nwhether religion is an effective stress buffer and, if it is,\nhow these health-protective effects may arise. The three hy-\npotheses derived above were designed to take a modest first\nstep toward resolving this important issue.\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe data for this study come from the 1996 (Wave 4) and\n1999 (Wave 5) rounds of interviews in the National Survey\nof the Japanese Elderly. This ongoing project is conducted\njointly by the University of Michigan and the Tokyo Metro-\npolitan Institute of Gerontology. Prior waves of interviews\ninterviews were conducted face to face in the homes of the\nstudy participants. The survey was designed to create a\npanel data set for use in cross-cultural analyses of aging in\nJapan and the United States (see Liang, Borawski-Clark,\n898) was added to the respondents who participated in ear-\nlier waves of interviews (n  1,549). This supplemental\nsurvey involved a self-weighted, two-stage probability sam-\nple of Japanese elders aged 60 and older. The sampling de-\nsign included 192 primary sampling units stratified by geo-\ngraphical region and city size. Altogether, 2,447 Wave 4\ninterviews were completed successfully. Of this group, a to-\nfully at Wave 5.\nThe analyses presented below focus solely on the Wave 4\nand Wave 5 interviews because questions on religion were\nadministered for the first time in the Wave 4 survey. As\nnoted earlier, including the Wave 5 data allows us to exam-\nine the effects of religion at Wave 4 on change in the proba-\nbility of having hypertension at Wave 5.\nAfter taking item nonresponse into account with listwise\ndeletion of missing data, we based the analyses presented\nbelow on the responses of 1,723 Japanese elders. The aver-\nage age of the people in this group at Wave 4 was 69.17\nyears (SD  6.76 years). Approximately 43% of the study\nparticipants were men. Moreover, 71% were married at the\ntime of the Wave 4 survey. Finally, the respondents in this\ngroup reported that they had completed an average of 9.62\nyears of schooling (SD  2.59 years).\nMeasures\nTable 1 contains the measures of the main study con-\nstructs examined in this study. Information on the scoring\nprocedures for these indicators is provided in the table's\nfootnotes.\nBefore reviewing the study measures, it is important to\nbriefly discuss procedures that were used to address a com-\nmon problem in cross-cultural research. Because the key\nstudy measures were initially drafted in the United States,\nsteps were be taken to ensure they were translated properly\ninto Japanese and that they would be understood in the man-\nner intended by the research team. As described elsewhere,\nwe used standard back-translation methods (Marsella, 1987),\na rigorous pilot-testing strategy, and sophisticated confirma-\ntory factor analyses to address this issue (see Krause, Liang,\nHypertension.--Hypertension was assessed through self-\nreport in the Waves 4 and 5 surveys. The same question was\nused at both interviews. Preliminary analyses revealed that\n28% of respondents indicated they had hypertension at\nWave 4, and 32% said they had this chronic illness at Wave\n5. Perhaps more important, 191 respondents who said they\ndid not have hypertension at Wave 4 indicated they had hy-\npertension when they were reinterviewed at Wave 5.\nThe fact that we relied on self-reports of hypertension\nraises some concern about the accuracy of the data. There\nare two ways to address this issue. First, the Japanese gov-\nernment provides health insurance coverage to its entire\npopulation. Consequently, it is not surprising to find that in\ncompared with only 6 visits per year by people in the United\nStates (Graig, 1999). This is important because having easy\naccess to health care, and making a large number of yearly\nvisits to a health care provider, increases the odds that hy-\npertension will be detected and treated. If this is true, then\nthere is a good chance older people in Japan would know\nwhether they have hypertension. The second reason why we\nhave faith in these self-reports of hypertension may be\nfound in a recent study by the Japanese Health Services Bu-\nreau, Ministry of Health and Welfare (1997). Part of the\nprotocol for this study involved directly measuring the\nblood pressure of a representative nationwide survey of\nolder people in Japan. Subsequent analysis of these data re-\nvealed that 32% of men 70 years of age and older had hy-\npertension, whereas 32% of the women in this age group\nhad hypertension (Health Services Bureau, Ministry of\nHealth & Welfare, 1997). These figures are close to those\nobtained in our Wave 4 (28%) and (especially) our Wave 5\nDeath of a loved one.--The respondents in our study\nwere also asked if a family member or (separately) a close\nTable 1.

A measure consisting of a simple\ncount of deaths among family and close friends was used in\nthe analyses presented.\nPrivate religious practices.--As shown in Table 1, pri-\nvate religious practices were assessed at Wave 4 with three\nitems that asked whether respondents offered prayers at\nhome, read sacred scriptures, and watched or listened to re-\nligious programs on TV or the radio. A high score on these\nitems denotes greater involvement in religion. The internal\nconsistency reliability estimate for this brief index was .572.\nReligious coping.--Religious coping was also evaluated\nat Wave 4 with three indicators that assessed whether re-\nspondents turned to a deity during difficult times, whether\nthey consulted one of the gods when adversity arose, and\nwhether they asked a deity to help them overcome the stres-\nsors they faced. A high score on this brief composite mea-\nsure represents greater use of these religious coping re-\nsponses. The reliability estimate for this index is .857.\nBelief in the afterlife.--As shown in Table 1, two ques-\ntions were administered in the Wave 4 interviews to see if\nstudy participants believed in life after death. However, these\nindicators captured more than just beliefs in the afterlife, per\nse. In particular, they also gauged whether a respondent be-\nlieved the deceased is going to a better place. Consistent\nwith the theoretical rationale provided earlier, believing that\na deceased significant other is going on to a better life may\nhelp allay concerns about their safety and well-being,\nthereby providing an important prerequisite for eliciting the\nrelaxation response. Preliminary analyses revealed that the\ncorrelation between the two afterlife items was .433 (p \nBody mass index.--To place greater faith in the main\nstudy findings, controls were included in the analyses for a\nnumber of well-known risk factors for hypertension. The first\nwas body mass index (BMI). As a number of investigators\nhave pointed out, high BMI values are associated with a\ngreater risk of developing hypertension (Lu, Tang, Wu,\nYang, & Chang, 2000). BMI ratios were calculated from\nstudy participants' self-reported height and weight at Wave 4.\nSmoking.--Research has also indicated that people who\nsmoke are more likely to develop hypertension than individ-\nuals who do not smoke (Jackson, Jatulis, & Fortman, 1992).\nTo control for this risk factor, a simple binary variable was\ncreated from self-reported smoking at Wave 4. Approxi-\nmately 22% of the study participants indicated they smoked\nat that time.\nPhysical exercise.--A number of studies have suggested\nthat engaging in regular light physical exercise helps to re-\nduce the risk of developing hypertension (Nothwehr, Elmer,\n& Hannan, 1994). Three questions were administered at the\nWave 4 interviews to determine how often study partici-\npants did yard work, engaged in regular physical exercise or\nsports, and walked at least 10 city blocks. A high score on\nthis measure meant a respondent was more physically ac-\ntive.\nAlcohol intake.--Finally, there is some evidence that\nhigh consumption of alcoholic beverages is associated with\nan elevated risk of developing hypertension (Rabbia et al.,\n1995). Information on alcohol consumption was assessed at\nthe Wave 4 survey by asking respondents how often they\nhad drunk alcoholic beverages in the past month and how\nmuch they typically drank on days they consumed alcohol.\nThese data were used to compute an overall estimate of al-\ncohol consumption that is expressed in terms of a traditional\nJapanese go. A go is a container for holding sake. To get a\nbetter sense of the size of a go, it is helpful to point out that\nDemographic control measures.--The relationship be-\ntween religion, death of a loved one, and changes in self-\nreported hypertension was evaluated after the effects of the\nfollowing demographic variables were controlled for statis-\ntically: age (scored continuously in years), sex (1  male,\n0  female), marital status at Wave 4 (1  presently mar-\nried, 0  otherwise), and education (the total number of\nyears of completed schooling).\nData Analysis Strategy\nThe hypotheses developed for this study specify that reli-\ngion will reduce the deleterious effects of bereavement on\nchange in self-reported hypertension over time. Stated in\nmore technical terms, this perspective calls for a statistical\ninteraction between each dimension of religion (i.e., private\nreligious practices, religious coping, and belief in the after-\nlife) and death of a loved one on hypertension. The follow-\ning logistic regression equation was used to test for these ef-\nfects:\n\n) \n) \nci\nZi\nIn this equation, HTN4\ndenote hypertension at\nWaves 4 and 5, respectively; DEATH4\nis death of a loved\none at Wave 4; PRAC4\nrepresents private religious practices\nstands for religious coping at Wave 4;\nand AFTER4\nis belief in the afterlife at the Wave 4 inter-\nviews. Zi\ndenotes the control variables (i.e., BMI, smoking,\nalcohol consumption, exercise, age, sex, marital status, and\neducation). Finally, a is the intercept, whereas the bi\nand ci\nare logistic regression coefficients. Following the recom-\nmendations of Selvin (1991), all independent variables were\ndeviation scored (i.e., centered on their means) before Equa-\ntion 1 was solved.\nEquation 1 is estimated in a hierarchical fashion. The ad-\nditive effects of the independent variables are entered in the\nfirst step (i.e., HTN4\n,\nand Zi\n). Following this, tests for the statistical interaction\nbetween the religion measures and death of a loved one are\nperformed in Step 2 by entering the multiplicative or cross-\nproduct terms into the model (i.e., DEATH4\n,\n, and DEATH4\n). If the coeffi-\ncients associated with the multiplicative terms are statisti-\ncally significant, it is important to determine whether the in-\nteraction effects are in the hypothesized direction. We\naccomplished this by using the formula provided by Hos-\naction between death of a loved one and private religious\npractices illustrates how this formula was used. If Hypothe-\nsis 1 is correct, the effects of the death of a loved one on\nchanges in hypertension should become progressively\nweaker at higher levels of private religious practice. This ef-\nfect can be shown clearly by performing some hand calcula-\ntions that use the estimates derived from Equation 1. The\nformula used for these hand calculations is\nIn this equation, bDEATH4\nstands for the effects of death of a\nloved one on change in self-reported hypertension at select\nlevels of private religious practice. The estimates of b2\nand\ncome directly from Equation 1. Equation 2 is solved by\nsubstituting select values of private religious practices\n) into the formula. After this, additional formulas\nprovided by Hosmer and Lemeshow are used to compute\nstandard errors for the estimates (this permits the calcula-\ntion significance tests) as well as odds ratios for each of the\ncoefficients derived with Equation 2.\nSupplementary analyses.--We performed two additional\nsets of analyses that are designed to provide greater confi-\ndence in the findings. The first has to do with the causal lag.\nAs discussed in the previous section, the main analyses\ntested for the impact of religion and death of a loved one at\nWave 4 on change in self-reported hypertension at Wave 5.\nStated in more technical terms, this specification calls for a\nlagged effect of religion and bereavement on health. In our\nble that the effects of death of a loved one and religion on\nself-reported hypertension may appear in a much shorter pe-\nriod of time. Again, casting this issue in more technical\nterms, one might argue that there are contemporaneous ef-\nfects of religion and bereavement on hypertension. One way\nto address this issue is to look at the relationships among re-\nligion, death of a loved one, and hypertension using mea-\nsures that have all been gathered at the same point in time\n(i.e., at Wave 4). Consistent with this rationale, the first set\nof supplementary analyses involved estimating the relation-\nships among the Wave 4 waves of religion, bereavement,\nand health only.\nThe second set of supplementary analyses involves a po-\ntential problem with confounding. As discussed earlier, the\nwork of Marrone (1999) suggested that when a significant\nother dies, bereaved study participants face critical cogni-\ntive restructuring tasks that are geared toward altering their\nbelief systems so that the loss of a loved one can be inte-\ngrated into worldviews that guide daily behavior. Cast\nwithin the context of the present study, Marrone's (1999)\nobservations suggest that older people in Japan may alter\ntheir beliefs about the afterlife in an effort to convince\nthemselves that their departed loved ones still exist and that\nthey are well cared for. If this is true, then beliefs in the af-\nterlife may be correlated with the death of a loved one.\nHowever, if this correlation is sufficiently large, we may\nhave difficulty disentangling the impact of death of a loved\none on belief in the afterlife from the interaction between\ndeath of a loved one and belief in the afterlife on hyperten-\nsion. To evaluate the extent of this problem, the second set\nof supplementary analyses presented in the Results focuses\non the relationship between death of a loved one and belief\nin the afterlife at Wave 4. Ideally, it would have been nice to\nexamine the relationships among these constructs with lon-\ngitudinal data as well. Unfortunately, data on belief in the\nafterlife were gathered only at the Wave 4 survey.\nRESULTS\nThe findings from this study are presented below in three\nsections. The potential bias created by the loss of study par-\nticipants over time is evaluated first. Following this, tests of\nthe three main study hypotheses are presented in the second\nsection. Finally, results from the supplementary analyses\nare reviewed in the third section.\nEffects of Sample Attrition\nOwing to the supplemental sampling strategy that was\nimplemented at Wave 4, the data from this wave of inter-\nviews constitute a nationally representative sample of peo-\nple who are at least 60 years of age and living independently\nin Japan (i.e., those who do not live in nursing homes).\nHowever, some participants who were interviewed at Wave\n4 did not participate in the Wave 5 survey. The loss of par-\nticipants over time in panel studies may bias empirical find-\nings if sample attrition occurs nonrandomly. Although it is\ndifficult to determine the extent of the problem precisely,\nsome preliminary insight can be obtained by using select\ndata from the Wave 4 interviews to see if those who were\nlost to follow-up differed significantly from those who re-\nmained in the study (see Norris, 1987, for a detailed discus-\nsion of this approach). These analyses were performed in\nthe following manner. First, a binary outcome measure was\ncomputed by assigning a score of 1 to all participants who\nwere lost to follow-up at Wave 5 and a score of 0 to all who\nparticipated in the Wave 5 interviews. Then, using logistic\nregression, this binary outcome was regressed on the fol-\nlowing Wave 4 measures: hypertension, death of a loved\none, private religious practices, religious coping, belief in\nthe afterlife, BMI, smoking, physical exercise, alcohol con-\nsumption, age, sex, marital status, and education. If any of\nthe independent variables are related significantly to the bi-\nnary outcome, then it would be reasonable to assume that\nsample attrition did not occur in a random manner.\nThe sample attrition analyses revealed that the loss of\nparticipants over time did not take place in a random man-\nner. More specifically, the data suggest that, compared with\nolder adults who were reinterviewed successfully, elderly\npeople who did not participate in the Wave 5 survey were\nover, older adults who did not participate at Wave 5 were\nlikely to engage in private religious practices (  .077,\np  .01). However, significant differences failed to emerge\nwith respect to Wave 4 hypertension, marital status, smok-\ning, alcohol consumption, religious coping, belief in the af-\nterlife, and death of a loved one (a table containing the re-\nsults of these analyses is available from Neal Krause). Even\nso, the potential bias associated with nonrandom attrition\nshould be kept in mind as the findings from this study are\nreviewed.\n \nTable 2 contains the estimates derived from evaluating\nthe three main study hypotheses. The additive effects of the\nstudy measures on change in self-reported hypertension\nover time are provided in the left-hand portion of this table\n(see Model 1), and tests for the interaction between death of\nsignificant others and the religion measures are presented in\nthe right-hand side of this table (see Model 2). Three coeffi-\ncients are provided in each part of the table so that the ef-\nfects of the independent variables may be described more\nfully. In addition to the unstandardized logistic regression\ncoefficients (s) and odds ratios, Table 2 also contains stan-\ndardized logistic regression coefficients (s). Before turn-\ning to the substantive results, it is important to briefly dis-\ncuss why standardized estimates are important and how\nthey are computed.\nOne problem with logistic regression analysis is that it is\ndifficult to determine whether the impact of one indepen-\ndent variable is greater than that of another. Comparing\nodds ratios does not help because, as Selvin (1991) pointed\nout, these coefficients are influenced by the metric of the in-\ndependent variable. Fortunately, Selvin provided a simple\nway of rank ordering (i.e., standardizing) the relative effects\nof the independent variables in logistic regression. This pro-\ncedure involves multiplying an unstandardized logistic re-\ngression coefficient by the standard deviation of the inde-\npendent variable. Cast in the context of the present study,\nthese standardized estimates indicate the change in log-odds\nof developing hypertension for a one standard deviation in-\ncrease in a given independent variable.\nThree main findings emerge from the model assessing the\nadditive effects of the study measures on change in self-\nreported hypertension over time (see Model 1). To begin\nwith, the three dimensions of religion do not appear to exert\na substantial additive effect on hypertension. More specifi-\ncally, religious coping responses (  .076, ns), as well\nas belief in the afterlife (  .035, ns), fail to exert a statis-\ntically significant effect. In contrast, private religious prac-\ntices have a slight impact (  .161, p  .05), but the rela-\ntionship is not in the anticipated direction. In particular, the\ndata suggest that a one-unit increase in private religious\npractices is associated with about a 7% increase in the odds\nof developing hypertension over the course of the follow-up\nperiod (odds ratio [OR]  1.072). Although this finding\nwas not anticipated, similar results have been obtained by\nother investigators. More specifically, Levin and Markides\n(1985) reported that respondents in their study with high\nlevels of self-rated religiosity were more likely to have hy-\npertension than respondents who did not feel that religion\nwas very important to them.\nThe second finding to emerge from Model 1 has to do with\nthe effects of bereavement on hypertension. More specifi-\ncally, the data in the left-hand portion of Table 2 reveal that\nthe death of a loved one is not related significantly to change\nin self-reported hypertension over time (  .066, ns).\nFinally, the data in Model 1 indicate that the impact of\nsome of the control measures on hypertension is similar to\nwhat other investigators have observed. More specifically,\nTable 2. The Effects of Religion and Recent Deaths on Changes in Hypertension (N  1,723)\nIndependent Variable c d Odds Ratio   Odds Ratio\naModel 1 tests additive effects only. bModel 2 tests for the interaction between recent deaths and the religion measures. cUnstandardized logistic regression coeffi-\ncient. dStandardized logistic regression coefficient computed by multiplying the unstandardized logistic regression coefficient by the standard deviation of the indepen-\ndent variable. eChi-square value is not significant at the .05 level.\nthe findings suggest that a higher BMI is associated with an\nincrease in self-reported hypertension over the course of the\nsults further reveal that older adults in Japan who exercise\nmore frequently tend to have a slightly lower risk of report-\ning they have developed high blood pressure at Wave 5 ( \nViewed broadly, the data that have been examined so far\nsuggest that neither religion nor the death of a significant\nother appears to have a substantial effect on change in self-\nreported hypertension over the course of the study. How-\never, as the findings in the right-hand side of the table re-\nveal, this conclusion may be premature.\nThe data provided by Model 2 indicate that neither pri-\nvate religious practices (  .043, ns) nor religious coping\n(  .090, ns) offset the noxious effects of bereavement\non changes in self-reported hypertension (unstandardized\ncoefficients are reported when focusing on the multiplica-\ntive terms because standardized estimates are meaningless\nin this context). In contrast, the multiplicative term repre-\nsenting the interaction between belief in the afterlife and\ndeath of a loved one is significant at the .005 level ( \nAlthough the interaction effect between belief in the af-\nterlife and death of a loved one is statistically significant, it\nmay be somewhat difficult to determine whether this rela-\ntionship is in the hypothesized direction. Fortunately, as dis-\ncussed earlier, the data in Table 2 can be used in conjunc-\ntion with Equation 2 to provide estimates of the impact of\ndeath of a loved one on change in self-reported hyperten-\nsion at select values of belief in the afterlife. Scores on the\nafterlife measure ranged from 2 to 10. Even though any of\nthese values could be used to illustrate the interaction effect,\nwe selected four that are almost equally spaced: 2, 5, 8, and\n10. The results of the hand calculations that were performed\nby substituting these scores into Equation 2 are presented in\nThe data in Table 3 reveal that at the lowest possible\nscore on belief in the afterlife, death of a loved one is asso-\nciated with a sharp increase in the odds of developing hy-\npertension over time (OR  1.716). This means that when\nolder Japanese do not believe in a good afterlife, the odds of\nreporting they have high blood pressure following the death\nof a significant other increase by about 72%. This finding is\nimportant because approximately 22% of the study partici-\npants indicated they did not believe at all in a good afterlife\n(i.e., 381 respondents had a score of 2 on the afterlife mea-\nsure).\nA value of 5 on the afterlife measure represents the me-\ndian score for the older participants in this study. The data\nin Table 3 reveal that, at this level, the noxious effects of be-\nreavement are offset completely, and there is a slight de-\ncline in the odds of developing hypertension following the\ndeath of a loved one (OR  .771). However, as the upper\nconfidence limit for this estimate exceeds 1, this finding\nmust be viewed with caution.\nThe potentially protective effects of belief in a good af-\nterlife become evident for those Japanese elders with a\nscore of 8. This score is slightly higher than one standard\ndeviation above the mean score for belief in afterlife (SD \n6.55). At an afterlife score of 8, the odds of reporting hyper-\ntension at the follow-up interview dropped by about 63%\nfor older people who experienced the loss of a significant\nother but who maintained a strong belief in a good afterlife\nFinally, the potentially protective effects of belief in a\npositive afterlife become especially apparent among older\npeople in Japan with the highest score on measure of belief\nin the afterlife (i.e., 10). At this level, the death of a loved\none is associated with a fairly substantial drop in the odds of\nreporting that one has developed hypertension over time\n(OR  .204). However, this coefficient must be viewed\nwith caution, because only 35 elderly people had a score of\n10 on the afterlife measure.\nSupplementary Analyses\nThe findings presented up to this point suggest there may\nbe a lagged effect of death of a loved one and belief in the\nafterlife on change in hypertension over time. However, as\ndiscussed above, greater confidence may be placed in these\nresults if we explore other temporal specifications. Follow-\ning the supplemental data analytic strategy discussed ear-\nlier, we tested for contemporaneous effects by examining\nthe relationships among religion, death of a loved one, and\nhypertension with data that have been gathered at the same\npoint in time (i.e., Wave 4). These additional analyses failed\nto reveal significant main effects of any religion measure or\ndeath of a loved one on self-reported hypertension. More-\nover, these analyses failed to uncover any significant inter-\naction effects between the religion measures and death of a\nloved one on hypertension (a table containing the results of\nthese analyses is available from Neal Krause). Coupled with\nthe findings presented in Table 2, these analyses reveal that\nthe effects of religion and bereavement on hypertension are\nlagged and that it may take some time for the effects of\nthese independent variables to become manifest.\nAs discussed earlier, the second set of supplemental anal-\nyses involved estimating the correlation between death of a\nloved one and belief in the afterlife. The findings reveal that\nthe two constructs are not related significantly (r  .006).\nThree useful insights emerge from these results. First, belief\nin the afterlife does not appear to be stress responsive. In-\nstead of altering beliefs to ease the pain of a loss, older peo-\nple in Japan appear to be relying on beliefs that have arisen\nTable 3. The Impact of Recent Deaths on Change in Hypertension\nat Select Values of Belief in the Afterlife (N  1,723)\nValue of Belief in the Afterlife\naUnstandardized logistic regression coefficient. bStandardized logistic re-\ngression coefficient computed by multiplying the unstandardized logistic regres-\nsion coefficient by the standard deviation of the independent variable.\nfrom, and are maintained by, other factors. This finding is\nconsistent with studies in the West, which have shown that\nother dimensions of religion are not stress responsive either\ninsight into the factors that may be at work here. In particu-\nlar, he noted that when people grapple with problematic\nevents, they turn to cognitive frameworks that are firmly in\nplace because these belief systems are familiar and plausi-\nble and have frequently worked in the past. Second, these\nresults do not necessarily negate the points made by Mar-\nrone (1999). Rather, they suggest that cognitive restructur-\ning following the loss of a loved one may involve factors\nother than belief in the afterlife. Third, and most important,\nthe additional analysis reveals that data estimation problems\nare not likely to have arisen in our study and that the inter-\naction between death of a loved one and belief in the after-\nlife is not confounded by a strong relationship between be-\nreavement and belief in the afterlife.\nDISCUSSION\nSome scholars have concluded that men and women have\nbelieved in life after death since the year 50,000 B.C. (e.g.,\nEliade, 1978). Since that time, many world religions have\nembraced the notion that people live on in another world\nfollowing death. This is true in Japan, where elaborate ritu-\nals have arisen around communication with, and care of,\nthose who have passed on to the next life (Klass, 1996). If\nbelief in life after death has flourished for approximately 50\nmillennia, then it must serve some purpose. The central aim\nof the present study was to explore one possibility. In partic-\nular, the main thrust of our analyses was to see if older peo-\nple in Japan who believed in a good afterlife were less likely\nto report they developed hypertension following the death\nof a loved one than those who did not believe in a good af-\nterlife. Data from a nationwide longitudinal survey support\nthis hypothesis. Viewed broadly, these findings provide evi-\ndence of yet another way in which religion may influence\nthe health of elderly people. However, these results also re-\nveal that the beneficial effects of religion appear to be fairly\ncircumscribed when a significant other dies. Rather than in-\nvolving private religious practices or more general religious\ncoping responses, the data from this study suggest that the\npotentially salubrious effects of religion arise from specific\nbeliefs about life after death.\nThere are four reasons why these findings are notewor-\nthy. First, studies on religion tend to focus primarily on reli-\ngious practices and behaviors while paying less attention to\nreligious beliefs. By focusing on a single stressful experi-\nence (i.e., death of a loved one), we provide evidence show-\ning how a particular religious belief (i.e., belief in the after-\nlife) may perform an important stress-buffering function.\nThis more focused approach to studying religion, stress, and\nhealth is consistent with research in the wider stress litera-\nture on the matching hypothesis (Wills & Shinar, 2000).\nAccording to this perspective, greater insight into the stress\nprocess will be obtained if investigators endeavor to show\nhow the noxious effects of particular types of stress are off-\nset by specific coping resources that directly address the\nneeds created by the stressor at hand. Researchers wishing\nto continue this type of research may benefit by examining\nhow the deleterious effects of other specific types of stress\nare offset by different religious beliefs that are matched\nwith, and take care of, the needs created by these life events.\nSecond, beliefs about sacred matters lie at the core of all\nreligions, yet as Levin (2001) pointed out, religious beliefs\nhave rarely been used to study physical health outcomes. In-\nstead, the little work that has been done with religious be-\nliefs focuses primarily on measures of psychological well-\nbeing, such as life satisfaction (Krause, 1993). The findings\nin the present study suggest that in addition to studying\nwell-being, researchers in the West, as well as in Japan,\nshould pay far more attention to the potentially important\nrole that religious beliefs may play in the restoration and\nmaintenance of physical health.\nThird, the findings from this study are important because\nwe examined the interface between religion, stress, and\nhealth in a culture that differs substantially from that of the\nUnited States. This is noteworthy because research in the\nWest has already shown that belief in the afterlife helps\npeople cope effectively with the death of a loved one (Smith\nevidence that at least this facet of the religion\u00adhealth con-\nnection is fairly robust across cultures.\nFourth, the findings from this study are noteworthy be-\ncause they are based on longitudinal data provided by a na-\ntionally representative sample of study participants. This\nhas enabled us to examine the effects of religion and stress\non change in self-reported hypertension over time. This rep-\nresents a significant contribution to the literature because, as\nKoenig and his colleagues (2001) observed, the majority of\nstudies on religion and health rely primarily on cross-sec-\ntional research designs and samples that are not representa-\ntive.\nAlthough the findings from our study may be thought\nprovoking, a considerable amount of work remains to be\ndone. For example, research in the West has revealed that\nreligion is associated with a wide range of health-related\noutcomes, including mortality, a number of specific acute\nand chronic conditions, and several dimensions of psycho-\nlogical well-being (e.g., depression; Koenig et al., 2001).\nWe need to know whether religion also exerts this type of\nbroad-based effect on health in Japan.\nOnly three dimensions of religion were examined in this\nstudy. However, investigators have argued for some time\nthat religion is a complex multidimensional phenomenon\nthat may be assessed in a number of ways (Ellison & Levin,\n1998). Further research is needed to see whether other di-\nmensions of religion in Japan are related to health as well.\nFor example, several studies in the West have examined the\nrelationship between religiously motivated forgiveness and\nhealth (see McCullough, Pargament, & Thoresen, 2000, for\na review of this research). Research is needed in Japan to\nsee whether religion is related to forgiveness and, if it is,\nwhether forgiveness is associated with health. Similarly, re-\nsearch in the West has suggested that religious affiliation or\npreference may also have an effect on health (Levin, 2001).\nWe need to know whether the same is true with respect to\nBuddhist and Shinto affiliation in Japan.\nBut instead of merely assessing dimensions of religion\nthat have been identified in the West, research is also\nneeded on facets of religion that are relatively unique to\nAsian cultures. For example, research on ancestor worship\nwas reviewed earlier (Klass, 1996), but we did not measure\nthis unique dimension of religion directly. Because ancestor\nworship is a core component of religion in Japan, it is impor-\ntant to devise specific survey measures of it and see whether\nancestor worship is related to health and well-being.\nIn the process of devising plans for further research, it is\nimportant to keep the limitations of our study in mind.\nThree shortcomings are discussed briefly below.\nThe first limitation in our work has to do with the mea-\nsurement of religious coping. Three indicators were used in\nthe present study to assess this construct, but as the work of\nPargament (1997) revealed, religious coping is a vast con-\nceptual domain that contains a large number of dimensions\nand a wide range of specific attitudes and behaviors. Clearly,\nmore extensive measures of religious coping are needed for\nfurther research in Japan.\nSecond, our measure of hypertension is based on respon-\ndent self-reports. This raises obvious questions regarding\nself-report bias. Although we presented data earlier that\nsuggest that self-reports may be reliable, researchers would\nbenefit from using other ways to assess hypertension, in-\ncluding physician diagnoses, medical record checks, or di-\nrect measurement blood pressure during the interview.\nThird, as reported earlier, the reliability of the private re-\nligious practice measure used in this study is somewhat low\n(.572). Although there is not complete consensus in the lit-\nerature, some investigators have recommended that internal\nconsistency estimates should be at least .700 (Nunnally,\n1978). However, the issue may not be as straightforward as\nit initially appears. Our measure of private religious prac-\ntices consists of only three indicators. This is important be-\ncause it is well-known that coefficient alpha is sensitive to\nthe number of items in a scale. More specifically, it is\nharder to attain estimates of the size recommended by Nun-\nnally (1978) when there are only a few measures in an index\n(Cortina, 1993). Even so, those wishing to conduct further\nresearch on private religious practices would benefit from\nusing more reliable measures.\nThe death of a loved one is a truly universal event that is\nexperienced by virtually everyone around the world. More-\nover, the odds of losing a significant other through death in-\ncrease as people grow older. Religion is also a universal\nphenomenon in the sense that it is found in virtually every\nmajor culture in the world. Consequently, it makes sense to\nexplore the interface between religion and the loss of a\nloved one in cross-cultural settings. Doing so provides a ex-\nciting forum for exploring how older people around the\nworld differ and are alike. We hope the findings reported in\nthis study encourage others to pursue this integral facet of\naging around the globe.\n"
