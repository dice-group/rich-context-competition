We evaluated the optimal biliary access point and learning curve for technically\nsuccessful EUS-HGS.\nunderwent EUS-HGS due to an inaccessible papilla were enrolled. EUS finding and procedure\ntimes according to each needle puncture attempt in EUS-HGS were prospectively measured.\nLearning curves of EUS-HGS were calculated for two main outcome measurements\n(procedure time and adverse events) by using the moving average method and cumulative sum\n(CUSUM) analysis, respectively.\nResults: A total of 174 EUS-HGS attempts were performed in 129 patients. The mean number\nof needle punctures was 1.35 \u00b1 0.57. Using the logistic regression model, bile duct diameter\nand hepatic portion length [linear distance from the mural wall to the punctured bile duct wall on\np < 0.01) were associated with low technical success. Procedure time and adverse events were\nshorter after 24 cases, and stabilized at 33 cases of EUS-HGS, respectively.\nConclusions: Our data suggest that a bile duct diameter > 5 mm and hepatic portion length\n1 cm to  3 cm on EUS may be suitable for successful EUS-HGS. In our learning curve analysis,\nover 33 cases might be required to achieve the plateau phase for successful EUS-HGS.\n",

It still remains a difficult procedure\nfor endosonographers in centers with a low\nvolume of EUS-HGS because it is an operator-\ndependent process, and reliant upon with an\naccumulation of experience in EUS-HGS.\nCurrently, there are a lack of data regarding the\noptimum biliary access point and the learning\ncurve of EUS-HGS. Therefore, the aim of this\nstudy was to evaluate the optimal biliary access\npoint for technically successful EUS-HGS. The\nsecondary aim was to evaluate the EUS-HGS\nlearning curve.\nMethod\nPatients\nA total of 129 patients were enrolled in this study\nattempts at EUS-HGS were performed by a sin-\ngle experienced endoscopist (D.H.P.). Our inclu-\nsion criteria were (1) failure of initial biliary\ncannulation or bile duct decompression through\nERCP because of accompanying duodenal\nobstruction, periampullary tumor infiltration,\nsurgically altered anatomy, or high-grade hilar\nbiliary stricture, or failed guidewire manipulation\nin EUS-guided antegrade stenting and (2)\npatients who refused PTBD. Our exclusion crite-\nria were (1) refusal to participate in the study pro-\ntocol, (2) patients with accessible papillae and\nattempt of EUS-guided rendezvous, (3) preg-\nnancy, and (4) patient age less than 20 years. All\npatients provided written informed consent for\nparticipation in this study. The Institutional\nReview Board approved the study protocol (IRB\nwas obtained from each patient to perform\nEUS-BD before the procedure.\nProcedure\nAntibiotics were administered to all patients\nbefore the intervention. EUS-HGS was per-\nformed using a GF-UCT 240 linear-array ech-\noendoscope (Olympus Medical Systems, Tokyo,\nJapan). The echoendoscope was placed in the\ncardia or lesser curvature of the stomach, and ori-\nented to view the intrahepatic duct. Color\nDoppler imaging was used to identify the regional\nvasculature. A bile duct puncture was performed\nMedical, Winston-Salem, USA). To confirm suc-\ncessful biliary access, contrast medium was\ninjected under fluoroscopy to demonstrate biliary\nopacification. A 0.035-inch guidewire [Tracer\n(Hybrid Wire Guide guidewire, Cook Medical,\nBloomington, USA); Jagwire (Boston Scientific,\nNatick, USA)] or a 0.025-inch VisiGlide guide-\nwire (Olympus America, San Jose, USA) was\nadvanced thorough the fine-needle aspiration\n(FNA) needle. Tract dilation was performed after\nthe withdrawal of the FNA needle. A 4F cannula\n(Glo-tip, Cook Medical, Winston-Salem, USA)\nwas inserted over the guidewire for fistula tract\ndilation. Thereafter, 6F and 7F biliary dilator\ncatheters (catheter tip, 4F; Cook Medical) were\ninserted over the guidewire and removed, in that\norder, to dilate the tract. If there was resistance\nto advancement of the 6F dilator catheter, a\ntriple-lumen needle-knife (Microtome, Boston\nScientific) with a 7F shaft diameter was gently\ninserted over the guidewire to dilate the tract by\nusing a brief burst of pure cutting current. After\nfistula tract creation, a straight plastic stent (7\u00ad\n10F in a diameter \u00d7 6\u00ad10 cm in length), or a fully\ncovered self-expandable metal stent (FCSEMS)\nwith flared ends or anchoring flaps (6\u00ad10 mm\ndiameter \u00d7 6\u00ad10 cm in length, fully covered with\na silicon membrane, Standard Sci Tech, Seoul,\nKorea or MI tech, Seoul, Korea) was placed over\nthe guidewire. Measurements were taken for the\nintrahepatic bile duct diameter at the point of\ninterest, the hepatic portion length (linear dis-\ntance from the mural wall to the punctured bile\nduct wall in the measurement of EUS), and bile\nduct segment (B2 or B3) for each needle punc-\nture attempt, and procedure times (from initial\nbile duct puncture to successful transmural stent-\ning) in each EUS-HGS session. Withdrawal and\nrepositioning of the EUS fine needle for better\naccess to transmural stenting was permitted fol-\nlowing failed opacification of the bile duct during\ncontrast injection, the misplacement of the guide-\nwire, or a difficult fistula dilation process with\ngraded dilation. Based on our algorithm [Park\ntechnique was not considered in this cohort with\ninaccessible papilla (duodenal invasion or surgi-\ncally altered anatomy). EUS-HGS was performed\nby a single, experienced endosonographer trained\nin both ERCP and EUS.

Later cases with use\nof balloon dilation were not included [Paik et al.\n2014]. Learning curves of EUS-HGS were cal-\nculated for two main outcome measurements\n(procedure time and adverse events) by using the\nmoving average method, and cumulative sum\n(CUSUM) analysis, respectively.\nDefinition of events\nTechnical success in EUS-HGS was defined as\nsuccessful stent placement following EUS needle\npuncture, guidewire placement and fistula tract\ndilation at the first attempt of EUS-HGS. Overall\ntechnical success was defined as the successful\ncompletion of the EUS-HGS procedure with\nsuccessful stenting, along with the flow of con-\ntrast medium and/or bile through the stent\nregardless of the number of attempts at biliary\naccess in EUS-HGS. Functional success was\ndefined as a decrease in bilirubin or alkaline\nphosphatase to less than 75% of the pretreatment\nvalue within the first month [Park et al. 2013].\nStent patency was measured from the day on\nwhich the stent for EUS-HGS was placed to the\ntime of stent dysfunction or patient death.\nProcedural adverse events were defined as any\nprocedure-related adverse events occurring\nwithin two weeks of the procedure, including\ncholangitis, bile peritonitis, biloma, bleeding,\npneumoperitoneum, or stent migration [Park\net al. 2011]. These were classified and graded\naccordingtoAmericanSocietyforGastrointestinal\nEndoscopy workshop reports [Cotton et al.\n2010]. Based on these reports, four grades of\nseverity were classified, based primarily on the\nneed for hospitalization: mild, events requiring\nhospitalization of 1\u00ad3 days; moderate, 4\u00ad9 days'\nhospitalization; severe, more than 10 days' hospi-\ntalization or requiring surgery or intensive care;\nand fatal, death attributable to the procedure\n[Cotton et al. 2010]. Late adverse events were\nany stent-related complication, such as stent\nmigration, and stent occlusion, occurring 14 days\nafter stent placement [Park et al. 2011]. Stent\nocclusion was defined as the recurrence of jaun-\ndice and cholestasis and/or evidence of a dilated\nbiliary system on US or CT with a direct view of\nthe upper endoscope, which in all cases would\nrequire biliary intervention.\nStatistical analysis\nAll of the analyses were performed using SPSS\nversion 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). The\nresults are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard devia-\ntion. Categorical parameters were compared by\nusing a chi-square test and Fisher's exact test, and\ncontinuous variables using a t-test. Multivariable\nanalysis was performed using the logistic regres-\nsion method to examine successful EUS-HGS\nfactors. These EUS-HGS factors were selected\naccording to our experience. Cumulative patency\nduration was estimated using Kaplan-Meier anal-\nysis. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant.\nTime periods were sorted by procedure time and\nadverse events to determine the learning curve for\nEUS-HGS. Procedure time was analyzed using\nthe moving average method [Kayano et al. 2011;\nJeon et al. 2016]. A five-case moving averages was\nused, as the moving averages for less than five\ncases exhibited excessive variation. The moving-\naverage method removes individual changes and\nthus clarifies trends. The optimal cutoff point was\ndetermined based on the moving average trend.\nCUSUM analysis was used to evaluate adverse\nevents for all cases. This is a method of continu-\nously assessing the performance of an individual\nor process against a predetermined standard\nto detect adverse trends and allow for early\nintervention [Park et al. 2015a]. All cases were\nordered chronologically to calculate the CUSUM.\nCUSUM was defined as S (Pi\n), where Pi\nis an\nindividual attempt, and P0\nthe reference or target\nvalue for the procedure, with Pi\n= 1 for failure\n(adverse event) and Pi\n= 0 for success (no adverse\nevent). The P0\nfor the conversion rate was set at\n0.1, reflecting a target conversion rate of 10 %.\nTherefore, a positive slope would mean failure,\nand a negative slope, success. In general, the P0\nvalue is set by using the minimum acceptable cri-\nteria to assess the competency [Ward et al. 2014;\nPark et al. 2015a]. Thus, the expected incidences\n(30%) of adverse events for EUS-HGS were\nbased on the multicenter report with an experi-\nence < 20 EUS-guided cholangiopancreatogra-\nResults\n13 years and 81 of whom were male were included\nin this study.

However, the rate of adverse\nevents stabilized after 33 cases of HGS (Figure 3).\nFor reaching this number with failed ERCP and\ninaccessible papilla, 712 consecutive ERCP cases\nfor biliary obstruction was required.\nWe performed multivariate analysis between 120\noverall attempts.

Age, sex, cause of obstruction, the pres-\nence of ascites, the lapse of time (group 1 or 2\nbased on procedure time), and intrahepatic bile\nduct segment (B2 or B3) were not associated with\nthe technical success in EUS-HGS (Table 5).\nDiscussion\nTo date, little is known about the optimal biliary\naccess point and learning curve of EUS-HGS.\nRegarding the optimal biliary access point for EUS-\nHGS, this technique seems to be similar to precut-\nting for transpapillary biliary cannulation because\nof the free-hand technique employed in both proce-\ndures. Therefore, EUS-HGS may be more difficult\nthan EUS-choledochoduodenostomy, requiring a\nrelatively stable scope position and fixed biliary\naccess point (duodenal bulb), even in experienced\nTable 3.

Furthermore, the\nabsence of studies on the ideal puncture site limit\nthe general popularity of EUS-HGS, which tends\nto be performed only by experts in a few tertiary\ncenters. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge,\nthis study first evaluated technical proficiency with\ntime trends for the evaluation of the optimal biliary\naccess point and the learning curve of EUS-HGS\nby single operator.\nThe overall technical success rate of EUS-HGS\nachieved in our study was comparable with that of\nPaik et al. 2014]. However, the technical success\nlower than the overall technical success rate. The\nsuccess rate achieved on the first attempt and\nsubsequent attempts may reflect the effect of a\nlearning curve because outcomes of all the proce-\ndures according to time trends were reported. In\naddition, the difference between these success\nrates may have resulted from withdrawal and sub-\nsequent puncture of the EUS fine needle in 35.7%\nof the patients to gain better access to the\nTable 4.

However, the procedure time of\ngroup 2 was significantly shorter than that of\ncedure time). Furthermore, the rate of adverse\nevents showed a decreasing tendency without sta-\ntistical significance in group 2 (22.9% in group 2\nbased on procedure time). With the accumula-\ntion of an operator's experience of EUS-HGS,\nthis repositioning of the EUS fine needle for bet-\nter access point of EUS-HGS with transmural\nstenting may have related to technical proficiency\nachieved without increasing adverse events as in\nour previous study [Oh et al. 2016]. The place-\nment of an FCSEMS may be also helpful for\nsealing the previously punctured intrahepatic\nduct as compared with that of plastic stenting\npatients. In our study, a substantial number of\npatients had an advanced stage of malignancy,\ncomplex type of hilar stricture, or accompanying\nduodenal obstruction. These subgroup complexi-\nties may have influenced the functional success\nreported in our study.\npatients in the current study, which is comparable\nwith that cited in other studies [Park et al. 2009,\nstrated in our previous studies that the use of a\nneedle knife for fistula dilation in EUS-BD may\nbe associated with postprocedure adverse events\n[Park et al. 2011]. A needle knife was used more\nsignificantly in patients who experienced adverse\nresults verify that the risk associated with\nEUS-BD, and the use of a needle knife for fistula\ndilation in EUS-BD should be avoided if\npossible.\nThe ideal puncture site for EUS-HGS is the most\nimportant technical issue. It is important to iden-\ntify the optimal biliary access point in EUS-HGS,\nespecially for those inexperienced in its use\nbecause the procedure can be accompanied by\nsignificant adverse events such as bile peritonitis,\nstent migration, pneumoperitoneum, and cholan-\net al. 2016]. However, to date, none of the studies\nhave evaluated the optimal biliary access point\nfor EUS-HGS. Our data suggest that bile duct\ndiameter at the point of interest > 5 mm, and\nhepatic portion length of 1 cm to  3 cm on EUS\n(Figure 4b) might facilitate successful EUS-HGS.\nAlthough shorter hepatic portion length on EUS\nhas an advantage for puncture the intrahepatic\nbile duct, a certain amount of stent must be\nlocated in the hepatic parenchyma to prevent\nmigration or bile leakage as in PTBD [Ogura\net al. 2015]. As usual, we inserted a metal stent\ninto the left intrahepatic bile duct of 2 or 3 cm\nlength with 3 cm length in the luminal portion\nduring EUS-HGS [Ogura et al. 2015]. This intra-\nhepatic bile duct portion is also located in the\nhepatic parenchyma. This 2 or 3 cm in the left\nintrahepatic bile duct and hepatic portion length\n(linear distance from the mural wall to the punc-\ntured bile duct wall in the measurement of EUS)\nin the hepatic parenchyma was considered to pre-\nvent stent migration or bile leakage as in PTBD.\nA dilated bile duct may be a prerequisite for suc-\ncessful EUS-BD (Figure 4a). However, insuffi-\ncient intrahepatic bile duct dilatation was\nfrequently observed in failed the first attempt of\nTable 5.

Then a fully covered\nmetal stent was successfully placed at the third attempt.\nEUS, endoscopic ultrasound; FNA, fine-needle aspiration needle.\nD Oh, DH Park et al.\nhttp://tag.sagepub.com 51\nEUS-HGS. In these circumstances, less than 5\nmm of intrahepatic bile duct dilatation should not\nbe chosen as an optimal biliary access point for\ninitial puncture with the EUS FNA needle.\nAlthough the B3 approach may be more suitable\nfor EUS-HGS, a statistically significant difference\nin the success rates between B2 and B3 was not\nobserved [Park, 2015]. Therefore, we evaluated\nthe parameter for successful fistula dilation and\nstent placement. In our previous study [Paik et al.\n2014], the distance from the mural wall to the\npunctured bile duct may be important for choos-\ning the length of the stent. In this study, additional\nsteps in the fistula dilation process may be required\nfor a distance > 3 cm. This distance may repre-\nsent the puncture of the central intrahepatic duct,\nrather than that of the peripheral intrahepatic\nduct. Theoretically, stent deployment may be dif-\nficult in longer distances between the mural wall\nand the punctured bile duct because a longer stent\nand angulation on stent deployment may be\nrequired. With limited experiences of EUS-HGS,\nmultiple needle-puncture attempts during EUS-\nHGS may have increased the risk of procedure-\nrelated adverse events. Therefore, further multi-\ncenter studies are required to confirm our results,\nwhich build upon the EUS findings with respect\nto the first attempt of EUS-HGS.\nThe results of this study suggest that the technical\nproficiency required with regard to procedure time\nneeded to perform the procedures improved sig-\nnificantly with experience after 24 cases (Figure 2).\nAlthough a statistically significant difference was\nnot noted between the two periods, approximately\n33 procedures are needed to acquire the technical\nskills for EUS-HGS in order to reach a stabilization\nlevel in terms of adverse events. (Figure 3). This\nmay be because of the following reasons: (1)\nincreased familiarity with technical maneuvers,\nsuch as the correct orientation of the echoendo-\nscope with respect to the position of the dilated\nintrahepatic duct, (2) identifying an appropriate\nplane for guidewire manipulation, fistula tract dila-\ntion, and stent insertion, (3) the ability to choose\nstents of the correct length based on the puncture\nsite,and(4)increasedexperienceoftheendoscopist.\nThere were several limitations to this study. First,\nthe technical proficiency reported in this study\nwas evaluated by one endosonographer with\nexpertise in both EUS and ERCP in a large ter-\ntiary academic center. Therefore, the number of\nEUS-HGSs required to achieve mastery for oper-\nators in a low-ERCP-volume center may have\nbeen underestimated. Thus, a larger, multicenter,\nprospective study may be needed to confirm our\nresults. EUS-HGS can be performed after failed\nERCP. This suggests that evaluation of this proce-\ndure is difficult for most low-volume ERCP cent-\ners with trainees. Furthermore, EUS-HGS should\nbe performed by endosonographers who are\ntrained in both EUS and ERCP. Therefore, given\nthese limited resources, we conducted this study\nwith a large number of EUS-HGS performed by a\nsingle, experienced endosonographer without\nexperience of EUS-HGS before commencement\nof this study. Although the single-operator experi-\nence limits the ability to generalize our results, this\nstudy may have clinical impact on successful and\nrobust EUS-HGS procedures because our results\nmay be informative to endoscopists who are start-\ning to perform EUS-HGS with regard to the effi-\ncacy and spread of EUS-HGS.\nSecond, EUS-BD was performed using the con-\nventional fistula dilation process and stent deploy-\nment system in this study. A substantial number\n(33 failed ERCP cases with inaccessible papillae\nin 712 consecutive ERCP cases for biliary\nobstruction) of EUS-HGS for technical profi-\nciency was required owing to the complexity of\nthe procedure. Therefore, the development of\ntraining models for EUS-HGS are mandatory for\nbeginners in order to shorten time to technical\nproficiency [Dhir et al. 2015]. Furthermore, the\nEUS-BD learning curve, using a one-step dedi-\ncated device, should be evaluated in a future\nIn conclusion, EUS-HGS may be performed\nsuccessfully when the bile duct is approached at\nthe point of bile duct diameter > 5 mm, with\nhepatic portion length being 1 cm to  3 cm on\nEUS. Based on our results, performed by a sin-\ngle endosonographer, technical proficiency, with\nregard to procedure time and adverse events,\nmay be competent after 33 cases of EUS-HGS\nusing the conventional fistula-dilation process\nand stent deployment system. Given a substan-\ntial number of cases requiring a learning curve of\nEUS-HGS in this study, various and extensive\nendoscopic teaching tools for EUS-HGS such as\nan ex vivo hands-on model or interventional\nEUS mechanical simulator may be encouraged\nprior to self-taught EUS-HGS procedures with-\nout supervision.\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(1)\n52 http://tag.sagepub.com\nFunding\nThis research was supported by a grant from the\nKorea Health Technology Research and\nDevelopment Project through the Korea Health\nIndustry Development Institute, funded by the\nMinistry of Health and Welfare, Republic of Korea\nstudy design, data collection and analysis, decision\nto publish, or preparation of the manuscript.\nConflict of interest statement\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nReferences\nCotton, P., Eisen, G., Aabakken, L., Baron, T.,\nHutter, M., Jacobson, B. et al.
