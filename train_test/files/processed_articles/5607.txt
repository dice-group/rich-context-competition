Mueller3,\nAlvin F. Wells4 and Housam Aldeen Sarakbi5\n Keywords\nRheumatoid arthritis, patient preference, temperature, fasting, route of administration, novel oral\ntherapies, patient profile, Middle East, Qatar, Arabian Gulf\nIntroduction\nDespite the introduction of biologic therapies\nfor the treatment of inflammatory diseases\nsuch as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the\n1990s, there remain many unmet needs in the\nmodern management of rheumatology at a\nglobal level. However, this global perspective\ncannot reflect the individual situations of\npatients in different countries and regions.\nConsequently, specific regional unmet needs\nare deserving of special examination, and\nhere we will focus on RA patients in Qatar.\nThe hot, humid climate, healthcare system\nand population demographics in this area of\nthe world attribute unique considerations for\npractising rheumatologists in this region that\nmay differ to those of specialists treating RA\nin the rest of the world. New therapies are\ncurrently being developed that aim to address\nsome of these unmet needs, including novel\noral therapies such as targeted synthetic\ndisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs\n(tsDMARDs).1 It is widely expected that\npatients will prefer to receive an oral therapy\nover a subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV)\none,2,3 but this may not be the case for all\ngroups. Additionally, there are concerns\nabout compliance and wasted drug with\noral medication. To give regional guidance\non the use of newly available therapies, we\nhave conducted a patient preference and\nprofile survey, the results of which are pre-\nsented here alongside a review of the situ-\nation in Qatar and the wider Arabian Gulf\nregion.\nRA management in the Arabian Gulf\nRA is a chronic inflammatory disease with\nan estimated prevalence of 0.5\u00ad1% in\nNorthern Europe and North America.4\nHowever, there are few large epidemio-\nlogical studies or good-quality registry data\nto suggest the disease's overall prevalence in\nthe region of the Arabian Gulf.5\u00ad7 Small\npopulation and hospital-based studies give\nwide variation, from 0.19% in rural Iran to\n1.0% of the adult population in Lebanon\nand Iraq.8\u00ad12 In Oman, the prevalence of RA\nin the population has been calculated at\nDisease severity also varies geographic-\nally, and it has traditionally been believed\nthat most Arab patients with RA have a\nnon-aggressive form of the disease.5,14 These\nbeliefs may lead to significant delays in\ndiagnosis and treatment.15 However, the\ndisease severity is, in fact, comparable to\nthat seen in other parts of the world,15\u00ad17\nwith physicians reporting only 12% of\npatients in clinical practice having low dis-\nease activity in this region (LDA; defined as\nIt has long been accepted that there are\ncultural differences in how RA is managed\nin the Middle East.18 Management practices\nvary widely \u00ad often depending on the socio-\neconomic status of individual patients and\ncomplicated by local infrastructure or lack\nof it \u00ad but there are signs that disease\nmanagement strategy is evolving in the\nMiddle East \u00ad and the Gulf states in particu-\nlar \u00ad and many clinicians are now imple-\nmenting up-to-date treatment guidelines and\nrecommendations from international socie-\nties.5,15 In Qatar, the majority of patients\nreceive conventional synthetic (cs)\nDMARDs, and 64% of patients seen in\nthe clinic achieve LDA or remission.19 Yet\ndespite this move towards modern practice,\nRA patients often experience a delay in\ndiagnosis: a recent study in Dubai found\nerosions in 55% of patients, suggesting\na delay in diagnosis and management.16\nA review examining the use of the\nEuropean League Against Rheumatism\n(EULAR) recommendations in this region\nfound that there were barriers to implemen-\ntation, mainly for those individual recom-\nmendations that advocated aggressive\nmanagement, early use of intensive therapy\nand frequent monitoring.15 There still exists\na significant regional unmet need in the\nmanagement of RA.\nRegional environmental considerations in\nthe management of RA\nThere are certain regional environmental\nconsiderations that impact the management\nof RA patients. The first of these relates to\nthe climate, as summer temperatures in\nQatar can surpass 49C.20 To prevent dis-\nruption of the ``cold chain,'' biologic drugs\nare dispensed in a chilled bag from the\npharmacy. Although air conditioning is\ncommon in cars and homes, it is not entirely\nubiquitous for the poorest in society and\nthere is a risk that medication may be\nspoiled.\nRamadan fasting \u00ad a fundamental pillar\nof Islam \u00ad may have an effect on patient\ncompliance and disease activity.21,22 Whilst\npatients with chronic diseases may not be\nrequired to fast during Ramadan, many still\ndo, and this has an impact on adherence and\ndisease activity.22 Many patients prefer not\nto take oral or intravenous medications\nduring fasting hours,21 and as such, patients\nmight only take their therapies after sunset\nand before sunrise.23\u00ad25 This alteration in\ndosing schedule has a clear impact on\ncompliance.21 Some patients may not\nagree to medical procedures such as\nblood tests during Ramadan, which may\nhave an impact on routine monitoring.21\nAnecdotally, RA patients often do better\nduring Ramadan and feel well because they\nare fasting, but then flare afterwards.26,27\nThere is some speculation that this may be\nbecause the foods traditionally eaten during\nthe Ramadan month are better for RA\npatients than those consumed during the\nrest of the year, including an increase in\nprotein consumption and a reduction in\ncarbohydrate intake, and that fasting has a\ndirect effect on laboratory parameters.26\u00ad28\nAn important take-home point from the\nstudies discussed here is that most patients\ndid not receive any particular information\nabout changing their treatment during\nRamadan. More research is required in\nthis area to further understand the effects\nof Ramadan on adherence and disease\nactivity.\nGiven the unmet needs in this region, this\nstudy aimed to investigate the level of\ndisease activity in the region and patients'\npreferences regarding the route of adminis-\ntration for their therapy.\nMethods\nThe authors met at a face-to-face meeting in\nSeptember 2014. On the basis of discussions,\na cross-sectional patient survey was\ndesigned to collect data on the typical RA\npatient profile in the region (Box 1). The\nsurvey was conducted among 294 consecu-\ntive patients across three clinics in Qatar.\nEthics committee approval was waivered for\nBox 1.

The pre-\ndefined primary clinical end point was the\npreferred mode of application (oral, IV, SC)\nin comparison with the patient's currently\nemployed mode of application for treatment\nand in relation to their disease activity.\nSummary statistics are reported as either a\nmean with the minimum and maximum\nrange for continuous data (such as the age\nof the patient) or as a total for count data\n(such as the number of patients on each\nmode of application).\nDescriptive statistics were employed for\nthe analysis of baseline demographics.\nAmong the population analysed, the\npatients\u00b4 nationality was dichotomized into\nQatari and non-Qatari patients.\nThe mode of application employed and\npreferred was analysed separately for IV, SC\nand oral administration. Whether patients\ntreated with a certain mode of application\nwere pre-treated with another mode of\napplication was not analysed in this survey.\nFor the analysis of co-morbid diseases the\nresults focussed on cardiovascular condi-\ntions (including diabetes, hypertension,\nhyper/dyslipoproteinemia or other), none\nand not reported.\nResults\nIn our patient survey, 76% of patients in\nthe study clinics were female. The mean age\npatient survey also captured the split\nbetween Qatari nationals and non-Qatari\nnationals, with 93% of male patients and\n61% of female patients in the study clinics\nbeing of a nationality other than Qatari\n(Table 1).\nOf the 294 patients in our survey across\nthree clinics in Qatar, 69% expressed a\npreference for oral therapy, 23% for SC\ninjection and 8% for intravenous adminis-\ntration (Table 2). Highest patient preference\nwas for oral therapy, with 85% of patients\nwho received it expressing a preference to\nstay on oral therapy. In contrast, only 63%\nand 58% of intravenous and SC injection\npatients, respectively, indicated a preference\nto remain on their current method of admin-\nistration (Figure 1). The mean age of\npatients with recorded co-morbidities was\n(30%) diagnosed with one or more cardio-\nvascular diseases (Table 3).\nThe level of disease activity in RA\npatients is most commonly measured via\nDAS and/or clinical disease activity index\n(CDAI). The level of disease activity can be\nIn our survey, whilst DAS was recorded in\nonly 256 patients, CDAI was recorded in all\nThere was agreement between DAS and\nTable 1.

In particu-\nlar, Qatar has an unusually high rate of\ntemporary expatriates: Qatari nationals\nmake up only about 6% of the overall\nadult population, with the majority of the\ncountry's residents being migrant workers\nfrom Asia, Africa and Europe.36 In a recent\ncross-sectional study of 100 consecutive\nrheumatology patients at Hamad General\nHospital in Doha, less than a quarter of\npatients were Qatari nationals; the majority\n(59%) were immigrant workers from Asia.\nMost of the Qatari patients were female\nAsian patients, which reflects the high pro-\nportion of male immigrant workers.19 In our\nsurvey, we found that less than a third of\npatients from the three clinics were Qatari\nnationals and that these were almost exclu-\nsively women (95%), compared with only\n67% of non-national female patients.\nThis population skew has a direct bearing\non clinical practice, since Qatari nationals\nreceive free healthcare but non-Qatari immi-\ngrants do not \u00ad although those with a\nresidency visa have free access to primary\nand emergency healthcare services and pay\nonly 20% of the costs of speciality health-\ncare services and drugs.19 The Doha study\nfound that 65% of Qatari national patients\nreceived biologic therapies, compared with\n15% of eligible Asian immigrants.19 Whilst\nsome workers have medical insurance, the\nmajority of immigrant labourers do not, and\nthey cannot always pay for treatment. It is\nquite typical for these patients to visit their\nrheumatologist only when they can afford it,\nand this means that they are often untreated\nand flaring. Additionally, workers may\nreturn to their home country for extended\nperiods between contracts and, as such, they\nare lost to follow-up in the clinic. This high\nproportion of expatriates and lack of appro-\npriate medical insurance were cited as key\nreasons why physicians in countries in the\nregion have been unable to implement the\nEULAR recommendations in clinical prac-\ntice.15 The results of our survey align with\nthe region, representing varying and hetero-\ngeneous patient populations and the chal-\nlenge this presents for clinicians looking to\nadopt guidelines or recommendations.5 By\nhealth insurance legislation in Qatar, it will\nbe a requirement for companies to insure all\nnon-Qatari workers,37 although the policies\nmay not cover modern biologic therapies.\nFor these workers, in particular, affordable\noral therapies that can easily be transported\nand self-administered may prevent patients\nfrom taking breaks from therapy that may\ncause serious long-term damage to their\njoints.\nThe literature reports typical patient pro-\nfiles in the Arab region as being predomin-\nantly female, with a mean age of around\nage is an important factor that may also\nimpact treatment decisions41 \u00ad not least\nbecause older patients tend to have more\nco-morbidities, such as diabetes and heart\nfailure. In our survey, the mean age of\npatients with recorded co-morbidities was\n(30%) diagnosed with cardiovascular dis-\neases (Table 3). These numbers are of par-\nCooperation Council countries (Saudi\nArabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain) were\namong the top ten countries for highest\ndiabetes prevalence rates in the world, with\npatients affected, respectively.42\nThere are several limitations to this study.\nFirst, only the mode of application of treat-\nment was assessed through the survey;\ntherapy type was not specified, with no\ndirect comparisons between different thera-\npies being drawn. Second, further clinical\nsubgroups, including length of time on treat-\nment, socioeconomic status and patient-\nreported outcomes, were not defined.\nFuture research into these areas could further\nbuild upon the current landscape and patient\nprofiles within the region.\nThe future of RA therapy\nWhilst there are clear unmet needs remain-\ning for RA patients in the Arabian Gulf\nregion, there are new oral tsDMARD\ntherapies both available and in development\nthat may offer some benefit. As well as the\nobvious benefits for needle-phobic patients\nor those who are unwilling or unable to\ninject themselves, these therapies are\nexpected to be cheaper than biologics and\nwill not be subject to the same requirements\nfor cold storage, which may make them\nmore suitable for populations exposed to\nhot summers and periods of travel.\nAdditionally, new oral tsDMARD therapies\ncan be taken with or without food,43 and are\ntherefore not expected to have any food\ninteractions that would complicate the\ndosing schedule during Ramadan. However,\nthese new therapies will require a shift in\nclinical practice to be accommodated.\nOur group's clinical advice for rheuma-\ntologists considering using new oral\ntsDMARD therapies in their patients is\nbased on the European and US experience\nto date.44\u00ad46 Patients with autoimmune dis-\neases, such as RA, are at increased risk for\ninfections,45 but biologic and new oral\ntsDMARD therapies may make patients\nmore susceptible to opportunistic infec-\ntions.47 At the forefront are recommenda-\ntions for vaccination against herpes zoster\n(HZ), as high numbers of cases of HZ were\nobserved in clinical trials of some new\ntherapies.48 The routine measurement of\nvaricella titres in patients is recommended:\npatients found to have a protective range\ncan safely start therapy, but those with low\ntitres should receive varicella or zostervax\nvaccine 2\u00ad3 weeks before starting therapy.\nIndividual vaccination status should always\nbe checked by the rheumatologist and\nupdated prior to the initiation of any immu-\nsons in the region.49 The advice and recom-\nmendations for the prevention and\nmanagement of TB in patients receiving\nnew oral tsDMARD therapies are the same\nas those for biologics, with new patients\nreceiving a skin test prior to initiation of\ntherapy and every year thereafter.\nIt is this group's recommendation that all\nphysicians should endeavour to record the\nCDAI for every patient to gain a full picture\nof the disease burden and pattern. In order\nfor disease remission to be an implementable\ntarget, both in clinical studies and in prac-\ntice, it needs to be easy to calculate at the\nbedside. Aletaha et al.50 demonstrated that\nsimpler composite indices using an arith-\nmetic sum of the same components (SDAI\nand CDAI) correlate well with DAS.\nRecently, in Qatar, there has been a\nchange in clinical practice in the use of\ndisease measurements. It is becoming\nincreasingly common to record the CDAI\nat every patient visit, although DAS is still\nused for registry data collection.\nDespite advances in treatment and man-\nagement strategies, discord and misconcep-\ntion around the prevalence, severity and\nburden of RA persist in the Arabian Gulf\nregion and represent a key barrier to early\nand appropriate treatment.15 Overall, a\npreference for oral therapies over injection\nor infusion was observed in this study, and\nthe greatest patient preference was for oral\ntherapies. Whilst this survey did not capture\nthe reasons for the patients' preferred route\nof administration, it is suspected that oral\ntherapy is considered more convenient in\nthis highly mobile, working population. On\nthis basis, we recommend that the incorpor-\nation of new oral tsDMARD therapies into\nclinical practice will help to fulfil the current\nunmet treatment needs and alleviate the\nburden on patients and healthcare\nresources.\nCompliance with ethical standards\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nSamar Al-Emadi is a consultant for Pfizer.\nMohammed Hammoudeh received research\ngrants from Pfizer, Roche and Schering-Plough\nand consultation honorarium from Pfizer, Roche\nand Abbott.\nMohamed Mounir is an employee of Pfizer.\nRuediger B.
