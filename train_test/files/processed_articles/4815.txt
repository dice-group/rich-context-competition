In the immune\nsystem, lymphocyte proliferation is often taken as an important parameter\nindicating the status of the body's defenses. The stimulatory effect of whole-\nbody X-irradiation with a low dose (0.075 Gy) and suppressive effect of a\nhigh dose (2 Gy) on concanavalin A (Con A)\u00adinduced lymphocyte prolif-\neration have been repeatedly demonstrated (Troup and Anderson, 1982;\nThis work was supported by grants from NSFC.\nAddress correspondence to Shu-Zheng Liu, MH Radiobiology Research Unit, Jilin University Health\nSciences Center, Changchum 130021, People's Republic of China. E-mail: drliusz@yahoo.com\nLiu, 1998). In a previous paper the dose\u00adeffect relationship of immunologic\nchanges following whole-body X-irradiation and some of the mechanisms\nof low-dose radiation-induced lymphocyte stimulation were analyzed (Liu,\n2003). It was demonstrated that intercellular reactions between the antigen\npresenting cells and lymphocytes and the facilitation of the intracellular sig-\nnaling cascades thus initiated in the lymphocytes were important molecu-\nlar mechanisms of T-cell activation induced by low-dose radiation. Among\nthe signal pathways involved, up-regulation of calcium/PKC signals occupy\na pivotal position in low-dose radiation-induced potentiation of lymphocyte\nproliferation. However, in the intact organism, cellular processes are influ-\nenced by systemic regulation, especially that from the neuroendocrine sys-\n2002). The present paper may be considered a continuation of the mechanis-\ntic analysis of the augmentation of lymphocyte proliferation in response to\nlow-dose radiation. The involvement of neuroendocrine factors in the signal\ntransduction pathways of lymphocyte activation and proliferation induced by\nlow-dose radiation is reviewed, with emphasis on the possible role of corti-\ncosteroids, melatonin, and catecholamines.\nCellular activities are regulated by intracellular signals initiated by stimu-\nlation from external and internal environment. Different signal pathways are\ninvolved in the initiation of different cellular functions. Lymphocyte prolif-\neration response to Con A is often used as a measure because this is the mi-\ntogen most studied in the research of activation and proliferation of murine\net al., 2003). The proliferative response of thymic and splenic T lymphocytes\nto Con A was measured by 3H-TdR incorporation. The dose\u00adeffect relation-\nship of the magnitude of DNA replication represented by incorporation of\n3H-TdR into lymphocytes after exposure to different concentrations of Con A\nranging from 2 to 30 \u00b5g/ml showed an inverted U-shaped curve (Figure 1,\nunpublished data).\nThe left panel of Figure 1 shows the dose\u00adresponse relationship of the\nproliferation of mouse thymocytes to 2\u00ad30 \u00b5g/ml of Con A, demonstrating a\npeak proliferation at a concentration of 15 \u00b5g/ml of Con A. The right panel\nof this figure shows the dose\u00adresponse relationship for the proliferation of\nmouse splenic T cells in the range 2\u00ad30 \u00b5g/ml of Con A, with the peak stimu-\nlation occurring at a concentration of 10 \u00b5g/ml of Con A. It should be noted\nthat the amplitude of the maximum stimulation in the case of splenic T lym-\nphocytes is much higher, doubling that of the response of thymocytes. It is\ninteresting to note that by addition of 5 \u00d7 10-12 M of corticosterone (CS),\na subphysiological concentration of the hormone (the physiological range\nbeing 10\u00ad30 \u00d7 10-8 M), the stimulating effect of different concentrations\nRadiation-Induced Change in Lymphocyte Proliferation 235\nFIGURE 1 Dose\u00adresponse curves of Con A\u00adinduced proliferation of thymic (left panel) and splenic\n(right panel) lymphocytes.

This concentration of Con A (5 \u00b5g/ml) is sub-\noptimal since the maximal stimulation of thymic and splenic lymphocytes\noccurred at the concentrations of 10 and 15 \u00b5g/ml, respectively, as shown in\nFIGURE 2 Dose\u00adresponse curves of Con A\u00adinduced proliferation of thymic (left panel) and splenic\n(right panel) lymphocytes in the presence of low-level CS. M \u00b1 SE, n = 3 for each dose point; in both\ncases the presence of CS 5 \u00d7 10-12 M in the culture further increased the lymphocyte proliferation\nIt has long been recognized that the hypothalamic\u00adpituitary\u00ad\nadrenocortical (HPA) axis has a profound influence on the regulation of\nthe immune system (Besedovsky and Sorkin, 1979; Besedovsky and Rey,\nexerts a (tonic) repression on the immune system, preventing its overac-\ntion, especially on the growth and function of the thymus (Hadden, 1998;\nSheridan et al., 1998). Hyperfunction of the HPA axis would lead to atrophy\nof the thymus and correspondingly suppression of immune functions. On\nthe other hand, a lowering of the hormonal level of the end organ of this\naxis (i.e, use of serum corticosteroids) would have an opposite effect. We\ntested this by adding different concentration of CS to cultured splenic and\nthymic lymphocytes in a medium containing 5 \u00b5g/ml Con A. It was found\nthat a concentration of corticosterone at 10-11 M would stimulate lympho-\ncyte proliferation and a concentration of corticosterone at 10-7 M would\nof the activities of the HPA axis after whole-body X-irradiation of mice with\n0.075 Gy, expressed as lowered serum concentrations of both ACTH and CS\n(Figure 4) (Liu et al., 1994b). It can be seen in this figure that the ACTH and\nCS levels decreased by more than 30 and 70%, respectively, 1 day after irra-\ndiation. The mRNA level of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC ) gene in the\nhypothalamus decreased early in the first few hours after low-dose radiation\n(inset at the upper right corner of Figure 4) (Wan and Liu, 1998). This change\nimplicates a down-regulation of the hypothalamic control of the hypophyseal\nFIGURE 3 Dose\u00adresponse curve of mouse thymic and splenic T lymphocyte proliferation after exposure\nto CS.

Consequently, there exists the possibility of increased bind-\ning of HSP with GCR after low-dose radiation, which would result in its\ndecreased entry into the nucleus. At the same time, low-dose radiation de-\ncreases the number of GCRs in splenic T cells whereas high-dose radiation\nincreases it (Figure 5) (Duan et al., 1992).

This coincides with\nthe up-regulation in CD3 expression and the rise of cGMP content in the\nthymocytes (Figure 6), and also with the decrease in serum CS level and cyto-\nchanges imply that intracellular calcium mobilization may act in concert with\nother intracellular signal molecules and neurohormonal changes induced by\nlow-dose radiation.\nBesides the immunoregulatory effect of the HPA axis, the pineal gland was\nfound to be an organ exerting profound influence on immunity (Pierpaoli,\nlow-dose radiation effects have demonstrated that the pineal gland might be\nan important regulator and melatonin an important signal molecule in the\nmechanism of low-dose radiation-induced hormesis (Liang et al., 1999). It\nwas found that whole-body X-irradiation with 0.075 Gy caused changes in the\npineal gland, including increases in DNA synthesis, decreases in apoptosis as\nwell as a rise of melatonin and cGMP content in the gland (Li et al., 2001,\n2002). In pinealectomized (with a laser beam) mice exposed to low-dose ra-\ndiation there was an elevation of serum CS (Figure 7) instead of the decrease\nobserved in intact mice exposed to low-dose radiation as shown in Figure 4.\nAt the same time, the proliferative capability of the thymocytes and splenic\nFIGURE 7 Effect of whole-body X-irradiation with 0.075 Gy on serum CS level in pinealectomized mice.\nMice were pinealectomized with a laser beam and whole-body X-irradiation was given 3 days after pinealec-\n72 h after irradiation. Serum samples (including those from sham-irradiated intact and pinealectomized\ncontrols) were kept at -70C before determination of CS content using competitive protein binding\nassay.\nT cells was markedly depressed after exposure of pinealectomized mice to\nlow-dose radiation. The replacement of melatonin in vivo (injection of mela-\ntonin to pinealectomized mice) or in vitro (addition of melatonin to cultured\nsplenic lymphocytes obtained from pinealectomized mice) could restore the\nincrease in proliferative response induced by low-dose radiation (Liang et al.,\nNEUROTRANSMITTERS\nThe influence of neurotransmitters studied includes the effect of\nacetylcholine and catecholamines. It is generally believed that epinephrine\n(E) and norepinephrine (NE) augment the activity of granulocytes while\nacetylcholine enhances the activity of T lymphocytes, since granulocytes bear\nadrenergic receptors whereas T cells bear cholinergic receptors (Abo and\nKawamura, 2002). Our experiments showed that acetylcholine increased the\nproliferation of normal T lymphocytes in a wide range of concentrations\n(1\u00ad533 \u00d7 10-9 M) and could further increase the already up-regulated T-cell\nproliferation induced by low-dose radiation in concentrations above 22 \u00d7\n10-9 M (Zhao et al., 1996).

If E+NE+CS\neach in a concentration of 10-10 M were added to thymocytes and splenic\nT cells from either normal or low-dose irradiated mice, the proliferative ac-\ntivity was stimulated to an even higher degree. The magnitude of augmen-\ntation of cell proliferation was higher than that induced by addition of the\nto cell cultures from normal as well as low-dose irradiated mice, as illus-\ntrated in Figure 9 (Liu et al., 1994a).
