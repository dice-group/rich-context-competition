    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe collect data on 15 reasons why people in the 27 EU countries engage in physical activity, from the European\nCommission's Special Eurobarometer. A graphical output was obtained using classical Principal Component Analysis\ntechniques in order to analyse types of motivation in the EU. Cluster Analysis method were used to define the\ninterrelationship between the data in the 27 countries. People in Sweden, Denmark and Finland were the most\nhighly motivated. High rates were detected in Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Estonia, Luxembourg and Latvia while\nlow rates were found in Bulgaria, Romania, Czech Republic, Greece, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal\nand Slovakia. The lowest motivation rates were in the Netherlands. Regarding the reasons for engaging in exercise\n(a sport or physical activity), we observed two motivation types. The first group was related to health and physical\nappearance while the second was associated with social reasons: to be with friends, to better integrate into society,\nto meet people from other cultures. For citizens of Latvia, Bulgaria and Romania, health and physical appearance\ncarried greater importance than the European average while for citizens of Germany, Finland and Sweden the\nsecond motivation type was higher than the European average.\n",

The World\nHealth Organization, (Bauman et al. 2005), recommended\nthat people engage in physically active daily.\nIn spite of the benefits of physical activity, most people\nin the European Union (E. U.) do not exercise, (defined\nas the deliberate performance of a physical activity that\nrequires exertion). Over 30% report that they seldom or\nnever engage in any physical activity and 25% are virtu-\nally inactive (European Commission, 2010). Research\nsuggests that up to 50% of people who start an exercise\nprogramme drop out within the first six months, (Wilson\n& Brookfield, 2009). Therefore, it is of interest to study\nwhat motivates people to exercise. This information would\nbe of useful to design strategies to encourage people to\nparticipate in and adherence to exercise programmes.\nPrevious studies have suggested that a better under-\nstanding of motivation would benefit initiatives to promote\nreviewed the range of demographic, biological, psycho-\nlogical, social, cultural and physical environment factors\nassociated with physical activity in adults.\nMotivation to exercise differs between stages of live\n(Allender et al. 2006). (children and adolescents, adults\nand elderly) and countries. It is not appropriate to base\nphysical activity recommendations for children and ado-\nlescents on evidence of morbidity and mortality; how-\never in this group proposing physical activity as a way\nto enhance social interaction would be suitable. During\nadulthood, there is a need to reduce premature risk fac-\ntors for a range of chronic diseases and conditions and\nto maintain an energy balance. Furthermore physical\nactivity has the potential to improve mental health. In\nthe elderly motivation to engage in physical activity may\nbe that it slows the ageing process and contributes to\nmaintaining functional capacity.\nEarly work on motivation for sport and exercise (Alderman\n& Wood, 1976) proposed that young athletes in Canada\nparticipated in sports for fitness, challenge and fun.\n(Williams & Cox, 2003) stated that the reasons for partici-\npation were linked to social prestige and status.

The role of appearance/weight, health/fitness\nand social engagement motives in exercise participation\nwas tested by (Markland & Ingledew, 2007; Ingledew &\nA theoretical approach to determining the motivation\nbehind participation in exercise and physical activity can\nbe found in (Gonz\u00e1lez-Cutre et al. 2010).\nIn the present study, we explored the reasons why\npeople in 27 European countries exercise and we propose\nstrategies for practical application of these data in the\nE. U. We used principal component analysis (PCA)\naccording to the different populations. Small distances\non the graph indicate similar populations, whereas large\ndistances show dissimilar populations in their motivation\nto exercise. This analysis allowed us to identify motiv-\national level differences between countries. For this pur-\npose, 15 variables corresponding to types of motivation\nto engage in sport or physical activity were considered\nfor each country. First, we classified the countries using\ncluster methods. We then plotted the output data for\nthese countries as points on a graph in a low-dimensional\nEuclidean space. Classical PCA was used to obtain the\nfinal graphical output.\nMethods\nReported cases\nThe data presented in this study were provided by the\nEuropean Commission (2010) and can be further fil-\ntered, tabulated, charted and downloaded. They are\navailable at: http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/\nebs/ebs_334_en.pdf. This information permit to repeat\nthe work.\nThe data analysed correspond to 27 European countries\nand one \"average\" country. The following 15 variables\nwere proposed as reasons to practice sport or engage in\nphysical activity: to improve health, to improve fitness,\nto relax, to have fun, to improve physical appearance, to\nimprove physical performance, to control weight, to be\nwith friends, to counteract the effects of ageing, to im-\nprove self-esteem, to develop new skills, for the spirit\nof competition, to make new acquaintances, to better\nintegrate into society and to meet people from other\ncultures.\nStatistical analysis\nAs the data (proportion of citizens in each country),\nwere obtained from large populations they can be con-\nsidered as random normally distributed variables.\nEach country and one \"average\" country was associated\nwith the n-dimensional random vector Xh\n,...,Xhn\n)\nwhere Xhi\nrepresents the proportion of citizens in the\ncountry h that have the motivation i = 1,...,n, to participate\nin sport or engage in physical activity (see \"Reported cases\"\nFor each country, we have a realization x = (x1,...,xn).\nThe distance between the population x = (x1,...,xn) and\ny = (y1,...,yn) is given by d \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nX\nn\nxi - yi\nv\nu\nu\nt .\nThe interdistance matrix D was used to obtain a graph-\nical output through taxonomic analysis. Similar objects\nwere grouped into clusters (subsets of a set of objects); two\nclusters may be separate. On the basis of the distance be-\ntween pairs of objects, the distance between the new cluster\nand all other objects was defined. We used the unweighted-\npair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA).\nPCA was performed using the distances obtained. This\nmethod represents a set of points in n-dimensional space\nby a subspace of smaller dimensions. The main purpose\nis to reduce the data from a large number of variables\nto a smaller number of components, there by facilitat-\ning the detection of similarities and differences between\nthe countries.\nStatistical significance was set at p < .05. All analyses were\nconducted using the (SPSS Statistical Package version 17.0\n2009; Statgraphics\u00ae Centurion, STATGRAPHICS\u00ae Centurion\nResults\nThe PCA is summarised in Table 1. All coefficients of\nthe principal components and all eigenvalues are shown.\nThe inertia percentages accounted for by the first two\naxes were 60.4% and 8.9%. These components explained\nmore than 69% of the total variation. The first compo-\nnent was the \"size\", with all coefficients positive, and it\nrepresents the overall motivation. In the second compo-\nnent, the coefficients corresponding to improving health,\nincreasing fitness, having fun, looking better, boosting\nphysical performance, controlling weight and counteracting\nthe effects of ageing were negative, while the rest (to\nrelaxing, being with friends, improving self-esteem, de-\nveloping new skills, exercising the spirit of competition,\nmaking new acquaintances, better integrating into so-\nciety, meeting people from other cultures) were posi-\ntive. These observations highlight two types of motivation\nto engage in sport or physical activity, the first related\nto health and physical appearance and the second asso-\nciated with social reasons. This component takes large\nvalues for countries where social reasons are more im-\nportant and small values for countries where reasons\nrelated to health and physical appearance are more im-\nportant. The two-dimensional display obtained is shown\nin Figure 1.\nThe first PCA component was positive (indicating\nglobally higher motivation to exercise) in 8 countries\n(Sweden, Germany, Finland, Austria, Germany, Estonia,\nLuxembourg, Slovenia and Latvia; from highest to lowest)\nand negative (indicating a globally lower motivation to\nexercise) in 12 countries (the Netherlands, Bulgaria,\nRomania, the Czech Republic, Greece, Spain, Hungary,\nItaly, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Slovakia; from\nhighest to lowest). The second PCA component was\npositive (indicating greater importance of social motives\nto exercise) in 3 countries (Germany, Finland and Sweden;\nfrom highest to lowest) and negative (indicating higher\nmotivation to exercise related to health and physical ap-\npearance) in 3 countries (Latvia, Bulgaria and Romania;\nfrom highest to lowest).\nOn the basis of the tree reconstructed by UPGMA\n(Figure 2) and Figure 1, we identified seven population\ngroups:\nGroup I: Denmark, Finland and Sweden.\nGroup II: Austria, Germany, Estonia, Luxembourg\nand Slovenia.\nGroup III: Latvia.\nGroup IV: Belgium, Republic of Cyprus, France,\nIreland, Malta, The United Kingdom and\nthe \"average\" country.\nGroup V: The Czech Republic, Greece, Spain, Hungary,\nItaly, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Slovakia.\nGroup VI: The Netherlands.\nGroup VII: Bulgaria and Romania.\nTable 1 Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the correlation\nmatrix for 15 measurements of percentages of the\nreasons for exercising in 27 European countries and one\naverage country\nReasons for exercising First Second\nBE\nBG\nCZ\nDK\nDE\nEE\nIE\nEL\nES\nFR\nIT\nCY\nLV\nLT\nLU\nHU\nMT\nNL\nAT\nPL\nPT\nRO\nSI\nSK\nFI\nSE\nUK\nUE\nFigure 1 Two-dimensional graphical display of 27 European countries and one average country, based on the PCA.

Countries included in Groups VI and VII had\nthe lowest values for the first component, thereby indi-\ncating the lowest motivation to engage in physical activ-\nity. The countries with near-average values for the first\ncomponent are in Group IV, suggesting that these coun-\ntries were in the mid-range.\nFor the second component, the largest values corre-\nsponded to Group I and the lowest to Group III while\nmoderately high values corresponded to Group V. Group IV\ncountries showed high motivation although the second\ncomponent was close to zero.\nDiscussion\nHere we examined the reasons why citizens in the E. U.\nengage in sport and physical activity. A graphical repre-\nsentation of the percentage of the populations with a spe-\ncific motive to exercise was used to plot the data for the\nvarious countries. This approach was useful because all\ncoefficients of the first component clearly represented\nthe \"size\", i.e., the overall reasons for engaging in sport\nor physical activity. The second axis had 7 negative and\n8 positive components. This axis represented the type\nof motivation, i.e. the populations of countries repre-\nsented by points whose second component had a high\npositive value were considered to be highly motivated\nby health and physical appearance. Conversely when the\ncoordinates of the points had a second component with\na lower this was interpreted as indicating population\nhighly motivated to engage in sport and physical activity\nfor social reasons. The taxonomic method was used to\ngroup the countries.\nOur findings reveal that the types of motivation vary\nbetween E. U. countries. On the basis of the tree and\nprincipal component representation, the Nordic countries:\nDenmark, Finland and Sweden showed the largest propor-\ntion of citizens motivated to engage in sport or physical\nactivity and this motivation was social. Latvia showed high\nmotivation reasons being related mainly to health and\nphysical appearance. In contrast the Netherlands showed\nthe lowest motivated population and the driving reasons\nto engage in exercise were mainly of a social nature. A low\nproportion of the people in Bulgaria and Romania were\nmotivated for exercise and those that did engage in this\nactivity were driven by reasons mainly associated with\nhealth and physical appearance.\nThe countries comprising Group I (Nordic countries)\nwere found to be the most physically active in the\nE. U. Less than 20% of the population of these countries\nreport never exercising or engaging in sport (European\nCommission 2010). This finding is explained by the\nfact that these countries are the most motivated with\nregard to exercise. Group V and Group VII counties are\nreported to have the fewest citizens engaging in sport\nor exercise, as confirmed by these countries showing\nthe lowest motivation to exercise. It therefore follows\nthat countries with high proportion of motivated citi-\nzens engage in more physical activity and sport than\nthe \"average\" country and those whose populations show\nlittle interest in physical activity are less active than\n\"average\" country.\nDistance\nBE\nBG\nCZ\nDK\nDE\nEE\nIE\nEL\nES\nFR\nIT\nCY\nLV\nLT\nLU\nHU\nMT\nNL\nAT\nPL\nPT\nRO\nSI\nSK\nFI\nSE\nUK\nUE\nDendogram plot\nFigure 2 Cluster analysis using UPGMA method and classification of groups by to engage in sport and physical activity: Group I: DK:\nDenmark, FI: Finland and SE: Sweden, Group II: AT: Austria, DE: Germany, EE: Estonia, LU: Luxembourg and SI: Slovenia.

Group VI: NL:\nThe Netherlands. Group VII: BG: Bulgaria and RO: Romania.\nThe countries in Groups II and IV were highly motivated\nto exercise and were driven mainly by reasons of health\nand physical appearance. In Figure 1 these countries are lo-\ncated in quadrant IV, having the following coordinates;\npositive abscissa and negative ordinate. A greater pro-\nportion of their populations engaged in sport and phys-\nical activity than the \"average\" country.\nGroup V countries showed low motivation to exercise\nhowever, those exercising reported motivation linked to\nsocial interactions. In Figure 1 these countries are located\nin quadrant II, having the following coordinates; negative\nabscissa and positive ordinate. A lower proportion of their\npopulations engaged in sport and physical activity lower\nthan the \"average\" country.\nOn the basis of all these observations, we can deduce\nthat the motivations related to health and physical ap-\npearance is more decisive for physical activity. However,\nthere are some exceptions.\nIn the Netherlands a low proportion of the population\nwas motivated to engage in sport and physical activity\nhowever, curiously, this population is among the most\nphysically active as only 28% report never engaging in\nsport or physical activity. People (73%) in the Netherlands\nexpressed satisfaction with local councils regarding sports\nand exercise provision and report a high degree of satis-\nfaction with their local sports clubs, which are particu-\nlarly popular.\nThe people in Latvia were found to be highly motivated\nhowever, a proportion of citizens, more than average of\nthe E. U. reported never taking any exercise. This finding\ncould be attributed to the poor economic situation of\nthe country and consequently of its people.\nBulgaria and Romania are the two countries that most\nrecently joined the E. U. People in these countries show\nlittle inclination to engage in sport and physical activity\nand motivation was essentially related to health and the\nregulation of energy expenditure. A relatively high pro-\nportion of citizens, more than average of E. U. reported\nnever engaging in physical exercise. This finding is\nexplained by the lack of opportunities to be physically\nactive and to socio-economical limitations.\nConclusions\nIt is widely accepted in the E. U. that sport and physical\nactivity contribute to health. We show that in most E. U.\ncountries there is a link between health and the motiv-\nation to keep physically fit and active. Exceptionally, in\nthe Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland and Sweden most\npeople have a strong social motivations to exercise and a\nhigh proportion of the people in these countries do more\nphysical exercise than the E. U. average.\nPeople in the Netherlands lack motivation to exercise\nand when they do engage in this activity it is essentially\nfor social reasons. Therefore its inhabitants engage in less\nsport and physical activity than the E. U. average.\nBulgaria and Romania show low motivation. People in\nthese countries report being motivated by health issues\nand are physically more inactive than E. U. average.\nOne of the main objectives of the article; to present a\nlarge number of data in summary form without sacri-\nficing too much information, has been achieved and also\naims to encourage future researchers to present informa-\ntion accompanied by methods of summary representation.\nOthers detailed socio-demographic information to help\nunderstand the reasons why sections of European society\n(gender, age, education levels, ..), engage in sport and\nphysical activity. But this should be analyzed by each\ncountry, and is outside the scope of this study.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nDR reviewed the literature, performed data base search and drafted the early\nversion of the manuscript.
