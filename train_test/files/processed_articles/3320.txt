This critical engagement was supported through a\nnew elective course that set out to encourage a bridging\nbetween theoretical and practical components of early pro-\nfessional development (EPD). Establishing a stronger link\nto the cognitive aspects of EPD while also helping student\nteachers to engage meaningfully and critically with the\nsocial and relational influences in schools, underpinned\nthe elective course.\nSome Key Issues in the Literature\nITE and Developing Approaches to Behavior\nIn today's classrooms, increasing narratives of derision in the\nmedia and in policy rhetoric, within the UK and beyond,\naround poor pupil behavior (Gillies, 2011; O'Neill &\nStephenson, 2012) have led to calls for changes in the ways in\nwhich teachers deal with discipline issues. Yet, until recently,\nwe had limited knowledge about the problems that teachers\nface at the beginning of their career in relation to behavior\nand whether support within ITE merely focused on immedi-\nate survival through application of rules and sanctions or on\nspecific behavior approaches. ITE providers may focus on\npromoting traditional behaviorist outlooks (Atici, 2007; Ben-\nO'Neill & Stephenson, 2012), but in some cases, this may\nmean little happens at the program level as student teachers\nmay be thought to gain behavior management skills while in\nplacement schools through experienced teacher modeling and\npractice in classrooms (Hammerness, 2011). In other con-\ntexts, a more humanist approach to behavior may form a\nsmall element within a larger Teacher Education program, but\nthis may be in contrast to the tendency toward behaviorist\nmodels used in schools (Hamilton, in press; Riddell, 2006).\nEmerging concern around student teacher development\nand behavior in classrooms has increased in the past 5 years\nacross a wide range of national contexts (Atici 2007; Barker,\nMcNally, I'anson, Whewell, & Wilson, 2005; Wubbels,\nEconomic Co-operation and Development's (OECD)\nresearch into teaching and learning across 23 countries found\nthat concerns around behavior were evident in most head\n1University of Edinburgh, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nLorna Hamilton, School of Education, University of Edinburgh, Holyrood\nRoad, Edinburgh, EH8 8AQ, UK.\nEmail: Lorna.Hamilton@ed.ac.uk\n\"Silence Does Not Sound the Same for\nEveryone\": Student Teachers' Narratives\nAround Behavior Management in Scottish\nSchools\nLorna Hamilton1\n2 SAGE Open\nteacher responses and was a concern while teachers them-\nselves were seeking help in approaching behavior manage-\nment. This underpins the significance of behavior as a key\nissue at an international level in schools and within ITE.\nApproaches taken to this aspect of teaching practice may\nvary greatly across institutions and even within countries:\nBen-Peretz et al. (2011) found that in Israel, a traditional\napproach dominated ITE, while Stough (2006) found that\nonly about 30% of such programs in the United States pro-\nvided courses on behavior at all within ITE. There is no real\nconsensus on how best to prepare student teachers for behav-\nioral issues in schools, and a strong suggestion is that either\nthe responsibility for this aspect of EPD is placed within\nschool placement experience and modeling taking place\nthere or specific behaviorist and/or humanist perspectives\nare taken in ITE. The latter provision is often regarded by\nstudents as too abstract and not sufficiently practical or\ntive role that behavior and misbehavior play in poor teacher\nself-efficacy and lack of persistence within the profession\nimpact that lack of preparedness can have on new teachers.\nIn addition, Van Tartwijk and Hammerness (2011) highlight\nthe significance of classroom management competence as\nwell as clarity of expectations and quality of feedback as\nways in which teachers can have a marked impact upon pupil\noutcomes, and consequently, they argue, that classroom\nmanagement should play a much more substantial role within\nteacher education. Questions then are raised over the shape\nthat any learning around behavior management should take\nwithin ITE and how this might articulate with school place-\nment experiences.\nComplex national and local policy and institutional\n(school) approaches to behavior may chime or challenge stu-\ndent teachers. Situated within schools, preservice learning\noccurs within such policy umbrellas and via conversations\nand dialogues with experienced colleagues (Avalos, 2011). It\nis also helpful to acknowledge the significance of schools\nand teacher approaches to behavior and relationships in the\nclassroom for pupil engagement or deviance from any norms\nin place. The power imbalance inherent in this schooling\ncontext between teacher and pupil (student), as well as stu-\ndent teacher and experienced teacher, underlines the need to\nengage critically with the ways in which teachers approach\nbehavior and relationships in the classroom and the role that\nteacher education may play in supporting early teacher\nITE input and school experience are often seen as com-\nplementary elements helping to shape student teacher prac-\ntice and understanding, two connected but separate entities.\nYet, the possible conflicts within and across these spaces in\nrelation to behavior and building relationships with young\npeople have seen relatively little research (Atici, 2007).\nConsequently, there is insufficient evidence with regard to\nthe ways in which ITE institutions can best provide support\nso that student teachers can establish a strong foundation for\nfuture development in working with young people across\nthese two spaces while dealing with the possible conflict that\nmay arise in terms of teaching practice, beliefs, and values.\nWithin ITE, the perennial theory\u00adpractice divide chal-\nlenges teacher educators to find ways to engage with student\nteachers meaningfully to enhance learning and the synthesis\nof theoretical frameworks and practice. Some would argue\nthat to begin to do so, there is a need to conceptualize the\njourney of student teachers (preservice teachers) as narra-\ntives (Hamilton & Pinnegar, 2000), reflecting, at times, con-\nflicting metaphors of teachers and teaching (Bullough &\nsection, consideration is given to the role of narrative in con-\nceptualizing and understanding student teacher EPD.\nNarratives of Student Teachers\nThe narratives of student teachers and their visions of what\nbeing a teacher means play an important role in the teaching\nand learning experiences of those in schools (Schultz &\nRavitch, 2013). Narrative identity theory provides a helpful\nconceptual frame here to view identity formation and refor-\nmation as well as the complexity of individual \"webs of\nThese webs comprise the myriad narratives of the indi-\nvidual and at any one time one or more strands may hold\nparticular prominence for the student teacher, highlighting\nsome and sidelining others. This represents a complex inter-\naction between different aspects of the self and the falseness\nof attempts to separate the personal and the professional.\nIn using narrative identity here, the emphasis is placed on\nthe embeddedness of the individual within relationships and\nexperiences, within a multilayered and highly fluid telling\nand retelling of who we are. There are narratives of mother,\nof teacher, of belonging to community and nation and to\nmetanarratives of, for example, social justice and inclusion.\nThe personal and professional are not then able to be dislo-\ncated from the web of narratives and myriad interlocutions\ntaking place. Yet, by engaging with the narratives that stu-\ndent teachers tell as they attempt to make sense of teacher\neducation experiences in relation to past and future selves\nand within policy and metanarrative contexts, we may be\nable to more clearly understand how a sense of teacher self\nmay evolve and be supported (Hamilton, 2011). Within this\ncontinual process of becoming, some narratives may hold\ngreater sway than others at any given time and, as Taylor\n(1992) argues, \"there may be changes to the web but there is\nstill a dependence on the web of interlocution\" (p. 39).\nIn a previous study (Hamilton, in press), the author high-\nlighted the narrowing of focus, by some student teachers, on\nnarratives of survival and compliance in response to social\nand relational influences of teaching practice. The difficul-\nties faced by the students in trying to deal with behavior in\nclassrooms often created a degree of dissonance between\nHamilton 3\nschool values and beliefs and those of the student teacher.\nThe dominance of the powerful narrative of experienced\nteachers in positions of power meant that survival and com-\npliance involved echoing the existing approaches, as mod-\neled by teachers in schools. Given the multiplicity of models,\nstudent teachers were likely to superficially reflect contra-\ndictory approaches to behavior but were not necessarily able\nto engage with beliefs and values or broader ideas and texts\non behavior, weakening the possible influences on the narra-\ntive web.\nWe know that student teacher stories of being and becom-\ning a teacher and the beliefs and values that inform their atti-\ntudes within these stories are crucial in forming and reforming\nprofessional identity (Bullough & Baughman, 1997; Johnson,\nstudent teachers' own lived experiences as learners, have a\ntendency to persist even in the face of conflict with ITE pro-\ngram teaching and, despite any conflict arising between\ninternal beliefs and external input (Sternberg, 1999).\nMcNally et al. (2005) highlight the tendency for student\nteachers to build their budding professional identity on social\nand relational connections to their past, present, and future\nselves and to their practicum colleagues. However, it is\nimportant to note that the latter colleagues are perhaps more\nlikely to have an impact than teacher educators on shifting\nstances in relation to beliefs and values--at least on a tempo-\nrary basis (McNally et al., 2005). Cognition is less likely to\nbe enhanced to the same extent and so finding ways to\nencourage a greater balance between the emotional and rela-\ntional aspects of teacher education experience and a more\nactive engagement with cognitive elements would appear to\nbe helpful if we are to encourage critical and reflective prac-\ntice in relation to behavior.\nResearch suggests that we should not ignore or minimize\nthe significance of teacher beliefs and values (Bullough &\nengagement with or disengagement from ITE provision and\nschool experiences. For student teachers to more fruitfully\nengage critically with their current beliefs and values while\nattempting to evaluate possible alternative or extended mod-\nels of thinking around behavior, it is argued here, that ITE\nshould not favor particular approaches to behavior but\ninstead should engage with conflicting stances and models,\nvia role-play, discussion, and debate, encouraging internal\ncognitive dissonance within the student teacher to be\nacknowledged and articulated (Hamilton, 2006). By this I\nmean, encouraging engagement with conflicting beliefs, atti-\ntudes, and values to bring about cognitive dissonance\napproach is somewhat at odds with other researchers who\nargue that the personal and professional are separate\n(Korthagen, 2004) and any friction between the two should\nbe avoided.\nThe prevailing student teacher approach to behavior dur-\ning a previous project (Hamilton, in press) had highlighted a\nstudent teacher emphasis on looking to models for behavior\nwithin schools coupled with a trial and error approach to\nbehavior underpinned by a vital survival instinct--an\nacknowledged aspect of early professional learning (Feiman-\nNemser, 1983). This led to a struggle between compliance\nwith the dominant school models or resistance and adher-\nence to personal beliefs and values. As a result, in this proj-\nect, emphasis has been placed on the importance of\nstrengthening links between theory and practice through,\ngenerating dissonance to make implicit beliefs explicit,\nengaging student teachers in a critical selection and review\nof significant moments from teaching practice. Within this\nprocess, the ITE program does not want to sell a particular\ndiscipline agenda but instead, student teachers are encour-\naged to \"try on\" different approaches bearing in mind the\nconstraints and opportunities in individual schools. One size\ndoes not fit all, and students may build hybrid models of\nengagement with young people. Through commentary on\ntheir work, presentations, and challenge in conjunction with\nthe previous work outlined, student teachers are supported in\nclarifying their choices, making sense of outcomes, and\nthrowing light on the relationships between their own beliefs\nand values and their emerging professional choices in rela-\ntion to practice.\nBullough and Baughman (1997) argue that student teacher\nbeliefs about teaching and the metaphors used by them have\na key role to play in their development as professionals.\nFreese (2006) reinforces the role of reflection and inquiry\nand sees these as a means of constructing meaningful stories\nand engaging student teachers with deeper learning. Thus,\nthe student teachers participating in this study were located\nwithin a course that focused on activities and experiences\nthat encouraged possible cognitive dissonance, explicit artic-\nulation of beliefs and values, and critical reflection.\nApproaching the Study\nImmediate Context of the Course on Behavior\nStudent teachers created reflective commentaries around,\n\"significant moments,\" choosing events/observations to\ndescribe and analyze as a result of a value judgment made by\nthe individual (Tripp, 1993). The focus of such moments was\nto do with relationships (negative or positive), behavior pol-\nicy, and practice issues focused on teacher\u00adpupil relation-\nships: These could involve observation of other staff or\nstudent teacher own practice or could sometimes be a mix-\nture of both.\nActivities were generated on the course that encouraged\ncognitive dissonance in individuals (Hamilton, in press). For\nexample, media takes on behavior in schools are often writ-\nten with different kinds of bias depending on the political\nstance of the newspaper. Students working in groups would\nhave to immerse themselves in the newspaper article and\ncome prepared to defend and debate that particular stance\n4 SAGE Open\nwith other groups who represented conflicting stances. A\nreflective exercise afterward then encouraged student teach-\ners to consider the dissonance or discomfort felt as a result of\nthe exercise and its significance. In this work, engagement\nwith student teacher tacit beliefs about behavior and pupils\n(school students) was an important element as we know that\nsuch beliefs tend to persist within the individual, even in the\nface of teacher education experiences (Bullough &\nsuch beliefs explicit and available for discussion and chal-\nlenge was important to encourage a more in-depth engage-\nment with diverse views. Similar experiences were achieved\nthrough the use of contrasting behavior expert views, critiqu-\ning videotapes of diverse teaching approaches, and role-play\nwithin workshops. It is important to note that this course did\nnot set out to sell or inculcate a particular view of behavior\nmanagement, but instead shared diverse views and acknowl-\nedged that each student's engagement with these different\nperspectives and theories would be unique.\nMethod\nThe wider context for this project was a 1-year program of\nteacher education (secondary-level PGDE) lasting 36 weeks\nat a Scottish University: 18 of these weeks were spent on\nplacements in schools interwoven across the year--in 6\nweekly segments. Diverse schools were drawn upon includ-\ning private schools, those with a predominantly middle class\nintake, deprived urban schools, and rural schools across\nmany different Local Authority2 areas, and these were likely\nto take diverse approaches to behavior. Student teachers have\nthe opportunity to opt in to a small number of elective courses\nand 22 out of a program total of 150 chose to specialize in\nbehavior. Course participants came from a variety of disci-\nplines including mathematics, geography and English. Two\nstudents volunteered (self-selection) to be the focus of case\nstudies: They were both training to be English teachers.\nResearch questions. To meet the aims of the study, the follow-\ning research questions were developed:\nResearch Question 1: What are the key narratives under-\npinning two preservice teacher professional identity\n(re) formations during a significant transition period in\ntheir EPD?\nResearch Question 2: In what ways, if any, can the use of\n\"significant moments\" and the creation of dissonance,\nencourage engagement on a cognitive level with this\nessential component of the professional role of\nteachers?\nA qualitative approach was chosen as the focus was\nstrongly fixed on the personal journeys and narratives of stu-\ndent teachers and the belief that it is through understanding\nthese more fully that we can begin to make informed choices\nabout deeper learning and theory/practice divides (Hamilton\n& Corbett-Whittier, 2013). Within this paradigm, instrumen-\ntal case studies were chosen as the most appropriate as such\nstudies attempt to capture an issue or aspect of a case rather\nthan the case in its entirety (Hamilton & Corbett-Whittier,\ndata collection tools as well as diverse perspectives (op cit),\nand in this project, the following tools and perspectives were\ndrawn upon. The two student teachers, Annie and Will, pro-\nvided reflective commentaries from each school placement\n(significant moments) as well as one piece of extended writ-\ning and a final interview.Ateacher educator element (Author)\ninvolved a tutor journal, capturing discussions and reflec-\ntions with all 22 student teachers on this course as well as\nconcerns and dilemmas around the course or student issues\nwith school experience. Student teacher experiences on the\ncourse and in schools and their charting of these journeys\norally and in writing provided an important aspect of Annie\nand Will's experiences. The teacher educator journal, chart-\ning and reflecting on these activities, provides a helpful\nbackground to both case studies. This presents some research\nperspectives with a challenge as the teacher educator (TE)\nresearcher and student teachers were in a fluid, connected,\nand negotiated relationship that does not attempt to argue for\nobjectivity and separation/distance between researcher and\nresearched. Instead, our mutual subjectivities were made\nexplicit through the course activities and challenged and\nreflected upon throughout.\nSo in summary, this research involved a teacher educator\njournal component in conjunction with a course focusing on\nsupporting critical engagement with diverse approaches to\nbehavior and active participation of student teachers as they\nengaged with the course and school experiences and their\nown emerging teacher research personas. Student teacher\ndata came from Annie and Will through reflective commen-\ntaries (\u00d73 after each 6-week placement in schools), one piece\nof extended writing, charting the journey made across school\nplacements, and their evolving approach to behavior--writ-\nten after second placement, and finally individual interviews\nlasting 1.5 hr at the end of the course.\nTriangulation and approach to analysis.Triangulation was\nachieved via data collection and perspective: Diverse data\ncollection tools were used, and student teacher and tutor per-\nspectives were explored. This enhances the trustworthiness\nof the data (Hamilton & Corbett-Whittier, 2013; Patton,\n2002) and emphasizes the importance of exploring the cases\nin-depth and searching for rich accounts of evolving profes-\nsionalism. Reinforcing the trustworthiness of the research\nand analysis, member checking was used throughout data\ncollection processes and a colleague was also involved in\nindependently working on emerging and developing\ncategories.\nHowever, it has to be acknowledged, that there is limited\nbreadth especially as the two case study students were both\nHamilton 5\nen route to becoming English teachers. A future study will\nattempt to attain a balance between the two elements through\na small cohort study and will also extend work to student\nteachers working at primary/elementary level. A further limi-\ntation for case study lies in its lack of generalizability, but\nthis is countered by Pollard (quoted in Hamilton & Corbett-\nWhittier, 2013) by his argument that, in subtle ways,\ncase study research can produce a resonance for those in similar\ncontexts, with similar issues, providing insights to help them\nunderstand, more fully, the nature of their own problems.\nThe stance taken here is that such a resonance is what is\nsought by the use of case study in this project. I would argue\nthat in qualitative research, especially case study, it is not the\nsize of case or number of cases that is important. Instead it is\nthe appropriateness of the choice of case, the quality of the\nresearch process and the richness of the data and the insights\nthat can be gained, which are forefronted. Bassey (1999)\nwould be one of the first to criticize the use of unqualified\ngeneralizations from small studies; however, he acknowl-\nedges that there is value in what he calls fuzzy generalization\nas opposed to the statistical notion of generalization in quan-\ntitative research. He argues that\nFuzzy generalization arises from studies of singularities and\ntypically claims that it is possible, or likely, or unlikely that what\nwas found in the singularity will be found in similar situations\nelsewhere: It is a qualitative measure. (Bassey, 1999, p. 12)\nthe subtle ways in which case study research can produce a\nresonance for those in similar contexts, with similar issues,\nproviding insights to help them understand more, fully, the\nnature of their own problems. (Hamilton & Corbett-Whittier,\nIn this way, looking at qualitative research in general and\ncase study in particular, no claim is being made for a trans-\nformation of understanding but instead for a refinement of\nunderstanding (Stake, 1995, p. 7). Here is the strength of\nqualitative work, in that it can provide insights into and\ndeeper understanding of the complex experiences and inter-\nactions of student teachers that can have potential impor-\ntance for others working in this area and does not rely on a\nparticular sample size when considering how worthwhile it\nmight be. The value of this kind of research is underpinned\nby the validity and trustworthiness of the research process\nand findings: supported by triangulation of data collection\nmethod and perspective as well as the use of member check-\ning during the research process.\nAnalysis was ongoing throughout the project and each\nstage of the project allowed for analysis and feedback to the\nstudent teachers and so member checking was an integral\nmeans of verifying and challenging the analysis process and\nthe findings. Key strategies in the analysis of the data, ini-\ntially, involved drawing on themes that might hold resonance\nfor this aspect of teacher narratives in previous research\n(Hamilton, in press) such as\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The attribution of blame for poor behavior\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Teacher role creating or challenging good behavior/\npoor behavior\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Conceptualization of teacher identity and purpose\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Power and control\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Compliance with dominant discourses\nThis previous work had involved a pilot study of a cohort\nof student teachers and aimed to begin to understand the pos-\nsible issues that might face emerging professionals in rela-\ntion to behavior. This led to the emergence of sensitizing\nthemes to begin to engage with the data. These themes were\nused as a preliminary means of beginning to sort and analyze\ndata but with the intention of being open to new raw catego-\nries being found that might challenge or even overturn par-\nticular themes. A toing and froing across the data allowed the\nfinal themes of each case study to be ratified through a return\nto the data and independent verification but also through\nmember checking during the research process.\nEthics.It cannot be denied that there were ethical issues\ninherent in this kind of approach where the tutor who grades\nfinal assignments is also the researcher and researched. The\npower imbalance is intrinsic to the institution and the official\nrelationship between tutor and tutee. However, I was keen to\nensure that student teachers understood that diverse views\nwere expected and one particular stance with regard to\nbehavior was not considered the answer. Although I estab-\nlished explicitly my own views on behavior, I was also care-\nful to share my view that there were many successful\napproaches to behavior and that part of this professional\njourney involved them exploring these approaches and\nschool experiences critically while also reflecting on and\nchallenging their own beliefs about children and childhood.\nIn this way, student teachers could feel that they had the free-\ndom to choose and would not be considered wrong if it\ndiverged from the views of the tutor (Hamilton & Corbett-\nWhittier, 2013). Student teachers were also encouraged to\nsuggest particular dilemmas and/or texts that had relevance\nfor them and to lead the group in critically examining these\nissues. The blurring of these boundaries between research,\nresearchers, and researched is viewed as a strength as it\nencourages a negotiated research experience, a mutuality\nthat can enhance learning and understanding for all partici-\npants. National (Scottish Educational Research Association\n[SERA], 2005) and institutional guidelines were followed\nand this involved ensuring that participation was voluntary\nand that anonymity would be provided in the tutor's journal\n6 SAGE Open\nand reflections while pseudonyms were used for the two case\nstudy student teachers.\nPolicy context of the case study. The importance of behavior\nin schools is recognized at policy level in Scotland, where in\nthe past 10 years, there has been increased funding for posi-\ntive behavior programs and facilities. Munn's policy update\ninsight into the perceptions of behavior in schools and\nresponses to it. Such work highlights the significance of\npolicy-level emphasis on the building of positive relation-\nships, and the increasing interest in Restorative practices as\na humanist rather than behaviorist model emerging in\nschools, although Riddell's paper (2006) suggests a more\ncomplex and tension-laden issue for individuals within\nschools. In her paper, she notes the apparent embracing of\nhumanist approaches is more likely within primary schools\nin Scotland (5-12-year olds) but that a male-dominated dis-\ncourse of control and compliance focusing on rules, sanc-\ntions, and punishment is more likely to hold sway within\nsecondary environments (12-18-year olds) despite govern-\nment innovations.\nFindings\nTeacher Educator Overview\nAll student teachers from this course focusing on behavior\nset out their own aspirations at the beginning of the post-\ngraduate teacher education year suggesting their own con-\nceptualizations of the teacher they were going to become.\nThe terms used, provided some insights into the kind of\nteaching metaphor they might be echoing. At this early stage,\ndescriptions focused on the specialist knowledge of the indi-\nvidual preservice teachers and so subject content knowledge\nheld sway but a small number of student teachers suggested\nother aspects of the professional--the rebel educator and the\ncreative educator. At this stage, too, early on in this intensive\n1-year program, aspirational elements suggested the idealis-\ntic with the use of terms such as caring, supportive, liberal in\nthinking, could change lives, working for education and\nequity, and empowerment of pupils. Yet, as we began to\nexamine how these student teachers related to behavior as a\nclassroom component, the language of control began to\nemerge from many.\nI'm not scared to give out punishments.\nThey have to understand that I am the law.\nI want to be strict--they have to know who's in control.\nHere the emphasis was on the teacher as the authority fig-\nure with right of enforcement of certain rules of behavior.\nFor other student teachers, understanding young people and\nencouraging them to engage positively with the rules came to\nthe fore at this early prepractice stage. Using words and\nphrases such as\nFair, consistent, just\nGetting to know young people, understanding pupils\nI want to be relaxed/innovative\nBut not too soft\nShow them respect and they'll respect you, they'll follow\nthe rules\nAlmost all suggested a vision requiring compliance with\nthe rules and sought pupil acquiescence either through strict\nadherence to rules or through a more relaxed engagement\nwith and application of rules.\nAs they moved through school experience, many began to\nexhibit concern for the social and relational aspects of school\nexperience, desperate to fit in and ready to allow experienced\nteacher prejudices and assumptions to be the template to sur-\nvive within this assessed experience. For some this created\nreal quandaries, especially if they had had professional aspi-\nrations that looked beyond control.\nBuilding trust within the course, students began to\nbecome more frank about their own beliefs and their concerns\nwith more humanist approaches. The power of colleagues'\noften more behaviorist approaches in schools held particular\ninfluence over student teachers and a real internal struggle\nemerged as student teachers felt there was a demand to sim-\nply \"copy\" the model/approach taken by teachers in schools.\nHowever, brief input at program level in the university was\nthought to simply polarize views on behavior.\nThey [PGDE program] make you feel that the only way to deal\nwith behavior involves a humanist approach, restorative\npractices but what if that's not you? (Tutor notes quoting student\nfrom cohort)\nThe competing narratives calling to student teachers, cre-\nated real tension as they struggled with the need to comply\nwith university-based approaches to behavior to \"play the\ngame\" and pass the course. A similar degree of compliance\nwas sought within the school contexts (often behaviorist in\nnature) where student teachers were also assessed. The vul-\nnerability of student teachers to power imbalances (Lasky,\n2005) is substantial at this time and within this vital transi-\ntion highlights the possible pragmatic nature of the choices\nmade around behavior approaches.\nHaving used sensitizing themes as well as themes emerg-\ning from the data to grasp the key elements of the case, the\ndata are presented in relation to each case individually,\nreflecting the narrative identity work in which the research is\nsituated. The use of extended quotes is deliberate, to share\nthe nature of the narratives in the participant's own words.\nDeveloped critical consideration of the data is then taken up\nin the discussion section.\nHamilton 7\nAnnie's Journey--Annie's Case Study: Narratives\nof Rebellion and Compassion\nAnnie was by nature a little bit of a rebel who would question\nthe status quo or dominant narrative. She was determined to\nlisten to other viewpoints but was prepared, then, to chal-\nlenge these and to find her \"own way\" to being a teacher. She\ndidn't want to reflect a particular model of teaching. Annie\nhad been adopted and had escaped a potentially difficult\nfamily setup and this seemed to inform her desire to under-\nstand young people and their varied and sometimes dysfunc-\ntional home backgrounds. She was also a volunteer with\ndifferent groups for example with a group for women who\nhad been abused and for those who had learning difficulties\nand so she held a strong advocate stance in the face of injus-\ntice or inequity. In her early 20s, Annie was idealistic and\nwarmhearted with a passion for her subject area and she\napproached her first placement school with anticipation.\nHowever, her first school was a private one and there seemed\nto be limited scope for active behavior strategies. The strong\nconsensus generated by the nature of the institution\nthe narratives of parents, pupils, and teachers tended to com-\nplement each other. The school had suggested to her that her\nquiet manner might become an issue when moving into more\ndemanding (with regard to behavior) state schools. Initially,\nAnnie complied with her first school's approach with regard\nto strict rules and application of any sanctions.\nOn her next placement, Annie's context changed quite\ndramatically as she moved into a state comprehensive (all-\ncomer) high school with a very mixed intake. Despite her\nearlier support for a more humanist approach to young peo-\nple's behavior, she found herself in an environment that\nrelied heavily on rules, warnings, and punishments leavened\nat certain points by the more humanist Restorative practices\napproach.\nThis significant moment involved a first-year boy who is one of\nnine children, himself being the second eldest and from a\ndysfunctional complicated family who were in crisis. The pupil\nhad also recently been arrested for burning down a football club\nhouse only the week before. This gives you some indication of\nthe situation the pupil was in. The pupil had been absent for the\nfirst three weeks of my taking the class and so when he arrived\nhe found the different teacher unsettling. I was accused of\npicking on him for simple reasons for example due to the\nbehavior policy (3 warnings written on board, third means pupil\nreceives punishment exercise and the fourth means that pupil is\nsent from the class), anything serious results in calling your head\nof department for a duty officer who is a member of SMT3 to\nremove the pupil who is then dealt with and given evening\ndetentions while writing warnings on the board for several\npupils, I wrote the pupil in question's name first, which resulted\nin a few minutes of shouting from the pupil accusing me of\npicking on him. . . .the pupil should have been visited by a duty\nofficer and received detentions out with school hours, however\nthe PT (Principal or lead subject teacher) decided that this was\nnot necessary as it was too late on in the lesson. This caused the\npupil's behavior to deteriorate further and the verbal abuse\nwould begin the moment that he entered my classroom. I phoned\nsenior management myself. The pupil continued his aggression\nin front of the depute head and then refused to enter an office\nand left the school grounds. I learned that some pupils sadly\ncannot be reached, they have too much going on in their lives\nand cannot deal with the change brought about by a student\nteacher on placement and that the best that you can do is to\nfollow an ineffective behavior code and remove the pupil from\nthe class.\n(Annie second placement school, reflective commentary)\nHere, Annie had tried to apply the behavior code and hier-\narchy of measures that obviously were not helping with this\nparticular young person. The school's management team had\nmade a decision to use some elements of restorative practice\n(RP) within a more punitive regime to try to make something\nwork. However, in this instance, it seemed to be the use of\nstrategy rather than an embracing of the philosophical ideas\nunderpinning RP. At this point Annie had to find a way to\ndeal with a lack of success with this pupil, and she focused\non the dominance of family and community contextual influ-\nences and the powerlessness of the system. Added to this was\na fragmented management structure that seemed unreliable\nand at times contradictory.\nWhat is schooling about?As Annie progressed through the\nteacher educator course and placement experience, she began\nto reflect more deeply on some of the power relations preva-\nlent within school and her own beliefs and values around\neducation.\n\"control,\" many teachers I have witnessed think that they must\nbe in control at all times. However, I disagree with this approach\nas I do not feel control is an important part of education, rather I\nbelieve in a more liberal approach in which the focus on\neducation is creating a nurturing atmosphere in which children\nfeel comfortable and know that the teacher is there to aide them\nin life and learning and not there solely to enjoy being in a\nposition of control at all times. Creating a tense atmosphere does\nnot in my opinion aid learning and growth of a young person\nallowing them to prosper, which after all, is surely the point in\nschooling and education.\n(Annie--second placement, reflective commentary)\nWhere previously Annie had relied on the punishment\nregime and short-term control within the classroom she had\nbegun to question fundamental aspects of the implications of\nthis approach and to consider how this might chime with her\nown personal beliefs about schooling. Annie began to ques-\ntion what she had previously accepted as the part of the\nbehavioral approach of the school--punishment.\n8 SAGE Open\nThe only obvious \"achievement\" in using punishment to manage\nbehavior is to stamp out the behavior; there is no rehabilitation\nside or enquiry into the behavior. Another negative effect of\npunishment is the possibility that the pupil will rebel, as there is\nno focus on restoring the relationship between pupil and teacher,\njust in the teacher exerting their control over the pupil in the\nclassroom.\n(Annie--second placement, reflective commentary)\nMoment of revelation? We had spoken in the behavior course\nabout reaching a point, a moment of epiphany, one of many\nin becoming a teacher when certain things seem very clear\nand more fully understood. Annie characterized this as her\nmoment of revelation and reflects the natural movement for\nthe student teacher away from a focus on self and toward a\nmore reflective and critical view of experience, reading, and\npractice.\nThis was my revelation--behavior management is not all about\na teacher, but a lot about the pupils and their backgrounds and\nexpectation from which you have to work and adapt and adjust\nto. I adjusted my expectations and they adjusted their language\nand sometimes with some classes that is enough--you have to\naccept that silence while golden is not always possible and does\nnot sound the same for everyone.\n(Annie--third placement, reflective commentary)\nAnnie's movement toward a different way of thinking\nabout engagement with pupils led her to reconsidering her\npriorities and the nature of her relationships with the young\npeople she was working with and she began to ask the school\nto give her very difficult classes.\nI realized the complexity of behaviour management, there's not\njust a problem and a solution. You have to live with some\nuncertainty. I think before I had the idea of the perfect classroom,\nchildren at desks, working away in silence but I had to change\nexpectations, look below the surface. I learned to let go of the\nacademic a little. I had to let go of my selfish needs. Yes, I had a\ncrit4 to pass, yes I had this and that to do but I had children. In\nsome classes, the focus had to be on making a connection. I had\none girl, it was a struggle to work with her. She was damaged\nand aggressive and I was thinking how am I going to get them\ndoing things for my crit, for me. But then I thought no--what do\nthey need from me? That's what I have to give if I want to build\nup real trust.\n(Annie's interview at the end of the course)\nAnnie had delved into teacher metaphors and debated the\nkind of model she might echo:\nAs an English teacher I cannot avoid turning to the metaphor in\norder to make clear my interpretation and stance in behavior, I\nthink of the two very different roles of that of the fireman and\nthe policeman. The fireman simply arrives to put out the flame\nand then leaves once the fire is extinguished, the policeman,\nhowever firstly investigates and then if a charge is to be made\nthe person is then sent to a place of rehabilitation or must\nperform some work within the community. I think we have a\nchoice as teachers when managing behaviour to either be the\nfireman or policeman; we either stamp out the bad behaviour\nand leave it at that or follow a longer process of investigation\nand rehabilitation when managing the behaviour of our pupils.\nThe fireman's actions are suggested by those professionals who\nagree with punishment and confrontation but yet there is a\ndistinct lack in these approaches to building a relationship with\nthe pupil and trying to promote positive behavior, whereas the\nteacher who is the \"policeman\" attempts to manage the behavior\nand lead to positive behavior by rehabilitation. The difference\nbetween these two roles and subsequent approaches is made\nmanaging behavior: Responses were frequently concerned with\nputting out fires rather than helping children learn how to be\nmore successful classroom participants.\n(Annie's extended writing in the last few months of the program)\nWill's Case--an Alternative Journey\nNo negotiation--no discussion? Will was in his mid-30s on the\nPGDE and, like Annie, learning to be a teacher of English in\nhigh school. In the past, he had run his own company and\nworked as a football player. Initially, he didn't have any\napprehensions about standing up in class and \"being the\nteacher.\" His approach to teaching in general and behavior\nmore particularly was very focused and straightforward. He\nbelieved that the key support for his choices and strategies\nwould be the school and subject department policies and\nsanctions. He suggested that there should be no negotiation,\nno discussion over the rules governing behavior. He felt\ncomfortable with aspects of the behaviorist approach:\nOne morning, within the first 5 min of the period, she refused to\ntake out her jotter, sit at a table as instructed by me and to be quiet\nwhen I was addressing her. Her behavior had clearly escalated\nwithin such a short period of time that I had no option other than\nto ask her to leave the class that morning. Outside the class, the\npupil was told why she was removed and where she would be\ngoing. There was no negotiation. The class appeared very calm\nand quiet when I reentered. When the regular class teacher was\ninformed of this, he advised this was the right course of action\nand served to warn others in the class who might \"try it on\" in\nfuture. The next time the girl came into class she was observably\nquiet and withdrawn but got on with the work assigned and there\nwas no problem that day. I interacted with her as though nothing\nhad happened the previous time. I had to deal with several\nincidents in this class where highly inappropriate behavior was\nthe main issue. Depending on the severity, these were dealt with\nthrough the school policy regarding such indiscipline. The worst\ncases were dealt with in the same way: Removing the pupil from\nclass, sending them on what is called \"local referral\" to an\nadjacent or nearby class to be monitored by another teacher.\n(Will's first placement school--reflective commentary)\nHamilton 9\nHowever, as Will moved into second and third placements,\nhe was faced with diverse student populations. Suddenly\nthere were children from very low socioeconomic status as\nwell as new ethnic minority groups and so English as an\nAdditional Language (EAL) had to be considered, as well as\na wide range of Additional Support Needs (ASN) and some\nwith, \"very tragic stories\" (Will's Interview--end of pro-\ngram). He certainly needed to rethink some of his ideas about\nworking and building relationships with young people.\nI reflected that although I had \"won\" the battle of authority I felt\nthe matter had not been resolved satisfactorily. Thus, after\nfurther reflection, I sought out opportunities in the final couple\nof weeks of placement to \"regain\" John and develop one-to-one\ndiscussion strategies further in an effort to work alongside this\npupil who had clearly manifested incommunicative and\nchallenging classroom behavior. On one occasion, I noticed\nJohn passing in the corridor, affording an opportunity to speak\nwith him. I was genuinely impressed with the piece of poetry\nthat John had eventually handed in and commended him\naccordingly, specifying exactly what was good about the work.\nHere began the diffusing process of a potentially damaging\nrelationship and was certainly the catalyst for better relations\nbetween teacher and pupil for the rest of the placement.\nThe handling of the insubordination though raised a number of\nquestions for me to consider. On the one hand, I was mindful to\nsupport the guidelines presented within the School's Discipline\npolicy when dealing with John's indiscipline. I recognized any\nclear guidelines adopted by the school will only be as good as the\nconsistency with which it is employed.That is why I used the whole\nschool agreement on behavior as the basis to discuss the matter\nwith John outside the classroom and enforce its punitive sanctions.\nI felt this had been professionally achieved, but equally felt the\nensuing \"confrontation\" was potentially damaging to both parties\nand could have been avoided. Although I \"won\" the battle of the\negos, lost was the creation of an arena within which to cater for\nconstructive one-to-one discussion. The error at this stage of\nhandling John's behavior was the lack of consideration for the rest\nof the story. Firstly, John did not have a record of this kind of\nbehavior. Secondly, his tearful reaction proved to me that his\nspiralling behaviour was not borne out of defiance but most\nprobably due to him having an \"off day.\" (Will after second\nplacement school, extended writing)\nYet he did not see himself as having undergone a personal\ntransformation during this time and he was happy that he had\nretained the key aspects of the person he was.\nI'm true to myself but there are subtle shifts and a lot more to\ndevelop and understand. In my childhood, I had to play a role, to\nbe an effective contributor and wherever I've ended up in life,\nI've taken that working class, socialist view through the rest of\nmy life. I also happen to be religious and I try to aspire to my\nbeliefs and hopefully that comes across in how I try to deal with\nothers in a compassionate and fair way--I want to be a role\nmodel for other working class boys. (Will's interview--end of\nprogram)\nNonetheless, Will suggests the need for awareness and\nreflection as he highlights the occasional shift back in\napproach.\nI do still have moments when I think, I'm older than you and you\nshould do what you're told and when that didn't transfer to\nimmediate respect, trying to think back to the course. Some\noccasions when my authority was usurped and in close proximity\nto a fourth-year pupil (16 years old), I probably raised my voice\nand went masculine eyeball to eyeball but then realized his lack\nof maturity and tears and realized I'd waded in with my tacketty\nboots. (Will interview at end of program)\nWill charted his evolving ideas around behavior and\nbuilding relationships with young people as part of the learn-\ning and teaching process and his movement away from his\nearlier, \"no negotiation, no discussion,\" stance was marked.\nOn a wider level, Bruner's theory of \"reciprocity\" has given me\nfurther inspiration to incorporate strategies of handling\nmotivation during learning. \"Reciprocity,\" Bruner states is an\n\"intrinsic motive, a deep human need to respond to others and to\noperate jointly with them towards an objective.\" (Bruner, 1966,\np. 121) For pupils requiring help with motivation, the \"motive to\nconform\" only Bruner adds is too much of an \"abstraction.\"\nIngram and Worral's ideas on \"negotiation\" between teacher and\npupil is of help particularly when deployed in the conflict\nresolution process. They contend that both parties act as\n\"negotiators who explicitly identify their differences from the\nstart\" (Ingram & Worral, 1993). This arguably shifts the\ntraditionally constructed \"power\" of the teacher to a more\negalitarian footing allowing the pupil to feel a sense of worth,\nidentity and enhanced security within an already established\npartnership with the teacher.\n(Will, after second placement school, extended writing)\nDon't Be a Rose Miss, Be a Thorn! Or\nDon't Smile Until Christmas . . .\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nIn this section, I return to the narrative strands emerging\nfrom the two case studies and explore the tension or even\ndissonance experienced, the significance of student teacher\nbeliefs and values, the possible development of cognitive as\nwell as relational and emotional aspects of learning in ITE\nand the possibility of the teacher as agent for change, even\nwithin the early evolution of professional identity formation\nand reformation.\nIn these two case studies, the student teachers have each\nengaged with contrasting views on behavior and relation-\nships in schools within a university-based course and have\nalso experienced varied understandings of behavior as mani-\nfested in schools by colleagues. The cognitive dissonance\nmade explicit at various stages encouraged them to engage\ncritically with these diverse ideas and to look for supporting\nevidence for taking different approaches. The significance of\nthe personal, the belief systems of the student teachers was\nhighlighted in the struggle that would ensue as they attempted\nto reconcile their practice with policy and modeling at school\nlevel. The greatest need for compliance, as might be expected\n(Feiman-Nemser, 1983), was during the initial placements\nthat the student teachers encountered. This was also high-\nlighted in an earlier study by the author (Hamilton, in press).\nHowever, unlike the previous study where minimal interven-\ntion occurred, this project deliberately set out to create and\nencourage dissonance to highlight the moments of discom-\nfort and challenge student teachers experienced, when\nattempting to deal with contradictory ideas and beliefs.\nConsequently, as each student teacher took slightly different\njourneys through experience, dissonance and reflection sup-\nported a more meaningful engagement with behavior\napproaches, leading to more informed choices about the way\nforward in dealing with young people.\nStudent teachers were frequently faced with the myths of\nteacher control through clich\u00e9s such as don't smile until\nChristmas and the power of such clich\u00e9s was evident in the\nreflections of the cohort of new teachers. Much of this clich\u00e9\nwas emerging in discussion, formal and informal, with expe-\nrienced teachers, all of whom had a role to play in mentoring\nand/or assessing students. The social and relational engage-\nments generated had particular power (Lasky, 2005) as\nMcNally et al. (2005) established in their EPD research, but\ndespite this, Annie and Will began to engage with them criti-\ncally and to draw on other ways of thinking about young\npeople and teacher\u00adpupil relationships.\nAnnie's journey began with a rebellious spirit working\nwithin a compliant institution where consensus and confor-\nmity was key and she began by subsuming her own rebel-\nlious nature within a conforming exterior. Will, however, had\noperated within teams and collaborations with strict rules\nand ways of working prior to beginning his teaching course\nand so reflected a view that echoed a rather traditional behav-\niorist approach to young people. Yet both student teachers by\nthe end of their course had made subtle shifts and changes to\ntheir thinking through a critical engagement with and chal-\nlenge to their own beliefs and values. This perhaps reflects a\nmovement away from what Sultana (2005) suggests is the\ntraditional academic model of teacher as professional where\nassimilation and socialization into the existing models in\nschools may hold sway. Instead this chimes with teacher as a\ncritical agent for change through formal or informal research\ninto practice (Sachs, 2003). Research here is used in a highly\ninclusive sense. However, this suggestion of agency and the\ndevelopment of cognitive elements within learning may not\necho what Sultana (2005) argues is the dominant paradigm in\nITE: the teacher as clinician, bound by central control and\ndetermination/definition as well as competencies or perfor-\nmance indicators. The course at the heart of this project did\nnot set out to push for the rightness of one particular model\nof behavior. Instead, diverse views were discussed and\ndebated. The tutor's own approach to behavior was made\nexplicit but student teachers were encouraged to see this, not\nas the orthodox way forward, but simply as one of the ways,\nand this meant that the tutor had to also be ready to respond\nto challenges to her own view in light of student teacher\nexperiences. The possibility of the teacher being a transfor-\nmational agent (Sachs, 2003) in the classroom increased as\nstudents gained confidence in their careful articulation of\ntheir beliefs and understandings of behavior and relation-\nships in the classroom.\nThe use of dissonance as a mechanism to encourage\nexplicit "
