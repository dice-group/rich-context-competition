Within this research area, one can find two\nbroad lines of inquiry--a literature investigating how the\nphysical and social environment affects mental health out-\ncomes, and a body of research showing how fear of crime\n(FOC) and victimization affects the way older adults live and\nbehave. The current article aims to synthesize these diverse\nliteratures for the interested reader, and presents some plau-\nsible physiological mechanisms through which FOC may\ndirectly or indirectly affect the life span development of the\nbrain to modulate mental health in an effort to aid further\ndevelopment of research in this area.\nThe Environment and Mental Health\nThe impact of both the physical and social environment on an\nindividual's mental health has long been appreciated (Faris &\nof research has shown that an older adult's neighborhood of\nresidence is an important determinant of his or her mental\nhealth. Neighborhood characteristics such as affluence,\ninequality, and residential stability can significantly affect\nhealth even after controlling for a number of individual-level\nfactors (Beard et al., 2009; Boardman, Finch, Ellison,\nDiez, 2001; Subramanian, Kubzansky, Berkman, Fay, &\nKawachi, 2006). A number of theories have been proposed to\nexplain the association between neighborhood characteristics\nand mental health outcomes. Researchers have proposed that\nneighborhoods with greater disadvantage and/or inequality\ninherently have lower levels of social cohesion and weaker\ncapacity for social control (Sampson, Morenoff, & Gannon-\nRowley, 2002). The lack of cohesion often results in poor\nsocial organization and lower levels of trust, which both pro-\nvide a chronic stressor and inhibit the ability of social net-\nworks to buffer stress (Lin, Ye, & Ensel, 1999; Ross &\nSampson & Raudenbush, 2004). A critical mediator in this\nrelationship between neighborhood and mental health may be\nFOC. Since the term first emerged in the late 1930s, wide-\nspread discourse concerning FOC emerged among profes-\nsionals and academics, quickly turning FOC into an\nestablished social scientific concept (Lee, 2007). Furthermore,\ndata indicate that increases in the rate of crime coverage may\narticle attempts to provide a timely synthesis of the evidence\nfor the role of FOC in determining the mental health of older\npopulations.\n1Saint Mary's University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada\n2Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nRachael E.

Collins1 and Diano F. Marrone2\n Keywords\nmental health, fear of crime, aging, review article\n2 SAGE Open\nFear of Crime as a Key Environmental\nDeterminant of Mental Health\nFOC is a complex construct used to explain a range of both\npsychological and social reactions to perceived threats of\ncrime and/or victimization. Adding to this complexity is the\nfact that FOC can be measured in many ways (Hale, 1996;\nPain, 2001). When asking participants about their FOC,\nsome studies (for instance) distinguish between the cogni-\ntive assessment of the risk of being victimized and the\naffective state of fear (e.g., Cossman & Rader, 2011; Killias,\n1990). Moreover, some studies use a binary forced choice,\nwhile others allow participants to rank their fear on a con-\ntinuum. In addition, respondents may be asked about fear of\ncrime in general, about one or more specific crimes (e.g.,\nmugging), and/or in one or more specific circumstances\n(e.g., while walking alone at night). It is possible for any of\nthese methodological differences to have a profound impact\non the results that are obtained. Despite these differences,\nthe vast majority of studies find that FOC is unrelated to\nactual rates of victimization (Hale, 1996). This is because\nperceptions are what drive the FOC, rather than objective\nmeasures of risk (Brunton-Smith, 2011; Brunton-Smith,\nJackson, & Sutherland, 2014). It is logical to include in this\ndiscussion that the constant exposure to constructions of\nthe criminal Other and finding people who match those\ndepictions within their neighborhood can also manipulate\nthis subjective sense of risk. Thus, it is not surprising to\nfind that substantial literature exists which demonstrates\nthat marginalization, particularly marginalization based on\nMiller, Like, & Levin, 2006). A relationship between FOC\nand the racial composition of place has been widely\nassumed in social science literature (Chiricos, McEntire, &\nGertz, 2001), as studies have shown that the presence of\nminority groups in a neighborhood affects fear levels far\nmore than actual crime statistics (Chiricos, Hogan, & Gertz,\nFactors affecting social disorder may also play a role in\nthe production of fear and perceived risk. Incivilities, or\nphysical signs of social disorder such as litter, graffiti, and\nabandoned buildings, have been shown to correlate with\nlocal FOC (Covington & Taylor, 1991; R. B. Taylor &\nable, however, is inextricably tied to race. Neighborhoods\nwith a vast majority of ethnic minorities tend to have high\nunemployment rates and tend to receive less investment in\ntheir maintenance from civic and governmental bodies.\nIn addition, incivilities may be closely tied to another\nform of social capital referred to as collective efficacy.\nSampson et al. (1997) broadly define collective efficacy as\nthe ability of \". . . neighborhoods to realize the common val-\nues of residents and maintain effective social controls\"\n(p. 919). In general, people with stronger ties to their neigh-\nbors and neighborhood experience less FOC (Aneshensel &\n1987). Much of this same research has shown that people\nliving in neighborhoods with less collective efficacy and\nhigher crime rates have a higher prevalence of many nega-\ntive measures of mental health, including depression, anxi-\nety, substance abuse, and psychoses, as well as general\npsychological distress. These relationships hold true even\nwhen controlling for other neighborhood characteristics such\nas economic context. Unfortunately, one of the key factors\nanalyzed in many studies of the relationship between FOC\nand a persons'mental health is often estimates of the reported\nlocal crime rate--likely because statistics such as uniform\ncrime reports are relatively easy to obtain across large geo-\ngraphical areas. There may be several problems with this\napproach. First, there are methodological issues, such as\nunder reporting crime due to incomplete reports on the part\nof officers and individuals who often do not report crimes\ncommitted against them. Second, there are conceptual prob-\nlems with measuring \"real\" victimization risk. The approach\nto victimization risk inherently assumes that FOC and vic-\ntimization are the product of a rational and largely accurate\nassessment of relative risk. Large amounts of data, however,\nshow this is not the case particularly for older persons.\nVariation in self-reported levels of FOC generally do not\nreflect local crime rates, particularly when individual-level\nfactors such as social class are controlled for (DuBow,\nShumaker, 1990). Research has shown that levels of FOC are\nin fact inversely related to real-world estimates of victimiza-\ntion risk (Akers, La Greca, Sellers, & Cochran, 1987;\nThis phenomenon, often referred to as the paradox of fear,\nhas been the subject of much research. Although the cause\nfor this paradox is beyond the scope of this article, its exis-\ntence establishes that FOC can affect the lives (and health) of\nindividuals, despite the fact that most people have low vic-\ntimization risk, such as older individuals.\nResearch has also shown that a person's perceived risk of\nvictimization and his or her subsequent FOC may be related\nto his or her physical strength and perceived ability to defend\noneself, and his or her socio-economic status, size of social\nPowell & Wahidin, 2008; Stafford, Chandola, & Marmot,\nability tends to have the greatest effect on older people and\nwomen. Women in general have higher rates of fear then men\nbut have less risk of victimization then men (Hilinski,\nKindsey, Pentecost, & Andrews, 2011). According to Hilinski\net al. (2011), much of the fear that women experience relates\nto sexual aggression, and women are 10 times more likely to\nbe sexually assaulted than men (Reid & Konrad, 2004).\nHowever, older persons in particular have disproportionately\nhigh FOC relative to their risk of victimization (De Donder,\nCollins and Marrone 3\n2009; Scarborough, Like-Haislip, Novak, Lucas, & Alarid,\nparticularly in large cities (Lee, 2007), as crime is often asso-\nciated with the rise of cities. This is not a surprising result\ngiven that almost every key socio-demographic feature\nknown to be associated with higher levels of FOC is also a\nfeature that increases in prevalence with age. Moreover, these\nindividual-level variables and other known neighborhood-\nlevel variables often interact in synergistic ways to amplify\nFOC in older people. For example, older neighborhood resi-\ndents are more likely to live in neighborhoods experiencing\nrapid turnover, as one generation vacates nearby properties\ndue to mortality or movement to assisted living arrangements,\nwhile younger residents replace them (see Taylor &\nCovington, 1988). This heterogeneity and high turnover both\ninhibit the formation of social networks and amplify FOC.\nAlthough the relationship between age and FOC is con-\ntested (e.g., Ditton, Bannister, Gilchrist, & Farrall, 1999;\nKury, Obergfell-Fuchs, & Ferdinand, 2001), the need to\nunderstand FOC in older populations remains important\neven if they are not disproportionately afraid. One reason for\nthis need is the fact that pre-existing health conditions can\ndrive FOC. Although there is evidence to support the direc-\ntion of causation (e.g., Stafford et al., 2007), a more complex\nfeedback model has been proposed (e.g., Jackson & Stafford,\n2009). That is, although poorer health may increase FOC due\nto perceived vulnerability, FOC may also act to subsequently\npromote changes in both physiology and lifestyle that further\ndeteriorate health. This review will focus on the plausible\nmechanisms by which FOC is coupled with mental health in\nolder individuals, both directly and through physical activity\nand social interaction (see Figure 1).\nMechanisms for FOC to Alter Life Span\nBrain Development\nExercise\nPhysical activity is a very potent modulator of both physical\nWarburton, Nicol, & Bredin, 2006). A large body of evidence\nsuggests that older adults are more likely to engage in physi-\ncal activity if they perceive their neighborhoods to be safe\nFigure 1. Links between fear of crime and mental health.\nNote. A schematic diagram depicts most of the major pathways between mental health and fear of crime (FOC) described in the article, either directly or\nmediated by social capital (SC) and physical activity (PA). As the relationships are bi-directional, the nodes in the figure contain arrows running in both\ndirections. In addition, an abbreviated description of the mechanism is shown nearest the appropriate line along with a positive (+) or negative (-) symbol\nto indicate the direction of the relationship.\n4 SAGE Open\n(Booth et al., 2000; Brownson, Baker, Housemann, Brennan,\n& Bacak, 2001; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n[CDC], 1999; Stafford, Marmot, Eley, Stansfeld, & Marmot,\nalso shown that FOC is associated with sedentary behavior\nincluding reduced outdoor activities (Ross, 1993) and\nincreased car use (Lauer, 2005). More importantly, physical\nactivity in older adults is consistently linked with improved\nmental health across multiple measures, including decreased\nprevalence of depressive symptoms (Emery, Schein, Hauck,\ntive functioning (Chang, Pan, Chen, Tsai, & Huang, 2012;\nThe link between mental health outcomes and physical\nactivity is complex and bi-directional, and several non-\nexclusive mechanisms have been proposed to mediate the\nrelationship (Erickson, Gildengers, & Butters, 2013;\nMattson, 2012). Many studies support the argument that\nexercise has anti-depressant effects in older adults, yet the\nmechanism of action remains unclear. Many psychosocial\nfactors are implicated, including increased social contact\nfrom participation in group exercises (Cooney et al., 2013;\ndiscussed further below). Other non-mechanistic factors\nhave been suggested as well, such as increased self-efficacy\nand enhanced self-concept as a result of exercise interven-\ntions (Erickson et al., 2013). Consistent with the feedback\nmodel of Jackson and Stafford (2009), the above factors\nalso decrease FOC and provide another example in a very\ncomplex feedback cycle in which there are many opportu-\nnities for bi-directional interaction between FOC and health\nvia exercise.\nThere are also clear biological mechanisms for exercise's\neffects on mental health that cannot be accounted for by psy-\nchosocial factors, in part because they also occur in multiple\nmammal species with prolonged exercise. These mecha-\nnisms include enhancement in both volume and functional\nconnectivity of brain circuits involved in mood and memory\nfunction, such as the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal\nlobe (Vivar, Potter, & van Praag, 2013). Exercise also exerts\neffects on a wide range of brain systems in many species,\nincluding the biological stress response, a vascular perfusion\nof many brain regions (Black et al., 1990; Kerr, Steuer,\nPochtarev, & Swain, 2010), neuromodulator systems that are\nknown to affect both cognition and mood (Chen et al., 2008;\nRansford, 1982), and the production of protective trophic\nIn addition to the direct influences, exercise also exerts\nprotective effects on many age-related physical ailments that\naffect mental health. This is particularly well established in\nthe case of exercise's ability to reduce the risk of cardiovas-\nwhich in turn are major risk factors for cognitive decline and\ndementia. Higher levels of physical activity are also associ-\nated with a reduction of falls (DeSure, Peterson, Gianan, &\nPang, 2013; Faber, Bosscher, Chin, Paw, & van Wieringen,\nClaus, & Marottoli, 1995), which are a major contributor to\ninjury among older adults. The moderation of injury risk is\nrelevant here because of the feedback model of FOC, which\nstates that pre-existing health problems increase a person's\nsense of vulnerability, thus amplifying FOC, which further\ncurtails physical activity. Although a full discussion of the\npotential for these factors to affect life span development is\nbeyond the scope of this review, the above description is suf-\nficient to illustrate that the biological and psychosocial fac-\ntors provide powerful mediators of successful brain aging\nand mental health that both affect and are affected by FOC.\nAn equally complex dynamic emerges when examining\nanother behavior pattern associated with both FOC and suc-\ncessful aging--the maintenance of social networks.\nSocial Activities and the Maintenance of Social\nContact\nThe effects of social support and isolation on mental health\nhave long been recognized (Heaney & Israel, 2002; Kawachi\n& Berkman, 2001). In the context of older adults, increased\nengagement in social activities and larger social networks\nhas been associated with decreased risk of cognitive decline\nand dementia (Bassuk, Glass, & Berkman, 1999; Fratiglioni,\nWang, Ericsson, Maytan, & Winblad, 2000; Saczynski et al.,\n& Benjamin, 2010) and depression (Aenchbacher et al.,\nBassuk, & Berkman, 2006; Oxman, Berkman, Freeman, &\n(1939) were among the first to link mental health to neigh-\nborhood factors. Social integration played a prominent role\nin their work, as it was argued that neighborhoods high in\n\"social disorganization\" promoted social isolation, which in\nturn negatively affected mental health outcomes. This semi-\nnal finding has given rise to a wealth of literature on the\nsocial stress model, which is arguably the dominant analytic\nmodel for the social determinants of health (Silver, Mulvey,\n& Swanson, 2002). The model points to at least two distinct\nmechanisms by which FOC may play a critical role in medi-\nating the relationship between social integration and health.\nThe reduction in social contact associated with higher FOC\nmay affect (and be affected by) health directly. In addition,\nreduced social integration may negatively affect the ability\nof social networks to buffer chronic stressors that include\nstress about FOC. Skogan and Maxfield (1981) recognized\nthe impact of negative behavioral changes such as avoid-\nance behaviors and their impact on social life. It was found\nthat people who avoided certain places or did not ride public\ntransit due to FOC (Box, Hale, & Andrews, 1988) also had\nsmaller social networks and had less engagement in social\nCollins and Marrone 5\nConsistent with the feedback model (e.g., Jackson &\nStafford, 2009), there is evidence that the relationship\nbetween FOC and social isolation is bi-directional. For\ninstance, FOC is affected by many factors, including per-\nceived vulnerability. In parallel to physical vulnerability,\nFOC is equally affected by perceptions of social vulnerabil-\nity derived from lack of access to support networks. That is,\nalthough physical vulnerability potentiates fear through a\nperson's perceived lack of ability to defend himself or her-\nself, social vulnerability does so through perceived inability\nto recruit others to aid in his or her defense. In fact,\nsocial vulnerability has been argued as an explanation for\nneighborhood-level variation in fear, as neighborhoods with\ncloser social ties between neighbors report lower FOC, per-\nhaps because they perceive each another as more likely to\ncome to their aid (Covington & Taylor, 1991; Franklin,\nolder adults (De Donder, De Witte, Buffel, Dury, & Vert\u00e9,\ncontext, social ties have been almost exclusively studied at\nthe neighborhood level. To the authors' knowledge, no study\nto date has clearly examined the individual impact of intra-\nversus extra-neighborhood social ties on FOC and health.\nThis is unfortunate, given that older adults are more likely to\nutilize extended social supports from friends and family for\ninformal health care and financial aid (Penning, 1995; Van\nAlthough no scholar can dispute the wealth of data show-\ning neighborhood-level ties in mediating FOC, the extended\ninformal care network of older individuals may suggest that\nextra-neighborhood social ties will also have great impact on\nperceived vulnerability and subsequently on FOC in older\nadults. Among older adults with chronic health problems,\nthese social supports may be as important as neighborhood-\nlevel ties in determining fear levels. Further investigation is\nclearly needed in this area.\nIn addition to the direct effects of social isolation and\nmental health mentioned above, a great deal of evidence\nshows that social networks have positive effects on mental\nhealth by acting as stress mediators (Aneshensel 1992;\nKawachi & Berkman, 2001; Wenzel, Glanz, & Lerman,\n2002). This research focuses on the amount of available\nfunctional social support (often referred to as social capital)\nat both individual and neighborhood levels. The research\nconsistently shows that support systems can provide a stress-\nbuffering mechanism and, as a result, reduce biological\nmarkers of chronic stress and associated disease. Although\nchronic stress may originate from a wide array of sources,\none potential stressor is FOC. These stressors can have direct\nphysiological and behavioral consequences for health. It has\nbeen proposed that chronic exposure to threat (whether per-\nceived or actual) stimulates physiological responses that\nover long periods can compromise the function of both the\nnervous and immune systems (Lupien, Maheu, Tu, Fiocco,\nthe brain more vulnerable to subsequent insults (Russell,\nZigmond, Dimatelis, Daniels, & Mabandla, 2014). Moreover,\nchronic stress increases the likelihood of other health-\ndeteriorating activities such as heavy drinking (Hill & Angel,\n2005) and may also decrease the health-promoting effects of\nexercise (Howells, Russell, Mabandla, & Kellaway, 2005).\nFinally, evidence suggests that older adults may be particu-\nlarly susceptible to the effects of chronic stress, as aging is\nassociated with a more pronounced physiological stress\nresponse to the same stressor (Lupien et al., 2007; Sindi,\nFiocco, Juster, Pruessner, & Lupien, 2013).\nConclusion\nIt is clear that FOC affects mental health at a population\nlevel. Moreover, FOC shows complex reciprocal relation-\nships with both mental health and health-promoting behav-\nior. Many of these factors are independently associated with\nage. These factors conspire to put older adults at greater risk\nof being negatively affected by FOC and its determinants.\nTherefore, FOC should be a public health focus as a potential\ncommunity-level mediator of mental health and well-being,\nparticularly those focused on compression of morbidity in\nolder adults.\nHowever, one point bears mentioning. Although it is clear\nthat the FOC exhibited by older individuals is disproportion-\nate to their victimization risk, the question of whether they\nare in fact more fearful than their younger counterparts\nremains debated. The fact that this question has been the\nfocus of such a large proportion of the research is unfortunate\nin the opinion of the authors. This question is not the most\nproductive one to ask. This is because it can provide limited\ninsight beyond showing that FOC is linked to factors in the\nsocial and physical environment rather than true victimiza-\ntion risk, and by extension that reduction of actual crime\nrates is not sufficient to reduce the FOC and its subsequent\neffect on mental health. Rather, it would be more impactful\nto clarify the relationships between physical and mental\nhealth, the social environment, and FOC, as these are likely\nto change with age. A wide array of unique physical and\nmental health concerns emerge during the third and fourth\nages of life, and it is reasonable to hypothesize that their rela-\ntionship to the physical and social environment of an indi-\nvidual is similarly evolving over time. Understanding how\nthey are affected by (and in turn affect) FOC over the life\nspan can provide unique opportunities to promote health and\nprevent disease. Indeed, data show that changes made at a\nneighborhood level can reduce FOC. In a recent systematic\nreview, Lorenc and colleagues (2013) isolated several key\nfeatures of the built environment that can modulate anxiety\nabout safety such as gates, street lighting, visibility and\n\"openness\" in the environment, and physical incivilities (i.e.,\nsigns of neglect such as dirt, graffiti, and litter). This list pro-\nvides a clear starting point for interventions aimed at reduc-\ning FOC. Moreover, evidence shows that changes to the\n6 SAGE Open\nphysical environment can positively affect the perception of\nneighborhood safety and subsequently lead residents to\nincrease their physical activity (Jongeneel-Grimen,\nDroomers, van Oers, Stronks, & Kunst, 2014).\nAlthough these data provide a starting point, few studies\nhave examined how the relationship between the physical and\nsocial environment change with age. Instead, age is often\ntreated as a variable to be controlled for, and while this\napproach is useful for isolating universal trends, it misses an\nopportunity to target those individuals who are likely to derive\nthe most benefit from interventions. It is also important to note\nthat in planning such interventions, the synergies among the\nfactors being manipulated must be taken into account. For\ninstance, recent data show that increases in the amount of\nretail space within walking distance of a resident not only\ntended to increase walking but also increased FOC (Foster,\nWood, Christian, Knuiman, & Giles-Corti, 2013). The para-\ndox highlights that any intervention program needs to consider\nthe balance between community growth and a resident's FOC.\nIn a similar vein, many approaches that have been used in the\npast to enhance some environmental factors associated with\nreduced FOC have been criticized for promoting a \"bunker\nmentality\" that reduces social cohesion, which is also a power-\nful mediator of FOC (Cozens, Saville, & Hillier, 2005). As\nsuch, these interventions should not be undertaken without\nreservation. There remains great untapped potential, however,\nin programs to curb FOC in an age-sensitive manner to\nimprove mental health and well-being.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAenchbacher, L.
