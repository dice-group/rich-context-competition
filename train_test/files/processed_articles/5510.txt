This article identifies and maps key influencers of food choice at the\npoint-of-purchase (POP) in Australian RIC and identifies gaps in our knowledge. It is based on a narrative review of the\nliterature pertaining to food in RIC from a range of disciplinary perspectives including nutrition, ethnography, public health,\nanthropology, and remote health to map POP drivers of food choice. In particular, the role of habit is identified as a key factor\nthat has previously not been discussed in the literature. The conceptual framework can be used as a basis for future POP\nresearch in RIC and provides guidance for social marketers, public health, nutrition, and policy workers operating in this field.\n",

At last census, Aboriginal\nand Torres Strait Islander people made up around 2% of the\n23.5 million population of Australia (Australian Bureau of\nStatistics [ABS], 2013). Around a third of Aboriginal and\nTorres Strait Islander people live in major Australian cities\nareas defined by their distance to service centers (Australian\nInstitute of Health and Welfare [AIHW], 2004) some literally\nthousands of kilometers from service centers--defined as\nurban centers with population clusters over 1,000 people\ncommunities (RIC) in Australia. Just under half of these RIC\nconsist of less than 20 people but most people (72%) live in\ncommunities of 200 people or more and larger communities\nconsist of several thousand people (ABS, 2003). The facili-\nties available in remote communities vary depending upon\nsize but most include fuel supply, office, school, and health\nclinic and a basic shop where people can purchase a range of\ngoods including food.\nFurthermore, Indigenous Australians living in remote\ncommunities carry a significant and disproportionate share\nof the gap with the 26% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait\nIslander people living in remote communities accounting for\n40% of the health gap (Vos, Barker, Begg, Stanley, & Lopez,\n2009). Inadequate or poor nutrition relates to four of the top\nseven risk factors contributing to this gap: obesity, high\nblood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and low fruit and\nvegetable intake (Vos, Barker, Stanley, & Lopez, 2007). Diet\nis the leading risk of burden of disease for all Australians.\nPoor nutrition in RIC relates to several factors. It has pre-\nviously been argued that Indigenous Australians derive 95%\nof energy intake from purchased foods (A. J. Lee, Bonson, &\nPowers, 1996) with the remainder being sourced from tradi-\ntional foods acquired through hunting and/or gathering. In\nmore recent work, the complexity of food provisioning in\nremote communities has been acknowledged and whereas\nonce the community store tended to be the only retail source\nof food in communities, independent takeout shops also exist\n(Brimblecombe, Mackerras, Clifford, & O'Dea, 2006).\nSources of food supply in RIC vary and now include com-\nmunity care programs, school canteens, school breakfast and\n1University of Canberra, Bruce\n2Menzies School of Health Research, Darwin, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nJoanna Henryks, Faculty of Arts and Design, University of Canberra,\nBruce, Australian Capital Territory 2601, Australia.\nEmail: joannahenryks@gmail.com\nMapping Point-of-Purchase Influencers\nof Food Choice in Australian Remote\nIndigenous Communities: A Review of the\nLiterature\nJoanna Henryks1 and Julie Brimblecombe2\n Keywords\nAboriginal people, Australia, food, point-of-purchase\n2 SAGE Open\nlunch programs, independently managed stores and takeouts,\nand food sources from hunting and gathering (Brimblecombe\nwe acknowledge that the community store is not necessarily\nthe main source of food supply in a remote community, it is\nlikely to be a major source.\nCurrent food consumption in remote communities is a\ndiet dominated by highly processed foods and characterized\nby high levels of sugar (predominantly from sugar-sweet-\nened beverages [SSB] and table sugar), low intake of fruit\nand vegetables coupled with excessive sodium intake, and\ndeficiency in a number of micronutrients (Brimblecombe,\nFerguson, Liberato, & O'Dea, 2013). Similar high levels of\nSSB (>250 g/d) have been reported in remote Aboriginal\ntotalcommunityfoodanddrinkpurchasedata(Brimblecombe,\nFerguson, Liberato, & O'Dea, 2013), as that reported for\nChan, Moss, Miller, & Cobiac, 2011). Levels of fruit and\nvegetable intake of 122 g to 247 g per person reported across\nthree remote Northern Territory communities are around a\nquarter of the recommended intake of 675 g, 300 g from fruit\nvegetables (five pieces of vegetables weighting 75 g;\nNational Health and Medical Research Council [NHMRC],\nInconsistent access to quality fruit and vegetables and\nhigh prices are some of the reasons for the low rates of con-\nsumption (Council of Australian Governments [COAG],\naccess is discussed below; however, price as a consumption\nbarrier is currently being investigated by the Menzies School\nof Health Research in their NHMRC-funded SHOP@RIC\nproject. This study is investigating the link between pricing\nand healthy food purchasing through assessing the effects of\na price subsidy on certain healthy food items or through a\ncombination of the price subsidy and an in-store nutrition\neducation strategy (Brimblecombe, Ferguson, Liberato, Ball,\nConsumers in RIC face many challenges and barriers in\nrelation to healthy food provisioning and consumption.\nMany of the external and environmental factors accounting\nfor food choice in RIC have been linked to issues of poverty\n(see, for example, Brimblecombe et al., 2014; Brimblecombe\nwanting to minimize the profound impact of poverty on healthy\nfood choice and consumption, further research to understand\ndecision making and behavior at the point-of-purchase (POP)\nwill add another perspective to the task of addressing food-\nrelated issues in RIC. These challenges to some extent have\nbeen explored from different disciplinary perspectives and\nhave included anthropology (for example, Saethre, 2005),\nnutrition (Brimblecombe et al., 2014; Brimblecombe, Liddle,\nhealth (Brimblecombe & O'Dea, 2009), and a research\nmethod approach--action research (Adams et al., 2012).\nAn area that could contribute different frameworks for\nexploring these challenges is social marketing. Through\nincorporating \"other approaches,\" social marketers can draw\non the broad range of literature rather than just focusing on a\nsilo approach to challenges, as can often be the case in\naddressing challenges faced by RIC. Any social marketing\nprogram that seeks to address the influence of POP on peo-\nple's food choices in RIC will need to take into account the\nenvironmental, social/cultural, store level, and individual\nfactors to develop a strategy which encompasses upstream,\nmidstream, and downstream approaches. Social marketing\npractice has tended toward a binary approach: upstream or\ndownstream (Russell-Bennett, Wood, & Previte, 2013).\nMidstream approaches, although not entirely ignored (see,\nfor example, Sacks, Swinburn, & Lawrence, 2009) are not\noften considered. We would argue that all three approaches\nneed to be used to facilitate long-term change in healthier\neating practices in RIC.\nA narrative literature review was undertaken to map the\ninfluencers of food choice in RIC. This form of literature\nreview is useful \"when attempting to link many studies . . .\nfor the purposes of reinterpretation or interconnection\" and\nconsequently it is a \"valuable theory building technique\"\nTorres Strait Islander HealthInfoNet, Web of Knowledge,\nand Google Scholar databases were searched. No date limits\nwere set but the literature search initially concluded in\nlowing terms were used across all the databases: (Indigenous\nor Aborig* or Torres Strait Islander) AND (remote commu-\nnit*) AND (food). A search of the grey literature from gov-\nernment and non-government agencies was also undertaken.\nIn addition, reference lists of selected papers relevant to the\ntopic drivers of food choice at the POP in RIC were used as\nfurther sources of information. The search was limited by the\ndearth of available literature.\nPapers were reviewed for factors that influenced con-\nsumer choice at the POP either directly or indirectly. Factors\ninfluencing food choice in RIC go beyond the store level and\nfor this reason they are explored to contextualize buying\nbehavior at the POP. Factors were separated into categories\nadapted from social marketing approaches: upstream, mid-\nstream, and downstream. These provide a useful framework\nfor understanding systems which impact individual decision\nmaking.\nUpstream Context\nUpstream social marketing approaches focus on environ-\nmental factors including the social determinants of health\n(Donovan & Henley, 2010), food availability and choice, and\nfood price, as well as advocacy and lobbying to influence\nHenryks and Brimblecombe 3\nfocusing on a range of actors that have an influence on the\nenvironment of the target audience which can potentially\ninclude politicians, local government policy-makers, media\nfigures, community activists, corporations, schools, and\nfoundations (Brimblecombe et al., 2015; N. R. Lee & Kotler,\nPolicy.The Australian Government initiative Closing the\nGap has influenced and been a feature of health policy in the\nNorthern Territory and was a response to the Close the Gap\ncampaign organized by a coalition of Indigenous and non-\nIndigenous health and community organizations (Oxfam\nAustralia, 2009). The campaign focuses on \"closing the gap\"\nbetween non-Indigenous and Indigenous health outcomes by\n2030. Unfortunately, some aspects of single policy efforts\nhave made little impact on improving nutrition at the popula-\ntion level in RIC. For example, the Northern Territory Emer-\ngency Response (NTER) income management policy\nappeared to have no impact in its early stages of implementa-\ntion on increasing people's purchasing of fruit and vegeta-\nbles or decreasing purchasing of SSB (Brimblecombe et al.,\n2010), both factors that contribute to health. Income man-\nagement, in combination with the community stores licens-\ning program that addresses store infrastructure, food quality\nand availability, may have (Australian National Audit Office\n[ANAO], 2014; Cultural and Indigenous Research Centre\nAustralia [CIRCA], 2011). Rigorous evaluation of these\nstrategies is needed to provide the public and communities\nwith robust evidence on effect. Continued work in influenc-\ning policy needs to focus on housing issues that will improve\npeople's ability to prepare, cook, and store food. Health Hab-\nitat has been instrumental in providing data to demonstrate\nthat poor design, construction, and a lack of routine mainte-\nnance are central to people's abilities to store, prepare, and\ncook food and not, as is currently perceived, damage by resi-\nAccess to healthy food in remote communities was raised\nas a concern in the National Strategy for Food Security in\nRemote Indigenous Communities (COAG, 2009). If healthy\nfood is unavailable for purchase in a remote store, clearly it\ncannot be consumed. The Stronger Futures in the Northern\nTerritory Act (2012) addressed concerns raised in the COAG\nreport through the Food Security component of the Act. This\nis aimed at improving access to healthy food in remote com-\nmunities through the licensing of remote stores (the commu-\nnity stores licensing program) and ensuring these stores\nstock an appropriate range of healthy food, including a mini-\nmum range of fruit and vegetables.\nAvailability and choice. The impact of policy upon availability\nwas noted in the previous section; however, food shortages\nresulting from inability of stores to be replenished during the\nwet season can also have an effect on food availability. A\nrecent study in one RIC found that food scarcity (not just\nhealthy food) had a significant effect on food purchases with\nperishables, such as meat and fruit and vegetables, the most\naffected categories of food--with mean sales dropping by\n75% when the store could not be replenished due to wet sea-\nSome stores have made specific policies about what to\nstock effectively resulting in choice editing. Choice editing\nhas been defined as \"cutting out unnecessarily damaging\nproducts and getting real sustainable choices on the shelves\"\n(Sustainable Consumption Roundtable, 2006, p. 2). This pro-\ncess involves removing products from shelves which are not\nsustainable. In the case of food, we can use the concept of\nchoice editing to support the removal of unhealthy food. An\nexample is the Mai Wiru Regional Stores Policy in the\nAnangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands, South\nAustralia. This is a community-driven policy developed with\nextensive community consultation and incorporating all\nstakeholders. The policy aim was to address access to healthy\nfood in remote communities. Within this policy framework,\none community successfully removed the top three selling\nsugar-sweetened drinks from their store to encourage a tran-\nsition toward lower sugar or zero sugar based drinks and\nresulted in an overall reduction in available kilojoules con-\nsumed from SSB (Butler, Tapsell, & Lyons-Wall, 2011).\nRecent research on the broader efforts of the Mai Wiru stores\nto improve nutrition on the APY Lands found that despite the\ndecreased intake of sugar in this one store, overall diet qual-\nity across stores has decreased since 1986 and additional\nongoing resources are required to ensure diet quality\nStore managers' attitudes and beliefs toward food in RIC\ncan influence the range of products stocked and their stock\nmanagement practices, which affect the choice, quality, and\navailability of healthy food. For example, A. J. Lee, Bonson,\nand Powers (1996) found that a perceived lack of consumer\n\"demand\" was used to justify not stocking certain healthy\nfood as the manager claimed these foods were \"unpopular.\"\nThis was in contrast to other communities in the study where\nthe managers focused on ensuring a quality supply of healthy\nfood, which did generate demand. Similarly, a review of\nnutrition policy of the Arnhem Land Progress Association (a\nretailing cooperative in the Arnhem Land, Northern\nAustralia) found that store managers' actions resulted in\nvarying levels of policy implementation across the commu-\nnities (A. J. Lee, Hobson, & Katarski, 1996). Thus, despite\npolicy and legislation, there is still a degree of influence that\nstore managers have upon the range of products carried in\nremote stores and this can potentially affect dietary intake as\nwell as influence habit formation.\nPrice. The price of food in RIC in the Northern Territory is\nsignificantly higher than in Darwin or regional centers such\nas Alice Springs. The annual Northern Territory Department\nof Health Market Basket Survey found that the average cost\nof a food basket in remote stores across the Territory was\n4 SAGE Open\n(e.g., Alice Springs, Darwin, and Katherine; Department of\nHealth [DoH], 2015). This price differential is even greater\nwhen actual food purchasing data are used rather than that of\na hypothetical basket (60% vs. 53%). This price differential\nmeans that people in remote communities on low incomes\nare paying much more for food than urban living Australians\nFurthermore, research suggests that a healthy diet is more\nexpensive. Diets considered healthy based on lean meat, fish,\nand seafood; reduced fat dairy foods; whole grain cereals;\nand fruit and vegetables are more costly in terms of the\namount of kilojoules provided per dollar compared with high\nsugar and processed foods which are nutritionally poor but\ncheaper in energy value (Andrieu, Darmon, & Drewnowski,\nDarmon, 2005). Brimblecombe, Ferguson, Liberato, O'Dea,\nand Riley (2013) found that although diet could be improved\nwithin current expenditure, it would still not meet Australian\ndietary guidelines. The energy value of food appears impor-\ntant particularly for families experiencing financial con-\nstraints (Andrieu et al., 2005; Brimblecombe & O'Dea,\nResearch into the price elasticity of food in Australia\nfound that some categories of food are inelastic (bread, fresh\nvegetables, sugar, and jam) whereas for other categories,\ndemand is elastic (meat, rice, margarine, and preserved veg-\netables), and dairy products, fresh fruits, and some other\nmeat categories (ham, sausage, bacon) are estimated to have\nunit elastic demand (Ulubasoglu, Mallick, Wadud, Hone, &\nHaszler, 2010). It is likely that the elastic categories (where\npeople are sensitive to changes in price and stop or reduce\nbuying when price increases) compete with non-food items\nsuch as electricity bills and other household items including\nmobile phones. The mobile phone is a valued commodity\nand usage continues to increase in remote Australia (Kral,\nIn contrast to the concept of price elasticity/inelasticity, a\npaper based on the experience of Arnhem Land Progress\nAboriginal Corporation (ALPA) states that \"Aboriginal peo-\nple will pay almost anything for something they want; con-\nversely if they do not want something it is impossible to\nobserved an apparent increase in soft drink sales throughout\nthe Australian Government stimulus payment period\n(Brimblecombe et al., 2010). This suggests that while price is\nlikely to be an influencing factor, people also need to value\nthe item they are buying. Healthy food may be less valued\nfor some of the reasons outlined in this article and when\ngoods in general cost more, there is less money available to\nmake healthy food choices.\nPrice subsidies are a tactic being touted as a means of\nincreasing consumption of healthier food. A systematic\nreview examining the effectiveness of price subsidies in pro-\nmoting healthy food purchase and/or consumption found\nthat, with one exception, subsidies increased purchase and/or\nconsumption (An, 2012). Subsidies were trialed on a large\nscale in the Healthy Incentives Pilot which is a United\nStates\u00adbased project in which low-income households\nenrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\n(SNAP) received fruit and vegetable subsidies and found\nthat participants consumed almost 26% more fruit and veg-\netables than non-participants (Bartlett et al., 2014).\nAlong with independently owned stores, Outback Stores\nand ALPA are the two main organizations providing manage-\nment assistance to retail stores in RIC in the Northern\nTerritory. Both these organizations have health and nutrition\npolicies in place which are aimed at increasing and facilitat-\ning intake of healthy food in RIC. In relation to price, ALPA\nsubsidizes 100% of freight costs on fresh fruit and vegetables\n(ALPA, n.d.). Outback Stores are less prescriptive but state\nthat they \"employ effective pricing strategies favoring the\naffordability of healthy food lines\" (Outback Stores, n.d.).\nAn evaluation of these strategies could help inform similar\npolicies for independently managed RIC stores.\nMidstream Context\nMidstream social marketing focuses on the impact of peo-\nple's more immediate environment on behavior such as\nworkplaces, schools, local communities, and service deliv-\nery organizations (Gordon, 2013). This can also include\nfriends, family, and influential others (N. Lee, Rothschild, &\nSmith, 2011). Thus, social and cultural norms come into play\nin a midstream approach.\nDemand sharing.The distribution of goods and services in\nRIC Indigenous communities takes many forms. Demand\nsharing is one such form and relates to the \"demanding\"\nrather than sharing of resources such as use of vehicles, alco-\nhol, tobacco, and food (McDonnell & Martin, 2004). It is a\ncomplex behavior (Peterson, 1993) and can occur in both\nverbal and non-verbal forms and can be direct or indirect\n(Altman, 2011). It is not our aim to discuss the various ways\nin which demand sharing operates but rather to explain how\nit can impact upon consumer decision-making and choice at\nthe POP.\nThe literature suggests that demand sharing can influence\nchoice at the POP in three ways: First, as a practice where\npeople purchasing food are obligated culturally through kin-\nship ties to buy or provide food for others when requested\nexample of a woman purchasing extra food knowing others\n(in addition to those in her household) would request a share.\nSecond, through avoiding such requests (or potential\n\"demands\") by keeping food purchases to a minimum or by\nbuying takeout to ensure there is no \"extra\" food which can\nbe requested by others (Saethre, 2005, p. 7) or by being selec-\ntive in the types of foods purchased to minimize cost in shar-\ning food. Finally, people may also choose times of the day to\nshop when they believe fewer people will be demanding food\nHenryks and Brimblecombe 5\nand may therefore purchase and consume more expensive\nitems in these visits (Saethre, 2005). In each instance, the\nconcept of demand sharing influences what food is pur-\nchased at the store level.\nIndulging children.Similar to the rise of \"pester power\" in\nnon-Indigenous households throughout Australia (Dixon,\nScully, & Parkinson, 2006), children in RIC can have a sig-\nnificant impact upon what is purchased at the store or super-\nmarket. Children's demands for sweet food and drink are at\nmost times indulged and these demands become a driver of\nfood provisioning and consumption (Hamilton, 1981). Peter-\nson (1993) discussed the upbringing of children as \"highly\nindulgent\" (p. 863) compared with typical Anglo-Saxon\nchild-rearing practices. Similarly, Kruske, Belton, Ward-\naguga, and Narjic (2012) found that Indigenous beliefs\naround children are markedly different to those of non-Indig-\nenous. This includes the belief that \"each child is an indepen-\ndent, autonomous human being, capable of communicating\nsurprisingly, this impacts upon parental choices in food deci-\nsion making and provisioning.\nA midstream approach could focus on modifying social\nnorms around healthy eating and in feeding children. Current\nnorms include indulging children such as meeting demands\nfor unhealthy food and drinks. Further research needs to be\nundertaken to better understand these cultural norms and\nhow they specifically influence and impact upon healthier\neating practices. Other midstream approaches that are already\nin practice include the policy work undertaken by some\nIndigenous organizations to manage the supply of healthy\nfood in their communities (Butler et al., 2011). Having store\npolicies that ensure confectionery is not placed at eye level\nof children or within easy reach could assist parents in cop-\ning with demands of children.\nFood literacy.Consumer knowledge of what constitutes\nhealthy food is important if people are to consciously choose\nfood that is nutritionally sound. It has been recognized as a\npriority in the recent National Aboriginal and Torres Strait\nIslander Health Plan (Commonwealth of Australia [CoA],\n2013). Food literacy can be defined as follows:\nA collection of inter-related knowledge, skills and behaviours\nrequired to plan, manage, select, prepare and eat foods to meet\nneeds and determine food intake.\nFood literacy is the scaffolding that empowers individuals,\nhouseholds, communities or nations to protect diet quality\nthrough change and support dietary resilience over time. (Vidgen\nAs identified in the above definition, food literacy needs\nto be considered at more than just an individual level: This\nreinforces that environmental and individual behaviors are\ninterdependent. For instance, if a community store in a RIC\nis stocked with a variety of highly prominent sugar-sweet-\nened breakfast cereals, individuals require knowledge and\nskills about how to make healthier choices in what is referred\nto as the \"obesogenic environment\" (Vidgen & Gallegos,\nRecent research into exploring ways of promoting and\nsupporting culturally appropriate healthier food choice in\none RIC suggests that community members prefer to gain\nknowledge through practical means such as observing and\nparticipating in food gathering and preparation in a social\ncontext either in home, via family role models, or out of\nhomeincommunity-basedorganizations(Colles,Maypilama,\n& Brimblecombe, 2014). This approach to food literacy\nrequires further research but is consistent with earlier com-\nmunity-directed programs (Rowley et al., 2000). The find-\nings of two recent studies suggest dietary benefits for\nAboriginal participants from \"hands-on\" programs that aim\nto enhance food preparation and food literacy skills (Abbott,\nDavison, Moore and Rubinstein, 2012; Nilson, Kearing-\nSalmon, Morrison & Fetherston, 2015; Pettigrew, Jongenelis,\nIndigenous people probably share a common knowledge\nof healthy/unhealthy food as the general Australian popula-\ntion, but perceive non-Indigenous people to have a much\ngreater knowledge of non-traditional food products and diet\nequivalent to their in-depth understanding of traditional\nDownstream Context\nFinally, downstream social marketing focuses on the indi-\nvidual and tends to place responsibility for change with the\nconsumer. As such, it's often been criticized for ignoring the\nlarger environmental issues and other social determinants of\nhealth that are beyond the control of the individual (Donovan,\nbehavior occurs and such programs clearly have their place\nin a holistic approach to the issue. It is also the arena where\nmost service providers engage. For example, public health\nnutritionists providing nutrition services to communities not\nonly provide dietary counseling to patients referred to them\nthrough health services but also often carry out cooking dem-\nonstrations and other nutrition education and promotional\nactivities. Other examples in the non-government arena\ninclude programs such as the Uncle Jimmy Thumbs Up!\noperated by the Jimmy Little Foundation. This program uses\nmusic, education, and store signage to promote healthier\nfood choices among young people in RIC.\nThe majority of consumer purchase decisions are made at\nthe POP. This includes any decisions made at the store\nincluding at the shelf, end of aisle, and check out. Inman,\nWiner, and Ferraro (2009) found that just under half of con-\nsumer buying decisions are made at POP although this can\nincrease to 93% depending upon the context. Other market\n6 SAGE Open\nresearch has estimated this figure to be around 90% (Gander,\n2005). Intuitively, this would suggest the POP to be an area\nworth exploring in relation to consumers in RIC. In the con-\ntext of RIC, research has not identified a clear and cohesive\npicture of drivers that influence decision making and choice\nat the POP which could be used to enact social marketing\ncampaigns targeting behavioral change. The remainder of\nthis article explores and maps both store and individual POP\ninfluencers of food choice.\nPOP Store-Level Factors Affecting Consumer\nBuying Behavior\nPackaging. Packaging can play a role in product choice at the\nimpact a change of product packaging played in altering con-\nsumer behavior:\nDuring interviews a number of store managers detailed\nexperiences of products no longer selling because companies\nchanged their packaging.\nThese managers suggested that it was a failure by custom-\ners to recognize the new packaging as being the same prod-\nuct. Other research supports this. For example, McMillan\n(1991) argues that high brand loyalty to packaging is the\nresult of familiarity with packaging: \"If tea comes in a blue\npacket you don't buy it in a yellow one. The fact that one is\nBushells and one is Liptons is beside the point\" (p. 283).\nSince this study was undertaken (over two decades ago),\nthere is now increased television and media access in RIC\nand people are likely to be exposed to brands via advertising\nand other forms of communication not as easily available at\nthe time of the study. Either way, visual recognition and\nfamiliarity is a driver in food purchase behavior: If consum-\ners are unable to recognize a product, they are less likely to\nIn-store cues. In-store stimuli (such as shelf talkers and post-\ners) have been noted to increase the degree of involvement\nand consequently purchase, even with low involvement pur-\nchases (Mitchell & Harris, 2005); however, a review of spe-\ncific nutritional interventions on POP behavior found that\ngrocery store interventions were less successful than those in\nworkplaces and universities (Seymour et al., 2004) and POP\nin-store nutritional information had mixed results (Glanz &\nYaroch, 2004). In addition, people tend to go to those sec-\ntions of a retail outlet that they feel are relevant to their shop-\nping needs (Puccinelli et al., 2009). Other in-store cues\ninclude physical product placement on shelves and end of\naisle gondolas and displays. Chandon, Hutchinson, Young,\nand Bradlow (2009) used eye-tracking experiments and\nfound that although top- and middle-shelf positions gained\nmore attention than low-shelf positions, it was only products\nlocated in top shelf positions that led to brand evaluation, a\nprecursor to purchase. Hence, it is important to ensure that\nin-store behavior in RIC is understood so that signage and\nPOP cues are placed in high traffic areas and evaluated.\nArecent project by the Menzies School of Health Research\naimed at improving nutrition by developing a resource pack-\nage for using shelf labels that highlight and promote healthier\nfood and drink choices in RIC found there were several nutri-\ntional labeling programs used in RIC including Queensland\nHealth Green Label Program; Heart Foundation Tick and\nJimmy Little Thumbs Up! This research also tested commu-\nnity developed labels in four pilot sites and found that the data\nsuggested that \"shelf label projects could have the potential to\nincrease sales of labeled items within product groups where\nthere is a clear healthier option\" such as breakfast cereals\nIn addition, the appearance of fresh fruit and vegetables\ncan influence purchase. The quality of fresh fruit and vegeta-\nbles in RIC has been raised as an issue (Leonard, 2003).\nFactors such as storage, transportation, and poor retail stock-\ning and presentation practices can result in fresh fruit and\nvegetables appearing less than visually appealing.As appear-\nance is a key measure of quality in the fresh fruit and vegeta-\nble category, dried out, shriveled, or limp produce can deter\nPOP Influencers: Individual Factors Affecting\nPurchase Decisions\nHabit. Recent research suggests that most routine purchase\ndecisions are based on habit, constituting as much as 95% of\nbuying behavior (Martin & Morich, 2011). Habits make\nchoice at the POP easy as there is little conscious engage-\nment with the buying process: Consumers act on auto pilot\nand choice is based on repeat purchase behavior. For exam-\nple, a study of one remote community in the Northern Terri-\ntory, Lajamanu, found that despite the store stocking an\nassortment of food, only a narrow range of food was pur-\nchased. In particular, Saethre (2005) observed that only some\ntypes of food stuffs were purchased despite there being wider\nrange of food available for purchase (p. 155).\nA more recent study of food patterns in a remote commu-\nnity found that there was a high intake of refined carbohy-\ndrates and a low intake of fruit and vegetables (Brimblecombe\n& O'Dea, 2009), and a limited number of food types provid-\ning the majority of nutrients. The pattern was strong enough\nto suggest habitual buying behavior. Some research suggests\nthat this food habit stems from the days of rationing where\nwhite bread and sugar were staples (Saethre, 2011), and these\nstaples continue to form the basis of people's diets. This\nhabit results in a failure to purchase new potentially healthier\nfood unless consumers are encouraged to try these foods\nthrough marketing or sales promotions. The concept of habit\nplays an important role in food choice and is well recognized\nby the food industry in their use of marketing strategies to alter\nunfavorable brand buying behavior and encourage habitual\nHenryks and Brimblecombe 7\nbehavior aimed at brand loyalty. However, as yet, it has not\nbeen explored within the remote Indigenous context.\nThe role of habit (at the realm of the individual) has been\npreviously ignored in the RIC food context: possibly because\nthe focus is on finding things that are unique to the context\nrather than seeking similarities or sameness with consumers\nin the general Australian population. A rarely used theory\nwhich may assist in understanding habit is the Theory of\nInterpersonal Behavior (Bamberg & Schmidt, 2003; Triandis,\n1977). This considers behavior to be a function of intention;\nhabit and situational constraints or facilitators. With the\nexception of \"intention,\" we have explored in this article the\nimpact of habit and situational factors on the impact of food\nbuying in RIC. Further research is required on habit as is\nresearch into situational factors such as in-store cues--we\nwould suggest both are important in directing behavioral\nchange at the POP.\nAccording to the theory of interpersonal behavior, inten-\ntions are influenced by four factors including affect toward\nthe behavior (i.e., emotions attached to a behavior), cogni-\ntive consequences of the behavior, social norms, and obliga-\ntion to perform the behavior according to an individual's\nImproving our understanding in this area will assist the\ndevelopment of targeted social marketing strategies using\nnew technologies. For example, the increasing use of social\nmedia in RIC suggests this is a tool that can be incorporated\ninto a social marketing strategy. One approach could be to\ndevelop a mobile APP to assist people to make healthier food\nchoices at the POP allowing people to seek out the informa-\ntion they needed, when they needed it (Henryks,\nWho buying for. The recipient of the food can influence what\nis being purchased. A study in an urban Aboriginal commu-\nnity found that providing filling meals to satiate hungry chil-\ndren was a key concern of research participants (Adams\net al., 2012). This resulted in high energy foods, such as\nwhite bread spread with margarine, being utilized to \"fill up\"\nfamily members. In one remote community, people referred\nto \"lifelong foods\" to be those most commonly purchased\n(such as bread and sugar) as they filled one up, could be\nshared, and easily stored (Brimblecombe et al., 2014).\nAge.Older Indigenous people will often prefer familiar\nfoods including packaged and soft foods which could be\nrelated to poor dental health (K. Schouten, personal commu-\nnication, August 7, 20131). Other preferences relate to early\nlife experiences and current food supply and can include\nhigh consumption of tinned corn beef, fatty meat including\nlamb chops, sausages, and mince which is occasionally fla-\nvored with packet soup mix, damper, tea, sugar, white bread,\nand full cream milk powder (Kouris-Blazos & Wahlqvist,\nalso relates to habit as a POP driver.\nIn non-Indigenous communities, adolescents buying for\nthemselves are more likely to choose nutritionally poor food\nas health and nutrition concerns are not strong drivers of\nfood choice (Story, Neumark-Sztainer, & French, 2002).\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that children in remote com-\nmunities are given a lot of autonomy including their own\nmoney to shop and thus younger people buying for them-\nselves are often more likely to buy high sugar beverages in\npreference to water. Similarly in broader Australia, younger\npeople consume more high sugar beverages (ABS).\nMarketing and media influence.The impact of mainstream\nadvertising on remote community food choices is a topic that\nrequires further research, with a recent study (Brimblecombe\net al., 2014) citing this as a potential factor in the food choices\nmade by younger people in the community. Older people in\nthis community expressed concern for the influence they felt\nadvertising was having on young people's food choices.\nResearch from the early 1990s suggested that media cam-\npaigns and the mobility of Aboriginal people influenced\ndemands for branded sugar-sweetened products just as in\nnon-Indigenous Australia (McMillan, 1991). A recent sys-\ntematic review of food marketing to children found that\n\"food marketing influences children's food behavior and\ndiet-related health\" (Cairns, Angus, Hastings, & Caraher,\nthere is no evidence to suggest that children in RIC respond\ndifferently to marketing as children in other contexts.\nIncome.A characteristic of food purchasing in low-income\nand disadvantaged communities is the cycle of \"feast and\nfamine\" linked to the fortnightly income payment cycle\n(Saethre, 2005). Food is purchased when the payment is\nreceived and then as the fortnight progresses and money\ndwindles, food items considered staples and cheaper are pur-\nchased (which are often those with low nutritional value)\nuntil the money runs out or money is obtained from others. In\nthe feast part of the cycle, a larger range of foods (including\nfruit, vegetables, and meat) is purchased (Cutter, 1978, cited\nin NHMRC, 2000). Food insecurity is experienced at a much\nhigher rate in the Indigenous population than the non-Indig-\nenous. One in five Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peo-\nple live in a household where someone goes without food\nwhen the household runs out compared with less than one in\nConvenience and the practicality of cooking.Convenience in\nrelation to food in RIC does not only refer to the motivation\nto save time (as it often does in consumer behavior literature)\nbut carries other implications such as issues around the prac-\nticality of storage and food preparation. It is not uncommon to\nfind houses without adequate cold food storage or working\ncooking facilities (McDonnell & Martin, 2004; Saethre,\nnot considered functional in relation to infrastructure required\n8 SAGE Open\nfor the storage and preparation of food (Bailie & Runcie,\n2001). This included basic components such as a kitchen\nbench (missing in 26% of houses) stove top and oven (miss-\ning or not functional in 41% and 42% of homes respectively).\nFurthermore, only 42% of houses were identified as having a\nfunctioning refrigerator. Indicators suggest that not much has\nimproved. Health Habitat, working with Indigenous Austra-\nlians, found that only 6% of 7,800 houses tested between\nrequired to being able to store, prepare, and cook food\nprojects across Australia (and not just remote communities)\nthat have tested items in more than 7,500 houses and repre-\nsents the living conditions of over 50,000 Australians.\nSome forms of food preparation rely on access to stoves\nor microwaves and potentially refrigeration to store ingredi-\nents or prepared food that is not immediately consumed.\nOutdoor cooking is also an option; however, cooking on\nopen fires is complicated by the potential for demand shar-\ning. The process of cooking food outside may draw people\nwho can see the food and either directly or indirectly demand\na share (Saethre, 2011). In addition, cooking outside involves\nadditional effort and like non-Indigenous Australians, people\nin RIC do not always have energy or time to collect wood\nwhen they want to eat. However, it should be noted that these\nare observations and, to our knowledge, have not been\nexplored from the perspective of Indigenous people.\nThe lack of basic cooking and storage equipment influ-\nences buying behavior at the POP as people are more likely\nto purchase either prepared meals (e.g., takeout), food that\ncan be reheated in store (e.g., using store microwaves), or\nfood that requires minimal preparation (e.g., tinned meat and\nbread). If healthier convenience type foods are not available,\nthe purchase and consumption of less healthy options cannot\nbe prevented. These behaviors are a way of getting around\nhaving to cook and can also be viewed as a strategy to cir-\ncumvent the lack of cooking facilities; however, it also\nmeans that children of these households have limited expo-\nsure to and opportunity to learn food preparation skills.\nImplications and Further Research\nPOP drivers and influencers provide guidance for developing\na social marketing strategy to address the challenge of nutri-\ntion in RIC. These factors individually or in tandem drive\ndecision making at the POP. The results of colonization\nincluding the transition from a traditional food diet to a non-\ntraditional diet that is high in refined carbohydrates and\nsodium and low in fiber and several micronutrients has\nresulted in entrenched poor health issues and thus long-term\nplans are critical: change will not happen in the short term.\nHowever, with many stores now being owned by the com-\nmunity in which they operate, opportunities exist to research\neffective POP strategies that would not only support but also\nfacilitate healthier eating in RIC.\nThe role of habit (the realm of the individual) has been\npreviously ignored in the RIC food context: possibly because\nthe focus is on finding things that are unique to the context\nrather than seeking similarities or sameness with consumers\nin the general Australian population. As previously stated,\nfurther research is required on habit as is research into situ-\national factors such as in-store cues--we would suggest\nboth are important in directing behavioral change at the\nConclusion\nA significant health gap exists between Indigenous and non-\nIndigenous people in Australia where Indigenous Australians\nliving in remote communities carry a significant and dispro-\nportionate share of this gap. Inadequate or poor nutrition is\na key contributor to this health disparity and burden of dis-\nease for Indigenous Australians (Vos et al., 2007). The chal-\nlenge of poor nutrition in RIC has been researched from a\nvariety of disciplines and perspectives. This article adds a\nnew perspective on the issue by discussing the extant litera-\nture through the lens of social marketing. Specifically, driv-\ners of food choice at the POP have been mapped and\nalthough they have been drawn from existing literature, our\narticle suggests that in addition to upstream and midstream\napproaches, habit and intention should be a key focus for\nfuture research.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNote\n1.
