Bivariate\nanalysis identified significant differences between residence groups. Elders from less urbanized and thinly populated\nnonmetropolitan counties had the highest likelihood of admissions, while older residents of large metropolitan areas\nhad the lowest. In multivariate models, differences by residence could not be accounted for by sociodemographic,\nhealth, and social support network characteristics that are known to influence admissions. Further research is needed\nto identify the specific community context factors that account for variation by place of residence in admissions\nexperiences.\nIN most comparisons of social service and health care\nresources, older adults who live in sparsely populated and\ngeographically remote rural communities have a smaller\nnumber and narrower range of services available to them\nthan persons of the same age who reside in more urban and\nsuburban places (Coward et al., 1994). This pattern does not\nhold, however, for institutionalized care, where recent data\nsuggest that there is an abundance of nursing home beds in\nrural America. Shaughnessy (1994) has reported, for exam-\nple, that there are more nursing home beds per 1,000 elders\n(65 +) in nonmetropolitan counties than there are in metro-\npolitan counties (62 vs 45, respectively). Census data also\nconfirm that there is a greater prevalence of elders residing in\ninstitutional settings in nonmetropolitan compared to metro-\npolitan counties (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992). Speci-\nfically, in 1990, 6.0 percent of nonmetropolitan elders were\nliving in institutions, compared to 5.1 percent of metropoli-\ntan older adults (see Table 1).\nAlthough both of these types of data (i.e., bed supply and\nprevalence of different living arrangements) suggest that\nolder adults who reside in rural contexts may be at greater\nrisk of entering a nursing home, neither is a direct measure of\nthe incidence of admissions (i.e., the rate of occurrence of\nnew events). Moreover, there are admissions dynamics that\ncould conceivably disrupt, or reduce, the correspondence\nbetween prevalence and incidence. For example, if there is\nsubstantial cross-over between geographic types (e.g., rural\nresidents entering nursing homes in urban areas), then esti-\nmates based on prevalence could mask the true magnitude of\nthe differences in incidence that exist between community\ncontexts. Because an individual can seek care in a locale that\nis different from where they live (e.g., choosing a nursing\nhome that is located closer to where his or her family\nresides), patient origin studies are a preferred method of\nestimating the effect of community context on service utili-\nzation (i.e., examining where a person lives as opposed to\nthe location of the receipt of the service).\nIn a similar manner, if discharge patterns were to vary sig-\nnificantly by the location of a facility, similar incidence rates\nwould lead to different prevalence rates. For example, if\nresidents of rural nursing homes have longer average lengths\nof stay compared to urban nursing home residents -- perhaps\nbecause the lack of home health services in rural areas\n(Kenney, 1993) makes discharge planning more difficult --\nthen similar rates of incidence would lead to different rates\nof prevalence. Or, if rural residents survive longer than\nurban residents after entering a nursing home -- because\nthey enter younger and less disabled as suggested by Greene\n(1984) -- then similar rates of incidence would lead to\ndifferent rates of prevalence. Ultimately, the most direct test\nof the hypothesis that rural residents are at greater risk of a\nnursing home admission than their counterparts who reside\nin more urban and-suburban settings is incidence data based\non the place of residence of the elder, not prevalence data\nbased on the location of the facility.\nTwo previous studies have compared residential differ-\nences in the incidence of nursing home admissions over time\n(Coward, Home, and Peek, 1995; Dwyer, Barton, and\nVogel, 1994). Unfortunately, their findings are completely\ncontradictory. In the Coward et al. study, rural elders were\nmore likely to have experienced a nursing home admission\nthan older adults who resided in more urban and suburban\nplaces, whereas Dwyer and colleagues found that rural\nelders had a lower incidence of admission. Although the\ninconsistency between these two studies is probably in large\npart a function of methodological and definitional differ-\nences, the ability to generalize from either study is severely\nconstrained because each examined only a limited subset of\nthe aging population. Coward, Home, and Peek tracked\nolder adults who were experiencing urinary incontinence,\nTable 1.

Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office.\nwhile Dwyer, Barton, and Vogel examined elders with\nchronic difficulties performing activities of daily living\n(ADLs) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).\nThus, there is still not creditable evidence of residential\ndifferences in the incidence of nursing home admissions\namong older adults because the two studies that have exam-\nined this issue have produced findings that are inconsistent\nand cannot be generalized to the full population of elders\nwho are at risk of being placed in a nursing home.\nThe supposition that individuals' place of residence will\ninfluence their admission into a nursing home evolves from a\nconceptualization of \"disability\" advanced by Verbrugge\nand Jette (1994). They argue that disabilities arise from a\ndiscordance between an individual's functional capacity and\nthe demands of the environment in which they live. Thus,\nwhether a specific functional limitation becomes a disability\ndepends in part on the ecological context in which the person\noperates.\nThere are a number of characteristics of aging in a rural\nenvironment that could potentially reduce the ability of an\nolder adult to remain living independently in community\nsettings. For example, as indicated previously, rural elders\nhave access to a smaller number and narrower range of in-\nambulatory services (Wallace and Colsher, 1994). There is\nevidence that these deficiencies may lead rural elders to\nconclude that they have very few alternatives but to enter a\nnursing home when their health declines. Specifically,\nnewly admitted residents of nursing homes from rural areas\nare twice as likely as those from more urban and suburban\nsettings to report that there were services that they had\nneeded that were not available in the communities where\nthey lived (Coward, Duncan, and Freudenberger, 1994). At\nthe same time, the physical isolation of the homes of many\nrural elders may contribute to them feeling more apprehen-\nsive and uncomfortable about continuing to live indepen-\ndently as their health declines or following an acute illness or\nfall (Freudenberger-Jett et al., 1996). Perhaps as a conse-\nquence of these circumstances, Greene (1984) has observed\nthat older persons in Arizona who entered nursing homes\nfrom rural areas were younger and less disabled than their\ncounterparts from more urban and suburban locations.\nThe primary purpose of this research, therefore, is to\nexplore further the effect of community context on the\nincidence of nursing home admissions. Assuming that resi-\ndential differences do exist, our second purpose is to deter-\nmine if those differences can be explained by sociodemo-\ngraphic, health, and social network characteristics that\nprevious research has identified as influencing a nursing\nhome placement.\nCompared to previous research, there are several impor-\ntant improvements in the methods and procedures that we\nemploy in this study. As a consequence, this investigation\nwill be in a position to provide better evidence for the\nhypothesis that community context affects the odds of an\nolder adult experiencing a nursing home admission. For\nexample, the sample that we use includes older adults of all\ndisability levels, not just those who are functionally im-\npaired or who are suffering from a particular chronic illness.\nThus, it is more representative of the full range of older\nadults who may potentially seek nursing home care. Second,\nwe examine all nursing home admissions, not just those of a\nduration of 90 days or more (as was done by Dwyer, Barton,\nthat nursing home stays of 90 + days account for slightly\nless than half of all admissions. As a consequence, we are\nable to address the question of whether there are residential\ndifferences in overall admissions, not just in a subset of\nadmissions of a certain type. Finally, the residence contin-\nuum that we use to compare and contrast the likelihood of\nexperiencing a'nursing home admission (a variation of the\nmetropolitan-nonmetropolitan continuum that has been em-\nployed previously by Coward, Home, and Peek, 1995) is\nconsistent and compatible with previously collected data on\nboth nursing home bed supply (Shaughnessy, 1994) and the\nprevalence of nursing home occupancy (U.S. Bureau of the\nCensus, 1992). Therefore, we will be able to make direct\ncomparisons between these three sources of data, in effect\ntriangulating evidence on patterns of utilization.\nImproving our understanding of potential residential dif-\nferences in nursing home admission rates is important for\nseveral reasons. First, the substantial cost of public subsidies\nfor nursing home care is a critical concern for elected\nofficials and policymakers who anticipate a growing need for\nsuch services as the \"baby boom\" generation reaches old\nage. Thus, a better understanding of even modest variations\nin use is of consequence because the fluctuations by resi-\ndence that have been observed represent thousands of admis-\nsions and millions of dollars of expenditures (Coward,\nDuncan, and Uttaro, 1996). Second, any effort to minimize\nvariations in rates of admission is dependent on a better\nunderstanding of the underlying factors that account for the\ndifferences that have been observed. To date, it is not only\nunclear whether residential differences in the incidence of\nnursing home admissions exist, but also, if they do, whether\nthe variation that is observed can be attributed to the place of\nresidence of the elder per se or is a result of other risk factors\nthat covary with residence.\nMETHODS\nSampling\nThe data used in this research are from the Longitudinal\nthe LSOA were collected as part of the Supplement on Aging\nto the 1984 National Health Interview Survey. Follow-up\ninterviews were conducted (by telephone and mail) with a\nsubsample of the original SOA sample (N = 7,527) in two-\ninterviewed only a subset of the full sample. However, when\nthe full sample was reinterviewed in 1988, individuals (or\ntheir proxies) were asked about their nursing home admis-\nsions since the time of their last interview (which for most\nwho were aged 70 years or older at the time of the original\ninterview in 1984 were included in the follow-up interviews.\nIn all subsequent contacts, proxies were interviewed when\npossible for all individuals who died, were residing in an\ninstitution, or could not be located.\nIn this investigation, we use the unweighted LSOA data\nfor a variety of reasons. First, because weights for the six-\nyear period are only available for those persons who were\ninterviewed in 1986, the use of weights would substantially\nreduce the size of the sample available for analysis (from\nloss of respondents is not random. That is, those persons\nwho were interviewed in 1986 are not a random sample of\nthe full set of respondents. Rather, they are disproportion-\nately representative of the oldest-old (80 +) and minorities.\nThird, because of these selection criteria, the proportion of\nrespondents excluded in 1986 is not uniform across residen-\ntial areas (i.e., the criteria result in different sampling\nratios). Fourth, as a consequence of the selection criteria, the\nnursing home admission rates for those persons who have\nweights (17.1%) are significantly higher than for those re-\nspondents without weights (9.2%) (analysis not shown).\nFifth, because our primary focus is a multivariate model that\nincludes controls for the major factors on which the sample\nis weighted (e.g., age, race, and income), the principal\neffects of these factors are taken into account. Finally,\nprevious research has demonstrated that the use of complex\nschemes to take into account the disproportionate stratified\nmultistage cluster sampling design used in the LSOA has\nlittle impact on variance estimation (Fitti and Kovar, 1987;\nThe Dependent Variable\nThe dependent variable in this analysis is whether the\nrespondent experienced admission to a nursing home at any\n2 in Coward, Home, and Peek, 1995, for a description of the\nexact variables in the LSOA that are used to construct this\nmeasure). If the respondent had been admitted to a nursing\nhome, the variable was coded \" 1 . \" If there was no nursing\nhome admission, it was coded \" 0 . \" Of the 7,527 elders who\nwere living in the community in 1984, about one in seven\nhome admission during the ensuing six-year period.\nThe Independent Variables\nIn addition to the place of residence of respondents, we\nexamined a wide range of other personal characteristics using\nLSOA baseline data from 1984. Each of the variables that we\nselected for inclusion in the study has been identified in\nprevious research as a predictor of nursing home admissions.\nWe organized the variables into three general sets, similar to\nthose previously employed by Dwyer, Barton, and Vogel\ngraphic characteristics (Belgrave and Bradsher, 1994;\nhealth characteristics (Branch and Jette, 1982; Hanley et al.,\nand social support characteristics (Greene and Ondrich,\nSociodemographic characteristics. -- In this study, we\nincluded seven sociodemographic variables that character-\nize the individual. Age, measured in years, was treated as a\ncontinuous variable. Five of the variables (gender, marital\nstatus, race, receipt of Medicaid, and home ownership)\nwere measured as dichotomies. Respondents were coded\n\" 1 \" when they were male, married, non-White, received\nMedicaid, or owned their own home; otherwise, they were\ncoded \" 0 . \"\nOn the original LSOA, the yearly income of respondents\nwas an ordinal level variable coded into nine categories.\nBecause of small cell sizes across some of the residence\ncategories, we collapsed the original income groups into 5\nelders (17.2% of the full sample), however, who did not\nreport income. Rather than eliminating these respondents\nfrom the analysis, we explored alternate methods for imput-\ning values for the missing income data (Rovine and Delaney,\n1990). For example, we first examined the possibility of\ncreating a direct estimate of the missing values by employing\nregression techniques (using existing data on the demo-\ngraphic characteristics of the respondents such as age, gen-\nder, and race). Because of the weak predictive power of\nthese variables, however, we abandoned this approach. We\nthen examined the use of two alternative methods of imputa-\ntion: (1) creating a missing value category of income to\ndetermine if individuals who had not reported their income\nhad rates of institutionalization that were different from\nthose who had; and (2) randomly assigning income values to\nrespondents with missing income proportional to their distri-\nbution in each of the income values where data were avail-\nable, an approach that preserves the central tendency, dis-\npersion, and variance of a variable (Beaulieu and Miller,\n1984). We estimated models using both techniques (not\nshown) and observed the same results. In the Results sec-\ntion, however, we report only the model where a missing\nvalue category was employed.\nHealth characteristics. -- Five variables were used as\nindicators of the health and functional status (both physical\nand mental) of the elders in the sample. Respondents were\nasked to self-rate their health as excellent, very good, good,\nfair, or poor and were asked if they had been admitted to a\nhospital in the previous 12 months (1 = yes; 0 = no). In\nterms of functional health, respondents were asked about\ntheir difficulty performing ADL and IADL tasks. ADL tasks\nincluded difficulties in bathing or showering, dressing, eat-\ning, getting into or out of bed/chair, walking, getting around\noutdoors, and using the toilet. IADL tasks included limita-\ntions with such activities as meal preparation, shopping,\nlight and heavy housework, managing money, and using the\ntelephone. Responses were treated as continuous with a\nrange of 0-7 for ADL difficulties and 0-6 for IADL difficul-\nties. Fifty-three respondents were missing information on\nADL difficulties and 36 respondents had missing informa-\ntion on IADL difficulties. In both cases, we substituted the\nmean for those who were missing on the ADL (mean = .71)\nor IADL (mean = .73) tasks.\nFinally, perceived mental functional status was measured\nby two variables: how often respondents had difficulty re-\nmembering things and how often they got confused. Re-\nsponse choices for both questions were: never; frequently;\nsometimes; rarely; and had trouble, but unknown how often.\nThose respondents who reported frequent problems were\ncoded as \" 1 \" ; otherwise, responses were coded as \" 0 . \"\nResponses to both questions were summed to yield a per-\nceived mental status index. Seven hundred forty-seven re-\nspondents did not answer these two questions because they\nwere either mentally or physically incapable (n = 436) or\nfor other reasons (n = 311) (e.g., they were temporarily\nabsent). For the mentally infirm, proxies were interviewed\nand we aggregated those 436 individuals with the elders who\nhad reported frequent mental impairments. For those who\ngave other responses, we randomly assigned them to either\nthe frequent or the not frequent groups proportional to the\ndistribution of those categories in the sample who had\nanswered the questions (see Beaulieu and Miller, 1984, for a\nmore complete explanation of this procedure).\nSocial support characteristics. -- Four social support\ncharacteristics were included in our analysis to measure the\nextent of social support available to the respondent. The first\nof these is the number of living children, which is a continu-\ndents who had missing values on this variable. Because this is\na small number of the overall sample (4.7%), we substituted\nthe mean number of children (2.45) for those respondents.\nTwo additional variables indicate whether the elder received\npaid or unpaid help from other individuals. In both cases, if\nthe respondent received help (either paid or unpaid) this was\ncoded as \" 1\" and was coded as ' '0'' otherwise. The paid and\nunpaid help variables are not mutually exclusive; therefore,\nthe elder may be receiving both types of help. The final\nmeasure of social support was the elder's living arrangement.\nThis variable was coded into three categories: lives with\nrelatives or nonrelatives (no spouse present); lives with a\nspouse; and lives alone. The vast majority of those who lived\nwith a spouse lived in two-person households (87.4%); only a\nsmall proportion lived with a spouse and others.\nArea of residence. -- The residence variable in the LSOA\nis a variation of the 17-level residence codes established by\nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture (Gesler and Ricketts,\n1992). The basic unit of classification for this scheme is the\ncounty. Counties are first divided into metropolitan and\nnonmetropolitan categories (nonmetropolitan counties have\nno towns or places with 50,000 or more inhabitants and are\nnot part of a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area\n[SMSA]). Then, within these two classifications, counties\nare further divided into groups according to the size of their\npopulation. Metropolitan counties are classified according to\ntheir total population, whereas nonmetropolitan counties are\nordered in terms of the number of \"urban\" residents in the\ncounty (i.e., the number of persons living in places that have\npopulations of 2,500 or more residents). Finally, among\nnonmetropolitan counties that have similar numbers of \"ur-\nban\" residents, counties are further divided into those that\nare adjacent to a metropolitan county and those that are not.\nThe LSOA classifies individuals into 10 residence codes.\nHowever, because of the small number of older persons in\nsome of the categories, combined with the low incidence of\nnursing home admissions, we aggregated the 10 categories\ninto four groups (following the same categorization used\npreviously by Coward, Home, and Peek, 1995). Thus, the\nfinal residential code included two different types of metro-\npolitan categories (large and medium to small SMSAs) and\ntwo different types of nonmetropolitan counties (more ur-\nbanized nonmetropolitan counties and less urbanized and\nthinly populated nonmetropolitan counties). Table 2\npresents the original LSOA residential coding, the collapsed\ncategories, the total number of elders in each of the original\nresidence groups, and the number and percentage of nursing\nhome admissions experienced in each of the original resi-\ndence groups.\nRESULTS\nResidential Differences in Nursing Home Admissions\nand in the Factors That May Influence Admissions\nTable 3 presents comparisons of residential differences in\nrates of nursing home admissions across the six years of the\nLSOA, as well as residential differences in the sociodemo-\ngraphic, health, and social support characteristics of the\nelders in the sample. These distributions are for the un-\nweighted sample and, therefore, are not intended as popula-\ntion estimates.\nThe data in the top panel of Table 3 indicate that there\nwere significant residential differences in the number of\n(chi-square = 9.50; p = .02). Residents of both types of\nnonmetropolitan counties (i.e., more urbanized and thinly\npopulated) had higher percentages of elders who had experi-\nenced a nursing home admission across the six-year period\nTable 2.

These comparisons are informative be-\ncause they offer some insight into the factors that might\naccount for some of the residential variation in nursing home\nadmission rates that was observed. Indeed, there are many\nstatistically significant differences between the respondents\nwho lived in the four residential contexts on these factors\nthat previous researchers have suggested influence nursing\nhome admissions..\nThere was not, however, a uniform pattern that systemati-\ncally placed the residents of one community type in a disad-\nvantaged position relative to their counterparts who lived in\nother settings. Thus, in general, elders living in either type of\nnonmetropolitan county, compared to elders living in either\nof the two metropolitan county types, would seem to be at\ngreater risk of a nursing home admission as a result of their\nTable 3.

At the same time, these same nonmetropo-\nlitan elders would seem to be at lower risk of institutionaliza-\ntion compared to their metropolitan counterparts as a result of\nthe higher proportion of males in their population, their\nmarital status and race, their greater home ownership, and the\nlarger number of living children they have. It is impossible to\ndetermine from these bivariate comparisons, however, what\nproportion of the variation between residence groups in rates\nof nursing home admissions is due to residence in a particular\ntype of community and how much is a function of these other\nfactors that covary with residence. In the next phase of our\nanalysis, therefore, we explore the simultaneous effects of\nboth the residence factor and the sociodemographic, health,\nand social network characteristics of the elders on nursing\nhome admission rates.\nLogistic Regression Models Predicting Institutionalization\nResults from two nested logistic regression models are\npresented in Table 4. In Model 1, the relationship between\nresidence and a nursing home admission is presented in the\ncontext of a logit model. This model indicates that elders\nwho live in either metropolitan category (both large and\nsmall to medium sized SMSAs) were significantly less likely\nto be admitted to a nursing home than elders who lived in\nthinly populated nonmetropolitan areas (the omitted group).\nThe coefficient for residents of the large SMSAs was -.244\n(p < .01) and translates into an odds ratio of .783 (using the\nimplied coefficient e~(~244). This indicates that older adults\nfrom thinly populated nonmetropolitan counties were 1.28\ntimes more likely to be admitted to a nursing home than\nelders living in large metropolitan areas. Similarly, the\nnonmetropolitan elders from less urbanized and thinly popu-\nlated counties were 1.22 times more likely (p < .05; odds\nratio = .821) to experience a nursing home admission than\nelders living in small to medium sized SMSAs (using the\nimplied coefficient e~(~ 197). In contrast, there was no statisti-\ncally significant difference between the elders from the two\nnonmetropolitan categories in their rate of experiencing a\nnursing home admission. These findings are consistent with\nthe chi-square analyses reported in Table 3 (top panel) but\nindicate more precisely which specific residential groups\nhave rates of nursing home admissions that are different\nfrom others.\nThe data in Table 3 also illustrate that there are important\ndissimilarities in the composition of the elders who live in\ndifferent residential contexts. Thus, our intent in estimating\na second multivariate model was to determine if the effect of\nresidence on nursing home admission rates could be ex-\nplained by other population characteristics that are thought\nto influence the probability of entering a nursing home.\nModel 2 in Table 4 presents this more fully specified multi-\nvariate logit model.\nThe addition of the sociodemographic, health, and social\nsupport characteristics vastly improves the overall fit of\nspecified model, however, the effect of residence on nursing\nhome admissions remains significant.

As was observed in\nModel 1, there were no significant differences in the rates of\nnursing home admissions between elders living in the two\nnonmetropolitan county categories.\nBecause we had selected characteristics that previous\nresearch had suggested were associated with greater risks of\na nursing home admission, it is not surprising that the data in\nModel 2 also indicate that a majority of the other characteris-\ntics that we measured were associated with an increased risk\nof entering a nursing home. For example, among the so-\nciodemographic variables, elders who were older, not mar-\nried, did not own their home, or who were White were more\nlikely to be admitted to a nursing home than their counter-\nparts in their respective groups. Those who perceived their\nhealth to be poor (compared to those who rated their health\nas excellent), those who had experienced a hospitalization in\nthe previous year, those who had more ADL and IADL\nlimitations, and those who frequently had problems with\nmemory and confusion also had increased odds of being\nadmitted into a nursing home at some point across the six-\nyear time span. Finally, among the social support character-\nistics, those elders who had fewer children, who received\nunpaid help, or who lived alone were at greater risk of a\nnursing home admission than their counterparts.\nIn summary, this multivariate analysis demonstrated that\nthe effect of residence on the odds of experiencing a nursing\nhome admission was statistically significant net of other risks.\nThis analysis suggests that the effect of residence on nursing\nhome admissions is not due only to compositional differences\nin the populations; at least with respect to the characteristics\nof the individuals, their health status, or their social support\nnetwork that were measured in this research.\nDISCUSSION\nThere are two principal findings of this investigation.\nFirst, consistent with existing prevalence data, this investi-\ngation found that the incidence of nursing home admissions\nvaries by the place of residence of the elder. Second, these\ndifferences by residence cannot be accounted for by the\ntraditional precursors of entering a nursing home that have\nbeen identified in previous literature. Thus, further research\nis needed to explain these residential differences.\nAlthough the findings of this investigation are consistent\nwith previous descriptions of residential variation in both the\nsupply of nursing home beds (Shaughnessy, 1994) and in the\nprevalence of nursing home residence among older adults\n(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992), the data and analyses\nthat have been employed offer an improved test of the\nhypothesis that older rural residents are at greater risk of\nexperiencing a nursing home admission than their counter-\nparts who reside in more urban and suburban settings.\nBecause of the longitudinal nature of the data that were used\n(thus the ability to identify new incidences of nursing home\nadmission), combined with our use of patient origin data and\nour ability to track admissions among a general sample of\nelders (as opposed to distinct subgroups of older adults), this\ninvestigation provides the best evidence to date that older\nadults living in sparsely populated and geographically re-\nmote rural environments are at the greatest risk of entering a\nnursing home. Given the substantial public subsidies that\nunderlie nursing home care, this improved understanding\nprovides a firmer empirical foundation from which future\npublic policy can evolve.\nThe finding of a higher incidence of nursing home admis-\nsions among rural elders also helps to resolve an inconsis-\ntency in the existing literature in this area. Previously,\nDwyer, Barton, and Vogel (1994) reported that rural elders\nhad a lower incidence of admissions. For the most part, the\ninconsistency between these studies is probably a function of\nthe different coding schemes that were used to depict resi-\ndential location. While the present investigation is based on\nan underlying metropolitan-nonmetropolitan residential\ncontinuum (identical to that used by Coward, Home, and\ngation uses an alternative scheme (roughly, but not exactly,\na rural-urban continuum). Although these two methods for\ndefining place of residence (rural/urban and metropolitan/\nnonmetropolitan) are overlapping, they are not coterminous.\nOur use of a metropolitan-nonmetropolitan continuum is\nalso similar to the classification schemes that have been used\nin most previous prevalence studies (Shaughnessy, 1994;\nU.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992) and, as a consequence,\nour findings are consistent with those earlier reports.\nThe second major finding of this investigation is that the\nresidential differences that were observed cannot be ex-\nplained by controlling for the effects of those sociodemo-\ngraphic, health, and social network characteristics that are\ncommonly thought to be the precursors of entering a nursing\nhome. Thus, the explanation of residential differences in\nadmission experiences lies beyond those factors that are\ntraditionally used to account for observed variations. Further\nresearch is needed to identify the specific community context\nfactors that account for variation in admissions by place of\nresidence.\nThere are several lines of inquiry for future research that\nwould appear to be promising, if data were available to\nexamine them. For example, geographical differences in the\nsupply of nursing home beds (Shaughnessy, 1994) and in the\navailability of home- and community-based alternatives to\nnursing home care (Kenney, 1993; Kenney and Dubay,\n1992) need to be taken into account. Unfortunately, we\nknow of no data source that permits the researcher interested\nin patterns of use to examine simultaneously the need for\ncare (i.e., the sociodemographic, health, and social support\ncharacteristics that are associated with needing nursing\nhome care), the supply and availability of specific services\n(including nursing home beds and alternatives to nursing\nhome care), and nursing home admissions rates over time.\nOur source of data, the LSOA, has information on only two\nof these three dimensions. As a consequence, we were\nunable to take into account geographic variability in the\nservices that are available to respondents, although we are\nwell aware that there are important discrepancies between\nIn a similar manner, there are also some emerging qualita-\ntive studies that indicate that the attitudes of older persons\nabout the possibility of entering a nursing home may vary by\nplace of residence (Freudenberger-Jett et al., 1996; Rowles,\nConcotelli, and High, 1996; Schoenberg and Coward, in\npress). These authors argue that the greater familiarity of\nrural residents with nursing home facilities (Schoenberg and\nCoward, in press), the greater involvement of rural nursing\nhome residents in community-based activities (Rowles,\nConcotelli, and High, 1996), and the greater use of nursing\nhome facilities by rural residents for community-sponsored\nactivities (Rowles, Concotelli, and High, 1996) may result\nin less reluctance among rural older persons about the\npossibility of entering a nursing home. Future researchers\nmay want to take into account the possibility of such attitudi-\nnal differences toward nursing home care as they seek\nexplanations for residential differences in patterns of use.\nAlthough the LSOA is an excellent source of information\nabout patterns of long-term care over time,-there are, never-\ntheless, some limitations to the data set. For example, we\nwere unable to distinguish between long-term and short-term\nadmissions. Thus, it is unclear if the differences in overall\nnursing home admission rates by residence that we observed\nin this investigation are present in both short-term and long-\nterm admissions or if they are concentrated in one or the\nother type. We also only have information on the place of\nresidence of respondents at Time 1. Therefore, we are\nunable to track the degree to which individuals change their\nplace of residence, particularly those who cross residence\ncategories, as their health declines. Litwak and Longino\n(1987) have suggested that older persons do migrate to be\ncloser to family members as their health declines. In a\nsimilar manner, Clifford et al. (1985) have speculated that\nrural elders who become widowed are more likely to move\nfrom remote isolated places of residence to larger population\ncenters to be nearer health and human services that they\nmight need than elders who already reside in more urban and\nsuburban settings. Unfortunately, we are unable to describe\nany of these potential movements across residence catego-\nries prior to elders entering a nursing home.\nIn addition, the methods we employed to analyze the data\nhave their limits. For example, it could be argued that place\nof residence is an endogenous variable in our models and,\nthus, its effect on nursing home admissions should be esti-\nmated as a two-equation recursive system. Moreover, if self-\nselection into place of residence is nonrandom, it would also\nbe necessary to correct for such a self-selection bias. Be-\ncause both endogenous variables (i.e., residence and nursing\nhome admissions) are discrete, the correction would require\nthe estimation of a bivariate logit or probit with selection\n(Dubin and Rivers, 1990). In the future, researchers may\nwant to employ such alternative methods for modeling these\nrelationships.\nThe analytical approach that we have taken in this investi-\ngation could be characterized as the \"long view.\" That is,\nwe have taken characteristics of the older person and their\nenvironment at Time 1 (T,; 1984) and examined their ability\nto predict an event over the course of a six-year period of\ntime. Although this approach is common in social gerontol-\nogy, and provides meaningful and useful information about\nthe personal characteristics and conditions that are the ante-\ncedents of a particular outcome (in this case, a nursing home\nadmission), this approach offers little insight into the con-\ntemporary events and circumstances that are associated with\nan incident. Thus, in addition to research that takes this\n\"long view\" on nursing home admissions, we also need\ndetailed investigations that attempt to identify and describe\nresidential differences in the specific events and processes\nthat precipitate a nursing home admission and the conse-\nquences of these different pathways to nursing homes on the\nlives of older adults and their families. It may be, for\nexample, that different types of events are the immediate\nprecipitators of a nursing home admission in a rural setting\ncompared to a more urban or suburban environment\n"
