Waddell  Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School\nof Medicine, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY\n Extrapolation from studies of chemical carcinogenicity in rodents, at high doses, to humans, at the\ntypically low doses to which we are exposed, has been one of the most controversial issues in toxicology.\nMany chemical carcinogenesis experiments currently are evaluated on a linear scale for dose. Log\ndose has been the standard for decades in pharmacology and toxicology for noncancer toxicities\nand there is no reason to think that it should not apply to chemical carcinogenesis. Furthermore,\nlog dose is consistent with fundamental principles of chemistry. Direct comparisons of linear and\nlogarithmic scales for dose illustrate the deceptive nature of linear plots for dose; low doses, which is\nwhere our interest lies in comparing human exposures, are compressed beyond evaluation by a linear\nscale. Unequivocal thresholds for carcinogenicity are shown when the dose-response curves for animal\nstudies done at high doses are evaluated on a log scale for dose. This observation now raises the issue\nof the relevance to human exposures of these high-dose experiments in animals. Studies analyzed by\nthis log dose to linear response procedure demonstrate that the thresholds from animal experiments\ncan be used to calculate safety factors for human exposure and that humans are more resistant than\nanimals to carcinogenesis from chemicals.\nKeywords. dose response, chemical carcinogenesis, extrapolation, risk assessment, thresholds\nINTRODUCTION\nThe shapes of dose-response curves were first analyzed critically by\nGaddum (1945) when he recognized empirically that dose should be plotted\non a logarithmic scale for a linear quantal response. Pharmacologists have\nbeen plotting dose on a logarithmic scale ever since that publication. Toxi-\ncologists have also used that scale for noncancer experiments but, for some\nunexplained reason, most authors of chemical carcinogenesis experiments\nhave instead preferred a linear scale for dose. Gaddum did not offer a basic\nscientific reason for the logarithmic scale, but Waddell (2002) proposed that\nthis was consistent with the concept of chemical potential and the law of mass\naction and that it should apply to all quantal responses, including chemical\ncarcinogenesis. The linear plot for dose is very deceptive and compresses low\ndoses so that evaluation in that range is impossible; however, this has not\nheretofore been clearly recognized. This paper is an attempt to demonstrate\nthat deception and the difficulty in evaluating effects at low doses. More\nAddress correspondence to William J.

The thresholds\nthat are demonstrated from the animal experiments can be used to calculate\nsafety factors for human exposure. In some instances human exposures are\nat or very near the thresholds in animal experiments (Waddell, 2003d). This\nindicates that humans are more resistant to the carcinogenic effect of at least\nsome chemicals.\nMETHODS\nSlideWrite Plus, Version 6, from Advanced Graphics Software, Encinitas,\nCalifornia, was used for all of the calculations and graphs, except of course\nthe figures reproduced from the original ED01 report. Data from the ED01\n(Littlefield et al., 1980) and the Peto et al. (1991) reports were used to plot the\npercent liver and esophageal tumors, respectively, against dose on either a lin-\near (as was done in the original reports) or a logarithmic scale. The Rozman\net al. (1996) scale is ideal for the abscissa; it was used for the logarithmic\nscale for three reasons. First, it is logarithmic for dose and linear for effect,\nwhich is consistent with fundamental principles of chemistry (Waddell and\nBates, 1969). Second, it is continuous down to one molecule, which allows\ncomparison of all doses. And third, it uses molecules per kilogram instead\nof mg/kg, ppm, and so forth, which allows direct comparison of compounds\nwith different molecular weights.\nRESULTS\nFigure 1 is reproduced from Figure 4 of the Littlefield et al. (1980) pub-\nlication to show how the original results of the ED01 study on 2-acetylamino-\nfluorene for liver neoplasms were presented for evaluation. Note that both\nabscissa and ordinate are linear scales and that the values for tumors in the\nunexposed animals are shown at zero dose. Figure 2 shows the same data,\non the same scales, after subtracting the number of tumors in each of the\ncontrol groups. The linear extrapolations for each of the three time intervals\ndo indeed appear to be pointed in the general direction of the 0, 0 origins;\nhowever, it should be noted carefully that the lines do not extend exactly\nto those origins. Figure 3 shows the range of doses that were studied in the\nED01 report; it also indicates how the extrapolations lie in the narrow space\nfor doses approximately at or below 1019. This is, of course, where our inter-\nest lies for extrapolation to doses to which humans likely might be exposed.\nFigure 4 shows the same doses that were used in the ED01 study plotted on the\nlogarithmic scale of Rozman et al. (1996) which demonstrates how much the\nlinear scale compressed the doses below 1019 and made it virtually impossible\nDose-Response Curves in Chemical Carcinogenesis 13\nFIGURE 1 The prevalence of liver neoplasms in sacrificed mice in respect to dose of 2-acetyl-\naminofluorene in the ED01 study.

Figure 5 shows the same data\nthat were presented in Figure 2, but now plotted on the logarithmic scale\nfor dose. With this plot all doses are placed in perspective and the intercepts\nwith the abscissa are readily evaluated.\nFigure 6 shows the data from Table 3 of the Peto et al. (1991) publication\nfor the percent esophageal tumors produced in rats from N-nitrosodiethyl-\namine in the drinking water. The data are plotted on linear scales for both\nthe abscissa and the ordinate as was done in the Peto et al. article. This\ndemonstrates how compression of the low doses deceptively suggests that the\nextrapolation may indicate that there is no threshold for tumor production\nfrom the chemical. Indeed, that was the conclusion of those authors. How-\never, careful inspection does show an intercept of the line on the abscissa\nabove zero. It is the compression of the scale, for low doses that is decep-\ntive. Figure 7 shows the same data plotted on the logarithmic scale, where all\ndoses are placed in perspective and the intercept of the extrapolation with\nthe abscissa well above a single molecule is clearly shown.\nFigure 8 shows a hypothetical chemical that produces tumors in 3.1% of\nthe animals when administered 55 mg/kg/day. The extrapolation is based on\nthe assumption that the data extend linearly to the 0, 0 origins. With this same\ninterpretation, in order to have only one tumor in a million individuals, the\ndose would be 0.002 mg/kg/day. Figure 9 illustrates how the same numbers\nFIGURE 6 Esophageal tumors from N-nitrosodiethylamine in male rats plotted on a linear scale for dose.\ncould be used to extrapolate to one in a million deaths from actual data\non highway deaths in the United States per thousand injuries at a speed of\n55 mph (Baker et al., 1992).

Indeed, it is the basis of the distinction between pharmacology and\nFIGURE 9 Extrapolation of deaths per thousand injuries at 55 mph by same procedure as that used in\nthe linearized multistage. Data at 55 mph are from Baker et al. (1992).\ntoxicology. The transition from a useful, therapeutic, or pharmacological\neffect to an adverse or toxic effect depends on the dose, and the nature\nof that transition is described by the dose-response curve. Gaddum (1945)\nwas the first to recognize and describe, based merely on empirical observa-\ntions, that biological measurements (and in particular dose of a chemical)\nshould be considered on a logarithmic scale in order to effect a linear quan-\ntal response. He further introduced the additional statistical correction for\nnormal distributions by incorporating the standard deviation into his \"log-\nnormal distribution\" graphs or probit plots. Pharmacologists have used probit\npaper to obtain linear correlations between doses of chemicals and effects\nfor decades. There seems to be no criticism of this time-honored relation-\nship. Toxicologists have also considered this relationship as standard for all\nnoncancer adverse effects. However, it is curious that, when carcinogenesis\nis under discussion, dose is usually considered on a linear scale. Perhaps this\narose from the notion that a single molecule might produce cancer and that\njust a few molecules were important; consequently, logarithmic notation was\nconsidered unnecessary.\nThis \"linear-dose\" thinking has predominated in the analysis of chemical\ncarcinogenesis and, in particular, in extrapolation from experiments in ani-\nmals to risk assessment in humans. The principle of this thinking presumes\nthat any dose or doses that cause a statistical increase in tumors in experi-\nmental animals can be assumed to decrease linearly, with dose on a linear\nscale, to zero dose. This assumes that, in a sufficiently large population, zero\ntumors will be produced only with a zero dose of the chemical. Humans are\nbeing exposed to an increasing number of chemicals that have been shown\nto be carcinogenic in animals, and epidemiological studies frequently do not\nconcur that there is an increase in cancer in humans exposed to these same\nchemicals. Consequently, many observers have questioned this assumption\nof a linear extrapolation to zero dose (e.g., to cite but a few, Waddell 1993,\nAlthough Gaddum (1945) recognized empirically that dose on a logarith-\nmic scale effected a linear quantal response, he apparently did not recognize\nthe fundamental principle that explained it. The logarithmic relationship of\ndose to any quantal response emanates from basic principles of chemistry.\nThe chemical potential of a substance, when its chemical potential in the\nstandard state is zero, may be stated as follows: \u00b5 = RT ln a, where \u00b5 is the\nchemical potential whose activity is represented by a, R is the gas constant,\nand T is the absolute temperature. Alternatively, differences in chemical po-\ntential between two activities (concentrations) are directly proportional to\nthe logarithm of the ratios of the activities: \u00b51\n= RT ln a1\n- RT ln\n= RT ln (a1/a2). Another consideration is the law of mass\naction: A + B  C + D, where A, B, C, and D represent concentrations of\nreactants and products, respectively. The displacement from equilibrium, or\nDose-Response Curves in Chemical Carcinogenesis 19\nsteady state, of this reaction by the addition of an additional quantity of A\nwill depend on the concentration of A at the initial equilibrium (or steady\nstate). For example, the addition of 1 mmol of A will have a greater effect on\nthe reaction if the concentration of A is 1 mmol at initial equilibrium than it\nwill if the initial concentration of A is 100 mmol.\nThe direct comparisons of dose on linear and logarithmic scales in this\npaper are intended to demonstrate the artifactual problem with the linear\nplot. Not only is it not consistent with the basic principles of chemistry, but\nit makes discernment of events in the low-dose range impossible.\nPrevious publications using the Rozman scale for the analysis of chemical\ncarcinogenesis experiments in animals mostly show thresholds in animals\nthese cases a safety factor can be shown. In other studies, human exposures\nare at or very near the animal thresholds, yet no human cancers are seen at\nthese doses (Waddell, 2003d). This is interpreted to indicate that humans are\nmore resistant to the carcinogenic effect of these chemicals and gives some\nreassurance of safety even when humans are exposed to the threshold dose\nin animals.\nFigures 8 and 9 are merely intended to illustrate the severe flaw in a\nlinear extrapolation that forces the line through the 0, 0 origins. By ignoring\ninformation in the low-dose (or low-mph) range, absurd results are obtained.\nFor example, the number of deaths at only 1 or 2 mph may already be zero\nwithout extension to 0.002 mph. The shape of the dose-response, or deaths\nat different highway speeds, curves needs to be determined without forcing\nthe response through the 0, 0 origins.\nREFERENCES\nBaker SP, O'Neill B, Ginsburg MJ, Li, G.
