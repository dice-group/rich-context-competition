At present, although substantial pro-\ngress has been made in insulin preparation\nand medication, insulin administered via\nsubcutaneous injection still falls short of\nwhat is achieved by physiologically-secreted\ninsulin. Furthermore, insulin therapy can\ncause hypoglycaemia, weight increase and\niatrogenic hyperinsulinaemia, all of which\nmay increase the risk of vascular disease and\ninsulin resistance.3,4 Therefore, greater\nattention should be given to the insulin\ndose used in the treatment of patients with\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus.\nIt has been reported that patients with\ntype 1 diabetes mellitus receiving continuous\nsubcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) need a\nlower dose of insulin, compared with those\nreceiving multiple daily injections (MDI).5\u00ad7\nEvidence suggests that CSII also appears to\nbe a good alternative for the treatment of\npatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who do\nnot respond to MDI regimens.8 In China,\nneutral protamine hagedorn (NPH)-based\nMDI and CSII methods for glycaemic con-\ntrol are routinely used for hospitalized\npatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nHowever, there are insufficient numbers of\nrelevant studies discussing the optimal insu-\nlin dose for Chinese patients with type 2\ndiabetes mellitus. Therefore, this study\ninvestigated the insulin dose requirements\nof hospitalized Chinese patients with type 2\ndiabetes mellitus who were treated with\nMDI or CSII therapy for 2 weeks.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nThis randomized prospective clinical trial\nenrolled Chinese patients with type 2 dia-\nbetes mellitus who were hospitalized in the\nDepartment of Endocrinology, Linyi\nPeople's Hospital, Linyi, Shandong\nProvince, China between January 2010 and\nJuly 2012. All patients signed the consent\nform to participate in the research. This\nstudy was approved by the Medical Ethics\nCommittee of Linyi People's Hospital (ref-\nInclusion criteria\nThe diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus was\nestablished on the basis of the 1999 Diabetes\nDiagnostic Criteria of the World Health\nOrganization.9 Patients were hospitalized\nfor insulin therapy due to poor glycaemic\ncontrol. The inclusion criteria were as fol-\nlows: (i) diabetes symptoms (e.g. polyuria,\npolydipsia and unexplained weight loss) plus\na random venous plasma glucose concentra-\ntion >11.1 mmol/l or a fasting plasma glu-\ncose concentration >7.0 mmol/l (whole\nblood >6.1 mmol/l), or 2-h plasma glucose\nanhydrous glucose in an oral glucose toler-\nance test (2-h PBG); (ii) with no symptoms,\ndiagnosis was not based on a single glucose\ndetermination but required confirmatory\nplasma venous determination. At least one\nadditional glucose test result on another day\n(fasting, from a random sample or from the\n2-h post-glucose load) with a value in the\ndiabetic range was essential. If the fasting or\nrandom values were not diagnostic, the 2-h\nvalue was used.\nExclusion criteria\nThe exclusion criteria were as follows: (i)\npatients prescribed other oral hypogly-\ncaemic agents, except for metformin; (ii)\npatients with acute complications such as\ndiabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycaemic\nhyperosmolar status and diabetic lactic\nacidosis, severe or significant hepatic or\nrenal impairment, pregnancy, malignancy,\nor acute infection; (iii) late-onset type 1\ndiabetes as indicated by a positive result for\nislet-cell antibodies, glutamic acid decarb-\noxylase antibodies or tyrosine phosphatase\nantibodies, and a decrease in the serum\nC-peptide level.\nGroups and treatment\nPatients were randomly divided into either\nthe MDI or CSII group based on their\nhospitalization number, using a random\nallocation sequence (generated using a\nrandom-number table). Odd numbers were\nassigned to the MDI group; even numbers\nwere assigned to the CSII group.\nThe initial insulin dose for all study\nirrespective of the route of administration.\nThe patients in the MDI group were injected\nsubcutaneously (s.c.) with short-acting\nhuman insulin (biosynthetic human insulin;\nNovo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark)\nbefore meals, three times daily, as well as\nreceiving NPH insulin s.c. twice-daily (Novo\nNordisk). The initial NPH dose accounted\nfor 60% of the total daily dose, and the\nshort-acting human insulin accounted for\nthe remaining 40%. Patients in the CSII\ngroup were treated with insulin aspart\n(Novo Nordisk), using Medtronic\n(Northridge, CA, USA) insulin pumps. In\nthe CSII group, the initial basal dose\naccounted for 60% of the total daily\namount, and was divided into four periods:\nfor the remaining 40% and was distributed\ninto three pre-meal doses. These treatment\nregimens were undertaken for 2 weeks.\nBlood glucose was monitored by finger-\nstick blood samples eight times per day\n(before the three meals and 2 h later, and\nglucose monitoring device from LifeScan\n(Johnson & Johnson, Milpitas, CA, USA).\nEach patient's diet was adjusted according\nto the Chinese Guidelines for type 2 diabetes\nmellitus (reference/source not available).\nThe basal insulin dose was preferentially\nadjusted to control the blood glucose level\nwhen the pre-meal blood glucose was\n>9 mmol/l or the postprandial blood glu-\nstabilized glycaemic control for 3 days, the\ndaily insulin dose was adjusted when the\npre-meal and postprandial glucose levels\nrespectively.\nHypoglycaemia was deEned as blood\nglucose 3.9 mmol/l and the symptoms of\nhypoglycaemia were resolved by the admin-\nistration of oral carbohydrates, or a decrease\nof basal insulin or regular insulin doses\nbased on the pre-meal and postprandial\nglucose levels. Unconfirmed symptomatic\nhypoglycaemia, nocturnal hypoglycaemic\nepisodes and severe hypoglycaemic episodes\nwere not specifically recorded.\nClinical measurements\nBaseline clinical and demographic data for\nall of the study participants were collected\nfrom the medical records. Body mass index\n(BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height\n(m2). Venous blood samples were obtained\nfrom all of the participants after 8-h fasting\nand treated separately. All samples for\nglycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c\n) deter-\nmination were anticoagulated with\n1.8 mg/ml ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid\nand tested using an autoanalyser (D-10TM\nHemoglobin Testing System; BIO-RAD,\nHercules, CA, USA). Additional blood\nsamples were clotted at room temperature\nfor 15\u00ad20 min and then serum was obtained\n2\u00ad8C. These serum samples were used for\nthe determination of fasting serum C-pep-\ntide levels, using an ADVIA Centaur\u00d5 CP\nImmunoassay System (Siemens Healthcare,\nErlangen, Germany). Capillary whole-blood\nsamples collected after 8-h fasting were used\nfor the determination of fasting blood glu-\ncose (FBG) concentrations using a\nContour\u00d5 blood glucose meter (Bayer,\nWhippany, NJ, USA).\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nthe SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version 13.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. Quantitative data were\nexpressed as mean \u00c6 SD. Variables were\ncompared between the MDI and CSII\ngroups using an independent Student's\nt-test for continuous variables and 2-test\nfor categorical variables. A P-value < 0.05\nwas considered statistically significant.\nResults\nA total of 609 Chinese patients with type 2\n144 female) were randomized to the MDI\nrandomized to the CSII group (Figure 1).\nnewly diagnosed patients who had not\nreceived prior insulin treatment in the\nMDI and CSII groups, respectively. There\nwere no significant differences in the baseline\nage, sex distribution, proportion of newly\ndiagnosed patients, duration of diabetes,\nBMI, HbA1c\n, FBG, 2-h PBG and fasting\nserum C-peptide levels between the MDI\nand CSII groups (Table 1).\nIn the MDI group, 137 patients received\ninsulin therapy alone and 166 patients\nreceived insulin in combination with met-\nformin (mean \u00c6 SD insulin dose:\nmean \u00c6 SD total daily basal and bolus insu-\ntotal daily dose, respectively).\nIn the CSII group, 149 patients received\ninsulin therapy alone and 157 received insu-\nlin in combination with metformin\nper day; mean \u00c6 SD total daily insulin dose:\nbasal and bolus insulin doses were\nthe total daily dose, respectively). There\nwere significant differences in the total,\nbasal, and bolus insulin doses between the\nThe incidence of hypoglycaemia was 5.94%\nwere no serious adverse events recorded.\nDiscussion\nMany studies have demonstrated that CSII\ntherapy is more effective than MDI therapy\nin the treatment of patients with type 1\ndiabetes mellitus because CSII therapy can\nreduce the insulin dose required to achieve\npresent study, results showed that CSII\ntherapy could also significantly reduce the\ntotal daily insulin dose compared with MDI\ntherapy in Chinese patients with type 2\ndiabetes mellitus. The incidence of hypogly-\ncaemia during CSII therapy was also sig-\nnificantly lower than that during MDI\ntherapy.\nStudies have shown that short-acting\ninsulin analogues improve glycaemic control\nwithout increasing insulin dose in patients\nwith type 2 diabetes mellitus, meaning that\nthey can provide the same degree of gly-\ncaemic control with lower doses of insu-\nlin.15,16 Research has also focused on the\ndrug delivery method. For example, Phillip\net al.17 showed that the initial insulin dose\n(IU/kg) in MDI therapy, in patients with\ntype 1 diabetes mellitus, was significantly\nreduced after switching to CSII therapy. In\ncontrast, a meta-analysis of insulin replace-\nment in patients with type 2 diabetes\nmellitus found that, compared with MDI,\nthere was no difference in the daily insulin\ndose with CSII.18 Similarly, a study carried\nout in Indian patients with type 2 diabetes\nmellitus did not show a significant difference\nin the total daily insulin dose between MDI\nand CSII methods.19 In this present study,\nthe results showed that the mean \u00c6 SD\ninsulin dose per unit body weight for the\nsignificantly higher than that for the CSII\nwhich suggests that compared with CSII\ntherapy, the regulation of the basal dose\nwith MDI therapy was not optimal. These\ndata therefore indicate that CSII therapy\nmay be more effective than MDI therapy for\nChinese patients with type 2 diabetes\nmellitus.\nPostprandial blood glucose is affected by\nthree factors: FBG, glycogen output and the\nabsorption of intestinal glucose.

In healthy sub-\njects and patients with type 2 diabetes\nmellitus, the gastrointestinal absorption of\nglucose is analogous,20 and one of the roles\nof basal insulin is to restrain the output of\nglycogen.21 Basal insulin not only reduces\nFBG and pre-meal blood glucose, but also\npartially restrains postprandial hypergly-\ncaemia. When basal insulin treatment is\nused to reduce 2-h PBG, a lower dose of\npre-meal insulin is required as a supplement\nto control 2-h PBG. However, pre-meal\ninsulin treatment only restrains the glycogen\noutput and absorption-related increase of\nglucose. The Henry activity curve for insulin\nsuggests that the higher the concentration of\npre-meal insulin, the greater its effect on\nreducing non-meal blood glucose, and the\nstronger the `tail effect' on pre-meal glucose\nlevels.22 A lower pre-meal dose of insulin\ncan reduce the additive effect of the basal\ndose and thereby avoid modulating the\nbasal dose. Suzuki et al.23 showed that\nincreasing the basal insulin dose might be a\nuseful way to control FBG and HbA1c\nin\npatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose\nbasal insulin was switched from NPH insu-\nlin to insulin glargine. In this present study,\nthe total daily basal insulin dose was signifi-\ncantly higher in the CSII group than in the\nMDI group, demonstrating the advantage\nof CSII therapy.\nIn this present study, at least during a\nshort-term 2-week therapeutic intervention,\npatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated\nwith MDI showed a significantly higher\ntotal daily insulin requirement, a longer\nduration to achieve the target glycaemic\ncontrol, and a higher incidence of hypogly-\ncaemia compared with patients treated with\nCSII therapy. Therefore, CSII therapy may\nbe considered as an effective method to\nachieve good glycaemic control, with a\nlower total daily insulin dose due to an\nTable 2.
