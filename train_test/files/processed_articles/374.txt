Furthermore, low sugar-sweetened beverage in-\ntake and high physical activity levels appear to modify\neach others' effects of decreasing HOMA-IR and triglyc-\neride concentrations and increasing high-density lipo-\nprotein cholesterol concentrations.\nConclusions: Sugar-sweetened beverage intake and physi-\ncal activity levels are each independently associated with\ninsulin resistance\u00adassociated metabolic parameters and\nanthropometric measurements in adolescents.

Specifically, 2 lifestyle be-\nhaviorsassociatedwithobesity,insulinresistance,andmeta-\nbolic syndrome are (1) high levels of sugar-sweetened bev-\nerage (SSB) intake10-14 and (2) low levels of physical activity\n(PA).15-21 Dietary modifications and consistent exercise are\nthus 2 recommendations typically given by pediatricians\nto children and adolescents either at risk for or currently\ndiagnosed with these disorders.\nExperimental studies support the hypothesis that SSBs\nmay increase energy intake and induce weight gain via\ntheir reduced satiety response, the promotion of a posi-\ntive energy balance by liquid calories relative to isoen-\nergetic solid calories, and their dysregulation of energy\nhomeostasis.22-26 Although not all studies support an as-\nsociation between SSB consumption and obesity,27,28 SSB\nintake has nonetheless been associated with increased\nbody weight, increased fat mass, dyslipidemia, and blood\npressure.29,30 Experimental studies also suggest that in-\ncise acutely improves insulin sensitivity for up to 48 hours\nbecause of an increase in insulin-stimulated glucose trans-\nport and glycogen synthesis,40,41 and regular exercise train-\ning induces long-term changes within the skeletal muscle\nthat may improve whole-body insulin sensitivity.35 More-\nover, several clinical studies have shown that exercise im-\nThe increasing incidence and prevalence of obesity, in-\nsulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome in the pediatric\npopulation is well recognized44-47; however, the relation-\nship between insulin resistance\u00adassociated metabolic para-\nmeters and anthropometric measurements with SSB in-\ntake and PA levels in children and adolescents remains\npoorly understood. Furthermore, studies evaluating the as-\nsociation of SSB consumption and exercise with these con-\nditions are limited,16,48 which is unfortunate given that a\nbetterunderstandingofhowdietandPAarerelatedtothese\nconditions may provide clinical and public health infor-\nmation for prevention and treatment strategies.\nThus, to evaluate the relationship between insulin re-\nsistance\u00adassociated metabolic parameters and anthropo-\nmetric measurements with SSB intake and PA levels in the\nUS adolescent population, we analyzed these associations\nusing data from the National Health and Nutrition Exami-\nMETHODS\nThe NHANES is conducted by the National Center for Health\nStatistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and\nis designed to monitor the health and nutritional status of the\nUS civilian noninstitutionalized population. Since 1999,\nNHANES has been planned and conducted as a continuous an-\nnual survey, and data are released in 2-year periods (eg, 1999-\nlected annually using a stratified multistage probability cluster\nsample design49; oversampling Mexican American and black in-\ndividuals, adolescents aged 12 to 19 years, persons 60 years and\nolder, low-income white individuals, and pregnant women per-\nmits more precise estimates for these groups. This study is based\nthat had released all of the data needed for the inclusion cri-\nteria, exclusion criteria, and outcome variables. The NHANES\nprotocol was approved by the National Center for Health Sta-\ntistics institutional review board, and written informed con-\nsent was obtained from all participants aged 18 years and older;\nfor participants younger than 18 years, written informed as-\nsent was obtained in addition to parent or guardian consent.\nThis study was approved by the institutional review board at\nthe University of California, Davis.\nThe NHANES protocol consists of a home interview per-\nformed by a trained interviewer followed by a visit to an ex-\namination center where participants underwent physical ex-\naminations, provided blood and urine samples, and completed\nadditional questionnaires. The details of the participant exami-\nnations and laboratory assessments are available on the NHANES\nWeb site.49 For our study, only data from participants aged 12\nto 19 years were analyzed; individuals were excluded from analy-\nses if they were pregnant and/or used steroids, blood glucose\nregulators, insulin, other antidiabetic agents, growth hor-\nmones, or sex hormones.\nMEASUREMENTS\nOutcome variables included glucose levels, insulin levels, ho-\nmeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)\nmeasurements, total cholesterol levels, high-density lipopro-\ntein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, low-density lipoprotein cho-\nlesterol (LDL-C) levels, triglyceride (TG) levels, systolic blood\npressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference\n(WC), and body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in ki-\nlograms divided by height in meters squared) percentile for age\nand sex (per the National Center for Health Statistics\nreferences).50 The HOMA-IR ([fasting glucose in millimoles per\nliter  fasting insulin in milliunits per milliliter]/22.5),51 LDL-C,\nand TG results were limited to those who had completed at least\nan 8-hour fast. Mean WC is presented as the least squares mean,\ncontrolling for age and sex.\nDEFINITIONS\nSugar-sweetened beverage information was obtained through\n24-hour recall was assessed on 2 separate days; the first day\nwas an in-person interview comparable with the previous\nNHANES study periods' primary interview mode, whereas the\nsecond day was a telephone interview 3-10 days later. For con-\nsistency in the methodology of data collection among the study\nrecall was used in our analyses.) Sugar-sweetened beverages were\ndefined as caloric soft drinks, colas, sugar-sweetened fruit drinks,\nor other SSBs; pure fruit juices and diet soft drinks were not\nincluded. Sugar-sweetened beverage intake in grams for each\nreported beverage was divided by 250 g (a serving equivalent;\napproximately 8 ounces or a cup of beverage) and summed for\neach adolescent. In each NHANES analyzed, low SSB intake was\ndefined as the lowest quintile (20th percentile) of the sum\nof the number of SSB serving equivalents a subject consumed\nper day; medium was defined as the 2nd to 4th quintiles (20th\nto 80th percentile); high was defined as the highest quintile\n(80th percentile).

All of the analyses used the\nNHANES-provided sampling weights that were calculated to\ntake into account unequal probabilities of selection resulting\nfrom the sample design, nonresponse, and planned over-\nsampling of selected subgroups so the results are representa-\ntive of the US community-dwelling population. Dietary and ac-\ntivity variables were analyzed both as continuous variables and\nin quintiles to minimize the chance that a small number of ex-\ntreme observations would have undue influence on the re-\nsults. Descriptive statistics summarize the data and are ex-\npressed as the mean (standard error [SE]). Multivariate linear\nregression analyses were performed to determine indepen-\ndent associations between each outcome variable and the num-\nber of serving equivalents of SSBs consumed and/or the levels\nof PA after adjusting for age, sex, race, and energy intake (in\nkilocalories). Analyses involving female subjects were ad-\njusted for the occurrence or nonoccurrence of menarche. All\nP values are 2-sided and statistical significance was estab-\nlished a priori at =.05.\nRESULTS\nCHARACTERISTICS\nThe baseline characteristics of the study participants are\nshown in Table 1.

The low-SSB intake group\nconsumed a mean of 0.01 SSB serving equivalents (ap-\nproximately 0-3 oz]); the medium\u00adSSB intake group\nconsumed a mean of 2.5 SSB serving equivalents (approxi-\nmately 4-38 oz]), and the high\u00adSSB intake group con-\nsumedameanof7.4SSBservingequivalents(approximately\n40-266 oz]). Each additional SSB serving equivalent con-\nsumed per day was associated with a 5% increase in\ncreaseinWC,a0.90-percentileincreaseinBMIforage,and\na 0.48-mg/dL decrease in HDL-C concentrations.\nThe characteristics of the low-, medium-, and high-PA\nlevel groups as well as the results of the multivariate lin-\near regression analyses evaluating the relationship be-\ntween PA levels and insulin resistance-associated meta-\nbolic parameters and anthropometric measurements are\nshown in Table 3.

Each incremental increase in PA\nlevel per day was associated with a 0.03% decrease in\nHOMA-IR, a 0.004-mg/dL decrease in LDL-C concen-\ntrations, a 0.01-mg/dL decrease in TG concentrations, and\na 0.001-mg/dL increase in HDL-C concentrations.\nBecause the combination of dietary modification (with\ndecreased SSB intake) and exercise (with increased PA\nlevels) are typically recommended to children and ado-\nlescents either at risk for or currently diagnosed with obe-\nsity, insulin resistance, or metabolic syndrome, we evalu-\nated the factors associated with the combination of each\nextreme (ie, low SSB intake and high PA vs high SSB in-\ntake and low PA level); the characteristics of the 2 groups\nas well as the results of the multivariate linear regres-\nsion analyses evaluating the relationship between low SSB\nintake and high PA levels with insulin resistance\u00ad\nassociated metabolic parameters and anthropometric mea-\nsurements are shown in Table 4.

How-\never, in male adolescents, each additional SSB serving\nequivalent consumed per day was associated with a\nfor age, and a 0.35-mg/dL decrease in HDL-C concen-\ntration. Alternatively, each incremental increase in PA\nlevel in female adolescents was only associated with a 0.01-\nmg/dL decrease in TG concentrations, whereas each in-\ncremental increase in PA level in male adolescents was\nmg/dL decrease in LDL-C concentrations, a 0.01-mg/dL\ndecrease in TG concentrations, and a 0.001-cm de-\ncrease in WC. Furthermore, although the combination\nof low SSB intake and high PA levels in female adoles-\ncents revealed no significant associations with any insu-\nlin resistance\u00adassociated metabolic parameters or an-\nthropometric measurements, the combination of low SSB\nintake and high PA levels in male adolescents was sig-\nnificantly associated with increased HDL-C concentra-\ntions, a lower HOMA-IR, and lower TG concentrations.\nCOMMENT\nIn these nationally representative samples of US adoles-\ncents, we found significant differences between the de-\ngrees of SSB intake and PA levels with insulin resistance\u00ad\nassociated metabolic parameters and anthropometric\nmeasurements.\nMultivariate linear regression analyses showed that in-\ncreased SSB consumption was independently associated\nwith increased HOMA-IR, SBP, WC, and BMI percentile\nfor age and sex and decreased HDL-C concentrations; al-\nternatively, increased PA levels were independently as-\nsociated with decreased HOMA-IR, LDL-C concentra-\ntions, and TG concentrations and increased HDL-C\nconcentrations. Furthermore, low SSB intake and high\nPA levels appear to modify each others' effects on de-\ncreasing HOMA-IR and TG concentrations and increas-\ning HDL-C concentrations. These findings thus support\nthe promotion of each lifestyle parameter (ie, decreased\nSSB consumption and increased PA levels) in children\nor adolescents either at risk for or currently diagnosed\nwith obesity, insulin resistance, or metabolic syndrome.\nSubgroup analyses based on sex also showed that SSB\nintake and PA levels were independently associated with\ninsulin resistance\u00adassociated metabolic parameters and\nanthropometric differences; however, the associations of\nTable 4.

In female adolescents, increased\nSSB consumption was associated with an increase in\nHOMA-IR, TG concentrations, SBP, WC, and BMI per-\ncentile and a decrease in HDL-C concentrations. How-\never, in male adolescents, SSB consumption was only as-\nsociated with an increase in WC and BMI percentile and\na decrease in HDL-C concentrations. Alternatively, in-\ncreased PA levels in female adolescents were only asso-\nciated with a decrease in TG concentrations, whereas in-\ncreased PA levels in male adolescents were associated with\na decrease in HOMA-IR, LDL-C concentrations, TG con-\ncentrations, and WC. Furthermore, although the com-\nbination of low-SSB intake and high PA levels revealed\nno significant associations with any insulin resistance\u00ad\nassociated metabolic parameters or anthropometric mea-\nsurements in female adolescents, the combination of low\nSSB intake and high PA levels was significantly associ-\nated with a lower HOMA-IR, lower TG concentrations,\nand increased HDL-C concentrations, just as it was when\nthe cohort was studied in its entirety.\nThe sex-related differences that we observed with re-\nspect to the association of SSB intake and PA levels with\ninsulin resistance\u00adassociated metabolic parameters and\nanthropometric measurements are intriguing; however,\ngiven the many physiological differences that exist be-\ntween male and female adolescents during the adoles-\ncent years and our limited ability in female adolescents\nand inability in male adolescents to assess and control\nfor pubertal status, our results are not necessarily sur-\nprising. Furthermore, many other variables that we could\nnot account for during our analyses such as a subject's\ndietary behavior and precise body composition measure-\nments may have influenced our results.\nSugar-sweetened beverages may negatively affect he-\npatic metabolism and energy homeostasis,24 and the con-\nnot all27,28 studies as a contributing factor to the increased\nincidence and prevalence of overweight and obesity. The\nodds of a pediatric patient becoming obese--and there-\nfore at risk for developing metabolic syndrome--has been\nreported to increase byapproximately60% for each addi-\ntional SSB serving per day,12 and individuals who con-\nsume a large portion of their daily energy in the form of\nSSBs are reported to have increased body weight, in-\ncreased fat mass, dyslipidemia, and high blood pres-\nsure.29,30 Although discrepancy exists in the literature re-\ngarding the association of SSB intake with a subject's\nmetabolic status (which may in large part be because of\nthe many types of studies that have been performed [ie,\nprospective, cross-sectional, and retrospective--all with\ndifferent inclusion/exclusion criteria and means of data\nanalysis]), our study shows an independent relationship\nbetween increased SSB intake and increased HOMA-IR,\nSBP, WC, and BMI percentile for age and sex and de-\ncreased HDL-C concentrations, thus supporting the ben-\neficial relationship of limited SSB intake with insulin\nresistance\u00adassociated parameters.\nAlternatively, PA causes more of its metabolic-\nchanging effects by its action on skeletal muscle, and regu-\nlar exercise induces long-term changes within the skeletal\nAlthough there have been fewer epidemiological studies\nTable 5.

Moreover, a recent study in adolescents showed that\nmoderate PA was positively related to improved glucose\nmetabolism and resting energy expenditure.55 Our study\nfurther supports the metabolic and health benefits of ex-\nercise and shows an independent relationship between in-\ncreased PA levels and decreased HOMA-IR, LDL-C con-\ncentrations, and TG concentrations and increased HDL-C\nconcentrations.\nImportantly, the finding that the absolute values of the\n coefficients from our multivariate linear regression\nanalyses were consistently smaller for the PA analyses than\nfor the SSB analyses does not diminish the significance\nof exercise and its relationship with insulin resistance\u00ad\nassociated parameters; rather, it is a reflection of the meth-\nodology used. Sugar-sweetened beverage intake was de-\nfined as the number of SSB serving equivalents a subject\nconsumed per day, whereas PA levels were defined as (the\nmean number of times a subject did activity per day) \n(the average duration of each time in minutes)  (the\nmetabolic equivalent score). As would be expected from\nits determination from multiple variables, a much wider\nrange of PA levels were calculated in the study popula-\ntion than SSB intake levels, influencing the effect of a single\nunit of incremental change on the outcome. However,\nbased on our model, even a small increase in daily exer-\ncise by an individual (eg, increasing the mean number\nof times a subject engaged in PA from 2 to 3 per day and\nincreasing the average duration of physical activity from\n10 to 15 minutes) would have a profound effect on their\ncalculated PA level (increasing it by 225%), leading to\nlarger changes in the outcome variables than would be\nexpected by the small value of the  coefficient.\nGiventhatthebiologicaleffectsofSSBconsumptionand\nexercise are different, we were not surprised to find that\nthe combination of low SSB intake and high PA levels ap-\npeared to modify each others' effects on several insulin re-\nsistance\u00adassociated parameters. However, the fact that we\nonly observed this effect for HOMA-IR, HDL-C concen-\ntrations, and TG concentrations, but not the other out-\ncome variables, is interesting and requires further investi-\ngationwithwell-designedprospectivestudies.Nevertheless,\nHOMA-IR, HDL-C concentrations, and TG concentra-\ntions are commonly used in clinical practice as markers of\na subject's metabolic status, and thus our data suggest that\npromoting decreased SSB consumption and increased lev-\nels of exercise in adolescents is important for overall health.\nOur study has several significant limitations. First, be-\ncause our study is cross-sectional, all we are able to re-\nport are associations as opposed to causality. Second, be-\ncause the pubertal status of our subjects was not\ndocumented in the NHANES periods that we studied, we\nare unable to adjust our analyses for the subjects' degree\nof sexual maturation. Third, studies such as ours that use\nquestionnaire data have inherent limitations: (1) the re-\ncall method is subject to inaccuracy and bias, especially\nwith behaviors such as dietary habits56 and levels of ex-\nercise52; and (2) an individual's dietary habits and levels\nof exercise can vary greatly from one day to the next, lim-\niting the reliability of short-term recall on long-term pat-\nterns. However, given that overweight subjects often un-\nderreport their levels of energy intake56 and less active\nadolescents often overestimate their degree of physical\nfitness,52 we can have confidence in our results because\nthese biases would be expected to diminish rather than\nenhance our ability to find significant associations be-\ntween SSB consumption and PA levels with insulin re-\nsistance-associated measures.\nIn summary, we report that SSB intake and PA levels\nare each independently associated with insulin resistance\u00ad\nassociated metabolic parameters and anthropometric mea-\nsurements in adolescents; moreover, low SSB intake and\nhigh PA levels appear to modify each others' effect on\nseveral health-related outcome variables. Thus, al-\nthough prospective studies are needed to directly test the\neffects of dietary modification and consistent exercise on\nthe development of obesity, insulin resistance, and meta-\nbolic syndrome in the pediatric population, pediatri-\ncians should continue promoting these lifestyle modifi-\ncations in efforts to improve overall health.\nCorrespondence: Andrew A.
