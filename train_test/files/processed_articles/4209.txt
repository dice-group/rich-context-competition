Traditional\nresource extraction and development continue into the 21st\ncentury. We argue that increased knowledge and understanding\nof this heritage can contribute to an alternative vision for\nresource extraction and development in Nigeria (see Figure 1).\nNigerian metal- and clay-working traditions extend back in\ntime at least two and a half thousand years. For example, peo-\nple of the Nok culture created distinctive terra cotta figurines\nmore than 2,500 years ago and people at Igbo\u00adUkwu mined\ncopper alloys in the ninth century AD (B. Fagg, 1990; Shaw,\n1970), while the identification and exploitation of mineral\nresources such as tin ore on the Jos Plateau dates even earlier,\nery of bronze or brass objects in the Tada, Jebba, and Giragi\nareas. Neaher (1976) has identified at least three centers of\nmetal working in Igbo land--Awka in Anambra State, Eha\nAlumona in Nsukka, and Agulu Umana in Udi, Enugu State\nused bronze/brass and iron in their metal works. Still other\nstudies have shown extensive exploitation of hematite ores for\niron smelting in Nsukka areas such as Opi, Orba, Umundu,\nNrobo, Lejja, and Obimo. In addition, archaeologists search-\ning for the sources of the Igbo\u00adUkwu bronze have discovered\nearly exploitation of lead and zinc at Enyigba Abakaliki and\ncopper in the Benue trough (Chikwendu, Craddock, Farquar,\nThe legacy of ancient resource extraction continues in the\npresent day. The archaeology of stone tool manufacture at\nthe Ugwuele-Uturu Okigwe illustrates early and extensive\nexploitation of dolerite for the production of hand axes,\ncleavers, picks, and flake tools, whereas modern people con-\ntinue to quarry this outcrop for road construction gravel.\nSimilarly, people in Benin, Awka, Eha Alumona, Nsukka,\nAgulu Umana, and Udi continue to cast bronze and brass\nTraditionally, stone tool production has been associated\nwith hunter-gatherer and early agricultural societies.\nArchaeologists have long considered clay, and later metal\ntechnology, to coincide with the formation of agricultural\nsocieties with increased division of labor and intensified\nexchange of goods and services. More recently, social\narchaeologists have begun to highlight the roles that indi-\nvidual men and women played in shaping their material\nworlds through the use of such objects (Haaland, 1997).\nMineral objects of all kinds play a major role in the devel-\nopment of states and kingdoms in Nigeria and elsewhere.\nIn this article, we attempt to use archaeological and ethno-\ngraphic data to identify the source extraction methods for\nsome of these raw materials in the past, and to examine how\nfailure to manage such resources has adversely affected tech-\nnological and resource development in Nigeria. We begin\nwith a discussion of Nigeria's archaeological heritage of three\ntraditional resource types: stone, ceramic, and metal, espe-\ncially iron. We include ethnographic examples illustrating the\n1Department of Archaeology and Tourism, University of Nigeria, Nsukka,\nEnugu State, Nigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nEmeka E.

We conclude with a discussion of some possible ramifi-\ncations of Nigeria's production heritage on the course of its\ncurrent and future development (Figure 1).\nRaw Material Sources\nHumans have long made use of mineral resources--clay,\nmetal, and stone--to manufacture tools. Such resources\nformed the raw material for hunting, farming, and other utili-\ntarian implements, as well as symbolic objects imbued with\nsocial or ritual powers. Ultimately, the need for more effi-\ncient tools led to the exploitation of quality iron ores such as\nhematite for the production of iron implements.\nStone Tool Production\nStone artifacts have been produced in Nigeria since the\nFor instance, in the Nok valley, stone hand axes, cleavers,\nand picks were recovered from the sites of Mai-Idon Toro,\nPingell, and Nok. Also in the forest zone of south-eastern\nNigeria, a stone tool factory site was discovered in 1977 at\nUgwuele-Uturu Okigwe (Andah & Derefaka 1983; Anozie,\nChikwendu, & Umeji, 1978). However, the dating of\nAcheulian tools/sites in Nigeria has been trailed by contro-\nFurthermore, stone tools have continued to be used in\nmany parts of Nigeria (plate 1). For example, Ibeanu (2000)\nrecently observed the use of a stone anvil and hammer by\nUgwuogu blacksmiths in Uturu Okigwe. In addition,\nOkonkwo (2004) notes that in Sukur Kingdom, Adamawa\nState, 18th-century grinding stones, basins, and mortar hol-\nlows are still in use, thus demonstrating the persistence of the\ntechnical tradition (David & Sterner, 1989).\nSome materials, such as obsidian (not readily available)\nlend themselves more easily to tool production than quartz/\nquarzite, so Nigerian hunter-gatherers have long visited\nremote quarries to gather quality raw materials for stone tool\nFigure 1. Map of Nigeria showing the location of studied archaeological sites.\nOkonkwo and Ibeanu 3\nmaking (Hodges, 1964). Such lithic resources are later recov-\nered at archaeological sites outside the source areas. Stone\ntool technology, like all technologies, change over time.\nThese changes may be a response to environmental shifts. As\nin many other parts of the world, stone tools in Nigeria can\nbe divided into two broad categories: flake tools and ground\nor polished tools such as axes.\nFlake tools, such as scrapers with limited working edge\nwere mostly used for the processing of hides and fibers for\nuse by humans. And perhaps, with increased and more\neffective demand on resource exploitation, man opted for\nmore efficient and smoother cutting/digging tools--pol-\nished stone axes, which could be held with hand or hafted\non wood--thereby expanding the scope of man's subsis-\ntence base such as incipient farming activities. In Nigeria,\nmost traditional agricultural tools seem to have taken cue\nfrom stone tools. For instance, the iron knives, hoes, axes,\nand picks have longer and sharper cutting edges compared\nwith the hunter-gatherer's digging sticks weighted with\nbored stones.\nClay--Pottery Production\nThe earliest evidence of pottery production in Nigeria dates to\nthe fourth millennium BC in Rop Rockshelter (W. Fagg,\n1972). To date, ceramic objects remain important in the\neconomic and socio-cultural life of Nigerian peoples.\nArchaeologicalandethnographicstudiesalikeshowNigerians\nuse traditional pottery for cooking and storage; they also play\na prominent role in religious ceremonies and rituals.Avariety\nof pottery traditions exist within Nigeria, including terra cotta\ndiscovered at Nok, and \"potsherd pavements\" found at Nok,\nDaima, and Ife archaeological sites. Nrobo potters of Nsukka\narea manufactured clay smoking pipes.\nDespite the adverse impact of western colonialism on tra-\nditional art and craft, pottery has demonstrated some mea-\nsure of resilience and adaptation (Fowowe, 2004; Ibeanu,\nof pottery forms, such as ornamental wares, the demand for\nIlorin black pots (Kashim, 2004) is still on the increase for\nuse in socio-cultural practices in parts of Igbo land, such as\ntitle taking, traditional medicine, religious practices, and\nmarriage.\nIn parts of Igbo land, traditional pots not only serve utili-\ntarian functions but also ceremonial, ritual, and status sym-\nsuch as title taking, traditional medicine, marriages, and rit-\nual practices help in no small way to continue to sustain the\nproduction of traditional pottery wares in parts of Nigeria.\nThe Ilorin black pots were achieved as a result of the high\ntechnical skills of traditional potters.\nThe production process requires getting a bigger pot with\nperfectly round bottom as a mould. The mould is placed on the\nground at a balanced position and clay lumps are put together\ngradually around the pot taking proper cognizance of even\nAfter allowing the base to be a little bit hardened, the\nmolding process continues on till the desired shape and size\nis achieved (plate 2). \"Are\" (a sharp edged smooth pebble) is\nused to make spiral decorations on the inner parts of the pot.\nThe pottery wares are smoothened with coconut shells or\nleaves and fired in open fire. At a temperature of about 600\n\u00b0C to 850 \u00b0C, the pots are removed from fire and dipped in a\nheap of saw dust, which impacts carbonized effect on the\npots. Later, the hot pots are immersed in a big pot containing\nliquid extracted from tree barks and bean pods. The contact\nof the hot pottery wares with the black liquid produces a boil-\ning effect on the surface of the pots giving it a black shinning\neffect characteristic of Ilorin pots. This type of pot is still\nproduced and used in Ilorin irrespective of the influx of\nimported wares (plate 3 & 4).\nIron and Metal Production\nThe utilization of iron in the production of tools and orna-\nments seems to have occurred prior to or simultaneously with\nother metal ores in Nigeria. Artifacts of iron and other metals\nwere recovered from the same archaeological level for the first\ntime at Daima site; thus, the transition from stone use to iron\nwas documented in Daima dated between 5 AD and 6 AD\n(Connah, 1969). Unlike in northern Africa and Europe, which\nhad distinct Iron and Bronze Ages, the earliest evidence so far\nfor ore exploitation and smelting of iron and metal was dated\nwhereas the earliest date for bronze artifacts recovered in\nPlate 1. Sand polished stone tool.\n4 SAGE Open\nNigeria is from Igbo\u00adUkwu sites dating to the 9th century AD\nthese early sites were mined with simple tools or collected on\nthe surface from eroded ore bearing deposits found in different\nparts of Nigeria.\nCommon ores for smelting at archaeological and contem-\nporary ethnographic sites include hematite, limonite, magne-\ntite, and hardpan occurring in bogs. For example, Sassoon\n(1964) also observes that in Sukur Kingdom, magnetite is the\nlocal source of ore for smelting. In Nsukka and Okigwe\nareas, hematite ores were smelted in the past. Umeji (1985)\nhas observed that iron ores have traditionally been obtained\nalong the Nsukka\u00adOkigwe escarpment.\nThe type of ores for smelting depends on the availability\nand accessibility of the mineral resources in the environment\nwhere the iron smelters live and work. However, the relative\nease of acquisition/abundance of iron ores explains why iron\nobjects were more numerous than copper artifacts, and may\nalso explain why iron smelting seem to have predated the\nsmelting and production of copper artifacts in Nigeria.\nPlate 2. The potter is working on the body of the pot.\nPlate 3. The making of black pot of Ilorin.\nPlate 4. Finished products of Ilorin black pots.\nOkonkwo and Ibeanu 5\nFurnace/smelting.Smelting involves the reduction of iron/\ncopper oxides (ores) to iron/metals. This is achieved by heat-\ning the ores with charcoal in an enclosed earthen chamber\nknown as furnace. Three types of furnaces have been noted\nin parts of Nigeria: These include pit or bowl furnaces, dome\nfurnaces, and shaft furnaces (plate 5a-c).\nThe iron smelting tradition of Nigeria exemplifies the\nNigerian tradition of innovation; thus, the various types of\nsmelting furnaces observed in parts of Nigeria seem to sug-\ngest improvement overtime in smelting technique culminat-\ning with the slag-tapping shaft furnace at the time of colonial\nintervention. Besides, a lot of rituals are associated with the\niron workers/workshops and in some places iron workers\nheld very high social status in the society. In Ihube, Okigwe,\nOgadazu (a small earthen pot) that is located inside a black-\nsmith workshop is used to administer oath to people. It is a\ngeneral belief that the water in the Ogadazu ritual pot has the\npotency to cure some ailments such as skin disease and swol-\nlen leg (Ibeanu & Okpoko, 1994). Another important point is\nthe bellows used in iron working, from fire to animal skin\ncovered bellows to rubber and now motorized bellows as\nobserved in some blacksmiths' workshops. Also, pottery\nwares must have played significant roles in iron working\ngiven the quantity of potsherds in smelting sites.\nThe pit furnace is made up of a simple, clay-lined pit, two\nor more feet deep, and is the oldest furnace type noted in\nNsukka and Abakaliki as well as in Taruga-Nok (Anozie,\nment on the earlier type because it has a superstructure with\na small opening on top for recharging allowing faster attain-\nment of higher temperature. Dome and pit furnaces alike\nemploy bellows to raise the temperature, and both produce\nvery heavy slag in Nsukka and Abakaliki areas, thereby indi-\ncating perhaps their low efficiency in iron extraction. Both\nrequire that slag be cooled with the iron bloom and then bro-\nken away and deposited on site, a process that leaves a dis-\ntinctive archaeological signature. In the Yoruba village of\nOla-Igbi, a dome furnace continued to be used into the late\nThe 5- to 6-feet-tall chimney-shaped shaft furnace is the\nmost type of traditional furnace. Shaft furnaces feature a\nslag-tapping devise, which draws the melted slag in the fur-\nnace into a slag pit, and thus, creates an archaeological signa-\nture different from the other two.\nShaft furnaces continue to be employed in parts of Benue\nand by the Berom people, as well as those of Sukur Kingdom.\nThey stand as an example of cultural resilience when smelt-\ning has gone into extinction in other parts of Nigeria. In\nNigerian antiquity, smelted iron was either hammered or cast\nto produce tools and other objects. Casting techniques\ninclude the use of open molds, piece molds (for solid cast-\ning), cire perdue (lost wax), and false core (hollow casting).\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nWe have tried foreground early successful attempts by\nNigerians of different ethnic groups to harness the mineral\nresources available to them. In so doing, they added value to\nPlate 5. Iron smelting furnaces--(a) pit, (b) dome, and (c) shaft.\nSource.

The traditional skills and indigenous\nknowledge of Nigeria's ethnic groups have been callously\nleft to fossilize in the archaeological record, and are ignored\nin current attempts at economic planning. The Nigerian\nnation today is bereft of her past \"golden Age\" so long as our\nancient heritage of resource extraction and production does\nnot inform the present and future development of the coun-\ntry. For example, to what extent have we integrated our\nindigenous knowledge from different local industries to form\nthe bedrock of our industrial development strategies?\nIt is not always correct to blame our development set-\nbacks on western colonialism, especially if we are unable to\nappreciate our own past technological breakthroughs. For\nexample, the analysis of the pig iron from the traditional\nsmelting furnace at Ola-Igbi village in Yoruba showed that\nthe iron produced there was actually steel iron with a very\nlow carbon content of 1.6%, and the blacksmiths of the area\nwere able to further refine the metal to reduce the carbon\ncontents to 1%. The smiths considered this locally produced\nsteel to be much stronger and more durable than the European\nimported iron. But by the time of W. Fagg's (1952) visit, they\nwere using imported iron, even though they considered it an\nAlso, ethnographic studies inAgulu Umana in Udi, Enugu\nState, observed people's creative skills in both iron smelting,\nblacksmithing, and casting. As a result, their blacksmiths\nwere engaged by the colonial master in the iron foundry that\nproduced the railway sleepers. Craddock and Picton (1986)\nnoted the addition of lead to the Igbo\u00adUkwu copper alloys,\nwhich made possible the complex casting of the Igbo\u00adUkwu\nbronze artifacts. This mastery of the technical properties of\ncopper alloys by the Igbo\u00adUkwu traditional metallurgists has\nnot been seen anywhere else in the world.\nNo doubt, the European intervention adversely affected\nthe continued development of traditional skills in mineral\nexploitations and other spheres of traditional technology in\npart by bringing techniques that would add more economic\nvalue to their investments returns. Successive Nigerian gov-\nernments have since failed to take advantage of the abundant\nlocal skills for industrial development such as the colonial\nmasters. For example, the local blacksmiths and other crafts-\nmen were extensively used by the European colonialists in\nthe iron foundry for the Nigeria railway sleepers as well as in\nthe equipment and engine maintenance workshop at Ebute\nMetta. It is the policy somersaults of Nigerian government,\nwhich nipped such initiatives in the bud, that have since\nallowed the technological development to stagnate. Thus,\nNigeria regrettably has remained a consumer rather than a\nhybridization of technologies.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAllsworth-Jones, P.
