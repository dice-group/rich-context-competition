    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: U.S. population studies show herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) seroprevalence levelling by\napproximately age 30, suggesting few new infections after that age. It is unclear whether this pattern is driven by\ngreater percentages in stable relationships, and to what extent adults who initiate new relationships may be at risk\nof incident HSV-2 infection.\nMethods: Survey and laboratory data from the 1999-2008 waves of the U.S. National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES) were combined for 12,862 adults age 20-49. Weighted population estimates of self-\nreported genital herpes, HSV-2 seroprevalence, and past-year sexual history were calculated, stratified by age, sex,\nrace, and relationship status. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess whether relationship status\nprovided additional information in predicting HSV-2 over age, race and sex, and whether any such associations\ncould be accounted for through differences in lifetime number of sex partners.\nResults: Those who were unpartnered had higher HSV-2 prevalence than those who were married/cohabitating.\nAmong unpartnered 45-49 year olds, seroprevalence was 55.3% in women and 25.7% in men. Those who were\nmarried/cohabitating were more likely to have had a past-year sex partner, and less likely to have had two or more\npartners. The effect of age in increasing the odds of HSV-2 was modified by race, with higher HSV-2 prevalence\namong Black Americans established by age 20-24 years, and the effect of race decreasing from age 30 to 49.\nRelationship status remained an independent predictor of HSV-2 when controlling for age, race, and sex among\nthose age 30 to 49; married/cohabitating status was protective for HSV-2 in this group (OR = 0.69)\nConclusions: Whereas sexually transmitted infections are often perceived as issues for young adults and specific\nhigh-risk groups, the chronic nature of HSV-2 results in accumulation of prevalence with age, especially among\nthose not in married/cohabitating relationships. Increased odds of HSV-2 with age did not correspond with\nincreases in self-reported genital herpes, which remained low. Adults who initiate new relationships should be\naware of HSV-2 in order to better recognize its symptoms and prevent transmission.\nBackground\nWhile most research on sexually transmitted infections\n(STIs) has focused on adolescents, young adults, and\nestablished high risk groups, adults outside of these\ngroups are not free of risk for STIs. The association\nbetween age and STI prevalence varies not only by\npopulation, but by type of infection. As prevalence is a\nfunction of both incidence rate and duration of\ninfection, prevalence of chronic viral infections such as\ngenital herpes is cumulative and increases with age,[1-6]\nthus possessing special relevance for those beyond the\n\"young adult\" years.\nGenital herpes results from infection with herpes sim-\nplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), or less commonly type 1\n(HSV-1). Since HSV-1 is responsible for most oral out-\nbreaks or \"cold sores\" and represents a minority of geni-\ntal infections, HSV-2 is used in seroprevalence studies\nas a marker of burden of infection with genital herpes.\nIn the U.S., HSV-2 seroprevalence increased 30% from\n* Correspondence: greta.bauer@schulich.uwo.ca\nEpidemiology & Biostatistics, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, The\nUniversity of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada\n\u00a9 2010 Bauer et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

In\nthe U.S., HSV-2 prevalence increased until approxi-\nmately age 30, and then stabilized[1]. In Australia, pre-\nvalence similarly peaked at midlife and then plateaued\n[5]. In Ontario, Canada, HSV-2 prevalence did not stabi-\nlize but rather continued to increase through the oldest\ngroup studied - 40 to 44 years - a pattern suggesting\nadditional new infections among middle-aged adults, [2]\nand in Puerto Rico prevalence stabilized after age 40[6].\nCountries such as Costa Rica and Switzerland have\nobserved the highest prevalences among the most\nelderly,[3,4] though findings of highest prevalence in\nelderly men in Switzerland were believed to represent a\nWorld War II cohort effect[4]. Age trends observed in\ncross-sectional studies may be due to cohort effects, dif-\nferent rates of infection in different generations. How-\never, it is likely that an increase in prevalence with age\nalso represents new infections occurring at older ages.\nSlower rates of acquisition of new infections in older\nadults vs. young adults as a whole are at least in part\ndue to the increase in stable long-term relationships\nwith age. By age 30, approximately 60% of U.S. adults\nare married, and this proportion remains relatively\never, stable population proportions for marriage do not\nnecessarily correspond to stable marriages among indivi-\nduals. Changes in relationship and family structure have\nresulted in increasing proportions of adults finding\nthemselves outside of long-term monogamous relation-\nships, at least for periods of time. The divorce rate in\nthe United States rose sharply until 1981 and has\nrecently levelled off[9]. The marriage rate also decreased\nover the past 25 years, and is now at its lowest point in\nrecorded history, representing new ways to envision\nrelationships[9]. Cohabitation between unmarried part-\nthe life course, relationship changes due to divorce,\nseparation or death lead to new patterns of casual dat-\ning, short-term serial monogamy, new long-term rela-\ntionships, or remarriage.\nWhile overall HSV-2 prevalence in adults is high, we\nhypothesize it may be even higher in the pool of people\nfrom which new partners are typically drawn: those who\nare not married or currently cohabitating with a partner.\nThus, for middle-aged and older adults, the probability\nof a new partner being infected with a chronic infection\nsuch as HSV-2 may be higher than for other groups,\ndespite a lower risk of curable STIs, which are of shorter\nduration and thus at lower prevalence. Models for\ntransmission of STIs frequently incorporate individual\nbehavioural factors, such as rate of partner change and\nconcurrent partnerships. However, prevalence of infec-\ntion in the prospective partner pool alone can result in\nwidely different outcomes for STI incidence. For exam-\nple, it has been demonstrated that men who have sex\nwith other men (MSM) would have to be much safer\nthan heterosexuals in order to stem the HIV epidemic\nand that heterosexuals would conversely have to behave\nin much riskier ways than MSM to produce a sustained\nepidemic[11]. Likewise, African-American youth have\nbeen demonstrated to be at high risk for STIs, even\nwhen engaging in \"low-risk\" sexual and drug behaviours\n[12]. In both of these cases, similar behaviours are\nbelieved to result in very different risks of infection pri-\nmarily due to the different probabilities of coming into\ncontact with an infected partner. In general, HSV-2 ser-\nopositivity varies by age, race and sex in the U.S. popu-\namong unpartnered adults, the group from which new\nsex partners would most likely be chosen, is unknown;\nexploring this is one aim of the current analysis. The\npresent study seeks to further explore whether relation-\nship status provides any valuable additional information\nbeyond these three factors in predicting HSV-2.\nMethods\nData\nData were obtained from the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). NHANES is\na continuous sample survey that uses a complex, multi-\nstage, stratified geographic area probability sampling\ndesign for collecting nationally representative data from\nthe non-institutionalized U.S. population[15]. Cross-sec-\ntional data were collected in two-year waves, and data\nfor this analysis in order to produce large sample sizes\nfor analysis.\nDemographic information, including age, sex, race/\nethnicity, and relationship status, was obtained through\nin-home interviews in English or Spanish. More sensi-\ntive survey items such as self-reported genital herpes\nand sexual history were assessed at a local Mobile\nExamination Center (MEC) using audio computer-\nassisted self-interview, wherein participants listened to\nquestions on headphones and input their responses\ndirectly into a computer in a private room, without\ninterviewer observation. This method has been shown to\nresult in higher reporting of sensitive behaviours[16,17].\nLaboratory specimens for HSV-2 testing were obtained\nat the MEC. Sera from respondents aged 14-49 years\nwere tested for antibody to HSV-2 infection and test\nresults for those over age 18 were released. Sexual beha-\nviour and infection questionnaire data were obtained for\nparticipants 18-59 years; however, only data from those\n20 to 59 years of age were released. Our analyses were\nthus limited to MEC participants aged 20-49 years. Of\nMEC exam.\nMeasures\nRelationship status was assessed using the following\ncategories: never married, married, living with a partner,\ndivorced, and widowed. For this analysis, those who\nwere never married, divorced or widowed were grouped\ntogether as \"unmarried\" to represent the population\nmost likely to be available for or initiating new sexual\nrelationships. Those who were married or cohabitating\nwith a partner were classified as \"married/cohabitating\"\nto represent those unlikely to be initiating new sexual\nrelationships. Race/ethnicity was measured as Mexican\nAmerican, other Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic Black, and other (including multiracial). For\nour analyses, Mexican Americans and other Hispanics\nwere jointly categorized as Hispanic. In the course of\nour analysis, and consistent with published literature, we\nfound differences in HSV-2 seropositivity and in the\nunadjusted rate of increase of prevalence with age\nbetween Black respondents and either Hispanic or\nWhite respondents. As no differences were found\nbetween White, Hispanic and \"Other\" groups, these\nwere grouped together in analysis for simplicity of pre-\nsentation and to increase power to examine interactions\nin regression models.\nMeasures of sexual activity included having any sex in\nthe past year, and having two or more sex partners in\nthe past year. Sex was defined as vaginal, anal or oral\nsex with a male or female partner. Lifetime number of\nsex partners was calculated by summing the total num-\nber of male partners and female partners.\nTwo measures of genital herpes were used for our\nanalyses. First, self-reported genital herpes was assessed\nwith the following questionnaire item: \"Has a doctor or\nother health care professional ever told you that you\nhad genital herpes?\" Second, laboratory assessment of\nHSV-2 was conducted in serum samples using a solid-\nphase enzymatic immunodot assay to detect antibodies\nreactive to gG-2, a purified glycoprotein specific to\nHSV-2; positive immunodot assays were confirmed\nusing a gG-2 monoclonal antibody inhibition assay[18].\ncycles, and in the previous NHANES III[18].\nAnalysis\nAll statistical analyses were conducted with SAS version\nprocedures designed to deal with complex survey data.\nPrevalence estimates were derived using 10-year weights\nspecific to the MEC sample, to represent the U.S. civi-\nlian, non-institutionalized population of adults aged\n20-49 years, and to account for oversampling and\nnonresponse to the interview and medical examinations.\nPrimary sampling unit, stratum and individual weights\nwere used to produce weighted point estimates, and var-\niances were calculated using Taylor series linearization.\nFrequencies for being unmarried were calculated by\nage in five-year intervals. All analyses were stratified\naccording to age, sex and race. Age-, sex-, race- and\nrelationship status-specific prevalences for HSV-2 sero-\npositivity and self-reported genital herpes were calcu-\nlated, along with corresponding 95% confidence\nintervals. A similar domain analysis was conducted for\nsexual activity variables.\nMultivariable unconditional logistic regression was\nused to elucidate the strength and combination of\neffects on HSV-2 seropositivity as follows. A model was\nfit incorporating age, sex, race, and any interactions\nbetween these variables that were statistically significant\n(p < 0.05 for Wald chi-square test). Where any interac-\ntion was significant, lower-order terms were retained in\nthe model regardless of level of statistical significance.\nRelationship status was then added to the model, to test\nwhether it contributed anything to predicting HSV-2\nseropositivity beyond age, race and sex. Interactions\nbetween relationship status and age, race and sex were\ntested, and interaction terms retained where statistically\nsignificant or where marginally significant if effect size\nwas large. Finally, to test whether any association\nbetween relationship status and HSV-2 seropositivity\nmay be explained by differences in lifetime number of\nsex partners, this variable was entered into the model.\nLifetime sex partner number was coded into five\nordered categories, to allow for a non-linear association\nbetween sex partner number and log odds of HSV-2.\nGiven that previous analysis of U.S. data had shown\nHSV-2 seroprevalence to level off at approximately age\n30,[1] and since our primary variable of interest, rela-\ntionship status, exhibited an interaction with age, we\nconducted a sensitivity analysis to see whether regres-\nsion results were heavily influenced by the youngest\nadults in our analysis, those aged 20-29 years. A second\nlogistic regression model was built according to the pro-\ncess above, but limited to participants aged 30-49 years.\nAs this model differed from that containing the full\nsample, separate regression models were presented for\nResults\nThe percentage of Americans who were unpartnered\ndecreased markedly with increasing age. At age 20-24,\nand were not cohabitating with a partner. This propor-\ntion decreased sharply through age 29, and by age\nunpartnered.

Overall HSV-2 seroprevalence was 13.6%\nSimilarly to women, the prevalence of self-reported gen-\nital herpes was much lower than HSV-2 seroprevalence,\ngenital herpes.\nAge-, race-, sex-, and relationship status-specific preva-\nlences for HSV-2 and self-reported genital herpes are illu-\nstrated in Figure 1. Specific prevalences and corresponding\n95% confidence intervals are reported in Table 1 for HSV-\n2 and Table 2 for self-reported genital herpes. Self-\nreported prevalences of genital herpes remained low\nacross all ages, regardless of race, sex, or relationship sta-\ntus. At age 45-49, estimates of self-reported genital herpes\nranged from 2.2% among married/cohabitating white/His-\npanic/other men to 8.2% among married Black women.\nHowever, the seroprevalence of HSV-2 increased with age,\nparticularly among unpartnered women, resulting in\nincreasing discrepancies between self-reported genital\nherpes and HSV-2 seropositivity with age. At age 45-49\nyears, estimated HSV-2 seroprevalences for women were:\nBlacks, 25.5% among married white/Hispanic/others,\n49.9% among unmarried white/Hispanic/others. The cor-\nterns for HSV-2 appeared similar across race groups,\nBlack American men and women had substantially higher\nHSV-2 prevalence than those of white, Hispanic or other\nracial groups at age 20-24, resulting in higher prevalences\nacross ages. Disparities in early HSV-2 seroprevalence\nwere especially marked for Black women, with a preva-\nwomen.\nWeighted frequencies and corresponding 95% confi-\ndence intervals for sexual history variables are presented\nin Table 3. Across all groups, married/cohabitating indi-\nviduals were more likely to have had sex in the past\nyear than those who were unpartnered, and unpartnered\nFigure 1 Prevalence of herpes simplex virus type 2 seropositivity and self-reported genital herpes by age, race, and relationship\nindividuals were more likely to have had two or more\nsex partners.\nResults from multiple logistic regression models pre-\ndicting HSV-2 seropositivity among that age 20-29 and\nbeing married or cohabitating was not associated with\nHSV-2 seropositivity, controlling for age, race, sex, and\nlifetime sex partner number. In contrast, among 30-49\nyear olds, those who were married or cohabitating had a\nstatistically significant decreased odds of HSV-2 (OR =\nassociation between relationship status and HSV-2 was\nTable 1 Seroprevalences of herpes simplex virus type 2 among U.S. women and men, by age, relationship status and\nrace\nHerpes simplex type 2 seropositivity, % (95% CI)\nBlack White, Hispanic or Other\nMarried or cohabitating\nUnpartnered\nTotal\nMarried or cohabitating\nUnpartnered\nTotal\nWomen (n)\nAge, y\nMen (n)\nAge, y\nTable 2 Prevalences of self-reported genital herpes among U.S. women and men, by age, relationship status and race\nSelf-reported genital herpes, % (95% CI)\nBlack White, Hispanic or Other\nMarried or cohabitating\nUnpartnered\nTotal\nMarried or cohabitating\nUnpartnered\nTotal\nWomen (n)\nAge, y\nMen (n)\nAge, y\nnot explained by the total number of lifetime sex part-\nners. In both models, increasing age, Black race, and\nfemale sex were associated with increased odds of HSV-\n2 seroprevalence, controlling for lifetime sex partner\nnumber and relationship status, where statistically signif-\nicant. However, among those age 30 to 49, age was asso-\nciated with increased seroprevalence of HSV-2 in White,\nHispanic and other-raced people, but not in Blacks, as\nthe relative impact of Black race decreased with increas-\ning age, corresponding to odds ratios of 6.05 at age 30,\nDiscussion\nUsing interview and laboratory data from a large strati-\nfied probability sample of the U.S. population, this study\ndemonstrates high HSV-2 seroprevalence among adults\nin general, and disparities in infection prevalences\naccording to race and relationship status. Relationship\nstatus was found to be an independent predictor of\nHSV-2 seroprevalence among adults age 30 to 49, even\nwhen lifetime number of partners was taken into\naccount, though relationship status no longer had a sig-\nnificant effect at ages 20 to 29 once partner number was\nincluded in the model. Our findings indicate that rela-\ntionship status provides a moderate amount of addi-\ntional information about the risk of having contracted\nHSV-2 among U.S. adults. Past the age of 30, the group\nfrom which sex partners are most often drawn - those\nnot married or living with a partner - has higher odds\nof HSV-2 seropositivity than their married/cohabitating\npeers, controlling for demographic factors and partner\nnumber. As such, the impact of partnering status should\nbe considered in future studies of HSV-2 seroprevalence.\nDespite strengths related to the size and probability-\nbased nature of our data set, these analyses have several\ndata-related limitations. To achieve a large sample size,\nwe pooled data collected over a ten-year period. Thus,\nour analysis assumes that results would be consistent\nTable 3 Prevalences of past-year sexual activity and partner number among U.S. women and men, by age,\nrelationship status and race\nAny sexa partner in the past year, % (95% CI) 2 or more sexa partners in the past year, % (95% CI)\nBlack White, Hispanic or Other Black White, Hispanic or Other\nMarried or\ncohabitating\nUnpartnered\nMarried or\ncohabitating\nUnpartnered\nMarried or\ncohabitating\nUnpartnered\nMarried or\ncohabitating\nUnpartnered\nWomen\nAge, y\nMen\nAge, y\naSex is defined as oral, vaginal or anal sex with a male or female partner.\nover this time period. As our estimates combined mar-\nried and cohabitating individuals, proportions with two\nor more sex partners in the past year are higher in our\nanalysis than in U.S. estimates that included only mar-\nried individuals, which estimate that 4.5% of married\nmen and 3.8% of married women have had multiple\npast-year sex partners[20]. While those who were married\nor cohabitating were on average less likely to be infected\nwith HSV-2, we were unable to separate out those who\nwere monogamous from those who were overtly or cov-\nertly non-monogamous. The measure for multiple part-\nnerships covers a one-year period; thus it represents a\ncombination of concurrent partnerships within marriage\nor cohabitation, either due to open relationships or infi-\ndelity; concurrency before marriage or cohabitation; and\nserial partnerships with a partner change during the past\nyear. We caution against the assumption of lower risk for\na partner who is married or cohabitating, as it is likely\nthat the non-monogamous subgroup does not share the\nsame risk profile and HSV-2 prevalence of the monoga-\nmous subgroup. Estimated frequencies for having multi-\nple past-year partners were higher for those who were\nunpartnered than for those who were married or\ncohabitating. The proportion of unpartnered women indi-\ncating multiple past-year partners decreased with age,\nsimilar to findings from the 2002 National Survey of\nFamily Growth[21]. Among men, that decrease was lim-\nited to the white/Hispanic/other group.\nHSV-2 seroprevalence and sexual behaviour data were\ncollected only for those up to age 49 and 59, respec-\ntively. Fleming et al. showed consistent and stabilized\nHSV-2 seroprevalence among U.S. adults over age 30\nusing earlier NHANES III data that did not have this\nage restriction[1]. Given the heterogeneity within this\ngroup, inclusion of laboratory tests for HSV-2 among\nadults over age 49 would have allowed for expansion of\nthe current analysis into older age ranges. While mis-\nconceptions and stereotypes persist, most single indivi-\nduals desire to date and continue to be sexually active\nson and 32% dating more than one person during the\nsame time period[23]. With an aging baby boomer\npopulation, and the cultural shift brought on by the sex-\nabout middle-aged and older adult sexuality are\nParameter\nEstimate (b)\nStandard\nError\na Coded 1 = female, 0 = male\nb Coded 1 = Black, 0 = White, Hispanic or other\nc Coded 1 = married/cohabitating, 0 = other\nd An interaction between age and race resulted in varying ORs. For age, OR = 1.05 per year of age for white, Hispanic and others and OR = 1.01 per year of age\nbecoming more common. Additionally, new treatments\nfor erectile dysfunction - estimated to affect 20% of\nolder males [24] - have prolonged sexual functioning.\nWith this, the U.S. has seen a roughly 87% increase in\nprescriptions for erectile dysfunction medications from\nthe popularity of the internet has also allowed older\nadults to express, experiment and challenge popular\nnotions of asexuality and sexual disinterest[26]. Thus,\ngiven trends observed up to age 49, and the knowledge\nthat adults over 50 remain sexually active, it is likely\nthat genital herpes is a concern for this group as well.\nOur analysis found overall HSV-2 rates to stabilize\nwith age, consistent with results from recent analyses of\nof NHANES II and NHANES III data[1]. Prevalences\nwere higher among women than men in our analysis,\nand among Black Americans than other races, similar to\nincrease in HSV-2 with age was not significantly differ-\nent for Blacks than for other racial groups across the\n20-29 year age range, and in fact increased at a slower\nrate over ages 30-49. This indicates that disparities in\nHSV-2 infection between Black Americans and other\nracial groups in the U.S. are driven primarily by high\nrates of HSV-2 acquisition at younger ages. By age\nand men in our analysis, respectively.\nExplanations for disparities in HSV-2 between Black\nand other Americans have been varied. While inequal-\nities in access to STI treatment may account for dispari-\nties in bacterial STIs, they are less likely to account for\ndifferences in viral STIs such as HSV-2[27]. Individual\nbehavioural and socioeconomic factors likely account\nfor some of the disparity, though these have limited\nexplanatory power, especially among low-risk Black\nAmericans. The relative effect of non-Hispanic Black\nrace/ethnicity has been shown to be strongest among a\nlow-risk group,[12,13] an effect that was not reduced or\neliminated by adjustment for socio-economic factors\n[13]. Even among those having only one lifetime sex\npartner, age-adjusted HSV-2 prevalence among Black\nmen and women has been shown to be 4.4 times that of\nwhites[1]. Differences in sexual network composition\ncan produce different STI risks at the same behavioural\nrisk levels, and such network composition differences\nfor Black Americans include greater network density,\nhigher rates of concurrent partnerships, and higher rates\nof mixing between core (i.e. high risk) groups and\nothers[28]. These network patterns may be driven by\nsocial context, including racial segregation, low sex\nratios of men to women, the effects of the crack cocaine\nepidemic of the 1980s, and high incarceration rates\namong Black U.S. men[28,29]. In our analysis, approxi-\nmately twice as many Black men as women reported\nhaving two or more past-year sex partners, even among\nthose who were married or cohabitating. It has been\nsuggested that for Black Americans, characteristics of\nthe partner pool (i.e. mixing) may be more important\nthan the characteristics of the individual partnership[30].\nThere is a dearth of information regarding specific\nsexual behaviours and protective behaviours in middle-\naged adults. Much of the literature focuses on young\nadults and adolescents, though a small but growing\nbody of literature is developing on older adults. Data\nfrom the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse\nrevealed that, among U.S. men and women aged\n35 years or older who had sex in the last year, 12.1%\nused a condom at last sex[31]. Research on virginity\nusing National Survey of Family Growth data indicated\nthat almost 16% of men and almost 13% of women age\n40-45 had never engaged in penile-vaginal intercourse,\n[32] though many of these would have engaged in other\nforms of sexual activity. Of single U.S. adults age 40-69,\n22% reported having sexual intercourse consistently\nonce a week or more and another 37% reported having\nhad sexual intercourse within the past six months[23]. It\nis unknown how many engaged in non-intercourse sex-\nual behaviours that could result in herpes transmission.\nHerpes may be transmitted through a wide variety of\nbehaviours, as viral shedding may occur not only geni-\ntally but also orally and on the thighs and buttocks, and\ntransmission commonly occurs during asymptomatic as\nwell as symptomatic periods[33].\nA substantial difference between HSV-2 seropositivity\nand self-reported prevalence was apparent in our analy-\nsis, with self-reported genital herpes prevalences remain-\ning low for all groups. Since it is unlikely that this\ndiscrepancy is driven by a greater proportion of asymp-\ntomatic cases among older, Black and/or unpartnered U.\nS. residents, it may represent either a greater proportion\nof undiagnosed cases, a higher reluctance to self-report\namong members of these groups, or a lack of access to\nhealth care for certain groups. It may also represent a\nlack of recognition of any symptoms as herpetic, as seen\nin earlier studies[34]. For all groups, only a minority of\nthose with HSV-2 acknowledged genital herpes infec-\ntion, and most infected individuals were unaware of\ntheir status.\nUnfortunately, because middle-age and older adults\nfall outside of an already-identified \"high risk group\" for\nSTIs - most of which were developed around modes of\ntransmission for HIV - individuals who are actually \"at\nrisk\" fall through the cracks of targeting strategies for\neducation, diagnosis, and prevention. Once past adoles-\ncence and young adulthood, adults are not often consid-\nered as being at significant risk for STIs, and physicians\ndo not do as thorough a work up in older patients as\nthey would younger ones[35]. Patients themselves do\nnot often bring up such issues as they are also unlikely\nto perceive themselves at risk of STIs, even where their\nbehaviour indicates otherwise[36,37]. Moreover, an\nHIV-centric focus on penile-vaginal intercourse and\nanal intercourse as risky behaviours due to fluid\nexchange can obscure assessment of risk for other STIs\nwhere risks associated with sexual practices differ from\nHIV. A broad repertoire of sexual or sensual acts that\ndo not include penile-vaginal or anal intercourse may\nstill produce risk of transmitting HSV-2.\nWhile HSV-2 does not have the broad effects on mor-\ntality and morbidity that HIV does, genital herpes can\nlead to adverse psychological and social effects as well\nas physical symptoms, and should be taken seriously.\nPhysically, herpes can be mild or can cause repeated\npainful sores that negatively affect daily life activities. It\ncan also increase the risk of subsequent HIV infection.\nFor childbearing women herpes infection can impact\ndelivery, requiring interventions such as caesarean sec-\ntion to avoid neonatal infection. A diagnosis with genital\nherpes may also cause psychosocial and psychological\ndistress,[38] including feelings of betrayal, contami-\nnation, loss of self-esteem and shame,[39] though the\ndistress experienced may be short-term[40,41]. Interper-\nsonal relationships may be damaged, with the stigma of\nherpes diagnosis causing difficulty in disclosing status to\npotential sex partners or in seeking care[41]. A lack of\nunderstanding of asymptomatic disease can damage\nexisting relationships as blame for a newly diagnosed\ninfection is based on errant assumptions[39]. Moreover,\nin a recent meta-analysis of general population cohort\nstudies, it was found that in areas where HSV-2 is highly\nprevalent, infection was associated with a tripling in the\nodds of acquiring HIV[42]. Despite these potentially\nnegative consequences, concerns about psychosocial\nburden should not prevent testing for HSV-2 in clinical\nThis analysis forces us to recognize that a high pro-\nportion of adults are seropositive for HSV-2, even a\nmajority in some groups. Given the commonality of this\nSTI, and concern that prevalence may be even higher\namong some groups of older adults not included in this\nstudy, it may be time to increase our ability to discuss\ninfection and decrease stigma around genital herpes.\nThe identification of non-young adults as a group that\nis at legitimate risk of HSV-2 could enhance under-\nstanding that different STIs have differing epidemiologic\nprofiles. Increased diagnostic suspicion regarding lesions\ncould also lead to increased diagnosis of HSV-2, and\ngreater avoidance of sexual contact during symptomatic\nperiods.\nConclusion\nWhereas sexually transmitted infections are often perceived\nas issues for young adults and specific high-risk groups, the\nchronic, viral nature of HSV-2 results in accumulation of\nprevalence with age, especially among those not in married/\ncohabitating relationships. The disproportionate burden of\nHSV-2 among Black Americans appear to be due to early\nincidence by age 20-24, rather than to a more rapid increase\nacross the 20-49 age range of this study. Increased odds of\nHSV-2 with age did not correspond with increases in self-\nreported genital herpes, which remained low. Adults who\ninitiate new relationships thus have a substantial probability\nof either coming into contact with a new partner who is\nHSV-2 infected, or of having unrecognized HSV-2 infec-\ntions themselves.
