We examined whether obesity's association with novel cardiovascular risk\nfactors such as C-reactive protein (CRP) also varies by race and ethnicity.\nMethods and Procedures: We analyzed data from 10,492 white, African-American, and Hispanic-American\nparticipants of the 1999\u00ad2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, who were aged 20 years and\nolder, with a BMI 18.5kg/m2 and CRP 10mg/l. We fit sex-specific multivariable models of the association of\nBMI or waist circumference with log CRP levels and tested for interactions of BMI or waist circumference with\nrace/ethnicity.\nResults: Higher BMI was significantly associated with higher CRP in all racial/ethnic groups for both men and\nwomen (P > 0.05 for BMI\u00adrace/ethnicity interaction) before and after adjustment for age, education, and health\nbehaviors. Larger waist circumference was also associated with higher CRP levels in all racial/ethnic groups\nbefore and after adjustment; among women, the relationship was strongest for Mexican Hispanics (P < 0.01 for\nwaist circumference\u00adrace/ethnicity interaction). Results were similar after additional adjustment for medications\nthat might affect CRP levels.\nDiscussion: The association between obesity and CRP is at least as strong in African Americans and Hispanic\nAmericans as in white Americans. Racial differences in the relationship between obesity and cardiovascular\nmortality are unlikely to be due to racial differences in obesity's impact on CRP.\nIntroduction\nObesity is a leading cause of preventable death and a major\ncontributor to cardiovascular risk and mortality in the United\nStates. Despite obesity's disproportionately high prevalence\nin African Americans and Hispanic American (1,2), stud-\nies suggest that its adverse impact on cardiovascular risk\nand mortality may be reduced in some minority populations\n(3\u00ad8). For example, even though African Americans have a\nhigher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes than white\nAmericans, evidence suggests that the associations between\nobesity and these cardiovascular risk factors are steeper in\nwhite Americans than in African Americans (9\u00ad11). The\nadverse relationship between obesity and dyslipidemia is\nsimilarly attenuated in African Americans relative to white\nIncreasingly, systemic and vascular inflammation are\nimplicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular outcomes\n(12,13). C-reactive protein, or CRP, is a sensitive marker of\ninflammation and is perhaps the most well studied of these\nnovel markers of cardiovascular disease (14\u00ad16). Higher\nlevels of CRP are associated with higher risk of myocardial\ninfarction, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular \nmortality\n(14\u00ad17). CRP levels are also elevated in the presence of met-\nabolic risk factors such as obesity (18). Adipose tissue is a\nmajor producer of proinflammatory cytokines and hormones\nand is thought to induce low-grade systemic inflammation\n(19). However, while several studies demonstrate that levels\nof CRP are elevated in persons with higher BMI (18), and that\nweight loss reduces CRP (20,21), few studies have examined\nwhether obesity might have a differential impact on CRP lev-\nels in different racial and ethnic groups.\nIn this context, we examined the interplay of race, ethnicity,\nand obesity on CRP levels in a nationally representative sample\nof US adults to evaluate whether the relationship between obe-\nsity and CRP is attenuated in Africans Americans and other\nethnic minorities relative to white Americans.\n1Division of General Medicine and Primary Care, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts,\nUSA; 2Cardiovascular Epidemiology Research Unit, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston,\nMassachusetts, USA.

Wee (cwee@bidmc.harvard.edu)\narticles\nepidemiology\nMethods And Procedures\nData source and measurements\nWe used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey, or NHANES, a stratified multistage probability sample of the\nnoninstitutionalized civilian population of the United States conducted\nby the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National\nCenter for Health Statistics (22). NHANES is designed to assess the\nhealth and nutritional status of adults and children through inter-\nviews and physical examination; methodological aspects of the study\nthe study was redesigned to be an ongoing continuous program. Data\nare released in 2-year cycles. NHANES oversamples certain popula-\ntions, including African Americans, Mexican Americans, and pregnant\nwomen; however, design weights and sampling information are pro-\nvided so that analyses can account for the complex sampling design\nand be generalized to the US population. Our study utilized the most\nexempted from continuing review by the Institutional Review Board at\nBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\nOur study sample consisted of adults aged 20 years and older, who\ncompleted home interviews, self-administered questionnaires, and phys-\nical and laboratory examinations at mobile examination units. Infor-\nmation about participants' sociodemographic characteristics, health\nhabits, and medical history were collected via in-person interviews and\nthrough self-administered questionnaires. We categorized participants'\nself-identified race/ethnicity as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black\nor African American, Mexican Hispanic, and non-Mexican Hispanic,\nand other race/ethnicity. Because participants in the \"other race\" cat-\negory are a small but heterogeneous group (n = 466), we did not include\nthese participants in our study. We also classified participants accord-\ning to other relevant demographic and behavioral factors including\neducational status (less than high school, completed high school, high\nschool and beyond), smoking history (never smoked or smoked <100\ncigarettes in lifetime, former smoker, and current smoker), alcohol use,\nand physical activity level. Quantity and frequency of alcohol use were\njointly characterized as follows: nondrinker; 1\u00ad2 drinking days/week\nand less than two drinks per day; 1\u00ad2 drinking days/week and two or\nmore drinks per day; 3 or more drinking days/week and two or less\ndrinks per day; 3 or more drinking days/week and two or more drinks\nper day. We calculated the energy expended in metabolic equivalents\n(METs) based on participants' reports of physical activity using estimates\nprovided in NHANES (22,26) and classified physical activity level in\npopulation-based quartiles.\nParticipants were also asked to report all over-the-counter and pre-\nscription medications including medications that might affect CRP lev-\nels such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, lipid-lowering\nstatin medications, and estrogen-containing medicines (27). At the time\nof our study, medication use was available only for participants of the\nA standardized set of physical and laboratory examinations were\nconducted in mobile examination centers and included measured\nheight and weight. Our primary measure of adiposity, BMI, was\ncalculated from measured height and weight; we classified partici-\nII\u00adIII obesity (BMI = 35.0kg/m2 and higher), according to standard\ndefinitions (28). Waist circumference, our second marker of adipos-\nity, was measured in centimeters and then converted to inches and\nwas classified in sex-specific quartiles. Blood samples were collected\non adults' aged 20 years and older and centrifuged within 1h of phle-\nbotomy and frozen at -10\u00b0C. CRP concentrations were measured by\nlatex-enhanced nephelometry (N high-sensitivity CRP assay) (22). We\ntreated high-sensitivity CRP as a continuous outcome and excluded\nlevels likely reflect acute illness. We also excluded a small number\nwomen who were pregnant (n = 486).\nStatistical analysis\nWe characterized CRP levels in our overall sample, according to race,\nethnicity, BMI, and waist circumference. Because CRP levels were not\nnormally distributed, we used the logarithmic transformation of CRP\nlevels as our outcome measure in sex-specific multivariable analyses\nand then \"back transformed\" our results and expressed our findings\nin terms of the geometric mean of CRP. We examined the association\nbetween BMI and log CRP, adjusting for race and ethnicity and then\ntested for an interaction between race/ethnicity and BMI. Our primary\nanalyses were adjusted for age, education, and health behaviors (smok-\ning, alcohol, and physical activity). In sensitivity analyses in the subset\nwith complete data, we considered the confounding effect of income\nand medication use (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins,\nand estrogen use in women) separately on the relationship between\nBMI and log CRP. To explore the robustness of our findings, we exam-\nined the association between waist circumference and log CRP using\nthe similar approach as for our BMI-log CRP analyses.\nWe weighted all analyses to reflect population estimates and used SAS-\ncallable SUDAAN statistical software (Research Triangle Park, NC) (29)\nto produce appropriate standard errors that account for the complex clus-\ntered sampling design.\nResults\nor higher and a CRP of 10mg/l or lower. Sex-stratified demo-\ngraphic and behavioral factors differed significantly across race\nand ethnicity in our sample. Before adjustment, BMI and waist\ncircumference also varied significantly by race and ethnicity\nin both men and women. In contrast, mean CRP levels were\nsignificantly different by race and ethnicity in women but not\nin men; among women, CRP levels were lowest in whites and\nhighest in Mexican Hispanics.\nTable 2 presents age-adjusted CRP levels across BMI and\nrace/ethnicity, as well as across waist circumference and race/\nethnicity. Higher BMI and higher waist circumference were\nassociated with higher CRP levels for men and women in all\nracial and ethnic groups studied (P < 0.001 for all).\nHigher BMI was associated with CRP levels after adjustment\nfor age, race and ethnicity, education, and health behaviors, P <\n0.001 for both men and women (data not shown). Figure 1 pres-\nents mean CRP levels in men and women by race and ethnicity\nafter adjustment. The relationship between BMI and mean CRP\ndid not vary significantly across race and ethnicity in men (P =\n0.10 for race\u00adBMI interaction) or in women (P = 0.37 for race\u00ad\nBMI interaction). However, while not statistically significant, the\nslope for the relationships between BMI and CRP appear steeper\nfor non-MexicanHispanicAmericansthanfor other groups;this\napparent steeper relationship was driven primarily by the dis-\nproportionately high CRP levels in non-Mexican Hispanics with\na BMI 35kg/m2 which comprised <30 participants. Additional\nadjustment for income and relevant medications in sensitivity\nanalyses did not change our results substantially.\nHigher waist circumference was also significantly associated\nwith CRP levels in both men and women (P < 0.001 for both)\nafter adjustment for age, race and ethnicity, education, and\nhealth behaviors. This association varied significantly by race\nand ethnicity (P = 0.01) in women but not in men (P = 0.77).\nAmong women, the association between waist circumference\narticles\nepidemiology\nand CRP was most striking for Mexican-Hispanic Americans.\nThese results were consistent in sensitivity analyses adjusting\nfor income and relevant medications.\nTable 3 presents the age-adjusted mean waist circumference\nfor men and women across BMI and race and ethnicity in the\noverall study population. In analyses stratified by BMI category,\nracial and ethnic differences in mean waist circumference were\nhighly significant (P < 0.001 at all BMI levels) in men. Among\nwomen, racial and ethnic differences reached statistical signifi-\ncance only for women in the middle two BMI levels (P = 0.02\nethnic differences in the adjusted relationship between waist\ncircumference and CRP (Figure 2) might be due to racial and\nethnic differences in the association between BMI and waist\nWhite\nAfrican\nAmerican\nMexican\nHispanic\nNon-\nMexican\nHispanic P valuea White\nAfrican\nAmerican\nMexican\nHispanic\nNon-\nMexican\nHispanic P valueb\nMean age, y\n(s.e.)\nMean CRP levels\n(mg/l) (s.e.)\nWaist\ncircumference,\n Never\n smoker\n Former\n smoker\n Current\n smoker\n Less than\n high school\n High school\n graduate\n College\n graduate\nMedications\n Anti-\n inflammatory\n Estrogen-\n containing\n hormones\nCRP, C-reactive protein; MET, metabolic equivalent.\naSignificance level for racial and ethnic differences for factor of interest in men; bSignificance level for racial differences in women.\narticles\nepidemiology\ncircumference, we conducted post-hoc multivariable analy-\nses of waist circumference and CRP, additionally adjusting for\nBMI (both in categories and linearly). The relationship between\nwaist circumference and CRP were attenuated but remained\nstatistically significant; moreover, the interaction between\nwaist circumference and race-ethnicity remained statistically\nsignificant in women (Figure 3).\nDiscussion\nOur findings suggest that the relationship between obesity and\nhigher CRP levels appears to be as strong in African Americans\nand Hispanic Americans as in white American adults. The\nassociation between BMI and CRP did not vary significantly\nacross race and ethnicity, and the association between larger\nwaist circumference and higher CRP levels was also at least as\nstrong in African Americans and possibly stronger in Mexican-\nHispanic\u00adAmerican women relative to white women.\nCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among\nAmericans and the leading cause of death attributable to obe-\nsity (8). Moreover, among certain racial and ethnic minority\npopulations such as African Americans, the rate of death from\ncardiovascular disease is substantially higher than the rate in\nwhites (4,5). Paradoxically, while the prevalence of obesity and\nthe rate of cardiovascular death is higher in African Americans,\na number of studies have suggested that obesity has less of an\nadverse impact on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in\nAfrican Americans than in white populations in the United\nStates (3\u00ad8). The racial differences are most striking in women,\nwhere the relative risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality\nassociated with the highest categories of BMI can be several-\nfold higher in white women compared to African American\nwomen (8). Much less is known about the impact of obesity on\nmortality differing between Hispanic and white populations.\nWhile the factors contributing to racial differences in the\nimpact of BMI and mortality are unclear, growing evidence\nsuggests that obesity may have a reduced impact on some tra-\nditional cardiovascular risk factors (9\u00ad11).

A few studies have also suggested that while\nAfrican Americans are more likely to develop hypertension\nthan white Americans, the association between higher BMI\nand the prevalence of hypertension is attenuated in African\nAmericans (11,31). Similarly, the relationship between obe-\nsity and adverse lipid profile may also be reduced in African\nAmericans relative to whites (11).\nHowever, traditional cardiovascular risk factors do not fully\ncharacterize an individual's cardiovascular risk. Increasingly,\nstudies in primarily white-American populations suggest\nthat inflammatory markers such as CRP levels have shown\nto independently predict cardiovascular disease and adverse\ncardiovascular outcomes (14\u00ad17). Although the magnitude\nof the predictive contribution of inflammation beyond that of\ntraditional cardiovascular risk factors is being debated (32,33),\none of the mechanisms by which obesity and adiposity confer\ncardiovascular risk is likely through heightened inflammation.\nOur findings suggest that the relationship between BMI and\nCRP levels is comparable among white, African-American,\nand Hispanic populations in the United States and that vis-\nceral adiposity, measured by waist circumference, may be more\nadversely associated with inflammation in Mexican-Hispanic\nwomen than in white women. Given our findings, observed\nracial differences in the relationship between obesity and car-\ndiovascular mortality risk are unlikely to be mediated by an\nattenuated relationship between obesity and CRP level in cer-\ntain racial and ethnic minorities.\nPrevious studies have suggested that CRP levels do vary by\nsexandrace(34\u00ad37),althoughfewhaveexaminedthisvariation\nin the context of obesity. These prior data suggest that women\ngenerally have higher CRP levels than men and that African\nAmericans, particularly African-American women and south\nAsians generally have higher levels than white adults (34). In\nthe Women's Health Study, African-American women had the\nhighest CRP levels, Asian women had the lowest, and white\nand Hispanic women had levels in the intermediate range (37).\nOur data also suggest that women generally have higher CRP\nlevels than men but that much of the racial difference in CRP\nlevels in women, in particular, is substantially diminished after\naccounting for age and obesity. We found no racial differences\nin the relationship between obesity and CRP level in both men\nand women, with one exception. Among women, Mexican\nHispanics with the largest waist circumference had an exag-\ngerated CRP level compared to women of other racial/ethnic\ngroups. The significance of this finding is unclear and needs to\nbe replicated in future studies.\nOur study has several limitations. First, the cross-sectional\nand observational design prevents us from drawing causal\ninferences about the relationship between obesity and CRP\nlevels. Second, BMI and waist circumference are surrogate\nmarkers for adiposity, and CRP is only one measure of inflam-\nmation.Finally,wewereunabletoadjustforresidualconfound-\ning from noncardiovascular, inflammatory conditions that are\nnot in the causal pathway between obesity and cardiovascular\nLowest quartile\nAdjusted mean CRP levels\nAdjusted mean CRP levels\nMen\nWhite\nAfrican American\nMexican Hispanic\nNon-Mexican Hispanic\nP = 0.77 for WC\u00adrace interaction\n2nd quartile\nWaist circumference quartile\n3rd quartile Highest quartile\nLowest quartile 2nd quartile\nWaist circumference quartiles\n3rd quartile Highest quartile\nWomen\nWhite\nAfrican American\nMexican Hispanic\nNon-Mexican Hispanic\nP = 0.01 for WC\u00adrace interaction\nFigure 2 Adjusted mean C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (s.e.) by waist\ncircumference (WC) in men and women (adjusted for age, education,\nsmoking, alcohol, and physical activity level).\nLowest quartile\nAdjusted mean CRP levels\nAdjusted mean CRP levels\nMen\nWhite\nAfrican American\nMexican Hispanic\nNon-Mexican Hispanic\nP = 0.96 for WC\u00adrace interaction\n2nd quartile\nWaist circumference quartiles (BMI linear)\n3rd quartile Highest quartile\nLowest quartile 2nd quartile\nWaist circumference quartiles (BMI linear)\n3rd quartile Highest quartile\nWomen\nWhite\nAfrican American\nMexican Hispanic\nNon-Mexican Hispanic\nP = 0.01 for WC\u00adrace interaction\nFigure 3 Adjusted mean C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (s.e.) by waist\ncircumference (WC) in men and women with additional adjustment for\nBMI (adjusted for age, education, smoking, alcohol, physical activity,\nand BMI (continuous)).\narticles\nepidemiology\noutcomes, although we attempted to minimize this confound-\ning by excluding underweight and pregnant individuals and\nthose with CRP levels above 10mg/l from our study.\nIn summary, obesity appears to be as strongly associated with\nsystemic inflammation as measured by CRP levels in African\nAmericans and Hispanic Americans as in white Americans.\nRacial differences in the relationship between obesity and\ncardiovascular mortality are unlikely to be mediated by racial\ndifferences in obesity's association with CRP levels.
