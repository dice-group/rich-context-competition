Thus, we assessed these components in hydronephrotic mice treated with\nAT1 receptor blockade and ACE inhibitor.\nMaterials and methods: Hydronephrosis was induced by left ureteral ligation in Balb/C mice except sham-operated\nanimals. The levels of cardiac ACE, ACE2 and Mas receptor were measured after treatment of losartan or enalapril.\nResults: Hydronephrosis led to an increase of ACE level and a decrease of ACE2 and Mas receptor in the heart.\nLosartan decreased cardiac ACE level, but ACE2 and Mas receptor levels significantly increased in hydronephrotic mice\n(p < 0.01). Enalapril increased ACE2 levels (p < 0.01), but did not affect Mas receptor in the heart. Plasma renin activity\n(PRA) and Ang II decreased in hydronephrotic mice, but significantly increased after treatment with losartan or enalapril.\nConclusions: Hydronephrosis increased cardiac ACE and suppressed ACE2 and Mas receptor levels. AT1 blockade\ncaused sustained activation of cardiac ACE2 and Mas receptor, but ACE inhibitor had the limitation of such activation of\nMas receptor in hydronephrotic animals.\n",

Cardiovascular diseases are\ncommonly associated with an imbalance within the\nRAS. However, to date, whether cardiovascular regula-\ntion through the local RAS is altered in hydronephrosis\nhas yet to be investigated. Therefore, the present study\nwas to assess the regulation of levels of ACE, ACE2 and\nMas receptor in the heart in Balb/C mice, with a hydro-\nnephrotic kidney induced by left ureteral ligation. This\nstudy was designed to evaluate these parameters after\ntreatment with ACE inhibitor and angiotensin (Ang)\ntype I (AT1) blockade. Since the inhibition of vasocon-\nstrictor effects of Ang II with ACE inhibitors or AT1\nblockade relates to beneficial renal and cardiac effects in\npatients with kidney disease,18,19 we have also investi-\ngated the effects of ACE inhibition and AT1 blockade on\nblood pressure, plasma renin activity (PRA), Ang I and\nAng II in hydronephrosis.\nHydronephrosis alters cardiac ACE2 and\nMas receptor expression in mice\nYanling Zhang, Lulu Ma, Junyan Wu and Tingting Chen\n Keywords\nHydronephrosis, heart, ACE inhibitor, AT1 receptor, renin, kidney\nDepartment of Physiology, Institute of Neurobiology, Taishan Medical\nUniversity, China\nCorresponding author:\nYanling Zhang, Department of Physiology, Institute of Neurobiology,\nChina.\nEmail: lzhang98@hotmail.com\nOriginal Article\n268 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(2)\nMaterials and methods\nAnimals and experimental protocol\nSixty male Balb/C mice, aged 10 weeks, were used in this\nstudy. The experiments were conducted according to the\nNational Research Council's guidelines and were approved\nby the Taishan Medical University Ethics Committee. All\nmice weighing 25\u00ad30 g were subjected to left ureteral ligation\nexcept the sham-operated group (n = 15). The surgical proce-\ndure of the left ureteral ligation was performed as described\npreviously.12,13 Sham-operated mice underwent a similar\noperation without the ureteral ligation. Mice were maintained\non a standard laboratory diet and had free access to tap water.\nFour weeks after the operation the left kidney was hydrone-\nphrotic.12\u00ad14 Following the ureteral ligated surgery, animals\nwere randomly allocated to a vehicle (n = 15) or losartan at a\n(Ena, n = 15) by daily oral gavage for four weeks.\nBlood pressure was measured by the tail-cuff method\nusing photoelectric volume oscillometry (ALC-NIBP\nAnalysis System, Aoer Biotech, Shanghai), as described\nAt four weeks of treatment, animals were sacrificed by\nintraperitoneal pentobarbital sodium overdose (100 mg\nkg-1). At postmortem, a blood sample was taken from the\nabdominal aorta. Plasma was separated from each blood\nsample by microcentrifuge. Heart tissue was removed and\nweighed. A whole heart was cut longitudinally and snap-\nfrozen in isopentane/dry ice for immunohistochemical\nstudies. A piece of each tissue was preserved at \u00ad80\u00baC for\nreverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\nand Western blot analysis.\nPRA, Ang I and Ang II assays\nPRA, Ang I and Ang II were measured by a radioimmu-\nnoassay using a commercial kit (Puer Weiye Biotech,\nBeijing) based on methods described previously.12\u00ad14\nMeasurement of ACE, ACE2 and Mas receptor\nmessenger RNA (mRNA)\nTotal RNA was extracted from the heart using TRIzol\n(Invitrogen, NY, USA) according to the manufacturer's\nprotocol. RT-PCR was carried out using a PCR Reagent\nKit (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously.14\nHousekeeping gene -actin was used as an internal stand-\nard. The results were normalized to -actin mRNA quanti-\ntated from the same samples. The primers used in this\nstudy are as follows: ACE forward 5'-TAACTCGAGT\nGA-3'; -actin forward 5'-GTCGTACCACTGGCATTGT\nG-3' and reverse 5'-TCTCAGCTGTGGTGGTGAAG-3'.\nDensitometric analysis of PCR was performed using the\nDigital Imaging System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).\nWestern blot analysis\nProtein from heart tissue was extracted and subjected to\nWestern blot analysis as reported previously.20 Thirty \u00b5g of\nprotein was loaded per lane, separated in 10% sodium dode-\ncyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)\nand transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) mem-\nbranes. The membranes were probed using primary antibod-\nies against ACE, ACE2 and Mas receptor (all from Santa\nCruz Biotech Inc, Dallas, TX, USA), respectively, followed\nby horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for\ntwo hours at room temperature. Chemoluminescence was\ndetected with an enhanced chemilumescent (ECL) kit (Pierce,\nBoston, MA, USA) and subsequent exposure to Hyperfilm\n(Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The amount of ACE,\nACE2 and Mas receptor was expressed relative to that of\nglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).\nACE2 immunohistochemistry\nSections of unfixed hearts were embedded in PolyFreeze\nTissue Freezing Medium (Polysciences, Warrington, PA,\nUSA) and snap-frozen in isopentane/dry ice as described\npreviously.11 Briefly, cryostat sections, 7 \u00b5m thick, were cut\nand fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C.\nThe sections were incubated with the dilution of primary\nantibody against ACE2 (Santa Cruz Biotech Inc, USA) at\ndilution of 1:200 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solu-\ntion. After washing with PBS, they were incubated with\nperoxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Ig)G\n(goat polyclonal, 1:5000) for one hour at 4\u00b0C. The color was\ndeveloped with 0.05% 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydro-\n.

Data\nhydronephrosis, caused by the left ureteral ligation, is\nassociated with alterations in the activity of the RAS, such\nas levels of ACE, ACE2 and Mas receptor in the heart.\nThis study reports for the first time that hydronephrosis\ncan lead to an increase in the levels of cardiac ACE mRNA\nand its protein and a reduction in the levels of cardiac\nACE2 and Mas receptor. The left hydronephrosis was\naccompanied by decreased PRA, indicating that renin\nrelease was less into the circulation due to the damage of\ndid not significantly change in mice, suggesting that\nhydronephrosis in one kidney did not cause a rise in blood\npressure. These results were consistent with previous\nreports12\u00ad14 demonstrating that the signal leading to hyper-\ntension in this model is transmitted through the barorecep-\nThe present study showed that both AT1 receptor block-\nade and ACE inhibitor decreased the levels of cardiac ACE\nmRNA and its protein in hydronephrotic mice. Meanwhile,\nthe two reagents increased PRA and decreased MAP. These\nresults demonstrated that losartan and enalapril had the\neffects on renin activity in the circulation and also on the\nRAS in the heart. Thus, we further examined whether the\ntwo reagents affect the expression of cardiac ACE2 and\nMas receptor in hydronephrosis. Administration of losartan\nand enalapril decreased MAP and increased the levels of\ncardiac ACE2 in mice with a hydronephrotic kidney.\nHowever, only losartan was observed to increase the level\nof cardiac Mas receptor. In contrast, there was no signifi-\ncant effect of enalapril on the expression of the Mas recep-\ntor in these animals, suggesting that losartan and enalapril\nmay have different mechanisms affecting the cardiac Mas\nreceptor in hydronephrotic mice. At the present time, we do\nnot know the exact cause of the different effects induced by\nlosartan and enalapril on the Mas receptor; however, both\nreagents decreased MAP with a similar pattern, indicating\nthat blood pressure may not be a critical factor leading to\nthe different impacts on cardiac Mas receptor. Furthermore,\npressure was not altered in mice with a hydronephrotic kid-\nney. The normotensive status in this model suggests a pres-\nsure-independent mechanism for the alteration of Mas\nreceptor level in hydronephrotic animals.\nIn previous studies, we reported that plasma renin con-\ncentration (PRC) was reduced from the hydronephrotic\nkidney.13,14 The present study showed that PRA and Ang II\nwere lower in hydronephrotic mice, implying a decrease\nin renin activity in animals due to the damage of the\nmacula densa, one of the critical factors controlling\nrenin secretion.23\u00ad25 Furthermore, a level of cardiac ACE\nFigure 4.

Data\n272 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(2)\nexpression was elevated in hydronephrotic mice. In the\npresent study, the changes in plasma renin are highly\nlikely to have been associated with decreased Ang II lev-\nels, especially because of the reduction of renin release\nfrom the hydronephrotic kidney.

These results also suggest that acti-\nvation of cardiac ACE2 by both enalapril and losartan may\nprotect against the adverse effects of activated RAS and\nrenal impairment. Thus, we propose that the change of car-\ndiacACE2 and Mas receptor expression induced by hydro-\nnephrosis can be an important target of strategies for\npreventing cardiovascular damage.\nIn summary, many clinical studies have discussed the\nrenal diseases impairing cardiovascular functions. In this\nstudy, we found that hydronephrosis caused the alteration of\ncardiac ACE, ACE2 and Mas receptor levels. Furthermore,\nlosartan evoked the activation both ofACE2 and Mas recep-\ntor in the heart, but enalapril had a limited effect on the Mas\nreceptor. These findings may lead to an exciting new area in\nthe clinical administration of AT1 receptor blockade. The\nobservations of the different molecular mechanisms of\nlosartan and enalapril could be helpful for better options in\nthe treatment of cardiovascular diseases.\n"
