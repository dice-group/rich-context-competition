If credit risk is measured by a single\nsystematic risk factor, sector concentration is usually not accounted for. The purpose of this\npaper is twofold. The empirical part measures the potential impact of business-sector\nconcentration on the economic capital (or unexpected loss) of several loan portfolios.

Introduction\nThe failure of not recognizing diversification within banks' credit portfolios was a key\ncriticism of the 1988 Basel Accord. The minimum regulatory capital requirements (Pillar 1)\neven in the internal ratings based (IRB) approach of the Basel Framework of June 2004,\nhowever, still do not differentiate between portfolios with different grades of diversification.\nRecognizing that banks' portfolios can exhibit credit risk concentrations, Basel II stipulates\nthat this risk be addressed in the supervisory review process (Pillar 2), thus creating a need for\nan appropriate methodology to measure this risk.\nConcentration risk in banks' credit portfolios arises either from an excessive exposure to\ncertain names (often referred to as name concentration or coarse granularity) or from an\nexcessive exposure to a single sector or to several highly correlated sectors (i.e. sector\nconcentration). In the past, financial regulation and previous research have focused mainly on\nthe first aspect of concentration risk.2 Therefore, in this paper our focus is on sector\nconcentration risk, although granularity is also analyzed. Sectors are defined in the following\nas business sectors. Sectors defined by geographical regions are not considered in this paper\nbut our methodology would still be applicable in that case.\nThe critical role credit risk concentration has played in past bank failures has been\ndocumented in the literature.3 Therefore, the importance of prudently managing sectoral\nconcentration risk in banks' credit portfolios is generally well recognized. However, existing\nliterature does not provide much guidance on how to measure sectoral concentration risk.\nConsequently, whether particular levels of concentration need to be translated into an\nadditional capital buffer remains an open question.\nThis paper contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, in the empirical part, we\nmeasure economic capital in a CreditMetrics-type multi-factor model and evaluate how\nimportant the increase in economic capital is in a sequence of portfolios with increasing sector\n1 For their comments we thank, Alexandre Adam, Marc Carey, Marc De Ceuster, Michael Gordy, Thilo Liebig,\nJanet Mitchell, Jo\u00ebl Petey, Peter Raupach, Andrea Resti, participants in the Research Task Force of the Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision as well as participants at the 2006 AFSE conference on \"Recent\nDevelopments in Financial Economics\", the 2006 European Banking Symposium, the 6th Annual Bank\nResearch Conference (FDIC/JFSR), the 2006 C.R.E.D.I.T.

The analysis is based on portfolios which were constructed from German\ncentral credit register data on 2224 banks. The benchmark portfolio reflects the average\nbusiness-sector distribution of the banking system as some of the more concentrated portfolios\nmirror sector concentrations observed in individual banks. Information on business-sector\nconcentration of banks is not publicly available, thus central credit registers represent unique\nsources of data on sector concentrations in existing banks. Our emphasis on empirically\nobservable sector concentrations is therefore an important contribution.\nWe find that economic capital can substantially increase with sector concentration. Its increase\nfrom a credit portfolio representing the average sector distribution of the German banking\nsystem to a portfolio that is concentrated in a single sector can be as high as 50%.\nSecond, in the theoretical part we evaluate the accuracy of an analytic approximation for\nvalue-at-risk (VaR) and economic capital (EC) which was proposed in Pykhtin (2004) and\noffers a tractable closed-form solution for the measurement of concentration risk. EC is\ndefined as the difference between the VaR and the expected loss of a credit portfolio. We have\napplied a simplified version of the Pykhtin model which further reduces the computational\nburden by requiring the input parameters exposure size and probability of default (PD) only on\na sector level. Such a methodology could be useful for risk managers and supervisors in search\nof robust, fit-for-purpose tools to measure sector concentration in a bank's loan portfolio. The\nmodel allows banks and supervisors to approximate economic capital for loan portfolios\nwithout running computationally intensive Monte Carlo simulations.\nThe methodological framework of the Pykhtin model builds on earlier work by Gordy (2003)\nand Wilde (2001) on granularity adjustments in the asymptotic single risk factor (ASRF)\nmodel. Whereas the granularity adjustment deals with an unbalanced exposure distribution\nacross names, the Pykhtin model offers a treatment for an unbalanced distribution across\n(correlated) sectors. EC is given in closed form as the sum of the EC in a single risk factor\nmodel (in which the correlation with the single systematic risk factor depends on the sector)\nand a multi-factor adjustment term. We explore the approximation performance both before\nthe multi-factor adjustment is applied and afterwards which means we consider two\napproximation formulae.\nWe find that for portfolios with highly granular sectors and homogeneous PDs in every sector,\nboth analytic approximation formulae perform extremely well. Moreover, the multi-factor\nadjustment term is relatively small, so that EC in the single risk factor model is already close\nto the true EC values obtained by simulations. Our results hold for portfolios with different\nlevels of sector concentration, a different number of sectors as well as under various weights\nof the sector factors (i.e. factor weights sometimes referred to in literature as factor loadings)\nand various assumptions about factor correlations. Furthermore, we explore the accuracy of\nour model when we relax the assumptions that the portfolio is infinitely granular within each\nsector and that all exposures in the same sector have the same PD. We find that the model cp\nunderestimates EC in cases of low granularity, whereas it cp overestimates EC in the presence\nof heterogeneity in individual PDs, in particular if creditworthiness increases with exposure\nsize. The resulting errors in EC from both effects together were less than 10% in the cases\nunder study. Which of the two effects prevails depends on the specific input parameters. The\nresults seem to suggest, however, that for representative credit portfolios, the effect of PD\nheterogeneity is likely to be stronger than the effect of granularity. This implies that the\nanalytic approximations err on the conservative side.\nTo our knowledge there is only one recent empirical paper that considers the impact of sector\nconcentration risk on economic capital. Burton et al (2005) simulate the distribution of\nportfolio credit losses for a number of real US syndicated loan portfolios. They find that,\nalthough name concentration can meaningfully increase EC for smaller portfolios (which are\ndefined as portfolios with exposures of less than US$10 billion), sector concentration risk is\nthe main contributor to EC for portfolios of all sizes.\nTwo other models that measure concentration risk in a tractable model are presented by Garcia\nadjustment to the single risk factor model in the form of a scaling factor to the economic\ncapital required by the ASRF model. This \"diversification factor\" is an approximately linear\nfunction of a Hirschmann-Herfindahl index, calculated from the aggregated sector exposures.\nThis model, however, does not allow for different asset correlations across sectors. Contrary to\nthe approach in our paper, it cannot distinguish between a portfolio which is highly\nconcentrated towards a sector with a high correlation with other sectors, and another portfolio\nwhich is equally highly concentrated, but towards a sector which is only weakly correlated\nwith other sectors. D\u00fcllmann (2006) extends Moody's Binomial Expansion Technique by\nintroducing default infection into the hypothetical portfolio on which the real portfolio is\nmapped in order to retain a simple solution for VaR. Unlike the Pykhtin model, the models\ndeveloped by Garcia Cespedes et al and D\u00fcllmann require the calibration of parameters using\nMonte Carlo simulations.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the default-mode version of the\nwell-established multi-factor CreditMetrics model which serves as a benchmark. Furthermore,\nwe discuss the simplified version of the Pykhtin model.\nThe empirical part of our paper comprises Sections 3 and 4. The credit portfolios on which the\nempirical analyses are based are described in Section 3. In Section 4 we explore the impact of\nsector concentration on EC by gradually increasing sector concentration, starting from a\nbenchmark portfolio.\nIn the theoretical part, which comprises Sections 5 to 7, we evaluate the performance of\nPykhtin's (2004) analytic approximation for economic capital by comparison with EC\nestimates from Monte Carlo simulations. Section 5 focuses on highly granular portfolios\nwhich are homogeneous on a sector level and, in particular, on the sensitivity of the results to\nthe number of risk factors and correlation figures. Section 6 deals with portfolios characterized\nby lower granularity and Section 7 introduces PD heterogeneity on an exposure level. Section\n8 summarizes and concludes.\n2. Measuring concentration risk in a multi-factor model\n2.1. General framework\nWe assume that every loan in a portfolio can be assigned to a different borrower, so that the\nnumber of exposures or loans equals the number of borrowers. Each borrower i can uniquely\nbe assigned to a single specific sector. In practice, (large) firms often comprise business lines\nfrom different industry sectors. However, we make this assumption here for practical and\npresentational purposes. Let M denote the number of borrowers or loans in the portfolio, Ms\nthe number of borrowers in sector s, S the number of sectors and wsi\nthe weight of the\nexposure of borrower i in sector s relative to the total portfolio exposure.\nThe general framework is a multi-factor default-mode Merton-type model.4 The dependence\nstructure between borrower defaults is driven by sector-dependent systematic risk factors\nwhich are usually correlated. Each risk factor can be uniquely assigned to a different sector, so\nthat the number of sectors and the number of factors are the same. Credit risk occurs only as a\ndefault event at the end of a one-year horizon, which is consistent with traditional book-value\naccounting. The unobservable, normalized asset return Xsi\nof the i-th borrower in sector s\ntriggers the default event if it crosses the default barrier si\n. The corresponding unconditional\ndefault probability psi\nis defined as\n( ).\n\n= \nsi si si\np P X\nThe latent variable Xsi\nfollows a factor model and can be written as a linear function of an\nindustry sector risk factor\ns\nY and an idiosyncratic risk factor\nsi\n :\n= + -\nsi s s s si\nX rY r\nwhere { }\ns S\n and { }\ns\ni M\n . The higher the value of the sector-dependent factor\nweight rs\n, the more sensitive the asset returns of firm i in sector s are to the sector factor. The\ndisturbance term\nsi\n follows a standard normal distribution. The assumed weight on the\nidiosyncratic risk guarantees that Xsi\nhas a standard normal distributioni\n.\nof models. The origin of these models can be found in the seminal work by Merton (1974).\nThe correlations between the systematic sector risk factors Ys\nand Yt\nare denoted by \nst\nand\nare often referred to as factor correlations. The sector factors can be expressed as a linear\ncombination of independent, standard normally distributed factors Z1\n,...,ZS\n.\n\n=\n= \nS\ns st t\nt\nY Z with 2\n\n=\n=\n\nS\nst\nt\nfor { }\ns S\n .\nThe matrix ( )\n\n \nst s t S\nis obtained from a Cholesky decomposition of the factor correlation\nmatrix. The asset correlation st\nfor each pair of borrowers in sectors s and t, respectively, can\nbe shown to be given by\n=\nS\nst s t st s t sn tn\nn\nr r r r\n   \n=\n=  .\nDependencies between borrowers arise only from their affiliation with the industry sector and\nfrom the correlations between the systematic sector factors. The intra-sector asset correlation\nfor each pair of borrowers is simply the factor weight 2\ns\nr squared.\nIf a firm defaults, the amount of loss depends on the stochastic loss severity \nsi\nwhose\nrealization is assumed to be known at the time of default. The credit losses of the whole\nportfolio are given by\n\n-\n\n= =\n= \ns\nsi si\nM\nS\nsi si X N p\ns i\nL w .\nwhere\n{.}\n1 gives the indicator function.\nWe assume the same expected loss severity [ ]\n \n=\nsi\nE for all borrowers and that all\nidiosyncratic risk in loss severities is diversified away in the portfolio.5\nIn summary, the model needs the following input parameters:\n\u00b7 relative exposure size wsi\nand default probability psi\nof the i-th borrower in sector s\n\u00b7 the factor correlation matrix and\n\u00b7 the sector-dependent factor weight rs\n2.2. The CreditMetrics default-mode model\nTo obtain the loss distribution, CreditMetrics applies Monte Carlo simulations by generating\nasset returns and counting the default events. In each simulation run the portfolio loss is\ndetermined from equation (3). For each exposure, the asset returns for the corresponding\nborrower are generated according to equations (1a/b) and compared with the default threshold,\n5 The models analyzed in this paper can also be extended to incorporate idiosyncratic risk in loss severities, if\nrequired.\nwhich can be determined given the borrower's default probability. If the realized value of the\nasset return falls below the threshold \nsi\n, the borrower is in default. The portfolio loss of a\nsimulation run is calculated by adding up the incurred losses from the defaulted borrowers.\nThe number of simulation runs in our analyses is typically 200,000. Portfolio losses obtained\nin each simulation run are then sorted to form the distribution of portfolio losses, from which\nEC can be calculated as the difference between the q-quantile of this loss distribution (i.e., the\nVaR) and the expected loss. Since it is obtained by simulation, we refer to it in the following\nas\nsim\nEC .\n2.3. Analytic EC approximation\nIn this section, we describe an analytical approximation to the VaR in the framework of a\nmulti-factor model. We use a simplified version of the model developed by Pykhtin (2004).\nThe model approximates the VaR in a multi-factor model by adding a \"multi-factor\"\nadjustment term to the VaR in a single factor model in which the correlation of the firm's asset\nreturns with the single factor depends on the firm's sector. The main advantage of this model is\nits tractability, since it does not require Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, we have\nsimplified the model in such a way that it only requires exposure size and PD on a sector level\ninstead of an individual borrower level. The factor correlation matrix and the factor weights\nare still needed as in the CreditMetrics model.\nOn the basis of the work by Gouri\u00e9roux et al (2000) and Martin and Wilde (2002), we can\napproximate the portfolio loss L (see equation 3) by a perturbed loss variable *\n\n\n= +  ,\nwhere *\nL is a random variable constructed such that the q-quantile of its distribution given in\nclosed form is close to the q-quantile of the distribution of L. U is defined as the perturbation\n*\n-\nL L and  is its scaling parameter. *\nL depends on the default probability *\n^( )\np Y ,\nconditional on a single systematic risk factor *\nY :\n( )\n* *\n^\nS\ns s\ns\nL w p Y\n\n=\n=  with\n*\n( )\n^ ( )\n-\n \n-\n \n=\n \n-\n \ns s\ns\ns\nN p c Y\np Y N\nc\nwhere cs\nis the correlation between the systematic risk factor *\nY and the asset returns of the\nfirms in sector s. In oder to relate relate *\nL to L, *\nY finally needs to be related to the risk\nfactors Z1\n, ...,ZS\nin the original model. If *\nY in (4) is replaced by the realization corresponding\nto the q-quantile\n( )\n*\nq\nt Y , then *\nL equals the VaR\n( )\n*\nq\nt L for a confidence level q in the\nasymptotic single risk factor (ASRF) model with infinitely granular sectors. Note that this\nsingle risk factor model differs from the well-known ASRF model in that the asset correlation\ncs\nis determined by the sector to which the borrower belongs. To avoid confusion, we call this\nmodel the \"ASRF* model\", reserving the term \"ASRF model\" for the model with uniform\nasset correlations.\nThe q-quantile of the loss distribution, tq\n(L) can then be approximated by ( )\n\nq\nt L , or as the\nsum of the VaR in the ASRF model *\n( )\nq\nt L and a multi-factor adjustment\nq\nt\n . This multi-\nfactor adjustment can be determined from a Taylor series expansion of ( )\n\nq\nt L . The first-order\neffect\n* *\n( )\n( )\nq\nq\ndt L\nE U L t L\nd\n\n\n\n=\n \n= =\n \nvanishes because we require that *\nL for all portfolio compositions equals the expected loss\nconditional on *\nY , that is * *\n|\n \n=  \nL E L Y . By keeping terms up to quadratic order and\nneglecting higher-order terms, we can approximate the portfolio loss quantile ( )\nq\nt L as\n*\n( )\n( ) ( )\nq\nq q\nd t L\nt L t L\nd\n\n\n\n=\n +\nq\nt\n\nThe first summand in (5) denotes the VaR\n( )\n*\nq\nt L in the single risk factor model. The second\nsummand denotes the multi-factor adjustment,\nq\nt\n , which can be calculated according to\n( ) ( )\nq\ny N q\nl y\nt v y v y y\nl y l y\n-\n= -\n \n\n \n\n = - - +\n \n \n \n \n \nwhere ( )\nl y\n and ( )\nl y\n denote, respectively, the first and second derivative of the portfolio\nloss function given by equation (4) and setting  =\nY y . ( )\nv y gives the variance of L\nconditional on * =\nY y . Its first derivative is ( )\nv y\n . The details and the inputs of these\nequations are presented in Appendix B.\nThe link between L and *\nL is achieved by restricting *\nY to the space of linear mappings of the\nrisk factors Z1\n,...,ZS\n:\n*\n=\n= \nS\ns s\ns\nY b Z .\nThe correlations between the industry risk factors\ns\nY and the systematic risk factor *\nY are\ndenoted by *\n\ns\n. These are used to calculate the (also sector-dependent) correlations in the\nASRF* model using the following mapping function for { }\ns S\n :\n\n=\ns s s\nc r where *\n \n=\n= \nS\ns st t\nt\nb .\nDefining cs\nfor { }\ns S\n by (7) ensures that the required equality * *\n|\n \n=  \nL E L Y holds\nfor any portfolio composition.\nThere is no unique solution to determine the coefficients\n,...,\nS\nb b . In the following, we will\nuse the approach in Pykhtin (2004), which is briefly summarized in Appendix C.\n3. Portfolio composition\n3.1. Data set and definition of sectors\nOur analyses are based on loan portfolios which reflect characteristics of real bank portfolios\nobtained from European credit register data. Our benchmark portfolio represents the overall\nsector concentration of the German banking system and was constructed by aggregating the\nexposure values of loan portfolios of 2224 German banks in September 2004. The sample\nincludes branches of foreign banks located in Germany. Credit exposures to foreign\nborrowers, however, are excluded. We deem this to be a reasonable approximation of a\nportfolio characterized by a degree of diversification which banks can on average achieve\ngiven that it represents the aggregate relative sector exposures of the national banking system.\nIn principle, we could also have created a more diversified portfolio in the sense of having a\nlower VaR. However, such a portfolio would be specific to the credit risk model used and\nwould not be obtainable for all banks.\nAll credit institutions in Germany are required by the German Banking Act\n(Kreditwesengesetz) to report quarterly exposure amounts of those borrowers whose\nindebtedness to them amounts to 1.5 million or more at any time during the three calendar\nmonths preceding the reporting date. In addition, banks report national codes that are\ncompatible with the NACE classification scheme and indicate the economic activity of the\nborrower and his country of residence. Banks are required to aggregate individual borrowers\nfor regulatory reporting purposes to borrower units which are linked, for example, by equity\nholdings and constitute an entity sharing roughly the same risk. The aggregation of exposures\non a business sector level was carried out on the basis of borrower units. If borrowers in the\nsame unit belong to different sectors, the dominating exposure amount determines the final\nsector allocation. Therefore, the credit register includes not only exposures above 1.5 million,\nbut also smaller exposures to individual borrowers belonging to a borrower unit that exceeds\nthis exposure limit. This characteristic substantially increases its coverage of the credit market.\nThe industry classification chosen by CreditMetrics is the Global Industry Classification\nStandard (GICS), which was jointly launched by Standard & Poor's and Morgan Stanley\nCapital International (MSCI) in 1999. The classification scheme was developed to establish a\nglobal standard for categorizing firms into sectors and industries according to their principal\nbusiness activities. It comprises 24 industries grouped into 10 broad sectors.7 GICS further\ndivides these groups into industries and sub-industries. However, the latter more detailed\nschemes are not used by vendor models. In the following, we use the broad sector\nclassification scheme. Because some of the industry groups that form the broad \"Industrial\"\nsector are very heterogeneous, we decided to split this sector into three industry groups:\nCapital Goods (including Construction), Commercial Services and Supplies, and\nTransportation.8\nCredit register datasets, however, use the NACE industry classification system, which is quite\ndifferent from the GICS system. In order to use the information from the credit register, we\nmapped9 the NACE codes onto the GICS codes. Similar mappings are used by other vendor\nmodels, such as S&P's Portfolio Risk Tracker. We have excluded exposures to the financial\nsector (sector G) which comprises exposures to Banks (G1), Diversified Financials (G2),\nInsurance Companies (G3) and Real Estate (G4) because of the specificities of this sector.\nExposures to the real estate sector are heavily biased as a large number of them are exposures\nto borrowers that are related to the public sector. Since we could not differentiate between\nprivate and public enterprises in the real estate sector, we have excluded this sector from the\nfollowing analyses. We have also disregarded exposures to households since there is no\nrepresentative stock index for them. This is a typical limitation of models relying on stock\nprice returns for the estimation of asset correlations. In sum, we distinguish between 11\nsectors, which can be considered as broadly representing the Basel II asset classes Corporate\nand SMEs.\n3.2. Comparison with French, Belgian and Spanish banking\nsystems\nA rough comparison of the relative share of the sector decomposition between the aggregated\nGerman, French, Belgian and Spanish banking systems shows that the numbers are similar.10\nThe only noticeable difference is the greater share of the Capital Goods sector (33%) and the\n7 See Table 12 in Appendix A, which shows the broad sectors and the more detailed industry groups.\n8 Unreported simulations have shown that results are not affected by using the more detailed classification scheme.\n9 See Table 13 in Appendix A for the mapping.\n10 The exact figures are provided by Table 14 in Appendix A.\nsmaller share of the Commercial Services and Supplies sector in Spain compared to Germany\nand Belgium. In general, however, the average sector concentrations are very similar across\nthe four countries, which suggests that our results are to a large extent transferable.\nFigure 1: Comparison of average sector concentration for Germany, Spain, Belgium, and\nFrance (*)\nEnergy\nMaterials\nCapital goods\nCommercial\nservices and\nsupplies\nTransportation\nConsumer\ndiscretionary\nConsumer staples\nHealth care\nInformation\ntechnology\nTelecommunication\nservices\nUtilities\nGermany\nFrance\nBelgium\nSpain\n(*) A breakdown of Industrial sector C into the three categories Capital Goods, Commercial Services and Supplies,\nand Transportation is not available for France. The sector shares of the aggregated sector C, however, are quite\nsimilar for all four countries.\n3.3. Description of the benchmark portfolio\nThe sectoral distribution of exposures in the benchmark portfolio, which is shown in Table 1,\nrepresents the sectoral distribution of aggregate exposures in the German banking system. The\ndegree of concentration in this reference portfolio is purely national and driven by the firms'\nsector composition because we do not consider the impact of regional or country factors in our\nanalysis. It is not uncommon for banks to use a more detailed sector classification scheme. We\nconsider it more conservative to use a relatively broad sector classification scheme rather than\na very detailed one. In a broad sector classification scheme, a larger proportion of exposures is\nattached to one sector. Therefore, correlations between exposures of the same sector (intra-\nsector correlations), which are typically greater than the correlations between exposures of\ndifferent sectors (inter-sector correlations), will play a larger role.\nIn order to focus on the impact of sector concentration, we assume an otherwise homogeneous\nportfolio by requiring that all other characteristics of the portfolio are uniform across sectors.\nWe assume a total portfolio volume of 6 million that consists of 6,000 exposures of equal\nsize which implies a highly granular portfolio in which each exposure represents only 0.017%\nof the total portfolio exposure. Every borrower has a probability of default (PD) of 2% and\nevery exposure is to a different borrower, thus circumventing the need to consider multiple\nexposure defaults. We set a uniform expected loss severity or loss given default (LGD) of\n45%, which is the corresponding supervisory value for a senior unsecured loan in the\nFoundation IRB approach of the Basel II framework.11 In the CreditMetrics approach, industry\nweights can be assigned to each borrower according to its participation. Here, we assume that\nevery firm is exposed to only one sector as its main activity. Furthermore, we assume banks do\nnot reduce exposure to certain sectors by purchasing credit protection.\nTable 1: Composition of the benchmark portfolio (using the GICS sector classification\nscheme)\nTotal exposure\nNumber of\nexposures % exposure\n3.4. Sequence of portfolios with increasing sector concentration\nIn order to measure the impact on EC of more concentrated portfolios than the benchmark\nportfolio, we construct a sequence of six portfolios, each with increased sector concentration\nrelative to the previous one. To this end, we gradually increase sector concentration in our\nbenchmark portfolio by using the following algorithm. In each step we remove x exposures\nfrom all sectors and add them to a previously selected sector. This procedure is repeated until\na single-sector portfolio, which is the portfolio with the highest possible concentration, is\nobtained. The sector which receives x exposures at every step and also the amount x that is\ntransferred to this sector are determined in such a way that some of the generated portfolios\nreflect a degree of sector concentration that is actually observable in real banks.12\nTable 2 shows a sequence of seven portfolios in the order of increasing sector concentration.\nThe increase in sector concentration is also reflected in the Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index\n(HHI),13 given in the last row which is calculated at sector level. Portfolio 1 has been\nconstructed from the benchmark portfolio by re-allocating one third of each sector exposure to\nthe sector Capital Goods. The even more concentrated portfolios 2, 3, 4 and 5 have been\ncreated by repeated application of this rule. Portfolios 2 and 5 are similar to portfolios of\n12 This procedure for generating a sequence of portfolios with increasing sector concentration is by no means\nunique. Results however are not sensitive to alternative rules of portfolio generation.\nexisting banks14 insofar as the sector with the largest exposure size has a similar share of the\ntotal portfolio. Furthermore, the HHI is similar to what is observed in real-world portfolios.\nFinally, we created portfolio 6 with the highest degree of concentration as a one-sector\nportfolio by shifting all exposures to the Capital Goods sector.\nTable 2: Sequence of portfolios with increasing sector concentration\nBenchmark\nportfolio\nPortfolio\nPortfolio\nPortfolio\nPortfolio\nPortfolio\nPortfolio\n3.5. Intra and inter-sectoral correlations\nGiven that asset correlations are usually not observable, we have followed market practice in\nusing sample correlations of stock index returns for their estimation. Table 3 shows the\ncorrelation matrix of the log-returns of those MSCI EMU industry indices which correspond\nto the 11 sectors. The sector factor correlations are based on weekly return data covering the\nperiod from November 2003 to November 2004. Sectors that are highly correlated with other\nsectors (i.e. sectors that have an average inter-sector correlation of greater than 65%) are\nMaterials (B), Capital Goods (C1), Transportation (C3) and Consumer Discretionary (D).\nSectors that are moderately correlated with other sectors, i.e. sectors that have an average\ninter-sector correlation of between 45% and 65%, are Commercial Services and Supplies (C2),\nConsumer Staples (E) and Telecommunication (I). Sectors that are the least correlated with\nother sectors, i.e. sectors that have an average inter-sector correlation of less than 45%, are\nEnergy (A) and Health Care (F). The relative order of these sectors is broadly in line with\nresults reported in other empirical papers.15 The heterogeneity between Capital Goods,\nCommercial Services and Supplies, and Transportation is confirmed by noticeable differences\nin correlations. The intra-sector correlations and/or inter-sector correlations between exposures\n14 Confidentiality requires those banks with a high sector concentration remain anonymous.\ncompare the absolute inter-sector correlation values as different papers report different types of correlations. De\nServigny and Renault (2001) report inter-sector default correlation values, FitchRatings (2004) reports inter-\nsector equity correlations while Moody's (2004) provides correlation estimates inferred from co-movements in\nratings and asset correlation estimates. Furthermore, the different papers distinguish between a different number\nof sectors.\nare obtained by multiplying the sector correlations of Table 3 with the sector-dependent factor\nweights, see equation (2).\nTable 3: Correlation matrix based on MSCI EMU industry indices (based on weekly log\nMore difficult than the estimation of sector correlations is the determination of the factor\nweights, which determine the intra-sector asset correlations. We do not use the formula\nprovided in CreditMetrics to compute the factor weights as recent research has suggested that\nthis formula does not fit the German data very well.16 Instead, we assume a unique factor\nweight for all exposures and calibrate the value of the factor weight to match the\ncorresponding IRB regulatory capital charge. More precisely, we determine a factor weight\nrs\ns S\n such that the economic capital ECsim\nof the benchmark\nportfolio equals the IRB capital charge for corporate exposures, assuming a default probability\nof 2%, an LGD of 45% and a maturity of one year.\nSetting the sector factor weight to 0.5 is slightly more conservative than empirical results for\nGerman companies suggest. The average of all the correlation entries in the factor correlation\nmatrix is 0.59, which implies by evoking equation (2) an average asset correlation of 0.14\nbetween exposures. Empirical evidence17 has shown that German SMEs typically have an\ns\nr = . Large firms, however, are\ntypically more exposed to systematic risk than SMEs and therefore usually have higher asset\ncorrelation values.18\nEquation (2) implies that intra-sector asset correlations are thus fixed at 25%. Inter-sector asset\ncorrelations can be calculated by multiplying the factor weights of both sectors by the inter-\nsector factor correlation. The lowest correlation between the Energy sector index and the\nInformation Technology sector index of 10% translates into an inter-sector asset correlation of\n2.5%. The highest correlation occurs between the Commercial Services and Supplies and the\n18 See, for example, Lopez (2004) for empirical evidence of this relation for the US.\nConsumer Discretionary sector indices. At 92%, it translates into an inter-sector asset\n4. Impact of sector concentration on economic capital\nIn this section we analyze the impact of increasing sector concentration on economic capital,\nwhich is defined as the difference between the 99.9% percentile of the loss distribution and the\nexpected loss. The results are given in Table 4. We observe for the corporate portfolios that\neconomic capital increases from the benchmark portfolio to portfolio 2 by 20%. Economic\ncapital for the concentrated portfolio 5 increases by a substantial 37% relative to the\nbenchmark portfolio. These results demonstrate the importance of taking sector concentration\ninto account when calculating EC.\nTypically, the corporate portfolio comprises only a fraction of the total loan portfolio (which\nalso contains loans to sovereigns, other banks and private retail clients). Although the increase\nin sector concentration may have a significant impact on the EC of the corporate credit\nportfolio, it may have a much smaller impact in terms of a bank's total credit portfolio. For a\nmeaningful comparison, we assume that the corporate credit portfolio comprises 30% of the\ntotal credit portfolio and that the banks need to hold capital amounting to 8% of their total\nportfolio. By assuming that there are no diversification benefits between corporate exposures\nand the bank's other assets, the EC of the total portfolio can be determined as the sum of the\nEC for the corporate exposures and the EC for the remaining exposures.\nTable 4: Impact of sector concentration on economic capital (\nsim\nEC ) for the sequence of\ncorporate portfolios and for the sequence of total portfolios(*) of a bank (in percent)\nBenchmark\nportfolio\nPortfolio 1 Portfolio 2 Portfolio 3 Portfolio 4 Portfolio 5 Portfolio 6\n(*) Total portfolio includes 30% corporate credit and 70% other credit (to retail, sovereign,...)\nThe results for the total portfolios of the bank are also shown in Table 4. As expected, the\nimpact of an increase in sector concentration is much less severe when looking at the EC for\nthe total portfolio. Economic capital for portfolio 5, for example, increases by about 16%\nrelative to the benchmark portfolio instead of 37% if only the corporate portfolio is taken into\naccount.\nIn order to verify how robust our results are to the input parameters, we carried out the\nfollowing three robustness checks (RC1 - RC3):\n\u00b7 a lower uniform PD of 0.5% instead of 2% for all sectors (RC1),\n\u00b7 a different factor correlation matrix (See Table 15, Appendix A) representing the\ncorrelation matrix with the highest average annual correlation over the period between\n\u00b7 a uniform intra-sector asset correlation of 15% and a uniform inter-sector asset\ncorrelation of 6% (RC3), which are values used by Moody's for the risk analysis of\nThe results of the three robustness checks are summarized in Table 5. Although the absolute\nlevel of EC varies between these robustness checks, the relative increase in EC compared with\nthe benchmark portfolio is similar to previous results in this section. For Moody's correlation\nassumptions in RC3, the increase in EC is stronger than for the other robustness checks. This\ncan be explained by the larger difference between intra-sector and inter-sector correlations,\nwhich is justified by the higher number of sectors they use, and which leads to a stronger EC\nincrease when the portfolio becomes more and more concentrated in a single sector. We\nconclude that the observed substantial relative increase in EC due to the introduction of sector\nconcentration is robust against realistic variation of the input parameters. Furthermore, this\nincrease in EC may be even greater, depending on the underlying dependence structure.\nTable 5: EC for the benchmark portfolio and its relative increase for the more concentrated\nportfolios 1 - 6 (in percent of total exposure)\nPortfolio Using \"Initial rule\" RC1: PD=0.5%\nRC2: Higher\ncorrelation\nRC3: Moody's\nEC\nBenchmark\nportfolio\nProportional change of EC in %\n5. Evaluation of the EC approximations for sector-dependent PDs\nand high granularity\nThe purpose of this section is to use the model by Pykhtin to calculate EC and to compare\nthese EC approximations with the EC obtained from simulations. In this section we assume\nfirst homogeneity within each sector and second a highly granular exposure distribution in\neach sector. Because of these two assumptions of our simplified model, the results can be\nunderstood as an upper bound in terms of approximation quality. We further test the accuracy\nof the EC approximations by varying the sector distributions, the factor correlations, the factor\nweights, the number of factors and the sector PD. Portfolios of coarser granularity and\nheterogeneous PDs on an exposure level are studied in Sections 6 and 7.\nWe again assume a confidence level q of 99.9% and employ the following three risk measures\n(where\ns\nM\nS\nsi si\ns i\nEL w p\n\n= =\n=  ):\n\u00b7 economic capital in the ASRF* model, which is defined as\n( )\n* *\n= -\n\u00b7 economic capital based on the multi-factor adjustment,\n( )\n*\n= +  -\nMFA\nEC t L t EL\n\u00b7 economic capital based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations,\nsim\nEC\nFirstly, we present results for the benchmark portfolio and for the more concentrated portfolios\n1 - 6 in Table 6. The model parameters are the same as in Section 4.\nTable 6: Comparison of EC ,\nMFA\nEC and\nsim\nEC for different exposure distributions across\nsectors with increasing sector concentration given a default probability of 2% (in\npercent of total exposure)\nPortfolio EC\nMFA\nEC\nsim\nEC\nRelative error(*)\nof MFA\nEC\nBenchmark\nportfolio\n(*) The relative error is defined as the relative difference between\nsim\nEC and\nMFA\nEC .\nThe EC figures for the benchmark portfolio in Table 6 show that EC and\nMFA\nEC provide\nextremely accurate proxies for\nsim\nEC . This result suggests that in the given examples the\ncalculation of EC may, in practice, be sufficiently accurate for certain risk-management\npurposes. The four EC estimates for the more highly concentrated portfolios 1 - 6 indicate that\neconomic capital increases as expected, but that our results for the approximation performance\nof EC and\nMFA\nEC still hold. According to Table 6, relative errors of\nMFA\nEC are in a\nrelatively small range between 0.0% and 1.9%.\nSecondly, we check whether our results differ when we vary the underlying correlation\nstructure. To this end, we calculate in Table 7 the three risk measures for different factor\ncorrelation matrices. More specifically, we assume homogeneous factor correlation matrices in\nwhich the entries (outside the main diagonal) vary between 0 and 1 in increments of 0.2. The\nlast case, in which all factor correlations are equal to one, corresponds to the case of a single-\nfactor model.\nTable 7: Comparison of EC ,\nMFA\nEC and\nsim\nEC for different factor correlations , given a\ndefault probability of 2% (in percent of total exposure)\nFactor correlation\nMFA\nEC\nsim\nEC\nRelative error of\nMFA\nEC\nTable 7 shows\nsim\nEC and its proxies EC and\nMFA\nEC for increasing factor correlations. As\nexpected, economic capital increases with increasing factor correlations, since a higher factor\ncorrelation reduces the diversification potential by shifting probability mass to the tail of the\nloss distribution. The highest relative error of\nMFA\nEC of all factor correlations considered is\n2.5% which still reveals a good approximation performance. With increasing factor\ncorrelations the multi-factor model approaches the structure of a one-factor model for which\nEC and\nMFA\nEC coincide. In all cases EC is relatively close to\nMFA\nEC . Therefore, our\nearlier results concerning the good approximation performance of EC and\nMFA\nEC also hold\nunder different factor correlation assumptions.\nThirdly, we vary the value of the factor weight r from 0.2 to 0.8. There is a strong increase in\nEC with the factor weight but this does not affect the approximation quality, neither of EC\nnor of\nMFA\nEC .\nFourthly, we explore how the results depend on the number of factors. For this purpose we\nvary the number of factors from 2 to 16. Figure 2 shows how EC ,\nMFA\nEC and\nsim\nEC\ndepend on the number of sectors and the factor correlation.\nMFA\nEC is only plotted for 2\nsectors because its values are indistinguishable from\nsim\nFigure 2: Economic capital ( EC ,\nMFA\nEC and\nsim\nEC ) for different factor correlation values\nfor 2, 6 and 16 sectors (in percent of total exposure)\nFactor correlation\nEconomic capital (%\nEC_sim_2 Sec\nEC_sim_6 Sec\nEC MFA_2 Sec\nFor a given number of sectors, EC increases in Figure 2 with factor correlation as expected. If\nthe factor correlation approaches one, then EC values coincide, irrespective of the number of\nsectors. The reason is that in the limiting case of a factor correlation equal to one, the model\ncollapses to a single-factor model.\nFor a factor correlation of 0.6, which is also the average of the entries in the correlation matrix\nin Table 3, and also for higher factor correlations, the relative approximation error is below\nMFA\nEC and below 2% for EC . Therefore, the previous results showing a good\napproximation performance of EC and an even better one for\nMFA\nEC are found to be robust\nwith respect to the number of sectors, at least for realistic factor correlations.\nFigure 2 also shows that EC and\nsim\nEC generally decrease when the number of sectors\nincreases for given asset correlation values. This result can be explained by risk reduction\nthrough diversification across sectors.\nFifthly, we test whether our results for the approximation performance of EC and\nMFA\nEC\nare sensitive to PD heterogeneity on a sector level. For this purpose we employ the scaled\ndefault rates for sectors from Table 8.\nexposure-weighted expected average default rate of 2% for the benchmark portfolio;\nin percent)\nSector Unscaled default rate Scaled default rate\nSource: own calculation, based on S&P (2004)\nThe historical default rates in Table 8 are, on average, higher than the value of 2% which is\nused for the PDs in the case of homogeneous PDs for all sectors. In order to isolate the effect\nof PD heterogeneity between sectors, we scale the historical default rate, hist\ns\np , for every\nsector s as follows,\nscaled hist\ns s S\nhist\ns s\ns\np p\nw p\n=\n=\n\n\n.\nIn this way, we ensure that the weighted average PD of the benchmark portfolio stays at 2%\neven in the case of PD heterogeneity across sectors.\nThe results for\nsim\nEC and the two analytical approximations of EC, using the scaled historical\ndefault rates as PD estimates, are given in Table 9.\nTable 9: Comparison of EC ,\nMFA\nEC and\nsim\nEC (in percent of total exposure), based on\nsector-dependent default probabilities, estimated from historical default rates\nPortfolio EC\nMFA\nEC\nsim\nEC\nRelative error of\nMFA\nEC\nBenchmark\nportfolio\nFor all risk measures the results in Table 9 are relatively close to those in Table 6. The more\nconcentrated the exposures are in one sector, the smaller the difference to Table 6 becomes.\nThis is explained by the fact that the sector PDs are calibrated to an average value of 2%,\nwhich is also the PD used for Table 6. The approximation quality of EC and\nMFA\nEC is\nsimilar to Table 6. We conclude that, in qualitative terms, the results obtained for a uniform\nPD also hold for heterogeneous sector-dependent PDs.\n6. Evaluation of the EC approximations for sector-dependent PDs\nand low granularity\nSimulation results in the previous section, which reveal a reasonably good approximation\nquality for EC and\nMFA\nEC , were obtained conditional on a uniform PD in every sector and\nhighly granular portfolios. However, portfolios of small banks, in particular, are less granular.\nIn the following we explore the impact of lower granularity. From the set of seven portfolios,\nonly the benchmark portfolio and portfolio 6 are considered as they have the lowest and the\nhighest sector concentration. The impact of granularity is considered for the following two\ncases.\nIn the first case, characterized by a portfolio of representative granularity, the distribution of\nexposure size was selected from a sample of typical small, regional German banks to reflect an\naverage granularity in terms of the HHI. The purpose is to measure the impact of granularity\nfor an exposure distribution that is representative for real banks. However, since the exposure\ndistribution is based on central credit register data, only larger exposures are captured20 in the\nunderlying data set with the consequence that this exposure distribution is less granular than\nwhat we can expect for real bank portfolios. The HHI of the portfolio, measured on single-\nexposure level, is 0.0067 compared with an HHI of 0.001 for the highly granular portfolios\nused in the previous section. Descriptive statistics on exposure size of the new portfolio are\nshown in Table 16 in Appendix D. Unfortunately, the borrower-specific data on exposure size\ncontain no sector information.21 The allocation of exposures to sectors was achieved by\nrandomly drawing exposures from the data set under the constraint that the generated\ndistribution of exposures across sectors mirrors the sectoral distribution of the benchmark\nportfolio. To control for any sampling bias in the results we repeated this random assignment\nthereby creating several portfolios. These portfolios have the same sector distribution but vary\nin the distribution of individual exposure size in each sector. With these portfolios we verified\nthe robustness of the results in this and the following section.\n20 See section 3.1 for more information on the characteristics of exposures included in the German central credit\nregister.\n21 The reason for this missing information is that we do not use credit register data directly but a matched sample\nof credit register data and a second database which provides us also with individual borrower PDs not included\nin the credit register but required for the analysis of PD heterogeneity in section 7.\nIn the second case, characterized by low granularity, we consider the highest individual\nexposure shares that are admissible under the EU large exposure rules.22 In this way, we obtain\nan upper limit for the potential impact of granularity. According to the EU rules, an exposure\nis considered \"large\" if its amount requires 10% or more of regulatory capital. Banks are\ngenerally not allowed to have an exposure that requires at least 25% of regulatory capital.\nFurthermore, the sum of all large exposures must not require more than 8 times the regulatory\nWe assume that a bank's regulatory capital is 8% of its total loan volume. For a total portfolio\nvalue of 6,000 currency units, banks are required to hold 480 currency units in capital. Each\nlarge exposure requires a minimum amount of capital of 48 currency units and a maximum\namount of 120 currency units. The total sum of all large exposures must not exceed 3,840\ncurrency units. With these restrictions, the least granular admissible exposure distribution of\nour portfolio consists of\n\u00b7 a remaining single exposure of 45 currency units\nThe HHI of this portfolio, measured on a single-exposure level, is 0.015. Since this portfolio is\ncharaterized by relatively coarse granularity, its HHI is considerably higher than for the\nportfolio with representative granularity. While keeping the average sector concentration of\nthe portfolio constant, we increase the granularity of the portfolio to reflect the exposure size\ndistribution of this least granular portfolio. More details of this portfolio can be found in Table\nEconomic capital from simulations,\nsim\nEC , and the analytic proxies *\nEC and\nMFA\nEC are\nTable 10: Comparison of EC ,\nMFA\nEC and\nsim\nEC (in percent of total exposure ) for\nportfolios with representative and low granularity using sector-dependent default\nprobabilities\nPortfolio Granularity EC\nMFA\nEC\nsim\nEC\nRelative error of\nMFA\nEC\nBenchmark\nportfolio\nSingle sector\nportfolio\n22 See Directive 93/6/EEC of 15 March 1993 on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions.\n23 The last two restrictions may be breached with permission of the German Federal Financial Supervisory\nAuthority (BaFin), in which case the excess must be fully backed by capital.\nThe\nsim\nEC value of 9.3% for the low granular benchmark portfolio is 1.3 percentage points\n(or 14% in relative terms) higher than for the highly granular benchmark portfolio in Table 9.\nThis difference appears to be substantial, but we have to consider that the granularity of the\nportfolio in Table 10 is very low since it reflects the lowest granularity permissible under\nEuropean bank regulation.\nsim\nEC for the single sector portfolio 6 in Table 10 is higher than\nfor the benchmark portfolio, which is consistent with earlier reported results.\nThe\nsim\nEC value of 8.6% for the benchmark portfolio with representative granularity is\nrelatively close to the value of 9.3% for the portfolio with low granularity, at least if compared\nwith\nsim\nEC of 8.0% for the infinitely granular benchmark portfolio in Table 9. One reason is\nthat some exposures in the portfolio with representative granularity technically violate the\nlarge exposure rules.24 Therefore, as mentioned before, the portfolio of \"representative\"\ngranularity should still be regarded as conservative in terms of granularity.\nFor the purpose of this analysis, the approximation errors of the EC proxies, *\nEC and\nMFA\nEC ,\nare more important than the level of EC. Both EC proxies are based on the assumption of\ninfinite granularity in each sector, while the\nsim\nEC calculations take granularity into account.\nWe find that *\nEC and\nMFA\nEC can substantially underestimate EC by up to 14%, in particular\nfor portfolios with coarse granularity .\n7. Evaluation of EC approximations for heterogeneous sectors\nSo far we have only considered sector-dependent PDs, which means PD variation on a sector\nlevel, but not on the exposure level. In the following we explore the impact of heterogeneous\nPDs inside a sector together with the impact of granularity. For the benchmark portfolio of\nrepresentative granularity analyzed in the previous section, we also have individual borrower\nPDs which were computed from a logit model based on firms' accounting data. In order to\napply the logit model, borrower information from the central credit register on exposure size\nhad to be matched with a balance sheet database, also maintained by the Deutsche\nBundesbank.25 Using empirical data on exposure size and PD automatically captures a\npotential dependence between these two characteristics.\n24 This can be explained either by special BaFin approval or, most likely, by data limitations given that our credit\nregister data do not contain loans below 1.5 million. The latter implies that their sum is lower than the total\nportfolio exposure of the data-providing real bank and, therefore, our relative exposure weights are biased\nupwards. In other words, it is well possible that the large exposure limit is breached for our portfolio, although\nthe limit is still met by the data-providing bank.\n25 More details on the database and the logit model that was used to determine the PDs can be found in Kr\u00fcger et\nIn order to guarantee comparability with previous results, we apply the same scaling procedure\nas in Section 6 to ensure that the exposure-weighted average PD in each sector is the same as\nthe corresponding scaled default rate given inTable 8. Information on this PD distribution is\ngiven in Table 18, Appendix D.\nThe portfolio with the lowest granularity admissible under the EU large exposure rules is an\nartificially generated portfolio, so that we have no PD information for single exposures.\nTherefore, we randomly assign PDs from an empirical aggregate PD distribution based on the\nsame balance sheet database, but this time aggregated over a sample of banks. The empirical\nPD distribution is given in Table 20 and information on the PD distribution of the low granular\nportfolio is provided in Table 19, Appendix D.26\nThe results for PD heterogeneity in every sector are given in Table 11. The reduction of\nsim\nEC compared to Table 10, which occurs for both portfolios, is due to the PD heterogeneity\non the exposure level. This impact of PD heterogeneity has also been noted by Hanson et al\n(2005) and can be explained by the concavity of the dependence of EC on PD.\nTable 11: Comparison of EC ,\nMFA\nEC and\nsim\nEC for portfolios with heterogeneous sectors\n(in percent of total exposure)\nPortfolio Granularity EC\nMFA\nEC\nsim\nEC\nRelative error of\nMFA\nEC\nBenchmark\nportfolio\nSingle sector\nportfolio\nSince EC and\nMFA\nEC do not account for PD heterogeneity on the exposure level, these\nvalues stay unchanged from Table 10 while\nsim\nEC decreases. As a consequence, the\nunderestimation by using EC and\nMFA\nEC instead of\nsim\nEC is reduced relative to Table 10,\nor even reversed to an overestimation of EC. This is confirmed by the approximation error in\nthe last column of Table 11, which is lower when using heterogeneous PDs compared to the\ncase of sector-dependent PDs in Table 10.\nFor the single-sector portfolio and the benchmark portfolio with representative granularity, the\napproximation errors of the EC proxies are positive, implying that the effect of PD\nheterogeneity is stronger than the granularity effect, measured relative to the highly granular\nportfolio with homogeneous sector PDs. As a consequence, the EC proxies provide\nconservative estimates. Comparing the conservativeness of the single-factor portfolio and the\n26 Since a negative correlation between exposure size and PD emerged as a stylized fact in recent empirical\nliterature (See, for example, Dietsch and Petey (2002) or Lopez (2004)), we also considered the case that the\nPDs are perfectly ordered in terms of decreasing exposure size. We found that our results are robust in this case.\nbenchmark portfolio in Table 11, we observe that the degree of overestimation halves from\n+8% to +4%. This suggests further robustness checks, in particular for portfolios with a higher\nnumber of sectors.\nIn summary, the approximation errors for all portfolios considered vary between -6% and\n+8%. The results of Table 10 and Table 11 taken together demonstrate that the effect of PD\nheterogeneity counterbalances the effect of granularity. In general it is not possible to\ndetermine which of the two opposing effects dominates. For the portfolio with a representative\ngranularity in Table 11, the effect of granularity is arguably weaker, which suggests that for\nportfolios of \"average granularity\" in real banks, PD heterogeneity would tend to\novercompensate the granularity effect and EC and\nMFA\nEC would provide conservative\nestimates.\nFurther empirical work is warranted to confirm this indicative result.\nOur analysis has shown that PD heterogeneity on the exposure level improves the performance\nof the analytic EC approximations relative to the situation of a granular portfolio with (only)\nsector-dependent PDs. The reason is that PD heterogeneity reduces the underestimation of EC\nthat is caused by the granularity of the portfolio. This effect is even stronger if larger\nexposures or firms have lower PDs than smaller ones. Furthermore, PD heterogeneity appears\nnot to affect the relative difference between\nMFA\nEC and *\nEC .\n8. Summary and conclusions\nThe minimum capital requirements for credit risk in the IRB approach of Basel II implicitly\nassume that credit portfolios of banks are well diversified across business sectors. Potential\nconcentration risk in certain business sectors is covered by Pillar 2 of the Basel II Framework,\nwhich comprises the supervisory review process.27 To what extent the regulatory minimum\ncapital requirements can understate economic capital is an empirical question. In this paper we\nprovide a tentative answer by using data from the German central credit register. Credit risk is\nmeasured by economic capital in a multi-factor asset value model and determined by Monte\nCarlo simulations.\nIn order to measure the impact of concentration risk on economic capital, we start in the\nempirical part with a benchmark portfolio that reflects the aggregate exposure distribution\nacross sectors of the German banking system. Since the exposure distributions across business\nsectors are similar in Belgium, France and Spain, we expect that our main results also hold for\nother European countries. Starting with the benchmark portfolio, we have successively\nincreased sector concentration, considering degrees of sector concentration which are\nobservable in real banks. The most concentrated portfolio contained exposures only to a single\nsector. Compared with the benchmark portfolio, economic capital for the concentrated\nportfolios can increase by almost 37% and by 50% in the case of a one-sector portfolio. We\nhave subjected our results to various robustness checks. We find that the increase in economic\ncapital may be even greater, contingent on the dependence structure. This result clearly\nunderlines the necessity to take inter-sector dependency into account for the measurement of\ncredit risk.\nSince concentration in business sectors can substantially increase economic capital, a tractable\nand robust calculation method for economic capital which avoids the use of computationally\nburdensome Monte Carlo simulations is desirable. For this purpose the theoretical part\nevaluates the accuracy of a model developed by Pykhtin (2004), which provides an analytical\napproximation of economic capital in a multi-factor framework. We have applied a simplified,\nmore tractable version of the model which requires only sector-aggregates of exposure size,\nPD and expected loss severity. The dependence structure is captured by the correlation matrix\nof the original multi-factor model. Furthermore, we have evaluated the extent to which EC ,\nas the first of two components in the analytic approximation of economic capital, already\nprovides a reasonable proxy of economic capital. EC refers to the economic capital for a\nsingle-factor model in which the sector-dependent asset correlations are defined by mapping\nthe richer correlation structure of the multi-factor model. The benchmark for the\napproximation quality is always the economic capital figure of the original multi-factor model\nwhich is obtained from MC simulations.\nWe have shown that the analytic approximation formulae perform very well for portfolios\nwith highly granular and homogeneous sectors. This result holds for portfolios with different\nsector concentrations and for various factor weights and correlation assumptions. Furthermore,\nwe have found that EC is relatively close to the simulation-based economic capital for most\nof the realistic input parameter tupels considered.\nFinally, we explore the robustness of our results against the violation of two critical model\nassumptions, namely infinite granularity in every sector and sector-dependent PDs. We find\nthat coarser granularity and PD heterogeneity (on the single exposure level) have\ncounterbalancing effects on the performance of the analytic approximations for economic\ncapital. Coarser granularity induces the analytic approximation formulae to have a downward\nbias which increases to 14% in extreme cases of portfolios with the lowest granularity\npermissible by EU large exposure rules, depending on the sector structure of the portfolio.\nReplacing sector-dependent PDs by heterogeneous PDs on the individual exposure level\nreduces economic capital, but does not affect the analytic approximations. As a consequence,\nthe downward bias decreases. The relative error of the analytic approximation, measured\nrelative to the simulation-based economic capital figure, lies in a range between \u00ad6% and\n+8%, dependent on the exposure distribution across sectors and the number of factors. In\nsummary, we find that heterogeneity in individual PDs and low granularity partly balance each\nother in their impact on the performance of the analytic approximations. Which effect prevails\ndepends on the specific input parameters. Indicative results suggest that in representative\ncredit portfolios, PD heterogeneity will at least compensate for the granularity effect, which\nsuggests that the analytic formulae approximate economic capital reasonably well and err on\nthe conservative side.\nIn the cases studied, it is possible to use the analytic economic capital approximations of the\nsimplified Pykhtin model without sacrificing much accuracy. This is an important result as it\nsuggests, pending further robustness checks, that supervisors and banks can reasonably well\napproximate their economic capital for their credit portfolio by a relatively simple formula and\nwithout running computationally burdensome Monte Carlo simulations.\nFurther research seems to be warranted, particularly in further advancing Pykhtin's\nmethodology in a direction which improves its approximation accuracy while staying\nparsimonious in terms of data requirements. This could be achieved, for example, by exploring\nalternative ways to map the correlation matrix of the multi-factor model into sector-dependent\nasset correlations.\nReferences\nBCBS (2004a), Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, \"Bank Failures in Mature\nEconomies\", http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs_wp13.pdf\nBCBS (2004b), Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, \"International Convergence\nof Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A revised Framework\",\nhttp://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs107b.pdf.\nBLUHM, C., L.
