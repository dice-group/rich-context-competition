This expectation is\nparticularly prevalent during outbreaks of violent social\nunrest or any other situation that simulates the often latent\nis less familiarity with pain and suffering, debilitating dis-\nease and death, in developed countries, than ever before,\nfear has become an omnipresent part of everyday life. A\ncentral element of this culture is the inherent conviction\nthat humanity continually faces threats, which challenge\ndaily existence; consequently fear becomes an all-pervad-\ning force in the everyday life (Furedi, 2002). A culture of\nfear is driven by \"risk perceptions,\" as Furedi asserts \"fears\nabout the future are linked to anxieties about problems\nthrough shared cultural beliefs and political judgments\nSydneysiders risk perceptions escalated from the threat of\nfurther violence to terrorism. In an effort to restore social\norder, the government introduced legislative changes that\nincreased police powers; hence, the text messages used to\npromote and expedite the Cronulla riots became a target of\npolice surveillance. The general reactions to the policing\nof text messaging were crude links to the wide-ranging risk\nperceptions situated within a culture of fear. To provide a\ntheoretical framework for these risk perceptions, Anthony\nGidden's ontological security is explored to offer empiri-\ncal examples of the distinction between reality and possi-\nbility, which are the bases for all risk perceptions (Beck,\nargues in order to manage fear in a present or perceived\nthreat individuals are disposed to mediate any actual or\nperceived risks by bracketing out anxieties in order to\nmanage their everyday lives.\nBackground: The Cronulla riots\nTo understand the risk perceptions that existed during this\ntime, a background of the Cronulla riots is essential.\nCronulla Beach is situated on Sydney's south coast; it is the\nonly Sydney beach on the metropolitan railway system and\nis easily accessible by train or car from the Western sub-\nurbs.

Instead, the message is stored on the Short\nMessage Service Centre (SMSC), for days if necessary, until\nthe recipient turns the mobile phone on or moves into range,\nat which point the message is delivered (Hillebrand, 2002;\nTrosby, 2004).

The contribution of text messaging in EDSA,\nsimilar to the Cronulla riots, was its capacity to expedite the\narrangement of the masses (Goggin, 2006; Pertierra et al.,\n2002), which has posed various challenges to governments\nand authorities, particularly when used by large numbers of\npeople in unison.

Social scientists like Ulrich Beck\nhave been criticized for not embarking on an empirical inves-\ntigation of the reality of risk perception (Wilkinson, 2001a,\n2001b). Empirical data from risk perception research reveals\nit to be considerably more complex and obscure than Beck\nportrays in his seminal \"risk society\" thesis (Wilkinson,\n2001a, p. 5). There is evidence that the heightened anxieties\nof \"late twentieth-century society [are] . . . connected with\nthe extent that we are becoming more risk conscious\"\n(Wilkinson, 2001a, p. 5). Content analysis of Western news-\npapers in the 1990s found that the word \"risk\" was used as a\nsynonym for \"hazards,\" \"threats,\" and \"disasters\" (Lupton,\nmay have contributed to a risk conscious society, but it is\nmore likely an expression of anxiety than of risk conscious-\nness. However, Wilkinson (2001a) asserts it is debatable to\nconclude that `society is more anxious because it is more risk\nconscious' (p. 8).The anxious condition of individuals in\nmodern society has been interpreted as \"a product of the\nsocial conflicts and cultural contradictions which comprise\ntheir experience of day-to-day life\" (Wilkinson, 2001a, p. 9).\nTo provide a theoretical framework for these risk perceptions\nAnthony Giddens' notion of ontological security, the inner\nbalance between trust and anxiety will be explored.\nOntological security is a central but small component of\nsociality and modernity. In its broadest sense, ontological\nsecurity is \"the confidence that most human beings have in\nthe continuity of their self-identity and in the constancy of\nthe social and material environments of action\" (Giddens,\n1990, p. 92). Giddens defines security as resting between \"a\nbalance of trust and acceptable risk\" (1990, p. 36), with onto-\nlogical security being just one form of security, albeit a \"very\nemotional experience and situated within the unconscious,\nbut its source lies within a sense of \"being.\" Ontological\nsecurity, therefore, is \"an emotional inoculation which pro-\ntects against existential anxieties to which all humans are\npotentially subject\" (1990, p. 94). It must be understood pre-\ndominantly in the \"context of trust and forms of risk or dan-\nger,\" as it acts as an anxiety-controlling barrier (Giddens,\n\"defensive carapace\" or a \"protective cocoon\" that allows\nindividuals to detach themselves from risks or dangers, thus\n\"screening off\" anxieties associated with day-to-day life\nnegative possibilities in favor of \"a generalised feeling of\nhope that derives from basic trust.\" Basic trust is considered\nfoundational to ontological security, operating as a defensive\ncarapace to any thoughts that might cause distress (1991, p.\n40).

The aim was not to draw statistical\nconclusions; instead, the study intended to produce nuanced\nunderstandings of how people use text messaging to com-\nmunicate with their social networks in everyday life.\nExperience is central for studying and researching everyday\nlife (Pickering, 2008), although it is acknowledged that anal-\nysis of an individual's experience can be troublesome as it is\nnever pure or transparent. To balance this, three methodolog-\nical approaches were used: dialogic, deconstructive, and\ncontextual. This approach to empirical research lies in the\ninterplay between lived experience, discourses, and the\nsocial context, which are always representative of more than\none lived reality (Saukko 2003). The chosen method of data\ncollection was one-on-one interviews; prerequisites for\ninclusion in the sample were knowledge of how to send and\nreceive text messages, age between 18 and 40 years, and liv-\ning in Sydney. According to Silverman (2000), qualitative\nmethods like one-on-one interviews \"exemplify a common\nbelief that they can provide a deeper understanding of social\nphenomena that would be obtained from a purely quantita-\ntive data\" (p. 80). This particular form of data collection was\nselected to gain a \"thicker description\" and to bring to light\nthe many subtle contradictions of the sociocultural dimen-\nsions of everyday text messaging practices (Geertz, 1973).\nDuring a 5-month period, 17 women and 13 men (Table\n1) were recruited using two forms of nonprobability sam-\npling: convenience and snowballing. To keep the sample to a\nmanageable size, 30 one-on-one interviews were conducted\nusing an interview guide to stimulate conversation about\neach research participant's text messaging experiences, prac-\ntices, and opinions about the technology. The same topics\nwere raised in each interview, but as the interviews were\nbased on open-ended questions, their durations ranged\nThe interviews were transcribed and coded initially under\nfour broad categories: convenience, privacy, regulation, and\nsafety. In using the three methodological approaches--\ndialogic, deconstructive, and contextual--it is essential to be\naware of any bias through continual reflection, sensitivity\ntoward social contexts, and an awareness that social worlds\nare constantly shaped by the historical and political (Saukko,\n2003). After reflecting on this initial analysis, the interview\ntranscripts were re-coded to explore an extension of the orig-\ninal four categories as it became evident that the research\nparticipants' comments were shaped by wide-ranging social\nand cultural influences (Saukko, 2003), particularly when\ndiscussing text messaging and the Cronulla riots (see the\nappendix). When the conversation turned to this topic, there\nwas evidence of a balancing act between trust and anxiety in\nthe research participants' comments. This article is represen-\ntative of this aspect, specifically, the discussion and analysis\nof the research participants' responses to the recent changes\nin Australian law. This research was conducted between 12\nand 16 months after the Cronulla riots; however, the social\ncontext was still a fresh memory for the research partici-\npants. In each interview, an explanation was given regarding\nthe new amendments to NSW State and Commonwealth law.\nThe NSW Law Enforcement Legislation (Public Safety) Act\nwere made to the Telecommunication (Interception and\ninterviews, participants were asked for their opinions on the\namendments to State and Commonwealth laws and the polic-\ning of text messaging. In the following sections, the research\nparticipants' responses and comments are analyzed using the\ntheoretical framework of ontological security to enrich an\nunderstanding of risk perceptions in a climate of fear and\nuncertainty. As Michael Pickering (2008) argues, theory pro-\nvides an understanding of how social worlds are configured,\nbut unless these experiences are explored, there are no\ninsights into the lived and living landscapes to which the\ntheory relates.\n\"It Is Absolutely a Good Thing\":\nPolicing Text Messages\nIn all the interviews, the topic of the text messaging system\nwas discussed.

A few participants openly expressed dis-\ncomfort in thinking about the new laws or any form of poten-\ntial monitoring. The most extreme example was Dave, who\nchose to completely disengage by asking \"Can we go to the\nnext question please?\" Disengaging from the discussion or\nfrom even thinking about an issue is an overt form of \"brack-\neting out\" anything that is the cause of uneasiness. A more\nsubtle form of bracketing was seen in pragmatic rationales,\none example of which was Olivia's response:\nYes [pause] I don't really think about it too much, I mean I don't\nput really private information in there but obviously people\ndon't delve into your business or your own private affairs.\nIn using text messaging for daily communications,\nOlivia does not think \"too much\" about her service provider\nhaving access to her text messages, but at the same time,\nshe does not put \"private information\" in text messages.\nThis daily practice suggests that she is conscious of the pos-\nsibility of surveillance. Olivia's comment evidences a\n\"defensive carapace,\" in trying not to think about surveil-\nlance practices as well as in her conviction that information\nabout her private life remains uncompromised. Her stance\nof \"invulnerability\" blocks any negative possibilities, in\nfavor of a generalized attitude that derives from \"basic\ntrust,\" the foundation to ontological security (Giddens,\n\"Basic trust\" operates as a defensive carapace; thus, if any\nthoughts disrupt a sense of stability, barriers are set in place.\nIn the research, participants' matter-of-fact responses to the\nknowledge that telecommunication companies have access\nto text messages revealed this demarcation.\nJohn: I don't mind because they are not going to check my\nmessages, I think, I hope, because they have so many customers.\nI mean they may pick people randomly but because I do statistics\nI know the chance of them picking me is very small.\nSo what about word searches?\nJohn: I don't know.\nJohn relies upon his knowledge of statistics that gives his\nrationale a groundedness, but the thought of computerized\nword searches is dismissed with a simple reply of \"I don't\nknow\" to end the conversation. To manage day-to-day life,\nindividuals' main emotional support is a \"defensive cara-\npace\": Feelings of security rely firmly upon \"basic trust\" that\nfunctions by \"screening off\" any \"risks or dangers in the sur-\nrounding settings of action and interaction\" (Giddens, 1991,\npp. 39-40). Here, John achieves stability in the surrounding\nsocial and material environment by actively placing a defen-\nsive carapace against certain thoughts (Giddens, 1991). In\ngeneral, the participants' uneasiness in thinking about the\nnew surveillance measures was shown in their simple dis-\nmissal or rationalization of the measures as applying only to\nterrorists or other criminals. The demarcation therefore is the\ndistancing of self from the any form of surveillance.\nBeing \"at risk\"\nis subject to a variety of influences . . . social and cultural climate\n[being one] . . . many panics or overreactions . . . provide\ninteresting insights to how society makes sense of itself. Such\nreactions can only be understood in relation to the wider social\nIn this social context, the violence at Cronulla and the\nway it was organized using a number of communication\nmediums (although text messages were the focus of most\nmedia reports) meant that people felt safer knowing that text\nmessaging was being policed.\nSylvia: I think that it is a good thing. If they can do anything to\nstop the violence, if it helps people stay out of trouble, then I\nthink that it is absolutely a good thing.\nSylvia's comment was a response to the \"stop and search\"\nsurveillance technique used after the Cronulla riots. The\nNSW State Police action of randomly searching people's\nmobile phones was an effort to discipline the wayward text\nmessaging practices after the riots. Sylvia's opinion that this\nwas \"absolutely a good thing\" denotes her belief that this\nform of policing would somehow make everyone safer. Her\nrepetitive statement \"that is a good thing . . . that is absolutely\na good thing\" suggests that the policing of text messages\nappeases her anxiety about further violence. The salient\naspect of Sylvia's comment is not so much fear or insecurity\nabout further rioting but her conservative attitude. It is noted\nthat often analysis of risk \"does not make a connection\nbetween the preoccupation with safety and the impulse of\nconservatism [as a consequence] safety and the attitude of\ncaution are treated as inherently positive principles\" (Furedi,\nIn a period of uncertainty, people fear any form of risk\n(Furedi, 2002), and chain text messages were seen as putting\npeople at risk. As outlined, young men \"of Middle Eastern\nappearance\" were linked to a range of threats, terrorism\nbeing one of those. This had a cumulative effect of increas-\ning the imagined risk and threatening stability and certainty\n(Arvanitakis, 2008). Safety was a prime consideration for the\nresearch participants when discussing the Cronulla riots and\nthe formal surveillance measures.\nWill: I don't mind it. Obviously with the Cronulla riots, the text\nmessages going round didn't really help anything. So I guess, if\nthey were able to track who, I don't know, the organisers or\nwhatever, through text messaging I was quite happy about that.\nWill's comment shows satisfaction with this form of sur-\nveillance, relating not only to the policing of text messages\nbut also to the knowledge that they could be traced and used\nas evidence. His expression \"quite happy\" denotes a curt\nemotional experience. It can also be likened to an affective\nstate, a feeling of being happy because the materiality of text\nmessaging allows it be used as a trace. This particular use of\ntext messages by police could promote stability and coher-\nence, a settled feeling that contrasts with the occasional\nchaos in social worlds. As Giddens asserts, ontological secu-\nrity is \"an emotional inoculation which protects against exis-\ntential anxieties\" (1990, p. 94). According to these research\nparticipants, the policing measures appeased anxieties about\npublic safety by seemingly assuring a broader sense of secu-\nrity and certainty.\n\"Yeah, Anything to Stop Terrorism\":\nMapping Risk Perceptions\nThe surveillance measures sanctioned through the\nTelecommunication (Interception and Access) Act prompted\nmany of the research participants to link this form of policing\nwith terrorism or other criminal activities. Some participants\nused the words terrorist, terrorism, or terrorist activities to\nexplain why these surveillance measures were necessary. In\ntheir responses, a process of \"bracketing\" was evident, as\nsome participants were convinced that the amendments to\nthe law would have no impact on them but instead would\nallow monitoring of illegal activities. John's comment here\nevidences his \"defensive carapace\" as he expresses a sense\nof disbelief that anyone would scrutinize his text messages:\nJohn: I am not a terrorist so who would be interested in any of\nthe messages that I send?\nThe \"invulnerability\" expressed in this comment is like a\nprotective cocoon rather than a firm conviction of security; it\nis a defense against any possibility that could threaten or\ncause discomfort. John's differentiation allows him to\n\"bracket out a host of actual and potential happenings\"\nsuspicion by concluding that formal surveillance would tar-\nget only terrorists, John, like many of the participants,\nequates access and interception of text messages exclusively\nwith terrorist or other criminal activities.\nChantal: I knew that it was something that they could do but it is\nnot something that I consider because most of my texts are\npretty mundane. It is not like I am organizing terrorist activities.\nTo maintain a sense of security and stability in individuals\nor surrounding environments, a certain level of positiveness\nis required (Giddens, 1991). This is seen in Chantal's com-\nment as she makes a joke about her text messages being\nmonitored. In his analysis of \"adaptive reactions\" to risk,\nGiddens (1990) analyzes, \"pragmatic acceptance\" which\ninvolves not withdrawal from the outside world but \"prag-\nmatic participation\" that focuses on day-to-day difficulties\nin the law and the actions of the authorities that sustains the\nnotion that any form of policing text messages functions to\nsafeguard against terrorist activities. This was the dominant\nposition taken by the research participants.\nA sense of being at risk, according to Furedi, \"has become\na permanent condition that exists separately from any par-\nticular problem\" (2002, p. 5). Risk is often discussed and\nreferenced in \"sweeping terms\" which transforms the notion\ninto an independent and ubiquitous force, ultimately convert-\ning any human experience into a \"safety situation\" (Furedi,\n2002, p. 5). When discussing Cronulla and new regulations\nfor text messaging, the participants in this study produced a\nspectrum of different interpretations of how text messaging\nwas a threat to public safety. The consensus in their responses\nwas that risks existed in the form of terrorism or other crimi-\nnal activities, bullying or other forms of harassment, and thus\nopen surveillance was deemed necessary. In Wilkinson's\nanalysis of risk perception, he states that people may express\na pessimistic view about risks in society, but the majority of\npeople will not relate it to their own lives (2001a). In the\nparticipants' responses, this was mostly the case. This accep-\ntance of the new surveillance laws by the participants is an\nexpression of ontological security as they bracket off any\npotential threat to their safety, not only through basic trust\nbut also by applying the risks to others. For example, during\nCameron's interview, the Cronulla riots and how the police\nused the \"stop and search\" technique to check people's\nmobile phones for \"messages that incited violence\" were dis-\ncussed, and he said:\nCameron: I think that is good. Yeah anything to stop terrorism\nand rioting or acts of violence is good.\nSo you wouldn't care if the police said that they wanted to check\nyour phone?\nCameron: Yeah I would care because I haven't done anything\nwrong. I would find it an invasion of privacy but I think that it\nis good that they can and I wish that they would go through\nmore . . . messages . . . anything that will stop acts of violence.\nIn the context of Cronulla riots, this police action seemed\na necessary safety measure to Cameron, but when asked\nabout his response to the police potentially checking his\nmobile phone, his position changed. Wilkinson (2001a)\nargues that risk perception can be so abstract that people\noften dissociate themselves from the process. Thus, Cameron\nfinds it an \"invasion of privacy\" but also believes it is \"good\"\nthat police can monitor text messaging practices. In this case,\nCameron relates the risk of an invasion of privacy to others\nwho used text messages to incite violence but not to himself.\nWithin the wide spectrum of diversity in participants' com-\nments, this was the only other dominant agreement, namely,\nthat text messages are a record of a dialogue and could there-\nfore be used as evidence that a conversation or an event took\n8 SAGE Open\nplace, but this accountability attached to text messaging\ncommunications was not necessarily connected to their\neveryday lives.\nAwareness of the potential use of text messages as a form\nof evidence reveals the participants' internalization of the\ntraceability of this digitally written discourse. There is a\nsense of safety in knowing that text messages are monitored\nand an innate belief that such monitoring will always be used\nfor the common good.\nMichelle: If there was a criminal case and you could prove\nsomething through a text message then [long pause] yeah gosh I\nguess at the moment it feels really safe . . . but if that started to\nchange and there were cases of people being violated or some\nkind of abuse . . . If that was to happen then yes I think, like in\ncases of abuse, harassment . . . like when relationships have\ngone into that really bad space like when one of the partners is\nconstantly texting or if there have been threats or if it is used for\nany sort of racist things or at schools with bullying.\nMichelle contextualizes her response to the new laws\nthrough potential cases of abuse or harassment, demonstrat-\ning a positive stance about the surveillance of text messages.\nIn Giddens' lexicon, this position would amount to \"prag-\nmatic acceptance\" as it seemingly relieves the burden of\nsituation that \"at the moment it feels really safe,\" but in her\ndescription of the potential danger of text messages, she is\narticulating anxieties as well as appeasing them with the\nthought that the text can be used to \"prove something.\"\nCorrespondingly, Olivia advocates open surveillance when\ndiscussing the policing of text messaging:\nOlivia: Yeah, just because there are so many threats now, it has to\nbe open. The same as phone tapping and all of that . . . [there is]\na point where it does need to be something that people can trace.\nOlivia's comment speaks to one of Furedi's (2002) central\narguments \"that the perception of being at risk expresses a per-\nvasive mood in society [which] influences action\" (2002,\np. 20). Furedi describes a \"free-floating\" risk consciousness\nthat is attached to everyday experiences, which combats a\npotential threat with a safety measure (2002, p. 20). Olivia's\nbelief that \"there are so many threats now\" and her assertion\nthat there needs to be a \"trace\" of conversations links the vio-\nlence at Cronulla with the notion of formal surveillance in the\ninterest of public safety. A \"generalised climate of risk,\"\nGiddens asserts, becomes \"a source of unspecific anxieties\"\nment for the acceptance of increased surveillance measures.\n\"I've Got Nothing to Hide\": Safety in\nSurveillance\nOne of the most common responses to idea of formal surveil-\nlance of text messages was the attitude--\"I've got nothing to\nhide.\" This is not a unique finding; other studies on changes\nto privacy laws have reported a similar rhetoric (Solove,\n2007). \"I've got nothing to hide\" is a defensive carapace\nbased on the proposal that if you have nothing to hide, you\nwould have no problem with formal surveillance measures.\nA few participants used the exact phrase \"I've got nothing to\nhide,\" and other participants' comments complemented this\nstance by arguing that the surveillance measures concerned\nonly criminals or terrorists. The significance of this position\nis that it denotes the fusion between anxieties and the partici-\npants' expressions of ontological security in an environment\na synthesis of this:\nSusanne: I have no problems with it because I have nothing to\nhide and I think in the [Cronulla] situation that was absolutely\nright. I think that it is the same as anything isn't it, like if the\npolice want to pull you over and search your vehicle then they\nhave every right to do that and so they should. It's in the interest\nof public safety. So yeah I don't have any problems with that, I\nthink that it is more than appropriate in this day and age.\nFuredi argues that fear dominates public life; he asserts\nthat \"we have become very good at scaring one another and\nbeing scared\" (2005, p. 1). Policing text messages, according\nto Susanne, is \"more than appropriate in this day and age,\"\nand her comment suggests that society is unsafe in compari-\nson with the past. Susanne's comment indicates that she has\ninternalized a fear about potentially being unsafe, thus she\nsupports the formal surveillance of text messages, arguing\nthat it is \"in the interest of public safety.\" In this approach,\nshe simultaneously expresses anxiety about not being safe\nand assurance that these laws do not apply to her because she\nhas \"nothing to hide.\" In justifying the recent change in the\nlaw, Susanne likens the formal surveillance of text messages\nto the \"stop and search\" technique of other personal posses-\nsions. Morgan also relies on this claim to validate the exten-\nsion of police powers:\nMorgan: I guess [it's] the same as having a search warrant, to\nsearch the house, and to search someone's belongings. I think\nit's ok. I've got nothing to hide.\nEquating the formal surveillance measures of text mes-\nsaging to other surveillance techniques provides a sense of\nfamiliarity and security. Morgan's \"natural attitude,\" \"I've\ngot nothing to hide,\" also indicates that she believes these\nchanges to legislation do not apply to her. Solove (2007)\ncites a range of rhetoric associated with the \"I have nothing\nto hide\" argument, one of the most compelling is underlying\nthis phrase an individualized attitude \"I don't care what hap-\npens so long as it doesn't happen to me\" (p. 751). Susanne's\nand Morgan's approach to surveillance is similar to Mirko\nBagaric's argument that \"if you have done nothing wrong,\nyou have nothing to fear . . . Privacy is often no more than\ncode for the `rights to secrecy,' which is destructive of an\nto hide argument\" essentially rests within the rationale that\n\"there is no threat to privacy unless the government uncovers\nunlawful activity, in which case a person has no legitimate\njustification to claim that it remain private\" (Solove, 2007, p.\n745). While this argument, its history, and critique extend\nbeyond the boundaries of this article, it highlights the balanc-\ning of \"risks.\" Being safe, the feeling of being safe, trumps\nany threat to privacy. Balancing trust and anxiety requires the\nresearch participants to have confidence the new surveil-\nlance laws, while creating a barrier between them and the\nimplementation of any surveillance techniques. Cameron\nstates a comparable position:\nCameron: Oh yeah it is an invasion of privacy but if they want\nto be that pathetic and read the messages that I am sending then\n[laughs] I think the only time that you would be concerned is\nthat if you are doing something dodgy. I don't do anything\ndodgy . . . so it doesn't really worry me.\nA crucial part of maintaining ontological security is reli-\nance on deflecting any potential risks by adopting an outlook\nof \"what could go wrong?\" thereby pushing any doubts out of\nvacy being jeopardized through formal surveillance of text\nmessages but simultaneously claims that the likelihood of\nsome authority going through his text messages is minimal.\nHe laughs while making this comment, using humor to ratio-\nnalize how people would only need privacy if they were doing\nsomething unlawful. While saying this Cameron describes any\npotential interest in his text messages as \"pathetic\"; this is\nanother form of a defensive carapace against any thoughts that\nConclusion\nThis article argued to manage fear in a present or perceived\nthreat individuals are disposed to mediate any actual or per-\nceived risks by bracketing out anxieties to manage their\neveryday lives. The empirical analysis provided an under-\nstanding of the complex, and sometimes contradictory, bal-\nance between trust and anxiety. The research participants'\nreactions to the policing of text messages revealed how they\neither bracket out anything that is the cause of uneasiness by\noffering pragmatic or matter-of-fact responses as a defensive\npolitical processes, such as the ever-expanding forms of sur-\nveillance and how that facilitates accountability for all digi-\ntal discourse, highlights the approach of a predominantly\nanxious society. Equally, the generalized attitude of accep-\ntance derives from \"basic trust\" which is the foundation of\ngagement and acceptance could be considered as binary\nopposites, both display the spectrum of an emotional\nresponse to any perceived risk.\nOpening up communication possibilities through text\nmessaging has produced another form of surveillance as this\nstore-forward service leaves traces of conversations on all\nthe technological devices the message encounters. The\nresearch participants in this study did not show concern\nabout the surveillance of their words nor the extension of the\nlaw enforcement legislation to include mobile phones. In\nfact, the trust they placed in the authorities balanced any\nanxieties about further threats to public safety. The policing\nof text messages was linked by many of the research partici-\npants' to terrorism, thus the expansion of surveillance was\nrationalized as a necessary safety measure. Risk perceptions\nare often contradictory; as Wilkinson (2001a) argues, many\npeople express a pessimistic view about risks in society, but\nthe majority of people will not relate it to their own lives.\nThis was the case in this study as the research participants\nagain produced a range of \"adaptive reactions to risk\"\ntiveness and a reliance upon the discourse \"I have nothing to\nhide,\" which is commonly attached to privacy and surveil-\nlance debates.\nA sense of being at risk is subject to a variety of social\ninfluences the social and cultural climate being one (Furedi,\n2002) accordingly the timing of this research is significant as\nit was only 12 to 16 months after the Cronulla riots. The\nresearch participants' comments indicate that concerns for\npublic safety were paramount and the empirical analysis\ndemonstrated how various expressions of ontological secu-\nrity act as an anxiety-controlling barrier (Giddens, 1990).\nWhile this article presented an empirical based study that\naddressed a gap in mobile communication literature by\nexploring the relationship between risk perceptions, onto-\nlogical security, and text messaging, future research could\ninvestigate gender and risk perceptions, understandings of\nprivacy in relation to text messaging and the public and pri-\nvate dimensions in mobile communication technologies con-\nsidering this research outlines the impact text messaging has\non notions of surveillance and public space.\nAppendix\nInterview Questions\nSample text messages were requested at the beginning of the\ninterview, including three sent and three received messages\nand the contents were discussed in the interview.\n1.
