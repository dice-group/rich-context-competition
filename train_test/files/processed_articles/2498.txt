Smoking behaviors were assessed 6 months\nlater (April\u00adSeptember 2007). We assessed associations between demographics and receiving tobacco direct mail materials at\nbaseline and the association of receiving these materials with smoking behaviors at follow-up, stratified by baseline smoking status.\nResults: Overall, 5.2% of nonsmokers and 23.9% of current smokers in our sample received tobacco direct mail materials\nduring the past 6 months (2.6% and 17.1% among nonsmokers and smokers <18 years old, respectively; p < .05). Participants\nwho were older and living with smokers were more likely to receive these materials (p < .05). Baseline nonsmokers who\nreceived these materials smoked more cigarettes during the previous 30 days at follow-up (p < .05); baseline current smokers\nwho received these materials were less likely than those who did not to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked during the past\nConclusions: Those younger than 18 years old (particularly smokers) in addition to older individuals in our regional sample were\nexposed to tobacco direct mail marketing. Exposure to this market strategy is associated with faster escalation of cigarette consump-\ntion among nonsmokers and lower likelihood of smoking reduction among smokers in this adolescent and young adult sample.\nIntroduction\nTobacco use remains an important public health issue in ado-\nlescents and young adults: 19.5% of 9th\u00ad12th graders reported\nof Health and Human Services, 2012). Tobacco marketing has\nbeen shown to be associated with adolescent smoking and adult\ncigarette consumption (Biener & Siegel, 2000; National Cancer\nInstitute, 2008). Direct mail marketing is one of the advertis-\ning strategies used by the tobacco companies. Since the 1998\nMaster Settlement Agreement restricted tobacco companies'\nability to advertise their products in major media channels (e.g.,\nnewspaper, magazines, billboards), direct mail has been the only\nmedia channel that showed an increase in cigarette advertising\nexpenditure. According to the Federal Trade Commission, the\nexpenditures on cigarette direct mail marketing increased from\nfor coupon redemption or gifts included in the mail) (Federal\nTrade Commission, 2013; Lewis, Yulis, Delnevo, & Hrywna,\n2004). Receiving tobacco direct mail materials (e.g., coupons,\nadvertisements, etc.) could have an impact on adolescents' and\nyoung adults' smoking behaviors. For example, direct mail\ncoupons can induce experimentation with smoking among non-\nsmokers and shape repeated purchase behavior among current\nsmokers (Rothschild & Gaidis, 1981). Given that 99% of smok-\ners initiate smoking and become daily smokers before the age\nit is important to examine the influence of tobacco direct mail\nmarketing in adolescents and young adults.\nLittle is known about prevalence and characteristics of ado-\nlescents and young adults who receive tobacco direct mail mate-\nrials. One study found that 4.9% of 12- to 17-year-olds reported\never receiving direct mail materials from tobacco companies,\nNicotine & Tobacco Research\nand ever receiving these materials was associated with current\nsmoking (Altman, Levine, Coeytaux, Slade, & Jaffe, 1996). The\nproportion of adolescents currently receiving tobacco direct\nmail materials is unknown. Another study showed that 15.2%\nof young adults (aged 18\u00ad24) reported receiving tobacco direct\nmail materials in the past 6 months but did not report charac-\nteristics of young adults who received these materials. (Lewis,\nDelnevo, & Slade, 2004). The prospective effect of receiving\ntobacco direct mail materials on subsequent smoking behav-\niors among adolescents and young adults has not been previ-\nously examined. We used longitudinal data from the Minnesota\nAdolescent Community Cohort (MACC) study to examine\ncharacteristics associated with receipt of tobacco direct mail\nmaterials and its influence on subsequent smoking behaviors\namong adolescent and young adult nonsmokers and smokers.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nThe MACC study is a population-based prospective cohort\nstudy designed to further the understanding of the transitional\nprocess from nonsmoking to smoking during adolescence and\nto assess the effect of state- and local-level tobacco preven-\ntion and control programs on adolescents and young adults in\nMinnesota. The design of the study has been detailed elsewhere\n(Forster, Chen, Perry, Oswald, & Willmorth, 2011). Briefly,\n60 randomly selected Minnesota geopolitical units (GPUs) and\n5 GPUs from four comparison states (North and South Dakota,\nMichigan, and Kansas). Clearwater Research, Inc. used modi-\nfied random digit dialing and a combination of probability and\nquota sampling methods to achieve an even distribution of ado-\nOf the eligible households, 3,636 participants in Minnesota\nand 605 participants in comparison states were recruited\n58.3%, respectively). An additional cohort of 585 twelve-year-\nolds in Minnesota from the 60 previously randomly selected\nMinnesota GPUs was sampled and recruited using the same\nParticipants were surveyed periodically through 2011 using\ncomputer-assisted telephone interviews. In this analysis, we\nincluded participants who completed round 13 data collec-\ntion (baseline for this analysis, conducted between October\noriginal cohort; 81.9% of those eligible for round 13 survey).\nOf these participants, 3,126 also completed round 14 data col-\nlection (follow-up for this analysis, conducted between April\nwere lost to follow-up were more likely to be from racial/ethnic\nminority groups, have lower education, and be heavier smok-\ners (p < .01). We included participants residing in other states\nas well as Minnesota in the analysis because they did not dif-\nfer in the prevalence of receiving tobacco direct mail materials\n(p = .68). The University of Minnesota Institutional Review\nBoard approved this study. Participants (and their guardians\nif less than age 18) provided consent before completing the\ninterviews, and monetary incentives ($10 for those aged 17 or\nunder, $15 for those aged 18 or older) were provided.\nMeasures\nParticipants were asked at baseline if they had received an\nadvertisement, a gift, or a coupon in the mail from a tobacco\ncompany in the past 6 months (yes/no). We assessed partici-\npants' age, gender, race/ethnicity, and education at baseline,\nand participants reported whether they lived with a smoker and\nwhether they had friends who smoke. Participants were asked\nthe number of days they smoked in the past 30 days and num-\nber of cigarettes smoked on the days they smoked in the past\n30 days both at baseline and follow-up. Those who reported\nsmoking at least 1 day in the past 30 days at baseline were\nclassified as current smokers, and those who did not smoke\nin the past 30 days at baseline were classified as nonsmok-\ners. Baseline current smokers were further dichotomized into\nwhether they smoked >15 days in the past 30 days (yes/no). We\nderived the number of packs of cigarettes smoked in the past\n30 days at baseline and follow-up by multiplying the number\nof days smoked in the past 30 days and number of cigarettes\nsmoked on the days they smoked and divided the product by\n20. Among baseline smokers, we subtracted the number of\npacks of cigarettes smoked in the past 30 days at baseline from\nthat at follow-up. Participants with a negative difference were\nclassified as having reduced the number of packs of cigarettes\nsmoked in the past 30 days at follow-up.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe assessed the characteristics associated with receiving\ntobacco direct mail materials at baseline by including age,\ngender, race/ethnicity, education, living with a smoker, having\nfriends who smoke, and \"smoked more than 15 days in the past\n30 days\" among baseline current smokers in logistic regres-\nsion models, stratified by baseline smoking status (nonsmokers\nvs. current smokers). To investigate the influence of receiving\ntobacco direct mail materials on progression of smoking behav-\nior among nonsmokers, we assessed the association between\nreceiving tobacco direct mail at baseline and the number of\npacks of cigarettes smoked in the past 30 days at follow-up\nusing linear regression models, adjusting for age, gender, race/\nethnicity, education, living with a smoker, and having friends\nwho smoke. Among baseline current smokers, we assessed the\nassociations between receiving tobacco direct mail materials\nat baseline and reduced number of packs of cigarettes smoked\nin the past 30 days at follow-up using logistic regression mod-\nels, adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, living\nwith a smoker, having friends who smoke and whether the\nparticipants smoked >15 days in the past 30 days at baseline.\nClustering by GPU was controlled for through specifying GPU\nas a random effect.

We found that, overall, about 1 out of\n20 nonsmoking and 1 out of 4 current smoking adolescents and\nyoung adults in our regional sample reported receiving tobacco\ndirect mail materials in the previous 6 months. Most concern-\ning is that about 5% of adolescents (regardless of their smoking\nstatus) reported receiving these materials in the past 6 months.\nAlthough it is possible that the materials were sent to the adult\nfamily members in the household, the fact that these adoles-\ncents remembered seeing them indicated they were exposed\nto this marketing strategy. Tobacco companies claim that they\nlimit their direct mail marketing to those 21 years old or above\n(Philip Morris USA, 2012). However, we found that many of\nthose under 21 years reported receiving these materials: 4%\nof nonsmokers and 21% of current smokers. Although it is\npossible that these participants used older adults' identities to\nregister for tobacco direct mail marketing, our data suggested\nthat the Master Settlement Agreement and tobacco companies'\nTable 1.

Overall, the propor-\ntion of young adult participants who receive tobacco direct\nmail materials in our sample is higher than a previous report\nMale nonsmokers and less educated smokers were more\nlikely to report receiving direct mail materials from the tobacco\ncompanies, suggesting that tobacco companies may be target-\ning these subpopulations. The association between education\nand receiving tobacco direct mail materials may partly explain\nthe tobacco use disparity for adolescents and young adults of\nlower socioeconomic status (U.S. Department of Health and\nTo our knowledge, this is the first prospective analysis of the\ninfluence of receiving tobacco direct mail materials on subse-\nquent smoking behaviors.We found that having received tobacco\ndirect mail materials at baseline was associated with higher\ncigarette consumption at follow-up among baseline adolescent\nand young adult nonsmokers and lower likelihood of smoking\nreduction at follow-up among baseline adolescent and young\nadult smokers. This can be partly explained by the fact that 87%\nof tobacco direct mail materials collected between July 2011 and\nJune 2012 by the Association for Nonsmokers\u00adMinnesota con-\ntains coupons for tobacco products (Brock & Moilanen, 2012).\nAs posited by marketing theory (Rothschild & Gaidis, 1981),\nproviding coupons can induce purchase among first-time users\nand consolidate repeated purchasing behavior among current\nusers. If this is true, policy interventions to eliminate tobacco\ncoupons may be effective in reducing the influence of tobacco\ndirect mail marketing on adolescents and young adults.\nOne limitation of the study is that attrition may introduce\nbias in our estimates. Given those who were lost to follow-\nup were more likely to be smokers, which is associated with\nreceiving tobacco direct mail materials, we may have underes-\ntimated the prevalence of receiving these materials. However,\nbecause we adjusted for variables associated with dropping out\nfrom the study in the regression models, our estimates from the\nregression models should not be severely biased. Our regional\nand predominantly non-Hispanic White sample (reflective of\nthe upper Midwest population) also limits the generalizabil-\nity of our findings to regions of greater racial/ethnic diversity.\nDespite these limitations, our findings suggest that the Master\nSettlement Agreement and self-regulation by the tobacco\nindustry have not been effective in protecting adolescents and\nyoung adults from tobacco direct mail marketing. Better sur-\nveillance of this marketing strategy is necessary to confirm our\nfindings and to determine if policy interventions are warranted.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by the National Cancer Institute at\nInvestigator).\nDeclaration of Interests\nNone declared.\nReferences\nAltman, D.
