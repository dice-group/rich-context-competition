    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe written autobiographical accounts of three life-course offenders, which were published following extended life-course\noffending, were analyzed using a theory-led thematic analysis. The protagonists were each responsible for a broad range of\nacquisitive and violent crimes, although different offense types are often studied as separate entities. The utility of narrative\ntheory was explored as a life-course theory by contrasting its framework with these disparate areas of inquiry, along the\ndevelopmental trajectory of the protagonist's account. Findings showed that onset began with trait-driven and versatile\noffending, which progressed toward specialization, incorporating modus operandi and rational choice making. Specialization\nwas underpinned by themes of violence and control. The concluding themes dealt with the process of desistance, which\nwas facilitated by a series of cognitive shifts, allowing these offenders to retain a core element of the \"self.\" Results further\nshowed that narrative-identity played an influential role in the development of specialization and eventual desistance, but less\nso with onset. Narrative theory has the potential to aid understanding of the criminal life-course trajectory, which in turn\ncan assist in both detection and rehabilitation processes.\n",

As life-\ncourse offenders are by definition repeat offenders (Halliday,\n2001), many also go through periods of \"versatility\" before\n\"specialising\" in particular offense types (Farrington, Synder,\nmeans different offense types, such as dishonesty, vandal-\nism, and violence, and can be clustered around certain age\ngroups (Soothill, Francis, & Fligelstone, 2002). Complexity\narises because these different offense types are typically\nstudied independently and also underpinned by different\nmodels such as \"trait-driven\" or \"dispositions\" toward\naggression and impulsivity, or rational choice making mod-\nels. Collectively, the field represents a number of disparate\nareas of inquiry.\nA theoretical framework that assists in linking these dis-\nparate areas may have potential for developing an increased\nunderstanding of life-course offenders and aid in the devel-\nopment of detection, prevention, and desistance work. Life-\ncourse offenders are viewed as being responsible for the\nlargest portion of recorded offenses (Halliday, 2001; Tarling,\nobserved that criminals' accounts of crime commission take\na narrative form; so, taken together, there is utility in explor-\ning narrative theory for this genre of offender.\nNarratives are about bringing order and coherence to a\nprotagonist's life so that both sense and meaning can be\nmade of it (McAdams, 1996). Working with notions of\ncoherence and meaning can shed light on what guides life-\ncourse offenders to make decisions about the type of offenses\nthat they engage with and how they manage their way out of\nthe offending cycle.\nMaruna (2001) applied narrative scripts to explore both\ndesistance and persistence in offending. Although\nMaruna'sfindings are yet to be \"replicated\" (Presser, 2009),\nlack important definitions to key terms such as \"script\" and\nthe epistemological orientation of the approach (Hockey,\n2014), as well as its limitations in terms of why desistance\noccurs (Healy, 2012), the principal findings were that desist-\ners found new \"redemption\" scripts. These new scripts\nenabled desistance through a remodeling of the \"self\" while\n1Birmingham City University, UK\n2University of the West of England, Bristol, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nDavid Hockey, Birmingham City University, City North Campus, Perry\nEmail: Investigative-services@hotmail.co.uk\nNarrative Theory Applied to the\nAutobiographies of Three Life-Course\nOffenders\n Keywords\nnarrative theory, life-course offenders, versatile offenders, criminal careers\n2 SAGE Open\nretaining some coherence to the past. This allowed these ex-\noffenders to make sense of that past and move forward with\nnew ways of being, including core ideas and believes from\nthe old \"self.\" More recently, Youngs and Canter (2012b)\nargued that narrative theory when considered at the point of\noffending may also have the potential to link identity, emo-\ntion, and cognitive processing. They devised categories that\ndrew on narrative theory to explain narrative themes, which\ninfluence the offender at the point of the offense. This\napproach builds on what Presser (2009) saw as stories being\nsituated in the antecedents of crime.\nsee stories as metaphors rather than individuals creating fic-\ntional personas which they set out to become. Narratives\ncontain identities, a plot, actors, and a context. This also\nlinks the past with future events, together with an individu-\nal's goals and intentions. Two models of narrative theory\nbriefly reviewed here suggest that the framework has poten-\ntial and utility for criminogenic applications.\nThe M. M. Gergen and Gergen (1984) model consists of\nthe following features. A \"goal state\" or \"valued end\" must\nbe established to succeed as a narrative. Narratives are struc-\ntured in such a way as to generate a connectedness and\ncoherence which creates a sense of movement or direction\nthrough time. Events must be selected in such a way as the\ngoal state is rendered more or less probable. As one moves\nfrom one event to another, one approaches or moves from the\ndesired goal state, hence a sense of directionality. There are\nthree forms to this: (a) progress toward the goal is enhanced,\nwhich the protagonist is developing or building; (b) in the\nregressive narrative, things get worse over time; and (c) in\nthe stability narrative, the protagonist has incidents and\nimages linked in such a way that things remain the same. The\ntheoretical framework is concerned with meanings assigned\nto movements, rather than the reporting of specific concrete\nfacts or the accuracy of the relationship between facts. The\narrangement of facts is only important in relation to the goal\nstate. The meanings within autobiographies are not exclu-\nsively private but are limited at the outset to a vocabulary of\naction that possesses currency within the culture.\nIn contrast, the McAdams (1996) model, while consisting\nof some overlapping features (e.g., less about facts and more\nabout meanings), differs in that it composes an heroic narra-\ntive of the self that illustrates essential truths about the self.\nThe heroic myth exists inside the mind and is embedded in\nthe complicated series of accounts. It is the central story from\nthe various episodes told. The model consists of a narrative\nmode (concerned with human wants, needs, and goals) as\nopposed to a paradigmatic mode (scientific thinking).Agood\nautobiography puts a life into story form complete with set-\nting, characters, recurring themes, images, and the self-con-\nscious reconstruction of human time through narrative.\nInitially, elementary children think in concrete terms where\nthey learn about rules and principles. During late adoles-\ncence, they become narrators and self-conscious myth\nmakers, before that there is no life-story, no identity. There\nare four types of mythic forms: Comedy and Romance\n(Optimistic tone); Tragedy and Irony (Pessimistic tone).\nCharacters now consist of motivation, which older children\nbegin to comprehend. These motives exist within personality\nwhich derives from the internal dispositions. Theories of\nmotivation, which are held to help organize behaviors, con-\nsist of two phases: first strivings: power, autonomy, indepen-\ndence, status, experiences, rich with emotional excitement;\nsecond strivings: love, intimacy, interdependence, accep-\ntance, interpersonal experiences subsumed with the experi-\nences of the emotion joy. At this point, children begin to see\nhuman behavior as purposeful and organized. Modality\nevolves into agency and communion, which organize a great\nmany human wants (e.g., needs, desires, and goals). Agency\nrepresents a striving to separate from others and breaks down\ninto two subsections. People high in power motivation tend\ntoward a preference for experiences of feeling strong and\ndominating the environment and are likely to take risks.\nPeople high in achievement motivation tend toward a prefer-\nence for experiences of competence. Communion represents\na desire to lose individuality and merge with others. This in\nturn breaks down into the two subsections of intimacy and\nlove. Those with overlapping desires for intimacy and love\nare able to relate to others in warm, close, and supporting\nways. High levels of intimacy motivation are revealed in the\nways they speak with friends and in social groups.\nAlthough not every aspect of the two theories are appli-\ncable to the criminogenic environment, there remains a suf-\nficient framework that can be applied. Although in taking-up\nPresser's (2009) call to further explore the potential of narra-\ntive criminology, the study here does not advance a particular\napproach. It does not follow Presser's \"constitutive\"\napproach, which epistemologically privileges language as a\nlinguistic devise for minimizing agency and sociologically\nderived notions of the self, from those made available cultur-\nally. However, it does draw from McAdams (2012), in that\nthis study is in the context of exploration of psychological\ntheory.\nThe utilization of autobiographies within research is typi-\ncally derived from in-depth interviews, which are subject to\nimpression management devices and issues with accuracy\n(Snook, Dhami, & Kavanagh, 2011), hence the unease that\nsome criminologists have in accepting their validity (Presser,\n2009). However, where the purpose is to explore the con-\nstruction of the narrative, the concern for precise detail and\nimpression management is negated because the narrative is\nabout how a protagonist makes sense of their life and how\nthey cast themselves (Presser, 2009). The events that a pro-\ntagonist draws from to create their story are the construction\nof the narrative. Within that, the narrative-identity is the pro-\ntagonist's attempt to produce their image around their behav-\nior. Furthermore, a protagonist's account can be compared\nwith other sources, such as official data, criminal records,\nand empirical literature. If the account conforms to these\nsources, it is more likely to derive from actual experiences.\nIn an exploratory approach such as this, starting with\naccounts that are grounded in this way links a protagonist's\nnarrative construction to what is already known about life-\ncourse offenders, independent of the narrative framework.\nOne way in which to consider whether narrative theory\nhas utility for understanding life-course offenders is to\nexplore the written autobiographies of ex-offenders and map\nthese disparate areas of inquiry onto the accounts, while con-\ntrasting the results with the narrative framework.\nAs one purpose of narrative theory is to identify how the\nprotagonist renders the events into a story, including making\nsense of disruptions (Murray, 2003), the written autobiogra-\nphy provides a rich source of descriptive data relating to\nwhat the protagonist sees as important to their story, includ-\ning its presentation. The accounts used here contain post-\nevent rationalizations and reflections upon offending\nactivities, some of which may not always be encapsulated by\ninterview methods.\nMethod\nParticipants/Materials\nThe written autobiographies of three United Kingdom, male\nSmith, 2004). These protagonists were chosen because they\nwere a good fit to Moffitt's (1993) life-course offenders;\nHalliday's (2001) repeat offenders, and Farrington et al.'s\nwas a gangland enforcer in Glasgow during the 1960s. He\nwas eventually given a life sentence for murder, during\nwhich time, and in his 30s, wrote his autobiography. Freddie\nForeman also became a gangland enforcer in London during\nthe Krays era and beyond. He received a number of long\nprison sentences, though not a life sentence. His autobiogra-\nphy was written during his late 70s, some years after his\nrelease. Noel \"Razor\" Smith, also from London, eventually\nreceived a life sentence resulting from repeated armed rob-\nbery convictions and prior sentences from the 1970s through\nto the late 1990s. Smith wrote his autobiography during his\nearly 40s while serving his life sentence. All three offenders\noriginated from underprivileged backgrounds, were fre-\nquently in trouble at school, began offending during their\nearly teenage years, served a number of prison sentences\nthroughout their criminal lives, and eventually desisted dur-\ning the mid or later stages of life.\nProcedure/Analysis\nA three-stage exploration of the data was conducted. First, all\noffense-related material was collated. This included pre and\npost rationalizations, descriptions, and reflections. The data\nwere grouped and coded according to the following broad\nthemes: trait-driven, rational choice, versatility/specialization,\nModus Operandi (MO), and desistance. These were later\nrefined by the analysis (see results below). As the purpose of\nthe study was to compare the trajectory of life-course offend-\ners in the context of these competing theoretical orientations\nand a general narrative framework, the theory-led approach\n(Hayes, 2000) was utilized. This is incidentally compatible\nwith both realist and relativist epistemologies (Braun &\nClarke, 2006) as well as several methods of analysis (Willig,\n2003). This approach seeks to identify existing theories that\nexplain the data rather than identifying only data that support\na priori theory or devising new theories from the data.\nArguably, alternative theories may have been compatible with\nnarrative theory or with some of the data groupings, but that\nwould have defeated the purpose of the study, which was to\nexplore the capacity of the narrative framework to handle the\ncomplexities of competing theories linked to versatility and\nspecialization.\nThis approach had two purposes: first, it offered a mea-\nsure of validity to the autobiographies by comparing the\naccounts with what is known about the offending patterns of\nsome long-term offenders, while alerting us to how some\noffenders actually transverse a number of theoretically con-\nflicting areas of study. Second, it facilitated organizing the\ngroupings into temporal stages to discern the relationship\nbetween narrative theory and the temporal stages of the crim-\ninal life course. In practice, these two stages were integrated.\nThe third stage of the analysis explored the meaning of the\nnarrative for the protagonist(s). Here, existing theory was not\nused to guide the analysis. Meaning was explored through\nthe emplotment and depending on the epistemological\napproach taken, meaning can be attributed through privileg-\ning language as in Presser's (2009) \"constitutive,\" post-pos-\nitivist position or within a realist epistemology (May, 1996)\nas taken here. Nested within Presser's (2009) constitutive\nand Youngs (2012) stress the importance of the \"here and\nnow\" of offense decisions. This in turn results in an appeal to\na culturally available narrative-identity, played out by the\noffender at the point of offending. A realist epistemology\ndoes not reject the notion that offenders make \"here and\nnow\" decisions. Rather, it emphasizes enduring dispositions\nand constructs such as cognition. The purpose of a realist\napproach is to explain, while a post-positivist is typically to\ndescribe. The McAdams approach, which emphasizes inter-\nnal constructs, falls within the realist epistemology, while\nculturally available resources may become the vehicle which\na protagonist subsequently adopts or aspires toward.\nWithin realism, language is not privileged in its own right,\nrather extracts are treated as items of data (Hockey, 2014).\nResults\nThese first five themes deriving from the first two stages of\nthe analysis relate to different chronological and spatial peri-\nods in the trajectories of these life-course offenders. The\n4 SAGE Open\nthird stage yielded the narrative-identity, emplotment, and\nthe resulting story.\nTheme 1: Trait-Driven Behaviors\nThis theme is about cyclical behaviors that dominate the\nlives of those individuals who neither understand these\ndrives nor are able to control them, despite the deeply\ndestructive consequences that arise from them and was par-\nticularly relevant during the early adolescent period.\nResearch has shown that many young offenders have\ntraits that hinder normal development and socialization\ncourse (Moffitt, Caspi, Harrington, & Milne, 2002). These\ntraits typically manifest as \"aggression\" (Huesmann, 1994;\nHuesmann & Eron, 1989; Huesmann, Lefkowitz, Eron, &\nHuesmann et al. (1984) administered a variety of proce-\ndures (e.g., Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory\nScales [MMPIS] and peer nominated aggression score) to\n870 participants from a semi-rural New York state county,\nwhose modal age was 8 years at the time these initial mea-\nsures were taken. They also interviewed 75% of the parents.\nAt age 19 years, 211 boys from the original cohort were re-\ninterviewed, of which, 198 males were again re-interviewed\nat aged 30 years, along with 165 spouses. Furthermore, data\non 542 of the original cohort (some of whom had been re-\ninterviewed) was obtained from the New York state criminal\njustice system. Results revealed that where high levels of\naggression were shown in 8 year olds, aggression remained\nstable at 19 and 30 years of age, including acts of criminality\nn = 193, self-report). Impulsivity is viewed as an absence of\ninformation processing between impulse and action (Ross &\nFabiano, 1985), exhibiting a lack of self-control (Gottfredson\n& Hirschi, 1990) resulting from social skills deficits\n(Freedman, Rosenthal, Donahoe, Schlundt, & McFall, 1978).\nBoyle aged 13 years experienced his first period of cus-\ntody, \"The thought of returning to the remand home was\nworrying me very much as the few hours I'd spent there had\nbeen enough and I only wanted to go home and I'd never get\nin trouble again\" (p. 39).\nAlthough he may have meant it at the time, it did not stop\nhim from reoffending and soon found himself experiencing\nthe same anxiety:\nI was overjoyed when I was out and sincerely meant it when I\ntold my Ma that I would never get in trouble again. I told her this\nagain and again, and with my whole heart and soul this was what\nI meant. Why when feeling like this did I return time and time\nagain? I never wanted to get into trouble and this feeling was\npassionately strong. (p. 48)\nSmith wrote, \"At the age of fourteen I was a criminal in\nthe making. I had very little fear of anything, I was willing to\ntake on dangerous gambles on little more than a whim, and I\nhated the Police\" (p. 44).\nForeman reflecting on his late teenage years of violence\nwrote about his lack of forethought and loss of self-control:\nAlthough young men at the time we never considered the\nimplications, if someone died as a result of a fight you could\nvery easily find yourself facing a murder charge. In spite of that,\nyou continued to risk life and liberty by doing battle with others.\nAnd \"I went over the top on a number of occasions and I\nwould put that down to the madness of youth,\" and \"As\nyoung men we had no fear. Nobody wanted to lose their free-\ndom or their life, but there was literally nothing that could\nfrighten us\" (p. 12).\nThe responses to prevailing events were spontaneous, and\nalthough they may have regretted the consequences later, it\ndid not prevent repeat behaviors. In other words, they were\nrepeatedly impulsive and aggressive, they could not control\ntheir urges (Gottfredson & Hirschi, 1990). Traits can domi-\nnate the adolescence of an individual, particularly if there are\ninsufficient interventions during childhood. For Huesmann\nand Eron (1989), it is the innate factors that produce the cog-\nnitive structures that predispose the child to habitual aggres-\nsion. These internal dispositions (McAdams, 1996) are the\ninnate aspects of an individual's character and are observable\nin 2- to 3-year-olds. For example, studies on twins have\nshown that antisocial behavior maybe more deeply rooted in\nthe genes than prosocial traits (Krueger, Hicks, & McGue,\ngotic twins completed a 198-item multidimensional person-\nality questionnaire and an antisocial self-report questionnaire.\nIndividual differences for negative emotionality and a lack of\nconstraint were highly correlated with antisocial behavior for\nthose in non-shared environments. Of the different models\ntested (i.e., genetic variance with shared environment [AC],\nand genetic variance with non-shared environment [AE]), it\nwas found that antisocial behavior was linked to AE, 2 =\n1.79, p < .05. What appears to influence onset in life-course\noffenders (Moffitt et al., 2002) are a number of dysfunctional\ntraits that have been observed to endure across the life course\n(Huesmann & Guerra, 1997), particularly in the absence of\nintervention or self-rehabilitation. The presence of these\ntraits may explain the difference between children within the\nsame families or social backgrounds, experiencing similar\nsocial risk factors who offend while others do not (see\nFarrington, 1996, for a review of multilevel risk factors).\nSmith reflecting on his adolescence wrote, \"though I was\nslowly learning to suppress my own natural instincts, I was\nnot yet fully mature\" (p. 193), while Foreman wrote,\n\"Looking back I have learned to understand some of the\nforces that dictated my actions\" (p. 12). They were often con-\nfused by the cyclical process, suggesting that they lacked the\ncapacity to be able to appreciate or control these drives.\nFurthermore, during their adult-offending years, they each\nmade references to committing random offenses impulsively\nand out of desperation, despite long periods of offending as\nself-proclaimed professionals.\nAn alternative view is Presser's (2009) \"Constitutive\"\napproach in that cultural identities influence a protagonists\nnarrative-identity and role. However, given that onset was in\nearly adolescence and prior to identity formation (McAdams,\n1996), the question for the Constitutive approach here would\nbe \"how can they choose a cultural influence.\" That is not to\ndeny an interaction with cultural influences, but with early\nteenage offending being pre narrative-identity and the\nweight of evidence relating to internal dispositions, it\nappears more logical that dispositions, not cultural influ-\nences, predominantly drive early offending. As later stages\nin the analysis below suggest, cultural influences may play\nan increasing role.\nTheme 2: Opportunity and Versatility\nThis theme is concerned with how individuals seek-out or\ntake up new opportunities as they are presented.At this stage,\nthere is no commitment to a specific set of criminal offenses\nbut there is an underlying consistency to the process of\ncriminality.\nTwo strands of the research field, \"opportunity,\" under-\npinned by Cornish and Clarke's (1986) Rational Choice the-\nory, in conjunction with Cohen and Felson's (1979) Routine\nActivities theory (RAT), and \"versatility\" (Farrington et al.,\noffending. Rational Choice theory is concerned with the\nprinciple of \"least effort\" and the calculation of minimizing\nthe risk of failure against possible gains. This operates in\nconjunction with RAT, in that offenders seek-out the neces-\nsary role of \"opportunities\" (Clarke, 2010) within the envi-\nronment typically habituated.\nAt 12 years old, Boyle would steal from shops on the way\nhome from school, \"We found it exciting and soon we were\ndeliberately stealing, going into shops on the way home to\ntake whatever we could\" (p. 27). Reflecting on a new oppor-\ntunity, Boyle aged 13 years recalls the time when chewing-\ngum machines were being installed to shop fronts all over the\ndistrict, \"These machines made a fortune as everyone was\nusing them, but their accessibility was very tempting to us\nwho roamed the street\" (p. 35). Boyle was eventually caught\nand given another period of custody. By the time he was\nreleased, the chewing-gum machine opportunity had gone.\nHowever, Boyle was soon stealing coal to sell, \"Eventually\nwe gave-up trying to get the coal legitimately and decided to\nAs a teenager, Smith was still finding his way in the crim-\ninal world and had not settled on a particular offense type in\nwhich to earn money, \"we would drive around looking for\nthings to nick and bring back to sell\" (p. 243). Although he\ncontinued to do random car-related offenses, when an oppor-\ntunity came along to cash stolen giro checks, he took\nadvantage of it, \"The Giro firm were always looking for a\nnew face to take the checks into the post offices, and I did a\nbit of that for a while\" (p. 255).\nAt aged 18 years, Foreman joined a gang of girl shoplift-\ners, \"I teamed up with a load of girls known as the Forty\nThieves\" (p. 41). After that was over, Foreman continued to\ntake up any viable opportunity that came along, \"George and\nI were always open to fresh opportunities, like the one that\npresented itself at George's own workplace\" (p. 67).\nThese examples reveal that throughout their adolescence,\neach of them moved from one money making scheme to\nanother as new opportunities became available, while previ-\nous schemes ceased to exist or remain viable (Crawford &\nAdolescent versatility appears to be influenced by the\nopportunities that are available at a given moment.An instru-\nmental element of versatility then is opportunity. Opportunity,\nin part, derives from an offender's environmental constraints\n(RAT). Suggestively, an impoverished calculation of risks\nversus benefits, albeit impulsively assessed, informs the\ndecision making of offending.\nThis period of versatility, while not exclusively related to\nthe adolescent years is certainly dominant during this stage\nand appears to precede specialization. A pre-requisite to\noffense specialization is the evolvement of \"offence scripts\"\nTheme 3: Habit, Routine, and Offense Scripts\nThis theme is characterized by the procedural knowledge of\nrepeated sequences and refining the procedures through\nexperience. Offenders develop a system or set of procedures\nwhich facilitate the smooth running of a criminal activity.\nThrough direct experience or vicarious means (Bandura,\n1989), they learn how to build techniques into the routines,\nwhich increase their prospects of committing offenses\nScript theory (Schank & Abelson, 1977) is considered to\nbe a mode of processing information at a basic level. The\nmain characteristics of the theory are that there is a routine\nwhich develops from rehearsal or habit. The routine is\ndesigned to achieve a concrete goal such as eating in a res-\ntaurant. As the script holder becomes more familiar with the\nroutine, less cognitive processing is required and so it\nbecomes more automated. The notion of scripts is further\nelaborated by Cornish (1994b) who viewed them as a par-\nticular form of schemata. Schemata's are mental constructs\nthat organize information about something (e.g., a restau-\nrant). Scripts are the \"dynamic\" form of the schemata because\nthey move the script holder (e.g., a customer) through the\nscenario. A number of studies regarding the cognitive pro-\ncessing of criminal behavior across a range of different\noffense types have compared the basic principles of the the-\nory with the processing styles of habitual offenders (Cornish,\n6 SAGE Open\nDecker, 1994). Furthermore, script-style processing directs\nattention toward behaviors consistent with it (Ceci, Fitneva,\nAydin, & Chernyak, 2011), hence the cyclical process. In the\ncontext of offenders' routine lifestyles (Brantingham &\nCostello, 2000), habit appears to develop in two ways: first,\nthe utilization of the routine \"into\" a typical activity and, sec-\nond, the mode of processing as a minimalist function, per-\nhaps as a heuristic device (e.g., Cornish & Clarke's, 1986,\nprincipal of least effort) at a more general level.\nAt age 13 years, Boyle was learning about methods for\ncommitting burglary, \"One of these methods was known as\n`grafting' which was finding a shop with an empty house\nnext to it or above it and making a hole in the roof or through\nthe floor and going in that way\" (p. 52). During these bur-\nglaries, Boyle had acquired a series of techniques designed\nto enable the burglary and reduce the risk of immediate\napprehension.\nSmith had developed into a bank robber during his late\n20s and had acquired a smooth, efficient routine for commit-\nting the offense. His gang targeted banks at the time when\nsecurity was at its most vulnerable and the potential gains\nwere at their highest, \"For us the hard work was in finding\nout which day the reserve was expected and this was mainly\ndone by picking a good-sized bank and putting it under\nobservation for a while\" (p. 11).\nAt age 24 years, Forman had developed into a prolific\nburglar of commercial premises and had a series of tech-\nniques built into his routine designed to reduce the risk of\ngetting caught, \"We would return to the store and walk\naround inside the shop, trying to set off hidden alarms\" (p.\n74). They would then hide for a while to see if the police\nturned up before going back inside the building and carry on\nwith the burglary.\nNee and Meenaghan (2006) found that experienced bur-\nglars displayed the characteristics of expertise as they talked\ntheir way through the decision making of a hypothetical bur-\nglary scenario. Topalli (2005) also found that the decision\nmaking of violent offenders equated to specialization when\ncompared with non-offenders. This \"here and now\" crime\nscene efficiency is often confused with intelligence, which\nhas an unclear role in its contribution to crime (Blackburn,\n2001) and is an over inflated perception of the rational choice\nmaking process. For example, Cornish and Clarke's (1987)\ncost benefits analysis results from the rehearsal of simplified\nroutines, which focus on immediate or short-term goals. An\noverlooked but central component is that these offense scripts\nare \"here and now\" (Ross & Ross, 1995) goal-tied problem\nsolving mechanisms, similar to Piaget's (1962) concrete oper-\national thinking stage. Just as the child develops more elabo-\nrate detail in the games being played through daily experience,\nthe habitual offender develops more elaborate detail to the\ncrime scene behavior through similarly limited processing. It\nis this observed temporal development that creates the illu-\nsion between the here and now thinking of the trait-driven\nbehaviors and the perceived efficacy or agency underpinning\nthe misunderstood rational choice model, hence Cornish and\nClarke emphasis a \"bounded rationality.\" The realization of\nwhat one has done to one's own life as well as to others does\nnot occur until later (see the desistance and emplotment\nthemes below). Moreover, Hockey and Honey (2013), and\nHockey (2016) found that a group of apprehended offender\nprimarily focused on how to commit a burglary, while the\nnon-apprehended offender group primarily focused on how to\navoid detection. The processing capacity of the apprehended\noffenders at the crime scene remained within the parameters\nof concrete processing (Ross & Ross, 1995; also see\nFarrington, 1996, who noted that habitual offenders tended to\ndo less well on abstract tasks than non-offenders, while per-\nforming well on concrete tasks). Indeed, Canter and Youngs\n(2010) described offenders as \"limited\" people, while Morgan\n(2002) provided a breakdown of the dysfunctional character-\nistics of the prison population. This suggests that agency is\nbounded and is more about how to commit an offense or\n\"how to construct a narrative-identity\" (Ward & Marshall,\n2007) than the offender having the abstract capacity to see\nbeyond the \"here and now\" of offending.\nTheme 4: Specialization, MO, and Narration\nThis theme is characterized by choice making in terms of\noffense type and how it is committed. In this context, offense\ntype refers to the \"specialization\" of an offender to focus on\nparticular crimes deriving from early versatility. However,\nresearch has indicated that specialization is more about crim-\ninogenic themes (e.g., Donald & Wilson, 2000; Soothill,\nAnother strand to this line of investigation has been pursued\nthrough studying the MO, which is effectively the offender's\nidiosyncratic style embedded within the general sequence for\ncommitting a crime.\nThere has been long-standing support for the notion that\noffenders have an MO, which provides the basis of how the\ngiven offender commits crimes (e.g., Alison & Eyre, 2009;\ndescribed the MO as a pattern of behavior that is rather more\nspecific than the general style of an offense. An MO is\nthought to derive from a schema that an offender holds about\nthe way in which a given crime type unfolds (Jackson &\nBekerian, 1997). Therefore, a particular offender's MO will\nhold idiosyncratic detail which is embedded within the gen-\neral offense script.\nHowever, within the context of a narrative framework,\nwhat is of interest is whether there is an interaction between\noffense type or specialization, MO, and narrative-identity.\nThis includes the manifestation of a narrative-role, which is\nnot limited to cognition as in the offense-script framework.\nAs Youngs and Canter (2012b), and Canter and Youngs\n(2012) argued, narration begins to combine emotion, iden-\ntity, and cognition in the decision making of the criminal act.\nIn this respect, if an offender holds a narrative identify, deci-\nsions may derive from the offender's perception of which\nbehaviors are appropriate or desirable to adopt in a crimino-\ngenic situation, hence a narrative-role. Presser's (2009)\nnotion of \"narrative influencing lines of action\" may become\nsalient at a given moment resulting in a behavior selection\n(e.g., Ward's, 2012, \"narrative product\"). Narrative-identity\nbroadly equates to an offender's self-concept or self-identity\n(Canter & Youngs, 2010) but with a dynamic output within a\nsocial context (K. J. Gergen & Gergen, 1988).\nYoungs and Canter (2012b) developed a four-category\ntypology of the central themes that they found to be important\nin offenders' immediate criminal actions. Building on themes\n(i.e., Professional, Hero, Victim, and Revenger) derived from\nthe Canter, Kaouri, and Ioannou (2003) study, Youngs and\nCanter (2012a) administered their \"Narrative Roles\nQuestionnaire\" to 71 offenders with an age range from 21 to\n61 years old and a mean of 34.5, incarcerated for a mixture of\noffense types. The results showed separate self-awareness on\nthe identity-focused items. For example, while some offend-\ners saw themselves as being weak (e.g., I was helpless; Victim\ntheme), others saw themselves as being strong (e.g., I was like\na professional; Professional theme). Within these categories,\nthe \"professional,\" as with Merton's (1957) innovator, appears\nto be the closest fit to the protagonists here.The \"Professional\"\ncategory denotes the offender as someone who is doing a job.\nThey are qualified and specialized. They see themselves as\nhighly skilled, intelligent, and competent.\nFurthermore, their choice of offense type was related to\ntheir perceived capabilities, which included comfort with\n\"confrontation\" over what Walsh (1986) described as \"people\navoiders\" (i.e., typically burglars are people avoiders, while\nshoplifters, robbers, and pick-pockets are people acceptors).\nSimilar groupings have been further developed (Youngs,\n2004), and accordingly, the protagonists here would addition-\nally fall into the \"expressive\" category where the offender\nuses violence as the style of interaction to exert control.\nBoyle's principal criminal activities involved an element\nof providing security to protect his moneylending and alco-\nhol selling black-market business, as well being a gangland\nfighter. \"We were now the top mob so with a little luck we\nwould expand and develop things and make plenty of\nmoney,\" and \"We were going from strength to strength and\nthe financial side was blooming. Moneylending was a lucra-\nAs a bank robber, \"Smith\" would have needed to be pre-\npared to take people on in a direct confrontation. The central\ncomponent to his offending relied upon the threat of or if\nnecessary the actual engagement with violence to obtain\nmoney, \"Both me and Andy were doers, up-front men who\nenjoyed being in the thick of it\" (p. 440).\nForeman's post-adolescent criminal days also relied on a\nphysical presence,\nWhenever we did a bank or vault job, I never did the burning\nopen that was left to Ron and big Georg and Mick. Me and Alf\nused to cop for anyone who came back to check us out. We'd\nwrap them up and make sure it was safe to carry on. (p. 89)\nWithin the narrative framework, the narrative-identities\nand corresponding narrative-roles of Boyle, Smith, and\nForeman were that of \"hard men,\" \"tough guys\" who would\nuse violence as a means to achieve their goals. They each had\nfar more confidence than doubt in their abilities to take on\nopposition during times of physical conflict, and this was\nreflected in the type of crimes that they committed (i.e.,\nacquisitive crimes but underpinned with violence).\nThe propensity toward a genre of offense types or \"spe-\ncialisation\" derives from certain characteristics (Donald &\nWilson, 2000) including an offender's perceived skill set or\npersonality traits. Within the narrative framework, this\nappears to influence narrative-identity formulation and\noffense types, which together with the offender's related\nevent-schema, influences the subsequent \"narrative-role\"\n(Youngs & Canter, 2012a). The narrative-role in repeat\noffenders is presumably expressed through the offense script\ncommitting the offense, embedded within that is necessarily\nthe offender's MO.\nTheme 5: Desistance\nThis theme is characterized by the somber tone of reflection\non a past life that failed to live up to early expectations and\nhopes. It is a recognition that something has gone terribly\nwrong and cannot be put right.\nAccording to Maruna (2001), desisters hold a redemption\nscript which casts them as victims of society, where they were\ninvolved in crime to achieve power in an otherwise bleak situ-\nation. Within his model, deviance becomes a trap, but when\nthe chance to desist occurs, desisters can accomplish what\nthey were always meant to do and they can give something\nback to society. This suggests that there comes a point when,\nif an offender is given the right opportunity at the right time,\nthey will rework their scripts to facilitate desistance. Within\nthe redemption script, a series of internal shifts take place to\nenable this, but these shifts occur as a result of favorable\nchanges in the holders' external environment. The past is\nmade sense of and rendered as not being completely pointless\nby retaining perceived culturally valued elements of the old\nself, which support the growth of a new man. This is particu-\nlarly so if they can find roles or occupations that provide the\nsame sense of empowerment and potency that they were\nseeking through criminality (Maruna, 2001).\nBoyle used hatred of the guards as motivation to him to\nkeep going:\n8 SAGE Open\nThe only way to pass time was to do exercise and reading, and\nthinking thoughts of hatred. My former life was far in the\ndistance and I would try not to think of my family as it hurt too\nHe began to develop a mission in which to expose the\nbrutality of the guards where he languished, \"For the next\nweek we concentrated on getting the story out to the press.\nWe had this obsessive belief that getting it into the papers\nwould be the panacea although earlier experience had shown\nus differently\" (p. 216). This was a mission about survival\nmore than about reform. He hated the system and the people\nwho worked in it. For him, they were bullies and cowards\nwho took advantage of their superior positions.\nEventually an opportunity for desistance was presented.\nHe was initially highly suspicious and reluctant to accept it.\nHe was sent to the newly established Barlinie special unit,\ndesigned for a small number of prisoners. Rehabilitation was\nfar more humane than he had previously experienced. It took\ntime for adjustment to this, but eventually he recognized how\na shift in emphasis could keep his mission alive while also\nimproving his own quality of life, \"I could see that bit more\nclearly now, realising that the unit could have the potential to\nshow that change was needed and could be made within the\nSmith also used hatred as a means of survival:\nThe more they prodded, poked and ordered me around, the more\nI grew to hate the bastards. I could feel my hate roiling and\nrumbling within me, like thick molten lava seeking the smallest\ncrack to erupt out of, but I clamped down on it, set my face on\nneutral and used hate as the fuel that drove me. (p. 57)\nHe found he was able to control it enough to call upon when\nneeded to either fight the system or motivate himself to keep\ngoing during periods of despair. As time went on he discov-\nered a new way of channeling this hatred, \"By now I was\nmore into fighting the system with the written word than\nthrowing digs at screws\" (p. 409). This eventually changed\nagain as his mission began to develop into a more construc-\ntive tool.\nThe prison governor visited Smith soon after his reception\nand offered him a deal, \"I could stay in Highdown and not go\nback to Dartmoor on condition that I would cause no trouble\nfor his staff and I would agree to start up an in-house maga-\nThis series of cognitive shifts in their missions did not\noccur without these opportunities. This was not simply a re-\nstorying of their lives, but change occurred through a deeper\nand more fulfilling purpose (Ward, 2012). A simplified illus-\ntrative model might look something like this: (a) hating the\nsystem and using violence to fight it, (b) motivated by hating\nthe system but fight it through legitimate means, and (c) not\nhating the system, but still fighting against its perceived\ninjustices with legitimate means. Boyle and Smith had both\nexperienced many moments in custody where they realized\nthat their lives up to that point had been for nothing and were\nsimply squandered with little future ahead of them. Although\nsimilar to Maruna (2001), where \"new scripts\" could be con-\nstructed with the narrators' retaining some elements of the\n\"old self,\" new ways to move forward were quite different\nhere. The protagonists'attributed their offending to their own\ncharacter inadequacies and their retention of old character\nelements was to enable a continuation of their fight against\nthe system, which was in contrast to Maurna's (2001) desist-\ners who made sense of the past and used it to emerge as better\npeople. This point becomes important when considering the\n\"emplotment.\"\nTheme 6: Emplotment\nThis third step of the analysis is more about meanings\n(McAdams, 1996) than patterns of events, while also draw-\ning from different theories to help make sense of those narra-\nUsing dominant discourses (Willott & Griffin, 1999) that\neffectively sustain and reproduce the social status quo, the\nprotagonists describe themselves as \"good\" criminals,\n\"chaps,\" and \"professionals,\" while today's criminals are\nseen as people without honor or code.\nBoyle wrote,\nThe \"Criminal Code\" isn't a thing that has been written up by\ntop gangsters. It is an unwritten code of ethics. There are done\nthings and things that are not done. It isn't the done thing to\n\"grass\" or inform on anyone. It isn't the done thing to \"bump\" or\ncheat someone from a robbery that you have all taken part in.\nThere are lots of these unwritten rules that could fill another\nbook but these are just two examples that exist between guys in\ncrime and on the whole they abide by them. (p. 99)\nSmith wrote,\nI had always had this strange notion that armed robbery was an\nhonourable profession. I didn't go around coshing pensioners\nfor their bingo money, or burgling people's homes or raping\nwomen and children; I was the cream of the criminal classes, a\n\"blagger,\" one of the heavy mob, a modern-day highwayman. I\ndidn't steal from poor people's pockets, I robbed the rich, the\nbanking and insurance institutions. People who could afford it.\nThe only \"victims\" of my crimes were the faceless money-\nshufflers who had to tally up what was nicked. I was almost a\nRobin Hood figure, for fuck's sake! Or was I?

We considered that respectable and honest\nThey describe themselves as superior criminals to others.\nOffenders often talk about other offenders in a downward\nsocial comparison (Maruna, 2001). These statements are\nexamples of how they see themselves while reflecting back.\nThese references to \"code of ethics,\" \"honourable,\" and\n\"respectable\" denote highly valued virtues in society,\nPresser's (2009) \"cultural context\" and the appeal to these\nunderpin the reconstruction of their past lives while neutral-\nizing or minimalizing the effects of their role in offending.\nThis suggests a na\u00efve attempt to make sense of their past so\nas to position themselves as having been in control of their\nlives when that is not certain (i.e., particularly the trait-driven\nphase), prior to the development of McAdams's (1996) nar-\nrative-identity phase. In many ways, this is at the core of the\nemplotment because it is not only about justifying the life-\nstyle but also trying to make sense of it after desistance and\nwhile retaining the self-concept through the self-narrative\nand positioning it within socially valued conventions.\nWithout these rationalizations about their pasts, it is very dif-\nficult to not feel that their entire lives were wasted up to that\npoint.\nThe emphasis of some stories over others facilitates this\ncoherence (McAdams, 1996), and cultivates an identity of\nbeing one person over time and across circumstances. These\nself-defining memories are essential to ones sense of self\n(McLean, 2005). It is the concordance from discordance\n(Ricoeur, 1994), or the winning out over a lifetime of disrup-\ntions (Murray, 2003) in the form of cyclical prison sentences\nand the preceding behavioral traits that they could not make\nsense of at the time. Furthermore, techniques of neutraliza-\ntion are seen by Presser (2009) as a forerunner to narrative\ncriminology; this rationalization part of the emplotment cor-\nresponds to the basic principles that support Sykes and\nMatza's (1957) assertions. However, how these neutraliza-\ntion techniques are implemented in the emplotment when\nconsidering Hamlin's (1988) point--that it is unclear which\ncame first, the delinquent act or the belief justifying it--sug-\ngests an iterative process in which narrative construction\nevolves with criminal development. Ward and Marshall\n(2007) described narrative-identity as a dynamic and some-\nwhat fluid process. Hence, the protagonists later render an\naccount that makes sense in a way that did not during its\nunfolding. In doing so, they can only draw on those cultur-\nally available discourses (Presser, 2009) and so submitting to\nthe socially dominant ideologies, retrospectively see them-\nselves as having been fully informed agents who were in\ncomplete control of their lives.\nThe need to reconcile the past results from a shift in\naspects of the belief system, while retaining continuity and\nconveying a message about who the narrator really is, but is\nconstructed without appreciating the earlier trait-driven\nbehaviors and lack of a developed agency. As Maruna (2001)\nacknowledged, there may not be a language or discourse\navailable to describe these changes.\nFor example, Foreman wrote, \"Throughout my life, I have\nalways felt revolted by liberty-takers and bullies. In the eyes\nof the law and society I am seen as a villain, but I have always\nstrived to be quiet, polite and well mannered\" (p. 160). Here\nForeman makes sense of his past without appreciating the\ntraits that underpinned the early offending by seeing himself\nas having at least some justification for his lifestyle when\nreferring to people who act in an inappropriate way. He then\nseeks retrospective clarity and continuity by describing him-\nself with the socially valued attributes by always being\n\"quiet\" and \"polite,\" when the evidence suggests that he\nunwittingly held a distorted and mixed belief system.\nAnother important feature both of the narrative and the\nresulting \"emplotment\" is \"reputation,\" which appears to\nhave played an important role in the identity formation of the\nprotagonists here. This is a subplot of the emplotment in that\nbehaviors and rationales relating to the reputation are consis-\ntent with the rationales of the emplotment (e.g., formidable\nbut fair). Reputation also appears to be related to the offense\ntype(s) in which Boyle, Smith, and Foreman specialized\non the MO or the way in which the offenses were carried out.\nAfter slashing another guy in a gang fight at age 14 years,\nBoyle recalls,\nWithin days I was a force to be reckoned with and some kids\nwere saying that I was as \"mad as a brush.\" There was a sort of\nhero worship about all of this and I was placed on a higher\npedestal by all my own gang, but like reputations in other\nfields you've got to deliver the goods otherwise you're in\nAs time went on, violence also began to enter his thieving.\nBy the time he had reached the age of 18 years, he had\nalready spent a number of periods in custody and on one such\noccasion recalls, \"I only knew that I wanted to be out and big\nSimilarly, Smith reflects, \"I craved the recognition of\nbeing a `face' in, and out of, prison, and I loved the respect I\ngot from others in my world\" (p. 7).

One of our own\"\nForeman reflects on his time during his mid teenage years,\n\"I was quite well known and already had a bit of a reputation\nas a street fighter\" (p. 38) and later in adulthood, \"There was\nno limit to what you would do. People knew that, so you held\nthat bit of fear and respect and it was true of the situation at\nFor Stevens (2012), an individual's identity derives from\nthe capacity to keep the narrative going and reflects a recon-\nceptualization of identity formulation that is not trait driven\nwith a fixed core throughout life, but a reiterative activity.\nHowever, this view is too narrow as it ignores the develop-\nmental phase of the narrative-identity and how that may con-\ntribute to its construction and maintenance, as well as the\nbody of evidence that does support the notion of early trait-\ndriven behaviors. Whatever the conceptualization of identity,\nreputation becomes important and this is borne out by the\ncomments of the protagonists' here as well as other offend-\ners. For example, Courtney (2008), who was another violent\ncriminal during the Krays era and an associate of theirs as\nwell as Foreman's, alludes to this notion of honor among\nsome criminals. He claimed to be inspired by how he saw the\nKrays and the presence that they exuded. Similarly, James\n(2003) wrote that to survive in the prison system, it was\nessential to at least appear like you could look after yourself\nin a fight. Maguire and Bennett (1982) noted that the offend-\ners in their study were keen to be associated with those\noffenders with big reputations.\nDiscussion\nCentral to narrative theory is narrative-identity and accord-\ning to McAdams (1996) narrative-identity begins to develop\nin later-adolescence. It is predisposed to create identity along\ncertain thematic lines, including biological, cognitive, and\nsocially related processes. This identity formulation appears\nto emerge around the time that specialization in offending\nwhich is sometime after the onset of offending for Moffitt's\nthis as unchartered territory.\nIn the absence of narrative-identity formulation (McAdams,\n1996), early onset appears to derive from a different source\nand this surely needs to be addressed before narrative theory\ncan be fully realized in the offending context. For example, it\nmay be that traits drive early offending behavior leading to\nrepetition, resulting in routines and habit formation, of which\nconstitutes the offense script (Cornish, 1994b). Direct rewards\nsuch as material gains and further opportunities, including\nreputation, presumably also feed and reinforce the cycle.\nWithin the McAdams approach, as late adolescence draws\nnear, agency begins to play an increasing role but may initially\nbe limited to refining offense decisions (i.e., offense type and\nMO). The offender is drawn toward maximizing material ben-\nefits by offending in ways that are not only familiar and com-\nfortable, but which maintain and enhance reputation.\nTheoretically, this would account for the simultaneous emer-\ngence of offense specialization and narrative-identity, which\nin turn is built around the self-concept (i.e., who one believes\noneself to be, not necessarily who one is; Ward, 2012; also see\nFiske & Taylor, 1991, for a detailed discussion). In this respect,\nchoice making begins to play a greater role than before, but its\nrationality is bounded (Cornish & Clarke, 1987) within the\nparameters of these life enduring traits and social settings,\nwhile agency capable of controlling the self (Ward, 2012)\nremains under-developed in these chaotic and \"high-volume\"\noffenders (Halliday, 2001). At the height of their bounded\nchoice-based offending, the protagonists here could well be\ndescribed within Youngs (2004) \"Expressive\" category,\nYoungs and Canter's (2012a) \"Professional\" category, and\nMerton's (1957) \"Innovator\" category. During this period,\nthere appears to be a convergence with McAdams's (1996)\nsecond modality of agency, which characterises high power\nmotivation, strength, domination and risk taking.\nThe eventual cognitive shifts noted in the desistance\ntheme above and to some extent Maruna's (2001) general\nfindings facilitate a different channeling of the offender's\ntraits from before and are which expressed through a change\nin the social context. It appears more likely that a fully devel-\noped agency, or \"higher-order\" cognitions (Brehm, Kassin,\n& Fein, 1999), needed to be able to take control of the \"self,\"\ndoes not emerge until much later in those offenders who are\nhabitual due to their antisocial traits (e.g., Boyle, Smith, and\nForeman desisted much later in adult life). Furthermore,\nalthough traits may fail to predict behavior in a single situa-\ntion it is behavioral aggregation that enables trait claims\n(Matthews & Deary, 1998). In addition, in contrast to\nMoffitt's (1993) life-course offenders, Moffitt's adolescent-\nlimited offenders presumably do not develop narrative-iden-\ntities based on criminality, but for other reasons, desist from\noffending around this time. The timing of this narrative-iden-\ntity formulation is entirely consistent with the age crime-\ncurve for adolescent desisters and those that continue\noffending. Maruna's (2001) claim, that desistance is a prob-\nlem to trait theorists, is difficult to support not only in respect\nof these wider considerations, but in light of the protagonists\nhere, who found ways to reform while managing their traits.\nPhilosophically, Ricoeur (1994) conceived of two distinct\nand polarized but overlapping values, which are identity as\n\"selfhood\" and identity as \"sameness\" or as oneness and\ntogether form the narrative-identity. Selfhood is the cogni-\ntive part, the choice making of the identity which may be\nbased on a set of beliefs about the self (e.g., self-identity).\nSameness is the component that retains a continuous element\nacross time (Ricoeur, 1994). In the offender context, this can\nbe understood as trait characteristics which form part of the\n\"actual-self\" or it can be understood as the part of the \"per-\nceived-self\" that is always seeking to justify one's actions\nwithin cultural values. For Ricoeur, identity takes up position\nin the space between these two values of selfhood and same-\nness, and oscillates between them. For Ricoeur, it is ana-\nlogues to aging, where one's appearance changes over time,\nbut an identifiable element of the previous remains. In rela-\ntion to narrative criminology, it is the slow development and\nemergence of agency over time, which ultimately wins out\nover the earlier trait-driven behaviors, hence the eventual\ndesistence. The emplotment is the protagonist's reflective\nsense making of the what, why, and how, which has come\nafter the cognitive shifts have occurred. It is the necessary\ndrawing on sameness to create a coherence to make sense of\nthe past and prevent a complete collapse into worthlessness\nby creating or maintaining a value to it. A narrative-identity\nreframing (Yardley, Wilson, Kemp, & Brookes, 2013)\nderives from this process. The story that comes from this is\nthe tragedy (Murray, 2003) of the missed opportunities and\nthe realization of \"the person one was always meant to be\"\nLimitations\nThe main potential limitations of this research are the use of\nthe written autobiography and the sample size in terms of\nwhether these accounts are representative of life-course\noffenders generally. In addition, they maybe self-written or\nproduced by a ghost writer working in collaboration with the\nprotagonist who communicates what is important to them,\nalthough this is ultimately the essence of a narrative. Written\nautobiographies provide an offender with an opportunity to\nreflect over a longer period of time and consolidate under-\nstanding with memories in a way that interviews may not.\nFor example, where Maruna (2001) found that his desisters\nattributed their inability to control their offending to outside\nforces (e.g., selfishness as being the product of the environ-\nment), Boyle, Smith, and Foreman saw their inability as\nderiving from internal strivings, which took many years to\nunderstand and manage. Perhaps these discrepancies result\nfrom the differences between protagonists being able to pro-\nduce their own account in their own time, compared with the\ndynamics of an interview setting which produces a particular\nrendering at the point of narration, \"deriving from the imme-\ndiate social contextual demands\" (Prebble, Addis, & Tippett,\n2013). Although there is no claim here that these protago-\nnists are representative of the offending population, it is\ninteresting to note that the accounts were similar in many\nways beyond simply being life-course offenders as alluded to\nby their developmental pattern. Clearly, more autobiogra-\nphies should be analyzed to explore these issues further.\nFuture Implications\nOne issue with using narrative theory as a general theory of\nlife-course offending is that according to McAdams (1996),\nthe principle model utilized by Maruna, 2001, \"narrative-\nidentity,\" does not appear to emerge until after the early onset\nassociated with life-course offenders. However, children do\ndevelop the cognitive skills for telling stories long before\nmid-adolescence (Habermas & Bluck, 2000), although with\nlimited purpose (McAdams, 1996), and so, more work needs\nto be done on this unresolved issue (i.e., does early adoles-\ncent offending begin in the absence of a narrative-identity or\ndoes narrative-identity emerge first and play a key role in\ninfluencing early offending). If trait-driven behaviors are\nresponsible for early onset, two things are plausible: that\nPresser's (2009) \"Constitutive\" culturally available narra-\ntive-identities, as postulated by Maruna (2001), Canter and\natively form the sense-making component to the life-course\noffender's \"offending\" (e.g., offense type and identity) retro-\nspective to early onset, or when giving their accounts their\nparticipants draw from \"culturally\" dominant discourses as\nthe only available means for them to make sense of it.\nFurthermore, while aggression could alternately be\nexplained through theories of masculinity, impulsivity still\nremains less well explained by alternatives to dispositions.\nMoreover, the characteristics of impulsivity and aggression\nappear to continue to play an intermittent role throughout adult\noffending, particularly during desperate times as the analysis\nabove alludes to (also see Maruna, 2001). The assertions of\n(2012), \"that agency plays a central role in a given offence-\nnarrative or theme,\" is not without some merit as offense deci-\nsions are made. Nevertheless, further work is needed to\ndetermine the characteristics of this \"agency\" and how it oper-\nates (i.e., prior to or during narrative-identity formulation). For\nexample, do offenders freely choose a life of crime or choose\na criminal narrative-identity from a particularly limited pool of\nperceived narrative options following onset.\nbeings have the potential to act agentically, which is capable\nof being activated based on the capacity to imagine a new\nself that is meaningful and credible. Persistence is not the\nresult of psychological deficits but the absence of this imaged\nidentity and so lack incentive to exercise agency. Healy's\nresearch was derived from adult offenders and this refash-\nioned hark back to traditional free-will choice making tends\nto become more salient in the later stages of the criminal life\ncourse and appears to have minimum impact on early onset\nfor life-course offenders, based on the results here.\nB. Smith and Sparkes (2009) found that pre-rehabilitation\nathletes with life-changing spinal cord injuries (SCI) per-\nceived of a few, but common (among SCI's) ways of future\nidentities and narratives. For B. Smith (2013), the narrative\nhabitus is an inner library of narratives that the individual\nholds. In their rehabilitation work, they seek to introduce the\nSCI athlete with alternative narratives that can successfully\nbid for a location within the organization of the narrative\nhabitus. These ideas have implications for work around\nagency in terms of free-will or bounded rationality in the\ncontext of offending.\nFinally, theoretical constructs such as \"self-concept,\"\n\"traits,\" and particular versions of \"narrative-identity\" are\nentirely compatible within a micro-level \"realist\" framework\nas they derive from notions of internal mechanisms that can be\nstudied through standardized approaches (see May, 1996). It is\nin the post-positivist approach as outlined by Presser's (2009)\nmacro-level \"constitutive\" approach that such concepts are not\nepistemologically compatible, as there is no commitment to\nthe notion of an accessible reality. As narrative theory devel-\nops within the forensic setting, it may be helpful for research-\ners to make explicit their epistemological orientation. As\nobserved by Ward (2012), this will avoid confusion across the\ndifferent ideologies underpinning the various approaches to\nnarrative theory that Presser (2009) described.\nConclusion\nBased on the limited results of this exploration, narrative\ntheory when applied to life-course offenders does have\nutility, but more work is needed as an explanation for early\nonset. Thus far, it may be better understood as a theory that\nmaintains offending and develops it in specific ways. In\nthis study, its earliest emergence (in terms of narrative-\nidentity) began with specialization, which is more about\nthemes underpinning offense types than very specific acts.\nHowever, earlier trait-driven behaviors which are more ver-\nsatile due to the randomness of opportunities and in the\nabsence of an offender identity to guide decisions appear to\nprovide the context and background in which specialization\nemerges. This specialization appears to be linked to narra-\ntive-identity (i.e., the protagonist's perceived role in a cho-\nsen offense type) as well as the emplotment (i.e., the\nmeanings the protagonist attaches to their role). Trait-\ndriven behaviors and rational choice models are typically\ntreated as disparate areas of inquiry, but it is possible to\nconceive how one gives way to the other in the same\noffender.\n"
