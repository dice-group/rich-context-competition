Incidence of EA and\npostoperative pain scores were recorded at 10-min intervals in the postanaesthetic care unit\n(PACU). The use of EA rescue medications (fentanyl or midazolam) was recorded.\nResults: The incidence of EA was significantly lower in the ketamine group (n \u00bc 33) than the\nmidazolam group (n \u00bc 34) at 10 and 20 min after transfer to PACU. There was no significant\ndifference in overall incidence of EA. The frequency of midazolam use as rescue medication was\nsignificantly lower in the katamine group than in the midazolam group.\nConclusion: Premedication with ketamine is more effective than midazolam in preventing EA\nduring the early emergence period after sevoflurane anaesthesia in children.\n",

Preoperative oral\nmidazolam decreases both preoperative sep-\naration anxiety and the degree of EA\nobserved with sevoflurane anaesthesia.8\nKetamine crosses the blood\u00adbrain barrier\nrapidly and reaches maximal effect in 1 min.\nPremedication with oral ketamine (6 mg/kg)\nhas been shown to reduce EA in children\nundergoing adenotonsillectomy under\ndesflurane anaesthesia, without retarding\nrecovery.9 In addition, the administration\nof 1 mg/kg ketamine intravenously (i.v.),\nfollowed by 1 mg/kg per h ketamine infusion\nduring anaesthesia, reduces EA in paediatric\nstrabismus surgery with sevoflurane anaes-\nthesia.10 A combination of i.v. ketamine plus\nmidazolam was more effective than keta-\nmine alone for sedation during a brief\npainful procedure in children.11\nTo the best of our knowledge, there\nare few studies focusing on the effects\nof intravenous midazolam or ketamine\n(administered as anaesthetic premedication)\non EA following general anaesthesia in\nchildren. The aim of the present study was\nto compare the effects of preoperative mid-\nazolam and ketamine i.v. injection on EA\nafter sevoflurane anaesthesia in children.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis prospective study recruited patients\naged 2\u00ad6 years old with American Society\nof Anesthesiologists physical status 1 or 2,\nscheduled to undergo elective ophthalmic\nsurgery (procedures <2 h) at Haeundae Paik\nHospital, Busan, Republic of Korea,\nChildren with neurological disorders, his-\ntory of allergy to the study drugs, or\nrespiratory tract infection within the previ-\nous 2 weeks were excluded.\nPatients were randomly assigned to either\nthe midazolam group (0.1 mg/kg midazolam\ni.v.) or ketamine group (1.0 mg/kg ketamine\ni.v.) using a computer generated randomiza-\ntion program (www.random.org).\nThis prospective study was approved by\nthe institutional review board of Haeundae\nPaik Hospital, Busan, Republic of Korea,\nand the parents of each child provided\nwritten informed consent prior to enrolment\nAnaesthesia\nAt 1 h before surgery, intravenous access\nwas obtained after applying topical anaes-\nthesia (ANES cream [lidocaine\u00adprilocaine],\nTai Guk Pharm Co., Ltd, Seoul, Republic of\nKorea). After patients arrived in the waiting\nroom (but before premedication), an inde-\npendent anaesthetist who was not involved\nin this study assessed the emotional status\nof each child using a three-point scale\n(1 \u00bc calm, 2 \u00bc anxious but not crying,\n3 \u00bc anxious and crying). A nurse who was\nblinded to the study conditions administered\nstudy drugs (total volume 5 ml) according to\ngroup allocation, and the emotional state of\neach child was then reassessed by the same\nanaesthetist as before (after premedication).\nPatients were transferred to the operating\nroom with monitoring for oxygen saturation,\nelectrocardiogram (ECG), noninvasive blood\npressure (BP) and pulse oximetry. General\nanaesthesia was induced with atropine\n(0.01 mg/kg), propofol (2mg/kg) and fen-\ntanyl (1mg/kg). Rocuronium (0.6mg/kg)\nwas administered to facilitate endotracheal\nintubation. The Induction Compliance\nChecklist (ICC) was used to measure anxiety\nduring induction of anaesthesia.12 General\nanaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane\n2\u00ad3 vol% and 50% oxygen in air. End-tidal\ncarbon dioxide (EtCO2\n) and bispectral\nindex (BIS, Aspect Medical System,\nNorwood, MA, USA) were maintained\nSurgery began within 20\u00ad25 min following\nadministration of premedication.\nAt the end of surgery, sevoflurane was\ndiscontinued and extubation was per-\nformed. An anaesthetist who was blinded\nto study conditions evaluated EA, post-\noperative pain score, heart rate and oxygen\nsaturation at 10-min intervals for 30 min in\nthe post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU).\nStudy endpoints\nThe primary endpoint of the study was the\noverall incidence of postoperative EA,\ndefined as an Aono's four-point\nscale (AFPS) score of !3.13 When EA\noccurred, patients received 0.1 mg/kg fen-\ntanyl i.v., regardless of the presence of their\nparent(s). If EA persisted after two doses of\nfentanyl, patients received 0.1 mg/kg mid-\nazolam i.v. Postoperative pain was assessed\nusing the Children's and Infants'\nPostoperative Pain Scale (CHIPPS).14 The\nhighest EA and CHIPPS score during recov-\nery and the frequency of fentanyl and\nmidazolam administration were recorded.\nPostoperative complications (nausea,\nvomiting, shivering) were noted. Children\nwere transferred to the general ward when\nthey recovered from anaesthesia (modified\nAldrete score > 9).15 Duration of anaesthe-\nsia, duration of surgery, time to extubation\nand length of stay in the PACU were\nrecorded for each patient.\nStatistical analyses\nThe sample size calculation was performed\nbased on a pilot study where the between-\ngroup difference in incidence of EA was\nerror of 5% and drop-out rate of 10%, each\ngroup required 34 patients.\nData were presented as mean \u00c6 SD.\nBetween group comparisons were made\nwith 2-test for categorical variables, inde-\npendent samples t-test for continuous vari-\nables and Mann\u00adWhitney U-test for rank\nscales. Spearman's correlation coefficient\nwas used to investigate associations between\nAFPS and CHIPPS scores. Statistical ana-\nlyses were performed using SPSS\u00d5 version\n21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\n(MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium).\nP-values < 0.05 were considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nThe study randomized 68 patients (32 male/\nrange 2\u00ad6 years). A single patient in the\nketamine group was excluded due to\nextended duration of surgery (>2 h). The\nfinal analysis included 34 patients in the\nmidazolam group (16 male/18 female; mean\nand 33 patients in the ketamine group (16\nage range 2\u00ad6 years). A CONSORT flow\ndiagram for the study is shown Figure 1, and\ndemographic and clinical data are given in\nTable 1. There were no statistically significant\nbetween-group differences in any demo-\ngraphic or clinical parameter. Emotional\nstatus scores were significantly lower follow-\ning premedication in both groups (P < 0.001\nfor each comparison; Table 1).\nData regarding the incidence of EA in\nthe PACU are given in Table 2. There was\nno statistically significant between-group\ndifference in the overall incidence of EA\n(0\u00ad30 min after arrival in PACU).

The administration of\nketamine as premedication decreased both\nthe occurrence of EA during the early\nemergence period (10\u00ad20 min) and the use\nof rescue drugs compared with midazolam\npremedication. Midazolam and ketamine\nhad similar effects at reducing preanaesthe-\nsia separation anxiety in the present study.\nEmergence agitation is observed in\naround 40% of preschool-aged children\nfollowing sevoflurane anaesthesia;13 it\ncauses discomfort and can lead to critical\nproblems during the early recovery period.\nInconsolable crying or restlessness is the\nmost commonly observed manifestation\nduring the initial 10 min of recovery.6\nPremedication with ketamine significantly\ndecreased the incidence of EA during the\nfirst 20 min of recovery after sevoflurane\nanaesthesia, compared with midazolam pre-\nmedication, in the present study.\nMidazolam is widely used as a pre-\nmedication to decrease anxiety in children\nprior to surgery, but its effects on EA are\nunclear. Premedication with oral midazolam\nhas been shown to decrease the incidence of\nEA without delaying discharge from the\nPACU.16 In addition, intravenous adminis-\ntration of a subhypnotic dose of midazolam\n(0.05 mg/kg), in addition to fentanyl before\ndiscontinuation of sevoflurane, was also\nfound to be effective in decreasing EA.17\nIn contrast, however, others found that\nintravenous midazolam did not reduce the\nincidence of EA.18,19 A meta-analysis of\npharmacological prevention of EA in\nchildren indicated that midazolam was inef-\nfective in the prevention of EA in this\nKetamine is a traditional intraoperative\nanaesthetic agent and is a useful premedica-\ntion for sedating fearful children in\nthe surgical waiting room.20 The NMDA-\nantagonistic properties of ketamine may be\nTable 3.

Low-dose ketamine as an adjuvant to\nopioids or local anaesthetics may perform a\nsubstantial function in the reduction of acute\npostoperative pain and may also reduce the\ndose of rescue analgesics.24\nPremedication with i.v. ketamine was\nmore effective than i.v. midazolam in redu-\ncing the occurrence of EA in the present\nstudy. The elimination half-life of ketamine\n(2.5\u00ad2.8 h) is longer than that of midazolam\nmine with an opioid such as alfentanil has\nbeen shown to enhance the distribution and\nclearance of ketamine, and to increase the\ndistribution of ketamine into the brain.21\nThese properties of ketamine may contrib-\nute to its superior effect on EA prevention,\ncompared with midazolam.\nThe induction dose of midazolam\nlam used in this study (0.1 mg/kg) has\nbeen established as the optimum for pre-\nanaesthetic anxiolysis.26 Administration of\n1 mg/kg ketamine prior to entering the\noperating room was shown to decrease\nseparation anxiety, degree of postoperative\npain, and the incidence of EA following\npaediatric ophthalmic surgery under des-\nflurane anaesthesia.20 In contrast, low-dose\nketamine (0.5 mg/kg) had no effect on\npostoperative pain, additional analgesic\nrequirement, or postoperative nausea and\nvomiting during painful ophthalmic sur-\ngery.27 Based on these data, we chose to\nuse 0.1 mg/kg midazolam or 1 mg/kg keta-\nmine in our present study.\nThe current study has some limitations.\nFirst, there is broad variability in the defin-\nitions and analysis tools related to EA. The\nPediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium\n(PAED) scale is a reliable tool for the\nassessment of EA in children,28 but relies\npartly on the assessment of postoperative\neye contact. The ophthalmic nature of the\nsurgery in our study meant that we were\nunable to evaluate eye contact, therefore we\nused a simple AFPS score to measure EA.\nSecondly, ethical concerns prevented the\ninclusion of a placebo group. Thirdly, the\nrole of pain in EA remains debatable and it\nis difficult to distinguish between signs of EA\nand postoperative pain.1 There was no\nsignificant between-group difference in post-\noperative pain score in our study, however.\nOur experience suggested that visual dis-\nturbance and postoperative pain compli-\ncated our assessment of EA.\nIn conclusion, premedication with\n0.1 mg/kg midazolam or 1 mg/kg ketamine\nlowers preoperative anxiety. Premedication\nwith ketamine was more effective than\nmidazolam in the prevention of early post-\noperative EA, and reduced the requirement\nfor rescue medication in children after\nsevoflurane anaesthesia.\n"
