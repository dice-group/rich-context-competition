In the article, she describes\nhow she has been regularly called a \"bloody Jewish\nwhore\" at school and is increasingly afraid of being\nOther people and their families have also moved from\nMalm\u00f6 to other parts of Sweden or to Israel in recent years\nand have talked to the media about Jews' vulnerability and\ntheir decision to move, which has attracted international\nattention.\nAlthough anti-Semitic incidents have occurred through-\nout Sweden, most of the focus has been on one city in\nparticular, Malm\u00f6.

The\nlargest groups come from Iraq, Denmark, ex-Yugoslavia,\nPoland, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to statistics pub-\nMalm\u00f6 were born outside Sweden and about 11% were born\nin Sweden to parents originating from another country (www.\nnot listed in the Swedish statistics, it is difficult to say exactly\nhow many Jews there are in Sweden and in Malm\u00f6. The\nOfficial Council of Swedish Jewish Communities estimates\nthe number of Jews in Sweden to be around 20,000 (www.\njudiskacentralradet.se).According to the information provided\nby the Jewish community in Malm\u00f6, there were 2,000 mem-\ntoday there are only 600. However, not all Jews living in\nMalm\u00f6 are members of the community (www.jfm.se, May 15,\nWhite power groups (neo-Nazi) are active in Sweden\ntoday, and some anti-Semitic hate crimes are committed by\ntheir members. In Malm\u00f6, however, White power groups are\nvery small. But the right-wing populist party, the Sweden\nDemocrats (Sverigedemokraterna), which was a very small\nparty around 15 years ago with strong connections to the\nWhite Power Movement, is now an important actor in the\nSwedish Parliament.

The party is\ndivided in attitudes toward Jews--that are primarily Muslims\nwho are considered a danger for Sweden--but there are party\nmembers who openly declare anti-Jewish positions (Ravid,\nA series of high-profile incidents in and after 2008 placed\nMalm\u00f6 on the national and international map as a place that\nwas unsafe for people identified as Jews (see, for example,\ninternational press, Malm\u00f6 has been described as a city in\nwhich anti-Semitism flourishes; an anti-Semitism that is\nfueled by the Israel\u00adPalestine conflict and which targets\nSwedish Jews as responsible for the actions taken by the\nstate of Israel (see, for example, Aftonbladet [AB], August\nsituation in Malm\u00f6 was considered so serious that Barack\nObama sent his special envoy, Hannah Rosenthal, to gather\nmore information about the situation there. Since 2010, the\ninternational Simon Wiesenthal Centre has been advising\nJews not to travel to Malm\u00f6 because their safety cannot be\nguaranteed due to the high risk of exposure to hate crime\nMalm\u00f6 can also be discerned in newspaper headlines, such\nas \"USA's envoy reaches hateful Malm\u00f6\" (Kv\u00e4llsposten\nMedia exposure like this could have affected both the\nimage of Jews'exposure to hate crime and the Jewish experi-\nence of such exposure. The media's contributions are impor-\ntant when it comes to structuring the images and discourses\nthat help people to interpret the world (Golding & Murdock,\nmedia study, this article examines Jews' experiences of vul-\nnerability and anti-Semitic hate crime in Malm\u00f6 in a frame-\nwork of how the media reports anti-Semitism of the city of\nMalm\u00f6 as a special place for hate crime. The connection\nbetween the media's news reporting and the experience of\nanti-Semitic harassment and hate crimes is, to our knowl-\nedge, not previously researched.\nWe are aware that ethnic identity and positions are not\nalways the most important aspects, but that dimensions such\nas gender, race, class, religion, and age can interact intersec-\ntionally in complex ways. We all have multiple identities.\nIdentity is a positioning that is dependent on a specific con-\ntext and can be chosen or forced (B\u00f6rjesson & Palmblad,\n2009). As there are major differences among and between\nJews, generalizing Jews as a group can be dangerous. Despite\nthe difficulties associated with generalizations, we have cho-\nsen to use the identity position Jews in the text. This catego-\nrization could help to identify the vulnerability of specific\ngroups, even though there is risk of stereotyped notions\nbeing reproduced (see Str\u00f6mblad & Myrberg, 2015, for a\ndiscussion about the dilemmas of categorization).\nThe primary aim of this article is to explore and exemplify\nwhat it is like to live with Jewish identity in Malm\u00f6 within a\nframework of how the media reports anti-Semitism and how\nthis group copes with being the potential target of anti-\nSemitic harassment and hate crime.\nIn the study, this aim is broken down into three specific\nquestions:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How do people with Jewish identity experience their\nlives in Malm\u00f6?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How is vulnerability dealt with in cases of obvious\nand potential hate crime?\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 How is the media image of Malm\u00f6 as a city that is\nespecially prone to anti-Semitic hate crime?\nListening to victims' stories is vital and enables us to gain\naccess to and understand openly manifested anti-Semitism as\nwell as the more subtle expressions of prejudice and stereo-\ntyping. Based on interviews with people with Jewish identity\nin Malm\u00f6, we analyze and discuss their experiences using\ndifferent themes, such as violent and everyday anti-Semi-\ntism, the local impact of the Israel\u00adPalestine conflict, how\nmedia images affect their lives, and how exposure and vul-\nnerability are dealt with. The findings are important in terms\nof both possible long-term measures against anti-Semitism\nand as immediate support for those targeted.\nPrevious Research and the Theoretical\nPoint of Departure\nIn recent years, reports of anti-Semitic hate crimes against\nJews and Jewish institutions have increased in Europe as a\nwhole and range from the vandalism of Jewish burial grounds\nDecember 2013, the European Union Agency for\nFundamental Rights (FRA) published the report titled\nDiscrimination and Hate Crime Against Jews in EU Member\nStates: Experiences and Perceptions of Anti-Semitism.\nAround 5,500 Jews in eight member states, of which Sweden\nwas one, responded to an online survey about anti-Semitism\nand hate crime. The survey showed that many Jews had been\nexposed to anti-Semitism and hate crime in the examined\ncountries. On average, 66% of the respondents regarded anti-\nSemitism as major problem. In Sweden, the figure was 60%.\nEighty percent of the respondents in Sweden said that anti-\nSemitism had increased in recent years. Of those responding\nin Sweden, 22% said that they had personally been subjected\nto verbal or physical attacks in 2012, although 75% said that\nthey had not reported this to the police because they did not\nthink that it would lead anywhere (FRA, 2013).\nSome of the anti-Semitic incidents/hate crimes in Sweden\nare reported to the police, although the number of unrecorded\ncases is probably great. The Swedish National Council for\nCrime Prevention publishes annual statistics on the number\nof reported hate crimes,1 including those with an anti-Semitic\nWigerfelt and Wigerfelt 3\nmotive. The statistics show that more hate crimes were\ncases; Br\u00e5, National Council for Crime Prevention, 2015). It\nis difficult to say anything definite about the intensity of anti-\nSemitism based on reports to the police and online surveys.\nThe only thing that we can be sure about is that being Jewish\nin Sweden in 2015 is problematic, even though many regard\nJews as part of the \"white\" establishment in Sweden (Nylund\nThe influence of anti-Semitism on Swedish thinking and\nacting in a historical perspective is well documented in\n(2008) uses the phrase \"background noise\" to explain that\nwhile most people condemned anti-Semitism in Germany,\nanti-Semitic notions were \"normal\" in society and were\nalways present, like a constant murmur. However, Kvist\nGeverts's metaphor has been criticized. Tyd\u00e9n (2010) claims\nthat Kvist Geverts takes anti-Semitism for granted, and thus\ndoes not examine whether the different treatments of Jews\ncan be due to various causes. \u00c5mark (2011) explains that\nthere was a change in the beginning of the 1930s toward\npolarization of views on anti-Semitism. For example,\nSwedish Nazis use vulgar anti-Semitic propaganda, while\nothers previously involved in everyday anti-Semitism\nreacted by distancing themselves from the anti-Semitic\nspeech.\nAfter the Second World War, anti-Semitism was regarded\nas something that belonged to the past. However, in many\nparts of the world, including Sweden, anti-Semitic hate\nspeech and violence are again on the rise (Bergmann, 2008;\ncommunities continue to experience violence against people\nand their property--synagogues, cemeteries, businesses, and\ngrowth of new communication and transport technologies\nfacilitates the dissemination of anti-Semitic ideas between\ndifferent countries and leads to the creation of local and\ninternational anti-Semitic ideological networks (Judaken,\nthe Middle East, where anti-Jewish sentiments are often\nlinked to hostility toward Israel, but also in the West, where\nin the last decade incidents of anti-Semitic expression and\nviolence have become more visible (Balogh, 2011;\nThe academic literature on anti-Semitic hate crime in\nEurope is extensive. Much of the literature argues that\ntoday's anti-Semitic hate crimes are triggered by the con-\nflicts in the Middle East--often referred to as \"new anti-\nthese authors argue that a new wave or outbreak of hostility\ntoward Jews in Europe began with the start of the second\nPalestinian intifada in September 2000 and is still making its\npresence felt. This \"new anti-Semitism\" manifests itself as\nhostility toward the state of Israel, which implies that there is\na parity between individual Jews and the state of Israel\n\"old\" anti-Semitism mainly had been advocated by the\nextreme right, the new wave of anti-Semitism was spread\npartly by the left (see, for example, Ulrich, 2013; Wistrich,\n2010). This also applies to Sweden according to Bachner\n(2000), who contends that it was certainly only extreme right\ngroups who stood for open anti-Semitism, but from the 1960s\nvariations of anti-Semitism have also been expressed by\nsome left groups.\nSome scholars emphasize that anti-Semitism stems from\nprejudices, ideologies, and conspiracy theories portraying\nJews as powerful, cunning, and dangerous (e.g., Bergmann,\n2006). Much of this literature argues that understanding the\ncauses of anti-Semitic hate crime also means recognizing the\nconspiratorial and mythical nature of the anti-Semitic ideol-\nogy. As Bergmann (2008) notes, the core feature of anti-\nSemitic conspiracy theory and prejudice is that Jews are\nregarded as the embodiment of supranational modern phe-\nnomena, such as international financial markets, commu-\nnism, and liberal values. Accordingly, their rapid social\nadvancement in most European societies is interpreted as\nconfirmation that Jews secretly dominate the economic and\npolitical world (Byford, 2003). According to these studies,\nthe causes and persistence of anti-Semitic hate crimes in\nEurope cannot be understood if the mythical and conspirato-\nrial nature of anti-Semitic ideologies is not accounted for.\nIn line with scholars like Bachner and Ring (2005), we\nargue that traditional anti-Jewish thinking has contributed to\nthe intensification of anti-Semitism in Europe, which is\nexplained by its deep historical and cultural roots. However,\nlatent anti-Semitism is fanned into life by external events and\ndevelopments and the reactions they trigger (Bachner &\nargues that the Israel\u00adPalestine conflict sometimes serves as\na catalyst for the venting of prejudices that for many people\nare simmering below the surface.\nThe literature on anti-Semitism in Sweden today tends to\nview anti-Semitism as something that is mainly manifested\namong Muslims (Bevelander & Hjerm, 2015; Tossavainen,\nanti-Semitism to a \"Muslim problem\" and thinks that anti-\nSemitism should be understood as a wider social problem.\nThis is also one of our points of departure.\nWhat a victim perceives as anti-Semitic harassment is not\nalways regarded as a crime from a legal point of view,\n4 SAGE Open\nalthough this does not negate the victim's lived experience of\nthe event. Even though the media often highlights and\nfocuses on violent hate crime, many victims say that it is not\nthe violence that is \"psychologically worst\" but rather the\neveryday \"low-level\" nature of the crimes (McClintock,\nthe different categories of people exposed to hate crime,\nshow that such crimes are often committed as part of the nor-\nmal everyday routine. If harassment is part of everyday \"nor-\nmality,\" it is less likely to be reported to the police and\nbecomes part of the victim's everyday life (see also Wang,\n2002). This so-called \"everyday anti-Semitism\" has been\nunderexplored so far. The modes of oppression are in some\nways similar to what is called \"everyday sexism\" (Bates,\nFrom a legal point of view, anti-Semitic hate crime and\nhate crime in general are often regarded as well-defined and\nseparate events, although according to Bowling (1999) they\nshould be seen as part of a continuous chain. Hate crime is\ngenerally based on prejudice, and it is difficult to say where\na hate crime starts and stops. It is rather an ongoing process\nwith a cumulative effect; a dynamic process that develops\nover time in a specific social, political, and historic context\nmaintain that like hate crime in general, anti-Semitic inci-\ndents do not occur in a vacuum but take place in a cultural\ncontext in which prejudice and violence are used as social\nresources.\nMany scholars claim that hate crime is worse than many\nother crimes because it signals that the group to which the\nvictim belongs should \"know its place\" and that compared\nwith other categories many hate crime victims suffer from\nlong-term psychological problems such as fear, depression,\nanxiety, panic attacks, a loss of self-confidence, and sleep-\nBalboni, Garcia, and Gu (2003) mean that the consequences\nof hate crime are different from those of other crimes, in that\nthe victims are replaceable, that is, anyone in the targeted\ngroup could be a victim. In addition, it is not only the victim\nwho experiences problems later on but also the group to\nwhich the victim belongs or is seen to belong. Some victims\nof hate crime are afraid of being targeted again because they\nbelong to a certain group (Boeckmann & Turpin-Petrosino,\nform of aggression that prevents targeted individuals and\ngroups living a \"free\" life. Potential victims experience that\nthey need to be careful and perhaps even conceal their iden-\ntity, which restricts their movements and lives. As one study\non anti-Semitism in Sweden (Nylund Skog, 2006) shows,\nhiding one's Jewish identity by concealing symbols like the\nStar of David and the kippah is common.\nThe fear of being exposed to hate crime due to group\naffinity can also be strengthened by the media's descriptions.\nThe extent to which different target groups are portrayed in\nthe media depends on a number of factors. Some groups have\nstronger voices than others, and can therefore be regarded as\nmore exposed. It is therefore difficult to determine which\ngroups are most vulnerable to hate crime as a result of media\nreporting. The media in turn can influence opinion by setting\nthe agenda for which type of hate crime is featured\nplays an important role in this process, in that it can choose\nwhich hate crime victims to report on and which to ignore.\nOur knowledge about hate crime is often limited to what we\nread in the newspapers or watch on TV, which can give us the\nimpression that hate crime victims are exposed to extreme\nviolence. Drama sells and the media often focuses on the\nmost extreme cases. Behind the reported incidents of extreme\nviolence are thousands of other, more everyday, incidents\nthat do not make the news (see, for example, Tiby, 2010).\nSerious crimes are often overrepresented in the media, and\nthe reporting of crime can reinforce the fear of being exposed\nAccording to Haavisto and Petersson (2013), although\nour attitudes may not change as a result of a newspaper arti-\ncle or blog spot, if a way of thinking or perspective is repeated\nand hammered year after year from many different directions\nit can affect our self-image and understanding of the world.\nResearch (see, for example, Demker, 2014; Sandberg &\nDemker, 2014) indicates that there may be a connection\nbetween how people experience a concern, for example, anti-\nSemitism, and how often the media highlights the different\nevents linked to it. There could thus be a connection between\nthe extent of the media coverage of hate crime incidents in\nMalm\u00f6 and Jewish people's concern about being targeted.\nThis connection is one of the issues that we examine in this\nstudy.\nWe use aspects of agenda-setting theory to analyze the\nmedia's representations of anti-Semitic hate crime in Malm\u00f6.\nAgenda-setting theory is about which social issues are given\nmost attention in the media. The first level concerns which\nobjects--factual matters, organizations, and people--are\nhigh on the media's agenda. The second level concerns how\nthe media reports certain issues and how the general public\nunderstands them. This shifts the focus to how prominent the\ndifferent attributes are on different agendas. By attributes,\nwe mean the qualities and characteristics that are associated\nwith various objects (Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck, 2009). Hate crime as an\nobject has attracted considerable interest and been high on\nthe media's agenda in recent years, with Malm\u00f6 being espe-\ncially highlighted as a city in which anti-Semitic hate crime\nhas escalated. A number of incidents, which we call here key\nincidents, have put Malm\u00f6 on the map both nationally and\ninternationally. What is known as priming is found at the sec-\nond level of agenda-setting theory and concerns the interplay\nbetween the media content and a person's cognitive state\n(Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck, 2009). The mind can be seen as an associative\nnetwork consisting of different nodes and links that connect\nWigerfelt and Wigerfelt 5\nthe nodes to each other, as per the associative network model\n(Fiske & Taylor, 1991). The links between the different\nnodes are both cognitive and affective, and relate to which\nobjects are associated with each other and how a person feels\nabout the links (Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck, 2009). The object Malm\u00f6 acts as\na node, which for many people is connected with the nodes\nof anti-Semitism and hate crime. The more often we hear\nabout Malm\u00f6 and anti-Semitic hate crime, the more likely\nwe are to connect Malm\u00f6 with this.\nMaterials and Method\nThis article is mostly based on in-depth interviews conducted\nwithin the project titled \"Hate Crime--A Challenge to\nDemocracy.\" This is a multidisciplinary study on hate crime\nin Sk\u00e5ne that focuses on the causes, consequences, and sup-\nport initiatives, and is financed by the Swedish Research\nCouncil and the Swedish Crime Victim Compensation\nSupport Authority. The project studies groups that are often\nexposed to crime, such as Jews, Muslims, Afroswedes,\nRoma/Travelers, and the LGBT community, and this article\nis based on one of the project's substudies.\nAs our primary aim in this article is to examine how peo-\nple who identify themselves as Jews in Malm\u00f6 experience\nand deal with anti-Semitic hate crime in a framework of\nmedia reporting of anti-Semitism, we have interviewed peo-\nple with some connection to the Jewish community in\nMalm\u00f6.All the interviews were semistructured, concentrated\non a number of fairly wide themes, were tape-recorded, and\nlater transcribed. An important intention with the interviews\nhas been to try to capture the informants' own meaning mak-\ning, that is, how they describe their own and others' experi-\nences of violation and hate crime. To formulate the relevant\nresearch questions, we first presented our project at a meet-\nconnection with a discussion about the subject of hate crime.\nOn that occasion, we were able to listen to different people's\nexperiences of anti-Semitic hate crime. We also met with a\nintroductory interviews, the authors made contact with other\ninformants via the snowball method (Bryman, 2008). As this\nmethod builds on other people's social contacts, the infor-\nmants are not representative of the group in a statistical sense\n(Bryman, 2008). The people we choose to interview all had\nexperiences of anti-Semitism. In one case, we contacted a\nwoman we had identified through the media. It should be\npointed out that very few people are convicted of hate crimes,\nwhich makes it very difficult to contact informants who have\nbeen officially recognized as hate crime victims. However,\ndespite the lack of convictions, we know that the number of\npeople affected by hate crime and similar incidents is great.\nFor this reason, we have been both broad and explorative in\nour projections.\nIn this substudy, a total number of 11 people between the\nages of 16 and 67--seven women and four men--were\ninterviewed separately and are presented here with fictitious\nnames. All the informants identify themselves as Jewish and\nare proud of it. All except one of the informants are well\nestablished in Swedish society and were also born in Sweden.\nThey can thus be said to have a high social, economic, and\ncultural capital. As the study does not include all Jewish indi-\nviduals and groups in Malm\u00f6, the findings cannot be gener-\nalized, although they can contribute to a deeper understanding\nof the vulnerability that many experience. We stopped col-\nlecting data when we considered that a \"saturation\" point had\nbeen reached and when the results of the themes raised in the\ninterviews began to show similarities with each other\n(Bryman, 2008). In the article, we have chosen to allow\nmany of the informants to speak for themselves by making\nuse of short, yet representative quotations from the con-\nducted interviews. We have also used longer narratives to\nillustrate our conclusions and thereby create a better under-\nstanding of the problems. Miller (2000) maintains that in\nstudies based on life stories or biographical research, narra-\ntive interviews are more oriented toward eliciting the infor-\nmants' perspectives than objective facts. To a great extent,\nthe interviewer is part of the process, in that he or she is\nincluded in the construction of the informant's story.\nAll the interviews were conducted in Swedish, and the\nindividual interviews lasted between 1 and 2 hr. The infor-\nmants were told about the purpose of the study and that par-\nticipation was voluntary. Anonymity was also guaranteed.\nWe have made minor revisions to the language used when\ntranslating from Swedish to English but have tried to stay as\nclose as possible to the original wording. Data were col-\nlected, and analyses were conducted throughout the research\nprocess. The interview guide was frequently revised to suit\nthe varying circumstances, in that questions were added and\nsome were omitted. The analysis began by listening to the\ntaped interviews and reading the transcriptions and docu-\nmentation. The interviews were then coded according to the\ncentral themes that had been identified. Comparisons were\nmade between the researchers'interpretations and the coding\nrevised accordingly. Theoretical concepts were then applied\nto analyze the interpretations. This led to new questions,\nwhich were addressed by returning to the empirical mate-\nrial--an abductive process (Alvesson & Sk\u00f6ldberg, 1994)\nthat was enhanced by alternating between the theory and the\nempirical material.\nAttacks on Jewish buildings and individuals, for example,\nthe rabbi, are things that affect Jews as a group (see, for\nexample, Boeckmann & Turpin-Petrosino, 2002, on how\nhate crime spreads fear). The image of Malm\u00f6 as an anti-\nSemitic bastion emerged at the end of 2008/beginning of\n2009 and can be linked to the conflict between Israel and\nPalestine. In the interviews, the informants often referred to\nincidents that had been reported in the media, and that these\nevents and the media coverage of these events have affected\ntheir experience of vulnerability, which led us to conduct a\nmedia survey and content analysis of a qualitative and\n6 SAGE Open\ninterpretive nature. We searched a variety of databases for\nSwedish newspaper articles on anti-Semitism and hate crime\nsearch yielded 126 articles from a total of 31 different\nSwedish daily newspapers at both the local and national lev-\nels. The reporting mainly focused on news events but also\nincluded in-depth interviews with Jews who in various ways\nhave been exposed to hate crime and contributed to debates.\nIn our analysis of the material, the main focus has been on\nhow the connection between the city of Malm\u00f6 and anti-\nSemitism is construed in the media. We began the investiga-\ntion by sorting the material chronologically, which enabled\nus to follow the media's portrayal of anti-Semitic hate crime\nover time. We then tried to identify important key incidents,\nthat is, events that took place in Malm\u00f6 and attracted wide\nmedia coverage. It became apparent that these incidents had\nalso been reproduced intertextually in different newspapers\nand in some cases also internationally. It also became clear\nthat different key incidents were reproduced over time. When\na new incident that could be linked to anti-Semitism occurred\nin Malm\u00f6, the media connected it with earlier incidents,\nwhich added to the image of a town in which anti-Semitism\nwas strong. Finally, we analyzed and interpreted the media\nmaterial in relation to the interviews.\nResults and Analysis\nAn Increased Vulnerability and Vigilance\nIndependently of each other, most of the informants describe\nand share the experience that the situation for Jews has wors-\nened in recent years.\nJohn, now in his late 60s, was born and bred in Malm\u00f6,\nand remembers how people were very quick to respond to\nanti-Semitic demonstrations when he was growing up: \"It\nsimply wasn't tolerated by society\" (John, December 5,\nMalm\u00f6 all her adult life, agrees with this and says that the\nsituation for Jews in Malm\u00f6 has become much worse over\nthe last couple of years and that nowadays anti-Semitism is\nToday, the limits have been stretched, and the general level\nof acceptance of abusive language is much greater. The view\nof hate crime is related to the use of language--the dis-\ncourse--that is accepted at any given point in time (Cowan,\nResendez, Marshall, & Quist, 2002). According to several of\nour informants, the acceptance of verbal anti-Semitic harass-\nment now seems to be greater than ever before. In addition,\nseveral of the informants say that anti-Semitic feelings have\ngrown not only in neo-Nazi circles but also in minority\ngroups from the Middle East (John, December 5, 2012).\nThe younger informants are not sure whether the targeting\nof Jews has increased in recent years, but say that awareness\nof the problem and watchfulness has increased. For example,\nSara says, \"My awareness has increased and I am now much,\nan important source of information for those wanting to\nremain informed and updated about hate crime. On the more\nnegative side, social forums on the Internet are a haven for\nthe spread of hatred (Wigerfelt, Wigerfelt, & Dahlstrand,\n2015). All the younger informants are extra vigilant when\nsurfing the net because they never know when they might\ncome across an anti-Semitic website or be unexpectedly\nexposed to anti-Semitic propaganda. They all share the expe-\nrience of being at the receiving end of offensive comments in\nsocial forums or being threatened, including death threats, on\nsocial media sites such as Facebook, via email or text mes-\nSeveral of the informants describe incidents that have\noccurred in connection with two children's camps at a Jewish\nconference center located outside Malm\u00f6. On the first occa-\nsion, in 2008, a small group of young people suddenly\nappeared shouting abusive insults but disappeared when the\nappeared on the first evening of the camp shouting \"Jewish\npigs,\" \"Kill all Jews,\" and \"Heil Hitler\" outside the center.\nOn the following evening, the youth, aged around 14 to 15,\nreappeared, and this time kicked down the fence, behaved in\na threatening manner, and threw eggs and glass bottles at the\nbuilding. The incident came as a shock to those present and,\naccording to one of the informants, the younger children\ncried and were afraid (Filip, May 30, 2012). The perpetrators\non these occasions were local youth with \"Swedish\" back-\ngrounds, and the motives for the attacks seem to have been\nanti-Semitism in connection primarily to prejudices as well\nas conspiracy theories.

The area in which the conference center\nis located is one of the most prosperous in southern Sweden.\nAlthough very few inhabitants are born outside Sweden, the\narea has had problems for several years with explicit racism.\nIn other words, anti-Semitism is not just a phenomenon that\ncan be linked to segregation, outsiderhood, and the conflict\nbetween Israel and Palestine. Its manifestations and extent\ndiffer at different times and in diverse places.\nEveryday Anti-Semitism\nAccording to Bachner (2000), the term anti-Semitism has\nbecome \"overcharged\" and often implies an intensive, open,\nand action-oriented hate, as described above. However, the\nconnection between Nazism has resulted in a partial blind-\nness to other kinds of anti-Semitism, such as culturally deter-\nmined prejudices and inherited negative attitudes. In a similar\nway, Iganski (2008) argues that many hate crime incidents\nWigerfelt and Wigerfelt 7\nhave nothing to do with people's violent hate, but rather indi-\ncate a kind of latent anti-Semitism that in many people sim-\nmers below the surface. Anti-Semitism surfaces at random\nand can be triggered by a conflict or everyday irritation in the\nencounter with a Jewish person.\nAt a more everyday and subtle level, general anti-Semitic\nprejudices seem to have been passed down through the gen-\nerations and have spread to other circles. This anti-Semitic\nprejudice can erupt in different situations, sometimes from\nfriends, neighbors, school- and workmates, which many of\nthe younger informants have experience of. Jokes and ironic\nremarks about Jews are common phenomena for those we\ntalked to, are part of the respondent's everyday life, and\nsomething that is almost seen as \"unavoidable.\" As they are\nimpossible to predict, people are forced to be constantly on\nguard. Our informants found it increasingly difficult to\naccept jokes about Jews, partly because they felt more vul-\nnerable now and partly because the jokes reproduced old,\nclassic, anti-Semitic stereotypes about Jews. The younger\ninformants told us that it can start with someone telling a\njoke about Jews, which then escalates to people openly\nexpressing a menacing anti-Semitism, which can be seen as\nan interrelated process.\nAs the Jewish group in Malm\u00f6 is small, Jewish youth are\nmore vulnerable in certain situations. There is a power aspect\nto this, where the number of Jews in relation to other groups\nis significant. According to Ben, being a single Jew in a pub-\nlic place can feel particularly vulnerable, even though many\nregard Jews as part of \"white Sweden\": \"There are so few\nJews in Malm\u00f6 that people can shout whatever they want\"\nwhich she had been verbally attacked because she was Jewish\nand where the aggression had spread to other people: \"If they\nare supported by 3-4 people I cannot defend myself at all. I\nam outnumbered when I am alone. If I am not with my\nfact that the Jewish presence in Malm\u00f6 is small and appears\nto continue to diminish contributes to a vicious circle, where\nyoung people who want to live a richer Jewish life move to\nStockholm or Gothenburg because the Jewish communities\nare much larger there and it is possible to \"keep the traditions\nalive.\" The Jewish community thus continues to diminish,\nand those who remain can experience themselves as part of a\ndiminishing minority and therefore more vulnerable.\nJewish Identity and Spatial Limitations\nOur informants said that as Jews in Malm\u00f6 they were forced\nto reflect on where and in which situation their Jewish iden-\ntity could or could not be exposed. Some of the informants\nthought that they could choose their Jewish identity, whereas\nothers, like John, said that they looked like Jews on the out-\nside: \"Nobody could have failed to notice that I am a Jew\"\n(John, December 5, 2012; see also B\u00f6rjesson & Palmblad,\nAn obvious Jewish symbol that is very uncommon in\nMalm\u00f6 is the headwear known as the kippah, which can be\nseen as a mark of identification. The interviewees experi-\nOther important \"stigma symbols\" include Jewish jewelry/\nnecklaces that many are careful about wearing openly in dif-\nferent situations:\nI usually wear a necklace bearing my Hebrew name. I always\nwear it, but if I'm in Lund [an academic city close to Malm\u00f6] it\ndoesn't matter where I have it. It's always there. But if I go out\non an evening in Malm\u00f6 I usually take it off. I put it in my\npocket. And if we are in Malm\u00f6 on a weekday afternoon or\nevening I always check where it is. If it is in front I turn it round.\nAccording to Craig (2002), targeted individuals/groups\nare prevented from living a \"free\" life. Potential victims feel\nthat they have to be careful and, if possible, conceal their\nidentity, which restricts their lives. Although Andrea (June\na result of her Jewish identity, she has heard a lot about it\nfrom friends and relatives. These narratives have made her\nmuch more cautious: \"I don't tell everyone that I'm a Jew\nbecause I don't want to be a target myself.\" Christopher is\nalso cautious about revealing his Jewish identity: \"I don't\nhide my identity but I don't tell everyone that I'm a Jew. You\nhave to be careful who you talk to\" (Christopher, June 21,\nThe spatial consequences of hate crime can be that vul-\nnerable groups create mental maps of a town and where it is\nsafe, which affects the everyday situation (Iganski & Lagou,\n2009). It is clear that the informants are very conscious of\nspatial limitations. The majority of hate crime takes place\naround the synagogue and assembly hall in Malm\u00f6--places\nwhere attacks have occurred and where safety measures are\nin place. These are places of symbolic significance and\nwhere hate crime is clearly against Jews as a group. The like-\nlihood of being exposed to hate crime here is greater than\nanywhere else. The Jewish community's rabbi, Shneur\nKesselman, is the most vulnerable and is regularly subjected\nto abuse, insults, and gestures from passers-by and people\ndriving past in cars. Most of the reported anti-Semitic hate\ncrimes are directed against him. But other members of the\ncommunity also know that they need to be vigilant on their\nway to or from the synagogue, because the likelihood of\nbeing attacked is greatest there.\nThe Israeli\u00adPalestinian Conflict, Its Local Imprints,\nand Media Images\nThere was a significant increase in the reporting of hate\ncrime against Jews in the Swedish media, with a special\nwhich was largely associated with the conflict between Israel\n8 SAGE Open\nand Palestine. An attribute that was ascribed to Malm\u00f6 was\nthat hate crime was increasing. This was reflected in newspa-\nper headlines such as \"Jewish hatred is rampant in Malm\u00f6\"\n(SDS, February 7, 2009) or \"Jewish hatred drives them away\nIsraeli military operation known as Cast Lead. In Sweden,\nJews began to feel threatened. The Council of Swedish Jewish\nCommunities wrote to the Swedish Government to ask for\nhelp in stopping an increasing threat toward Jews in Sweden.\nThe background to the letter was that threats, violent actions,\nand arson attacks had been directed at Jews and Jewish insti-\ntutions (Dagen, February 4, 2009). The worsening situation\non the Gaza Strip had local imprints. In Malm\u00f6, a Jewish net-\nwork/association organized a demonstration demanding\nIsrael's right to exist, which ended in chaos with demonstra-\ntors being pelted with stones and eggs. Some of the demon-\nstrators were reported to have shouted \"fucking Jews\" and\n\"Heil Hitler.\" The police were unable to guarantee safety and\nsecurity, and many people, including Jews, sought shelter in\nthe streets and alleys adjoining the square (Dagen, February\n4, 2009). This incident--an important key incident in the\nmedia images of Malm\u00f6 as a city especially characterized by\nanti-Semitic hate crime--was reported in both the national\nand international media. In the weeks and months following\nthis turbulent demonstration, Jews experienced an escalation\nin the number of harassments. In an interview, a spokesperson\nfrom the Jewish community described the incident as a kind\nof collective trauma for its members, and perhaps also for the\nIn March 2009, shortly after Cast Lead and the demon-\nstration described above, the city of Malm\u00f6 hosted a Davis\nCup tennis match between Sweden and Israel. Due to the\nturbulent nature of the demonstration, the increase in reported\nanti-Semitic hate crimes and lobbying by anti-Israel groups,\nthe police decided that the match should be played privately\nand not be open to the public. This decision resulted in a\npolarized and heated debate, both nationally and internation-\nally. For example, the Israeli media accused Sweden, and\nspecifically Malm\u00f6, of anti-Semitism (Nordv\u00e4stra Sk\u00e5nes\nTidningar [NST], December 7, 2012). This can also be seen\nas yet another so-called key incident that recurs in both the\ninformants' narratives and media reports.\nWithout exception, the informants living in Malm\u00f6 stress\nthat they all are affected by the Israel\u00adPalestine conflict but that\nover the years they have developed strategies to cope with it.\nThey emphasize the importance of being informed about what\nis happening in Israel and do this by reading daily updates on\nthe Internet, accessing information via Facebook, from friends\nliving in Israel, and so on.All our informants in Malm\u00f6 experi-\nence a clear connection between increased anti-Semitic harass-\nment and open conflicts between Israelis and Palestinians.\nThey feel themselves to be held collectively accountable for\nthe events in the Middle East. Sara said that she and other Jews\nwere held responsible for what happened in Israel:\nWhen anything happens people don't distinguish between Israel\nand us. The conclusion is that Israel plus Jews equals one. But it\nisn't. I can't be held responsible for a whole country's actions.

They don't see us as\nBen thought that it was people from different backgrounds\nwho hurled insults, although in the main it was people from\nthe Middle East:\nAt school there are also Swedes (who insult us), but in the main\nit's people from the Middle East.

Some informants told us that their children\nhave been exposed to hate crime incidents initiated by some of\nthese students. As a result, many Jewish families have chosen\nto send their children to schools where there seems to be less\nrisk of them being targeted. Jewish teachers also talked about\ntheir vulnerability in school, which in some cases has led to\nteachers leaving the profession due to harassment and threats.\nAnti-Semitism and Segregation\nAccording to Bachner and Ring (2005), the anti-Semitism\nthat is evident in certain Muslim groups in Europe is sus-\ntained by the Israel\u00adPalestine conflict but is probably also\nfueled by the social and economic marginalization and outsi-\nderhood that characterizes many of the migrant groups in\nSeveral of the informants point to the city's increased segre-\ngation as an explanation for why Jews feel more exposed in\nMalm\u00f6 than in other parts of the country (John, December 5,\nWigerfelt and Wigerfelt 9\nand thinks that the most important factor for Malm\u00f6 in com-\nbating anti-Semitism is to invest in a good integration policy.\nIn this, she points to the major schisms in the city, where\nmany people are unemployed and live in socially vulnerable\nSophia is a Jewish woman in her late 30s.

For more than a\ndecade, she has lived in a segregated area that is populated\nby a large number of people from different parts of the\nMiddle East, where it is well known that she and her friend\nhave a Jewish background. She has experienced harassment\nin her everyday life.

Attacks like these have affected\nboth women's health--especially psychologically--and\nrestricted their movements, to the extent that they are now\nafraid to leave their home and mix with other people.\nThe effects of hate crime go beyond the immediate vic-\ntim. Others in the same group who hear or read about the hate\ncrime can react angrily and/or with fear (see, for example,\nsaid that they felt vulnerable as Jews even when something\nhappened in other places:\nWhen something happens that is directed at Jews in other places\nthe tension increases, because the threat is always there. We are\nalways vigilant and this affects us a lot, especially when the\nthreat is real. We can't \"keep looking over our shoulder\" but\nhave to try to live a normal everyday life. (Judith, March 22,\nThe Media Images of an \"Anti-Semitic City\"\nThe Jewish community's rabbi became something of an \"offi-\ncial face\" and \"object\" for the anti-Semitism manifested in\nMalm\u00f6. Rabbi Shneur Kesselman, clearly identifiable as a\nJew with his black clothes and long beard, has talked about\nhis vulnerability in Malm\u00f6 in several newspaper interviews.\nKesselman's appearance singles him out as especially\nexposed. He describes being spat at on the street, having soft\ndrink cans thrown at him while walking through the streets\nand almost being run over by a passing car. The rabbi usually\nreports most of the hate crime incidents he is involved in to\nthe police. As yet, none of the reported incidents have led to\nany legal action being taken (Dagen, February 4, 2009;\nWhat about our rabbi? He looks like a Jew. He walks around\ntown and is harassed, spat at or whatever. But imagine if we'd\nall looked like him! Would we be able to live here at all? I don't\nunderstand it. He hasn't even done anything. He's not even from\nIlmar Reepalu, the former mayor of Malm\u00f6, who has\nreceived a lot of negative attention in the debate on anti-Semi-\ntism and has been accused of anti-Semitic rhetoric in his public\nutterances about Jews living in the city, can also be seen as an\n\"object\" with negative attributes in the media descriptions of\nMalm\u00f6 as an anti-Semitic city. For example, Reepalu has said\nthat Jews in Malm\u00f6 ought to distance themselves from Israel's\nactions. This has been criticized and discussed in the media by\npoliticians and other actors. Reepalu has thus become an offi-\ncial representative of Malm\u00f6, and his utterances have contrib-\nuted to headlines such as \"Hate of Jews is greatest in Malm\u00f6\"\nReepalu's statements have also been strongly criticized in the\nlocal press (SDS, September 29, 2012), as exemplified by the\nheadline: \"Reepalu is the Problem\" (SDS, September 30,\n2012). Reepalu's statements have been reproduced and dis-\ncussed in several newspaper debate articles and have been\ntaken up in contexts in which Malm\u00f6 is described as a city\ncharacterized by anti-Semitism. Reepalu has come to personify\nthe critique that government agencies and politicians do not do\nenough to combat and stand up to anti-Semitism.\nA consequence of the key incidents described above and\none's own and others' experiences of harassment is that\nmany Jewish families have moved away from Malm\u00f6.\nAccording to both the media and our interviews, it is clear\nthat some Jewish families have decided to leave Malm\u00f6 in\nthe hope of finding a better life elsewhere. Some families\nhave even talked openly to the press about why they want to\nmove. In one newspaper article, a family was interviewed\nabout why they wanted to move from Malm\u00f6 to Israel. The\nmain reason that was given was an increasing anti-Semitism.\n\"My children are not safe here. It will only get worse,\" said\nthe man in the family. Some of his relatives have lived in\nMalm\u00f6 since the beginning of the 1800s, while others who\nhad survived the extermination camps came in 1945. The\nman said that people had shouted \"fucking Jew\" at him, and\nhe had witnessed how his friend had been seriously violated\nand threatened. He said that if someone shouts \"Kill the\nJews,\" it also affects him and pierces his heart. The man did\nnot know of anyone who dared to wear visible signs of\nJudaism, such as the Star of David or the kippah. He was\ncritical of those in power in Malm\u00f6, and thought that they did\nnot openly distance themselves from anti-Semitism (SkD,\nJanuary 25, 2010). In an interview, one of the informants said\nthat it was not only anti-Semitic hate crime that made fami-\nlies leave Malm\u00f6 but also dissatisfaction with politicians\nwho did not take the problem seriously.

The rabbi was attacked twice in the\nsame day. On the first occasion, a bottle was thrown at him\nand on the second a cigarette lighter. A man shouted \"Jewish\npig\" and other derogatory words at the rabbi (SDS, August 5,\nFinal Discussion\nThe reporting of anti-Semitic hate crime has increased in\nEurope as a whole in recent years. This anti-Semitic current\nhas also affected Sweden, where the city of Malm\u00f6 has been\nhighlighted by the media and by the Simon Wiesenthal\nCentre as a dangerous city for people with a Jewish identity.\nOur examination of the Swedish media's reporting of anti-\nSemitic hate crime incidents shows that in recent years the\nfocus on Malm\u00f6 and some of the key incidents that have\ntaken place there has increased. An attribute that is ascribed\nto anti-Semitic hate crime in Malm\u00f6 is the city's unique posi-\ntion in Sweden. Objects like anti-Semitism, hate crime, and\nMalm\u00f6's politicians serve as nodes that are interconnected\nwith other nodes and key incidents. The links between the\ndifferent nodes are both cognitive and affective, in that they\ndeal with which objects are associated with and how one\nfeels about the links. In short, the more the media reports on\nMalm\u00f6 and anti-Semitic hate crime, the more likely we are to\nconnect the city with this.Also, the more often certain objects\nor attributes are highlighted in the media, the more often\nthese objects are activated and attributed in our minds (prim-\ning) and the more likely we are to think about these particular\nobjects or attributes.\nThe events described above have been intertextually\nrepeated in other parts of Sweden's media and have contrib-\nuted to a view of Malm\u00f6 as the bastion of anti-Semitism; a\nstigmatization that the city finds difficult to shake off. This\nhas also had international repercussions. The effect of this\ncould be that anti-Semitic incidents in other places are\nignored. The fear that is spread by the media is reinforced\nand accumulated by the so-called key incidents that many of\nthe informants themselves, or their friends and relatives,\nhave been exposed to. The key incidents that are particularly\nhighlighted are harassment and threats in connection with\ndemonstrations; for example, Jews being chased on the\nstreet, hate crimes committed against the rabbi, attacks on\nyouth camps, and teachers and children with a Jewish iden-\ntity being harassed at school--events that are distressing and\nconfirm increased vulnerability. There is great disappoint-\nment among the informants that politicians and government\nagencies do not intervene forcefully enough.\nThe majority of the informants think that they have been\ncollectively blamed for the situation in the Middle East, to the\nextent that has become more difficult to be a \"visible\" Jew in\nMalm\u00f6. This is most obvious in the case of the rabbi in Malm\u00f6,\nbut in Sophia's story it is also clear that she and her friend are\nsingled out as Jews in their neighborhood. The stories also\nshow that Jews in other cities are forced to adjust to a kind of\nlatent threat that tends to increase when the conflict between\nIsrael and Palestine escalates. Some of the informants connect\nthe perpetrators of hate crime with young men from the Middle\nEast who mainly act when the conflict between Israel and\nPalestine is at its most acute. The presence of large population\ngroups from the Middle East in relation to the small Jewish\nminority can lead to feelings of insecurity. Many point out that\nMalm\u00f6 is a socially vulnerable and segregated city, and that it\nis also relatively compact, where encounters between people\ntake place in a more direct way than in larger cities, for exam-\nple, Stockholm, with its large geographic spread and suburbs\nsome distance from the center.\nHowever, the informants' stories also reveal a more com-\nplex picture of who the perpetrators are. One example of this\nis the prosperous area outside Malm\u00f6 where Jewish children\nand young people are confronted by extreme right-wing Nazi\nslogans from local young people. The stories about anti-\nSemitic prejudices and stereotypes of friends, neighbors, and\ncolleagues who are Jews indicate another, more widespread,\nabuse. For several of the informants, everyday anti-Semitism\nis very distressing. Iganski (2008) argues that most anti-Jew-\nish incidents are what are sometimes called commonplace\nincidents--a kind of latent anti-Semitism that becomes man-\nifest when the opportunity to ventilate prejudices presents\nitself and is triggered by simple schisms. It is often difficult\nto judge when an anti-Semitic hate crime starts and ends,\nbecause it is an ongoing process with a cumulative effect\nThe situation of Jews in Malm\u00f6 has changed, and many\nexperience that openly revealing their Jewish affinity is prob-\nlematic due to the latent threats. Jewish symbols are often\nspontaneously hidden and, even if one has not been person-\nally affected, there is concern and deliberation about where\nand when one's Jewish identity can be revealed. The syna-\ngogue, the Jewish community's premises, and the Jewish\ncemetery are obvious material symbols for the Jewish group\nand are targets for hate crime attacks. As a Jew, one is forced\nto be extra careful around these areas and be constantly on\nWigerfelt and Wigerfelt 11\nguard. The consequences for the individual can be very seri-\nous. Restrictions in how one lives one's life also affect the\nentire group (Iganski, 2008; McDevitt, Balboni, Garcia, &\nGu, 2003). When someone is affected by hate crime incidents,\nthe entire Jewish group is affected. Anti-Semitic acts can also\nbe described as \"message crimes,\" in that they announce to\nthe victim's group that they can also become targets\n(Lawrence, 2003). Doubts as to whether society can protect\nand support these members and the feeling of abandonment\nare some of the reasons as to why hate crime is seen as worse\nthan crimes that are not motivated by hate crime (see also\nTiby, 2009). It is therefore very important that hate crime is\nexplicitly condemned by leading politicians and government\nagencies, and that special measures are introduced.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The\nSwedish Research Council and the Swedish Crime Victim\nCompensaton Support Authority.\nNotes\n1.
