The model's central premise was supported in two ways. The main influence of\nage, frequency of walking, and musculoskeletal problems was on the onset offunctional limitations, rather than the\nonset of IADL disability.

The results underscore the value of clinical\ntrials which focus on minimizingfunctional limitations as a strategyfor preventing disability.\nAN important focus of gerontological research has been\nL the transition from health to disability. Several models\nof the transition have been proposed, and a common theme\npostulates functional limitations (limitations in the perfor-\nmance of basic tasks considered normal) as the pathway\nfrom illness to disability (Boult et al., 1994; Committee on\nDisability cited in Richardson, 1994; Johnson and Wo-\nHealth Organization, 1980). Longitudinal research has been\ncritical in capturing the dynamic aspects of the transition and\nin helping to define and refine the intermediate stage of\nfunctional limitations in the disablement process (e.g.,\nAvlund, Davidsen, and Schultz-Larsen, 1995; Bowling,\nAlthough valuable for establishing basic associations, the\nprevious research does not allow a full understanding of the\ninterrelationships among demographic and behavioral risk\nfactors, pathology/impairments, functional limitations, and\ndisability. That is, most previous epidemiologic studies of\ndisablement have relied on single-equation systems in which\nhypothesized causes of disability were simultaneously en-\ntered into the model to determine their net direct effects on\ndisability (Avlund, Davidsen, and Schultz-Larsen, 1995;\ntrials designed to reduce and prevent disability would benefit\nfrom analyses which identify the critical risk factors for the\ndisablement process, clarify the causal mechanism behind\ntheir impact on disability, and delineate the interplay be-\ntween and among functional limitations and disability across\ntime. To address these issues, the present investigation relies\nThe Disablement Process: The Proposed Model\non a National Agenda for the Prevention of Disabilities\nand Jette (1994), the main pathway in the disablement\nprocess is as follows: pathology (presence of disease) leads\nto impairments (anatomic and structural abnormalities),\nwhich in turn lead to functional limitations (restrictions in\nbasic physical and mental actions), which then lead to\ndisability (difficulty doing activities of daily life). Figure 1\nmodels the main pathway along with major risk factors that\nmodify the pathway. The progression of steps leading to\nphysical disability is reflected in the direction of the causal\nlinkages and in the time of measurement selections. Pathol-\nogy and impairments are grouped as one stage because of the\ninherent difficulty of separating them in self-report surveys.\nThe terminology and linkages are developed below. It\nshould be noted that this scheme is basically consistent with\nthe World Health Organization's (1980) International Clas-\nsification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps\n(ICIDH), although the terminology differs. The ICIDH uses\nthe terms \"disability\" and \"handicap\" whereas Nagi, and\nVerbrugge and Jette use \"functional limitations\" and \"dis-\nability,\" respectively, with somewhat different definitions\nComponents of the conceptual model. -- Several risk\nfactors are thought to be associated with the disablement\nprocess. These factors are usually permanent or long-\nstanding features of an individual. As such, they exist, or are\nin place, before the disablement process begins and are seen\nas causes that predispose the individual to chronic and\nenduring impacts. Consistent with their predisposing role\nand the progression of becoming disabled, risk factors are\nrepresented in the model as primary, both causally and\ntemporally, by their occupying the farthest left position of\nexplanatory factors. Their role as temporally primary is also\nrepresented through their being measured in 1984, and\nthrough including only individuals who report no functional\nlimitations or disabilities in 1984. For this subset of elderly\npersons the order of occurrence is clear and will permit a\nbetter sense of the progression (Branch, 1985; Guralnik et\nFigure 1. Proposed conceptual model for the disablement process.\nincludes the relevant risk factors from among those available\nfor meaningful analysis.\nTwo types of risk factors are represented. One set includes\nthose risk factors that are sociodemographic in nature: sex,\nage, and education. Unfortunately, it was not possible to\ninclude race/ethnicity because the majority of the sample\nwas Caucasian (93.6%, with only 5.4% African American\nand 1.0% a race/ethnicity other than Caucasian or African\nAmerican). The other set includes two risk factors that\nreflect life-style and/or behavioral aspects: body mass and\nfrequency of walking a mile per week. We've included only\none item to measure physical activity, which is a limited\ndefinition. However, that item is simple and relatively\nstraightforward: it focuses on and requests specific informa-\ntion about actual amount of activity in a way that is readily\ninterpreted by respondents. This is in contrast to other items\nwhich were available in the Longitudinal Study of Aging\n(Kovar, Fitti, and Chyba, 1992) but potentially introduced\nmore bias due to individual interpretations and definitions of\nexercise (i.e., Do you feel that you get as much exercise as\nyou need, or less than you need? Do you follow a regular\nroutine of physical exercise?).\nAs represented in Figure 1, the two sets of risk factors are\nnot seen as independent of each other. Rather, the basic\ndemographic risk factors are seen as impacting on the life-\nstyle and behavioral risk factors. In turn, both sets are\nhypothesized to causally relate to pathology/impairments.\nThe main pathways for risk factors are through their role\nas a cause that prompts pathology/impairments. Thus, the\nrole played by education in the disablement process is\nhypothesized to be through its relationship to body mass,\nfrequency of walking, and pathology/impairments. How-\never, because of the importance of sex and age, their direct\nand indirect effects (e.g., through their relationship to\npathology/impairments, and functional limitations) on dis-\nablement were evaluated (Rogers, Rogers, and Belanger,\n1992). In addition, for well elderly persons, less is known\nabout the relationships of age and sex to disablement\nmodel directly links sex and age to all subsequent stages in\nthe process.\nThe behavioral and life-style risk factors are depicted as\nmodifying the main pathway through their relationship to the\nonset of pathology/impairments and functional limitations.\nThis is consistent with previous research which suggests that\nbody mass and physical activity levels relate to the onset\nof disability, regardless of the presence of pathology/\nimpairments (e.g., Guralnik and Kaplan, 1989; Harris at al.,\nmass and frequency of walking a mile will have significant\ndirect and indirect effects (through their relationship to\npathology/impairments) on functional limitations such that\ntheir total impact will play a cumulative and costly role in the\nonset of the disablement process.\nPathology/Impairments are abnormalities and dysfunc-\ntions of specific body systems and, for the present purposes,\nrepresent pathology which has crossed clinical threshold\nand been diagnosed. Associations between pathology/\nimpairments and disability have been found for several\nhealth conditions (for an excellent review of longitudinal\nfindings see Boult et al., 1994), and research suggests that\ndifferent conditions may have different impacts on the tran-\nsition from physical independence to disability (e.g., Guc-\nfour types of pathology/impairments which have been iden-\ntified in previous research as having an important relation-\nship with disability: diabetes (e.g., Mor et al., 1989), cardio-\nvascular diseases (e.g., Boult et al., 1994; Guccione et al.,\nvision-related diseases or pathology/impairments (e.g.,\nthat the impact of these conditions is through the intermedi-\nate stage of functional limitations, and thus only indirectly\ndo they affect disability.\nFunctional Limitations are restrictions in performing fun-\ndamental physical activities. Consistent with previous repre-\nsentations, these physical actions provide the pathway by\nwhich pathology/impairments and life-style risk factors in-\nfluence the individual's abilities to perform physical and\nsocial activities (e.g., instrumental activities of daily living\nsuch as shopping for personal items). Because of the impor-\ntant role functional limitations play in the pathway from risk\nfactors and pathology/impairments to disability, two aspects\nare differentiated: restrictions associated with the upper\nbody (e.g., reaching up) and the lower body (e.g., walking).\nPrior work indicates that this distinction is conceptually and\nclinically useful (e.g., Jette, Branch, and Berlin, 1990;\nfunctional limitations are causally linked to disability.\nDisability refers to difficulty experienced in carrying out\nactivities in any domain of life. In general, disability results\nfrom health and physical problems. The model and defini-\ntions are applicable to any domain of life, including, for\nexample, hobbies (Verbrugge and Jette, 1994). For the\npurposes of this analysis, we focus on IADL disability\nresulting from physical health pathology/impairments and\nfunctional limitations. This domain of daily living focuses\non household management (e.g., preparing meals). It would\nhave been preferable also to model basic ADLs. However,\nthe number of difficulties with basic activities of daily living\nreported among the nondisabled in 1988 were too few to\nmodel (about 4% reported any difficulties with basic ADLs).\nCross-sectional and longitudinal components of the pro-\ncess. -- It should be noted that the risk factors (sociodemo-\ngraphic and life-style) and the pathology/impairments were\nmeasured at the same time (i.e., 1984). Their true causal\norder is not known. Rather, we imposed a causal order that is\nconsistent with the theoretical underpinnings of the model.\nHowever, the theoretical model also recognizes the role of\nfeedback mechanisms. Thus, it is important to recognize that\nthe relationship between pathology/impairments and the risk\nfactors of body mass and frequency of walking a mile is not\nsimply a one-way relationship. It is not possible to model\nthese feedback relationships because direct questions about\nphysical activity and body mass are not included in the\nfollow-up interviews.\nThe causal relationship between functional limitations and\ndisability warrants clarification. We have represented this\ndata for those relationships are cross-sectional. The repre-\nsentation is consistent with theory and a central premise of\nthe model: Functional limitations are a main driving force\nbehind the downward-spiraling in the disablement process.\nFor example, an individual may have difficulty walking (a\nfunctional limitation), and yet still be able to shop for\npersonal items, albeit slowly and painfully (e.g., because\narthritis of the left knee has caused difficulty in walking). As\nthe arthritis progresses, or other pathologies are experi-\nenced, further functional limitations may result such that the\nperson is no longer able to walk even slowly or painfully,\nwhich can lead to a situation where the person can only shop\nwith a lot of difficulty, or stops shopping altogether (disabil-\nity). Thus, functional limitations in 1988 impact on disabil-\nity in 1988, both of which impact on functional limitations in\nthe main pathway for understanding disability in 1990. By\nseparating upper and lower body functional limitations, it\nwas possible to evaluate whether lower body functional\nlimitations played a more important role in the disablement\nprocess, relative to upper body functional limitations and\nprior disability levels. The linkage from 1988 disability to\n1990 disability is included to control for prior disability.\nThe proposed causal order between functional limitations\nand disability is further supported by the prevalence rates\nacross time for functional limitations and IADL disability.\nThat is, the percent of respondents reporting some difficulty\nwith functional limitations, especially for lower body func-\ntioning, exceeded the percent reporting IADL disabilities.\nThese percents increased over time, with the percents for\nfunctional limitations remaining larger than those for IADL\ndisabilities. The overall patterns reinforce the proposed\ncausal order and suggest that Figure 1 is the most fruitful\navenue for model building, rather than proposing another\ncausal order between functional limitations and disabilities.\nMETHOD\nSample and Data\nThe data came from the Longitudinal Study of Aging\n(LSOA) conducted by the National Center for Health Statis-\ntics and the National Institute on Aging. The LSOA was a\nspecial six-year follow-up to the 1984 National Health\nInterview Survey's Supplement on Aging (SOA). We\nprovide a brief overview below, and refer the interested\nreader to Kovar, Fitti, and Chyba (1992) for more detailed\ninformation.\nThe National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is an an-\nnual survey of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of\nthe United States. It is designed to collect information on\nhealth and health service utilization. The 1994 NHIS in-\ncluded a special supplement, the Supplement on Aging\n(SOA), which was designed to collect information on the\nhealth, social functioning, and living arrangements of indi-\nviduals aged 55 or older. These two surveys constitute the\nbaseline survey for the LSOA, which was designed to\nmeasure changes in functioning and living arrangements for\na cohort of older Americans. Follow-up interviews were\nthe sample frame for the LSOA included 7,527 SOA partici-\npants aged 70 years or older. Although a smaller subsample\nwas interviewed in 1986 because of budget constraints, the\ndata base for our research is the larger sample of 7,527\nparticipants. For the present analysis, the 1986 interview\nwas not included to ensure the largest possible number of\neligible respondents and a greater likelihood of disability\ntransitions for this group of well elderly persons.\nThis analysis in based on LSOA respondents who in 1984\nreported no functional limitations and no disability (defined\nbelow). A similar approach has been used by others and\nproven to be very useful for refining our understanding of the\nonset of disability (e.g., Branch, 1985; Guralnik and Ka-\nrespondents reporting no functional limitations or disabili-\nrelevant variables at baseline (i.e., risk factors and\ninterviews; they comprise the study sample.\nIn order to minimize capitalization on chance, the subset\nof nondisabled elderly respondents was randomly split into\ntwo subsamples for analysis. Chi-squared tests of signifi-\ncance and multivariate analysis of variance tests indicated\nthat the two groups did not differ significantly with regard to\nany of the relevant variables.\nAbout two-thirds (68%) of the respondents in this study\nsample were female. The average age was about 74 years\nwere living alone at the time of the baseline survey, and this\npercent remained roughly the same at the follow-up inter-\nviews. The average level of education was about 11 years\nthe sample were Caucasian (93.6%).\nAbout 40 percent reported \"never\" as the frequency of\nwalking a mile per week (38.7%), with the average response\nbeing \"once a week.\" Most of the elderly respondents were\nof normal weight (76.2%), with about 20% being over-\nweight (18.2%), and 5.5% underweight. Few elderly per-\nsons reported having diabetes (4.5%). About one-fifth re-\nported vision-related problems (21.5%). Roughly 40 percent\nreported musculoskeletal problems (39.9%), and about 44\npercent reported cardiovascular problems (43.9%).\nMeasures\nRisk factors. -- The demographic risk factors were age\n(measured in actual years), sex (0 = female; 1 = male), and\nor more of college). Body mass was expressed as self-\nreported weight (kilograms) divided by the square of self-\nreported height (meters) and measured as under, normal, or\nabove weight. The normal range for body mass was defined\n(Thomas, 1993). These ranges, while being consistent with\nprevious research suggesting that a body mass index of 21 or\nless is a risk factor (e.g., Rudberg et al., 1993), also add sex-\nspecific information.\nThe physical activity item was frequency of walking a\nmile per week, ranging from \"never\" to \"every day\" (0 =\nnever; 1 = less than once a week; 2 = once a week; 3 = 2-\n3 times a week; 4 = 4-6 times a week; and 5 = every day).\nA variable measuring living arrangements (lives alone vs\nlives with spouse or others) was also evaluated as a risk\nfactor because some studies have found it to be a significant\nfactor in the disablement process (e.g., Mor et al., 1989).\nHowever, it exhibited no significant bivariate relationship to\nany of the functional limitations and disability measures, and\ntherefore was not included in any further analyses.\nThe four areas of Pathology/Impairments were measured\nas follows: presence of diabetes (0 = no; 1 = yes), number\nof cardiovascular problems (stroke; hardening of the arter-\nies; hypertension; rheumatic fever; rheumatic heart disease;\ncoronary heart disease; angina pectoris; myocardial infarc-\ntion; any other heart attack); number of musculoskeletal\nproblems (osteoporosis; broken hip; arthritis or rheuma-\ntism); and number of vision-related problems (cataracts;\nglaucoma; detached retina or other condition; blindness in\none or both eyes; trouble seeing even when wearing glasses).\nFor the Functional Limitation measures, each item was\nscored with a value of one representing difficulty performing\nthe item, and a zero representing no difficulty. Upper body\nfunctional status was the number of items the respondent\nreported difficulty performing (i.e., difficulty \"using your\nfingers to grasp or handle,\" \"reaching up over your head,\"\nand \"reaching out\") and could range from 0 to 3. This list is\nconsistent with Johnson and Wolinsky (1993), except that\nwe do not include the item assessing difficulty in sitting for\nmore than two hours. We excluded this item because it was\nLower body functional status was the total number of\nitems the respondent reported difficulty performing from\namong five items: difficulty \"walking a quarter of a mile,\"\n\"walking up 10 steps,\" \"standing or being on your feet for\nabout two hours,\" \"trouble stooping, crouching, kneel-\ning,\" and \"lifting or carrying something as heavy as 10\npounds.\" Our definition of lower body functional limita-\ntions is consistent with Johnson and Wolinsky (1993), ex-\ncept we use lifting 10 pounds instead of 25 pounds. We used\nthe 10-pound item to be consistent with the work of Nagi\nDisability. -- For inclusion in the study sample of nondis-\nabled elderly persons, at baseline (1984) respondents had to\nreport \"no difficulty\" with regard to both instrumental and\nbasic ADLs, although only instrumental ADLs were incorpo-\nrated in the model. The individual items assessing difficulty\nperforming basic and instrumental ADLs were assigned a\nvalue of zero for no difficulty and one for difficulty. Respon-\ndents who did not do an activity for other reasons were\nexcluded because it was not possible to determine if they were\nabled or disabled. Basic ADL items included \"bathing,\"\n\"eating,\" \"dressing,\" and \"toileting.\" Instrumental ADL\ndisability was measured by the total number of activities done\nwith difficulty (0 to 5) reported for the following: \"shop-\nping,\" \"preparing meals,\" \"managing money,\" \"using the\ntelephone,\" and \"doing light housework.\"\nData Analysis Strategy\nStructural equation modeling techniques were used to\nevaluate the models (Joreskog and Sorbom, 1989). An\nanalytic strategy involving two stages was developed to\nincorporate the advantages of a replicated design and to\nmaintain a reasonable ratio of number of respondents to\nnumber of parameters estimated. The first step involved\nanalyzing a model of the relationships among the baseline\nmeasures prior to analyzing the larger model. This step\nidentified significant relationships and permitted the trim-\nming of nonsignificant relationships among the risk factors\nand pathology/impairments. Linkages which were signifi-\ncant for either subsample were included in all further anal-\nyses. These linkages are discussed below in the section\non the relationships among risk factors and pathology/\nimpairments. The second step involved evaluating the pro-\nposed model for IADL disability for both subsamples. Eval-\nuation included examining significance of the proposed\ndirect and indirect effects, verifying the hypothesized insig-\nnificance of omitted linkages, and verifying the goodness of\nfit for the overall model. Determining the significance of the\nindirect effects was possible because LISREL provides\nstandard errors for indirect effects. Evaluating the possible\ncontributions of the omitted linkages was based on the\nmodification indices. Thus, it is possible to evaluate the\nlinkages which are hypothesized not to be significant.\nThe PRELIS program was used to screen all variables\n(Joreskog and Sorbom, 1988). Various options were evalu-\nated for the three variables exhibiting problematic skewness\nand kurtosis. Recoding the scale for the lower body func-\ntional limitation measure to four levels (i.e., 0, 1,2, and 3 or\nmore difficulties) eliminated its non-normality and kurtosis\nproblems. The other two variables (upper body functional\nlimitation measures and instrumental ADL measures) re-\nquired logarithmic transformations to make their distribu-\nRESULTS\nFor ease of presentation, the results for the proposed\nmodel (Figure 1) were organized around the stages of the\ndisability process. Thus, separate tables are presented for the\nrelationships among the risk factors and pathology/\nimpairments (the baseline measures; Table 1), the relation-\nships between these baseline measures and the onset of upper\nand lower functional limitations (the initial stage of transi-\ntion; Table 2), and the relationships among the functional\nlimitation and IADL disability measures (the progression of\ndisability; Table 3). It is important to emphasize that the\nresults summarized in Tables 1 through 3 were evaluated\nsimultaneously (Figure 1). Overall measures of fit for the full\nmodel are summarized at the bottom of Table 3.\nRelationships Among the Risk Factors\nand Pathology/Impairments\nTable 1 summarizes the coefficients for the relationships\nbetween the sociodemographic risk factors (sex, age, and\neducation) and the behavioral and life-style risk factors\n(frequency of walking and body mass) and the pathology/\nimpairments (diabetes and musculoskeletal) included based\non preliminary analyses. Similarly, Table 1 also summarizes\nthe linkages between the behavioral and life-style risk fac-\ntors (frequency of walking and body mass) and the\npathology/impairments (diabetes, cardiovascular, and vi-\nsion) included based on preliminary analyses.\nAs seen in Table 1, for both subsamples, men reported\nwalking a mile more frequently than women. Higher levels of\neducation were associated with less likelihood of being over-\nweight. No other relationship was significant for both sub-\nsamples. Table 1 summarizes the standardized maximum\nlikelihood coefficients and indicates significant relationships.\nRelationships Between Baseline Measures\nand Functional Limitations\nTable 2 summarizes the findings related to predicting the\nonset of upper and lower body functional limitations. As\nseen in Table 2, overall there was a paucity of replicated sig-\nnificant linkages among risk factors and the onset of func-\ntional limitations in 1988. The risk factors and pathology/\nimpairments were more strongly related to the onset of lower\nbody functional limitations in 1988 than to upper body\nfunctional limitations in 1988 as reflected in the amount of\nexplained variance. Table 2 includes these values along with\nthe standardized estimates. For both subsamples, the onset\nof lower body functional limitations was significantly asso-\nTable 1.

Upper body\nfunctional limitations were also significantly related to being\nolder. This was the only replicated relationship associated\nwith upper body functional limitations.\nRelationships Among Functional Limitations and Disability\nInstrumental ADL disability. -- Figure 2 summarizes the\nreplicated, significant linkages for the development of IADL\ndisability (i.e., the significant findings from Tables 1, 2, and\n3). Taken together, the results confirm the basic premise that\nloss of basic physical function is an important intermediary\nstage in the disability process, and suggest that lower body\nfunction may be more of a factor than upper body function in\nthe early stages of instrumental ADL disability.\nTable 3 summarizes the coefficients for the proposed\nrelationships among the functional limitations and IADL\ndisability. Of the risk factors and pathology/impairments,\nonly sex and age are included in Table 3 because, as depicted\nin Figure 1, only they had proposed direct linkages to the\nonset of disability in 1988, and the onset and progression of\nfunctional limitations and disability in 1990. All other risk\nfactors and the pathology/impairments measured in 1984\nwere hypothesized to have an impact only through their\nrelationship with the onset of functional limitations in 1988.\nThis is consistent with the basic premise that functional\nlimitation is the main pathway for the onset of disability.\nFigure 2.

This further supports the premise\nthat risk factors' main impact is through their relationship\nwith the onset of functional limitations. Consistent with\nexpectation (Figure 1), lower and upper body functional\nLower body functional limitations, but not upper body\nfunctional limitations, were significantly related to instru-\nmental ADL disability in 1988. However, both lower and\nupper body functional limitations in 1990 were significantly\nLower body functional limitations in 1988 predicted\nlower body and upper body functional limitations in 1990.

In contrast to predicting\ninitial onset of IADL disability in 1988, both upper body and\nlower body functional limitations were significant predictors\nof IADL disability in 1990. Lower body functioning seemed\nto retain more of a role, even though upper body functioning\nwas now significant.\nOverall Measures of Goodness-of-Fitfor the Model\nIt is useful to have an overall sense of how well the model\nfit the data. Although we presented the substantive findings\nbased on stages of the conceptual model (Figure 1), it is\nimportant to reiterate that the full model was evaluated.\nEstimates of several measures of goodness-of-fit were evalu-\nated and are presented at the bottom of Table 3.\nTaken as a whole, the model fit the data very well for both\nsubsamples. The goodness-of-fit index (GFI), the adjusted\ngoodness-of-fit index (AGFI), and the normed fit index\n(NFI) are above the recommended value of .900, with some\nindices approaching the ideal value of 1.000.\nIn addition, the modification indices supported the pro-\nposed model and the premise that functional limitations are\nthe main driving force in the disablement process. That is, the\nmodification indices supported the theoretical position that\nthe critical role of baseline risk factors and pathology/\nimpairments in the disability process is through their relation-\nship to functional limitations in 1988. Further, the modifica-\ntion indices supported the proposed linkages representing the\ninterplay between functional limitations and disability across\ntime. That is, the findings reinforce the hypothesized primary\npath by which functional limitation in 1988 impacts on\ndisability in 1990 as being through functional limitation in\n1990. Only five of the meaningful modification indices ex-\nceeded a cutpoint of 6.63 (the chi-square value associated\nwith 1 degree of freedom and .01 significance level). Of\nthese, none was replicated across subsamples. Apparently,\nincluding these linkages would not make a significant contri-\nbution and need not be incorporated in the model.\nDISCUSSION\nThese results provide further support to the role that\nlower-extremity function plays in predicting subsequent on-\nset of disability (Guralnik et al., 1995). Thus, consistent\nwith Nagi's conceptual framework, the importance of func-\ntional limitations as an intermediary driving force in the\ndisablement process should not be ignored. In addition, the\nresults confirm the premise that focusing on physical activity\nlevels is a fruitful intervention strategy for preventing dis-\nability, especially for older women. These relationships\nwere demonstrated through evaluating a model which incor-\nporated the theoretical work of Nagi and allowed for clearer\ninferences regarding causal order and the interplay among\nfunctional limitations and instrumental ADL disabilities\nacross time by establishing a time-sequence among the risk\nfactors and pathology/impairments, and the onset of func-\ntional limitations and IADL disabilities.\nJohnson and Wolinsky (1993) recently examined cross-\nsectional interrelationships among various disability concepts\nusing structural equation models. They reported that upper\nand lower functional limitations, rather than disease, were the\nmajor correlates of disability. The results of our longitudinal\nmodel clarify the causal ordering and interplay among func-\ntional limitations and disability suggested by this earlier\nwork. Consistent with Nagi's basic disability model, behav-\nioral risk factors and underlying pathology/impairments af-\nfect the subsequent onset of disability through their impact on\nfunctional limitations. Functional limitations, in turn, have a\ndirect and consistent impact on incidence of IADL disability.\nFor the most part, disease and life style do not directly affect\ndisability.\nIn contrast to Johnson and Wolinsky (1993) but consistent\nwith other investigators (Guralnik et al., 1995; Jette,\nBranch, and Berlin, 1990), we found that lower extremity\nfunctional limitation was a stronger determinant of subse-\nquent IADL disability than upper extremity functional limi-\ntation. Only lower extremity functional limitation was re-\nlated to subsequent degree of disability. And, although both\nupper and lower extremity limitations were influential on the\nincidence of IADL disability by 1990, lower extremity\nfunctional limitation was a stronger predictor of disability\nthan upper extremity. In fact, in one subsample, lower\nextremity functional limitation was a stronger predictor of\nsubsequent disability than previous disability level. These\nfindings probably reflect the important role of lower extrem-\nity function in the performance of complex, strenuous activi-\nties such as shopping, housekeeping, and food preparation.\nThe findings from these analyses further clarify the causal\nmechanism behind previous findings from single-equation\ncross-sectional and longitudinal analyses that level of physi-\ncal activity is an important and consistent predictor of\nof walking a mile had an indirect impact on incidence of\nIADL disability through its direct effect on level of lower\nextremity functional limitation. The frequency with which\nboth men and women walked a mile each week in 1984 was a\nsignificant determinant of lower extremity functional limita-\ntion in 1988. This finding lends support to those who wish to\nattribute a causal linkage between maintaining an active life\nstyle and protection against functional decline in later life.\nThe result for frequency of walking a mile lends further\nsupport to recent work that advocates the potential beneficial\neffects of reactivating older adults as a means of primary and\nsecondary prevention of disability in later life (Fiatarone et\nIn the present analyses, physical activity was measured by\na single item: frequency of walking a mile per week. It is\nunfortunate that additional items which met our criterion for\nmeasuring physical activities were not available. Although\nfrequency of walking provides a limited definition, the\nfindings are important for several reasons. One, the findings\nare consistent with expectations and other research, and thus\nlend further support to the importance of activity. Two, the\nfindings suggest that even a simple, easily prescribed activ-\nity such as walking a mile per week can make a difference.\nThat is, by focusing on a particular activity which is rela-\ntively simple and clearly defined, an important piece of\ninformation has been highlighted for those trying to reacti-\nvate sedentary elderly persons who might be intimidated by\n\"exercise\" programs and equipment.\nWhen controlling for functional limitations and disability\nat baseline, sex was not an independent, replicated predictor\nof onset of either functional limitations or disabilities in 1988\nor 1990. This is consistent with findings reported by others,\nKatz et al. (1983). The counterbalancing effects of higher\nsurvival in females and greater likelihood of high function-\ning among surviving males is one explanation of this pattern\n(e.g., Guralnik and Kaplan, 1989). That is, there are small\ndifferences in average remaining disability-free years but\nsuch differences do not reflect the large differences in life\nexpectancy. By definition, the model evaluates the disability\nprocess for respondents who were nondisabled in 1984 and\nwho survived and were reinterviewed through 1990.\nAlthough sex did not have any replicated significant direct\neffects, there were some important significant indirect ef-\nfects. These important indirect effects were predominantly\nplayed out through the relationship between sex and activity\nlevel. Being female was associated with lower levels of\nactivity, and thus, in turn, indirectly associated with more\nlower body functional limitations and instrumental ADL\ndisabilities in 1988, and more upper and lower body func-\ntional limitations in 1990. The indirect effects of sex on the\ndisablement process underscore the potential benefits el-\nderly women could experience with increased levels of\nactivity.\nThe overall pattern of results associated with age and\nmusculoskeletal problems further reinforces the importance\nof the intermediary role of lower and upper body functional\nlimitations. That is, being older was associated with the\ninitial onset of lower and upper body functional limitations\nin 1988, but, as with sex of the respondent, age had no\nreplicated independent effects on the emergence of disability\nwas associated with the onset of lower body functional\nlimitations in 1988. Again, it is worth noting that age did not\nand there was no indication that musculoskeletal problems\nhad an effect on disability independent of its relationship\nwith lower body functioning. Both age and musculoskeletal\nproblems did have important significant indirect effects on\ndisability, predominantly via their relationship with lower\nThe pattern of findings and the goodness-of-fit indices all\nindicate that the proposed model fit the data very well, and\nthus support the basic premise that functional limitations\nlead to disability and drive the disablement process. How-\never, a time-ordered sequence was imposed on the cross-\nsectional data (i.e., functional limitations in 1988 causally\nrelated to level of disability in 1988) and the longitudinal\nrelationships (i.e., functional limitations in 1988 causally\nrelated directly to functional limitations in 1990 and only\nindirectly related to disability in 1990). Although based on\ntheory and previous research, caution is warranted without\nhaving more and shorter time intervals to allow a finer\nanalysis of the time-ordered sequencing of the proposed\nprocess. In lieu of such information, another model was\nevaluated which did not impose a causal ordering between\nand allowed upper and lower functional limitations and\ndisability in 1988 to each causally impact on upper and lower\nfunctional limitations, and disability in 1990. The results\nfrom this analysis (not shown) also lend support to the\nproposed time-ordered sequence. Lower body functional\neven after controlling for disability level in 1988 for both\nsubsamples. This in in contrast to the longitudinal findings\nfor disability. For both subsamples, disability in 1988 did\nnot significantly predict upper or lower functional limita-\ntions in 1990 after controlling for prior levels of functional\nlimitations.\nThere are four major conceptual areas which need to be\nrefined and expanded in future work for a fuller understand-\ning of the disablement process. One area deals with extending\nthe model to understand other disability domains, including\nactivities of daily living. This is particularly important be-\ncause prior research indicates that the importance of upper\nand lower functional limitations may be a function of whether\none is evaluating basic ADLs or instrumental ADLs (e.g.,\nJette, Branch, and Berlin, 1990). A second area focuses on\nexpanding the model to include reactions and adjustments\nmade in response to limitations and disabilities (e.g., Avlund,\nDavidsen, and Schultz-Larsen, 1995). A third area deals with\nevaluating race as a risk factor. The cumulating evidence\nsuggests that there are important differences between Cauca-\nsians and African Americans, and important differences at\ndifferent points across the life span. Evaluating the process\nseparately by race would provide more complete information\nabout these issues and do the greatest justice to the subtle but\nimportant trends that have been observed (Gibson, 1991;\nGibson and Jackson, 1987; Manton, Patrick, and Johnson,\n1987). And finally, a fourth area reflects refinement of the\nmeasurement intervals and the measures. Expanding the\nmodel by including more measurement points and shorter\nintervals would help refine the causal relationship and provide\na better sense of intervention strategies.\nThe present findings provide not only a foundation for\nfuture model building, but also provide an important mes-\nsage for researchers and clinicians. Functional limitation is a\ncrucial intermediary stage and should be a focus of interven-\ntion strategies. The risk factor which emerged as a consistent\npredictor of the onset of functional limitations was frequency\nof walking a mile. Unlike some risk factors, frequency of\nwalking a mile may be more amenable to intervention.\nClearly, the results underscore the value of clinical trials\nfocusing on minimizing functional limitations as a strategy\nfor preventing disability, and the potential benefits elderly\nwomen especially could experience with increased physical\nactivity levels.\n"
