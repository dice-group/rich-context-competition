Using data from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nEpidemiologic Followup Study, the authors assessed the 20-year mortality experience of smokeless tobacco\nusers. Subjects aged 45 years or more at baseline (1971\u00ad1975) were categorized as either smokeless tobacco\nusers (n = 1,068) or non-smokeless tobacco users (n = 5,737). Subjects were further stratified by smoking status\nand gender. Proportional hazard ratios were used to assess associations. After adjustment for confounders, no\nassociation between smokeless tobacco use and all-cause (hazard ratio = 1.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.9,\nmortality was found. There was an increase in all cancer mortality of borderline significance among female\nsmokeless tobacco users (hazard ratio = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0, 2.8). The lung cancer mortality rate among combined\nusers (smokeless tobacco and cigarettes), based on the rates for exclusive smokeless tobacco users and\nexclusive smokers, was higher than expected, possibly because of heavier smoking among these subjects. The\nmortality experience of smokeless tobacco users was not significantly greater than that of non-tobacco users and\nwas appreciably less than that of cigarette smokers. Furthermore, combined use of smokeless tobacco and\ncigarettes did not increase overall mortality beyond that expected from use of the individual products.\ncardiovascular diseases; mortality; neoplasms; tobacco, smokeless\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; ICD-9, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision; NHANES I, First National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey; NHEFS, NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study.\nSmokeless tobacco use may be associated with an increase\nin oral cancer incidence (1) and with elevated rates of other\ncancers and cardiovascular disease (2\u00ad4). However, little\nresearch has been done on the relation between smokeless\ntobacco use and mortality from chronic diseases. We inves-\ntigated the relation between smokeless tobacco use and\nmortality from both broad classifications of chronic disease\nand several specific disease outcomes. Because information\non smoking status was available, we also compared the\neffects of smokeless tobacco use with that of cigarette\nsmoking and investigated the mortality associated with the\ncombined use of these two tobacco products.\nThere is growing interest in the possible adverse health\neffects of smokeless tobacco because of the increasing prev-\nalence of smokeless tobacco use among young adult White\nmales (5, 6) and the role of smokeless tobacco as a nicotine\nreplacement for cigarette smoking (7).

One national\nsurvey found that, among current smokeless tobacco users,\none third were former smokers (12), suggesting that smoke-\nless tobacco is occasionally used as a substitute for ciga-\nrettes. Recently, some researchers have proposed smokeless\ntobacco as nicotine replacement therapy for inveterate ciga-\nrette smokers (13). The use of smokeless tobacco as a safe\nalternative to cigarette smoking requires a complete under-\nstanding of the risks associated with smokeless tobacco use.\nOur aims are to assess the potential increased mortality\nrisks associated with ever smokeless tobacco use in a repre-\nsentative sample of the US population and to evaluate the\neffects of the combined use of smokeless tobacco and ciga-\nrette smoking on mortality from chronic diseases.\nData sources for determination of mortality risk\nassociated with smokeless tobacco use\nWe used data from the First National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES I) and the NHANES I\nEpidemiologic Followup Study (NHEFS) to determine\nwhether any increased mortality risks were associated with\nsmokeless tobacco use. The prospective nature of the data\ncollection provided a unique opportunity to examine\nmultiple mortality outcomes over an approximate 20-year\nfollow-up period. The wide range of available information\non a variety of risk factors allowed us to control for many\npotential confounders.\nThe survey design and data collection methods of\nNHANES I and NHEFS have been described elsewhere (14\u00ad\n19). Briefly, NHANES I was a national probability sample\nof the noninstitutionalized US population conducted from\nwomen of childbearing age. NHANES I used a multistage\nsampling design leading to unequal probabilities for selec-\ntion of sample subjects. The initial survey included in-person\ninterviews covering a wide array of health behaviors, as well\nas a physical examination. The NHEFS surveys were\nyears of age who underwent a physical examination in 1971\u00ad\n(32 percent) subjects were identified as deceased, with death\ncertificates available for 98 percent of the decedents.\nExposure variable\nOnly a random sample (n = 3,847) of all subjects in\nNHANES I were asked about smokeless tobacco use at base-\nline, but all subjects successfully interviewed during the\nused to infer smokeless tobacco status at baseline when\nnecessary. Subjects reporting current smokeless tobacco use\nconsidered ever smokeless tobacco users (n =1,503) in this\nstudy. Subjects reporting neither current use nor ever use in\neither survey were considered never smokeless tobacco\nwho had ever smoked (\"combined\" users), and 46 (3.1\npercent) with unknown smoking status.\nConfounding variables\nThe demographic variables considered in this analysis\ninclude age at examination, race, sex, region of residence\n(Northeast, Midwest, South, West), and poverty index ratio.\nA poverty index ratio equal to 1.0 designates the poverty\nlevel, with ratios less than 1.0 below and ratios greater than\n1.0 above poverty level. A poverty index ratio was calcu-\nlated for only a sample of subjects in NHANES I (n =\n11,348). Definitions of these variables are provided in the\nPlan and Operation of the Health and Nutrition Examination\nCigarette smoking information was gathered on only a\nsample of subjects in NHANES I. Pack-years of smoking\nwere calculated by multiplying the reported average\nnumber of cigarettes smoked daily by the duration smoked\ndivided by 20 (1 pack = 20 cigarettes). For subjects whose\nsmoking information was not obtained in NHANES I,\nsmoking status and pack-years at baseline were inferred\npossible. Other tobacco habits such as pipe or cigar use\nwere not considered in the formation of tobacco exposure\ncategories (i.e., a subject who did not use smokeless\ntobacco or smoke cigarettes but did smoke a pipe would be\nconsidered a non-tobacco user).\nNutritional information was obtained via a 24-hour recall\ndietary questionnaire and was asked of only a sample of the\nNHANES I subjects at baseline (n = 11,348). Standard food-\ncomposition data were used to calculate nutrient intake (20).\nOther potential confounders for which information was\navailable from either the baseline interview or the physical\nexamination include alcohol consumption, recreational\nphysical activity, body mass index, blood pressure, serum\ncholesterol, and family history (parents, siblings, or chil-\ndren) of cancer.\nOutcome variables\nBoth underlying and multiple cause-of-death codes, using\nInternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision\n(ICD-9), codes obtained from the death certificate, were\nused to categorize deaths. The underlying cause of death was\nused to calculate hazard ratios for the broad classifications of\ndisease, whereas multiple cause-of-death codes were used to\ncalculate hazard ratios for specific causes of death. Dece-\ndents identified only through proxy interview (n = 107) were\nnot included in this analysis because no ICD-9 code was\navailable from the data set.\nThis analysis was limited to White subjects and Black\nsubjects, because of the small number of subjects in the\n\"other\" race category (n = 172). Because of the differences\nin age between exclusive smokeless tobacco users and non-\ntobacco users (table 1) and the low prevalence of smokeless\ntobacco use among subjects less than 45 years of age, the\nmortality analyses were restricted to those subjects 45\u00ad75\nStatistical analysis\nThe distribution of potential confounding variables was\ncalculated for the four tobacco categories (non-tobacco\nusers, exclusive smokeless tobacco users, exclusive\nsmokers, and combined smokeless tobacco users and\nsmokers). The Cox proportional hazards model was used to\ncalculate both the crude and the adjusted hazard ratios. Most\nTABLE 1.

Follow-up time was\ncalculated from the date of examination to the time the\nsubject died, the time the subject was last known alive, or the\nendpoint of the study. Subjects lost to follow-up (i.e., not\ntraced in any of the four studies of the NHEFS) were\nexcluded from the analyses (n = 100). Subjects with a preex-\nisting condition at baseline were excluded for analyses of\nthat particular condition (e.g., subjects reporting stroke\nhistory at baseline were excluded from all analyses of stroke\noutcomes). To account for the complex survey design and\nthe oversampling of certain populations, SUDAAN software\nwas used to conduct the majority of the analyses. SUDAAN\nsoftware (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle\nPark, North Carolina) is a software package specifically\ndesigned to analyze data from complex surveys that incorpo-\nrate multistage sampling designs and unequally weighted\nStandardized mortality ratios were calculated as the\nmeasure of effect for oral cancer. Expected numbers were\nbased on mortality rates from the National Center for Health\nStatistics for 1982, the approximate midpoint of the follow-\nup period.\nRESULTS\nThere were 1,068 smokeless tobacco users in this cohort\nnever smokers. Exclusive smokeless tobacco users were\nolder (mean age = 64.9 years), poorer (mean poverty index\nratio = 1.8), and more likely to reside in the South than other\nsubjects (table 1). Crude differences between smokeless\ntobacco users and other subjects also were found in the\nfrequency of alcohol intake (they drink less often than\nsmokers), fruit and vegetable intake (less than smokers and\nnon-tobacco users), and recreational physical exercise (less\nthan smokers and non-tobacco users). Crude blood pressure\nand body mass index levels were higher among exclusive\nsmokeless tobacco users than for other tobacco categories.\nIntakes of vitamin A, vitamin C, and dietary fat also differed\nacross the four tobacco use categories.\nAfter adjustment for age, race, gender, and poverty status,\nexclusive smokeless tobacco users did not experience statis-\ntically significant increased mortality from all causes\n(hazard ratio = 1.1, 95 percent confidence interval (CI): 0.9,\nor all cardiovascular outcomes (hazard ratio = 1.1, 95\npercent CI: 0.8, 1.5) compared with non-tobacco users.\nTable 2 describes the relation between exclusive smokeless\ntobacco use and the causes of death for which there were at\nleast 30 deaths, stratified by gender. Male smokeless tobacco\nusers experienced statistically nonsignificant increases in\nmortality from endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases\nand immunity disorders (hazard ratio = 2.4, 95 percent CI:\n0.7, 8.8) and from diseases of the digestive system (hazard\ntobacco users experienced an increase in mortality from all\nborderline significance.\nTable 3 presents hazard ratios from several specific\nchronic diseases. Male exclusive smokeless tobacco users\ndid not experience significant increases in mortality for any\ntype of cancer considered. The increased mortality from lung\ncancer among female smokeless tobacco users (never or ever\nsmokers), although statistically significant, was based on\nonly three deaths and four deaths, respectively. Smokeless\ntobacco use was not associated with significant increases in\nmortality for ischemic heart disease or stroke in either\ngender.\nTABLE 2.

After\ncontrolling for age, gender, race, and poverty status, we\nfound that smokeless tobacco users did not experience\nhigher mortality than did non-tobacco users in this cohort.\nAfter stratification by gender, no statistically significant\nincreases in mortality were found for males. Among females,\na borderline statistically significant increase was found for\nall cancer mortality.\nFew studies have investigated mortality in relation to\nsmokeless tobacco use. Results from the National Mortality\nFollowback Survey showed that smokeless tobacco use was\nnot associated with increased risk for all cancer, oral cancer,\nor cancer of the digestive organs (22). Zahm et al. (23) found\na nonsignificant increase in soft tissue sarcoma among US\nveterans who had ever chewed tobacco or used snuff (rela-\nsarcoma originating in the head, neck, and face region\namong smokeless tobacco users. They found no soft tissue\nsarcoma deaths among those who used smokeless tobacco\nonly. They did find an increase in mortality from buccal\ncancer among smokeless tobacco users (relative risk = 3.0,\nincreased mortality rate for oral/pharyngeal cancer was\nfound in West Virginia, the state with the highest prevalence\nof smokeless tobacco use, compared with the United States\nas a whole (24). Although few in number, these studies\ngenerally support the results of our analysis.\nThe scant body of epidemiologic evidence for smokeless\ntobacco use and cardiovascular disease mortality differs\nfrom our results. A study of Swedish construction workers\nfound a small but statistically significant increased risk for\nall cardiovascular disease mortality (relative risk = 1.4, 95\npercent CI: 1.2, 1.6), ischemic heart disease, and stroke (3).\nHowever, common risk factors for cardiovascular disease\nsuch as blood pressure, exercise, diet, and alcohol were not\ncontrolled and may explain the increased risk. Of note in the\nSwedish study was the absence of an increased risk for all\nsimilar to our results. Another study from Sweden found a\nsmall but statistically nonsignificant increased risk from\nfatal myocardial infarction (including sudden death) among\nAlthough smokeless tobacco users in the present study\nexperienced no increased risk in cardiovascular disease\nmortality, smokers experienced a small but statistically\nsignificant increased risk for ischemic heart disease. This\ndisparity supports evidence that something other than nico-\ntine is causing the increase in cardiovascular mortality (25).\nAlthough oral cancer is the adverse effect most accepted as\na consequence of smokeless tobacco use (1), we found no\nassociation between oral cancer mortality and ever smoke-\nless tobacco use. Although the number of observed deaths\namong exclusive smokeless tobacco users was too small to\ncalculate a hazard ratio, the number of expected deaths in\nthis cohort was less than one. The reasons why smokeless\ntobacco leads to an increase in oral cancer incidence but not\nto an increase in oral cancer mortality may be due to\nadvances in cancer detection and treatment or to insufficient\nfollow-up time for deaths to occur among a small number of\ncases.\nThe validity of the data should not be a concern, as the\nhazard ratio for oral cancer mortality among cigarette\nsmokers is similar to the findings of other studies (26). Simi-\nlarly, the magnitude of association between cigarette\nsmoking and lung cancer (hazard ratio = 13.2, 95 percent CI:\n4.5, 38.2 among males) is consistent with that observed in\nother studies, as is the finding of greater lung cancer\nmortality among current smokers than former smokers (27).\nThe complex survey design and oversampling of certain\npopulations required the use of SUDAAN software to\nanalyze the data set. However, results reflecting a small\nnumber of outcomes have been found to strongly influence\nestimates (28). Although we found statistically nonsignifi-\ncant associations between smokeless tobacco use by males\nand diseases of the endocrine and digestive systems and\nTABLE 5. Observed and expected deaths according to tobacco status: oral\ncancer, First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic\n SMR, standardized mortality ratio; CI, confidence interval.\n Indirectly adjusted only for age.\nObserved\ndeaths\nExpected\ndeaths*\nstatistically significant increases in all cancer and lung\ncancer mortality among female smokeless tobacco users,\nthese results could be due to outcomes experienced by a\nsmall number of subjects having large sample weights. The\nassociation for all cancer among female smokeless tobacco\nusers was influenced by a small number of deaths at two sites\n(three lung cancer deaths and two uterine cancer deaths\namong smokeless tobacco users). Future studies, including\nboth male and female subjects, should be conducted to deter-\nmine whether these associations with smokeless tobacco use\nare causal.\nAlthough the mortality rate among combined users was\nhigher than that expected from the individual rates, this\nresult is not likely due to a synergistic effect between smoke-\nless tobacco and cigarettes. The combined users smoked\nyears, respectively). The higher cigarette smoking dose, not\nthe use of smokeless tobacco, is likely leading to the\nincreased lung cancer mortality among combined users. A\npossible explanation is that combined users may be strongly\naddicted to nicotine and using smokeless tobacco in addition\nto cigarettes rather than as a substitute for them.\nThe apparent lack of an effect among combined users for\nischemic heart disease mortality is counterintuitive.\nCombined users smoked more than exclusive smokers did,\nyet their ischemic heart disease mortality was less than that\nof exclusive smokers. Combined users were more likely to\nbe former smokers than were exclusive smokers, possibly\naccounting for the decreased risk found here.\nOf the two oral cancer deaths among ever smokeless\ntobacco users (both White males), one was a current smoker\nand the other was a former smoker. However, these two\nobserved deaths were not more than expected in this cohort,\neven when limiting the analysis to White males. In this\ncohort, cigarette smoking was responsible for the increased\noral cancer mortality.\nOne limitation of this analysis is that the exposure cate-\ngory is based only on ever use of smokeless tobacco. There-\nfore, potential increases in mortality associated with current\nversus former use could not be determined. Similarly, no\ndose-response analysis could be done. Because of the lack of\ninformation on lifetime use, subjects who used smokeless\ntobacco once were categorized the same as those who used\nsmokeless tobacco many times.\nRouse (29) found that, among males who had ever tried\nsmokeless tobacco, 60 percent used it in the past year;\namong females who had tried it, 42 percent used it in the past\nyear. She also found that, among those who reported any\nlifetime use, 26 percent used it almost daily in the past year\n(29). Therefore, it may be a reasonable assumption that\nsmokeless tobacco users in our study were not one-time\nusers, with many having used smokeless tobacco regularly.\nAlso, the restriction to subjects 45 years of age or more\ncreated a homogeneous exposure group with respect to dura-\ntion of smokeless tobacco use. The majority of smokeless\ntobacco users initiate smokeless tobacco use prior to the age\nTobacco categories represent self-reported responses, and\nneither smokeless tobacco status nor smoking status was\nbiologically confirmed. Confounding variables were also\nself-reported (e.g., alcohol intake, physical activity).\nHowever, as this information was collected prospectively,\nthe potential for recall bias is much less than that found in\ncase-control studies.\nAlthough this analysis was restricted to subjects 45\u00ad75\nyears of age at baseline to create more similar comparison\ngroups with respect to unknown and uncontrolled\nconfounders, residual or uncontrolled confounding (e.g.,\nother tobacco habits or factors relating to survival) may\ncontribute to the results found in this study.\nBecause only a sample of individuals were asked about\ntheir tobacco habits in NHANES I, the results from 1971 to\n1975 were supplemented by information collected in the\nsome nondifferential misclassification of tobacco use, as\nproxies for subjects who died between the baseline interview\nand the initial follow-up). The expected effect would be a\nbias toward the null hypothesis of no association. However,\nas smokeless tobacco use is defined as only ever/never, this\neffect should be minimal.\nThis analysis represents one of the most comprehensive\nstudies of the relation between smokeless tobacco use and\nmortality. The 20-year follow-up period allowed ample time\nto investigate common outcomes among smokeless tobacco\nusers in a representative US population. Available data on a\nwide variety of risk factors allowed us to minimize the\npotential for confounding as an explanation for any results.\nOverall, we found no increased mortality for subjects who\nreported ever smokeless tobacco use when compared with\nsubjects who reported no tobacco use. The few increases in\nmortality that we discovered, although likely due to chance,\nshould be investigated further. Evidence from this study\nshows that smokeless tobacco use is a safer alternative than\ncontinued cigarette smoking. Mortality for exclusive smoke-\nless tobacco users is considerably less than mortality for\nexclusive smokers for all cancer (especially lung cancer) and\nfor ischemic heart disease. Further studies are needed to\ndetermine whether regular smokeless tobacco use is appre-\nciably more harmful than ever use and to determine whether\nthere is increasing risk with increasing amount or duration of\nuse of smokeless tobacco products.\n"
