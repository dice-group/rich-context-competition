Freedman1 and Linda G. Martin2\n1Polisher Research Institute, Horsham, Pennsylvania.\n2Population Council, New York, New York.\nTWO years ago, Freedman, Aykan, and Martin (2001)\nreported that the percentage of older Americans with\nsevere cognitive impairment had declined significantly from\nwere not explained by changes in demographic and socioeco-\nnomic composition or the prevalence of stroke, vision, or hear-\ning impairments. We concluded cautiously that older persons\nappeared to have better cognitive functioning at the end of the\ndecade. In a companion piece (Freedman, Aykan, & Martin,\n2002), we showed that these results were robust to a variety of\nassumptions about missing data, loss to follow-up, and the\ninstitutional population, and called for replication with future\nwaves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).\nIn today's issue of the Journal, Rodgers, Ofstedal, and\nHerzog (2003) provide this much-needed analysis of additional\nHRS waves. They conclude, quite the opposite--that there ap-\npears to have been little improvement--and call for future stud-\nies based on other data sources.\nLike so many other scientific matters of import, the question\nof late-life cognitive trends is not easily answered and research-\ners have called for additional investigation. Yet we are left to\nwonder: Will analyses of additional data sources bring us closer\nto the truth or simply add to the confusion?\nThese three analyses of the HRS join a small but growing set\nof studies of national trends in late-life cognition. Rodgers and\ncolleagues (2003) refer to several studies that draw upon the\nNational Long Term Care Survey, which points to declines in\ndementia among the chronically disabled from the early 1980s\nNational Mortality Followback Studies, Liao, McGee, Cao, and\nCooper (2000) showed significant declines in cognitive dys-\nfunction in the last year of life for men aged 65\u00ad84 years and\nwomen aged 65 years and older. In sum, thus far two surveys\nsuggest improvements, and a third provides inconsistent evi-\ndence that appears sensitive to analytic decisions.\nAs in the disability-trend literature, analysis of additional\nwaves and data sources (such as the National Health Interview\nSurvey, which recently added cognition measures) does not\nguarantee that the ``truth'' will be forthcoming. During the last\ndecade, for example, inconsistencies have emerged regard-\ning trends in limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs;\nFreedman, Martin, & Schoeni, 2002). The seven surveys that\nhave provided relevant information offer various strengths and\nweaknesses and differ in their definitions of disability, the age\ngroups covered, time periods, modes of data collection, rules\nabout proxy involvement, inclusion of institutional population,\nand effectiveness in minimizing loss to follow-up and non-\nresponse. A similar set of variations exist for the four national\nsurveys that now include questions on cognition.\nThese varied survey design features are compounded by the\ndistinct analytic decisions made by authors about nonresponse\nand coding of measures. Rodgers and colleagues (2003), for\nexample, cite several analytic differences between their study\ntreatment of sampled persons for whom proxies responded, the\nimputation methods for missing data, and the use of different\ncutoffs to identify those with severe impairment. A fourth key\ndifference that appears especially important in the analysis by\nRodgers and colleagues--controlling for prior testing--could\nnot be incorporated into the two-wave comparisons (Freedman\nimpossible to sort out how these analytic decisions contribute to\nthe inconsistencies.\nMoreover, measuring cognitive functioning may be even\nmore challenging than measuring limitations in ADLs or re-\nlated underlying physical limitations for three reasons. First,\ncognitive impairment is a complex, multidimensional concept\nencompassing disruptions of memory, language function, mo-\ntor activity execution, object recognition, abstract thinking,\ninformation processing, spatial orientation, and judgment. Yet\nthese concepts are not easily separated or measured, and despite\nseveral reliable clinical screens for dementia, no universally\naccepted survey instrument has emerged. The wide variation in\nmeasurement approaches--from proxy-assessments of memory\nto tests of recall for those able to participate in a survey--will\ninevitably complicate comparisons. Second, the mere presence\nof cognitive impairment increases the need for a proxy. On the\nbasis of the analysis by Freedman and colleagues (2001), for\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2003 by The Gerontological Society of America\nexample, we calculate that roughly 30\u00ad40% of older Americans\nliving in the community with severe cognitive impairment do\nnot respond for themselves, and roughly 35\u00ad50% of those with\nsevere cognitive impairment live in institutional settings, where\nproxy interviews are the rule rather than the exception. Surveys\nthat omit proxy assessments or the institutional population may\npaint a misleading portrait of national trends. Third, cognition\nis influenced by external stimuli, so interview circumstances mat-\nter, and, for those functioning at high enough levels to allow\nlearning, responses may be influenced by the number of times\nan individual is exposed to a test. The possibility of learning\neffects, along with the complications of nonrandom loss to\nfollow-up that often occur with panel designs, suggests that a\nrepeated cross-sectional design may be more appropriate for\nassessing national trends in cognition.\nThrough replication, scientists retest hypotheses and build\na body of knowledge. Yet varied survey features coupled with\nunique analytic decisions dilute the notion of replication, rais-\ning the possibility of inconsistent findings despite a single\nunderlying truth. Can researchers coordinate their future efforts\nto find the truth more efficiently? If scientists could agree to key\nanalytic decisions and vigorously examine the sensitivity of find-\nings, some unnecessary variation potentially could be elimi-\nnated. The disparate underlying survey designs and measures\nare more difficult to address, but an attempt at harmonization\nof measures across surveys and settings would be a useful next\nstep. Ultimately researchers may need a new data source, one\nthat provides repeated cross-sections of both the community\nand institutional population, to find the truth about trends in\nlate-life cognitive functioning.\n"
