The nature of one's motivation for exercise, as postulated by\nSelf-Determination Theory (SDT), may supply a missing and understudied link. The primary aim of this experimental study\nwas to examine the moderating influence of situational motivation from SDT on the relationship between an acute bout\nof preferred exercise, namely running (vs. control), and changes in positive affect. Forty-one active women attended two\nsessions to engage in (a) a 30-min moderate-intensity self-paced treadmill run and (b) a 30-min quiet activity (i.e., newspaper\nreading). Participants with high introjection versus those with low introjection reported a greater increase in positive affect\nfrom pre- to postrunning and a greater decrease in positive affect from pre- to postcontrol. A \"relief from guilt\" effect was\npostulated to explain these results. Motivational variables accounted for 7% of variance in postrun positive affect. Consistent\nwith SDT, running because one values this behavior and its benefits (i.e., identified regulation) was significantly associated\nwith postrun positive affect.\n",

Greater levels of positive affect have been identified\nas a hallmark quality of well-being (Russell, 2003). More\nspecifically, repeated satisfying exposure to short-term posi-\ntive affect states, such as those achievable with acute bouts\nof exercise, can lead to increased well-being (Lyubomirsky,\nAffect reflects the quality of a subjective feeling state and\nLazarus (2000) describes emotions (or affect) as motiva-\ntional, thus, involving reactions to adaptational goals in a\nperson's life. Affect can be characterized by two dimensions,\nnamely, valence (positive/negative) and activation (high\nactivation [HA]/low activation [LA]; Ekkekakis &\nPetruzzello, 2002). Whereas HA affect refers to an energetic\nstate and excitation, LA affect refers to a calm, relaxed or\ndepressed state. A dimensional definition facilitates the\ndetection and comparison of broader changes in affect in a\nbreadth of behavioral domains, such as exercise (Ekkekakis\nMeta-analytic evidence indicates that acute exercise has a\nmoderate, consistent effect on levels of positive affect (Reed\n& Ones, 2006). Although underexamined as an influential\nfactor in regular exercise engagement, repeated, positive\naffective experiences associated with individual (acute)\nexercise sessions may sustain motivation over time and this\ncan facilitate long-term exercise participation (Focht, 2009;\nKwan & Bryan, 2010). Indeed, according to Self-\nDetermination Theory (SDT) motivation and affective indi-\ncators of well-being are intricately connected (Deci & Ryan,\nand affect may be particularly evident in active, motivated\nindividuals who are experienced with exercise (Hoffman &\n1University of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nEva Gu\u00e9rin, Health and Exercise Psychology Lab, Montpetit Hall,\nUniversity of Ottawa, 125, University Pr, Ottawa, ON, K1N 6N5, Canada.\nEmail: eva.eg.guerin@gmail.com\nThe Moderating Influence of Situational\nMotivation on the Relationship Between\nPreferred Exercise and Positive Affect: An\nExperimental Study With Active Women\nEva Gu\u00e9rin1 and Michelle S. Fortier1\n Keywords\nexercise, positive affect, motivation, self-determination theory, women\n2 SAGE Open\nhave revealed, it can be informative to study an active popu-\nlation because much can be learned regarding the determi-\nnants of successful exercise engagement and associated\nconsequences, which could then be targeted among the insuf-\nficiently active (Duncan, Hall, Wilson, & Jenny, 2010).\nLikewise, the relationship between exercise and well-\nbeing, especially affect, seems to be quite pronounced in\nwomen (Gill, Williams, Williams, Butki, & Young, 1997;\nKull, 2002). Studies with women consistently demonstrate\nthe positive influence of exercise on affective states immedi-\nately afterward (Cramp & Bray, 2010; Gauvin, Rejeski, &\nReboussin, 2000). Improvements in overall positive affect\namong women have also been noted, as have improvements\nin feelings of vitality (Kelsey et al., 2006; Wendel-Vos,\nSchuit, Tijhuis, & Kromhout, 2004). Despite the emotional\nbenefits, women engage in lower levels of physical activity\nthan men, which may be related to psychological variables\nthat are uniquely associated with women's engagement in\nexercise (Bassett, Wyatt, Thompson, Peters, & Hill, 2010;\nColley et al., 2011; Segar, Jayaratne, Hanlon, & Richardson,\n2002). The SDT framework is one psychological perspective\nthat has been strongly advocated to explain women's engage-\nment in exercise, including affective experiences, and this\nbacking is consistent with broader calls in the literature for\nmore women-focused research looking at exercise\nglobal scale, women's mental health, which encompasses\ntheir affective states, deserves attention in its own right as it\ngenerally tends to be poorer than that of men (Denton, Prus,\nExplaining the Exercise\u00adAffect\nRelationship\nAlthough the evidence to date is convincing, the relationship\nbetween exercise and well-being is far from simplistic, espe-\ncially when it comes to predicting affect (Biddle & Ekkekakis,\n2005). Indeed, variability across research findings is indica-\ntive that not all individuals who participate in exercise\nachieve greater well-being (O'Connor & Puetz, 2005). For\ninstance, Van Landuyt, Ekkekakis, Hall, and Petruzzello\n(2000) found that only half of participants engaging in a\n30- min moderate to high intensity cycling task felt progres-\nsively better. The implication of these and other findings\nsuch as Brown et al. (2004) is that merely engaging in exer-\ncise, in terms of amount and/or intensity, may be insufficient\nto accrue affective benefits. Indeed, there is a need for more\nsophisticated knowledge of underlying processes with which\nexercise may or may not benefit affective states (Berger &\n& Petruzzello, 2011). Specifically, experts have called for\nmore research on the moderators associated with different\npatterns of postexercise affect (Reed & Ones, 2006).\nModerating variables can inform us of the circumstances\nunder which a given association occurs.\nAlthough exercise characteristics, such as type, intensity,\nand duration can modify its association with affect, the evi-\ndence remains inconsistent (Markowitz & Arent, 2010). In\naddition, a sizable proportion of earlier research on exercise\nstimulus factors has been atheoretical, prompting experts to\nrecommend greater use of theoretical models (Berger &\nresearchers to conjure up explanations of how and why cer-\ntain phenomena occur (or do not). Despite some conceptual\nprogress, for example with \"dual-mode theory\" (Ekkekakis,\n2003), physiological processes have been prioritized,\nwhereas other theory-based variables of a psychological\nnature ought to be better accounted for (Berger & Motl,\nthe theoretical, person-centered work that has emerged (e.g.,\nself-efficacy), to the authors' knowledge there is still a gap\nwith respect to moderating motivational variables, as ini-\ntially highlighted by Berger and Motl (2000; Raedeke, Focht,\n& Scales, 2009). Surely there is a need for more theory-based\nenquiries of motivation in this area given the central role of\nmotivational variables in our understanding of exercise\nbehavior and of indicators of well-being, such as positive\naffect (Biddle & Mutrie, 2008; Sebire, Standage, &\nVansteenkiste, 2009). Examining motivation as one theory-\nbased link may help explain conflicting evidence in this area.\nSelf-Determined Motivation\nSpecifically, the quality of motivation, namely, one's self-\ndetermination as purported by SDT, may supply a missing\nlink in understanding well-being (in this case, affect)-related\noutcomes of exercise (Th\u00f8gersen-Ntoumani & Fox, 2007).\nModeration frameworks, using self-determined motivation\nhave proven useful in explaining behavior\u00adwell-being rela-\ntionships (Lemyre, Roberts, & Stray-Gundersen, 2007).\nAccording to the founders of SDT, the guiding theoretical\nframework for this study, motivation can be distinguished\nalong a continuum from controlled (extrinsic) motivation,\nresulting from demands and/or pressure, to more autono-\nmous or self-determined motivation, arising from elements\nof volition, choice, and interest (Deci & Ryan, 1985). The\ncontinuum is delineated as having six behavioral regulations\nthat are increasingly more self-determined (Deci & Ryan,\n2002). The influence of motivation is also thought to be hier-\narchically organized, whereby the regulations operate at\nthree levels of generality: situational, contextual, and global\n(Vallerand, 2007). Whereas situational motivation refers to a\nstate of motivation experienced at a specific point in time,\ncontextual motivation is a more stable motivational orienta-\ntion for the activity defined more broadly. Global motivation\nimplies a person's general orientation to interact with their\nenvironment at large (Vallerand, 2007). Within this hierar-\nchy, the level of a given outcome (e.g., postexercise affect)\nshould correspond to the motivation level that produced it\n(e.g., pre-exercise, situational).\nGu\u00e9rin and Fortier 3\nAmotivation lies at one end of the continuum and repre-\nsents lacking the intention to act and adjacent to it, external\nregulation is defined as being motivated according to exter-\nnal demands (e.g., to avoid punishment for not running; Deci\n& Ryan, 2002). Next, introjection involves a slight internal-\nization, a process whereby regulation of a behavior is taken\nin and integrated with one's sense of who they are. Still, there\nis little acceptance of it as one's own because, for example, a\nwoman may be following a running program due to senti-\nments of guilt or shame (e.g., physique-related; Deci & Ryan,\n2002). Often, one feels pressure to engage in the activity to\ngain a sense of self-worth. Next on the spectrum is identified\nregulation; this is the first of the more self-determined moti-\nvation types as it arises when an individual values the behav-\nior and assigns it personal importance (e.g., running for one's\nhealth). Ensuing is integrated regulation, which involves\nengaging in an activity because it is well assimilated into\none's identity and core values (e.g., \"I am a runner\").\nMeasurement of the latter regulation has been much less\ncommon given that empirical distinctions between identified\nand integrated regulation have been slower to emerge. Last,\nat the other extremity of the continuum lies intrinsic motiva-\ntion, as characterized by enjoyment and by inherent satisfac-\ntion in an activity, whereby an individual engages in the\nactivity for its own sake (Deci & Ryan, 2002).\nIn SDT, it is posited that controlling forms of motivation\n(i.e., external, introjected) generally lead to less adaptive\nconsequences than more autonomous motivation (i.e., intrin-\nsic, identified). Studies have consistently shown that indi-\nviduals who are more self-determined for exercise tend to\nnot only engage in more physical activity (Sebire, Standage,\n& Vansteenkiste, 2011) but also report greater emotional\nbenefits, such as elevated general positive affect (Puente &\nAnshel, 2010). Self-determined motivation (intrinsic moti-\nvation and identified regulation in particular) can also pre-\ndict better self-evaluation patterns, which have been linked\nto positive affect and well-being (Brunet & Sabiston, 2009;\nTh\u00f8gersen-Ntoumani & Ntoumanis, 2006). Among regular\nexercisers, intrinsic exercise motives have been tied to lower\nstress levels and better scores on global indicators of well-\nConversely and still in the exercise context, external\nregulation among women has been associated with unstable\nself-esteem and greater negative affect (Gagn\u00e9, Ryan, &\nBargmann, 2003). Moreover, introjected regulation for\nexercise has been linked to lower vitality and poorer life sat-\nisfaction (Edmunds, Ntoumanis, & Duda, 2007; Th\u00f8gersen-\nNtoumani & Fox, 2007). However, results are somewhat\nequivocal with introjection because this type of motivation\nhas also been correlated with behavioral persistence (Sabiston\nevidence that, for women, higher amounts of introjection can\nhave a positive influence on intentions and exercise behavior\nitself (Markland, 2009; Th\u00f8gersen-Ntoumani & Ntoumanis,\n2006). This controlling regulation has also been associated\nwith the intensity with which women exert themselves dur-\ning exercise, which can impact their affect postexercise\nwomen have been found to endorse greater levels of introjec-\ntion than men (Wilson, Rodgers, Fraser, & Murray, 2004). In\nsum, the influence of introjection appears to be ambiguous.\nAlthough introjection can positively predict behavioral\nengagement (i.e., exercise), it may simultaneously compro-\nmise markers of well-being (i.e., affect), as purported by\nSDT (Teixeira, Carraca, Silva, & Ryan, 2012).\nThere are only a few studies that have examined the influ-\nence of self-determination on positive affect in the acute\nphase of exercise. Among them, Lutz, Lochbaum, and\nTurnbow (2003) found that higher self-determined contex-\ntual motivation toward exercise predicted greater positive\naffect after an exercise class. However, their research design\ndid not allow for testing the specific moderating effect of\nself-determined motivation, including the motivational regu-\nlations as distinct predictors/moderators, and the authors\nfocused on contextual motivation. Moreover, Lutz et al. used\nthe convenience of an exercise class rather than an experi-\nmental design. Despite the advantage of naturalistic research\nfor improved ecological validity, it offers less containment of\nconfounding influences (e.g., social variables, distractions,\netc.).\nAlso, there is evidence to support the suggestion that\naffective states produced or modified in controlled environ-\nments are not that different from those in nonlaboratory set-\ntings (Blanchard, Rodgers, & Gauvin, 2004). Experimental\nstudies of exercise enable good control of extraneous influ-\nences, allowing for explorations of potential mechanisms\nas well as moderating processes/conditions. Therefore, the\nfocus of the present investigation was on the moderating\neffect of motivation on the acute exercise-positive affect\nlink in the context of an in-laboratory, running experiment.\nIt would appear that this is the first study to pursue this. In\nkeeping with expert advice that laboratory researchers\nshould adequately match an exerciser's usual exercise\nmodality, we targeted self-reported runners (Kerr & Kuk,\n2001). This was also prudent given evidence that exercise\npreference and familiarity can influence exercise-related\nmood changes (Lane, Jackson, & Terry, 2005). Likewise, a\nself-paced running task was deemed favorable as this was\nin line with SDT principles of optimizing choice as well as\nevidence, showing greater positive affective responses\nfrom self-paced exercise (Vazou-Ekkekakis & Ekkekakis,\nAims and Hypotheses\nThe purpose of this within-participant experiment was to\nexamine the moderating influence of situational motivation\n(for running) on the relationship between an acute bout of\npreferred exercise (i.e., running vs. control) and pre-post\nchanges in positive affect. This study was part of a larger\n4 SAGE Open\nproject. The results of a preliminary paper focusing solely on\nthe running activity showed that introjected regulation inter-\nacted with the perceived intensity of the run to predict posi-\ntive affect such that women with lower introjection saw\nimprovements in positive affect as their ratings of perceived\nexertion (RPE) for the run increased (Gu\u00e9rin & Fortier,\n2012). By comparing a running activity with a control task,\nthe present enquiry expands on the previous report by testing\nthe full moderating effect of motivational regulations indi-\nvidually. Several premises were tested.\nFirst, a preliminary hypothesis was that participants\nwould show a greater pre-to-post increase in positive affect\nwhen engaging in a running task compared with a control\nbased on SDT and the little research to date, it was expected\nthat women with higher levels of intrinsic motivation and\nidentified regulation would show strong increases in positive\naffect postrunning and not postcontrol (i.e., moderation\ngiven prominent feelings of pressure/onus to run that seem\nincongruent with pleasant states, women with higher levels\nof external and introjected regulations would show a weak or\nno change in positive affect postrunning, similar to that\nachieved postcontrol (Deci & Ryan 2002; Teixeira et al.,\nGiven these speculations, a third and exploratory line of\nenquiry targeted the relative effects of motivational regula-\ntions on positive affect following the running task specifi-\ncally. Based on SDT and previous findings (Lutz et al., 2003;\nEdmunds et al., 2007), it was expected that intrinsic and\nidentified regulations would exert positive influences on\npostrun positive affect after controlling for prerun (baseline)\nlevels of affect. These regulations would explain a greater\namount of variance in postrun positive affect than introjected\nor external regulations, as these latter associations with post-\nrun affect were expected to be weak or even slightly\nnegative.\nMethod\nParticipants\nWomen between the ages of 25 and 55 years were recruited\nfrom local universities, chiropractic clinics, and sport/chil-\ndren stores via posters and word of mouth as well as through\nrunning/athletics websites. Eligible participants reported no\nunderlying medical condition, were not currently pregnant,\nand satisfied a health screening test for exercise. All partici-\npants were active; that is, they reported a minimum of 20 min\nof moderate to vigorous exercise at least three times per\nweek for at least 6 months. It was also required that partici-\npants perceive running as their preferred or most frequent\nexercise modality. These criteria were confirmed via self-\nreport during each participant's initial contact to participate\nin this study.1 The final sample size was 41, and this was\ndeemed satisfactory to detect a medium-sized effect using\nrepeated measures ANOVAs (GPower 3.1.2) and as estab-\nlished from previous studies (Reed & Ones, 2006). Although\nsmall for multiple regressions, these adjunct analyses served\nan exploratory purpose and no a priori power analysis was\nconducted. That said, similar sample sizes have been used in\nother repeated measures investigations in this area as well as\nother studies applying hierarchical regression with a similar\nnumber of variables (e.g., Berlin, Kop, & Deuster, 2006).\nMeasures\nDemographic/background measures.\nA demographic form\nconsisted of questions that were both general (e.g., occupa-\ntion, height, weight) and running specific (e.g., I have been\nrunning at my current intensity/frequency for: [blank]\nmonths). Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as weight\n(in pounds) multiplied by 703 then divided by height (in\ninches) squared. The Godin Leisure Time Exercise Ques-\ntionnaire (LTEQ; Godin & Shephard, 1985) was used to\ndescribe participants' current exercise levels . Participants\nevaluated the number of days in a typical week they had\nengaged in light, moderate, and strenuous exercise. The fre-\nquency values were multiplied by their corresponding inten-\nsity value, namely 3, 5, and 9, and then summed to provide a\ntotal weekly activity score. All 41 women met a cut-off score\nof 24 to be included in the analyses, which is consistent with\nrecommendations for health benefits and is equivalent to just\nover two vigorous and one moderate session per week\nAffect. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS;\nWatson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) was administered to mea-\nsure pre- and post-task affect. The PANAS is a popular\ninstrument to measure affect in SDT research and in exercise\nstudies (Reed & Ones, 2006). The PANAS is an appropriate\nmeasure across exercise and nonexercise situations (i.e., lab-\noratory studies), although it is a measure of HA affect only\n(Ekkekakis & Petruzzello, 2001). Therefore, a welcome con-\ntribution in the exercise context was to integrate LA items\ninto the PANAS, as it had been done in other domains (e.g.,\nAbercrombie, Kalin, & Davidson, 2005). Indeed, some\nresearchers have substantiated that exercise can induce posi-\ntive feelings of calmness and relaxation, typical of LA affect,\nand they argue that these affective properties should not be\nthis study, 11 items (5 positive) established by Feldman-\nBarrett and Russell (1998) to assess LA affect were used to\nsupplement the original PANAS, which is comprised of 20\nadjective words (10 positive and 10 negative [also see Aber-\ncrombie et al.]).2\nFor each of the 31 adjectives, responses to the stem\nIndicate to what extent you feel this way right now, that is, at\nthe present moment were rated from (1) not at all to (5)\nextremely. Examples of adjectives include \"excited\"\nGu\u00e9rin and Fortier 5\n(positive, HA) and \"serene\" (positive, LA). Given the focus\non positive affect in this study, only these items were\nsummed, separately for HA and LA, and analyzed.3 Internal\nconsistency values for all times points in the present study\nwere robust and can be found in Table 1.\nSituational motivation.\nThe Situational Motivation Scale\n(SIMS; Guay, Vallerand, & Blanchard, 2000) was used to\nmeasure situational motivation for running. The SIMS con-\nsists of 16 items with four subscales that evaluate the differ-\nent behavioral regulations (Standage, Treasure, Duda, &\nPrusak, 2003). Integrated and introjected regulations were\nexcluded from the original SIMS to condense the scale (Guay\net al., 2000). However, given the relevance of introjection in\nthis study, an enhanced version of the SIMS was used, which\ncontained four additional introjection items developed by\nGillet, Vallerand, Lafreni\u00e8re, and Bureau (2013).4 Responses\nto the stem why are you currently [about to run] are anchored\non a 7-point Likert-type scale from (1) corresponds not at all\nto (7) corresponds exactly. A sample item is \"because I think\nthis activity is pleasant\" (intrinsic motivation).\nAverage scores were calculated for intrinsic motivation,\nidentified regulation, and introjected regulation. The psycho-\nmetric properties of the SIMS are documented elsewhere,\nincluding significant factor loadings for the modified version\nThe Cronbach's alpha values of the given subscales in the\npresent study are displayed in Table 1. As expected from a\nsample of active participants, scores on external regulation\nand amotivation were low and variance levels were negligi-\nble, which contributed to low internal consistency values. No\nfurther analyses were conducted on these regulations; no\nhypotheses had been forwarded for amotivation.\nIntensity measure. In this study, the RPE scale (Borg, 1982)\nwas used solely for descriptive purposes regarding the aver-\nage perceived intensity of the running task and not for pur-\nposes of analysis. Readers can consult Gu\u00e9rin & Fortier\n(2012) for a more detailed examination of the intensity vari-\nable. The RPE consists of self-reported numerical values\nfrom 6 to 20 that are anchored with descriptors at every odd\ninteger (i.e., 7 = very, very light; 13 = somewhat hard; 19 =\nvery, very hard). The RPE has been popularized in studies of\nexercise and affect, and its validity and reliability are well\nestablished (W. Russell & Newton, 2008).\nDesign and Procedures\nThis experimental study was approved by the University of\nOttawa Ethics Review Board. It followed a 2 (running, con-\ntrol) \u00d7 2 (pre, post) repeated-measures design. A traditional\npre-post design was used based on the results of an important\nmeta-analytic review (Reed & Ones, 2006) and given that\nthe focus was, similar to others, on immediate changes in\naffect following exercise (Hallgren, Moss, & Gastin, 2010;\nMiller, Bartholomew, & Springer, 2005). Each participant\nattended two individual sessions (one week apart) at a cam-\npus laboratory. Blinding participants to the task they would\nreceive at each session was expected to minimize carryover\nand expectation effects. Upon arrival, the women provided\nwritten consent after being informed of (a) the purpose to\nexamine psychological factors during physical and/or non-\nphysical activities (b) the protocol, namely that at the start of\neach session they would be randomly assigned to one of two\ntasks (i.e., running, quiet attention-control). In reality, a\nwithin-person comparison of the two tasks was sought and\ncounterbalancing was used to assign half of the women to the\nTable 1.

Session 2 followed a similar format with the\nomission of the intake assessment. Session 2 concluded with\na short debrief (5 min) to inform participants of the compo-\nnents of this study.\nRunning task. Each participant was taken to a private exer-\ncise room equipped with a treadmill, a desk, and a chair. The\ntreadmill control panel was physically detached from the\nrunning belt. This allowed the researcher to easily monitor\nand adjust settings according to the participant's requests to\nmimic a self-paced, moderate-to-high intensity run. The par-\nticipants completed a 2 to 3 min warm-up at an average\nspeed of 5.17 km/hr. Next, the researcher sped up the belt to\nthe participant's desired pace. The researcher remained in\nproximity for any requests to alter the speed, the details and\ntiming of which were duly noted. An average running pace\nwas calculated by weighting any change in pace by the ratio\nof elapsed time at that pace. Conversation and eye contact\nbetween participant and researcher was kept to a minimum.\nParticipants ran for 30 min as this can be considered to be a\nstandard duration for examining acute exercise and affective\nstates (e.g., Van Landuyt et al., 2000). Then, the belt was\nslowed to the initial walking speed for a 2-min cool down.\nThe participant stepped off the treadmill and promptly pro-\nvided their running RPE and responded to PANAS.\nControl task. Each participant was taken individually to a pri-\nvate and quiet room equipped with a chair and a desk on\nwhich was laid out the daily newspaper and a small selection\nof general-topic magazines (e.g., home renovations, politics,\nand community). The researchers were very discerning in\ntheir selection of neutral reading material; suggestions of\nhealth and body image were minimized to avoid inflation/\ndeflation influences on affect. This type of quiet, seated con-\ntrol task is common in exercise studies (e.g., Vocks, Hechler,\nRohrig, & Legenbauer, 2009). The participant was instructed\nto occupy her attention with the provided material until the\ndesignated time had elapsed. The researcher busied herself in\nthe adjacent workspace to mimic the procedures/presence of\nthe running task. After roughly 35 to 37 min (running task\ntotal time with warm up/cool down), the participant promptly\nresponded to the PANAS.\nAnalyses\nAll data were entered into SPSS Version 18.0. Data screen-\ning procedures were conducted according to guidelines set\nout by Tabachnick and Fidell (2007); this included assess-\nments of data entry errors, missing data, outliers, normality\nand testing of basic assumptions of analyses of variance and\nregression analyses. Table 1 provides basic descriptive statis-\ntics and reliability analyses that were calculated for affect\nand motivation variables.\nUsing repeated-measures t tests and bivariate correla-\ntions, scores for the three motivational variables were exam-\nined across sessions to justify using average scores of\nsituational motivation to simplify their inclusion as covari-\nates. To test the preliminary hypotheses, a series of repeated\nmeasures ANOVAs were conducted. Specifically, the data\nfor HAand LAaffect were subjected to 2 (task: running, con-\ntrol) \u00d7 2 (time: pre, post) ANOVAs, respectively. A series of\npost hoc t tests with Bonferroni adjustment ensued to dissect\nthe findings. Next, to test the moderating influences of situ-\national motivational regulations as continuous variables, the\nANOVAs were repeated by specifying intrinsic motivation\nas well as identified and introjected regulations indepen-\ndently as a covariate in each model (i.e., ANCOVA). The\nalpha level was adjusted for multiple tests (p < .02). In graph-\ning significant interaction(s), high and low values of the\nmoderators (motivation covariates) were specified as one\nstandard deviation above and below the mean (Aiken &\nLast, to test exploratory hypotheses pertaining to the run-\nning task, separate hierarchical multiple regressions were\nconducted for postrun HA affect and postrun LA affect as\ndependent variables. Namely, for each of the two regression\nmodels, scores on the three motivational regulations were\nadded as predictors in Step 2 after controlling for prerun\naffect in Step 1.\nResults\nPreliminary Analyses\nMean substitution estimation was used for missing data\npoints (2.4%) as this amount was less than 5% (Tabachnick\n& Fidell, 2007). Using standardized scores, no univariate\noutliers were identified for any of the affect or motivation\nvariables. Normality was confirmed by examining the distri-\nbutions of the variables (i.e., histograms) and their skewness\nand kurtosis values. There were no issues with linearity,\nhomoscedasticity or collinearity. Last, scores for motivation\ntoward running remained stable from one session to the next\n(ps > .05) and were highly correlated (ps < .01); thus, aver-\nage scores across session for the regulations were used as\ncovariates in the ANOVAs.\nSample and Running Task Characteristics\nSeventy-six women volunteered for this study. Thirty-four\nwere deemed ineligible either on the basis of the aforemen-\ntioned criteria or due to scheduling/contacting issues. One\nwoman was excluded as she failed to attend both sessions.\nAll demographic information as well as leisure time running\nbehavior and in-laboratory running information of the final\nGu\u00e9rin and Fortier 7\nsample (N = 41) can be found in Table 2.

All results can be found\nin Table 3. Starting with HA and after controlling for levels\nof prerun affect, intrinsic, identified and introjected regula-\ntion variables accounted for approximately 7% of the total\n79% of variance explained in the model. Identified regula-\ntion was a significant and positive predictor of the increase in\nHA affect from pre- to postrunning, whereas introjection was\nalso a positive and marginally significant predictor (p = .05).\nHowever, the beta for intrinsic motivation fell below signifi-\ncance levels, remaining so even when the other regulations\nwere removed from the model (not shown). Motivation vari-\nables did not predict a significant amount of variance in post-\nrun LA positive affect after controlling for prerun affect.\nDiscussion\nStrengths\nThe objective of this experimental study was to examine the\neffect of situational motivation (for running) on the relation-\nship between running (exercise) and immediate changes in\npositive affect. Examining person-centered and malleable\nSDT-based variables as modifying agents was unique to this\nstudy and provides innovative theory-driven insight regard-\ning motivational circumstances that may inform underlying\nprocesses (Biddle & Ekkekakis, 2005). Key methodological\nfeatures of this study lend strength to our findings, such as\nthe use of a preferred exercise modality and a laboratory set-\nting in which extraneous factors were minimized. This study\nadds support for the acute benefits of exercise on a key indi-\ncator of well-being given that increases in positive affective\nstates surfaced in our sample (Biddle & Mutrie, 2008). As\nexpected, participants experienced an increase in HA and LA\npositive affect after 30 min of running. Moreover, the\nincrease in HA affect was not seen after the control task.\nThese findings add to the scarcity of experimental research\nin this area, particularly with women (Kull, 2002). This study\nsupports ongoing efforts to understand the emotional bene-\nfits of regular exercise among women and it supplements\nliterature attesting to the immediate affective benefits of run-\nning as a form of exercise for women (Butryn & Furts, 2003;\nKelsey et al., 2006). From an applied standpoint, for instance\nin the context of lifestyle interventions targeting women, the\nfindings hint that it may be worthwhile to emphasize the\ndirect benefits of preferred exercise on indicators of well-\nbeing, such as positive affect.\nSelf-Determined Motivation: Considerations\nThe distinctive findings pertaining to motivation in this\nstudy, which accounted for a perceptible 7% of the 79% of\nvariance in positive affect after controlling for prerun affect,\nhelp conjure up a number of interesting deliberations based\non the principles of SDT, our guiding theoretical framework.\nWe found that introjected regulation was a significant mod-\nerator of the relationship between running and affect, with\nlevels of introjection being positively related to levels of\npostrun HA affect. Meanwhile, the moderating effects of\nself-determined regulations were not significant. Yet, identi-\nfied regulation played a unique, positive role in the increase\nin positive affect with running, lending partial support to\nSDT (Deci & Ryan, 2002). This finding is consistent with\nTh\u00f8gersen-Ntoumani and Fox (2007), who found that identi-\nfied regulation predicted physical well-being, although they\ndid not examine exercise-related affective changes.\nStill, our nonsignificant results for intrinsic motivation\nand the small (yet significant) effect for identified regulation\ndo not fully align with SDT and past studies reporting sig-\nnificant and stronger associations between self-determina-\ntion and exercise-induced changes in affect and well-being\n& Ntoumanis, 2006). The finding that identified regulation\npredicted an increase in positive affect postrunning is\nTable 3. Running Task Hierarchical Regressions Predicting Postrun Positive Affect.\nHigh activation affect Low activation affect\nGu\u00e9rin and Fortier 9\nconsistent with an SDT assertion that when individuals\nengage in exercise because they value the behavior and its\nbenefits, they are more likely to feel better about themselves\nand overall (Ryan & Deci, 2000; Th\u00f8gersen-Ntoumani &\nFox, 2007). Our findings for intrinsic motivation, however,\ntend to resonate with those of Gagn\u00e9 et al. (2003), who saw\nthat incoming self-determined motivation among gymnasts\ndid not significantly predict changes in indicators of well-\nbeing from pre- to postpractice. Although the results for\nintrinsic motivation appear counterintuitive given the strong\nenjoyment factor that defines this regulation, some authors\nhave shown that identified motivation may be equally influ-\nential in predicting persistence in health behaviors, such as\nexercise, given that strenuous physical activities may not be\nperceived as inherently pleasurable (Wilson et al., 2004).\nGiven that the women who participated in this study were\npersistent, high-intensity exercisers, this regulation may hold\nparticular weight. It should be reiterated however that our\nregression analyses were underpowered and that the means\nfor the self-determined regulations were high and the vari-\nances low. These descriptive statistics are not surprising\ngiven an active sample but could have led to restricted ranges\nand ceiling effects that weakened the explanatory power of\nthese variables, an issue that was compounded by the large\nproportion of variance explained by prerun affect.\nThe results of this study also showed that scoring high on\nintrojection was associated with experiencing higher levels\nof HA positive affect after running. From a conceptual stand-\npoint, it could be that the source of introjection in the labora-\ntory may be different from that of everyday running.\nSpecifically, the level of introjection and its relationship with\naffect could be related to feelings of obligation to the study\nand a desire to please the researcher (experimental introject),\nrather than, or in addition to, a desire to not let oneself down,\nwhich would arise with regular day-to-day running (personal\nintroject). Consequently, participants may feel more positive\naffect after the run as there is a release from the stress they\nhave imposed on themselves, including pressures as research\nparticipants (i.e., \"I should run because I agreed to do this\nstudy and/or I haven't run today and I need to\"). Altogether,\nthese premises are consistent with the idea that individuals\nwith greater introjection likely have more contingencies\nattached to the pleasure they derive from exercise (Gu\u00e9rin &\nFortier, 2012). Conversely, self-determined regulations may\nbe more stable and less vulnerable to situational fluctuations\nin sources of motivation (e.g., \"I always value running\"),\nthus exerting a lesser moderating influence on pre-post dis-\ncrepancies in affect in the laboratory, as reflected by our\nfindings.\nUndoubtedly, the findings for introjection in our study are\nconsistent with its characteristic ties to individuals' self-\nworth (Deci & Ryan, 2002). According to Sabiston et al.\n(2010), \"guilt may motivate reparative action\" and thus, for\nsome women, the running session may have improved affect\nby relieving negative feelings from not having yet exercised\n(p. 419). Similarly, positive affect can ensue following an\nactivity for which one has an ego-involved goal orientation\n(a form of introjection), perhaps due to a relief from stress\nthat arises from not having completed the activity/goal (Nix,\nRyan, Manly, & Deci, 1999). Still, experts contend that such\npeaks in positive affect may be short-lived and probably not\nmentally restorative or conducive to better mental health\n(Nix et al., 1999). Thus, introjected runners may not benefit\nfully from the revitalization qualities of exercise. It may be\nworthwhile to assess feelings of vitality in similar studies in\nthe future and to do so more longitudinally.\nGiven the above remarks, it may be prudent to hold reser-\nvations regarding possible moderating effects of introjection\non changes in affect over the long term, although this was not\ntested in the present study. Although repeated positive affec-\ntive experiences with exercise can sustain this type of behav-\nior (Kwan & Bryan, 2010), this behavioral persistence can\nalso escalate into rigid persistence, such as an exercise\ndependence. Hence, short-term postexercise peaks in posi-\ntive affect among exercisers displaying high introjection\nmay not translate into greater well-being over time, despite\nengaging in a physically active lifestyle. Stephan et al. (2010)\nsaw high levels of self-determination as well as introjection\nin women who persisted with exercise, hinting that perhaps\nintrojection must be coupled with more autonomous motiva-\ntional forces. However, Stephan and colleagues did not\nassess emotional outcomes. Altogether, more attention is\nneeded on the long-term effects of introjection on affective\nstates, and this echoes views by Th\u00f8gersen-Ntoumani and\nPulling from the experimental design, findings for the\ncontrol task also provided worthwhile insights. Indeed, com-\npared with women low in introjection, those with higher lev-\nels experienced a greater decrease in positive affect after\ncompleting the nonexercise quiet control task. This affect\ndrop adds evidence to our supposition that, for these women,\nbeing unable to run or exercise may sustain feelings of guilt\nand thwart positive affective states. These findings are con-\nsistent with literature on exercise dependency cited above as\nwell as with, we speculate, research on the influence of pas-\nsion (Vallerand et al., 2003). Namely, when obsessively pas-\nsionate individuals, as characterized by feeling compelled to\nengage in a valued activity, are deprived of the activity, they\nexperience anxiety and worsening of affect (Vallerand et al.,\n2003). That some active women might experience more\nnegative emotional states from a short relaxing activity is a\ncause for concern and hints at the overall complexity of the\nexercise-affect link.\nExercise and Affect: Beyond Situational\nMotivation\nAs can be appreciated from these deliberations, it is likely\nthat other motivation-related variables within SDT or that\nalign well with SDT, such as passion, may also underlie the\nexercise-positive affect relationship. SDT provided a strong\ntheoretical foundation for this study; within its hierarchical\nstructure, we spotlight the unique, yet perhaps conflicting,\neffect of situational motivation. While this level of focus\ncontributes to the literature on exercise and affect, future\nresearch may wish to also include how runners' contextual\nmotivation contributes to the exercise-affect relationship\n(e.g., motivational shift). Indeed, there may be a complex\ninterrelationship between the regulations at various levels,\nother SDT constructs like the psychological needs, and exer-\ncise outcomes, such as affect (McDonough & Crocker, 2007;\nSebire et al., 2009). This plausible complexity is worthy of\nfurther investigation.\nCertain elements of the protocol in the current study were\nconsistent with the guiding principles of SDT, thereby reduc-\ning confounding effects. Namely, only females who were\nfamiliar with running and who, presumably, felt competent\nwith running, were selected to participate. In addition, the\nself-paced running task promoted participants' autonomy\nand was expected to mimic a day-to-day run. However, the\ncontrol task consisted of sitting in a quiet room reading the\nnewspaper, which could have been a welcomed activity for\nparticipants with busy families and hectic schedules. The\npossible influence of reading material content on affect\nshould also be acknowledged. Indeed, participants experi-\nenced a greater increase in LA positive affect (e.g., relaxed)\nwith the control task compared with the running task. The\nlack of significant findings for LA for the running task reso-\nnates with a study by Bartholomew, Moore, Todd, Todd, and\nElrod (2001) that failed to witness an exercise-related\nincrease in the analogous state of tranquility. Moreover, these\ntask-based differences for LA affect may not be entirely sur-\nprising given evidence that interoceptive cues arising from\nthe physiological stimuli of an exercise task can increase lev-\nels of activation and alter affective valence (Bryan,\nLimitations and Summary\nLastly, the findings of this study should be interpreted within\nthe context of certain limitations. Given the small sample size,\nregression results must be taken as exploratory and indicative\nof trends between variables that will need to be examined in\nlarger samples. Moreover, additional caution is required in\ninterpreting the results for identified regulation given that this\nsubscale revealed a low alpha in our sample, which is similar\nto that of other studies (e.g., Ntoumanis & Blaymires, 2003).\nIn fact, the internal consistency values of the SIMS in this\nstudy warrant further testing of its psychometric properties in\nthe exercise context. It may be a more psychometrically sound\nindicator of situational regulations in other domains and/or\nunder manipulations of a participants' autonomy (Guay et al.,\nIn addition, despite the popularity of the pre-post design,\nseveral researchers have taken to assessing affect repetitively\nduring exercise as this may be more sensitive to exercise\nintensity and resistant to dissipation effects (Backhouse,\nEkkekakis, Biddle, Foskett, & Williams, 2007; Ekkekakis et\nal., 2011). Moreover, the generalizability of the current find-\nings to natural day-to-day contexts may be limited as the\nlaboratory could have been experienced as cold and/or bor-\ning (e.g., no music, other runners, scenery), thus influencing\nresponses. Although we attempted to minimize threats to\ninternal validity as well as expectancy effects (e.g., via coun-\nterbalancing, \"blinding\" participants), it would be helpful in\nfuture studies to also consider a more extensive variety of\ncompromising factors inherent in experimental designs, as\noutlined elsewhere in the literature (Reed & Ones, 2006;\nThomas & Neilson 2001). Finally, more studies are also\nneeded that draw on daily experience sampling whereby\nwomen's motivational patterns and affective changes, as\nwell as any reciprocal influences, can be modeled over time\nin natural exercise environments (Gu\u00e9rin, Fortier, & Sweet,\nIn sum, and as guided by SDT, situational motivation can\ninfluence changes in positive affect acquired during an acute\nexercise session, although more work is needed on the long-\nterm effects of a regulation guided by guilt and obligation.\nMoreover, given the large amount of variance it explained, it\nwould be worthwhile to also consider ways of maximizing\npre-exercise affect, in conjunction with motivation, to opti-\nmize postexercise benefits.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The\nfirst author was funded through scholarships from the Social\nSciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada as well as the\nOntario Graduate Scholarship.
