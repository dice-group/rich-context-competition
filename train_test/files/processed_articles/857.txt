Logistic regression models enabled\na multistage building strategy to be used\nin the analyses.\nParticipants and setting - The study in-\ncluded three racial groups: whites (n=\n1004). While face to face interviews were\ncarried out with each respondent, some\nportions of the interview were self ad-\nministered to collect sensitive in-\nformation.\nMain results - Compared with whites,\nblacks and Hispanics were more likely to\nassess health as poor and report having\nfunctional limitations of daily activities.\nSocioeconomic factors tended to play a\ndifferent role in explaining racial dis-\nparities in self assessed health status. In\nglobal health, education tended to play a\nsignificant role in accounting for health\ndisparities between whites and Hispanics.\nIn functional limitations, none of the co-\nvariates explained racial differences for\nblacks, whereas for Hispanics, education\nand marital status explained racial differ-\nences.\nConclusions - The debate over whether\nrace is a proxy for socioeconomic con-\nditions or race influences health in-\ndependent of socioeconomic factors\ndepends on the measure ofhealth and ra-\ncial group included in the study. Future\nstudies should examine separately the\ndifferential impacts of various socio-\neconomic factors on varying domains of\nhealth.\nDespite consistent evidence describing dis-\nparities in self assessed health status among\nracial groups, little consensus has been reached\non how to explain these disparities.1-3 One\nperspective considers race as a proxy for social\nclass (as measured by income or education)\nand views the relationship between race and\nhealth as \"spurious.\" Based on the finding\nthat the influences of race on health tend to\ndisappear after adjusting for income or edu-\ncation, the proponents of this perspective sug-\ngest that the gap in health outcomes among\nracial groups would simply close significantly\nafter reducing class inequality.4 An alternative\nperspective considers race as representing more\nthan social class. The fact that the relationship\nbetween race and health is pervasive even after\nadjusting for socioeconomic status has led to\nthe conclusion that racial disparities are robust\nindicators of a wide range of social conditions\nincluding not only socioeconomic status, but\nalso living arrangements and racism.\"7\nHowever, in assessing the importance ofrace\nin explaining racial disparities in health, most\nstudies tend to control for, instead ofanalysing,\nsocioeconomic status. In these analyses, the\ndynamics ofthe effects ofsocioeconomic status\nin explaining racial disparities in health have\noften been overlooked. A few studies have ex-\namined the interaction between race and socio-\neconomic status on health using a stratification\napproach, that is, dividing the sample into racial\ngroups to estimate the effects ofsocioeconomic\nstatus separately for whites, blacks, and His-\npanics.\"9 These studies are necessary, but they\nare insufficient to identify critical features of\nsocioeconomic status or to disentangle the sep-\narate effects of socioeconomic status on health\nacross racial groups. Extending our earlier ex-\nploration ofthe subject,3 we adopted a different\nstatistical approach (that is, a multistage model\nbuilding strategy) in this study to further ex-\nplore the role of various socioeconomic con-\nditions in accounting for racial disparities in\nself assessed health status (as measured by\ngeneral health perceptions and functional lim-\nitations of daily activities).\nMethods\nData for this study were obtained from the\nholds (NSFH). The NSFH, a national rep-\nresentative survey, was a multistage, stratified\nprobability sample of non-institutionalised\nAmerican adults age 19 and older.'0 The survey\nrandomly selected one adult from each house-\nhold to be the primary respondent. The NSFH\nadopted a face to face interview procedure,\nbut some portions of the interview in which\nsensitive information was required were self\nadministered.\nThe Joint Program in\nSociety and Health,\nThe Health Institute,\nNew England Medical\nCentre and Harvard\nSchool of Public\nHealth,\nHarvard University\nX S Ren\nB C Amick III\nCorrespondence to:\nDr X S Ren, The Health\nInstitute, New England\nMedical Centre,\nRen, Amick\nSociodemographic characteristics of the study sample\nRacelethnicity (weighted %o)\nTotal\nAge (y):\nSex:\nMale\nFemale\nLanguage:\nEnglish\nSpanish\nMarital status:\nMarried\nWere married\nNever married\nEducation (y):\nIncome ($):\nW'hite\nBlack\nHispanic\nThe interview was conducted in either Eng-\nlish or Spanish. The initial translation of all\nquestionnaires into Spanish was pretested\namnong Puerto Ricans in New York and also\nreviewed by people familiar with^ Mexican\nAmerican usage. After revision, another pretest\nwas conducted in a Puerto Rican area of New\nYork and in a Mexican American area of Los\nAngeles. Bilingual interviewers were hired to\nwork in areas where there was a significant\nconcentration of Spanish speaking people. The\ninterviewee was given the option of taking the\ninterview in Spanish or English. A total of 259\ninterviews were conducted in Spanish (2% of\nthe total sample). The average interview lasted\nhour and 40 minutes. In the NSFH no\nattempt was made to obtain interviews with\npeople who did not speak either Spanish or\nEnglish.

'\u00b0\nThe NSFH gathered information on four\nracial groups: whites, blacks, Hispanics, and\n\"others\" from the survey question, \"Which of\nthe groups on this card best describe you?\"\nDue to small sample size, we excluded 168\nrespondents who reported \"others\" and 35\nrespondents who were missing on this selfiden-\ntified race category. Hence, the study included\n(7%) (see table 1). Among the Hispanic re-\n(18%) other Hispanics.\nTwo self assessed health measures were ana-\nlysed in the study: (1) global health assessment\nand (2) functional limitations of daily activities.\nGlobal health assessment was measured by\nasking, \"Compared with other people your age,\nhow would you describe your health?\" Func-\ntional limitations was measured by asking, \"Do\nyou have health conditions that limit your abil-\nity to care for personal needs such as dressing,\neating, or going to the bathroom; move about\ninside the house; work for pay; do day to day\nhousehold tasks; climb a flight of stairs; walk\nsix blocks?\"\nAlthough a number of studies have found\nthat global health perception is a powerful pre-\ndictor of morbidity and mortality, recent evi-\ndence has raised concerns about the utility of\nusing global health assessment measures for\nracial comparisons.\" This new qualitative re-\nsearch indicates that different racial groups\nhave different interpretations ofquestion mean-\ning and response categories.'2 We used global\nhealth perception along with a measure offunc-\ntional limitations of daily activities, a more\nobjective measure of health status, comparing\nfindings with both measures.\nAs would be expected in the general adult\npopulation, the distributions of the two meas-\nures of health in the study are quite skewed\ntoward the healthy end of the scale. Because\nof the small numbers of persons in the less\nhealthy categories, a dichotomous measure was\ncreated for each of the two health domains.'3\nThe original five response categories of global\nhealth perception were collapsed to two rep-\nresenting \"good health\" (including responses\nof \"very good\" and \"good\") and \"not good\nhealth\" (including responses of \"fair\", \"poor\",\nand \"very poor\"), whereas functional lim-\nitations of daily activities were recoded to\nrepresent \"yes\" or \"no\" answers ofhaving func-\ntional limitations. The use of dichotomous\nmeasures was supported by our preliminary\nanalyses,3 in which we used SAS logistic re-\ngression for an ordinal response (or polytomous\nlogistic regression) to analyse global health as-\nsessment and functional limitations of daily\nactivities.'4 In these preliminary analyses, we\ntested the assumption of proportionality for\nthe ordinal responses. The x2 tests were all\nsignificant, indicating that logistic regression\nmodels for an ordinal response were not ap-\npropriate for the data.\nThe study also included three socioeconomic\ncovariates that have been previously hy-\npothesised to influence health: marital status\n(married, separated/divorced/widowed, and\nnever married), years of schooling (< 11, 12,\nor more). Age and sex, often linked to health\noutcomes, were also included in the study as\ntwo controlling variables.\nDescriptive characteristics ofthe study popu-\nlation are contained in table 1.
