Data from a prospective quasi-\nexperiment were analyzed using intervention analysis or interrupted time series analysis. Dependent variables are time series\nof the U.S. monthly homicide rate as well as violent crime rate from a sample of 206 cities. The binary intervention variable\nis based on the size of the largest U.S. TM-Sidhi group. Intervention effects were analyzed by time series regression using\na broken-trend intervention model. As hypothesized, there was a statistically and practically significant shift in trend in the\ndirection of reduced rates for each of the variables beginning with the onset of the intervention period. Diagnostic tests\nindicate that key statistical assumptions of the analysis are satisfied. Alternative hypotheses are considered for the apparent\neffect of macro-level social behavioral change without micro-level behavioral interaction.\n",

They focus\non the macro-level of society and propose that a positive\nimpact on the collective consciousness of society can be pre-\ndicted, generated, and its influence measured in terms of\ndecreased homicide and violent crime.\nAlthough the rates of violent crime and murder in the\nUnited States have declined significantly since the early\ntigation, 2011), the cause of that decline remains, in large\npart, unclear to behavioral and social scientists, with factors\ndiscussed for the 1990s decline including police numbers\nand policing strategies, changing demographics, reduction of\nchildhood exposure to lead, increased prison populations,\nwaning crack market, immigration, and improved security\nmakers lack clear direction for effecting further reduction.\nThe rate of murder in the United States remains higher than\nother developed countries such as Canada, Australia, New\nZealand, and the countries of Western Europe (United\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2011), and thus, further\ninsight into any factors contributing to violent crime that can\nbe influenced by intervention is very valuable.\nA number of theories have historically been proposed to\naccount for the incidence of homicide and violent crime,\nreflecting what may well be a multicausal phenomenon. One\ndistinction among theories of violent crime is between theo-\nries that emphasize its social and ecological conditions\n(places) and theories that emphasize the individuals (people)\nmost susceptible to crimes. For example, social disorganiza-\ntion theory has historically focused on the community fac-\ntors such as poverty, residential instability, and social\nnetworks that influence a community's ability to control\nbehavior (Kubrin & Weitzer, 2003) and was substantially\nwho found that the Chicago neighborhood factors predicted\ndelinquency rates over time despite the neighborhoods'\nchanging ethnic or racial makeup. The present study con-\ncerns short-term changes in the national level of homicide\nand violent crime rather than prediction of community varia-\ntions, so the social disorganization perspective is of limited\nrelevance, although prior research related to the hypothesis\nof this study, reviewed below, controls for, and thus appears\nindependent of, many community-related variables.\n1Maharishi University of Management, Fairfield, IA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMichael C.

This frustra-\ntion might arise from strain due to lack of economic opportu-\nnity for advancement (Cloward & Ohlin, 1960; Merton,\ninability to avoid aversive situations and achieve goals\n(Agnew, 2007), or due to social disruption or disorganiza-\ntion, affecting family and community structures (Shaw &\nat least control aggression.\nThe study of social stress (Linsky, Bachman, & Straus,\nretical perspective on the frustration-aggression process\nthat has the advantage of connecting with a large body of\nresearch on stress at the individual level (e.g., Mueller,\ndegree of social stress was a strong predictor of violent\ncrime rate (VCR) among the states of the United States,\nusing a state stress index (SSI) of 1976 data to quantify\neconomic, family, and community stressors. The relation-\nship of the SSI to rates of homicide, rape, robbery, and\naggravated assault was significant taking into account a\nnumber of control and potentially moderating variables.\nThe creation of the SSI was based on the \"life events\"\napproach to conceptualization of stress, assuming that the\naccumulation of many challenging events places increasing\nstress on the individual, with potentially negative health\nconsequences (Holmes & Masuda, 1974). Because this life-\nevents approach to defining stress is applied to societal\nrather than individual data, there is considerable overlap of\nvariables considered by the social stress approach and\nsocial disorganization theory, and Linsky and Straus (1986)\nanalyzed the area of commonality and uniqueness in these\ntwo conceptualizations. Subsequently, Linsky et al. (1995)\nreplicated the finding of an association between higher\nsocial stress (measured by the SSI with 1982 data) and\nhigher homicide rate (HOM). Controlling for urbanization\nand racial composition of the states, the relationship of\nsocial stress to homicide was also independent of indices\nmeant to measure weak social control, economic depriva-\ntion, and cultural support for violence.\nAt the individual level, some of the behavioral and physi-\nological effects of stress have been found associated with\naggression. For example, offenders guilty of homicide were\nfound to have more stressful and more chronically stressful\nlife experiences than nonviolent offenders (Humphrey &\nPalmer, 1986). Disruption of parenting and of family func-\ntioning, a significant stress for the growing child, has been\nfound to be a major mediating factor for the historically stud-\nied societal influences of poverty and social disorganization\nthat contribute to high rates of crime and delinquency\nphysiological imbalances consequent to repeated stress have\nbeen found to be associated with aggression and violence\nThe intervention investigated in this study is a practice\nfound by previous research to reduce stress and crime at the\nindividual and social levels, the Transcendental Medita-\ntion\u00ae technique and its advanced practice, the TM-Sidhi\u00ae\nprogram.1 The Transcendental Meditation technique is a\nmental procedure founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and\nintroduced to the West from India in the late 1950s; it is prac-\nticed 15 to 20 min twice daily and is described as systematic\nbut involving no effort, beliefs, or specific lifestyle and\nrequiring no specific mental abilities on the part of the prac-\ntitioner (Roth, 1994). The procedure is said to allow the indi-\nvidual to experience more silent levels of awareness, leading\nto the experience of \"pure consciousness\"--consciousness\nwithout the mental activity of perception or thought\n(Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1967). The advanced TM-Sidhi\nprogram, practiced following Transcendental Meditation, is\nsaid to develop the ability to function from this silent mental\nstate of pure consciousness and thereby activate this field of\npure consciousness more effectively for greater impact on\nthe individual and society (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1986).\nThe implications of a \"field\" character of pure consciousness\nfor societal effects are noted below. Group practice of the\nTM-Sidhi program is identical to individual practice except\nfor large number of individuals being together.\nDuring Transcendental Meditation, the process of\nincreased mental silence has been found to correspond to a\ndistinct physiological state of restful alertness that is associ-\nated, in comparison with eyes-closed rest, with reduced\nrespiratory rate, reduced plasma lactate levels, reduced skin\nconductance, greater excretion of the serotonin metabolite\n5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and increased coherence of\nelectroencephalographic activity, particularly in the frontal\nDillbeck & Orme-Johnson, 1987; Travis & Arenander,\n2006). Outside of the practice, randomized controlled\nresearch found greater integration of brain functioning dur-\ning task performance and more effective galvanic skin resis-\ntance responses to stress among those learning and practicing\nthe Transcendental Meditation technique over a 10-week\nperiod in contrast to controls (Travis et al., 2009).\nIn research on the individual level related to violent crime,\nlongitudinal studies among prison inmates, either using ran-\ndomized controlled trial (Ramirez, 1989), matched group\n(Abrams & Siegel, 1978), or active control group (Alexander\n& Orme-Johnson, 2003) designs, have indicated a corre-\nsponding reduction in hostility, aggression, and neuroticism\namong those learning the Transcendental Meditation tech-\nnique compared with controls. In addition, they indicate\nreduced recidivism for periods of study ranging from 3 to 15\nyears after release (Alexander, Rainforth, Frank, Grant, &\nThere is also a body of research on the application of the\nTranscendental Meditation technique for crime prevention\non the broader societal level, especially through group\nDillbeck and Cavanaugh 3\npractice of the advanced TM-Sidhi program. This research\nfrom the Vedic tradition of knowledge by the founder of\nthese practices that as few as 1% of the population of a soci-\nety practicing Transcendental Meditation, or as few as the\nsquare root of that number practicing the advanced TM-Sidhi\nprogram together as a group twice daily, would have a stress-\nreducing effect of greater harmony on the collective con-\nsciousness of the whole society (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi,\nretical premise that there is an underlying level of connection\nbetween individuals (as noted above, termed a field of pure\nconsciousness) through which coherence may be propagated,\nor stress reduced, in society. The square root term in the pre-\ndicted effect of group practice of the TM-Sidhi program\nderives from the study of coherent systems in physics, in\nwhich the combined intensity of coherent elements is pro-\nportional to the square of the number of elements (Hagelin,\n1987, p. 65). Due to the nonlinear nature of the square root\nformula for this predicted effect of group practice of the\nTM-Sidhi program, it would be possible to influence very\nlarge social units; for example 1% of a city of one million\npeople would require a TM-Sidhi group of 100, or for the\ncurrent U.S. population, a group of almost 1,800.\nA number of published studies have examined this pre-\ndicted effect for crime and violence reduction at the city,\nstate, national, and regional or international levels. (In the\nresearch studies, this effect has been termed the Maharishi\neffect after Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who predicted it as early\nas 1960 based on the Vedic knowledge.) The early studies\nexamined the percentage of Transcendental Meditation par-\nticipants in cities in relation to crime rate changes using\nannual data. The first published study found that when small\ncities reached 1% of their population instructed in the\nTranscendental Meditation technique, they showed reduced\nrate of FBI Part 1 crimes the next year and a decreasing trend\nthe following years, compared with matched control cities.\nThis study statistically controlled for eight candidate crime-\nrelated demographic variables on which the groups of cities\ndiffered: population, population density, median education,\npopulation stability, per capita income, percentage below\npoverty level, unemployment, and percentage aged 15 to 29\n(Dillbeck, Landrith, & Orme-Johnson, 1981). Two studies,\nusing cross-lagged panel analysis among random samples of\n160 cities and of 80 metropolitan areas, were consistent with\nthe hypothesis of a causal influence of the proportion of\nTranscendental Meditation participants on decreased crime\nrate. The cross-lagged panel analysis examined patterns of\ncorrelation over time using either raw correlations or partial\ncorrelations, controlling for demographic variables that were\npredictive of crime in those samples (Dillbeck, Banus,\nPolanzi, & Landrith, 1988). That is, increased Transcendental\nMeditation participation predicted decreased crime rate, but\nnot vice versa. In the cross-lagged panel analysis of cities,\nthe 10 variables serving as potential statistical controls were\nequivalent to the list above (for Dillbeck et al., 1981) with\nthe addition of police per population and the use of two age\ndistribution indicators--median age and percentage above\nage 65. In the cross-lagged panel analysis of metropolitan\nareas, the 13 demographic control variables examined also\nincluded change in population since last census, area,\nAfrican-American population, change in African-American\npopulation since last census, and college students (police\ncoverage and population above age 65 were not available at\nthe metropolitan level). Based on these city and metropolitan\narea studies, the effect under study seems to be independent\nof the demographic variables used to predict crime at the\nurban level.\nThe advantage of subsequent studies on group practice of\nthe advanced TM-Sidhi program and social indicators is that\nthe greater hypothesized societal effect (1%) allows quasi-\nexperimental interventions to be performed using a finer\ntime scale of analysis when groups of TM-Sidhi program\nparticipants are brought together temporarily or when more\npermanent groups are created. To be explicit, the decision\nrule used to predict a hypothesized influence in a specific\nlocation and time has been to predict an effect during, or\nimmediately after, the time when the size of the TM-Sidhi\ngroup reaches 1% of the population of the largest social unit\nfor which consistent objective behavioral data are available.\n\"Social unit\" has been operationalized in terms of govern-\nmental/administrative units--city, metropolitan area, state,\nand nation. Extending this prediction principle to the regional\nor international level, an effect was predicted when the size\nof the group reached 1% of the combined population of\nadjacent countries (Assimakis & Dillbeck, 1995) or the com-\nbined population of all countries within a given distance\nfrom the group (Davies & Alexander, 2005) or the combined\npopulation globally (Orme-Johnson, Dillbeck, & Alexander,\nMost of the TM-Sidhi group studies have used autore-\ngressive integrated moving averages time series analysis\n(Box & Jenkins, 1976) to rigorously estimate the effect on\nsocietal parameters of specific periods in which large groups\nof TM-Sidhi program participants practicing together twice\ndaily have been established for various lengths of time; these\nstatistical methods model and control for the time depen-\ndence of the outcome measures, including seasonality and\ntrends. For example, Dillbeck, Cavanaugh, Glenn, Orme-\nJohnson, and Mittlefehldt (1987) reported three intervention\nstudies in which reduced crime totals were found at the met-\nropolitan or territorial level during temporary intervention\nperiods when groups of TM-Sidhi participants exceeding the\npredicted threshold were brought together in the union terri-\ntory of Delhi, India (daily Indian Penal Code crime totals); in\nMetro Manila, the Philippines (weekly crime index totals,\nparallel to FBI uniform crime index prior to 1979); and in\nPuerto Rico (monthly Type 1 crimes, also equivalent to pre-\n1979 FBI uniform crime index). An examination of possible\nalternative explanations for these time-specific effects,\n4 SAGE Open\nincluding an analysis by a third party in the case of the Delhi\nresults, did not locate a viable alternative. The time series\nmethodology of these studies and the findings were repli-\ncated in metropolitan Merseyside, United Kingdom, using\nmonthly crime rates from police-reported crime totals\n(Hatchard, Deans, Cavanaugh, & Orme-Johnson, 1996).\nTwo time series transfer function studies that analyzed\nweekly data from metropolitan Washington, D.C. (1981-\nthe creation of large groups of TM-Sidhi program partici-\npants, the effect varying with the size of the group (each\ngroup was above the predicted threshold during the periods\nfirst study measured FBI violent crime totals, estimating a\n9% decrease, and did not find evidence supporting the alter-\nnative hypotheses of demographic changes (youth popula-\ntion), neighborhood crime watch programs, or changes in\nfunction study in Washington D.C., (Hagelin et al., 1999)\nwas a prospective study in which predictions were given in\nadvance to a 27-member project review board of academic\nand civic leaders. Due to different seasonal patterns, it sepa-\nrately analyzed homicide, rape, and aggravated assault data\n(termed HRA crimes in the study) from robbery data, the\nfourth violent crime subcategory, and subsequently jointly\nestimated the two models for these two categories, yielding a\nreduction for total violent crime of 15.6%. The HRA analysis\ncontrolled for weekly variations in temperature, which were\nstrongly positively associated with those crimes; in the case\nof modeling robberies, the prior seasonal pattern (1988-\n1992) was included as a significant predictor. These were the\nonly control variables found to be significant by multiple\nregression, from a set of potential control variables that\nincluded seasonal crime cycles, temperature, precipitation,\nhumidity, daylight hours, changes in police and community\nanti-crime activities, prior crime trends in Washington D.C.,\nand concurrent crime trends in New York and Philadelphia\nA similar transfer function analysis found reduced daily\ncrime totals in Jerusalem and also in Israel as a whole, as\nwell as changes in other dependent variables, following\nincreases in the size of a group of TM-Sidhi program partici-\npants (Orme-Johnson, Alexander, Davies, Chandler, &\nLarimore, 1988). The authors subsequently responded to a\nmethodological critique by showing their time series conclu-\nsions to be independent of the stochastic \"noise\" model spec-\nified (Orme-Johnson, Alexander, & Davies, 1990). Studies\nusing both transfer function and intervention time series\nmethods found reduction in violent deaths as measured\nweekly by the total of homicides, suicide, and motor vehicle\nfatalities at the national level in the United States and Canada\nin the 1980s when the size of a large group of TM-Sidhi par-\nticipants was above the predicted threshold for the United\nStates and for the United States plus Canada, respectively,\nThe purpose of the two studies reported here was to evaluate\nthe effect, on homicide and violent crime at the national level in\nthe United States, of a recently established large group of\nTM-Sidhi program participants that has, for a period, reached\nsufficient size to predict a national effect. The rapid establish-\nment of this group offered a clear opportunity for intervention\nresearch. This research is designed as a quasi-experimental\nintervention, for which the intervention variable broadly\napproximates a step function, and this is simply modeled by a\nbinary variable. The central hypothesis, consistent with prior\nresearch, is that of a significant impact of the independent vari-\nable in terms of decreased rates of homicide and violent crime.\nGeneral Method\nIntervention\nThe studies reported in this article use time series regression\nto assess whether there is a change of trend in measures of\nU.S. homicide and violent crime associated with an interven-\ntion based on group practice of the TM-Sidhi program. To\nassess the predicted effect on HOM and VCR of the largest\ngroup of TM-Sidhi participants in North America, the inde-\npendent (intervention) variable used in the analysis was a\nbinary intervention indicator based on the size of this group.\nThis group is located in Fairfield, Iowa, at Maharishi\nUniversity of Management, where students, faculty, staff,\nandcommunitymembersgathertopracticetheTranscendental\nMeditation and TM-Sidhi program together before and after\nthe school or workday. Daily totals are recorded morning and\nevening from the meditation halls on campus.\nStarting in July 2006, a concerted effort was made by uni-\nversity leaders to expand the size of the TM-Sidhi program\ngroup from less than 1,000 to a number sufficient to predict\na positive influence generated for the whole population of\nmillion population at that time, according to the 1% for-\nmula). At the time of inaugurating the endeavor, based on the\ntheoretical principles and previous research, reduced violent\ncrime was publicly predicted to be a measurable effect when\nthe size of the group was sufficiently large. A course was\nheld (termed Invincible America Assembly) for visitors from\nother parts of the country and world.2 To further supplement\nthe size of the group, a special program was created starting\nin November 2006 for a large group of several hundred visit-\ning Indian experts in the TM-Sidhi program on a nearby\ncampus. As a result, the size of the groups began to exceed\nthe predicted threshold in January 2007.\nThe binary intervention variable (I\nt\n) was specified as 0\nto December 2010. (At the time of beginning the study, this\nwas the full time series possible, since 2010 was the latest\nyear for which homicide and crime data files containing\nmonthly data were available, and archival data for the group\nsize had been lost for several years prior to July 2001.)\nDillbeck and Cavanaugh 5\nData Analysis\nThe statistical analysis empirically tests the hypothesis that a\nsignificant reduction in the trend rate of growth of homicide\nand violent crime occurred beginning with the onset of the\nintervention period in January 2007. The outcome measures\ninclude the U.S. national HOM as well as the VCR and rate of\nmurder with non-negligent manslaughter (MUR) in 206\nlarger cities that report uninterrupted monthly data for these\nmeasures. To analyze the results of this prospective quasi-\nexperiment, we use intervention analysis or interrupted time\nseries analysis (Chelimsky, Shadish, & Orwin, 1997; Cook &\nReichardt, & Sanna, 2000; Shadish, Cook, & Campbell,\nuses time series regression to estimate a broken-trend, or seg-\nmented-trend, intervention model for each outcome variable\ntion model in each case includes a pre-intervention linear\ntrend with an exogenous structural break at the theoretically\npredicted date of December 2006. As noted above, a shift to a\ndecreased rate of growth in homicide and violent crime begin-\nning in January 2007 was predicted because in that month the\naverage daily size of the TM-Sidhi group in Fairfield, Iowa,\nexceeded the theoretically predicted critical threshold of 1%\nof the U.S. population and remained above or relatively near\nthat level for the final 4 years of the sample.\nStudy 1--National HOM\nDependent Variable\nThe dependent monthly variable for Study 1 was national\nU.S. rate of homicide (Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention [CDC], 2012). The homicide data were converted\ninto rates per 100 million population using U.S. total popula-\ntion estimates calculated by monthly linear interpolation\nbetween the two U.S. census counts of April 2000 and April\nsame rate of change). This rate was further divided by the\nnumber of days in the month. This last operation was to\nequate all the months in length, so that any annual seasonal-\nity would be the result of annual factors that were not simply\nthe sequential pattern of number of days in the month. Thus,\nthe monthly figure represents the daily rate of homicide for\nthat month per 100 million population.\nResults\nPlot of monthly U.S. HOM. Panel (a) of Figure 1 displays the\nplot of HOM, and panel (b) shows the plot of the average\ndaily size of the TM-Sidhi group (GROUP) for each month.\neffective sample size T = 98, which is used for all statistical\nanalyses reported below. The initial date of the sample was\nselected to avoid large outliers associated with the huge\nspike in homicide totals due to the September 11 tragedy in\n2001 and give the largest possible sample after allowing for\nlags and differencing of outcome variables required in diag-\nnostic testing of the statistical assumption of stationarity.\nStrong monthly seasonal variation in HOM is apparent in\nthe plot as well as a relatively flat overall trend in the pre-\nintervention period. With the onset of the intervention period\nin January 2007 (shown by the vertical line), HOM displays\na shift to a declining trend that continues through the end of\nthe sample.\nIn January 2007, the monthly average daily size of the\nTM-Sidhi group reached 1,748, rising for the first time in the\nsample above the predicted critical threshold of 1,725, the\n1% of the U.S. population at that time. From July 2006,\nwhen the larger Iowa assembly began, through January 2007,\nthe average size of the group rose rapidly from the level of\nis 587 participants for the 50 months of the pre-intervention\nperiod and 1,792 for the 48 months of the intervention period.\nThe GROUP series thus approximates a step function, with\nthe group size well below threshold in the pre-intervention\nperiod and above or relatively near it in the intervention\nperiod. Thus, in the broken-trend model described below, the\nintervention component is modeled as a binary (0-1) step\nfunction (I\nt\n) that triggers a shift in the trend function at the\nend of the pre-intervention period.\nRegression results for HOM.To test the hypothesis of a\ndecrease in the growth rate for HOM, we estimate the follow-\ning broken-trend, piecewise-linear intervention model that\nincorporates a shift of linear trend beginning with the onset\nof the intervention period (January 2007):\nt t\nj\njt j t\n= + + -\n( ) + +\n\u00b5 \n   \nIn Equation 1, \u00b5 is the regression intercept, t is a linear\ntime trend t T\n , and \nis the pre-intervention\nmonthly growth rate for HOM.

The regression coefficient (\n- \n) for DT\nt\ngives the\nchange in the growth rate of HOM from the pre-intervention\nrate (\n) to the rate in the intervention period (\n). The\nhypothesis of a reduction in the rate of growth in HOM dur-\ning the intervention period implies (\n- \nThe summation term in Equation 1 is a deterministic sea-\nsonal component to control for the monthly seasonal varia-\ntion in HOM. The seasonal component consists of 11 binary\n(0-1) seasonal dummy variables D\nj\n(with monthly index\n and January denoted by j = 1; Granger &\nNewbold, 1986).

Consistent with the predicted reduction in growth rate\nduring the intervention period, the estimated regression\ncoefficient for the trend shift variable DT (see Table 1) is\nnegative and highly significant. Although we have a direc-\ntional hypothesis, to be conservative, two-tailed tests are used\nfor all estimated intervention coefficients reported in Tables 1\nand 2. Relative to the pre-intervention trend, the estimated\ntrend shift after December 2006 implies a cumulative reduc-\ntion of 3.5035 in the expected value of HOM over the\nFigure 1. Plots of monthly homicide rate (HOM) and size of the TM-Sidhi participants group (GROUP).\nNote. In panel (a), the plot of HOM for Nov. 2002 to Dec. 2010 displays strong monthly seasonality, a relatively flat pre-intervention trend, and a shift to\na declining trend in the intervention period starting January 2007 (shown by the vertical line in the plot). Panel (b) shows the plot of the monthly average\ndaily size of the TM-Sidhi group. The group size rose rapidly beginning in July 2006 until in January 2007 it rose for the first time above the theoretically\npredicted critical threshold of 1,725, 1% of the U.S. population at that time. The average size of the group is 587 participants for the 50 pre-intervention\nmonths and 1,792 for the 48 months of the intervention period. HOM = homicide rate.

The\ncumulative reduction in homicode per 100 million population\ntranslates to a total expected reduction of 8,157 homicides for\nthe intervention period. Thus, the estimated change in trend\nfor U.S. homicides has the predicted negative sign and is both\nstatistically and practically significant.\nRegression diagnostics for HOM analysis. Diagnostic tests for\nadequacy of the estimated model are summarized in Table 1.\nThe Breusch\u00adGodfrey Lagrange multiplier (LM) test for\nserial correlation of the regression residuals (Godfrey, 1978)\nindicates that the null hypothesis of no serial correlation at\nsignificantly different from 0 at the 5% level. To correct for\nthis modest serial correlation of residuals, Table 1 reports t\nratios calculated using standard errors that are valid (consis-\ntent) in the presence of residual autocorrelation and het-\neroscedasticity of possibly unknown form (Newey & West,\nAlthough some mild autocorrelation is present, the resid-\nuals from the estimated model approximate a white noise\nseries and are clearly stationary. This suggests that HOM is\nbroken-trend stationary (broken TS), exhibiting covariance\nstationary (or weakly stationary) fluctuations around a bro-\nken trend. A time series is said to be covariance stationary if\nits mean, variance, and auto correlations (or, equivalently, its\nauto covariances) are invariant with respect to a change in\nStationarity of the regression residuals is required for\nvalid statistical inferences regarding the estimated regression\nparameters in the intervention model (Banerjee, Dolado,\nNewbold, 1974). Broken TS for HOM implies that the OLS\nregression estimates in Table 1 have standard distributions\nand thus the observed significant change in trend is unlikely\nto be the result of the \"spurious regression\" phenomenon\nspurious regressions can result when time trends are fitted to\nnonstationary variables that contain a random walk compo-\nnent (\"stochastic trend\"). A key signature of spurious regres-\nsions is highly autocorrelated, nonstationary regression\nresiduals. The latter violate the distributional assumptions\nunderlying statistical inference for time series regression.\nTable 1 also reports a formal test for broken TS (Perron,\n.01) that the HOM time series is a nonstationary random\nalternative hypothesis is that HOM displays stationary fluc-\ntuations around a linear trend with a known, one-time break\nin the trend function in December 2006.8 The test allows for\na possible gradual adjustment of the trend to its new value in\nthe intervention period (\"innovations outlier\" type model;\nThe Perron test assumes that the time of the structural\nbreak is known (exogenous; Perron, 1989). The results of the\ntest may be misleading if the date of the break is unknown\nand must be determined from the data (Christiano, 1992;\nZivot & Andrews, 1992). The assumption of an exogenous\nstructural break is appropriate for the current intervention\nstudy because the date of the hypothesized trend break for\nthe violent crime measures examined in this article was\nTable 1.

The RESET\ntest (regression specification test) does not reject the null\nhypothesis that the functional form of the regression equa-\ntion is correctly specified (Ramsey, 1969).

Finally, the null\nhypothesis of no autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic-\nity (ARCH) of the model residuals (Engle, 1982) also is not\nrejected by the LM test for ARCH. In sum, the diagnostic\ntests for model adequacy support statistical conclusion valid-\nity for the statistical inferences reported in Table 1.\nStudy 2--Urban VCR\nDependent Variable\nThe dependent variable for Study 2 is monthly rate of violent\ncrime, reported by the FBI Uniform Crime Report system as\ncomprising murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible\nrape, aggravated assault, and robbery. In addition, murder\ntogether with non-negligent manslaughter was analyzed sep-\narately as the most serious and precisely measured of the vio-\nlent crime categories and for comparison with the CDC\nhomicide data (details available from authors). Monthly data\nsuitable for time series analysis are not published for the\nUnited States as a whole by the FBI, but the FBI Multimedia\nProductions Group provided computer files of Return A\nMaster Files, containing all Uniform Crime Report data for\neach month of a given year for each city or other geographi-\ncal unit and the population estimate for that city. These files\nviolent crime totals were extracted for each city with more\navailable. The annual population figure for each city was\nused to derive monthly population estimates for that city by\nlinear interpolation (the listed annual estimate was taken as\nthe April figure, because this listed figure coincided with the\nofficial U.S. Census Bureau count published as an April fig-\nure for census years).

(The calculation for MUR was done in a parallel\nway using only the data for murder and non-negligent man-\nslaughter per 100 million population). For each month, the\ntotal incidence of violent crime (murder, forcible rape, aggra-\nvated assault, and robbery) for the 206 cities was divided by\nthe summed monthly population estimate of the 206 cities,\nmultiplied by one million (i.e., rate per one million popula-\ntion), and divided by the number of days in the month. Thus,\nthe monthly figure represents the daily rate of violent crime\nfor that month per one million population in the 206 cities.\nThe different population ratios used in this study for violent\ncrime (per one million) and in Study 1 for homicide (per 100\nmillion) were used such that the resulting rates would be of\nthe same order of magnitude.\nResults\nPlot of monthly VCR.The plot of VCR in Figure 2 displays\nstrong monthly seasonality as well as a flat pre-intervention\ntrend. In the intervention period, VCR shifts to a declining\ntrend.\nRegression results forVCR. To test the hypothesis of a decrease\nin the trend growth rate for VCR during the intervention\nperiod, we estimate the following broken-trend intervention\nmodel:\nt t\nt\nk\nkt k t\n= + + -\n( ) +\n+ +\n-\n\u00b5\n \n  \n\n.\nIn this case, lag 1 of VCR\nt\nis required to model its autore-\ngressive dynamics, and all other terms are defined as in\nEquation 1.\nTable 2 summarizes the OLS regression results for\nEquation 2. The pre-intervention growth rate for VCR does\nnot differ significantly from 0. Consistent with theoretical\nprediction, the change in trend following the onset of the\nintervention is negative and highly significant.\nThe estimated coefficient for the change in trend DT\nt\nin\nTable 2 gives the immediate impact of the intervention. The\nfirst-order autoregressive dynamics of VCR\nt\nimplies a grad-\nual adjustment of the trend to its new value in the interven-\ntion period. If (1 - \n)  0, it can be shown that the total\nchange in trend is given by  = (\n- \nt\nin the\nsteady state, or static long-run, equation for VCR (Hendry,\nvalue and does not necessarily imply a long period of time\n(Hendry, 1995).

Each of the diagnostic tests for\nadequacy of the estimated model is satisfactory. No regres-\nsion residuals exceed 3.5 standard errors, indicating the\nabsence of extreme outliers. Both LM tests for autocorrela-\ntion of residuals are not significant, and no individual auto-\ncorrelations at lags 1 to 24 are significant at the 5% level.\nThat the residuals appear to be serially uncorrelated, station-\nary white noise, lends empirical support to the conclusion\nthat VCR is likely broken TS. This conclusion is further sup-\nported by the Perron test reported in Table 2, which rejects\nthe null hypothesis of nonstationarity at the 2.5% level.12\nMurder rate--Secondary analysis.As noted above, we also\nanalyzed data on the rate of FBI-reported murder and non-\nnegligent manslaughter (MUR) in the subsample of 206 cit-\nies. Due to space limitations, only summary results are listed\nhere; more detailed results are available from the authors.\nUsing an intervention model for MUR having the same\nform as given by Equation 1 for HOM, the regression results\ninclude a nonsignificant pre-intervention trend and a signifi-\ncant shift to a declining trend in the intervention period (p <\n.001). The Perron test rejects nonstationarity at the 1% level,\nand all other diagnostic tests for the MUR model are also\nsatisfactory.\nThe estimated trend shift implies a 28.40% total reduction\n7.10% annually, relative to the pre-intervention trend. For\nthese 206 urban areas, whose pre-intervention murder rates\nwere substantially higher than the national average, the esti-\n2.4 times greater than that for HOM in the United States as a\nwhole and 1.34 times as great when the percentage changes\nare compared.\nDiscussion\nFor each of the three measures of violent crime examined in\nthis study, the intervention analysis based on time series\nregression rejects the null hypothesis of no effect of the quasi-\nexperimental intervention on the trend rates of change during\ncally significant reductions in the trend rate of growth are\nfound in each case, with the shift in trend occurring, as pre-\ndicted, with the onset of the quasi-experimental intervention\nin January 2007. A battery of diagnostic tests indicates satis-\nfaction of the key statistical assumptions of the analysis, thus\nsupporting statistical conclusion validity.

Common to all intervention\nanalyses of quasi-experiments, a limitation of the study is the\nthreat internal validity posed by potential omitted variables\nmajor consideration is alternative hypotheses.\nFor example, one might consider the very significant eco-\nnomic changes of the late 2000s, for which increased unem-\nployment is a primary indicator, as an alternative hypothesis\nfor the observed national decline in homicide and violent\ncrime. However, although the relationship of unemployment\nand crime is complex (Rosenfeld & Messner, 2013),\nincreased unemployment is generally associated with\nincreased crime, especially in the longer term (Aaltonen,\nMacDonald, Martikainen, & Kivivuori, 2013; Cantor &\nunemployment during the intervention period does not\nexplain the measured decreases in HOM and VCR over the\nunemployment began in 2008, a year later than the observed\neffects of the study began to be measured. Also, as pointed\nout by Richard Rosenfeld, past president of the American\nSociety of Criminology, the recession of December 2007 to\nJune 2009 was the first time rates of violent crime failed to\nrise during a substantial U.S. economic downturn since\nIncarceration rates are understood to be negatively corre-\nlated with rates of crime (Marvell & Moody, 1994), but\nprison admissions and prison releases converged from 2006\nto 2009, slowing the growth of the U.S. prison population,\nand in 2010, prison releases exceeded prison admissions for\nthe first time for which records are available (Guerino,\npredict increased rather than decreased violent crime. Also,\nthe proportion of youth aged 18 to 25 positively correlated\nwith higher homicide or violent crime (Nivette, 2011) was\nthus, would not predict reduced rates of homicide or violent\ncrime. Recent attention has been given to the role of tem-\nperature on interpersonal violence (Hsiang, Burke, & Miguel,\n2013), with an estimated 4% increase in violence for one\nstandard deviation of warmer temperature; but again, any\nrecent trend to warmer temperature would not predict a\nresulting decrease in violence, and the seasonal variations in\nviolence associated with annual cycles of temperature are\nmodeled by the seasonal parameters of the analyses per-\nformed here.\nFigure 2. Plot of monthly VCR.\nNote. The plot of VCR for Nov. 2002 to Dec. 2010 displays strong monthly seasonal variation, a relatively flat overall trend in the pre-intervention period,\nand beginning with the onset of the intervention period in January 2007 (see vertical line in the plot), a shift to a declining trend that continues through\nthe end of the sample in December 2010. VCR = violent crime rate.\nDillbeck and Cavanaugh 11\nMore effective policing strategies may also contribute to\nreduced rates of homicide and violent crime in some cities;\nhowever, cities around the United States would have had to\nimplement more effective policing strategies almost simulta-\nneously in 2007 to explain the observed effects. Increased\nuse of surveillance technology may have a deterrent effect,\nparticularly on property crime, but violent crime and homi-\ncide, to which impulsiveness and alcohol use contribute sig-\nnificantly (Roizen, 1997), may be more resistant to these\ntype of deterrence effects; again, a nearly simultaneous\nimplementation in cities around the United States is also\nrequired to serve as an alternative explanation of the mea-\nsured effects.\nIn addition to the apparent lack of compelling alternative\nexplanations for the empirically observed effects, additional\nsupport for the conclusion that the independent variable may\npossibly have contributed to the observed decline in rates of\nboth homicide and violent crime is that the findings of this\narticle further replicate those of 12 previous studies of this\neffect published in eight peer-reviewed articles. These arti-\ncles report statistically significant reductions in crime or vio-\nlence and were reviewed above with a citation of alternative\ndemographic or environmental factors influencing crime for\nwhich each study controlled or examined. The studies\nreported in the current article are part of a more comprehen-\nsive empirical evaluation by the current authors (in prepara-\ntion) of the impact of this prospective quasi-experiment on\nU.S. quality-of-life measures, using the same methodology\nas this article.\nMethodological issues aside, what is the most effective\nway to conceptualize this extended effect apparently associ-\nated with a small group? That is, if the effect is non-spurious,\nhow to explain the far-reaching influence?\nTurning first to the founder of the program, both macro-\nlevel connections and a deeper connection between individu-\nals are proposed to contribute to this effect. Each level of\nsociety (family, community, city, state, nation, world) is pos-\nited to have a corresponding collective consciousness that\nresults from the combined quality of consciousness of all the\nindividuals in the society (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1977).\nThe quality of that collective consciousness--for example,\nstressed, violent, peaceful--in turn is an input to the experi-\nence of all the component individuals through the general\nquality of the atmosphere and the myriad social interactions\nthrough which that quality is expressed. The group practice\nof the TM-Sidhi program is predicted to alleviate stress in the\ncollective consciousness, thereby reducing stress and vio-\nlence in individual behavior.\nIn addition to this macro-social reciprocal influence\nbetween individual and society, the Vedic tradition describes\nthe character of pure consciousness (experienced during the\nTranscendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi program) ulti-\nmately as a universal substrate fundamental to the conscious-\nness of each individual (e.g., Radhakrishnan, 1968) and that\nthe beneficial effects of that experience are thus shared to\nsome degree by others (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1986). This\nnon-behavioral influence on others is proposed to interact\nwith the levels of collective consciousness of society such\nthat an influence would measurably affect the largest social\nunit of which the group is a part, if the size of the group\nexceeds a threshold (1%, as noted earlier) for the popula-\ntion of that social unit. If the size of the group substantially\nexceeds the predicted required amount for a societal unit\n(e.g., nation), then previous research has presumed a proxim-\nity effect for nearby nations, assuming the size of the group\nis sufficient for the total population of the countries. One\nmight ask whether proximity should enter into consideration\nat all if pure consciousness is described as a universal sub-\nstrate of consciousness. The most salient evidence related to\nthat consideration is that the predicted group size required to\ncreate a measurable global influence is the 1% of the\nworld's population (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1986) that was\napproached or exceeded on occasions of some weeks in the\nsurable time series results on international conflict and inter-\nnational terrorism (Orme-Johnson et al., 2003). For the\nworld's present population, the group size predicted to be\nrequired is about 8,500. One way to view the predicted\nnonlocal influence is that the hypothesized substrate prop-\nerty of pure consciousness is a field property, perhaps at\nmore unified levels of natural law (Hagelin, 1987), although\nan inverse square law for diffusion of a force over distance is\nnot posited, as indicated above in the context of levels of\nsociety.\nAre there more familiar concepts of consciousness and\nsocial interaction that can account for the empirical findings\nof the present and related studies? One immediate hypothesis\ncould be the high level of interconnectedness within and\nbetween societies that has emerged in the past two decades,\nexpressed in social media and seen in the more instant com-\nmunication of events nationally and internationally. Thus,\nperhaps the influence of a group of individuals experiencing\ngreater peace in their personal lives could be amplified and\nspread through their interactions online. Similarly, the\n\"extended mind\" hypothesis, that cognition should be con-\nceptualized as including the environmental elements of the\nperson\u00adenvironment interaction, gains broader extension\nthrough current social interaction technology; new properties\nemerge from the person\u00adenvironment interaction as indi-\ncated by a dynamical systems analysis even in the minimal\ncase using robotic artificial nervous systems (Froese,\nThere are two points of evidence suggesting that a com-\nmunication technology explanation for the current results is\nnot likely to be the case, one based on previous studies and\none specific to this study. Previous research on this phenom-\nenon, particularly in studies from the early 1980s to early\n1990s, has found similar effects from an equivalent group of\nTM-Sidhi participants (1% of the social unit), even though\nmany of these studies predated wide access to the Internet,\nand in some cases, predating the widespread use of personal\nfrom the current study is that the group was increased to the\nsize predicted to influence the whole U.S. population by a\nprivate grant supporting a subgroup of participants --young\ntrained experts from India who had little interaction with the\nU.S. social environment. This subgroup averaged 27% of the\n2010. The organizers for this group reported that the majority\nof these guests did not speak English (Hindi was their mother\ntongue) and to physically and culturally care for their wel-\nfare, separate campus facilities were provided which hap-\npened to have very little Internet access, although they had\nmobile phones to speak with their families in India. Thus,\nthey had little interaction with the U.S. population through\ncommunication technology.\nHowever, more broadly, research in dynamical systems is\nan alternative approach that could be relevant to the phenom-\nenon of this study. The presumed nonlinear effect of the\ngroups of TM-Sidhi participants and associated presence of\nthreshold effects in social systems of different sizes might\nsuggest the property of a self-organized critical system (Bak\nwork (Barab\u00e1si & Bonabeau, 2003). In the present study, we\ndid not see evidence that the dependent variables were other\nthan stochastic processes (as expected in a time series of this\nlength), but it might be possible to design research within a\ndynamical systems framework.\nIndependent of these theoretical considerations, this\nresearch and the studies that preceded it could potentially\nhave important practical considerations for crime preven-\ntion. So far, this research has relied solely on private well\nwishers to implement such preventive groups and study their\neffects. But, because such groups are centralized rather than\ndiffused and do not require behavioral interference with the\nlarger population, governments are in an effective position to\nestablish and evaluate interventions using this procedure.\n"
