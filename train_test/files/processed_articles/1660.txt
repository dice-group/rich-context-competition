Notable limitations of these\nstudies include reliance on self-report of anthropomet\nry or\nlack of representation of the general population. In \naddition,\ncomparison of risks between sexes and age groups has often\nbeen difficult since many studies included only men or\nwomen or have had restricted age variation.\nExamining the influence of age on the relation between\nadiposity and mortality is important, since the health effects\nof adiposity among older adults are unclear. The increased\nrisk of mortality observed at the highest levels of BMI has\nbeen shown to diminish with advancing age suggesting that\nminimum mortality may occur at a higher BMI among older\nadults (15,16). Furthermore, studies of older adults, especially\nthe very old, have reported inverse associations of BMI with\nmortality (7,9,17). Yet, clinical guidelines for optimal body\nweight do not differ between middle-aged and older adults\n(18). Because aging is associated with an increased accumu-\nlation of central fat (19), some investigators have suggested\nthat measures of abdominal adiposity or body fat distribu-\ntion, as opposed to BMI, should be used to evaluate mortal-\nity risk among the elderly (20). Whether abdominal adiposity\nincreases risk of mortality among older adults is unknown\nsince studies have been equivocal, and those that have found\na positive association report only a modest elevation in risk at\nthe highest levels of central obesity (7,9\u00ad12).

Wingard3\nResults of studies comparing overall obesity and abdominal adiposity or body fat distribution with risk of\nmortality have varied considerably. We compared the relative importance and joint association of overall obesity\nand body fat distribution in predicting risk of mortality. Participants included 5,799 men and 6,429 women aged\n30\u00ad102 years enrolled in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who completed a baseline health\nIn multivariable-adjusted analyses, waist-to-thigh ratio (WTR) in both sexes (P\ntrend\n<0.01 for both) and waist-to-hip\nratio (WHR) in women (P\ntrend\n0.001) were positively associated with mortality in middle-aged adults (30\u00ad64 years),\nwhile BMI and waist circumference (WC) exhibited U- or J-shaped associations. Risk of mortality increased with\nadults (65\u00ad102 years), a higher BMI in both sexes (P\ntrend\ntrend\nincreased survival, while remaining measures of body fat distribution exhibited either no association or an inverse\nrelation with mortality. In conclusion, ratio measures of body fat distribution are strongly and positively associated\nwith mortality and offer additional prognostic information beyond BMI and WC in middle-aged adults.

The\nNHANES III included a national, complex multistage, clustered, strati-\nfied probability sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population\naged 2 months and older. Data collection occurred during a home\ninterview and a health examination conducted in a mobile examina-\ntion center. The Institutional Review Board at the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention approved the study design and all participants\nprovided written informed consent.\nnation as part of NHANES III. We excluded pregnant women (n = 70)\nand individuals who were missing information regarding height (n = 25),\nweight (n = 17), or circumference measurements (n = 718). Persons who\nrefused to provide sufficient personal identifying information were also\nexcluded since they were ineligible for vital status follow-up (n = 7). The\nmortality follow-up.\nBaseline measurements\nRace/ethnicity was self-reported and categorized as non-Hispanic\nwhite, non-Hispanic African American, Mexican American, and\nother. Education was classified as less than high school, high school,\nsome college, or college. Current, former, or never smoking was\nbased on the use of cigarettes, cigars, or pipe tobacco. Individuals\nin their lifetime but no longer smoked were considered former\nsmokers. The consumption frequency of alcoholic beverages (beer,\nwine, liquor) and the type and frequency of leisure-time physi-\ncal activities over the past month were assessed. Heart disease\nincluded angina, a physician's diagnosis of congestive heart failure,\nor \nmyocardial infarction. Angina was determined with a series of\nquestions described elsewhere (21). A history of physician diag-\nnosed respiratory disease (chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or\nasthma), cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), or stroke was\nalso queried.\nBody weight to the nearest 0.1kg and standing height to the nearest\n0.1cm were measured using a Toledo electronic scale and Seca sta-\ndiometer. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the\nsquare of height in meters. Trained technicians measured circumfer-\nence measures to the nearest 0.1cm using a steel measuring tape. Waist\nwas measured level with the iliac crest at the end of a normal expiration.\nHip was measured at the widest circumference around the buttocks.\nThigh was measured at the midthigh of the right leg with the right knee\nslightly flexed and both feet flat on the floor. BMI exposure groups\nwere based on standard clinical definitions: underweight, <18.5; \nnormal\nobese class II and III, 35.0. Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and waist-\nto-thigh ratio (WTR) were calculated, and along with waist circumfer-\nence (WC) alone were classified into sex-specific quintiles and tertiles,\nby using cutting points defined by the weighted sex-specific distribution\nof these variables in the sample population.\nHypertension was defined as the average of a maximum of six\nseated blood pressure readings by a trained technician or physician\n140/90mmHg, or use of antihypertensive medication. Diabetes was\ndefined by history (type 1 or type 2), use of diabetes medications, or\na fasting plasma glucose level 126mg/dL. High cholesterol included\na total cholesterol concentration 240mg/dL or use of lipid lowering\nmedication. Hormone replacement therapy use in women was based\non self-report and defined as current or not current use.\nAscertainment of mortality\nWe merged baseline data from NHANES III with follow-up data\nfrom the NHANES III Mortality Study. As part of the NHANES III\nMortality Study, data from the National Death Index, which has been\nshown to capture 93\u00ad98% of all US deaths (22), were used to ascertain\nthe vital status of each cohort member through December 31, 2000.\nInformation obtained from the Mortality Study data included the\nmonth, day, and year in which a person was last known to be alive and\nunderlying cause of death according to International Classification\nof Diseases, Ninth Revision codes before 1999 and International\nClassification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes (in brackets) during\nposity, we chose not to include deaths attributed to external causes\n(e.g., accidents, homicides, poisoning; 81 deaths), including codes\nStatistical analyses\nAll analyses were weighted to the US population to provide nation-\nally representative estimates. SAS-callable SUDAAN statistical soft-\nware, release 9.0 (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park,\nNC) was used to account for the complex survey design, a stratified\nmultistage cluster sample (23). We computed length of follow-up as\nthe time elapsed between the health examination and the date of death\nfor decedents and December 31, 2000, for survivors. Multivariable\nCox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the\nrelation of adiposity with mortality after adjustment for potential con-\nfounders. We did not adjust for physical activity or possible mediators\nof obesity effects, such as diabetes, hypertension, or high cholesterol,\nsince doing so would have resulted in overadjustment because of their\nposition on the causal pathway (24). Adjustment for estrogen use in\nwomen had very little, if any, effect on the associations of adiposity with\nmortality and was therefore not included. Linear trends were exam-\nined with the inclusion of adiposity as an ordinal variable within the\nmultivariable models. Models including BMI and WC in middle-aged\nadults also were fitted with BMI and WC squared to assess nonlinearity.\nand adiposity as well as sex and adiposity in age-stratified models were\ntested. Compliance with the assumption of proportional hazards was\nassured by testing time dependent covariates within age-stratified\n\nmodels. All tests of hypotheses were based on a type I error rate of 0.05\nusing 2-sided tests.\nResults\nOverall, mean age of men at baseline was 54.6 years (s.e., 0.2)\nProportions of men who were white, African American, and\ncardiovascular disease). In general, decedents were older,\nless educated, less physically active, more likely to have been\na \ncurrent smoker, and to have existing disease, hypertension,\nand diabetes at baseline (Table 1). Men who died had a lower\nthigh circumference and greater WTR at baseline than men\nwho survived, while women who died had a greater WC,\nWHR, and WTR, and a lower thigh circumference.\nTable 2 shows the relation of adiposity with total \nmortality\ndiffered significantly between middle-aged and older adults.\nIn middle-aged adults, U- and J-shaped associations of\nBMI with mortality in men and women, respectively, were\narticles\n \nobserved.

This relation became statistically sig-\nnificant; hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) according\ntrend\nThe relation of adiposity with cardiovascular disease mortal-\nity also differed significantly between middle-aged and older\nadults for all measures in men and WC in women (Table 3).\nAmong middle-aged men and women, J-shaped associations\nof BMI with mortality were observed. Cardiovascular \nmortality\nwas 2.8- and 3.2-fold higher across quintiles of WC in middle-\naged men and women, respectively; 5.4- and 4.1-fold across\nquintiles of WHR; and 4.7- and 2.0-fold across quintiles of\nWTR. In older adults, the highest levels of BMI and abdominal\nadiposity or body fat distribution generally \ncarried a \nhazard\nratio of <1 of dying from cardiovascular disease, except for\nWHR and WTR in women, where nonsignificant hazard\nratios >1 were observed.\nWe also determined the combined association of BMI\nand WHR (and WTR) with total and cardiovascular dis-\nease \nmortality while concurrently adjusting for each meas-\nure. These individual relations were virtually unaffected by\nsimultaneous adjustment among men and women in both\nage groups (not shown). In addition, we examined joint asso-\nciations with total mortality by classifying individuals sepa-\nrately by age group, BMI and sex-specific tertiles of WHR,\nand WTR.

The highest levels of abdomi-\nnal adiposity in older adults did not significantly increase risk\nof \nmortality. Among both age groups, these findings were unaf-\nfected by increased early mortality among the leanest adults.\nFor simplicity, clinical guidelines recommend assessing over-\nall obesity and abdominal adiposity via BMI and WC, respec-\ntively (18). The use of WC alone or in combination with hip or\nthigh circumferences to reflect abdominal adiposity remains a\ncontroversial topic (18,25). The strong correlation of WC with\nBMI (r = 0.88) suggests that WC alone is not only an indicator\nof abdominal adiposity but also overall obesity, whereas WHR\nand WTR correlate less strongly with BMI and therefore may\nprovide more unique information regarding regional fat distri-\nbution. In the current study, WTR in both sexes and WHR in\nwomenstronglypredictedmortalityamongmiddle-agedadults,\nfindings similar to data from several large cohorts, including the\nIowa Women's Health Study (8), the Nurses' Health Study (26),\nand the Shanghai Women's Health Study (14). The strength\nof these associations may be at least partly due to the finding\nthat waist and hip (and thigh) circumferences display inde-\npendent and opposite associations with cardiovascular disease\nrisk \nfactors and mortality, and related conditions, after mutual\nadjustment or correction for overall obesity (4,27\u00ad29). WC\nlargely represents variability in intraabdominal and subcutane-\nous fat, while variability in hip circumference represents dif-\nferences in subcutaneous fat, gluteal muscle, and pelvic width.\nThigh circumference reflects variability in subcutaneous fat\nand muscle, and bone width likely to a lesser extent than hip\ncircumference. The combination of waist with hip or thigh cir-\ncumference may provide unique prognostic information about\nthese two very different but important body sites.\nNormal Overweight Obese\nHazard ratio (95% CI)\nWHR tertile 1\nWHR tertile 2\nWHR tertile 3\nNormal Overweight Obese\nHazard ratio (95% CI)\nWTR tertile 1\nWTR tertile 2\nWTR tertile 3\na\nb\nFigure 1 Adjusted hazard ratio of total mortality according to BMI and\n(a) waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and (b) waist-to-thigh ratio (WTR) among\nAdjusted for sex in addition to the variables listed in the footnote\nwomen.

CI,\nconfidence interval.\narticles\n \nRatio measures of abdominal adiposity or body fat distri-\nbution have been criticized due to their somewhat complex\nbiologic interpretation, poorer test\u00adretest and intraobserver\nreliability than the measurement of WC alone, even though\nintra-class correlation coefficients for both measures have been\n0.97 (30), and the finding that successful weight loss inter-\nventions commonly reduce the numerator and denominator\nresulting in no observed change in the ratio (31). An increased\nWHR or WTR may reflect a relative abundance of visceral fat,\ndecreased peripheral fat or muscle, or both. Alternatively, a\nlow WHR or WTR may reflect a relative lack of visceral fat,\nincreased muscle or peripheral fat, or some combination.\nFurthermore, WC alone has been shown to be more highly cor-\nrelated with visceral fat than WHR and WTR (3,32). However,\nWC has not always been shown to be more strongly associ-\nor mortality (5,8,12,13) than WHR. Therefore, it is clear that\nWHR and WTR do not reflect variation in visceral fat accumu-\nlation only, but they provide an estimate of body shape or fat\ndistribution, which in the current study was strongly predic-\ntive of mortality in middle-aged adults.\nSimilar to previous studies (15,35), we found the relation\nbetween adiposity and mortality in older adults was differ-\nent than the relation observed in middle-aged adults, regard-\nless of the measure of adiposity. Although numerous studies\nhave examined the association of BMI with mortality, few\nhave included the very old or additional measures of body\ncomposition (7). In one of the largest studies conducted to\ndate comparing various measures of adiposity among non-\ninstitutionalized adults aged 75 years, Price et al. (7) found\nthat a higher BMI or WC was associated with a reduced\nrisk of all-cause mortality, while a higher WHR modestly\nincreased mortality. Additional studies support an inverse\nassociation of BMI with mortality among older adults (9,17).\nTaken together, these findings suggest that the long-term risk\nof increased mortality should be strongly considered when\nexamining the short-term benefits of adiposity reduction\namong older adults.\nTo limit the potential for confounding by existing or subclin-\nical disease, which is a particular concern in older adults due\nin part to higher levels of comorbidity, we adjusted for clini-\ncally manifest disease at baseline and excluded deaths within\nthe first 5 years of follow-up. Results were similar with and\nwithout the exclusion of these persons. Although this analytic\ntechnique may be effective if the underlying disease causes\nrapid weight loss leading to death, reverse causation may still\ninfluence risk of mortality if the course of disease is lengthy\n(e.g., chronic respiratory conditions). Regardless, in studies of\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients that measure\npulmonary function that is likely to be the strongest prognos-\ntic indicator of mortality in this patient population, a reduced\nBMI has remained an independent predictor of death, high-\nlighting the importance of body composition in respiratory\ndisease prognosis (36).\nThe divergent relation of adiposity with mortality between\nmiddle-aged and older adults may be due to several reasons.\nThe protective effects of obesity in older age may outweigh the\npotential negative effects. Heavier persons have lower rates of\nosteoporosis due likely to greater weight-bearing bone forma-\ntion (37). This may reduce the risk of falls and protect older\nadults from the acute trauma that can occur as a result of fall-\ning. In addition, obesity may provide energy reserves during\nperiods of stress, including illness or trauma (38,39). A selec-\ntive survival effect may also occur, whereby individuals who\nare more susceptible to the adverse health effects of obesity\ndue to environmental or genetic factors suffer from increased\nmortality during middle age, leaving a more resistant over-\nweight elderly population. In addition, the divergent relation\nmay be due in part to a ceiling effect. Absolute risk of mortality\nincreases with age and among adults aged 90 years or older, for\nexample, 12-year mortality will be nearly 100%, regardless of\nany risk factor level.\nThere were several strengths of the current study. The exter-\nnal validity is strengthened by the nationally representative\nsample of civilian noninstitutionalized US adults. In addition,\nanthropometric indices were measured by trained technicians\nusing a standardized protocol as opposed to the reliance on\nself-report. Furthermore, we controlled for numerous con-\nfounding and health factors that may distort the association\nbetween adiposity and mortality. However, there were limi-\ntations of the current study. We relied on simple estimates of\nanthropometry that are unable to distinguish fat from fat-free\nmass. However, these measurements are reliable, quick, and\ninexpensive to administer; making their applicability appeal-\ning in practice and large population-based epidemiologic stud-\nies. In addition, we had only a single baseline assessment of\nadiposity measurements and other exposures; therefore, we\ncould not examine whether changes occurred in these vari-\nables during follow-up or whether this may have influenced\nthe study findings.\nIn conclusion, we provided evidence on the relative impor-\ntance of well-defined measures of overall obesity and abdomi-\nnal adiposity or body fat distribution in assessing risk of total\nand cardiovascular disease mortality in a nationally repre-\nsentative sample of US adults. Despite their limitations, ratio\nmeasures of body fat distribution were strongly and positively\nassociated with risk of mortality in middle-aged adults. In\naddition, WHR and WTR increased prediction of mortality\namong normal weight and obese middle-aged adults. Among\nthe elderly, a higher BMI in both sexes and WC in men were\nassociated with a lower risk of mortality, while indicators of\nbody fat distribution increased survival or did not influence\nrisk of mortality. These results suggest that ratio measures of\nbody fat distribution carry important information for iden-\ntifying middle-aged adults at increased risk of mortality and\ntherefore should not be abandoned in research or practice. Our\nfindings also argue for age-specific clinical guidelines regard-\ning optimal body weight or body fat distribution.\n"
