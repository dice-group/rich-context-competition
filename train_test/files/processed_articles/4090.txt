    "reduced_content": "Commentary\nScaling down\nRonald L Breiger\n Keywords\nScaling up, scaling down, situated networks, cultural templates, scope conditions\nNetwork science research in the computational, social,\nand biological sciences is increasingly focused on data-\nsets of thousands and even millions of nodes and com-\nparably massive sets of connections among them--for\nexample, in gene interaction networks or social media\ndatasets. Well over a decade ago my colleagues and I,\nfalling in step with many other researchers, began\nasking, ``How well do the different analytical techniques\nand algorithms `scale up' to large networks . . . ?''\n(Breiger et al., 2003: 5). Traditional concepts of network\ncentrality, for example, and attendant shortest-path and\nbetweenness metrics, are often impractical to compute\nfor large-scale networks, even on very fast computers.\nMore fundamentally, the phenomenology of taking\naccount of all possible links, which is what these metrics\ndo, may well be appropriate for a small face-to-face\ngroup or for several dozen trading partners, but inappro-\npriate for the structuring and operation of networks at\nvery large scale. Much of the success of Big Data science\nhas consisted of formulating for large datasets algo-\nrithms that are more efficient and appropriate, and that\n``scale up'' only linearly with the number of nodes and\nWhile ``scaling up'' is a lively topic in network science\nand Big Data analysis today, my purpose in this essay is\nto articulate an alternative problem, that of ``scaling\ndown,'' which I believe will also require increased atten-\ntion in coming years. ``Scaling down'' is the problem of\nhow macro-level features of Big Data affect, shape, and\nevoke lower-level features and processes.\nA premise of a great deal of network science and\nBig-Data analysis of online behavior is that ``the web\nsees everything and forgets nothing'' (Golder and\nbehavior often make use of what is in this sense thought\nto be an unmediated study of social interactions, and it\nis not at all rare for authors of such studies to claim,\nfrom the analysis of millions of Facebook posts, find-\nings about human behavior that are said to be ``in con-\ntrast to prevailing assumptions'' in social science such\nas Festinger's (1954) social comparison theory formu-\nlated from research on small human groups (Kramer\nSchool of Sociology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA\nCorresponding author:\nRonald L Breiger, School of Sociology, University of Arizona, Tucson,\nEmail: breiger@email.arizona.edu\nBig Data & Society\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nbds.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons Non Commercial CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits any use, reproduction and distribution of the work\nwithout further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/\nnam/open-access-at-sage).\nAs I envision it, the alternative problem of ``scaling\ndown'' addresses four often-interrelated features of Big\nData and network science research that are routinely\nignored or accorded insufficient attention, to the detri-\nment of progress in research. First, whereas many stu-\ndies have been undertaken of massively large systems\nsuch as social networking sites, an under-researched\nquestion is the extent to which the behavioral findings\nof these studies ``scale down,'' i.e. apply to human\ngroups and organizations of moderate size (dozens or\nhundreds), where most human social life takes place\nand is likely to continue to do so. This is the question\nof the extent to which Big-Data research applies to\nhuman behavior at the human scale of church suppers\nand department politics in which we spend much of our\nlives. Second, what are the behavioral processes that\nlead to the macro-level outcomes? The research com-\nmunity has produced stunningly impressive and work-\nable mathematical models of how processes at lower\nlevels (among individuals, say) might cumulate to\nhigh-level complexity (e.g. Lusher et al., 2013;\nMorris, 2003), or how bags of words from multiple\ntopics might spill together to form texts (Blei, 2012).\nHowever, there has been precious little attention paid\nto formulating micro-processes that reflect actual\nbehavior. Big Data has no analog to behavioral eco-\nnomics, the study of when and why actors follow or\ndepart from the postulated model (Thaler, 1994).\nThird, network science and Big Data often see them-\nselves as scaling ``up'' to generalizations that are freed\nfrom the shackles of particular texts, and to findings\nthat apply universally to ``all'' networks whether power\ngrids, gene interactions, or Facebook friending. Scaling\n``down'' would recognize the possibility that, the bigger\nthe dataset in the case of a particular research question,\nthe greater are the opportunities to search for variation\nwithin the case, to contextualize its features in such a\nway as to lead to a distinctive form of case-based gen-\neralization (George and Bennett, 2005). Fourth,\n``scaling down'' refers to the problem of how a large\nsocial field, including its history and culture, shapes the\ntypical representations, interactions, and strategies at\nlocal levels in a text or social network.\nIn brief: (a) the degree of applicability of Big Data\nresearch to small- and moderate-sized social groups, (b)\nthe study of when actors behave as if the mathematical\nmechanisms postulated to generate Big Data were true,\n(c) the relative utility of binning Big Data into local con-\ntexts, and (d) the production of local action from macro-\nlevel processes are all problems in ``scaling down.'' I will\nsay a bit more in turn about each of the four aspects of\n``scaling down'' that I have identified.\na. Scope conditions. Festinger (1954), on social com-\nparison processes, pertains to ``peer groups'' or\n``primary groups'' of the order of 101 members.\nusers, by manipulating the emotional expressions in\nthe news feeds each user received.1 People who\nreceived positive emotion updates expressed positive\nemotion reactions, not the negative reactions pre-\ndicted by Festinger's social comparison theory or\nby Turkle's (2011) more contemporary consider-\nation of how technology affects social life. Kramer\net al.'s assertion that their finding is ``in contrast to\nprevailing assumptions'' of social science is but-\ntressed, in the authors' opinion, by the ability of\nBig Data to detect even such a small effect as the\nclear to this reader, however, why results on\nFacebook should be expected to scale down so as\nto apply in the same way to peer groups. We live on\nthe Internet, but we also and simultaneously live in\nvery small ``primary groups'' of the sort Festinger\nwas addressing. My own guess is that the difference\nis ``strong'' culture (which is pervasive in peer\ngroups) vs. the ``weak'' culture of online friending\n(Schultz and Breiger, 2010). I don't see why ``the\ntask of the researcher is to see online behavior as\nsocial behavior, the kind that might occur in any\nfield site, be it a remote village, a law office, or a\nhigh school cafeteria'' (Golder and Macy, 2014:\n113). To be sure, online behavior is a very distinctive\nand increasingly prominent form of social behavior,\nand tools for analyzing Big Data open up the study\nof online behavior in ways that are both innovative\nand exciting for sociology. Nonetheless, Festinger\nshowing that behavior in small face-to-face groups\nlike remote villages, (many) law offices, and school\ncafeterias differed along multiple dimensions from\nmore distanced forms of communication. Several\ncontemporary leaders in Big Data analysis have\ncoined the term ``Big Data hubris'' to refer to the\noften implicit assumption that Big Data is a substi-\ntute for, rather than a supplement to, traditional\ndata collection and analysis (Lazer et al., 2014).\nb. A behavioral model? Snijders et al. (2012) take note\nof the many ingenious mathematical models that\nhave been devised for Big Data analysis. Their\nmain point, however, is the suggestion that ``instead\nof trying to find micro-processes that lead to certain\naggregate network properties based on mathemat-\nical tractability, one could follow a different analyt-\nical strategy and try to come up with micro-\nprocesses that match with actual behavior. And\nthis is exactly where social and behavioral research\ncan play a role.'' Research of Yotam Shmargad\n(2014) moves decisively in this direction in order\nto model strength of ties and social media use.\n2 Big Data & Society\nShmargad analyzed the database of a social media\ncompany that started charging its users to receive\nbroadcasts in their email address books. Before the\nmonetization, users' address books were automat-\nically updated each time one of the people they were\nconnected to changed their contact information.\nAfterwards, users had to buy the company's pre-\nmium bundle for $60 to continue receiving the\nupdated information. In a study with the design\nof a natural experiment, Shmargad compared how\npurchase rates varied with properties of users' net-\nworks. Among the key findings: while people value\nreceiving information from their strong ties, they\nalso highly value receiving information from ties\nthat are structurally diverse, for example from ties\nthat connect the focal individual to regions of the\nsocial network with which she would otherwise not\nbe connected. This study therefore provides a useful\nexemplar of how a search for micro-processes that\nmatch users' behavior can lead to improved, rigor-\nous quantitative modeling of social media\nnetworks.\nc. Big Data, situated networks. McNely (2012) claims\n(in my paraphrase) that ``the paradox of Big Data''\nis that we now collect so much data that the chal-\nlenge is no longer only quantitative. The paradox\n``suggests the inverse: we need more situated, con-\ntextualized, qualitative studies of communication\npractices in an age of Big Data, not less'' (p. 28,\noriginal emphasis). In contrast to recent trends of\nscaling up communication infrastructures, McNely\nargues that the future of communication design\n``must address the challenges of scaling down, of\ndelivering Big Data in contextual, meaningful, loca-\nlized forms'' (p. 28, original emphasis). One pos-\nsible way to exploit this paradox is to consider\nBig Data corpuses, such as the set of published\nUS National Security Strategy statements analyzed\nby Mohr et al. (2013), as a single ``case'' or type of\ndiscourse that manifests internal variation. Using\nnatural language processing techniques, Mohr\nand relational trajectories of identified actors\n(``America,'' ``Yeltsin,'' ``Allies,'' ``Weapons of\nMass Destruction'') can be distilled from the\ncorpus. How these consequential trajectories\nchange over time is importantly related to a form\nof within-case generalization that is usually asso-\nciated with the situated study of qualitative data\nd. Fields, cultural templates, and automorphic equiva-\nlence. Not all networks emerge from processes on\nnodes and edges. This statement departs from the\nprogram of Big Data analysis, yet perhaps the rec-\nognition of this point could motivate progress in the\nanalysis of large-scale data. In many kinds of human\nnetworks, group style--defined as recurrent patterns\nof interaction that express a social group's shared\nideas about what constitutes good or adequate par-\nticipation in group settings--provides stylized tem-\nplates or ideals for interpersonal interaction\n(Eliasoph and Lichterman, 2003). In what sense\nare such cultural templates providing the impetus\nfor predictable interpersonal linkages at the micro-\nlevel (Pachucki and Breiger, 2010), and, in this way,\nscaling down? A somewhat similar question can be\nposed in molecular biology,3 where certain patterns,\ntermed network motifs, occur more frequently than\nby chance. Kashtan et al. (2004) define families of\nmotifs such that motifs within families share a\ncommon general theme defined by roles that the\nresearchers identify using automorphic equivalence\ntechniques developed in sociology for the study of\nsocial roles. Networks which share a common motif\ncan have very different generalizations of that motif.\nIn research that I see as related to the studies men-\ntioned above, Lazega et al. (2008) formulate a multi-\nlevel social network analysis via linked design: French\ncancer labs have ties (such as mobility of researchers\namong them), scientists have network ties (such as\nworking together), and scientists are affiliated with\nlabs. This formulation presents what I would like to\nidentify as ``a duality of scaling up and down'' with\nan emphasis on actors' strategies, inter-organizational\ncontrol mechanisms, and a distinctively institutional\ntheory of their coevolution that is being developed bril-\nliantly by Lazega and colleagues (especially, Lazega,\nIn conclusion, I have identified four interrelated fea-\ntures of ``scaling down,'' the problem of how macro-level\nfeatures of Big Data affect, shape, and evoke lower-level\nfeatures and processes. Too often, problems of scaling\ndown remain merely in the background of Big Data and\nnetwork science studies. Recognizing and addressing\nthem should lead to additional progress in advancing\nthe study of what Lazer et al. (2014) term an ``all data\nrevolution,'' wherein innovative analytics using data\nfrom all traditional and new sources are developed and\nused to further our understanding of our world.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1. The PNAS editors accompanied publication of Kramer\net al. (2014) with an ``editorial expression of concern''\ndue to the absence of an effort to obtain the informed\nconsent of the subjects. This issue was also highlighted in\n2. Distinctive features of within-case generalization include the\nsearch for specific pieces of information that decisively sup-\nport or undermine a given theory (``smoking gun'' tests),\nsearch for a given piece of evidence that must be present\nwithin an individual case for a hypothesis about that case\nto be valid, so that the absence of that information discon-\nfirms the hypothesis (``hoop tests''), consideration of how\nsmall changes during key historical junctures might have led\nthe case to follow a different path (``counterfactuals''), and\nother methods discussed in Goertz and Mahoney (2012).\n3.
