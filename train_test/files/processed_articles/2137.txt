Living with med-\nical comorbidity has thus become the norm for older adults,\nand the extent to which one can live well with multiple\nchronic conditions is a pressing challenge for an aging\nsociety. We address this challenge in several ways. First, we\nexamine the associations of medical comorbidity with mul-\ntiple domains of psychological functioning in a national\nsample of middle-aged and older adults, placing particular\nemphasis on positive functioning. Second, and most impor-\ntantly, we determine whether maintaining relatively high\nlevels of well-being in the face of medical comorbidity will\nafford biological advantages in the form of lower levels of\nsystemic inflammation. Finally, we sharpen the focus on\npositive functioning by assessing its independence from\nnegative affect and refine the analyses further by examining\nthe potential role of health behaviors as mediators of links\nbetween positive psychological functioning and inflamma-\ntion in the context of medical comorbidity.\nDeclines in health present a primary threat to subjective\nwell-being in later life. Although older adults tend to report\nhigher levels of subjective well-being (across multiple\ndomains of well-being) than younger adults (George, 2010),\nhealth problems are linked to significantly lower levels of\npositive affect and life satisfaction and higher levels of\ndepression and depressive symptoms in both cross-sectional\nand longitudinal analyses (Gerstorf et al., 2010; Kunzmann,\nWallhagen, & Cohen, 2002). Health-related declines in\nwell-being are particularly steep for those nearing the\nNevertheless, mean levels of subjective well-being remain\nrelatively high among adults with poor health. Indeed, many\nolder adults consider themselves to be aging successfully,\ndespite having multiple chronic conditions (Strawbridge et\nobservations suggest that high levels of subjective well-\nbeing may be present in contexts of medical comorbidities,\nwhich we investigate in the current study.\nWe bring two distinct domains of psychological\nwell-being --hedonic and eudaimonic (Ryan & Deci, 2001;\nWaterman, 1993)--to the inquiry. Hedonic well-being is as-\nsociated with pleasure, contentment, and the avoidance of\nphysical and psychic discomfort. It is typically assessed\nusing the frequency and intensity of positive and negative\nLiving Well With Medical Comorbidities: A\nBiopsychosocial Perspective\nElliot M. Friedman1,2 and Carol D.

We take a biopsychosocial perspective on age-related diseases by examining psychological correlates of\nhaving multiple chronic conditions and determining whether positive psychological functioning predicts advantageous\nprofiles of biological risk factors.\nMethod. Respondents to the national survey of Midlife in the United States who participated in clinical assessments\nof health and biological processes (n = 998) provided information on chronic medical conditions and multiple domains\nof psychological functioning. Serum concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were deter-\nmined from fasting blood samples.\nResults. Life satisfaction declined with increasing comorbidity while negative affect increased. In contrast, positive\naffect, purpose in life, and positive relations with others were unrelated to comorbidity status. Significant interactions\nshowed that although IL-6 and CRP increased with increasing number of chronic conditions, respondents with higher\nlevels of purpose in life, positive relations with others, and (in the case of CRP) positive affect had lower levels of inflam-\nmation compared with those with lower well-being scores.\nDiscussion. The results suggest that many older adults with medical comorbidities maintain high levels of positive\npsychological functioning that are in turn linked to better profiles of biological disease risk.\nKey Words: Chronic conditions--Inflammation--Successful aging--Well-being.\nmood and ratings of life satisfaction (Diener, 2000; Ryan &\nDeci, 2001). Studies of health-related changes in well-being\ntypically involve hedonic measures, such as life satisfaction\n(Mroczek & Spiro, 2005), positive and negative affect\n(Kunzmann et al., 2000), or a combination of these (Gerstorf\net al., 2010). In contrast, eudaimonic well-being stems from\nthe Aristotelian ideal of the pursuit of personal excellence\ntionalized with Ryff's Psychological Well-Being (PWB)\nscales (Ryff & Keyes, 1995). Here, we focus on two specific\ndimensions of psychological well-being--purpose in life\nand positive relations with others--that predicted inflam-\nmation in our earlier work (Friedman, Hayney, Love,\nSinger, & Ryff, 2007). Purpose in life has also been recently\nlinked to reduced mortality (Boyle, Barnes, Buchman, &\nBennett, 2009). To our knowledge, links between eudai-\nmonic well-being and medical comorbidity have not yet\nbeen studied.\nA central aim of this study was to determine whether\nhigher levels of positive psychological functioning in adults\nwith medical comorbidities will afford biological advan-\ntages in the form of lower circulating levels of inflammatory\nproteins. Some of the chronic conditions most common in\naging individuals--cardiovascular disease, hypertension,\nand diabetes--are associated with higher circulating levels\nof inflammatory proteins (Abraham et al., 2007; Blake &\nflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the acute-\nphase protein C-reactive protein (CRP). Importantly, IL-6\nand CRP have also been linked prospectively with adverse\nhealth outcomes, including mortality, in individuals with a\nrange of clinical diagnoses (Aggarwal & Gehlot, 2009;\nbetween inflammation and adverse health outcomes is\nparticularly strong in elderly adults (Stork et al., 2006)\nwho also likely suffer from multiple medical comorbidities.\nInflammation thus provides a useful index of risk for future\nmortality and morbidity among those with comorbid\nclinical illnesses, especially older adults.\nImportantly, inflammation is also associated with both\npositive and negative aspects of psychosocial functioning.\nA recent meta-analysis of 136 studies published between\nnantly IL-6 and CRP, are positively associated with depres-\nsion (Howren, Lamkin, & Suls, 2009). This association\nwas dose dependent and equally evident in clinical and\ncommunity-based samples (Howren et al., 2009). Positive\npsychosocial functioning, in contrast, has been linked to\nlower levels of inflammation. Circulating levels of IL-6\nwere lower in two independent samples of older women\nwho reported higher levels of psychological well-being\n(Friedman et al., 2007; Friedman, Love, Singer, & Ryff,\n2008), and greater positive affect predicted lower levels of\nIL-6 and CRP in female, but not in male, participants from the\nWhitehall II study (Steptoe, O'Donnell, Badrick, Kumari, &\nMarmot, 2008). The degree to which psychological func-\ntioning may moderate the link between chronic illness and\ninflammation is unknown, although the possibility is sup-\nported by earlier research showing that high-quality social\nrelationships predict lower levels of IL-6 in women with\nadvanced ovarian cancer (Costanzo et al., 2005). We test\nthis possibility in the present study.\nWe also examine whether any links between positive psy-\nchological functioning and inflammation in adults with\nmedical comorbidities are independent of negative affect.\nBroadly, well-being and ill-being are considered to be con-\nstructs that are related but distinct, and although the two are\ntypically inversely correlated, the correlation is rarely per-\nfect or even strong (Diener, 1984). Importantly, there is both\na theoretical foundation for and an empirical evidence of\nthe possibility of experiencing positive and negative emo-\ntions at the same time over the same event (Cacioppo &\nNorris, Gollan, Berntson, & Cacioppo, 2010), and neurosci-\nence research has shown that positive and negative emotions\ninvolve different regions of the brain (Cacioppo & Berntson,\n1999). Of particular relevance for this study are two recent\nliterature reviews showing that higher levels of well-being\npredict better health and reduced mortality, and studies that\nhave accounted for ill-being typically find residual associa-\ntions between well-being and multiple indices of health\nFinally, we assess the potential role of three health\nbehaviors--cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and\nphysical activity--in mediating links between positive\npsychological functioning and inflammation in the context\nof medical comorbidities. Smoking is linked to higher\ncirculating levels of inflammatory proteins (Helmersson,\nLarsson, Vessby, & Basu, 2005), whereas light alcohol\nintake (Volpato et al., 2004) and regular physical activity\n(Colbert et al., 2004) are associated with lower levels. Indi-\nviduals with higher levels of well-being are generally more\nlikely to engage in good health behaviors, and health behav-\niors are thought to contribute to the relationship between pos-\nitive psychological functioning and better health outcomes\n(Steptoe, Dockray, & Wardle, 2009). Using a well-established\napproach to meditational analyses (Baron & Kenny, 1986),\nwe examine the extent to which health behaviors explain\nthe association of positive psychological functioning and\ninflammation in adults with medical comorbidities.\nWe test the following hypotheses:\n\u00b7 Positive psychological functioning will decline and nega-\ntive functioning will increase with increasing number of\nchronic conditions, but consistent with research on older\nadult well-being (George, 2010), overall levels of subjec-\ntive well-being will remain relatively high.\n\u00b7 At similar levels of comorbidity, higher levels of subjec-\ntive well-being predict lower levels of IL-6 and CRP.\n\u00b7 The links between positive psychological functioning and\ninflammation, as well as the interactive association with\nchronic conditions, will be independent of negative affect.\n\u00b7 Health behaviors will mediate, at least in part, the associ-\nation of psychological functioning measures (and their\ninteractions with chronic conditions) and inflammation.\nMethod\nParticipants\nData for the current study are from the longitudinal sur-\nvey of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS), a national\nstudy of the physical and mental health of middle-aged and\nolder adults. MIDUS comprises a national probability\nsample of noninstitutionalized English-speaking adults (N =\n3,487) living in the coterminus United States and recruited\nby random digit dialing (RDD). A sample of monozygotic\nand dizygotic twin pairs (N = 1,914) was also recruited from\na national twin registry. The first wave of MIDUS data\nMortality-adjusted retention from the original study was\n71% for the RDD sample and 82% for the twins.All respon-\ndents completed telephone interviews and self-administered\nquestionnaires. Data collection for MIDUS 2 included an\noversampling of African Americans living in Milwaukee\nCounty, but given marked differences in sociodemographic\nand biological variables compared with the RDD and twin\nsamples, the Milwaukee oversample is excluded from these\nanalyses.\nA subsample of MIDUS 2 RDD and twin respondents\n(N = 1,028) participated in a detailed clinic-based assess-\nment of health, disease-related biomarkers, and physiologi-\ncal function (\"biomarker sample\"). Recruitment was by\nletter and a follow-up telephone call, and data collection\nmarker sample was open to all MIDUS 2 respondents who\nhad completed the telephone interview and self-administered\nquestionnaires and were willing to travel to a general\nclinical research center (GCRC) for an overnight stay.\nRecruitment was by letter and a follow-up telephone call.\nCompared with the full MIDUS 2 sample, participants in\nthe biomarker sample were more likely to have graduated\nfrom a 4-year college, were more likely to be Caucasian,\nand had higher scores on purpose in life, but were otherwise\nno different.Although the inclusion of respondents from the\ntwins sample has not influenced the results of previous\nanalyses involving MIDUS data (Friedman, Williams,\nSinger, & Ryff, 2009), we accounted for possible effects of\ngenetic and familial relatedness among the twins here by\nincluding a variable indicating twin status in all analyses.\nCRP values in excess of 10 mg/L are thought to indicate\nacute infectious illness, and exclusion of cases with high\nCRP values is recommended. We identified 30 cases with\nhigh CRP values, yielding a final analytical sample of 998\nrespondents.\nThree regional GCRCs participated in the MIDUS bio-\nmarker study--one on the West coast, one in the Midwest,\nand one on the East coast--and participants were invited to\nstay at whichever GCRC imposed the least travel burden.\nUpon arrival at the GCRC, each respondent provided a\ndetailed medical history interview with a GCRC clinician.\nParticipants were also asked to bring all current medications\nto the GCRC, and these were inventoried by the project\nstaff. Fasting blood samples were obtained the next morning\nsamples, aliquoted, frozen at -80 \u00b0C, shipped on dry ice to\nthe appropriate laboratory, and stored at -80 \u00b0C for analyses.\nThe time between completion of questionnaires and collec-\ntion of blood samples varied from simultaneously to several\nyears. To ensure that this variability did not confound the\nanalyses, a variable for time between data collection points\nwas included in all analyses.\nCollection of data for MIDUS 2 and analysis of those\ndata for the current study were both approved by the Health\nSciences Institutional Review Board at the University of\nWisconsin-Madison.\nMeasures\nChronic conditions.--Participants indicated whether they\nhad received a physician diagnosis for any of 12 chronic\nconditions. These included autoimmune disorders, cardio-\nvascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hypertension, arthri-\ntis, asthma, diabetes, gastrointestinal diseases, liver disease,\nand cancer. From these responses, an index of total chronic\ndisease conditions was constructed with possible responses\nInflammatory proteins.--Serum IL-6 from fasting blood\nsamples was measured using a high-sensitivity enzyme-\nlinked immunosorbent assay according to the manufactur-\ner's guidelines (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in the\nlaboratory of Dr. Christopher Coe at the University of\nWisconsin-Madison. CRP was measured using a particle-\nenhanced immunonephelometric assay (BNII nephelometer;\nDade Behring, Inc., Deerfield, IL) in the laboratory of\nDr. Russell Tracy at the University of Vermont. The labora-\ntory intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variance for\nboth proteins were in acceptable ranges (<10%). As is\ntypically seen, distributions for both IL-6 and CRP were\npositively skewed, and data were log transformed for statis-\ntical analyses. Due to cases where blood samples were\nmissing or had inadequate volume for assays, analyses for\nIL-6 involved 988 participants, whereas those for CRP\ninvolved 984 participants. Circulating levels of IL-6 typi-\ncally increase with age and range from less than 1 pg/ml in\nyoung adults to more than 2.5 pg/ml in older adults (Ferrucci\nEudaimonic well-being.--Assessments of purpose in life\nand positive relations with others were based on responses\nto 2 seven-item subscales from Ryff's PWB inventory (Ryff &\nKeyes, 1995). Examples of items from the purpose-in-life\nscale include \"I enjoy making plans for the future and working\nto make them a reality\" and \"I sometimes feel as if I've\ndone all there is to do in life\" (reverse scored). Examples of\nitems from the positive-relations-with-others scale include\n\"I know that I can trust my friends, and they know they can\ntrust me\" and \"Maintaining close relationships has been\ndifficult and frustrating for me\" (reverse scored). Internal\nvalidity alphas for purpose in life and positive relations with\nothers for the biomarker sample were .69 and .78, respec-\ntively. These are almost identical to the internal validity sta-\ntistics for the full MIDUS 2 sample (.70 and .78, respectively).\nHedonic well-being.--Positive and negative affect were\nmeasured using adjectives from the Positive and Negative\nAffect Scale (PANAS; Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998). For posi-\ntive affect, respondents were asked to indicate how often in\nthe past 30 days they felt \"enthusiastic,\" \"attentive,\"\n\"proud,\" or \"active\" and to respond using a 5-point scale\n(1 = all of the time; 5 = none of the time). Negative adjec-\ntives were \"afraid,\" \"jittery,\" \"irritable,\" \"ashamed,\" and\n\"upset.\" Internal validity (determined from the biomarker\nsample) was .85 for the positive adjectives and .80 for the\nnegative ones. These are comparable with internal validity\nassessments from the full MIDUS 2 sample (alphas = .90\nand .86 for positive and negative affect, respectively).\nLife satisfaction was assessed using a single item: \"At\npresent, how satisfied are you with your life?\" Responses\nranged from 1 = a lot to 4 = not at all.\nCovariates\nIn addition to age, sex, marital status, educational attain-\nment, and race, analyses controlled for the potential con-\nfounding influence of risk factors for poor health, most\nnotably obesity and use of medications that may affect the\ninflammatory proteins, and health behaviors.\nEducation.--Participants were asked about their highest\nlevel of educational attainment. Responses were grouped into\n12 categories ranging from \"no school/some grade school\" to\n\"PhD, MD, JD, or other professional degrees.\" Responses\nwere then grouped into three categories--high school degree\nor Graduate Equivalency Degree, some college, and college\ndegree or more--and this variable was used in all analyses.\nObesity.--Height and weight were measured by the\nGCRC staff and used to calculate body mass index (BMI;\nweight in kilograms divided by the square of height in\nmeters). A continuous measure of BMI was included in all\nanalyses. Waist and hip circumferences were measured\ndirectly on skin or over a single layer of clothing (e.g.,\ncamisole or undershirt) using a tape measure. A continuous\nmeasure of waist-to-hip ratio was used in all analyses.\nMedications.--Antihypertensive (Fliser, Buchholz, &\n(Jain & Ridker, 2005), and antidepressant (Kenis & Maes,\n2002) medications have all been shown to have anti-\ninflammatory properties, and steroid medications, particu-\nlarly as part of a hormone replacement regimen, have\nbeen shown to increase CRP levels (Silvestri et al., 2003).\nDichotomous variables indicating the use of any of these\nmedications were included in all analyses.\nHealth behavior.--Health behavior indicators are based\non self-reported information from questionnaires completed\nat the GCRC. Participants were asked about history of ciga-\nrette smoking, and the responses were coded as never\nsmoked, former smoker, or current smoker. Participants\nalso indicated the number of drinks consumed during an\naverage day, and the responses were categorized (none, 1\u00ad2,\n3 or more). Finally, respondents were asked whether they\nengage in regular exercise or physical activity for 20 min\nor more at least 3 times per week, and the responses were\ncategorized as yes or no.\nStatistical Analyses\nBivariate associations between key predictor and out-\ncome variables were initially assessed. Hierarchical multi-\nvariate linear regression models were then used to estimate\nthe independent and interactive associations of chronic\nconditions and well-being measures with inflammatory\nproteins--separate models were estimated for IL-6 and\nCRP. Initial models examined direct associations between\neach inflammatory protein and chronic conditions and\nwell-being, and the Well-being \u00d7 Chronic Conditions inter-\naction net of the effects of age, sex, race, educational attain-\nment, and marital status. To examine the independence of\nwell-being measures and negative affect, the models for\npositive affect, purpose in life, and positive relations with\nothers then added the variable for negative affect from\nthe PANAS (Model 2). Finally, to determine whether the\naspects of health behavior accounted for associations of\nhedonic or eudaimonic well-being measures and inflamma-\ntory markers, Model 3 added BMI, waist\u00adhip ratio, medica-\ntions, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and exercise.\nCollinearity diagnostics indicated that associations among\nthese measures were not sufficiently great to compromise\nthe models. The threshold for statistically significant associ-\nResults\nDescriptive statistics for all variables are shown in\nBivariate Associations\nTable 2 displays bivariate associations among the key\npredictor and outcomes variables as well as the covariates.\nsignificantly positively correlated with the number of\nchronic conditions. Number of chronic conditions was\nsignificantly positively correlated with negative affect (r =\n.07, p < .05) and negatively correlated with life satisfaction\n(r = -.08, p < .05) but not associated with other measures of\npsychological functioning. IL-6 was inversely associated\nwith purpose in life (r = -.07, p < .05), positive affect\nand CRP was negatively correlated with life satisfaction\n(r = -.07, p < .05) and positively correlated with positive\nrelations with others (r = .08, p < .05). Finally, measures of\nhedonic and eudaimonic well-being were all moderately\ncorrelated with one another.\nRegression Analyses\nInterleukin-6.--The results of the regression analyses for\nIL-6 are shown in Table 3.\nAfter adjustment for age, sex, race, educational attain-\nment, marital status, sample type (RDD vs. twin), and time\nelapsed between data collections (base model), chronic con-\nditions were positively associated with IL-6 ( = .21, p <\n.01), and this association remained significant albeit dimin-\nished after the addition of other covariates ( = .09, p < .05).\nPurpose in life was not associated with IL-6 in the base\nmodel or after adjustments for health and health behavior\ncovariates. In contrast, the interaction between chronic con-\nditions and purpose in life was significantly associated with\nIL-6 in the base model (Model 1:  = -.43, p < .05), and this\nassociation was maintained after controlling for negative\naffect (Model 2:  = -.43, p < .05) and other covariates\nPositive relations with others was marginally signifi-\ncantly associated with IL-6 in both the base model (Model\n1:  = .10, p = .05) and after adjustments for negative affect\n(Model 2:  = .10, p = .05), but this association was reduced\nto statistical nonsignificance after inclusion of health and\nhealth behavior covariates (Model 3:  = .08, p > .05). The\ninteraction of positive relations with others and chronic\nconditions was significant in the base model (Model 1:\n = -.37, p = .05), and after controlling for negative affect\n(Model 2:  = -.38, p < .05), but was reduced to marginal\nsignificance after adjustment for health and health behavior\nTable 1.

The interaction between positive affect and\nchronic conditions was not significantly associated with\nIL-6 in any of the models (see Table 3). Neither life satisfac-\ntion nor the interaction between life satisfaction and chronic\nconditions was significantly associated with IL-6 in any of\nthe models (see Table 3). Similarly, negative affect and the\ninteraction of negative affect and chronic conditions did not\nsignificantly predict IL-6 in any of the models (see Table 3).\nC-reactive protein.--The results of the regression\nanalyses for CRP are shown in Table 4.\nChronic conditions were significantly associated with\nCRP in the base model ( = .17, p < .001), but the associa-\ntion was reduced to marginal significance in the full model\nPurpose in life was significantly associated with CRP in\nthe base model (Model 1:  = .11, p < .05; Table 4), but this\nassociation became marginally significant after adjusting\nfor negative affect (Model 2:  = .09, p = .09). Interestingly,\npurpose in life predicted CRP in the full model (Model 3:\n = .10, p < .05), suggesting modest suppression effects\nassociated with the health and health behavior covariates. The\ninteraction between chronic conditions and purpose in life\nwas consistently significantly related to CRP in all the three\nmodels (see Table 4).\nPositive relations with others was significantly associated\nwith CRP in all models (see Table 4). The interaction of\npositive relations with others and chronic conditions was\nsignificant in the base model and after controlling for nega-\ntive affect but was reduced to marginal significance in the\nPositive affect was marginally associated with CRP in the\nbase model (Model 1:  = .09, p = .09), but this association\nwas reduced to nonsignificance after adjustment for nega-\ntive affect and other covariates (see Table 4). The interac-\ntion between positive affect and chronic conditions was\nsignificant in the base model ( = -.36, p < .05) and after\nadjustment for negative affect (Model 2:  = -.36, p < .05),\nbut nonsignificant after adjustment for health and health\nbehavior covariates ( = -.19, p > .05). Life satisfaction,\nnegative affect, and their respective interactions with\nchronic conditions were not significantly associated with\nCRP in any of the models (see Table 4).\nThe interactions of chronic conditions with measures of\nhedonic and eudaimonic well-being are shown in Figure 1.\nAnalytic Refinements\nWe probed the aforementioned results in three ways to\nclarify their interpretation. First, the significant bivariate\nassociation between purpose in life and positive relations\nwith others (r = .58, p < .01) raises the question of whether\nthe associations of each domain of eudaimonic well-being\nwith IL-6 and CRP were independent of each other. To\naddress this question, positive relations with others was\nincluded in the regression models relating purpose in life to\nboth IL-6 and CRP--and vice versa--and the results\nshowed that neither the associations with the well-being\nTable 3.

As noted previously, collin-\nearity diagnostics indicated that inclusion of both variables\nin the same model did not compromise the model.\nSecond, hedonic and eudaimonic aspects of well-being\nare considered as related but distinct constructs (Keyes,\nShmotkin, & Ryff, 2002). To determine whether these dif-\nferent aspects of well-being shared their associations with\ninflammatory proteins or were independent, we included\npositive affect in the regression models for purpose in life\nand positive relations with others. In every instance, inclu-\nsion of positive affect left the coefficients for eudaimonic\nwell-being measures virtually identical.\nFinally, IL-6 is a potent stimulator of the synthesis and\nrelease of CRP from the liver (Mortensen, 2001; Tennent\net al., 2007), and we recently reported that the association of\nincome and CRP was mediated by IL-6 (Friedman & Herd,\n2010). To examine a possible mediating role for IL-6 in\nthese analyses, IL-6 was added to the full CRP models.\nWith the exception of the interaction between chronic\nconditions and positive relations with others, which was\nreduced to marginal statistical significance (p = .08), associ-\nations were unchanged (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nThis study examined the psychological correlates of\nmultiple disease comorbidity in a national sample of middle-\naged and older adults in the United States. Consistent with\nprior literature on subjective well-being (Fortin, Dubois,\nthat life satisfaction declined with increasing number of\nchronic conditions while negative affect increased. These\nresults are also consistent with a broader literature focused\non changes in well-being related to advancing age. These\nstudies show that disease is a significant predictor of age-\nrelated declines in well-being (Mroczek & Spiro, 2005;\ncontrast, positive affect was not significantly related to\nnumber of chronic conditions, although the association was\nin the expected direction. This observation differs from ear-\nlier reports of declines in positive affect associated with\ngreater disease burden (Kunzmann et al., 2000). Finally,\nneither purpose in life nor positive relations with others was\nsignificantly associated with the number of chronic condi-\ntions. To the best of our knowledge, this is a novel finding,\nand it suggests that eudaimonic well-being, which reflects\nFigure 1. Scatter plots of statistically significant interactions (raw values).

It is worth\nnoting that the effect sizes for the interaction terms were\nsmall--the interaction of purpose in life and chronic condi-\ntions explained 1% of the variance in IL-6 and 2% of the\nvariance in CRP (effect sizes were smaller for positive rela-\ntions with others and positive affect)--but with one\nexception: the increments in the variance explained were\nstatistically significant. By comparison, even chronic condi-\ntions explained only 4% of the variance in IL-6 and 2% of\nthe variance in CRP, a reflection of the fact that inflamma-\ntion is determined by myriad factors, any one of which is\nlikely to have a relatively small effect.\nDespite declines in some aspects of subjective well-being\nwith increasing number of chronic conditions, mean levels\nof hedonic and eudaimonic well-being were high. This\nresult is consistent with research suggesting that aging\nadults become particularly adept at using cognitive and\nbehavioral strategies to manage positive psychological\nfunctioning (Scheibe & Carstensen, 2010). Indeed, scores\non some measures of subjective well-being--positive rela-\ntions with others, positive affect, and life satisfaction--were\npositively associated with age, whereas depressive symptom\nscores were associated negatively; scores on the purpose-in-\nlife scale were quadratically associated with age, rising into\nlater life before falling among the oldest participants (those\nin their late 70s and early 80s). The present results thus sug-\ngest that although physical health is an important determi-\nnant of some aspects of well-being in later life (Kunzmann\n2002), multiple medical comorbidities are not obstacles to\npositive psychological functioning.\nThe final aim of this study was to determine whether\nthese high levels of subjective well-being would be associ-\nated with favorable profiles of disease risk in the form\nof lower circulating levels of inflammatory proteins. The\nresults showed that at similar numbers of chronic condi-\ntions, those with higher levels of positive affect, purpose in\nlife, and positive relations with others had lower levels of\ninflammation. These associations were largely preserved\nafter adjustments for multiple potential confounds. Further\nanalytic refinements suggested that hedonic and eudaimonic\nwell-being make unique contributions to lower levels of\ninflammation in older adults with multiple chronic conditions.\nThe findings extend our earlier research showing that\nhigher ratings of purpose in life and positive relations with\nothers predicted lower levels of inflammatory proteins in a\ncommunity sample of older women (Friedman et al., 2007)\nand that multiple aspects of well-being moderate the asso-\nciation of educational attainment and IL-6 (Morozink,\nFriedman, Ryff, & Coe, 2010). Here, we document that\naspects of well-being also moderate the linkage between\nlater-life chronic conditions and inflammatory markers.\nCollectively, such findings underscore the role of positive\npsychological functioning in offsetting the extent to which\nvarious life challenges (social inequalities, unfolding health\nproblems) contribute to biological processes (inflammation)\nimplicated in future profiles of morbidity and mortality.\nThat is, higher levels of inflammation are linked to adverse\nhealth outcomes in a range of age-related chronic disease\nconditions. CRP in particular has been positively linked\nto poorer prognosis in adults with cardiovascular disease\n(Blake & Ridker, 2003) and some forms of cancer (Aggarwal\n& Gehlot, 2009). Other studies have shown that higher\nlevels of inflammation predict increased risk for morbidity\nand mortality in healthy individuals, particularly in elderly\nmoderate levels of inflammation in aging individuals thus\nemerge as important influences on health and longevity.\nHigher levels of purpose in life (Boyle et al., 2009) and pos-\nitive affect (Chida & Steptoe, 2008; Pressman & Cohen,\nand reduced mortality across the life span, but the mecha-\nnisms underlying such associations are unclear. The current\nresults suggest that reduced inflammation may contribute to\nthese general associations between well-being and health.\nOur results contribute to the broader discussion of what\nconstitutes successful aging. One of the most influential\ndefinitions of successful aging (Rowe & Kahn, 1998) con-\nsists of three elements: absence of physical illness or dis-\nability, high levels of cognitive function and physical\nfunctioning, and active engagement with life. However,\nonly a small percentage of aging individuals in the United\nStates would be considered successful agers by these crite-\nria (McLaughlin, Connell, Heeringa, Li, & Roberts, 2010;\nStrawbridge et al., 2002), in part because having multiple\nmedical conditions is increasingly the norm for older adults\n(Anderson, 2007). Moreover, many older adults who do not\nmeet Rowe and Kahn standards consider themselves to be\naging successfully. We believe that a compelling alternative\nformulation of successful aging is the ability to remain\nactively engaged even in the face of age-related disease\n(Young, Frick, & Phelan, 2009).As the current results show,\neven high levels of medical comorbidities do not preclude\nhigh levels of subjective well-being. More importantly,\nmaintaining high levels of well-being into later life, partic-\nularly a sense of life purpose and strong social relationships,\npredicts lower levels of inflammatory proteins that them-\nselves predict better health outcomes in the context of\nchronic illness.\nInterpretation of these results should be tempered by\nseveral limitations of the study, the most important being\nthat the analyses were cross-sectional, and thus, causal rela-\ntionships among the variables of interest are unclear. For\nexample, the ability of inflammatory proteins such as IL-6\nto influence mood, particularly depression, is well docu-\nmented (Raison, Capuron, & Miller, 2006). The results are\nalso limited to a single measurement of inflammatory\nproteins, which, given variability in their levels within\nindividuals, might produce inaccurate estimates of each\nperson's circulating levels. Nevertheless, such variability\nwould be expected to reduce the likelihood of detecting\nassociations, meaning that the strength of the relationships\nobserved may be underestimated. Finally, given the small\neffect sizes, it is important not to overstate the significance\nof these results. The effect sizes for the interactions of\nchronic conditions and well-being measures were, however,\ncomparable with those for chronic conditions and inflam-\nmation alone, suggesting that this interaction is not a trivial\none.\nIn sum, these results add to a growing literature on the\npotential salutary effects of positive psychological func-\ntioning, and they suggest that among those most at risk for\nage-related morbidity and mortality, experiences of positive\naffect, purposeful life engagement, and robust social ties\nmay contribute to better health outcomes.\nFunding\nNational Institute on Aging (NIA), and the longitudinal follow-up of the\nthe NIA.
