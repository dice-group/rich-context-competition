Furthermore, children\nwho are less anxious preoperatively are\noften observed showing more ED (and,\nindeed, vice versa) during recovery\nfrom general anaesthesia. Considering\nthat invasiveness may affect the occurrence\nof ED, this would suggest that\nbinocularity and the number of muscles\ninvolved in strabismus surgery might influ-\nence ED.\nThe present prospective observational\nstudy was designed to investigate the correl-\nation between preoperative anxiety and ED.\nThe degree and incidence of ED were\nassessed and calculated using the Pediatric\nAnesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED)\nscore (Table 1)10 and a four-point delirium\nscale. On the ED scale, the scores were: 1,\ncalm; 2, not calm, but could be easily\ncalmed; 3, not easily calmed (moderately\nagitated or restless); 4, combative, excited\nor disoriented; scores of 1 and 2 were\nconsidered nonproblematic behaviour, and\nscores of 3 and 4 were considered delirium.2\nThis score was also used to calculate the\nincidence of ED. The study involved pre-\nschool-age paediatric patients undergoing\nstrabismus surgery with a standardized\nanaesthetic protocol using sevoflurane.\nSecondary objectives of the study were to\nidentify other factors associated with ED,\nsuch as age and sex, and to assess the\nduration and invasiveness of the surgical\nprocedure.\nTable 1.

Scores for\neach item are summed to obtain the total PAED scale\nscore. Degree of emergence delirium increases directly\nwith total score.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThis prospective observational study\nenrolled consecutive American Society of\nAnesthesiologists physical status 1 and 2\nSouth Korean children, aged 2\u00ad5 years,\nscheduled for strabismus surgery in the\nDepartment of Anaesthesiology and Pain\nMedicine, Seoul St Mary's Hospital, College\nof Medicine, The Catholic University of\nKorea, Seoul, Republic of Korea, between\npatients were allowed to take solid food up\nto 6 h before surgery and water up to 2 h\nbefore surgery. Children with pre-existing\nneurological disorders and those whose\nparents refused to enrol them were excluded.\nThis study was approved by the Ethical\nCommittee of Seoul St Mary's Hospital,\nCatholic University of Korea (ID: KIRB-\nWritten informed consent was obtained\nfrom the parents of each patient.\nStudy protocol\nThe patients visited a day surgery centre\n(DSC) at Seoul St Mary's Hospital on the\noperation day, with their parents. One desig-\nnated DSC nurse who was trained in the use\nof the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety\nScale(m-YPAS)22 administered the m-YPAS\nupon the child's admission to the DSC. The\nresulting m-YPAS scores were not provided\nto other researchers or to medical personnel\nuntil data analysis. Next, intravenous (i.v.)\naccess was established with a 22-gauge angio\ncatheter. Approximately 10 min prior to\nentering the operating room, 0.1 mg/kg\nmidazolam i.v.23 was administered as a pre-\nmedication, and the patient was transferred\nto the operating room, by medical personnel,\non becoming drowsy.\nElectrocardiogram, noninvasive blood\npressure, heart rate, and pulse oximetry\nwere measured using standard techniques\ncontinuously at 5-min intervals, starting\nfrom the patient's arrival in the operating\nroom. General anaesthesia was induced with\n2 mg/kg propofol i.v. bolus and 0.6 mg/kg\nrocuronium i.v. bolus. After tracheal intub-\nation, anaesthesia was maintained with\n, keeping the end-tidal CO2\nand 35 mmHg. Strabismus surgeries were\nperformed by one surgeon . In patients who\nhad strabismus surgery in one eye, the\ntreated eye was protected with gauze and a\ntransparent eye shield after applying eye\nointment . In patients who had strabismus\nsurgery in both eyes, after eye ointment was\napplied to both eyes, the eye that had a\ngreater reaction to exudate was protected\nwith gauze and a transparent eye shield; the\nother eye was protected only with a trans-\nparent eye shield.\nAt the end of surgery, sevoflurane was\ndiscontinued; 75 mg/kg ondansetron i.v.,\n0.9 mg/kg ketorolac i.v., 0.2 mg/kg pyrido-\nstigmine i.v. and 0.08 mg/kg glycopyrrolate\ni.v. were administered. After extubation,\neach patient was brought to the postanaes-\nthetic care unit (PACU).\nOn arrival in the PACU, one of the\nparents or caregivers was called to be with\nthe child. A designated PACU nurse was\ntrained in the administration of the PAED\nscale before beginning this study. This\ntrained nurse administered the PAED\nscale10 at 5-min intervals, from arrival in\nthe PACU until discharge to the DSC, to\nevaluate the degree of ED. The highest\nPAED score, indicating most symptoms of\nED, was deemed the final score for each\npatient. The nurse also graded clinically\nobserved delirium at 5-min intervals on the\nfour-point delirium scale also designed to\nmeasure ED, described above.2\nIf the `face, legs, activity, crying, consol-\nability' scale score was >3 for >5 min , the\nPACU nurse notified the anaesthesiologist\nand then administered 1 mg/kg fentanyl i.v..\nWhen patients showed signs of retching or\nvomiting, 0.15 mg/kg metoclopramide i.v.\nwas administered as a rescue antiemetic.\n0.1 mg/kg midazolam i.v. was administered\nwhen scores on the four-point ED scale were\nThe following were also recorded: dur-\nation of surgery; duration of anaesthesia\n(from induction to extubation); time to\nawakening (time from arrival at the PACU\nto the first response to a verbal command);\nduration of stay in the PACU (from admis-\nsion to the PACU following surgery to the\ntime of discharge to the DSC); fentanyl\nadministration; duration of DSC stay (from\nthe time of postoperative DSC admission to\nthe time of discharge from the DSC).\nAfter study completion, the correlation\nbetween m-YPAS and PAED scores was\nexamined. Patients were classified into a\nhigh-anxiety group if their m-YPAS scores\nwere >40, and a low-anxiety group if their\nthe high- and low-anxiety groups was\ncompared.\nPatients and their data were also assigned\nto the following groups according to the\ninvasiveness of the surgery: group U-S,\nsingle-muscle correction in a unilateral eye;\ngroup U-M, multiple-muscle correction in a\nunilateral eye; group B-S, single-muscle\ncorrection in bilateral eyes; and group\nB-M, multiple-muscle correction in bilateral\neyes. Then, the maximum PAED score and\nincidence of ED in each group were\ncompared.\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nthe SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version 18.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. To estimate the sample size\nneeded, a two-sided test with a significance\ndetect a correlation of 0.30 between\nm-YPAS and PAED. Thus, the study\nrequired a minimum of 84 patients. To\nallow for the exclusion of some patients,\nthe study enrolled 90 paediatric patients.\nBivariate correlation analysis between\nm-YPAS, age, sex, invasiveness of surgery,\nduration of surgery and anaesthesia, and\nmaximum PAED score was performed using\nSpearman's rank correlation coefficient.\nThen, stepwise multiple regression analysis\nwas conducted for those factors that were\nshown to correlate with maximum PAED\nscore.

The incidence of rescue\nfentanyl administration was similar among\nthe four groups; the association between\nincidence of rescue fentanyl administration\nand the presence of ED, within each group,\nwas not significant. Other recovery charac-\nteristics, such as time taken to awaken, and\nduration of stay in the PACU and DSC, did\nnot differ significantly among the four\ngroups.\nAge, duration of surgery, duration of\nanaesthesia and invasiveness of surgery were\nsignificantly correlated with maximum\nPAED score (P < 0.05 for all comparisons;\nTable 5). However, multiple regression ana-\nlysis showed that invasiveness of surgery\nwas the only factor that significantly influ-\nenced maximum PAED score (multiple\nDiscussion\nVarious studies have established the rela-\ntionship between preoperative anxiety and\nemergence delirium in paediatric\nhave stated that preoperative anxiety is\nassociated with postoperative delirium, sev-\neral reports failed to find such a relationship.\nFor example, Faulk et al.26 reported that\npreoperative anxiety as assessed by the\nm-YPAS had no significant effect on the\nPAED score in children aged between 1 and\n12 years, undergoing outpatient dental pro-\ncedures. Przybylo et al.9 also failed to dem-\nonstrate a relationship between\npreanaesthetic psychosocial factors and\npostanaesthetic behavioural abnormalities\nin children aged between 2 and 9 years,\nscheduled for strabismus surgery. However,\nthe small size of the study population (27\npatients) and the fact that the study included\nschool-age children limited the scope of their\nconclusions. Unlike school-age children,\npreschool children are psychologically\nimmature2 and are easily confused and\nfrightened by unexpected and unpredictable\nexperiences.11 Therefore, both studies may\nhave resulted in spurious relationships being\nreported between preoperative anxiety and\nED, as opposed to other studies that\nincluded predominantly school-age children\n(who have a better understanding of the\nsituation that they are facing and are more\nreadily controllable). In contrast, the present\nstudy focused only on preschool children,\naged 2\u00ad5 years, who are known to be a high-\nrisk group for ED.\nThe m-YPAS is reported to be an appro-\npriate tool for assessing children's anxiety\nduring the preoperative period.22 The\nPAED score allows for a more complex\nevaluation of ED, based on actual psychi-\natric definitions of delirium, and has the\nhighest reliability and validity in examining\nED in paediatric patients.10 The maximum\nPAED score was not correlated with\nm-YPAS scores in this present study.\nTable 5.

The\npresent study employed two methods to\nevaluate ED: PAED scores that equated to\nthe degree of ED; and a four-point delirium\nscale that related to the presence, and\ndegree, of ED.2 The present results indicate\nthat preoperative anxiety and ED were not\ncorrelated in preschool-age paediatric\npatients receiving strabismus surgery.\nWhat, therefore, explains the present\nresults, especially as they pertain to strabis-\nmus surgery? First, it has been suggested\nthat visual disturbances may be involved in\nED to a greater extent than preoperative\nanxiety.7 Secondly, the discomfort asso-\nciated with wearing the eye shield and\ngauze patch following application of eye\nointment may have played an important\nrole. Finally, administration of midazolam\nas a premedication may have also influenced\nthe discordance between preoperative anx-\niety and ED,26 despite the controversies\nAlthough the PAED scale is the most\ncomprehensive and well-validated scale used\nto measure the degree of ED, the appropri-\nate cut-off value to denote the presence of\nED is still subject to conjecture. In the\noriginal study describing the PAED scale,\nthe authors reported that a PAED score of\n!10 was associated with the greatest degree\nED.10 Several other studies also performed\nROC curve analysis and reported identical\nresults to those of the original study.12,29\nConversely, in other research, a PAED score\nof !16 was deemed to be an appropriate cut-\noff value for ED because the PACU nurses\nand evaluators did not believe that all\npatients with a PAED score of !10 dis-\nplayed problematic emergence behav-\ncurve analysis was undertaken and demon-\nstrated that a PAED score of >16 was\nassociated with the greatest degree of sensi-\nand is therefore the most appropriate cut-off\nscore. This higher cut-off score that we\nobserved (compared with other studies)\nmight be due to visual disturbances resulting\nfrom the wearing of the eye patch, such that\neye contact (a scoring criterion in the PAED\nscale), between the child and the PACU\nnurse, might be difficult. In addition, differ-\nences in anaesthetic management, surgical\nprocedures and the age range of the study\ngroups might have influenced this result.\nPatients who underwent strabismus sur-\ngery in both eyes showed higher maximum\nPAED scores than did those who received\nstrabismus surgery in one eye, which is con-\nsistent with other research.12 Furthermore,\nin the present study, the incidence of ED was\neven increased in those patients receiving\nbilateral surgery. In bilateral strabismus\nsurgery, patients who received multiple-\nmuscle corrections showed higher maximum\nPAED scores, and incidence of ED, than did\nthose who received single-muscle correction.\nDespite the fact that the duration of surgery\nand anaesthesia were significantly different\nbetween groups, it appears unlikely that this\nwould influence ED, considering that the\ninvasiveness of surgery itself was the only\nfactor affecting the occurrence of ED (as\ndemonstrated by the stepwise multiple\nregression analysis). Moreover, this group\ndifference in ED implies that covering the\neyes in different ways had a minimal impact.\nAnother study found that the level of\ninvasiveness of dental surgery was related\nto ED.20 Therefore, it seems that binocular-\nity, in combination with the number\nof muscles involved in surgery,\nincreases the invasiveness of surgery, result-\ning in an increased incidence and severity\nof ED.\nPain is considered to be one of the\nconfounding factors in the majority of\nstudies on ED, but it is difficult to fully dis-\ncriminate pain-related behavioural agitation\nfrom ED in preschool-age children.8 In an\nattempt to eliminate postoperative pain,\n0.9 mg ketorolac i.v. was administered to\neach patient after surgery, because ketorolac\ngiven at 0.5\u00ad0.9 mg/kg has been shown to be\neffective in preventing postoperative pain\nfollowing strabismus surgery.30,31 However,\nin this present study the paediatric patients\nwho were obviously in pain did not exhibit\nED, although it was difficult to exclude the\npresence of pain in patients with ED. In our\nstudy, postoperative pain was managed\nusing fentanyl and there were no significant\ndifferences in fentanyl administration\nbetween the four groups, or according to\nthe presence of ED within each group.\nTherefore, postoperative pain was unlikely\nto have influenced the PAED scores, but one\ncannot exclude pain as a possible\nconfounder.\nThis present study also administered\nmidazolam to every patient, because parents\nwere not permitted to enter the operating\nroom, in contrast to previous studies.19,20\nPremedication with midazolam has contro-\nanxiety of patients was assessed prior to\nmidazolam premedication, which might\nhave affected the relationship between pre-\noperative anxiety and ED. However, the fact\nthat midazolam was universally adminis-\ntered, and the large size of the study popu-\nlation, is likely to have reduced the\nlikelihood of this being the case.\nThere were two main limitations in this\npresent study. First, the PAED scores, and\nscores pertaining to the incidence and degree\nof ED, were measured by a single individual\nworking in the PACU. As such, the possi-\nbility exists that subjective judgements may\nhave acted as a bias. Secondly, patients were\nnot distributed equally among the four\nsurgical groups; because the primary pur-\npose was to investigate the correlation\nbetween preoperative anxiety and ED,\npatients were not enrolled according to the\ntype of surgery to which they were subjected.\nIn conclusion, preoperative anxiety was\nnot related to ED in preschool-age paediat-\nric patients undergoing strabismus surgery.\nA higher incidence and degree of ED\noccurred in patients receiving bilateral\nstrabismus surgery. In turn, a higher\nincidence and degree of ED occurred in\nbilateral strabismus surgery patients receiv-\ning multiple-muscle corrections, compared\nwith those who received a single-muscle\ncorrection. Therefore, concerted efforts\ntoward prevention and management of ED\nshould be made for preschool-age paediatric\npatients who are subjected to more complex\ntypes of strabismus surgery.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
