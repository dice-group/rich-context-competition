Consequently, patients are turning to older living donors. It\nis unclear if an upper age limit for donation should exist, both in terms of recipient and donor outcomes.\nDesign, setting, participants, & measurements In the United States, 219 healthy adults aged 70 have do-\nnated kidneys at 80 of 279 transplant centers. Competing risks models with matched controls were used to\nstudy the independent association between older donor age and allograft survival, accounting for the com-\npeting risk of recipient mortality as well as other transplant factors.\nResults Among recipients of older live donor allografts, graft loss was significantly higher than matched\nP  0.005) but similar to matched nonextended criteria 50-to 59-year-old deceased donor allografts (SHR\nhealthy matched controls drawn from the NHANES-III cohort; in fact, mortality was lower, probably re-\nflecting higher selectivity among older live donors than could be captured in National Health and Nutrition\nConclusions These findings support living donation among older adults but highlight the advantages of\nfinding a younger donor, particularly for younger recipients.\nIntroduction\nMore than 80,000 patients currently await deceased-\ndonor kidney transplantation in the United States,\nmany of whom will die before a suitable organ be-\ncomes available (1,2). Patients with a willing, healthy\nlive donor can be spared the morbidity and mortality of\nthe waiting list. Efforts to expand live donor kidney\ntransplantation have included incompatible kidney\ntransplantation (3), kidney-paired donation (4,5), nondi-\nrected donation (6), and the use of organs from live\ndonors who may have previously been excluded be-\ncause of hypertension, older age, or high body mass\nindex (BMI) (7). Specifically, some centers are increas-\ningly willing to transplant kidneys from live donors\nTwo recent studies showed that living donors on\naverage have comparable survival to matched healthy\ncontrols (8,9). However, no study has specifically\nevaluated postdonation survival among LD70s, who\ncomprise such a small proportion of the living donor\npool that any outcomes related to this subgroup\nwould be lost in analyses of \"average\" outcomes.\nFurthermore, some studies have suggested an in-\ncreased rate of chronic dysfunction in allografts from\nolder donors (10), whereas others suggest that older\nlive donor grafts perform as well as younger ones\n(11\u00ad13). Prior studies have been limited in two impor-\ntant ways. First, prior studies have defined \"older\ndonors\" as those over 60, thereby diluting any contri-\nbution from those aged 70; also, existing studies\ncompare those over 60 to the entire population of\ndonors under 60, effectively creating too wide an age\nrange of controls (ages 18 to 60) to generate meaning-\nful inferences. Third, the most intuitive question con-\ncerning LD70s is that of late allograft loss: will the\nviable, nonsclerotic nephron mass of a kidney from a\n70-year-old last as long as that from a 50-year-old?\nPrior studies have analyzed either all-cause graft loss\n(considering death as a graft-loss event) or death-\ncensored graft loss; both are inappropriate, because\nestablishing an independent association between do-\nnor age and recipient outcomes is either impossible\n(because of inclusion of death when analyzing all-\ncause graft loss) or misleading (because of informa-\ntive censoring when analyzing death-censored graft\nloss).\nThe goals of this study were as follows: to describe\na national cohort of live donors aged 70 to compare\n*Department of\nSurgery, Johns Hopkins\nUniversity School of\nMedicine, Baltimore,\nMaryland; Department\nof Epidemiology, Johns\nHopkins University\nSchool of Public\nHealth, Baltimore,\nMaryland; and School\nof Medicine, Stony\nBrook State University\nof New York, Stony\nBrook, New York\nCorrespondence: Dr.\nDorry Segev, Transplant\nSurgery, Johns Hopkins\nMedical Institutions,\ndorry@jhmi.edu\nArticle\ngraft and patient survival of the recipients of these kidneys\nwith those of kidneys from younger donors using compet-\ning risks models and matched controls, and to compare\ndonor survival with matched controls from the general\npopulation.\nMaterials and Methods\nThis study used data from the Scientific Registry of\nTransplant Recipients (SRTR). The SRTR data system in-\ncludes data on all donor, wait-listed candidates, and trans-\nplant recipients in the United States, submitted by the\nmembers of the Oran Procurement and Transplantation\nNetwork (OPTN), and has been described elsewhere. The\nHealth Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), US\nDepartment of Health and Human Services provides over-\nsight to the activities of the OPTN and SRTR contractors. It\nwas approved by the Institutional Review Board at the\nJohns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\nStudy Population: Live Donors\nA total of 97,782 live donors were identified between\nafter concluding that there were likely data errors, because\nmultiple donor and recipient demographic fields were\nidentical in both entries. Postdonation death in the donor,\nas well as posttransplant death in the recipient, was re-\nported by the transplant centers and augmented by linkage\nto the Social Security Death Master File.\nStudy Population: Matched Controls for Recipients\nIn an attempt to identify an appropriate control group\nfor recipients of kidneys from living donors aged 70,\nto 59 (LD50s) during the study period were selected. From\nthis group, three matched recipients were identified for\neach recipient from a live donor aged 70, based on recip-\nient characteristics: history of hypertension, age, ethnicity,\nyears of dialysis, insurance status (public versus private),\npeak Panel Reactive Antibody (PRA), and year of trans-\nplantation. Matched controls were drawn from this age\ngroup (ages 50 to 59) because living donation is more\ncommon in the age group, but it represents a significant\ndifference in age, which is our covariate of interest. Simi-\nlarly, three matched controls were identified from among\nto 59 who did not meet extended criteria donor (ECD)\ncriteria in the same time period. Subjects for whom ade-\nquate matches could not be found (n  16 for live donors\nwere dropped from analysis.\nStudy Population: Matched Controls for Donors\nMatched controls were identified from participants in\nthe third National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nNHANES-III participants underwent extensive medical\nevaluation, including medical history, physical examina-\ntion, laboratory studies, and other medical workup. This\ngroup represents an appropriate control when assessing\nthe primary outcome of death because (1) it is a nationally\nrepresentative study including largely healthy individuals;\n(2) the granularity of medical data available from this\nstudy facilitates matching based on known variables that\nmay be associated with the outcome of interest; and (3) it\nenrolled a substantial number of participants of similar age\nto our study group (8,14). Death in this cohort was deter-\nmined in a similar manner to that of the study population.\nOf NHANES-III participants, 9364 without contraindica-\ntions to live kidney donation were identified. The closest\nmatched control for each live kidney donor was selected\nfrom this population based on the following donor char-\nacteristics, where available: age, BMI, systolic BP, educa-\ntion level, ethnicity, and smoking history, using a process\nof iterative expanding radius matching as described pre-\nviously; availability and missingness of OPTN donor data\nover time was carefully delineated in the cited study (8).\nStatistical Analyses: Recipient Outcomes\nNonparametric competing risks models as described by\nCoviello and Boggs were used to estimate the cumulative\nincidence functions (CIFs) for the outcome of graft failure\n(15). This approach was chosen to simultaneously model\nthe risk of two outcomes, each of which precludes the\nassessment of the other (in this case, graft failure before\ndeath and death with a functioning graft), and to avoid the\nassumption of independent risks (noninformative censor-\ning) made in Kaplan-Meier models (15,16). The cumulative\nincidence estimate (I\n^\nk\n) of graft failure was calculated using\nthe following equation:\n^\nIk\n(t) \n\njPtjt\n^\n)\ndkj\nnj\nwhere ^\n) is the overall Kaplan-Meier estimate (sur-\nvival with a functioning graft) and dkj\n/nj\nestimates the\nhazard of graft failure (the number of events happening at\na given time tj\ndivided by the number of individuals at risk\nbefore time tj\n(15). Pepe and Mori tests were performed to\nestablish the statistical significance of any differences in\nCIF between groups (16).\nTo quantify the magnitude of the change in hazard in the\ncontext of a competing risk model, the semiparametric\nmethod of Fine and Gray was utilized to model the hazard\nfor the competing event of interest (in this case, graft loss)\n(17). This method facilitates the modeling of individual\nhazards in the subdistribution for the failure of interest (in\nthis case, the subhazard of developing graft failure before\ndeath) and permits the calculation of a subhazard ratio\n(SHR) while statistically adjusting for known confounders.\nA visual assessment of the proportionality of subhazards\nwas checked graphically.\nIn the case of mortality, the competing risk model pre-\nsented above would generate a CIF for death in competi-\ntion with graft loss and only models death in those recip-\nients who have not sustained graft loss. Of course, graft\nloss itself is an important predictor of mortality, and death\noccurring after graft loss is a highly relevant outcome.\nConsequently, the competing risks methodology is not an\nideal way to model overall mortality. Therefore, although\ndeath should be considered a competing risk in the assess-\nment of graft loss, it may be inappropriate to consider graft\nloss as a competing risk in the assessment of death. As\n2888 Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology\nsuch, traditional Kaplan-Meier functions with log-rank\ntests and Cox proportional hazards models were used to\nmodel the outcome of death.\nStatistical Analyses: Donor Outcomes\nDifferences between the study population and control\ngroups were determined using chi-squared analysis for\ndichotomous variables and two-sided t tests for continu-\nous variables. To examine center-level clustering of older\nlive donors, Lorenz curves were generated (18,19). Sur-\nvival estimates were obtained by Kaplan-Meier methods,\nwith administrative censoring at the time of linkage to the\nSocial Security Death Master File. For live donors, time at\nrisk was accrued from the date of donation. For NHANES-\nIII controls, time at risk was accrued from the date of\nenrollment into the study. After matching, log-rank tests\nand Cox proportional hazard models were used to com-\npare survival.\nAll analyses were performed using STATA 11.2/MP for\nLinux (College Station, Texas).\nResults\nStudy Population: Donors\n(Table 1, Figure 1A). The annual number of live donors\naged 70 ranged from 6 to 19, with an increasing trend\nover time (Figure 1B). Compared with live donors ages 50\nformed live donor kidney transplants during the study\nperiod, only 80 reported using live donors aged 70. Of\nadditional centers reported only two. The bulk of live\ndonors aged 70 occurred at only 17 centers (Figure 1C).\nStudy Population: Recipients\nRecipients of kidneys from live donors aged 70 were\nTable 1.

Graft failure was significantly higher among\nrecipients of kidneys from live donors aged 70 than those\nwho received kidneys from live donors ages 50 to 59 (SHR\nrecipients age 65, no statistically significant difference\nbetween recipients of live donors aged 70 and live do-\nP  0.07).

The line in (B) shows\nthe best-fit linear trend across time. The curves in (C) illustrate the distribution of living donor kidney transplants across centers in the United\nStates, stratified by donor age. The shift of the LD70 curve to the bottom right of the graph indicates that only a few centers performed live\ndonor kidney transplants using donors aged  70.\n2890 Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology\nDonor Outcomes\nAmong matched nondonor controls from the general pop-\nmortality comparing LD70s to matched NHANES-III con-\nDiscussion\nRecipients of live donor kidneys aged 70 had a signif-\nicantly higher rate of graft loss compared with recipients of\nyounger live donor kidneys aged 50 to 59. These kidneys\nwere in fact more comparable to kidneys from non-ECD\nOur findings directly contradict recent studies. In a\nrecently published study that included 73 older living do-\nnors (over 60), Young et al. reported no statistically signif-\nicant difference in graft loss (both all-cause and death-\ncensored) but a counter intuitive 2.7-fold higher risk of\nrecipient death (13). Another that included 117 donors over\ngraft loss was not associated with donor age, using a\nmultivariate model where almost no coefficient was statis-\ntically significant (20).\nOur analysis should be distinguished from previous\nstudies for several reasons. Most importantly, our power to\ndetect differences between the subgroups is significantly\ngreater than any other study of older living donors of\nwhich we are aware, in terms of sample size, length of\nfollow-up, and extremes of donor age. For example, sam-\nple size calculations indicate that it requires 199 patients in\neach group to have 80% power to detect a one-sided dif-\nference of 30% versus 20% allograft loss between older and\nyounger live donors; with only 73 patients, this power\nAlso, our methodology differs substantially from previ-\nous studies. A matched control study design was chosen to\ncompensate for the inherent instability of comparing a very\nsmall group (n  219) with a much larger group (n \n16,051) using typical regression models; in the latter, im-\nportant covariate effects in the smaller group (which is the\ngroup of interest) are missed. Second, competing risks\nmodels were chosen to make inferences about the indepen-\ndent association between older donor age and graft loss.\nModeling choices in previous studies made analyzing the\nassociation between advanced donor age and the allograft\nitself either impossible (because of inclusion of death when\nanalyzing all-cause graft loss) or misleading (because the\nassumptions of noninformative censoring that accompany\na death-censored graft loss analysis are violated). Finally,\ncalculating the cumulative incidence functions nonpara-\nmetrically (which is possible when competing risks and\nmatched controls methods are combined), in the manner of\nCoviello and Boggess, avoids the assumption of propor-\ntional hazards (15).\nThere are important potential limitations to this study.\nThe relatively small sample size limits the precision of our\nestimates. However, this study represents the patient pop-\nulation in the United States in its totality, and, to our\nknowledge, is the largest study of its kind. Missing data\ncan limit the identification of matched controls; however,\nonly 16 recipients went unmatched when comparing with\nFigure 2. | Cumulative incidence function (CIF) of graft failure (A)\nand Kaplan-Meier curve of patient survival (B) among recipients of\nkidneys from live donors age >70 (LD70) versus matched controls\nfrom among recipients of live donors age 50 to 59 (LD50) and\nFigure 3. | Kaplan-Meier survival curve of live kidney donors aged\n>70, compared with matched healthy controls drawn from the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cohort.\nlive donors ages 50 to 59, only six recipients went un-\nmatched when comparing with non-ECD deceased donors\nages 50 to 59, and missing data were handled using novel\nmatching techniques for donors so it is highly unlikely that\nmissing data contributed to false inferences (8). Also, al-\nthough we did not find a statistically significant difference\nin graft survival between the study and control group\nwhen only matched recipients over the age of 65 were\nconsidered, this may be related to the smaller sample size\nin this subgroup. Finally, when interpreting our findings, it\nmust be remembered that the older donors who represent\nour study group represent a highly selected group, which\nlikely does not represent the unscreened donor population\npresenting at any given center. As such, these results\nshould not be interpreted as implying that all prospective\ndonors over the age of 70 will have excellent long-term\nsurvival.\nKidneys from live donors aged 70 may not last as long\nin younger recipients as kidneys from younger living do-\nnors, even although recipients appear to have similar sur-\nvival. However, the clinical decision faced by a kidney\ntransplant candidate might be more complex; for example,\ndeciding to forgo live donor transplantation from an older\ndonor might mean waiting several years for a deceased\ndonor transplant. Because our comparison of recipients of\nolder living donor versus younger deceased donor kidneys\ninvolves those who received transplants, it does not take\ninto account the significant morbidity and mortality asso-\nciated with the waitlist. This implies that, although the\nperformance of grafts from live donors aged 70 may be\nless optimal than grafts from live donors ages 50 to 59 and\nmay be comparable to grafts from non-ECD deceased do-\nnors ages 50 to 59, they still are preferable to the well\ndocumented risks of joining a lengthening waitlist where\nmore than half of candidates over 60 are predicted to die\nbefore receiving a deceased donor transplant (2). Further-\nmore, avoiding the waitlist and proceeding directly to live\ndonation has important implications for the economic im-\npact of ESRD both at the individual and societal level. With\na national median wait-time exceeding 3 years, the costs of\nlong-term hemodialysis and its complications are high (22).\nFor patients who do not have a young, compatible live\ndonor, kidney transplantation from a healthy older live\ndonor remains a reasonable option.\nThese data have implications that expand the donor pool\nin other ways. For instance, a young transplant candidate\nmay be hesitant to accept a kidney from a compatible\nliving donor aged 70, as our data suggest that graft loss\nmay be higher. Such a pair could participate in a kidney\npaired donation with an incompatible pair with a younger\ndonor. In this scenario, both pairs would benefit, as the\nyounger recipient could receive a younger kidney, and the\nincompatible recipient would receive a compatible kidney\n(23,24). Compatible paired donation has the potential to\nexpand the number of pairs participating in kidney paired\ndonation and thus increase the likelihood that an incom-\npatible pair could find a match, while simultaneously di-\nrecting multiple living donor kidneys to the recipients who\ncould derive the most benefit from them.\nIn conclusion, we found that a cohort of appropriately\nliving kidney donors aged 70 had excellent 10-year over-\nall survival rates. However, we also found that recipients\nof live donor kidneys aged 70 had a significantly higher\nrate of graft loss compared with recipients of younger live\ndonor kidneys ages 50 to 59. These kidneys were in fact\nmore comparable to kidneys from non-ECD deceased do-\nnors ages 50 to 59. These results suggest that appropriately\nselected donor-recipient pairs can benefit from transplan-\ntation from live donors aged 70.\n"
