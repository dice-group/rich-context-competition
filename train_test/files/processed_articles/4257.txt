Perturbations\nin the cerebral lncRNAome were shown to exacerbate the\npathophysiology of a variety of CNS (central nervous system)\ndisorders, drug addiction and cancer (Michelhaugh et al.,\never, very little is known about the significance of lncRNAs\nafter acute injuries to the CNS. We recently showed that\nthe expression of many lncRNAs altered rapidly in rat brain\nfollowing transient focal cerebral ischemia (Dharap et al.,\n2012). Recent studies have shown evidence of physical as-\nsociations between lncRNAs and CMPs (chromatin modify-\ning proteins) such as polycomb repressive complex 2, ly-\nsine (K)-specific demethylase, euchromatic histone-lysine N-\nmethyltransferase 2 and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucle-\nRinn and Chang, 2012a). These interactions were shown to\nbe crucial for global processes such as chromosome inactiva-\ntion and lineage-specific gene repression (Nagano and Fraser,\nas the p53 response to environmental insults (Huarte et al.,\n2010). These studies suggest that lncRNAs play an essential\nrole in epigenetic silencing exerted by CMPs.\nA. Dharap and others\nRecent studies showed that the neuronal REST (RE-1 si-\nlencing transcription factor) and its corepressors Sin3A and\ncoREST were robustly activated in the rodent brain and to-\ngether mediated the epigenetic silencing of several neuronal\ngenes resulting in neuronal death after cerebral ischemia\n(Noh et al., 2012). REST is also known to control the expres-\nsion of non-coding RNAs in brain pathologies such as Hunt-\nington's disease (Johnson et al., 2010). We currently evalu-\nated whether stroke-responsive lncRNAs interact with Sin3A\nand coREST, the CMPs associated with REST (Andres et al.,\nTransient focal ischemia\nA 1 h transient MCAO (middle cerebral artery occlusion) was\ninduced in adult, male, spontaneously hypertensive rats (280\u00ad\n320 g; Charles River) under isoflurane anesthesia by the in-\ntraluminal suture method as described earlier (Dharap et al.,\nproved by the Research Animal Resources and Care Commit-\ntee of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and animals were\ncared for in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use\nof Laboratory Animals, US Department of Health and Human\nServices Publication number 86\u00ad23 (revised). After suturing\nthe wound, 0.5% bupivacaine (0.25 ml) was injected along\nthe incision to provide short duration local anesthesia. The\nanimals were allowed to recover from anesthesia and re-\nturned to the cage with ad libitum access to food and water.\nDuring the surgery, rats were under spontaneous respira-\ntion. Rats were killed at 6 h of reperfusion and the ipsilateral\ncortex was dissected. Sham-operated rats served as control.\nRIP (RNA immunoprecipitation)\nCortical tissue was homogenized in 1:1 phosphate-buffered\nsaline and nuclear isolation buffer [1.28 M sucrose; 40 mM\nresuspended in RIP buffer (Millipore).

The beads were then\ncollected using a magnetic stand, resuspended and washed\nfour times in RIP buffer. 20 l of this extract was used for\nWestern blotting to confirm Sin3A and coREST pull-down.\nBriefly, 20 l of RIP lysate was electrophoresed on a de-\nnaturing PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane\nand probed using Sin3A, coREST and -actin antibodies and\nthe corresponding HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-tagged sec-\nondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) followed by\nchemiluminescence detection and visualization of the bands.\nlncRNA microarray\nRNA was extracted from the RIP nuclear lysate preparation\nusing the Magna RIP kit (Millipore), linearly amplified, la-\nbeled with Cy3-dCTP, purified by RNAeasy Mini Kit (Qia-\ngen), fragmented and hybridized to an Arraystar lncRNA\nexpression microarray containing 9300 lncRNA probes as\ndescribed previously (Dharap et al., 2012). Differentially ex-\npressed transcripts were identified by fold-change screening\nwith a threshold of 2-fold. Statistically significant differ-\nences between the groups were identified by the statistical\nmeasures built in the GeneSpring based on the t test P value\nmethod with a high stringency (fold change cutoff of >2 and\na probability value of <0.001 to decrease false-positives).\nReal-time PCR\nThe mRNA expression of Dclk1 (doublecortin-like kinase\n1), GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), Fmr1 (fragile\nX mental retardation 1); Galntrl6 (UPD-N-acetyl-alpha-\nD-galactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltrans-\nferase-like 6); Fos (FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene) was eval-\nuated with real-time PCR using the SYBR-Green method\nas described earlier using 18s rRNA as an internal\ncontrol (Dharap et al., 2009).

The RIP-chiP showed a\nsignificant increase in enrichment of 99 lncRNAs with\nSin3A and 78 lncRNAs with coREST in the ischemia group\ncompared with the sham group. Three lncRNAs showed\nincreased binding to both Sin3A and coREST, as well\nas increased expression after focal ischemia compared with\nsham (Table 1). Twelve lncRNAs showed increased binding\nto both Sin3A and coREST after focal ischemia, but were\nnot induced in their expression after stroke (Table 1). A\nfurther 23 lncRNAs that showed increased binding to Sin3A\n(Table 2) and eight lncRNAs that showed increased binding\nto coREST (Table 3) were also significantly up-regulated\nafter focal ischemia compared with sham. A further 61\nlncRNAs showed increased binding to Sin3A and 55 lncRNAs\nshowed increased binding to coREST after focal ischemia,\nbut none of them were induced in their expression after\nstroke (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2; available at\nImportantly, of 537 lncRNAs significantly induced ( 2-\nfold) at 6 h of reperfusion after transient MCAO, the top 17\nstroke-induced lncRNAs (up-regulated from 22- to 93-fold\nover sham) (Dharap et al., 2012) were not enriched with ei-\nther protein (Sin3A or coREST) evaluated by RIP. For the top\n50 stroke-induced lncRNAs (up-regulated from 7- to 93-fold\nover sham), only seven showed increased enrichment with\nSin3A and three showed increased enrichment with coREST.\nTogether, this demonstrates that the enrichment of lncRNAs\nwith Sin3A and coREST is not an artifact of an overall increase\nin lncRNA gene expression after stroke, but instead selective\nrecruitment by these proteins. Interestingly, 74 and 85% of\nthe lncRNAs enriched with Sin3A and coREST, respectively,\nwere not significantly up-regulated following stroke suggest-\ning that they may be present as dormant reserve pools in the\nhealthy cortex that are subsequently targeted for recruit-\nment by activated Sin3A and coREST following an ischemic\ninsult.\nGenomic correlates of the Sin3A and\ncoREST-associated lncRNAs\nLncRNAs are transcribed from various loci including introns\nof protein-coding genes (sense), antisense to protein-coding\ngenes and intergenic stretches (Rinn and Chang, 2012b).

Of the three lncRNAs that showed increased en-\nrichment with both Sin3A and coREST as well as induced in\nexpression after stroke, two are intergenic and one is\nintragenic (Table 1). The Fos locus produced an lncRNA\nthat showed increased binding to both Sin3A and coREST\n(Table 1). Some Sin3A-enriched lncRNAs transcribed from in-\ntragenic loci that are particularly relevant to stroke, such as\nthe transcription factor Fos, Dclk1 and the astrocytic acti-\nvation marker GFAP (Table 2).

Whereas, Fmr1\nand Galntrl6 showed no significant change over sham at any\nreperfusion time after transient MCAO (Figure 2).\nDISCUSSION\nThe mammalian genome transcribes numerous lncRNAs that\nshow evolutionary conservation and are expressed in a stage\nand cell specific manner (Mercer and Mattick, 2013; Sabin\net al., 2013). Recent studies suggested that altered lev-\nels and/or functionality of lncRNAs play a role in various\npathologies including cancer, Alzheimer's disease and my-\nocardial infarction (Pastori and Wahlestedt, 2012; Ounzain\nA major function attributed to lncRNAs is to bind with\nCMPs and modulate their transcriptional activity (Rinn and\nChang, 2012a). Hence, a change in the expression profiles\nof lncRNAs under pathological conditions might significantly\ninfluence the functionality of CMPs. We recently showed that\nstroke alters the expression profiles of lncRNAs in a rapid and\nsignificant manner in rodent brain (Dharap et al., 2012). To\nunderstand the implications of the altered lncRNAome in\npost-stroke pathophysiology, we currently evaluate whether\nischemia promotes the association of lncRNAs with the CMPs\nthat act as corepressors of the transcription factor REST. Re-\ncent studies showed that REST up-regulation promotes post-\nREST is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in\nthe phenotypic maturation of neurons by silencing neural\ngenes in the non-neural cells of CNS during development.\nREST expression in the normal, adult brain is known to be low.\nSin3A and coREST are essential corepressors of REST that bind\nto its opposite terminals and recruit other silencing factors\nto the target loci (Ballas and Mandel, 2005). Our results show\nthat the physical association of many lncRNAs with Sin3A\nand coREST increase significantly following stroke. Although\nlncRNA expression and binding to CMPs are independent\nevents, several lncRNAs that showed increased binding to\nSin3A and coREST also showed increased expression follow-\ning focal ischemia. This suggests that the Sin3A- and coREST-\nenriched lncRNAs induced after stroke might play important\nroles in modifying the post-ischemic epigenetic landscape by\nmodulating the REST-mediated gene silencing.\nPrevious work exploring the binding of various CMPs to\nlncRNAs showed that each protein has a distinct lncRNA\nsignature with marginal overlap with other related CMPs\n(Khalil et al., 2009). Our data support this by showing that a\nmajority of the stroke-induced lncRNAs were bound to Sin3A\nor coREST with only three common lncRNAs that bound to\nboth. Since Sin3A and coREST bind opposite termini of REST,\nthese overlapping lncRNAs might serve as a scaffold to recruit\nSin3A and coREST to the REST complex and/or facilitate the\nrecruitment of other proteins such as histone deacetylases\nthat are common to both corepressors (Ballas and Mandel,\nMost of the lncRNAs that showed increased binding to\nSin3A and coREST are intergenic. However, some are also\nintragenic and were mapped to the loci of protein-coding\ngenes such as Fos, Dclk1, GFAP and Fmr1. The impact of the\nintragenic lncRNAs on the expression of the corresponding\nprotein-coding transcripts is unclear. LncRNAs can silence\nor activate the expression of the associated genes cis or in\ntrans (Batista and Chang, 2013). The expression of lncRNA\nserved to be up-regulated by 13-fold after focal ischemia.\nboth Sin3A and coREST also increased after focal ischemia\nby 3-fold.

Dharap and others\nthe same locus may position the lncRNA to serve as an\nupstream regulator or downstream effector of Fos proba-\nbly via REST and its corepressors. A similar functional as-\nsociation was previously shown for lincRNA-p21 and p53.\nThe lincRNA-p21 induced by p53 was shown to associate\nwith a p53 complex to repress the expression of p53 tar-\nare stroke-induced lncRNAs that originate from a sense exon\nand sense intron, respectively, of the Dclk1 gene. Both lncR-\nNAs showed identical expression levels (distinct probes incor-\nporating the sequence variation were used to detect these\ntwo lncRNAs) and were significantly enriched with Sin3A.\nThis suggests that these two lncRNAs might control Dclk1\nfunction via Sin3A in the post-ischemic cortex. The lncRNA\nwere induced after ischemia by 6.8- and 2.4-fold, respec-\ntively, and GFAP expression was also induced concomitantly.\nNot all lncRNA/protein-coding pairs from the same loci will\nbe co-regulated. For example, expression of Dclk1 and Gal-\nntrl1 was not altered although the lncRNAs associated with\nwere up-regulated in their expression as well as binding to\nSin3A/coREST. However, our data indicate that the stroke-\ninduced lncRNAs expressed from intragenic loci does not ex-\nhibit a cis inhibitory effect. Instead, these lncRNAs might\neither induce or serve to maintain the expression of the\nprotein-coding transcripts at a normal level by activating\nthe epigenetic signatures as demonstrated previously (Huang\net al., 2010). Furthermore, some lncRNAs showed coexpres-\nsion with their corresponding protein-coding genes while\nothers did not. Hence, it is possible that intragenic lncRNAs\nmay be transcribed differentially from the same transcrip-\ntion start sites as that of the corresponding protein-coding\ngenes or via novel internal start sites independent of the\nprotein-coding gene unit.\nIn summary, this is the first study to demonstrate sig-\nnificantly increased association between ischemia- induced\nlncRNAs with CMPs Sin3A and coREST. While we studied\nonly two CMPs, there might be others that are active in the\npost-ischemic brain and may bind to ischemia-induced lncR-\nNAs to form unique ribonucleoprotein functional complexes.\nSuch interactions might be functionally significant for the\nischemic pathophysiology.\nAshutosh Dharap and Raghu Vemuganti designed the study.\nAshutosh Dharap and Courtney Pokrzywa conducted experi-\nments.
