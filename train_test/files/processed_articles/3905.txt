It has changed the way we communicate, work, search information, and\nengage in many other everyday activities (Haythornthwaite and Wellman, 2002; Rainie\nand Wellman, 2012). Hardly surprising, the Internet also opened up new pathways for\nunpaid benevolent activities and engagement such as volunteering. Online volunteering\nis a side effect of the currently unfolding overarching process of digitalization. However,\nempirical evidence on online volunteering and its individual-level determinants is scarce.\nFor traditional offline volunteering, levels of engagement, for example, in terms of asso-\nciational volunteering, are decreasing, especially among young people (Freitag et al.,\n2016; Putnam, 2000). Given the well-documented beneficial impact of offline volunteer-\ning on individuals and societies--ranging from improved individual well-being, to occu-\npational achievements, up to decreased neighborhood crime rates, and so on (Putnam,\n2000; Wilson, 2000)--unequal civic participation constitutes an increasing societal con-\ncern. In this respect, a key question is whether new forms of engagement such as online\nvolunteering can overcome these patterns of inequality or whether they are exacerbated\nin the digital sphere.1\nSuch inequalities represent a threat to social cohesion, and the associated lack of\nsocial capital harms the excluded strata of society. Thus, it is important to examine\nwhether online volunteering helps to overcome or foster these inequalities. Theoretically,\nwe follow the arguments made by Vissers and Stolle (2014) on online political participa-\ntion. On one hand, the Internet might be yet another tool for volunteering that attracts the\nsame people as offline volunteering (see also Robles et al., 2013). Thus, it might rein-\nforce existing patterns of stratification regarding the resources, motivations, and net-\nworks of volunteers. On the other hand, differences in the nature of online and offline\nvolunteering might also mobilize different kinds of people. If that is the case, online\nvolunteering has the potential to democratize volunteering by attracting individuals who\ndo not carry out offline social work. This would be a sign of hope for those who fear that\ndigitalization will foster existing structures of inequality in society.\nExisting research often focuses on specific activities on the Internet that fall in the\ncategory of online volunteering, such as contributing to a Wikipedia entry (Amichai-\nHamburger et al., 2008; Loveland and Reagle, 2013) or the free provision of resources,\nfor instance via Couchsurfing (Rosen et al., 2011). The aim of this article is, however, to\ncomprehensively examine online volunteering from a theoretical and empirical perspec-\ntive using data from a representative population survey. We approach the topic in an\nexploratory manner and build on different strands of literature. To develop theoretical\nexpectations, we draw on the research scrutinizing the correlates of volunteering (see\nWilson, 2000, 2012, for an overview), in particular the Civic Voluntarism Model (CVM)\nproposed by Verba et al. (1995). Furthermore, we refer to conceptual research on online\nvolunteering (e.g.Amichai-Hamburger, 2008) as well as studies focusing on online polit-\nical participation (Oser et al., 2013; Vissers and Stolle, 2014). We use the Swiss\nVolunteering Survey 2014 to test our arguments empirically, since this is the first repre-\nsentative population survey that includes a measure of online volunteering. In interna-\ntional comparison, Switzerland ranks regularly among the leading countries, exhibiting\nAckermann and Manatschal 3\nthe highest associational volunteering rate besides Germany and the Netherlands in\nEurope (Freitag et al., 2016).At the same time, offline voluntary engagement is declining\nin Switzerland (Freitag et al., 2016), which makes it a paradigmatic case to study online\nas compared to offline volunteering.\nMultinomial Heckman selection models reveal that both mechanisms seem to be at\nwork, reinforcement and mobilization. While the CVM is able to explain offline-only\nvolunteering, online-only volunteering is driven by different determinants. The explana-\ntions converge in the hybrid type that combines offline and online volunteering.\nAdditional analyses show that the CVM is especially unable to explain volunteering of\nyounger generations for whom online volunteering seems to be particularly attractive.\nWho volunteers?\nVolunteering is generally defined as \"any activity in which time is given freely to ben-\nefit another person, group, or organization\" (Wilson, 2000: 215). Although this is\nrarely made explicit, most people still associate volunteering primarily with real-life or\n\"offline\" activities. Existing research distinguishes mainly two manifestations of this\nkind of offline volunteering: formal volunteering occurring within an organization or\nassociation, and informal volunteering outside of organizations such as neighborhood\ndistinguishes these activities from wage work is the fact that volunteers receive no (or\nonly symbolic) remuneration for their productive voluntary engagement, although\nrecipients of these acts clearly benefit from this kind of volunteering (B\u00fchlmann and\nTo explain volunteering in terms of individual-level determinants, different models\nare discussed in the literature focusing on factors such as subjective dispositions, human\nresources, the life course, and social contexts (for an overview, see Wilson, 2012). We\nmake use of an approach that integrates different aspects into one comprehensive model:\nthe CVM. Following this model proposed by Verba et al. (1995), the correlates of politi-\ncal and social participation can be distinguished along three lines: resources, recruitment,\nand engagement. To start with, volunteering is linked to human resources and individual\nsociodemographic factors that relate to time, money, and skills (Verba et al. 1995: 271).\nUndisputedly, education represents one of the most powerful and consistent predictors of\nvirtually all forms of volunteering (Gesthuizen et al., 2008; Janoski et al., 1998; Putnam,\nknowledge, and a broader sensitization for societal challenges (Gesthuizen and Scheepers,\n2012). Furthermore, highly educated individuals have generally higher status jobs and\nare therefore more likely to be asked to volunteer than lowly educated individuals\n(Janoski et al., 1998; Wilson, 2012). A related factor to time resources is age. The link\nbetween age and volunteering is not assumed to be perfectly linear, but in general it is\nexpected to be positive. While the school context might be fruitful for volunteering,\nyoung adults have a low probability to do voluntary work (Wilson, 2000, 2012). In mid-\ndle age, when people typically have established their professional career and founded a\nfamily, the rates of volunteering rise. Different mechanisms may account for this effect.\nThe entrance of kids in schools might generate free time and provide opportunities for\nvolunteering through children's activities (Wilson, 2000). Moreover, a change in values\nand attitudes over the life course might also account for rising rates of volunteering.\nEspecially, individuals in their later life might value volunteering more because they\nrealize that they will themselves need help in the near future (Wilson, 2000). There is,\nhowever, little evidence that people start to volunteer after retirement because they\ngained time resources. Volunteering seems to be more like a habit that people develop\nover the life course (Wilson, 2012). Finally, the relationship between gender and volun-\nteering is rather complex. While women are more likely to hold pro-social values and\nnorms, so to say social skills that fuel volunteering, men are more likely to attain the\nnecessary civic skills through jobs and education (Schlozman et al., 1994; Wilson, 2000).\nThus, gender effects are highly dependent on the form of voluntary work as well as the\nApart from sociodemographics and human resources, volunteering is--to a varying\nextent--a collective activity facilitated by recruitment through social networks such as\nfriendships and organizational memberships. These social networks supply information,\nprovide support, and create obligations (Wilson and Musick, 1997). In particular,\nchurches and religious institutions provide a contextual setting that is fruitful for the\nestablishment of the aforementioned social networks and the promotion of social norms\n(Traunm\u00fcller, 2012). Religious institutions offer opportunities to obtain civic skills and\ngather information, turning religion into a gateway to other forms of social participation\n(Lam, 2006; Ruiter and De Graaf, 2006). Especially, Protestantism is found to increase\nthe propensity to volunteer because of its participatory structures and values (Ruiter and\nFinally, psychological engagement plays a key role in volunteering. While concrete\nmotives for one or the other voluntary work might differ, norms of generalized reciproc-\nity as well as social trust likely serve as a general motivational basis for volunteering.\nExisting research reveals clear connections between pro-social norms such as different\nmanifestations of reciprocal norms or trust and various forms of offline volunteering\n(2000: 118) notion that altruistic behaviors and attitudes \"tend to go together,\" general-\nized reciprocity expressing the idea that \"doing good always pays off\" and social trust\nshould thus coincide with a higher propensity to volunteer.\nBringing online volunteering into the picture\nIf volunteering is highly dependent on resources, recruitment, and psychological engage-\nment, unequal provision of these factors implies inequalities in volunteering. The crucial\nquestion is whether these inequalities are reinforced by new opportunities of online vol-\nunteering or whether online volunteering is an opportunity to overcome inequalities by\nmobilizing different people. Online volunteering can be defined as a \"type of civic engage-\nment where the volunteers perform their tasks using the Internet either from their home or\nother offsite locations\" (Mukherjee, 2011: 253). Beyond this definition, no standard con-\nceptualization of online volunteering exists in the literature. Therefore, we draw on\nWilson's (2000) definition of volunteering saying that time should be given freely to ben-\nefit others without receiving a direct reward. Accordingly, online volunteering includes a\nAckermann and Manatschal 5\nvariety of activities like administering the website of a club, moderating a Facebook\ngroup, contributing to a Wikipedia entry, recording a non-commercial instructional\nYouTube video, or engaging in Couchsurfing. Thus, the activity does not necessarily need\nto be interactive and it might also include the provision of infrastructure, but the online\nvolunteer has to invest time and others have to benefit from it. Given the pioneering char-\nacter of this study, we cannot draw on a standard theoretical framework to explain online\nvolunteering. Instead, we approach this question by comparing the nature of online and\noffline volunteering and derive theoretical expectations about the determinants of online\nvolunteering therefrom.\nStructural similarities between offline and online voluntary activities make a rein-\nforcement of inequalities likely. For both kinds of activities, people need certain skills\nand motivations. The sort of skills and motivations might depend more on the degree of\nformalization than on the sphere where the activity takes place (offline or online). If a\nperson engages in formal volunteering, organizational skills, such as coordinating with\nothers and getting things done in time, might be necessary. For informal volunteering,\nskills and motivations, like caring for others, are of higher importance. Giving private\nmathematics tutoring to pupils in the neighborhood and explaining mathematical basics\nto a broader public on YouTube might necessitate fairly similar skills and motivations.\nThus, the degree of formalization is expected to determine the required skills and moti-\nvations. Online and offline volunteering, however, not only require certain skills, but\nthey also provide learning opportunities to enhance skills and self-efficacy. This aspect\nwill be especially interesting for those who have an instrumental perspective on volun-\nteering and see it as an investment. Again, however, learning and qualification opportu-\nnities might differ across activities (e.g. formal or informal volunteering) but less so\nacross spheres of volunteering (online or offline). Formal volunteering for an associa-\ntion, for instance, especially if documented with a certificate, may be a more important\njob qualification than informal engagement, regardless of whether this formal engage-\nment occurred online or offline. Given these similarities of online and offline volunteer-\ning in terms of requirements and benefits, we may expect that both spheres of volunteering\nattract the same kind of people. Their engagement is supposed to be enabled by the same\ntype of resources, networks, and psychological motivations. In other words, higher edu-\ncation, a higher overall socioeconomic status, social trust, religious norms and norms of\nreciprocity, social networks, as well as higher age and potentially also being male would\nincrease the likelihood of becoming a volunteer in both spheres.\nTaking a contrasting perspective, differences in the characteristics of online and offline\nvolunteering support the argument that online volunteering has the potential to mobilize\ndifferent kinds of people. For instance, offline volunteering is in general less flexible than\nonline volunteering. It usually takes place at a fixed point in time and is restricted to local\nactivities as well as to a limited variety of topics (Amichai-Hamburger, 2008: 554,\nCravens, 2000). These constraints can be easily overcome in online volunteering. On the\nInternet, people can volunteer for whatever cause and whenever they want. What is more,\npotential benefits of online volunteering can virtually extend all over the globe. The flex-\nibility of online volunteering may especially attract young people who are still in educa-\ntion or at the start of their professional career. In this phase of life, which is often\ncharacterized by mobility and rapid changes, flexibility in time and place becomes a key\nfactor for assuming a voluntary activity. Moreover, online volunteering may attract young\npeople particularly due to the variety of topics one can volunteer for on the Internet.\nFinally, as \"digital natives\" (Hargittai, 2010), young people representing the \"generation\nY\" (born after 1980) and following generations are just more used to the Internet.\nEspecially, the use of social media and networks is more common among young people\nand has the potential to strengthen their civic and political engagement (Skoric et al.,\n2016; Xenos et al., 2014). Thus, we expect that the higher affiliation of young people to\nthe Internet should also facilitate their access to online volunteering. Whether accessibil-\nity is still higher among men than women and should therefore make men more likely to\nvolunteer online is debated in the literature. Recent findings still report a gender gap in\nself-reported Internet skills, while actual knowledge and performance do not differ\nbetween men and women (Van Deursen and Van Dijk, 2010, 2015). We argue that self-\nperceived skills will, however, be more crucial for the accessibility of online volunteering.\nIndividuals with low self-perceived skills will not feel well-equipped for volunteering\nonline. Thus, the accessibility of online volunteering should be higher for men. Beyond\nflexibility and accessibility, online volunteering implies, in most cases, a higher degree of\nanonymity (Amichai-Hamburger, 2008). At least for some online volunteering activities,\nneither face-to-face contact with fellow volunteers nor direct contact with the addressees\nis necessary (Rafaeli et al., 2009). Thus, the level of obligation and commitment should\nbe lower. This may imply a lower relevance of networks and psychological engagement.\nIn conclusion, these theoretical considerations result in two contrasting expectations,\nas illustrated in Table 1. Given the structural similarities of online and offline volunteer-\ning, one can expect the same resources, networks, and motivations to be decisive (rein-\nforcement). If this is the case, the overlap of online and offline volunteering should be\nconsiderably large, implying that a high share of respondents should fall into the hybrid\nTable 1.

Meanwhile, important differences\nbetween the two spheres of volunteering fuel the expectation that online volunteering\nwill attract different people than offline volunteering (mobilization). Accordingly, the\noverlap between the two forms of volunteering expressed by the hybrid category should\nbe relatively small. The two arguments oppose each other, but it is also highly plausible\nthat they are simultaneously at work. The similarities of offline and online volunteering\nlikely reinforce existing patterns of stratification, while the differences may help to over-\ncome them.\nData and research design\nTo test the theoretical expectations outlined above, our empirical analysis bases on the\nlatest wave of the Swiss Volunteering Survey conducted in 2014. Random sampling for\nthis survey was conducted by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office based on Swiss register\ndata and applying a three-stage stratification: Inhabitants of small cantons (strata 1),\nyoung adults (strata 2), as well as immigrants (strata 3) have been oversampled.Amixed-\nmode survey method was applied, where respondents could decide whether to answer the\nquestionnaire online (Computer-Assisted Web Interview [CAWI]) or by phone\n(Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview [CATI]).2 As a result of these measures, impor-\ntant sociodemographic and socioeconomic conditions of the Swiss population are well\nrepresented in the survey (Reimann, 2015).\nOur outcome of main interest is a nominal variable, which captures different types of\nvolunteering as well as non-volunteering. The variable comprises four categories:\noffline-only volunteers, online-only volunteers, volunteers who combine their offline\nengagement with online volunteering, and non-volunteers. Using a nominal variable\ninstead of dichotomous variables for the four categories enables us to neatly capture each\nengagement profile and disentangle the dynamics between the different engagement\ntypes. The category offline-only volunteers denotes individuals who engage in informal\nand/or formal volunteering offline, and who do not volunteer online, using the following\ntwo survey items:\nWe would now like to ask you about all the voluntary or honorary work you performed for any\nassociations, organizations, or public institutions over the past four weeks.3 Have you carried\nout one or more activities of this type? (Offline volunteering, formal)\nDid you perform another type of unpaid work beyond volunteering in associations or\norganizations, such as transport aid, babysitting (children other than your own), neighborly-aid,\nor supporting any kind of projects or events, etc. in the last four weeks? (The work has to be for\nthe benefit of people outside one's own household) (Offline volunteering, informal)\nConversely, the category online-only volunteers includes persons who volunteer exclu-\nsively online, but not outside the Internet. Since online volunteering is a rather new phe-\nnomenon, and to the best of our knowledge no established concept and measure available\nyet, we developed a measure of online volunteering drawing on Wilson's (2000: 215)\nnotion of volunteering. The following exploratory question on online volunteering uses\nseveral specific examples for unpaid beneficial, that is, voluntary, activities:\nApart from the already discussed forms of volunteering, the Internet provides manifold options\nto volunteer online, meaning for unpaid work or engagement. I mention now several examples\nof online volunteering. Please let me know for each example, whether you have already\nvolunteered online in this manner:\n\u00ad Host the website of an association or organization\n\u00ad Contribute to an entry on Wikipedia or open street map\n\u00ad Write an informative entry on a forum or blog, or a newsletter which is published online\n\u00ad Found and/or moderate a Facebook group\n\u00ad Publish how-to manuals/videos on Youtube or similar online platforms\n\u00ad Collaborate in open source projects (e.g. Linux, open office, etc.)\n\u00ad Offer online consultancy or expertise\n\u00ad Offer infrastructure online (e.g. Couchsurfing)\n\u00adOther(Online volunteering)\nIndividuals indicating at least one of the activities mentioned above are considered\nonline volunteers. The comprehensive category offline and online volunteers captures all\nindividuals who engage in at least one form of offline volunteering (i.e. formal, informal,\nor both) and who also volunteer online. Non-volunteers, finally, who do neither volunteer\noffline nor online, constitutes the baseline category of our empirical analysis. Table 2\nillustrates the coding scheme.\nAs Figure 1 shows, the largest share of all respondents are offline volunteers, suggest-\ning that conventional real-life volunteering still represents the most widespread type of\nengagement overall (40.3%). The fact that comprehensive, meaning online and offline\nvolunteers (17.9%), and not solely online volunteers (9.3%), represent the second largest\nengagement group, may be a first sign that the two types of engagement are not, or at\nleast not entirely, mutually exclusive and may share certain commonalities. One-third of\nall respondents do not volunteer at all (32.5%).\nTable 2.

While the share of offline vol-\nunteers exceeds the share of offline and online volunteers among older respondents by\nthree times, the difference almost disappears among younger respondents between 15\nand 34years, who are often referred to as \"generation Y,\" the first generation growing up\nwith the Internet (Hargittai, 2010). The pattern highlights the increasing relevance of the\nInternet offering attractive volunteering opportunities for this young generation of \"digi-\ntal natives.\" In the empirical analysis, special attention shall be given to these pronounced\ngenerational differences.\nOur main explanatory variables include measures for sociodemographics, human\nresources, recruitment, and psychological engagement. We integrate gender and age as\nsociodemographic individual characteristics into the analysis. Age will also be crucial to\ntest our generation-based expectations. Human resources are captured by education as\none of the most powerful and consistent predictors of virtually all forms of volunteering.\nRecruitment is measured by social networks, as well as religious affiliation and practice\nin terms of churchgoing frequency, while psychological engagement is captured by gen-\neralized reciprocity and social trust. More detailed information on all variables, their\noperationalization, and descriptive statistics can be found in Table OA1 in the Online\nAppendix.\nMethodologically, we use multinomial regression analyses in combination with\nHeckman selection models. Multinomial regression analysis allows us to model the\nnominal outcome of our dependent variable, whereas the selection model is necessary to\nFigure 1. Distribution of (non-)volunteers across engagement types and age groups.\nNote: Weighted shares based on the Swiss Volunteering Survey 2014.\naddress non-randomness in our sample. More specifically, we account for the self-selec-\ntion of Internet users, who are eligible for online volunteering, whereas non-Internet\nusers are not. To do so, we model Internet use on the first stage of our selection model,\ncalculate the inverted selection propensity (inverse Mills Ratio) of Internet use, and con-\ntrol for it in the second stage of our analysis, the multinomial outcome model.4 To fully\nspecify our first-stage selection model, we add the following variables: A dichotomous\nvariable indicating Internet use serves as the outcome variable on this first analytical\nstage. Furthermore, and in addition to the explanatory factors mentioned above, we\ninclude individual information on income and citizenship as independent variables in our\nfirst-stage selection model. Canton fixed effects will be used to account for unobserved\ncantonal heterogeneity. Running the models with cantonal controls for language region\nand degree of urbanization--two well-documented factors influencing volunteering and\nInternet use in Switzerland (Freitag et al., 2016; Kriesi and Baglioni, 2003; Stadelmann-\nSteffen et al., 2010)--instead of the cantonal fixed effects produces very similar results.\nEmpirical results\nThe results of our multinomial Heckman regression models for different types of volun-\nteering are presented in Table 4 in Appendix 1. Since coefficients from multinomial\nlogistic models can be difficult to interpret, we complement the main analyses reported\nin Table 4 by post-estimation procedures. We focus on the average marginal effects to\ndiscuss the results (Table 3). They facilitate a substantive interpretation of the profiles for\nthe four engagement types, allowing for a first assessment of whether the propensity for\nonline and hybrid (online and offline) volunteering can be read as a product of reinforce-\nment, mobilization, or both.\nA glance at the results for the pure volunteering types, offline only and online only,\nrespectively, reveals clear differences between the resource profiles of volunteers engag-\ning exclusively in the two arenas. In line with our theoretical expectations, sociodemo-\ngraphics and human capital (resources), as well as social networks and religious\nbelonging and practice (recruitment), turn out to be distinctive factors characterizing\noffline volunteers.\nChanging, for instance, the gender of an otherwise identical individual from male to\nfemale increases the likelihood to volunteer only offline by 12\npercentage points.\nMeanwhile, 10 additional years of age elevate the same probability by 4\npercentage\npoints. An increase in educational attainment from primary to secondary or tertiary edu-\ncation raises the probability to volunteer offline only by 10 and 9\npercentage points,\nrespectively. Religious denomination and practice are further distinctive traits of offline\nvolunteers: frequent as opposed to no churchgoing raises the likelihood of mere offline\npercentage points. Interestingly, pro-social values (psychological\nengagement) do not affect the likelihood to volunteer only offline.\nFor individuals who volunteer only on the Internet, in turn, these resources do not\nseem to matter much. In stark contrast to the pure offline category, most of the factors\nthat are distinctive for this group are irrelevant to characterize online-only volunteers.\nWorth mentioning is the inverse gender pattern for online volunteering, which is in line\nwith our theoretical expectations: switching gender from male to female in otherwise\nAckermann and Manatschal 11\nidentical individuals decreases the probability to volunteer only online by 6percentage\npoints. Besides male gender, young age also increases the likelihood to volunteer online\nonly, respectively (minus 2percentage points for 10 additional years of age). The find-\nings confirm, thus, the picture of young people as \"digital natives\" (we return to the\nquestion of generational differences in more detail below). Overall, the stark differences\nin the profiles of the two exclusive volunteering groups reported in Table 3 suggest that\nthe decision to volunteer offline or online is driven by different factors. Yet, this is not the\nwhole story. Based on our theoretical argument outlined above, we would expect that if\nthe two arenas of volunteering attract very different people, there should be little overlap\nbetween the profiles of online and offline volunteers (expectation of mobilization). As\nFigure 1, however, showed, hybrid types combining offline and online volunteering are\nrather popular: 18% of all respondents (and 24% of the 15\u00ad34years old) indicate a hybrid\nengagement type, whereas, for instance, only 9% of all respondents volunteer online\nonly.\nA look at the group combining online and offline volunteering in the third column in\nTable 3 suggests that in this hybrid form of engagement the profiles of offliners and\nonliners converge. Like offliners, volunteers pursuing offline and online activities are\ntypically endowed with more resources, for instance, in terms of education: changing\neducation from primary to tertiary increases the probability of a hybrid engagement by\npercentage points. Recruitment via frequent churchgoing seems also to apply to this\nhybrid category. Unlike for the offline-only profile, social trust becomes a significant\ntrait for the offline and online engagement type: a change from \"you cannot be too\nTable 3.

Overall, similarities with the offline-only category in\nterms of resources and recruitment support the assumption that those who engage offline\nwould also engage online (reinforcement). The findings for age and gender, in turn, cor-\nroborate our mobilization expectation, as they align with the pattern for the online-only\ncategory. Switching from male to female decreases the likelihood to engage offline and\nonline by 6percentage points. The same decrease amounts to minus 3percentage points\nfor 10 additional years of age. The last columns in Table 3 finally illustrate the lack of\nresources, recruitment, and psychological engagement among non-volunteers.\nIn the light of the pronounced generational differences revealed in Figure 1 and Table\n3, we rerun the analyses for different age groups. Given their early socialization with the\nInternet, the following analyses focus on the difference between representatives of the\ngeneration Y, or digital natives (15\u00ad34years old), which are compared to older respond-\nyears and more). The results of the respective multinomial Heckman selection\nand outcome analyses are shown in Table OA2 in the Online Appendix. Similar to the\npreceding analyses, the discussion of the results will focus on the average marginal effects\nas they facilitate a substantive interpretation of the engagement profiles. To visualize dif-\nferences across generations, Figure 2 illustrates the average marginal effects graphically.\nA look at the left graph in Figure 2 reveals that the resource-intense profile from the\nCVM characterizing offline-only volunteers applies well to older respondents (35years\nand older), whereas the variables of the CVM are less systematically related to offline\nvolunteering in the younger age group. To start with the similarities, switching from\nprimary to tertiary education increases the probability to volunteer only offline by 10\n(young) and 18percentage points (old), respectively. The female overrepresentation does\nalso hold for both generations. Recruitment via social networks or religion (Protestantism\nand churchgoing frequency) does, however, only explain offline volunteering propensity\namong older respondents: changing from a socially isolated respondent of 35\nyears or\nolder to a socially connected individual of the same age, for instance, increases the prob-\nability to engage only offline by 32\npercentage points. The same switch from socially\nisolated to strongly connected individuals does, however, not alter the offline-only vol-\nunteer propensity among 15- to 34-year-old respondents. Corroborating further the find-\nings reported in Table 3, the variables of the CVM are not able to explain online-only\nvolunteering, irrespective of the age group. The female underrepresentation in the online-\nonly engagement type holds for both groups, the 15\u00ad34years old as well as the 35years\nand older.\nAgain, the CVM is most helpful to explain the hybrid (online and offline) engagement\namong older respondents, although denominational factors are no longer a defining trait\nof older volunteers in this group. Apart from the factor churchgoing frequency, which\nincreases offline and online engagement propensity among both, young (plus 26percent-\nage points) and older respondents (plus 16percentage points), the variables of the CVM\ndo not contribute to the explanation of a hybrid engagement among young respondents.\nThe rightmost graph in Figure 2 finally confirms that non-volunteering relates to a lack\nof resources, recruitment, and psychological engagement in both groups, younger and\nolder respondents.\nAckermann and Manatschal 13\nFigure 2.

Reference categories are \"primary education\" and \"non-denominational.\"\nApossible source for concern are potential mode effects of CAWI (Internet) and CATI\n(telephone) interviews. To account for potential mode effects (e.g. respondent selection\ninto a specific mode or response effects depending on survey mode) and, thus, to test the\nrobustness of our findings, we rerun the models reported in Table 3 separately for tele-\nphone--and Internet respondents only (seeTables OA3 and OA4 in the OnlineAppendix).\nThe findings are very similar to the main results reported in Table 3, and there are no\nsigns of a systematic distortion of the findings due to survey mode.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we set out to answer the question whether online volunteering is driven by\nthe same determinants as offline volunteering. Our aim was to evaluate whether inequali-\nties in social participation are reinforced in the virtual sphere or whether online volun-\nteering can overcome them by means of mobilization. We addressed this question using\na data set providing, for the first time, insights on the extent of online volunteering based\non a comprehensive population survey carried out in 2014 in Switzerland. Following the\nestablished CVM by Verba et al. (1995), we argued that offline volunteering requires\ncertain sociodemographic factors, human resources, recruitment through social net-\nworks, as well as psychological engagement. We discussed whether these factors may\nalso stratify volunteering online (reinforcement) or whether online volunteering attracts\nand mobilizes different kinds of people (mobilization). Our findings support both ideas.\nOnline volunteering seems to reinforce existing patterns of inequality in volunteering,\nbut it has also the potential to mobilize and lure different kinds of people into social\nparticipation.\nTo start with, we find that the CVM explains why individuals become offline volun-\nteers. They have more social networks, are generally more trusting, have higher educa-\ntion levels, and are more religious (in terms of denomination and practice). Our\ndifferentiated analyses across age groups, however, reveal that this holds only for older\nrespondents (35years and more). The CVM is clearly less precise to capture the profile\nof young offline-only volunteers between 15 and 34\nyears. One possible explanation\nrelates to the fact that they might still be in the process of acquiring the resources and\nbuilding up the social networks necessary for volunteering. Regarding psychological\nengagement, it seems that young respondents are mobilized through different values than\nthe ones included in our model.\nConversely, the variables of the CVM are not related to pure online volunteering. We\nobserve this pattern in a similar way among younger and older respondents. From a theo-\nretical perspective, we have argued that differences between online and offline volun-\nteering suggest online volunteering will attract different kinds of people. The higher\ndegree of flexibility and anonymity on the Internet goes along with a lower degree of\ncommitment and obligation. This makes online volunteering a low-threshold activity, for\nwhich no extensive resources, social networks, or a particularly pronounced psychologi-\ncal engagement is necessary. Meanwhile, technical skills and a certain affinity for digital\ntechnology are more important, which explains why young people as \"digital natives\"\nare more eager to volunteer online. Also, a gender gap is still visible in this respect, with\nmen being more likely to volunteer online than women.\nAckermann and Manatschal 15\nThis support for the mobilization thesis among pure online volunteers is, however,\nonly part of the story. A look at the third category of volunteers who combine offline and\nonline volunteering reveals \"hybrid\" explanations. In other words, for the hybrid cate-\ngory of offline and online volunteering, both mechanisms appear to be at work. On one\nhand, there is evidence for the mechanism of reinforcement: the profile of the hybrid\ncategory is more resource-intense than the one of pure onliners and resembles the profile\nof pure offliners. Like in the category of pure offline volunteers, this resource pattern\ncan, however, only be observed for respondents who are 35years or older. On the other\nhand, mobilization seems to occur since men and young respondents are more likely to\nvolunteer offline plus online. For the subset of young respondents, the gender effect is,\nhowever, not significant.\nTo sum up, our findings suggest that both scenarios, reinforcement and mobiliza-\ntion, apply for online volunteering. Reinforcement seems to occur among individuals\ncommanding the resources, networks for recruitment, and psychological engagement\nof offline volunteers, who combine their activities with online volunteering (hybrid\ntype). At the same time, mobilization seems to be at work because online volunteering\nseems to attract persons with other characteristics than the ones necessary for offline\nvolunteering. Our results are in line with studies on online political participation,\nwhich show that reinforcement and mobilization take place (Vissers and Stolle, 2014)\nand that especially young people are mobilized through online political participation\nFurther research is needed to complement the preliminary and exploratory findings\npresented here on the nature and extent of online volunteering. To better understand this\nnew phenomenon, its relevance for voluntary engagement, and its impact on, and inter-\naction with, conventional forms of offline volunteering, it is essential to collect addi-\ntional data and to further develop the conceptualization and measurement of online\nvolunteering, ideally also in different social contexts. While we would expect that the\nfindings presented here are generalizable to other countries with high, but declining,\noffline volunteering rates, such as Germany, the Netherlands, or the United States, addi-\ntional research in different countries is required to test this assumption. Future research\nshould also tackle the question of measurement and carefully think about potential\nimprovements. It would, for instance, be important to indicate more clearly in the formal\nand informal survey questions that the voluntary work takes place offline. Another limi-\ntation of this study regards causality. Using cross-sectional data, our analyses cannot\nprove causation. Nevertheless, our finding that pure offline and pure online volunteers\nhave very different individual profiles strongly suggests that mobilization of formerly\nnot engaged individuals is happening, and not mere conversion of former pure offliners\ninto pure onliners. However, quasi-experimental or panel studies are needed to prove this\ncausal expectation.\nFrom a theoretical perspective, future studies should focus on the hybrid form of\nengagement as well as on finding better explanations to account for the volunteering of\nyoung people. Regarding the hybrid category, we had only cautious and exploratory\nexpectations concerning determinants and size of this category. Our finding that the two\ntheoretical explanations (reinforcement and mobilization) converge in this hybrid form\nof engagement shall inspire future research and contribute to theory building regarding\nthe determinants of this comprehensive form of volunteering. Moreover, our results\ndemonstrate the limits of the CVM in explaining volunteering, especially for youngsters.\nPutting a stronger emphasis on psychological underpinnings of volunteering, such as\npersonality traits or motivational aspects, might contribute to a more encompassing\nunderstanding of volunteering online and offline. Since personality is related to Internet\nusage (see Amichai-Hamburger and Hayat, 2013), psychological factors might also be\nrelevant to characterize online volunteers. Recent research on volunteering in general\n(Ackermann, 2018), as well as more specific work on Wikipedia contributors, demon-\nstrates how personality can be accounted for in research on volunteering offline and/or\nonline (Amichai-Hamburger et al., 2008; Rafaeli and Ariel, 2008). In conclusion, more\nresearch, empirical evidence, and theoretical reflection are needed to guarantee that our\nunderstanding and conception of volunteering are not outdated, but moves with the\ntimes. Our study is a first step in this direction and might be interpreted as a sign of hope\nfor those who worry about the future of volunteering in a digital world. Offline volun-\nteers seem to be willing to combine their engagement with online volunteering. What is\nmore, online volunteering may even mobilize different people and thus remedy existing\ninequalities in volunteering. Volunteering in a digital world might become more socially\nequal because online volunteering is able to attract people with a profile different from\noffline volunteers, especially in terms of resources and networks.\n"
