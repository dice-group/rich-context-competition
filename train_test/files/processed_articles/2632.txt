Hamby, PhD\nRates of violent crime have declined in the United States\nsince the mid-1990s.1 This decline includes violent\ncrimes, property crimes, and sex crimes.2-4 Children\nmay also have benefitted from these trends. For example, rates\nof physical and sexual abuse substantiated by child protec-\nsured by self-report surveys such as the National Crime Vic-\ntimization Survey, also declined substantially from the mid-\n1990s onward.7 Surveys of bullying and school violence have\nshown similar large drops.8\nWe recently released a report that presented incidence es-\ntimates for a wide range of childhood exposures to violence\nand victimization for 2011 based on a national survey of chil-\ndren and caregivers.9 Although that report looked at short-\nterm changes since 2008, we also have the ability to look at\nchanges during a longer period, since 2003.\nWe have completed 3 comprehensive national surveys of\n2011, which all used similar methods and questionnaires. Al-\nthough we have reported some of the shorter-term changes in\nvictimization rates,9 we have not previously analyzed the\nchangesoverthelongerperiod,norhaveweanalyzedthetrends\nby demographic subgroups to see whether the changes may\nhaveaffectedchildrendifferentially.Wehavealsoaddedanaly-\nses of perpetration rates to compare with victimization trends.\nMethods\nParticipants\nThis analysis draws on 3 similarly designed national tele-\nphone surveys: The Developmental Victimization Survey\n(2003)10 and the National Survey of Children's Exposure to Vio-\nIMPORTANCE The study suggests that years of public policy designed to reduce the burden of\nviolence and victimization among youths is having some success.\nOBJECTIVE To identify trends in children's exposure to violence, crime, and abuse from 2003\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Three national telephone surveys of representative\nusing the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire; samples included parents of children 2 to 9\nEXPOSURES Direct and indirect experiences of violence, abuse, and victimization during the\nprevious year.\nRESULTS Of 50 trends in exposure examined, there were 27 significant declines and no\nsignificant increases between 2003 and 2011. Declines were particularly large for assault\nvictimization, bullying, and sexual victimization. There were also significant declines in the\nperpetration of violence and property crime. For the recession period between 2008 and\n2011, there were 11 significant declines and no increases for 50 specific trends examined.\nDating violence declined, as did one form of sexual victimization and some forms of indirect\nexposure.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Victimization surveys with general population samples\nconfirm patterns seen in police data and adult surveys.

User on 11/20/2015\n \ntion of the design for all 3 studies was a nationwide sampling\nframe of residential telephone numbers from which a sample\nofhouseholdswasdrawnbyrandomdigitdialing.TheNatSCEV\nI was supplemented with oversamples of households in areas\nwith high concentrations of minorities and low-income fami-\nlies, and the NatSCEV II was supplemented with 2 additional\nsamples, a random digit dialing of cell phones, and an address-\nbased sample9 to represent the growing number of house-\nholds that rely entirely or mostly on cell phones. Although the\nNatSCEV I and II had information on children and youth aged\n1 month through 17 years, because the Developmental Victim-\nization Survey had information only on children and youth\naged 2 to 17 years, this more restricted age group was the ba-\nsisofcomparisonamongthesurveys,yieldingsamplesof2030,\nProcedure\nIn all 3 surveys, a short interview was conducted with an adult\ncaregiver (usually a parent) to obtain family demographic in-\nformation. One child was then randomly selected from all eli-\ngible children living in a household by selecting the child with\nthe most recent birthday. If the selected child was 10 to 17 years\nold, the main telephone interview was conducted with the\nchild. If the selected child was younger than 10, the interview\nwas conducted with the caregiver who \"is most familiar with\nthe child's daily routine and experiences.\"\nRespondentswerepromisedcompleteconfidentiality,pro-\nvided oral informed consent, and were paid $20 for their par-\nticipation. Respondents who disclosed a situation of serious\nthreat or ongoing victimization were recontacted by a clinical\nmember of the research team, trained in telephone crisis coun-\nseling, whose responsibility was to stay in contact with the re-\nspondent until the situation was appropriately addressed lo-\ncally. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the\ninstitutional review board at the University of New Hampshire.\nMeasurement\nVictimization\nAll 3 surveys used versions of the Juvenile Victimization Ques-\ntionnaire, an inventory of childhood victimization described\nin detail elsewhere.12 The 3 versions of this questionnaire dif-\nfered slightly because survey questions were added and de-\nletedovertime.However,nearlyallitemscommontothe3ver-\nsions retained identical wording over time, and items were\nasked in the same order in all 3 surveys. Specific items reflect-\ning the events are included in eAppendix 1, and definitions of\ntherescoredandaggregatevictimizationsineAppendix2,both\nintheSupplement.Althoughinformationwasobtainedonlife-\ntime exposure to each victimization type, the trend analysis\nwas conducted only on exposures that occurred in the past\nyear.Thisisbecauselifetimeexposureislesssensitivefordocu-\nmenting trends. Moreover, official data documenting trends\nare typically reported as a single-year incidence.\nDelinquency\nThe 3 surveys also asked children and youth whether they had\nengagedinspecifictypesofdelinquentbehaviorinthepastyear.\nFor these analyses, 2 binary variables measuring violent delin-\nquency and property delinquency were created for respon-\ndents 6 years or older from 7 items common to the 3 surveys.\nDemographics\nDemographic information was obtained in the initial parent\ninterview, including the child's sex, age (in years), race/\nethnicity (coded into 4 groups: white non-Hispanic, black non-\nHispanic, other race non-Hispanic, and Hispanic any race), so-\ncioeconomicstatus(SES),andfamilystructure.Socioeconomic\nstatus is a composite based on the sum of the standardized an-\nnual household income and standardized parental education\n(for the parent with the highest education) scores, which was\nthen re-standardized. Family structure was categorized into\n3groups:childrenlivingwith(1)twobiologicaloradoptivepar-\nents, (2) a biological parent plus partner (spouse or non-\nspouse), or (3) a single biological parent or other adult care-\ngiver. Region refers to the census region (Northeast, Midwest,\nSouth, or West) where the child lives.\nWe used these demographic variables in two ways: (1) to\ncontrol for the possibility that changing demographic compo-\nsition of the 2- to 17-year-old US population might be respon-\nsible for changes in rates of children's exposure to violence and\n(2) to determine whether trends in exposure to violence are\nspecific to certain demographic subgroups or regions of the\ncountry.\nWeighting\nEach sample used weights to make it nationally representa-\ntive of the population in the year of the survey by correcting\nfor sample-population differences in race/ethnicity, age, and\nhousehold income and for the differential probability of se-\nlection within households.\nStatistical Analysis\nTo facilitate comparing rates across time, comparable vari-\nables were first created in 3 separate data sets and then merged\ninto a single pooled data file. Estimated rates were calculated\nby year using Stata 13 (StataCorp). Differences in rates be-\ntween years were tested for significance using Stata's \"lin-\ncom\" post-estimation command. Rates were compared be-\noverall rates are shown as point changes in Table 1 and Table 2.\nSecond, logistic regression models were used to test\nwhether changes in overall rates were significant while con-\ntrolling for demographic factors. Logistic regression models\nwere tested with each victimization and delinquency type as\nthe dependent variable, demographic variables as control vari-\nables, and dummy variables for year. Odds ratios from these\nregressions were used to derive percentage changes in rates\nwhich are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Finally, comparisons were\nmadetodetermineifsubgroupsdifferedintheirchangesacross\ntime. Interaction terms for subgroup by year were added to the\nregressionmodelsinthesecondanalysis,with1subgroupomit-\nted in each regression as the reference group. Significant sub-\ngroup-by-year interaction terms indicated that the difference\nbetween the change for 1 group and the change for the refer-\nence group was significant.\nTrends in Children's Exposure to Violence Original Investigation Research\n \nDownloaded From: http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc.

Since 2008, both violent delin-\nquency and property delinquency rates also declined\n(Table 2).\nWe also conducted analyses to study whether the trends\nwere specific to certain demographic subgroups of children.\nFew trends were specific to demographic subgroups, and\nonly the categories and types of victimization with some sig-\nyouth (aged 10-17 years) had significantly larger declines than\ndid younger children (aged 2-9 years) for assault with no\nweapon or injury (P = .004) and attempted assault (P = .01).\nCompared with children and youth from families with\nmedium and high SES, those from families with low SES had\nsignificantly larger declines in overall maltreatment (low vs\nemotional abuse (low vs medium SES, P = .01; low vs high\nSES, P = .001) Children from families with stepparents had a\nsignificantly larger decline in overall maltreatment than chil-\ndren from 2-parent families (P = .02).

Of 50\nspecific trends examined, 27 showed significant declines, with\nno significant increases. Declines were particularly large for\nrates of physical assault, physical intimidation, and sexual vic-\ntimization. The declines in victimization were validated, as\nmightbeexpected,bydropsinyouthperpetrationratesaswell.\nThis certainly suggests that the decline seen for crime in gen-\neral applies to children and youth.\nThe recession era that started in 2008 did not seem to\nreverse downward trends, although there were fewer signifi-\ncant declines detectable during this shorter period from\nexamined. Assault rates continued to decline, as did rates for\none form of sexual victimization and some forms of indirect\nexposure. Perpetration of violence and property offenses\ncontinued to decline. This suggests that although the reces-\nsion may have caused much hardship, it did not translate\ninto more violence and crime exposure for children and\nyouth.\nThis finding is consistent with other evidence. The\nNational Crime Victimization Survey showed continuing\npost-2008 declines in violent crime and property crime expo-\nsure among youth.7,8,13 In addition, rates for substantiated\nfor sexual abuse.5 Police reports of crime and homicide also\ndropped.\nVictimization Type\nAge Group, y Socioeconomic Status Family Structure Sex\nParent and\nStepparent\nor Partner\nSingle Parent\nor Other\nCaregiver Female Male\nMaltreatment\na Values represent point changes across time.

Our data suggest that they have oc-\ncurred for boys and girls and for children of all races, in all re-\ngions, and in cities and nonurban areas. However, some dif-\nferentials were noteworthy. The declines in assaults were\nsignificantly larger for teens than for younger children, al-\nthough they occurred for both. The declines in maltreatment\nhad some differential strength among low-SES and steppar-\nent families.\nSome caveats about our findings are warranted. First, even\nwith our large samples, the confidence intervals around rate\nestimates are large enough that the exact percentage declines\nare not precise. In addition, some of the categories have very\nfew events, making it difficult to detect change, especially in\nthe analysis of subcategories such as sex, SES, or family struc-\nture.Second,thefindingsdonotapplytochildrenyoungerthan\n2 years, and there are some indications from other studies that\ntrends in this group might differ from trends for other chil-\ndren. Third, we cannot exclude the possibility that some meth-\nodologic artifact, for example, the shifts from landline to cell\nphone use, may explain some of the trends. However, paral-\nlel trends in agency and police data as well as in surveys con-\nducted in school environments make it less likely that meth-\nodologic differences explain the declines.\nWhat might account for these trends? Demographic fac-\ntors do not seem to account for the overall decline. The de-\nclines held when age, SES, racial composition, family struc-\nture, and region were controlled for.\nOther factors would be worth investigating as possible\nsources of these declines but are beyond the analytic re-\nsources of this study. One may be the growth and dissemina-\ntion of prevention and intervention strategies aimed at reduc-\ning youth violence and victimization. Anecdotal information\nsuggests that a variety of programs have been widely dissemi-\nnated before and during our study period. These include\nschool-based prevention programs targeting bullying, inter-\npersonal conflict, and sexual and dating violence--some of\nwhich have been effective in rigorous evaluation studies.16-19\nThedisseminatedprogramsalsoincludefamilypreventionand\nintervention strategies that have shown effectiveness in re-\nducing child maltreatment and delinquent behavior, includ-\ningparentingeducationprograms.20-25 Someofthemostwidely\ndisseminated programs, such as home visitation, have been\ndifferentially effective with low-income families,23 consis-\ntent with the findings from our data. The programs include law\nenforcement mobilization to reduce youth violence and vic-\ntimization, including school resource officers.\nOne potentially relevant intervention has been the grow-\ning use of psychiatric medication among youth and adults.26,27\nof children and youth were taking such medication, to 2011,\nwhen the rate was 7.8%. Such medication has been specifi-\ncally targeted at children with aggressive behavior, which\nshowed clear declines in this study. More teens than younger\nchildren receive such medication, consistent with our find-\ning about differential declines for older youth. Medication use\nhas also expanded for adults with depression and anxiety, per-\nhaps resulting in less intrafamily conflict and better parent-\ning and child supervision.\nAnother possible factor in reducing youth violence\nexposure and delinquency is the growth of electronic tech-\nnology and communication. As youth socialize and commu-\nnicate electronically, they may be spending less time in face-\nto-face contact situations where assaults and violence can\noccur.28,29 Youth may also be doing more of their risk taking\nand independence testing online, which may provide some\nsafeguards against immediate physical exposure to violence.\nThe engrossing quality of the Internet may also have under-\ncut some of the boredom and alienation among youth that\nhave in the past been associated with delinquency and\ncriminal pursuits.28,30 Electronic media use has grown par-\nticularly dramatically among blacks and Hispanics in recent\nyears.30 At the same time, when children and youth do get\ninto threatening situations, cell phone technology now\naffords them a way of summoning help or recording misbe-\nhavior, which may act as a deterrent.31,32\nThe issue of whether and how economic conditions may\napply to youth violence exposure needs more investigation.\nOurfindingsandthoseofotherresearch,however,suggestthat\nthe link may be less strong than is sometimes assumed. It is\ntrue that some of the largest declines in youth violence and\nvictimizationoccurredinthemid-1990satatimeofstrongeco-\nnomic growth and economic optimism,33 but declines have\ncontinued when economic conditions turned negative. Re-\nview articles on the effect of economic cycles on crime have\ngenerally concluded that the effect is questionable and better\nsupported for property crime than for violent crime.34\nMore media and policy attention to declines in youth vio-\nlence and exposure is important for several reasons. It is im-\nportant to buffer widely held assumptions (often derived from\nhigh-profile media stories, such as those on school shoot-\nings, Internet predators, or bullying-related suicides) that vio-\nlence and abuse are on the rise, along with the facile blaming\nof easy targets, such as video games, the Internet, funding cut-\nbacks, parental laxness, and insufficient criminal penalties.\nFeatures of social change may have negative effects, but evi-\ndence for such effects cannot be derived from invoking claims\nabout worsening exposure to violence.\nFocusing attention on the declines may also help us to bet-\nterunderstandwhatmaybeeffectiveinpreventingviolenceand\nResearch Original Investigation Trends in Children's Exposure to Violence\n \nDownloaded From: http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc.

Although evaluations of spe-\ncific prevention programs are the most conclusive for guiding\nprevention strategy, studies comparing local policy environ-\nmentsandtheirassociationwithviolencetrendscouldbehelp-\nfulinprovidingfeedbackaboutthevalueofvariouspolicymixes.\nEpidemiologic studies addressing specific hypotheses, such as\nthe effects of psychiatric medication or cell phones, may pro-\nvide guidance for the development of more specific programs\nto increase the positive influence of such social changes.\nConclusions\nThe public health field has clearly demonstrated the value of\ngood epidemiologic data for managing and reducing a variety\nof health problems. Unfortunately, the need for such data has\nreceived less recognition in the fields of crime and child\nabuse. Given the considerable public concern and policy\nactivity in these areas, however, high-quality epidemiologic\ndata should be a top priority. This should include more com-\nprehensive and regular assessments of many childhood\nexposures that are still poorly measured, including sexual\nabuse (particularly sexual abuse by teachers and coaches),\nneglect, bullying, and child abductions. Our current findings\nillustrate the value of tracking trends, but our study was not\nlarge enough for detecting changes in low-base-rate expo-\nsures. More work is also needed to refine measurement and\nassess the percentages of child survivors of violence who are\nor are not coming to the attention of physicians, educators,\ntherapists, or law enforcement officials.\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Finkelhor and Ms\nShattuck had full access to all the data in the study\nand take responsibility for the integrity of the data\nand the accuracy of the data analysis.\nStudy concept and design: Finkelhor, Turner, Hamby.\nAcquisition of data: Finkelhor, Turner.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Finkelhor,\nShattuck, Hamby,\nDrafting of the manuscript: Finkelhor, Shattuck.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important\nintellectual content: Finkelhor, Turner, Hamby.\nStatistical analysis: Shattuck.\nObtained funding: Finkelhor, Turner.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support:\nFinkelhor, Turner.\nStudy supervision: Finkelhor, Turner.\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nFunding/Support: For the purposes of compliance\n\"Stevens Amendment\"), readers are advised that\nfunding was derived from multiple sources,\nincluding the Office of Juvenile Justice and\nDelinquency Prevention and the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention.
