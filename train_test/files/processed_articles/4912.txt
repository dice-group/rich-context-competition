    "abstract": "Abstract\nPatients suffering from chronic pain such as fibromyalgia (FM) not only experience change in their physical bodies but\nalso in their embodiment. There are two forms of disturbed body awareness (BA), namely, \"disembodiment\" and \"hyper-\nembodiment.\" This study describes how patients with FM experience their body and whether there is a difference in BA with\nor without alexithymia. Based on two self-report questionnaires (Toronto Alexithymia Scale [TAS]-20 and Hospital Anxiety\nand Depression Scale [HADS]), a purposeful sample of FM patients with and without alexithymia was included. Two focus\ngroups were conducted with nine alexithymic and six nonalexithymic FM patients and were analyzed by a Interpretative\nPhenomenological Analysis. Body experience appeared in two themes: \"the lived body as hyper present\" and \"alienation\nfrom the lived body.\" A third theme emerged as \"the lived body in interaction with others\" and indicates the importance\nof the interpersonal aspect of BA. We found no differences regarding BA between the alexithymic and nonalexithymic\npatients. These results suggest that BA in FM patients cannot exclusively be classified under the constructs of hyper- or\ndisembodiment. The authors suggest to consider embodiment in FM, subjected to intra- as well as interindividual influences,\nas a dimensional construct whereby the equilibrium tends to hyper-embodiment. Still, a temporary shift of this equilibrium\nfrom hyper- to disembodiment due to certain emotional state or stress is possible. As alexithymia had no influence on the\ndescription of BA, it seems that FM patients primarily fail to express their BA without in fact being disembodied.\n",

Together with\nbodily symptoms, patients with MUS often show a lack of\nself-confidence and trust in their body (Gyllensten et al.,\n2010). Despite high medical consumption behavior and cor-\nresponding attention, MUS patients do not often recover\n(Smith et al., 2005). This can be due to the health care system\nwhere there is a strong tendency to conceptualize the body as\nan objective, pure physical body and to interpret symptoms\nas an underlying biological dysfunction (Bullington, 2009).\nYet, for a therapist, it seems to be important to not merely\npay attention to the physical or objective body of the patient\nbut also to the subjective or experienced body (Bullington,\nAccording to the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty, the\nbody is simultaneously objective and subjective.

The concept used by\nMerleau-Ponty to describe this human experience of having\nand being a body at the same time, is called \"embodiment.\"\nEmbodiment conceptualizes the body as a dynamic, organic\nplace of meaningful experience rather than a physical object\ndistinct from the self or the mind (Mehling et al., 2011).\nFibromyalgia (FM) is part of a broad category of \"func-\ntional somatic symptoms\" (FSS) or MUS (Kanaan, Lepine,\ndiagnostic criteria, FM was characterized--in addition to the\nsensitivity on at least 11 of 18 tender points--by chronic\n1University Hasselt, Belgium\n2Hospital ZOL Limburg, Dept of Psychiatry, Belgium\nCorresponding Author:\nJoeri Calsius, Faculty Medicine and Life Science, Reval Research Center,\nUniversity Hasselt, Martelarenlaan, 3500 Hasselt, Belgium.\nEmail: joeri.calsius@uhasselt.be\nHow Do Fibromyalgia Patients With\nAlexithymia Experience Their Body?

Recently, the criteria have\nbeen adapted with less emphasis on tender points (Wolfe,\n2010). Patients with FM also report symptoms of fatigue,\nsleep disorders, stiffness and cognitive dysfunctions (Sarzi-\nPatients suffering chronic pain such as FM not only experi-\nence changes in their physical body but also in their embodi-\nment (Wilde, 2003). In general psychiatry, there are two\nforms of disturbed body awareness described in relation to\n(chronic) pain, namely \"disembodiment\" and \"hyper-\nembodiment.\" Disembodiment refers to an individual who is\nnot connected with his or her body. In case of hyper-embodi-\nment, the person is totally immersed in pain (Wilde, 2003).\nIn this state of hyper-embodiment, psychological experi-\nences are experienced as \"too real.\" Such concrete thinking\nmakes psychological pain being felt as physical pain (Luyten\n& Fonagy, 2011). However, in a state of hyper-embodiment,\nthe body can also be experienced as very pleasant, comfort-\nable, and as a source of pleasure (Zeiler, 2010). In literature,\nhyper- and disembodiment are already described in the con-\ntext of respectively, melancholic depression and schizophre-\ncharacteristics of both concepts according to Fuchs and\nSchlimme (2009). In addition, chronic pain not only has a\nnegative influence on the perception of the self but also on\nthe experiential world in which the individual lives (Afrell et\nAlexithymia is a personality trait that is characterized by\ndifficulties in recognizing, differentiating, and verbalizing\nemotional states, by an externally oriented cognitive style and\npoor fantasy. Literally, alexithymia means \"no words for feel-\nings.\" Related to these central features, the alexithymic indi-\nvidual is thought to be characterized by a disembodied state\nof being in the world, unable to contact with his body and the\nbodily or emotional state he is in, which in turn could be\nrelated to poor mentalization capacity (Maclaren, 2006;\nconsidered as a continuous or dimensional trait, which is also\nfound in general population, and is studied in relation to\nMUS. Important to note is that alexithymia is not considered\na disorder itself, nor is it typical for a specific disorder\n(Lumley et al., 2007). Alexithymia is rather seen as a person-\nality trait that is associated with a higher vulnerability to men-\ntal disorders, mainly depression and anxiety (Leweke\nmon comorbidities in MUS (Castelli et al., 2012; Henningsen\nFM has not yet been described in terms of hyper- or dis-\nembodiment. Taking into account the characteristics of\nhyper- and disembodiment (as described in Table 1), a num-\nber of studies have explored the \"lived experience\" in FM\nally describes both concepts. Characteristics that endorse\nhyper-embodiment are the lived body that becomes dis-\nrupted, apprehended as a physical entity and experienced as\ndescribed as an obstacle, a barrier that prevents access to the\nworld (idem); completely absorbed by the pain, the body is\npain (R\u00e5heim & H\u00e5land, 2006). Related to disembodiment,\nthe following characteristics are present: the body is experi-\nenced at a distance and the body as an alien presence impos-\nsible to control (idem).\nThe primary purpose of the study is to describe how FM\npatients experience their body. Secondly, possible differ-\nences between body awareness in FM patients with and with-\nout alexithymia are explored. The objective is to understand\nthe meaningful experience of the body in FM patients and\nnot to search for a causal relationship.\nMethod\nA phenomenological-hermeneutic approach, namely, the\nInterpretative Phenomenological Analysis or IPA was used\nfor this study as phenomenology emphasizes the immediacy\nof experience and not the measurability of reality as such\nTable 1.

The primary concern of IPA is with how\nindividuals experience phenomena and the psychological\ninterpretations of these experiences. This study was approved\nby the ethics committee of the Hospital Zuid Oost-Limburg\nGenk, in collaboration with the ethics committee of the\nUniversity of Hasselt.\nMeasurements Sampling Strategy\nThe 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) is a self-\nreport scale that contains 20 items, divided into three sub-\nscales: (a) difficulties in identifying feelings (DIF), (b)\ndifficulties in describing feelings (DDF), and (c) externally\noriented thinking (EOT). The TAS-20 has been translated\ninto 18 languages. The Dutch version also shows strong psy-\nchometric properties (Kooiman et al., 2002; Tayloret al.,\n2003). Cutoff points were used to label patients as nonalex-\nithymic (sum score  51) and alexithymic (sum score  61).\nLevels of anxiety and depression were measured with the\nHospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). This ques-\ntionnaire contains two subscales, a seven-item depression\nscale (HADS-D) and a seven-item anxiety scale (HADS-A).\nFor both subscales, scores 8 indicate a possible depression\nor anxiety disorder (Snaith & Zigmond, 1994). The HADS is\nseen as a valid and reliable tool in assessing the symptom\nseverity of anxiety disorders and depression in a healthy,\nsomatic, psychiatric, and primary care patient population\nalso shows good psychometric properties.\nPopulation\nThe population was selected with a purposeful sampling\nstrategy. This sampling strategy was directed toward FM\npatients with both high and low scores for alexithymia. Other\nvariables, such as sociodemographic data and the number of\nyears since diagnosis, were allowed to differ. Figure 1 shows\nthe recruitment process. The FM patients were recruited in\n\"Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg\" (ZOL) in Belgium (Genk) and\nin 10 different physical therapist practices. A total of 75 self-\nreport questionnaires (TAS-20 and HADS) were distributed,\nwhich the patients had to return to the researchers. The\nresponse rate was 40%. Based on this, patients were selected\npatients who scored low--that is, a score of 51--on the\nTAS-20 (n = 7)--were also selected. The selected patients\nwere contacted by phone to ask for their willingness to par-\nticipate in a focus group. Nine alexithymic and five nonalex-\nithymic patients gave permission. Finally, four patients with\na score of 53 on the TAS-20 were contacted and agreed to\nparticipate. These four patients were classified in the non-\nalexithymic group. In this last group, three participants did\nnot show up.\nAll participants were women diagnosed with FM (accord-\ning to the American College of Rheumatology [ACR] crite-\nria). The mean age was 43 years in the nonalexithymic group\nand 46 years in the alexithymic group. The number of years\nsince diagnosis ranged from 1 to 11 years (mean = 8.5 years)\nin the nonalexithymic group and from 2 to 20 years (mean =\n5.8 years) in the alexithymic group. The results from the two\nquestionnaires are shown in Table 2. The average anxiety\nand depression scores for the alexithymic patients were situ-\nated above the cutoff score (i.e., 8). The average HADS-\nscore of 12.7 for anxiety and 13 for depression indicate a\nmoderate depressive disorder and a moderate anxiety disor-\nis a moderate anxiety disorder present in the nonalexithymic\ngroup but no depressive disorders. In another study in which\nthe HADS is conducted in a sample of 301 FM patients, the\ndepression scale (Vallejo et al., 2012).\nData Collection\nFocus groups were used as they are well suited for producing\nbroad information on patients' perceptions, feelings,\nthoughts, and experiences about the selected topics. The\npower of the focus group is situated in the interaction\nFigure 1. Flowchart recruitment process.\nNote. FM refers to FM patients. FM = fibromyalgia; TAS = Toronto Alexithymia Scale.\n4 SAGE Open\nbetween respondents and in identifying their feelings and\nmotives. As the interview takes place in a group setting, the\ndata are strongly dependent on the interaction between the\nparticipants (Howitt, 2013). Both focus groups were guided\nby the same experienced moderator who used a semi-struc-\ntured interview (see appendix). Each focus group had an\naverage duration of 60 minutes and was audiotaped and tran-\nscribed verbatim. All participants gave written informed\nconsent and were assured of anonymity and confidentiality.\nData Analysis\nThe process of data analysis involved a typical pattern of\nopen coding, axial coding, and identifying themes and sub-\nthemes (see Appendix Table A1). First, the interview tran-\nscripts were read several times to become familiar with the\ndata. During the open encoding, texts were broken down into\ndiscrete parts, which form a meaningful whole and were\nlabeled. Axial encoding involves connecting these open\ncodes and creating a concept (i.e. a description of related\ncodes). Finally, the concepts were grouped in themes and\nsubthemes (Howitt, 2013). Results were continuously com-\npared with literature and adjusted during analysis. Two inde-\npendent researchers analyzed data and discussed on themes\nand subthemes. In case of different interpretation, a third\nexperienced clinician was consulted (triangulation).\nTheoretical saturation was not reached.\nResults\nDescriptions on how the included FM patients experience\ntheir body can be classified into three themes: the lived body\nis hyper present, alienation of the lived body, and the lived\nbody in interaction with others. These themes are presented\nbelow, along with corresponding subthemes (see Table 3 for\nan overview).\nTheme 1: The Lived Body Is Hyper Present\nThe theme, \"the lived body is hyper present\" was constructed\nfrom the following subthemes: (a) an actual, present physical\nbody; (b) living in a painful world; and (c) feeling of having\na heavy body.\nAn actual, present physical body indicates a body that\nbecomes apprehended as a biological entity. The entire body,\nfrom the tip of the finger to little toe, appears on the fore-\nground in the subjective experience of the patient.\nAny piece of my trunk hurts. It is like an inflammation, as if all\nmy nerves are exposed.\nBefore diagnosis or onset of symptoms, the body was\npresent without being aware of it. Participants described this\nas an \"obvious and fluent body,\" which can be defined as an\ninvisible embodied body or a body at the background of\nattention.\nLiving in a painful world indicates the impact of chronic\npain and associated fatigue. Activities of daily life, such as\ncooking, ironing and cleaning, can no longer be performed\neffortlessly. Climbing stairs, for example, becomes the focus\nof the attention.\nIn going up or down the stairs at home, now I should pull myself\nup to the railing, step by step.\nThe feeling of having a heavy body means that the body is\nexperienced as a weight that has to be dragged. The partici-\npants described this as if their body always remains a few\nsteps behind, as if the body cannot follow the mind.\nBefore I had no idea of my body. Although it was there, I just got\nup, did all I had to do throughout the day. And now I get up and\nI need to drag myself out of that bed and drag myself day after\nday.\nTheme 2: Alienation of the Lived Body\nThe feeling of having a heavy body is described by another\nparticipant as follows:\nTable 3. Overview of Themes and Subthemes.\nTheme Subtheme\nThe lived body is hyper present Actual, present physical\nbody\n Living in a painful world\n Feeling of having a heavy\nbody\nAlienation from the lived body The body as a machine\n The alienated body\nThe lived body in interaction\nwith others\nOpen attitude\nClosed attitude\nTable 2.

TAS = Toronto Alexithymia Scale; HADS = Hospital Anxiety and\nDepression Scale; DIF = difficulty identifying feelings; DDF = difficulty\ndescribing feelings; EOT = externally oriented thinking; HADS-A =\nHADS-anxiety; HADS-D = HADS-depression.\nCalsius et al. 5\nI feel like I'm riding with a Ferrari to a mountaintop: a lot of\naccelerating, but not moving forward. It's as if you're driving\nwith the brakes on.\nThis mechanical expression is in line with the theme\n\"alienation from the lived body.\" Here, we can distinguish\ntwo subthemes: (a) the body as a machine and (b) the alien-\nated body.\nThe body as a machine refers to mechanical descriptions\nof the body. The body is seen as a \"faltering machine\" or a\n\"car that is used up.\" Something does not work properly any-\nmore and should be restored by the therapist.\nThere is something blocked in my body and because of this I\nhave more pain. This should be mobilized or loosened.\nThe alienated body refers to a body that is experienced as\n\"not mine.\" The body that I am is different than it used to be\nbefore the onset of symptoms.\nThat's another body, that's no longer my body, that's no longer\nme.\nTheme 3: The Lived Body in Interaction With\nOthers\nThe third theme, \"the lived body in interaction with others\"\nrefers to the importance of interindividual aspect of body\nawareness. Although both themes, \"the lived body is hyper\npresent\" and \"alienation of the lived body,\" concern the indi-\nvidual experience of the body, these data suggest a remark-\nable influence of the interactions with significant others.\nThis is surprising as in literature more focus is placed on\nintraindividual aspects such as cognition (e.g., Gard, 2005)\nand proprio- or interoceptive processing (e.g., Cameron,\npants report that the physical complaint in itself is not the\nproblem but its consequencesfor their daily interactions with\nothers are. The feeling of being judged and having to defend\nthemselves because their illness is \"medically unexplain-\nable\" seems to influence their bodily experience to large\nextent. The present data suggest that people with FM are\nconstantly looking for an optimal coping between how they\nwant to express themselves and how they think they should\nbehave.\nOn the one hand, they want to adopt an open attitude in\ninteraction with others. They try to be single-hearted and\nbrave while indicating what they are able to and where they\nfeel limited. Although this is often not the case, they want to\nbe understood, seen, and heard. Therefore, they consider it\nessential to be able to express how they experience their\ndaily life and not to hide their feelings of tiredness as well as\njoy from others. This expressing and not hiding is also and\neven foremost experienced on a bodily level where \"standing\nup\" literally is about feeling strong legs to stand on and hav-\ning a firm look while interacting with people.\nI have learned to express myself to other people. This is who\nI am, these are my limits, this is what I can do, I can have a\nmeeting in the morning, but not the same day also in the\nevening, I can function like this and I keep on doing it this\nway.\nBefore I always pretended--although feeling small--but now I\njust look and say it and it's the other one who should adapt. Why\nshould it always be me who must fit in?\nSince I've been power training, my stance has changed\ndramatically and it is as if my legs are rooted in plain ground\nnow . . . once I had an argument with a colleague and I really felt\nthat I was standing strong!\nOn the other hand, they express that others should not\nalways notice (e.g., \"everyone should see that I am going\nwell\") or understand them (e.g., \"there is nothing to see, peo-\nple can't understand\"). This is what makes them actually\nprefer not to talk about their situation anymore, indicating a\nclosed attitude. In addition, a private space in which one\nfeels safe seems to be important. This can be obtained by\nretreating in a personal \"cocoon\" or by isolating themselves\ncompletely from the environment.\nI feel most secure when I would be alone on an island. That\nseems a safe situation.\nOccasionally I need to sit down in my couch, under a blanket,\nwearing my pajamas. Then, others may not sit on my couch.\nThat is my place. Actually I live in my own territory, my own\nspace. I accept who I want to, when I want to.\nI'm tired of constantly having to explain myself, it makes me so\ntired, I feel so exhausted in my body.\nMy husband knows when he has to leave me alone for a while\n. . . the only thing I can bear at that moment is my body around\nme.\nThe behavior or responsiveness of the environment also\nseems to be an important factor affecting the physical symp-\ntoms of the patient. Little understanding, not being seen or\nheard by significant others results in more stress and contrib-\nutes to an increase of the physical complaints.\nPeople don't understand that you want to. They say you're lazy\nor trying to attract some attention. Thereby I feel more stressed,\nand I am doing less well.\nWhen my husband or kids are at home, I'm trying real hard not\nto sigh or moan, I even walk taller as when my father told me\nwhen I was young to be a big girl.\nAlexithymia\nThe themes and subthemes are applicable to both the\nalexithymic and nonalexithymic group. The personality trait\n6 SAGE Open\nalexithymia had no influence on how these FM patients\nexperience their body. Based on the qualitative analysis,\nsome differences can nevertheless be noticed: verbal reac-\ntions indicating a lack of mentalization, experiencing more\nmisunderstanding from the environment and preferring\nexercise therapy to a touch-based therapy are more present\nin the alexithymic group in comparison with the nonalex-\nithymic group. These differences are described and illus-\ntrated below.\nA first difference with the nonalexithymic group is the\nlimited ability to express the inner world of feelings, emo-\ntions, and mainly focussing on physical sensations. Verbal\nreactions indicating a lack of body mentalizationare no\nwords, empty words, body absolutism, and emphasis on\nphysical labels (Table 4).\nThey also indicate the need to be heard, seen, and under-\nstood by the environment. Just because they fail to express\ntheir inner world and to indicate their limits, they experience\nmore misunderstanding from the environment in comparison\nwith the nonalexithymic group.\nI can't say what I feel, I can only say that I have pain at the\nmoment. So for someone else in your environment, it's even\nmore difficult. They can't estimate that at all, if I can't even\ndescribe how I feel.\nWhereas the nonalexithymic FM patients prefer the com-\nbination of hands-on therapy and psychotherapy, the FM\npatients with alexithymic characteristics prefer exercise ther-\napyto a therapy in which touch is central. According to them,\nthe advice and guidance of the psychotherapist offers little\nprogress (e.g., \"After all, we have to do it all by ourselves\"),\nwhereas movement-based therapy seems to have a more suit-\nable treatment objective. They focus a lot on stabilizing their\ncomplaints, on recovery, and improvement of their quality of\nlife without being dependent on others, in this case the\ntherapist.\nMy physical therapist teaches me things I can do by myself. This\nis important, knowing I am not dependent on someone else.\nDiscussion\nBased on the qualitative data analysis, these FM patients\nshow characteristics of hyper-embodiment as well as disem-\nbodiment. Patients' experiences suggested a lived body,\nexperienced as a heavy body and living in a painful world,\nwhich was thematically clustered as the lived body is hyper\npresent. However, there is an alienation of the lived body,\nbecause the body is described as a machine and as strange,\nnot belonging to the individual. This specific phenomeno-\nlogical experience of not being one's own body could be in\nline with the paradoxical experience of being in pain while\nnot feeling it as described by Valenzuela-Moguillansky\n(2013) in patients with FM. The modification of pain which\nthese authors label as paradoxical, could be referring to a\nprocess of coping by alienating from one's body as in disem-\nbodiment. A kind of experiential distance or filter is created\nbetween the individual and the body, which results in a deaf-\nened effect on the pain. These occurred especially when\npatients were suddenly or intensely confronted with stress as\nin anxiety or panic and could--on a bodily level--be in line\nwith the mechanism of derealization in traumatized people.\nHowever, hyper-embodiment seemed to be more present\nduring normal daily life when patients have to deal with less\nunexpected disturbing arousal. Here they described to be\nabsorbed by their body, experiencing it as a burden or heavy\nweight that has to be dragged.\nThis possibility of the lived body moving back and forth\nis why it is more appropriate to consider embodiment as a\ndimensional construct with hyper- and disembodiment at\neach end of a spectrum (Figure 2). Although, in both condi-\ntions, the body is present in the forefront of the subjective\nexperience, hyper-embodiment is about an oppressing and\nsolid body object, where the patient is trapped in, whereas in\ndisembodiment, the body is an alienated apparatus that can-\nnot be inhabited anymore (Fuchs & Schlimme, 2009). It is\nimportant to emphasize that hyper- and disembodiment also\nhave a normal range and should not be interpreted as patho-\nlogical concepts as such. Typical example here is the fight/\nflight state in which an individual is normally and function-\nally detached from his body awareness to cope with a possi-\nble situation, whereas a sensual massage invites to a more\nintensive aware experience of the body. So to escape or\nenjoy, a normal fluctuation or shift in dis- or hyper-embodied\nstates is needed. The problem, however, with a more dys-\nfunctional appearance of embodiment appears when the nor-\nmal flow on the hyper- and disembodiment spectrum got\nstuck to some level. In that case, the lived body cannot adept\nproperly to any given situation in daily life.\nMoreover, in general health, the lived body is implicitly\npresent in every action (S\u00f6derberg et al., 2002) and so the\nbody \"dis-appears\" from the attention (Zeiler, 2010). Only in\nspecific situations--such as in case of hunger, thirst, desire,\nfatigue, or pain--the body becomes present as a biological\nTable 4. Verbal Reactions Indicating a Lack of Body\nMentalization (According to Spaans, Veselka, Luyten, & B\u00fchring,\nNo words Having no words that fit the inner\nexperience (\"I can't explain what I\nfeel\")\nEmpty words Using stereotype words that seem to\nrefer to a mental state, for example,\n\"Cramped,\" \"Tensed,\" \"Pain\"\nBody absolutism Oversimplified language, such as \"I\nhate my body\"\nEmphasis on physical\nlabels\nTalking about physical labels without\nmentioning their inner experience\nCalsius et al. 7\n2003). Otherwise, attention is not always directed toward the\nbody and, as stated--for example, in acute danger--atten-\ntion is more focused on the environment instead of the body.\nSo an explanation for both the hyper- and disembodied expe-\nriences of the FM patients in this study could be the ability to\nmake a temporarily shift or switch from hyper- to disembodi-\nment due to certain emotional state or stress. Still, the present\ndata suggest that the equilibrium tends to hyper-embodiment\nin FM.\nThe third theme--the lived body in interaction with oth-\ners--is a remarkable interindividual aspect of body aware-\nness. Merleau-Ponty defines this as intercorporeality,\nindicating that the experience to be embodied is always\nmediated by our continuous bodily interaction with others\n(Stanghellini, 2009). Being in the world and interacting with\nothers occurs first and foremost on a bodily level as we con-\ntact as \"body to body,\" mostly on an unconscious level in an\nembodied space. That is why Merleau-Ponty states that inter-\ncorporeality or embodiment is in particular prereflective and\ncanbeseenasakindofunconsciousattunement(Stanghellini,\n2009). This prereflective attunement and body-mediated\nintercorporeality seem to find--at least to some extent--\ntheir neurobiological substrate in mirror neurons as is\nincreasingly demonstrated in literature. Not only higher\norder decision making, language, or cognition in general are\nrooted in the mirror neuron system of a person but also\nembodiment itself is mirror neuron\u00adbased as stated by\nGallese and Ebisch (2013): \"In other words, by exploiting\nthe same neural circuits as those recruited for first-person\nbodily experiences, a direct intersubjective link is estab-\nlished between self and other allowing an experiential under-\nstanding of others bodily feelings\" (p. 279). Focused on\nsocial cognition, this embodied understanding also appears\nin what is called embodied simulation where people are\nthought to reuse their own mental states represented with a\nbodily format in functionally attributing them to others\nThese key notions on the embodied basis of intersubjective\nattunement or evaluation are reflected in the third theme,\nwhere on one hand, the participants want to be understood,\nseen, and heard by their environment (i.e., open attitude). On\nthe other hand, they also state that the environment not often\nunderstands their preference not to speak about themselves\n(i.e., closed attitude). In general, they are confronted with\nmisunderstanding from others. A number of studies attribute\nthis misunderstanding to the invisibility of the symptoms, a\ngeneral lack of knowledge about FM and the perception that\nthe illness is \"psychological\" and therefore not legitimate\n(McMahon et al., 2012). This theme reflects the \"intercorpo-\nreality\" dimension of the lived body, where people not only\ntry to cope on a bodily level with their surrounding by, for\nexample, standing tall and having a firm gaze. But also the\nconsequences of this prereflective and bodily attunement\nappear in this third theme as in \"feeling tired of being\njudged.\" Interesting and striking at the same time is that both\nthe open and closed attitude appear in an embodied way in\ntheir narrative and behavior, for example, when a participant\ntells that the couch where she is sitting on, wrapped in her\nblanket, is her space and territory where her body cannot\nbear anyone close.\nAlexithymia\nBased on literature, the alexithymic individual was thought\nto be characterized by a disembodied state of being in the\nworld. Many theorists have explained alexithymia as a dis-\nconnection between the objective mind and the emotional\nexperienced body, in short, a disconnection between body\nand mind. An alexithymic individual is thereby characterized\nby a lack of emotional involvement in the world. Instead, this\nperson is in an objective and instrumental way involved in\nthe world and seems to be disconnected from his or her body\n(Maclaren, 2006). This was not confirmed by the qualitative\ndata from this study. The way alexithymic FM patients\ndescribe how they experience their body is surprisingly simi-\nlar to these in the nonalexithymic group.Alexithymic patients\nare primarily failing in expressing their bodily experiences\nFigure 2. Embodiment as a dimensional construct.\nFigure made by Calsius J., Courtois I., Stiers J., and De Bie J.\n8 SAGE Open\nwithout actually being disembodied could be a possible\nexplanation.\nCompared with the nonalexithymic group, some differ-\nences could nevertheless be noticed: (a) verbal reactions\npointing to a lack of mentalization, (b) more misunderstand-\ning from the environment, and (c) preferring exercise ther-\napy instead of hands-on therapy. Clinical observations and\ncontrolled studies have confirmed that psychotherapeutic\ntreatments of alexithymic patients are difficult (Vanheule et\nal., 2011). Alexithymia seems a negative prognostic indica-\ntor for many psychological treatments, particularly those\nfocusing on emotional awareness and a close relationship\nwith the therapist (Lumley et al., 2007; Vanheule et al.,\n2011). Behavioral treatments are more appropriate because\nof a more structured, externally oriented and concrete\napproach (Baranowsky et al., 2009). Also mentalization-\nbased therapy may be suitable for alexithymic patients\nimportant to note that therapists not always have to use ver-\nbalization to stimulate the mentalization process. For exam-\nple, body awareness interventions, emphasizing on being\naware of the body without the need to be verbalized, can be\nan option. In this type of interventions, therapists can choose\nto use a hands-on or hands-off approach. The efficacy of\nthese treatment methods in FM patients is still under debate\nConclusion\nIn the literature, authors distinguish two forms of disturbed\nbody awareness: \"disembodiment\" and \"hyper-embodi-\nment.\" These concepts are already described in the context of\nmelancholic depression and schizophrenia. To date, both\nconcepts are not used in the context of FM. This study\ndescribes how FM patients experience their body and\nexplores whether these patients can be categorized in dis- or\nhyper-embodiment).\nCharacteristics of both concepts were established and\nclassified in two themes: the lived body is hyper present\n(hyper-embodiment) and alienation from the lived body (dis-\nembodiment). As both characteristics were present, we can\nconclude that FM patients cannot exclusively be classified in\nhyper- or disembodiment. The phenomenology of the hyper-\nembodied state seemed to be more present during normal\ndaily life when patients have to deal with less unexpected or\ndisturbing situations. In contrast with this hyperembodiment,\nthe state of disembodiment occurred particularly when\npatients were suddenly or intensely confronted with stress\n(for exampleanxiety or panic). So considering embodiment\nas a dimensional construct with hyper-embodiment and dis-\nembodiment on both sides of the spectrum, the equilibrium\ntends to hyper-embodiment, including the possibility of a\ntemporary, state-dependent shift of this equilibrium from\nhyper- to disembodiment. Finally, these qualitative data also\nshowed an important interpersonal aspect in body awareness\n(the lived body in interaction with others), in line with\nMerleau-Ponty's concept of intercorporeality as a prereflec-\ntive and unconscious attunement on a bodily level.\nIn addition, a difference in body awareness between FM\npatients with and without alexithymic characteristics was\ninvestigated. Based on the literature, it was hypothesized that\nan alexithymic individual was characterized by a disembod-\nied state. Nevertheless, this study illustrates that the person-\nality trait alexithymia has no influence on how FM patients\nexperience their body.\nAlexithymic patients primarily failing in expressing their\nbodily experiences without actually being disembodied\ncould be a possible explanation. Compared with the nonalex-\nithymic group, some differences characterizing the alexithy-\nmic participants can nevertheless be noticed: the presence of\nverbal reactions pointing to a lack of mentalization, experi-\nencing more misunderstanding from the environment and\npreferring exercise therapy instead of hands-on therapy.\nStrengths and Limitations\nTwo independent researchers discussed the present findings\nuntil agreement (investigator triangulation). Data were dis-\ncussed in a transdisciplinary way and approached from dif-\nferent theoretical perspectives. A first methodological\nlimitation is the number of participants in the study, causing\na lack of theoretical saturation. This implies that certain\naspects remain questionable and that the relationship between\nthe different themes is not yet fully elaborated. In addition, it\nis possible that the presence of individuals with depressive\ncharacteristics in both focus groups biased the results because\ndepression has an influence on how the body is experienced\n(Luyten & Fonagy, 2011). Finally, two respondents with a\nscore 53 on the TAS-20 were classified in the nonalexithy-\nmic group, whereas the cut-off score is 51.\nImplications for Clinicians\nHands-on interventions, aiming at improving body aware-\nness,suchasFasciaTherapyMethodDanisBois,Feldenkrais,\nRolfing, or Rosen Method Bodywork can be seen as recom-\nmendable therapeutic approaches in FM. We suggest that\nhands-off body awareness interventions are more appropri-\nate in case of alexithymic FM patients. In addition, therapists\nmust be aware of embodiment as a result of both individual\nand inter-individual processing adding up to the first person\nexperience of a lived body. This is why techniques focusing\non expressing how the body is lived and improving body\nmentalization can be used in alexithymic FM patients\nbecause they fail to describe their bodily signals in a clear\nway, leading to misunderstanding from the environment,\nwhich in turn can affect overall body experience. It is impor-\ntant to note that therapists should treat FM patients using a\nstaged or phase-oriented approach, starting with bodywork\nand gradually working toward verbalization, but always\nCalsius et al. 9\nstarting from the lived body experience of being in and inter-\nacting with the world.\nRecommendations for Future Research\nMore comprehensive research on this topic is needed. Not\nonly exploring in more detail what elements determine a\nstate of hyper- or disembodiment in FM or how they are\ndescribed and experienced in several different contexts but\nalso researching the factors that could influence or cause a\nshift between hyper- and disembodiment remain largely\nunknown.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAfrell, M., Biguet, G., & Rudebeck, C.
