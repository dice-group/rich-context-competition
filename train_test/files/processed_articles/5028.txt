The fourth is the hybrid of two or\nmore of the earlier mentioned approaches.

This makes many of them to look outward\nfor assistance from foreign nations and nongovernmental\ninstitutions. Postconflict development through external sup-\nport is not bad. This is because it exerts no initial economic\nresponsibility on recipients. However, it may have long-term\nnegative effects of loan refund, lack of self-dependency, and\ndelayed internal fund generating motivation in low-income\ncountries.\nSelf-help, an inward looking strategy, may have its initial\nchallenges but it encourages the people who are concerned to\nattend to their needs, and by this means, they develop self-moti-\nvated economic sustainability. The commitment of residents in\nconflict areas to self-motivated approach makes development\nthrough self-help to be more sustainable than depending on\nexternal aids from nonconflict regions. At the long run, such\nself-reliance approach will also positively influence the eco-\nnomic and sociophysical well-being of conflict-affected resi-\ndents. Such positive effect may have its spatial dimension over\ntimes, sometimes spreading beyond the postconflict communi-\nty's boundaries.\nThis study was centered on the inward motivated school\nof thought. It perceived community-based institutions as\nself-help initiatives toward socioeconomic and physical\ndevelopment of communities, especially in areas that have\njust emerged from conflicts. Literature has shown that com-\nmunity-based organizations (CBOs) have proved their rele-\nvance in the local socioeconomic and physical developments\nof either conflict or nonconflict zones of lagging regions of\n1Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, Nigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nAlbert Ayorinde Abegunde, Department of Urban and Regional Planning,\nFaculty of Environmental Design and Management, Obafemi Awolowo\nUniversity, OAU, PO, Ile Ife, Osun State, Ile Ife, Osun State 220, Nigeria.\nEmail: abajesulo@yahoo.com; abajesulo@gmail.com; abebert@oauife.edu.ng\nAccomplishment Index Analysis of the\nSociophysical Activities of Community-\nBased Organizations in a Postconflict\nArea of Africa\nAlbert Ayorinde Abegunde1\n Keywords\ncommunity-based organization, accomplishment index, conflict, sociophysical activities, community, development\n2 SAGE Open\nOnyeozu, 2010). This is so because they embark on self-help\nprojects that are undertaken through voluntary efforts and\nutilize meager local resources to meet community's needs\nthat are either of small- or large-scale dimensions. What this\nmeans is that CBOs place an emphasis on joint efforts; they\norganize members for identification of their needs. They also\nembark on projects that meet these communities' needs and\nmaximize reliance on local initiatives and resources. Thus,\nCBOs make an active participation of individuals and corpo-\nrate groups at grassroots a nucleus of sustainable develop-\nment (Onyeozu, 2010). Over the years, these characteristics\nhave given popularity to the organizations among local resi-\ndents in developing countries (Barr, Dekker, & Fafchamps,\nThe activities of CBOs in developing nations, especially\nin Africa where many governments have failed to sustain\ndevelopment of their local communities, have been reviewed\nby Cernea (1984), CBOs are local initiatives and resilience\nto failure of the central government. In another dimension, it\nis perceived as the bottom-up approach by the residents to\ncater for the shortcomings of top-town strategy by the gov-\nernment. The economic contributions of CBOs to develop-\nment at the district level in developing countries have also\nbeen well considered in the literature (Barr et al., 2010;\nsociophysical effects are available in Africa, especially in\nconflict affected zones. Some of the past studies have\nfocused on the impacts of CBOs at local level on agricul-\ntural development (Zurayk, 2010), physical aspect of com-\nsocial services' provision (Katungi & Akankwasa, 2010),\nand the activities of nongovernmental institutions (Onyeozu,\ndevelopment, housing, local potentials and initiatives, and\nrural development, respectively. None of these past studies\nhave been able to determine the level of sociophysical\nachievement made by CBOs in a conflict-affected area of\nsub-Saharan Africa. This gap was what the current study\nintended to fill.\nOne of the recent studies that were based on CBOs in\nAfrica was carried out by Sangole, Kaaria, Njuki, Lewa, and\nMapila (2014). The work measured the social capital, func-\ntioning, and accountability of farmers' organization in\nKenya, based on people's participation. The author noted\nthat farmer groups that integrated community driven partici-\npatory monitoring and evaluation had higher indexes for\ngroup social capital and performance with greater group\ncohesion while their members had higher satisfaction with\ngroup performance. The work, however, focused only on\nagro-based organization and did not expatiate on both its\nsocial and physical activities. It also lacked a spatial dimen-\nsion. In addition, it was not based on the conflict affected\neconomy. Hence, it could not have measured the achieve-\nment of such organization in a postconflict environment.\nAlong this line, C. Claudia, Mincemoyer, and Perkins (2005)\nmeasured the impact of youth development programs, based\non online youth life skills evaluation system using the\nachievement test. This work was Internet based with no\nphysical geographical scope and so it was not concerned of\nsociophysical activities of CBOs in the built environment.\nThe result of the work also centered on providing database\nwhere youths could access online information in a digital\nInternet community where there is no physical conflict that\nhas resulted in community economic regression. Such\nonline-based study could not have suggested the level of\nachievement made by CBOs that are location based. It could\nnot also have revealed the spatial extent of the sociophysical\nfacilities provided by CBOs in the study area.\nSome other related past studies used residents'perceptions\nto explain the impacts of CBOs on important and sensitive\nareas of the environment like housing (J. Claudia, 2003; The\nUrban Institute & Vidal, 2001), infrastructure (Mardirosian,\n(Abegunde, 2011), and disaster and conflict management\nare social and physical issues in the community, but the\nimpact studies were not conflict related.\nThe commonality of conflicts inAfrica, the current wave of\nadvocacy for an inward looking strategy in postconflict socio-\nphysical development, and the recent springing up of CBOs in\nthe region have all pointed to the need for a relevant new study\nKhwairakpam, Shankar, & Mukherjee, 2014). The current\nstudy therefore positioned Ile Ife, a city that has just emerged\nfrom communal conflict in sub-SaharanAfrica as a case study.\nSuch a specific study was not common in the region. Previous\nwere all silent on their level of accomplishment and were not\ncarried out on postconflict communities.\nThe present study contributed to knowledge by providing\ninformation on the sociophysical operations of CBOs in a\npostconflict environment and justified this by the level of\nachievement they attained in the course of exerting their\ninfluences within a geographic scope. In the course of con-\nducting the current study, interests were drawn to the socio-\neconomic and physical characteristics of these CBOs. These\ninclude their nature of operations, years of establishment,\nconditions of membership, sources and modes of fund gen-\neration, types of objectives they set and levels of their accom-\nplishment on sociophysical projects, and the spatial extent of\nthese within their geographic space. Such information could\nassist in establishing the CBOs' thresholds and by this pro-\nvide a basis for determining the success rate of their social\nand physical supports that they offered to residents in the\nstudy area.\nAbegunde 3\nThe Literature\nCommunity-Based Organization\nCBO is also known as local organization, community devel-\nopment, neighborhood council, and united community\namong others across the nations of the world (Abegunde,\n2009).Another institution that seems to be closer to it at local\nlevel is the nongovernmental organization (NGO). However,\na distinction between CBOs and NGOs is that the former\nsuggest simple institutions that cover a relatively small area\nwith a local identity while NGOs have a sophisticated and\ncomplex structure and cover a wider area and project, though\nwith a concern for local communities (Agbola, 1998).\nCommunity Development Associations and Their\nSociophysical Dimension\nStudies on social and economic implications of community\ndevelopment associations abound in the literature (Abegunde,\nTwombly, De Vita, & Garrick, 2000). Other works on their\nphysical and spatial effects also exist but these studies were\ncarried out by scholars who are located outside the region of\nTsai, 2008). Paradoxically, CBOs' physical development\nimpacts have been felt long ago among indigenous settlers in\nmany traditional communities in Africa (Adebisi, 2009; Ayo,\nstudy was based (Holdcroft, 1982; Olowu, Ayo, & Akande,\n1991). Such physical impact was felt through self-help hous-\ning construction (Agbola, 1998), infrastructural provision\nand development of public centers for community use\n(Narayan, 1995) among others. In community development\nplanning, the physical operation of CBOs has its spatial\ndimension. The argument here is that all social, economic,\nand physical impacts of CBOs in any given community are\nwithin a geographic space, spatially concentrated or dis-\npersed. However, most of these past studies have failed to\nlink the physical attributes and activities of CBOs with their\nspatial effects. Attempts to achieve this has made the present\nstudy to determine the accomplishment level of the social\nand physical activities of the CBOs in Ile Ife, Nigeria, with a\nspatial perspective on the postconflict community. This was\ncarried out to confirm the assertion that CBOs as local insti-\ntutions are formed mainly by residents who are living within\nan immediate environment and that their operations are best\nenjoyed in the immediate neighborhood of the CBOs' exis-\nHasenfeld & Gidron, 1993). In addition, the current study\nwas carried out to confirm if this also applied to conflict-\naffected areas of developing nations or not. It also aimed at\ndetermining the commitments of such CBOs to residents'\nsociophysical and economic well-being and the reconstruc-\ntion of their community, even after crises.\nAccomplishment Index (AI)\nAI as used in this study is a method of determining success\nor attainment level of a group based on the aim it sets to\naccomplish. This is computed by attaching scores that are\nhaving rated values (in ordinal form) to performance indexes\nunder each of the CBOs' set objectives. The AI in this study\nwas referenced to the work of Likert (1932). The author\ndeveloped Likert-type scale of performance rating, using\nscales 1 to 5. The scale with the lowest rate was counted as\nhaving the least score and vice versa, though in an ordinal\nformat (Afon, 2006). This AI also has its roots in (but not\nexactly the same as) the achievement index that was pro-\npounded by an educationist named Valen Johnson of the\nInstitute of Statistics and Decisions at Duke University who\nfirst developed the model to calculate grade point average\n(GPA) of students to appraise their academic accomplish-\nAccording to V. E. Johnson (1997), achievement index is a\nmeasure of a student's performance, relative to all other stu-\ndents taking classes at the institution. Since then, achieve-\nment index has become one of the statistical methods used to\nsolve problems relating to students' GPA. Researchers who\nhave used the test in recent times include Lehman and Geller\nthis model in Georgia University and concluded that it could\nbe used to ascertain students' level of learning within a\ncourse, in a major, or across their entire undergraduate\neducation.\nAccording to V. E. Johnson (1997), three basic principles\nof achievement index must be followed to arrive at a mean-\ningful conclusion (V. E. Johnson, 2003). First, students'\ngrades in courses must provide minimal performance in ordi-\nnal information and not necessarily in an absolute term. This\nwill help the researcher to categorize respondents (students)\ninto groups that are receiving the same grade and to rank\nthese groups relative to other groups. Second, the ordinal\ninformation on grades obtained is used to make a summary\nscore which indicates each student's academic performance\nrelative to the performance of other students. By this means,\nthe pattern of all grades in all classes is determined. The third\nassumption is that consequences of the test must be explicitly\nspelt out before a conclusion is drawn.\nAI in this study borrowed knowledge from these assump-\ntions and used Likert-type scale (Afon, 2006) ratings of\nnumbers 1 to 5 to rate respondents' (CBOs heads) scores on\nthe social and physical activities of CBOs in the study area.\nThis fulfills the first principle of achievement index which\nclaims that there is the need for ordinal information to cate-\ngorize respondents into groups that are receiving the same\nscore and to rank those groups relative to other groups.\nIn this study, AI was developed from the combination of\npieces of information extracted from Likert-type scale\n4 SAGE Open\nThis was used to determine the levels of success of main\ntasks and projects that were set to be accomplished by the\nCBOs within the past one decade in the study area. In line\nwith the third assumption of achievement index of V. E.\nJohnson (1997), the level of success recorded or observed in\nthe sociophysical activities of the CBOs in the study area\nwas established.\nMethod for the Study\nThe Case Study\nIle Ife was chosen as the case study for this work. It is a tra-\nditional city and it is located in Southwestern Nigeria. Past\nstudies revealed that the study area and its peripheral regions\nhave records of CBOs' operations (Abegunde, 2009; Ayinde\n& Torimiro, 2014), despite the protracted intercommunal\nconflicts that had affected the community for decades\n(Albert, 2001). The city is the most civilized part of a country\nthat has the highest population in sub-Saharan Africa (World\nBank, 2014). It is made up of two local government areas.\nThese are Ife East and Ife Central Local Government Areas,\nwhose headquarters are at Oke-Ogbo and Ajebandele,\nrespectively. The two local governments consist of 21 politi-\npeople (S\u00e1enz, Embrick, & Rodr\u00edguez, 2009). This city is\nannual rainfall of 0.6 m which encourages farming of variety\nof crops (Ajala & Olayiwola, 2013). The city has one lan-\nguage (Yoruba) that promotes understanding among resi-\ndents. This made the study area to conform to the general\nmorphology of a traditional settlement, having a common\nculture and other forms of social attributes. These encourage\na social interaction and also enhance a joint contribution\ntoward fulfillment of a common goal. This could be why\nCBOs are common and age-long in the region (Ayo, 2002).\nSuch homogeneous cultural attribute was expected to\ngender unity rather than conflicts among residents. The\nreverse was the case in the study area. This is because two\ndistinct groups of settlers are known to coexist in the city for\ncenturies. Each of the group of these distinct two settlers has\na local dialect commonly spoken within respective neighbor-\nhoods of each settlement. These two groups are the Ifes and\nthe Modakekes (Akinjogbin, 1996). The former people were\nsaid to be the early settlers while the latter were said to be in\nthe minority and were accommodated by the former, based\non the consent of the forefathers of the Ifes who gave sepa-\nrate land to the Modakekes for farming while the minority\ngroup paid tributes to the host. Over time, the Modakekes\nmultiplied and expanded and as expected, they have to claim\nthe land given to them by the Ifes as their territory (Albert,\nsuch claim. The sociocultural difference between the two\ndistinct settlers was easy to manage by the residents before\nand after Nigeria's independence until the country gave spe-\ncial attention to local government system that encouraged\ngrassroots development. Thus, lack of generally accepted\nformula to share political proceeds in the city as touching the\ntwo distinct settlers led to prolonged hostilities that escalated\nSiamese settlements that formed a city had engaged in sev-\neral clashes over decades, and these have resulted in internal\ndisplacement, loss of lives and property, occupational disem-\npowerment, and economic regression among others\na critical dimension when the federal government decided to\nlocate a new local government secretariat in Ife territory\nwhere there had been a previous one, shared by the two\ngroups of settlers. The Modakekes felt that one out of the two\nlocal government secretariats must be located in their terri-\ntory while the Ifes opined that their counterpart late settlers\nhad no right to challenge the host. This generated crisis that\ndestroyed property, grounded public infrastructure, displaced\nand claimed lives of residents, and negatively impacted their\neconomy and education. According to Albert (2001), most\nModakekes were peasant farmers while few of them were\ninto plantation farming. On the average, a plantation farmer\nnearly all the industrial establishments in their territory to the\nconflicts between the two settlements claimed 10,000 lives\nand paralyzed the economy for years.\nPreliminary Survey\nPrior to the collection of the data needed for this study, the\nresearcher conducted a reconnaissance survey to the depart-\nment of community development and CBOs' leaders in the\ntwo local government councils in the study area. This was to\nknow the total number of registered CBOs in each area.\nInformation obtained on the total number of the registered\nCBOs also guided in the choice of the sample to be drawn\nfrom the population for this study. It also assisted in locating\nand identifying the respondents, seeking their consents and\nexplaining the study intention to them. Basic information\nrequired before conducting the study therefore include the\ncontact addresses and mobile phone numbers of all the regis-\ntered CBOs' heads in the study area. Relevant officers that\nwere approached on these in the government offices obliged\nto these requests.\nAfter locating the CBOs heads through phone contacts,\ntheir consents were sought and they all consented. During\nthe reconnaissance survey, issues relating to the CBOs'oper-\nations as acquired in the literature were discussed with all the\nCBOs' heads that were to become the respondents. They all\nexpressed their views, and relevant information that origi-\nnated from the CBOs' heads during preliminary survey was\nalso incorporated into the list of data needed for the study.\nAbegunde 5\nThus, the concerns for the study were well structured and\ndefined after the preliminary survey.\nResults from the preliminary survey assisted the researcher\nin the preparation of the questionnaire to be administered on\nthe CBOs' leaders. Ideally, the reconnaissance survey led to\nthe adoption of triangulation method for this study. While\nethical permission was granted by each of the respondents,\nsome of them requested for name anonymity on the pieces of\ninformation to be supplied. This was strictly adhered to in\nthis study. The reconnaissance survey carried out also guided\nthe researcher to apply the basic concepts that were designed\nand to establish the data needs for this study.\nRelevant Terminologies\nThe term actual accomplishment index (AAI) in this study\nrefers to the degree of achievement of the projects conducted\nby the CBOs in the study area as documented at the secondary\nsource (the CBOs'financial statement and other relevant mate-\nrials) while the perceived accomplishment index (PAI) revealed\nthe opinions of residents, based on their observations of the\nsuccesses recorded by the CBOs'sociophysical activities.\nFor ease of primary data collection and analysis, the socio-\nphysical activities in this study were grouped into six catego-\nries. This was influenced by collective knowledge obtained\nfrom the works of Mathew-Njoku, Angba, and Nwakwasi\nactivities, and operations of the CBOs in some developing\ncountries were reviewed. The six groups are infrastructure\nfacilities, credit facilities, security of life and property, social\ndevelopment, leadership training, and moral and spiritual\nsupport. Bildt (2003) also observed that these activities are\nvery important in postconflict peace-building.\nInfrastructure facilities as conceived in this study are the\nessential amenities provided for the benefit of the public for\nthe social and economic development of the entire commu-\nnity. Observations made about these infrastructure facilities\nduring reconnaissance survey revealed that they include pipe\nborne water, bore hole, public toilet and urinary, neighbor-\nhood hall, and roads among others. These facilities are nec-\nessary and mostly available in any given community, but this\nstudy focused on the specific ones provided by the CBOs in\nthe study area.\nThe term credit facilities as used in this study refer to eco-\nnomic supports which were in form of credit loan and sub-\nsidy, given to the people (especially the CBOs' members)\nwith or without their requests to cushion the effects of con-\nflicts on residents'economy. The security of life and property\noffered in the study area to CBOs' members was mostly in\nform of informal local community police support to mem-\nbers, based on requests. In other words, the CBOs either\nformed the team that served as local vigilante group or they\nemployed those who would offer their services for economic\nreturn. What this means is that such employees served as\nsecurity agents/guards to protect the CBOs'members in their\nrespective homes, especially at nights, although the security\nof life and property that are offered to CBOs' members may\nsometimes also include provision of money to them to pro-\ncure relevant materials and hire guards to protect residents'\nlives and properties. According to Bildt (2003), this need is\ncardinal to sustainable postconflict peace-rebuilding.\nSocial development as it applies to this study includes\nprovision of subsidized or free health and educational mate-\nrials to CBOs' members, training and granting of scholar-\nships to indigent people in the public, offering of public\nenlightenment programs to sensitize residents on necessary\ninformation on community development, peace talk and\nmovements among people, and rehabilitation of CBOs mem-\nbers' affected houses and offices.\nInformation collected during reconnaissance survey on\nthe moral and spiritual support activities of the CBOs\ninclude but not limited to raising free offering in form of\ncash, food, and clothing to the needy and rendering of moral\nassistance to CBOs'members during social functions such as\nnaming, marriage, burial, and graduation ceremonies among\nothers. It also include offering of counseling and sending of\nencouraging words regularly to members during crises and\nkeeping widows and orphans in secured homes to avoid soli-\ntude and depression. The reconnaissance survey also showed\nthat leadership training for key CBOs' leaders in this study\nwas by sending CBOs' leaders on train-the-trainers' pro-\ngrams on peace-building, entrepreneurship, financial or\ncommunity administration, and accountability.\nResearch Concerns\nThere were three basic issues of concern in this study. The\nfirst was to examine the socioeconomic and physical charac-\nteristics of the CBOs and to confirm the relationship that\nexisted among these variables in the study area. The study\nalso raised concern on how the sociophysical activities of the\nCBOs were accomplished in actual term (according to the\ndocumented information contained in the records of these\norganizations) and perceptively, based on the physical obser-\nvations and judgments of the community opinion leaders\nwho represented the end users of these projects in the study\narea. Along this line, the third concern was to establish the\ngap that could have existed between the qualitative and\nquantitative assessments of the CBOs'accomplishment so as\nto determine the degree of residents' satisfaction with the\nCBOs' sociophysical activities. This was expected to assist\nin understanding the level of CBOs intervention in postcon-\nflict sociophysical performances and confirm the perception\nof the residents to the claims of the CBOs on their socio-\nphysical services' provisions in the postconflict area.\nData Sources and Needs\nTwo sources of data were explored for this study. These are\nprimary and secondary sources. The latter was where financial\n6 SAGE Open\nTable 2.

CBOs = community-based organizations.\nstatement, records on social, economic, and physical activi-\nties, of the CBOs in Ile Ife, Nigeria, was sourced from. The\nprimary source was where direct information concerning the\nstudy was obtained through administration of structured ques-\ntionnaire. Sourcing data from the two sources was informed\nby some reasons. First, to avoid bias, Organisation for\nEconomic Co-Operation and Development (OECD; 2008)\nsuggested sourcing information from more than a source on\nstudies that are conducted in intercommunal conflict area. It\nshould be recollected that this study was conducted on two\nsettlements that have fused together to become one. Besides\nthis, project delivery in many developing countries of the\nworld requires end users'opinions, irrespective of the reliabil-\nity of the documents available with the donors at the second-\nary source. According to Ohail and Cavill (2008), this will\nreveal lapses between paper documents and physical reality\nafter project execution and such is necessary in countries\nwhere leaders are corrupt, not accountable.\nThis study used triangulation method of data collection.\nThis method allows collection of data from two or more dif-\nferent sources for a research purpose. Yeasmin and Rahman\n(2012) were of the opinion that this method could combine\nboth the advantages of qualitative (perceived) and quantita-\ntive (actual) observations to arrive at meaningful conclu-\nsions. This is just as recent developments in the philosophy\nof science have contended that this method would provide\navenue for both perceived and actual data to interact to solve\nBy combining multiple observers, theories, methods, and\nempirical materials, researchers can hope to overcome the\nweakness or intrinsic biases and the problems that come from\nsingle-method, single-observer and single-theory studies. Often,\nthe purpose of triangulation in specific contexts is to obtain the\nconfirmation of findings through convergence of different\nperspectives. The point at which the perspectives converge is\nseen to represent the reality. (p. 3)\nInformation required of the CBOs for this study include\ntheir years of establishment, number of members, capital\nbases, average number of beneficiaries, likely sources of\ngenerating funds, spatial extent of operations, and pulling\nmembers within and out of the region of existence. These\nspatial extents of operations were determined through calcu-\nlation of the distances of different places of operations and\nmembers'addresses to each of the CBOs'offices in the study\narea.\nThe leaders or heads of these CBOs were also contacted\nfor secondary data, and relevant information were obtained\nfrom their associations' archives on past number of projects\nthey set to accomplish and the degree of fulfilling these.\nOthers are the amount of money they anticipated for each\nproject and the total amount of money they realized and all\nthe internal and external sources of funds where they raised\nthe money to finance these projects. These CBOs' leaders\nwere targeted for both primary and secondary data because\nthey represented the interest of their members, lived among\nthe residents, and were exposed to public comments on resi-\ndents' satisfactions about their organizations' sociophysical\nactivities in the study area. Studies have also shown that they\ncan also be recognized as opinion leaders on studies that are\ncommunity based (Gaventa, 2004; Khurram & Graham,\nstudy were considered as community or opinion leaders dur-\ning data collection.\nData Collection Technique\nData from the primary source were collected through design\nand administration of a structured questionnaire to all regis-\ntered CBOs in Ile Ife. Reconnaissance survey revealed that\nthere were 359 CBOs that registered with the local govern-\nment councils in the city (Ife Community Development\nUnits, 2006). Thus, Ife East and Ife Central local government\n11 political wards, respectively (see Tables 1 and 2).\nForty percent (120) of these CBOs were randomly selected\nfor questionnaire administration. The choice was influenced\nby earlier studies conducted on CBOs in the study area\n(Agbola, 1998). The lists containing the CBOs'names in order\nof registration with the two local governments in the study\narea formed the sample frame. Two out of the first five\nTable 1. The CBOs by Local Government Distribution in Ile Ife,\nNigeria.\nLocal\ngovernment\narea\nNumber\nof CBOs\nPercentage\nselected\nApproximate number\nof questionnaire\nadministered\nNote. CBOs = community-based organizations.\nAbegunde 7\norganizations in each of the CBOs' lists from the two local\ngovernment councils were selected through balloting. The\nchance of selecting any CBO in the study area depended on\nthe inclusion of its name in the CBOs'lists at the local govern-\nment registry because these lists served as the sample frame\nfor this study. Subsequent samples were systematically\nselected (without replacement) in order of how the CBOs'\nnames were listed in the registers with each of the two local\ngovernment councils. Information from reconnaissance sur-\nvey revealed that the two local government councils used the\nsame style to categorize these CBOs in their registries. As\nreflected in Table 2, this same categorization was used in\ngrouping the CBOs in this study. This does not mean that the\ncategorization should be generalized with what obtained in the\nliterature; it is only peculiar to this study and the study area.\nDuring data collection, the CBOs' heads were asked to\nrate each of the six sociophysical activities in the question-\nnaire that was administered on each of them, using Likert-\ntype scale of five points rating. These included highly\naccomplished (meaning the projects were completed and in\nuse), accomplished (meaning the projects were not fully\ncompleted but were useful to the residents, thereafter), mod-\nerately accomplished (meaning that although the projects\nwere not completed but residents have high level of hope that\nsuch works would not be abandoned but they would be use-\nful in the nearest future because the level of delivery had\ncrossed halfway), not well accomplished (meaning that the\nCBOs worked on the projects, although they were not cur-\nrently useful in any form to the residents at the time of con-\nducting this study, probably the work have not reached\nhalfway), and poorly accomplished (indicating that the proj-\nects had public awareness but they did not go beyond incep-\ntion stage, if at all they were commenced physically). In the\nsame vein, information collected through secondary data on\nthe level of sociophysical projects implemented were also\ncategorized into five, namely, successfully completed (and in\nuse), completed well above halfway (to the level at which\nresidents did use it although it was not yet offering a full\nsatisfaction), completed about halfway (at least halfway\naccomplished but it might not be useful to the residents in its\ncurrent state), completed below halfway (and no resources\nforth coming to continue the work), and the project was\ndesired and was just initiated/not embarked upon (the work\nwas still at the inception stage). Worthy to note here is that\nthe ratings for data from both primary and secondary sources\nwere patterned alike. This is a requirement for an ex post\nfacto research design and will aid the analysis of data that are\ncollected through nonexperimental technique, especially\nwhen qualitative and quantitative data are merged together\nAnalytical Techniques Adopted\nIn the analysis, the ratings were assigned weight values of\n5,4,3,2, and 1. These represent from highest degree of\naccomplishment or completion to the least, respectively.\nAnalysis of data collected through questionnaire was tagged\nperceived accomplishment index while the degree of project\ncompletion from secondary source was referred to as actual\naccomplishment index.\nThe PAI or AAI for each of the six variables was obtained\nby finding the summation and dividing it by weight value\n(SWV) of the total number of CBOs' heads that were inter-\nviewed (N) in the study. It should be noted that SWV was the\naddition of the product of the number of responses to each of\nthe variables and the weight value attached to each rating\n(Afon, 2006). The mean ( for PAI and  for AAI) of either\nPAI or AAI was calculated and the deviation about the mean\nof each variable (Y -  for PAI and y -  for AAI) was\nobtained by subtracting the mean index from the index of\neach. The variance and standard deviation of each AI were\ncomputed to reveal the scatter about the mean (Berenson &\nHaving used triangulation method of data collection, the\nstudy combined the results of PAI and AAI together through\nthe use of ex post facto research technique to draw conclu-\nsions. According to Cohen, Manion, and Morrison (2007, pp.\nisting and postfact data that can be matched in situations\nwhere it is unethical to control or manipulate the dependent\nvariables. In this study, AAI obtained from secondary source\nbecame the preexisting one while PAI which was obtained\nlatter through administration of questionnaire to confirm the\nvalidity of the former (information from the secondary\nsource) served as the postfact data. On studies that require\nonly two sets of data as the case was in this study, Kerlinger\n(1986) recommended the use of co-relational ex post facto\nresearch design which involves the collection of two sets of\ndata by first identifying the antecedents of a current situation\nretrospectively, with a view to determining the relationship\nthat could exist between this and the postdata, after merging\nthem together.\nIn addition, this study also used correlation coefficient to\ntest the relationship existing between socioeconomic charac-\nteristics of CBOs and the physical development impact they\nexerted on the residents in Ile Ife, Nigeria. This parametric\nanalysis depended on data collected from the secondary\nsource alone and used those variables that were numeric\namong them. Such analysis is universally recognized, unlike\nLikert-type scales that were computed using the interval\nmeasurement that requires justification.\nThe Use of Likert-Type Scale Ordinal as an\nInterval Measurement in This Study\nThe variables that were generated through Likert-type scale\nin this study were treated as (possessing) interval measure-\nments. Such analytical technique requires detail explanations\nto avoid statistical confusion. Prior to this study, Likert-type\nscales, which unarguably are ordinal data and whose\n8 SAGE Open\nintervals cannot be considered as numeric have generated\narguments in the literature as to be solely treated as nonpara-\nmetric (Agresti, 2002) or to be absorbed in the parametric\n(2013) have opined that Likert-type scales are ordinals, lack-\ning numerical intervals. Thus, Clogg and Shihadeh (1994)\nand Agresti (2002) contended that only nonparametric statis-\ntical analyses should be used to process data with ordinal\nscales and Kuzon, Urbanchek, and McCabe (1996) believed\nthat deviation from this will lead to committing one of the\nterrible \"sins\" of statistical analysis. The works of Wilson,\nWainwright, Stehly, Stoltzfus, and Hoff (2013) and Kornfeld\n(2013) were recent compliance to this school of thought.\nThese scholars' position is understood because Dolnicar and\nGrun (2007) noted that the user-friendliness and malleability\nof scale formats are not yet popular and are not well\nresearched into. Such low level of popularity could limit\nLikert-type scales' universal comprehension, acceptability,\nand benefit utilization.\nIn agreement with Dolnicar and Grun (2007), Davison\nand Sharma (1988) had earlier observed that parametric tech-\nnique could be applied to analyze variables that have been\ncollected from the field with interval characteristics. This\nargument was upheld by three pillars. First, there has not\nbeen a universal agreement among statisticians against the\nintroduction of assumed interval measurements in Likert-\ntype scale, just as \"there have not been globally accepted\nmeasuring scale that can be used to translate intangibles into\nnumbers\" (Yusoff & Janor, 2014). These gaps have allowed\nresearchers to use discretions that are psychologically rea-\nsonable and scientifically permissible to assign numbers to\nrated scales in their researches, depending on the peculiari-\nties of their studies. Thus, many researchers have explored\nthis to promote scholarship across the globe (Afon, 2007;\nMarateb, Mansourian, Adibi, & Farina, 2014; Sarafidou,\ninstance, as far back as about two decades ago, more than\n70% of the articles that contained ordinal data and published\nPsychology and that of American Educational Research\nJournal, Sociology of Education were analyzed using para-\nmetric technique (Harwell & Gatti, 2001).\nThe second reason is that Likert-type scale has been clas-\nsified to be in the family of multicriteria model (Afon, 2006;\nCarrasco, Villar, Hornos, & Herrera-Viedma, 2011). There is\ntherefore the need to establish the mean of its variables for\neasy comparison (Afon, 2007). Along this line, scholars like\nscale in their works to treat ordinal data as intervals and they\nhad tested them through parametric analytical techniques\nsuch as mean, ANOVA, t test, factor analysis, and multiple\nregression.\nThe third reason is the current global influence of technol-\nogy and inclination of policy makers to facts and figures to\nsolve world's problems through objective judgment, even on\nsocial and cultural issues that require qualitative analysis.\nThe phenomenon of turning ordinals to intervals serves as a\ncompromising ground for researchers to meet the world's\nneeds on this and to make intangibles to become tangibles\nwithout losing the real values of research.\nScholars who completely oppose this development should\nnote that not even all numerical scales are of absolute values.\nFor instance, 50 \u00b0F is never considered as half of 100 \u00b0F in\ntrue experience. Thus, Geramian, Mashayekhi, and Ninggal\n(2012) and J. S. Gordon, Mahabee-Gittens, Andrews,\nChristiansen, and Byron (2013) advocated for a compromise\non ordinal conversion to numerical and suggested that the\nintroduction of quantitative scales that have limited numbers,\nrated in categorical form, with vague zero point and vague\nunit value would be of help (Yusoff & Janor, 2014). This\nmade Likert-type scale of ordinal ratings of 1 to 5 values as\nused in this current study to be accepted as tangible enough\nto adopt respondents' judgments on sociophysical projects\nthat were carried out by CBOs in postconflict area of Ile Ife,\nNigeria.\nRatings developed for assessing the sociophysical proj-\nects carried out by the CBOs in this study were patterned\nafter the semantic differentials of Heise (1969) and Boone\nand Boone (2012) which argued that the higher the positive\nscore implies the better the adjective that describes the issue\nor object concerned, the higher values attached, the greater\nthe number and the wider the interval, though arranged in\nordinal manner and the better to treat such data as numeric\nthe judgment of the researcher and normal distribution of the\nsample should be respected in applying parametric test to\nordinal scales. Hence, an attempt at calculating the mean,\nstandard deviation, and variance in this kind of a study is\naccommodated in the literature (Bartkowiak & Sen, 2007).\nFindings\nThe results obtained in this study were categorized into three\nsections, based on the research concerns for the study. The\nfirst section examined the socioeconomic characteristics of\nthe respondents and the CBOs they headed, while the second\nrated the opinions of the CBOs' heads on the objectives they\nset and the projects they executed after the conflicts in the\nstudy area. The section also considered the postconflict suc-\ncesses that were achieved by these CBOs on the sociophysi-\ncal projects that they executed based on the funds they\ngenerated from different sources over the space of 10 years.\nThe accomplishments of their set objectives were rated using\ninformation that were gathered on the actual number of proj-\nects executed with the funds. The last section established the\nrelationship between perceived and actual fulfillment of the\nCBOs sociophysical objectives in Ile Ife, Nigeria.\nAbegunde 9\nThe Socioeconomic and Physical Characteristics\nof CBOs in the Study Area\nThe socioeconomic characteristics of the CBOs and their leaders\nin Ile Ife, Nigeria.The findings revealed that nearly all the\nCBOs' leaders were literate, with close to two thirds (62.6%)\nand about one third (30.5%) of them having tertiary and sec-\nondary education, respectively. A handful (7.0%) of them\nhad been to primary school. This could be why civil servants\n(54.2%) who were expected to be literate were dominant\namong them, whereas traders (10.8%), farmers (2.5%), and\nretirees (4.2%) were sparsely represented. Some CBOs'\nleaders' occupations (28%) were not categorically indicated\nduring interview.\nTable 3 shows that the gender gap among the CBOs'lead-\ners was very marginal. Thus, male respondents among them\nMode of fund generation by the CBOs in Ile Ife, Nigeria. Fund is\nnecessary for the proper fulfillment of CBOs objectives. Table\n4 reflects that personal contribution (64.2%) by members was\nthe major source of fund generation in CBOs in Ile Ife. In other\nwords, the members of the associations were expected to con-\ntribute certain amount of money as part of their commitments\nto their associations and to run the activities of the CBOs.\nOther sources of fund include donations through charity\nmoney generated through investment of the associations\n(15.8%). It can be deduced here that funding in CBOs in Ile Ife\nwas through joint contribution and money that they realized\nfrom their investment and not by government support. This\nstudy is in agreement with Eziyi (2009) that asserted that fund-\ning of CBOs in Nigeria is mainly an association's members'\naffair. It, however, contradicted the findings of Krivelyova\net al. (2013) which was conducted across three developing\nnations in Africa where their governments and other donors\ncontributed reasonably to local development programs at\ngrassroots level. It should be noted that funding from such\nmultiple sources in Krivelyova et al.'s (2013) work were not\nremitted to or coordinated by the CBOs of these countries as\nthe case was in Eziyi (2009) and in the current study.\nYears of establishment of the CBOs in Ile Ife, Nigeria. The years\nof establishing the CBOs covered by this study were grouped\ninto seven. These include those established in the period of\nyears, and 16 and 20 years to the time of conducting this\nstudy. Others include those established between 21 years and\ntime of conducting the survey for this study.\nThe choice of these categories was influenced by different\npast political era in the country. Table 5 reflects that a hand-\nful (13.3%) of these CBOs came into existence in less than 5\nyears ago while a very negligible percentage of them was\nyears (1.9%) to the time of this study, respectively. Implicit\nto this is that most (75.8%) of the CBOs came into existence\ndecades.\nThe CBOs proliferation reduced after this era as the table\nreveals that only 15.6% of them were established between\ncommunal conflicts that affected the city ended in 2003.\nResidents were expected to have been displaced and new\nCBOs might not be easy to form until social order was fully\nrestored. On the contrary, the few CBOs that were formed\nafter, together with those existing before the conflicts must\nhave aimed at improving the living conditions of the resi-\ndents by fulfilling their local targets to prove their relevance\nin the conflict affected economy. In reference to this, the\nunstandardized coefficient of the sociophysical performance\nof the CBOs in Table 5 determines the strength of its\nTable 3.

Thus, the coefficient for the years\nof establishing the CBOs (.627) in the table predicted an\nincrease in their sociophysical performance. Since the rela-\ntionship was significant (p = .000), it shows that there was a\nlinear relationship between the tested variables. It can be\ninferred that the longer the years of establishment, the higher\nthe level of sociophysical performance of CBOs in the post-\nconflict community.\nMembership of the CBOs in Ile Ife, Nigeria. Table 6 reflects the\nfactors that influenced membership absorptions into the\nCBOs within the study area. As seen in the table, two fifths\nof the associations indicated that their membership was loca-\nwords CBOs in the former group were formed by and limited\nto residents that were living together in specific neighbor-\nhoods or areas in Ile Ife. Thus, the membership of those\nCBOs was not opened to other residents that hailed from out-\nside the immediate environment defined by the associations.\nThis is expected in a postconflict area because loss of\nconfidence, identity, and trust in distant residents can confine\npeople to join CBOs in their immediate vicinity where\ncomembers are known and the people are sure of security of\nlife, confidentiality of information, and safety in interrela-\ntionship (Haider, 2009). In addition, Ife and Modakeke as\nSiamese settlements in a city called Ile Ife host residents who\nhave distinct identities but are with discrete opinions due to\npast intercommunal conflicts that took place among them.\nResidents in such kind of environment would have choices\nof CBOs they would want to belong. This could be why\n43.3% of the CBOs indicated that their members were from\ntheir immediate environment. Thus, about 30% of the CBOs\nin Table 2 who registered with the government as landlord\nassociations must have had their membership from different\nneighborhoods where members who built their houses were\nliving. Under this condition, membership becomes compul-\nsory rather than voluntary (Chechetto-Salles & Geyer, 2006).\nAlong this line, nativity (13.4%) of residents was a factor in\nabsorbing membership to some CBOs in the study area. This\nindicates that resident's origin (by street or quarters) was\nlocation specific and has its spatial dimension and this influ-\nenced over one tenth of the CBOs' membership in the study\narea. The CBOs'members who were influenced by their reli-\ngions (4.8%) to join CBOs in the study area were very few\nand their membership may not be spatially inclined. Such\nlow representation is insignificant but it reveals that resi-\ndents' beliefs can sometimes influence the choice of com-\nmunity development associations that they choose to join in\nCorrelation of the effects of the socioeconomic characteristics of\nCBOs on spatial attributes of Ile Ife, Nigeria. The result of the\nrelationship between socioeconomic and spatial characteris-\ntics of the studied CBOs was conducted using Pearson's cor-\nrelation at p  .01 significant level. As revealed in Table 7,\nTable 5.

CBOs = community-based organizations.\nthere was a positive and direct relationship between income\nand six out of the seven tested variables. Of high significance\namong them are the relationships that their income had with\nthe capital base of the CBOs (0.647), their years of establish-\nnumber of members who have directly benefited from the\nsocioeconomic and physical operations of CBOs in the study\narea (0.373). What this implies is that as the number of years\nof establishment increased, the capital base of these CBOs\n(through contributions from members and other sources of\nfund generation) could have positively influenced their\ninvestments and the attendant income. Because the joint con-\ntribution was the main source of fund generation in these\nCBOs (see Table 3), those of them with large membership\nwould have had the opportunity of generating more funds to\ninvest, resulting in high income. Thus, the number of people\nwho claimed to have benefited in the CBOs' projects was\nsaid to have been significantly influenced by their capital\ncontributed to the spatial extent of the CBOs' operations\n(0.475) in the study area. Considering the first concern for\nthis study, this is an assurance that relationships existed\nbetween certain socioeconomic and physical characteristics\nof the CBOs in the study area.\nMeasurement of the Sociophysical Activities and\nProjects Carried Out by the CBOs in the Study\nArea\nPAI of the sociophysical objectives fulfilled by the CBOs in Ile Ife,\nNigeria.The success rate of the social and physical objec-\ntives that were set by the CBOs in Ile Ife was measured as\nCBOs' PAI. According to Table 8, major services provided\nto members and communities were grouped into six. These\nare infrastructure facilities, credit facilities, security of life\nand property, social support, leadership training, and moral\nand spiritual assistance. These are considered as the objec-\ntives of CBOs in this study.\nAs reflected in the table, a little close to two thirds of the\nrespondents indicated that the desire of their CBOs to pro-\nvide credit facilities (56.6%) and social development (65.0%)\nwas accomplished. This could be why their PAIs were well\nabove the computed mean PAI (3.07). These are credit facili-\ntable revealed that on the average, the CBOs claimed to have\nprovided security of life and property; and moral and spiri-\ntual supports to members and other residents in the study\narea. As shown in the table, these set objectives were not\nwell accomplished in the study area because their AIs ranged\nHence, the deviation about the mean of infrastructure facili-\nties (-1.02), security of life and property (-0.06), leadership\nwere negative.\nActual postconflict sociophysical tasks and projects that were set\nto be and were accomplished through funds that were generated\nby the CBOs in Ile Ife,Nigeria. The secondary data collected on\nthe sociophysical activities of the CBOs in Ile Ife revealed\nmoral and spiritual supports to members and trained 224 key\nleaders of their associations after the conflicts in the study\narea. During this period, they also outlined 117 community\ndevelopment projects on infrastructural facilities, 129 social\ndevelopmental programs, and 24 projects toward security of\nand 270 projects for the community) decade plans of the\norganizations. Table 9 reflects that a total amount of 633.24\nmillion Nigerian Naira (about US$4.2 million) would have\ncompleted the projects and tasks, all things being equal. The\ntable shows that a little above two thirds of the amount\nneeded to provide credit facilities to their members (68.5%)\nand more than half of what were projected for infrastructural\nfacilities (55.7%) and security of lives and property (54.4%)\nwere realized. These funds were mostly generated internally\nby members. Overall, these projects and tasks were poorly\nsupported by the community (6.64%), except those that were\nunder infrastructure provision. They were also least assisted\ncontributions realized (50.93%) from sources of fund gener-\nation came from the CBOs' members while only 16.35% of\nthis were generated from external sources. The CBOs' mem-\nbers' inability to contribute beyond one quarter of the set\nfund evidently affected the completion rate of the projects or\ntasks. At the end of a decade, Table 9 shows that 38.5%,\naccomplished, commenced but not completed, and not initi-\nated at all, respectively.\nOf these, security of lives and property (55.9%), credit\nfacilities to members (54.8%), and infrastructural facilities to\nthe community (49.6%) were projects or tasks with remark-\nable successes while only about one sixth of the social devel-\nopment programs and leadership training to key members\nwere fully completed. Hence, about two fifths of the outlined\nprojects or tasks that were set on social development pro-\ngrams (45.8%), moral and spiritual supports to members\nat all. This is because less than one third of the funds bud-\ngeted to accomplish the first mentioned two items were real-\nized. Worthy to note in the table is that despite the realization\nof about half (46%) of the money that was expected to train\nnot commenced and not completed at all in the study area,\nrespectively.

The fulfillments of\nthe sociophysical objectives in the Table 10 were from 1 to 5\npoint ratings, in order of the level of their accomplishments.\nProjects or objectives that were successfully or nearly com-\npleted by the CBOs and were delivered for usage had the\nprojects that were set to be accomplished in the CBOs'objec-\ntives but were not initiated or did not go beyond inception\nstage had the least score of one point rating (10%). Projects\nthat were (at least) accomplished about halfway but did not\n(at most) go beyond two thirds of the stage toward comple-\ntion had a moderate score of three (45%-67%). Those that\nwere accomplished beyond their inception stages but were\nnot really executed beyond halfway were rated as having two\npoints (11%-44%) while those that were accomplished above\ntwo-thirds stage level but were not really completed were\nrated as having four points (68%-90%) in the study. Hence,\nthe number of the projects that were successfully completed\nin each of these variables was not less than the summation of\nthe number of projects that were not completed in each\ncategory.\nAs reflected in the table, the highest AAI was 4.07\n(provision of security of life and property to members)\nwhile the least was 2.35 (provision of leadership training\nto key leaders). The average AAI (mean AAI) was 3.21.\nThis means that variables on the provision of credit facil-\nities' to members (AAI = 3.90) and infrastructural facili-\nties for public consumption (AAI = 3.70) were well above\nthe mean AAI (3.21) in the study area. This was why the\ndeviations about the mean of their AAIs (denoted as y -\n) were all positive (infrastructure facilities = 0.49; credit\nfacilities to members = 0.69 and security of life and prop-\nerty = 0.86). In the contrary, the deviations about the\nmean of the AAIs of other variables like social develop-\nand moral and spiritual supports to members (-0.50)\nwere all negative because their indexes were below the\ncomputed mean. Expectedly, the summation of the total\nnumber of the projects that were not embarked upon and\nthat were not completed at all in each of these latter three\nvariables was above the total number of projects that\nwere successfully completed under each of them as\nreflected in Table 9.\nThe Balance Between PAI and AAI of\nSociophysical Projects Embarked Upon by the\nCBOs in Ile Ife, Nigeria\nAll the variables that were tested in the course of analyzing\nthe PAI and the AAI on the sociophysical activities of the\nCBOs in Ile Ife were grouped into four. This was based on\nthe results of their computed indexes, deviation about the\nmeans and their variances. This was to provide a platform to\ndraw meaningful conclusions on the two analyses. Table 11\npresents the groupings.\nGroup A.The table reflects that only the variable on provi-\nsion of credit facilities to members of the CBOs had the com-\nputed indexes for PAI (3.20) and AAI (2.27) to be both above\ntheir calculated mean indexes (PAI = 3.07, AAI = 2.08), with\nmeans. This means that its PAI and AAI indexes both agreed\nthat CBOs in the study area have successfully delivered their\nsociophysical services to the residents in the postconflict\ncommunity.\nGroup B. Findings showed that variables on social programs\ncarried out by the CBOs in the community and that of secu-\nrity of life and property rendered to residents were in this\ncategory. The former had its PAI (3.47) above the mean\nabout the mean because its index (1.71) was below the calcu-\nlated mean (2.08). Hence, the assurance that this variable had\npositively impacted the sociophysical development in the\nstudy area was influenced by the perception of the people\n(PAI = 3.47) rather than by the information that was gener-\nated from the actual amount of money that was spent (see\nTable 9) on all the projects (see Table 10) that were success-\nfully completed. This was why the summation of the devia-\ntions about the mean of PAI and AAI of the social programs\nthat were carried out by the CBOs was low, though it was\npositive [{(Y - ) + (y - ) / 2} = 0.02].\nAs reflected in Table 11, the average of the summation\n{[(Y - ) + (y - ) / 2] = 0.36} of deviations about the mean\nlife and property that was provided by the CBOs was posi-\ntive. This was so because the computed index for AAI (2.50)\nwas well above its mean index (2.08) with a positive devia-\ntion about the mean (0.42). The findings revealed that the\nresults obtained in AAI had a dominant effect on the negative\nwas a little below the computed mean (3.07). What this\nimplies is that the variable on provision of security of life and\nproperty in the study area did not only record a success of\nbeing accomplished under the AAI (2.50) with positive devi-\nation about the mean (0.42) but on the average, the result of\nthe summation of the deviations about the mean of both PAI\nand AAI agreed to this {[(Y - ) + (y - ) / 2] = 0.36} being\npositive.\nGroup C. The variable on provision of infrastructural facili-\nties by the CBOs was in a separate class in this study because\nthe average of the summation of the deviations about the\nmean of both PAI and AAI was negative {[(Y - ) + (y - )\nwas well above its mean index (2.08) with positive deviation\nnot strong enough to suppress the perception of the people\nTable 11.

These are\namong the CBOs and moral and spiritual support to members\nvariables had their accomplishment indexes to be below their\ntive deviations about the mean. Expectedly, their (Y - ) +\nresults indicate that the two variables were both counted as\nnot accomplished, either in the actual term of money\nexpended by the number of projects executed (AAI) or by\nthe people's perception on what they witnessed and benefited\non these (PAI) in this study.\nDiscussions\nThe current study established CBOs' thresholds in postcon-\nflict area of Africa and provided a basis for determining their\nsuccess rate on their sociophysical project delivery. The use\nof mixed method through ex post facto technique to collect\nand analyze quantitative (actual [AAI]) and qualitative (per-\nceived [PAI]) data on the CBOs activities contributed to rel-\nevant past studies on peace-building in fragile communities\nworks of Reinikka and Collier (2001), Collier and Hoeffler\nResults of the survey first examined the socioeconomic\ncharacteristics of these CBOs and noted that most (75.8%) of\nthem came into existence in about one and half a decade era,\nwas marked with intercommunal violent conflicts in many\nlocal communities across the nation (Internally Displaced\nnomic regression (Behnassi, Pollmann, & Kissinger, 2013)\nas the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country at that\ntime was less than 18.2% growth annually (Ekpo & Umoh,\n(2014) opined that economic regression and state failure in\nlow-income countries breed violent conflicts (Collier &\nHoeffler, 2002) but promote CBOs' formation (Poskitt &\nDufranc, 2011) to meet community needs (Barron, Diprose,\nreveals the willingness of residents to internally raise fund\nfor their communal well-being, even amid poverty. Along\nthis line, most of the projects that were executed in the cur-\nrent study were financed through the money that was con-\ntributed mainly by the CBOs' members (64.2%). This has a\nroot in the self-determination theory of Nicholls (1984) and\nDeci and Ryan (2008) and the community need model of\nBurton (1990). Thus, resiliency to the failure of the central\ngovernment (Larsson et al., 2012) and active participation of\nindividuals and corporate groups at grassroots (Barr et al.,\n2010) are necessities in postconflict peace-building\n(Onyedinma & Kanayo, 2013; United Nations Department\nof Economic and Social Affairs, 2009). The period between\nlow was an era when the conflicts reduced and the GDP of\nNigeria was increasing at an annual growth rate of about 6%\n(Barung, 2014). Although such experience may not equally\ntranslate to real economic development (Sanusi, 2010), it can\nbe inferred that high number of CBOs that were created dur-\ning economic recession must have contributed to the coun-\ntry's economic growth that was recorded after conflicts. This\npositioned the current study within the bottom-up school of\nthought as CBOs at local level can be pro-poor tools for\npeace-building in postconflict communities. The study also\nserved as an eye opener to the need for a research on the\nindirect relationship that could exist between CBOs' prolif-\neration and national economic development in the develop-\ning nations.\nThe current study showed that only 5.49% of the money\nraised by the CBOs came from the government while it was\nexpected of her to contribute to CBOs purses to alleviate the\nsufferings of the conflict affected residents (Cernea, 1984;\nshowed that only a handful of the amount (16.35%) of the\nmoney raised by the CBOs came through some external\nsources. Although this contribution was low, it indicated that\nNGOs and donors assisted CBOs in fragile communities of\nAfrica (Omofonmwan & Odia, 2009). The CBOs were not\nable to raise much money through loans, possibly because\nthey must have lost their fixed assets that could serve as col-\nlateral securities during conflicts. Socioeconomically, one\nwould expect that the membership of such associations that\ndepended on members' contributions to thrive should have a\nwider geographical coverage. However, findings showed\nthat a sizable proportion (43.3%) of them was drawn from\nthe immediate neighborhoods. This agreed with the works of\nrespectively. Another issue of consideration in this current\nstudy is that its sample cut across different types of CBOs. In\nformed by people of common interests who created different\ninformal trades and unions to combat poverty. This could be\nwhy more than half of the CBOs were headed by well literate\ncivil servants who though were employed under the govern-\nment, they still engaged in CBOs that drew members from\ndifferent informal sectors (La Porta & Shleifer, 2014;\nPeschka, 2011). Although, studies have shown that faith-\nbased institutions are parts of the CBOs that do contribute to\ncommunity development and peace-building across the\nThe Urban Institute & Vidal, 2001), they seemed not to be\nrepresented in this study. The reason could be that they were\nnot registered with the government because the sample in\nthis study was drawn mainly from the list of the CBOs that\nregistered with the local government councils in the study\narea. This study could not categorically account for this lapse\nbut the works of Roberts, Odumosu, and Nabofa (2009) and\nOdumosu, Olaniyi, and Alonge (2009) threw light on this.\nThey both claimed that Nigerian local governments do not\nregister religious institutions as CBOs but they are responsi-\nble to their headquarters that registered with the government\nat federal level. Of interest in this study is the equality of the\nCBOs' leaders' males and females' proportion. This differed\nfrom many past African studies where males dominated the\nsample size due to the cultural setting of the region (Chant &\nnotions that conflicts pave way for women (Jensen, 2012;\nThe current study also examined the six CBOs' objec-\ntives that were set to achieve their sociophysical activities\nand showed that all the tested six variables scored above\nhalf (PAI + AAI  2.51) of the 5-point scale in their ratings.\nAlthough this study pioneered the categorization of CBOs'\nobjectives into six groups in postconflict area of Nigeria, it\ngave credit to the works of Mathew-Njoku et al. (2009) and\nFoster (2011). Two of these objectives had the highest rep-\nresentatives among others. These are security of life and\nproperty to residents and credit facilities to members. This\nBadiora and Abegunde (2015) that showed that security of\nlives and property and financial support to residents who\nhave lost property and breadwinners to conflicts are very\ncrucial challenges in fragile communities (OECD, 2008). In\naddition, postconflict areas are always characterized by\ncrime of all sorts, calling for security of lives and property\n(Shemyakina, 2006). Although the AAI of security of life\nand property was high in this study, its PAI was below its\nmean index with negative deviation about the mean. This\nmeans that the residents possibly desired higher level of\nsecurity of lives and property than what the CBOs could\nprovide. Similar condition trailed the AAI and PAI results of\nvariable on the infrastructural facilities provided by the\nCBOs in the study area. This could be why Bowd and\nChikwanha (2010) opined that security and infrastructural\nchallenges in postconflict environment cannot be easily met\nby an average fund (Africa Region Disaster Risk\ncalls for a rethink and pressure from international organiza-\ntions on African governments to support CBOs and relief\nresidents in postconflict communities. A body called\nNational Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) which\nwas created by the federal government of Nigeria (Federal\nRepublic of Nigeria, 1999) and located at the country's capi-\ntal city can be replicated at local level to provide support to\nthose CBOs in conflict-affected communities.\nThe study further showed that a little less than one third of\nwhat the CBOs budgeted to spend on social development\nwas realized and the residents claimed to be satisfied with\nthis. This may appear spurious but Fischer (2006) had earlier\nnoted that residents' social needs after conflict may not be\neconomically highly demanding like their need for infra-\nstructural facilities (McCandless & Karbo, 2011). Findings\nfurther revealed that variables whose PAI and AAI were both\nbelow mean index values, with negative deviations about the\nmean in this study, are leadership training to key leaders and\nmoral and spiritual supports to CBOs' members. As earlier\nreflected in Table 9, the study showed that very little money\nwas realized and utilized under the former variable. S.\nJohnson (2001) claimed that the latter could be so because\nthe standard of communal living among residents in Africa is\nvery high (Onyedinma & Kanayo, 2013) and the CBOs\nefforts might have fallen below the people's expectations.\nThere are many recent works that have used AI to analyze\nempirical data that were collected on researches (Afon, 2006;\nBelaire, Westphal, Whelan, & Minor, 2015; V. E. Johnson,\n1997; Peyre, MacDonald, Al-Marayati, Templeman, &\nMuderspach, 2010; Satterfield, Gregory, Roberts, Chan, &\nGrayev, 2013; Ziemlewicz, Kim, Romandine, & Robbins,\n2013). The present study seemed to be the first to pioneer the\ncombination of AAI and PAI to empirically examine the socio-\nphysical activities of CBOs in a postconflict area of Africa.\nResults showed that this can be replicated elsewhere, especially\nin otherAfrican low-income communities where protracted cri-\nses have resulted in cyclical poverty, calling for pro-poor inward\nthis nature is currently very relevant as studies have shown that\nout of the total 79 countries that had passed through violent con-\nflicts in the past few decades in the world, 65 of them are in the\n"
