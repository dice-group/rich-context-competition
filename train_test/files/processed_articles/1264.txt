Among older adults, anemia has\nbeen associated with a wide spectrum of adverse outcomes\n(Lipschitz, 2003), including reduced quality of life (Thomas,\n(Cesari et al., 2004), increased disability (Penninx et al.,\nand increased all-cause mortality among nursing home\nresidents (Kikuchi et al., 2001), and among moderately to\nseverely disabled women living in the community (Chaves\net al., 2004). Anemia has also been linked with congestive\nheart failure (Silverberg et al., 2000) and impaired cognitive\nfunction (Nissenson, 1992). The reduction of oxygen-\ncarrying capacity of the blood that occurs with anemia\nmay account for fatigue, cardiovascular complications and\nimpaired physical performance (Lipschitz, 2003). Anemia\namong older adults is caused by renal failure, chronic\ninflammation and nutritional deficiencies, and about\none-third of the anemia is unexplained (Guralnik et al., 2004).\nSelenium is an essential trace element and a normal\nconstituent of the diet. Selenium is a component of\nselenoproteins, including selenoenzymes such as glu-\ntathione peroxidase, selenoprotein-P and thioredoxin\nreductase (Zimmermann and Ko\nand Beggs, 2006). Serum selenium concentrations seem to\nand are lower in persons with chronic diseases (Bates et al.,\n2002). Low serum selenium concentrations have been\nassociated with increased mortality from cancer (Kok et al.,\nolder women living in the community (Ray et al., 2006). Low\nactivity of glutathione peroxidase, a major selenoenzyme,\nwas associated with increased risk of cardiovascular\nevents among adults with suspected coronary artery disease\nCorrespondence: Dr RD Semba, Johns Hopkins University, 550 North Broadway,\nE-mail: rdsemba@jhmi.edu\nwww.nature.com/ejcn\nAnimal and human studies suggest that there is a link\nbetween selenium deficiency and anemia. Among animals,\nselenium deficiency is associated with anemia in hens\nnot rats (Hu et al., 1984). In humans, selenium deficiency\nmay contribute to anemia among dialysis patients (Hampel\net al., 1985), adults with pulmonary tuberculosis (van Lettow\ndisabled older women living in the community (Semba et al.,\n2006). However, no information is currently available on\nserum selenium concentrations and the risk of anemia in the\nolder population. We hypothesized that low serum selenium\nlevels are associated with low hemoglobin among older\nadults. To examine this hypothesis, we characterized serum\nselenium and hemoglobin among older adults in the\nthird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nMethods\nThe study population consisted of men and women who\nwere sampled using a stratified, multistage probability design\nthat was representative of a national probability sample of\nthe civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United\nStates (National Center for Health Statistics, 1994). A full\nassessment in NHANES III included a home interview and\nexamination, including phlebotomy in a mobile examina-\ntion center. Some people were unable to come to the mobile\nexamination center and underwent a modified home\nexamination that included phlebotomy.\nLaboratory methods for NHANES III have been described\nin detail elsewhere (Gunter et al., 1996) and are briefly\nsummarized. Hemoglobin was measured using a Coulter-S-\nPlus Jr electronic counter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL,\nUSA). Serum iron was measured colorimetrically (Alpkem\nRFA Analyzer, Clackamas, OR, USA). Serum ferritin was\nmeasured using the Quantimmune Ferritin IRMA kit\n(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Folate and\nwere measured using the Quantaphase Folate\nradioassay kit (Bio-Rad). Serum creatinine was measured by\nthe Jaffe reaction using a Hitachi model 737 multichannel\nanalyzer (Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis,\nIN, USA), and creatinine clearance was computed using the\nCockroft\u00adGault equation: creatinine clearance (ml min\u00c01) \u00bc\n((140\u00c0age) \u00c2 kg body weight)/(mgdl\u00c01 plasma creatinine\u00c2 72).\nA 15% reduction was given for women (Cockcroft and\nGault, 1976). Serum selenium was measured using a graphite\nfurnace atomic absorption spectrometer (PerkinElmer,\nShelton, CT, USA) with Zeeman background correction\nAnemia was defined as hemoglobin o12 g dl\u00c01 for women\nDifferent pathophysiological types of anemia were distin-\nguished according to the criteria already used by Guralnik\net al. (2004) in the same study population. Anemia was\ndivided into types of anemia to gain insight into serum\nselenium concentrations within each type of anemia that\nwas previously described (Guralnik et al., 2004). Among\nanemic adults, iron-deficiency anemia was defined as having\ntwo or three of the following criteria: transferrin saturation\nrate less than 15%, serum ferritin concentration o12 ng ml\u00c01\nand erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentration greater than\ndeficiency was defined as serum B12\nblood cell folate was used for those who were seen in the\nmobile examination center, and serum folate was used as the\nindicator of folate status for those in the modified home\nexamination with phlebotomy, since red blood cell folate\nwas not measured in the home visits. Nutritional anemia was\ndefined as anemia due to either iron deficiency, folate\ndeficiency or deficiency in vitamin B12\n. Among anemic\nadults, the anemia due to chronic inflammation was\ndefined as serum iron o60 mg dl\u00c01, creatinine clearance\nX30 ml min\u00c01 and no evidence of iron deficiency. Anemia\ndue to renal disease was defined in the presence of creatinine\nclearance o30 ml min\u00c01. Unexplained anemia was defined\nas anemia that was not due to iron, folate or vitamin B12\ndeficiencies or due to the anemia of chronic inflammation or\nrenal disease. The quartiles of selenium were based upon all\nparticipants aged 65 or greater and were defined with cutoffs\nThe National Center for Health Statistics was the source for\nthe original data files used in this analysis (US Department of\nHealth and Human Services, 1996). Prevalence rates and\ndistributions were estimated for the US population using\nprobability weights specific to NHANES III. Descriptive\nstatistics were used to characterize the study population,\nprovide information on the distribution of biochemical\nmeasurements of micronutrients and calculate the preva-\nlence of deficiencies. w2- and trend tests were used to\nexamine the associations between anemia and dichotomized\ncovariates. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression\nwas used to examine the relationship between selenium\nand anemia, with sequential models adjusting for demo-\ngraphic, chronic disease, nutritional and inflammation\nvariables that were significant (Po0.05) in univariate\nanalyses. Selenium was transformed by loge\nto achieve a\nnormal distribution. To assess the relative strength of\nassociations between selenium and anemia, odds ratios and\n95% confidence intervals (CIs) associated with one standard\ndeviation increase in loge\nselenium were reported. Simple\nand multiple linear regression was used to examine the\nrelationship of selenium and other risk factors with hemo-\nglobin. Variables that were associated with hemoglobin at a\nlevel of Po0.05 were included as covariates in final multi-\nvariate linear regression models. Standardized b's were\nalso reported for each predictor to show the strength of\nthe associations.\nSerum selenium and anemia\nRD Semba et al\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nResults\n2 of NHANES III who had measurements of hemoglobin,\nserum selenium and other blood tests to characterize the\nwere anemic. The main characteristics of study participants\nare shown in Table 1 according to anemia status. Compared\nto participants who were not anemic, those anemic were\ndisease (Po0.0001). Serum selenium levels were lower in\nanemic compared with non-anemic adults (P \u00bc 0.0003).\nThere were borderline differences in body mass index (BMI)\nbetween anemic and non-anemic adults (P \u00bc 0.09), and no\nsignificant differences in the prevalence of smoking, hyper-\ntension, congestive heart failure, stroke, angina, cancer,\nmyocardial infarction and cardiovascular disease. The pre-\nvalence of anemia was highest in the lowest quartile and\nlowest in the highest quartile of serum selenium (Figure 1).\nMultivariate logistic regression models were used to\nexamine the relationship between different risk factors and\nanemia (Table 2). Selenium was strongly and independently\nassociated with anemia in models adjusted for demographic\nfactors (model 2) and demographic factors and chronic\ndiseases (model 3). Multiple linear regression models\nwere also used to examine the relationship between\nserum selenium and hemoglobin (Table 3). Selenium was\nsignificantly associated with hemoglobin in a model\nthat was adjusted for demographic factors (model 2). In\nmodel 2, for example, each one-unit increase in loge\nselenium was associated with an increase of 7.39 g l\u00c01\nhemoglobin, and male was associated with a 10.09 g l\u00c01\nincrease in hemoglobin. A level of education o12 years was\nassociated with a decrease of 0.98 g l\u00c01 of hemoglobin.\nSelenium was related to hemoglobin in a final model\n(model 3) (P \u00bc 0.06) that was adjusted for demographic\nfactors, BMI and chronic diseases.\nAmong the 270 anemic participants, the proportion of\nanemia due to nutritional causes, chronic inflammation,\nand 27.4%, respectively.

The proportion of adults\nwho were in the lowest quartile of serum selenium in the\ncategories of non-anemic and anemia due to nutritional\ncauses, chronic inflammation and/or renal disease, and\nunexplained anemia are shown in Figure 2. The highest\nproportion of participants with low selenium was in those\nwith anemia due to nutritional causes and anemia due to\nrenal disease.\nDiscussion\nThis study shows that low serum selenium is an independent\nrisk factor for anemia among older men and women living in\nthe community in the United States. Low selenium has not\nusually been considered as a possible cause of anemia in\nonly been previously implicated in anemia among patients\non hemodialysis (Hampel et al., 1985) or with pulmonary\ntuberculosis (van Lettow et al., 2005). However, a correlation\nbetween low plasma selenium concentrations and low\nhemoglobin had already been noted in the British National\nDiet and Nutrition Survey among 1134 men and women\nrecently low serum selenium was found to be associated with\nanemia among older disabled women living in the commu-\nA potential biological mechanism by which low selenium\ncould contribute to anemia is through maintenance of an\noptimal concentration of glutathione peroxidase, a key\nantioxidant selenoenzyme, in erythrocytes (Chow and\nChen, 1980). Glutathione peroxidase protects hemoglobin\nagainst oxidation in erythrocytes (Nagababu et al., 2003).\nAlthough there is little direct evidence that serum selenium\nis related to erythrocyte and hemoglobin stability in hu-\nmans, there is a possible relevant example of erythrocyte\ndamage due to increased oxidative stress in animals (McPhail\nand Sibbald, 1992) with protection by selenium. Livestock\nthat forage on Brassica (mustard, rape) are susceptible to\nbrassica anemia in which oxidative stress causes excessive\nerythrocyte damage (Prache, 1994), and selenium supple-\nmentation has been shown to protect animals against\n1998). If low serum selenium levels are associated with\nreduced lifespan of erythrocytes in humans, then it would be\nanticipated that selenium deficiency would be associated\nTable 2 Multivariate logistic regression models of risk factors for anemia\nVariable ORa 95% CI P-value\nBody mass index (kg m\u00c02)b\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence intervals; OR, odds ratio.\naOR per 1 s.d. increase in loge\nselenium.\nTable 3 Multiple linear regression models of selenium and other risk\nfactors with hemoglobin (g dl\u00c01) as the outcome, among adults X65\nVariable Coefficient s.e.

Studies in selenium-deficient pigs suggest that\nselenium deficiency limits erythropoiesis but does not affect\nred cell half-life (Fontaine et al., 1977). Further studies are\nneeded to examine this issue.\nAnother mechanism by which selenium could potentially\ncontribute to anemia is through modulation of inflamma-\ntion. Low serum selenium concentrations were found in\nadults with anemia of chronic inflammation. Low serum\nselenium concentrations among disabled older women\nliving in the community were predictive of subsequent rises\nin interleukin (IL)-6 (Walston et al., 2006). Thus, selenium\ncould potentially play a role in the anemia of chronic\ninflammation through its relationship with the upregulation\nof IL-6 through the redox-sensitive transcription factor\nnuclear factor-kB. In turn, IL-6 has been implicated in the\nupregulation of hepcidin, the iron regulatory hormone that\nblocks iron absorption in the gut and iron release from\nmacrophages and the liver (Roy and Andrews, 2005). The\nrole of hepcidin in the anemia of chronic inflammation is\nnot well understood, and little is known is about the\nrelationship between selenium levels, hepcidin and anemia.\nAnother possible mechanism by which selenium could be\ninvolved in the pathogenesis of anemia is through heme\noxygenase-1. Low selenium status can upregulate the activity\nof hepatic heme oxygenase-1, which catalyzes the initial step\nof heme catabolism and reduces heme to biliverdin, carbon\nmonoxide and free divalent iron (Mostert et al., 2003; Tron\net al., 2005). Whether upregulation of heme oxygenase-1\nCharacteristicsb,c Non-anemic Anemia due to nutritional\ncauses\nAnemia of chronic\ninflammation\nAnemia due to\nrenal disease\nUnexplained\nanemia\nP-value\nBody mass index (kg m\u00c02, %)\nChronic diseases (%)\nCongestive heart\naWeighted analysis for all means and percentages using NHANES III weights.\nbMean (s.e.) for age and hemoglobin.\ncGeometric mean (CI) for selenium.\nNon-Anemic Nutritional\nCauses\nAnemia Chronic\nInflammation\nRenal\nDisease\nUnexplained\nAnemia\n%\nFigure 2 Proportion of adults X65 years in the lowest selenium\nSerum selenium and anemia\nRD Semba et al\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition\nplays a role in the relationship of low serum selenium to\nanemia is not known.\nGiven that the study design of NHANES III is cross-\nsectional, the direction of the association between low serum\nselenium levels and anemia cannot be absolutely deter-\nmined. It is possible that anemia causes low serum selenium\nconcentrations through some uncharacterized mechanism,\nbut there is less evidence to support such a biological\nexplanation. The data from animal studies suggest that\nselenium deficiency causes anemia (Rotruck et al., 1972;\n1998), but whether the same biological mechanism is found\nin humans would need to be determined by well-designed\ncontrolled clinical trials.\nIn this study, low levels of serum selenium occurred across\nall types of anemia. Anemia in older adults is multifactorial,\nand according to one hypothesized mechanism, a reduced\nhalf-life of erythrocytes related to low selenium could\npredispose in a general way to anemia. The association\nbetween low serum selenium and anemia may reflect the\ncomplex multisystem decline that occurs with aging and\nmay possibly be caused by diverse biological mechanisms\nrather than the specific mechanisms described above.\nThe dietary intake of selenium varies widely worldwide, as\nselenium concentrations in plant-based foods reflect the\nconcentrations of selenium in the soil where the plants were\ngrown. The selenium concentrations in animal sources of\nfood, in turn, depend upon the selenium content of the\nplants used for forage, or whether animal feed was fortified\nwith selenium. Clinical selenium deficiency is rare and is\nseen in Keshan disease, an endemic cardiomyopathy found\nin low-selenium areas of China where affected persons may\nNutrition Board, 2000). The current dietary requirements\nfor selenium by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute\nof Medicine are based in part upon maintenance of optimal\nlevels of selenoproteins in blood, especially plasma\nglutathione peroxidase (Food and Nutrition Board, 2000).\nThe selenium requirement for prevention of chronic\ndisease has not yet been definitively determined (Thomson,\n2004). In addition, the selenium requirements for older\nadults are largely extrapolations from the middle-aged\npopulation (Thomson, 2004). The activity of glutathione\nperoxidase appears to be optimal when serum selenium\ngreater (Food and Nutrition Board, 2000). The baseline\nserum selenium concentrations at which there appeared to\nbe a protective effect of selenium supplementation against\n2004). It is notable that in the present study, the highest\nprevalence of anemia was found among older subjects from\nNHANES III who were in the lowest quartile of serum\nselenium, which was o1.33 mmol l\u00c01 and would be consid-\nered in the suboptimal range. It has been previously reported\nthat 13.8% of NHANES III participants were taking supple-\nments that contained selenium, but that serum selenium\nvalues were not significantly associated with taking a\nsupplement that contained selenium (Niskar et al., 2003).\nExcept for overt clinical selenium deficiency, the health\nconsequences of an inadequate selenium intake are incom-\npletely understood, and further work is needed to define\noptimal selenium status in the elderly population.\nIn conclusion, low serum selenium was independently\nassociated with anemia among older men and women living\nin the community. This study raises a potentially important\npublic health question: has selenium deficiency been over-\nlooked as a cause of anemia among older adults? This study\nmay represent a first important step toward determining\nwhether selenium deficiency is a potential cause of anemia\namong older adults. To our knowledge, it is not known\nwhether improving dietary selenium intake will increase\nhemoglobin concentrations among older adults with\nlow serum selenium concentrations. Further work is needed\nto corroborate these findings in other populations, provide\nevidence for longitudinal causal associations, identify\nunderlying biological mechanisms and determine whether\nimproving selenium status has an impact upon anemia in\nolder adults.\nThis study was sponsored by National Institute on Aging,\nand Intramural Research Branch).\nReferences\nBalducci L (2003).
