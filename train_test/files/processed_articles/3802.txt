Founded on the rationality of citizen participa-\ntion and democracy, devolution policies have not only\nchallenged the morality of centralized systems of resource\ngovernance as theorized by Hardin (1968) but also ques-\ntioned its very efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability.\nDemocracy literature, in particular, presents decentralization\nas a tool to achieving the trinity goals of good governance,\ndevelopment, and poverty reduction. The drive for decentral-\nization is also strengthened by disappointing record of cen-\ntralized development planning and justified on the basis that\npolitical governance cannot be separated from economic\ntion policies contest the state's incentives and capability to\nmanage local natural resources efficiently, sustainably, and\nalia, empirical evidence revealed that state management of\nnatural resources has been characterized by limited respon-\nsiveness to the needs of local communities, increased social\nand economic inequality among local communities, destruc-\ntion of indigenous natural resource management knowledge,\nand lack of downward accountability in resource use (Lee,\n2002). Thus, participatory school of thought particularly\nadvocates reducing the size of government by decentralizing\nmanagement of common pool resources to local communi-\nties (Meinzen-Dick et al., 2000; Restrepo, Vermillion, &\nCurrent policy shifts toward decentralized democratic\nnatural resource governance in developing countries are,\nhowever, implemented against a long legacy of autocratic\nrule from both state and traditional actors (Mamdani, 1996).\nAccording to Mamdani (1996), since independence, man-\nagement of natural resources was grabbed by the state and\ntraditional authorities in what he calls \"bifurcated\" approach\n(see also Blaikie, 2006).

While some are more optimistic\nargue that its outcomes remain disappointing (Blaikie, 2006).\nTo what extent then do the theoretical claims about the suc-\ncess of decentralized natural resources hold in practice? In\nothers words, has institutional engineering failed to institute\ndemocratic natural resource governance?\nEmploying the lens of state\u00adsociety relations, especially\nformal\u00adinformal institutional interaction model, this study\nresponds to these questions by examining the challenges\nassociated with the process of crafting institutional frame-\nwork and governance structures for decentralized natural\nresource governance. Using Domasi and Njala Irrigation\nschemes as case studies, the study's crucial questions to be\naddressed are as follows: What were the guiding principles\nin crafting rules to guide resource use in the two irrigation\nschemes? To what extent has the current attempts at demo-\ncratic natural resource governance managed to emancipate\nlocal communities from the control of the state and tradi-\ntional actors? and What institutional forces explain the con-\ndition of decentralized resource governance at the two sites?\nIn general, therefore, the study intends to explore the ade-\nquacy of the formulated democratic institutions in achieving\nthe objectives of good natural resource governance as mea-\nsured by the following variables:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Access and equity: fair distribution and allocation of\nresources--irrigation plots and water resources.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Transparency and accountability: the imperative to\nmake elected leaders answerable for their public\nbehavior as well as responsive to the entity from\nwhich they derive their authority. It includes the distri-\nbution of power and status among local farmers as\nevidenced by participation in decision making and in\nelections, observance of resource users' rights, and\nrespect for resource users' democratic views.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Predictability and rule of law: the existence of laws,\nregulations, and policies to regulate society and their\nfair and consistent application to resource use.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Conflict resolution: air handling and resolving of con-\nflicts and disputes over resources among resource\nusers and other surrounding local and national entities\nand actors.\nThere is a growing literature on decentralized natural\nresource governance internationally and locally (see Blaikie,\nmost of these studies have concentrated on the historical evo-\nlution and outcomes of CBNRM and not the theoretical anal-\nysis guiding the evolution. In particular, the theoretical\ndilemma and outcomes of the interaction between, first, state\nand society, and formal and informal institutions after policy\nshift have not been adequately explored. This gap makes this\nstudy unique.\nConceptualizing Decentralization\nDecentralization is a complex process with numerous and at\ntimes confusing definitions (Adamolekun, 1991; Smoke,\n2003). Broadly defined, decentralization is the transfer of\npolitical, administrative, and legal authority, or responsibil-\nity for planning, decision making, resource allocation, and\nadministering public functions from the central government\nto its field, district, and regional administrative units; semi-\nautonomous and parastatal organizations or even nongovern-\nmental organizations (NGOs) or voluntary associations of\npeople; and private entities (see Adamolekun, 1991; Smoke,\n2003). Generally, there are four forms of decentralization\nclassified based on their objectives, namely, political, admin-\nistrative, spatial, and market (Cohen & Peterson, 1996;\nSmoke, 2003). Political decentralization, which is largely the\nfocus of this article, is concerned with transfer of decision-\nmaking power to lower level of government units or to citi-\nzens or their elected representatives. A good example of\npolitical decentralization is devolution, which refers to trans-\nfer of governance responsibility for specified functions to\nsubnational levels outside the direct control of the central\ngovernment (Adamolekun, 1991). Administrative decentral-\nization, divided into deconcentration and delegation, is the\nhierarchical and functional distribution of powers and func-\ntions between central government and noncentral govern-\nment. Deconcentration is the transfer of administrative\nresponsibility for specified functions to lower levels within\nthe central government bureaucracy (Tambulasi & Kayuni,\n2007). In other words, it is the redistribution of government\nadministrative responsibility within central government min-\nistries or agency and involves sharing central government\nwith offices outside the national capital. In a deconcentra-\ntion, local staffs do not possess any authority to make deci-\nsion on their own, but are under the technical supervision and\ncontrol of the central government. Delegation is the transfer\nof government decision making and responsibilities to orga-\nnizations and institutions, which enjoy varying degrees of\nautonomy vis-\u00e0-vis central government ministries such as\nparastatal or public corporations (Adamolekun, 1991; Cohen\n& Peterson, 1996). Spatial decentralization entails efforts at\nreducing excessive urban concentration in a few large cities\nby promoting regional growth poles that have potential to\nbecome centers of manufacturing and agricultural marketing\n(Cohen & Peterson, 1996). Market decentralization focuses\non shifting the responsibility of providing public goods from\nthe state to private firms, community groups, cooperatives,\nand NGOs. It is broadly perceived as the creation of condi-\ntions that allow goods and services to be produced and pro-\nvided by market mechanisms sensitive to the preferences of\nindividuals. This form of decentralization has become preva-\nlent with global establishment of liberalization and privatiza-\nMerits and Demerits of Decentralization:\nTheoretical and Empirical Perspectives\nDecentralization is, inter alia, justified based on its per-\nceived administrative, political, and economic benefits.\nAdministrative objectives are mainly concerned with the best\napproach to organizing development activities to achieve\nadministrative convenience and efficiency. The former cen-\nters on making appropriate decision, whereas the latter is\nabout best resource allocation. The argument is that local\ngovernments are better placed to achieve administrative con-\nvenience and efficiency than central government because\nthey are closer to local communities; thus, they can be more\nsensitive in the identification of development priority needs.\nFrom an economic perspective, local governments are\nregarded to be in a better position to raise local revenue to\nimplement local projects as local communities will be moti-\nvated to fund and monitor their own development cause\nobjective of decentralization is the achievement of good and\ndemocratic governance. Good governance signifies creation\nof proper law and order, elimination of unnecessary govern-\nment interference, and establishment of corrupt free public\nadministration as a means of achieving socioeconomic prog-\non the contrary, refers to the recognition of political, civil\nrights, and citizen participation as basic values and develop-\nment end in themselves (Abdellatif, 2003; Elahi &\ntion that, depending on their aims, different actors vary in\ntheir orientations to these two concepts, preferring to use\neither good governance or democratic governance.\nThe economic objective of decentralization centers\naround three things, namely, economic efficiency, resource\nmobilization, and service and product quality. The under-\nstanding is that economic efficiency is increased as citizens\nbecome committed to development plans they have been\ninvolved in identification. Resource mobilization, on the\ncontrary, is improved as people become motivated and will-\ning to contribute to local development programs. Finally,\nquality of service and product increases as a result of compe-\ntition and choice among local government units. The assump-\ntion is that citizens would choose where to locate themselves\nto take advantage of the quality and cost differentials\npointed out that the administrative, political, and economic\nobjectives of decentralization can hardly be fully achieved in\nisolation. It is also strongly argued that implementing devo-\nlution on its own strengthens top-down political dominance.\nThis recognition, therefore, calls into question the kind of\ndecentralization that can be implemented to achieve decen-\ntralized natural resource governance.\nTheoretical arguments for decentralization notwithstand-\ning, increased literature has shown that decentralization is\nnot a panacea to all challenges of economic development.\nFirst, decentralization has inherent theoretical flaws in\naccounting for its benefits, especially when applied to devel-\noping countries. Decentralization also has the potential of\npromoting a sense of locality or regional belonging resulting\nin heightened tribal and neopatrimonial tendencies\nis faulted on its potential to cement already hostile ethnic and\nregional groupings prevalent in the country; and continue to\nprovide a platform for tribal neopatrimonial tendencies.\nSecond, conditions within developing countries do not allow\nfull enjoyment of the benefits provided by decentralization.\nFor instance, high poverty levels in most countries limit pref-\nerence differentiation, making the question of administrative\nefficiency irrelevant. Equally important, the economic objec-\ntive of quality service provision is defeated by the fact that\ncosts in developing countries are not related to competing\nlocal governments, and citizens do not really have choice of\nto these two theoretical and conditional blocks, decentraliza-\ntion suffers from design and implementation problems such\nas budget deficits, fiscal irresponsibility, and local elite cap-\nture of the development agenda (Smoke, 2003). The crucial\nquestion for this study is the extent to institutional engineer-\ning for decentralized resource governance has provided\nanswers to escape from these shortfalls.\nObjectives of Decentralized Natural Resource\nGovernance\nDecentralized natural resource governance has generally\nfour main objectives, namely, as a means to achieving\ndecentralization and local empowerment, as a means to\nreducing government expenditure on resource management,\nas a means to instituting sustainable resource use, and as a\nmeans to reducing rampart poverty among local communi-\nresource governance as a means to achieving decentraliza-\ntion and local empowerment is mainly supported by interna-\ntional organizations and financial institutions that perceive\nparticipation as a sure way to local empowerment. To this\nend, processes of decentralizing natural resource gover-\nnance have involved radical institutional reform in line with\nthe principles of democracy and decentralization. Political\ndecentralization involving establishment of institutions of\nelected representatives is seen as a precondition for achiev-\ning local democratic governance (Ribot, 2004). Democracy\n4 SAGE Open\nliterature, in particular, presents decentralization as a good\ntool to achieving the trinity of good governance, develop-\nment, and poverty reduction. This view is reinforced by the\nunsettled dichotomous views regarding the role of tradi-\ntional and formal institutions in promoting local democracy.\nSome scholars consider traditional institutions as antitheti-\ncal to the development of democracy (Mamdani, 1996),\nwhereas others argue that traditional institutions can suc-\ncessfully coexist with democratic forms of government.\nThere is also increased consensus among scholars that the\nmain impetus toward decentralization came from the fiscal\ncrisis of the state (Blaikie, 2006). Global economic crisis\nespecially in the early 1980s resulted in governments failing\nto meet the costs of monitoring resource use and maintain-\ning resource facilities.\nDecentralized natural resource governance as a means to\ninstituting sustainable utilization of local resources rose from\na growing realization that state management of natural\nIt is generally designed to achieve resource sustainability\nthrough social and economic incentives to local users who\nhave for long time been blamed for resource depletion and\ndestruction. Rather than being new, decentralized resource\ngovernance is a modern attempt to revive the traditional\ninstitutionalized mechanisms for managing and conserving\nthe natural environment (Kellert, Mehta, Ebbin, &\nLichtenfeld, 2000). The new approach is uphold by the evi-\ndence that local people have the capacity to manage their\ncommon pool resources efficiently, sustainably, and equita-\nretical shifts in the game theories and democratic governance,\nthough practice is largely driven by the latter (Agrawal,\nLast, there are widespread claims, especially among\ndevelopment practitioners, that the main objective of\ndecentralized natural resource governance is poverty\nreduction of the local people. This objective has gained\nground with the present understanding that poverty does\nnot only relate to lack of physical assets but also social\nand political capacity (Lee, 2002). In other words, the\napproach improves the local people's well-being physi-\ncally, socially, and politically through improving their\naccess to resources, social interaction, and good local\ngovernance, respectively. Thus, the drive for decentraliza-\ntion is justified on the basis that political governance can-\nnot be separated from economic governance (Bradhan,\ncism about the real objectives of decentralized natural\nresource governance. A number of scholars argue that\ndecentralized natural resource governance is a ploy to\npacify local communities into accepting the broader aim\nof protecting local resources from which they would con-\ntinue to be excluded (Blaikie, 2006; Ferguson & Mulwafu,\nTheoretical Context\nCase Study Background Information\nHistorically, Malawi inherited and continued with strong\nstate intervention into natural resources management as\nbacked by the colonial legacy that doubted the ability of\nlocal communities to efficiently manage their resources\n(Ferguson & Mulwafu, 2004; see also Fairhead & Leach,\n1995). Thus, most natural resources, including forests, wild\nlife, and water resources, were brought under direct state\ncontrol. In the case of irrigation water management, all for-\nmal public irrigation schemes were strictly put under state\nmanagement. However, a plethora of factors, including\nfinancial constraints, rendered state management of public\nirrigation schemes inefficient and ineffective (Blaikie, 2006;\nline with global political moves toward decentralization and\npublic participation in resource management, the\nGovernment of Malawi (GoM) promulgated policy legisla-\ntion for community management of irrigation of public irri-\ngation schemes. The National Irrigation Policy and\nDevelopment Strategy (GoM, 2000) and Irrigation Act\n(GoM, 2001), in particular, reflect this goal by \"promoting\nfull ownership of public irrigation schemes by the beneficia-\nries through their legally constituted local organizations that\nwill oversee all matters related to operation and mainte-\nnance of these schemes\" (GoM, 2000, p. 7). Likewise, the\nIrrigation Act (2001) vests legal authority in a group of\nsmall-scale farmers to own, use, and maintain the schemes.\nThe formulation of management structure in the irrigation\nsector was aimed at decentralizing and restructuring water\nresource governance to cut off dictates of the state and its\nagencies, especially local chiefs. The course taken was\nbased on the understanding that in Malawi, and many other\ncountries in Africa, traditional authorities have been histori-\ncally undemocratic, unaccountable, and autocratic agents of\nNtsebeza, 2005). Thus, local chiefs were barred from active\ninvolvement in the management of irrigation scheme.\nInstead, the schemes are managed by individuals elected\namong the community members. This view was premised\non the idea that institutional arrangement that is led by\nelected leaders would lead to institution of democratic\ngovernance.\nThus, the most debatable aspect of institutional engineer-\ning for decentralized natural resource governance in Malawi\nis whether the exclusion of the state and traditional leaders for\nelected leaders have resulted in the establishment of demo-\ncratic natural resource governance. In Malawi, local chiefs\nhave been the state's trusted agent and have been actively\ninvolved in natural resources management (see Blaikie, 2006;\nFerguson & Mulwafu, 2004). During one-party autocratic\nrule, in particular, local chiefs were actively involved in the\nmanagement of public irrigation schemes. Thus, this study\nalso addresses the unsettled debate of whether traditional\ninstitutions are antithetical to development of democracy\n(Mamdani, 1996) or support democracy (United Nations\nEconomic Commission forAfrica [UNECA], 2007). It should\nbe pointed that the context for decentralized natural resources\nmanagement in Malawi reveals a gamut of local and external\nactors, namely, elected leaders, traditional leaders, local com-\nmunities, and the state. Thus, the new institutional arrange-\nment presents a potential conflict between the state and\ntraditional leaders, on one hand, and new elected Water User\nAssociation (WUA) leaders, on the other.\nState\u00adSociety Relations and Formal\u00adInformal\nInstitution Interaction Model\nIt is against the backdrop that regime change in natural\nresources management changes the state\u00adsociety relations\nthat this study adopts the theory of state\u00adsociety relations\nand formal\u00adinformal interaction model. State\u00adsociety rela-\ntions is defined as\ninteractions between state institutions and societal groups to\nnegotiate how public authority is exercised and how it can be\ninfluenced by people. They are focused on issues such as defining\nthe mutual rights and obligations of state and society, negotiating\nhow public resources should be allocated and establishing\ndifferent modes of representation and accountability. (Department\nBroadly, there are two main assumptions within state\u00adsoci-\nety relations. The first assumption views state and society as\ndichotomous and mutually exclusive, whereas the second\nassumption perceives the relations as an aggregation of the\ninherently unproblematic spheres (Seller, 2010). According\nto Seller (2010), state is an \"institutionalized collective\npower superordinate to other organizations that is sovereign\nvis a vis other states, autonomous or distinct from the rest of\nsociety, and identified socioculturally with a national collec-\ntivity\" (p. 4). Society, on the contrary, is defined as a condi-\ntion of living in association or an organized community\n(Mitchneck, 2011). The relevancy of this framework to this\nstudy is that institutional engineering restructures arrange-\nments under which these relations operate, thus potentially\nbringing tension and negotiations between the two actors.\nThe two major assumptions guiding state\u00adsociety rela-\ntions are explored further within the formal\u00adinformal institu-\ntional interaction model. According to Helmke and Levitsky\n(2004), formal\u00adinformal interaction model explains the\nnature and outcomes of interaction between formal and\ninformal institutions. Institutions are rules of the game or\nhumanly devised constraints that shape human interaction in\nsociety (Knowles, 2006). Formal\u00adinformal interaction model\nfocuses on the nature of relationships between formal and\ninformal institutions and their outcomes. In the case of this\nstudy, the relationships are between elected WUA leaders, on\none hand, and the traditional and religious leaders, on the\nother hand.\nThe formal\u00adinformal institution interaction model reso-\nnates very well with institutional context created in institut-\ning decentralized natural resource governance in the\nirrigation sector in Malawi. From the perspective of develop-\nment practitioners, existence of democratic management\nstructure project a positive-sum game with regard to achiev-\nview is, however, theoretically simplistic. Although institu-\ntional theory can help understand the outcomes of decentral-\nized natural resource governance, it is limited in a historical\ncontext where neither formal nor informal institutions exists\nin isolation (Mamdani, 1996). Again, there is a strong belief\nthat many rules of the game that structure and guide people's\nlife are informal institutions that are created, communicated,\nand enforced outside officially sanctioned channels (Helmke\ninteraction model is critical to explaining interaction between\nthe formal and informal institutions and also state\u00adsociety\nactors. The application of this model is empirically supported\nby Meinzen-Dick et al. (2000), who noted that collective\naction for natural resource management does not necessarily\nrequire a formal organization.\nInformal institutions are defined as socially shared rules,\nusually unwritten, that are created, communicated, and\nenforced outside officially sanctioned channels, whereas\ninformal institutions are rules and procedures that are cre-\nated, communicated, and enforced through channels widely\naccepted as official. In the case of natural resource gover-\nnance, this mainly relates to state recognized constitutions,\nlaws, regulations, and organization rules (Helmke &\ninteraction model bridges the dichotomous functional\u00addys-\nfunctional view about informal institutions (see Ntsebeza,\n2005). The model proposes four typologies of informal insti-\ntutions based on convergence and divergence of institutional\noutcomes and effectiveness of formal institutions, namely,\ncomplementary, accommodating, substitutive, and compet-\ning. Complementary informal institutions combine effective\nformal rules and convergent outcomes and fill the formal\ninstitutional gap. Accommodating informal institutions com-\nbine effective formal institutions and divergent outcomes by\ncreating incentives to alter the outcomes of formal rules.\nSubstitutive informal institutions combine ineffective formal\ninstitutions and compatible outcomes. Competing informal\ninstitutions combine ineffective formal rules and divergent\noutcomes, producing competing informal institutions such as\nclientelism, patrimonial, clan politics, and corruption (Merry,\n1988). This model is relevant in the explaining outcomes of\nnatural resource governance in areas experiencing power and\nresponsibility transfer from government to communities. In\nMalawi, devolution of responsibility from government to\nlocal farmers has been associated with establishment of for-\nmal rules and regulations that are formally recognized by the\n6 SAGE Open\nstate (Ferguson & Mulwafu, 2004). However, informal\nactors are having a lot of influence at a local level (Zuka,\n2013). Therefore, as theorized in the Helmke and Levitsky,\nthe success of the community management of irrigation\nschemes depends on the complex interaction between formal\nand informal institutions within the broader state\u00adsociety\nrelations.\nMethod\nThis study was conducted in two smallholder irrigation\nschemes of Domasi and Njala in Southern Malawi. Domasi\nscheme is 500 ha while Njala scheme is 45 ha. Both irriga-\ntion schemes grow rice during rainy and dry seasons. The\ntwo areas were considered appropriate for this study because\nof two reasons. First, both of them were under state manage-\nment and have devolved management responsibility to farm-\ners following the promulgation of the 2001 Irrigation Act.\nThus, they present good examples of natural resources under\nelected local actors. Second, their institutional arrangement\nfit into the analytical design for assessing decentralized natu-\nral resource governance as they have both formally formu-\nirrigation farmers at Domasi and Njala irrigation schemes,\nrespectively.\nThis study adopted both quantitative and qualitative\napproaches to investigate the processes and outcomes of\ninstitutional engineering for decentralized natural resource\ngovernance in Malawi. Quantitative data were used to\nexplain quantitative trends such as number of plots owned by\nfarmers. The qualitative approach was employed in collect-\ning data relating to examining the processes of crafting insti-\ntutional framework for decentralized natural resource\ngovernance; and assessing performance challenges associ-\nated with this framework. Qualitative approach is also ideal\nin examining the complex institutional interaction between\nstate and society; and between formal and informal institu-\ntions. In this study, formal institutions refer to a set of rules\nand regulations guiding decision about resource use, alloca-\ntion, and control as outlined in the WUA constitution.\nInformal institutions, on the contrary, refer to resource gov-\nernance rules, regulations, and practices outside the WUA\nconstitution. Most of these informal institutions are deeply\nrooted in local tradition (see Kambewa, 2005). Thus, WUA\nleaders were grouped as formal actors, whereas traditional\nand religious leaders grouped as informal actors.\nThe primary data were collected through key informant\ninterviews, focus group discussions (FGDs), and household\nsurvey. Key informant interviews were held with purposively\nselected respondents from WUA leaders, local chiefs, faith\nleaders (Sheikhs and Christian Pastors), and government offi-\ncials. A total of eight FGDs were conducted with irrigation\nfarmers at both Domasi and Njala irrigation schemes. Key\ninformant interviews and FGDs were specifically designed to\nassess the interaction between irrigation farmers, traditional\nleaders, WUA executive members, and government officials.\nThe discussions were also designed to assess institutional per-\nformance in terms of regulating access to resource and its\nefficient use. The study surveyed and interviewed a total of\n106 and 50 households at Domasi and Njala, respectively.\nThese households were selected using simple random sam-\npling, and semistructured questionnaires were used to collect\ndata. The household survey was aimed at assessing farmers'\nmode and equality of access to irrigation plots and water\nresource. Furthermore, the study employed participant and\nfield observation in which a number of WUA meetings were\nattended to understand the nature of interaction between\nWUA leaders, local chiefs, and farmers.\nEmpirical Findings\nInstitutional Framework for Irrigation Scheme\nManagement: Crash of Interest\nBoth Domasi and Njala Irrigation schemes are managed by\nWUA comprising different committees, namely, the\nExecutive, Discipline, Health, Water, Finance, Auditing,\nMarketing, and Environment. According to the constitutions\nof the two irrigation schemes, WUA leaders are elected at a\ngeneral meeting every 3 years and that every legitimate\nmember of the association is allowed to stand for any post\nexcept for the posts of chairperson, secretary, and treasurer,\nwhich are reserved for people who know how to read and\nwrite. However, the findings of this study revealed that the\nprocess of electing leaders has been marred by a lot of irregu-\nlarities largely emanating from the unconstitutional agree-\nments between local chiefs and the elected WUA leaders.\nFirst, elections are not regularly conducted as the last one\nwas held in 1999 and at a time of this study, farmers doubted\nthe probability of holding elections soon. This status quo is\nuphold by the support from traditional chiefs and religious\nleaders who argue that elections are not needed as they do\nnot have problems with the current leadership. Second, the\nprocess of scrutinizing candidates for the top WUA positions\nis less democratic. Instead, unconstitutional relations\nbetween WUA executive members and local chiefs have cre-\nated a parallel committee for vetoing out individuals thought\nto be a threat to their local relationship. Generally, local\nchiefs and WUA executive take advantage of the ambiguous\nconstitutional requirements for individuals willing to run for\nWUA elected positions, namely, good behavior; able to read\nand write for the positions of president, secretary, and trea-\nsurer; and trustworthy and a committed local farmer. The\nfirst step in electing leaders involves individual's declaration\nof interest to stand for election. The names of interested indi-\nviduals, together with a list of farmers supporting their intent,\nare then forwarded to outgoing WUA executive who scruti-\nnizes their names with the help of local chiefs to see whether\nthey qualify. After this exercise, outgoing WUA executive\nreleases the names of those who are going to compete for the\ntop positions. All other positions are also supposed to be\nelected during the general meeting. This procedure seems to\nbe democratic on face value.\nHowever, consultations with farmers revealed that local\nchiefs and influential people have a lot of influence on the\nchoice of leaders. For instance, consultations revealed that\nsome of the candidates are rejected by traditional and reli-\ngious leaders on the premise that they do not have the inter-\nests of the local people at heart. The study revealed that\nfailure to get endorsement from the local and religious lead-\ners is enough reason for individuals to lose elections as local\nfarmers fear to be associated with persons not approved by\ntheir local chiefs. In particular, farmers fear being labeled\nacting against the local chiefs and those in authority. For\ninstance, farmers revealed that during the elections held in\n1999, individuals who contested on position of president\nwere just dictated to irrigation farmers by the local chiefs. In\nthis case, those people who contest and get elected for top\npositions are generally individuals favored by the local chiefs\nand, therefore, elites within this social system (see also\nNtsebeza, 2004). This situation is ironically passively\naccepted by the state. According to the National Irrigation\nAct, the state through District Councils is responsible for\nholding elections. However, the District Council is not moni-\ntoring the operations of the two schemes arguing there is no\nneed to intervene if there are no problems. This situation\nunderscores the need for clearly highlighting the role of the\nstate in enforcing institutional adherence in the process of\nachieving decentralized resource governance (see Edigheji,\n2007). The findings from this study, therefore, demonstrate\nthat while existence of democratic structures have the poten-\ntial to stimulate democratic practice, state\u00adsociety relations\nand formal\u00adinformal interaction play a great deal in deter-\nmining the ultimate outcomes.\nMyths and Realities Surrounding Equitable Access\nto Natural Resources\nThe blurred positive-sum interaction between formal\u00adinfor-\nmal institutions at the two sites is made clearer when resource\ndistribution (irrigation plots and irrigation water) is consid-\nered. In theory, irrigation plot and irrigation water are sup-\nposed to be equally shared a priori adoption of community\nmanagement. However, unclear constitutional stipulation on\nimportant issues such as number of plots each farmer is\nlegally allowed to hold has resulted in high perceived cases\nof neopatrimonialism. For instance, while 85% of irrigation\nfarmers at Domasi hold less than four plots of irrigation land\n(each plot is 0.25 ha), there are about 15% of the farmers\nwho hold more than five to eight plots and 2.8% of the farm-\ners hold more than eight plots. Most of the people holding\nmore than eight plots at Domasi are leaders in WUA execu-\ntive, and local chiefs and their relations. Consultations with\nfarmers also indicated that head irrigation plots, which\nreceive a lot of irrigation water, are usually allocated to WUA\nexecutive leaders, local chiefs, and their relations, while\nlocal farmers are allocated tail irrigation plots. The local\nfarmers argued that \"there is favoritism in plot allocation.\nPlots closer to water are usually given to individuals related\nto WUA executive members and local chiefs.\"\nIt is worth pointing that regime change in irrigation man-\nagement has not changed the pattern of plot ownership\nThis study found that while irrigation plot access dispari-\nties have a long history in the one-party rule, they are cur-\nrently perpetuated by social and political power relations. In\nparticular, plot and water allocation is highly influenced by\nsocial and power relations that exist between WUA execu-\ntive members and local chiefs. Farmers reported that rela-\ntionship with local chiefs and WUA executive highly\nincreases individual's chances of acquiring a plot under \"the\npretext of respect for our community leaders.\" The social\nrelation refers to the individual farmer's relationship with the\nchiefs while the political relates to farmers' relationship with\nindividuals in the WUA executive. With regard to irrigation\nmanagement, the influence of local chiefs emanates from\ninherent authority of controlling community social life and\nsocial standing in the societies. It should also be pointed out\nthat there is weak boundary between social and political\nleaders referred to herein above. This is so as there is either\nstrong blood relation between influential WUA executive\nmembers and the local chiefs or the local chiefs themselves\nare WUA executive members. At Njala, for instance, the vice\npresident of WUA is the group village head, whereas at\nDomasi, the president of WUA is a brother to one of the most\ninfluential chiefs in the area. It is, therefore, unlikely that\ninequalities in irrigation plots ownership at Domasi and\nNjala can be addressed by merely putting in place demo-\ncratic structures. In the case of Domasi and Njala, compro-\nmise between competing formal (WUA executive) and\ninformal (local chiefs and religious leaders) institutions is\nreproducing undemocratic tendencies within the democratic\nstructures resulting in clientelism and patrimonialism (see\nEqually important, decentralized irrigation scheme\narrangements have not resulted in efficient management of\nthe water resource. This is so as water is a mobile resource,\nand entitlement is effective only when it is captured within\nthe users' resource system. In the case of Domasi and Njala,\nfarming activities upstream diverts a lot of water resulting in\nless water reaching the two schemes. This is despite both\nWUAs paying for water use withdrawal rights. This scenario\nunderscores the role of the state in regulating resource use\namong resource users spread over a vast geographical area\nand with different organizational arrangement (see Seller,\n2010). According to the consultations conducted, institu-\ntional gap between Domasi and Njala irrigation schemes, on\none hand, and water users upstream, on the other hand,\nmakes it difficult for water users to negotiate water use and\naddress silting up of the high stream. Findings from this\n8 SAGE Open\nstudy demonstrate that the major problem facing water use\nregulation between the two schemes and farmers upstream\noriginates from the fact that institutional engineering was\nlimited to geographical area covering the scheme. This\napproach ignored the fact that management of mobile\nresources requires institutional framework that addresses the\nresource system. Thus, decentralized resource governance\nrequires state\u00adsociety synergy, which would allow both the\nstate and society to mutually benefit from each other by\nreducing the cost of enforcing rules (Edigheji, 2007).\nDecentralized democratic natural resource governance is\nheralded as a means for poverty reduction. However, the sce-\nnario at Domasi and Njala paints a doubtful picture on, first,\nthe extent to which decentralized natural governance can\nachieve the goal of poverty reduction and, second, the extent\nto which democratic institutional structure can be relied upon\nin addressing resource inequalities. This is so as the absence\nof the state has weakened enforcement of law, and illegal ties\nbetween elected actors and traditional leaders have weakened\nthe checks and balances within the system. In the present sce-\nnario, ordinary farmers cannot have no room to hold elected\nleaders accountable. The challenge is that the traditional lead-\ners have long established social and cultural authority over\nthe affairs of the people in the area. Thus, to establish their\nauthority, local democratic institutions need not only the sup-\nport of local informal institutions but also policy support from\nthe state. The current dilemma is that relations between infor-\nmal institutions and formal democratic institutions quench off\npublic democratic consciousness cultivated through the cre-\nation of democratic institutions. For instance, interviewed\nfarmers in both areas indicated that they have lost trust in both\ntraditional leaders and elected WUA executive.\nDeceptive Mechanisms for Transparency and\nAccountability\nEmpowerment of local communities is one of the major\nobjectives of decentralized natural resource governance.\nThis involves instituting democratic resource governance\ncharacterized by resource users' participation in decision\nmaking, observance of resource users' constitutional rights,\nand transparent and accountable management system.\nMeasured against these variables, there is a lack of demo-\ncratic resource governance at Domasi and Njala. In terms of\nresource users' participation in resource governance, 68%\nand 96% of the farmers interviewed during household survey\nindicated that they did not take part in the formulation of\nrules governing resource use. Instead, they argued that the\nrules were formulated by the WUA executive, and members\nwere just informed about the rules. In terms of transparency\nand accountability, farmers lamented that WUA executive is\nnot presenting regular financial and audit reports of WUA\nfinance as provided for by their constitutions. In fact, at both\nsites, WUA executive could not produce even a single finan-\ncial audit report.\nThe trend of natural resource use governance at Domasi\nand Njala reveals that the process of institutional engineering\nwas captured by a few powerful local elites. Ironically, insti-\ntutional engineering at both sites was externally driven by\nthe state and international agencies to enforce democratic\npractice. In general, establishment of formal institutions was\nperceived to be prerequisite for successful decentralized\nresource governance. Thus, the focus of regime change was\non formulating written constitutions for the two schemes.\nHowever, as earlier indicated, most farmers were only\ninformed of the crafted constitutions. Lack of adequate farm-\ners' participation in the formulation of the constitution did\nnot only result into most farmers being ignorant of the con-\nstitutional provisions but also sowed seeds of resentment\nagainst the constitution. These findings reveal that mere cre-\nation of democratic arrangements was the main theoretical\nflaw that was made at inception. In particular, rolling back\nthe state and local informal actors was considered a proper\nmechanism to avoid their involvement.\nHowever, findings of this study reveal that WUA execu-\ntive and local chiefs have created power and benefit sharing\nrelationships that are not provided for in the constitutions.\nThe influence of the local chiefs on the management of irriga-\ntion schemes is also enhanced by the fact that, unlike WUA\nleadership, traditional authorities form part of the district\ndevelopment framework as they are members of the district\ndevelopment planning system. To this end, they are able to\nnegotiate matters relating to natural resource management\nwith the state in their favor. For instance, the state has still\nmaintained the role of local chiefs in customary land manage-\nment. Decentralized natural resource governance, therefore,\nrequires a holistic approach where all institutions interacting\nwith formally created governance institutions need to be not\nonly democratic but inclusive (see Manor, 2011). This institu-\ntional arrangement has the potential to allow informal institu-\ntions to evolve into a democracy as public consciousness for\ndemocracy will not be suffocated by rent-seeking tenden-\ncies. For instance, Shackleton, Campbell, Wollenberg, and\nEdmunds (2002) found that exclusion of traditional leaders\nfrom conservation committees in Namibia was counterpro-\nductive, resulting in conflict and delays until the chiefs were\nincorporated into committees (see also Bergstrand, 2003). In\nthe case of this study, while decentralized resource gover-\nnance can perceived to be stable at face value, it is character-\nized by a lot of reciprocity and exchange of favors that go\nagainst the principles of a democracy. This is as leaders\n(including local chiefs) have become accountable to govern-\nment and not local people (see also Manor, 2011). A good\nexample of these favors is a case in which a good market at\nDomasi was informally but effectively restricted by WUA\nexecutive to WUA executive members and local chiefs.\nEqually important, local chiefs reported attending WUA\nexecutive trainings and conferences not meant for them. It is\nunlikely that these tendencies can be corrected without out-\nside actors (preferably state) monitoring.\nCompromised Mechanism for Conflict Resolution\nThe other rationale for devolving management of natural\nresources comes from the idea that decentralized natural\nresource governance reduces conflicts as resource users\ncollectively monitor resource use and compliance to rules.\nDecentralization also makes resolution of conflicts easier\nas users employ local values and norms of cooperation. Yet,\nFGDs at Domasi and Njala reveal that the two sites experi-\nence a number of conflicts, including farmers' failure to\nturn up for collective work at the scheme, illegal water\ndiversions in the scheme, and farmers' failure to clean\ncanals. All these conflicts point to the failure of collective\naction, monitoring, and persuasion. This article argues that\nthese outcomes are as a result of failure to institute collec-\ntive action and conflict resolution. This is so as institutional\nengineering was implicitly guided by the view that putting\nin place democratic arrangements and rolling back the\ninfluence of the central government and its agents were all\nthat were needed to establish decentralized natural resource\ngovernance (see Zungu, 1996). This was a misplaced prem-\nise as it undermined not only the influence of informal\ninstitutions on formal institutions but also the need to\ninvolve the state in enforcing democratic rules. In the case\nof this study, WUA formal institutions were created parallel\nto existing informal management structures controlled by\nlocal chiefs. This arrangement created potential conflict\nbetween local chiefs and WUA executive, making it diffi-\ncult for the latter to resolve conflicts. This is confirmed by\nthe responses of local chiefs who indicated that they are not\nhappy with this arrangement. Instead, local chiefs argue\nthat it is unfair to leave them out of irrigation management\nas they have a long history in natural resource management\n(see also Fairhead & Leach, 1995). One clear example of\ntheir role is that while WUA executive leaders have the\nmandate to discipline farmers, they cannot do so without\ninforming and getting the consent from local chiefs. Some\noffenders are also not disciplined because they are con-\nnected to influential local chiefs. Revelations from Domasi\nand Njala point to the idea that decentralized natural\nresource governance loses a lot by neglecting traditional\nstructures and customary law and enforcement of laws from\nthe state. Mawaya (2009) argued that formal recognition of\nlocal bylaws and rules can be useful in enforcing compli-\nance. This cannot, however, be achieved without formally\nrecognizing local chiefs.\nConclusions and Recommendations\nThis article has demonstrated that the question of instituting\ndecentralized democratic natural resource governance in\nareas with a history of strong state management is a complex\none. This is largely so as institutional performance of the\ndecentralized structures depends not only on the negotiated\ncompeting interests between the local elected and traditional\nleaders but also on the policy implementation support from\nthe central government. Evidence from Domasi and Njala\nirrigation schemes demonstrates that the promise of estab-\nlishing decentralized democratic natural resource gover-\nnance through democratic arrangements is not automatic.\nThus, this study underlines the need for understanding the\ndynamic interaction between state and society actors (for-\nmal\u00adinformal) before formulating or designing institutional\narrangements for establishing democratic natural resource\ngovernance. In particular, understanding state\u00adsociety syn-\nergy and the convergent and divergent outcomes resulting\nfrom the influence of traditional actors on elected actors is\nimportant in designing institutional arrangements for demo-\ncratic governance.\nThe shift to decentralized natural resource governance is\nripe and essential taking into account the shortfalls in cen-\ntralized natural resources management in Malawi, in particu-\nlar, and in Africa, in general. There are currently high\ntheoretical expectations that, unlike the failed state's fences-\nand-fines approach, decentralized natural resource manage-\nment presents the best alternative to managing these\nresources. However, outcomes of decentralized irrigation\nscheme management at Domasi and Njala reveal that the\npositive contribution of democratic institutional structure,\nwhile hard to refute, is challenged by a number of factors.\nFirst, contrary to the dominant view of rolling back the state,\nfindings from Domasi and Njala demonstrate that there is a\nneed to adopt state\u00adsociety synergy that is built on trust and\nreciprocity. This approach is necessary if the state has to\nenforce local actors' compliance to natural resources demo-\ncratic policy stipulations such as holding elections for office\nbearers. Second, findings from this study suggest that the\ntransition from centralized to decentralized natural resource\ngovernance requires institutional engineering that can allow\ndemocratization of local institutions (both formal and infor-\nmal). To this end, the future and success of decentralized\nnatural resource governance depends on the extent to which\ninformal institutions will be allowed to evolve together with\nformal institutions rather than being left out (see also\nUNECA, 2007). This article, therefore, concludes that decen-\ntralization is predominantly a political activity; hence, the\ntransition to decentralized natural resource governance can-\nnot be a matter of just passing democratic legislation. Equally\nimportant, the mere institution of formal democratic struc-\ntures does not automatically lead to achievement of demo-\ncratic governance as was theorized.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAbdellatif, A.
