We report an experiment designed to investigate the effect of modifying the sound of\nhigh-heeled shoes on women's self-reported valence, arousal, and dominance scores, as well as\nany changes to a variety of measures of bodily sensation. We also assessed whether self-evaluated\npersonality traits and the enjoyment associated with wearing heels were correlated with these effects.\nForty-eight women walked down a \"virtual runway\" while listening to four interaction sounds (leather-\nand polypropylene-soled high-heeled shoes contacting ceramic flooring or carpet). Analysis of the\nquestionnaires that the participants completed indicated that the type of sonic interaction impacted\nvalence, arousal, and dominance scores, as well as the evaluated bodily sensations. There were\nalso correlations between these scores and both self-evaluated personality traits and the reported\nenjoyment associated with wearing high heels. These results demonstrate the effect that the sound\nof a woman's physical interaction with the environment can have, especially when her contact with\nthe ground while walking makes a louder sound. More generally, these results demonstrate that the\nmanipulation of product extrinsic sounds can modify people's evaluation of their emotional outcomes\n(valence, arousal, and dominance), as well as their bodily sensations.\n",

(2012) have, for instance, demonstrated that changing the auditory feed-\nback that a person hears when tapping a table can give rise to the impression that their arm is signifi-\ncantly longer than it actually is. Meanwhile, Senna, Maravita, Bolognini, and Parise (2014) recently\nbuilt on earlier studies of \"the parchment skin illusion\" (Guest, Catmur, Lloyd, & Spence, 2002;\nJousm\u00e4ki & Hari, 1998) to show that if the nature of the sound that participants heard synchronized\nwith the tapping on their own arm was changed, they reported that their arm felt like it had turned\nto marble. Hence, while people typically give little consideration to the sounds that result from their\ninteraction with the environment, a growing body of empirical research now shows that action-related\nsounds do indeed provide a rich source of information that influences our multisensory perception of\na variety of product attributes. This would appear to be true no matter whether people realize it or not\nAglioti and Pazzaglia (2010) have highlighted the fact that actions are connected to sounds, since\nthe actions of others can be represented auditorily. So, for instance, Ro, Hsu, Yasar, Elmore, and\nBeauchamp (2009) reported on a series of experiments designed to investigate the influence of audi-\ntory cues on somatosensory perception. Their research demonstrated that people's tactile perception\na Pion publication\nModifying action sounds influences people's emotional\nresponses and bodily sensations\n154 Tonetto LM, Klanovicz CP, Spence C\ncould be profoundly influenced by auditory cues, thus suggesting that similar coding mechanisms are\nlikely to underlie information processing in the two modalities.\nMeanwhile, Wilson, Reed, and Braida (2009, 2010) have also demonstrated near-threshold level\nauditory and tactile tonal stimuli when presented simultaneously in objective detection contexts, rein-\nforcing the existence of interaction between auditory and tactile perceptions. Similar findings have\nalso been reported by Yau, Olenczak, Dammann, and Bensmaia (2009). The latter researchers dem-\nonstrated that audition could interfere with tactile frequency perception. Thus, auditory and tactile\nfrequency channels appear to be fundamentally linked.\nIn recent years, designers have started to become interested in trying to influence the experience\nof the consumer by means of product sound interactions (e.g., Quinn, 2012). Focusing on the semantic\nattributes of product sounds, \u00d6zcan and van Egmond (2012) were able to identify eight factors that\nunderlie people's semantic associations with product sounds: Attention, roughness, smoothness, tem-\nporal constancy, familiarity/unfamiliarity, unpleasantness, machinery, and power. Perceptual factors\n(attention, roughness, smoothness, and temporal constancy) were found to be correlated with cognitive\nfactors (power, machinery, and familiarity/unfamiliarity) and with more emotional factors (unpleas-\nantness). Product sounds evoke meaningful associations; they can also exert a profound influence over\na consumer's ultimate product experience.\nIt can therefore be argued that sound should be considered as an integral part of the multisensory\nexperience for many products categories. In the field of product design, Schifferstein and Hekkert\n(2008) have stated that design should be concerned with enhancing product experience through sound.\nThe sound of a product can be manipulated to be more pleasurable, or to be quieter (silent, even;\nsee McDermott, 2013). That said, a near-silent hoover provides an example of a seemingly desir-\nable product attribute, but one that failed when actually launched in the marketplace (see Wolkomir,\n1996). Schifferstein and Hekkert have also pointed out that specific sounds might be associated with\nparticular products (or categories of product), and with distinct meanings, such as being fun, informa-\ntive, playful, inspiring, even. This means, in our example, that the sound of the hoover might also be\ndesirable, if the noise is terms of its cleaning power within the target consumer group.\nWhen it comes to technology and the role of sound (or auditory cues) in retail fashion contexts,\nit has recently been demonstrated that people spend significantly longer (by about a third) interacting\nwith an augmented reality (AR) clothing display when realistic clothing sounds were presented when\ntheir participants tried on various winter jackets (Ho, Jones, King, Murray, & Spence, 2013). Interest-\ningly, the participants in this particular study also reported that they would be willing to spend more\non purchasing the garment than when they only received visual feedback (as is typically the case in the\nmajority of AR clothing applications that are currently available).\nKn\u00f6ferle (2011, 2012) has pointed out how people's evaluation of a product (such as the taste of a\ncup of coffee) can be modified by the manipulation of product extrinsic sounds (in this case, the sound\nthat the coffee maker makes). This effect was moderated by the consumer's enjoyment of the sound\nof the preparation of the coffee (Houghton, 2014). Thus, it would seem reasonable to assume that the\nsonic interaction between artefacts and between artefacts and other environmental stimuli can influ-\nence the degree of pleasantness in a particular retail shopping experience. That said, it is important\nto note that individuals tend to differ in terms of their enjoyment of the (artificial) sound of products,\naccording to their personal/cultural backgrounds (\u00d6zcan & van Egmond, 2012). Besides the well-\nmapped connections that have been reported in the literature thus far between sound and emotion, a\nfew other studies have offered a basis on which to ground this idea firmly on the basis of empirical\ndata. Bowles (2013, p. 98), for example, has reported that workers at Herm\u00e8s \"spent three seasons\nfinding the perfect sound a bag should make when it shuts.\"\nResearchers have looked at the type of flooring as one salient factor concerning the environment\nsounds that are elicited as a result of a shopper's interaction with specific products. Meyers-Levy, Zhu,\nand Jiang (2010) examined the relationship between bodily sensations and the type of flooring dur-\ning shopping. They reported that a sense of comfort could be promoted in people simply by means of\nthe presence of soft carpeting while a hard tile floor was more likely to give rise to feelings of fatigue\ninstead.\nBresin, de Witt, Papetti, Civolani, and Fontana (2010) demonstrated that the sound feedback of\nfootstep can influence the human behaviour. Subjects were asked to walk using sensored shoes (for\nproviding auditory feedback) with four emotional intentions: happy, sad, aggressive, and tender. The\nauthors manipulated the ground sound texture four times for each emotion: wood panels, linoleum,\nmuddy ground, and iced snow. Users tended to a faster pace (more active walking) when they listened\nto walking surface sounds characterized by a higher spectral centroid (such as iced snow), and a slower\npace (less active walking) when the sound of the walking surface had a lower spectral centroid (e.g.,\nmuddy ground). More aggressive walking styles were found when participants listened to harder tex-\nture sounds, and more tender and sad walking patterns when they listened to the softer sounds.\nBased on the literature reviewed above, it is clear that the sound made by products can evoke\nmeaningful associations in the minds of consumers (\u00d6zcan & van Egmond, 2012). Furthermore,\nby providing or manipulating extrinsic product-related sounds, it is possible to change people's\nperception of them, an effect that will likely be moderated by their enjoyment of these sounds (Ho\nAs seen in those studies reported by Meyers-Levy et al. (2010), the floor itself can play a par-\nticularly interesting role in terms of moderating people's product experience and preferences. In the\npresent study, we were especially interested in the multisensory experience of consumers in the con-\ntext of a retail shoe store. We investigated whether the sound of women walking across different types\nof flooring while hearing high heels would affect their emotional experience and bodily sensations.\nHere it is interesting to note that certain shoe designers already purportedly play with the material of\nthe heels of the shoes design in order to change the sound that the shoe makes (cf. Quinn, 2012).\nTherefore, in the present study, we studied the nature of any sonic interactions taking place\nbetween the material of the heel of a pair of high-heeled shoes (polypropylene vs. leather) and the\ntype of flooring (ceramic vs. carpet). Our choice of stimuli was motivated by trying to use materials\nthat are commonly found in shoes and stores, as well as producing louder and quieter contact interac-\ntion sounds. The results reported here help to advance our current knowledge by bringing information\nconcerning how the manipulation of the materials that may be used in real-world environments, such\nas stores, can change auditory stimuli (interaction sounds) and consequently consumer experience.\nTo date, there have not been any specific studies on this subject. As such, there is a need to frame\ngeneral hypotheses about what might be found in this study, based on the tangentially related studies\nmentioned above. The experiment reported here was specifically designed to test the general hypoth-\nesis (H1) that the type of sonic interaction that a woman hears while walking would impact on her\nself-reported valence, arousal, and dominance (VAD) scores, as well as possibly a variety of measures\nof bodily sensation. Louder sonic interactions (for example, as resulting from someone walking across\na ceramic floor with polypropylene soles) were expected to evoke higher VAD scores, whereas quieter\nwalking sounds (resulting from someone walking across a carpet in leather-soled shoes) were expected\nto evoke higher scores on the bodily sensation scales instead. Considering the possible relation of\ndiverse personal consumer backgrounds on the experience of the user, we also predicted that self-\nreported consumer styles would be correlated with influences that these sounds had on women: (H2)\nthere is a positive correlation between how much a woman likes high-heeled shoes and VAD scores\nonly in the case of noisier sonic interactions; (H3) there are correlations between the self-evaluated\ncharacteristics of \"introverted\" and \"discreet\" and VAD scores to quieter sonic interactions; and (H4)\nthere are correlations between the self-evaluated characteristics of \"attractive\" and \"feminine\" and\nVAD scores generated in response to louder sonic interactions. Even though these hypotheses are\ngrounded in literature that is not specifically connected to the manipulated stimuli, it is reasonable\nto believe that product sounds can change people's experience, and that they are moderated by their\nenjoyment of these sounds and by their personal/cultural background (Ho et al., 2013; Kn\u00f6ferle, 2011,\nA within-participants experimental design was utilized. Forty-eight female participants were recruited\nexperiment took place in a design lab, with the participants tested individually. The entire experiment\ntook between 45 minutes and an hour to complete.\nThe participants were personally invited to volunteer for the study by one of the authors, in an\nacademic environment, with the authorization of the directors of the department. The experiment was\ncarried out in accordance with the relevant institutional and national regulations and legislation, with\nthe World Medical Association Helsinki Declaration.\n156 Tonetto LM, Klanovicz CP, Spence C\nThe sounds of the four types of sonic interaction were recorded in a studio setting that had been\ntreated so as to avoid acoustic distortion. A Zoom H4N recorder was used to register the audio in\n96 kHz/24 bits, converted to 44.1 kHz/16 bits, due to compatibility with CD reproduction systems.\nThe same young adult female, using the same high-heeled shoe in two versions (leather and polypro-\npylene soles), walked across ceramic and carpet flooring to generate the sounds to be tested, which\nwere recorded as stereo files using a pair of Neumann diaphragm condenser microphones (Model KM\nBefore the experiment, at the moment they arrived at the design lab, the female participants\nresponded to a preliminary questionnaire, concerning their weight, height, and age. The questionnaire\nalso included a question about how much the respondent liked wearing high-heeled shoes (scale from\n0 to 10); and self-reported user styles (measured by 5-point semantic differential scales--from 22 to\n12: introverted  extroverted, discreet  indiscreet, attractive  repulsive, feminine  masculine;\ninspired by the Product Personality Assignment of Jordan, 2000).\nIn the experiment itself, the women were informed that they would walk around a \"virtual run-\nway\" four times and would fill in a second kind of questionnaire four times immediately after each\nwalk, answering questions about how they felt while walking. The runway was built using Makey\nMakey (http://www.makeymakey.com/). It consisted of 12 metal steps (approximately 10 inches wide\nby 16 inches long), placed in a circular array (see Figure 1) and connected via wires to a compu-\nter and fixed on the floor with adhesive tape. When the woman's feet made contact with the metal\nplates placed on the floor, they heard the sounds synchronized with their steps, played back via the\ncomputer's loudspeaker (an Apple MacBook Pro), positioned 2 feet from the first step.\nIn a 2  2 design, participants walked barefoot over the runway. Each one of the four sounds was\nplayed to each participant, in a random order. To be exposed to each sound, each woman walked a total\nof 12 steps, while listening to the same sound 12 times (i.e., once with each step).\nAfter being exposed to a sound, they filled in the questionnaire. The female participants were\nasked to respond how they felt listening to the sound, describing the sensations that they experienced\n(not judging the shoes or the sounds themselves). The dependent measures were valence, arousal, and\ndominance, and bodily sensations.\nValence (the degree of pleasantness of a stimulus), arousal (the intensity of the emotional response\nevoked by a stimulus), and dominance (the degree of control experienced by the person facing a stimu-\nlus) (VAD) were measured using the self-assessment scale--SAM (self-assessment Manikin) (Badley\n& Lang, 1994). In this technique, the participants rate their current emotional state via three scales,\nwhich are, according to the authors, the three main dimensions of affect. Participants were presented\nto the question: How did you feel while you listened to the sound of this high-heeled shoe? SAM is\na pictorial assessment technique, shown in Figure 2, to measure the three variables, using a 9-point\nBodily sensations were measured using an instrument from Meyers-Levy et al. (2010).

The items were comfortable, softly relaxed, physically supple, at ease, contented,\nand restful.\nTable 1 shows results of SAM scores, compared by type of sonic interaction (polypropylene or leather\nsole versus ceramic floor or carpet).\nfurther revealed that valence was higher when participants heard sounds generated by ceramic floor\nhoc analyses indicate higher arousal when participants were exposed to sounds produced by ceramic\nanalyses indicate:\na) Arousal scores when hearing the polypropylene/ceramic sound (1.49) were higher than\nb) Arousal scores when listening the polypropylene/ceramic interaction sound (1.49) were\nc) Arousal scores when hearing leather/ceramic sound (0.87) were higher than listening to\nFor the dominance scores, an effect of the type of flooring was detected (F(1, 46) 5 5.89, p \n0.05).

A negative correlation refers to the characteristic on the top of the cells in the first row (intro-\nverted, discreet, attractive, and feminine), whereas positive correlations refer to the characteristics on\nthe bottom (extroverted, indiscrete, repulsive, and masculine).\nFor the loudest sounds (polypropylene/ceramic and leather/ceramic), valence was negatively cor-\nrelated with attractive versus repulsive self-reported consumer styles, with subjects tending to associ-\nate higher valence ratings with femininity. Other correlation patterns were also detected for the evalu-\nation of these sounds:\na) Polypropylene/ceramic contact sound: Valence was also negatively correlated with self-\nevaluated judgements of feminine  masculine, with participants exhibiting a tendency to\nassociate higher valence ratings with more self-reported femininity.\nb) Leather/ceramic contact sound: Dominance ratings were negatively correlated to attractive\nversus repulsive consumer styles, with women tending to associate higher dominance ratings\nwith more self-reported attractiveness.\nThe leather/carpet sound revealed no correlations with self-reported personality traits, but poly-\npropylene/carpet did. Valence and dominance were negatively correlated with self-reported introver-\nsion versus extroversion (higher valence and dominance associated to introversion), and valence was\npositively correlated with feminine  masculine self-reported styles (higher valence associated with\nmasculinity).\n4 Discussion and conclusions\nThe results of the present study highlight the profound effect that interaction sounds that a woman\nmakes when walking can exert on both their emotional responses and bodily sensations. Previous\nresearch has reported that changing what a person hears can modify their perception of surface texture\n2007; see also Byron, 2012), and even the crispness and carbonation of a variety of food and beverage\nTable 3.

Significant correlations between how much the user likes high-\nheeled shoes and SAM scores at *0.05 and **0.01 levels are indicated.\n160 Tonetto LM, Klanovicz CP, Spence C\nIn the present study, we confirmed (H1) that the type of sonic interaction that a woman hears\nwould impact on their self-reported SAM scores, as well as possibly a variety of bodily sensations\nmeasures, since in terms of the:\na) Emotional outcomes: any sole/ceramic combinations (the louder sounds) evoked higher\nVAD ratings.\nb) Bodily sensations: sounds of contact of ceramic with any sole evoke higher \"contented\" scores\nthan those from contact with carpet; the leather/ceramic sound generates higher scores than\nleather/carpet (measures: \"comfortable\" and \"contented\") and than polypropylene/ceramic\n(measures: \"at ease\" and \"contented\"); and the polypropylene/carpet interaction sound gen-\nerates higher evaluations than the leather/carpet sound (measures: softly relaxed, at ease,\ncontented, and resentful).\nAn additional finding revealed that valence and dominance ratings were positively correlated in\nthe evaluation of how participants felt listening to any sound. Therefore, the degree of pleasantness\nevoked by the sound (valence) is correlated to the degree of control experienced by the person facing\nit (dominance).\nHeel/floor interaction sounds also influenced participants' bodily sensations, reinforcing the\nresults reported previously by other researchers (e.g., Aglioti & Pazzaglia, 2010; Ro et al., 2009),\nindicating that coding mechanisms in touch and audition might be connected. Hence, not only does\nthe contact with distinct kinds of flooring influence a participant's bodily sensations, as indicated by\nthe work of Meyers-Levy et al. (2010), but the interaction sounds between heels and the floor can also\nplay a similar role.\nIn the present study, we also predicted (H2) that there would be a positive correlation between\nhow much women liked high-heels and their SAM scores in the noisier sonic interactions. The cor-\nrelation between variables, although detected, was not as straightforward and simple as predicted,\nbecause of\na) Noisier interactions: How much a woman likes high-heeled shoes was positively corre-\nlated with (1) valence, while listening to the sound of ceramic floors, both interacting with\nTable4.Correlations (Sig. 2 tailed) between self-reported personality traits and SAM ratings (N 5 47)\nIntroverted versus\nextroverted\nDiscrete versus\nindiscrete\nAttractive\nversus repulsive\nFeminine versus\nmasculine\n1.

Domi-\nnance, in addition, was also positively related to the enjoyment of heels with the leather sole/ceramic\nfloor interaction, but still seems to be connected to the characteristic sound of heels. The mentioned\nenjoyment was negatively correlated to dominance, when the participants evaluated how they felt\nwhile listening to propylene sole/carpet interaction sounds; this fact suggests that this quiet sound (as\nopposed to the loud sound of any sole interacting with ceramic) does not appeal to those women who\nenjoy heels because it makes them feel dominant.\nFinally, we hypothesized (H3) that there would be a correlation between the self-evaluated char-\nacteristics of \"introverted\" and \"discreet\" and SAM scores to quieter sonic interactions; and (H4) that\nthere would be correlations between the self-evaluated characteristics of \"attractive\" and \"feminine\"\nand SAM scores to louder sonic interactions. These hypotheses were partially confirmed:\na) Attractive and feminine were correlated with valence scores, when listening to the polypro-\npylene/ceramic sound.\nb) Attractive was correlated with valence and dominance scores, when listening to the leather/\nceramic impact sound.\nc) Introverted was correlated with valence and dominance scores, and masculine (the opposite\nof feminine in the scale) was associated to valence, when exposed to the polypropylene/carpet\nimpact sound.\nPeople differ in terms of their enjoyment of artificial sounds (\u00d6zcan & van Egmond, 2012); per-\nsonal background, such as their enjoyment of wearing heels, can presumably influence the enjoyment\nof a characteristic sound of a product. One might also imagine there to be an effect of the woman's\nThese results indicate that self-reported personality characteristics were correlated with variables\nsuch as valence, reinforcing the view that a woman's personal/cultural background may play an impor-\ntant role in the enjoyment of product sounds. In our study, distinct heel/flooring interaction sounds\nwere correlated with the self-reported personality traits in the study, reinforcing Schifferstein and\nHekkert's (2008) proposal that sounds might be associated with products, indicating meanings such\nas fun, informative, etc.\nThe main implications of the results reported here are related to the findings that the type of sonic\ninteraction a woman hears can impact on her emotions and bodily sensations, and that the enjoyment\nof these sounds depends on personal background (self-reported personality traits) and her enjoyment\nof heels. It has already been well established that changing product sounds can modify product per-\nception, but this study provides evidence that changing interaction sounds between products and the\nenvironment (e.g., heel and floor) can also affect emotional outcomes. Even though the results do not\nallow the authors to make generalizations to other contexts, they nevertheless advance our understand-\ning concerning how sonic interactions affect multisensory perception and also that this effect is not\nuniversal, since results were moderated by individual differences/background.\nIt is important to highlight the fact that even though the main finding of the study is that the sound\nof high heels influences women's experience (especially when they make louder sounds), the known\nrelationship between loudness and emotional reactions (with loud sounds tending to be more arous-\ning), the effect can be related to the intensity of the sound, to the sound of heels itself, or to both fac-\ntors. Since the enjoyment of using heels and self-reported personality traits moderated results, it seems\nreasonable to think that the sound of heels itself is the main reason.\nA potential limitation with the present study that should be flagged up here is the kind of experi-\nmental manipulation (within-participants) that was used, and how this might have drawn the partici-\npants' attention to the experimental manipulation under study. Considering the results, it can be seen\nas an opportunity to be explored in further research.\nAnother limitation with the present study that also should be raised here is to investigate just how\nimportant the feeling of generating the sounds (e.g., the feeling of agency) is to the effects documented\nhere. Do the sounds themselves have an impact over people, independently from who is making them?\n162 Tonetto LM, Klanovicz CP, Spence C\nSince only the sound agents (women) were studied (not people around the walker), this offers another\nopportunity for future research. Furthermore, there may be theoretical interest in investigating how\nmale participants who have never worn high heels would respond to these auditory manipulations of\ninteraction sounds.\nEven though the participants may have been aware of the potential discrepancy between their own\nsomatosensory sensations and the auditory feedback that they heard in this study, the rationale that led\nthe authors to the decision to collect data with bare foot subjects was of an applied nature. We did not\nwant the aesthetics properties of the shoes to interfere in their rating, totally isolating the effect of the\nsound itself on user experience.\nNevertheless, on the basis of the results reported here, the impact of heel/floor interaction sounds\non the experience of the user/wearer is undeniable, as is the relation between emotional outcomes and\npersonal characteristics, namely the enjoyment of heels and self-reported personality traits.\n"
