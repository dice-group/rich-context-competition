Vaccine injections cause\npain, anxiety and fear in paediatric\npatients.5,6 The pain associated with such\ninjections is not only a source of distress\nfor children, but also for their parents and\nthe individuals administering the injec-\ntions.4 This pain can lead to preprocedural\nanxiety in the future, needle phobias and\nhealthcare avoidance behaviours.5 It is\nestimated that up to 25% of adults have\na fear of needles, with most fears develop-\ning in childhood.6 Conversely, more posi-\ntive experiences during vaccine injections\nwould promote and maintain trust in\nhealthcare providers.5\nEutectic mixture of local anaesthetics\n(EMLA\u00d5) cream is a topical anaesthetic\nmixture of lidocaine (2.5%) and prilocaine\n(2.5%) in a cream base.7 Eutectic mixtures\nare combinations of two or more substances\nthat solidify at a lower temperature than\ntheir individual ingredients. Given its safety\nprofile and proven efficacy, the application\nof EMLA\u00d5 cream before vaccination of\nchildren to reduce pain at the time of\ninjection is recommended by the Canadian\nguidelines for reducing the pain of child-\nhood vaccination (grade A recommenda-\ntion, based on level I evidence).8 However,\nmany paediatricians and healthcare pro-\nviders report that one of the major barriers\nagainst the routine implementation of such\npain-relieving interventions is insufficient\ntime to incorporate them within the busy\noffice workflow, because of the delayed\nonset of the anaesthetic effect (60 min).3,9\nThe aim of the present study was to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of implementing EMLA\u00d5\ncream application as a routine pain-relieving\nstrategy during childhood vaccination\nappointments.\nPatients and methods\nStudy design and patient population\nThe present study was a prospective, rando-\nmized, double-blind, placebo-controlled\nanalysis conducted at the Well-baby\nPaediatric Clinic, King Khalid University\nHospital, King Saud University, Riyadh,\nSaudi Arabia over a 1-week period during\nJanuary 2012. All study participants were\nhealthy children, aged 2 months to 6 years,\nwho presented for routine immunization.\nThe exclusion criteria were as follows: a\nhistory of allergy to local anaesthetics or to\nany component of the EMLA\u00d5 cream; a\nhistory of uncertain drug sensitivities; active\ndermatitis or an open wound at the appli-\ncation site; receipt of an analgesic, anaes-\nthetic or sedative <12 h before the time\nof vaccination; congenital or idio-\npathic methaemoglobinaemia; glucose-\n6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency;\nsevere hepatic or renal disease; cardiac dis-\nease; use of class I antiarrhythmic drugs.\nThe study protocol was approved by the\nEthical Review Board of the College of\nMedicine, King Saud University, Riyadh,\nSaudi Arabia. The parents/legal guardians\nof the children provided written informed\nconsent for their participation in the study.\nStudy protocol\nBased on a computer-generated schedule,\nchildren were randomized at study entry to\nreceive either $0.5 g EMLA\u00d5 (AstraZeneca,\nLondon, UK) or placebo cream (an inert\ncream that could not be visually differen-\ntiated from EMLA\u00d5; Bepanthen\u00d5 Cream,\nBayer HealthCare, Leverkusen, Germany)\napplied to an area of approximately 1 cm2 of\neach vaccination site (the lateral region of\nthe right or left thigh for infants aged <1\nyear; the right or left deltoid for children\naged !1 year) before vaccination. Note that\nno intervention was performed with regard\nto the time of application prior to vaccin-\nation. A nontoxic marker was used to outline\nthe area(s) of application. The applied cream\nwas covered with an occlusive dressing and\nthe time of application was recorded. The\nchild was subsequently enrolled in the\nnormal routine process of paediatrician\ninterview in the examination room followed\nby vaccination. In the vaccination room, the\ncream was wiped off and the areas were\ndisinfected with alcohol. The time of vaccine\nadministration was recorded and vaccine\ninjections were administered as per the rou-\ntine protocol, according to the National\nImmunization Programme of Saudi\nArabia.10 The time of application of the\ncream prior to vaccination was calculated\nfrom the moment of cream application until\nthe child received the first vaccine injection.\nThe total vaccination appointment time was\ncalculated from when the child arrived in the\nWell-baby Paediatric Clinic until the child\nreceived the first vaccine injection.\nPain assessments\nIn the vaccination room, pain was assessed\nby scoring facial expression, cry and body\nmovements of the children using the\nModified Behavioural Pain Scale\nwere blinded to the study treatment,\ntogether assessed the vaccine injection-\nrelated pain in real time. They first estab-\nlished a baseline MBPS score for the 10 s\nperiod that preceded the injection, and rated\nanother MBPS score within 10 s after the\ninjection. For each child, differences\nbetween the MBPS scores after the injection\nand the score at baseline were calculated.\nWhether a cry occurred was noted and total\ncrying time was measured. Infant pain\nduring the vaccination was also assessed by\nthe nurse administering the vaccine at two\nstages: at the moment of the needle prick,\nand after finishing the injection and remov-\ning the needle. The nurse assessed the pain\nusing a 10-point visual analogue scale\n(VAS), in which 0 was designated `no pain'\nand 10 `worst possible pain'. Pain was\nconsidered to be severe at scores !7. The\nreliability and validity of the VAS and\nMBPS in evaluating pain associated with\nvaccinations have previously been con-\nfirmed.12,13 Adverse events were evaluated\nfor all children. These included local skin\nreactions, such as blanching and local ery-\nthema, which were assessed at the time of\ndressing removal and 15 min later.\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed\nusing the SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version\n19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. Data are expressed as mean \u00c6\nSD, n of patients (%) or median (interquar-\ntile range). Student's t-test was used to\ncompare continuous data, Mann\u00adWhitney\nU-test was used to compare pain scores\n(ordinal data), and 2-test was used to\ncompare categorical data. A P-value <0.05\nwas considered statistically significant.\nResults\n239 children were seen at the Well-baby\nPaediatric Clinic, King Khalid University\nHospital, for vaccination.

The two\ngroups were similar in age, sex and type of\nvaccine administered (Table 1).\nSignificantly fewer infants and children\ncried after the vaccination in the EMLA\u00d5\ngroup than in the placebo group: 22.4% of\nchildren (n \u00bc 24) in the EMLA\u00d5 group did\nnot cry at all compared with 7.3% (n \u00bc 8) in\nthe placebo group (P \u00bc 0.002).

Neither erythema\nnor swelling was observed in either group.\nDiscussion\nThe present study provided evidence that the\nuse of EMLA\u00d5 cream for routine childhood\nvaccinations was as effective as previously\nreported in reducing the pain associated\nwith either subcutaneous or intramuscular\nimmunization.14\u00ad17 The possible effect of\nEMLA\u00d5 on the immune response to live\nvaccine has been assessed previously and\nthere was no evidence of interference from\nIn the current study, a significant reduction\nin VAS and MBPS scores was observed in\nthe EMLA\u00d5 group compared with the pla-\ncebo group. Both the MBPS score recorded\nby the observer and the VAS score recorded\nby the nurse administering the vaccines\ncorrelated well to support the effectiveness\nof EMLA\u00d5 in pain relief.\nThe efficacy of EMLA\u00d5 in reducing\noverall injection pain is likely attributable\nto a decrease in pain as the needle penetrates\nthe skin, as well as a reduction in the\nunderlying muscle spasm that is associated\nwith such pain.4,18 The pain-relieving effect\nof EMLA\u00d5 was more pronounced at the\ntime of the needle prick compared with after\nthe needle was removed, as indicated by the\nVAS score, possibly due to the limited depth\nof penetration of EMLA\u00d5 cream (or other\nfactors related to vaccine composition). The\neffect of EMLA\u00d5 on pain associated with\nthe procedures was proven by the measured\npain scores and the duration of crying. Only\nlocal pallor at the site of cream application\nwas observed in just under one-third of\nparticipants in the EMLA\u00d5 group.\nIn this present study, the mean \u00c6 SD total\nvaccination appointment time from when\nTable 2.

In addition, the\nmean total vaccination appointment time\nafter administering the EMLA\u00d5 cream did\nnot differ markedly from the mean \u00c6 SD\nwaiting time at the King Khalid University\nHospital, which was previously found to be\nmonitoring (personal communication). It\nis expected that as vaccination nurses\nbecome more familiar with the EMLA\u00d5\napplication procedures, the time to first\nvaccination will decrease further toward\nthe hospital's baseline measurement time of\nTaddio et al.20 reported a comparable\nfor childhood vaccination appointments in\neight outpatient primary care clinics. This\nwaiting time included the general waiting\nroom time plus examination room time\nbefore the actual vaccine injection, without\nimplementing any extra pain-relieving strat-\negy. Therefore, whenever the typical wait\ntime for a vaccine appointment exceeds\n30 min, application of local anaesthetic\ncould be incorporated within the process of\nvaccine injection without substantially pro-\nlonging the duration of the visit.\nStudies have focused on evaluating pain\nassociated with specific vaccine types in a\nparticular age group.14\u00ad16 In contrast, the\npresent study included all eligible children\nwho presented to the Well-baby Paediatric\nClinic for routine immunization.\nFurthermore, the pain associated with all\nvaccine injections given to the children was\nassessed. Thus, this may increase the gener-\nalizability of the present study for imple-\nmenting EMLA\u00d5 cream application as a\nroutine pain-relieving strategy in clinical\nvaccination practice. However, because the\npresent study was conducted in a relatively\nsmall number of children from a single\ncentre, these findings may warrant further\nresearch in this regard.\nThe present study showed that infants\nand children receiving pre-treatment with\nEMLA\u00d5 cream before their routine vaccin-\nations manifested significantly lower pain\nscores compared with the placebo group,\nwith little increase in the mean time between\nchild arrival at the clinic and first vaccine\ninjection. Therefore, we suggest that\nEMLA\u00d5 cream be used routinely before\nvaccination, exploiting the significant\nadvantages of alleviating the child's pain\nand their parents' anxiety levels.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThe authors are thankful to the Deanship of\nScientific Research, King Saud University,\nRiyadh, Saudi Arabia for supporting the work\nthrough a Research Group Project Grant (RGP-\n"
