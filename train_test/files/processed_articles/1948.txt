Almeida,2 and Susan Turk Charles3\n1Department of Psychology, North Carolina State University.\n2Human Development and Family Studies, Pennsylvania State University.\n3Department of Psychology and Social Behavior, University of California\u00adIrvine.\nWe examined age and control belief differences in physical and emotional reactivity to daily stressors in four\ndomains: interpersonal, work, network, and home. We combined data from the National Study of Daily\nExperiences and the Midlife in the United States survey, resulting in 1,031 participants who reported on 7,229\ndays. Findings from multilevel models suggest that age and control beliefs play an important role in a person's\nreactivity to interpersonal, network, and work stressors. Specifically, older age and lower perceived constraints\nwere each related to lower emotional and physical reactivity to interpersonal stressors. High mastery buffered the\nphysical effects of work stressors for younger and older adults, and high mastery was important for middle-aged\nadults' emotional reactivity to network stressors. High constraint was associated with the strongest physical\nreactivity to network stressors for younger and older adults.\nTHE present study focuses on age differences in reactivity\nto multiple domains of daily stressors. We assert that age\nplays a vital role in determining the psychological and physical\nconsequences of daily stressors (i.e., reactivity). Although\nsome studies have examined age differences in exposure\n(e.g., Almeida & Horn, 2004) and reactivity to specific stressor\ndomains (e.g., interpersonal; Birditt, Fingerman, & Almeida,\n2005), to date no single study has included multiple stressor\ndomains to capture a comprehensive account of age differences\nin daily stress processes. To this end, we examine age dif-\nferences in emotional and physical reactivity to daily stressors.\nWe define emotional reactivity as an increase in negative affect\nand physical reactivity as an increase in physical symptom\nreports in response to stressors. We examine this reactivity in\nthe stressor domains most often reported by people of all\nages: interpersonal, home, work, and network (stressors that\nhappen to close friends or family members; see Almeida &\nHorn). These domains represent areas where people often\nderive personal meaning, and they may be particularly im-\nportant for shifting motivational goals across the adult life\nspan. In addition to studying characteristics of the situation,\nwe also examined how personal control beliefs are involved in\nthis process.\nEffects of Daily Stressors\nDaily stressors are the routine challenges of day-to-day\nliving, and although they may be relatively minor, they are\ntangible events that can have immediate negative impacts on\nphysical and psychological well-being (Almeida, 2005;\nAlmeida, Wethington, & Kessler, 2002; Bolger, DeLongis,\nKessler, & Schilling, 1989). Daily stressors affect well-being\nnot only by having separate, immediate, and direct effects on\nemotional and physical functioning, but also by piling up over\na series of days to create persistent irritations and overloads that\nmay result in more serious stress reactions such as anxiety and\nunhealthier than others, and some individuals are more prone\nthan other individuals to the effects of stressors (Almeida). In\nthe present study we explore domains of daily stressors and\ncharacteristics of individuals to examine for whom and under\nwhat circumstances reactivity to stressors would be buffered or\nexacerbated. Specifically, we examine age differences and\nperceptions of control as personal characteristics that may be\nimportant for reactivity to commonly experienced daily\nstressors. Control is associated with decreased reactivity to\nstressors (Ong, Bergeman, & Bisconti, 2005) and therefore\nshould be considered within the context of emotional and\nphysical reactivity. Furthermore, stressor domains may vary in\ntheir salience across adulthood (e.g., Clark-Plaskie & Lachman,\n1999), so the emotional and physical impact of those stressors\ncould be associated with age. For example, older age has been\nassociated with decreased emotional reactivity to interpersonal\nstressors (Birditt et al., 2005), and self-determination theory\npursue their valued outcomes (e.g., maintaining interpersonal\nrelationships) even when faced with constraints.\nAge Differences in Reactivity to Stressors\nSome researchers suggest that older adults are less\nemotionally reactive to stressors than younger adults are (e.g.,\nUchino, Berg, Smith, Pearce, & Skinner, 2006). Certain life-\nspan theories of emotion regulation are also consistent with\nthe idea of lessened emotional reactivity to stress with age\nLabouvie-Vief & DeVoe, 1991; Lang, Staudinger, & Carsten-\nsen, 1998). For example, socioemotional selectivity theory\n(Carstensen et al.) posits better regulation of emotion among\nolder adults, and better emotion regulation is a key aspect of\noptimal aging (Baltes & Baltes, 1990; Baltes, Lindenberger, &\nBirditt and colleagues (2005) found that older adults were less\nemotionally reactive to interpersonal stressors; we examine\nwhether this pattern extrapolates to home-based stressors, work\nstressors, and stressors stemming from one's social network.\nJournal of Gerontology: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES Copyright 2007 by The Gerontological Society of America\nAge differences in physical reactivity to specific daily\nstressor domains remain unexplored. Some research suggests\nthat specific stressors (i.e., occupational or work-related\nstressors) occurring on a daily basis are associated with lower\nGiven that physical symptoms and illness are consistently\nfound to increase with age (House et al., 1994; Rowe & Kahn,\n1987), a consideration of the role of age is even more critical\nwhen the type of distress under investigation is physical distress\nStressor Domain: Interpersonal, Work, Home, and\nNetwork Stressors\nPrevious studies have examined commonly reported stressors\nsuch as interpersonal stressors (e.g., Birditt et al., 2005), work\nstressors (Grzywacz, Almeida, & McDonald, 2002; Hahn,\n2000), home stressors (Almeida, Wethington, & Chandler,\nstressors (e.g., Almeida et al., 2002; Zautra, Finch, Reich, &\nGuarnaccia, 1991). However, to our knowledge, only the study\nby Birditt and associates examined age differences in reactivity.\nWe expand on this work by examining whether age-related\ndecreases in reactivity to interpersonal stressors extend to other\ndomains of stressors.\nAge differences for interpersonal problems are particularly\ngermane when one is examining minor stressors encountered\nin daily life, where the majority of daily stressors involve\ninterpersonal conflicts (Almeida, 2005). Although older adults\nreport fewer arguments than do younger adults (Birditt et al.,\n2005), interpersonal conflicts are detrimental to an individuals'\n(Kiecolt-Glaser, 1999) functioning, regardless of age. Despite\nthe fact that interpersonal stressors are important to well-being,\nhowever, older adults are less emotionally reactive to them than\nyounger and middle-aged adults are (Birditt et al.).\nWork-related stressors are also an important domain because\nthey are linked with increased health problems (e.g., Chandola,\nBrunner, & Marmot, 2006) and poorer emotional health (e.g.,\nPflanz & Sonnek, 2002). The importance of the work domain\ntypically increases in midlife, especially for men (Clark-Plaskie &\nLachman, 1999). Therefore, this domain is particularly im-\nportant to examine from an adult life-span perspective because\nof the shift in saliency in work that often accompanies aging;\nthat is, work stressors could be particularly detrimental for\npeople in midlife.\nNetwork stressors may reveal different age-related patterns in\nreactivity than other stressors. For example, under some social\nsituations, older adults experience greater heart-rate reactivity\nthan younger adults do (Uchino, Holt-Lunstad, Uno, &\nFlinders, 2001). In the present study we examine whether\nthese age differences are similar for emotional and physical\nreactivity to daily network stressors. Home stressors are also\nimportant to consider because they have been linked with in-\ncreased anxiety (Evans & Steptoe, 2002) and tension (Almeida\nand middle-aged adults reported more demands in the home\nthan did older adults. We extend this finding by examining\nwhether reactivity to home stressors differed by age.\nThe Importance of Personal Control for\nAge Differences in Reactivity\nGreater personal control is related to reduced reactivity to\nstressors in daily life (e.g., Ong et al., 2005). We examine\nwhether potential age differences in emotional and physical\nreactivity to interpersonal, network, home, and work stressors\ndepend on perceptions of personal control. As goals shift in\ndifferent domains for younger, middle-aged, and older adults,\nbeliefs regarding control can be salient for reactivity to stressors\nin valued domains. The two control beliefs that we include in\nthe present study are mastery and constraint. Mastery is often\ndescribed in terms of one's judgments about his or her ability to\nachieve a goal, whereas perceived constraint refers to the extent\nto which a person believes factors exist that interfere with her or\nhis goal attainment (Lachman & Weaver, 1998b). Personal\nmastery is an important psychological resource that mitigates\nthe effects of stress and strain (Pearlin & Schooler, 1978).\nWhen a person is faced with stressful situations, a strong sense\nof control has also been linked to low levels of self-reported\nperceived stress (Cameron, Armstrong-Stassen, Orr, & Loukas,\n1991) and lower risk of depression (Yates, Tennstedt, & Chang,\n1999). Higher levels of perceived control also buffered recently\nbereaved wives from anxiety when they were faced with daily\nstressors (Ong et al.).\nWe were interested in examining both mastery and con-\nstraint in the present study because they could be differentially\nimportant across the adult life span. For example, as younger\nadults are striving toward goals in their work lives, a sense\nof mastery may be particularly important. Because midlife re-\npresents a time where work status and expertise may be at its\npeak (Clark-Plaskie & Lachman, 1999) and differences in sense\nof control within the work domain exist between young and\nmiddle-aged adults as a function of progress along the career\npath at different stages in the life course (Heise, 1990), we\nexamined whether control beliefs would be particularly\nimportant for middle-aged adults' well-being in response to\nwork stressors. On the basis of prior research findings and\nsocioemotional selectivity theory that younger adults who are\ninvested in establishing interpersonal relationships more often\nemploy active problem-solving strategies to their daily inter-\npersonal problems than older adults do, we predicted that\nperceived control (both constraints and mastery) would have\na stronger relationship with well-being (both emotional and\nphysical) among younger adults than among older adults. For\nthis reason, we are extending findings first reported by Birditt\nand colleagues (2005) to examine how control may influence\nthese age differences. Lastly, we explore potential interactions\nbetween control and age for stressors pertaining to the home\nand to those from the social network, domains that are not\nrelated to one specific age group.\nThe Present Study\nWe examined reactivity to daily interpersonal, network,\nhome, and work stressors for younger, middle-aged, and older\nadults. We also examined whether reactivity differed on two\nmeasures of perceived control: personal mastery and perceived\nconstraints. The daily diary design allowed for the examination\nof emotions and symptoms of people of different ages and\ndifferent levels of control when a stressor actually happened\nthat older age would be related to higher levels of daily\nemotional well-being and to reduced emotional reactivity to\ndaily stressors. In addition, we hypothesized that higher levels\nof personal mastery and lower levels of constraints would each\nbe related to higher levels of both daily emotional and physical\nwell-being as well as reduced reactivity in response to daily\nstressors for people at all ages. We also suggested that the\nstrength of control beliefs on reactivity to stressors would vary\nas a function of age, such that control beliefs would exert the\nstrongest influence for age groups in which the stressor domain\nis particularly salient. For domains in which saliency may not\nbe systematically related to age (e.g., home and network), we\nexplored control belief differences in reactivity.\nMETHODS\nSample and Procedure\nData for the analyses are from the National Study of Daily\nwomen, 469 men), all of whom had previously participated in\nthe Midlife in the United States Survey (MIDUS), a nationally\nrepresentative telephone-mail survey of 3,032 people, aged 25\u00ad\nMacArthur Foundation Research Network on Successful Mid-\nlife Development (for descriptions of the MIDUS project, see\nselected respondents in the NSDE from the MIDUS sample,\nand they received $20 for their participation in the project.\nOver eight consecutive evenings, respondents completed short\ntelephone interviews about their daily experiences. We planned\ndata collection to span an entire year (March 1996 to March\n1997), so we used 40 separate ``flights'' of interviews, with\neach flight representing the 8-day sequence of interviews from\napproximately 38 respondents. We staggered the initiation of\nflights across the day of the week to control for the possible\nconfounding between day of the study and day of week. Of\nagreed to participate, yielding a response rate of 83%.\nRespondents completed an average of 7 of the 8 interviews,\nresulting in a total of 7,229 daily interviews.\nThe NSDE subsample and the MIDUS sample had very\nsimilar distributions for gender, age, education, and race. The\nples, respectively), was better educated (60.8% of the MIDUS\nsample had 13 years or more of education, vs 62.3% of the\nNSDE subsample), and had fewer minority respondents than\nthe MIDUS. Of the participants in the NSDE, 90.3% were\nCaucasian, 5.9% were African American, and 3.8% were all\nother races; in the MIDUS, 87.8% were Caucasian, 6.8% were\nAfrican American, and 4.4% were all other races. On average,\nrespondents for the present analysis were 47 years old. We\nwanted to remain consistent with previous studies that have\nexamined age differences in stressor exposure (Almeida &\nmiddle-aged, and older adults with the NSDE. In addition, we\nhypothesized that the effects of control would vary according to\nspecific age groups, whether young, middle-aged, or old, in the\nlife span. For these reasons, we divided individuals into the\nfollowing three groups (based on age at the time of the initial\nMeasures\nDaily physical symptoms. --We assessed daily symptoms by\nusing a shortened version of the symptoms checklist by Larsen\nand Kasimatis (1991). We omitted items that overlapped with\nthe psychological distress scale (e.g., ``the urge to cry''). The\npresent scale assessed health symptoms in six categories: (a)\nheadaches, backaches, and muscle soreness; (b) cough, sore\nthroat, fever, chills, or other cold and flu symptoms; (c) nausea,\npoor appetite, or other stomach problems; (d) chest pain or\ndizziness; and (e) other physical symptoms or discomforts.\nEach day, respondents indicated how frequently they experi-\nenced each symptom over the past 24 hours on a 5-point scale\nthat ranged from none of the time to all of the time. We\ncomputed summed scores across the six items for each day.\nThis scale has been used effectively in previous studies (e.g.,\nDaily psychological distress. --We measured daily psycho-\nlogical distress by using 10 items designed specifically for the\nMIDUS. This scale was developed from the following well-\nknown and valid instruments: The Affect Balance Scale\n(Bradburn, 1969), the University of Michigan's Composite\nInternational Diagnostic Interview (Kessler et al., 1994), the\nManifest Anxiety Scale (Taylor, 1953), and the Center for\nEpidemiological Studies\u00adDepression scale (Radloff, 1977).\nRespondents were asked questions such as these: How much\nof the time today did you feel worthless; hopeless; nervous;\nrestless or fidgety; that everything was an effort; and so sad that\nnothing could cheer you up? They rated their response on a\n5-point scale ranging from none of the time to all of the time.\nWe summed scores across the 10 items for each day. This scale\nhas also demonstrated good reliability and validity in previous\nDaily stressors. --We assessed daily stressors through the\nsemi-structured Daily Inventory of Stressful Events (Almeida\net al., 2002). The inventory consisted of a series of seven stem\nquestions asking whether certain types of daily stressors (i.e.,\narguments, potential arguments, work stressors, home stressors,\nnetwork stressors, discrimination stressors, and other stressors)\nhad occurred in the past 24 hours. For each daily interview,\nindividuals who responded affirmatively to the stem questions\nreceived a value of one for the relevant stressor domain. We\nassigned scores of zero to domains where no stressors were\nexperienced on that day. The present study utilized four stressor\ndomain variables: interpersonal stressors (whether an argument\nor potential argument occurred; 44% of all stressors reported),\nwork stressors (whether anything happened at work that could\nbe stressful; 18% of all stressors reported), home stressors\n(whether anything happened at home that could be stressful;\n15% of all stressors reported), and network stressors (whether\nanything happened to a close friend or family member that\nturned out to be stressful for the respondent; 10% of all\nstressors reported). Interpersonal, work, home, and network\nstressors represent 87% of all stressors reported. The remaining\n13% of stressors included experiences of discrimination (1.2%)\nand those not falling under any specific category (11.8%).\nControl beliefs. --Researchers assessed control belief varia-\nbles in the MIDUS survey. These measures were developed\nfrom Pearlin and Schooler's (1978) mastery scale with five\nadditional items specifically designed for the MIDUS (Lach-\nman & Weaver, 1998b). Respondents rated on a 7-point scale\n(1 \u00bc strongly agree, 7 \u00bc strongly disagree) how strongly they\nagreed with each statement. For the mastery scale, respondents\nanswered the following questions: (a) I can do just about\nanything I really set my mind to; (b) when I really want to do\nsomething, I usually find a way to succeed at it; (c) whether or\nnot I am able to get what I want is in my own hands; and (d)\nwhat happens to me in the future depends mostly on me.\nResearchers coded responses so higher scores indicated greater\npersonal mastery for each person (a \u00bc 0.70). For the constraint\nscale, respondents answered the following questions: (a) there\nis really no way I can solve all the problems I have; (b) there is\nlittle I can to do change the important things in my life; (c) I\noften feel helpless in dealing with the problems in life; (d) other\npeople determine most of what I can and cannot do; (e) what\nhappens in my life is often beyond my control; (f) there are\nmany things that interfere with what I want to do; (g) I have\nlittle control over the things that happen to me; and (h) I some-\ntimes feel I am being pushed around in my life. Researchers\ncoded responses so higher scores indicated greater perceived\nconstraints for each person (a \u00bc 0 .86). These measures have\nbeen used successfully as valid indicators of personal mastery\nand perceived constraint in several studies (e.g., Lachman &\nassociated with each other in the current study; r(1,021)\u00bc\u00c0.44,\nCovariates. --Because men and women tend to differ in their\naverage mood (Almeida & Kessler, 1998) and physical\nsymptom reports (Verbrugge, 1985), we controlled for gender\nin all analyses. We further controlled for socioeconomic status\n(using education as a proxy) because of the differential\nemotional and physical reactivity to daily stressors found\npreviously in the literature (Grzywacz et al., 2004).\nANALYSES\nWe implemented multilevel modeling using SAS Proc\nMixed to examine emotional and physical reactivity to daily\nstressors. In this framework, individual change or variability is\nrepresented by a two-level hierarchical model (Hawkins, Guo,\nHill, Battin-Pearson, & Abbott, 2001). At Level 1, each\nperson's variability is expressed as an individual regression\nequation that depends on a set of parameters (intercept and\nslope). These individual parameters become the outcome\nvariables in a Level 2 model, where they may depend on some\nperson-level characteristics.\nMultilevel modeling is frequently used to model intra-\nindividual variability (i.e., people's variability around their own\naverage). This technique was useful in the current study\nbecause we examined interindividual differences (e.g., age and\ncontrol belief differences) in intraindividual covariation (e.g.,\nthe within-person relationship between stressors and psycho-\nlogical distress). For example, to examine age and constraint\ndifferences in emotional reactivity to interpersonal stressors,\nwe created dummy codes for middle-aged (40\u00ad59 years)\nand older (60\u00ad74 years) adults. We formulated the following\nmodel:\nLevel 1: Distressit\n\u00f0Interpersonal Stressor\u00de\u00ferit\n\u00f0Education\u00de\n\u00f0Constraint\u00de\n\u00f0Middle3Constraint\u00de\n\u00f0Old3Constraint\u00de\u00feu0i\n\u00f0Constraint\u00de\n\u00f0Middle3Constraint\u00de\n\u00f0Old3Constraint\u00de\u00feu1i\nIn Equation 1, the intercept (b0it\n) is defined as the expected\nlevel of psychological distress for person i on days when no in-\nterpersonal stressors occurred (i.e., Interpersonal Stressor \u00bc 0).\nSlope b1it\nis the expected change in psychological distress\nassociated with days when interpersonal stressors occur. Error\nterm rit\nrepresents a unique effect associated with person i (i.e.,\nfluctuation around the mean). Equation 2 includes gender and\neducation as covariates and tests for age and constraint\ndifferences in the average level of psychological distress, with\nrepresenting the average level of psychological\ndistress for younger women (Gender \u00bc 0) with less than a high\nschool degree (Education \u00bc 0) with average constraint levels\n(control belief variables were centered around their grand\nmean). Equation 3 tests for age and constraint differences in the\nwithin-person association between interpersonal stressor expo-\nsure and psychological distress, with intercept c10\nrepresenting\nthe average relationship between interpersonal stressors and\npsychological distress for younger adults. Interindividual\nfluctuations from the level and slope are represented by u0i\n, respectively.\nRESULTS\nDescriptive Statistics\nTable 1 presents means and standard deviations of the study\nvariables for each age group. Although there were no age\ndifferences in levels of physical symptoms, younger adults\nreported higher levels of psychological distress than middle-\naged and older adults did, and they reported higher levels of\npersonal mastery than middle-aged adults did. In contrast, older\nadults had higher levels of perceived constraints than did\nyounger adults. Across all participants, interpersonal stressors\n(21.44% of days) were the most frequently reported stressors,\nfollowed by work stressors (9.36% of days), home stressors\n(7.9% of days), and network stressors (5.52% of days). Younger\nadults reported more frequent work stressors than did older\nadults, and they also reported more frequent interpersonal and\nhome stressors than did middle-aged and older adults. There\nwere no age differences in the frequency of network stressors.\nMultilevel Models\nResults from fully unconditional models indicated that 54%\nof the variability in psychological distress was between people\nvariability in physical symptoms was between people (s00\n\u00bc\nwas sufficient variability in each outcome variable at each level,\nwhich is necessary for further analyses (Nezlek, 2001;\nWe conducted multilevel models to examine the hypotheses\nthat (a) older age would be related to higher levels of daily\nemotional well-being and to reduced emotional reactivity to\ndaily stressors; (b) higher levels of personal mastery and lower\nlevels of constraints would each be related to higher levels of\nboth daily emotional and physical well-being; (c) higher levels\nof personal mastery and lower levels of constraint would be\nrelated to reduced reactivity in response to stressors for people\nat all ages; and (d) perceived control (both constraint and\nmastery) would have a stronger relationship with emotional and\nphysical reactivity to interpersonal stressors among younger\nadults than among older adults. Models examining the afore-\nmentioned questions are presented in Tables 2 through 5.\nAcross all models, older adults reported less psychological\ndistress than younger adults did (c04\n). People with higher levels\nof constraint reported more distress than did those with less\n), and older adults were\ndifferent from the younger adults in the relationship between\nconstraint and distress (see Tables 2 and 4, c07\n). Across all\nmodels, women reported more physical health symptoms than\nmen, but there were no gender differences in psychological\ndistress. Education was negatively associated with physical\nhealth symptoms and psychological distress.\nReactivity to interpersonal stressors. --In the first model in\nTable 2, we examined age and constraint differences in\nemotional reactivity to interpersonal stressors. Findings indicate\nthat both middle-aged (c11\n) adults were\nsignificantly less reactive than the young adults (c10\n), that\npeople with higher levels of constraint were more reactive (c13\n),\nand that middle-aged (c14\n) adults were\nsignificantly different from younger adults in their constraint\ndifferences in reactivity. The age and constraint differences in\nemotional reactivity to interpersonal stressors are presented in\nFigure 1. This figure plots psychological distress on days when\nan interpersonal stressor occurred and days when there were no\nreported interpersonal stressors for individuals with high and\nlow levels of constraints. The pattern indicates that younger\nadults with high levels of constraints were the most emotionally\nreactive to interpersonal stressors (i.e., highest level of distress\non interpersonal stressor days). This model accounted for 38%\nof the between-person variability and 13% of the within-person\nvariability in psychological distress, which are estimates of\na pseudo-R2 (Singer & Willett, 2003). (Note that we plotted all\nfigures by conducting additional models for individuals who\nscored lower than 1 SD below the control belief mean,\nidentified as low constraint and low mastery, and higher than 1\nSD above the control belief mean, identified as high constraint\nand high mastery.)\nThe second model in Table 2 examined age and control be-\nlief differences in physical reactivity to interpersonal stressors.\nTable 1.

The second\nsection of the model indicates that people with higher levels\nof constraint were more physically reactive to interpersonal\n), and that middle-aged adults (c14\n) were different from younger adults in their constraint differences in reactivity,\nbut older adults (c15\n) were not different from younger adults\n(see Figure 2). Figure 2 indicates that younger adults with\nhigh constraints were the most physically reactive to inter-\npersonal stressors. This model accounted for 12% of the\nbetween-person variability and 4% of the within-person vari-\nability in physical symptoms.\nWe also examined whether there were differences in daily\npsychological distress and physical symptoms as a function of\nmastery. For both emotional and physical reactivity, there were\nno mastery differences in the responses to interpersonal\nstressors across the adult life span.\nTable 4.

Age and constraint differences in emotional reactivity to\ninterpersonal stressors, adjusted for gender and education.\nReactivity to work stressors. --We examined the hypothesis\nthat control beliefs would be especially important for middle-\naged adults' reactivity to work stressors in Table 3. The first\nmodel in Table 3 indicates that older adults reported less\ndistress than did younger adults (c04\n), younger adults' distress\nwas more closely tied to mastery compared with that of middle-\n), and people with higher mastery were less\nemotionally reactive to work stressors than were those\nindividuals with less mastery (c13\n). There were no age and\nmastery differences in emotional reactivity to work stressors,\nsuggesting that high mastery was equally beneficial for\nemotional reactivity to work stressors for all age groups.\nThis model accounted for 11% of the between-person vari-\nability and 5% of the within-person variability in psychological\ndistress.\nThe second model in Table 3 examined age and control\nbelief differences in physical reactivity to work stressors.\nPeople with lower levels of mastery reported more physical\n), but there were no age differences in the\naverage number of symptoms reported (c03,\n). The second\nsection of the model indicates that people with lower levels of\nmastery were more physically reactive to work stressors (c13\n),\nmiddle-aged adults were less reactive to work stressors than\nwere younger adults (c11\n), and that middle-aged adults (c14\n)\nwere different from younger adults in their mastery differences\nin reactivity (see Figure 3).

When examining the\nrole of constraint for physical reactivity to network stressors,\nwe found that a high level of constraint was associated with\nincreased reactivity (c13\n). Similar to the pattern exhibited in\nFigure 4, this finding was further qualified by age where lower\nlevels of constraint were more beneficial for middle-aged\nFigure 2.

This model accounted for 8% of the between-person\nand 2% of the within-person variability in psychological\ndistress. In sum, these models indicate that control in midlife\nis important for buffered reactivity to network stressors.\nDISCUSSION\nThe current study examined age and control belief differ-\nences in reactivity to daily stressors at three different stages in\nthe adult life span. We incorporated the four most common\ndomains of daily stressors and examined whether there were\nage differences in reactivity. By including stressors that may be\ndifferentially salient across the life span (e.g., work stressors\nin midlife), we also examined whether age differences in re-\nactivity to these stressors depended on perceptions of control.\nWe added gender and education as covariates in the models.\nThe education differences in both indicators of well-being as\nwell as the gender differences in physical health supported\nAge differences in reactivity. --As we predicted, middle-aged\nand older adults evidenced a smaller increase in psychological\ndistress in response to interpersonal stressors than did younger\nadults, and middle-aged adults were less physically reactive to\nwork stressors than were younger adults. These age patterns\nare consistent with many studies in which older age is related\nto reduced stressor reactivity (Birditt et al., 2005), reduced\nduration of negative emotions (Carstensen, Pasupathi, Mayr, &\nNesselroade, 2000), and increased well-being (Charles,\nPreserved and even enhanced emotion regulation with age is\nconsistent with socioemotional selectivity theory (Carstensen,\n1999), which posits that emotional goals become increasingly\nimportant as people grow older, so resources could be directed\nat buffering the negative emotional effects of stressors.\nEnhanced emotion regulation could also be due to learning\nthrough an accumulation of experiences, as well pursuing\nvalued outcomes (Deci & Ryan, 2000). In the present study, we\nwere interested to see if the emotion-regulation findings of\nBirditt and colleagues and socioemotional selectivity theory\ncould be applied to stressors outside of the social domain. Our\nfindings suggest that there are no age differences in emotional\nor physical reactivity to home or network stressors. Although\nhome and network stressors were both associated with an\nincrease in psychological distress and physical symptoms, this\nincrease was consistent across the adult life span. It is important\nto note, however, that these domain-specific age differences in\nreactivity for interpersonal, network, and work stressors were\nfurther qualified by control beliefs.\nAge, perceived constraints, and reactivity to interpersonal\nand network stressors. --Consistent with previous work\nimportant for mitigating the negative effects of interpersonal\nstressors. Although high levels of perceived constraints were\nrelated to worse outcomes for people of all ages, this\nrelationship was stronger among younger adults than among\nmiddle-aged and older adults. Younger adults who reported\nhigh levels of perceived constraints reacted most strongly to\ndaily interpersonal stressors, reporting more psychological\ndistress and more physical symptoms on these days compared\nwith days when no interpersonal stressors occurred. Age\ndifferences in life circumstances and life goals may partially\nexplain this finding. As suggested by socioemotional selectivity\ntheory, establishing relationships is an important goal for\nyounger adults, making this a salient area for stressors and\nimportant for reactivity when control is perceived as low. This\ntheory also posits that older adults may be better at regulating\ntheir responses to interpersonal stressors even in the face of\nperceived constraints because of a focus on emotional goals and\nawareness of reduced time left in life. High constraint was\ndetrimental for younger adults' physical symptoms when we\nexamined network stressors, but it was detrimental for older\nadults' as well. Although network stressors are social in nature,\nthey encompass events other than arguments and disagreements\nand may be particularly vulnerable to constraints for older\nadults, who may experience more uncontrollable kinds of\nstressors in their social networks (e.g., health-related stressors;\nsee Almeida et al., 2002). This finding also highlights the\nsuggestion by Ensel and Lin (2000) for researchers to examine\nphysical distress in addition to psychological distress, as the\npatterns of reactivity are different.\nAge, personal mastery, and reactivity to work and network\nstressors. --High levels of personal mastery were associated\nwith reduced emotional and physical reactivity to work\nstressors, but this relationship did not appear to hold for\nmiddle-aged adults' physical reactivity; that is, middle-aged\nadults exhibited heightened physical reactivity to work stressors\nregardless of their level of mastery. This finding supports\nprevious research suggesting that the importance of the work\ndomain typically increases in midlife (Clark-Plaskie & Lach-\nman, 1999). Because of the increased salience of work during\nmidlife, it is possible that stressors in this domain are\nparticularly threatening to middle-aged adults and that they\nexperience increased physical symptoms even if, as previous\nresearch suggests (e.g., Heise, 1990), they report more control\nover work than do younger adults. A high sense of global\nmastery does not appear to be enough to counteract the negative\nprimary appraisal of work stressors. Primary appraising (e.g.,\nLazarus, 1999) involves the relevance of what is happening to\none's values, goal commitments, and beliefs about self and\nworld; whether an individual experiences distress as a result of\na stressor depends upon the appraisal of the situation. Previous\nwork suggests that work-specific control beliefs are important\nfor well-being (Elfering et al., 2005), but future research able to\nmap work-stressor-specific control beliefs could directly test if\ncertain aspects of control may be differentially important for\nmiddle-aged adults' reactivity to work stressors.\nHigh mastery was more beneficial for middle-aged adults'\nemotional reactivity to network stressors than for younger or\nmiddle-aged adults'. Because mastery can involve problem-\nfocused solutions and active goal striving (Lachman & Firth,\naged adults may be called upon to assist with the stressors in\ntheir social networks. For example, middle-aged adults may\nprovide care and support for aging parents and young children\nand need to solve problems stemming from both social roles\n(e.g., Schlesinger, 1989), in which case a sense of mastery that\none can solve problems would be extremely beneficial to\ncombating the stressors. A high sense of control was not\nbeneficial for older adults' reactivity to network stressors, so\nfuture research able to examine the specific sources of network\nstressors and the age differences associated with them could\naddress whether the context, sense of control, or age of the\nperson is more important for reactivity. Future work in-\ncorporating measures of positive affect could examine whether\nthe patterns of emotional reactivity depend on valence.\nAdditionally, examining the perceived threat and severity of\nthe stressors could be an important step for future work, as\nAlmeida and Horn (2004) found some age differences in\nstressor threat dimensions (danger and frustration) and sub-\njective severity ratings.\nConclusions\nWe found that middle-aged and older adults were less\nphysically and emotionally reactive to interpersonal stressors,\nand, before we considered the role of perceived control, middle-\naged adults were less physically reactive to work stressors.\nWe also documented the salutary effects of low perceived\nconstraints and high personal mastery in buffering the\nemotional and physical repercussions of daily interpersonal,\nnetwork, and work stressors. We further found that these\ninfluences vary by age, such that low perceived control was\nmore detrimental for younger adults than it was for middle-aged\nor older adults in the context of daily interpersonal stressors.\nWith respect to daily work stressors, low levels of mastery were\ndetrimental for all age groups, but adults in midlife were\nphysically reactive even when they reported high levels of\nmastery. Constraint was associated with increased physical\nreactivity to network stressors for all ages, but it exacerbated\nthe reactivity of younger and older adults in particular.\nFurthermore, younger and older adults with low mastery\nexhibited increased emotional reactivity to network stressors.\nWe interpret these findings as reflecting differences in life\ncircumstances with age and also stressor domain.\n"
