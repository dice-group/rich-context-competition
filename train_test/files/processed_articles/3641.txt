Based on a two-year online and\noffline ethnographic project on social media use in later life, insights are provided into how the\npractices and meanings of ethnography are being reconstructed and negotiated in response to the\nexplosion of digital social data and through team practices. This paper reviews how collaborative\nand interdisciplinary ethnographic reflection is sustained and extended by digital tools, creating a\nlive source of data that can be analysed within the framework of ethnography. As a contribution\nto current debates on the 'Social Life of Methods', it also reviews epistemic issues associated\nwith digital data and team ethnography, such as the role of the ethnographer(s), the field(s) and\ncomputational data analysis. The article reaches the conclusion that digital team ethnography is a\nviable option for undertaking thick and descriptive studies about the use of social media, which in\nturn favours a collaborative, non-hierarchical and dialogue-driven knowledge production process.\n",

Digital data includes plat-\nforms, applications and devices as a resource for social inquiry (Housley et al., 2014). In\nparticular, three core elements of ethnography are reviewed: the construction of the eth-\nnographic object, fieldwork, and fieldnotes. Analysing these core elements in this par-\nticular context allows the relation between knowledge production in teams and digital\ndata to be discussed. It also enables a better understanding of how a team of ethnogra-\nphers immersed themselves into fieldwork, craft fieldnotes and engaged in the reflexiv-\nity process while producing a nuanced account of social media use in later life.\nThere has recently been a call for \"thick and descriptive\" studies on the current use of\nsocial media and its social implications (Beer and Burrows, 2007; Boyd, 2008; Selwyn\nand Grant, 2009). Consequently, over the last two decades, we have witnessed an increase\nin ethnographic research into online social life (Boellstorff, 2008; Boyd, 2014; Miller\nies has led to an expansion of the methodological toolbox used to capture online and\noffline social interactions (Beneito-Montagut, 2011; Hallet and Barber, 2014; Hine,\n2007; Leander and McKim, 2003), though there has been limited attention to teams\ndoing digital ethnography. This paper attempts to tackle this knowledge gap by discuss-\ning how recent forms of digital data play a significant role in research methods (Edwards\net al., 2013), particularly in the case of team ethnography.\nSince ethnography `plays a complex and shifting role in the dynamic tapestry' of the\nand widespread adoption of digital technologies in our everyday life has led to a revisit-\ning of the classical ethnographic debates surrounding the role of the researcher and the\nobservability of social phenomena (Postill and Pink, 2012). The conditions for ethnogra-\nphy have thus changed and its practice challenged due to the impossibility of observing\nfull accounts of social interaction, which can now occur online, too. The very definition\nof ethnography has been called into question due to increased social mobility, globaliza-\ntion and hyper-connectivity, as well as constant changes in Internet applications and\nservices, and the availability of digital data. Furthermore, since some limitations of eth-\nnography derive from a lack of funding and time, as well as an emphasis on research\npolicy expectations (or impact) and the need for quick results, the academic research\nagenda and mode of knowledge production can be restrictive. For instance, in the UK,\nresearch impact and publications are highly affected by the implicit schedule and agenda\nset by the Research Excellence Framework (REF) exercise. Researchers are under pres-\nsure to demonstrate the impact of their research on the public policy process. In addition,\ngrant applications typically favour team research over individual endeavours (Creese\nIt is worth describing the ethnographic implications of research on social media. Team\nethnography may be a way to address some of these limitations without compromising\nhigh-quality, rigorous and valuable results, and ensuring slow and long ethnographic\nprojects. Yet, it is needed to explore how team ethnography can be conducted in and\nthrough the digital environment, where researchers can carry out fieldwork online both\nsynchronously and asynchronously, and fieldnotes can be produced, shared and com-\nmented on collaboratively, in real time or in near real time, and independently of the\nresearchers' locations. In turn, the research process itself can generate digital data based\non the online interactions between the researchers themselves, as well as between the\nresearchers and the participants. Digital platforms and tools are essential elements in this\nprocess; they are also able to deliver digital footprints of the aforementioned social inter-\nactions, which can then be incorporate to the project data corpus with other forms of data\n(such as fieldnotes) and generate a set of 'data flows'. In this context, data flow refers to\nthe path taken by data within a research project, as it moves from its source to a data\nrepository. In the case of this research, all the data were imported to NVivo. These data\nare live and continuously produced independently of the research project, in the form of\n'locomotive data' (Edwards et al., 2013).\nRecent ethnographic teams, such as Clerke and Hopwood (2014) and Creese et al.\n(2008), have provided detailed accounts of how work is produced in teams and how this\nprocess is carried out (Schlesinger et al., 2015). This research is particularly interested in\nthe latter point, not only regarding internal team dynamics, but also with respect to the\nroles that digital data and digital technologies play within this process. The paper first\nreviews recent ethnographic projects and conceptualizes two models of doing ethnogra-\nphy in teams by focusing on the researchers'roles throughout the project and the division\nof labour amongst the research team. Following this literature review, there is an intro-\nduction of the digital ethnographic team project on which this paper is based. The team-\nwork process is then discussed in relation to the ethnographic object, the fieldwork and\nthe writing of fieldnotes. This section is significant because it presents both online and\noffline approaches to team fieldwork. Since fieldnotes are primary data in ethnography,\nthe following section discusses the processes of interpretation and reflection that took\nplace as a result of using digital data through the joint fieldnotes strategy. The paper then\nintroduces the two digital data flows that complemented the primary ethnographic data:\n(1) the product of an ongoing conversation among researchers; and (2) the digital data\ncollected from participants' social interactions via social media. The process of doing\ndigital ethnography in teams then leads to a discussion about knowledge production in\nteams and digital data. Finally, this paper concludes by stating how fruitful this scenario\nmay be for current research methodology and for the study of social life online.\nTeam ethnography\nAlthough ethnographic research teams are common, the idea of a 'lone ranger'or solitary\n'lone wolf'has pervaded ethnographic practice for many years (Douglas, 1976; Mitteness\nand Barker, 2004). Not much has been written about team or collaborative ethnography\nand nothing has seemingly been produced regarding digital team ethnography. Online\nethnography itself has been characterized as a lone researcher performing fieldwork par-\ntially or completely behind a device screen, for example, a computer, smartphone or\nThe issue of team ethnography has been addressed by reviews of its methodological\nand practical implications (Erickson and Stull, 1998; Wasser and Bressler, 1996). Team\nand collaborative ethnographic literature not only describes the relationships among\nresearchers working together, but also the relationships between researchers and partici-\npants. The particular study discussed here, however, focuses on the relationships between\nresearchers and their role within a research team. Rather than dealing with detailed ter-\nminological distinctions, a brief selection of team and/or collaborative ethnographic pro-\njects have been included1,2. Some examples of team ethnography will be provided\nrevolving around two axes: the number of settings, and the level of researcher collabora-\ntion during the different stages of the research process. The purpose is not to provide an\nexhaustive or detailed list. The main goal of this review, instead, is two-fold. First, it\nseeks to provide significant examples of team ethnography where experiences are shared\nrather than divided. Second, it aims to highlight how team ethnography is not just a\nchange of scale; rather, there are differences between the processes of doing ethnography\nindividually and in teams that affect all stages of an ethnographic project (Jarzabkowski,\nThere are several models available through which to conduct team ethnography, rang-\ning from very close teamwork to researchers working individually for the most part and\nonly together at specific stages of the research project. It is the level of teamwork or\nindividualism that ultimately determines the model. Having reviewed recent team ethno-\ngraphic projects, it has been possible to conceptualize two different models according to\nthe level of collaboration among team members: multi-sited team ethnography and being\nin the field together. Due to the lack of ethnographic teamwork in the digital realm, the\nexamples provided here are not exclusive to this context. The few digital ethnographic\nprojects found that included teamwork did not contain a great amount of detail regarding\nhow the research was undertaken (Fields and Kafai, 2009; Murchison and Coats, 2015).\nIn multi-sited team ethnography, individualism is often involved in fieldwork. In this\nmodel, team ethnography is understood as several ethnographers investigating the same\nissue in different settings in order to access multiple sites (Gerstl-Pepin and\nproject was a sub-category of this model, referred to as collaborative media ethnogra-\nphy, which included ethnographic exploration of the same topic conducted in different\nplaces in both the UK and abroad. It even included a virtual ethnography of jihadist\nwebsites (Awan, 2007). This project made use of an e-Discussion group, which enabled\nongoing sharing and re-evaluation of emergent findings (Gillespie, 2007). Another\ncommon team organisation within this model is that of experienced researchers leading\nthe research project and junior researchers (including graduate students) conducting\nfieldwork in small teams and adopting different roles throughout the research project\n(Gerstl-Pepin and Gunzenhauser, 2002). In this type of team ethnography, there is usu-\nally a clear and hierarchical division of labour. The challenge in this model arises when\nfieldnotes offer different interpretations and perspectives in the observation of the same\nsituation. A recent example of multi-sited digital team ethnography is The Global Social\nMedia Impact Study, which involved nine ethnographies in multiple sites around the\nworld conducted by individuals investigating the use of social media (Miller et al.,\n2016). Although the research project scheduled team meetings and monthly online\nupdates on previously set topics, each ethnographer was responsible for the whole\nresearch process for each site, from the selection of the field to the writing of the results.3\nIt is therefore clear that this type of ethnographical study is primarily done by a solo\nresearcher, who produces a detailed account of the object of study through in-depth\nimmersion in a single local community.\nThe other team ethnography model involves being in the field together (Adler and\nHere, researchers share the experience of being in the field and conducting fieldwork,\nalthough the fieldwork does not necessarily have to be the same experience, with\nresearchers being able to focus and reflect upon different issues (Rix-Li\u00e8vre and Li\u00e8vre,\n2010). The division of labour in this model does not relate to either the fieldwork or to\nthe project stages, since all researchers are somehow involved in all phases of the eth-\nnographic project.\nFor Clerke and Hopwood (2014), being in the field together did not require being\nthere concurrently, as both researchers undertook fieldwork in the same setting but not\nat the same time. They shared some field visits but most of their observations were done\nindividually. The same was true for May and Pattillo-McCoy's (2000) research as part\nof the Chicago Comparative Neighbourhood Study (CNS), whereby fieldnotes were\nalso produced individually. Similarly, Schlesinger (2015) and the rest of the team\nadopted different roles during the fieldwork and the three researchers were seldom\ntogether in the field at the same time. In the model of being in the field together, all\nphases require the collaboration of all researchers, from defining the ethnographic\nobject to producing the fieldnotes, as part of a fieldwork experience that is intrinsically\nAt this point, it is worth bearing in mind the projects that have combined these two\nmodels. Jarzabkowski et al. (2015) collaborated on a project that started with a multi-\nsited approach (i.e. each researcher performed fieldwork in one setting) but which later\nchanged tack, with researchers moving from one setting to another to complement one\nother's points of view. Thus, every researcher was able to experience every setting. May\nand Pattillo-McCoy (2000) also took advantage of a mixed approach by using several\nteams of two researchers situated in different settings, as did Woods et al. (2000), who\ncombined the two models through a flexible approach.\nFor this project, the processes of being part of a team and collaborating are not mutu-\nally exclusive. While team ethnography applies to any ethnographic project involving\nmore than one researcher in any of its phases, collaborating within a team entails collec-\ntive sense-making processes in any or all stages of the research process. Despite the\ndevelopments in recent literature, little is known about how teams of ethnographers work\ntogether, the concrete methods they adopt, and the ways in which they conduct their\nresearch. Developing this one step further, it seems apparent that even less is known\nabout the digital tools and data that are capable of contributing to team ethnography.4\nDoing digital team ethnography\nIn terms of the approach for this project, digital ethnography was performed as a team by\nfollowing the classical approach of Erickson and Stull (1998), which considers team\nethnography as a valid model due to its set-up as a deliberative process. This was consid-\nered the best way of dealing not only with the complex and interrelated definition of\n`team'and `collaboration'in ethnographic research, but also with the meaning of `digital'\nwith respect to ethnography and the recent debates around such a topic (Marres and\nThe research posed a set of questions aiming to explore how the everyday-life prac-\ntices of older adults in social media helped build and maintain social relationships, as well\nas to investigate the entangled relationships between social media use and social isolation.\nIn doing so, the eventually aimed to describe the qualities and materialities of social rela-\ntionships and social media. The project followed a multi-situated and user-centred meth-\nodological approach, entailing both online and offline fieldwork as well as an analysis of\nmultimedia data (Beneito-Montagut, 2011). Turning away from a loneliness-led approach\n\u00ad one that focuses only on isolation and experiences of loneliness \u00ad meant asking new\nresearch questions. So instead of asking `What goes wrong?' for people who suffer social\nisolation, asking `What goes right for people who continue with meaningful social rela-\ntionships in later life?'had the potential to offer new insights that could be applied to other\npeople wishing to improve their quality of life regarding social relationships.\nThe ethnography took place in Catalonia, Spain, in four community centres for older\nadults5 and via several social media applications, as well as in participants' homes and\npublic spaces such as cafes. Using the community centres as an access point, 20 social\nmedia users over the age of 646 (11 males and 9 females) were recruited, with online\ninteraction with these participants beginning after an entry interview. Entry interviews\nrevealed information about the participants' social media use and personal relationships.\nInteracting with them online involved being present in every social media service or\nplatform they used (mainly Facebook, WhatsApp and email, although a small number of\nparticipants also used Twitter and Instagram) during the two years of fieldwork. It also\ninvolved collecting social media data from the participants' online activity. During a\nperiod of five weeks, the social media activity of each user was collected, both as a\nspreadsheet containing metadata and as visual data from screenshots converted into PDF\ndocuments (Figure 1). The ethnography ended with an exit interview.\nThe next sections seek to analyse the experience of conducting digital team ethnogra-\nphy while investigating social media use in later life.\nThe ethnographic object and building a team\nThe project began with a single researcher undertaking the initial conceptualization;\nhowever, the inductive tradition that resists fixing detailed research goals too early in the\nresearch process allowed the topics to be elements rather than the foundational focus of\nthe study. The ethnographic object evolved while fieldwork unfolded and the project\nincorporated more team members. When attempting to define the ethnographic object,\nalmost all of the conversations among team members took place via email, video chats\nand through the sharing of documents on a cloud service, although the principal investi-\ngator -Roser Beneito-Montagut (RBM)- and Arantza Begueria -as researcher- (AB) did\nmeet face-to-face once at the beginning of the project. This section describes the process\nof defining the ethnographic object while the team was being assembled.\nIn 2012, RBM won a competitive grant to conduct research on the topic in Catalonia,\nSpain; a location in which she held an academic position. When initially defining the\nproject, the focus was predominantly on social media and relationships in later life; how-\never, stipulations outlined by the grant called for projects in the field of social inclusion.\nThus, the topic of social isolation was added to the focus of the study to increase the\nchances of getting funding. This decision was further consolidated by the impact and\nknowledge transfer agenda underpinning the grant call. The project started with a team\nof two researchers (RBM and AB) and later expanded to a team of three. Nizai\u00e1 Cassi\u00e1n\n(NC) joined the team ten months after the fieldwork commenced. As is usually the case\nin funded research projects, both researchers (AB and NC) were recruited for the project\nunder precarious fix-term contracts, and the team initially followed a hierarchical struc-\nture (Platt, 1976). The structure of academia as it currently stands meant that RBM had\nteaching and management commitments, as well as a job change at the beginning of the\nproject (from Catalonia to the UK, for a fixed-term position at a University), making it\nessentially impossible for her to spend much time in the offline field. Throughout all this,\nAB and NC remained in Catalonia.\nAll three researchers had had prior ethnographic experience, with RBM and AB hav-\ning both worked on online ethnography, as well as having highly interdisciplinary back-\ngrounds. In addition, both had a solid understanding of the crossroads of information,\ncommunication technologies and social sciences. RBM was a sociologist interested in\nemotions and social relationships online. AB was an anthropologist interested in the\ninteractions between the body, health and technology. NC was a social psychologist\ninterested in techno-care and community activism. RBM and AB also had a common\ninterest in social media, while RBM and NC shared an interest in later life studies.\nFigure 1. NVivo screenshots of Facebook's timeline and spreadsheet format with metadata.\nSource: own source.\nAlthough the team came from different disciplines, they all shared `a thoroughgoing\ncommitment to understanding other people's social worlds' (Atkinson, 2015: 5). This\naffinity went beyond disciplinary aspects: the three team members were `technologized\nresearchers' (Lash, 2002; Lunenfeld, 2000), in that they all had extended experience in\nvarious Internet technologies, and they were all female. This shared epistemological\napproach and subsequent affinity ultimately helped the members bond as a team.\nWhile all these commonalities within the team helped, their individual descriptions do\nnot reveal how the team established itself to carry out digital ethnography (Hammersley\nandAtkinson, 1995). This was achieved through constant interaction among the research-\ners, which mainly occurred online. Team building was indeed a gradual and iterative\nprocess, which started by focusing on the ethnographic object. As a response to AB and\nNC entering the project, the ethnography incorporated the social construction of the age-\ning body, civic activism and cultural-visual practices on social media as topics.\nThe following extract of an email between RBM and AB illustrates the type of con-\nversation that was held when negotiating the incorporation of such topics:\nAB. I'm going to start reading the references you gave me ... so, I'll be reading for a few days\n... Listen!, would it be too much to ask R2 to look for references about ageing+body, or\nageing+body+SM?, and even better if she could find ethnographic research ... if she doesn't\nhave time ... no worries.\nRBM. I already mentioned her about ageing and the body, but only related to Internet or social\nAnother relevant factor regarding team building was dependability due to geographical\ndistance. The offline fieldwork was done in Catalonia, but the RBM was living in the UK.\nRBM therefore needed to rely on, and trust, AB, which consequently allowed for the\nestablishment of a dependent relationship that blurred the hierarchical relationship embed-\nded in the academic status of each researcher. The geographical distance also necessitated\na continuous, constant and near real-time communication channel between both \u00ad and\nlater, among all three \u00ad researchers through digital technologies. The constant conversa-\ntion was not just limited to team debriefing meetings, but played a significant part in\nestablishing a dialogic and deliberative dynamic from the beginning of the project that\ncontinued throughout its entirety. This dialogue began with the negotiation of the initial\nteam and drew on the ethnographic object as explained, but it soon became a quotidian\nway of sharing and discussing ideas, thoughts and approaches. In turn, as communication\nwas not restricted to organisational and managerial issues, conversations about the defini-\ntion of the project produced a considerable amount of the digital data that was incorpo-\nrated into the project. These data contributed to what is called the first `data flow'.\nThus, the main ethnographic challenge was team building and establishing appropri-\nate means to keep an ongoing conversation and deliberative process that spanned all\nstages of the ethnographic project. In order to do this successfully, it was important to\ntake into consideration the characteristics of the team: a geographically distant PI,\nchanges in membership, and a hierarchical academic structure. For the project, affinity,\ninterdisciplinarity, dependability and dialogue were the key elements to team building.\n`Getting there together': online and offline team fieldwork\nIn the context of contemporary social relations, the observations of everyday life can be\ndifficult for ethnographic practice, as social interaction is becoming increasingly medi-\nated by digital technologies in many societies (Hallett and Barber, 2014). In this project,\ntalking with participants and spending time with them (Delamont, 2004) meant interact-\ning in face-to-face situations as well as in several online platforms. This was done in\norder to challenge the traditional idea of fieldwork. While traditional ethnography\n(observation and interviews) are still useful, researchers need to continue rethinking\nwhat counts as a field site and as fieldwork. Following Atkinson's (2015) argument,\n`field'is understood as a complex entity that is not bounded. This is even truer for digital\nethnography (for a summary of these ideas, see Hine, 2017). One of the core defining\nfactors of ethnographic fieldwork is the way in which the researcher's social interactions\nand personal relationships serve as the primary means of eliciting interpretations. This\nsection presents the fieldwork as a way of understanding the participants' everyday\nsocial media practices, which resulted in three complementary ethnographic observa-\ntions, as interpreted by the team. These three fields were then combined and used in one\nethnographic work.\nThroughout the two years the project lasted,AB was immersed in the field, interacting\ndaily with participants, both face-to-face and through social media platforms. Arantza\nentered the field by attending the social media workshops, where personal relationships\nwere soon forged. AB also visited a number of participants at their homes and spent lei-\nsure time with them. Such fieldwork involved establishing trust relationships with par-\nticipants and being an active part of their lives. While in the community centres, R1\nobserved participants using social media or, in some cases, learning how to use social\nmedia. During this time, different kinds of interactions took place, ranging from sharing\nplayful (Figure 2) or political content on Facebook to talking about it face-to-face at a\nFigure 2. A piece of graphic humour shared by a participant.\nSource: visual data collected from the social media practices of User 3.8\ncafe. The interactions also included intimate and personal matters. For example, one of\nthe participants had a long-distant romantic relationship that was mainly sustained over\nsocial media. AB became a confidant to this person. During the computer workshops,\nthey would show her the poems and songs they were planning on posting on Facebook\nfor their romantic partner, and in the evening they would talk to AB via Facebook mes-\nsenger about any recent developments regarding the relationship. Moreover, the team\nwere able to observe and further analyse any reactions to the Facebook posts, since they\nwere made publicly accessible. Thus, the online and offline observations allowed to draw\na complex picture of their social relationships.\nHowever, with their ethnographic roles being closer to the digital ethnographic tradi-\ntion through covert observation,7 both RBM and NC took on a different approach regard-\ning fieldwork. RBM observed participants online daily without ever being noticed,\nthough participants were informed about the presence of researchers during the observa-\ntion period. And despite some participants having the chance to meet face-to-face RBM\nat the beginning of the project, she was ultimately the veiled observer of the social inter-\nactions between AB and the participants, and their public activities on social media.\nRBM only had access to participants' online activity through the social media practices\nas provided by AB, who befriended and interacted with participants most regularly\nonline. RBM and NC approached this social media activity by observing how AB inter-\nacted with the participants. Another regular practice that the team undertook was to share\nand collect emails, pictures, memes and PowerPoint documents that the participants sent\nto AB or as a part of long email chains. Indeed, this was a common practice within the\nsample (Figure 2).\nThus, RBM was able to observe, on a daily basis, how the participants publicly inter-\nacted on social media, and was informed of private interactions as they happened between\nparticipants and AB from the beginning of the project. Since NC joined the project later,\nobservations during the first ten months were partial and took place asynchronously\nthrough the data captured with NCapture. Careful ethical considerations regarding online\nobservation and data collection were taken into account, continued and extended through-\nout the project. All participants were informed and gave their consent to be observed by\na team of researchers. Ethical issues on this research project were complex and their\ndiscussion, although critical and sustained as part of the ethnographic practice, are\nbeyond the focus of this paper.\nThis study moved away from a traditional view of ethnographic fieldwork and con-\nsidered online spaces, where participants socially interact, as enmeshed with physical\nspaces. Three experiences were also obtained: AB formed very close and personal rela-\ntionships with participants, whilst RBM and NC sustained two other more detached\nexperiences during the same period. It is worth noting that, despite only AB having a\nholistic experience (as will be explained in due course), the partial and limited experi-\nences of the other researchers still remain valuable for this project, since both were able\nto maintain their sociocultural perspectives as digital ethnographers through digital\nmeans as part of the team. In this study, being in the field together not only meant that all\nthe researchers collaborated in every stage of the research project, but in addition, since\ndifferent settings were observed, a multi-situated approach was adopted. Building on the\napproach of Erickson and Stull towards fieldwork, this involved `getting there together',\nbut ultimately `seeing the same thing differently' (1998: 15). They did not necessarily\nneed to rely only on participants' accounts via interviews, or AB's perspective found in\nthe fieldnotes. They were able to observe participants'social public interactions in online\nspaces. Hence, to see the same thing differently meant observing the same experience\n(everyday social media use in later life) in different fields. This eventually led to the\nconceptualization of fieldswork versus fieldwork.\nThe idea of fieldswork implies multiple ways to observe and an exemplar of team\nethnography. In this case, it entails three complementary observations. This conceptual-\nization recognizes the fact that fields are being produced by participants' activities, by\none's own activities as an individual and as a team of ethnographers working collabora-\ntively to understand a unique experience (Amit, 2000). In the entangled ethnographic\nmilieu of social interaction online and offline, the fieldwork is not fully observable from\na single setting, if observable at all, nor is it bounded, as explained before. It does not\nexist `out there'; it needs to be constructed. The `work' in `fieldswork' is not pluralized\nin order to recognize the exclusive conceptualization of the collaborative work under-\ntaken by the team (through ongoing conversation) and the focus of the study.\nFieldswork represents a multi-situated digital ethnography undertaken in several set-\ntings. The fields are also multiple beyond the multi-situatedness because they are\nobserved and interpreted by three researchers with different ethnographic roles and dif-\nferent, but complementary, experiences in the field. The concept of fieldswork recog-\nnizes that the construction of the field is closely bound to the participant and the\nresearcher. Fieldswork is not only a way of recognizing the multiple intertwined settings\nin which digital ethnography takes place, but also a way of recognizing the different roles\nof the ethnographers in a team where each ethnographer produces their own field (Hine,\nThis approach to ethnographic teamwork answers Jarzabkowski et al., who ques-\ntioned how it was possible to `make such ethnographies `whole' given that the ethno-\ngraphic experience of `being there' is said to be intrinsically personal' (2015: 7). The\nethnographic experience (the fieldwork) is understood to be specific to the individual\nexperience, but experiences (fieldswork) can be subjective and shared. Subjective selves\nshare their individual perspectives to construct a unique and nuanced account of every-\nday social media use in later life. This leads to the following discussion on how ethno-\ngraphic interpretation and reflection, as well as the unique nuanced account, were\nproduced through digital team ethnography.\n`Digital' fieldnotes: collaborative and interdisciplinary\nethnographic reflection\nFieldnotes `are the first written products of a field team's ethnographic gazes' (Erickson\nand Stull, 1998: 23). Therein, Erickson and Stull highlighted the relevance of systemati-\ncally sharing observations as essential to effective team research. This section examines\nhow fieldnotes were crafted during the observation period of this study by focusing on\nthe role of fieldnotes and the processes of collaborative reflection and interpretation.\nAlthough fieldwork and fieldnotes are typically intertwined, these elements are\ndiscussed separately here to describe the challenges and opportunities that the digital\nfactors add to each element.\nIn team ethnographic projects, there is usually a hierarchical split between data col-\nlection (fieldwork and the writing of fieldnotes) and data analysis processes (Schlesinger\net al., 2015). The PI does not generally participate in fieldwork but takes the lead in the\nanalysis and interpretation of results.\nThis was not the research approach in this project. Contrary to other ethnographic\nprojects, the data collection and data analysis was not divided, nor were three sets of\nfieldnotes (one for each field) produced. Fieldnotes were produced and expanded upon\non a regular basis by AB, the researcher who undertook the participant observation.\nThe process was as follows. AB took very brief fieldnotes in a notebook in the field.\nAfter each participant observation session in the community centre or other physical space,\na detailed description of the observation was written upon AB's return to home or the\noffice. When social interactions took place over a smart phone on the move, the procedure\nwas the same as for face-to-face observations. On these occasions, she sent an email to\nherself from the smart phone with brief notes about the interaction, which were then devel-\noped further at the desk. If the interaction occurred when working at the desk, the fieldnotes\nwere immediately produced and shared without rewriting them later, as part of a multitask-\ning routine. Upon completion, fieldnotes were uploaded to a secure cloud system and regu-\nlarly commented on by the RBM and NC whilst they were being produced. Such comments\nreflected the RBM's and NC's own perspectives and interpretations, based upon their own\nreadings and observations of participants' online interactions.\nThe nature of RBM's and NC's comments was two-fold. Firstly, they commented on\nthe participant observations that had not been observed by them (those which occurred\nin online and face-to-face private spaces). Secondly, they annotated and commented\nusing their own experience in the field and from their own disciplinary point of view. In\nthis sense, each reading and piece of writing added a subjective, interpretative layer to\nthe fieldnotes. This was referred to as interpretative team practice; in other words, a way\nto share and jointly produce interdisciplinary fieldnotes.\nThis approach to writing fieldnotes did not come without tension. At the beginning of\nthe project, AB explained in an email to the rest of the team that they found the whole\nprocess embarrassing due to doubts regarding the quality and adequacy of their notes,\nand the personal and intimate investment that such notes represented (Jackson, 1990). At\nthe beginning of the project, the fieldnotes were less personal and more neutral, but as\nthe project evolved, so did the personal and professional relationship among team mem-\nbers, and thus the fieldnotes became more personal and emotional. AB also used the\nfieldnotes to share with the other team members their feelings and emotions experienced\nthroughout the fieldwork.\nSince they were written for the team and not just for their own reference, AB also\nrecognized that their fieldnotes were longer and more detailed. Regarding the face-to-\nface settings and the private interactions via chats or emails, AB revealed: `I needed to\nexplain everything to you because you weren't there'.\nHowever, fieldnotes were not limited to writing about the participant observation\nundertaken in the community centres or online observations. Reflective team practice\noccurred in parallel. Reflexivity is recognized as a crucial element in the ongoing process\nof interpretation in ethnographic research (Clifford and Marcus, 1986; Geertz, 1998;\nGerstl-Pepin and Patrizio, 2009; Hammersley and Atkinson, 1995). Consequently, the\nfinal fieldnotes (those commented and annotated) were also about research decisions that\nneeded to be made during the project. This practice primarily took place in the same writ-\nten work as the interpretative practice but sometimes took the form of standalone sets of\nfieldnotes. It was also the starting point for systematically carrying out a collaborative\nreflection process and continuing the dialogic process that had started with the definition\nof the ethnographic object. As an illustration of this, AB wrote a set of fieldnotes that\ndiscussed and analysed the pros and cons of using a personal Facebook account or creat-\ning a new Facebook profile (which in turn would give easier access to the rest of the\nteam) to befriend participants. These particular fieldnotes sparked a conversation about\nthe research process and resulted in a shared reflection on the epistemic and ethical\nimplications of each option. It was eventually decided that R1 should use a personal\nsocial media account, since this would allow for a symmetric relationship that places\nboth the researcher and the participant on the same level of reciprocity. Ethnographic\npractices as individuals and as a team were constantly discussed, negotiated and reviewed\nthrough fieldnotes and emails.\nThe use of fieldnotes was interdisciplinary, systematic and live (Erickson and Stull,\n1998). Digital tools supported a real-time process for generating collaborative fieldnotes\nthat were interpretative and reflective. They were commented on and highlighted (Figure\n3) as a regular analytical process, and later coded and linked when uploaded to NVivo.\nThese data were also enriched by emails and chats among team members. Beyond the\ndata generated via fieldnotes, the ethnographic team's interpretation and reflection also\nproduced a `data flow' via email and chats, which also formed part of the interpretation\nand reflection. For example, the construction of the analytical coding scheme took place\nvia email, thus representing the raw data of the project's `reconstructed logic' (Woods\nFigure 3. Collaborative fieldnotes.\nSource: own source.\net al., 1998). To summarize, fieldnotes were enriched by the digital data generated by\nteam conversations that necessarily had to take place online. Sharing meant an interwo-\nven and fluid practice embedded within the research routine. Digital data and digital\ntools helped overcome the power-based limitations of traditional notions of dialogue for\nteam ethnographic fieldswork, allowing for meaning to be unveiled from symmetric\npositions within a team (Gerstl-Pepin and Gunzenhauser, 2002).\nKnowledge production\nThe aim of ethnography is to achieve deep understanding and in-depth knowledge. As a\nknowledge-based generation process involving an immersive experience, deep under-\nstanding and ongoing reflexivity, the distinctiveness of ethnography is as relevant to digi-\ntal team ethnography as to any other ethnographic project. Reflexivity as a result of team\nethnography leads to collaborative sensemaking and knowledge production processes that\nare distinct from those experienced by lone researchers (Jarzabkowski et al., 2015).\nThe relationship between research methods and technology has often been treated as\npurely instrumental, but the use of technology in this project entailed a more complex\nrole in the research process, as it was entangled in the object of the study and in the\nresearch process itself, which was highly technologized and mediated. It could be argued\nthat this allowed for a particular knowledge production process, which was impacted by\nboth (non-neutral) technology and by the team practices (dialogic, symmetric and reflec-\ntive practices). This ultimately leaves two questions. How do digital tools and media\naffect the process of collaborative knowledge production? How is digital ethnography\nknowledge production affected by analytical procedures (such as content analysis), and\nadvanced by digital data (data flows) and computational techniques?\nTo answer these questions, it is necessary to review how the data flows presented\nabove (digital footprints of interactions among researchers and digital footprints of par-\nticipants as part of their everyday life practices on social media) offer different possibili-\nties to augment ethnographic data (Edwards et al., 2013). These live data flows open up\nanalytical possibilities for ethnography. As members of a team, the ethnographic dialogic\npractices of this study were mostly sustained through digital media, which left digital\nfootprints of the several processes undertaken throughout. Uploading online conversa-\ntions to QDA software with data mining capabilities opened the door to the use of com-\nputerized data analysis techniques (such as word frequency analysis) for specific data\nsets (such as emails between the team negotiating the ethnographic object, building the\nteam, or the collaborative fieldnotes) (Figure 4). This data corpus also comprised medi-\nated interactions among the researchers as a consequence of the reflective process\nembedded in ethnographic approaches, which acted as an aide-m\u00e9moire. These pro-\ncesses were generally invisible before, and rarely produced analytical data with which to\nenhance ethnographic primary data.\nFurthermore, participants'online interactions produced another digital data flow through\ncontinuous data gathering that included computational techniques from participants' social\nmedia profiles and interactions. These data sets allowed for the application of the aforemen-\ntioned analytical procedures, as well. This does not mean, as claimed by Edward et al.\n(2013), that digital data provide researchers with an alternative to ethnographic immersion\nin online contexts, but it could contribute to the production of a more nuanced account of\nonlineandofflinesocialrelationships.Nonetheless,itisimportanttorecognizethat,although\nthese complementary analytical strategies were possible, this project privileged ethno-\ngraphic means of knowing through fieldswork and researchers'own selves.\nWasser and Bressler (1996) recognized that knowledge in collaborative teams can be\nricher, but there is also the danger of it becoming more diffused. Digital tools, digital\nmedia and computational data analysis can potentially prevent or restrict the dispersion\nof knowledge. These digital aspects can also sustain an ongoing dialogue and provide\ndata and analytical tools to disentangle team interpretations, and to explore meanings\nthat are veiled by the hierarchical relations of researchers in an ethnographic team.\nBy studying social media practices in later life through digital team ethnography, this\npaper has moved from an individual and personalized experience of constructing the eth-\nnographic object, fieldwork and fieldnotes (wherein a `lone ranger' is the knowledge pro-\nducer) to a decentralized and collaborative method of knowing. In this method of knowing,\nknowledge is constructed through several forms of interaction both with participants and\namong team members, including online interactions. The team practices described through-\nout this paper became part of how the ethnographers produced collaborative knowledge\nand created their ethnographic place.As Law et al. (2011) have argued, digital social media\nnot only facilitates new ways of organizing social life, but also of analysing it.\nConclusion\nThis article presented a methodological approach centred on the processes of doing digi-\ntal ethnography in teams. By describing how a team addressed three core elements of\nFigure 4.

This research found that digital team ethnography\nincreases the corpus of data that can be used to understand the social world under obser-\nvation. At the same time, team ethnography provides a research design that is compelling\nto the limits of current research environment and can provide a dense and high-quality\nunderstanding of social media practices, without accepting quick results. Digital team\nethnography requires very close collaboration and ongoing dialogue, which is sometimes\nchallenging to carry out without the use of social media platforms.\nThis account of a team doing digital ethnography to research both online and offline\nsocial media use in later life serves as an example of how to use digital tools and data,\nand shows the potential to augment research methods (Edwards et al., 2013). The paper\nhas also revealed how it is possible to uncover the human practices of social life and of\nIn summary, this paper suggests that digital team ethnography is a viable option for\nundertaking thick and descriptive studies about the use of social media and their social\nimplications, as presented here with the case of social media practices in later life. Doing\ndigital ethnography in teams not only involves working with the social actors that the\nresearch seeks to understand, but also with other researchers in constructing a joint\naccount. Digital team ethnography enhances the quality of research through the research-\ners' holistic co-construction of complex meaning and by employing the data generated.\n"
