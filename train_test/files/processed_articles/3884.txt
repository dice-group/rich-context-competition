    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe purpose of this study was to discover the transformation preschool teacher candidates go through in their perceptions\nabout teacher and teaching during their teacher education program. The participants of the study were 35 senior students\nenrolled in the preschool teacher education program at a university located in the Eastern Anatolian Region of Turkey. A\nqualitative survey instrument was conducted to examine the preservice teachers' perceptions. The data collected from the\nsurvey were analyzed by adopting a constant comparative coding method. The study revealed a change in the participants'\nperceptions about preschool education before and after they enrolled in the program. The hardest parts of teaching in\npreschool were the need of high level of energy, patience, and skills to manage the classroom while the most pleasurable\nsides were having fun, play opportunities, and the positive impact teachers make on children. The qualities of an ideal\npreschool program listed by the participants involved curriculum, physical environment, and social-emotional atmosphere\nwhile the themes regarding the ideal preschool teacher were revolved around the personal qualities, professional attitude,\nand professional knowledge and skills. Hence, the findings of this qualitative study can only be generalized in the context the\nstudy was conducted; however, the study could have important implications for preschool teacher education in Turkey and\nin other countries, and help the international readers perceive preschool teacher education from a different perspective.\n",

The general aim of these initiatives was to increase\nthe nation's young children's enrolment rates in preschool as\nmuch as possible. The national education statistics of formal\nthe Turkish Republic Ministry of National Education (MoNE;\nofchildren5yearsoldreceivedpreschooleducation.Following\nthe initiatives to improve preschool education, in the educa-\n(CoHE; 2007) revised the national teacher education curricula\nto increase the quality of teacher education in Turkey's univer-\nsities. Although the preschool education undergraduate pro-\ngram in use was revised in 2006, there is still a need for another\nrevision since the Turkish education system was reshaped in\nfrom Turkish preschool teacher education programs are\ngranted their preschool/kindergarten teaching license, and are\nentitled to teach in public and private preschools and kinder-\ngarten classes.\nMoNE (2011) defines professional qualities for preschool\nteachers in seven major areas: child development, communi-\ncating with families and involving families of young children,\nassessment, communication skills, creativity/aesthetic, col-\nlaboration with school and community, and professional\ndevelopment. Although the professional qualities in early\nchildhood and preschool education vary from country to\ncountry, those cited by the MoNE (2011) are common and\nuniversal areas for high-quality early childhood teaching\n(e.g., Center for the Study of Child Care Employment\n[CSCCE], 2008; European Commission, Directorate-General\nfor Education and Culture [EC, DGEC], 2011). However,\nrecent increase in the number of universities opening in every\n1University of North Carolina Wilmington, USA\n2Inonu University, Malatya, Turkey\nCorresponding Author:\nJale Aldemir, Department of Early Childhood, Elementary, Middle,\nLiteracy and Special Education, University of North Carolina Wilmington,\nEmail: aldemirj@uncw.edu\nA Program Review: Turkish Early\nChildhood Education Preservice Teachers'\nPerceptions About Teacher and Teaching\nJale Aldemir1 and G\u00f6k\u00e7e Kurt2\n Keywords\nperceptions, teacher education, preschool education, qualitative approach\n2 SAGE Open\ncity of Turkey brings the challenge of qualitative and quanti-\ntative shortage of human resources, and environmental facili-\nties in turn lower the quality of teachers trained by the same\ninstitutions (Mother Child Education Foundation [MCEF],\n2007). Therefore, preschool teacher education programs must\nreview their program outcomes through different means and\nresources to improve the quality of the preschool teacher edu-\ncation in Turkey.\nProblem of Research\nIt has been widely acknowledged that the process of pre-\nservice training greatly influences the formation of novice\nteachers' professional identities (Early et al., 2007;\nquality of the experience with formal knowledge during\nthe professional training as a factor affecting teachers' per-\nceptions about teaching. Black and Halliwell (2000), how-\never, accentuate the importance of teachers' past\nexperiences in shaping their teacher image. The research-\ners indicate that documenting and reflecting on individu-\nals' past educational experiences could help them discern\ntheir images about teaching. Similarly, Joram and Gabriele\n(1998) point to that teacher candidates use their previously\nconstructed ideas and perceptions to interpret the theoreti-\ncal and practical information they gain throughout their\nteacher education programs. While the research literature\non perceptions about teacher and teaching mostly focus on\nelementary and upper level, little known is preschool pre-\nservice teachers' perceptions about teacher and teaching,\nand how those perceptions affect formation of their profes-\nsional qualities.\nResearch Focus\nAs teacher educators, the authors of this article believe that it\nis imperative to discover the kinds of transformation pre-\nschool teacher candidates go through in their perceptions\nabout teacher and teaching during their teacher education\nprograms so that the preschool teacher education programs\nreview and revise their approach to training Turkey's grow-\ning preschool teacher workforce.\nMethod\nGeneral Background of Research\nIn the present study, the authors worked with the senior stu-\ndents of the preschool education program at an Eastern\nAnatolian University to answer the following research\nquestions:\nResearch Question 1 (RQ1): What are the demographic\ncharacteristics and previous experiences of the students in\nthe field of preschool education?\nResearch Question 2 (RQ2): Why the students chose\npreschool teaching as a profession?\nResearch Question 3 (RQ3): What were the most bene-\nficial courses for the students?\nResearch Question 4 (RQ4): What were the most influ-\nential theories for the students?\nResearch Question 5 (RQ5): What were the changes in\nthe students' thoughts about preschool education before\nand after the program?\nResearch Question 6 (RQ6): What were the hardest and\npleasurable sides of teaching young children?\nResearch Question 7 (RQ7): What are the qualities of\ntheir ideal preschool teacher?\nResearch Question 8 (RQ8): What are the students' per-\nceptions of a preschool teacher's qualities?\nResearch Question 9 (RQ9): What are the students'con-\ncerns about teaching in the future?\nParticipants\nOut of 45 senior students enrolled in the preschool education\nprogram at an Eastern Anatolian University, 35 students\nagreed to participate in the study.\nInstrument and Procedures\nIn this study, the authors used a qualitative approach to\ninvestigate preschool preservice teachers' perceptions about\nteaching and teacher in the context of Turkish culture. The\nauthors used a survey instrument, which was used in another\nstudy to investigate the perceptions of a culturally and lin-\nguistically different group of early childhood preservice\nteachers (Aldemir, 2007). The instrument was independently\ntranslated from English to Turkish by the authors of the\nstudy. The authors consulted each other on each item of the\ninstrument. Later, the Turkish version of the survey was sent\nto three different university professors at the preschool\nteacher education programs in Turkey to get more insights\nabout whether the instrument items were conveyed the\nintended meanings in Turkish Language. Upon feedback, the\nrevisions were made on the instrument. Both authors were\nTurkish and studied their master's and doctoral degrees in\nthe United States; therefore, they were capable of translating\ndocuments from English to Turkish and from Turkish to\nEnglish.\nUsing survey method as a qualitative means to collect\ndata works differently than using the same method in quanti-\ntative studies. Jansen (2010) defines qualitative survey\nmethod as follows:\nThe qualitative type of survey does not aim at establishing\nfrequencies, means or other parameters but at determining the\ndiversity of some topic of interest within a given population.\nThis type of survey does not count the number of people with\nthe same characteristic (value of variable) but it establishes the\nAldemir and Kurt 3\nmeaningful variation (relevant dimensions and values) within\nthat population. (p. 3)\nThe qualitative survey instrument utilized in this study\nwas prepared according to predetermined categories as\nJansen (2010) suggests. This approach is called \"deductive\"\nor \"predetermined\" survey method. Such instrument allows\nthe researcher to observe the selected population from a\nmore refined eye to study the values reflected by the popula-\ntion as they relate to those predetermined categories. In the\npresent study, the authors formed the questions in the instru-\nment in three sections: (a) demographic information (e.g.,\ngender, age, academic- and job-related experiences, pre-\nschool experience as a child, and reasons to choose preschool\neducation as a major), (b) program experience (e.g., courses\ntaken, theories learned, favorite courses and theories, and\nbefore and after thoughts in the program about preschool\neducation), and (c) perceptions (e.g., qualities of preschool\nand preschool teacher, and concerns about future teaching).\nSections 2 and 3 included open-ended questions.\nThe surveys were applied to the students in the academic\nat the appropriate class times. Some students preferred to\ncomplete the surveys at their convenient times and e-mailed\nthem back to the instructor. The instructor was the second\nauthor of the article and already had a well-developed rap-\nport with the students. The researchers were eager to conduct\nsuch a study to gain information about the students' feed-\nbacks on the experiences during their educational journey.\nThe participants were in their last year of preschool educa-\ntion undergrad program and they were equally eager to fill\nout the surveys and share their experiences. The students also\nstated that the results of this study were important and need\nbe taken into consideration by the professionals and lawmak-\ners in the preschool education field.\nData Analysis\nThe data collected from the open-ended questions of the sur-\nvey were analyzed by adopting a constant comparative cod-\ning method (Glaser & Strauss, 1999). Coding a set of\nqualitative data helps the researcher define the similar occur-\nrences throughout different cases and thereby make mean-\ningful interpretations (Charmaz, 2005). Through constant\ncomparative coding method, initially each piece of data was\nanalyzed and compared with the previous incidents that have\nalready been analyzed. This process helped the authors refine\nthe predetermined categories and their properties.As the data\nanalysis progressed, the authors compared each new piece of\ndata with the categories previously formed. The NVIVO 7\nqualitative data analysis software was utilized in categoriza-\ntion of the data. The software was useful in saving time that\ncould be lost with hand-coding.\nThe credibility of the survey instrument was assured\nthrough back translation method and feedbacks from the\nexperts in the field as mentioned in the research instrument\nsection. Furthermore, the integrity of data analysis was main-\ntained through the investigator triangulation. The researchers\ncross checked the credibility of their interpretations of the\nmeanings in the participants' responses to the survey. The\nsecond author was the gatekeeper for this research since she\nhad a well-developed rapport with her students and was\nfamiliar with the research site culture. Thus, she was able to\nprovide better insight about the meanings the students con-\nveyed through the survey instrument. In addition, the\n\"Findings\" section include rich, thick descriptions of the par-\nticipants' answers (Whittemore, Chase, & Mandle, 2001).\nFindings\nThe findings of the study are presented in three sections:\n\"Demographic Information,\" \"Program Experience,\" and\n\"Perceptions.\" Below, the relevant research questions are\npresented for each finding.\nDemographic Information\nRQ1: What are the demographic characteristics and previous\nexperiences of the students in the field of preschool educa-\ntion? Thirty-five senior preschool preservice teachers, 29\nfemales and 6 males, participated in the study. The ages of\nthe participants ranged from 21 to 25, except 3 students who\nwere in the 26-to-29-year age range. Of the 35 participants,\nonly 5 attended a kindergarten program before their enrol-\nment in first grade, and 2 participants received center-based\nchild care as a child. Although the majority of the partici-\npants were from the working-class households, they did not\nwork to support their education expenses at the time the\nstudy was conducted. Only 2 participants were full-time\nemployees in the state agencies. Two other participants were\nvolunteers at rehabilitation centers for children with special\nneeds. Eight participants mentioned practica/field experi-\nence courses as the only source of experience in which they\nhad gained insight into working with young children.\nRQ2:Why did the students choose preschool teaching as a pro-\nfession? The participants were asked to state why they chose\npreschool education as their future profession. Table 1 dis-\nplays the responses provided by the participants, explaining\nwhy they chose preschool teaching as a profession and rat-\nings for each reason.\nThe analysis showed that the first reason to choose pre-\nschool teaching as a career was love for children. This find-\ning echoed the findings from previous studies (G\u00fcrb\u00fczt\u00fcrk &\ners chose the teaching profession as a career path because of\nthe personal reasons such as that teaching is a respected pro-\nfession or love for children. The second reason to choose\npreschool teaching was the job guarantee. The graduates of\nteacher education programs in Turkey are mostly employed\n4 SAGE Open\nby the state public schools (Y\u00fcksel, 2012), which provide\nthem with job security, benefits, and a standard living level.\nThe third reason to choose preschool teaching was the par-\nticipants' scores in the Student Selection and Placement\nExamination. The higher education institutions in Turkey are\ncentralized under the CoHE. Acceptance to undergraduate\nprograms of the universities, either state or private, is cen-\ntralized by the Student Selection and Placement Centre\n(SSPC). Enrolment to an undergraduate program requires a\ncomposite score of the central exams and high-school grade\npoint average (CoHE, 2010). Because the scoring system\ndetermines the type of program a student would be enrolled\nin (World Bank, 2007), some participants in this study chose\nthe preschool teaching profession because their composite\nscore matched with the preschool education program\nentrance score.\nProgram Experience\nRQ3: What were the most beneficial courses for the stu-\ndents? The first section of the open-ended questions in the\nsurvey intended to explore the participants' program experi-\nence. One student did not respond to this question. Table 2\nshows the courses with their listing rates.\nRQ4: What were the most influential theories for the stu-\ndents? The students were asked to list the theories that they\nthought were the most influential in their teaching philoso-\nphy and to explain the effects of those theories in their teach-\ning philosophy. Two students did not respond to this question.\nMany of the participants listed more than one theory and\nexplained the effects of those theories in their teaching\nphilosophy.\nErik Erikson's psycho-social theory was listed in the\n30.30% of the responses. One of the participants stated that\nshe felt much closer to Erikson's theory about child develop-\nment \"because his theory explains how social environment\ncan impact children's development.\" Piaget's cognitive\nlearning theory was the second most popular theory with a\nrating of 27.27%. A student explained that,\nlearning comes from inside of a child and that it is an active\nexploration process. Therefore, instead of trying to load the\ninformation to the child, a teacher must prepare materials that\ninterest children and help them solve problems by themselves.\nA total of 18.18% of the students chose not to mention\nany specific theory but stated that they were eclectic in\napplying theories of child development in their teaching.\nOne student stated that she valued all the theories and she\nwould like to apply them according to children's different\nneeds. Howard Gardner's multiple intelligences theory\nreceived attention from the 15.15% of the participants. A\nparticipant stated, \"I feel closer to his ideas about learning.\nWhen I plan and implement activities, I consider individ-\nual variations and do not expect the same performance\nfrom all the students.\" As popular as Gardner's theory was\nCarl Roger's humanistic theory. One of the participant\nstated that each person had a potential for self-actualiza-\ntion when appropriate conditions were provided. Albert\nBandura's social learning theory captured the attention of\n12.12% in the responses. One of the students indicated, \"I\nthink a child learns from his family and close surrounding.\nTable 1.

A participant stated, \"I find\nVygotsky's development theory closer to my views.\nBecause children gain information by constructing it.\nDevelopment cannot be separated from the social context.\nLearning helps development. Language plays a fundamen-\ntal role in the development of mind.\" Finally, 9.09% of the\nparticipants mentioned that they found Freud's Stages of\nPsychosexual Development closer to their views. One of\nthe students wrote, \"I find Freud's Stages of Development\ntrue. Personality development occurs 0 to 6 years old\nperiod.\"\nPerceptions\nRQ5: What were the changes in the students' thoughts about\npreschool education before and after the program? The partici-\npants were asked to state the change in their thoughts about\npreschool education before their entrance to the program and\nafter their education in the program. All the participants stated\na change in their perceptions about preschool education\nbefore and after. The dichotomy between before and after\nthoughts was drastic in the participants' perceptions about\npreschool education. Seven change areas emerged from the\nstudents' responses. The themes were put in Table 3 with cor-\nresponding statement examples from the participants.\nTable 3. Changes in the Participants' Thoughts About Preschool Education.\nThemes Before After\nNecessity of preschool\neducation\n\"I used to think that preschool education\nwas not a big deal.\"\n\"Now I believe preschool education is a\nmust.\"\n \"I used to think preschool education was\nunnecessary.\"\n\"Now I know it is necessary for the child's\ndevelopment, creativity, unfolding hidden\ntalents, and school readiness.\"\n \"I did not know how much preschool\neducation benefits children. I also used\nto think preschool teaching as a very\ncomfortable and easy teaching job.\"\n\"Now I believe that preschool education is a\nmust and preschool teaching requires hard\nwork.\"\nBehavior management \"I used to think that strict disciplining and\npunishment were the most effective ways.\"\n\"Now I believe that alternative methods are\nmore effective.\"\n \"I did not know how wrong it is to say `no,\ndon't do that' to a child every time.\"\n\"Now I know education must start early\nor it could be too late.\" \"Now I became\nmore patient. I can get down to their level\nand communicate with them.\"\n \"I used to be very impatient toward\nchildren.\"\n\"Now I know that children do not learn\nbecause of lack of rules. They can become\ncooperative with a good behavior\nmanagement plan.\"\n \"I used to think that children cannot think\nlearn, are stubborn and naughty.\"\n\nCurriculum in preschool\neducation\n\"I used to think that children's songs did\nnot have any effect on children's language\ndevelopment.\"\n\"Now I believe that songs help improve\nlanguage skills in children.\"\n \"I used to think music, art, and play were\nactivities to entertain children.\" \"I used to\nthink learning though play ineffective.\"\n\"Now I know those activities (music, art,\nand play) are very important in children's\ndevelopment.\"\n \"Now I know how much learning through\nplay is effective.\"\nCharacteristics of development\nin early childhood period.\n\"I never thought that children are egocentric,\nanimistic, and use their senses.\"\n\"During my education, I learned a great deal\nabout children and feel as if I am more\nknowledgeable.\"\nChildren's level of\ncomprehension\n\"I used to think that children are not able to\nunderstand issues as adults do.\"\n\"Now I think when we explain issues to\nthem they can understand and can help\nus.\"\nTheories of child development \"I did not know the importance of theories.\" \"Now I know how important they are.\"\nField experience in preschool\nteacher education\n\"I used to think that theories were more\nhelpful in teaching.\"\n\"Now I know practicum experience is more\nimportant.\"\n6 SAGE Open\nMainly three themes surfaced as more important among\nnine: \"Necessity of preschool education, behavior manage-\nment, and curriculum in preschool education.\" The partici-\npants transformed their ideas about the necessity of preschool\neducation. Some of them used to believe that the education in\nthis period of life was not very important. After their educa-\ntion in the program, they became advocates of preschool\neducation for young children.\nAnother drastic change was in their perceptions about\nbehavior management. Prior to their program entrance, the\nparticipants did not have a good understanding about what\nmight cause children's misbehaviors. After their education\nin the program, they were able to better analyze young chil-\ndren's behaviors and propose ways to communicate with\nthem. Another change was observed in their perceptions\nabout preschool curriculum. Previously, they were not aware\nof the value of children's play, songs, and games on chil-\ndren's development. With their education, they were able to\nunderstand how play and musical/movement activities in\nearly ages could contribute to children's development.\nRQ6:What were the hardest and the most pleasurable sides of\nteaching young children?\nThe participants shared their\nthoughts about the hardest and the most pleasurable sides of\nteaching young children. Thirty-four students answered this\nquestion, and several listed more than one aspect for the\nanswer. The themes emerged from the participants'responses\nabout the hardest and most pleasurable sides of teaching are\ndisplayed in Table 4 with the students' response rates.\nMajority of the responses (38.64%) pointed out that main-\ntaining a certain level of physical energy and patience was the\nhardest part of teaching young children.Aparticipant stated, \"I\nam afraid that I will not be patient and loving when I get older\ndoing this job.\" Having adequate professional knowledge and\nskills to teach young children appeared as the second theme\n(22.73%). One of the students mentioned that the hardest side\nof preschool teaching is \"fear of giving wrong knowledge and\nnot being able to getting down at their level.\" Classroom man-\nagement followed with 18.18% of the responses. A student\nstated, \"The hardest part is not being able to control the class.\"\nInterestingly, under the program experience section, the\n\"classroom management\" course was among the least rated\ncourses by the students. A total of 13.64% of the responses\nrevolved around the perception that the hardest side of teach-\ning young children was the thought of their impact on chil-\ndren. A participant wrote, \"Children are very open to take in\nnegative things therefore we need to be very careful.\" Finally,\n6.82% of the responses mentioned working with families as\nthe hardest part of preschool teaching.\nThe responses about the most pleasurable parts of\nteaching young children revealed four themes (Table 4):\npositive impact on children, having fun with children,\nyoung children, and approaches to teaching. A total of\n32.65% of the participants stated that the most pleasurable\nside of teaching preschool children was to see the positive\nimpact of their teaching on young children. A participant\nstated, \"We will shape those children's personalities and\nwe will teach children all the right, good, and nice things.\"\nAlmost equally rated was having fun and playing with\nchildren (30.61%). One of the participants mentioned,\n\"You are always happy and it is possible that you may\nlaugh all day. Being on the go and having fun are very\nnice.\" Young children were mentioned as the most plea-\nsurable side in 20.41% of the responses. \"Most pleasur-\nable side is to see children's purity that they hug to show\ntheir love . . .\" a participant wrote. Finally, 16.33% of the\nresponses referred to the nature of teaching in preschool\nas the most pleasurable side.Astudent stated, \"Creativeness\nis at the highest level. It [preschool education] is not a\npassive education.\"\nWhen the themes for hardest side and most pleasurable\nsides of teaching young children were compared, the former\nfocused on more concrete issues related to professional\nknowledge and skills, guiding children's behavior, and main-\ntaining physical strength to keep up with young children's\nenergetic nature, whereas the latter seemed to idealize pre-\nschool as an environment that is always fun and that children\nare pure, innocent, and fun creatures. In fact, this thought\npattern is a recurring theme throughout teacher education\nstudies conducted in different cultures (Aldemir, 2007; Cook\nRQ7: What are the qualities of their ideal preschool educa-\ntion? The participants were asked to list the qualities of their\nideal preschool education. One participant did not respond to\nthis question, and two participants listed the qualities of their\nideal preschool teacher instead of preschool education; there-\nfore, 32 responses were coded for this question. All the\nresponses revolved around six areas, and some responses\nincluded more than one quality (Table 5).\nCurriculum theme received a rating of 33.33%. Being\nchild-centered, supporting creativity, and being play based,\nhands-on, and planned according to multiple intelligences\nand constructivism were the qualities of an ideal preschool\nTable 4. Hardest/Most Pleasurable Parts of Teaching Young\nChildren.\nHardest side of teaching\nyoung children\nRates\n(%)\nPleasurable side\nof teaching young\nchildren %\nLevel of physical energy\nand patience\nchildren\nBeing adequate in\nknowledge and skills\nto teach\nwith children\nFeeling weight of impact\non children\nteaching\nAldemir and Kurt 7\ncurriculum mentioned by the participants. Physical environ-\nment was the focus of 19.70% of the responses. Providing\nindependence to make choices, and having rich stimuli and\nadequate materials were the qualities of a preschool environ-\nment listed by the participants. Social-emotional atmosphere\nalso received 19.70% of the responses. According to the par-\nticipants, an ideal preschool education should provide a\nsocial-emotional atmosphere that is also democratic, social-\nizing, and trustful. Responsiveness theme emerged from\n18.18% of the participants'responses. Developmental appro-\npriateness and appealing to children's interests have been\nlisted by the participants to emphasize the responsiveness of\na preschool education. Only 6.06% of the participants men-\ntioned family involvement and focused on the quality that a\nprogram must collaborate with families and recognize family\nas a unit. The last theme teacher factor was mentioned by\nonly 3.03% of the participants. Having teachers who hold at\nleast a bachelor's degree in early childhood education (ECE)\nand encouragement for teachers to research were two quali-\nties related to teacher factor mentioned by the participants.\nRQ8: What are the students' perceptions of a preschool\nteacher? All the students responded to this question with\nmore than one quality area (Table 6).\nThe responses were categorized under three themes: per-\nsonal qualities, professional attitude, and professional\nknowledge and skills. Personal qualities (40.40%) appeared\nas the most important professional quality with professional\nattitude being the second (32.45%), and professional knowl-\nedge and skills is the third (27.15%). Among the personal\nqualities, being patient was the most frequently (36.07%)\nmentioned quality. Being loving, although it was the highest\nsecond quality, was mentioned in only 19.67% of the\nresponses. These two qualities by far surpassed the others\nlisted (e.g., tolerant, genial, cheerful, energetic, etc.) under\nthe theme of personal qualities.\nAs for the professional attitude theme, the participants\nmentioned love for children most frequently (26.53%) in\ntheir responses. Being creative was the second most fre-\nquently (16.33%) mentioned quality. The professional quali-\nties theme seemed to be more concrete in revealing specific\nknowledge and skill areas preschool teachers must possess.\nFor instance, knowledge about profession was mentioned in\nthe 24.95% of the responses while good communication\nskills/using Turkish language properly was perceived almost\nticipants thought updating professional knowledge on a reg-\nular basis should be part of professional knowledge and\nskills.\nRQ9:What are preservice teachers' concerns about teaching in\nthe future?The last question asked the participants to state\ntheir concerns about their future teaching. Two students did\nnot mention any concern. The rest of the responses focused\non eight concern areas (Table 7).\nOne of the areas the students were most concerned was\nworking with families (21.15%). A participant stated that his\nbiggest concern is \"having to work with families who think\nthey know everything but do not know anything.\" Concerns\nabout professional knowledge and skills were equally impor-\ntant in the 21.15% of total responses. The students seemed to\nlack the confidence about their knowledge, pedagogical\nskills, and planning and instructional skills. For example, a\nstudent mentioned that her concern was \"not being able to\nanswer their [children's] questions adequately.\" The third\nconcern category was classroom management (15.38%). A\nstudent stated, \"What I am most concerned is whether I will\nbe able to maintain classroom control.\" Some of the answers\n(13.46%) focused on concerns over maintaining a profes-\nsional attitude throughout the years that they will be in the\nprofession. A participant mentioned, \"I am concerned about\nwhether I will be able to have the same attitude toward my\nprofession and show the same performance when I get older.\"\nMaterials, resources, and funding were another concern area\nresponses were about working with children with special\nneeds. As 5.77% of responses were about concerns related to\nworking with administration and other staff members in the\nschool, problems in the education system in general was a\nconcern for 3.85% of the participants.\nDiscussion\nThe demographic data showed that the majority of the stu-\ndents came from working-class families with little to no pre-\nschool experience as a child. Although the Elementary\nEducation Regulations in Turkey (MoNE, 2012b) authorizes\neach elementary school to open kindergarten classrooms\ndepending on the need in their respected locations, kinder-\ngarten entry is still not compulsory in Turkey. Considering\nthe fact that this group of preservice teachers are the first\ngraduates of preschool teacher education programs after the\nrevision of teacher education curricula in Turkey in 2007, it\nis very critical for these teacher candidates to advocate the\npreschool education's positive impact on children's aca-\ndemic performance and social-emotional adaptation to for-\nmalschooling.Anotherfindingfromthestudents'background\ninformation showed that the love for children was the most\nimportant reason to choose preschool teaching as a career.\nTable 5. Qualities of Ideal Preschool Education.\nThemes Rates (%)\n8 SAGE Open\nThis finding was parallel to the participants' listing of love\nfor children as one of the most important qualities a pre-\nschool teacher must possess.\nTo understand their program experience, the participants\nwere asked to list the courses they favored the most.\nWhile art courses (e.g., drama, music, rhythm, and dance)\nwere among the most favored courses, the students paid little\nattention to practica/field experience courses, classroom\nmanagement, and parent education. Furthermore, the course\non children with special needs did not receive any recogni-\ntion from the students. Interestingly, when the students' con-\ncerns about their future teaching were examined, it was\nfound that the main concern areas were revolved around\nworking with families, professional knowledge and skills,\nand classroom management. Practica/field experience as part\nof teacher training is to help preservice teachers continue the\ntransformation they experience throughout their program\ncourses and gain crucial professional dispositions to work\nwith young children and their families, teach in preschool\nclassroom, and be an advocate for the profession. More col-\nlaboration with local education directories and schools could\nhelp communicate goals and expectations of practicum\ncourses and create volunteer opportunities for teacher candi-\ndates to apply their knowledge and skills that they gained\nduring their program experience.

The changes revolved around three themes: neces-\nsity of preschool education, behavior management, and pre-\nschool curriculum. Without any exception, all the participants\nmentioned a drastic change in their pre- and after-program\nperceptions. The authors implicate that in many cases, peo-\nple need an outside agency to make them aware of the\nchanges and transformations that took place in their attitudes\nand perceptions. Teacher educators may help preservice\nteachers discover the transformation in their perceptions\nthroughout their program experience. Morrison (2006) called\nthis process as \"reflective practice,\" which is a cycle of\nthinking before teaching, thinking while teaching, and think-\ning after teaching. As the teacher candidates observe this\npositive transformation in their perceptions, they can be\nmore self-confident and have high self-efficacy in facing the\nchallenges their professional teaching career may bring to\nthem.\nOne of the recurring issues throughout all the themes that\nemerged from the students' responses was the lack of recog-\nnition of families. As mentioned previously, working with\nfamilies was a subject, course area, and a professional qual-\nity that gained little recognition from the participants, yet it\nwas one of the highest rated concern areas about their future\nteaching. Graue and Brown (2003) mentioned preservice\nteachers' limited perceptions about families of children.\nMorris and Taylor (1998) explain that lack of course work to\nprepare preservice teachers effectively to work with parents\nwas one of the reasons for teachers' lack of knowledge and\nskills for parent involvement. In case of inadequate course\nwork and practica/field experience to work with families,\nteacher candidates may rely on their observations and per-\nceptions that they formed through their cultural upbringings\nand their 12 or more years of schooling experience to com-\nmunicate with families of young children. Preschool educa-\ntion is where parent involvement occurs at the highest level;\ntherefore, preservice teachers should be presented with\nopportunities to challenge their existing perceptions about\nfamilies of young children and study culturally appropriate\nways of involving them in the education of their children.\nOne of the points emerging from this study was the par-\nticipants' lack of confidence about classroom management.\nThis subject also appeared as one of the hardest sides of pre-\nschool teaching in the participants' responses. Classroom\nmanagement has also been cited as an important concern for\nother Turkish preservice teachers by \u00c7akmak (2008). The\nauthors of this study propose that preservice teachers should\nbe able to realize that the effective classroom management\nskills are part of designing a developmentally appropriate\npreschool curriculum. Therefore, each curriculum and\nmethod course and practicum/field experience course needs\nto emphasize integrating classroom management strategies\nin unit and curriculum plans. Further support should be pro-\nvided by mentor teachers and student teaching faculty by\nproviding immediate feedback to preservice teachers upon\ntheir curriculum implementation. A healthy mentor teacher\nand preservice teacher relationship has been defined as cru-\ncial for the practicum/field courses (Loizou, 2011).\nThe participants listed some qualities that they think a\npreschool teacher must possess. As three themes (i.e., per-\nsonal qualities, professional attitude, and professional\nknowledge and skills) emerged from this area, the partici-\npants listed more qualities for the areas of personal qualities\nand professional attitude than they did for professional\nknowledge and skills. Unfortunately, knowledge and skills\nsuch as knowledge of child development, planning activities\nfor different intelligences, capturing children's attention, use\nof technology, knowledge about children's interests, being a\ngood observer, and communicating with families were men-\ntioned only once by different participants. Love for children\nappeared as the most important personal and professional\nquality, which received a higher rating than all the qualities\nfor professional knowledge and skills, in the students'\nresponse. Certainly, one cannot deny the fact that love for\nchildren must be one of the prerequisites to teach and care for\nyoung children. However, as Morrison (2006) indicated, an\nearly childhood professional needs to have competence in\n\"personal characteristics, educational attainment, profes-\nsional practice, and public presentation\" (p. 5). A teacher's\npersonal qualities and professional dispositions cannot be\nseparated from the teacher's professional identity as one\nmust acknowledge that professional knowledge and skills\nare also part of this identity. To maintain the balance across\nthose three areas, teacher candidates should examine differ-\nent dimensions of the teaching profession and what makes a\nteacher highly qualified to teach young children. Teacher\neducation programs can help preservice teachers examine\neffective teaching practices via case studies, real classroom\nexperiences, and vignettes, and, most importantly, analyze\ntheir own teaching implementations. Such reflective practice\n(Morrison, 2006) will help teacher candidates comprehend\nthe different dimensions of preschool teaching and give\nequal importance to each area in this profession.\nPerceptions about working with children with special\nneeds hardly gained attention from the participants.Although\nthere is state support, incentives, and subsidies provided to\nchildren with special needs and their families, many schools,\nclassrooms, and teachers are unprepared to accommodate the\nvarying needs of children with exceptional needs\n(Er-Sabuncuolu & Diken, 2010). Perhaps this is a good\nopportunity to address and reemphasize the importance of\ntraining future preschool teachers adequately to work with\nchildren with special needs and their families. Preschool\neducation is the period where problems in development and\nlearning are detected, and the preschool teachers are the ones\nwho need the ability to observe and detect potential risks and\ndelays in children (Er-Sabuncuolu & Diken, 2010).\nTherefore, teacher education programs in Turkey have a\ngreat responsibility to help teacher candidates gain skills and\nknowledge to accommodate the needs of all children. In fact,\nrecently there has been more emphasis on special education\nand inclusion applications in the preschool classrooms for\nyoung children with special needs in the last revision of the\npreschool teacher education program in 2012 (MoNE,\nIn sum, the purpose of this study was to examine pre-\nschool preservice teachers' perceptions about teacher and\nteaching in the Turkish teacher education context. The data\ncollected through a survey instrument were coded into cate-\ngories to explore the patterns in a group of Turkish preschool\npreservice teachers'perceptions. The results of the study pro-\nvided important insights on Turkish preschool preservice\nteachers' perceptions about teacher and teaching. Yet, the\nstudy had its limitations. Perhaps one and the most important\nlimitation of the study was the subject size. It would have\nbeen more robust to conduct the survey with the graduates of\nthe program few years back. However, currently, there is no\norganized system in this program to keep in touch with the\nprogram alumni; therefore, the possibility of reaching out to\nthe recent graduates did not exist. The researchers are aware\nthat the findings of this qualitative study can only be general-\nized in the context wherein the study was conducted.\nNevertheless, the study can have important implications for\npreschool teacher education in Turkey and in other countries\nas well, and help the international readers perceive preschool\neducation from a different cultural perspective. This study\nand other studies on preservice teachers' perceptions within\nspecific cultural contexts could present valuable information\nand insights for academicians, teachers, administrators, and\nlawmakers in the field of preschool education around the\nworld.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAldemir, J.
