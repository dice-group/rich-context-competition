In\naddition, most work on the gendering of AIDS has focused on women's experiences\nrather than men's, perhaps an extension of the common bias in social science research\nthat women are gendered, but men are simply men.\nIn this paper, I intend to address both those gaps through studying the claims made\nby young Malawian men about their own serostatus, especially claims to be HIV-\npositive; and by locating these claims within the context of evolving ideas about\nmasculinity in rural Malawi (Note 1). This effort is worthwhile not only because it\nmakes the social construction of gender more visible, but also because it adds to extant\nknowledge about why men continue to take risks in their sexual behaviour, nearly two\ndecades after the arrival of HIV.\nI make three claims in this paper: first, that an unknown proportion of sexually\nactive young men say that they are already HIV-positive, in the absence of any medical\nevaluation or any signs of AIDS; second, that men's claims to be HIV-positive emerge\nfrom a particular configuration of masculinity as well as from personal conviction; and\nthird, that this claim is used to justify continuing risky sexual behaviour, such as having\nmultiple partners or not using condoms, on the grounds that this behaviour is no longer\ndangerous if one has already contracted the virus.\nAt the outset, I want to be clear about what I am not arguing in this paper. I do not\nargue that Malawian men want to get AIDS. Similarly, I do not argue that the men in\nthis paper \"really\" think that they are HIV-positive (indeed, I claim at the end of this\npaper that the notion of a fixed, internally consistent belief about one's own serostatus\nis a chimera). I cannot know what these men believe in their hearts; I can only know\nwhat they say, and it is the fact of that saying \u00ad that act of claims-making \u00ad that is the\nfocus of this paper. Why do men make these claims, which on the surface seem bizarre?\nAnd what does the fact of this claims-making say about evolving ideas about both HIV\nand about masculinity itself?\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 11\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 351\nMen's belief that they are HIV-positive is linked to a particular conception of how\nAIDS works \u00ad specifically, the idea that HIV infection is deterministic, so that exposure\nto the virus is virtually a 100% guarantee that one will eventually come down with\nAIDS. This model of AIDS is reinforced by AIDS education and health promotion\nactivities which stress the deadliness of AIDS and the fact that one can become HIV-\npositive after only one or very few exposures, such as encounters with commercial sex\nworkers or with women with multiple partners. While this message is intended to scare\npeople off risky behaviour by emphasizing their vulnerability, I believe it has also had\nthe unintended consequence of strengthening the belief that if one has had some risky\nencounters in the past (as almost all young men have), then one is virtually certain to\nhave contracted HIV and thus need not take any future protective measures. In this\npaper, I explore what men say about their beliefs about their serostatus, and how they\nlink these beliefs to their actions.\n2. Methods and setting\nI arrive at these ends using methods which are unusual for demographers. Demographic\nresearch in general, and research on AIDS in particular, relies heavily on survey and\nquestionnaire methods. While these methods have the virtues of producing quantifiable\nand comparable data, many aspects of social life cannot be captured within the pre-set\ncategories which define the range of knowledge in survey instruments. Because some of\nthe ideas and concepts which are crucial to behaviour change can't be captured in\nstandard ways, when the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project (MDICP)\nsought to gauge whether Malawians were likely to change their individual behaviour in\nresponse to the threat of AIDS, we also used observational journals, kept by young men\nand women who worked for MDICP, in which they wrote down every conversation,\ncasual chat, or passing reference about AIDS which they could recall in the course of\ntheir daily lives. While both men and women talked extensively about AIDS-related\nmatters in their casual conversation, only men talked about their own sexual behaviours\nand their implications for HIV. Women's mentions of AIDS took the form of worrying\nabout their own or their relatives' vulnerability, deploring the impact of AIDS on\ncommunity and family, and discussing the prospects of acquaintances and family\nmembers who were thought to have AIDS. Sexual agency, especially sexual agency\noutside of marriage, rarely surfaced in the journals kept by women (although it did\nsurface in interviews with women by MDIC researchers, see Tawfik 2003, Tawfik and\nWatkins 2003). Thus, for this paper, our analysis is confined to men (Note 2).\nThis study was conducted in Balaka district in rural southern Malawi, in the area\ntriangulated by the towns of Liwonde and Balaka and the trading center Ulongwe. This\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 11\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n352 http://www.demographic-research.org\nsite is referred to as \"southern\" in MDICP terminology. This is a fairly typical\nMalawian rural area \u00ad extended families live in loosely-connected groups of\nhomesteads, formed into villages, relying mainly on subsistence farming and some\nselling of tobacco and cotton. The area borders one of the main roads in the country,\nwhich feeds into the nearby cities of Zomba and Blantyre, two hours away by public\ntransit. Many of the younger adults travel to and from the city looking for work or\nexcitement. To the northeast is the port of Mangochi on Lake Malawi, a major centre\nfor small-scale fishing and fish-trading, with a reputation as the local red-light district.\nThis research was carried out as part of the much larger Malawi Diffusion and\nIdeational Change Project, headed by co-investigators Susan Cotts Watkins, Hans-Peter\nKohler and Jere Behrman of the University of Pennsylvania and Eliya Zulu of the\nAfrican Population Research Centre. The main work of the MDICP has been carrying\nout large-scale surveys and smaller-scale qualitative inquiries into changing attitudes to\nfamily planning and HIV-related behaviour in three sites corresponding to Malawi's\nThe national AIDS prevalence in Malawi is estimated at 16%, but the prevalence\nin southern province, where this study was done, is thought to be around 19%. AIDS is\nnow the leading cause of death for people aged 15 to 49 (Doctor 2002). Compared to\nother African countries with high prevalence rates such as Uganda or Zambia, the\nMalawian government's response to the pandemic has been low-key. In everyday life,\nmost people encounter \"official\" AIDS education or prevention efforts in the form of\nspots on the radio, posters in local health clinics, Chishango (\"shield\") condoms for sale\nor distribution from tuckshops and some bars, and in some primary schools, the creation\nof \"Edzi Toto\" (\"Stop AIDS\") clubs, meant to disseminate AIDS information to youth.\nThe content of these radio spots, posters and clubs is similar to that in AIDS-prevention\nprogrammes all over southern Africa, stressing the devastation AIDS wreaks on\nfamilies and communities and the dangers of risky behaviour, especially sex with\npeople known to be \"promiscuous\". Malawians are ambivalent about these AIDS-\nprevention efforts: some see them as indecent because of the explicit information about\nsex and condoms which they contain, and others see them as yet another set of\nIn addition to this official \"AIDS awareness\", people attend funerals of relatives or\nacquaintances on average three times per month (Watkins, personal communication). If\nthe deceased was part of the \"AIDS group\" \u00ad young, reasonably well-off, sexually\nactive \u00ad speculation about the cause of death runs high. AIDS is the stuff of rumours\nand gossip: who is sure to have AIDS, who is likely to have it, who has divorced their\nhusband or wife because of suspected AIDS, who is putting their spouse at risk of\nAIDS through their behaviour, and so on. While some people, mainly the elderly, claim\nthat AIDS is being over-diagnosed and that all sorts of innocuous illnesses are now\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 11\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 353\nbeing attributed to AIDS, for most people, AIDS is omnipresent. It may seem, indeed,\nthat AIDS is the inevitable fate of anyone who has sex with more than one partner in\nBalaka district in the 21st century.\nEpidemiological research, however, suggests that AIDS is not the inevitable result\nof sex. The Rakai Project in rural Uganda, a very similar setting to rural Malawi, found\na transmission rate per act with an infected partner to be 0.11%, or one transmission for\nacts with infected partners in rural Africa do not result in AIDS transmission. Thus,\nalthough AIDS and its consequences are evident everywhere, the majority of\nMalawians are not HIV-positive, even those who may have had infected partners. In\nrural Malawi, however, virtually no one knows his or her actual serostatus.\nIn order to collect comments about HIV/AIDS, the MDICP asked five skilled\nresearch assistants to keep informal journals \u00ad notebook in which they would record\n\"everything that you hear people say about AIDS\". The data included conversations in\nwhich the research assistants participated as well as conversations they overheard, in\nboth public settings such as a bus station or a bar, and private settings such as a home.\nThe journalists were asked to record as accurately and in as much detail as possible.\nDepending on the journalists, the degree of detail varied from verbatim scripts of\noverheard conversation, complete with elaborate descriptions of the setting, to summary\nparagraphs. Journalists did not tell their conversation partners that they were taking\nmental notes for journal entries, and were asked not to instigate any conversations about\nAIDS by themselves (Note 4). The journals therefore consist of \"natural discourse\",\ndrawn from spontaneous settings (Note 5, Farmer 1994).\nJournalists used standard school exercise books for their journals, and when each\nexercise book was full, it was sent either to a friend of one of the researchers who lived\nin Blantyre or directly to the MDICP in Philadelphia. In Philadelphia the journals were\ntranscribed into Word files, and these were coded and analyzed with Ethnograph\nstill being kept by the journalists and sent to Philadelphia.\nThis methodology has its advantages and its drawbacks. Chief among the\nadvantages is that the journals present ideas, concepts and beliefs in the very process of\ncirculation, away from the artificial structures of the interview situation (Note 6). Data\nfrom the journals is therefore free from \"interview effects\", including the very common\ntendency for interview respondents to give a \"correct\" answer rather than a true one. In\naddition, because there are no pre-set categories for responses, the journal method\nopens up new areas of knowledge and new lines of inquiry, as opposed to confirming or\ndisconfirming the theories of researchers. Finally, through the journals we hear the\nvoices of those who are not often represented in surveys and standard interviews \u00ad the\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 11\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n354 http://www.demographic-research.org\nextremely old, the extremely young, the disaffected and the transient. Our five\njournalists are all very different people, with very different social (and geographic)\nlocations and personal networks; thus when certain themes came up over and over in\nthe journals, I could be fairly confident that these themes represent fairly widely voiced\nideas; or at least ideas which were widely voiced within Balaka at that point (Note 7).\nThe journal method also has its disadvantages. Unlike survey data, journal data is\ndifficulty to quantify and thus difficult to use in temporal or spatial comparisons. In\naddition, I am not so na\u00efve as to assume that the journalists wrote down absolutely\neverything they heard which was in any way related to AIDS, without filtering or subtly\n(and perhaps unconsciously) altering the content of their observations. The extent and\neffects of this filtering are unknown. Judging by the content of the journals, however,\nthe journalists did not shy away from including material which showed them and their\npersonal networks in a less than flattering light \u00ad for example, one journalist wrote\nabout his wife accusing him of extramarital affairs, while another wrote about her\ncousin's callous treatment of a brother who was sick with AIDS. Second, it is difficult\nto estimate the prevalence of AIDS talk among men relative to other pressing topics.\nGiven that the journals contain information on AIDS and family planning religion\nexclusively, it is difficult to know whether this is a major preoccupation of Malawian\nmen, a minor one or somewhere in between. Given the swath that AIDS is cutting\nthrough Malawian communities, however, it is reasonable to think that that AIDS is\nfrequently on men's minds and in their conversations.\nAlso, while our sample of conversations about AIDS is very diverse, I do not know\nwhether it is truly representative of the population. Whether or not our sample is\nrepresentative, however, it is very heterogeneous, and that heterogeneity itself makes it\nvaluable for generating knowledge about what people think of AIDS.\nFinally I have no guarantee that what the journalists wrote down actually occurred,\nin other words that they didn't just make up their journals. The five journalists have\nbeen working for the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change project since 1998 as\nsurveyors, and were chosen because they had proven to be the most reliable,\nenthusiastic and insightful of the MDICP surveyors. I was therefore willing to take their\nwork on trust. In addition, on a purely subjective level, the journals have a quality of\nverisimilitude which is difficult, if not impossible, to fake. Although certain themes\ncame up again and again, clich\u00e9d situations and characters rarely did. Given the\ndiversity and range of the journals, it would probably have been more work to invent all\nthe situations and conversations than to simply record them.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 11\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 355\nName Sex Age\nMarital\nstatus\nOccupation\nEconomic\nstatus\nOther\n'Alice' F Early 30s Divorced,\nFarmer Low-\nmiddle\nMainstay of extended\nfamily, sole support of 10\n'Sophie' F Mid-20s Married\nduring\ncourse of\nproject\nHousewife High From local landowning\nfamily, married soldier and\nmoved to army base in\ntown\n'Simon' M Early 20s Married,\n2 children\nPeasant\nfarmer/fish\ntrader\nLow-\nmiddle\nAlthough married,\nsocializes extensively with\nyoung single men\n'Derek' M Mid-30s Married Village\nhealth\nassistant\nHigh-\nmiddle\nRuns educational\nprograms in villages\npromoting preventive\nhealth\n'Diston' M Mid-20s Single Peasant\nfarmer/day\nlabourer in\ntown\nLow-\nmiddle\nDivides time between town\nand village, travels to\nZimbabwe for work\n'Michael' M Early 20s Single Student in\nlarge town\nHigh-\nmiddle\nDresses well, socializes\nwith local elite\n3. Local knowledge about AIDS\nIn an earlier paper, I catalogued the reasons that men gave for not changing their sexual\nbehaviour despite their knowledge that AIDS was fatal and was common in their\ncommunities (Kaler 2002). These reasons include the belief that one's fate is ultimately\nin God's or Allah's hands and the belief that it is psychologically impossible or\ndamaging to not have sex or to forego having sex \"plain\", without a condom, but the\nmost complex reason for foregoing behaviour change was the claim that due to past\nmisbehaviour, one is now already infected.\nMalawians arrived at this claim through a combination of accurate and inaccurate\nknowledge about AIDS. These men's sexual behaviour, like most people's sexual\nbehaviour, is not entirely consistent with their knowledge about sex and its\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 11\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n356 http://www.demographic-research.org\nconsequences. Among men married to women aged 15 to 49 (the group from which the\nMDICP drew its survey sample), 35% of sexually active men reported \"higher risk sex\"\n(defined as sex with a casual partner) during the last year, but of these men only 39%\nreported using a condom (and given the desirability bias of underreporting high-risk\nsexual activity and overreporting condom use, there are likely to be more men having\nhigher risk sex and fewer using condoms than is reported). This pattern of reported\nbehaviour is at odds with their knowledge about HIV/AIDS. In the 2000 Malawi\nDemographic and Health Survey, 100% of men aged 15-49 had heard of AIDS, and\n62% were reported to have \"no incorrect beliefs\" about AIDS, based on a composite of\ncommon untruths about AIDS. 85% knew that AIDS cannot be transmitted casually,\nthrough sharing food, and 72% and 77% volunteered that using a condom and\nabstaining from sex (respectively) could protect one from AIDS. This knowledge has\nbeen gained relatively recently, as in the 1992 DHS only 26% of men volunteered\ncondoms as a way to prevent AIDS and only 32% volunteered abstaining from sex\nAlthough Malawians have clearly learned a lot about AIDS, some local beliefs\nabout the virulence of AIDS do not track with current biomedical knowledge. Two\nassumptions are often made about the ubiquity and transmissibility of HIV: first, that it\nis everywhere and will eventually kill everyone; and second, that AIDS is extremely\ninfective and that if one has been exposed to the virus, one's days are numbered.\nConcerning the first assumption, the journals are filled with comments, often with\na religious or eschatological gloss, that AIDS signals the end of the world, or at least\nthe destruction of everyone in Malawi. School boys, for example, complained to their\nteacher that they saw no point in working hard at schoolwork because \"no one will\nremain alive in the coming five years\" (Alice, journal June 4 2001). On a bus journey,\nthe same journalist's seatmate informed her that \"I know that we shall all die of AIDS\nand there is nobody who will not taste AIDS\". Another passenger chimed in: \"It seems\nthat God wants to destroy the whole world through that disease. We shall all die with\nAIDS\" (ibid.). At funerals of older relatives, mourners often expressed the sentiment\nthat no one currently alive would survive to attain the age at which their relatives died \u00ad\neveryone would now die young because of AIDS. One phrase, used so often that it\nseemed to be a clich\u00e9, was the assertion that \"AIDS has come for human beings\n[interpreted as the human race], not for animals\" \u00ad in other words, AIDS is targeted to\ndestroy everyone.\nIn addition to painting AIDS as a holocaust which would kill everyone, many local\npeople believed that HIV was highly infective, and that only one exposure was enough\nto guarantee that one would become HIV-positive. For instance, people in the journals\ngossiped about acquaintances who had spouses suspected of having AIDS and what\nwould happen to the marriage if the other spouse found out. Reactions to this dilemma\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 11\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 357\nwere mixed, with some people claiming that there was still time for the partner who\nshowed no signs of AIDS to protect his or her life, either by using condoms or by\ndivorcing and abandoning the infected partner. Others, however, said that nothing could\nbe done \u00ad if one's partner had HIV, it was certain that the HIV had been transmitted.\nInterestingly, although reports from formal interviews indicated that respondents were\ndivided as to whether the partner of an HIV-positive person would inevitably have\nAIDS themselves, when this subject came up in the informal conversations recorded by\nthe journalists, opinion was firmly that AIDS was inevitable. For example, in the course\nof a casual family visit, Simon asked his in-law what he thought most couples did when\none of them was suspected of being HIV-positive:\nAnd then I asked my in-law, `What do people do after noticing that his/her\npartner seems to have AIDS? He said, `Some couples come to an end and for\nothers the marriage continues.' And I asked, `Do they use condoms then?' He\nsaid `I don't think they use because it will just be a waste of time since both of\nthem have contracted the disease.' (Simon, journal May 3 2002)\nAnother friend of Simon's, who claimed to be sure he had AIDS as a result of his\nsexual adventures on trading trips to South Africa, was even more explicit, saying that\nHIV was transmitted in the first moment of sexual contact:\n\"AIDS is quite different from other diseases like bilharzia, where it happens that\none partner may have it and another may not. But AIDS is not like that, if a\npartner has it definitely you also have it, and you'll just be waiting to die.\"\nEvidence of belief in the transmissibility of HIV also comes from the chief's court.\nThe infectivity of HIV has recently becomes an issue in petitions for divorce, as\nsuspicion of AIDS has come to figure more and more as a cause for ending a marriage.\nFor instance, in one particular case, in which a man wanted to divorce his wife for her\nalleged infidelity with a man suspected of having AIDS, the bystanders who had\ngathered to observe the drama muttered among themselves that the divorce was surely\ntoo late to save the husband. They claimed that the divorcing man \"was stupid to\ndivorce his wife at that time because if he feared AIDS, the he already has it, so there\nwas no point of divorcing the wife while you're already infected\" (Michael, journal\nThe infectivity of HIV was also used by a widow to defend her husband's\nreputation against the rumour that he had died of AIDS \u00ad if he had been HIV-positive,\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 11\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n358 http://www.demographic-research.org\nshe argued, surely she too would be sick by now. Since she had no signs of AIDS, then\nher husband must not have had the disease either (Michael, journal October 21 2001).\nIn a context in which AIDS is believed to be both totalizing in its effect and highly\ninfective, it is hardly surprising that men who have had one or more \"risky\" encounters\nmay live with the assumption, voiced or not, that they have HIV already and are going\nto get AIDS. For a young man whose behaviour has at some point matched the\nbehaviour depicted in anti-AIDS posters, it is much easier to imagine oneself HIV-\npositive than HIV-negative.\nIn addition to beliefs about the perniciousness and infectivity of AIDS, Malawians\nare also presented with a model of AIDS risk which stresses sex with casual partners as\nthe way to get AIDS. The biomedical model, simplified for public education, coexists\nwith older models of disease in rural Africa involving sin or the violation of taboo, but\nthe discourse captured in the journals clearly suggests that the biomedical model linking\nAIDS with unsafe sex is dominant among young men. This model makes its way to\nrural Malawi in the form of educational materials: talks and presentations by health\nworkers and radio spots, as well as posters.\nThese talks, presentations, radio spots and posters stress the indissolubility of the\nlink between sex and AIDS, so that unsafe sex becomes an arrow pointing straight at\nAIDS infection, with no possibility of escaping unscathed. Men are depicted consorting\nwith girlfriends as death lurks in the background, or as images of their future selves as\nwalking skeletons drift in front of them. The progression from casual sex to eventual\ndeath from AIDS is portrayed as inevitable \u00ad in the world of AIDS education, every\nyoung man who hires a sex worker eventually dies; every bout of casual sex ends with\nanother AIDS case added to the total. The fact that the vast majority of sexual contacts\nwith HIV-positive people do not end in death is never mentioned, and indeed it is\ndifficult to see how this biological reality could be worked into the materials without\nundermining the message of caution. However, by presenting the idea of HIV\ntransmission as the inevitable accompaniment to sex, these materials may reinforce the\nsense that every man who has had risky encounters has contracted HIV. For the young\nmen in southern Malawi, who do not have access to blood tests, measuring one's own\nbehaviour against that which is known to be \"bad\" is the only way of trying to figure\nout whether one might be HIV-positive.\"\n4. Autobiographical diagnosis\nYoung men clearly know that they have been \"bad\", in terms of risky behaviour,\nleading to their claims to be HIV-positive. Conversely, the claim to be HIV-positive\nmeans that one must have been \"bad\". However, those behaviours which are \"bad\"\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 11\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 359\nfrom a public health standpoint have an ambiguous symbolic loading for these young\nmen. Outside the realm of health promotion, having multiple partners and having sex\nwithout condoms can also function as proof that one is a real man, virile and masculine.\nClaims to these behaviours are made in front of audiences which also serve as arbiters\nof individuals' social worth and self-esteem, consisting usually of small groups of other\nyoung men in \"men's spaces\", such as bars, beerhalls, or just hanging around public\nmarkets.\nThe journals are filled with accounts of men who say they are certain that they\nhave HIV, based on their past behaviour which they now know to have been risky (Note\n8). The behaviours associated with AIDS - long-distance travel, multiple sexual\npartners and commodified sex - are part of many, if not most, young men's lives, and\nbased on these experience they perform an autobiographical diagnosis: I have lived in a\nrisky way, thus I must have contracted HIV (Note 9). A few examples below:\nDiston: What about Gift, what can you do in such a situation when you feel\nthreatened to [worried about] contracting HIV/AIDS from your\nsexual partner?\nGift: As of me, I do think that I am already infected because I have slept\nwith several women and there is nothing that I can do other than\njust proceeding with the affairs because I have already lost hope\nabout my HIV status [because of] the women I have been sleeping\nwith.\nDiston: What kind of women were you sleeping with so that you lose\nhope?\nGift: The first point that makes me to lose hope is that I have been\ncatching STIs and the second thing is that I had a sexual partner\nwho was a bargirl at Lunzu, all these make me lose hope about my\nHIV status. (Diston, second journal received, June 2002).\nFriend: I don't fear AIDS because I know that I have it already.\nDiston: How do you know that you have got AIDS?\nFriend: I have malaria and some coughs so I know that I have it.\nDiston: Do you use condoms when [sleeping with] these bargirls?\nFriend: What for, since I know that I am already infected?\nDiston: How did you get the disease then?\nFriend: I got it from the same bargirls.\nDiston: Why don't you just stop [sleeping with] them?\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 11\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n360 http://www.demographic-research.org\nFriend: I can't stop, since I am already infected, and I just go for them\nwithout any fears about [getting] AIDS. (Diston, journal April 13\nThe dominant theme that emerges in these assertions of being HIV-positive is\ntravel and mobility. Men who thought they had contracted HIV usually referenced their\nactivities away from home rather than their sexual involvements with local women,\neven local women who were thought to have HIV. Malawi has for generations been a\nlabour reserve, from which young men go out to work or trade in surrounding countries,\nand many of the young men in the journals had worked or traveled in Zimbabwe,\nBotswana or South Africa, all countries with higher HIV rates than Malawi.\nIn Malawian cultural history, labour migration has for generations been associated\nwith masculinity and with the passage to manhood, as young men seek their fortune in\nthe outside world and, ideally, return with their spoils to the envy of their rural relatives\n(Chirwa 1992). \"Theba\" (the local name for labour migration) was associated with\nparticularly masculine forms of power \u00ad being able to get a wife and get married,\nopening a bar or a small business, and the power to excite envy in those who stayed\nbehind through one's knowledge of styles in clothing, language and music in the\noutside world. For men, Chirwa asserts, theba was \"the high road to capital\naccumulation\" (432) (Note 10). The persistent association between manliness, mobility,\nsexual adventures and HIV has come to make epidemiological as well as cultural sense,\nas the transport routes in southern Africa are the arteries along which HIV appears to\nspread. Young men often chatted about travel in conversational groups.\nOsman said that he has no doubts he has HIV. He said himself that after coming\n[back] from Johannesburg he had a TV and after selling [it] he had almost\nafter him, those beautiful ones. (Simon, journal July 23 2000).\nAndrew jokingly said that any woman who flirts with him is only digging her\nown grave, because as he has traveled widely, he is sure of having HIV, since he\nhas been sleeping with different women in all the places he has traveled. To me,\nthe issue carried weight when he told me that he has been to Zimbabwe,\nMozambique and Zambia when he was a truck-driver, because I know that in a\ncountry like Zambia and Zimbabwe, it's risky, since most women depend on sex\n\"I should tell you the truth, I have slept with many partners and indeed I have to\nconfess, that if it is the case of AIDS I believe I have it even if I did not go for a\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 11\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 361\nblood test, I just assume that because the time I was going to South Africa I had\ngreat luck sleeping with some of the pretty young girls. I had been dreaming\nabout them even when I was in South Africa and some are married women,\nparticularly those married to the so- called bosses of shops, and I had been given\nmoney by them sometimes.' We laughed. And he continued saying `You said\nthe truth that everyone has what pleases him, for example I don't like beer but I\nlike going for ladies.' (Simon, journal June 5 2002).\nIn additional to having the ring of epidemiological truth, mobility and travel are\nsignificant symbols in talking about HIV risk. Sleeping with many partners is referred\nto as \"moving around\", and a promiscuous person is referred to by the neologism\n\"movious\". Someone, usually a woman, who remains faithful to one partner or who is\ncelibate when that partner is away is said to be \"just staying\". It is also worth noting\nthat the metaphors which two of the young men quoted below use to describe their\nnumbers of partners also involve travel and transport \u00ad the women they have slept with\nare enough to fill a bus (or two), rather than enough to fill a football field, a school or\nanother large space.\n5. HIV-positive status and masculinity\nAmong the young men in the journals, claims to HIV-positive status are not necessarily\nexpressed as despair or grief. Married men, in one-on-one conversations with intimates,\nmay express intense regret over their own behaviour with its implications of\norphanhood for their children. For instance, one man who had had an encounter with a\nprostitute when going to buy fish in Mangochi confided to Sophie:\nI have many children and some of them are little. So if I and my wife die with\nAIDS, who will take care of our many children? Oh, that's why I have become\nafraid of sleeping with a prostitute, and I confess that it was my first and last\ntime, I will never do that again. And I don't want my wife to know that one time\nI did such a thing. So that's why I have told you to please not tell my wife about\nHowever, in the more public settings of the market or the beerhall, talk about\nAIDS risk is not nearly so somber. Being HIV-positive can imply a sort of masculine\nprowess in being a lady-killer (quite literally). In many of the accounts of believing\noneself to be HIV-positive, a note of boasting about the sheer number of one's sexual\npartners often creeps in:\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 11\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n362 http://www.demographic-research.org\n[Concerning HIV] then it means I have it because in my life I have slept with\nmany girls that whenever I try to take them in total [count them all up] and make\nthem board the bus such as the Zasintha bus, which is the big one, [the\ngirlfriends] can occupy it fully and a half of [a second bus] as well.(Simon,\nI have never even tried to use [condoms]. I have slept with many girls and if it is\nthe cause of AIDS then I have already got it because the girls with which I had\nbeen having sex, gathering them all could fill a Yanu-Yanu bus. Were they all\nsafe? Then why be using condoms when I prefer not using? (Simon, journal\nSerostatus, in the form of boasts about being HIV-positive, may actually be\nbecoming a marker of virility among these men (Note 11). While wasting away or\ndying from AIDS-related illnesses is unlikely to ever become a status symbol for men,\nthe status of the behaviour that led to AIDS is more ambiguous, given the link between\nsexual conquest and masculinity (Note 12). The fact that these young men are claiming\nto be HIV-positive indicates a significant fissure in the way HIV is conceptualized in\nMalawi: for some, it is a marker of shame and sin, for others, however, it may signify\nsomething different.\nThe behaviours associated with HIV \u00ad having many sexual partners and not using\ncondoms \u00ad are also associated with masculinity. Safer sex behaviours, in contrast, are\nnot. Men in the journals tell stories about condoms to approving audiences, describing\nhow they tricked their sexual partners into thinking that the men were wearing condoms\nwhen they weren't, or how they lied about using condoms with \"hit and run\" (casual)\npartners in order to placate long-term wives or girlfriends. Skin-to-skin ejaculation is\nthe marker of a real man - one who uses condoms is being cheated out of his right to a\nhigh-grade sexual experience, or may even be the subject of gossip or ridicule. One of\nSimon's friends claimed that he would never use condoms with his casual partners\nbecause to do so would cast aspersions on his manliness:\n[It is] better that I ejaculate inside them, so that the girl should understand that\nindeed I am a man and avoid underrating [ridiculing] me \u00ad because if you don't\nejaculate in her, girls are great gossips and you may hear about that issue\nsomewhere else. The girls may spread the news and be talking about you\neverywhere, and a lot of zibwenzi [casual sexual partnering] ends because of\nthis, when a man insists on using Chishango [local condom brand].\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 11\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 363\nThe following quote brings together several of the themes touched on above \u00ad\nmobility, status, masculinity and HIV. While chatting in a small marketplace near the\nmain road, one young man begins boasting about his brother, and how his brother will\ncome back from South Africa with money and luxury goods to distribute to the stay-at-\nhomes. As a result of his exploits, he will be able to sleep with any woman he wants,\nunlike the local boys. Stung by this, one of his companions retorts that he himself has\nslept with all the girls that the brother wants, and therefore, if anybody is going to be\nthe cause of an AIDS outbreak in the village, it will be the local boy and not the\nbraggart from the city.\nA young brother of this man who went to South Africa ... started boasting,\n\"My brother today he is having his passport renewed and probably tomorrow as\nhis plan [he will be] be going to South Africa and [coming] back in December\n2001. And he said this time he will bring more goods, TV's, car cells/batteries\nand he will want to have his house roofed with iron sheets. I have to propose\n[sex to] Mary for him [so that] when he is coming back he should be enjoying\n[sex] with her. I know Mary won't refuse for she definitely knows that my\nbrother has a lot of money in cash and even in the bank, and [every time he goes\nto] he has in South Africa [he has] a great amount of money in terms of Malawi\ncurrency. The women he has slept with are the beautiful ones - even you, Phiri,\nyou have never slept with them though you claim to have a lot of money.\" (Phiri\nis the young brother of [the owner of] a successful rural store).\nPhiri said, \"You don't know [that] I have slept with all beautiful young girls\nhere within [the neighbourhood], he is just following in my footprints (he\nmeaning Russell, the one going to South Africa). He is going after the ones who\nI have already gone with. You ask who? Like Khadija? Khadija Banda I have\nslept with her for so long and I dropped her because I was fed up with her. Like\nSusan, like Abiti James, I have slept with them all. And if I have AIDS then\nRussell has also it, I have given him HIV via these girls and don't be so proud,\nhe is going to die soon. He has gotten AIDS from the girls and how is he going\nto prosper?\"\nAnd we were laughing. And the young brother of Russell said, \"You have\nAIDS?\" And Phiri said, \"Yes, I have it, even your brother also has it for I gave it\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 11\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n364 http://www.demographic-research.org\n6. Serostatus belief and sexual behaviour\nThis relationship between HIV, sexual conquest, status and mobility suggests that ideas\nabout masculinity among young Malawian men are being reconfigured in the process of\ntalking about the epidemic. In social-psychological terms this is a fascinating insight\ninto gender transformations, but in public health terms what is of more consequences is\nthe way that beliefs about being HIV-positive are used to justify high-risk sexual\nbehaviour. The professed belief that one already has HIV gives young men another\nreason not to use condoms or limit numbers of partners \u00ad if the virus has already gotten\nthem, what's the point in foregoing future enjoyment by using a condom or passing up\nchances for sex? If one truly has AIDS, sex may be one's last pleasure. As one of\nSimon's friends put it, if he knew he had AIDS, he would see \"no need to stop doing\nsex, but rather continue doing it until [we] two are so sick with the disease that we\ncannot do the exercise\" (Simon, 6th journal, June 2002). The same friend also punned\non the well-known advice that HIV-positive people should eat a balanced diet in order\nto ward off infections, and said that if he had HIV, he would indeed want to \"balance\nhis diet\" by having sex with diverse women, most of whom he assumed would also be\nHIV-positive (ibid). Some men claimed that they were already doing exactly that. They\nsay that they will \"continue on with affairs\", and not bother with condoms, because \"I\nknow I am already infected\". Other young men talk about sex and lust for attractive\nwomen as a powerful force which is almost impossible for a man to resist \u00ad and indeed,\nwhy resist if resistance will not protect you from anything? (see Kaler 2002).\nThe link between a particular mindset concerning one's serostatus and a particular\nset of sexual behaviours is very hard to establish, however, largely because men's\nbeliefs about their serostatus appear to shift from time to time and place to place. It is\nimpossible to say for certain what a man really believes about his own serostatus,\nwithout access to his innermost thoughts, which no data collection method short of\ntelepathy can provide. Indeed, the idea that there is a fixed, unchanging belief about\none's serostatus, analogous to a fixed unchanging belief about the colour of one's hair,\nis not supported in the journals. Men may make different claims in different settings,\nthey may claim that they know they are going to die one moment and then talk about\nadopting preventive measures the next.\nThe excerpt below exemplifies the shifting, unstable nature of claims about one's\nserostatus. The incident involves a group of young men hanging around at the local\nmarket. One of them, Livingstone, announces that he has changed his ways in light of\nthe AIDS epidemic, he used to have many partners but now he is \"selective\"\n(presumably in order to avoid losing his HIV negativity). Yet a moment later, he\nannounces that he thinks he must be HIV-positive, because of the number of girlfriends\nhe has had (and invoking the mobility metaphor of the bus once again). Later still in the\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 11\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 365\nconversation, Livingstone and his friends depart, leaving the journalist alone with one\nof Livingstone's friends, Peter, who says that Livingstone is a liar. He has not changed\nhis ways, according to the friend, he still has sex with whomever he can persuade or\ncoerce, unlike who claims to follow a different model of sexual behaviour. Peter is sure\nthat Livingstone must have HIV.\nLivingstone said, `I am indeed now grown up \u00ad but the fact is not long ago I was\ntroubling women a lot. I could not just see a woman like that one and just leave\nher like that without following her until I slept with her (he laughed). Because\nnowadays there are more diseases which have come, including AIDS, it seems I\nhave lowered my pulse [decreased my sexual interest].'\nEmmerson said, `Livingstone, you have to tell the truth! Are you really afraid of\nAIDS?' (Emmerson is a best friend to Livingstone).\nAnd Livingstone said, `Ooh! Yes. I am very concerned about AIDS nowadays,\n[much more] than before. Even though I go for sexual partners, I go with timing\n(he said `timing' in English, I think meaning `with much awareness.')\nAnd I asked, `What kind of timing are you saying, friend?'\nAnd Livingstone said `Timing in terms of selecting.'\nEmmerson said, `Indeed Livingstone, I can assure you that in terms of selecting,\nyou were the hero. You were going with beautiful ladies indeed. Martha, both\nMarthas, that's Martha Nsondole and Martha Chupa, etc.\"...Then the talk went\non, to the point of Livingstone saying that he (Livingstone) is in the group of\npeople who assume they themselves have the disease (he said this himself\ncheerfully, and with no sign of concern), and he went on saying that he had slept\nwith so many girls that if one tried to make them board a bus you would need\nthe Zasintha bus. ... [After Livingstone and Emmerson have gone for a walk]\nPeter said, `I prevent it [getting HIV] by not having many partners. I only have\nthis one and after ending this partnership I will go for someone else and this\ntime only one partner [at a time] as well. In addition, I don't do rape [referring\nto aggressive male sexuality in general, not only criminal rape] as these friends\ndo (meaning Felesi, Livingstone and Emmerson who had just gone inside the\nmarket for a walk). Livingstone was lying to you [when he said] that he had\nstopped raping and says he's afraid of AIDS.'\nI said Livingstone said that, and also that he assumes he has AIDS.\nPeter said, `He is a liar, Livingstone goes for raping, in December 2001 he raped a\ncertain beautiful middle-aged woman from Zambia who was totally drunk on\nkachaso [strong home-brewed alcohol]. He was also drunk, he followed her and\nraped her. The case was known to the chief, for a lady cried out and people came.\nLivingstone lied to them saying they agreed to have sex, and because both of them\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 11\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n366 http://www.demographic-research.org\nwere drunk the people who had gathered believed him. And that he has AIDS, I\nbelieve he has indeed, even though I am not a doctor. But you heard yourself that\neven a Zasintha bus can be filled by the ladies with whom he has slept--plain [no\n7. Conclusions\nFrom this paper, I draw several conclusions. First, the relationship between HIV risk\nand masculinity is more complex than has previously been thought. Other observers\nhave made the link between masculinity and high-risk behaviour, especially in the\n1997). The existing work suggests that concepts and markers of masculinity are the\nbackground against which high-risk behaviours are played out, thereby accelerating the\nepidemic. However, this present study suggests masculinity itself is being transformed\nby the AIDS epidemic, as HIV status is incorporated into ideas about what real\nmanliness involves. Claims to be HIV-positive have become currency in the boasting\ngames through which men brag about their status vis a vis other men, as these claims\nunderline the quantity and quality of the sex one has had. Actually having AIDS has not\nbecome a desirable thing among Malawian men, but the evidence in this paper points to\nan ongoing reconfiguration of masculinity and an incorporation of the AIDS epidemic,\nunder certain conditions, into masculine status formation. Given the relative\nhomogeneity of masculinity scripts around the world, with emphasis on both\nheterosexual activity and taking risks, I doubt that these Malawian men are unique.\nIn addition to shedding light on new formulations of masculinity, this paper also\ndemonstrates the diverse meanings of HIV in Malawian communities. Most research on\nhow people think about AIDS has focused on formulations of stigma, and denial. The\nevidence in this paper does not challenge these formulations but highlights the fact that\nthe connotations of AIDS are highly context-dependent. In many settings, AIDS is\nindeed associated with shame and guilt (Note 14). However, in other contexts such as\nmale homosocial groups, the virus may take on different meanings altogether.\nThird, the fact that so many men claim that they are HIV-positive, and more\nimportantly that they appear to use this belief as a justification for continued unsafe sex\nhas major implications for future research and for HIV prevention education. Men's\nclaims to have HIV should be read in the light of quantitative findings from similar\nsettings, in which people who claimed to be HIV-positive actually were not. For\nexample, Kengeya-Kayondo et al (1999) found that among Ugandan men who said that\nthey believed themselves to be HIV-positive, only 32% actually were, based on blood\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 11\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 367\ntests. In a social climate in which AIDS is assumed to be highly infectious and in which\nthe sentiment that \"everyone has AIDS now\" is frequently heard, it is not surprising that\nsome men may assume that they already have HIV, presenting a major challenge for\nIEC and behaviour change campaigns.\nOne way to meet this challenge might be for educational campaigns to point out\nthat HIV infectivity is not as high as supposed, and thus even though a person may have\nengaged in high-risk behaviour, the odds are still good that he or she is still HIV\nnegative and thus can still save him or herself from death by AIDS. However, given the\nhuman capacity for finding justifications for doing what one wants, such a campaign\nruns the risk of being interpreted as saying that HIV is not really that dangerous, and so\nthe need for condoms and restraint is overblown. From an HIV prevention standpoint,\nthe ideal mindset may be that of the person who believes he is HIV-negative but also\nbelieves that his next sexual encounter without a condom will give him HIV.\nEncouraging this mindset, though, is much easier said than done. One possible theme\nwhich could be taken up in IEC is the risk of reinfection for HIV-positive individuals\nwho have unprotected sex with other HIV-positive individuals. Although the exact\nnature and consequences of reinfection are debated, educational material highlighting\nthe prospects of reinfection might at least give men who believe themselves, rightly or\nwrongly, to be HIV-positive a reason to use condoms (Kamya 1998 gives reason to\nthink that emphasizing the dangers of reinfection may lead to condom use in HIV-\npositive men; see also Were and Kiirya 1998). Along the same lines, this paper may\noffer tentative support for the expansion of voluntary counseling and testing\nprogrammes. If we assume that many Malawians who think they are HIV-positive may\nactually be negative, then it is possible that learning the truth about their serostatus may\nencourage them to change their behaviour.\nMen and masculinity have come under the lens in this paper, thanks to the\njournalists' unique access to what men say and do beyond the gaze of surveys,\nquestionnaires and the standard equipment of demographic research. \"Typical male\nbehaviour\" is implicated in the transmission of HIV; at a deeper and more subtle level,\nso is the concept of masculinity which drives such behaviour, at least in part. Ideas as\nwell as actions concerning HIV are linked to gender identity and in this case are fed by\ninaccurate beliefs about the virulence and infectivity of HIV. At all levels, ranging from\nthe symbolic to the behavioural to the epidemiological, AIDS is a gendered epidemic.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 11\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n368 http://www.demographic-research.org\nNotes\n1. Work for this paper was supported in part by the Wenner-Gren Foundation. I am\ngrateful for comments by Shelley Clark, Joseph de Graff-Johnson, Francis Dodoo,\nNancy Luke, Mike Mtika, Tanya Taylor, Susan Watkins and Eliya Zulu on an\nearlier draft.\n2. See Mtika 2001 for ideas as to why men might talk more about their sexual\nadventures than women.\n3. This rate varies according to the gender of the uninfected partner, the presence or\nabsence of genital ulcers in the uninfected partner, and the viral load of the infected\n4. Pseudonyms were assigned to the speakers whose words were recorded in the\njournals in order to preserve their privacy.\n5. \"Natural discourse\" does not imply unmediated discourse. These journals are\nvulnerable to \"speaker bias\", as some people within a conversation group will\nspeak up while others, for reasons to do with personal characteristics or social\npositions, will remain silent and thus unrepresented n this paper. In addition, these\naccounts of what people say about AIDS are only that \u00ad accounts of what people\nsay, not of what they do to what they intend or even what they believe. We must\nthus be very careful about extrapolating behaviour from these journals.\n6. Or perhaps more accurately, trading the structures and conventions of the interview\nsituation for those of the peer group.\n7. I say \"voiced\" deliberately instead of \"heard\", because the journals contain silences\nas well as voices. We do not know the views or experiences of those who don't\nspeak up in public; we do not know the extent to which conversation settings\nsilence some participants even as they facilitate the voices of others.\n9. Indeed, as I argue below, living up to, or down to, the types of behaviour depicted\nin AIDS educational materials may be a point of pride for some men.\ngoing out to work in the 1940s through 1970s marked a personal transition between\nbeing considered a boy and being considered a man equal with other men.\n11. HIV-positive status, as distinct from the ravages of AIDS, was often associated\nwith high sexual status in general, among women as well as men. Men's comments\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 11\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 369\non the most beautiful and desirable women around them often included speculation\nthat the women probably had HIV as a consequence of her sexiness, especially\nwhen the woman in question came from town or was observed to be expensively\ndressed, as no one so beautiful could possibly be sexually inexperienced. Although\nyoung men might admire the beautiful, sexy, allegedly HIV+ woman, they \"went\nfor\" women of lower status who were assumed as a result of their background to be\nHIV-free. Incorporating HIV-related characteristics into partner choice was the\ndominant form of behaviour change in the face of HIV (Kaler 2002).\n12. See Nioka 2001 for more on STDs in general as markers of masculinity among\nyoung men.\n13. Clearly, being the transmitter of AIDS is more highly regarded than being the\n\"transmittee\". In another account of HIV transmission as a source of male pride,\nSimon was part of a conversation about HIV at a funeral, during which man opined\nthat \"It is painful and very bad to die because of women. It is better that we men\nshould be [catching] disease elsewhere and be giving them [i.e. giving diseases to\nfor an interpretation of claims to transmit HIV as a way of asserting some degree of\ncontrol over the epidemic.\n14.
