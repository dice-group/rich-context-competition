    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study evaluated the effect of training pharmacists in the stage-of-change model for smoking cessation and motivational\ninterviewing on smoking cessation outcomes. A training based on the stage-of-change model for smoking cessation and\nmotivational interviewing was introduced to pharmacists. Pharmacists were randomly assigned to the intervention or\ncontrol group. The control group attended a 3-hour training session, whereas the intervention group also attended a\nfurther 6-hour training session. At week 24, 12.2percent of the smokers quit smoking in the intervention group, whereas\n1.6percent of the smokers quit smoking in the control group. The findings of this study showed that training pharmacists,\nin the stage-of-change model for smoking cessation and motivational interviewing, improves smoking reduction and\ncessation rates.\n",

Death is mainly\ncaused by lung cancer, coronary heart disease, chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease, and stroke (Doll et\nal.,\nThe risk of serious disease diminishes rapidly after quitting\nand permanent abstinence is known to reduce the risk of\nillness (Lightwood and Glantz, 1997; US Department of\nHealth Human Services, 1990). Offering help to people\naddicted to nicotine is one of the six policies identified by\nthe WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\n(FCTC) to expand the fight against the tobacco epidemic\n(WHO, 2009). However, smoking cessation turned out to\nbe anything but simple, and for this reason, more and more\nclinicians and researchers consider it a complex learning\nUnfortunately, about 80\npercent of smokers have no\nimmediate intention to quit (Herzog and Blagg, 2007).\nThe efficacy of smoking cessation interventions in vari-\nous clinical settings has been well documented, and studies\nhave demonstrated that personal motivation (Curry etal.,\n(Sinclair etal., 1995) can further improve smoking cessa-\ntion rates.

In a preliminary study focused on experiences of\ncustomers in a community pharmacy setting (Sinclair etal.,\n1995), three-quarters of NRT users interviewed recalled\nhaving received some counseling from the pharmacist and/\nor the pharmacy assistant, and almost all of these customers\nfelt that the counseling was helpful. However, more than a\nquarter did not recall receiving any counseling, and most of\nthese customers reported they would have valued some\nsmoking cessation counseling from a pharmacist.\nMost pharmacists are eager to undertake a leading role\nin health promotion (Bond et\nal.,\nhave been raised that pharmacists are not trained for smok-\ning cessation counseling and their advice may conflict with\nadvice given from a patient's general medical practitioner\nTraining hospital doctors, general practitioners, and\nnurses in promoting and sustaining behavioral change\namong their patients has been shown to be effective for pro-\nmoting smoking cessation (Cornuz etal., 2002; T\u00f8nnesen\nThis randomized controlled study, conducted in pharma-\ncies in Sicily, Italy, evaluated the effect on pharmacy cus-\ntomers' cessation outcomes when pharmacists were trained\nin the stage-of-change model for smoking cessation (Di\nClemente, 2001) and motivational interviewing (MI)\nIn this model, proposed by Prochaska and Di Clemente\nand colleagues, change is conceptualized as a process\noccurring in five stages: precontemplation, contemplation,\npreparation for action, action, and maintenance. In the con-\ntext of cigarette addiction, the stage-of-change model pro-\nposes \"stage-matched interventions\" to treat cigarette\naddiction. It is hypothesized that smokers progress linearly\nthrough the five stages and may relapse to earlier stages.\nEach stage is characterized by the presence of divergent\nbeliefs and attitudes toward smoking behavior. This model\nmay assist in determining the type and range of interven-\ntions required by pharmacy personnel and tailoring inter-\nventions to the smoker's current stage which may increase\ntheir likelihood of quitting (Di Clemente, 2001).\nMI is widely used to help smokers quit. It is a patient-\ncentered counseling approach for helping people to explore\nand resolve their ambivalence about changing their smok-\ning behavior. Evidence suggests that MI by general practi-\ntioners and trained counselors motivates patients toward\nchange (Miller and Rollnick, 2013). There is also evidence\nthat MI may be more efficacious relative to other treat-\nments with smokers who are low in motivation to quit\nCustomers seeking help with smoking cessation from\npharmacy personnel are already beyond the \"precontempla-\ntion\" stage of the stage-of-change model. Rather, these\ncustomers are people who have reached the \"contemplation\"\nor \"preparation\" stage and may be intending to purchase a\nsmoking cessation aid. For smokers who decide to stop\nsmoking, pharmacotherapy increases the chances of success\n(Fiore etal., 2008).An understanding of the theory and prac-\ntice of the stage-of-change model and MI could result in\nmore effective counseling, by pairing the appropriate cessa-\ntion advice to the stage of each customer and helping them\nresolve their ambivalences toward change. Well-designed\nsmoking cessation training for pharmacists is needed. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first study designed to\nassess the outcome of training pharmacists in the stage-of-\nchange model of smoking cessation and MI.\nWe hypothesized that pharmacists who participated in a\ntraining based on the stage-of-change model and MI would\nbe more effective than untrained controls to help people\nquit smoking and that many of their customers would\nachieve long-term abstinence from smoking. Hence, the\nmain objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the\ntraining on smoking cessation outcomes. The training\nincluded specific content and recommendations pertaining\nto preparation, action, maintenance, and relapse.\nThe focus of the training was to help participants develop\nan understanding of the key principles of the stage-of-\nchange model and MI approach. Participants learned a series\nof brief questioning to assess the stages of change of their\ncustomers. Strategies to match the stage to the most appro-\npriate intervention to promote cessation were emphasized.\nMethods\nA training based on the stage-of-change model of smoking\ncessation (Di Clemente, 2001) and MI (Miller and Rollnick,\nla Prevenzione e Cura del Tabagismo at the University of\nCatania. The training was previously piloted on a cross sec-\ntion of pharmacy personnel. Case studies of pharmacy cus-\ntomers, communication skills for negotiating change, and\nthe importance of providing ongoing support, encourage-\nment, and pharmacotherapy for cessation were included\nand emphasized in the training.\ntered at Farmacia OK, a Sicilian Pharmacists'Association,\nwere invited to participate in the trial.

Therefore, it was critical to expose participants\nto these internationally accepted evidence-based practice\nguidelines for tobacco dependence.\nSuccessively, pharmacies were randomly allocated, by\nsequential allocation, to the intervention or control group\nCaponnetto et al. 3\n(Figure 1). The intervention group attended a 6-hour\ntraining by scheduling an initiation workshop. The\nhours of anti-smoking training teach the most skilled\npharmacists to be more effective in making them able to\nhelp their smoking customers quit.\nDuring the 3-month customer recruitment period, all\nsmokers who sought advice on smoking cessation or those\nwho bought an OTC anti-smoking product in preparation\nfor a new attempt to stop smoking were eligible for inclu-\nsion. Pharmacy personnel offered these customers a patient\ninformation sheet specific to their group (intervention or\ncontrol) informing them that Farmacia OK pharmacists\nwere working with researchers studying smoking cessation\nat the University of Catania and inviting them to join the\nstudy. Specifically, in the intervention group, smokers were\ninformed that their pharmacists were trained to specific\nanti-smoking counseling based on stage-of-change and MI\ntheories. In the control group, smokers were informed that\ntheir pharmacists recently attended a conference on\n\"Clinical Practice Guidelines for Treating Tobacco Use and\nDependence.\"\nPharmacy staff maintained a confidential client record\nwhich documented their progress in smoking cessation, any\nproduct supplied, points raised by the client, and advice\ngiven. At each of the planned follow-up visits, telephone\ncall reminders were carried out to improve participation.\nHowever, customers were not made aware of their group\nallocation (intervention vs control pharmacy). To monitor\nthe level of non-recruitment, pharmacies in both groups\nmaintained a tally record of customers who declined to join\nthe study and their reasons. Intervention personnel offered\ntheir customers the professional anti-smoking counseling.\nThe control group asked customers to register and then\ncontinued to provide standard professional support.\nThe main outcome measures were number of treated\nsmokers, smoking reduction at week 24, and smoking ces-\nsation rates at week 24, in accordance with Russell\nStandard (Clinical) (West et\ncovered by measuring exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO).\nParticipants who self-reported quit smoking with an eCO\nconcentration of 10ppm at the week 24 follow-up visit\nwere defined as quitters (21). Those smokers who failed\nto meet these criteria (smoking abstinence and eCO\n10ppm) were categorized as smoking cessation failures\n(i.e. relapsers with eCO 10ppm). Smokers setting a firm\nquit date was counted as \"lost to follow-up\" if, on attempt-\ning to determine and verify his or her quitter status, he or\nshe could not be contacted. Success rates were measured\nAt each follow-up time point, cigarette consumption was\nFigure 1. CONSORT flow diagram.\n4 Health Psychology Open \nassessed and counseling was offered. Abstinence from\nsmoking was reviewed objectively throughout the study\nby measuring the levels of eCO at each follow-up visit.\nWindows was used to store and analyze data, to calculate\ndescriptive statistics, and to demonstrate differences\nbetween the intervention and control groups.\nData analysis\nWe use descriptive statistics (i.e. frequencies/percentages,\nmeans/standard deviations) to describe the intervention\ncontent (active vs control group). To describe process\nresults in terms of patterns of quitting, we reported the\nsmoking cessation rates. To describe process results in\nterms of cessation rates, we applied the Fisher test. We used\nintention-to-treat analysis in the context of analysis of vari-\nance (ANOVA) and applied the Wilcoxon/Mann\u00adWhitney\ntest assuming that all those smokers who were lost to fol-\nlow-up were classified as failures.\nResults\nAll 46 community pharmacies registered at Farmacia OK, a\nSicilian Pharmacists'Association, were invited to participate\nin the trial; a total of 42 community pharmacies registered in\nthe Farmacia OK database have participated in the trial. In\nall, 21 pharmacies were randomly allocated by sequential\nallocation to the intervention group and 21 to the control\ngroup; 13 pharmacies of the intervention group completed\nthe study and 8 pharmacies of the control group completed\nthe study. Pharmacies that did not complete the study were\ncontacted by telephone from the principal investigator's\nstudy to know the reasons that prompted them not to com-\nplete the project. About 35\npercent responded that they had\nother priorities to follow at that time, 25percent replied that\nthey did not have enough staff dedicated to the project,\n20percent responded that they did not complete the study for\nthe fear of losing customers in the event of a smoking cessa-\ntion treatment's lack of effectiveness, and 20percent replied\nthat to help smokers takes time and their pharmacy must\nalways be quick and fast so they cannot waste time.\nsmokers were enrolled in the intervention group and 63\nsmokers were enrolled in the control group; Figure 2).\nAt week 24, we have observed a significant reduction in\nthe number of daily cigarettes smoked between the inter-\nvention and control groups.

Customers generally interact with pharmacists\noften and have great esteem and confidence in pharmacists,\nand 86.4percent of pharmacists believe that their profession\nshould become more active in helping patients to quit smok-\ning (Hudmon etal., 2006). Hence, it is very important to\nhave the proper training, to give the right advice to these peo-\nple who are often not well assisted. In Scotland, Coggans\net\npercent of the surveyed\npharmacy patients agreed that they would be willing to dis-\ncuss tobacco cessation with a community pharmacist.\none-third of whom thought that their pharmacist would be a\ngood source of tobacco cessation advice. Also, in one of the\ntwo studies conducted in the United States, Hudmon etal.\n(2003) interviewed NRT users who had either recently quit\n(75% of respondents) or were about to do so. A majority\n=\n103) believed that assistance or advice from a\npharmacist would increase the chance of success in quitting.\nIn the other study, of the 73 patients who completed a survey,\nthose who smoked (n=20) agreed or strongly agreed (85%)\nthat pharmacies were the most convenient places for tobacco\ncessation programs (Hudmon et\nmajority of smokers believe that community pharmacies are\na convenient location for receiving cessation services\n(Couchenour etal., 2002). Research strongly suggests that\npharmacist-led tobacco cessation interventions in commu-\nnity settings are effective. Our study showed higher effec-\ntiveness of pharmacists trained in stage-of-change model on\nsmoking cessation and MI to help smokers quit smoking\ncompared to control group. Because of its design, there are a\nnumber of limitations that must be considered when inter-\npreting the findings of this study (e.g. the small sample size).\nSome characteristics of the sample limit generalization of the\nfindings; all participants were regular smokers with an ele-\nvated level of nicotine dependence (10 cigarettes per day),\nthey were motivated to quit, and all participants were adults\nand customers of \"Farmacia OK group.\" Finally, the findings\nreported from urban Sicilian residents in this study may not\nbe valid for other population samples. Nonetheless, our study\nindicated that training pharmacists in the stage-of-change\nmodel of smoking cessation and MI in a smoking cessation\nprogram is an inexpensive strategy that can be quite effective\nfor smokers. This can represent a good starting point for new\nstudies to improve smoking cessation intervention delivered\nby pharmacists.\nConclusion\nThis study showed the importance to training pharmacists in\nthe stage-of-change model of smoking cessation and MI. In\nfact, trained pharmacists have been more effective than non-\ntrained pharmacists in helping people to quit smoking. This\ncan be a good starting point for future studies to build on.\n"
