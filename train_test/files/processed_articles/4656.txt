Safford1\n Keywords\nHyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing\nspondylitis, inflammatory arthritis\nIntroduction\nThe risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is\nincreased among patients with inflammatory\narthritis (IA) (including rheumatoid arthritis\n[RA], psoriatic arthritis [PsA], and ankylos-\ning spondylitis [AS]).1,2 This increased risk is\npossibly related to accelerated atheroscler-\nosis in the context of chronic inflamma-\ntion.3,4 Several studies have shown a 50% to\n60% higher risk of death from myocardial\ninfarction and stroke in patients with RA\nthan in the general non-RA population,5\u00ad7\nwith the standardized mortality ratio attrib-\nAn increased risk of CVD has also been\nreported in patients with PsA and AS.10\u00ad12\nLike patients with diabetes mellitus (DM),\npatients with RA have a two-fold higher risk\nof CVD compared with the general popula-\ntion.13,14 Evidence-based guidelines have\nbeen promoted to optimize the CVD risk\nin high-risk populations such as those with\nDM, resulting in higher awareness of the\nCVD risk in patients with DM among\nprimary care physicians. However, these\nguidelines do not currently mention IA as\na risk factor for CVD. Thus, CVD risk\nreduction in this high-risk population may\nnot be strongly emphasized by these\nManagement of the risk factors for CVD,\nsuch as high cholesterol levels, can reduce\nthe risk of CVD; however, such manage-\nment may be suboptimal in patients with\nIA.16 For example, a recent study reported\nthat about 40% of patients with RA who\nhad CVD risk factors were not screened for\nhyperlipidemia even after having experi-\nenced a CVD event.17 However, few studies\nhave examined hyperlipidemia treatment\npatterns in patients with IA among those\nwith an elevated CVD risk. We used data\nfrom the national REasons for Geographic\nAnd Racial Differences in Stroke\n(REGARDS) cohort to compare hyperlip-\nidemia treatment of participants with and\nwithout IA, controlling for individual-level\nfactors that influence utilization of health\nservices as conceptualized by Aday and\nMethods\nParticipants\ncommunity-dwelling black and white\nadults from the 48 contiguous United\nwere assessed with a telephone survey and\nin-home visit that included a blood draw\nand pill bottle review.19 IA was identified\nthrough medications specific to autoimmune\ndisease (Table 1). Individuals with IA (with-\nout DM or hypertension) were compared\nwith individuals with DM (with or without\nhypertension but no IA); those with hyper-\ntension (but no diabetes or IA); and those\nwithout IA, DM, or hypertension. The risk\nof CVD was assessed at the time of the\nREGARDS baseline following Adult\nTreatment Panel III recommendations,\nwhich were in force at the time of the\nstudy.20 The study sample included only\nparticipants with indications for lipid treat-\nment according to these guidelines (See\nAppendix for definition of hyperlipidemia).\nThis study was approved by the Institutional\nReview Board at the University of Alabama\nat Birmingham.\nNavarro-Milla\nVariables\nThe Aday and Andersen framework\naccounts for individual influences on access\nto healthcare including predisposing,\nenabling, and need factors. REGARDS\ncollected detailed information regarding\nmany variables within each construct of\nthis framework.18 These variables were col-\nlected at the time of the REGARDS\nbaseline through telephone interviews, self-\nadministered questionnaires, and in-home\nexaminations. Information included the par-\nticipants' age, race, sex, region of residence,\neducation, household income, cigarette\nsmoking status, alcohol consumption, mari-\ntal status, cognitive function, symptoms of\ndepression, current antihypertensive medi-\ncation use, use of pills or insulin for treat-\nment of DM, and self-reports of a previous\ndiagnosis of myocardial infarction, coron-\nary revascularization, stroke, abdominal\naortic aneurysm, or DM. During the\nin-home study visits, prescription and over-\nthe-counter medications were documented\nthrough a pill bottle review. Participants\nunderwent a physical examination including\nmeasurement of systolic blood pressure,\nwhich was estimated based on the average\nof two measurements after a seated 5-minute\nrest with both feet on the floor. Height and\nweight were also measured during this exam-\nination. Blood samples were collected, and\ncholesterol levels were assessed in a central\nlaboratory at the University of Vermont.\nStatistical analysis\nWe used descriptive statistics to characterize\nthe cohort according to the four groups of\ninterest: participants with IA only, without\nDM or hypertension; participants with DM\nwith or without hypertension but no IA;\nparticipants with hypertension without IA\nor DM; and participants without IA, hyper-\ntension, or DM. Logistic regression models\nwere used to examine the odds of treatment\namong the four groups of interest (com-\nparing the first three groups to participants\nwithout IA, DM, or hypertension) after\naccounting for predisposing, enabling, and\nneed factors guided by Aday and Andersen's\nmodel of health services utilization.18\nMissing information was imputed by\nchained equations with m \u00bc 20 imputations\nand 10 iterations.21 The analysis was con-\nducted using SAS software (SAS Institute\nInc., Cary, NC, USA).\nResults\nhad DM with or without hypertension but\nno IA, 7534 had hypertension but no IA or\nDM, and 5288 had no DM, hypertension, or\nIA. Proportionately fewer patients with\nthan without IA were treated with lipid\nmedications (Figure 1). Hyperlipidemic par-\nticipants with IA were younger and predom-\ninately women, with lower Framingham risk\nscores and lower functional status (Table 2).\nThe unadjusted model revealed that the\nlikelihood of treatment with lipid medica-\ntions was similar between individuals with\nIA and individuals without IA, DM, or\nTable 1.

The fully adjusted odds of\ntreatment for participants with IA were 27%\nlower than the odds for participants without\nIA, DM, or hypertension, or IA, although\nthe difference was not statistically significant\n(Table 3). Participants with DM with or\nwithout hypertension but no IA and partici-\npants with hypertension and no IA or DM\nwere twice as likely to be treated for hyper-\nlipidemia than those without IA, DM, or\nhypertension.\nDiscussion\nIn this study, hyperlipidemic participants\nwith IA were less likely to be treated\nfor hyperlipidemia than were participants\nwith DM or hypertension, diseases well\nknown to increase the risk of CVD, even\nafter accounting for the CVD risk level.\nIn fact, those with IA may have had lower\nodds of treatment than others with a similar\nCVD risk but without IA, DM, or hyper-\ntension, although the small number of\nparticipants with IA limited the power of\nthis study. If confirmed in larger samples,\nthese results reflect a potential gap in the\nmanagement of hyperlipidemia for patients\nwith IA. Because the multivariable models\naccounted for individual-level factors that\ninfluence the utilization of health services,\nother influences may be at play, such\nas suboptimal prescribing practices by\nphysicians.\nOur results identify a gap in the manage-\nment of hyperlipidemia, reflecting the need\nfor a multidisciplinary approach that\nincludes rheumatologists and primary care\nphysicians.22 Clearly establishing which\nphysician is taking the lead in the screening\nand management of CVD risk factors\namong patients with inflammatory joint\ndisease is crucial for a successful approach\nto this comorbidity. Indeed, CVD risk factor\nmanagement is not commonly within the\nscope of practice of rheumatologists, who\nmay recognize that their patients with IA are\nat high risk but may not feel comfortable\nmanaging hyperlipidemia. Because clinical\npractice guidelines for the management of\nhyperlipidemia do not currently include\npatients with IA as a high-risk group,\nprimary care physicians may not be as\naware of this higher risk in patients with\nIA compared with those with DM, who are\nspecifically recognized in the guidelines.\nInflammation plays a major role in the\nacceleration of atherosclerosis in patients\nwith IA. There appears to be usefulness in\nbiomarkers that can serve as a surrogate for\nendothelial damage, which can lead to\naccelerated atherosclerosis in these patients.\nOne study identified dimethylarginines as a\npossible mediator of endothelial damage as\nFigure 1.

These\nguidelines emphasize the importance of\nscreening and management of hyperlipid-\nemia as well as other modifiable CVD risk\nfactors not only among patients with RA\nbut also among those with PsA and AS.24\nThe benefits of aggressive CVD risk opti-\nmization have resulted in decreased CVD\nmortality among patients with DM. A simi-\nlar approach may benefit patients with IA,\nbut our results reflect a gap in the current\ntreatment patterns.25\nOur study has several strengths, including\nthe use of data from a prospective cohort\nthat included African-Americans and\nCaucasians from rural and urban areas in\n48 of the 50 United States. Our study has\nextensive patient-level data, including medi-\ncations, health behaviors, and physiologic\nmeasures, allowing for control of multiple\npossible cofounders not previously reported.\nSeveral limitations should also be noted. IA\nwas defined using medications specific for\nIA, which could have led to misclassification\nof some patients, although the specificity of\nthe medications for IA lessens this concern.\nThe small sample of patients with IA is\nanother potential limitation, but the concern\nis lessened by the very narrow confidence\nintervals around the point estimates, sug-\ngesting little variability in the finding.\nIn conclusion, the treatment of hyperlip-\nidemia in patients with IA in this sample was\nsuboptimal compared with other conditions\nknown to similarly increase the risk of CVD,\nsuch as hypertension and DM. Interventions\nto improve the treatment of hyperlipidemia\nin this recently recognized high-risk group\nmay be needed.\n"
