As measured in the Na-\ntional Health and Nutition Examination Survey\n(NHANES), the percentage of calories from fat\ndecreased from 36% to 33% and saturated fat from\naverage total food intake increased over the same\nperiod, so that total fat and total saturated fat re-\nmained stable or increased.1\nOverall, Americans remain above guidelines for\nconsumption of saturated fat and total fat. The US\nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA) Dietary\nGuidelines for Americans 2005 recommends that\nadults maintain their total fat intake between 20%\nand 35% of caloric intake and saturated fat con-\nsumption below 10% of caloric intake (20 g sat-\nurated fat for a 2000-kcal diet).2 Cross-sectional\ndata from NHANES III shows little variation in\npercentage of total and saturated fat by age except\nfor somewhat lower percentage consumed among\nthose 60 years of age. However, total caloric intake\ngenerally increases with age in childhood, peaking at\nsomewhat in later adulthood. Therefore, total fat\nconsumption is highest among teenagers,3,4 and in-\ntake of fast food (generally high in fat) is highest\namong children, teenagers and young adults5\nMultiple factors influence individuals' food\nchoices, including their home environments.\nThis article was externally peer reviewed.\nFrom the Division of General Medicine, Department of\nInternal Medicine, University of Iowa (HHL), Iowa City,\nIA; Child Health Evaluation and Research Unit, Division of\nGeneral Pediatrics, Department of Pediatrics, University of\nMichigan (MMD), Ann Arbor, MI; Division of General\nMedicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of\nMichigan (TPH, MMD), Ann Arbor, MI; Veterans Affairs\nCenter for Practice Management and Outcomes Research,\nVeterans Affairs Ann Arbor Healthcare System (TPH), Ann\nArbor, MI.\nFunding: This research was supported by the Robert\nWood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program and by the Na-\ntional Institute of Child Health and Human Development\nDisclaimer: This material is the result of work supported\nwith resources and the use of facilities at the Iowa Veterans\nAffairs Medical Center.

Laroche, MD, Veterans\nLaroche@uiowa.edu).\nWithin families, there are correlations between the\nfat intake of spouses6,7 and between adults' and\nchildren's diets.8,9 This finding has been inter-\npreted as parental influence on children's diets, but\nmay also signify a reciprocal influence of children\non adults. The impact of children on adults dietary\nbehavior is poorly understood. Previous investiga-\ntors have postulated that having children in the\nhousehold might increase fat intake,10 but this hy-\npothesis has not been tested in a national sample.\nIn this study, we examine diet patterns of 2\ngroups of adults, those with minor children in the\nhousehold versus those without, using a nationally\nrepresentative sample from NHANES III.\nMethods\nStudy Sample\nThe NHANES III survey was conducted from\nnoninstitutionalized population aged 2 months and\nolder was drawn from 89 sites using a complex,\nstratified, multistage probability cluster design.11\nMexican Americans, African Americans, and adults\n60 years of age were oversampled. Race/ethnicity\nwas self-reported and categorized into non-His-\npanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican Ameri-\ncan, and other.12 Interviews took place in the re-\nspondents' homes and then respondents were\ninvited to the Mobile Examination Centers (MEC)\nfor further examination and data collection (includ-\ning the 24-hour dietary recall). The overall\nweighted response rates were 82% for the interview\nFrom the NHANES public-use data set, we\nidentified adults aged 17 to 65 years living in\nhouseholds with and without children. Families\nwith children were identified through eligibility for\nquestions that were only asked of families with\nchildren younger than 17 years of age relating to\nfood insecurity. Families were coded by NHANES\nas yes, no, eligible but missing, and missing (de-\nfined as not eligible ie, not having children under\n17). This allowed us to identify families with chil-\ndren less than 17 years old but did not allow for\nfurther information to be collected about the chil-\ndren (ie, age, sex, and number of children were not\navailable). Analysis was limited to the second phase\nquestions used to identify adults with children were\nAfter examining the distribution of kilocalories\nin our sample, we excluded outliers in the top and\nbottom 1% for total kilocalories per 24 hours based\nkcal; 135 observations) to create our final analytic\nsample. We excluded these extreme outliers based\non the assumption that these kilocalorie values\nwere unlikely to represent the participants' usual\ndaily intake.\nOutcome Measures\nThe principal outcome variables were total fat in-\ntake and total saturated fat intake (in grams), based\non a 24-hour dietary recall. The secondary out-\ncome was total kilocalorie consumption, also based\non 24-hour dietary recall.\nGiven our findings regarding total fat intake, we\nalso examined intake frequencies of individual\nfoods reported by NHANES respondents. Analysis\nof individual food frequencies was based on the\nfood frequency questionnaire13 administered at\nhome to all adults in the survey. Dependent vari-\nables included the number of times a particular\nfood was consumed per month. In consultation\nwith a nutritionist, high fat foods were chosen from\namong 60 available food frequencies to correspond\nto those identified by the USDA guidelines2 as\nmajor sources of saturated fat in the American diet\nand other types of contrasting fats identified by the\ninvestigators. Specific high fat food groups ana-\nlyzed were: ice cream, ice milk and milk shakes;\nsalty snacks; cheese; pizza, calzones and lasagna;\ncheese dishes; bacon, sausage and luncheon meats;\nbeef; chicken and turkey; eggs; cakes, cookies,\nbrownies, pies, donuts and pastries; chocolate\ncandy and fudge; margarine; butter; and mayon-\nnaise, oil and vinegar, and salad dressings.\nIndependent Variables\nThe independent variable of chief interest was the\npresence or absence of one or more children in the\nhome. Other independent variables included re-\nspondents education, race/ethnicity, age, presence\nof a spouse or spouse equivalent in the home, pov-\nerty-income ratio, gender, foreign-born status, and\nbody mass index (BMI). Simple imputation was\nused to impute missing values of poverty-income\nratio based on a regression using race, age, sex,\nforeign born status, education, family size, and an-\nother separate income variable (491 observations\nimputed, 7.4% of sample). This method is appro-\npriate because the imputed values comprised less\nthan 10% of the sample. Regressions were also\nanalyzed with and without imputed values and with\nand without income variables, and there were no\nsignificant differences in conclusions, so analyses\nwith imputation are presented.\nAnalyses of 24-hour Dietary Consumption Patterns\nSTATA 8.0 was used for all analyses (Stata Corp.,\nCollege Station, TX). Commands used Taylor lin-\nearization for the variance estimation to account\nfor the complex survey design using NHANES-\nassigned weights, population sampling units, and\nstrata. All results presented are based on analyses\nwith sample weights.\nWe used linear regression for all analyses of the\nprincipal and secondary outcomes, using log trans-\nformation to normalize the distributions. Indepen-\ndent variables described above that were found to\nbe associated with total fat intake in bivariate\nanalyses were included in all models; adult BMI\nand presence of spouse were not associated with\nfat intake. The Duan smearing technique for\nweighted, log-transformed data was used to obtain\nadjusted mean estimates.14 Bootstrapping was used\nto estimate confidence intervals.\nAnalyses of Individual Food Frequencies\nLogistic regression was used for food frequency\nanalysis. Depending on the distribution of food\nfrequencies for each food item, we dichotomized\nresults as eating the food either more than once a\nweek or daily and above versus those eating the\nfood less frequently. For consistency we used the\nsame independent variables as for the analyses of fat\nintake.\nSensitivity Analyses\nRegressions for primary outcomes analyses were\nrepeated for a subpopulation age 22 to 65 (exclud-\ning the 17 to 21 year olds). In several additional\nsensitivity analyses, we added 24-hour total kilo-\ncalorie consumption as a control variable. We\ncould not control for number of children in the\nhome. Because African Americans, Mexican Amer-\nicans, and some adults of foreign birth typically\nhave higher birth rates than non-Hispanic whites,15\nwe also modeled interaction terms for race/ethnic-\nity and child, and for foreign-born status and child.\nIn addition, gender and child interactions were\nexplored. None of these interaction terms were\nstatistically significant, so all were excluded from\nthe final model. Age was examined both as a con-\ntinous variable (presented) and explored in second-\nary analyses as a categorical variable.\nThis study was approved as exempt by the Uni-\nversity of Michigan Medical School Institutional\nReview Board.\nResults\nSample Characteristics\nThe analytic sample included 6660 respondents;\n48% of adult respondents reported one or more\nchildren in the household. African American and\nMexican American households were dispropor-\ntionately more likely to have children (P  .001)\n(Table 1).\nPatterns of Total Fat, Saturated Fat, and Calorie\nConsumption\nOverall, presence of children in the household was\nassociated with significantly higher adjusted total\nThe presence of children in the household was also\nassociated with significantly higher adjusted satu-\n(Table 2). Interaction terms were not significant,\nsuggesting no differential effect of children by race,\nforeign-born status, or gender of the adult. We also\nevaluated whether the effect of having children on\nfat consumption was modified by adult age group\nbut found no statistically significant difference.\nWith inclusion of total kilocalories in the model,\nthe associations of children with adult total fat\nintake and saturated fat intake showed the same\ntrend but were no longer statistically significant\nAdults aged 17 to 21 years are those most likely\nto represent a sibling rather than a parent or guard-\nian. In sensitivity analyses for fat consumption ex-\ncluding adults aged 17 to 21 years, the differences\nin fat consumption were even greater: 5.5 g of total\nAnalysis of total caloric consumption showed no\nsignificant association with presence of children in\nthe household (Table 2).\nPatterns of Consumptions for Individual Foods\nFood frequency data revealed that adults with chil-\ndren in the home have higher odds of drinking any\nbut do not have higher odds of frequently drinking\nmilk (daily or greater) vs. some or none. They were\nnot significantly more likely to drink whole milk.\nAdults with children had significantly higher odds\nof frequently eating pizza, cheese, beef, salty\nsnacks, cakes and cookies, ice cream, bacon/sau-\nsage/processed meats and peanuts (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nThis study indicates, in a nationally representative\nsample, that the presence of children in the home is\nassociated with higher total fat and saturated fat\nintake among adults. To put these differences in\nperspective, the approximately 2-g difference in\nsaturated fat intake is the equivalent of one addi-\ntional standard slice of pepperoni pizza every day,\nor almost one additional pizza per week.16 This\nfinding is consistent with a preliminary analysis by\nEmmons et al of a predominantly white sample\nmons, personal communication, 2005). The results\ndiffer somewhat from a small study in one Austra-\nlian community (405 subjects), which found higher\ncaloric consumption among women with children\nversus women without, but no significant differ-\nence in fat consumption.17\nThe association of children with total fat con-\nsumption in the NHANES sample was attenuated\nby controlling for total caloric consumption. This\nTable 1.

Consistent with\nthis view, analysis of total caloric consumption for\n24 hours found slightly higher (but not significantly\nhigher) caloric intake for adults with children in the\nhome.\nData from a limited food frequency question-\nnaire enabled us to examine some high-fat food\nchoices. Adults with children ate many high-fat\nfoods more frequently than adults without children\nin the home, including salty snacks, pizza, cheese,\nbeef, ice cream, cakes and cookies, bacon/sausage/\nprocessed meats and peanuts. In particular, adults\nwith children in the home had more frequent\ncheese intake along with increased fat intake. This\npattern is consistent with previous research show-\ning increased fat consumption among people eating\nthe most cheese compared with no difference asso-\nciated with overall dairy consumption.18 Other\nanalyses have indicated that dairy foods contribute\n19% of fat and 32% of saturated fat to the Amer-\nPotential explanations for the above findings are\nrelated to time pressures and constraints among\nadults with children, children's preferences for high\nfat, high sugar foods19 and parents' perceptions of\nwhat children are likely to eat. In response to time\nconstraints, adults may purchase more restaurant,\nready-to-eat, or snack foods, all which are likely to\nbe higher in fat content. Parents may intentionally\nchoose some higher-fat foods for their children\nsuch as non-skim milk products. Parents may also\npurchase foods they expect their children will eat,\nsuch as cheese. Although not specifically purchased\nfor the adult, we hypothesize that adults will be\nmore likely to consume these foods if present in the\nhousehold, compared with adults without children\nwho may not purchase these items as frequently.\nSalty snacks, pizza, beef (in the form of ham-\nburgers), ice cream, and cakes and cookies all rep-\nresent convenience foods purchased for near-term\nconsumption. Therefore, their higher intake\namong adults with children is consistent with the\nabove time hypothesis. Why chocolate, a similar\nsnack food, did not also show a difference is un-\nclear. In addition, consumer studies have shown\nthat \"parents are 2 to 3 times more likely to name\ntheir child, not themselves, as the family expert for\nselection of fast food, snack foods, restaurants and\nparents believe that meal and grocery choices and\nrestaurant selection are influenced by their chil-\nTable 3.

Even if this is the case, providers still\nmay need to approach dietary counseling differ-\nently for adults with and without children in the\nhousehold.\nLimitations\nThis study's chief limitation is the inability to ac-\ncount for child variables such as the child's rela-\ntionship to the adult and child age. The presence of\nchildren in the home may have a stronger effect on\nparents who are directly responsible for feeding\ntheir children. Thus, this limitation would be ex-\npected to attenuate the strength of the association\nas this analysis includes nonparental adults living in\nhouseholds with children. If we could isolate par-\nents, we might find a stronger association.\nThe effect may also be different depending on\nthe age of the child. In particular, older children\nmay be more independent in their eating patterns\nand thus have less influence on adults' intake. In\naddition, it is possible that new parents may try to\nimprove the health of their diets, as has been ob-\nserved in one study regarding fruits and vegetable\nconsumption, but such improvements may prove\ndifficult to sustain.22 This analysis is also limited by\nthe availability of only one 24-hour dietary recall\nper individual and by the dataset's cross-sectional\nnature. Food frequency analysis was limited to\nquestions available in the NHANES dataset and\nsome groupings included options with variable fat\ncontent. Thus these findings must be interpreted\nwith some caution.\nAn additional limitation, in terms of implica-\ntions, is that the role of dietary fat in cardiovascular\ndisease prevention for older women has recently\ncome into question.23 Nevertheless, the influence\nof dietary fat and saturated fat on younger adults'\nweight status and cardiovascular health remains a\nmajor concern of physicians and public health of-\nficials alike.\nConclusion\nIn response to these findings, health care providers\nshould consider the potential influence of children\nin the home on adults dietary behaviors. Counsel-\ning on dietary change should be aimed at both\nadults and children in the home. Providers should\nemphasize that children should also be eating\nhealthy foods and that bringing less healthy foods\ninto the home for the children may also have a\nnegative impact on the adult's diet. Visits may in-\nclude discussion of how to improve a family's diet,\nsuch as identifying healthier options available ei-\nther as prepared foods or from restaurants and\nperhaps providing suggestions for quick, healthy\nrecipes. Discussions should also include strategies\nfor influencing and incorporating children's food\npreferences into a healthy diet.\nIn addition, parents should be encouraged to\nexpose their children to healthier foods and re-\nminded that the American Association of Pediatrics\nand American Heart Association recommend that\nchildren change to lower fat milk after the age of\n2.24 Cheese products, beef, snack food, and pizza\u00ad\nsources of additional fat intake for adults with chil-\ndren in the home in this national study\u00adcan be\ntargeted for better dietary control.\nIn addition, these findings suggest that food ad-\nvertising aimed at children may influence not only\nthe child's diet but also indirectly affect parents'\ndiets. Health care providers have the potential to\nimprove adults' dietary behaviors and influence\noverall family health by acknowledging and ad-\ndressing the reciprocal influences of adults' and\nchildren's dietary behaviors.\nWe acknowledge Amelia McCoy, MS RD, for help with con-\nfirming and identifying high-fat food choices within the food\nfrequency questionnaire.\nReferences\n1.
