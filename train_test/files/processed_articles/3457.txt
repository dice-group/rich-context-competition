There is an important role for\naldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptor activation in\nPlasma renin level and aldosterone\nto renin ratio are associated with\npresence of carotid plaques in\npatients with stable coronary\nartery disease\nMin-Yi Lee1,2 and Wen-Ter Lai3\n Keywords\nAldosterone, renin, aldosterone to renin ratio, carotid atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease\n1Graduate Institute of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung\nMedical University, Taiwan\n2Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung\nMunicipal Min-Sheng Hospital, Taiwan\n3Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung\nMedical University Hospital, Taiwan\nCorresponding author:\nWen-Ter Lai, Kaohsiung Medical University, 100 Shih-Chuan 1st Road,\nEmail: wtlai@cc.kmu.edu.tw\nOriginal Article\nthe induction of oxidative stress and inflammation leading\nto endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling dur-\ning activation of RAAS.10 Aldosterone is considered a key\nplayer in cellular processes underlying vascular hypertro-\nphy and fibrosis.11 Plasma aldosterone was an independ-\nent predictor of carotid plaque progression in patients\nwith cardiovascular risks.12 In patients with stable CAD,\nplasma aldosterone levels are independently associated\nwith the risk of major vascular events and vascular mor-\ntality and with atherosclerotic burden.13 There was an\ninverse relationship between plasma renin activity and\ncarotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and severity of\ncarotid artery lesions in patients with mild-to-moderate\nhypertension.14 However, high plasma aldosterone or\naldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) were found to be associ-\nated with impaired flow-mediated dilation and progres-\nsion of subclinical atherosclerosis in young to middle-aged\nHence, the association between RAAS and carotid\natherosclerosis and the evidence linking the RAAS with\ncentral and cerebral vascular atherosclerosis remains\ncontroversial. Therefore, we investigated the relation-\nships of plasma aldosterone and renin levels and ARR\nwith carotid IMT and plaque score in patients with angio-\ngraphically proven CAD.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy population\nA total of 111 patients with stable angina pectoris under-\ngoing coronary angiography were enrolled in this study.\nThe medical ethics committee of Kaohsiung Municipal\nMin-Sheng Hospital approved the study, and written\ninformed consent was obtained from all participants.\nSmoking status was classified as non-smoking, ex-\nsmoker (ceased smoking for at least one year) or current\nsmoker. Patients with Conn's disease, Addison's disease,\ncirrhosis of the liver or undergoing hormone replacement\ntherapy were excluded from the study. Clinical blood\npressure was measured before duplex ultrasound exami-\nnation with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer. The\nmeasurement of blood pressure followed the guidelines\noutlined by the American Heart Association Council on\nHigh Blood Pressure Research.16 The diagnosis of hyper-\ntension was based on multiple measurements on separate\noccasions over a period of time. The patients were seated\nwith their back supported and both feet lying flat on the\nfloor for at least five minutes in a quiet room, with an\nempty bladder. At least two measurements of blood pres-\nsure were taken each time, separated by at least one min-\nute. Blood pressure was measured by a mercury\nsphygmomanometer. Body mass index (BMI) was calcu-\nlated as weight (in kilograms) divided by height (in\nmeters) squared. We also measured serum levels of urea\nnitrogen, sodium, potassium, creatinine, glucose, total\ncholesterol, triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive\nprotein (hs-CRP), supine plasma renin and aldosterone\nlevels.\nMeasurements of carotid IMT and plaque\nscore\nDuplex ultrasonography of the left and right common\ncarotid arteries (CCAs) was performed with a 7.5-MHz\nlinear array transducer on a SONOS 5500 ultrasound sys-\ntem (Hewlett-Packard, Andover, MA, USA). All ultra-\nsound measurements were made by two experienced\nvascular technologists and images were recorded on digi-\ntal video discs for further analyses using previously\ndescribed methods.17,18 The distance between the lumen-\nintima interface and the media-adventitia interface of the\nnear and far walls of distal CCAs and bifurcations were\nmeasured. Carotid IMT was measured at eight points of\neach CCA and bifurcation and the mean value of all meas-\nurements of both left and right carotid arteries was calcu-\nlated. Thickened carotid IMT was defined as the mean\nvalue > 0.9 mm. Carotid plaque is defined as the presence\nof focal wall thickening that is at least 50% greater than\nthat of the surrounding vessel wall or as a focal region with\ncarotid IMT greater than 1.5 mm that protrudes into the\nlumen that is distinct from the adjacent boundary.19 Total\ncarotid plaque score was defined as the sum of the pres-\nence of plaques at the near and far walls of bilateral sides\nat three locations (CCA, carotid bifurcation and internal\ncarotid artery).\nCoronary angiographic evaluation\nCoronary angiography was performed by the Judkin's\nmethod. Two different scores were used to evaluate the\nangiographic severity and extension of CAD: the number\nof stenosed (>50% reduction of luminal diameter) or\noccluded vessels (one- to three-vessel disease), and the\ncomplexity and severity scoring method according to the\nSYNTAX score.20 Scoring of all coronary angiograms was\nperformed visually by a single experienced observer who\nwas blinded to clinical and laboratory data. The intraclass\ncorrelation coefficient for intra-rater reliability was 1.0\n(one- to three-vessel disease score), and 0.93 (tertiles of\nthe SYNTAX score).\nMeasurements of plasma renin and\naldosterone levels\nVenous blood was drawn (typically between 8 a.m. and\n9 a.m.) from each participant after he or she had been in a\nsupine position for five to 10 minutes. Plasma renin and\naldosterone concentrations were measured using radioim-\nmunoassay according to current guidelines in plasma\nsamples obtained with patients in the supine position, as\npreviously described.21 The coated tube radioimmu-\nnoassay kits for in vitro diagnostic use were manufactured\nby Diagnostic System Laboratories Inc (Webster, TX,\nUSA) and OBI-DSL (Cherwell Innovation Centre, Upper\nHeyford, Oxfordshire, UK) and used a highly specific\nrabbit antialdosterone and antirenin polyclonal antibody.\nCross-reactivity to closely related naturally occurring\nsteroids is negligible. For aldosterone, the normal range\nwas 35\u00ad300 pg/ml supine. For renin, the normal range\nwas 3.6\u00ad20 pg/ml supine. Plasma ARR was calculated as\naldosterone in pg/ml divided by renin in pg/ml.\nStatistical analysis\nResults are expressed as mean\u00b1SD, or as a percentage,\nwhen appropriate. We used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test\nto evaluate normal distribution. Differences between\ngroups were assessed either by the two-tailed Mann-\nWhitney test or by the Kruskal-Wallis test. In the univari-\nate analysis, unadjusted means were compared by one-way\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA). To analyze the relation-\nship between variables and carotid IMT and plaque score,\nunivariatelinearregressionanalysiswasused.Correlations\nbetween variables were analyzed by Spearman's correla-\ntion coefficient by rank. To predict the presence of CAD\npatients with carotid plaque or thickened IMT, logistic\nregression analysis (forced entry methods) was used.\nReceiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were\nconstructed to assess the best values of aldosterone, renin\nand ARR, optimizing sensitivity for the identification of\nthe presence of CAD patients with or without carotid\nplaque or thickened IMT. The area under the ROC curve\nand 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess the\npredictive power for the presence or absence of CAD\npatients with carotid plaque or thickened IMT. A two-\nsided probability value of p < 0.05 was considered to be\nstatistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed\nwith SPSS software (version Windows 18.0, SPSS Inc,\nChicago, IL, USA).\nResults\nPatient characteristics\nAmong all enrolled patients, 30 patients (27%, Group 1)\nhad normal coronary angiography, 32 (29%, Group 2) had\nCAD but without carotid plaque and 49 (44%, Group 3)\nhad CAD and at least one carotid plaque (Table 1). The\nprevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and smoking\nstatus was not different among these three groups. The\nmean age of Group 3 was older than Group 1 and 2 (p =\n0.013).

All sub-\njects had plasma aldosterone levels within the normal\nrange, except for one patient with aldosterone slightly\nabove the upper limit of the normal range. Nevertheless,\nplasma aldosterone levels were higher in Group 3 (Group\np = 0.288) but without statistical significance (Figure 1).\nHowever, plasma renin levels were significantly different\namong the three groups and were highest in Group 3\nARR was significantly lower in Group 3 than those in\nsodium levels were not significantly different among the\nthree groups (Table 1).\nFactors affecting carotid IMT and plaque score\nUnivariate analysis of clinical and biochemical factors\naffecting carotid IMT and carotid plaque score is shown in\nTable 2. Age, serum creatinine, plasma renin level,\nSYNTAX score and plaque score were found to be posi-\ntively correlated with carotid IMT. Age, serum creatinine,\nhs-CRP, plasma renin level and SYNTAX score were also\nfound to be positively correlated with carotid plaque score.\nHowever, ARR was inversely associated with carotid IMT\nand plaque score (Table 2).\nPredictors of CAD patients with carotid plaques\nand thickened carotid IMT\nAs shown in Table 3, the unadjusted and adjusted odds\nratios associated with the plasma renin levels for predic-\ntion of CAD patients with carotid plaques were 1.132 and\nand adjusted odds ratios associated with the ARR for pre-\ndiction of CAD patients with carotid plaques were 0.906\nin Table 4, the odds ratios associated with the plasma\nrenin levels and ARR for prediction of CAD patients with\nthickened carotid IMT were insignificant.

Our results demonstrated that plasma renin levels\nand ARR are independently associated with presence of\ncarotid plaques. In addition, hs-CRP is independently\nassociated with carotid IMT in CAD patients. These results\nindicated that plasma renin may have important effects on\nthe formation of carotid atherosclerosis in CAD patients,\nand plasma renin suppressed by aldosterone (higher ARR)\nmight be a relevant anti-atherogenic indicator in these\npatients. This study also disclosed that detection of carotid\nplaques is not infrequent in aged patients with stable CAD.\nCarotid plaques were present in 60% of CAD patients.\nThese patients had significantly higher hs-CRP and thicker\ncarotid IMT than the remaining patients with CAD. In\nthese patients with carotid plaques, plasma renin levels\nFigure 1.

A simple\nmodel to assess possible detrimental effects of aldosterone\non the vasculature is primary aldosteronism in which\npatients experienced more cardiovascular events than did\npatients with essential hypertension.24 Patients with pri-\nmary aldosteronism also have increased common carotid\nIMT compared to the patients with essential hyperten-\nsion.25 It is well known that aldosterone has direct effects\non the vasculature and has been associated with vascular\nsmooth muscle cell hypertrophy, endothelial dysfunction,\ncardiac fibrosis, proteinuria, and renal vascular injury.26\nClinical trials have proven the benefit of aldosterone\nreceptor antagonism. Treatments that block the pathologic\neffects of the RAAS at several points have been shown to\nlimit target-organ damage in hypertension and to decrease\nTable 2.

However, an observation\nstudy had showed that the overall prevalence of carotid\nartery lesions was not significantly different between\npatients with primary aldosteronism and primary hyper-\ntension.28 Although the studied population differed from\nour cohort, we have also showed that plasma aldosterone\nlevels are not significantly associated with carotid athero-\nsclerosis in this high-risk population.\nThe prognostic value of plasma renin for cardiovascu-\nlar events is also controversial. In a community-based\ncohort, renin, aldosterone and ARR were not associated\nwith all-cause mortality in hypertensive individuals.29\nHowever, plasma renin concentration is associated with\nan increased risk for cardiovascular events regardless of\nblood pressure according to a community-based cohort\nstudy.30 To date, studies focusing on the relationship\nbetween carotid atherosclerotic plaques and ARR are\nscarce. Only one study evaluating the association of vas-\ncular damage and ARR in hypertensive children was\nreported.31 The results showed that there was a positive\nassociation between carotid IMT and ARR but not serum\naldosterone concentration or plasma renin activity in\nhypertensive children. However, our results showed that\nARR was inversely associated with carotid IMT and\nTable 4.

AUC: area under the ROC curve; CI: confidence interval.\nplaque score, and plasma renin was positively associated\nwith carotid IMT and plaque score in CAD patients.\nCarotid IMT and plaque score are not related to plasma\naldosterone concentration. The associations between\nplasma renin and ARR and carotid IMT disappeared after\nadjustment of confounding factors (Table 4). The discrep-\nancy in these two studies can be explained by the\nextremely different selected populations. Moreover, sev-\neral studies have showed that the ultrasound assessment\nof carotid plaque, compared with that of carotid IMT, had\na higher diagnostic accuracy for the prediction of future\nischemic stroke and CAD events.32\u00ad35 Hence, plasma\nrenin level and ARR might have significant prognostic\nvalues in stable CAD patients. Carotid plaque was a\nstronger predictor of coronary events than IMT and is\nmore strongly associated with coronary stenosis than\nIMT.32,36 Carotid IMT is biologically distinct from carotid\nplaque, and from a pathological point of view, IMT is not\nreally atherosclerosis, but another phenotype.33,34\nThere were several limitations in the present study.\nFirst, we studied a relatively small group of consecutive\npatients who were referred for coronary angiography\nbecause of stable angina pectoris and suspected CAD.\nHence, the findings of our analyses in these CAD patients\nmay not be extrapolated to a broader population such as\npatients with acute coronary syndrome. Second, the mean\nage of our patients was relatively high. The prevalence of\nmulti-vessel CAD was much higher in advanced age, and\nthe extent of CAD was affected by the integration of coro-\nnary risk factors including age and other risk factors. These\nselection biases could mean that our findings regarding the\nrelationship between ARR and carotid plaque score are\nrelevant only to this specific group and may not be appli-\ncable to the general population.\nIn conclusion, escape of plasma renin from suppres-\nsion by relatively high plasma aldosterone levels repre-\nsented by high plasma renin and low ARR might be a\nmarker of structural vascular damage. This phenomenon\noccurs as a consequence of RAAS-mediated vascular\ninjury and pinpoints marked atherosclerosis in coronary\nand carotid arteries. Identification of high renin and low\nARR is important to identify patients with concomitant\nsevere CAD and carotid atherosclerosis. More research\nis needed to identify the determinants of carotid athero-\nsclerotic risk and to assess the best treatment strategy to\ndecrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in CAD\npatients.\n"
