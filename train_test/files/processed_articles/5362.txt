Uric acid is a metabolic end product\nof endogenous and exogenous purine\nmetabolism.5 With an improvement in\nliving standards and a change in diet com-\nposition, the levels of uric acid and the\nprevalence of hyperuricaemia can increase.6\nAccording a survey undertaken in China,\n10% of the total population has hyperur-\nicaemia, which accounts for around 120\nmillion people.7 The correlation between\nuric acid and acute ischaemic stroke is still\ndisputed.8,9 Few studies exist that have\ninvestigated the correlation between uric\nacid and acute ischaemic stroke.6 The aim\nof this present study was to investigate the\npossible correlation between uric acid levels\nand LA in a Chinese population.\nPatients and methods\nStudy patients\nThis cross-sectional study consecutively\nenrolled patients who presented with some\nneurological discomfort (e.g. dizziness, head-\nache, mild cognitive impairment) at the fol-\nQuanzhou First Hospital, Quanzhou, Fujian\nProvince, China; Department of Neurology,\nHospital of Jinjiang City, Jinjiang, Fujian\nProvince, China; and Department of\nNeurology, Second Affiliated Hospital of\nFujian Medical University, Quanzhou,\nFujian Province, China.

Patients or their family\nmembers provided written informed\nconsent.\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nAll patients underwent an MRI examin-\nation, including axial T1-weighted images,\nT2-weighted images, fluid-attenuated inver-\nsion recovery images and diffusion-weighted\nimages using a GYROSCAN ACS-NT\nscanner (magnetic field intensity was 1.5 T,\nslice thickness 5 mm, interslice gap 0.5 mm;\nPhilips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands).\nAll images were read by two neuroimaging\nexperts (Y.H.H. and R.W.C.).\nLeukoaraiosis was diagnosed according to\npreviously published criteria.1 All patients\nexamined by MRI were subdivided into an\nLA group and a non-LA group.\n76 Journal of International Medical Research 45(1)\nClinical data collection\nWhen the patients attended the hospital,\ntheir complete medical history was taken.\nThe routine clinical data from all patients\nenrolled in the study, including sex, age,\nsmoking status, alcohol consumption,\nhypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary\nartery disease (CAD), fasting blood glucose,\nglobulin, albumin, cholesterol, low-density\nlipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C),\ntriglycerides, apolipoprotein-A, apolipopro-\ntein-B, homocysteine, platelet count, haem-\natocrit, fibrinogen, D-dimer and uric acid\nwere collected from the hospital databases\nusing a unified questionnaire. The biochem-\nical and haematological parameters were\nanalysed using a Beckman AU680\nChemistry System and a Beckman LH 780\nhaematology analyser according to the\nmanufacturer's instructions (Beckman\nCoulter, Brea, CA, USA).\nThe presence of atherosclerotic risk fac-\ntors was standardized as follows: (i) hyper-\ntension was recorded when systolic blood\npressure ! 140 mmHg and/or diastolic\nblood pressure ! 90 mmHg more than three\ntimes during the 7 days after a stroke on\ndifferent days or a history of physician-\ndiagnosed hypertension and/or taking\nantihypertensive medication; (ii) diabetes\nmellitus was recorded when there were\nsymptoms (e.g. excessive thirst, frequent or\nincreased urination, especially at night;\nexcessive hunger; fatigue; blurred vision;\nsores or cuts that won't heal; and\nweight loss) of diabetes plus a random\nblood glucose !11.1 mmol/l, or when there\nwere symptoms of diabetes plus a fasting\nblood glucose !7.0 mmol/l, or when there\nwere symptoms of diabetes plus a blood\nglucose tolerance test, or a history of dia-\nbetes mellitus; (iii) CAD when there was a\nhistory of CAD, or CT angiography or\ndigital subtraction angiography evidence of\ncoronary artery stenosis degree !50%,\nor typical angina pectoris or myocardial\nischaemic changes proven by electrocardio-\ngram; (iv) a history of smoking was con-\nsidered if >10 cigarettes had been smoked\nper day for >5 years; (v) a history of alcohol\nconsumption was considered if the patient\nyears.\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nthe SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version 17.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. Data are presented as\nmean \u00c6 SD, mean \u00c6 SE or n of patients\n(%) as appropriate. Comparisons across\ngroups were examined using the 2-test for\ncategorical variables and Student's t-test or\none-way analysis of variance followed by the\nTukey's b test for multiple comparisons of\ncontinuous variables. A multivariate logistic\nregression analysis was performed to find\nthe independent predictor of LA. A P-value\n< 0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nOf the 268 patients who were enrolled in the\nstudy, the 164 patients with LA (LA group)\n104 patients without LA (non-LA group)\nTable 1 presents the demographic and clin-\nical characteristics of the two groups.

The multivariate logistic regression\nanalysis demonstrated that uric acid, homo-\ncysteine, hypertension, age, diabetes mellitus\nand albumin were independently associated\nwith the presence of LA (Table 2).\nDiscussion\nIt is widely acknowledged that LA is one\ntype of presentation of small cerebrovascu-\nlar disease.11 The continuous development\nand wide application of neuroimaging has\nresulted in ever increasing rates of detection\nTable 1.

This\nresult might have been caused by the small\nsample size and the cross-sectional nature of\nthe study. The results suggest that larger\nprospective studies are needed to confirm\nthese preliminary findings.\nThis present study had several limita-\ntions. First, it was a cross-sectional study.\nTable 2.

Thirdly, other risk factors for\nLA may exist that were not examined in this\npresent study.\nIn conclusion, this present study identi-\nfied hyperuricaemia as a risk factor for LA\nin Chinese patients.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
