    "abstract": "Abstract\nAlthough narcissism has long been researched in relation to anger, previous research examined narcissistic anger toward\nnegative feedback that had already occurred. In this study, we investigated the effects of anticipation of evaluation (present\nvs. absent) and negative feedback (present vs. absent), using a creativity task paradigm, on state anger scores among 231 U.S.\nundergraduates (76% White, 60% women). We also measured undergraduates' narcissistic tendencies and impressions of\nthe creativity task. Multiple regression analyses revealed a significant interaction between narcissism and negative feedback\non total anger scores, with narcissists responding with more anger than non-narcissists in the condition of negative feedback.\nWe also found a significant two-way interaction between narcissism and anticipation of evaluation on total enjoyment scores.\nAnticipation of feedback inhibited narcissist-prone individuals from enjoying the task in the anticipation condition, but this\npattern was not present in the no-anticipation condition. Implications and recommendations to better understand the nature\nof narcissism are discussed.\n",

We examined the effects of antici-\npated negative feedback on narcissistic anger in a nonclinical\nsample of U.S. college students to test experimentally for the\nfirst time the \"paradox of narcissism\" theory developed by\nElliot and Thrash (2001). They argue that narcissistic competi-\ntiveness includes a desire to both gain mastery of the task and\nto perform better than others, which implies the need to achieve.\nNarcissistic tendencies may be defined as a personality\ntype characterized by a high and unstable self-esteem (cf.\nBaumeister, Smart, & Boden, 1996). Although narcissism\noverlaps with self-esteem in its definition, narcissism has\ntwo distinctive characteristics that are not formally associ-\nated with the concept of self-esteem: competitiveness (Elliot\n(American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Raskin, Novacek,\nsism involves maintaining high self-esteem by constant com-\nparison with others. Non-narcissists with high self-esteem\nare able to think of their self-worth as measured on an abso-\nlute scale, without comparing their performance with others'\nperformance. In contrast, narcissists are only satisfied when\nthey outperform others or are given lavish praise by their\nadmirers.\nNarcissism and Anger\nIn their original \"threatened egotism model,\" Baumeister\net al. (1996) explained that there is a dark side of high self-\nesteem. They also consider the case of high but unstable self-\nesteem, which is one aspect of narcissism (cf. Baumeister,\nBarclay, 1989). According to their model, when those with\nhigh and unstable self-esteem receive negative evaluations, a\nperceived threat (i.e., \"threatened egotism\") emerges because\ntheir inflated but uncertain self-worth has already been dero-\ngated or may be derogated in the future. Consequently, they\nattempt to reestablish and maintain a favorable view of self\nby rejecting all negative feedback. This process involves a\nnegative emotion (i.e., anger) toward the source of the threat\n(i.e., negative feedback) and leads people with high/unstable\nself-esteem to express their anger in the form of aggression.\nThus, anger can be provoked when narcissists' aggran-\ndized, but fragile self-worth, is threatened by negative\n1Nagoya University, Japan\n2Illinois State University, Normal, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nAkiko Matsuo, Department of Psychology, Nagoya University, B4-1 (780)\nEmail: matsuo.akiko@k.mbox.nagoya-u.ac.jp\nThe Effects of Anticipated Negative\nFeedback on Psychological States\nAmong Narcissists\nAkiko Matsuo1 and Eros R. DeSouza2\n Keywords\nnarcissism, anger, gender differences\n2 SAGE Open\nfeedback from others. In addition, anger is not only a\nresponse to threatened self-esteem but also a means of\nregaining and retaining one's sense of superiority. That is,\nanger and aggressive behavior often function as a symbolic\ndominance over others (Baumeister et al., 1996).\nParadox in Narcissists and Unexplored\nAreas\nAlthough previous researchers have investigated the under-\nlying cognitive processes in narcissism, they discuss just one\nside of narcissists' competitiveness and the need for admira-\ntion, which is their active involvement in competition and\ninteractions with others to flaunt their superiority over them.\nRegarding this notion, Elliot and Thrash (2001) pointed\nout the \"paradox of narcissism.\" Thus, poor performance\nmay result in negative feedback from others or lowering self-\nesteem, but narcissists must actively get involved in compe-\ntition because that is the only way to maintain their\nself-esteem. Elliot and Thrash refer to the paradox of narcis-\nsism as the \"fear of failure,\" in which narcissists compete to\nvalidate their ideal self, but simultaneously fear negative\nfeedback. Therefore, to protect their self-esteem from possi-\nble threats, narcissists become sensitive to feedback-related\nsituations, which results in fragile high/unstable self-esteem.\nWhen narcissists perceive a situation as an ego-threatening\nevent, they feel distressed and may become angry even\nbefore the actual feedback is provided (cf. Barry, Chaplin, &\nsists anticipate that they might not perform well even when\nfailure has not actually happened, they are frustrated and\nmay become angry. This anger stems from narcissists'notion\nthat they are afraid of failure and want to reject all actual and\npossible events that may cause a reduction in self-esteem.\nHowever, scant research has been done about the para-\ndoxical characteristic (i.e., \"fear of failure\") in narcissists in\nrelation to anger. The existing literature has focused only on\nthe performance-based threat that has already happened. In\naddition to emphasizing private events (i.e., one's perfor-\nmance) alone, most of the literature has only manipulated the\npositive or negative feedback condition and focused on the\noutcome of the feedback brought by others (e.g., Barry et al.,\nSporer, 2002). This methodology lacks the perspective of the\n\"fear of failure\" that accompanies anticipation of negative\nresults. It also lacks variation in experimental conditions,\nbecause it is based on the anger effect elicited by feedback\nthat has already been given. However, narcissistic anger,\nwhich is an expression of \"fear of failure,\" should also be\nobserved before actual feedback is given.\nThe anticipation of negative feedback can possibly elicit\nnarcissists'anger by the frustration that stems from perceived\ninternal threat when they judge they are unlikely to surpass\nothers in a given task.\nIt is possible that they would become angry just by the\nanticipation of negative evaluation, which would evoke as\nstrong reaction as actual negative evaluation about their per-\nformance. If narcissists' anger might come just from antici-\npation, it might potentially be directed at anyone around\nthem, not just the individuals who would give them negative\nevaluation. The anticipation-based anger would then possi-\nbly hurt narcissists' interpersonal relationships because oth-\ners would be unwilling to interact with narcissists whose\nanger would appear to happen for no good reason.\nConsequently, others would be unwilling to interact with\nnarcissists.\nGender is also an understudied area in the narcissism\u00ad\nanger link, although some previous research suggested the\nimportance of taking gender differences into consideration.\nAccording to the American Psychiatric Association (2013),\nup to 75% of those diagnosed with narcissistic personality\ndisorder are men. The literature on narcissism indicates that\nmen tend to show more narcissistic characteristics than\nwomen as ways to control the situation, dominate others, and\nRichman & Flaherty, 1990), which are congruent with tradi-\ntional male gender roles. Also, narcissists' affective states\nabout a task depended on participants' gender in relative\nevaluation situations (Morf, Weir, & Davidov, 2000). Morf\net al. (2000) found that male narcissists experienced more\nenjoyment and positive emotions in the conditions where\nperformance evaluation was implied, but this pattern was not\nfound among female narcissists, using a college student sam-\nple scoring in the top and bottom third score range on the\nNarcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI; Raskin & Hall,\nFew studies examined gender differences regarding nar-\ncissism and anger, which is of interest to us. For example,\nHibino, Yukawa, Kodama, and Yoshida (2005) examined\nnarcissism as one of the possible variables involving anger\nexpression in a Japanese junior high school student sample.\nIn a class period, participants voluntarily answered a retro-\nspective questionnaire on an anger-triggering event. They\nfound that a narcissistic characteristic (excessive need for\nadmiration) took different paths to aggressive behavior by\ngender. For boys, the link was straightforward; excessive\nneed for admiration led to anger, which motivated them to\nengage in aggressive behavior (e.g., revenge on the person\nwho caused the event, complaint about the event to others,\nand displacement of anger toward objects). However, girls'\nexcessive need for admiration led to a cognitive process\nthat emphasized their victimhood, which motivated them to\nact aggressively. That is, unlike boys, girls tended to over-\nestimate the seriousness of an anger-triggering event; they\nperceived being treated poorly, resulting in aggressive\nbehavior.\nIn addition, Barry et al. (2006) found a strong positive\nrelationship between narcissism and expressed aggression,\nwith men showing this trend more strongly than women in a\nMatsuo and DeSouza 3\ncollege student sample. Similarly, Thomaes, Stegge, Olthof,\nBushman, and Nezlek (2011) found that male, but not female,\nnarcissists expressed anger when humiliated in Study 2.\nThus, men and women express anger differently.\nConcerning violence (i.e., a more serious form of express-\ning aggression) in heterosexual dating relationships, Ryan,\nWeikel, and Sprechini (2008) found that significant relation-\nships between college students' scores on physical assault/\nsexual coercion and three subcategories of narcissism (i.e.,\novert narcissism, covert narcissism, and sexual narcissism)\ndepended on gender; only men showed significant correla-\ntions between covert narcissism and physical assault and\nbetween sexual narcissism and sexual coercion.\nConsidering that narcissists desire to participate in com-\npetition and expected to win, the investigation of narcissists'\npsychological states about such competition is also of inter-\nest to us. Some previous work found that narcissism is related\nto positive psychological states (e.g., enjoyment) and nega-\ntive ones (e.g., fear) simultaneously (Rose, 2002; see also\nWink, 1991). Narcissists think positively about their own\nperformance (albeit unrealistically). However, they are also\nnervous about their performance and damaging their self-\nimage, which causes them to be vulnerable to threat. These\nconflicting psychological states should be observed when\nasked about the task they have engaged in. It is possible that\nthey feel negative about the task itself (that brought unfavor-\nable feedback) because the task is the source of their frustra-\ntion. Their negative internal states would be a contributor to\nsupport narcissists' \"fear of failure.\"\nThe Current Study\nWe experimentally tested the narcissistic paradox of \"fear of\nfailure.\" Along with anger and gender, we also examined\nenjoyment, interest, and boredom. We argue that anticipation\nof negative feedback from others activates narcissists'\nambivalent attitudes (i.e., activating both their participation\nin a task and their reluctance to engage in it due to fear of\nfailure). Narcissists are not intrinsically motivated to engage\nin the task (cf. Morf et al., 2000); therefore, they would not\nenjoy it.\nLikewise, because they cannot accept anything that casts\ndoubt on their superiority, they would not find the task inter-\nesting when evaluation is announced beforehand. Then, in\nthe case of anticipated outcomes, to protect their self-esteem,\nwe expect narcissists to view the task as unenjoyable.\nBased on the extant literature and the rationale above, we\npropose the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1: College students who score high on narcis-\nsistic tendencies will respond to anticipated negative\nfeedback with more anger than college students who score\nlow on narcissistic tendencies,\nHypothesis 2: Those who score high on narcissistic ten-\ndencies will also respond to actual negative feedback with\nmore anger than those who score low on narcissistic\ntendencies,\nHypothesis 3: Male narcissists will show the above pat-\nterns more strongly than female narcissists, and\nHypothesis 4: Narcissists will enjoy the assigned task\nless (i.e., show less interest and more boredom) than non-\nnarcissists when they anticipate being evaluated.\nMethod\nParticipants\ngraduates enrolled in general education classes at a large\nU.S. Midwestern public university with a mean age of 19.36\nyears (SD = 1.76). The majority of participants self-reported\nThere was no financial compensation given, but students\nwere offered the opportunity to earn extra credit points for\ntheir participation.\nMeasures and Task\nNPI.Originally constructed as a 54-item scale aiming at\nmeasuring one's narcissistic tendency, the NPI is composed\nof sentences that are answered in a \"yes\" (coded 1) and \"no\"\n(coded 0) format. Responses are summed to create a narcis-\nsistic tendency score. Higher scores indicate higher levels of\nnarcissism. A sample item includes, \"I have a natural talent\ninstruments that are designed to measure pathological narcis-\nsism, the NPI identifies individual differences in narcissistic\ntendencies in a nonclinical population (cf. Emmons, 1984;\nstrong correlation between the 40-item NPI with its 54-item\nCronbach's alpha coefficient of .80 with a sample of college\nstudents for the 40-item NPI. We used the 40-item short ver-\nsion of the NPI in the current study, which had a Cronbach's\nState-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI).We used the\nis rated on a Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (not at all/\nalmost never) to 4 (very much/almost always). Responses are\nsummed, with higher scores indicating higher levels of anger.\nA sample item includes, \"I feel like hitting something.\"\nUsing a college sample, Fuqua et al. (1991) reported an alpha\nof .91 for the State Anger subscale. In our study, the Cron-\nbach's alpha coefficient for the STAXI was .88.\nCreativity test. The \"Lange-Elliot Creativity Test\" asks partici-\npants to come up with as many uses as possible for a brick\n(Part 1) and a candle (Part 2), and each of the two task lasts\nabout 5 min (Sedikides, Campbell, Reeder, & Elliot, 1998). In\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 1. Means and Standard Deviations of the Total Rating\nScores on NPI and STAXI.\nGender M SD n\nNPI\nSTAXI\nNote. Higher scores indicate greater provocation of anger. NPI =\nNarcissistic Personality Inventory; STAXI = State-Trait Anger Expression\nInventory.\nthe current study, we only used Part 1 (i.e., uses of a brick) for\nthe sake of time. In the feedback-anticipating conditions, there\nwas a clear statement regarding feedback. Although partici-\npants were led to believe that this creativity test was an estab-\nlished measure of one's creativity level, this bogus test served\nas an unfamiliar task without practice, which was new to every-\none and seemed rather difficult (i.e., threat for narcissists).\nImpressions of the task.Based on Sedikides et al.'s (1998)\nstudy, we asked participants three questions about their\nimpressions of the task: (a) How much they enjoyed the cre-\nativity task, (b) how interesting it was, and (c) how boring it\nwas. They rated each question on a 4-point, Likert-type scale\nthat ranged from 1 (not at all/almost never) to 4 (very much/\nalmost always). We summed their scores (the boring item\nwas reverse-scored), creating a total enjoyment index score\nExperimental Manipulations\nThere were four experimental conditions: feedback-anticipation/\nnegative feedback given, feedback anticipation/no negative\nfeedback given, no anticipation/negative feedback given, and\nno anticipation/no negative feedback given. In all conditions\nand before the creativity task began, participants were informed\nthat the experimenter had already obtained reliable norms con-\ncerning the task at 130 students from the same university and\nhad found a strong relationship between high scores on the task\nand high IQ level (i.e., intelligent students did well on the task).\nThis cover story was intended to give participants a good\nopportunity to show evidence of their intellectual ability and\nalso to stimulate their competitive motivation. The experi-\nmenter added that they were now collecting more data.\nIn the feedback-anticipating condition, at the time the\ndirections of the task was given (i.e., before the task), partici-\npants were told that they would receive the evaluation of\ntheir performance after the task in the form of percentile\nrank. The instructions for the no-anticipation condition did\nnot include any possibility of feedback.\nConcerning actual feedback, after the creativity task, par-\nticipants in the no-negative feedback condition received\nnothing, whereas participants in the negative feedback con-\ndition received a bogus performance evaluation sheet, which\nindicated that they performed poorly on the task and clearly\nshowing that their score was on the 31st percentile (signifi-\ncantly below the norm). The experimenter also verbally told\nthem that they did poorly on the task.\nProcedure\nAll participants in each session (one to two same-sex stu-\ndents) were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions.\nThe participants signed the consent form and completed the\ndemographic questionnaire and the NPI in the same room.\nAfter that, we took each participant to a separate room\nwhere he or she worked individually on the creativity task\nwith the manipulations described earlier. Next, participants\nresponded to the 10-item State Anger subscale that was\nembedded randomly with other items that asked about\nenjoyment, interest, and boredom about the creativity task\nOn completion, all participants were thoroughly debriefed,\nemphasizing that the feedback sheet was created to make the\nperformance appear negative, and performance was not actu-\nally evaluated. They were told that the experimenters would\nexamine participants'reactions to the task after some were led\nto believe that they had performed poorly. Also, participants\nwere told that the task they performed was not a legitimate test\nof creativity and that confidentiality would be kept at all times.\nResults\nSix participants were excluded from the data analysis because\nthree were suspicious about the true purpose of this study,\ntwo did not follow the directions on the creativity task, and\none had a session that was seriously interrupted by another\nparticipant who arrived late, reducing the data set from 237\nto 231. Of these, 57 participants were assigned to the antici-\npation/no-negative feedback condition, 59 to the anticipa-\ntion/negative feedback condition, 58 to the no anticipation/\nno-negative feedback condition, and 57 were to the no antici-\npation/negative feedback condition. Table 1 shows the means\nand standard deviations for the total rating scores by gender.\nThree multiple regression analyses were performed after\ncentering, with each condition of anticipation/no anticipa-\ntion, negative feedback/no negative feedback, and man/\nwoman dummy coded. We conducted separate analyses\nfocusing on negative feedback and anticipation because such\ninvestigation would show the clearest effects. Concerning\nthe first analysis, the top half of Table 2 shows significant\nmain effects of the total NPI score and negative feedback.\nThe interaction of negative feedback and the total NPI score\nwas also significant; the interaction of negative feedback\nwith gender was not significant; last, three-way interaction\nMatsuo and DeSouza 5\nwas not significant. A simple slope test revealed that non-\nnarcissists experienced significantly greater anger when neg-\native feedback was given than when the feedback was not\npresented, but no difference was observed for narcissist\nabout the level of anger between no-negative feedback con-\ndition and actual-negative feedback condition. For the antici-\npation condition (see bottom half of Table 2), we did not find\nany significant main effects, two-way interactions, or three-\nway interaction on the total anger score.\nThese results supported Hypothesis 2, with narcissists\nhaving higher anger scores than non-narcissists in the actual-\nnegative feedback condition. However, Hypothesis 1 (antici-\npation of negative feedback) and Hypothesis 3 (gender\ndifferences) were not supported.\nFinally, we ran a separate multiple regression analysis\n(after centering) with the total NPI score anticipation, and\ntheir interaction as predictors and the total enjoyment score\nas criterion variable. Table 3 shows that the interaction of the\ntotal NPI score and anticipation was statistically significant,\nsupporting Hypothesis 4. That is, high NPI scorers reported\nfeeling less enjoyment in the task when they were informed\nthat they would be given feedback (anticipation condition)\nthan low NPI scorers. However, this pattern was not present\nin the case of the no-anticipation condition.\nA series of post hoc power analyses were conducted using\nthe software package, G*Power (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &\nfound the observed power for the effects of the first analysis\nabout negative feedback, the second about anticipation, and\nthe third about enjoyment were .97, above .99, and above\nDiscussion\nWe found that narcissists'anger was provoked by actual neg-\native feedback about their performance on the creativity task,\nwhich is in keeping with previous studies (e.g., Barry et al.,\ndid not find support for the anticipation of feedback hypoth-\nesis. We speculate that having told all participants that the\ncreativity task was valid and was related to intelligence may\nhave prompted some anticipation of evaluation or judgment\nin all four conditions; in addition, presumably the experi-\nmenter would know the \"results\" of the creativity task for\neach participant regardless of feedback given. Future studies\nshould ask participants how much they anticipated feedback\nand how negative the feedback was to them to ensure that\nsuch manipulations are indeed relevant to our participants.\nIt is also feasible that our fear of failure model may need\nto be modified, as third variable(s) may be acting as media-\ntors or moderators, affecting the narcissism\u00adanger relation-\nship. For example, Stucke and Sporer (2002) indicated that\nself-concept clarity is an important factor in considering pos-\nsible interactions between narcissism and performance feed-\nback on anger expression.\nOur study still contributes to the literature because it\nrevealed that anticipation of being evaluated affected partici-\npants' reactions to the task, suggesting that narcissist-prone\nindividuals were sensitive to the situation and showed their\npsychological states differently from non-narcissist-prone\nindividuals. It is noteworthy that anticipation of evaluation\nprevented narcissist-prone individuals from enjoying the cre-\nativity task. We speculate that this pattern reflects narcissists'\ninner ambivalence between active participation in a competi-\ntive situation to validate their greatness and reluctance to\nengage in an unfamiliar task that might cause failure. When\nnarcissists feel bored about a task and do not enjoy it, they\nmay be actually reluctant to engage in it because they do not\nwant to experience unwanted outcomes (i.e., fear of failure).\nHowever, they need to get involved in the competitive situa-\ntion anyway because of their desire to obtain admiration from\nothers. As discussed earlier, narcissism features competitive\nmotivation and need for admiration. These two characteristics\ncould result from their tendency to participate actively, which\nis one aspect of narcissism. Furthermore, narcissists want to\nbe in the public eye and involve themselves in competitive\nTable 2.

No current theory predicts our findings on\nanticipation of negative feedback, but our attempt was at\nleast a good starting point to examine unexplored areas of\nnarcissism. That is, our findings captured narcissists'impres-\nsion of a task before, not after, receiving feedback about the\ntask. As the previous research (e.g., Morf et al., 2000;\nRhodewalt & Morf, 1998) focused on the psychological\nstates caused by performance feedback (i.e., after feedback),\nthe current study did cast light on a possible cognitive pro-\ncess when narcissists are waiting for feedback.\nNarcissists are often described as having such confidence\nabout their competency that they eagerly participate in com-\npetitive situations (cf. Morf et al., 2000). Yet, the current find-\nings suggest that they do not enjoy these situations because of\nupcoming feedback. Together with the psychological unsta-\nbleness of narcissists' self-esteem, their inner ambivalence\nbetween the undesirable self (possibly performing poorly)\nand their desire to do better than others emerge when they\nanticipate evaluation. Narcissists'derogation of the task could\nbe a manifestation of their ambivalence between taking\nadvantage of competitions (approach) and avoiding such\nopportunities for the purpose of protecting their self-esteem.\nWe recommend that future studies examine the \"paradox\nof narcissism\" by experimentally manipulating approach\n(e.g., desire to show off one's abilities) and avoidance (e.g.,\nfear of anticipating/receiving negative feedback) conditions\nseparately, and possibly showing their simultaneous activa-\ntion. It might also be helpful to test whether the effect of\nfeedback anticipation on anger by manipulating how many\npeople would know the results of the creativity task (e.g., just\nthe experimenter, as was the case in the current study, vs.\nmany individuals, such as other research participants or con-\nfederates) and to include self-concept clarity (Stucke &\nSporer, 2002) as a possible mediator/moderator.\nAlthough the current study did not find evidence of sig-\nnificant gender differences concerning the narcissism\u00adanger\nlink, future research should continue to examine the disposi-\ntional aspect of narcissism by gender. According to Morf and\nRhodewalt (2001), it is possible that narcissists try to achieve\ntheir goals in different and unique ways suitable to their gen-\nder roles. In the United States, hegemonic masculinity rein-\nforces success, power, and competition, which have been\nlinked to aggression and violence (Crowther, Goodson,\nMcGuire, & Dickson, 2013), whereas \"emphasized feminin-\nity\" reinforces feminine submissiveness (DeSouza, 2013).\nFollowing such gender roles, narcissistic characteristic(s) and\nexpressiveness of anger may be different for women and men\n(Ryan et al., 2008), especially in Latin countries where\nmachismo and marianismo (emphasized femininity) seem to\nbe even stronger than in NorthAmerica (Baldwin & DeSouza,\n2001). Thus, gender differences may be pronounced in more\ntraditional cultures than in more egalitarian cultures such as\nin Scandinavia. We recommend a cross-cultural investigation\nto test for gender differences in the narcissism\u00adanger link.\nConclusion\nOur study provided theoretical insights into personality psy-\nchological science by identifying variables in narcissism that\nwere affected by anticipation of negative feedback. Narcissists\nare situation-sensitive; their unexpected anger and reactions\n(witnessed by other people) are likely to have negative effects\non their engagement in tasks, actual achievement, and inter-\npersonal relationships. Narcissists' sensitivity to their social\nworlds (i.e., reactions about their performance from others)\noriginally comes from the paradoxical concept they bear--\nthey want to be superior to others, but they are worried about\npossible negative feedback. Their self-evaluation derives not\nfrom themselves, but from their environment, which results in\nhigh/unstable self-esteem. As Morf and Rhodewalt (2001)\ndiscussed, narcissism should be viewed as a self-regulatory\nprocessing system with paradoxical features.\nFuture research on narcissism should be interwoven with\nother self-related concepts and attitudes toward the external\nworld in cognitive processes working for establishing narcis-\nsists'self-understanding and their interpersonal relationships\nto better understand the complicated mechanisms of narcis-\nsism and its dynamism.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.
