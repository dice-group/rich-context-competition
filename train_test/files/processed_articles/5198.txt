    "abstract": "Abstract\nJournalists play an important role in the formation of public opinion and can therefore\nbe regarded as influential actors in conflict resolution. In Colombia, where the peace\nprocess remains a highly debated issue, the media are assumed to fuel polarization\ninstead of dialogue. Indeed, deep societal divisions have been unveiled during last year's\nplebiscite. In this environment, the concept of Peace Journalism has gained popularity\namong journalists, as it may promote a more nuanced debate. Against this backdrop,\nthis study explores the role perceptions of Colombian journalists and their compatibility\nwith the premises of Peace Journalism. To provide in-depth insights into journalists' role\nconceptions, 16 semi-structured interviews with Colombian journalists were conducted.\nThe results indicate that journalists hold a very active stance and want to influence and\nengage the public with their work, closely identifying with the role of the public mobilizer.\n",

Because vari-\nous armed groups are moving into the vacuum that the demobilization of the FARC cre-\nated, violence surges in parts of the country (El Espectador, 2018; Semana, 2018).\nMeanwhile, Colombia remains polarized concerning the question of how to move for-\nward \u00ad for example, with regards to transitional justice (Restrepo and Ram\u00edrez, 2016).\nThe media play a paramount role in the formation of public opinion regarding peace\nbuilding processes. In the Colombian context, the coverage of the conflict has been criti-\ncized for fuelling polarization instead of fostering peace (e.g. Garc\u00eda-Marrugo, 2013).\nAlthough journalists are assumed to play a key role in the framing of peace and conflict,\nlittle is known about how Colombian journalists themselves experience their role in\npeace building. The way journalists perceive their role has been shown to have a substan-\ntial impact on their production of media content (e.g. Bartholom\u00e9 et al., 2015). Against\nthis backdrop, in-depth qualitative interviews with Colombian journalists were con-\nducted to better understand journalistic role perceptions in the midst of the Colombian\npeace process.\nThe Colombian conflict involves many different actors, fighting over influence and\naccess to resources. In the absence of state control in many rural regions, right-wing\narmed groups have been formed to counter the resistance of the left-wing guerrilla. In\naddition, criminal groups, primarily interested in illicit trade, play a central role in the\nconflict. The state itself spurred the violence further, for example, in the scandal of the\n`falsos positivos'. In this setting, civilians were killed and presented as fallen guerrilla to\nfake war victories (Verdad Abierta, 2015). In the course of the conflict, 7.3 million peo-\nple were internally displaced and around 220.000 lost their lives (Felter and Renwick,\n2017; UNHCR, 2017). The peace process, started under president Juan Manuel Santos,\nhas mainly been about the treaty with the FARC, the country's largest guerrilla group.\nOn 7 August 2018, Iv\u00e1n Duque from the right-wing party Centro Democr\u00e1tico was\nelected as the new president. During the election campaign, Duque called for changes to\nthe peace accord, which critics fear might threaten the already unstable process. Yet, it\nremains to be seen how these changes can contribute to his promise to fight the polariza-\ntion of the country (Manetto, 2018). Meanwhile, public opinion about the peace process\ncontinues to be surrounded by a fierce debate (Universidad de los Andes, 2018). These\ndevelopments have created a sensitive work environment for journalists. In addition,\nespecially journalists living in rural areas are affected by the conflict, and consequen-\ntially face serious security threats (FLIP, 2018). Furthermore, the working atmosphere is\ninfluenced, confined and convoluted by the interests and agendas of media organiza-\ntions. Prominent media organizations, such as the two main TV stations Caracol and\nRCN or the newspapers El Tiempo and El Espectador, communicate strong views on the\npeace process. In this context of organizational constraints, it is important to understand\nhow journalists interpret and negotiate their role in covering the Colombian peace\nnegotiations.\nOne approach that received attention in Colombia is the concept of Peace Journalism,\nwhich can be distinguished from dominant ways of news reporting in its focus on\nPrager and Hameleers 3\nbackgrounds and the context and causes of conflict. Peace journalism focuses less on\nsocietal elites (Lynch and McGoldrick, 2012). However, this proposed style of reporting\nhas been criticized for crossing the line to advocacy and opposes the notion of objective\njournalism \u00ad which also touches upon recent developments and accusations of `fake\nnews' (Van Aelst et al., 2017). In addition, critics highlight that the concept of peace\njournalism is not compatible with journalistic working practices that emphasize conflict\nas a key news value (e.g. Bartholom\u00e9 et al., 2015).\nIn this setting, the results of this study confirm and extend the principles of Peace\nJournalism. However, none of the interviewed journalists evaluated the work of the\nnational media in positive terms. Their opinions of the local media were more positive.\nHowever, at the local level, the topic of self-censorship is a highly relevant one due to\nsecurity concerns (FLIP, 2018). The findings of this research provide insights into the\nperception of journalistic agency in the context of Peace Journalism. By demonstrating\nhow journalists renegotiate their role in the face of conflict, this study contributes to our\nunderstanding of the influence of journalists on the framing of heated societal debates.\nJournalistic role perceptions\nJournalistic roles describe what obligations and responsibilities journalists ascribe to their\nown job and how they see their relationship with the public, as well as with politics and\nbusinesses (Donsbach, 2008; Van Dalen et al., 2012). Four role conceptions suggested by\nCassidy (2005) can be used to describe the most central roles of journalists. These are as\nfollows: the disseminator, the interpreter, the adversary and the public mobilizer. The\ndisseminator sees his or her role as simply distributing information quickly, while avoid-\ning unverifiable facts. The interpreter sees as a prior task to investigate claims of officials,\nto analyse complicated matters and to talk about national policy. The adversarial scruti-\nnizes the actions of public officials as well as of other influential actors. In this study, the\ninterpreter and the adversarial will be incorporated into one role conception, namely the\nwatchdog, as conceptualized by Skovsgaard et al. (2013). The public mobilizer empha-\nsizes that giving voice to everyone is the primary aim of journalism. In addition, journal-\nism should include ordinary people in public debates, should propose possible solutions\nfor urgent problems, and should set the agenda (Cassidy, 2005).\nAn additional category is useful for the present analysis: the advocate. Aiming to\n`value judgments according to political, social, or moral standards'(Donsbach and Klett,\n1993) this role perception taps into the extent to which journalists think they should go\nin actively promoting peace. It is often seen as a counterpart to the notion of impartiality.\nYet, it potentially frees journalists from a bias towards elite sources and a `he said, she\nsaid' style of reporting. It is thus in favour of a more analytical approach to socio-politi-\nAgainst this backdrop, the four categories that will be used as a starting point for this\ndiscussion are as follows: the disseminator, the watchdog, the public mobilizer and the\nadvocate. Based on the conceptualizations of these various role perceptions, we intro-\nduce the first central research question: To what extent and how are journalists negotiat-\ning different roles between being a mere disseminator of information, an alert watchdog,\nan involving public mobilizer or an active advocate? (RQ1).\nInterpretative journalism and role conceptions in peace journalism\nOver the last decades, a rise of a more interpretative style has been noticed in journalist prac-\ntices in many countries (Esser and Umbricht, 2014; Patterson, 1996; Salgado and Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck,\n2011). However, as pointed out by Salgado and Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck (2011), the definition of this term,\nincluding practical and theoretical conceptions, remains highly debated.As common ground,\nthe majority of studies identify that interpretative journalism moves beyond the hard facts and\ndescriptive nature of journalism. This style of journalism entails that news coverage is driven\nby the theme decided upon by the journalists or editors. Patterson (1996) has even argued that\njournalists select a theme prior to covering the facts. In any case, interpretative journalism\nentails an emphasis on the meaning of news events, beyond describing the `Who, What,\nInterpretative journalism counters the hard news paradigm and the idea of objectivity.\nIts active stance gives the journalist more control over a story and changes his or her\nrelationship with the source, as the journalistic role is not seen as only repeating what has\nbeen said, but also providing contextual details and historical relevance (Salgado and\nStr\u00f6mb\u00e4ck, 2011). Hence, a journalist takes a greater responsibility regarding the content\nof the story and presents a broader picture.\nA critique on this strand of journalism is that the focus on the `why' behind a story\nmakes the news all too dependent on the journalists' view. Patterson (1996) claims that\ninterpretative journalism asks too much by requiring journalists always stay on top of the\nmotives and agenda of politicians. Moreover, he is critical of the role of journalists as\nthey are subject to economic pressures and are in many cases not held accountable them-\nselves. Such a view that media should provide a more unfiltered version of what sources\nsay, is countered by supporters of interpretative journalism. They suggest that there is a\nneed for contextualized, analytical information (Salgado and Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck, 2011).\nFurthermore, it is argued that neutral reporting is impossible, as a journalist is already\nsubjective when choosing topics, interviewees and narratives.\nLeaving aside the normative implications of interpretative journalism, an important\nreason for its development was that newspapers could not keep up with the fast pace of\ntelevision and later, online news. As Patterson (1996) notes in the US media industry\ndevelopment, this resulted into a transition to the larger provision of context and back-\nground details. In this study, the perspective of Colombian journalists regarding the hard\nnews paradigm versus a more interpretative style of journalism is relevant as it influ-\nences the stance they have on their role in the conflict. Journalists who favour more\ninterpretative forms of reporting are likely to embrace an active role (Weaver and\nMcCombs, 1980). This is further confirmed by empirical evidence from Bartholom\u00e9\net al. (2015), who show that in conflict framing, journalists hold role conceptions that\noppose the mere dissemination of information.\nPeace Journalism in particular calls for a more active role of journalists in building\npeace. Importantly, peace journalism is rooted in interpretative routines (Fong, 2009).\nThis type of journalism explores contexts and causes of conflicts and promotes the trans-\nparent representation of all stakeholders, not only of the elites. Also, it focuses on crea-\ntive ideas for conflict resolution and the exposure of lies (Galtung, 2003; Lynch and\nMcGoldrick, 2012). War journalism, in contrast, focuses on violence, elites and the\nPrager and Hameleers 5\nquestion of victory, whereas peace journalism wants to present more nuances of any\nconfrontation (Lynch and McGoldrick, 2012).\nIn Colombia, Peace Journalism has attracted a considerable level of attention. It has\nbeen praised by the government, researchers, and journalists themselves. One of the first\ninitiatives in this direction was Medios para la Paz (MPP), meaning `media for peace',\nlaunched by journalists in 1998 (Barajas, 2016). Today, there is a relatively high number\nEspectador, \u00a1Pacifista! (2017), by Vice Colombia, La Silla Vacia (2017) or VerdadAbierta\n(2017) by the think tank Fundaci\u00f3n Ideas para la Paz (FIP) and the magazine Semana.\nPeace Journalism is regarded as a desirable way of dealing with a conflict, but can be\nrather impracticable in many cases. An example is the practice of mainstream journalism\nto highlight elite voices and conflict, with the aim of making a story more newsworthy\nand increasing the audience's interest (Harcupp and O'Neill, 2016). In this sense, Peace\nJournalism `fails to take into account the dynamics of news production' (Barajas, 2016).\nMoreover, a fundamental question regards the way a journalist's role in conflict situa-\ntions is perceived. Hanitzsch argues that a journalists' role is not to solve the world's\nconflicts. Also, he highlights that journalism is a product of the society around it and is\nAsecond paramount point of critique is that in a conflict situation, the need for reporting\natrocities should not be neglected. In this sense, Peace Journalism is said to be too soft,\noverly positive and even na\u00efve (Barajas, 2016). Without doubt, journalists have a duty to\nhold actors accountable and point towards wrongdoings. Barajas questions the strategy of\nthe Colombian government to actively promote the concept of Peace Journalism and sug-\ngests it might be a tactic to silence journalists from scrutinizing the ongoing conflict.\nHowever, we believe that the mere concept of Peace Journalism has to be seen separate\nfrom Santos' government's usage of it, because Peace Journalism does not promote the\ndissolution of discourses that involve violence. Its aim is to look deeper, contextualize,\nlook for solutions and to not simply reproduce the official narrative of the elites (e.g. Keeble\net al., 2010; Pilger, 2010). Furthermore, Peace Journalism is a way to reflect on the conse-\nquences that reporting might have on the audience. In this way, it is helpful in sensible situ-\nations, where the population's perception of conflict and its most central causes are critical\nin the process towards piece (e.g. Garc\u00eda-Marrugo, 2013). Contrary to Barajas'understand-\ning of the concept, it is not about publicly announcing that a journalist's work follows the\nexamples of Peace Journalism, but rather about a self-reflection of newsrooms.\nAgainst the background of the challenging context of interpretative peace journalism,\nthe final research question of this paper is: To what extent and how do journalists perceive\nchallenges and barriers in the execution of their journalistic role perceptions? (RQ2).\nMethod\nData collection\nA total of 16 semi-structured interviews were conducted, of which four took place via\nSkype and 12 in person in Bogot\u00e1 and Medell\u00edn. Contact with the interviewees was\nestablished by purposive as well as snowball sampling (Marshall, 1996). Specifically,\nthis strategy entailed looking for journalists from diverse backgrounds and standpoints to\nacquire a diverse range of perspectives. Journalists from TV, radio, newspapers and digi-\ntal projects of different generations and professional backgrounds were included in the\nsearch. Consequently, diversity regarding personal and professional experiences with the\nconflict was achieved. They were purposefully selected by looking for authors of articles\nfrom outlets that supported or opposed the peace negotiations in Havana, as well as\nthrough the contacts of friends and acquaintances. Subsequently, some interviewees pro-\nvided further contacts. As can be seen in Table 1, most of the journalists were inter-\nviewed live in Bogot\u00e1, where the majority of bigger media outlets are based. However,\nfive of the interviewees started their journalistic careers in other regions of Colombia.\nNine journalists explicitly said to have been directly affected by the conflict.\nThe interview format was semi-structured (see Appendix 1 for interview guide). Most\nquestions were unstandardized and open. This technique was chosen to give interview-\nees the possibility to include topics they personally regarded as important and to leave\nroom for follow-ups (David and Sutton, 2011).\nAtheoretically guided approach ensured maximum efficiency and effectiveness of the\ninterviews (Braun and Clarke, 2006). This approach allowed us to create relatively simi-\nlar interview situations by asking journalists the same set of questions. However, in an\ninductive manner, the mostly open and explorative interview questions were modified\nwhen the interviewee had already talked about an issue before the relevant question came\nup or when a follow-up seemed fruitful (e.g. Braun and Clarke, 2006).\nThe interview questions became more specific throughout the interview. The rationale\nbehind this approach was to first get a feeling for which themes were considered impor-\ntant by the journalists and to get a broader picture of their opinion. The more specific\nquestions later aimed at avoiding jumping to false conclusions about what had been said\nbefore and to get a better feeling for the journalists' view (David and Sutton, 2011). In\nthe end, the interviewees were asked to explicitly select one, or multiple, of the pre-\ndeveloped role models to check if the conclusions were coherent with the journalists'\nown view. This can be seen as a form of a member check (Birt et al., 2016).\nData analysis\nThe data were recorded and fully transcribed and organized with the programme NVivo,\nwhich proved to be a helpful tool to gain a well-organized and in-depth insight into the\ndata and develop a framework of codes (see Appendix 1 Table 2 for coding details).\nThe gathered data were coded following the approach of thematic analysis, as\ndescribed by Braun and Clarke (2006), which provides a widely used framework to iden-\ntify and analyse patterns, also called themes, across a collection of data items. This\nmeans that we looked for central topics in each interview, developed a codebook, applied\nthem to the texts and searched for patterns. In this way, following the principles of\nGrounded Theory, theories were `developed from empirical material'. (Flick, 2014).\nCodes were formulated while going through the data, clustered together and thereby\nreduced more and more. The most dominant ones are described in the results section.\nSpecifically, the open codes were structured around specific role perceptions as main\ndimensions. After the process of constant comparison between dimensions and their\nPrager and Hameleers 7\nindicators, codes were refined and developed into more general themes. The indicators\nwere compared both within and between role perceptions. Within role conceptions, we\nalso structured the themes around the dimensions of challenges and opportunities. Next,\nopinions on these topics, as well as their related role conceptions were related back to\ntheory and analysed driven by the research questions.\nResults\nIn between four role models\nThe journalists interviewed for this study, with the exception of Journalist 1, all held a\nvery active role conception. That said, even Journalist 1 saw the role of the media as\nimportant in shaping the public debate but underlined the importance of detachment. `We\nhave a very big power in our hands which is the power to construct and transform',\nJournalist 1 said. The norm of objectivity was rejected by all journalists. They said \u00ad\neven though to varying degrees, as can be seen from the discussion below \u00ad that their\nown experience would be reflected in their work.Again, the only exception was Journalist\n1, who believed in the possibility of objective reporting.\nDisseminator. This role conception is the least active one of the four conceptualized cat-\negories. However, journalists mentioning this role conception did not see it as opposed\nTable 1. Description of participants and interview context.\nInterview\ndate\nMedia type Location Interview\nformat\nDuration\n(international)\n(national)\n(international)\nto taking an active stance but referred to it in terms of the obligation of spreading the\ntruth and sticking close to the facts. This was especially highlighted with regards to the\nhigh share of misinformation and the biased media environment: `The protagonists are\nthe stakeholders of the conflict, in this case the government, the armed groups, and \u00ad\nmost importantly \u00ad the people. They are the ones who need to be visible, not the journal-\nists', Journalist 8 said. In addition, bridging information gaps was an important topic, as,\nfor example, emphasized by Journalist 13, who said most of the victims he meets were\nvictims of paramilitary groups, while his audience blames the FARC for everything.\nJournalist 4, who described himself as a supporter of the peace process, told a story in\nwhich he had interviewed someone who criticized parts of the peace deal and wanted to\ninclude this into a news piece. His editor immediately changed the angle of the story say-\ning that as a newspaper supporting the peace process, they couldn't publish criticism on\nit. The journalist himself felt like it would have been the right choice to disseminate what\nhad been said, instead of sticking to the editorial line of supporting the deal. Criticism of\nthis role conception was articulated the light of underlining the necessity to contextualize\nand not only disseminate information without thorough verification, by, for example,\nWatchdog. The category of the watchdog was in most cases brought up in the context of\ncalling out omissions of the state and the spread of misinformation by all sides. Thereby\nit involved strong investigative duties for journalists. At the same time, this role was\nassociated with putting journalists at risk, when, for example, covering corruption. Jour-\nnalist 4, 10, 12 and 16 opposed this category, with the argument that watching the elites\nwould not be enough and instead emphasized the importance of the role of journalists to\ngive a voice to the civil society. Furthermore, they stressed that in the context of war, it\nwas not possible to stay detached as a watchdog but that active participation in the public\ndebate was necessary.\nAdvocate. `We have tried to be very objective in our work and this is not working. We\nlose and we are becoming each day more distant from the people', said Journalist 16.\nThis journalist stressed that, in the middle of a war, it was simply impossible not to get\ninvolved. At this point, it was recurrently highlighted that they as journalists were also\nColombians, who have had their own experiences with the conflict and their own inter-\nests about how to move forward. In this sense, as mentioned before, the notion of objec-\ntivity was rejected in favour of pursuing an advocative role.\nAnother way of looking at it was the question of how much activism was needed to\nget the audience to listen. As Journalist 13 said, `I sometime take an activist role. But for\nplay. You know? Because I believe that if I take more of an activist role, more people will\nlisten to me'. All the interviewees, who talked about themselves as advocates, supported\nthe peace process and were in favour of pushing for reconciliation. But also those jour-\nnalists, who did not think about themselves as advocates mentioned the great responsibil-\nity of Colombian media in shaping the public opinion and finding possible ways to move\nforward.\nAt several points, this conception overlapped with arguments for being a public mobi-\nlizer. As Journalist 12 phrased it,\nPrager and Hameleers 9\ngive voice to all the movements, organizations, of all types and all political stances that have\nbeen suffering in the conflict but have resisted and have a story to tell. Not only as a memorial\nof the conflict but as proposals for the construction of peace.\nPublic mobilizer. This category was most dominant in journalists' interpretations. Giving\na voice to everyone as opposed to only focusing on the elites was seen as a primary task\nby many of the interviewees. At the same time, the failure to do so was one of their main\ncritiques of the national media sphere. Thereby, telling the stories of ordinary people and\nshedding light on what was going on in society were the main reasons for the journalists\nto choose this category. For 12 of them, the mobilization of people to participate in shap-\ning the country's future was defined as a goal. As Journalist 12 said, `We have been try-\ning to involve the audience more with several opinion columnists\u00admilitary persons,\nactivists, guerrillas\u00adfor them to nourish all visions'. This aim was even mentioned if the\nPublic Mobilizer was not chosen as a category, as in the case of Journalist 4. For him, the\ninclusion of the whole society was especially important because of his definition of the\nColombian conflict as social, instead of political.\nA challenging climate to go forward\nIn light of RQ2, several major challenges regarding the role of the media in the conflict\ncan be identified, as they play an important role in shaping public opinion. The chal-\nlenges that were mentioned most frequently in the interviews are the polarization of the\ncountry, the inaccurate framing of the government \u00ad in the sense that the peace deal was\nused synonymous with peace \u00ad and the difficulties surrounding the implementation of\nthe peace accord.\nOne of the most significant commonalities was the concern about the poor perfor-\nmance of the country's national media outlets in terms of independent reporting as well\nas regarding the mediated reality of the conflict. Therefore, failures of the media will be\na prevailing theme throughout the following analysis. In this context, the concept of\nPeace Journalism has been mentioned recurrently and highlighted for its potential to\nimprove the journalistic praxis in Colombia.\nPolarization. In Colombia's polarized debate about moving forward, two highly opinion-\nated camps oppose each other: One in favour of the peace accord with the guerrilla and\none against it. Interviewees criticized that media outlets were driving this societal split\nfurther. There is little space for nuances and therefore little space for constructive discus-\nsions. As Journalist 13 said,\nRather than putting that on the political agenda, which would be a duty as a journalist, they put\nit on the public agenda. So, Santos has a fight with Uribe. And now the country is divided into\nSantistas and Uribstas. You know what I mean. While, ... I wasn't born a Santista. Or an\nUribista.\nThis is further intensified through the dynamics of social media, as it was mentioned\nby several interviewees. Due to the possibility to filter opposing opinions, social net-\nworks create bubbles in societies, in which people tend to only consume media content\nthat confirms their views. Journalist 13 spoke about campaigns of misinformation in\nconservative circles, such as the high salary for ex-combatants and the difficulty to dis-\nmantle such allegations, while being filtered out of these communications on, for exam-\nple, Twitter.\nFurthermore, the questions of transitional justice, reconciliation and impunity are\ncausing much disagreement. Explaining the complexity of these emotional issues to the\naudience has been mentioned as a major difficulty and main failure of the Colombian\nmedia. As Journalist 8 said,\nNobody explains anything. [...] This is how people become polarized and confused. They see\na media outlet and notice that it is the view of the government, or another one that is presenting\na leftist view. And people don't know any more whom to believe.\nWithout exception, the journalists spoke of the necessity for a change in the status-\nquo of conflict reporting.\nof Peace Journalism could have for such a transformation, especially its focus on the\ncivil society instead of on the elites, which was described as major advantage. Platforms\nsuch as \u00a1Pacifista! and Colombia2020 were brought up as best practice models. However,\ntheir digital character, distribution strategy via Social Media and active stance as sup-\nporters of the peace process limit their readership \u00ad especially when compared to the\nimpact of the TV stations Caracol and RCN. Journalist 16 said, `The problem with\nColombia2020, El Espectador, is that it is mainly digital and many people in Colombia\nstill don't have access to the Internet. [...] So they are amazing but most of their stories\ndon't reach anyone'.\nInaccurate framing by the government. A barrier that many journalists brought up was the\nstrong push by the government for a `speech of peace', as Journalist 16 formulated it.\nAnd Journalist 14 said, `Santos tells the world that there is peace in Colombia but there\nis no peace because the FARC is not the only armed actor. [...] The peace doesn't exist'.\nThis refers to the government's practice to try to convey to the world that Colombia left\nits troubles in the past. This includes the need to set the deal with the FARC equal to\nbringing peace to the country (Restrepo and Ram\u00edrez, 2016), while turning a blind eye\non the big remaining challenges. An example is the intensifying conflict between the\ntwo guerrilla groups ELN and the Popular Liberation Army (Ej\u00e9rcito Popular de Lib-\neraci\u00f3n, EPL) in Catatumbo, close to the Venezuelan border (El Espectador, 2018).\nMoreover, the role of the FARC is often over-emphasized. `The reality of Colombia's\nconflict is that the FARC is a victimizer of only maybe 34% of the total number of vic-\ntims. But all the attention is on the FARC. FARC. FARC', said Journalist 13. This is\nespecially true for the international picture of the conflict. Within Colombia, considera-\nble coverage on the role of other armed actors also exists. However, political and eco-\nnomic elites have an interest in keeping reports about current violence in the country\ndown, several interviewees remarked. `If you see more details, you will see the carpet.\nAnd you will see that they use these beautiful words to hide an impunity agreement for\neverybody', Journalist 15 said.\nPrager and Hameleers 11\nConcerning RQ2, it can be concluded that the above mentioned perceived spread of\nmisinformation from all parties plays an important role, as it poses a big challenge for\njournalists to report truthfully \u00ad a goal that all interviewees underlined.\nImplementation of the peace accord\nIn this context of polarization and misinformation, the successful implementation of the\naccord as well as further steps into the direction of reconciliation and stability are diffi-\ncult. All 16 journalists consistently pointed out that the real challenge for the country lies\nin this phase. `Colombia is a hurt country, psychologically and physically. There are a lot\nof scars', Journalist 3 said.\nHence, the disputed nature of the agreements concerning transitional justice is not\nsurprising. Not all members of society support the peace accord as introduced in\nColombia. In the beginning of October 2016, the Colombian electorate rejected the\naccord in a plebiscite. However, the government interpreted the negative outcome as a\ndemand to renegotiate and decrease concessions made to the FARC and finally pushed\nthe revised accord through without consulting the population again (Brodzinsky,\n2016). For many `No' supporters, these revisions were not far-reaching enough.\n`Changes were not profound. They started to implement it against the will of the peo-\nple', Journalist 14 said. Most of the other interviewees were much more positive about\nthe deal, as Journalist 2: `It is one of the most complete peace agreements internation-\nally that I have ever seen. [...] Maybe the process is not perfect but we should be striv-\ning for it'. At the same time, it is crucial that over 60 percent of Colombians did not\nvote (El Tiempo, 2016) and that the voter turnout was especially low in areas most\naffected by the conflict.\nAmong citizens who voted, considerable differences could be noted, depending on\nthe region. In the most affected regions, voters tended to approve the peace process (El\nAnother uncertainty is posed by the vacuum that has been created through the demo-\nbilization of the FARC, especially in terms of access to the country's natural resources.\nAt the moment, one of the fiercest competition takes place in the field of goldmining,\nespecially regarding illicit trade, where goldmining has already overtaken the profit\nderived from cocaine (Alsema, 2016). Furthermore, there has been a stark increase of\nkillings of social leaders by different armed groups in rural regions (Semana, 2018).\nJournalist 4 said about the current instabilities: `And what if these motherfuckers [para-\nmilitaries] still don't like it to have a leftist party in politics in Colombia. Are they going\nto kill them like before?'\nImportant for this so-called post-conflict time is also, as, for example, Journalist 11\nsaid, that the society as a whole, including the media, learns how to speak and think in\npeaceful terms. With regards to the media sector, the potential of the concept of Peace\nJournalism was highlighted by some interviewees. But such a change of mentality takes\ntime, Journalist 11 said. Journalist 5, who aims at being thought-provoking with her col-\numns, talked about the necessity to stop and think and change common newsroom prac-\ntices. For her, the main challenge is to not give up in this process:\n`I am a distance runner, marathons. And you have to have resistance. In war as in peace. You\nhave to be willing to run for a long time. And that is very hard. People like things fast. That's\nlike the Narco culture. But peace processes are very slow'.\nDiscussion\nSituated in a context confronted with the severe consequences of conflict, this study\naimed to provide in-depth insights into the role perceptions of Colombian journalists in\nthe country's conflict. RQ1 aimed to investigate to what extent and in what ways\nColombian journalists identify with various role models foregrounded in research (e.g.\nCassidy, 2005). The role of the public mobilizer was favoured by many. There was a\nstrong tendency of perceiving the duty of journalists as giving voice to the civil society\nand telling the stories of citizens, instead of providing a stage for the elite. This corre-\nsponds with Cassidy's (2005) definition of the term as giving a voice to everyone, includ-\ning ordinary people in public debates, proposing possible solutions for problems and\nactively setting the agenda. In the light of Colombia's high level of polarization, this was\nseen as an important counter-strategy to involve the whole society into finding a way\nforward. All journalists, even though to varying degrees, shared this active approach to\nthe role of journalists to bring about change in society. This attitude links well with the\nconcept of Peace Journalism, as will be discussed below.\nAt the same time, the most important duty mentioned was to contextualize and ana-\nlyse, which is connected to all the described role perceptions. This goes hand in hand\nwith the perceived importance of interpretative journalism in Colombia that was con-\nfirmed by the majority of interviewees. Also, it is in line with the global shift of journal-\nism to strengthen its focus on the `why' question (e.g. Patterson, 1996; Salgado and\nStr\u00f6mb\u00e4ck, 2011). However, the increase of interpretation in news was also problema-\ntized. It was seen as a failure of the media when mentioned in the sense that journalists\ntake sides and refuse to show the whole picture of a story. At this point, Hanitzsch's\n(2004) argument that journalists are a product of society is important, especially with\nregard to the Colombian context of concentrated media ownership structure and security\nconcerns. Furthermore, according to Patterson (1996), they are subject to economic and\npolitical pressure, while the public cannot hold journalists accountable.\nJournalists had a strong sense of providing a public service by telling the lesser told\nstories and enabling people to engage in the public debate. The central tendency points\ntowards the role perception to mobilize the audience by providing information and con-\ntext. Journalists called for self-reflection, which is an explicit aim of Peace Journalism.\nWithin Peace Journalism, journalists are prescribed the role to contribute to peaceful\nconflict transformation. Therefore, they have to be aware of their central role and respon-\nsibility in society. The journalist operates in a sensitive area, where caution is urgently\nneeded and open self-reflection crucial (Mitra, 2016). Within Peace Journalism, this self-\nreflection should ideally happen in a way that is comprehensible for the audience (Lynch\nand McGoldrich, 2005; Mitra, 2016). Indeed, the results of this study indicate that jour-\nnalists see a need for change and search for ways forward.\nIn today's world of an endless stream of information, journalists are required to con-\nnect the dots and provide context (Patterson, 1996). This development is fostered through\nPrager and Hameleers 13\nsocial media (Gandour, 2016), posing an opportunity and a challenge for journalists at\nthe same time. While social media offers possibilities in peace building, as they have the\npotential to foster communication beyond social divides (Howard, 2015), its actual\ndynamics can further social division, as people tend to look for news that confirm their\nviews (Gandour, 2016). This played a substantial role in the 2016 plebiscite. Especially\nthe `No'campaign mobilized strongly via digital platforms (Roddel, 2016). Furthermore,\nthey provided a stage for political actors to spread messages themselves, bypassing the\nmedia (Gandour, 2016). Regarding RQ2, this was seen as very problematic in the light\nof the high amount of misinformation in the Colombian discourse, as it is hard for jour-\nnalists to counter inaccurate statements (Engesser et al., 2017).\nAgainst this backdrop, it can be concluded that that the concept of Peace Journalism\nis indeed compatible with the role perception of Colombian journalists. The main fea-\ntures of the concept of Peace Journalism have been embraced by the interviewees. This\nincludes a stronger focus on contextualizing, proposing solutions, giving voice to the\nvoiceless and turning away from the practice of only offering a voice to the elites (Keeble\net al., 2010; Fong, 2009). This also regards the role perception of journalists as advo-\ncates. Within Peace Journalism, this role is primarily seen as an instrument to not only\nilluminate existing problems, but to also advocate possible solutions (Shaw et al., 2011).\nNo clear reluctance towards a more advocative approach was found, which dismisses the\ncriticism of Peace Journalism crossing the lines towards activism in this context.\nA criticism of Peace Journalism, as well as other forms of interpretative approaches,\nis that they dismiss the notion of objectivity, which can have an important function of\nlegitimization for a newspiece (Skovsgaard et al., 2013). Journalists disregarded this\ncriticism, as 15 from the 16 interviewed journalists rejected the notion of objectivity.\nRather, they called for an active stance that goes well with the concept of Peace\nJournalism.\nHowever, the actual feasibility of the concept is another question. At the one hand,\njournalists hold a very active role conception and interpretative journalism is salient in\nthe Colombian media landscape. At the other hand, it is difficult to improve the situation\nbecause of concentrated ownership structures, continuing security concerns on the local\nlevel, as well as an orientation towards soft news (G\u00f3mez-Giraldo et al., 2010) and the\nintensification of polarization through social media (Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2015). Various\nobstacles for the implementation of the peace accord further complicate the situation.\nNevertheless, many interviewees spoke of the opportunities in the current situation. The\nlong-lasting conflict raised the awareness for the need for change, increasing the popu-\nlarity of Peace Journalism.\nHowever, it is by far not wide-ranging enough to profoundly change the Colombian\nmedia landscape. The doubt of the impact that engaged journalists can have on the coun-\ntry illustrates the negative perspective interviewees had on the overall media landscape.\nYet, an example for a context in which practices of Peace Journalism could be very fruit-\nful is the potential to counter the fear that many people have of the FARC. This is espe-\ncially true for those citizens that live far from the most affected areas of conflict and\nnever had direct contact with the FARC, but instead only have the mediated picture of the\nformer guerrilla group. This is not to justify committed atrocities, but to emphasize what\nmany interviewees said: namely that media outlets have spread a lot of fear of the group\nby extensively reporting on the actions of the FARC in the conflict, without providing\nmuch context. Today, parts of the deep polarization of society revolve around the ques-\ntion of penalties for former combatants versus reincorporation (Semana, 2017).\nAt this point, a couple of this study's limitations have to be noted. While the inter-\nviewees of this sample had a very active role perception, this might not be the case for\nColombian journalists in general, as the described results are not representative. It could\nbe argued that journalists are more likely to agree to participate in respective research if\nthey have a strong opinion on the topic. Likewise, a strong interest in a political issue and\nhigh empathic concern have been shown to be positively correlated with assuming an\nactive role (Bekker, 2005). However, it is not surprising that journalists might simply\nhave strong opinions towards the countries development considering the long historical\nroots of the conflict and the way it has severely affected many lives.\nAnother point is that answers could be subject to a social desirability bias, also influ-\nenced by the presence of the interviewer. Also, the interview conditions were not consist-\nent, as some were conducted via Skype and some in person. The same concerns the\nlanguage used, as some interviewees were comfortable with doing the interview in\nEnglish, while others preferred Spanish.\nDespite these limitations, this study has provided insights into journalists' role per-\nceptions in the face of conflict. While Colombian journalists experience many obstacles\nin their work, such as highly concentrated ownership structures, continuing security con-\ncerns and the spread of misinformation, they held an active role perception and strongly\naimed to engage the public. To a large extent, this is compatible with the practises pro-\nmoted by Peace Journalism, which gained considerable popularity and demand in\nColombia, creating a market for its products. Yet, it is a small market and reaches only a\nlimited audience, a decisive obstacle, which is why the concept of Peace Journalism\nremains contested and needs further development of its potential for the Colombian\nmarket.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nReferences\nAlsema A (2016) 80% of Colombia's gold production either informal or illegal: Mining asso-\nciation.

First, can you tell me a bit about your career? Where have you worked and for\nhow long?\n2. Why did you decide to go into journalism?\n3. What do you think are the biggest challenges Colombia deals with at the moment\nregarding the peace process? And how is the media involved in them?\n4. To what extent would you say a journalist should actively take a role in the peace\nprocess or rather stay detached and simply distribute information?\n5. Do you think this attitude would be shared by your colleagues?\n6. To what extent and how do you think your own opinion is reflected in your arti-\ncles? What does this mean in terms of objectivity?\n7. In many countries, there has been a rise of interpretative journalism, which\nfocuses stronger on causes and explanations. How do you see this in Colombia?\n8. Studies have shown that Colombian media portrayed the Farc much more nega-\ntively than other actors, such as the paras. Why do you think is that?\n9. How free are you in choosing the topics and angles in your work?\n10. What barriers and facilitators do you experience when you write about the peace\nprocess?\n11. To what extent do you think that journalists should take an active role in promot-\ning peace? Is it okay if journalists take a more advocating role there?\n12. A possible way to categorize journalistic role models is to divide them into the\nfour following categories. Do you identify with one of these? First, the dissemi-\nnator \u00ad who simply spreads information. Second, the watchdog \u00ad who critically\nscrutinizes the actions of politicians and other influential actors. Third, the advo-\ncate \u00ad who actively promotes a goal, such as peace in this case. Forth, public\nmobilizer \u00ad who primarily wants to engage the masses into the public debate.\n13. Do you have anything to add?\nTable 2. Coding journalists' role perceptions.\nRole model(s) Quote\nJournalist1 Disseminator `The disseminator. Let the people what is going on, we\ndon't take sides'.\nJournalist2 Disseminator,\nWatchdog,\nAdvocate\n`I'd say with news pieces, I am a disseminator, because it's\njust getting it out there. If I am a romantic I would say that\nI am a watchdog, because I do like to call out people on\nthings. [...] And I am an advocate when it comes to peace'.\nJournalist3 Public Mobilizer,\nWatchdog\n`When there are these pro peace marches, journalists\ninform and invite people to go there. [...] When there\nare tragedies, TV stations sometimes take the lead to fund\npeople that have been impacted by some tragedies. [...] It's\nvery strongly mobilizing but it's also watchdog and eyes are\nput on the politicians. Is it working? Is it having a real impact\non the system? Not as much as it should'.\nJournalist4 Advocate `I started journalism because I thought it was a way to\ninform behaviour of people and to influence their opinions'.\nJournalist5 Disseminator,\nWatchdog,\nAdvocate, Public\nMobilizer\n`If you believe in peace, you will mobilize people towards it.\nAnd then you write telling them why peace is good and why\nthey should do something and help somehow that peace\nreally happens and grows and build up consensus. If you are\nfor peace and you see violence to build up, you will be a\ndefender, you will be a watchdog'.\nJournalist6 Watchdog `I like the journalists a lot, who stays independent here. A\njournalist, who denounces, who takes evidence, who does\ninvestigations, who's work leads to jurisdiction'.\nJournalist7 Advocate, Public\nMobilizer\n`We don't only distribute. We contribute something to\nsociety with every piece. We have a big responsibility in\nproviding a message to many, many people'.\nJournalist8 Public Mobilizer,\nDisseminator\n`I identify with the public mobilizer but when the aim is to\ninvolve the people we take sides. We want them to talk, but\nout of this and that perspective. We have to be very careful\nthere not to cross the thin lines. That's why it is a mixture\nwith the disseminator'.\nPrager and Hameleers 19\nRole model(s) Quote\nJournalist9 Public Mobilizer `The media doesn't function without it's audience. [...] It's\nthe people, who take the decisions'.\nJournalist10 Public Mobilizer `Reaching a positive change for the country. In the last years\nI have oriented my work towards the topic of protest, of\npublic marches. Because I think this is the only way to show\nthat we are one. [...] We need to make it clear to people\nthat they need to claim their rights'.\nJournalist11 Disseminator,\nWatchdog,\nAdvocate, Public\nMobilizer\n`We need to be all of them in different moments of the\nnews. The news should not stay in the news. It needs to get\nout there, construct, transform'.\nJournalist12 Public Mobilizer,\nWatchdog\n`Those two show proactive ways. I believe we need to do\nmore than just telling the simple facts. We have been trying\nto involucrate more the audience, with several opinion\ncolumnists. [...] For them to nourish all visions'.\nJournalist13 Disseminator,\nWatchdog, Public\nMobilizer\n`We, the media, are supposed to check power for the\nbenefit of our fellow citizens. Just in case the justice system\nis asleep'.\nJournalist14 Watchdog, Public\nMobilizer\n`The watchdog is very much me, in terms of his focus.\nLooking where the money goes, watching what the\ngovernor is doing. But not so much on the topic of the\npeace process, because what counts in that process is the\nconstitution. And I think the constitution has been violated\nwhen the government pushed the peace accord through'.\nJournalist15 Watchdog `I work with a human rights perspective and give voice to\nthe voiceless and I try to raise the attention in issues that\nother people don't do but it doesn't mean that I have a goal\nthrough my journalism. No, my goal is to tell the truth'.\nJournalist16 Advocate, Public\nMobilizer\n`The journalist cannot just be a speaker, he has to analyse,\nmake people understand the context. So that they can take\nbetter choices on their common lives. [...] And also, he has\nto try make civil society interested on the political reality so\nthat they can transform it. Because many people here are\nso tired of politics because of corruption and all what has\nhappened'.\nTable 2. (Continued)"
