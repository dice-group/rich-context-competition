By\nexamining the complex of relationships in the gender allocation of employment and\nhousehold tasks, this study helps further our understanding of the changing gender roles\nin Japan, a post-industrial country with dramatically different cultural heritage from the\nWest.\n2. Conceptual framework\nOur analysis is guided by the conceptual framework presented in Figure 1. The main\nfocus is on the time allocation of employment and household tasks of spouses:\nspecifically, the relationships between (1) wives' employment and their own housework\ntime, (2) husbands' employment time and their own housework time, (3) spouses'\nemployment time, (4) spouses' housework time, (5) wives' employment and husbands'\nhousework time, and (6) wives' housework time and husbands' employment time. Note\nthat arrows run both ways in these complex relationships, as each path is likely\nreciprocal. The two smaller rectangles point to micro factors affecting employment and\nhousework time, and the ovals call attention to elements of the broader context within\nwhich the interplay of employment and housework occurs. It is particularly important to\nnote that any of these contextual factors may affect any of the key analytical variables\nindirectly, through the network of relationships represented.\n3. Data and measures\nWe use replicated cross-sectional data drawn from three surveys: the 1994 National\non Family and Economic Conditions (NSFEC). The 1994 NSWFL is a nationally\nThe same questionnaire was used in the two surveys in 2009. Weights are used for the\ndifferential response rates by age, sex, and size of place of residence. The 1994 data are\nsurveys.\nIn all the surveys, married respondents were asked to provide reports for\nthemselves and for their spouses on objective information, including the hours and\nschedules of employment, time spent on core household tasks, and basic characteristics\nsuch as age and education. This paper focuses on two central dimensions of the gender\ndivision of labor: employment time and housework time. Time spent on childcare was\nnot included in the housework time estimates because this variable is difficult to\nmeasure since parents are often doing other things while simultaneously watching\nFigure 1: Schematic diagram of factors affecting time spent on household tasks\nand employment\nHousehold tasks Labor-market activities\nWife Wife\nHusband Husband\nFamily situation\nChildren\nParents/parents-in-law\nEconomic resources\nEducation\nIncome\nMarriage market\nWork & family\nvalue orientations\nLabor-market\nconditions\nTechnologies for\nhousehold maintenance\nNotes: Ovals represent macro factors and rectangles represent micro factors.

Couples' employment\nDespite the prolonged economic stagnation since the early 1990s, the employment rate\nand hours of Japanese husbands in their prime working years appear not to have\nchanged much over the 15 years under study. On average, they work about 50\u00ad51 hours\nper week, and around half work 49 hours or more. This long average workweek is an\nimportant factor to consider in evaluating gender differences in time spent on\n2000 and reached a plateau thereafter, but the mean work hours of employed wives\nThis decline was due primarily to increases in the proportion of wives working fewer\nthan 35 hours per week and decreases in the proportion of those working 42 hours or\nmore. Women working less than 35 hours per week are likely to hold temporary\nemployment while those working 42 hours or more are likely to hold regular\nemployment. Hence, the employment circumstances of Japanese wives of reproductive\nages appear to have deteriorated--whether by choice or as a consequence of the\nrestructuring of the labor market.\nTable 1 presents the percentage employed and the mean work hours of employed\nwives by husbands' employment hours and income, as well as by age of youngest child\nand co-residence with parents. Aside from the few husbands who work the unusual\nschedule of less than 35 hours weekly (who are often ill or older), wives work fewer\nhours if their husbands work longer hours or have higher income. The association with\nhusband's income became stronger over time. In 2009, 67% were employed among\nwives whose husbands earned the least, compared to 57% of those whose husbands\nearned the most. This is what we would expect as wives likely enter the workforce to\nhelp their households financially (Kohara 2010).\nAs expected, wives' employment is strongly associated with their family\ncircumstances. By 2009, the proportion employed ranged from a low of 36% among\nmothers of children under age 3 to 75% among those with school-age children. At the\nsame time, it is notable that the employment of mothers of children under age 3 is as\nhigh as it is, and that it increased substantially (from 28% to 36%) over the 15 years\nunder study. Work hours of employed wives are not as clearly related to ages of\nchildren, though those with no children under age 18 have longer workweeks. Perhaps\nreflecting the availability of childcare, mothers are much more likely to be employed if\nsignificantly longer hours.\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 709\nTable 1: Percentages of wives employed and their mean employment hours\n% of Wives Employed Mean Work Hours per Week\nof Employed Wives\nCharacteristics Mean (N) Mean (N) Mean (N) Mean (N) Mean (N) Mean (N)\nHusbands'\nemployment hours\n--a\nHusbands' income\nin previous year\nLess than 4\nmillion yen\nyen\n6 million yen or\nmore\nAge of youngest\nchild\nLiving with\nparents/parents-in-\nlaw\nNo\nYes\nNotes: The percentages and the means are weighted for 2000 and 2009, but unweighted for 1994; the number of cases are all\nunweighted.\na--Mean is not shown due to a small number of cases (<50).\nStatistical significance of the association of wives' employment rate and hours with selected characteristics is estimated using the\nlogistic or OLS regression models where each characteristic is the only predictor variable.\nA \"*\" indicates significance at 5-percent level.

Couples' housework time and combined workload\nThe upper panel of Table 2 presents the mean hours that wives and husbands spent each\nweek on household tasks and husbands' average share of couples' task hours in 1994,\n2000, and 2009. As expected, there is a very large gender difference in the hours\nspouses spend on housework at all three time points. While wives spent roughly 30\nhours per week on household tasks, husbands spent only 2 to 3 hours on such tasks.\nEven though women universally spend more time on housework than men (Geist and\nTable 2: Mean housework hours per week of wives and husbands and their\naverage combined workload (hours on housework and employment\nHousework Hoursa\nWives' hours per week\nHusbands' hours per week\nHusbands' share (%)\nCombined Workloadb\nAll couples\nWives' hours per week\nHusbands' hours per week\nHusbands' share (%)\nDual-earner couples only\nWives' hours per week\nHusbands' hours per week\nHusbands' share (%)\na--Computed by adding the time devoted to cleaning house, doing laundry, cooking, cleaning after meals, and grocery\nshopping.

Year 2000 is the reference category, and\na \"*\" indicates significance at 5-percent level.\nAt the same time, we also see signs of modest change in the gender difference in\nhousework time. Wives' average housework time declined substantially from around 33\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 711\ncorresponding time for husbands increased from 2.3 to 2.7 to 3.4 hours. Consequently,\nhusbands' share in couples' housework time increased from 7% to 9% to 12%. These\nchanges are as expected and all in the direction of gender balance, but the level of\nhusbands' housework time nonetheless remains low and the absolute amount of\nincrease in husbands' contributions is very small. Therefore the increase in husbands'\nshare of household tasks is primarily due to wives' reduction in their housework time,\nrather than to increases in husbands' contributions. We also examined changes in\nspouses' hours and husbands' share in each core task and found that they followed the\nsame trends as those in the total task hours.\nThere was, however, a sizable decline in the proportion of husbands who do no\nincreasingly drawn into the domestic arena traditionally considered as female, crossing\nthe symbolic gender barrier associated with doing housework.\nNot surprisingly, similar to Western countries (Geist 2010), Japanese spouses\ndiffer in the reported hours that husbands spend doing housework. There is remarkable\nagreement with respect to the average hours wives work around the house (less than an\nhour difference), but considerable disagreement about whether husbands do any\nhousework at all: in 2009, 25% of wives said their husbands did no housework,\ncompared to the 18% reported by husbands. A small effort on the part of a husband may\nseem important to him in light of traditional expectations, but may be regarded as no\nhelp at all from the perspective of his wife. Nonetheless, both wives and husbands\nreport a substantial decline between 1994 and 2009 in the proportions of husbands\ndoing no housework. The truth may well lie in between the reports of both spouses, but\nthe average is low enough that the difference matters little.\nAs shown in the lower panel of Table 2, when housework and employment hours\nare considered jointly, the large gender inequality we saw in the division of household\nlabor disappears, and the gender balance becomes slightly more favorable toward\nwives: husband's average share of the combined workload increases from 51% in 1994\nto 54% in 2009. When we limit our analysis to dual-earner couples, however, the\ngender division of combined workload remains unfavorable toward women, although\nthe gender gap has narrowed.\n6. Couples' employment and housework time\nIn all three study years, the average number of hours that wives spent doing housework\nwas much higher among those who were not employed compared to those who were\nreduce their own housework hours as their employment time increases, the amount of\nDemographic Research: Volume 27, Article 24\n712 http://www.demographic-research.org\nreduction does not come close to matching the corresponding increase in their\nemployment hours. Consequently, wives' hours in housework and employment\ncombined rise dramatically as their labor-market time goes up, reflecting the \"second\nshift\" of wives employed full-time (Hochschild 1991). While mean differences in\nhousework hours between non-employed wives and those employed full-time are large,\nhusbands' housework time increases only modestly (by 1\u00ad2 hours per week) when their\nwives are employed full-time.\nTable 3: Mean hours per week spent by spouses on housework, and husbands'\naverage share (%) of couples' housework hours, by selected\nWives' housework\nhours\nHusbands' housework\nhours\nHusbands' share (%)\nCharacteristics\nWives' employment\nhours\n0 (not working)\nHusbands'\nemployment hours\nHusbands' income\n< 4 million yen\n 6 million yen\nAge of youngest child\nCo-residence with\nparents\nNo\nYes\nStatistical significance of the association of spouses' task time/husbands' share and selected characteristics is estimated using\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 713\nsimple OLS regression models where each characteristic is the only predictor variable.\nA \"*\" indicates significance at 5-percent level. A \" \" indicates the reference category.\nThe main story in Table 3 is the strong, though expected, negative association\nbetween wives' time spent in employment and housework. Nonetheless two other\npatterns also stand out. Wives spend more time on housework, the longer their\nhusbands' workweek, and in particular the more husbands earn. Surprisingly, there is\nrelatively little variation by age of the youngest child, though those with no children\nunder age 18 spend less time on housework than those with younger children. As noted,\ndirect childcare time is not reflected in these estimates and this would considerably\nincrease the domestic workload of those with preschool children. At the same time, it is\nimpressive that wives' housework time decreased markedly during the study period\neven among those with children under age 3. Co-residence with parents reduces\nhousework time of both spouses in all three study years, but the degree of reduction\ntends to be higher for husbands, thereby lowering husbands' share in couples'\nhousework time.\nThe 2009 follow-up allows us to see changes in housework time associated with\nmoving into and out of levels of wives' employment--not working, employed part-time,\nor full-time--from 2000 to 2009, and the results are both substantial and as predicted.\nessentially the same number of housework hours in both years, whereas housework\nhours tended to decrease for those who moved up in their employment levels and\nincrease for those who moved down. Among those who were not employed in 2000, the\naverage weekly housework time increased by 5 hours if they were employed part-time\nemployed part-time in 2000, the mean housework hours increased by 4 hours if they\nstopped working by 2009, but decreased by 3 hours if they moved up to full-time\nemployment. Finally, those working full-time in 2000 had 4 hours less housework time\nper week if they were employed part-time or not at all in 2009.\n7. Marriage and gendered housework time\nYoung Japanese primarily live with their parents when they are unmarried, and the\ntransition to marriage has very different implications for men and women. Compared to\n8 hours on housework per week among never-married women in 2009, the\ncorresponding hours are 27 among currently married women (see Table 4). The\ndifference in the distribution of hours is dramatic: in 2009 only 8% of never-married\nwomen did more than 20 hours of housework per week, compared to 72% of married\nwomen. Men report only 3\u00ad4 hours per week whether or not they are married. By\nmarrying, Japanese women change their position from a receiver of care within a\nDemographic Research: Volume 27, Article 24\n714 http://www.demographic-research.org\nhousehold to the primary provider of domestic tasks. Meanwhile, Japanese men remain\nlargely receivers of care with the main provider switching from their mothers to their\nwives.\nTable 4: Percentage distribution of housework hours per week of never-\nmarried and currently married women and men age 20\u00ad49:\nNever-\nmarried\nCurrently\nmarried\nNever-\nmarried\nCurrently\nmarried\nNever-\nmarried\nCurrently\nmarried\nWomen's\nhousework\nhours\nTotala\nMean hours\nper week\n(Number of\ncases)\nMen's\nhousework\nhours\nZero\nTotala\nMean hours\nper week\n(Number of\ncases)\nThe number of cases are unweighted for all three years.\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 715\na--Total may not sum to 100 because of rounding errors.\nUsing the 2009 cross-sectional data, we examined the Spearman rank-order\ncorrelations between housework time and (a) reported marital happiness, and (b)\nsatisfaction with the division of household labor. We found that the more time the\nhusband spent on housework, the happier both spouses were with the marriage, with the\ncorrelation stronger for wives' reports than for husbands' reports. Men and women\ndiffered, however, on their satisfaction with the division of household labor relative to\nthe time the husband spent on housework: the more husbands did, the less satisfied they\nwere with the division of household labor, while wives were more satisfied with the\nhousehold-task allocation. While the relationship between men's participation in\nhousework and marital happiness is certainly reciprocal, it is consistent with a pattern\nthat when marriages are happy, men are more likely to comply with their wife's wishes\nabout housework, even if they do not want to. Hence, happier marriages may have\ngreater participation by husbands, but because these husbands are helping more at home,\nthey are less satisfied with the domestic-task allocation.\n8. Conclusion\nIn summary, there have been increases in the proportion of Japanese wives working but\ndecreases in the hours they work. Husbands work very long hours--a mean of around\n50 hours per week. Wives' employment decreases with their husbands' employment\nhours and income, and increases with age of youngest child and co-residence with\nsubstantially, and more husbands are doing at least some housework. Nonetheless,\nhusbands' average housework time increased by only about one hour per week. The\namount of time Japanese husbands spend on housework is still very small, and they are\nclearly an outlier in comparison to their Western counterparts (Fuwa 2004). The time\nwives spend doing housework varies markedly with their level of employment. Further,\nwhen Japanese women marry, their housework hours increase dramatically. For men, in\ncontrast, marriage produces very little change in their housework time, with the main\nprovider of housework changing from their mothers to their wives. And, finally, there is\na positive correlation between husbands' housework time and reported marital\nsatisfaction of both wives and husbands.\nDemographic Research: Volume 27, Article 24\n716 http://www.demographic-research.org\n9.
