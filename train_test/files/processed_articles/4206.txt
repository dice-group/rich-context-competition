Sociologists and anthropologists have pointed\nto the highly contextual aspects that shape human-\ndata encounters, including their specificities and con-\ntingencies (for example, Nafus, 2014; Taylor et al.,\n2014). Other researchers have identified a growing\nconcern among citizens about data privacy and secur-\nity (Madden and Rainie, 2015; Pew Research Center,\n2014). Everyday data practices remain under-\ntheorised, however: particularly in relation to how\npeople conceptualise, gain purchase on and perform\nthe data assemblages that are generated by and for\nthem. In this commentary, in attempting to identify\nand think through some of the ways in which socio-\ncultural theory may contribute to understandings of\ndata practices, I develop an argument that rests lar-\ngely on the work of two scholars in the field of sci-\nence and technology studies: Donna Haraway and\nAnnemarie Mol.\nHaraway: Digital assemblages\nas companion species\nI begin with Haraway, as the legacy of her writing\nunderpins some of Mol's work. Haraway's work has\noften attempted `to find descriptive language that\nnames emergent ontologies' (Haraway, 2015: np).\nI use her ideas here in the spirit of developing new\nterms and concepts to describe people's encounters\nwith digital data. Haraway emphasises that humans\ncannot be separated from nonhumans conceptually,\nas we are constantly interacting with other animals\nand material objects as we go about our daily lives.\nHer writings on the figure of the cyborg (for example,\nhave been influential in conceptualising human and\ncomputer technological encounters. In this work,\nHaraway draws attention to the idea that human\nNews & Media Research Centre, University of Canberra, Australia\nCorresponding author:\nDeborah Lupton, University of Canberra, Bldg 9, Faculty of Arts &\nDesign, Bruce, Australian Capital Territory 2601, Australia.\nEmail: deborah.lupton@canberra.edu.au\nBig Data & Society\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nbds.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons NonCommercial-NoDerivs CC-BY-NC-ND: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Com-\nmons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/) which permits\nnon-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work as published without adaptation or alteration, without further permission provided the\noriginal work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\nontologies must be understood as multiple and dynamic\nrather than fixed and essential, as blurring boundaries\nbetween nature and culture, human and nonhuman,\nself and other. She contends that actors, whether\nhuman or nonhuman, are never pre-established;\nrather they emerge through relational encounters\n(Bhavnani and Haraway, 1994). The cyborg metaphor\nencapsulates this idea, not solely in relation to human\u00ad\ntechnology assemblages, but to any interaction of\nhumans with nonhumans.\nThis perspective already provides a basis for think-\ning through the emergent ontologies of digital data\nassemblages. Haraway's musings on human and non-\n2015) also have resonance for how we might under-\nstand these assemblages. Haraway uses the term `com-\npanion species' to describe the relationships that the\nhuman species has not only with other animal species\nbut also with technologies. Humans are companion\nspecies with the nonhumans alongside which they live\nand engage, each species learning from and influencing\nthe other, co-evolving. Haraway (2015) refers to com-\npanion species as `post-cyborg entities', acknowledging\nthe development of her thinking since her original\ncyborg exegesis.\nThis trope of companion species may be taken up to\nthink about the ways in which humans generate,\nmaterialise and engage with digital data. Thrift (2014)\nhas described the new `hybrid beings' that are com-\nprised of digital data and human flesh. Adopting\nHaraway's companion species trope allows for the\nextension of this idea by acknowledging the liveliness\nof digital data and the relational nature of our inter-\nactions with these data. Haraway has commented in a\nlecture that she has learned\nthrough my own inhabiting of the figure of the cyborg\nabout the non-anthropomorphic agency and the liveli-\nness of artifacts. The kind of sociality that joins\nhumans and machines is a sociality that constitutes\nboth, so if there is some kind of liveliness going on\nhere it is both human and non-human. Who humans\nare ontologically is constituted out of that relationality.\nThis observation goes to the heart of how we might\nbegin to theorise the liveliness of digital data in the\ncontext of our own vitality, highlighting the relational-\nity and sociality that connect them.\nThese aspects of digital data assemblages are per-\nhaps becoming even more pronounced as the Internet\nof Things develops and humans become just one node\nin a network of software, digital data repositories and\nsmart objects that configure and exchange digital\ndata with each other. Humans move around in\ndata-saturated environments and can wear personalised\ndata-generating devices on their bodies; including not\nonly their smartphones but objects such as sensor-\nembedded wristbands, clothing or watches. The devices\nthat we carry with us literally are our companions: in\nthe case of smartphones regularly touched, fiddled with\nand looked at throughout the day. In distinction from\nprevious technological prostheses, mobile and wearable\ndevices are also invested with and send out continuous\nflows of personal information. They have become the\nrepositories of users' communications with others, geo-\nlocation information, personal images, biometric infor-\nmation and more. These devices also leak data\noutwards, transmitting them to computing cloud\nservers.\nAll this is happening in real-time and continuously,\nand in some cases without the users' knowledge or con-\nsent. This raises important questions about the security\nand privacy of the very intimate information that these\ndevices generate, transmit and archive (Seneviratne\nissues concerning data ownership are also emerging.\nCritical data scholars have identified the asymmetries\nin the access of citizens to digital datasets (including\ntheir personal data) and that of government and com-\nmercial entities (Andrejevic, 2013; Crawford and\nLike companion species and their humans, digital\ndata are lively combinations of nature/culture. Digital\ndata are lively in several ways. They are about life itself\n(details about humans and other living species); they\nare constantly generated and regenerated as well as\npurposed and repurposed as they enter into the digital\nknowledge economy; they have potential impacts on\nhumans' and other species' lives; and their commercial\nand research value contributes to livelihoods (Lupton,\n2016). Just as digital data assemblages are comprised of\nspecific information points about people's lives, and\nthus learn from people as algorithmic processes\nmanipulate this personal information, people in turn\nlearn from the assemblages of which they are a part.\nThe book or potential dating partner choices that\nAmazon and OKCupid offer, the ads that are delivered\nto users on Facebook or Twitter, the returns that are\nlisted from search engine queries or browsing histories,\nthe information that fitness trackers provide about\nusers' heart rate or calories burnt each day are all cus-\ntomised to the users' digitised behaviours and prefer-\nences. Perusing these data can provide people with\ninsights about themselves and may structure their\nfuture behaviour.\nThe companion species trope recognises the inevit-\nability of our relationship with our digital data assem-\nblages and the importance of learning to live together\nand to learn from each other. It suggests both the\n2 Big Data & Society\nvitality of these assemblages and also the possibility of\ndeveloping a productive relationship, recognising our\nmutual dependency. We may begin to think about\nour digital data assemblages as companion species\nthat have a life of their own that is beyond our com-\nplete control.\nThese proliferating digital data companion species,\nas they are ceaselessly configured and reconfigured,\nemerge beyond our bodies/selves and into the wild of\ndigital data economies and circulations. They are pur-\nposed and repurposed by second and third parties and\neven more actors beyond our reckoning as they are\nassembled and reassembled. In effect, they are digital\ndata-human assemblages. Even as our digital data com-\npanion species engage in their own lives, they are still\npart of us and we remain part of them. We may interact\nwith them or not; we may be allowed access to them or\nnot; we may be totally unaware of them or we may\nengage in purposeful collection and use of them. They\nhave implications for our lives in a rapidly growing\narray of contexts, from the international travel we are\nallowed to undertake to the insurance premiums, job\noffers, discounts or credit we are offered (Crawford and\nMol: Eating digital data\nThe work of Annemarie Mol offers an additional con-\nceptual framework with which to understand digital\ndata practices at a more detailed level while still retain-\ning the companion species perspective. Mol advocates\nfor the use of ontologies as a structuring concept in\ndeveloping understanding of the relationship between\nhumans, technologies and knowledge practices. Her\nfocus is on the performative nature of knowledge, or\nhow these knowledge assemblages are enacted in prac-\ntices and configure different versions of objects, hence\ncreating different ontologies of these objects.\nIf digital data\u00adhuman assemblages are positioned as\nobjects, Mol's emphasis on multiple and shifting ontol-\nogies is a basis for further theoretical work on lively\ndata. Mol has developed a framework that incorporates\nelements of enquiry that can be mapped onto the topic\nof digital data practices. These include the following:\nunderstanding language/discourse and its context and\neffects; tracing the development and use of objects of\nknowledge as they become objects-in-practice;\nacknowledging the dynamic nature of processes and\nthe `endless tinkering' that is involved in processes;\nincorporating awareness of the topologies or sites and\nspaces in which phenomena are generated and used;\nand finally, directing attention to the lived experiences\nor engagements in which practices and objects are\nunderstood and employed (see, for example, Mol,\nIf this approach is applied to digital data practices\nand their configurations, then focusing attention on the\nlanguage that is employed to describe digital data,\nviewing digital data as objects that have both discursive\nand material effects and that are constantly changing,\nrecognising the processes of tinkering (experimenting,\nadapting) that occur in relation to digital data and the\nspaces in which these processes take place are all\nimportant to developing an understanding of the ontol-\nogy of digital data and our relationship with them.\nMol's (2002) concept of `the body multiple' has res-\nonances with the Haraway's cyborg ontology. This con-\ncept recognises that the human body is comprised of\nmany different practices, sites and knowledges. While\nthe body itself is not fragmented or multiple, the phe-\nnomena that make sense of it and represent it do so in\nmany different ways so that the body is lived and\nexperienced in different modes. Her research on a par-\nticular medical condition, atherosclerosis, demon-\nstrated that multiple ways of seeing, monitoring and\ntreating a medical condition (or the different actor net-\nworks that cohere around and in response to the con-\ndition) generate different versions and lived experiences\nof this condition (Mol, 2002). So too, the digital data\u00ad\nhuman assemblages that are configured by human\nusers' interactions with digital technologies are different\nversions of people's identities and bodies that have\nmaterial effects on their ways of living and conceptua-\nlising themselves. Part of the work of people's data\npractices is negotiating the multiple bodies and selves\nthat these assemblages represent and configure.\nMol's writings on human subjectivity also have\nimplications for understanding data practices and inter-\npretations. In her essay entitled `I eat an apple', Mol\npoints out that once a foodstuff has been swallowed,\nthe human subject loses control over what happens to\nthe content of the food in her body as the processes of\ndigestion take place. As she notes, the body is busily\nresponding to the food, but the individual herself has\nno control over this: `Her actorship is distributed and\nher boundaries are neither firm nor fixed' (Mol, 2008:\n40). The eating subject is able to choose what food she\ndecides to eat, but after this point, her body decides\nhow to deal with the components of the food, selecting\ncertain elements and discarding others.\nThis raises questions about human agency and sub-\njectivity. In the statement `I eat an apple', comments\nMol, is the agency in the `I' or in the apple? Humans\nmay grow, harvest and eat apples, but without food-\nstuffs such as apples, humans would not exist.\nFurthermore, once the apple is chewed and swallowed,\nit then becomes part of and absorbed into the eater's\nbody. It is impossible to determine what is human and\nfore, is semi-permeable, neither completely closed off\nnor completely open to the world. Mol then goes on to\nquery at what stage the apple becomes part of her, and\nwhether the category of the human subject might rec-\nognise the apple as `yet another me, a subject in its own\nshaped by years of cultivation by humans into the\nforms in which they now exist. In fact, they may be\nviewed as a form of Haraway's companion species.\nHow then do we draw boundaries around the body/\nself and the apple? How is the human subject to be\ndefined?\nTo extend Mol's analogy, the human subject may be\nconceptualised as both data-ingesting and data-\nemitting in an endless cycle of generating data, bringing\nthe data into the self, generating yet more data. Data\nare absorbed into the body/self and then become new\ndata that flow out of the body/self into the digital data\neconomy. The data-eating/emitting subject, therefore,\nis not closed off but is open to taking in and letting\nout digital data. These data become part of the\nhuman subject. Data assemblages also represent the\nindividual in multiple ways that have different\nmeanings based on their contexts and uses. Just as\neating an apple has many meanings, depending on the\nsocial, cultural, political, historical and geographical\ncontexts in which this act takes place, generating and\nresponding to digital data about oneself are highly con-\ntingent acts.\nFurther questions\nDrawing on Haraway and Mol, a new set of questions\nare generated when thinking about digital data\u00adhuman\nentanglements. If we adopt Haraway's companion spe-\ncies trope, we might ask the following: What are our\naffective responses to our digital data companion spe-\ncies? Do we love or hate them, or simply feel indifferent\nto them? What are the contexts for these responses?\nHow do we live with our digital data companion spe-\ncies? How do they live with us? How do our lives inter-\nsect with them? What do they learn from us, and what\ndo we learn from them? What is the nature of their own\nlives as they move around the digital data economy?\nHow are we influenced by them? How much can we\ndomesticate or discipline them? How do they domesti-\ncate or discipline us? How does each species co-evolve?\nAlternatively, using Mol's concepts of the eating\nsubject, we might wonder: If digital data are never\n`raw' but rather are always `cooked' (that is, always\nunderstood and experienced via social and cultural pro-\ncesses) (Gitelman and Jackson, 2013), and may indeed\nbe `rotted' or spoilt in some way (Boellstorff, 2013), can\nwe also understand them as `eaten' and `digested'?\nWhat happens when we ingest/absorb digital data\nabout ourselves? Do we recognise some data as `food'\n(appropriate for such ingestion) and others as `non-\nfood' (not appropriate in some way for our use)? Are\nsome data simply indigestible (our bodies/selves do not\nrecognise them as us and cannot incorporate them)?\nHow are the flavours and tastes of digital data experi-\nenced, and what differentiates these flavours and tastes?\nWhat role does human agency play in relation to\nnonhuman agency in the configuration of the digital\ndata\u00adhuman assemblage?\nTaken together, these questions have implications\nfor research focusing on the nature of digital data\u00ad\nhuman assemblages and practices. Both Haraway and\nMol emphasised the political implications of their\nwork. Haraway's cyborg theorising was developed to\nexplain her socialist feminist principles. In all of her\nwork she emphasises the importance of paying atten-\ntion as critical scholars to the exacerbation of socio-\neconomic disadvantage and inequalities that may be\noutcomes of these relationships. Mol similarly notes\nthe political nature of technologies. In her `I eat an\napple' essay, for example, she comments about her dis-\ntaste for Granny Smith apples, once imported from\nChile and therefore associated in her mind with repres-\nsive political regimes. As she notes, while she may eat\nthis type of apple and while it may nourish her body as\nother apples do, she is unable to gain sensory pleasure\nfrom it.\nData science writings on Big Data often fail to\nacknowledge the political dimensions of digital data.\nThey do not see how data are always already\n`cooked', or how their flavour or digestibility are influ-\nenced by their context. Just as `eating apples is vari-\nculture, social relations and politics, resulting in differ-\nent flavours and pleasures, so too eating data is con-\ntextual. Like Haraway's cyborg figuration (see her\ninterview with Gane, 2006), the digital data\u00adhuman\nassemblage may be viewed both as a product of\nglobal enterprise and capitalism and as representing\npossibilities for radical creative and political\npossibilities.\nPerhaps critical digital data scholars could adopt an\napproach from `multispecies ethnographies' (Kirksey\nand Helmreich, 2010) in attempting to research the\nentanglements of humans and their digital companion\nspecies, by investigating the nature of co-humanity and\nthe co-evolution of these species, their symbiotic inter-\nminglings and becomings and their `mutual ecologies\nand coproduced niches' (Kirksey and Helmreich,\npolitical nature of these entanglements to the fore, by\nasking such questions as: What are the mutual ecolo-\ngies and coproduced niches of digital data-human\nassemblages? Who wields power over how these ecolo-\ngies and niches are configured and experienced and who\n4 Big Data & Society\nare allowed entre\n\u00b4 e to them? How are digital data prac-\ntices and technologies enacted as political modes of\nengagement within these ecologies and niches?\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAndrejevic M (2013) Infoglut: How Too Much Information is\nChanging the Way We Think and Know.
