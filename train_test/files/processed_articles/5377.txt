A convenience sample of 774 undergraduate students was\nrecruited.Analysis was based on gender, culture, and educational speciality, as seen through the integrated lens of a social\necological and feminist theory model.The results showed that a substantial percentage of all participants had never received\nany education or training on DV in their undergraduate programs.The majority of participants had good knowledge about\nDV, and half of the participants believed that DV is \"common\" in their respective countries. Significant gender and cultural\ndifferences in the definition of DV were also revealed, with Northern Irish students and female students in both cultures\nmore likely to regard a range of behaviors as a form of DV.The research findings suggest several potential directions for\nchange, emphasizing the importance of establishing a systematic evidence-based multidisciplinary and interagency approach\nto teaching and learning for student health care professionals on the topic of DV in their undergraduate programs.\n",

Even though domestic\nviolence (DV) is now recognized as a major public health\nconcern, many health and social care professionals have been\nslow to respond to address the issue. Evidence suggests that\nhealth and social care professionals, who are equipped with\nthe relevant knowledge and skills, can play a key role in the\ndevelopment of strategies and resources to combat DV\n(Feder, Hutson, Ramsay, & Taket, 2006). However, research\nillustrates that primary health care professionals are uncover-\ning abuse, such as DV, at much lower rates than that being\nreflected by the prevalence estimates reported in the literature\nrates have been attributed to inappropriate attitudes of pri-\nmary health care professionals toward victims of violence\nand abuse, together with a general lack of information and\nLiterature Review\nOne of the most common and dangerous forms of violence\nis DV, or domestic abuse. DV is a serious health problem\nthat is common to all societies and is linked to immediate\nand longer term health, social, and economic consequences\n(Goodwin, Hoven, Murison, & Hotopf, 2003; Krug,\nDahlberg, & Mercy, 2002). A lack of reliable statistical data\n(Johnson, Haider, Ellis, Hay, & Lindow, 2003; Richardson et\nal., 2002) and the variance in definition of this violence and\nabuse make it difficult to estimate the true extent of the prob-\nlem (Marchant, Davidson, Garcia, & Parsons, 2001). It is\noften hidden, secret, and undisclosed as well as a primary\ncause of gender-specific inequalities (Lazenbatt, Thompson-\n1Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan\n2Queen's University Belfast, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nNahla Mansour Al-Ali, Community and Mental Health Department,\nJordanian University of Science and Technology, P.O.

DV may be a combination of physical, sex-\nual, emotional, or psychological abuse, resulting in various\nhealth consequences ranging from physical injury to death.\nMost consequences can lead to an increased use of medical\nThe ongoing underidentification and lack of understanding\nabout DV call for a closer look at undergraduate primary\nhealth care professionals' knowledge, education, and train-\ning needs to deal with this serious public health issue.\nDefinitions andTerminology\nDiscussion of DV in general, and in specific contexts in\nparticular, calls for a thorough examination of the meaning,\nattributed to the term violence (Winstok, 2007). There is\nlittle consensus among researchers on exactly how to define\nthe terms violence and abuse. However, these terms are used\ndifferently, by different disciplines, and also by lay persons\nThe terms violence against women and gender-based vio-\nlence are used in this article and both stem from the follow-\ning definition as provided by Article 1 of the UN Declaration\non the Elimination of Violence Against Women (DEVW,\n1993), which defines the term violence against women as:\n\"Any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is\nlikely to result in physical, sexual or psychological\nharm or suffering to women, including threats of such\nacts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty,\nwhether occurring in public or in private life.\"\nThere is a significant discrepancy among different cul-\ntural definitions of what constitutes \"DV\" (Sokoloff &\nDupont, 2005); there appears to be no universally accepted\ndefinition of DV as definitions used internationally and\nnationally can vary substantially (Bradley, Smith, Long, &\nO'Dowd, 2002; Verhoek-Oftedahl, Pearlman, & Coutu\nof the behaviors that are associated with DV and the driving\nforces underlying those behaviors reflect considerable varia-\ntion across cultures (Malley-Morrison, 2004). Cross-cultural\ninvestigations of DV are urged to carefully consider the lan-\nguage used, as it may be inadequate to allow for a full explo-\nration of the relevant issues around DV (Fern\u00e1ndez, 2006).\nFor the purpose of the study, \"DV\" is defined as:\n\"any violence against women which includes not just\nphysical, but verbal, psychological, emotional, eco-\nnomic, and sexual patterns of behaviors, by their male\npartners, whose aim is to control, threaten, isolate,\nand/or exploit women.\"\nSuch a broad definition of DV incorporates the various\nforms of oppression and violation that women experience\nwithin a social-cultural context.\nIntegrated Social Ecological and FeministTheory\nTwo interlinking theoretical frameworks--the social\necological theory and the feminist theory--are adopted in\nthis study to explain the approach of primary health care\nprofessionals toward DV (see Figure 1). The social\necological theory conceptualizes DV as a multifaceted\nphenomenon grounded in interplay, between individual,\nfamily, community, and societal factors, and is best visual-\nized as concentric circles (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Heise,\n1998). Feminist theory, on the other hand, attributes\nwomen abuse to the fundamental issues of unequally\ndistributed power and culturally based gender relational\npatterns and patriarchal social patterns (Dobash & Dobash,\nThis approach is helpful in explaining the differences\nbetween the modernized societies such in the United\nKingdom and Northern Ireland (NI), and more traditional\nArab and Jordan societies, in which these cultures have dif-\nferent social, cultural, legal, and political structures.\nRecently, there has been an overall international trend\ntoward a more unified theoretical perspective, leaning heav-\nily on an integrated feminist understanding of the social\nconstruction and dynamics of power relations (Muhlbauer,\n2006). Feminist scholars believe that the patriarchal nature\nFigure 1. Pathways to health care professionals' approach of\nviolence against women: using an integrated social ecological\nmodel and feminist theory\nAl-Ali and Lazenbatt 3\nof society, through its emphasis on traditional gender role\nsocialization, plays an important role in the prevalence of\nDV (Smith, 1990). In this sense, feminist theory does not\nlimit causes of DV to psychological and microsociological\nfactors but considers society's explicit and implicit rules\nthat legitimize violence under certain circumstances\n(Abraham, 1995). Accordingly, men's power, domination,\nand privileges over women inherent in any society are con-\nsidered as a cause of domestic abuse. Hence, ending this\nabuse would require a basic restructuring of the nature of\nthe power relations between men and women in society\nThe importance of an integrated social ecological model\nand feminist theory is that \"it views behaviour as being\naffected by, and affecting the social environment\" (McLeroy,\nBibeau, Steckler, & Glanz, 1998). For primary health care\nprofessionals, this view is important because it provides an\nopportunity to design a range of health promotion strategies\ntargeting multiple levels within the social environment. The\nholistic view of behavior, proposed by integrating a social\necological model with feminist theory, permits primary\nhealth care professionals to focus their attention to different\ntypes of social influences and power dynamics, for which\nthey can develop appropriate interventions to modify health-\nrelated behaviors (Little & Kantor, 2002).\nPrevalence and Incidence\nWorldwide, 1 in every 3 women suffers from DV, has been\nbeaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise been abused in her\nindicated that 1 in 20 women have experienced one or more\nincidents of partner abuse in the last year (Walby & Allen,\nof Health, Social Services and Public Safety, 2005).\nIn Arab countries, many forms of VAW exist and are per-\npetuated by the deep-rooted sociocultural factors. In Jordan,\nalthough there are no studies on the rates of DV, the National\nInstitute of Forensic Medicine states that around 750 women\nper year visit a forensic medical clinic in Amman, after suf-\nfering DV (Amnesty International Jordan, 2004). However,\nit is estimated that the actual number of victims could be 10\ntimes higher. Worryingly, less than 10% of abused women\nare identified by professionals within health care settings\nPrimary Health Care Professional\nApproaches to DV\nThe health care system is often the first place outside of\nfriends and family to which victims of domestic abuse turn,\nthus placing health care professionals in a central role of\nassistance and support (Ramsay, Richardson, Carter,\nmost primary health care professionals, including nurses,\ndentists, and doctors, have traditionally received little pro-\nfessional preparation on how to intervene and support\nwomen living with DV (Bacchus, Mezey, & Bewley, 2003;\nH\u00e4ggblom, Hallberg, & M\u00f6ller, 2005). These professionals\nhave also received limited education or training in this area\nduring their undergraduate training, or continuing profes-\nsional development (Lazenbatt et al., 2005). Therefore, core\ncompetencies in screening, recognizing, and treating the\nshort- and long-term manifestations of domestic abuse are\nincreasingly expected as the standard for health care profes-\nsionals. However, to assess and intervene appropriately,\nprimary health care professionals must have current evi-\ndence-based knowledge about DV, including communica-\ntion skills, and attitudes necessary to ask enquiring questions;\nthe ability to offer appropriate information for intervention\nand referral; and to make referrals to support networks and\ncommunity resources (Paluzzi & Houde-Quimby, 1996).\nAlthough the evidence base is rapidly expanding on\nprotocols for the identification and management of women\nsuffering from DV, there is no published work on the identi-\nfication of undergraduate university students' knowledge,\ndefinitions, and education and training regarding domestic\nabuse, particularly those from a primary health care back-\nground (Sugg, Thompson, Thompson, Maiuro, & Rivara,\nto suggest that these undergraduate primary health care stu-\ndents do not receive enough educational training about DV\n(Naumann, Langford, Torres, Campbell, & Glass, 1999),\nwithin the higher education curriculum, to allow them to\nrecognize and deal with domestic abuse in their future pro-\nfessional practice. For these students to enter their profes-\nsional practice feeling confident that they have an important\nrole in the supportive treatment for DV, they need to receive\ncomprehensive, integrated, multidisciplinary education dur-\ning their university undergraduate programs.\nA need exists to build up the international evidence base\nsurrounding university primary health care professional stu-\ndents' knowledge, education, and training experiences.\nInvestigating the training experiences of undergraduate\nhealth care students from NI and Jordan will enable the\ndevelopment of a culturally sensitive program. This will\nallow the development of health professionals who will be\nable to adopt a knowledgeable, evidence-based, and realistic\nmanner with regard to the management of women who have\nexperienced DV across countries that are diverse in terms of\nculture, economics, and sociopolitical development.\nMethod\nDesign\nA cross-sectional, comparative survey design is used to pro-\nvide evidence of differences in terms of culture, gender, and\ntheir educational speciality.\n4 SAGE Open\nSample. A convenience sample consisting of 774 students\nmately 80% completed the questionnaire. In all, 63%\n178) medical students. The age of the participants ranged\nwere female; and 87% were single, 8% married, and 4%\nwere divorced, widowed, or cohabiting at the time of the\nstudy. With regard to the religious affiliation, 58% of the\nparticipants were Muslims, and the remaining 38% were\nChristians. The majority of the participants were Jordanian\n(84%) for the Jordan sample and White (98%) for the NI\nsample (Table 1). Both cultural groupings (NI and Jordan)\nwere surveyed in large classes; however, neither of these\ngroups is expected to be representative of the population at\nlarge nor of students as a whole.\nInstrument\nA self-administered questionnaire \"Students' Knowledge\nand Attitudes of Violence and Abuse Scale\" developed and\nbased on the following items was used to measure the differ-\nent variables of the study.\nDemographic variables. This includes questions on the\nsample demographic data, such as age, gender, religion, eth-\nnicity, marital status, place of residence, university, and\nschool attended.\nStudents' definition of DV. This section included one ques-\ntion utilizing a checklist, describing the various evidence-\nbased behaviors indicated as examples of DV. Participants\nwere asked to tick the behaviors that they felt indicated DV\nor abuse.\nStudents' training and educational experience of DV. This\nsection consisted of five questions designed by the researcher\nto measure the participants' previous education and training\nwith respect to DV against women. First, students were\nasked four questions: \"whether they had attended any\ncourses/seminars that had addressed DV within their\nundergraduate program,\" \"whether these were part of their\nundergraduate program,\" \"whether they had attended any\ncourses/seminars that had addressed DV outside the univer-\nsity,\" and \"whether they had listened and/or watched media\ncoverage program,\" using \"yes/no\" as answers. Second, the\nstudents were asked to identify the extent of DV material\nbeing taught in their current curricula, using a rating scale\nformat of \"a great deal,\" \"occasional mention,\" \"very little if\nany,\" \"unsure,\" and \"not at all.\"\nStudents' attitudes toward primary health care professionals\nneeds for education and training on DV. This section consisted\nof a 4-item scale, designed to assess participants' attitudes\ntoward the need for education and training of primary health\ncare professionals in their undergraduate program. Responses\nto these items were based on a 4-point Likert-type scale\n(from 1 = strongly agree to 4 = strongly disagree).\nStudents' knowledge of DV. This section included two\nparts: The first consisted of 12 questions developed by the\nresearcher, and based on the evidence-based literature, to\nassess students' knowledge of DV. The questions were\nfocused on the impact of the DV on women's physical, psy-\nchological, and reproductive health status; the common\ncited risk factors; and the impact of DV on children's physi-\ncal and emotional health. Responses to these questions were\nbased on true/false/don't know format. The second part\nincluded one question to assess participants' knowledge of\nthe prevalence and the extent of DV in their home country,\nusing a rating format of \"very common,\" \"common,\" \"rare,\"\n\"very rare,\" and \"don't know.\"\nTranslation and piloting of the questionnaire. The question-\nnaire was first constructed in English and used in its original\nform for data collection in NI. After the English version was\ndeveloped, checked, and revised, it was translated into the\nArabic language and used for data collection in Jordan. The\nquestionnaire was pilot tested on undergraduate primary\nhealth care professional students in NI and Jordan and, on\nthe basis of the pilot test, the wording of the questionnaire\nwas revised to enhance readability and content validity.\nTable 1. Demographic Characteristics of the Sample\nVariables Category n (%) n (%) n (%)\nNote: NI = Northern Ireland; n = number of participants; (%) = percentage of participants.\nAl-Ali and Lazenbatt 5\nData Collection\nData were obtained by a means of the self-administered\nquestionnaire as it allows complete respondent anonymity.\nThe researcher distributed the research materials, including\nthe questionnaires, consent forms, information sheets, and\nother informational pamphlets to the student cohort. Upon\ntheir arrival at class, the students were informed that partici-\npation in all parts of the study was voluntary and that they\ncould discontinue their participation at any time, without\npenalty. The students were provided with information packs\nwithin sealed envelopes that included contact numbers, self-\nhelp groups, anonymous phone lines, and addresses of local\npsychological support services or crisis centers for anyone\nwho may be exposed to DV.\nEthical Considerations\nPrior to the onset of the proposed study, ethical approval was\nsought from the Office of Research Ethics Committee of\nNorthern Ireland (NI-OREC) to pursue the current research\nin NI. In Jordan, approval was sought by the researcher who\napproached each faculty before conducting the study.\nParticipants in this study were treated according to the stan-\ndard of ethics committee for conducting research.\nData Analysis\nData from each questionnaire was coded and entered into a\ndatabase. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS for\nWindows 14.0 version software package, and included\ndescriptive, chi-square tests, t tests, and two-way ANOVA.\nResults\nPrimary Health Care Students' Definitions of DV\nSignificant differences were found between the two cul-\ntural groups when asked to define DV. Table 2 shows the\npercentage of respondents for each culture and gender who\nindicated that the illustrated behaviors indicated an exam-\nple of DV. For all behaviors listed, there were significant\ndifferences between the two groups. Students in NI were\nmore likely than Jordanian students to label DV with all the\nlisted behaviors. For the most part, there were significant\ndifferences between females and males in each culture. An\nimportant difference between genders is that female stu-\ndents in NI were significantly more likely than male stu-\ndents to view verbal abuse, financial abuse, and controlling\nbehavior as a form of DV. In Jordan, female students were\nsignificantly more likely than male students to view verbal\nabuse, emotional abuse, financial abuse, intimidation, and\ncontrolling behavior as a form of DV.\nEducational andTraining Experience\nEighty-nine percent of all participants (n = 692) reported\nthat they had not attended lectures or seminars related to DV\nat university. Only 11% of all participants (n = 82) stated\nthat they had attended lectures or seminars at university, and\nof those respondents, only 7% (n = 55) indicated that these\nlectures were part of their undergraduate program. Although,\n85% of all participants (n = 658) never attended lectures or\nseminars outside of the university, 88% of them had watched\nor listened to media coverage program about the topic of\nDV. There were significant differences observed among stu-\ndents who had attended lectures outside of their university.\nThis reflects the fact that Jordanian students were more\nlikely than NI students to attend lectures or seminars outside\nthe university as illustrated in Table 3.\nSignificant differences were also revealed among stu-\ndents who reported attending lectures at university as a part\nlectures attended by NI students (9%, n = 28/30) were more\nlikely to be part of their undergraduate program than by stu-\ndents in Jordan (6%, n = 27/52). With regard to educational\nspecialties, the results showed that nursing students were\nmore likely than medical or dental students to attend lectures\nTable 2. Differences in the Definition of DomesticViolence Between Culture and Gender\n\nMale\nFemale\n(n = 278) Significant chi-square\nMale\nFemale\n(n = 215) Significant chi-square\nNote: NI = Northern Ireland.\n6 SAGE Open\nMoreover, nursing students showed greater exposure to the\ntopic of DV through media programs rather than medical\nthe students were asked about the extent of DV being taught\nin their undergraduate education programs, 44% of all the\nparticipants reported \"very little if any,\" 40% \"not at all,\"\nand 20% \"occasional mentions,\" and only 3% of all partici-\npants reported \"a great deal.\" Significant differences were\n.001, with NI students reporting \"very little if any\" more fre-\nquently than students in Jordan as shown in Figure 2.\nPrimary health care professionals' attitudes to the need for\neducation and training on DV. Almost all participants showed\nfavorable attitudes toward the need of primary health care\nprofessionals for education and training on DV within their\npercent of the students strongly agreed, or agreed, with the\nstatement that \"primary health care professionals need edu-\ncation on the topic of DV,\" 85% strongly agreed that \"DV\nagainst women as a topic should be integrated into nursing,\ndental, and medical undergraduate programs,\" and 94%\nstrongly agreed with the statements that \"training on recog-\nnition of DV should be included in undergraduate programs\"\nand \"training on the management of DV should be included\nin undergraduate programs\" (see Table 4).\nAmong students in Jordan, two-way ANOVA revealed\nonly significant main effect for the educational specialty,\ning students differed significantly from medical students.\nThis indicated that medical students had more favorable atti-\ntudes (M = 6.2) than nursing students (M = 6.95). All other\ngroup comparisons did not reach statistical significance.\nPrimary health care students' knowledge of DV. With respect\nto the knowledge that students had on the topic of DV, on\naverage, all students demonstrated a good knowledge (M =\n10 out of 12 questions correctly, and half of the participants\n(50%) answered at least 9 questions correctly. More specifi-\ncally, 73% of all participants believed that DV at home\ncauses more physical injury to women than violence by\nstrangers, with 82% believing that women evaluate emo-\ntional abuse as worse than physical abuse. With regard to the\nquestion \"`when is DV against women likely to stop,\" 60%\nof all participants believed that DV is unlikely to stop during\npregnancy and postnatally, and 53% believed that it is\nunlikely to stop even after the woman leaves her abusive\nhusband. Furthermore, 93% and 83% of all participants\nbelieved that alcohol and substance abuse, and long-term\nunemployment, respectively, were used as an excuse for DV.\nMoreover, 87% of all participants believed that psychologi-\ncal stress was often used as an excuse for DV.\nMoreover, there were significant differences revealed\nfemale students in both cultures had greater knowledge of\nthe topic of DV than their male counterparts (see Table 5).\nHowever, there were no significant differences in the\nknowledge between genders across cultures. In relation to\neducational specialty, the only significant differences were\nTable 3.

As the post hoc tests\nrevealed, nursing students (M = 8.18) had higher scores in\nknowledge than dental students (M = 7.68).\nAmong students in Jordan, the results revealed significant\nknowledge. The results indicate that female students (M =\n8.67) had higher scores in knowledge than male students (M\n= 7.88). In relation to educational specialty, post hoc tests\nrevealed that nursing students (M = 8.5) differed signifi-\ncantly from medical students (M = 8.0), demonstrating that\nmedical students had lower scores in knowledge than nurs-\ning students.\nPrimary health care students' knowledge of prevalence of DV.\nOf all participants, 49% (n = 379) reported that the preva-\nlence of DV in their respective countries is \"common,\" 25%\n\"very common,\" 12% \"rare,\" and only 6% stated \"don't\nknow\" as illustrated in Table 6. Significant differences were\nThese findings indicate that Jordanian students tend to\nacknowledge the prevalence of DV in their country as \"com-\nmon\" more often than those in the NI sample. In addition,\nthere was a significant difference between gender in Jordan,\nthan male students to report the prevalence as \"common.\"\nMoreover, medical students (38%) in both cultures were\nmore likely than nursing students (19%) to report the preva-\nlence as \"very common\"; however, dental students (31%)\nwere less likely than medical students to report \"very\ncommon.\"\nDiscussion\nThis study explained the undergraduate health care profes-\nsionals' approaches to DV and abuse through the lens of the\nsocial ecological model and feminist theory. In this study,\nstudents' definitions of DV, their knowledge about the sever-\nity, prevalence of DV, and their training and educational\nexperiences were tested.\nFrom the social ecological perspective of health care pro-\nfessionals' approach to DV, numerous studies have shown\nthat the disposition of health care professionals involved in\nassessment and identification of abused women is largely\ninfluenced by their definition of the problem (Gerbert et al.,\nin the definition of DV revealed by this study are consistent\nwith the results of previous studies which have shown that\nTable 4.

Likewise, the female and\nmale students in Jordan defined DV to reflect their patriar-\nchal beliefs about women and VAW.\nAlthough this study shows that the student health care\nprofessionals' definition of DV reflected their considerable\nawareness of the problem and of various patterns of VAW,\ntheir responses also included indications that they are not\nalways willing to consider acts of violence as DV. Overall,\nthe vast majority of the participants in NI and Jordan defined\nmany of the behaviors as DV; however, as physical and sex-\nual violence were likely to be viewed as DV, verbal abuse,\npsychological/emotional, financial abuse, intimidation, and\ncontrolling behaviors were less likely to be perceived as DV\nparticularly by male participants.\nIn this study, female students in both cultures had clearer\nand broader definitions of DV and were more likely than\nmale students to include a range of behavior as a form of DV.\nConsistent with the findings of this study, a study among\nmale and female nurses (Kim & Motsei, 2002) found that,\nunlike the males, females frequently described DV in terms\nof emotional or psychological abuse, and economic abuse\nwas also only raised by women.\nBased on the findings, it is clear that the study sample had\na general lack of educational exposure to the issue of VAW in\ntheir undergraduate educational programs, which is highly\nconsistent with the results presented in the research literature\nresults of this study revealed that almost all respondents had\nfavorable attitudes toward the need for health care profes-\nsionals to receive education and training on DV. Violence-\nrelated curriculum content and health care professionals'\nattitudes about DV and the related learning experiences of\nthe students had been the subject of several recent research\nstudies (Ross, Hoff, & Bunn, 2000, Woodtli & Breslin,\n2002). These studies are primarily based on the premise that\none essential approach to facilitate appropriate care to\nwomen is through professional educational programs that\nprepare health care professionals who are sensitive,\nknowledgeable, and skilled in the care of women and their\nfamilies who have experienced violence. The differences\nbetween specialities revealed in this study were consistent\nwith the results of other studies conducted among health care\nprofessional's students and medical staff (Majumdar, 2004;\nAt the ecological analysis level of approaching DV in\nclinical care settings, lack of knowledge among health care\nprofessionals was reported as a reason for not acting upon\nDV cases (Woodtli, 2000). The findings of this study reveal\nsignificant levels of awareness among all health care\nstudents in their knowledge about the problem of DV.\nInterestingly, this study illustrates that students in Jordan\noverall had more exposure to the topic of DV outside uni-\nversity, whereas students in NI had more formal education\nwithin the university, albeit limited. In the United Kingdom,\nWilliamson (2000) refers to the increase in guidelines\nin Britain for health professionals to deal with DV, yet\nquestions about how such guidelines can be implemented\nwithout staff training designed to address DV and the role of\nhealth care professionals. To provide treatment and support\nto victims of DV, it is crucial to assure these future health\ncare professionals with access to the knowledge, training,\nand skills appropriate to dealing with cases of DV and\nabuse. Nurses, dentists, and doctors must develop skills in\nidentifying abuse cases and an understanding of family vio-\nlence dynamics.\nIn this study, findings indicate that very few of all\nrespondents think DV is uncommon; in fact, it is somewhat\nsurprising to find that health care professionals' students\nare as aware of the prevalence of DV as they are, which is\ninconsistent with other research that has shown that health\ncare professionals often underestimate the rate of DV in\ntheir populations (Lazenbatt et al., 2005; Rabin et al.,\nConclusion\nStudent health care professionals are ideally placed to rec-\nognize and detect ongoing DV, and to offer care, support,\nand information to the woman involved. The greatest limi-\ntation inherent in this study is the inclusion of primarily\nTable 6. Differences in Reporting Prevalence of DomesticViolence Across Cultures and Gender\nVery\ncommon\nNote: NI = Northern Ireland.\nAl-Ali and Lazenbatt 9\nthird-year undergraduate health care professionals' stu-\ndents. This aspect of the study is likely to result in a limited\ngeneralizability to the general population and to under-\ngraduate students in particular. Therefore, it will be neces-\nsary for future studies to include more diversity relative to\nage, ethnicity, educational level, religious background, and\npopulation setting.\nThis study suggests that student health care professionals\nneed to learn a more comprehensive global operational defi-\nnition of DV and abuse (e.g., physical violence, sexual\nassault, emotional/psychological violence, and economic\nabuse). It appears that a more uniform and universal defini-\ntion of DV must be derived to allow for overall comparison\nbetween studies and to allow multiprofessionals to view DV\nfrom the same perspective. This study supports the need for\nstudent undergraduate health professionals to receive sig-\nnificant training and education on VAW in their university\ntraining and educational program. In addition, regular con-\ntinual professional development updates should be available\nfor all health care professionals. By this, the present research\nstudy recommends that student health care professionals\nshould be empowered with a joined up approach that\nincludes an understanding of evidence-based research in the\narea, clear knowledge of support agencies, and interagency\nnetworks and refuges to allow them to give ongoing and\nappropriate information that will in itself empower and sup-\nport women to make their own informed choices.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAbraham, M.
