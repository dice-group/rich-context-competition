    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study analyzed the vulnerability to flooding in Port Harcourt metropolis, Nigeria, by creating vulnerability indices and\ncomparing these indices across the 13 zones that make up Port Harcourt metropolis. The integrated vulnerability assessment\napproach using indicators was adopted. The indicators were grouped into adaptive capacity, sensitivity, and exposure based\non the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change definition of vulnerability. The data on these indicators were obtained\nfrom fieldwork, questionnaire, and map measurements. Principal component analysis was performed to obtain the first\ncomponent scores which were used to weight the variables before calculating the vulnerability indices of the 13 zones. The\nvulnerability indices results show that Mgbuosimiri (Zone K) is relatively the most vulnerable, whereas the least vulnerable\nis Eligbolo (Zone D). Cluster analysis was used to group the different vulnerability indices to produce a vulnerability map\nshowing the spatial pattern of the different flood vulnerability levels (i.e., very high, high, low, and very low vulnerability\nlevels). The spatial pattern of the vulnerability levels increases toward the north west, south west, south, and north east, and\ndecreases toward the central of Port Harcourt. However, the vulnerability map can be used for the reduction of damage\npotential by integrating its outputs into spatial planning and emergency planning.\n",

Floods could also be caused by intrusion of\nsea water onto coast lands during cyclonic/tidal surges\n(Handmer, Penning-Rowsell, & Tapsell, 1999; Stoltman,\nThe terms used to describe flooding are numerous and\nmay mean different things to different scholars with respect\nto the context in which they are used (Brooks, 2003; Brooks,\nAdger, & Kelly, 2005). Social scientists and climate scien-\ntists often mean different things when they use the term \"vul-\nnerability\"; whereas social scientists tend to view\nvulnerability as representing the set of socio-economic fac-\ntors that determine people's ability to cope with stress or\nchange (Allen, 2003), climate scientists often view vulnera-\nbility in terms of the likelihood of occurrence and impacts of\nweather- and climate-related events (Fussel & Klein, 2006;\n2009). Vulnerability as used in this work is those biophysical\nand socio-economic factors that determine people's ability to\ncope with flooding.\nThe occurrence of floods in Nigeria is not a recent phe-\n2006). The recent occurrences of flooding in the country\nMakurdi, Asaba, Ogbaru, Yenegoa and so on, had shown that\nflooding is one of the major environmental problems faced in\nNigeria. Most research works had examined extensively the\ncausal factors and have attributed flooding to topography,\nsoil/vegetation/river alteration, increased heavy rainfall, land\nuse change, and unplanned urbanization (Adeloye & Rustum,\n1University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nThecla I.

Akukwe1 and Chinedu Ogbodo1\n Keywords\nvulnerability, flooding, Port Harcourt, Nigeria\n2 SAGE Open\nParker, 1999). The impacts and effects of flooding have also\nbeen noted to range from submerging roads, obstruction of\ntraffic, coastal erosion, disruption of economic activities,\ndisplacement of people, loss of property, to loss of lives\nScientific studies suggest that climate change is likely to\ncause shifts in the global pattern and intensity of flood events\nin some regions, thereby increasing the exposure of popula-\ntions to severe flooding (Few, 2003), and that the impacts of\nfuture changes in climate extremes are expected to fall dis-\nproportionately on the poor (Intergovernmental Panel on\nStudies on vulnerability to climate change and climate\nrisks, including floods, have been undertaken in different\nFrancisco, 2009). Some excellent conceptual and applied\nwork has emerged in the fields of climate change vulnerabil-\nlenging to convert conceptual and qualitative approaches\ninto a quantitative index of vulnerability (Hinkel, 2011).\nClimate risk and vulnerability mapping have been con-\nducted mostly for the developed countries, but in develop-\ning countries, there however exists a gap in the knowledge\nof vulnerability and coping capacities of African societies\nto flood hazards, where many of recorded flood disasters\nare consequences of natural hazards aggravated by devel-\nopment flaws in affected communities (Adelekan, 2010;\nOlorunfemi, 2011). Nigeria is not an exception; knowledge\nis still sparse in the literature on flood vulnerability map-\nping in the country. However, some studies have been car-\nried out on flood vulnerability assessment in some Nigerian\nareas using different approaches (Ologunorisa, 2004;\nThe study approach of Ologunorisa (2004) was basically an\nassessment of flood vulnerability zones in the Niger Delta\nusing hydrological techniques based on some measurable\nphysical characteristics, whereas Ishaya et al. (2009)\nmapped areas vulnerable to flood hazard in Gwagwalada\nurban area of Abuja using LandsatTM image of 1991 and\nvulnerability characteristics of people to assess the disas-\ntrous Abeokuta flood that occurred in 2007. Hitherto, none\nof these studies provides information on the integrated\nflood assessment in any part of the country. This is unfortu-\nnate, because it has increasingly been acknowledged that an\narea like the Niger Delta region, which experiences peren-\nnial floods owing to its location and low-lying topography,\nand heavy rainfall (Ogba & Utang, 2008; Ologunorisa &\nAbawua, 2005), should have been assessed using the inte-\ngrated method. Port Harcourt is one of such areas consid-\nered to be vulnerable to flooding (Oku, Wichendu, &\nunprecedented flooding which submerged houses, para-\nlyzed economic activities, and rendered some people inter-\nnally displaced in some zones (Zabbey, 2006). Therefore,\nthe need to show the spatial variations to flood vulnerabili-\nties within zones in Port Harcourt metropolis, which will be\nused in emergency planning and policy making, forms the\npurpose of this study.\nObjectives of the Study\nThe objectives of the study are to\n1. examine the socio-economic characteristics and\nadaptive capacities of residents,\n2. examine the sensitivity and exposure indicators used\nin creating the vulnerability for the 13 zones in Port\nHarcourt metropolis,\n3. assess and map the vulnerable areas/zones using both\nbiophysical and socio-economic indicators,\n4. examine the spatial pattern of flood vulnerability lev-\nels in Port Harcourt metropolis, and\n5. suggest measures for reducing future flood vulnera-\nbility in the study area.\nThe Study Area\nLocation\nPort Harcourt metropolis is located between Latitude 4\u00b045'N\n7\u00b005'E in Rivers State. It is a city in the Niger Delta region\nof Nigeria. The city lies at the mouth of River Bonny in\nRivers State. It is located at about 25 km from the Atlantic\nOcean and is situated between the Dockyard creek/Bonny\nRiver and the Amadi creek. It lies at an average altitude of\nabout 12 m above mean sea level. Port Harcourt metropolis\nspans over two local government areas (LGAs) viz Port\nHarcourt and Obio/Akpor (Figure 1 and Figure 2).\nClimate\nThe study area lies within the Koppen Tropical Rainy Af cli-\nmatic zone of the Koppen classification (Koppen, 1936).\nHere, the average temperature for every month is above\n18\u00b0C, and there is adequate moisture in virtually all the\nmonths. Port Harcourt metropolis experiences two seasons,\nthat is, dry and rainy seasons. Temperatures over Port\nHarcourt metropolis are constantly high with a mean maxi-\nmum of about 34\u00b0C and a mean minimum of about 21\u00b0C.\nThe highest temperatures are recorded between the months\nof April and October.\nAkukwe and Ogbodo 3\nFigure 1.

The integrated assessment approach and\nthe indicator method in which both biophysical and socio-\neconomic factors are systemically combined to determine\nvulnerability were adopted in this study to calculate the zonal\nvulnerability indices.

Two exposure indicators were used, these\nare, distance of dwelling units to a major river and height/\ndepth of flood.\nData on the various indicators were collected using ques-\ntionnaire except for those of proximity of dwelling units to a\nriver, which were measured using maps.\nThus, vulnerability to flooding was calculated according\nto Deressa, Hassan, and Ringler (2008) as follows:\nVI Adaptive capacity\nSensitivity Exposure\n= -\n+ ...\n/ /\n/ /\nThis equation was adopted because flooding is one of the\nconsequences of climate change.\nEquation 2 above was expanded as follows:\nVI = / wX +wX +...wX -\nwY +wY ...wY + wZ +wZ +...wZ\n( )\n( ) (\n( ) / ...\nwhere VI is vulnerability index, w are weights of the first\nprincipal component scores, X\n-X\nn\nare adaptive capacity\nAkukwe and Ogbodo 7\nvariables, Y\n-Y\nn\nare sensitivity variables, and Z\n-Z\nn\nare expo-\nData Analysis\nBoth the descriptive and statistical methods of analysis were\nused in this work. SPSS Version 20.0 was used to run the\ncorrespondence analysis, principal component analysis\n(PCA), and cluster analysis. The weightings used in the cor-\nrespondence analysis were based mainly on the assumptions\nmade in Table 1. ArcGIS 10.0 was used to generate the vul-\nnerability map.\nCorrespondence Analysis, PCA, and Cluster\nAnalysis\nCorrespondence analysis was run on the variables to trans-\nform the non-metric data to a metric level and perform\ndimensional reduction. In essence, correspondence analysis\nwas used to quantify the qualitative data obtained from\nquestionnaire.\nPCA was run on the variables, and weights were gener-\nated and attached using the first principal component scores\nof the indicators. The reason for assigning the weights deter-\nmined by PCA to indicators is to avoid the uncertainty of\nequal weighting given the diversity of indicators used\n(adapted from Deressa et al., 2008). Thus, for the construc-\ntion of the zonal vulnerability indices, the selected indicators\nof sensitivity and exposure were negatively associated with\ntheir first principal component because it is assumed that\nareas/zones with higher frequencies of flooding were sub-\njected to higher sensitivity due to the adverse effects of\nflooding as well as being more exposed. On the other hand,\nadaptive capacity was positively associated with the first\nprincipal components because it is assumed that people with\nhigher adaptive capacity are less sensitive to damages caused\nby flooding, holding exposure level constant. Thus, higher\nvalues of the vulnerability indices show less vulnerability\nand vice versa (adapted from Deressa et al., 2008; Madu,\nFinally, hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on\nthe vulnerability indices to group the zones according to sim-\nilarity in their degrees of vulnerability using average linkage\nmethod, and the spatial pattern of the different vulnerability\nlevels was mapped.\nDiscussion of Results\nResult of the PCA\nThe PCA of the data set on vulnerability indicators extracted\nthree components with eigenvalues greater than 1. Table 2\nreveals that these three components explained 64.69% of the\ntotal variance in the data set. The first principal component\nexplained most of the variation (43.036%), the second prin-\ncipal component explained 12.488%, and the third compo-\nnent explained the least (9.170%). The first principal\ncomponent, which explained the majority of the variation in\nthe data set (Table 3), was taken (i.e., it served as the weight)\nand used in the computation of the vulnerability indices of\nthe different zones.\nSocio-Economic Characteristics of Respondents/\nAdaptive Capacity Indicators\nTables 4 to 10 below show the socio-economic characteris-\ntics of the respondents and the adaptive capacity indicators\nthat were used in this research.

The data obtained (Table 9) indicate that only 2.1%,\n2.2%, and 4.0% do not have access to either of these techno-\nlogical devices in Zones C, K, and M, respectively. All the\nrespondents in other zones either own a radio set, television\nset, or phone. This indicator was among the least factors that\ndetermined the vulnerability levels of zones because the\nnumber of respondents without access to either radio or TV\nor phone did not vary significantly across the zones.\nThe quality of housing structure influences the degree of\ndamage of flooding. Analysis of the collected information\nrevealed that majority of the respondents live in houses con-\nstructed with concrete rather than zinc or wooden houses.\nOnly 2% and 4% of the respondents in Zone M indicated that\nthey live in houses constructed with zinc and wood, respec-\nAkukwe and Ogbodo 11\nSensitivity and Exposure Indicators\nFrequency of flood has to do with how often flooding occurs\nin the various zones. It is however conceived that the more\nfrequently floods occur in a zone, the higher that zone's vul-\nnerability level. It could be ascertained from Table 11 below\nthat flooding is a problem in Port Harcourt metropolis\nbecause on average, only a few persons (11.7%) indicated\nTable 10.

Therefore, the higher the number of respondents\nwith high flood perception, the lower their zones'vulnerabil-\nity levels (holding every other factor constant). In Port\nHarcourt metropolis, the highest proportion (36.2%) of the\nrespondents indicated that they had little awareness of flood,\nwhich is followed by those who were fairly aware of flood\nevents (29.2%). The next is the group that indicated that they\nwere not aware at all (18.6%), and the minority (16.0%) indi-\ncated that they were highly aware (Table 13). There is also a\ndirect relationship between past flood experience and vulner-\nability level.

The percentage of respon-\ndents who live in zones situated about 3.6 km to 4.7 km away\nthat are located more than 5.6 km away from a river.

Table 15 below\nshows the mean proximity of dwelling units of respondents\nto a major water body.\nHow deep flood waters are in any zone has a positive cor-\nrelation with its vulnerability level, in the sense that the\ndeeper the flood waters, the more the damage and the vulner-\nability. About 49.2% respondents estimated the height of\nflood water to be between ankle and knee, 34.7% said it is\noften at knee length, 13.8% indicated it to be above knee\nlength, and 2.3% informed it is often waist high in Port\nHarcourt metropolis (Table 16).\nTable 16.

Table 18 shows the vulnerability\nindices for all the 13 zones that make up Port Harcourt\nmetropolis. As indicated in the research methodology, factor\nscores from the first principal component were used to con-\nstruct vulnerability index for each zone. For instance, the\nvulnerability index for Rumukwurushi (Zone A) is calcu-\nlated as follows:\n/\n. * . . * . . * .\n. * .\n( )+ -\n( )+ ( )\n( )+ ( )+ ( )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- -\n(\n. * . . * .\n. * .\n-\n)\n)+ - -\n( )+ -\n( )\n+ - -\n( )+ ( )+\n. * . . * .\n. * . .\n- -\n( )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n( )+ -\n( )+ ( ) +\n. * .\n/\n/\n. . .\n.\n( )+ ( )+ ( )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n( )+ ( )+ -\n( )\n. .\n. . .\n-\n+\n+ ( )+ ( )+\n( )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n. .\n.\n/\n.\nThe vulnerability indices calculations for the rest of the\nzones followed the same procedure (Table 18).\nTable 18 reveals that Zone K (Mgbuosimiri) is the most\nvulnerable among all the zones followed by Zone J\n(Rumuepirikom), Zone I (Mgbuoba), Zone L (Amatagwolo),\nZone M (Town), Zone A (Rumukwurushi), Zone B\n(Rumuodara), Zone G (Orogbum), and Zone H (Golf Course).\nThese zones recorded a vulnerability index ranging from 0 to\n3. The least vulnerable zone is Zone D (Eligbolo), followed by\nZone E (Bori Camp), Zone F (Bodo), and Zone C (Elekahia),\nwhose vulnerability indices are between 4 and 8 (Table 19).\nClassification of the Vulnerability\nIndices of the Thirteen Zones in Port\nHarcourt Metropolis\nThe zones were grouped according to their similarity in\ndegrees of vulnerability using average linkage cluster analy-\nsis method of classification. The grouping shows four clus-\nters representing four different zonal vulnerability levels in\nPort Harcourt (Figure 4 and Table 19).\nThe dendrogram (tree graph) reveals that four clusters\n(vulnerability groups) were obtained with six zones in the\nfirst cluster; three zones in the second cluster; three zones in\nthe third cluster, and only a zone in the fourth cluster.\nTable 19 shows that Amatagwolo, Town, Mgbuoba,\nRumuepirikom, Mgbuosimiri, and Rumukwurushi (i.e.,\nZones L, M, I, J, K, and A) have very high vulnerability lev-\nels with a mean index of 0.43, whereas Rumuodara,\nOrogbum, and Golf Course (Zones B, G, and H) have high\nvulnerability level with a mean index of 3.02. The above\nZones are therefore known as the flood vulnerability\n\"hotspots.\" The table also reveals that Bori Camp, Bodo, and\nElekahia (Zones E, F, and C) have low vulnerability level\nwith a mean index of 5.41, whereas Eligbolo (Zone D) has\nvery low vulnerability level with a mean index of 7.72.\nSpatial Pattern of Flood Vulnerability\nLevels in Port Harcourt Metropolis\nThe mapped result of the cluster analysis shows that the spa-\ntial pattern of the vulnerability levels in Port Harcourt\nmetropolis tends to increase toward the north west, south\nwest, south, and north east, and decreases toward the central\n(Figure 5). This vulnerability map was generated using\nArcGIS 10.0. The observed spatial pattern in the vulnerabil-\nity levels of the zones as inferred from field investigations\nand data analyses is highly attributed to the differences in\ndistance of these zones to major water bodies in Port Harcourt\nmetropolis. Those zones (e.g., K, M, etc.) that are closer to\nwater bodies recorded higher vulnerability levels than those\nfarther away from major water bodies (e.g., Zone D; see\nTable 15). It is quite surprising that Rumukwurushi and\nMgbuoba (Zones A and I) recorded a higher vulnerability\nthan Elekahia (Zone C), which is closer to a water body than\nthem. This indicates that other factors also influence flood\nvulnerability levels in study area.\nMoreover, the zones in the first and second clusters (i.e.,\ntoward the north west, south west, south east, and north east\nof Port Harcourt metropolis) are highly vulnerable to flood-\ning, because they have only few people who belong to an\nassociation/group; who received assistance/relief; and who\nhad pre-flood awareness (see Tables 7, 8, and 13, respec-\ntively). In addition, their high vulnerability can also be attrib-\nuted to having highest number of people who earn between\nfloods in the last 6 months (Tables 5 and 14, respectively).\nconsidered poor as indicated in the methodology. The reverse\nis the case with the third and fourth clusters (the central of\nthe study area), which is why they have relatively low vul-\nnerability levels.\nRecommendations\nSustainable Drainage Systems (SUDs)\nA sustainable drainage system aims to mimic as closely as\npossible the natural drainage of an urban area to minimize\nthe impact of urban development on the flooding and pollu-\ntion of waterways. These may take the form of areas of veg-\netation such as grassy banks or green roofs, or natural water\nTable 17.

This type of risk preven-\ntion is of great importance for areas with great flood depth.\nLow-cost houses in less flood-prone areas in Port Harcourt\nmetropolis should be built by the government where affected\nresidents or evacuated victims especially from the flood vul-\nnerability \"hotspots\" could stay temporarily during flood\npeak periods till dry season.\nTherefore, National Emergency Management Agency\n(NEMA) should equally be equipped to evacuate victims\nduring flood emergencies as well as distribute relief materi-\nals to relieve victims of sustained shocks. Observations and\ninterviews show that NEMA had demonstrated a poor capa-\nbility in managing flood disasters in Port Harcourt metropo-\nlis. Although, NEMA is a Federal parastatal, the Government\nof Rivers State can give subvention to this agency to help in\ntimes of flood emergencies.\nDemolition of Illegal Structures\nStructures that are built on the pathways of flood waters in all\nthe zones should be demolished, and the Master Plan of the\nGreater Port Harcourt City Development Plan (GPHCDP)\nshould be implemented. This would reduce the increased rate\nof uncontrolled urbanization/urban creep and decongest Port\nHarcourt City where affected people would be encouraged to\nrelocate to unsaturated areas.\nAwareness Creation/Sensitizing the People on\nPre-Flood and Post-Flood Actions\nAwareness and perceptions of a problem shape action or\ninaction on the problem (Speranza, 2010). Fieldworks and\ninterviews revealed that most residents of Port Harcourt\nmetropolis do not have in-depth understanding of flood\nproblem and its implications. It is essential that residents of\nthe study area recognize flooding as part of their environ-\nment. Thus, it is very important to explain the various causes,\nconsequences, and things to be done to reduce the adverse\neffects of flooding through radio/TV programs. The integra-\ntion of the knowledge of flood problems, prevention, and\nprotection, as well as mitigation into Rivers State's primary\nand secondary education programs, would also go a long\nway improving people's resilience to flooding. Effective and\nefficient sensitization of the residents on early warning signs\nof floods and what to do before, during, and after flood epi-\nsodes (i.e., preparing them for the worst case) would help\nreduce the damages caused by flooding in all the zones.\nMonetary Compensation of Flood Victims\nA compensation system should be established by the Rivers\nState Government to support the victims of flood disasters to\nrestore their economic basis and their living conditions in\ndue time. This would also help in alleviating non-insurable\npublic damage.\nLabel Num +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+\nFigure 4.

Spatial variations in flood vulnerability levels in Port Harcourt metropolis.\nAkukwe and Ogbodo 17\nConclusion\nThis study analyzed the vulnerability to flooding in Port\nHarcourt, Nigeria, by creating vulnerability indices and com-\nparing these indices across the 13 zones that make up Port\nHarcourt metropolis. The vulnerability analysis followed the\nIPCC (2007) definition of vulnerability, which gave room for\nadaptive capacity, sensitivity, and exposure indicators to be\nadopted. The integrated vulnerability assessment approach\nwas adopted to analyze vulnerability in Port Harcourt\nmetropolis, which combined the socio-economic and bio-\nphysical variables.\nThe calculated vulnerability indices range from 0 to 7\nwith 0 representing the highest vulnerability and 7 represent-\ning the lowest vulnerability. The vulnerability indices were\ngrouped using cluster analysis, which revealed four clusters\nrepresenting four different vulnerability levels, that is, very\nhigh, high, low, and very low in the study area, of which\nzones with very high and high vulnerability levels were\ntermed the flood vulnerability \"hotspots.\" The identified\nflood vulnerability \"hotspots\" are Amatagwolo, Town,\nMgbuoba, Rumuepirikom, Mgbuosimiri, Rumukwurushi,\nRumuodara, Orogbum, and Golf Course (i.e., Zones L, M, I,\nJ, K,A, B, G, and H). Bori Camp, Bodo, and Elekahia (Zones\nE, F, and C) had low vulnerability levels, whereas Eligbolo\n(Zone D) had very low vulnerability level. These were\nmapped, and the spatial pattern revealed that the vulnerabil-\nity levels in Port Harcourt metropolis tend to increase toward\nthe north west, south west, south, and north east and decrease\ntoward the central, and the major determinant was the prox-\nimity of the 13 zones to a major river/stream/creek.\nFinally, the study has demonstrated that some areas in\nPort Harcourt metropolis are indeed more vulnerable to\nflooding than others. Therefore, the vulnerability map pro-\nduced from this study, which shows the spatial pattern of dif-\nferent flood vulnerability levels can be used for the reduction\nof damage potential by integrating its outputs into spatial\nplanning and emergency planning in Port Harcourt\nmetropolis.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAdelekan, I.
