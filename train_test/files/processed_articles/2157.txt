Changes in medication costs were found\nto be dependent on the magnitude of weight lost. The annual\ncosts of diabetes and cardiovascular medications decreased by\n8% for those losing >15% baseline body weight. However, medi-\ncation costs increased for individuals losing <15% baseline body\nweight. The largest increase in medication costs, 96%, was seen\nfor those who lost <5% baseline body weight (9).\nCollinsandAnderson(1995),evaluatedtheeconomicimpact\nAt 12 week follow-up, subjects had lost an average of 15 lbs,\nand monthly prescription costs for hypertension and diabetes\nfollow-up, subjects had lost an average of 20 lbs and average\neling of sustained 10% weight loss decreased lifetime health-\ncare expenditures due to hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,\ntype 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and stroke by as much\ndict the return on investment for workplace obesity interven-\ntions. Annual savings due to medical costs and absenteeism\nwere estimated to be $90 per worker for those achieving at least\n5% weight loss (12). In a follow-up study, Finkelstein et al.,\nmerged medical claims and absenteeism data for employees\nfrom 17 North Carolina based colleges. In this study however,\noverweight and obese participants with at least 5% weight loss\ndid not have lower medical expenditures or absenteeism at 12\nThese studies have made important contributions by study-\ning weight loss and its relationship to health-care expenditures.\nFrom these studies we know that obesity results in higher\nhealth-care expenditures over a lifespan, that weight reduc-\ntion can curb increases in areas such as medication costs and\nthe relationship between health-care expenditures and weight\ndepends on the amount of weight lost. Whereas, some authors\ndemonstrated this relationship in terms of absolute pounds\nlost, others expressed weight loss in terms of relative per-\ncentages. Despite these differences, these studies have shown\nthat the changes in health-care expenditures resulting from\nweight loss cannot be ignored. However, these studies have\nlimitations. Some have examined only changes in prescription\nexpenditures (9,10,14) some studies focused only on specific\nconditions such as diabetes (9), while still others included only\nselected populations (i.e., employees).\nGiven that the obesity epidemic is prevalent not just in the\ngeneral population, but with the elderly as well, it is important\nto analyze the effect of weight loss in this population. Since\nthe elderly are particularly at risk for chronic conditions (15),\nobesity may increase comorbid complications and contribute\nto higher excess expenditures compared to the nonelderly. In\naddition, studies that analyze all components of expenditures\nwithin an elderly population, regardless of chronic conditions\ncan help providers, patients, and policy makers gain a pic-\nture of the overall financial impact of obesity with this group.\nTherefore, the primary objective of this paper is to analyze the\neffects of changing BMI on a variety of health expenditures,\nincluding total, in-patient, outpatient, medical, prescription,\ndental, and other among the elderly, using a nationally repre-\nsentative survey of Medicare beneficiaries.\nMethods and Procedures\nData\nThe Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) is a \"nationally rep-\nresentative sample of aged, disabled, and institutionalized Medicare\nbeneficiaries\" (16). The MCBS data consists of two annually released\npublic use files: \"access to care\" and \"cost and use\". The \"cost and use\"\nfiles contain information on personal health-care expenditures and\npayment sources for all beneficiaries who were eligible for Medicare\nat any time throughout the calendar year. Sources of information\non expenditures and utilization for health-care services include in-\nperson interviews conducted every 4 months as well as Medicare\nclaims. The two data files can be used separately or (for those enrolled\nfor the full year) in combination. The current project utilized the \"cost\nand use\" files.\nWe analyzed merged data from multiple years of the MCBS; 2000\u00ad\ncontains a nationally representative sample of beneficiaries who were\ninterviewed 12 times to collect 3 complete years of utilization data. Each\npanel consists of a unique set of beneficiaries, not present in any other\npanel. In addition, variables chosen for analysis were coded consistently\nacross all years. For our analyses, the first year of each panel served as\n2003). Year 2 and year 3 were defined as the two chronological years fol-\nlowing each panel's baseline year.\nTo arrive at these panels, we only included those who were first inter-\nviewed in the year of observation. For example, of the 13,051 individuals\nfirst time, of which 3,615 were followed for 3 years of interviewing. Of the\nfor the first time, of which 3,402 were followed for 3 years of interview-\nwere interviewed for the first time, of which 3,452 were followed for three\nyears of interviewing.\nAnalytic sample: inclusion/exclusion criteria\nThe analytical sample included individuals: (i) who were commu-\nnity dwelling and were followed for all 3 years, (ii) aged 65 years and\nolder, (iii) with full-year enrollment in Medicare parts A and B during\nyear 1 and (iv) had no missing BMI values for the years BMI changes\nwere measured. The following individuals were excluded: (i) individu-\nals who were underweight, (ii) those who had extreme fluctuations in\nweight such as those from a normal BMI to obese BMI and (iii) those\nwho changed weight from an obese BMI to normal BMI over the 2\nyear period of measurement. After exclusions, the analytical sample\nconsisted of 10,300 Medicare beneficiaries, with a similar distribution\nDependent variable: changes in expenditures\nExpenditure data consisted of payments made by third-party pay-\ners including Medicare, Medicaid, Medicare-Health Maintenance\nOrganizations (HMO), Veterans Affairs Health Insurance, private\nHMO, individually purchased insurance, employer-sponsored insur-\nance, other payers and those paid by self or family. Expenditure types\ninclude total, in-patient, outpatient, medical providers, prescription,\ndental, and other. Other expenditures cover payments made for facil-\nity, home health, and institutional. The analyses presented here evalu-\nate changes in total, in-patient, outpatient, prescription, and medical\narticles\n \n\nproviderexpendituresonly.Pleasenote,wheretotalexpendituresdonot\nadd to the sum of listed expenditures, the difference reflects excluded\ndental and other expenditures. Medicare expenditures represent those\nobtained from both the survey and administrative bills for Medicare\npayments. To create an accurate picture of amounts paid, the files have\nundergone a careful reconciliation process that identifies payments\nrecorded on the survey only, the Medicare bill only, or on both (17).\nExpenditures from non-Medicare payers were obtained by self-report.\nIn all analyses expenditures were transformed to constant dollars and\nrepresented in 2005 dollars using the annual consumer price index for\nmedical care services available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://\ndata.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost, Accessed 30 August 2010). The Medical\nconsumer price index accounts for inflation across the following sec-\ntors: professional services, hospital and related services, health insurance,\nmedicinal drugs, and medical equipment/supplies. We also transformed\nexpenditures to natural logarithm to enable us to fit a liner model and\nimprove normality in the expenditure data.\nKey independent variable\nBMI categories. BMI was calculated by BMI = weight (kg)/height\n(m2). We used the following Centers for Disease Control's criterion to\ncategorize BMI groups: (i) underweight (BMI <18.5kg/m2); (ii) nor-\nobese (BMI 30kg/m2) (www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/\nadult_bmi/index.htm, Accessed December 2010). In each year, BMI\nwas calculated using baseline height.\nChanges in BMI were measured between year 1 and year 2, and were\ngrouped into the following categories used to predict expenditures in year\nbaseline and follow-up; (ii) Normal-Overweight: individuals with normal\nBMI at baseline and overweight BMI (25\u00ad29.9kg/m2) at follow-up; (iii)\nOverweight-Normal: individuals with overweight BMI at baseline and\nnormal BMI at follow-up; (iv) Stayed Overweight: individuals with over-\nweight BMI at baseline and follow-up; (v) Overweight-Obese: individuals\nwith overweight BMI at baseline and obese BMI (30kg/m2) at follow-up;\n(vi) Obese-Overweight: individuals with obese BMI at baseline and over-\nweight BMI at follow-up; (vii) Stayed Obese: individuals with obese BMI\nat baseline and follow-up. The following individuals were excluded: (i)\nindividuals who were underweight, (ii) those who changed weight from\nnormal BMI to obese BMI and (iii) those who changed weight from obese\nBMI to normal BMI over the 2 year period of measurement.\nOther independent variables\nDemographic Variables consisted of gender (women, men), race/\nethnicity (white, African American, Latino, other), age marital status\n(married, widowed, divorced/separated, never married), and metropol-\nitan status (metro, nonmetro). Variables representing socioeconomic\nstatus included education (less than high school, high school, greater\nthan high school), poverty status (as a percentage of the Federal Poverty\nLevel (FPL): < 200% FPL, >200% FPL), having supplemental private\ninsurance (yes, no), and dually enrolled in Medicaid (yes, no).\nStatistical methods\nThe 2 test of independence was used to determine significance between\nBMI change categories and subject characteristics. Ordinary Least\nSquares (OLS) models on logged year 3 expenditures were used to ana-\nlyze changes in expenditures between BMI change categories. Models\nwere adjusted for the following independent variables: gender, race/\nethnicity, education, poverty status, Medicaid status, insurance type,\ngeneral health, smoking status, depression, and baseline expenditures.\nAll analyses controlled for the complex sample design of MCBS and\nwere conducted using Statistical Analysis System (SAS version 9.2; SAS,\nCary, North Carolina) using survey procedures.\nResults\nAt baseline (year 1), the analytical sample (n = 10,300) was\nmostly female (57%), white (81%), and more individuals were\nwere married (57%) and lived within a metro community\n(77%). More individuals had only a high school education\n(37%), with an even split between individuals living below\nof the sample reported having good physical health (33%),\nand 10% were current smokers. History of chronic disease/ill-\nness formed the following distribution (data not presented in\ntabular form); arthritis (59%), cancer (32%), diabetes (19%),\nheart disease (35%), hypertension (58%), stroke (10%), respi-\nratory diseases (13%), osteoporosis (18%), any mental illness\n(10%), and baseline depression (12%). In addition, at year 1,\nbased on BMI categories, 37% of the study sample was normal\nSubgroup differences in BMI change categories:\nbivariate analysis\nThe bivariate analysis between groups of BMI change catego-\nries showed significant differences between groups for all inde-\npendent variables tested (Table 2). Results showed that 35% of\nthe study sample Stayed Normal, 34% Stayed Overweight, 18%\nStayed Obese, 4% increased weight from normal BMI to over-\nweight, 3% increased weight from overweight BMI to obese,\n5% decreased weight from overweight BMI to normal, and 3%\ndecreased weight from obese BMI to overweight.\nUnadjusted models of year 3 expenditures\nTable 3 shows a comparison of year 3 expenditures by BMI\nchange categories. An unadjusted OLS model on logged year\n3 expenditures was used to determine statistically significant\ndifferences between BMI change categories and the reference\ngroup, Stayed Normal. Based on the unadjusted model, total\nexpenditures were significantly higher for Stayed Obese and\nOverweight-Normal BMI categories as compared to Stayed\nNormal. Outpatient expenditures were significantly higher for\nStayed Overweight, Stayed Obese, and Overweight-Normal\nBMI categories as compared to Stayed Normal. Prescription\nexpenditures were significantly higher for all BMI change cat-\negories when compared to Stayed Normal. Compared to Stayed\nNormal, medical provider expenditures were significantly lower\nfor Stayed Obese, but significantly higher for Overweight-\nNormal. Statistically significant differences were not seen\nbetween BMI change categories for in-patient expenditures.\nFully adjusted models of year 3 expenditures\nTable 4, presents the results of OLS models on logged expen-\nditures from year 3 adjusted for gender, race, education, pov-\nerty status, Medicaid status, insurance type, general health\nincluding depression, smoking status, and baseline expendi-\ntures. Adjusted models revealed those who Stayed Obese had\nincreased expenditures across multiple expenditure types that\nwere significantly higher than Stayed Normal including total\n(11%), outpatient (25%), prescription (9%), and medical pro-\nvider (4%). Individuals who Stayed Overweight had outpa-\ntient expenditures that were significantly higher than Stayed\narticles\n \nAmong those who experienced weight gain, \nmedical provider\nexpenditureswere4%higherforthoseintheNormal-Overweight\ncategory and 8% higher for those in the Overweight-Obese\ncategory. Total expenditures were 26% higher for those in the\nOverweight-Obese category. Among those who experienced\nweight loss, significant increases were seen only for those\nbelonging to the Obese-Overweight category. Compared to\nStayed Normal, individuals in the Obese-Overweight category\nhad higher expenditures for total (26%), outpatient (52%),\n\nprescription (31%), and \nmedical provider (7%).\nFully adjusted models of year 3 expenditures\nby age stratification\nDue to the increased risk of complications due to advanced\nage, obesity treatments such as bariatric surgery require spe-\ncial consideration for those over the age of 65. Therefore, we\nconducted a secondary analysis (data not presented in tabular\nform) on the effects of BMI change categories on health-care\nOverweight as compared to Stayed Normal. Results were not\nstatistically significant for individuals over 75 years of age.\nTable 1Sample description medicare current beneficiary\nN Wt %\nBMI-year 1\nBMI-year 2\nCohort\nGender\nRace/ethnicity\nAge\nMarital status\nMetro status\nEducation\nPoverty status\nUsual source of care\nMedicaid\nPrivate insurance\nGeneral health\nSmoking\nBased on community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries over age 65, followed for\n3 years with no missing BMI values and were first included in the survey between\nPoverty categories indicate greater than or less than 200% of the Federal Poverty\nLine (FPL) in base year.\nHS, high school; Wt %, weighted percentage.\nTable 1 (Continued)\nN Wt %\narticles\n \nTable 2Sample characteristics by BMI change categories medicare current beneficiary survey 2000\u00ad2005\nStay\nNormal\nStay\nOverweight\nStay\nObese\nNormal-\nOverweight\nOverweight-\nObese\nOverweight-\nNormal\nObese-\nOverweight\nSignificance\nWt% Wt% Wt% Wt% Wt% Wt% Wt%\nCohort\nGender\nRace/ethnicity\nAge\nMarital status\nMetro status\nEducation\nPoverty Status\nUsual source of care\nMedicaid\nTable 2Continued on next page\narticles\n \nDiscussion\nWe analyzed changes in health-care expenditures subsequent\nto short-term weight changes and found that individuals who\nStayed Obese had higher total, outpatient, prescription, and\nmedical provider expenditures compared to those who Stayed\nNormal. These findings are consistent with both cross-sectional\nand longitudinal studies that have established increased health-\ncare expenditures due to overweight and obesity (8,18,19).\nMore specifically, the short-term effect of weight gain on health\nexpenditures has been demonstrated in persons with diabetes.\nFor example, Yu and colleagues modeled changes in total and\ndiabetes-related health expenditures 1 year after weight gain/\nloss and showed a 1% increase in weight would result in an\nincrease in total health costs of 3.1% (20).\nWe found that obesity in either year 1 or year 2 was signifi-\ncantly associated with greater total expenditures. For example,\nindividuals who gained weight and moved from overweight\nto obese BMI and those who lost weight from obese to over-\nweight BMI had total expenditures that were 26% higher than\nStayed Normal. We also found that weight gain in terms of\nmoving from normal to overweight and weight loss in terms\nof moving from overweight to normal did not produce higher\ntotal expenditures. Taken together, these two findings suggest\nthat over a short period of time obesity can affect health-care\nexpenditures to a greater extent than weight loss or gain.\nOur findings have to be interpreted in the context of a short\ntime horizon and reflect changes in health-care expenditures\nwith recent changes in BMI (for persons aged 65 years and\nolder). However, there is evidence that BMI assessed during\nyoung adulthood and middle age is significantly and positively\nassociated with cardiovascular-related medical care charges\nin older age (21). Thus, the lack of association between lower\nexpenditures and weight loss could be due to the fact that obese\nindividuals may have been obese for any number of years prior.\nIt is possible that accumulation of negative obesity-related fac-\ntors contributed to their present medical state and thus higher\ntotal expenditures, despite having lost weight.\nAlthough total expenditures were significantly influenced\nby weight change categories, in-patient expenditures were\nnot. One retrospective cross-sectional analysis by Shen et al.\n(2009), analyzed the effect of BMI on health-care expenditures\namong elderly veterans with diabetes. Results showed that\npersons of normal weight had higher total, in-patient and out-\npatient expenditures than those who were obese or morbidly\nobese (22). Our study findings are also consistent with one\nlongitudinal study, which followed individuals over a period\nof 7 years and concluded that the average weight reductions of\n16% did not reduce hospitalization costs over a 6 year period\n(23). It was concluded that the lag-time between reduction in\nrisk factors induced by weight loss and the resultant impact on\nin-patient use is unknown. The authors also concluded that the\nlag-time could be longer than 6 years. We were unable to deter-\nmine the BMI of individuals over a longer period because the\nMCBS followed Medicare beneficiaries for up to 3 years. We\ncould additionally, speculate that the lack of association could\nbe the result of excluding those who would likely be severely\nill (i.e., underweight individuals), and thus incur lengthy\nhospital stays. It could also mean that over a short period,\nPrivate insurance\nGeneral health\nSmoking\nBased on community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries over age 65, followed for 3 years with no missing BMI values and were first included in the survey between 2000\nand 2003.

In our secondary analyses\ndiscussed above, we did find that BMI change categories were\nassociated with greater total health-care expenditures among\npersons 65\u00ad74 years of age. However, this relationship was not\nsignificant for Medicare beneficiaries older than 75 years. These\nfindings suggest that weight loss or gain in advanced age may\nnot produce significant effects on health-care expenditures.\nOur study's findings have to be interpreted in the context of\nits limitations. We have analyzed short-term changes in health-\ncare expenditures and changing BMI categories in a nation-\nally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries. We do\nnot know, however, whether these changes were intentional.\nAverage BMI has been shown to decline with advanced age (8).\nIn addition, we know that weight loss can accompany severe\nillnesses, such as cancer. Although we have shown that health-\ncareexpenditureschangealongwithchangesinBMIcategories,\nwe cannot distinguish between healthy or unhealthy weight\nchanges. In addition, use of the BMI measurement for elderly\npopulations has been questioned. One longitudinal study on\naging reported that from age 30 to 70 years, men and women\nlose an average of 3 and 5cm in height, respectively. By age 80,\nloses were 5cm for men and 8cm for women (24). The study\nalso estimated that by age 70, BMI would be artificially raised\nage this increase would be 1.4 and 2.6kg/m2 respectively. Age-\nadjusted measures of body mass have been suggested. Andres\net al., proposed age-adjusted weight standards by which ideal\nweight could be derived (25). Despite these findings, both the\nWorld Health Organization and National Heart, Lung, Blood\nInstitute regard BMI as the index of choice to define weight\ncategories in all adults (26,27). Some studies suggest that indi-\nviduals may have to be followed for >6 years for evidence of\nthe linkage between weight loss and reduced expenditures. We\nwere unable to determine the BMI of individuals over a longer\nperiod because the MCBS followed Medicare beneficiaries for\nup to 3 years. We also could not adequately control for endog-\neneity bias; weight loss is a natural process of aging and higher\nmedical expenditures may be driven by weight changes associ-\nated with progress and advanced stages of chronic diseases.\nDespite limitations, our study has contributed to the discus-\nsion of whether weight changes can offset increased expendi-\ntures due to obesity. We have also described the relationship\nbetween weight loss or gain and health-care expenditures over\nthe short-term by analyzing total and component expenditures.\nIn addition, whereas, some authors demonstrated this relation-\nship in terms of absolute pounds lost, or as relative percent-\nages, we define weight loss using the clinically relevant BMI\nmeasure. Our study findings highlight that over a relatively\nshort period, having a stable weight results in lower health-\ncare expenditures when compared to both weight gain or loss.\nCollectively, the findings of this study point to the importance\nof maintaining a normal BMI over time.\nTable 4 Fully adjusted Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models on logged year 3 expenditures (Constant 2005 $)\nTotala Inpatient Outpatient Prescription Medical provider\nBeta s.e.
