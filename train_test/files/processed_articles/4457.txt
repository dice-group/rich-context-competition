    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe San Carlos Apache Tribe is a leading defender of Oak Flat, a large public campground on the western flanks of the\nPinal Mountains east of Phoenix. Oak Flat is sacred to many Apaches and other Native Americans and is listed in the\nU.S. National Register of Historic Places. The Tribe is among the parties gravely concerned about the Resolution Copper\nMine, a joint venture of Rio Tinto Group and BHP Billiton Ltd. to privatize and industrialize Oak Flat's public lands and\nminerals. Archaeological sites, place names, stories, and ceremonial uses affirm the pre-1875 Apache occupation and ongoing\nsignificance of Oak Flat. Historical records reveal how mining proponents combined industrial and annihilationist propaganda\nto portray Apaches in the Pinal Mountains as subhuman impediments to civilization and profit. This inflammatory rhetoric\nignited vigilante and military campaigns between 1859 and 1874 that killed over 380 Pinal Apaches--including many women\nand children--then confined survivors onto the San Carlos Reservation. Mining across Pinal Apache territory followed\npromptly, claiming additional Apache lands inside and outside reservation borders. The stark historical injustice of the Pinal\nApache Genocide requires recognition and redress via the responsible governments and industries, including their successors\ntoday. The obvious first step is simple avoidance of further harm to Apaches and Oak Flat. Truth must be a hallmark for\ncomprehensive cost\u00adbenefit assessments of proposed alterations of Indigenous homelands. Reconciliation must be a planning\ngoal for any mining or other consumptive uses of Indigenous sacred sites.\n",

Despite a decade of effective opposi-\ntion by Apaches and environmentalists to the proposal to\nswap Oak Flat for RCM properties elsewhere, members of\nArizona's congressional delegation inserted provisions to\nprivatize Oak Flat into the 2014 National Defense\nAuthorization Act (Millet, 2015). The study continues with\nWind--the pernicious propaganda propagated by govern-\nments and mining proponents, beginning circa 1859, to\ndehumanize Apaches and rationalize their extirpation from\nthe Pinal Mountains. The study's deadliest element, Fire,\nchronicles scorched earth campaigns that killed and removed\nApache and Yavapai aboriginal landowners. Based on this\nexplanation of what happened to the Pinal Apache stewards\nof the Pinal Mountains, the study argues that improving\nminer\u00adApache relations is contingent, minimally, on truthful\nrecognition of past harms, avoidance of further injuries, and\nsteps toward reconciliation. Federal actions to assess and\nminimize RCM impacts, in particular, must be complete,\nindependently verifiable, and transparent enough to demon-\nstrate that RCM's social, economic, and environmental ben-\nefits unequivocally outweigh its massive and, as of late 2017,\nincompletely disclosed social and environmental costs.\nEarth: American Indian Ties to the\nRCM Impact Area\nSan Carlos Apaches are the most vocal Oak Flat defenders\namong the 10 federally recognized tribes of people whose\nancestors lived in and used the Pinal Mountains and the\nRCM impact area prior to 1875 and into time immemorial.\nSan Carlos is one of four tribes that represent the Western\nApache (Ndee) cultural tradition. The other three are the\nPayson Tonto Apache Tribe, the White Mountain Apache\nTribe, and the Yavapai-Apache Nation (Welch & Ferguson,\n2007). The six non-Apache tribes with clear cultural and\nFigure 1.

The project included site visits to\nthe RCM impact area and interviews with 94 representatives\nfrom the 10 affected American Indian tribes. Western\nApache, Yavapai, Zuni, O'odham, and Hopi elders helped\ndocument 404 sites and 46 springs threatened by RCM and\nculturally significant to at least one tribe. The sites include\nancestral living, gathering, and hunting areas, trails, petro-\nglyphs, landforms, water sources, and places of religious and\nspiritual importance and observance (Hopkins, Colwell,\nWestern Apache Territorial Culture\nOne indicator of the importance of the RCM impact area in\nApache culture is that 65 of the 94 tribal representatives who\ncontributed to the TNF study are Western Apache elders and\nyounger cultural practitioners. Western Apaches are distinct\nfrom the more sensationalized Chiricahua Apaches, who\nmaintained territories south and east of Western Apache\nAcademics generally agree that Western Apaches moved\nwestward to establish themselves in the Salt and Gila River\nacres of rugged mountains, deep canyons, desert basins, and\nApache cultures and worldviews are inextricable from\ntheir lands. Western Apache social structure featured territo-\nrial bands comprised of local groups made up of extended-\nfamily households. RCM would impact lands once used by\nthe Pinal Band, the T'iis Tseb\u00e1n (Cottonwoods Gray in the\nRocks People) and the Aravaipa Band, the Ts\u00e9 Binesti'\u00e9\n(Surrounded by Rocks People; U.S. Department of\nAgriculture Tonto National Forest [USDA TNF], 2015).\nThese two bands are collectively referred to as PinalApaches\nWestern Apache oral histories link specific matrilineal\nclans to specific clan origin places. Te'gotsug\u00e9 (east of Oak\nFlat; Figure 2) is the origin place for the five Apache rock\nclans; three other clans trace their origins to Oak Flat or\nbetween clanspersons serve to broaden clan networks and,\nprior to the 1880s, facilitated Apache access to other group's\nlands.

Apaches distinguished raiding, armed sorties for live-\nstock and produce, from warfare, mortal vendettas. Raiding\nwas more common during years and seasons of food scarcity,\nespecially January to March (Basso, 1971). Western Apaches\navoided interpersonal violence to conceal raiding tactics and\nroutes and to allow for the continued survival of farms and\nranches within range of possible future strikes. Apaches and\nYavapais shared the Pinal Mountains and other parts of the\nRCM impact area, occasionally intermarrying and cooperat-\nOak Flat\nThe stunningly beautiful, approximately 40-acre grove of\nmajestic Emory oak trees known as Oak Flat is the most sig-\nnificant American Indian site within the proposed RCM\nimpact area. Ancestors of all 10 RCM-affected tribes left\nbehind material traces of their occupation and carried for-\nward memories and stories (Hopkins et al., 2015). The Oak\nFlat vicinity is crossroads for cultures, histories, archaeolo-\ngies, and spiritualities. That the English place name is a\ntranslation of the Apache name, Ch\u00ed'chil Bildagoteel (a\nbroad flat of Emory oak trees), signals the place's paramount\nsignificance to Western Apaches.\nWestern Apache cultural and archaeological sites occur\nacross the RCM impact area, but the Ch\u00ed'chil Bildagoteel\nvicinity stands out as the regional hub (Buckles, 2008;\n4 SAGE Open\nLindeman & Whitney, 2003). Apache archaeological evi-\ndence in and near Oak Flat includes pottery sherds, petro-\nglyphs, rock piles, roasting areas, and remnants of boulder\nrings used as foundations for brush shelters by Apaches in\nthe mid-1800s and probably earlier (Table 1). These materi-\nals represent campsites, food procurement and preparation\nlocalities, and spiritual sites (USDA TNF, 2015). Ch\u00ed'chil\nBildagoteel is extraordinary because Apache sites elsewhere\nare difficult to identify and seldom occur in related clusters\nWood, the TNF archaeologist for four decades, said, \"there's\na good strong Apache archaeological presence up there\"\n(Heinsius, 2015). Wood also noted the area contains \"the\nsingle largest Apache archaeological site currently known\"\nOak Flat offers an unprecedented opportunity for collabo-\nrations among archaeologists and Western Apache scholars\nto fill voids in regional history and understandings of ancient\nApache lifeways. Apache place names, stories, songs, and\nspiritual traditions relating to Ch\u00ed'chil Bildagoteel and the\nRCM impact area further demonstrate the region's ancient\nand continuing significance, especially to Pinal Apaches\nRCM threats to Oak Flat have overcome some Apaches'\nreluctance to discuss Apache culture with outsiders. Upon\nlearning of new plans for mining, a San Carlos Apache Tribe\nrepresentative wrote of Oak Flat:\n[The] area is of traditional importance to Apaches. . . . The most\neffective way to respect and preserve these cultural resources is\nto not disturb archeological sites in any way, to keep the area\nnatural, and to engage in activities that restore disturbed areas to\nnatural conditions. We do not want you to promote activities that\nwill serve to disturb this area through mining. (Cassa, 2002)\nSan CarlosApache Tribe Chairman Terry Rambler (2014),\na T'iis Tseb\u00e1n descendant, wrote:\nOak Flat is one of our religious places where our Gaan--spiritual\ndeities and Holy People--reside. Apache people have lived,\nprayed, and died in the Oak Flat Area since time immemorial.\nWe are saddened that Congress, through an 11th hour rider, has\nignored the will of the people. We are concerned for our children\nwho may never see or practice their religion in their rightful\nplace of worship. . . . Apache people will not remain silent. We\nare committed to shining light on the Land Exchange and the\nproposed mine until we have no breath.\nFigure 2. Western Apache Aboriginal Territory and band lands located therein.\nNote.

Apache\nelders teach their youth from the earliest of ages the meaning\nand significance of their sacred places, including Oak Flat.\nThe convergence of oral traditions, archaeological evi-\ndence, and persistent memories and feelings linked to Oak\nFlat soundly refutes Dale Miles' (2015) dubious claim that\nCh\u00ed'chil Bildagoteel was not and is not significant in\nApache culture and history. The evidence obliged TNF to\nnominate, and the Keeper of the National Register to list,\nOak Flat in the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\nThe area's grassy basins, oak groves, boulder-studded\nwoodlands, canyons, springs, cliffs, and cultural sites col-\nlectively embody and define a cultural landscape of historic\nand current uses, predominantly by Apaches, of 4,309 acres\nTable 1.

Apache homelands\nwere claimed by Mexico until the 1848 treaty that ended the\nMexican\u00adAmerican War and the 1853 Gadsden Purchase\nthat added lands between the Gila River and today's Mexican\nborder (Welch, 2016). Figure 3 illustrates the original\nArizona domain of Western and Chiricahua Apaches.\nto the Rio Grande, depicting nonexclusive Apache territory\nreferenced in the Treaty of Santa Fe. That treaty obliges\nApaches to live exclusively under U.S. laws and jurisdiction\nand the United States to \"designate, settle, and adjust their\nterritorial boundaries, and . . . legislate and act as to secure\nthe permanent prosperity and happiness of said Indians\"\n(Kappler, 1904). Despite early cooperation among Western\nApaches and newcomers (Welch, 2016), government poli-\ncies abetted American encroachments into Apache lands\nAs had been the case in California and Nevada, miners led\nAmerican incursions into Arizona. The \"miners' invasion of\nthe West that began in 1849 led to the exploration of every\nmountain stream and valley. Miners looked for gold and\nfound silver in quantity as well. Congress responded with a\nnew mining act of 1872 allowing miners to take up land\nhad established Fort Buchanan, south of Tucson, and the post\nat the mouth of Aravaipa Creek later known as Camp Grant,\nto thwart Apache raids, enable strikes against Apaches, and\nYork Times incites the incipient convergence of popular opin-\nions, mining schemes, and government policies:\nThe Apache is as near the lobo, or wolf of the country, as any\nhuman being can be to a beast. . . . They neither cultivate nor\nhunt to any extent, but exist mainly . . . by plunder. . . . This is\nthe greatest obstacle to the operations of the mining companies.\n. . . [W]hipping these wild tribes . . . into submission, and driving\nthem into reservations . . . with the penalty of death sternly\nenforced if they pass their limits, is the only prompt, economical,\nand humane process. . . . My greatest hopes for Arizona,\nhowever, rest on the army. . . . Officers of various grades are\nbecoming interested in mines throughout that region.

(Dunbar, 1859, p. 2)\nIn 1862, the U.S. Army's departmental commander,\nGeneral James Carleton, ordered Apache men to be killed\ngold and silver near Prescott, northwest of Pinal Apache\nlands.

The Pinal\nApaches, Aravaipa Apaches, Tonto Apaches, and Yavapais\ntook the brunt of American miners' encroachments. In April\n1864, the United States authorized Arizona Territorial\nGovernor John N. Goodwin to muster the First Arizona\nVolunteer Infantry regiment. Over 350 men signed up to hunt\nper (also The Arizona Weekly Miner) exalted mining and\nexhorted military and civilian campaigns against Apaches\n(Table 2). One example of the exhortation:\nPinal Apaches . . . succeeded in stealing from the ranches a large\namount of valuable stock. . . . Mr. Woolsey . . . will organize a\ncompany to hunt and punish the thieves, and if it is as successful\nas the party . . . which slaughtered twenty or more of them, he\nwill have a good revenge. He . . . believes fully, as he has good\nreason to, in the extermination policy. (\"Indian troubles,\" 1864)\nGeneral Carleton's May 1864 order, also reported in The\nMiner, required Apache \"removal to a Reservation or by the\nutter extermination of their men, to insure a lasting peace and\na security of life to all those who go to the country in search\nof precious metals\" (Carleton, 1864, p. 1). Federal\nGovernment relationships with American Indians were man-\naged by \"superintendents\" charged to facilitate U.S.-Native\nco-occupation. On March 2, 1865, Arizona's Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs, Charles D. Poston (1865), appealed to the\nU.S. House of Representatives for additional military sup-\nport for a distinctive approach to coexistence:\nThe Spanish explorers found . . . a people . . . practicing many of\nthe arts of civilization. . . . In antagonism to these interesting\npeople we have the barbarous Apaches. . . . [From] Time\nimmemorial their hand has been against every man. . . . For three\ncenturies they have stayed the progress of civilization. . . . Their\nsubjugation would open to our hardy miners an unexplored gold\nfield north of the Gila. . . . A sickly sympathy for a few beastly\nsavages should not stand in the way of the development of our\nrichgoldfields,ortheprotectionofourenterprisingfrontiersmen.\nFire!\nAnnihilationist rhetoric is not always backed up by deeds,\nengagements with Apache fatalities; Table 4 lists the non-\nApache fatalities. Both rosters rely on Berndt K\u00fchn's\nChronicles of War (2014) to reduce bias in incident selection\nand fatality tabulation. As a further means to reduce vagaries\nin historical records and highlight contrasts between the two\ninventories, the roster of Apache fatalities (Table 3) only lists\nengagements in and adjacent to Pinal Apache territory, about\n5,340 square kilometers well removed from Tonto, Cibecue,\nand White Mountain Apache lands (see Figure 4). Table 4\nlists incidents from an area more than twice as large (about\n11,500 square kilometers), and includes all Americans,\nMexicans, and O'odham recorded as killed either near Pinal\nterritory or by Pinal or Aravaipa Apaches, anywhere. In\neffect, the location criteria for inclusion in Table 4 were\nrelaxed until a like number of incidents could be presented\nfor comparison. The estimated locations of the lethal inci-\ndents were then mapped to illustrate the concerted intensity\nof the military\u00adindustrial extermination campaigns. The map\nand tables highlight contrasts between the deliberate, state-\nsponsored violence against Apache families and the occa-\nsional, generally opportunistic killings of non-Apache men\nby Pinal and Aravaipa Apaches.\nGovernment complicity with miners' anti-Apache agenda\nhas seldom shown restraint. The Legislature of the Territory\n(1864) soon authorized mining claims by U.S. Army service-\nprospector foray led by Captain H. Moulton and miner Calvin\nJackson into the Pinal Mountains. North of the future town of\nGlobe, the 1870 expedition staked numerous tracts, including\nclaims for Moulton and regional commander, Lt. Col. George\nB. Sanborn. In another step toward convergence of military\nand industrial interests, General George Stoneman, the newly\nappointed Department Commander, ordered troops to \"pros-\necute a relentless Winter campaign against the Pinal and\nTonto branches\" and \"provide arms for civilians who desire\nto accompany them\" (\"The Indians in Arizona,\" 1871, p. 1).\nArizonans, especially miners, wanted still more Federal\nwere aroused to frenzy and demanded the immediate annihilation\nor capture of the Apaches. . . . Stoneman went about his work\ncarefully. . . . Fully one-third of the Territory was, and always had\nbeen in the hands of the Apaches. . . . Stoneman was accused of\nspending too much time in the details of establishing new posts,\nand the improvement of old ones, the building of roads, etc.\nArizonans greeted Stoneman's tactics with withering criti-\ncism in newspapers, relentless lobbying in Washington, and\nbloody vigilanteism.\nOne citizen expedition against Apaches proved pivotal.\nNative allies slaughtered at least 85 Pinal and Aravaipa\nApaches, including about 77 women and children camped\nunder Army protection (Colwell-Chanthaphonh, 2007;\nrific event pierced Washington officials' hazy grasp of what\nhad been going on in Arizona. Congress swiftly ducked, ced-\ning most authority over Indian affairs to the Executive Branch.\nThe Army replaced Stoneman with Colonel George Crook, a\nseasoned Indian subjugator, and suspended operations against\nApaches to allow visits by President Grant's Peace Policy\nenvoys. Deliberations between Apache leaders and Vincent\nColyer resulted in Grant's Executive Order of November 9,\n1871, to establish the White Mountain Reservation boundar-\nies; talks with Oliver O.

The campaign\nbuilt on previous U.S. Army operations' effective tactics:\nrelentless pursuits by cavalry units guided by Apache scouts,\ndawn ambushes, and destruction of homes, food stores, and\nWestern Apaches reliant on lands beyond the newly desig-\nnated reservation borders. General Orders No. 12, April 7,\n1873, states that \"announcement is made of the surrender of\nlarge numbers of Indians lately hostile\" and directs officers\n\"to enable the friend of any renegades still at large to bring\nthem in upon their proper reservations. . . .

Territorial newspaper articles,\nIndian policies, and military correspondence converge on the\ntruth that mining was the main motivation behind the Pinal\nApache extermination campaigns. Tallies from military and\ncivilian hunts (Table 3) yield grim statistics: American cam-\npaigns killed over 380 Pinal Apaches, a reckoning that\nexcludes the Camp Grant Massacre. Table 4 reveals that,\nFigure 4. Pinal Mountains and surrounding areas, with the estimated locations of the 35 encounters resulting in over 380 Apache\ndeaths (see Table 3) and the 34 encounters resulting in about 69 non-Apache deaths (small circles; see Table 4).\nduring the same 15 years, Pinal Apaches were responsible\nfor fewer than 70 deaths. There are gray areas in the records,\nbut no mentions of women and children dying at the hands of\nPinal Apaches have surfaced. Accounts of American aggres-\nsion, however, boast about the methods of subjugation:\nWithout judicial process or specific provocation, profes-\nsional soldiers and gangs of militarized hunters stalked and\nmurdered Apache men, women, and children, often as they\nslept, seldom taking prisoners. In contrast, 15 of the 34 inci-\ndents that precipitated non-Apache fatalities occurred during\nthe season of hunger in the region's uplands (January to\nMarch). These and many other incidents listed in Table 4 are\nlikely attributable to intercepted Apache raiding expeditions.\nStoneman (1871) quipped the Pinal Apaches \"must either\nstarve, steal, or be fed.\" In another candid admission about\nthe lopsided slaughter, General John Pope (1871) wrote,\n\"depredations of the Apaches have been continuous for\ntwenty-five years past, but they are insignificant in extent\nand generally confined to the plunder of a few sheep and\nmules and the occasional murder of a lonely sheepherder.\"\na cataclysmic period of loss--of life, of land, of liberty,\nand of sovereignties over people and territory (Lahti,\ntitled \"Extermination--A frontier panacea.\" Referenced\nluridly elsewhere as \"The Apache Wars\" (see Hutton,\n2016), the reality is that Americans, like the prior Spanish\nand Mexican incursions, invaded and annexed Western\nApache territory using all available means. Western\nApaches were deeply apprehensive and their responses\nwere almost exclusively defensive. Major John C. Cremony\nThe Apaches entertain the greatest possible dread of our\ndiscoveries of mineral wealth in their country. . . . They know\nand feel that wherever mineral wealth exists to such an extent as\nto render it available, the white man fastens upon it with\nineradicable tenacity. . . . The occupation of mines involves the\npossession of water facilities and sufficient fuel. To occupy a\nwater privilege in Arizona and New Mexico is tantamount to\ndriving the Indians from their most cherished possessions, and\ninfuriates them to the utmost extent.\nThe U.S. Indian Claims Commission (1965) adjudication\nof Western Apache and Yavapai claims to their aboriginal\nterritories affirmed\nhostilities commenced simultaneously with the arrival of miners\n. . . and continued almost without interruption until Genera1\nCrook rounded up the surviving Indians. . . .

Grant's envoys and generals laid out the initial\nreservation boundaries to avoid further conflicts with miners\nand to allow Western Apaches to sustain their families\nthrough hunting, gathering, and expanded farming and\nranching operations. These facts expose all claims that\nApaches were the aggressors and got what they deserved,\nespecially such claims leveled at T'iis Tseb\u00e1n and Ts\u00e9\nBinesti'\u00e9 families, as vacuous and callous justifications of\nastonishingly irresponsible journalism, governance, and law\nenforcement, all to facilitate mining and other commodifying\nappropriations of Apache land.\nBut logics of justice, aboriginal rights, and sustainability\nwere no match for the rapacious, race-based mind-sets that\nruled Arizona for its first century.

In 1875, the Federal\nGovernment closed the Camp Grant, CampVerde, Chiricahua,\nand Fort Tularosa Reservations; opened these erstwhile ref-\nuges, too, to non-Indians; and set about resettling all Western\nand Chiricahua Apaches at San Carlos.

(p. 374)\nGenocide?\nSince codification in the 1948 Convention on the Prevention\nand Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (United Nations\nGeneral Assembly, 1948), genocide has meant\nany of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole\nor in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:\na) Killing members of the group;\nb) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the\ngroup;\nc) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life\ncalculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in\npart;\nd) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the\ngroup;\ne) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\nScholars and lawyers agree that genocide should be refer-\nenced sparingly to conserve the term's legal, symbolic, and\nfurther, arguing that genocide is not a generally applicable\ndescriptor for U.S. Indian Policy because a \"legitimate gov-\nernment must plan, organize, and implement . . . a concerted\neffort to kill large numbers of people or indeed to annihilate a\ngiven people.\" More recently, Madley (2015) has welded the\nmandate to conserve the term's potency to a framework for\nfollows his own advice in an authoritative California study.\nThis research also adopts Madley's framework, revealing\nthat Federal and Territorial officials colluded with industrial\nboosters to remove T'iis Tseb\u00e1n and Ts\u00e9 Binesti'\u00e9 from their\nrightful homelands, dead or alive.After 1874, once theWestern\nApaches' self-appointed Federal trustee had the upper hand, it\ndistributed to non-Apaches the wealth from Apache's aborigi-\nnal and reservation lands (Welch, 2016). Beginning in the later\n1870s, the U.S. government saw fit to distribute Apache chil-\ndren--first dozens, then hundreds--to boarding schools and\nsponsored Apache scalp bounties may have continued in\nthose who prospered by and through genocide. The beneficia-\nries from the Pinal Apache Genocide, from the 1870s to the\n2010s, are mining corporations. Early mining proponents\nplanned and implemented genocide using predominantly pub-\nlic resources (i.e., the U.S. Army). These proponents then\nrushed in to claim and privatize the spoils. Their 21st-century\nsuccessors now appear poised to prosper through reinvestment\nof profits and political influence ostensibly traceable to geno-\ncide. RCM and its parent company, Rio Tinto, remain commit-\nted to influencing U.S. Government decisions about the use of\npublic lands and minerals, regardless of additional harms to\nthose lands, to Native Americans, or to National Register his-\ntoric sites and sacred places (see, for example, Barrios, 2017).\nSince the mid-1800s, miners have enlisted and rewarded gov-\nernment officials for complicity in relentless quests to elevate\nmining above other interests, including common laws, human\nrights, Christian values, and other moral codes. In October\n2017, the U.S. filed fraud charges against Rio Tinto for mis-\nReflections and Recommendations\nHistory, it is often said, repeats itself.

In the area surrounding Oak Flat\nand other world regions that have hosted numerous large\nmines, the local benefits of mining pale in comparison to bio-\nphysical and sociocultural costs and consequences (see\nIt is also said that history belongs to the victors. This is\ntrue in the narrow sense that most published accounts of\nPinal Apache history have been authored by non-Apaches. It\nis also true in the institutional and practical senses that\nApaches and their allies must use non-Apache rules in quests\nto unsilence their histories, save ancestral and public lands\nfrom imminent destruction, and secure their futures\n(Dongoske, Pasqual, & King, 2015; Greenberg & Greenberg,\nexplain Apaches' persistent emotional and spiritual connec-\ntions to Oak Flat and the depth and persistence of their oppo-\nsition to RCM. Insidious forces that Jacoby (2008) calls the\nViolence of History have suppressed evidence that bolsters\nApache claims and appeals while also marginalizing rea-\nsoned calls, like the one issued here, for overdue justice.\nWhat nothing can or must ever be allowed to erase, how-\never, is truth. Robust bodies of archaeological and historical\nevidence unequivocally confirm the presence of Pinal\nApaches in the Oak Flat vicinity and across the RCM impact\narea. Arizona and U.S. Governments deliberately prosecuted\nthe Pinal Apache Genocide to enable industrial mining and\nthe distribution of resultant profits from Apache lands to\nindustrial allies. The Pinal Apache Genocide requires recog-\nnition as both history and as a factor affecting contemporary\nrelations among those who live and work in its dark shadow,\nincluding RCM personnel, Federal and Arizona State\nGovernment officials, and the residents of Pinal and neigh-\nboring counties. Suspicions about industrialization voiced by\nApaches and other tribes' representatives derive not only\nfrom ancient senses of sacredness but also from persistent\nduties to homelands and long-muted histories of severance\ntheir traditions across centuries of oppression both overt and\ninsidious, Apache memories, stories, and claims to their\nlands may well emerge stronger and more resilient from the\nRCM controversy. Apaches take history seriously and per-\nsonally and so, too, should others affected by it (Basso,\nWhat history has yet to record are commitments by the pro-\nponents of the Pinal Apache Genocide and their successors to\nacknowledge and atone for these still-reverberating injustices.\nStudies of historical trauma show how past harms and oppres-\nsions travel across generations to cause major effects on\nIndigenous peoples' health and wellness (Fast & Collin-\nThe Pinal Apache Genocide constitutes a moral and legal\nmandate for action.

In any case, the Federal Government\nmust abandon, in Arizona and elsewhere, land management\npolicies and practices that institutionalize conceptions of\naboriginal landowners as denizens of the past and impedi-\nments to progress, caricatures that confine tribal concerns to\nand within physical protections for specific archaeological\nsites (Dongoske et al., 2015). There will never be a better,\neasier, or less expensive time than now for the United States of\nAmerica to escape military\u00adindustrial capture, embrace its\npublic and Indian fiduciary duties, and fulfill its higher mani-\nfest destiny as a guarantor of truth and justice for all.\nThis historical case study is as much about the future as\nthe past. Asking what happened to the Pinal Apaches who\ncreated an abundant archaeological record around Oak Flat\nhas revealed a genocide hidden in plain sight. Beyond chron-\nicling another chapter of injustice, the study indicates clear\ndirections for addressing the legacies of recurrent and occa-\nsionally lethal colonial encounters between industrialists and\nAmerican Indians (\"Dakota Access Pipeline,\" 2016). The\nFederal Government must decide, history will record, and\nvoters shall judge whether the foreign-owned RCM shall\ninflict additional harms on Apaches, other American Indians,\nand their homelands. The Oak Flat sacred place contains far\nmore than copper ore. The area harbors the material and\nmemorial proof for Pinal Apache occupation of the Pinal\nMountains and for government-sponsored mass killings and\nrace-based persecutions that haunt all American lands, lives,\nand institutions. The reverberant consequences of the Pinal\nApache Genocide and comparable inhumanities will con-\ntinue to debilitate our democracy so long as silence reigns.\nAll who cherish justice and simple kindness should question\nhow much and how long to accept genocide as a basis for\nhow we treat our lands and neighbors across the American\nWest, and beyond.\n"
