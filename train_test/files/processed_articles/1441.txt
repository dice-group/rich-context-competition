We compared consumption patterns between adults (age\n18\u00ad60) in the Metro Atlanta Cohort (MAC), a longitudinal study of pesticide exposure among Atlanta residents, and US National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES) adults. We focused on foods commonly eaten by US adults and foods likely to contain certain pesticide residues. MAC\nparticipants provided consumption data for 6 days per month for 1 year using a web-based data collection tool. We defined ``percent eaters'' as the\npercent of participants who reported eating a particular food in 24 h. We computed the NHANES weighted percent eaters and 95% confidence limits\n(CLs) using the 24-h dietary recall data. We calculated the MAC percent eaters for each sampling day and the percent of days this number fell below,\nwithin, or above the NHANES 95% CLs. We also re-sampled the MAC percent eaters across sampling days to find whether the resulting distribution\nresembled the NHANES estimate, and used the Kruskal\u00adWallis test to evaluate whether season affected the number of MAC eaters of a particular food\non a given sampling day. In general, across all sampling days, a greater proportion of MAC participants reported eating banana, broccoli, cream, grapes,\nlettuce, onion, peach, pear, peas, strawberries, string beans, and tomatoes than the national estimate, whereas the proportion of apple, spinach, catsup\nand white bread/roll eaters was similar, and the proportion of milk drinkers was lower. Season predicted the number of MAC peach and strawberry eaters\nbut not other foods. The data show how a higher proportion of Atlanta adults may eat certain foods (e.g., peaches in summer or strawberries in spring)\nthan the national average depending on season or other factors. An exposure assessment that ignored this difference could underestimate dietary pesticide\nintakes.\nKeywords: food consumption, longitudinal, dietary pesticide exposure, risk assessment, NHANES, Atlanta.\nIntroduction\nDietary intake has been identified as an important source of\nnon-occupational pesticide exposure among US adults,\nparticularly for organophosphorus (OP) and pyrethroid\nconsumption patterns is an essential component of dietary\npesticide exposure and risk assessment (Food Quality\nProtection Act of 1996) and typically involves empirical or\nprobabilistic descriptions of how individuals vary regarding\nthe types and amounts of foods they eat. Dietary pesticide\nexposure assessments typically rely on national nutrition\nsurveys or similar large-scale studies for empirical data to\ndescribe population-level variability in consumption habits.\nIn the United States, for example, the US Department of\nAgriculture's (USDA) national Continuing Survey of Food\nIntakes by Individuals (CSFII) is used as a source of\nconsumption data for quantitative assessments of risks from\nacute (i.e., 1-day) dietary exposures to pesticides (US EPA,\nthe US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) (CDC, 2002). CSFII/NHANES and similar\nnational surveys from other countries typically include\nseveral days of dietary recall data collected from a national\nprobability sample.\nAlthough most national surveys were not designed\nexplicitly for dietary contaminant exposure assessment, they\nprovide a useful initial source of information, especially given\nthe time and expense of collecting additional diet data. If\nnational data are used to estimate dietary pesticide intakes for\ndifferent subpopulations or seasons, however, care must be\ntaken to acknowledge and quantify the potential under-\n1.

Instead, longitudinal studies are\nneeded to provide information on intraindividual and\nseasonal variability, whereas regional studies are important\nfor providing information on spatial variability.\nIn this paper, we compare food consumption data from a\nlongitudinal study of adult dietary pesticide intake\nwe conducted in Metro Atlanta, Georgia, USA during\nNHANES. The objective of the comparison was to illustrate\ndifferences in consumption patterns between the national,\ncross-sectional data and a regional, longitudinal cohort. The\noverall goal is to provide pesticide exposure and risk assessors\nreliant on dietary data from national surveys with informa-\ntion needed to conduct sensitivity analyses of food consump-\ntion variables in their intake calculations.\nMethods\nMetro Atlanta Cohort (MAC) Study\nThe MAC Study was designed to collect longitudinal data on\ndietary consumption patterns and to assess their influence on\ndietary pesticide (OP and pyrethroid insecticides) exposures\nof adult residents of three metropolitan Atlanta counties F\ncontracted the AL Burruss Institute of Public Service at\nKennesaw State University (Kennesaw, GA, USA) to\nestablish a stratified probability sample of 500 individuals\nin the three-county area, matching gender, age, and race/\nethnicity data for this area from the 2000 US Census through\nrandom digit dialing. To reach a targeted enrollment of 60\nparticipants, approximately 100 adults were contacted from\nthe 500-person sample. Of these, 66 adults agreed to attend\nour training session, 53 adults completed the training\n(described later) and signed the consent form, and 45\nparticipants completed the sampling protocol. The protocol\nincluded collection of 6 consecutive days (starting on\nSunday) of dietary consumption data, urine, and saliva in\neach month over 1 calendar year. Participants chose 1 study\nweek per month at their convenience. The Emory University\nIRB approved the use of human subjects in this study and\ncontinued analysis of the data.\nParticipant training included an in-depth demonstration of\nhow to record dietary consumption data using the Internet\nData Logger (iDL) in an electronic personal data assistant\nthat we provided to each participant. Participants were also\ngiven printed instructions for using both. The technical\ndesign of the iDL was described in detail previously (Lu\net al., 2006). Briefly, the iDL is a web-based data collection\nplatform that allows participants to enter all food and\nbeverage items consumed during a meal or snack using a\nfood questionnaire that is hierarchically organized in a\nbranching format. For instance, if a participant ate a\nsandwich, she/he was prompted to record each component\nof the sandwich (e.g., bread, condiments, toppings, meats,\ncheese) as a separate item in sequence. For each food entered,\nthe iDL requested the number of servings consumed as input.\nAn on-screen reference guide was provided listing the weight\nor volume for one serving size of the food item.\nThe iDL's embedded features include a performance-\nmonitoring interface to improve participant compliance with\nthe longitudinal dietary data collection protocols. If a\nparticipant forgot to enter a meal, the iDL posted a notice\nat the next log-in reminding her/him to complete the meal\nentry or verify that she/he did not eat it. Research staff\nmonitored participant meal entries daily. If no meals were\nentered in 24 h or if an expected meal was not entered in 48 h,\na researcher called the participant to remind her/him to\ncomplete the entries.\nFor the dietary comparisons presented in this paper, we\nincluded data collected from 37 study participants. We\nexcluded two participants outside the 18\u00ad60 age range. We\nalso excluded two participants who had a baby during the\nstudy based on the assumption that pregnant women would\nhave different food consumption patterns than non-pregnant\nwomen. Finally, we excluded four participants who dropped\nout of the study within the first 3 months for personal\nreasons, such as relocating to outside the study area.\nNHANES Dietary Data Collection\nDemographic and dietary data collection methods are\nAll data used in this study were updated as of February 2009\n(CDC, 2009a). Briefly, demographic data were collected\nduring the household sample person interview (CDC, 2005a).\nDietary data were collected in a 24-h recall interview where\nrespondents worked with trained interviewers using three-\ndimensional measuring guides to record all foods/beverages\nconsumed from midnight to midnight the day before the\nNHANES medical examination (CDC, 2005a, b). A phone\nfollow-up (PFU) interview was conducted 3\u00ad10 days after\nthe in-person interview using a measuring guide and set of\nstandard household measuring cups and spoons given to\nrespondents during the in-person interview (CDC, 2005b).\nFor both the in-person and PFU sessions, interviewers used\nthe USDA's Automated Multiple Pass Method (AMPM) to\nrecord data. The public release data include estimates\nof grams eaten by descriptive eight-digit food code by\nrespondent for both in-person and PFU interviews.\nConstruction of Food Consumption Categories\nWe focused our analyses on foods that are frequently\nconsumed by adults ages 18\u00ad60 and/or food items that are\nlikely to contain OP and/or pyrethroid pesticide residues.\nFirst we made a list of frequently consumed foods (eaten by\nLongitudinal dietary consumption patterns Riederer et al.\n2006) by NHANES eight-digit food code. We then added\nfoods with detectable OP and/or pyrethroid pesticide residues\naggregated the NHANES eight-digit food codes into\ncategories that matched the MAC data. For example, we\ncombined all eight-digit food codes for strawberries (includ-\ning raw, cooked or canned, and frozen) in NHANES 2005\u00ad\n2006 into a single category we called ``strawberries'' to match\nthe MAC strawberries category. Table 1 presents the final list\nof the 22 food items we used for the MAC versus NHANES\ncomparisons. This includes foods most commonly eaten by\nNHANES adults and/or foods with detectable OP or\npyrethroid residues.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe used the NHANES dietary interview weights as well as\nthe stratum and cluster variables for weighted analyses. We\nused the SUDAAN 9.0.0 (Research Triangle Institute,\nResearch Triangle Park, NC, USA) SUBPOPN statement\nto subset the NHANES data to match the MAC age group\n(ages 18\u00ad60), exclude pregnant subjects, and stratify by\ngender. We used the SUDAAN CROSSTAB procedure to\ncalculate weighted consumption frequencies and 95% con-\nfidence limits (CLs) by food item. We defined consumption\nfrequency as ``percent eaters,'' the percent of respondents\nwho reported eating a specific food item in a 24-h period. We\nused SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) to calculate\npercent eaters for each sampling day in the MAC cohort and\nto calculate the percent of total sampling days (n \u00bc 72) that\nthe MAC percent eaters fell below, within, or above the\nNHANES 95% CLs. We tested differences in the NHANES\ngender, and interview type (in-person versus PFU) using\nthe SUDAAN CROSSTAB procedure and the Cochran\u00ad\nMantel\u00adHaenszel w2-test for survey data (significance at\nPp0.05). Last, to evaluate potential seasonal differences in\nthe daily MAC percent eaters estimates, we grouped sample\nmonths by season: summer (June\u00adAugust), fall (September\u00ad\nNovember), winter (December\u00adFebruary), spring (March\u00ad\nMay), and used the Kruskal\u00adWallis test to evaluate whether\nthe number of eaters of a particular food on a given sampling\nday differed significantly by season (significance at Pp0.05).\nResults\nBecause we did not find a significant difference in percent\nthe majority of foods analyzed (except bananas, grapes, and\nsoy milk), we opted to combine age groups. Likewise, percent\neaters did not differ by gender for the majority of foods (except\nwhite rolls, tomato catsup, cauliflower, grapes, and plums)\nthus we opted to analyze women and men together. A table of\npercent eaters by gender and age group is included in the\nSupplementary Information. Among women and men age 18\u00ad\n60, there was no significant difference in percent eaters by\ninterview type for the majority of foods analyzed except for\nlettuce, catsup, cream, peas, and spinach, thus we opted to\nanalyze only data from the in-person interview.\nMetro Atlanta Cohort Characteristics\nTable 2 presents demographic characteristics of the 37 MAC\nparticipants included in the present analyses and the\nNHANES adults. The MAC age distribution was similar\nto that of the three-county population. However, women\nwere slightly overrepresented, as were African Americans,\nwhereas whites and other races were slightly underrepre-\nsented. Residents of Fulton County were slightly under-\nrepresented among these 37 whereas residents of Gwinnett\nTable 1.

In comparison to the\nNHANES adults, the MAC sample was slightly younger,\nhad more female, and contained a greater proportion of\nAfrican Americans.\nAdults: Percent Eaters by Food Item\nTable 3 presents the weighted percent eaters and 95% CLs\namong NHANES adults by food, the percent of sampling\ndays where the MAC percent eaters fell within, below, or\nabove the 95% CLs of the NHANES estimate, and the range\nof the MAC percent eaters across the 72 sampling days. We\nfound that for certain foods, such as apple, spinach, tomato\ncatsup, and white bread/roll, the MAC percent eaters was\nsimilar to the NHANES estimate, as the results in Table 3\nshow. In other words, the MAC value fell within the 95%\nCLs of the NHANES estimate on 20% or more of sampling\ndays, and the number of Metro Atlanta days falling below\nthe NHANES 95% CLs was similar to the number falling\nabove. Other foods, including banana, broccoli, cream,\ngrapes, lettuce, onions, peach, pear, peas, strawberries, string\nbeans, and tomatoes were generally eaten by a larger\npercentage of MAC versus NHANES adults. For these\nfoods, the MAC percent eaters exceeded the NHANES\nupper CL on approximately 60% or more of sampling days.\nThe MAC percent of milk drinkers was less than the\nNHANES lower CL on two thirds of sampling days.\nCauliflower, cranberries, eggplant, plum, and soybeans were\nnot commonly eaten by either NHANES or MAC adults.\nAmong the MAC respondents, season was a significant\npredictor of the number of peach and strawberry eaters on 4\nof 6 and 3 of 6 sampling days, respectively, but not for other\nfoods. Figures 1 and 2 present the MAC daily percent eaters\nby month and season for peaches and strawberries,\nrespectively, and compare them with the NHANES esti-\nmates. For peaches, the percent eaters was highest during the\nsummer months (particularly July and August), when it was\n2\u00ad5 times the upper NHANES 95% CL on almost all\nsampling days. For strawberries, the percent eaters was\nhighest during the spring months, when it was 2\u00ad5 times the\nupper NHANES 95% CL on almost all sampling days.\nDiscussion\nCharacterizing dietary consumption patterns has become\nessential since the passage of the Food Quality Protection\nAct (Food Quality Protection Act of 1996) as these patterns\n(1 day, in-person interview)\nMetro Atlanta Cohort adults\n% Eaters 95% CLs % of 72 sampling days with\n% eaters in/outside NHANES 95% CLs\nRange % eaters\n(all sampling days)\n% Eaters on simulated\nsampling daysa\nWithin Below Above Mean Median\nAbbreviation: CLs, confidence limits.\naOne day randomly sampled (with replacement) 5000 times from Metro Atlanta data (all sampling days, seasons combined) to create simulated data set of 5000 days.\nLongitudinal dietary consumption patterns Riederer et al.\noften dictate the outcome of dietary pesticide exposure and\nrisk assessments. In addition, our own recent studies have\nshown that dietary intake is a predominant route of exposure\nto OP pesticides and, to a lesser extent, pyrethroid\nto collect representative food consumption information and\nto measure pesticide residue levels in food items that are\nactually consumed to accurately quantify dietary pesticide\nexposures of individuals, such efforts are resource intensive\nthus rarely undertaken in population-based studies. Alter-\nnative methods combine statistical/mathematical models with\navailable residue and dietary consumption data to predict\ndietary pesticide exposures for populations (Price et al., 2001;\nUS EPA, 2004). Under ideal circumstances, with high-\nquality input data, a dietary pesticide exposure model could\nbe used to simulate the effect of regulatory activities on\npopulation-level exposures and the anticipated reductions in\nhealth risks.\nData from the MAC and other longitudinal studies could\nbe used to improve the predictive capacity of dietary pesticide\nexposure models for relevant populations. In the MAC\nstudy, we collected 72 days (6 consecutive days per week for\n12 weeks) of daily dietary consumption data from a cohort of\nMetro Atlanta adults over 1 calendar year. On average,\nacross all sampling days, a greater proportion of MAC\nparticipants reported eating banana, broccoli, cream, grapes,\nlettuce, onion, peach, pear, peas, strawberries, string beans,\nand tomatoes than the national estimate, whereas the\nproportion of apple, spinach, catsup, and white bread/roll\neaters was similar. The proportion of MAC participants\nPercent eaters\nJun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May\nFigure 1. Daily percent of peach eaters in the Metro Atlanta Cohort by month and season.

Shaded band represents NHANES data: solid line\nindicates weighted percent eaters, dashed lines indicate 95% confidence limits.\nLongitudinal dietary consumption patterns\nRiederer et al.\nreporting milk consumption was generally lower than the\nnational estimate on most sampling days.\nA simple sample calculation illustrates the relevance of our\nfindings to dietary pesticide exposure and risk assessments.\nAssuming a predetermined residue concentration of pesticide\nX in grapes of 50 ng/g and the consumption of 100 g for a\ndaily serving of grapes by adults, and ignoring body weight,\nproduce an (unweighted) 1-day 95th percentile intake\nestimate of 0 mg. The 0 is explained by the fact that few\nNHANES adults reported eating grapes. Using the highest\npercentile (unweighted) intake estimate of 5 mg of pesticide\nX. Repeating this calculation for apples (using the same\nassumptions) would produce a 95th percentile (unweighted)\nintake of 5 mg of pesticide X using the either the NHANES\ndata or the maximum MAC percent eaters (20.0%). Thus,\nfor some foods (e.g., apples) intake estimates at levels\nimportant for dietary risk assessment, that is, the 95th\npercentile, might not differ if the risk assessor used the\nNHANES or MAC data, whereas for others (e.g., grapes)\nthe difference may be relevant.\nThe differences we observed for certain foods may be\nattributable to either seasonal patterns or geographic\ndifferences, or both. NHANES is a nationally representative\nsample of eating patterns over a 2-year period; for\nconfidentiality reasons, the public release data do not contain\nseasonal or geographic information. On any given day, a\nhigher proportion of MAC adults may eat certain foods than\nthe national average depending on seasonal availability,\ncultural habits, or other factors. As Figures 1 and 2 show,\nthis is likely to be the case for peaches in summer and for\nstrawberries in spring. An intake assessment that ignored\nsuch differences could significantly underestimate dietary\npesticide exposure. This is noteworthy because pesticide\nresidues are often detected in seasonally available commod-\nSome of the differences we observed may also be\nattributable to differences in demographic characteristics.\nFirst, our survey was designed to represent residents of a\nlarge, metropolitan area (Atlanta), whereas NHANES\nincludes rural populations in addition to urban/suburban\npopulations. There is some evidence that eating habits differ\nbetween urban and rural populations even after controlling\nfor race and income (Haines et al., 1996). Second, the MAC\ncohort was slightly younger and with more female than\nNHANES (Table 2). Although we did not find significant\ndifferences by age group or gender in the NHANES data for\nthe majority of foods analyzed, these factors did influence the\npercent eaters of certain foods. For example, the percent of\nbanana eaters among older (age 36\u00ad60) NHANES adults\nwas higher than that of younger (age 18\u00ad35) adults F\n95% CL), respectively (Supplementary Table S1 in the\nSupplementary Information). This age difference in banana\nconsumption was not apparent in the MAC data, however,\nas the fraction of banana eaters only differed by age group on\n8% of the 72 sampling days. Last, the MAC cohort\ncontained a higher proportion of African Americans\ndid not analyze the data by race, the literature contains\nevidence of differences in dietary habits between African\nAmericans and white Americans even after controlling for\nincome and rural/urban status (Haines et al., 1996; McCabe-\nSome of the differences we observed between the MAC\nand NHANES data may also be attributable to survey\nmethodological differences and their associated measurement\nerror, although the magnitude of this error is difficult to\nquantify. Using the NHANES AMPM (Multiple Pass)\nmethod, a trained interviewer might be more effective at\neliciting dietary consumption information, particularly on\nmissing/forgotten foods, than using a participant-driven tool\nlike the iDL. However, participants who record foods in the\niDL as soon as they eat them may be less likely to miss foods\nthan those who wait 24 h to be interviewed. Regardless, it\nappears that both NHANES and the iDL performed equally\nregarding capturing the daily number of foods eaten. The\nweighted mean number of food items recorded per\nwhereas the mean number of food items recorded per day\nFurther, an analysis of the number of foods recorded per\nMAC participant per day showed no evidence of subject\nfatigue (i.e., a significant reduction in the daily number of\nitems recorded) or, conversely, subject learning (i.e., a\nsignificant increase in the daily number of items recorded)\nacross the consecutive study days or months.\nAnother potential source of measurement error lies in the\nscheme we used to match the NHANES eight-digit codes to\nthe MAC categories. In general, we only matched NHANES\ncodes that contained a particular food as the main ingredient\nand not those that contained that food as part of a complex\nrecipe. For strawberries, for example, we did not match five\nstrawberry pie codes to the MAC strawberries category. We\nchose this strategy based on our interpretation of the CDC\ndietary interview protocols, which instruct interviewers to\nprobe for ingredients (CDC, 2006a). However, it is possible\nthat some foods in the NHANES database were recorded as\ncomplex recipe foods (e.g., strawberry pie) instead of as main\ningredients (e.g., strawberries, pie crust), as we would have\nrecorded them in the MAC study. To investigate the effect of\nthis on our results, we developed an alternative matching\nscheme where we matched all of the NHANES codes that\nmentioned a particular food (e.g., all 13 codes containing the\nword strawberry in the description, not including strawberry-\nflavored items) to the corresponding MAC category. We then\nLongitudinal dietary consumption patterns Riederer et al.\nrecalculated the statistics presented in Table 3 using the\nalternative scheme. Detailed results are presented in Supple-\nmentary Table S2 of the Supplementary Information. For\nmost foods, use of the alternative scheme did not change our\nconclusions. Exceptions were pear and white bread/roll.\nWhen we expanded the pear category to include three recipe\ncodes (pies, cobbler, and dried fruit mix), the percent of\nMAC sampling days above the NHANES 95% CL dropped\nresults, we would change our conclusion and say that the\npercent of pear eaters among the MAC participants was\nsimilar to the NHANES estimate. The white bread/roll\ncoding presented a larger problem. There were 195\nNHANES codes beyond the 11 we initially matched to the\nMAC white category. Most of these included complex recipes\nfor sandwiches, hamburgers, and so on, in some cases where\nthe bread grain was not specified, but where white would be a\nroll). When we included these 195 additional codes, the\nNHANES weighted percent eaters jumped from 26.9%\nMAC days below the NHANES 95% CL jumped from\n22.2% to 87.5%. On the basis of these alternative results, we\nwould say that fewer MAC participants reported eating white\nbread/roll than NHANES participants on most sampling\ndays.\nWe report differences in dietary consumption frequencies\nbetween NHANES and MAC adults for certain food items,\nin particular commodities with seasonal availability like\npeaches and strawberries. These comparisons illustrate how a\nlongitudinal study like MAC captures seasonal variability in\ndietary habits in contrast to a cross-sectional study like\nNHANES that is not designed to capture this variability.\nThey also call into question the use of national, cross-\nsectional food consumption databases for characterizing\ndietary patterns in subpopulations and illustrate how doing\nso might lead to an underestimation of pesticide exposure\nwhen seasonal consumption data are annualized. In addition\nto seasonal differences in the consumption of certain foods\n(e.g., peaches), there are seasonal differences in pesticide use.\nFor commodities such as those in Table 3, seasonal\ndifferences in the presence or magnitude of different\npesticides may be significant. Taken together with seasonal\nconsumption differences, the possible error in exposure\nassessment may be magnified.\nAlthough the NHANES sampling plan was designed\nbased on sophisticated statistical methods to capture a\nnationally representative sample, there are physical limita-\ntions to its ability to capture longitudinal or seasonal dietary\nconsumption trends. Specifically, the NHANES sampling\nteam rotates around the country over the survey period\n(CDC, 2009b). A surge in consumption of a given food in\none geographical region during a season that NHANES did\nnot survey would not be adequately characterized by data\ncollected from another region during the same season if that\nregion did not experience a similar surge. Such relationships\nare difficult to characterize if seasonal sampling is not\nconducted in all regions. The National Center for Health\nStatistics has emphasized that NHANES data are meant to\ncapture national trends (CDC, 2006b) that may not apply to\nspecific seasons or geographic regions. This disclaimer is\nsometimes overlooked and the NHANES data are used for\nrisk assessment without proper "
