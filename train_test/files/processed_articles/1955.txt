This article investigates the theoretical and empirical relationship between age identity and subjective well-\nbeing (SWB) in a cross-national context. Feeling younger than one's actual age is considered a self-enhancing illusion that\ncontributes to SWB even beyond factors predicting age identities and SWB, such as health and socioeconomic status. As\nthe United States is more youth oriented than Germany, age identities are expected to be more adaptive for American adults.\nMethods. Data are from respondents between 40 and 74 years of age who participated in the National Survey of\nMidlife Development in the United States (N \u00bc 2,006) or the German Aging Survey (N \u00bc 3,331).\nResults. Analyses using the pooled sample reveal that feeling younger than one's actual age is related to higher levels\nof life satisfaction and positive affect and to lower levels of negative affect, even when controlling for sociodemographic\nvariables. Country-specific analyses indicate that the relationship between age identity and negative affect holds only for\nthe United States.\nDiscussion. Age identities play a role in more varied aspects of psychosocial adaptation in the United States than in\nGermany. It is concluded that the cultural context needs to be included more explicitly in gerontological theories and research.\nWESTERN culture has been criticized for its celebration of\nyouth and devaluation of old age (Fry, 1996). Research\nreveals that older individuals are confronted with ageism on\na daily basis. This ranges from subtle forms of patronizing to\ninappropriate treatment in medical settings and even includes\ninstitutionalized forms such as legislation regarding retirement\n(Pasupathi & Lo\n\u00a8ckenhoff, 2002). In addition to creating a stress-\nful environment, ageism might be turned toward the self with\ndebilitating consequences (Rothermund & Brandtsta\nLevy (2003) found that older persons who were subliminally\nprimed with negative stereotypes of old age performed worse on\nmemory tasks, handwriting, and walking and showed higher\ncardiovascular stress than older persons who were primed with\npositive stereotypes of old age. These findings document the\nincapacitating effects that living in an ageist environment can\nhave for older adults.\nWhereas these effects are beyond cognitive awareness, indi-\nviduals have been found to resist the internalization of aging\nstereotypes on an explicit level (Zebrowitz, 2003). Many older\nadults resist the label ``elderly'' and report youthful self-\nperceptions. Adults in middle and later adulthood tend to feel\nyounger than their actual age, and this discrepancy is larger\nin older than in middle-aged adults (Barak & Stern, 1986;\nAlthough they may be ``old'' according to cultural standards,\nmany people do not feel old individually.\nResisting the internalization of ageist stereotypes can be\nconsidered a self-enhancing strategy (Filipp & Ferring, 1989;\nof which has been shown in studies of physical health\n(Levy, Slade, Kunkel, & Kasl, 2002a) and mortality (Levy,\nindicate that persons who feel younger than they actually are\nreport higher levels of subjective well-being (SWB) (Barak &\nHowever, others find no association (Filipp & Ferring, 1989) or\neven an inverse relation (Montepare & Lachman, 1989)\nwith SWB.\nAt least two aspects of these studies on SWB deserve closer\nconsideration. First, most investigations are not well situated in\nthe literature on SWB. As a result, the choice of measures is not\nalways grounded in theory. Also stemming from this limitation,\nmost studies do not systematically control for social factors that\nmay influence age identity, SWB, or both. As both tend to have\na number of similar correlates such as health and socioeconomic\nstatus (Barak & Stern, 1986), the observed relationship between\nage identity and SWB might be a spurious one. Second, it is\nunclear how far the results of these studies generalize. As nearly\nall studies were carried out in the United States, typically using\nnonrepresentative samples, it remains unclear whether age under-\nestimation has the same adaptive value over the adult life\ncourse in all regions of the United States as well as other\ncultures. Although Western cultures are typically seen in the\nsame way with respect to the denial of old age, one might ex-\npect that there are differences between Western cultures as\nwell. For example, Filipp and Ferring (1989) found no relation-\nship of subjective age with self-concept and life satisfaction in\na German sample.\nOur study investigates the relationship between age identity\nand SWB among middle-aged and older Americans and\nGermans in two nationally representative samples. In the fol-\nlowing, we first discuss the theoretical relation between age\nidentity and SWB. Next, we address possible differences in this\nassociation between Americans and Germans.\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2005 by The Gerontological Society of America\nOver the last several decades, there has been a flourishing\ninterest in the study of SWB (Diener, Suh, Lucas, & Smith,\n1999). Beginning with the study of Andrews and Whithey\n(1976), there is a widespread consensus that SWB is a multi-\ndimensional concept, including cognitive evaluations of life in\ngeneral (i.e., life satisfaction) as well as positive and negative\naffect. These three dimensions represent correlated, yet clearly\nseparable, aspects of SWB (Diener et al., 1999). The different\npatterns of relationships with other variables also document the\nvalidity of the threefold structure of SWB (Westerhof, 2001).\nOne might expect that the SWB of older adults is negatively\naffected by age-related losses of roles and relationships, age-\nrelated declines in psychophysical functioning, as well as\nwidespread ageism in our society. Yet, research has found\nremarkably few age differences in SWB. Only positive affect is\nconsistently found to be somewhat lower in older adults (Diener\nPsychological lifespan theories have focused on the strategies\nby which individuals adapt to age-related changes in order to\nmaintain a positive sense of well-being. Identification with\nyounger ages can be considered such a strategy in a culture\nthat views and treats old age in a negative way (Sneed &\nargued that individuals can compensate for the negative impli-\ncations of ageism by feeling young. This strategy might con-\ntribute to well-being as it belongs to the domain of positive\nillusions. Research on positive illusions suggests that judging\noneself more favorably than objective indicators might warrant\npromotes SWB (Taylor & Brown, 1988). Positive illusions are\nalso important in avoiding negative mental health states such as\ndepression (Alloy & Abramson, 1988). The ability to maintain\npositive self-perceptions, such as feeling young, appears to be\ncentral to psychosocial adjustment throughout life. Hence, age\nidentity is expected to be related to positive as well as negative\ndimensions of SWB.\nAlthough Schulz and Heckhausen (1999) have argued that\ncultural variations in the use of adaptation strategies might exist,\nthis issue has received limited empirical and theoretical attention\nin gerontology. For example, although the model of selective\noptimization with compensation was originally developed in\nGermany (Baltes & Baltes, 1990), it is applied in the United\nStates without taking into consideration any cross-national dif-\nferences. This example has relevance for our study as youthful\nage identities are viewed as a compensatory strategy (Heck-\nhausen & Schulz, 1998). In the following, we will discuss how\norientations toward individualism and collectivism, which are\nconsidered one of the basic dimensions of cultural differences\n(Hofstede, 1980), might be related to the use of youthful identities\nas a compensating strategy.\nThe United States has a stronger individualistic orientation\nThe somewhat less individualistic culture of Germany might\nresult from a cultural history with a traditionally hierarchical and\nfeudal structure of society, more formalized social behaviors, and\nrelatively recent experiences with democracy (Bode, 2003).\nFurthermore, Esping-Andersen (1990) describes Germany as\na corporatist welfare state regime where health care and social\nsecurity are more a concern of the state than the individual. In\ncontrast, the liberal system of the United States is associated with\ngreater individual responsibility for health and social welfare.\nThese differences in value orientations and accompanying\nsocial structures have implications for well-being as well as age\nidentity. Besides wealth, the level of individualism is considered\none of the most important factors contributing to the well-being\n1999). Whereas the United States and Germany do not differ\nmuch with regard to wealth (e.g., the rate of consumption power\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development\n[OECD], 2004), the stronger orientation toward individualism\nin the United States might result in higher levels of well-being.\nIt, indeed, has been found that Americans enjoy greater well-\nbeing than Germans, as measured by life satisfaction and posi-\ntive and negative affects (Diener & Suh, 1999; Veenhoven,\n1993). Individualism adds to the individual possibilities of\nrealizing one's own goals and thus may contribute to well-being\n(Diener & Suh, 1999). However, individualism also might lead\nto a greater tendency to express self-enhancement (Markus &\nIn the American cultural context, one's worth as an individual\nis less a social given than in Germany and needs to be earned\nand demonstrated (Crocker & Park, 2004).\nIndividualism may be related to age identity as well. Indi-\nvidualism tends to be linked with the youth-centeredness of\na culture. In youth-oriented cultures, older persons are at risk of\nlosing self-worth when their economic self-sufficiency or auton-\nomous functioning in everyday life declines (Gergen & Gergen,\n2000). Compared with the German context, the American system\nplaces greater responsibility on individuals to plan for their later\nyears and remain economically productive and thereby stim-\nulates a higher value for youth. In contrast, the German system\ngenerates more collective support, also for older persons.\nAlthough there is a trend toward more flexible life courses in\nboth countries, the welfare state of Germany is more explicitly\nand formally age graded (Dannefer, 2000). For example,\nGermany has a mandatory age of retirement (65 years), and re-\ntirement is basically a single transition that is closely tied to chro-\nnological age (Kohli, 1994). This stronger age-graded nature of\nthe German system might make it more difficult to deny one's\nage. Consistent with these arguments, our prior work indicates\nthat Americans maintain more youthful identities than do\nGermans, in particular at older ages (Westerhof, Barrett, &\nIn addition to the stronger identification with younger ages\nobserved among Americans in midlife and beyond (Westerhof\net al., 2003), one also might expect that the adaptive value of\nyouthful identities is higher in this cultural context. Positive\nillusions are expected to have a stronger impact on positive and\nnegative aspects of SWB in a culture that supports self-enhance-\nment and favors youthfulness to a greater degree. Furthermore,\nthe individualistic system of the United States might leave\nmore room for individual strategies of adaptation to aging\n(Staudinger, Fleeson, & Baltes, 1999; Suh, Diener, Oishi, &\nTriandis, 1998). As both cultures appear to be youth oriented,\nbut the United States more so than Germany, we expect that age\nidentity will be related to SWB in both countries, but this rela-\ntionship will be stronger in the United States than in Germany.\nMETHODS\nSamples\nUnited States. --American data are drawn from the National\nSurvey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS)\nthe MacArthur Foundation's Network on Successful Midlife\nDevelopment. This survey was a random-digit dialing sample\nof noninstitutionalized English-speaking adults aged 25\u00ad74\nyears, living in the 48 contiguous states, whose household\nincluded at least one telephone. In the first stage of the multi-\nstage sampling design, investigators selected households with\nequal probability via telephone numbers. At the second stage,\nthey used disproportionate stratified sampling to select respon-\ndents. The sample was stratified by age and gender; men be-\ntween ages 65 and 74 were oversampled. Respondents took part\nin a computer-assisted telephone interview lasting 30 minutes\non average. Respondents also were mailed a questionnaire\nrequiring 1.5 hours, on average, to complete. The response rate\nwas estimated to be 70% for the telephone interview and 87%\nfor the self-administered questionnaire, yielding an overall\ntwo persons participated in both the telephone and the ques-\ntionnaire phase of the study.\nGermany. --In the German Aging Survey, independently liv-\ning persons between 40 and 85 years old were interviewed in\nconsisted of randomly chosen individuals from the population\nregisters of 290 cities in the Federal Republic of Germany. It was\nresidence in the former Federal Republic of Germany/German\nDemocratic Republic. Fifty percent of those contacted (N \u00bc\nrates were 63%, 56%, and 40% in the respective age groups. A\nface-to-face-interview of about 1.5 hours was held with ques-\ntions concerning life circumstances in different domains (family\nand social relations, work and activities, living arrangements,\nhealth, and income) as well as respondents' evaluations of them.\nA paper-and-pencil questionnaire including several psycholog-\nical scales, attitudinal items, and questions about chronic\nconditions was left with respondents. They filled out the ques-\ntionnaire on their own, and it was collected later by the inter-\nviewer. Four thousand thirty-four respondents returned the\nquestionnaire (a return rate of 83%). Respondents who returned\nthe questionnaire did not significantly differ from respondents\nThe MIDUS sample covers an age range of 25\u00ad74 years and\nthe German Aging Survey 40\u00ad85 years. In this study, respon-\ndents are included in the overlapping age range of 40\u00ad74 years\nemploys cross-sectional data that do not allow the determination\nof causal relationships between age identity and SWB. Our\nmodels assume a causal order (e.g., nationality influences age\nidentity, which shapes SWB); however, relationships are likely\nto be considerably more complex than our data permit us to\nexplore.\nMeasures\nAge identity. --Subjective age has been measured in the two\ncountries with slightly different questions. In the American\nsample, the following question was asked in the self-admin-\nistered questionnaire: ``Many people feel older or younger than\nthey actually are. What age do you feel most of the time?'' In\nthe German sample, the following question was used: ``Aside\nfrom your actual age, when you should express it in the number\nof years, how old do you feel?'' The difference between one's\nactual and subjective ages is used as a measure of age identity.\nWhen a respondent's subjective age is younger than his or her\nactual age, a positive value is obtained; when subjective age\nis older, age identity has a negative value. To avoid the influ-\nence of extreme scores in the regression analyses, the top and\nbottom 1% of the scores were declared missing. Age identity\nranges from \u00c010 (10 years older than one's actual age) to 35\n(35 years younger than one's actual age).\nSubjective well-being. --We examine three dimensions of\nSWB identified in prior work: life satisfaction and positive and\nnegative affect (Diener et al., 1999). In the American sample, the\nlife satisfaction measure was an adaptation of Cantril's (1965)\nSelf-Anchoring Scale. It asked respondents to ``rate their life\noverall these days'' on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst\npossible life overall and 10 is the best possible life overall.\nVariants of Cantril's measure have been used extensively in\nnumerous studies worldwide, usually providing satisfactory\npsychometric properties (Andrews & Robinson, 1991). In the\nGerman sample, the Satisfaction with Life Scale (Pavot &\nDiener, 1993) was used. This five-item scale with a 5-point\nanswering format has good reliability (Cronbach's a \u00bc .86) and\nvalidity in this sample (Westerhof, 2001). The German scale\nwas linearly transformed to scores ranging from 0 to 10.\nThe affect measures in the American study asked respondents\nto indicate on a 5-point scale how much of the time during the\nlast 30 days they felt six types of negative affect (e.g., hopeless,\nnervous, and sad; a \u00bc .87) and six types of positive affect (e.g.,\ncheerful, calm, and peaceful; a \u00bc .91; see Mroczek & Kolarz\n[1998] for a description of the development of these measures).\nIn the German study, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule\n(Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) was used. Respondents were\nasked to rate on a 5-point scale how much of the time during the\nlast month they felt 10 negative affects (e.g., nervous, afraid, and\ndistressed; a \u00bc .82) and 10 positive affects (e.g., interested,\nexcited, and proud; a \u00bc .87). In both samples, the mean fre-\nquency of negative and positive affect was computed.\nSociodemographic variables. --Nationality is represented by\na dichotomous variable: Germans are coded 1 and Americans 0.\nChronological age is measured in years. Gender, socioeconomic\nstatus, health, and marital and employment status are used as\ncontrols as they have been found to be related to SWB (Diener et\n1 for women and 0 for men. Socioeconomic status was assessed\nby educational level and household income. Education is coded\nin the American sample using four categories: did not graduate\nfrom high school, graduated from high school, some college (no\ndegree), and graduated from college. In Germany, three cate-\ngories were used: lower education (Hauptschulabschlu\u00df ohne\nAusbildungsabschlu\u00df), middle education (Hauptschulabschlu\u00df\nmit Ausbildungsabschlu\u00df oder Realschulabschlu\u00df), and higher\neducation (Realschulabschlu\u00df/Abitur mit Ausbildungsabschlu\u00df\noder Hochschulabschluss). The Ausbildungsabschluss (voca-\ntional training) was included in this variable as many older\nindividuals received their training only later in life as a result of\nthe Second World War. These categories correspond roughly to\nyears. In the MIDUS Study, household income was measured as\nthe sum of five separate gross yearly income sources: self,\nspouse, Social Security, government assistance, and all other\nincome sources. In the German Aging Survey, respondents were\nasked for their actual total monthly household income (after\nan explanation of the different income sources that should be\nsummed). Respondents who refused to answer were explained\nthe importance of the question and then asked to indicate which\nof 14 income categories applied to them. These respondents\nwere assigned the middle value of the category they chose. In\nboth samples, missing values were imputed according to age\ngroup, gender, and educational level, and in the German sample\nalso according to place of residence (i.e., former Federal\nRepublic of Germany/German Democratic Republic). This\nGerman sample. The education and income variables were z\nstandardized within each country. The mean of these z scores\nwas computed as an indicator of socioeconomic status (see\nStaudinger et al. [1999] for this procedure). Marital status is\ncontrolled in the analyses; the currently married are coded 1 and\nthe unmarried 0. A dichotomous variable indicating employment\nstatus also is added with respondents coded 1 if currently\nworking for pay and 0 otherwise. Two measures of health are\nused: number of chronic conditions and self-rated health.\nBecause the checklists of chronic conditions differed in the\ntwo studies, only those 12 conditions that were asked in both are\nincluded: cancer, heart condition, diabetes, headache/migraine,\ngall bladder, anxiety, and vascular, pulmonary, orthopedic, uri-\nnary, sleep, and digestive problems. Self-rated health in the\nUnited States is represented by the answer to the question: ``In\ngeneral, would you say your physical health is . . . poor, fair,\ngood, very good, or excellent?'' In the German sample, the\nfollowing question is asked: ``How would you rate your present\nhealth situation?'' Response categories were very poor, poor,\naverage, good, and very good. Both variables were recoded into\nfour categories, indicating (very) poor, fair/average, good, or\nvery good/excellent. Higher values represent better health.\nAnalyses\nWith use of the pooled sample, ordinary least-squares re-\ngression is used to assess the relationship of age identity with\neach dimension of SWB. Explanatory variables are entered in\nseveral steps to assess their unique relationship with SWB,\ncontrolling for variables assumed to be causally prior. In the first\nstep, the dichotomous variable indicating nationality is entered.\nChronological age, gender, and socioeconomic status are added\nin the second model. Factors that may be influenced by one's\nage, gender, and socioeconomic status are entered in the third\nmodel: marital and employment status, chronic conditions, and\nself-rated health. Age identity is entered last to assess whether it\ncontributes to SWB over and above the other factors. Moreover,\nage identity is argued to be influenced, in part, by one's gender\n(Pinquart & So\n\u00a8rensen, 2001) and one's socioeconomic status\nInteraction effects are computed to assess potential differ-\nences between the United States and Germany in the relationship\nof age identity with SWB, controlling for the other variables. The\ninteraction terms of nationality with the other independent\nvariables (i.e., age, gender, socioeconomic status, marital and\nemployment status, objective and subjective health, and age\nidentity) are entered together into the regression equation. When\nthe interaction between nationality and age identity proved\nsignificant, the regression equations were estimated in the United\nStates and Germany separately. T tests were carried out to assess\nthe significance of the difference between the regression coef-\nMissing values were imputed only for income. Respondents\nwho had missing values on one or more of the other variables\nwere excluded from the analyses. Most missing values were\nobtained on age identity (N \u00bc 226), chronic conditions (N \u00bc\nOne thousand seven hundred thirty-six American and 2,762\nGerman respondents were included in the analyses.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 presents mean differences between Germans and\nAmericans on all variables used in the analyses. Significant\ndifferences are observed for all variables except gender and\nsocioeconomic status. Compared with Germans, Americans re-\nport more youthful identities, higher levels of life satisfaction\nand positive affect, and lower levels of negative affect. They are\nyounger, less likely to be married, and more likely to be working\nin the paid labor force. They also report fewer chronic con-\nditions and better self-rated health.\nOur first expectations concerned the relationship between age\nidentity and SWB, controlling for age, gender, socioeconomic\nstatus, marital and employment status, and health. Bivariate\nanalyses indicated that, as predicted, younger age identities are\nassociated with greater life satisfaction and more positive and\nless negative affect. The correlation coefficients range from .20\nTable 1. Variable Distribution by Nationality\nVariable\nUnited States\nGermany\nSubjective well-being\nSociodemographics\nto .24 (see Appendix). Age, socioeconomic status, marital and\nemployment status, number of chronic conditions, and subjec-\ntive health are significantly related to the three dimensions of\nSWB. Gender is related only to negative affect, with women\nreporting higher levels than men.\nAs age identity is significantly associated with all other in-\ndependent variables, it is necessary to control for these indicators\nin the analyses of the relationship between age identity and\nSWB. The regression analysis of life satisfaction on nationality\nshows that Americans experience higher levels of life satisfac-\ntion than Germans (Table 2). The second model reveals that\nolder persons, women, and those with higher socioeconomic\nstatus report greater life satisfaction. Model 3 shows that being\nmarried and having fewer chronic conditions and better sub-\njective health also are associated with higher life satisfaction.\nThese variables partially mediate the relationship between na-\ntionality and life satisfaction; the coefficient for nationality\ndeclines by about 30% but remains significant. Post-hoc ana-\nlyses show that subjective health plays the most important role in\nmediating the relationship between nationality and life satisfac-\ntion. Results also indicate that the coefficient for chronological\nage increases when marital status and health are added to\nthe equation. Controlling for older respondents' greater likeli-\nhood of experiencing widowhood and health declines increases\nthe positive association between chronological age and life\nsatisfaction.\nModel 4 reveals that age identity is significantly related to\nlife satisfaction, even when controlling for other factors related\nto SWB. Those who experience younger identities report higher\nlevels of life satisfaction. The explained variance (adjusted R2)\nincreases significantly when age identity is added to the model.\nAnalyses of positive affect show a small, but significant, re-\nlationship with nationality; American respondents report higher\nlevels of positive affect than Germans. Higher socioeconomic\nstatus, marriage, paid work, fewer chronic conditions, and better\nsubjective health are related to higher levels of positive affect.\nSimilar to the findings for life satisfaction, marital and em-\nployment status and health suppress the association between\nchronological age and positive affect; older respondents report\nhigher levels of positive affect. The variables added in Model 3\nalso suppress the association between nationality and positive\naffect. In Model 2, it was found that Germans report significantly\nlower positive affect than Americans; however, Model 3 in-\ndicates that the reverse is true. Post-hoc analyses show that the\nbetter subjective health of the Americans is responsible for this\nreversal. Adding age identity in Model 4 results in a significant\nincrease in explained variance (adjusted R2). More youthful\nidentities are associated with higher levels of positive affect. In\naddition, age identity suppresses the association between nation-\nality and positive affect, suggesting that if Germans had the more\nyouthful identities of Americans, they would report even higher\nlevels of positive affect. Age identity mediates the effects of\nage on positive affects: The coefficient of age declines by about\none third.\nThe analyses of negative affect more or less mirror those of\nlife satisfaction. Americans, older persons, women, and those\nwith higher socioeconomic status, fewer chronic conditions, and\nbetter subjective health report lower levels of negative affect.\nThe results also indicate a mediating association such that\nAmericans' lower level of negative affect is partially explained\nby their better health; with the inclusion of both indicators of\nhealth, the coefficient for nationality is reduced by 15%. Health\nsuppresses the association between age and negative affect.\nAdding age identity significantly increases the explained vari-\nance, and younger identities are associated with lower levels of\nnegative affect.\nTo summarize, identifying with younger ages is associated\nwith better SWB, even when controlling for sociodemographic\nvariables. Furthermore, Germans report less life satisfaction and\ngreater negative affect; however, taking into account their worse\nsubjective health, they report higher levels of positive affect than\nAmericans.\nOur second expectation was that age identity is more strongly\nrelated to SWB in the United States than in Germany. Including\nthe interactions between nationality and the other independent\nvariables resulted in an increase in explained variance for each\nof the three measures of SWB. However, only in one case (i.e.,\nnegative affect) did the regression weight for age identity differ\nsignificantly between the two countries. As Table 3 shows, age\nTable 2.

Furthermore, in the United States,\nmarriage and chronic conditions appear to be more strongly\nrelated to negative affect than in Germany. Figure 1 illustrates\nthe relationship between age identity and negative affect by\nnationality. The figure plots the regression equations for Amer-\nicans and Germans, imputing the mean scores for chronological\nage, gender, socioeconomic status, marital and employment\nstatus, chronic conditions, and subjective health. It can be seen\nthat Americans experience lower levels of negative affect than\nGermans. Whereas in the United States, those with younger\nidentities (i.e., those with higher scores) experience less nega-\ntive affect than those with older identities, there is no such\nrelationship among Germans. There are no national differences\nin the association between age identity and positive measures of\nSWB (i.e., life satisfaction and positive affect).\nDISCUSSION\nWith use of data on middle-aged and young-old adults in the\nUnited States and Germany, this study examined the relation-\nship between age identity and SWB. Its goal was to better\nintegrate age identity into theories of SWB and to empirically\nassess the derived hypotheses in two nationally representative\nsamples from the United States and Germany. As a self-enhanc-\ning positive illusion, age identity was expected to be an im-\nportant predictor of SWB in cultural contexts in which youth is\nhighly valued. However, drawing on prior work indicating the\nmore youthful identities of Americans compared with Germans\n(Westerhof et al., 2003), it also was anticipated that the asso-\nciation of age identity with SWB differs in the two countries.\nThe results of the pooled sample indicate that maintaining\na more youthful identity (i.e., a larger discrepancy between ac-\ntual and subjective age) is associated with higher levels of SWB,\neven when controlling for chronological age, gender, socioeco-\nnomic status, marital and employment status, and objective and\nsubjective health. In the model of positive affect, the relationship\nwith age identity even mediated the effect of actual age. The\nresults are consistent with the argument that feeling younger\nthan one's actual age may function as a positive illusion that\npromotes SWB.\nThe expectation that age identity is more strongly related to\nSWB in the United States than in Germany receives partial\nsupport. There is no difference in the association between age\nidentity and SWB with regard to its positive aspects (i.e., life\nsatisfaction and positive affect). These findings suggest that age\nidentity can be considered a positive illusion that enhances\npositive well-being among middle-aged and older individuals in\nboth countries. However, the relationship between age identity\nand negative affect holds only among Americans. In other\nwords, the effect of positive illusions regarding one's age ap-\npears to be stronger in the United States in the sense that it not\nonly enhances positive well-being but also protects against high\nlevels of negative affect. This finding could be interpreted as an\nindication that the self-enhancing strategy of identifying with\nyounger ages more effectively promotes SWB in a culture that is\nmore strongly youth oriented.\nAnother interpretation of this finding would be that self-en-\nhancement, in general, is more important in a more individ-\nualistically oriented culture like the United States than in a more\ncollectivist culture like Germany. Our study reveals higher\nlevels of well-being among Americans than Germans and thus\nreplicates previous findings (Diener et al., 1995; Veenhoven,\n1993). However, it should be noted that although this relation-\nship held in bivariate and multivariate analyses of life satis-\nfaction and negative affect, the expected pattern was found only\nin bivariate analyses of positive affect. Models controlling on\nGermans' worse subjective health reveal higher levels of posi-\ntive affect among Germans than Americans. A mediating effect\nfor subjective health is found in the models of life satisfaction\nand negative affect as well. The subjective health experience is\nbetter in the United States than in Germany, and it provides\na partial explanation for the higher life satisfaction and lower\nlevel of negative affect reported by Americans. In another ar-\nticle, we have argued that the better subjective health of the\nAmericans is not a methodologic artifact (Westerhof et al.,\n2003). Hence, we might conclude that some aspects of self-\nenhancement are stronger in the United States than in Germany.\nA high cultural value on well-being, health, and youth appar-\nently provides the context for Americans' greater need for\npositive illusions.\nTable 3.

Regression solution for negative affect by age identity in\nthe United States and Germany. Higher values represent younger\nidentity. Nationality means are imputed for chronological age, gender,\nsocioeconomic status, marital and occupational status, chronic\nconditions, and subjective health.\nA number of limitations of our study should be noted. The\ncross-sectional data limit our ability to determine causal rela-\ntionships between age identity and SWB. Our models reflect the\nassumption that age identity influences SWB; however, it is\nlikely that the relationship is bidirectional. Determining causal\nrelationships will require longitudinal data, which are scarce in\nstudies of age identity. Another limitation is introduced by the\nuse of studies that were not designed to be compared. Because\nthe measures were not always identical in the MIDUS and\nGerman Aging Survey, this might have influenced the results.\nWe believe that there is no basis for predicting that the American\nquestion on subjective age resulted in younger identities than the\nGerman question. The affect measures also show some differ-\nences in the items and question format. As these may intrude\non the relationships between age and affect found in a study\n(Diener & Suh, 1998), we should be careful in interpreting the\ncross-cultural differences with regard to the affective dimen-\nsions of SWB.\nOur study also is limited by the use of a measure of age identity\nthat is rather general; research has shown that people hold\nmultidimensional age identities (Kastenbaum, Derbin, Sabatini,\n& Artt, 1972; Steverink, Westerhof, Bode, & Dittmann-Kohli,\n2001). Similarly, we have not been able to consider other dimen-\nsions of successful aging that have been linked with age identity\nand self-perceptions of aging, like depressive symptoms, other\nindicators of mental health, physical health, and even mortality\nuse of two nationally representative samples compares favorably\nwith the ad-hoc methods of data collection on which cross-\ncultural studies on later life have tended to rely (Dasen & Mishra,\n2000). Our study suggests that further work on cross-cultural\ndifferences is warranted.\nFeeling younger than one's chronological age is considered\na compensatory strategy (Heckhausen & Schulz, 1998). Even\nthough this strategy is found among aging individuals in the\nUnited States as well as in Germany, we now know that it is\nused in a more exaggerated way in the United States and that\nits adaptive value is stronger in the U.S.A. than in Germany. Our\nstudy not only shows that it is worthwhile to explore whether\nother adaptation strategies show cross-national differences as\nwell, it also points out that individual adaptation strategies need\nto be studied in their cultural context. One should be very care-\nful in ``exporting'' theories developed in one cultural context\nto another, even among cultures that are commonly thought\nto belong to the same cultural region. In sum, culture needs to\nbe included more explicitly in gerontological theories and\nresearch.\n"
