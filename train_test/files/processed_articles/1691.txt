Introduction\nThe prevalence of obesity has risen substantially in both adults and children, and is recognized as a\nserious public health problem [1]. Beyond body mass index (BMI) Kg/m2, which is the most\ncommonly used proxy index of obesity, indicators of regional fat distribution such as waist circumference\n(WC) have been linked to cardiovascular disease [2-6], insulin resistance syndrome [7-10], and increased\nrisks of breast, colorectal, and renal cancer [11-13]. A recent study showed small but consistent\nincreases in WC in the U.S. population over calendar time from the 1960s to the present even when\nmeasured at any fixed BMI level [14].\nWhile much has been written about the reasons behind the global obesity epidemic, industrial\ntoxicants found in the environment, the food system, and humans have just begun to receive significant\nattention. Recent evidence suggests that environmental contaminants known or presumed to disrupt\nendocrine systems, appropriately termed endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), may play a role in the\ngrowing problem of obesity [15,16]. These contaminants are mostly persistent in the environment and\nare known as persistent organic pollutants (POPs). It is plausible that POPs lead to preferential\nincreases in abdominal fat because it is known that the hormonal milieu has profound effects on the\nanatomic distribution of fat. However, whether associations between lifetime exposure to low doses of\na mixture of various POPs and measures of adiposity exist in the general population is not known.\nGiven that almost all persons are exposed to POPs, the public health importance of a relation of these\nchemicals with weight gain may be substantial, despite a relatively modest association with any\nindividual POPs.\nRecently, a dose-response relation was observed between serum concentrations of POPs and\nmetabolic syndrome [17], insulin resistance [18], and diabetes [19]. Surprisingly, in people with\nundetectable levels of POPs, the typically robust association between obesity and diabetes was not\nobserved [19]. However, an unanswered question is whether POPs might directly contribute to obesity\nin the population. Lee and colleagues have offered some useful evidence, but their study only treated\nBMI and WC as covariates, not as outcomes to be modeled. Hence, to explore this possibility of POPs'\nassociations with adiposity indicators, we investigated the associations among BMI, WC and selected\nPOPs,-which do not have high affinities for the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr)-, in 1999\u00ad2002 data\nfrom the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 99-02). Some of the examined\nPOPs are dioxins, which are a family of chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds known chemically as\ndibenzo-p-dioxins. Dioxins are highly toxic and persist in the environment for extended periods. They\nare produced during incineration of wastes and are produced as contaminants in chemical\nmanufacturing processes [20]. We examined the measured POPs in that dataset which are\noxychlordane, trans-nonchlor, and p,p'-DDT. The POPs that have higher affinities for the Ahr in the\nNHANES dataset, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), did not show significant\nassociations with either BMI or WC.\n2. Experimental Section\nWe used data from the publicly available nationally representative cross-sectional surveys of the\nU.S. non-institutionalized civilian population conducted by the US National Center for Health and\nand plan, and they both contain data on age, gender, race, height, weight, and WC.\nAnthropometric measures including height, weight, and WC were obtained via standardized\nprotocols as described elsewhere (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/frequency/bmxdoc.pdf).\nMeasures of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), dobenzofurans (PCDFs), and non-ortho\nsubstituted or coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (cPCBs), other polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),\npersistent chlorinated metabolites were assessed in participants on a one-third serum samples. For this\nstandardized home interview was followed by a detailed physical examination in a mobile evaluation\nclinic or the participant's home. PCDDs, PCDFs, PCBs, and organochlorine pesticides were all\nmeasured in serum samples as individual chemicals by high resolution gas chromatography mass\nspectrometry (GC\u00adMS) using isotope dilution for quantification. The POPs were provided by\nNHANES and adjusted for serum total cholesterol and triglycerides. All POPs levels were transformed\nby taking the natural log (ln) of each in order to improve linearity and analyzed in their\ntransformed form.\nWe selected five POPs (present in 80% of the NHANES population): 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzo-p-\ndioxin (hpcdd); 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9-octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (Ocdd); oxychlordane; trans-nonchlor, and\np,p'-DDT. Based on the above criteria, a total of 2,464 participants with valid BMI scores and 2,448\nparticipants with valid WC score were examined.\n2.3. Statistical Analysis\nThe primary analysis used three regression models to test all available participants for associations\nwith overall adiposity as assessed by BMI and WC. Two models regressed BMI and WC on gender,\nethnicity, age, age squared, and POPs. The third model regressed WC on the previous predictors while\ncontrolling for BMI. We will refer to these models as additive models. Each of these models was\nextended by including two-way interactions between gender and the POPs. Secondary/sensitivity\nanalyses employed all of the same models as the primary analyses but evaluated only participants with\ndetectable levels of POPs. All parameter interpretations will be done on using standard deviation units\nbased on standardized regression parameters; ( )\n^ /\nj j j y\nb S S\n\n= .\nAll analyses, including descriptive statistics, were conducted using SAS-Callable SUDDAN 9.0.1,\nwhich estimates standard errors using the sampling weights, strata, and primary sampling units (PSU)\nfrom NHANES taking into account for the complex sampling procedures used.

In the additive\nBMI model there are significant main associations for ethnicity (p = 0.0466),\noverall model accounting for 8% of the BMI variance. Natural log (ln) values for the POPs were used,\nas is typical in this type of study [19]. Expressed in standard deviation (SD) units, each 1 SD increase\nin ln Ocdd, BMI is associated with an increase of 0.249 BMI units and every SD unit increase in\nln DDT is associated with a BMI increase of 0.106 units (i.e., the Beta value for ln DDT = 0.48;\nTable 2). The joint test p-value for the additive BMI model, which is the simultaneous test of\nall 5 POPs, is 0.0001. Additionally, the POPs accounted for 2% of the BMI variance.\nTable 2.

WC increases by 1.76 centimeters with each SD unit increase in ln Ocdd. The\njoint test p-value for the additive WC model is 0.0008.\nFor testing the additive WC model controlling for BMI, there was a significant association for\nvariance (Table 2). In this model, males tended to have 6.40 centimeters higher WC than females.\nHowever, WC decreased by 0.163 centimeters for every SD unit increase in ln hpcdd. This is an\nexception to the general observation that WC increases\nwith POPs exposure. The joint test p-value for\ntesting the POPs simultaneously for the additive WC model controlling for BMI is 0.0798, which is\nnearly statistically significant.\nTable 3 displays the results of the interaction regression models for all participants, and Table 4\ndisplays the interaction regression equations for males and females. The interaction BMI model\naccounted for 10% of the variance and showed significant associations for ln Ocdd (p = 0.0091) and ln\nDDT (p = 0.0020) (Table 3). The model also revealed significant gender interactions with\nincreasing by 0.541 for every SD unit increase in ln Ocdd (Table 3).\nTable 3.

Although the WC interaction was positive for ln hpcdd, male WC tended to increase\nby 2.305 centimeters whereas females decreased by 2.504 centimeters for every SD unit increase ln\nhpcdd (Table 4). For the ln DDT interaction, male BMI decreased by 0.852 while female BMI\nincreased by 2.041 for every SD unit increase in ln DDT (Table 4). The joint test p-value for\nsimultaneous testing for the interactions in the interaction WC model is <0.00005.\nLastly, the interaction WC model controlling for BMI accounted for 88% of the WC variance and\nshowed significant associations for ln hpcdd (p = 0.0060) with a significant gender by ln DDT\ninteraction (p = 0.0056) (Table 3). Not surprisingly, age and BMI were both positively associated with\nWC. However, as in the previous model, WC decreased by 0.452 cm for every SD unit increase in ln\nhpcdd (Table 3). The significant interaction shows that male WC decreases by 0.120 cm whereas\nfemale WC increases by 0.111 cm for every SD unit increase in ln DDT (Table 4).

Table 7 shows that for the gender by ln Ocdd interaction male WC decreases\nby 0.398 and female BMI increases by 6.054 for every SD unit increase in ln Ocdd.

Comparison of All Participants and Participants with Detectable POPs Models\n. WC stands for waist circumference. Numbers in parentheses are standard errors.\nConsistent findings for the additive models with all participant and participants with detectable\nPOPs were as follows: The additive BMI models showed consistent associations for ethnicity, age, age\nsquared, and ln DDT. For the additive WC model, the consistent associations were for gender, age, and\nln Ocdd. Lastly, the additive WC model controlling for BMI show consistent finding for gender, age,\nBMI, and BMI squared.\nConsistent findings for the interaction models for all participants and participants with detectable\nPOPs were as follows: The interaction BMI model showed consistent associations for age, age squared,\nand ln Ocdd. The interaction WC model showed consistent associations for age, ln Ocdd, and ln DDT.\nIn addition, it had consistent gender by ln oxychlordane and ln DDT interactions. Lastly, the interaction\nWC model controlling for BMI had consistent associations for age, BMI, BMI squared, and ln hpcdd.\nLastly, the additive and interaction models were estimated with all participants ages 19 and up\n(results not shown but available upon request). Results of these analyses were consistent with the\nresults of the equivalent models with all participants. Specifically, all parameter estimates were in the\nsame directions and those that were significant (or not significant) remained significant (or not\nsignificant). The one exception occurred with the interaction model of waist circumference controlling\nfor BMI. In this model the parameter estimate for European Americans went from non significant to\nsignificant and the parameter estimate for age went from significant to non significant.\n4. Conclusions\nConsistent effects were found for Ocdd and/or DDT with BMI. In addition, a relatively consistent\nassociation between WC and hpcdd controlling for BMI was found. To the extent that our associations\ncan be speculated to represent causation, on average, one of the toxic effects of these chemicals appears\nto be weight gain. Unlike the well-known weight loss resulting from high exposure to POPs, this\nweight gain may occur at much lower levels of exposure, levels which fail to make animals or humans\nobviously ill [21]. A couple opposite gender effects was also identified. Oxychlordane is associated\nwith BMI increases in males but a BMI decreases in females (Tables 6 and 7). Conversely, DTT is\nassociated with WC decreases in males but WC increases in females (Table 4). A speculation, which\nneeds further validation, is that this might have to do with hormonally-directed differences in fat\nstorage in men versus women. Men tend to be \"apples\" and store their fat in the waist, whereas females\ntend to be \"pears\" and store their fat in their hips. POPs might be affecting this process.\nBecause of their previous extensive usage as pesticides, their inherent structural stability, their\npersistence in body systems and their ability to concentrate in animals that are higher up on the food\nchain, many POPs are currently present in human fat in relatively high levels. Much of any chemical-\ninduced weight gain may come from increases in the overall proportion of body fat. In one animal\nstudy, the pesticide dieldrin more than doubled the total body-fat content of treated mice [22]. Another\nstudy showed that a pesticide, commonly known as lindane, induced obesity in animals [23]. In yet\nanother study, the overall weight gain effect of another pesticide, hexachlorobenzene, appeared to be so\npowerful that a group of treated animals still managed to gain significantly more weight despite the fact\nthat their food intake was cut by 50% relative to untreated controls that were on full food\nPersistent organic pollutants, synthetic and industrial chemicals, appear to cause weight gain by\ninterfering with most of the different elements that comprise the human weight control system. In\nparticular, these chemicals have been shown to disrupt major weight controlling hormones, such as\nthyroid hormones, estrogens, testosterone, corticosteroids, insulin, growth hormone, and leptin [25]\nand to alter levels of, and sensitivity to, neurotransmitters (in particular dopamine, noradrenaline, and\nserotonin [26]. They interfere with many metabolic processes and cause widespread damage to body\ntissues and cardiovascular disease [27]. This interference may result in changes in appetite, in food\nefficiency, and in fat, carbohydrate, and protein metabolism. The desire, and ability, to exercise\nalso may be affected. These changes have been thought to be responsible for increases in body\nWhat are the contributions of POPs to pre-diabetes and diabetes disorders? Lee and colleagues\nhave recently shown a dose-response relation between serum concentrations of POPs and metabolic\nsyndrome [17], insulin resistance [18], and diabetes [19]. They claimed that the expected association\nbetween obesity and diabetes was absent with people with low concentrations of POPs [19]. However,\nPorta argues that the adjustment for BMI and WC in the published studies might be an over\nadjustment, because dietary fats are a major source of POPs [36].\nThese investigators determined that POPs have a much greater association with these diseases in\nobese people compared with non-obese people. They hypothesize that the toxicity of POPs related to\nthe risk of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and diabetes substantially increases as people get\nmore obese [17]. However, another possibility is that POPs, in addition to their contribution to\nmetabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and diabetes, might also directly contribute to obesity. The\ncomplex interactions among POPs, obesity, and diabetes-related disorders make the determination of\nthe contribution of a single component difficult. Long-term longitudinal cohort studies with repeated\nmeasurements of BMI, WC, and POPs levels and continued model organism experimentation could\nhelp solve this problem.\nAre environmental chemicals responsible for the obesity epidemic? Keith and colleagues coined the\nphrase \"The Big Two\" to refer to two commonly presumed causes of the obesity epidemic, namely\nfood marketing practices and institutionally-driven reductions in physical activity [30]. The Big Two\nare likely contributors, but there are several other likely contributors, such as POPs [30]. The particular\nPOPs studied herein were chosen in this study because they are present in over 80% of the NHANES\npopulation. However, the concentrations of some POPs in general have been decreasing in the past two\ndecades in the U.S. population because of stricter regulation [31], whereas obesity has been increasing\nduring this same period. According to NHANES data, obesity (i.e., BMI > 30) has increased from\nwe explain the strong dose-response relation between serum concentrations of POPs and obesity? A\npossibility is that the effects of the POPs were on neonates 20 years ago, and that this is only now\nbecoming manifest in the adult population. This theory is called the \"developmental origins of health\nand disease\" (DOHaD), or the \"Barker hypothesis,\" because it was first proposed by Barker\nand colleagues [32].\nAn excellent example of DOHaD that is related to POPs and obesity is recent work done by Retha\nNewbold and colleagues [16,33]. In pioneering work started in the 1970s, Dr. Newbold and colleagues\nshowed that the potent estrogenic compound diethylstilbesterol (DES) can increase the incidence of\nuterine cancer and testicular atrophy in the children and grandchildren of pregnant mothers given this\ncompound, which was used in humans to treat morning sickness [34,35]. In recent studies, they\nshowed that low doses of DES (0.001 mg/kg) given every day for the first 5 days after birth can induce\nobesity in post-pubertal mice [16,33]. Whether a similar phenomenon occurs in humans will be the\nsubject of future investigations.\n"
