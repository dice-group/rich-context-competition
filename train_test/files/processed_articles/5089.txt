About a decade and a half ago, John Friedmann\n(1998) lambasted `how reluctant planning theorists generally are to incorporate dimen-\nsions of power into their work' (p. 252). Nevertheless, how to productively understand\nand conceptualize what power is, and how it is performed, appears to have been a\nmajor issue of interest and boon of contention in planning studies at least since the\nbroad introduction of political economy perspectives into the field in the late 1970s\ndebates were rekindled with the advent of communicative planning theory in the late\nattention resulting from the strong influences of Foucault in the late 1990s and early\nground-breaking study of Aalborg (which we will have reason to return to in some detail\nbelow) `the Foucauldian approach has been gaining the upper hand' (p. 116) in critical\nplanning studies relating to the issue of power.1 The purpose of this article is to retain\nsome of the important insights from this line of work, while nevertheless highlighting\nwhat we see as seriously problematic aspects of how the Foucauldian conceptualization\nof power has become incorporated into critical planning studies. Our main concern with\nthis strand of scholarship is the way influential work in this tradition conceptualizes the\nnature of power. We particularly wish to query the problem of enacting power as a mys-\nterious matter that `just is' and, as such, functions as a self-reproductive primus motor\nbehind the unfolding of societal events. In this article, we will therefore try to pry open\nthis `black box' of power (cf. Callon and Latour, 1981), taking the important analysis of\nthe `substantive micro-politics' of planning (Flyvbjerg and Richardson, 2002: 53) intro-\nduced by Foucauldian planning scholars a few steps further towards an `ultra-radical'\nanalysis of power (cf. Lukes, [1974] 2005). We will do so by way of a destabilization of\nsome of the unwarranted and often only faintly articulated assumptions that appear to\nunderpin most of the scholarly work in this vein of planning studies. Put otherwise, we\nwant to closely investigate and scrutinize the `dark matter' of the `dark side of planning'\nwhich has hereto been largely left taken for granted and unattended to in critical planning\nstudies, that is, questions about the substantial definition of `power'.\nOur overarching aim in this article is thus to demystify the concept of `power' and\nwhat it purports to be describing, making those practices grouped under this label more\ntangible and, hence, also more readily contestable. We will find the resources to do so\nwithin the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS), and particularly in Bruno\nLatour's injunction that social scientists must not too readily confuse the explanandum\n(what needs to be explained) with their explanans (the explanations). Explaining how the\neffects we label as `power' are produced, instead of using `power' as an in-itself all-\ncovering explanation of societal events, demands a conceptualization of power as the\noutcome of social processes rather than as a causal variable behind them. We believe that\nsuch a take on power is necessary to both re-invigorate and nuance the academic debate\non power in relation to planning, particularly in the face of the dominance of neoliberally\ninclined planning cultures in our times (Haughton et al., 2013).\nThrough building upon, but also significantly diverging from previous research in\nplanning studies that draws upon Lukes' ([1974] 2005) typology of the `three dimen-\nsions of power', we will attempt to demonstrate the value of our approach with an\nempirical study of a referendum regarding a major urban development in a Swedish\nsuburban municipality, Upplands V\u00e4sby. The case is interesting in this context\nbecause it functions as somewhat of a `limit case' that demonstrates the circum-\nscribed explanatory reach of currently established conceptualizations of power in\nplanning studies. The case aptly shows how strong assumptions regarding the domi-\nnance of, for example, pre-existing powerful actor-constellations or purely economic\nrelations are not always very helpful for understanding the unfolding of power\ndynamics in planning processes, instead highlighting the need for more acute atten-\ntiveness to the micro-physics of power play across multiple fault lines. Furthermore,\nalthough not analysed specifically in the article, the case raises questions concerning\nhow struggles of this type enact and channel broader societal conflicts about what\nconstitutes a good direction of action, a good future \u00ad and in extension, a `good com-\nmon world', questions that Bruno Latour labels as cosmopolitics. We end the article\nwith a suggestion that the development of methodological approaches that can help\nelucidate this aspect of power dynamics may offer critical planning scholars oppor-\ntunities to better leverage what we see as the strength of Foucault's conceptualiza-\ntion of power: the linking of the `big' and the `small' in societal power dynamics, but\nwithout falling into the trap of making unwarranted a priori assumptions about the\ncausal relationship between the two.\nConceptualizing `power' in critical planning research\nIn current critical planning research, the lack of a common conceptualization of `power'\nis clearly manifest; there is simply no broadly shared idea of what the concept of power\nactually describes. Is `power' best understood as a `stuff`', as a particular type of action,\na specific type of relation or a force of a particular kind? Is it a label we graft onto spe-\ncific types of effects? Or certain processes? Or any given combination of the above? The\nissue is further clouded by the fact that very few authors who presently write about\npower in relation to planning processes actually go through the trouble of providing a\npositive definition of what they mean by this term, generally only taking it for given or\nimplicitly self-defined what they mean when they use this word. Among more recent\ncontributions to critical planning scholarship that actually go through the pains of clearly\ndefining what they mean by the concept of `power' are Fox-Rogers and Murphy (2014),\nwho approach this term from an explicitly Marxist angle. True to the more orthodox\nstrand of this theoretical tradition, they focus on economic power, claiming that such\npower determines societal influence in the last instance. Accordingly, they state that `the\nability of stakeholders to participate in and shape the collaborative process is largely\ndetermined by the availability of resources available to them (i.e. economic power) with\nsuch practices often resulting in \"the continued dominance of the already powerful\"'\nWhile we are sympathetic to Fox-Rogers & Murphy's overarching goals of exposing\ngrave injustices in planning processes and while also agreeing that there often exist\nstrong continuities in societal power relations, we nevertheless feel obliged to point out\nthe deeply problematic aspects of such a myopic focus on economic resources under-\nstood as `power reservoirs' (reinforced by a language portraying `holders of power' as\n`vested interests', `exercising' their power).2 Probably, the authors are themselves aware\nof these problems, as they initially, as evinced above, provide qualifiers such as `largely'\nand `often'to many of their most sweeping theoretical claims. But alas, these nuances are\nswept away in their subsequent analysis, and in their conclusions, they boldly and unre-\nservedly claim that `whether power operates within the formal structures of planning or\nnavigates through a shadow system, it remains, in essence, functional to the existing\nCompared to orthodox Marxism, Foucauldian approaches to power assemble a much\nmore fine-grained toolbox for analysing power dynamics. There are obviously many vari-\nants of Foucauldian planning studies; however, Bent Flyvbjerg's (1998) Rationality and\nPower: Democracy in Practice appears to have become something of a magnum opus of\nthis tradition of scholarship. In the introduction to the book, Flyvbjerg (1998) explicitly\nconceptualizes power as `a dense and dynamic net of omnipresent relations', which is not\n`simply localized in \"centers\"', nor `something one can effectively \"possess\"' (p. 5).\nAdditionally, he is very forthright that he is not interested in `who has power and why they\nhave it' but in `how power is exercised' (Flyvbjerg, 1998: 5). And finally, he adds, he is\ngenerally interested in how, in relation to power dynamics, `[t]he Great is found in the Small'\n(Flyvbjerg, 1998: 6). This is also where our issue with `Flyvbjerg's Foucault' (cf. Certom\u00e0,\n2015) really becomes manifest, and it precisely has to do with how he in his narrative enacts\nthis relationship between the `Great'and the `Small'and the depicted unidirectional causal-\nity between these two, where all through the book \u00ad over and over again \u00ad the `Great'(exist-\ning asymmetric power relations in the case he studies, the city of Aalborg) are constantly\nfaithfully reproduced in just about every micro-situation he portrays. In his narrative of the\ncase study, vested interests are simply continuously re-invested, nothing ever changes and\nexisting power relationships are only reproduced, or even reinforced.\nFlyvbjerg formulates some pretty bold and sweeping `propositions' on the nature of\nrationality and power in his final chapter. Nevertheless, his theoretical discussion does\nnot provide any sort of intellectual equipment to help conceptualize how power relations\nmight ever change. As he himself states, `power defines, and creates, concrete physical,\neconomic, ecological and social realities' (Flyvbjerg, 1998: 227). But following this he\ncompletely sidesteps and leaves unspoken what in turn then `defines'and `creates'power.\nFurthermore, even if he duly provides an offhand remark that power relations `are not\nimmutable in form or content', he immediately thereafter skips over any kind of substan-\ntial discussion of the potential mechanisms of such change, to instead focus on all the\nwork performed to generate the `maintenance, cultivation and reproduction' of existing\nTo Flyvbjerg's defence, it should definitely be added that his main objective in the\nbook was to discredit the neutrality of `reason' in relation to `power' and not to present a\nstudy of the potential transformability of power relations. Nevertheless, the static con-\nceptualization of power that he offers remains completely unequipped to deal with any\ntype of shifts in pre-existing power relations. Another problematic aspect of Flyvbjerg's\naccount of power is the sliding in the analytical definition of power in his narrative.\nWhereas the concept is initially articulated as something akin to a socially productive\nrelational effect, a slippage then occurs where he increasingly instead writes about it as\nan elusive object the further we advance into the story. Towards the later parts of his\naccount, power is clearly understood as some insidious dark matter, an oppressive\nresource which actors (generally `vested interests') can be `in possession' of. At the end\nof this process of mutation, power even becomes pictured as something of a primus\nmotor of social action: a mysterious, eternally self-reproductive force which `lies behind'\nIn relation to the above, it is important to point out that Flyvbjerg's appropriation\nof Foucault is to an extent somewhat idiosyncratic. Rather than constituting a clean\nbreak with either Marxists or Habermasians, his conceptualization of power manifests\nstrong continuities with these two approaches. By enacting power as an insidious and\noppressive, but at the same time a-personal and anonymous resource of domination,\nFlyvbjerg's concept of power in the worst of cases lapses into an eternally static\nmurky mysterianism: power begets power, begets power ... If we instead want to take\na closer look at the uneasy patchwork of often conflicting tendencies, forces and\ngroupings that hide behind such an un-nuanced generalization, we require a different\nset of entry points into power dynamics. We need conceptual and methodological\nequipment that provides a gritty, nuanced analysis of the `micro-physics of power'\n(Foucault, 1979a: 26\u00ad27) within the micro-politics of planning, standing Flyvbjerg's\n`Great' and `Small' on its head by trying to understand how some actors grow power-\nful and `Great' by way of studying their concrete activities and practices in the\n`Small'. We will therefore now turn to a discussion of how the disciplinary ground of\nSTS can provide us the resources with which we can begin to assemble such a new set\nof intellectual equipment.\nIntellectual equipment for de-mystifying power in planning\nprocesses\nFor our aims, it seems promising to turn to the field of STS and more specifically to\nActor\u00adNetwork Theory (ANT) because of its habit of approaching power not as a taken-\nfor-granted explanatory variable, but rather as an effect that itself needs to be explained.3\nThis understanding is developed in Latour (1988), where he discusses how dramatic\nshifts in power relations (asymmetrical relations of privilege and subordination between\nheterogeneous elements) come about through the creation of `new sources of power and\nther clarifies his position:\nPower is never possessed. We can have it, `in potentia', but then we do not have it [since we can\nnever predetermine how it will unfold in practice]; or we have it `in actu', but then our allies\nare the ones that go into action [`allies'here understood broadly as both human persons, things,\nWith satirical references to Moli\u00e8re and Machiavelli, he dismisses those who would\nexplain the unfolding of societal events by way of `power':\nThe philosophers and sociologists of power flatter the masters they claim to criticize. They\nexplain the masters' actions in terms of the might of power though this power is efficacious\nonly as a result of compliances, connivances, compromises and mixtures ... which are not\nexplained by power. The notion of `power' is the dormitive virtue of the poppy which induces\nsomnolence in the critics at just the moment when powerless princes ally themselves with\nAccording to this approach, a lacks in concreteness in the study of power thus risks\nleading to a reification of existing power relationships, mystifying them as necessities\ninstead of enacting them as the contingent effects they always constitute in practice. As\na consequence, such analyses of power botches the chance to point out, in some specific-\nity, how existing `powerful' societal actors are often colossuses on feet of clay that can\nonly ever operate through complex and convoluted, always arbitrary, chains of transla-\ntion and mediation \u00ad which then potentially always can be undone or reversed, even if\nthe resources to do so are not necessarily available at any given moment.\nThis is a point further elucidated by Callon and Latour (1981). They argue that if\nostensive analysts of power take as a given premise of analysis the qualitative or quanti-\ntative differences between macro- and micro-actors, they will never be able to explain\nhow powerful actors are formed, and worse than so, by explaining power with power,\nthey help rationalize and reify existing power relationships in society, making any poten-\ntial change or reversal in power relationships appear as unreasonable, therefore making\nthe already powerful `purr with relief, for their structure disappears from view' (Callon\nand Latour, 1981: 298). The approach they instead suggest as a route towards a more\nproductive understanding of why some actors become `big'and/or `strong', that is `pow-\nerful', is to stay attentive to `the processes by which an actor creates lasting asymmetries',\nand the number of relations that allows actors to alter their relative size (Callon and\nwhich is inherent in their nature. All differences in level, size and scope are the result of\na battle or negotiation' (p. 279; emphasis in original). So as to avoid becoming a co-\nculprit in the mystification of power, the research task of the critical social scientist then\nbecomes framed as the duty to `escort the powers back to the galleries and networks from\nwhere they came', to `locate them in the gestures and the works that they use to extend\nthemselves'and to finally `avoid granting them the potency that lets them dominate even\nin places they have never been', through unwittingly aggrandizing the symbolical power\nof mystified `power' in, for example, social scientific scholarship that takes power as a\nKeeping the above, as well as our aim to provide intellectual equipment for de-mysti-\nfying (rather than reifying) power in mind, we can then proceed to somewhat shame-\nlessly borrow a few existing concepts for analysing power, such as Steven Lukes' three\ndimensions of power, if modified in line with this purpose. For example, we to some\ndegree find Steven Lukes'account of agenda-setting power, formulated in his framework\nas the second dimension of power,5 helpful in how it highlights the ability of certain\nactors to become powerful through the exercising of a situated capacity to keep specific\nissues off the political agenda. Nevertheless, we would prefer to also supplement this\ndefinition of a negative and suppressive capacity with Schattschneider's (1960) more\nnuanced understanding of agenda-setting power which also highlights the potency\nrelated to being able to frame the agenda through a number of different methods, for\ninstance, including how issues that are brought up are presented, who is invited to dis-\ncuss them and within which parameters options for resolving the issues are articulated.\nThis latter account is more in line with our ANT-inspired approach since it is more open,\nand therefore also more agnostic, towards how agendas are formed and who or what is\ninvolved in doing so.\nWhen it comes to what in Lukes' framework is termed the third dimension of power,\nrelated to the power to shape desires and convictions, Lukes is explicitly operating within\nand defending a traditional Marxist-realist ontological framework in which actors are\nimagined to have `objective interests' even if they are not aware of them since they are\nduped by `false consciousness'. From our ANT-inspired vantage point, we find it both\nethically and practically problematic to impute and attribute such given interests to actors\nand instead suggest that it is generally more analytically rewarding to view interests as\nalways generated contextually and relationally (cf. Callon, 1986). Thus, we do not find\nclaims towards uncovering `objective interests' very helpful for the analysis of power\ndynamics, but rather suggest that we travel further along the trajectory embarked by\nLukes ([1974] 2005) himself, ever so cautiously, in the second edition of his book: that\nis, through understanding the third level of power from a (late-)Foucauldian angle, as\ntruth/power regimes that constitute `formations' in society which operate beyond the\nlevel of conscious individuality (cf. Foucault, 1979b on `regimes of truth').\nThis suggested re-conceptualization of the third dimension of power to some degree\napproximates the post-Marxist `neutral' concept of ideology professed by, for example,\nStuart Hall (1983) or Laclau and Mouffe (1985), questioning the existence of any firm\nground from which to make a distinction of what differentiates `distorted' from `real'\ninterests, concluding that the only ground from which to claim that one truth/power\nregime is `distorting' interests is from within the confines of another competing such\nregime, which we for some reason (more or less reflexively) find to be `better'. Thus,\nsuch an approach to the third dimension of power allows for no imagined objective base-\nline located outside different regimes of truth/power from which one can tell whether\nyou are actually `breaking free from the devitalising effects of ... power' (Schmidt-\nThom\u00e9 and M\u00e4ntysalo, 2014) or not, only the identification of different regimes that\nenact the `real' interests of actors in different ways.\nFrom the above perspective, social formations of any kind, as well as individual per-\nsons, can readily be identified as sites of conflict between different regimes of truth/\npower, often across numerous fault lines at the same time, some which are more articu-\nlated and manifest than others at any given time. Thus perceived, the third dimension of\npower then becomes graspable as basic and often taken-for-granted (but never self-\ngiven) assumptions about what is desirable, valuable, good and so on. Conflicts and\nclashes between such `takes' on the world have been called `cosmopolitical' by Latour\n(2004), that is, constituting fundamental disagreements over `how to compose the good\ncommon world'. Such conflicts seldom entail a reflection over why, and with what con-\nsequences, these values and beliefs are upheld in the face of alternative approaches, and\nfar too often begs reflexivity regarding questions such as `when I act, what am I enact-\ning? What acts through me?'\nAnalysed from such a perspective, power does not appear as mystical or ethereal but\nrather fully material, relationally embedded in materially heterogeneous arrangements\n(often including but not limited to books, brains, building designs, technological devices,\netc.). It may include reflexive and unreflexive as well as conscious and unconscious\naspects, but it is fundamentally a-personal. Adopting this approach thus allows the ana-\nlyst of power to go looking for `fairly coherent and large scale ordering patters in the\nnetworks of the social' which `generate, define, and interrelate elements in relatively\ncoherent ways' (Law, 1994: 107). In this aspect, our chosen approach closely dovetails\nwith a Foucauldian research agenda (also see Law, 1994). But it also carefully differenti-\nates itself from the previous, as well as most of the related `Governmentality' literature,\nin that it nevertheless also insists upon the importance of also staying empirically atten-\ntive to the complexities, contradictions and incoherences resulting from how such `large\nscale ordering patterns' are enacted, reformed and contested in spatio-temporally situ-\nated practice, and which therefore further demands that the analyst stays attentive to how\n`patternings in the networks of the social change, peter out, break down' (Law, 1994:\n108), thus avoiding the totalizing `from-above' perspective sometimes associated with\nFoucauldian analysis (cf. Harris, 2011).\nTo summarize the above and relate it back to the present discussion, it is our appre-\nhension that the mainstream of critical planning studies is stuck in an ostensive definition\nof power and a lack of conceptualization of the `micro-physics of power'.6 What we offer\ninstead, with inspiration from ANT, is a perspective that does not take for granted that\npower is the explanatory variable, but instead points out that what is subsumed under this\nconcept is that which needs to be explained. From such a perspective, it would never\nsuffice to analyse the outcomes of a specific planning process by simply claiming `they\nhad their way, because they had power/were powerful' (in crude pseudo-marxist vari-\nants: `they had the money, therefore they had their way'). Rather, it is precisely the study\nof how such power is performatively enacted, how power is harnessed or generated in\nthe process, that becomes the interesting object of research. In performing an analysis of\na planning controversy along the lines suggested above, we will now try to illustrate the\nanalytical productiveness of approaching `power' as a relational effect produced in pro-\ncess rather than as a self-reproductive primum movens behind societal dynamics.\nPower dynamics in and around the V\u00e4sby Sj\u00f6stad\nreferendum\nTo be able to discuss these issues further, in some concretion and specificity, we offer a\nstudy of the power dynamics of a contentious planning process in which it was far given\nfrom the outset who would emerge as `victorious'. The municipality Upplands V\u00e4sby is\nlocated 30km north of Stockholm. Already in 2005 the Social Democrats, at the time the\nlocal governing party, initiated the idea to develop a new urban area by Lake M\u00e4laren,\nkm west of the city centre of Upplands V\u00e4sby. As the Swedish national centre-right\npolitical coalition `the Alliance' came into government position in 2006 and held the\npower until the election in September 2014, the work on the plans was intensified and\nframed as a pilot project including a large budget for the realization of the new approach\nto improved citizen dialogue and participation that the municipality had initiated at the\ntime. The planned area was named V\u00e4sby Sj\u00f6stad (`V\u00e4sby Sea City') and the idea was\nthat a new residential area by the lake should not only appeal to present residents of the\nmunicipality but could hopefully also attract people from other municipalities in the\nvicinity of the growing city of Stockholm so as to strengthen the local tax base.\nA few environmental groups including the Green party opposed these plans from the\nvery outset. As the area to be developed expanded in the planning process, so did their\ncriticism. In 2010, the idea of a local referendum7 on the issue took hold within the oppo-\nsition, which then formalized a network to campaign for this idea. The campaign was\nsuccessful, and the municipality decided to follow through with a referendum in\nSeptember 2014, in connection to the general election. The result of the referendum also\nturned out in favour of the No-side, and the plans for V\u00e4sby Sj\u00f6stad were terminated.\nWhat led to this result? We will in the following show that the `winners'succeeded by\ndrawing upon unexpected resources, making unforeseen connections, displacements and\ntranslations. None of the resources that the opponents to the plans managed to mobilize\nwere `power tools' lying around waiting to be deployed or `power reservoirs' waiting to\nbe tapped. Rather, they appear as the results of practical interventions, which generated\neffects of influence and authority that we can label as `power' only a posteriori. Thus,\nbased on our approach presented above, we will focus on how practices and devices situ-\nationally contributed to forging and remaking sets of relations that can explain what\nhappened in the Upplands V\u00e4sby conflict.\nThe case study is based on 17 semi-structured interviews conducted in October and\nNovember 2014.8 Questions posed were both of a more general character about the\nmotives to engage in the issue and more specific questions about the studied process, for\nexample, which competences was brought in from the municipality or externally, argu-\nments for and against the plans that preceded the referendum, as well as the motives for\nand conduct of the referendum. All the interviews were recorded and transcribed. The\ninformants will in the following analysis be presented as officials (O), politicians (P),\nconsultants (C) or citizens (Cit.)\nConflict in the making \u00ad forming the agenda and mobilizing alliances\nAs stated above, although the idea for urban developments in the area had been presented\nalready in 2005 and provoked some negative responses, it was not until a few years later\nthat conflicts escalated.Acontributing factor was when the municipality in 2009 received\na 70-page-long well-illustrated sketch for a comprehensive plan as a donation from a\nfoundation established by a local citizen, outlining the development of the area in ques-\ntion. As noted in the introduction of this donated publication, the aim of the foundation\nand its project Urban City Research initiated in 2002 is to contribute to the diffusion of\nknowledge about `good urban planning' and the sustainable city. In addition to the\narrangement of various conferences and workshops and funding of research and teaching\non the subject, the foundation has decided to support a selection of pilot municipalities\nspecifically in the development of various urban plans. The above-mentioned sketch for\na comprehensive plan of the city of Upplands V\u00e4sby, produced by the Urban City\nResearch (2009) group in collaboration with a consultancy firm, is one example of this\ntype of support.\nA debate quickly evolved around this publication that came to be labelled `The Gift'.\nSome argued it was unacceptable that an individual citizen (who in addition happened to\nbe very wealthy) in this way tried to influence municipal development by donating a\nprivately procured draft plan:\nWhen a very rich billionaire offers such a gift to a municipality, who on top of it is active in one\nof the political parties there, then the reaction isn't, which one may think, `Alright, let's do this'.\nOn the contrary, it became super sensitive because the opponents were provoked and became\nengaged in seeing to it that democratic procedures were strictly followed, more than ever. (C2)\nA resistance group had already been formed at an earlier stage. However, representa-\ntives of this group now became increasingly active in mobilization. Following this, a\nsmaller group of citizen-activists began to advance the idea of demanding a local refer-\nendum. They formalized a network called `Vote at the referendum' to run the campaign,\nand later representatives of some of the local political parties joined the mobilization,\nparticipating in local door-to-door campaigning on the issue, as well as collecting names\nand signatures (P5). The issue began to spark broader local engagement, also among the\nother political parties in the municipality. It was the Social Democrats who had initiated\nthe V\u00e4sby Sj\u00f6stad plans in 2005 when they were still in office. From having been ousted\nin 2006, they had been described as `flip-flopping' regarding the development (O4), but\nbefore the election in 2010, they eventually shifted side and joined forces with the Green\nand Left parties on the opposing side.\nIn October 2011, the No-side-in-becoming submitted a document to the municipality\nwith signatures of a little bit more than 10% of the municipality's citizens, which is the\npercentage needed to mobilize the realization of an advisory referendum according to the\nSwedish Act on Municipal Referendum ( SFS, 1994: 692). This action led the city coun-\ncil to decide, in February 2012, to organize an advisory referendum in connection to the\ncoming general election in September 2014, regarding the possible development of a\nnew urban area by the shore of Lake M\u00e4laren. As this decision was taken, the formalized\nnetwork `Vote at the referendum'transformed by taking the name `No to V\u00e4sby Sj\u00f6stad'.\nThe members of the network appointed spokespersons to represent the network in public\ncommunications. One interviewed politician describes the arguments of the No-side as\nsimple and straightforward: `What they did really was to bring forward the unique values\nof the natural environment. And that's fairly simple to illustrate through a picture' (P2).\nFor example, the No-side could show (and argue) that an alder grove, mushroom-picking\narea, unique outcrops, dog-walking area and the premises of an Orienteering Club would\nall be destroyed if the municipality would go ahead with the plans.\nA slogan used by the No-side was `Save the Runby forest'. This was an old slogan\noriginally used by an activist group that was active in the area several years before the\ndiscussions about this particular plan started. In 2007, the Green party arranged a meet-\ning to mobilize the opposition, which led to the reactivation of this slogan that later\nbecame central to the arguments articulated by the network `No to V\u00e4sby Sj\u00f6stad'.\nHowever, as noted by several interviewees, it was not clear exactly where this forest was\nsituated and what area actually was implied. The contentiousness of this issue was dis-\ncussed by one of the local public officials:\nIf you say `Save the Runby forest', nobody in the street would know what the Runby forest\nwas. But the No-side was fast to explain that it was the green area west of the village Runby.\n[But] on the map, if you look at the map [interview person pointing at the wall], you actually\nsee the Runby forest as a tiny green spot. (O1)\nA similar matter, described by an interviewed consultant, regarded the definition of\nthe so-called `green wedge' (a type of semi-formal green-belt planning designation)\nwhich is part of the plan's territory. There were divergent opinions about the location and\nextension of this green wedge:\nIt became controversial and the opponents argued that we suggested building houses in the\ngreen wedge, but we argued that it was not within the green wedge but on the other side;\napparently it is a matter of definition. The green wedge needs to be of a certain size in order to\nhave biological and recreational qualities, we discussed that at length with our ecologists [...]\nBut it spurred critique among some citizens and some environmentalists. (C2)\nEven if there were some predefined restrictions (the designation and appropriate size\nof a green wedge) and involved expertise (the ecologists), the agenda was not set con-\ncerning how to discuss or establish the value of the natural environment. What the `Save\nthe Runby forest' initiative brought up to the agenda created uncertainties around the\nlocality and size of the pre-designated green wedge as well as what natural phenomena\nto value. In addition, the potential allies to mobilize around the mission to save the forest\nwas rather open as it could include a range of interests and values from the protection of\nunique outcrops to people's daily routines and preferred recreational activities \u00ad allies\nthat as an effect also became linked to the opposition to the plans to build V\u00e4sby Sj\u00f6stad.\nHow interests in this case were generated contextually and relationally (cf. Callon,\n1986) can be seen in relation to the relatively early initiative by a small network of envi-\nronmental groups to hold a referendum. This turned out to affect also how other networks\nwere formed, as this created a Yes/No dichotomy even before a `Yes-side' could be said\nto exist in a mobilized formed. It was not until December 2013 that a formal citizen-\ngroup in support of V\u00e4sby Sj\u00f6stad was formed. A non-profit organization was estab-\nlished, but it was well over 2years after the No-side had mobilized their networks. While\nthe argumentation from the No-side was relatively simple and straightforward, the argu-\nmentation from the Yes-side was more complicated and defensive. One of the inter-\nviewed Alliance politicians describes the Yes-side as more `messy' and circumscribed,\npartially due to the partisan political colour of the project and also because of the inher-\nent complexities of the plan (P2). The Yes-side was further impeded by the No-side's\norganization of a boycott against the local food store because the owner of the store\nbecame engaged for the plans to build. The boycott led the owner to refrain to a more\npassive role and several interviewees describe how this incident also had effects on other\nmerchants in the area, who abstained from engaging on the Yes-side due to the fear of\npotentially incurring boycotts against their businesses.\nAmong our interviewees, there were also ideas expressed about existing `powerful'\nsocietal actors. For example, several interviewees argued that the mass media affected\nhow citizens perceived the whole project. A public official highlighted that there was\nmore negative media publicity around the V\u00e4sby Sj\u00f6stad project than there was positive:\n`the opposing side had been very successful in their rhetoric, in a way that appealed to\nthe media, and was easy to publish' (O1). An interviewed politician also expressed this\nidea and argued that some pejorative terms were frequently used in published articles on\nthe V\u00e4sby Sj\u00f6stad project, labeling it as a `Gold coast' and `Posh area'. An interviewed\ncitizen who worked actively on the Yes-side perceived this as quite surprising since the\nwhole project, according to her, actually had the ambition to counteract the existing elite\ncharacter of the area (with an already existing constituency of mainly wealthy people in\nexpensive houses). An interviewed politician from the governing Alliance felt that the\nYes-side had underestimated the force of this rhetoric used by the No-side which `man-\naged to create an image of the project as an elite project for wealthy people'. This was\nseen as negative by older citizens in the municipality viewing Upplands V\u00e4sby as a tra-\nditional working-class municipality. Another, somewhat different pejorative image that\nwas frequently referred to was that V\u00e4sby Sj\u00f6stad was a `concrete project' by the shores\nof lake M\u00e4laren, which are generally valued for their natural scenery.\nAn interviewed public official described that the atmosphere at the ambitious citizen\ndialogues regarding the project that were initiated by the municipal authorities initially\nwas positive and understanding. But according to this public official, public opinion\nabout these activities was then coloured by one or two critical Letters to the Editor in the\nlocal newspaper, which gave rise to a lot of negative reactions from citizens who had not\nbeen to the meetings, but formed their opinion of them based on these negative reports.\nThe public officials in the municipality worked hard to engage citizens in the planning\nprocess for V\u00e4sby Sj\u00f6stad, and sometimes felt that actors such as the local free newspa-\npers worked against them.\nIt is hard, however, to explain what happened in this case solely by reference to the\n`media' as a powerful actor. The two local free newspapers `Us in V\u00e4sby' (Vi i V\u00e4sby)\nand `My Upplands V\u00e4sby' (Mitt Upplands V\u00e4sby) did certainly become allied to the\nNo-side, but in an alliance with many more actors and elements involved. The `Gift' has\nalready been mentioned as an object that served to trigger the conflict in a particular way,\nthe initiative to hold a referendum had effects on how networks mobilized and the Runby\nforest could serve as an ally not only as a forest but also as a green spot on the map, trig-\ngering a discussion about the boundaries around the green wedge. But there were also\nother elements, for instance, the naming of the project as V\u00e4sby Sj\u00f6stad (meaning `V\u00e4sby\nSea City') which also had an impact on the development of the controversy.\nThe concept of `Sj\u00f6stad' was already known through the internationally renowned\narea Hammarby Sj\u00f6stad (`Hammarby Sea City') in Stockholm and thus had positive\nconnotations, at least within planning circles. There was an important difference\nbetween transforming Hammarby and V\u00e4sby into `Sea Cities', though, that proved to\nbe an obstacle for the Yes-side that introduced the concept to label the V\u00e4sby plan.\nWhen Hammarby Sj\u00f6stad was established, it transformed an industrial area into a\ndense, urban residential area close to the water. The area designated to V\u00e4sby Sj\u00f6stad\nwas never an industrial area. A public official describes how they despite this chose\nthis term: the `density of building'of Hammarby Sj\u00f6stad `was never the plan for V\u00e4sby\nSj\u00f6stad, but still the idea was to get a sense of urbanity. So the municipality thought the\nterm was not so bad' (O1).\nThe No-side, however, was very fast to respond, as one politician of the opposition\ndescribes it:\nThen came this 'smart' idea `We will call it V\u00e4sby Sj\u00f6stad, then people will associate to\nHammarby Sj\u00f6stad'. This was odd and could be used in the debate. From our side, the opposing\nside, it was easy to say, well, this is the only sea city project in which you cut down all trees and\nstart to build ... In all other similar projects, it is harbours, harbour areas and the like (that is\ntransformed into `sea cities'). (P3)\nA lot of tensions had emerged during the process, and finally in September 2014, this\nculminated in the referendum that was going to settle the issue once and for all whether\nthe new residential area `V\u00e4sby Sj\u00f6stad' should be built or not. The result from the refer-\nNo-side had won, but only with 986 votes. In total, 22,923 citizens voted which meant\nthat the voter turnout was 70% of the municipal population. The referendum took place\nthe same day as the general elections in Sweden and the result from the municipal elec-\ntion was a shift in local government. The new local government and the former local\ngovernment agreed that they would respect the result of the referendum, which meant\nthat the plans for the new area were shelved.\nIn light of all the above, it becomes obvious that any explanation of these events that\nwould claim to know a priori who the powerful actors in the situation were, and what\ntheir sources of power consisted of, would have some difficulty in holding up to scrutiny.\nRather, the case provides ample material to illustrate how none of this was clear from the\noutset, but that both the constitution of the most powerful actor (the `No' network) and\nthe sources of power it employed were all constituted in the process itself, as events\nunfolded. Aspects of this process of power formation on the part of the `No-side'\nincluded, but were not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The formation of a clear `No-side'in relation to the development of V\u00e4sby Sj\u00f6stad\nthrough the establishment of a coalition of initially quite disparate interests such\nas local residents, nature conservationists, some political parties and parts of the\nlocal press. Ironically `the Gift', the donated comprehensive plan for the develop-\nment of the area, was a very contentious object that eventually became an ally for\nthe No-side, even if certainly not intended as such;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The construction of a clear Yes/No dichotomy in relation to the plans through the\nforcing of a referendum, which to a large degree foreclosed potentials for nuances\nand negotiations, as well as limited interest in substantial engagements with\nimproving the plans;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The renegotiation of local geographical boundaries and connected values to force\na settlement in their favour, through working to, for example, define the object\nV\u00e4sby Sj\u00f6stad (`posh place', `concrete project'), define the context (threat against\nthe `Runby forest', local amenities and local identity) and discredit the opposition\n(`billionaires', `elite', `business');\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The nimble and responsive undermining of the opponents'engagement through,\nfor example, the discrediting and delegitimization of public participation/\ncommunity planning efforts in the local press and putting economic pressure\non local businesses who supported the plans.\nIn the next section, our final discussion, we will further develop the implications of\nthese insights in relation to the study of power in planning. This will also open up towards\na challenging discussion concerning the `third dimension of power'.\nConcluding discussion\nIn the V\u00e4sby Sj\u00f6stad referendum, it was not given from the outset who would be victori-\nous, and it certainly was not those with the greatest economic resources who prevailed in\nthe end.9 The `winners'(the No-side) rather succeeded through drawing upon unexpected\nresources, making unforeseen connections, displacements, translations and perhaps also\ngoing beyond the expected arsenal and theatre of combat.10 In the case of V\u00e4sby Sj\u00f6stad,\ninventiveness and successful mobilization of a variety of sources of power and legiti-\nmacy (cf. Latour, 1988: 40) appear to have been particularly decisive for the outcome of\nevents. There were no `power tools' sitting around waiting to be deployed or `power\nreservoirs' waiting to be tapped. Rather, these appeared as the results of practical inter-\nventions that generated effects of influence and authority when configured/translated/\ninserted in specific ecologies of action or `action nets' (Czarniawska, 2004) \u00ad effects\nwhich we can then retrospectively label as `power'.\nAt this point, it is important to clarify that our errand with pointing out the above has\nnothing to do with any ludicrous claim about there not existing any asymmetries in\npower relations or fantasizing that these would not generally be quite obdurate. Rather,\nour objective is to dispel some common, and what we regard as rather unproductive,\npresuppositions for studies of power dynamics in planning \u00ad so as to open up the field for\nmore open-ended and agnostic explorations into the sometimes surprising micro-physics\nthrough which power is generated in practice. What we are specifically pointing to is\nhow creative and innovative practice may function to undermine and subvert existing\npower relationships. That is, we can never allow ourselves to take for granted that what\nappears as power in potentia, in seeming `reserve', also in practice will function to gen-\nerate power in actu, that is, in a particular context and situation. Rather, we must always\nbe prepared to recognize `the slight surprise of action' (Latour, 1999) which turns the\ntables, and sometimes radically so. The lesson is at least as old as the story of David\nversus Goliath; how can we time and again keep lulling ourselves into the belief that the\ndynamics of societal power are easily predictable or simple to understand?\nKeeping the above in mind, we now wish to revisit Lukes'third dimension of power as\nreconfigured above. This is the dimension of power in which `The logic is perfectly clear,\nthe aims decipherable, and yet it is also the case that no-one is there to have invented\nthem, and few who can be said to have formulated them'(Foucault, 1981: 94\u00ad95), further\nleading F\u00e9lix Guattari to conclude that `The real subjectivity in modern States, the real\npowers of decision ... cannot be identified with any individual or with the existence of\nany small group of enlightened leaders. It is still unconscious and blind ...' (Guattari,\ntiation between `power over' and `power to' (the former often implicitly framed as `evil'\nand the latter as `good'), makes little sense. Instead, power is neither, since both of these\nterms imply a level of mastery and control of power-wielding actors fully grasping the\nreasons behind their actions \u00ad but fails to problematize that such actors seldom reflect\nupon how these guiding ideas and apprehensions are formed on an unconscious level in\nthe reproduction and mutation of trans-individual regimes of truth/power.\nConceptualized accordingly, the third dimension of power consists of the emergent,\npatterned effects of innumerable small moves to enrol heterogeneous types of resources\nso as to attempt to influence or steer the unfolding of some event that, taken together,\nboth create and often also sustain broad asymmetric relationships between different ele-\nments of what we call `society'for a shorthand. Furthermore, every single societal power\nstruggle then also in various ways (re)produce, channel and transmute these broader\nsocietal forces, but surprisingly often either consciously or unconsciously also creatively\nreconfigure them in the process. This move thus allows for an empiricization of this\notherwise difficult-to-grasp dimension of power, opening up its `black box' and making\nit less intangible and transcendent, and accordingly also less untouchable.\nQuerying the V\u00e4sby referendum from our reworking of this dimension of power nev-\nertheless also demands that we also asked: when the No-side won, what was it that was\nwon? What battle were they fighting? And further, recognizing this not just as a local\nclash over a particular urban development but also as part of broader cosmopolitical\nstruggles and associated lines of conflict regarding the understanding of what constitutes\ngood local environment, a good society and a good common world. Zooming out, this is\nwhere the third dimension of power, the broad regimes of truth/power that reproduce so\nto say `over the heads' of the actors, is often analytically located \u00ad in the form of some\ntectonic scale of societal power relations which appear to exist on a level and time axis\nabove and beyond the everyday scurrying of individual societal actors in the pithy power\ngames. But we are wary to reintroduce by the way of a backdoor such a new mysterian-\nism of power, having just done away with another. Therefore, we suggest to cut down to\nsize the boogie man of truth/power regimes by instead conceptualizing these as the emer-\ngent, repercussive effects of power-making practices, perhaps particularly in the sym-\nbolic and cognitive registers, which function through both working on and creatively\ngenerating `common sense' and `public opinion' (and in extension then, also `publics';\nOne way to practically frame such a turn would be to call for a research focus on the\nnoopolitics that underpin cosmopolitics. In classical Greek philosophy, the concept of\nnous was employed to describe `mind', and more specifically in Plato and Aristotle, the\npart of the intellect that regulates and underwrites all other intellectual processes, for\nexample, establishing the premises from which logical reasoning then proceeds and\nconditioning the sense (and sensation) of when a person has `gotten something right'.\nIn line with this, Hauptmann (2010) and Lazzarato (2006) discuss noopolitics as the\npolitics of forming minds \u00ad of formatting the premises for `reason' and from which\nreasoning then proceeds. But as Frichot (in press) reminds us, noopolitics, the `politics\nof thought' that conditions `structures of thought' (Neidich, 2010), cannot be grasped in\nisolation from `the politics of affect', that is, the conditioning of `structures of feeling'\n(Williams, 1977). Focusing on the influence of the explosive development of new media\non noopolitics Hauptmann (2010: 12) reflects that `the relevance of noopolitics in\ncontemporary discourse and practice is integrally connected with memory and mind\nand to theorizing the relations between the forces and forms of communication'. Such a\nrenewed research interest in the power dynamics of noopolitics by no means precludes\na recognition of how semiotic practices are always also material, thus demanding a\nmaterial-semiotic approach (Law, 2008). Hopefully, it could potentially also contribute\nto further de-mystifying processes of human subject formation by not treating subjec-\ntivity as a coherent nucleus, but instead as a conflict-ridden `site' (Thrift, 2008), that is,\nyet another `black box' to be opened up and examined with regard to its `plug-ins'\n(Latour, 2005) and in relation to complex and friction-ridden processes of subjectifica-\ntion (see, for example, Deleuze, 1988 and Rose, 1996). Such a research agenda can\nhopefully also function as a space for cross-fertilization, friction and mutual reinforce-\nment between, on one hand, the emerging movement of relational-materialistic plan-\nning scholarship inspired by ANT and, on the other hand, established strands of critical\nplanning scholarship with an active interest in processes of subjectification (e.g. Grange,\nSo we finally land in difference and repetition: redux communicative planning, but\nposing its problem in a very different \u00ad far more wicked \u00ad modality (cf. Metzger, 2014),\nrecognizing the importance of always analysing processes of subject formation, social\ngroup formation and environmental transformation in the wider sense as irrevocably\nentangled and co-constitutive processes (Guattari, 2000). Such a new interest in com-\nmunication in planning would, based on the above, to some extent focus on how power\nis generated through the formation and enactment of subjectivity, the question that occu-\npied Foucault towards the later years of his life and which has been preliminarily dis-\ncussed by, for example, Metzger (2013) in relation to the planning process. But a deeper\ninvestigation of these aspects of power will, alas, demand another paper at another time\n\u00ad a challenge we hope someone else will pick up the mantle to tackle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/\nor publication of this article: Jonthan Metzger's and Linda Soneryd's work on this article was con-\nducted as part of the FORMAS-funded research project \"Enacting legitimate concerns: constitut-\ning and managing stakeholder involvement\" (2013-1282).

Of course, such hegemony is never complete. Traditional Marxist approaches, such as that of\nFox-Rogers and Murphy (2014), further discussed in the following, as well as Post-marxist\ntakes such as those of Grange (2014), Servillo (2010) and updated versions of Critical Theory\nand other neo-marxist approaches also exist side-by-side with this current mainstream of\ncritical planning studies.\n 2. Among Marxists, this appears to be the standard way of conceptualizing power in planning,\n 3. In the following, we will particularly focus on directly drawing upon work within the Actor\u00ad\nNetwork Theory (ANT) tradition of Science and Technology Studies (STS). Nevertheless, the\nparticular strand of ANT-related work that we build our argumentation upon also chimes with\nother work on the topic of power within STS. Specifically relating to issues of planning and\n 4. In the play `The Imaginary Invalid', Moli\u00e8re lampoons those who would explain the sleep-\ninducing properties of opium by way of referring to its inherent `dormitive capacity'. The ref-\nerence to `princes' is an allusion to Machiavelli's classic study of power, The Prince, and the\npoint Latour is making is that any powerful actor is never powerful on the basis of inherent\nproperties, but rather due to the ability to forge `alliances' and relations to many other people\nand things, putting the actor at the helm of a large network of heterogeneous relations that\nall contribute to generating the actor as powerful (the question if it is actually productive to\nunderstand this actor as `at the helm' of the network, or rather the network at the helm of the\nactor is a productively unresolvable point, see also in the `Concluding discussion' section).\n5. The first dimension being `coercive power', that is, the power to push a decision through\nagainst the explicit will of another actor.\n 6. The one great exception here is Hillier's nuanced conceptual work in Chapter 3 of Hillier\n(2003), as well as her short conceptual discussion on page 10 in the same book, which closely\napproximates the perspective presented in this article. See further also Hillier (2007: 24).\n 7. Referendums can be held both on a national and on a municipal level in Sweden and are often\nheld in connection to the general election. Referendums are in general only advisory and the\ngovernment (local or national) can make a decision that is counter to the result. Sweden's\nLocal GovernmentAct enables citizens to take initiative to a referendum. If 10% of the inhab-\nitants in a municipality are in favour of a referendum, the local government is obliged to take\nup the issue (and a qualified majority of two-thirds of the votes of the municipal council can\nstop the initiative).\n 8.

Perhaps, a study based on a more fine-grained and sophisticated holistic theory of capital,\nsuch as that of Pierre Bourdieu, grasping the events as a clash of different fractions of the\nsocietal elite, could potentially have generated interesting results in the V\u00e4sby Sj\u00f6stad case.\nAlas, such an analysis remains outside the scope of this article.\n10. cf.
