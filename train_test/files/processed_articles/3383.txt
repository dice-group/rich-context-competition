These novels\nthus foreshadow the postmodernist questioning of the basis of discrete personal identity. The article claims that, across\nthese novels, the act of passing and its relationship to human identity through time and historical circumstance becomes\nproblematized from a necessary tool for escaping slavery, and so sustaining identity in its most basic form as life itself, to a\npotential existential dilemma of identity as a matter of authenticity and possibility.

As M. Guilia Fabi\nEarly African American novelists used [the awareness that\npersonal identities are constructed] most obviously to explode\nwhite delusions of the naturalness and legibility of race, but they\nalso moved on to a deeper and more complex discussion of \"the\n`praxis'of identities\" in the making of black culture . . . (pp. 5-6)\nAt the same time, the issue of identity formation and cul-\ntural context has long been seen as fundamental to discussions\nof postmodernist literature and ethos. In Framing the Margins:\nThe Social Logic of Postmodern Culture, Phillip Brian Harper\n(1994) brings concepts about postmodernism, in particular, that\n\"postmodern fiction foregrounds subjective fragmentation\"\n(p. 3), to bear on literary works that \"occupy the cusp between\nthe modernist and postmodernist enterprises, and thus . . . con-\nstitute prime material for an inquiry into the social problemat-\nics that subtend contemporary postmodern practice\" (p. 24).\nHis purpose is to interrogate and expand our understanding\nof and, notably, our theories about the postmodern and, espe-\ncially, about postmodern identity. P. B. Harper (1994) exam-\nines works that are about characters who differ from the\nsocial \"center\" of power, or what P. B. Harper (1994) quotes\nAudre Lorde as calling the \"mythical norm\" of being \"white,\nthin, male, young, heterosexual, Christian and financially\nsecure\" (p. 13), in terms of race, gender, sexual orientation,\nand social class. P. B. Harper (1994) highlights these charac-\nters as members of marginalized groups and \"suggest[s] that\npostmodern decenteredness may actually be a function of the\nincreasing implication in the `general' culture of what are\nusually thought of as socially marginal or `minority' experi-\nIn this article, I apply Harper's thinking about fragmented\npostmodern identity to the issue of racial passing1 and trace the\ntreatment of that motif across six African American novels:\nThe President's Daughter: A Narrative of Slave Life in the\n1Worcester State University, MA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nCharles Cullum, Worcester State University, 486 Chandler Street,\nEmail: ccullum@worcester.edu\nFrom Necessity to Possibility:\nPostmodern and Heideggerian Aspects\nof Passing and Identity in Early African\nCharles Cullum1\n Keywords\npostmodern identity, African American literature, racial passing, philosophy and literature, Martin Heidegger\n2 SAGE Open\nThe Bondwoman's Narrative, A Novel, by Hannah Crafts\nThe Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man, by James\nauthor's name). These novels, I contend, move from the\nlargely realistic perspective of the 19th century to the subjec-\ntivist perspective of the early 20th century and that fore-\nshadow the postmodernist questioning of the basis of discrete\npersonal identity. I claim that, over the course of these nov-\nels, the act of racial passing and its relationship to human\nidentity through time and historical circumstance becomes\nproblematized from a necessary tool for escaping slavery,\nand so sustaining identity in its most basic form as life itself\nto a potential existential dilemma of identity as a matter of\nauthenticity and possibility. That is, as these novels move\ntoward what might be termed a more postmodern sensibility,\nthe issue of identity can be seen to become more postmodern,\nor potentially open, as well. For, as bell hooks (1990) has\nobserved, \"postmodern critiques of essentialism which chal-\nlenge notions of universality and static over-determined\nidentity within new culture and mass consciousness can open\nup new possibilities for the construction of self and the asser-\ntion of agency\" (p. 28). In this movement, the cultural condi-\ntions that pertain to the individual and his or her identity are\nalways seemingly in question, that is, whether the individual\nis constrained by any aspect of his or her background, espe-\ncially, by race itself, or is a totally free, ungrounded agent. Of\ncourse, the very concept of \"racial identity\" has come to be\nrecognized as an artificial construct of the colonial European\npowers of the 19th century and their rationale for enslave-\nment and colonialization of subject peoples of color. As\nNaomi Zack (1997) in her well-known essay, \"Race, Life,\nDeath, Identity, Tragedy, and Good Faith,\" summarizes,\nThe concept of race as ordinarily used in racialized and racist\ncultures is based on pseudoscience and ill will. Even though race\nis commonly taken to be biological, not all people of a racialized\ngroup have the same heritable biological traits. No genes or\nchromosomal markers for any of the designated groups have\nbeen identified. There are also no verified correlations between\nso-called biological traits and any cultural traits. Empirically,\nthe assumed biological foundation of race turns out to be nothing\nmore than a changing range of biological traits--no different\nfrom other biological traits by anything biologically \"racial\"\nabout them--that have been selected as racial. (p. 99)\nThe liberatory power of racial passing is, therefore, sub-\nject to the critical point of acceptance or rejection of the con-\ncept of race itself. For her part, Zack (1997) goes on to make\nthe existential case for the rejection of the concept and of its\npotential for affecting one's actual life:\nI submit that to experience oneself as a member of an oppressed\nrace in the existential return-to-life after awareness of death\nconstitutes an intolerable constraint on freedom after the return\n. . . The perpetual moment of freedom is therefore raceless. Race\nhas nothing to do with my life in the existential sense of identity.\nTaking the opposite view is no less a philosophical voice\nthan that of George Yancy (2008), who maintains that, as fac-\nticity, race does indeed matter:\nFrom the perspective of whiteness, I am, contrary to the\nexistentialist credo, an essence (Blackness) that precedes my\nexistence . . . My darkness is a signifier of negative values\ngrounded within a racist social and historical matrix that predates\nmy existential emergence. (p. 1)\nWhile conceding that race \"is not real qua constituting a\nphysical property of the universe\" (p. 34) nonetheless, Yancy\ninsists that \"race is `out there'in a socially ontologically sub-\nstantive way\" (p. 34, emphasis in original).\nIn this article, I find it helpful to the discussion to apply\ncentral phenomenological tenets from the work of Martin\nHeidegger.2 For example, I would contend that it is precisely\nbecause of Heidegger's work in healing the schizophrenia\nbrought about by Descartes and, arguably, the whole of\nEuropean metaphysical thought since the Greeks that\nHeidegger's work can be especially helpful in offering a\nview of human being that rejects the mind\u00adbody duality\nprevalent in the racialized context of African American lit-\nerature and American culture. More than any other philoso-\npher since Descartes, I would argue, Heidegger succeeded in\noffering an alternative to the Cartesian dilemma, the fateful\ndivision of Being into the subjective and objective, that\nforced humans from their natural home on the earth and\namong others and into their own subjectivity as the only\nepistemological perspective possible. Descartes's goal was\nto locate a foundation for science and ultimately for an\nunderstanding about the essence of human being itself. By\nlocating this ground in the intellect--\"Cogito, ergo Sum\"--\nDescartes believed that he avoided the vagaries of the senses\nand of ordinary experience. However, the price of his locat-\ning this ground in the human intellect was to create a new\ndualism between the mind and the body, between the subjec-\ntive and the objective, between \"the world of intellectual\nintuition\" and \"the world of phenomenal experience\" (Fell,\nLike You Know: African-American Autobiography and White\nIdentity that the racial distinction of Black or White is based\non \"the dualisms that dominate the Western tradition\" (p. 14)\nand that this duality precedes Descartes and is, in fact, char-\nacteristic of Western philosophy since its beginnings:\nThe particular forms of economic and political hegemony which\nwe practice are articulated through what is essentially a\nmetaphysical construction. The primary dualisms of the Western\ntradition are between mind and body, culture and nature, general\nand particular. These dualisms are coded into European\nlanguages or, it has been suggested (by Derrida among others),\nare constitutive of European languages. So, if black is coded as\nphysical, natural, and particular . . . and white is coded as\nintellectual, cultural, and general, this calls into service the vast\nmachinery of Western conceptuality that has been developing\nsince the Greeks. (p. 14)\nThe thought of Heidegger offers a way out of this dualism\nand therefore a potential means of striking at the very heart\nof the racism that results from that dualism. In Being and\nTime, Heidegger (1962) defines \"the entity which each of us\nis himself and which includes inquiring as one of the possi-\nbilities of its Being . . . by the term `Dasein,'\" (p. 27) or\n\"Being-there\" (p. 27, fn. 1), \"there\" referring to Being-\nin-the-world. One of the \"existentials,\" or ways that Dasein\nis aware of itself as existing, is state-of-mind, which\nHeidegger (1962) defines as \"our mood, our Being-attuned\"\nto the world and to our past in it (p. 172). One of the major\ncharacteristics of state-of-mind is \"thrownness,\" our \"factic-\nity,\" the \"that it is and has to be\" of Dasein (p. 174, emphasis\nin original), the things that we are physically, socially, and\nhistorically over which we have no control. In its thrown-\nness, Dasein is already in the world. In terms of the question\nof a first cause or a ground to human being, then, Heidegger\nimpossibility of the metaphysical quest for a transcendental,\nnonrelative ground; the quest contradicts itself by being always\nalready grounded in the experience of the absence of a final\nground . . . the true and always-prior ground is the clearing,\nDasein's own Being-in-its-world. (As cited in Fell, 1979, p. 58)\nIn other words, the\nprimordially given \"I\" or self is always and already part of the\nworld; and indeed, a world in which other persons are likewise\ngiven . . . the highly abstract and purely rational \"ego\" of the\nIt is characteristic of European and European-American male\ntheoretical production that it fails to acknowledge its sources in\npersonal experience and in social situations. In particular it fails\nto acknowledge its location in the social situation of privilege\nand oppression . . . Left to my own devices, I disappear as an\nauthor. That is the \"whiteness\" of my authorship. This whiteness\nis, for us, a form of authority; to speak (apparently) from\nnowhere, for everyone, is empowering, though one wields\npower here only by becoming lost to oneself. (p. 6, emphasis in\noriginal)\nHowever, in contrast to this European tradition and the\nreason that Heidegger himself saw his work as representing\na turn away from--or, famously, the \"end\" or \"completion\"\nhis approach, one's being is always already \"in the world.\" It\nis not possible by definition to deny one's \"social situation,\"\nor to transcend--that is, meta--the physical world. In the\nprocess of my investigation, I use a number of Heideggerian\nconcepts that are particularly apt in elucidating fundamental\naspects of identity expressed in these novels. Specifically, I\nuse the Heideggerian existentials, or modes of existence, of\nstate of mind, fallenness, and understanding, and the\nHeideggerian concept of historicality as delineated through\nheritage, fate, and destiny. History, in Heidegger's view, \"is\nabout the worlds of those Daseins whose stretch-along\nbetween their respective births and deaths constitutes a sig-\nfor Heidegger, is the existential awareness through which\none understands being in history. There are three grounds to\nhistoricality: heritage--or tradition, a part of thrownness;\nfate--the awareness of finitude; and destiny--part of being\nwith others as applied to a whole people or nation.\nMoreover, I discuss an important aspect of the postmod-\nern attitude that Phillip Brian Harper (1994) does not exam-\nine, specifically, that fragmentation of existing systems of\norder, even of an individual's sense of his or her own subjec-\ntivity, can be not only marginalizing and debilitating but also\npotentially liberating, or at least enabling of possibilities.\nAnd, just as Harper sees the condition of decenteredness of\nmarginalized characters as being so within the structure, the\ncenteredness, of society, these horizons of possibilities are\nthemselves contained within cultural and historical contexts.\nIn that sense, the postmodern aspects of a character are not\napolitical or ahistorical, but are rather always already\nengaged in the social as well as the phenomenological world.\nAs Africana philosopher Robert Birt (1997) claims,\nTo become human and develop a human identity is a process of\ninvention (self-invention), of personal and collective action\nconditioned by social relations. If Sartre is right that in claiming\nthat \"freedom is impossible to distinguish from the `being' of\nhuman reality,\" then we humans can invent ourselves and create\nautonomous identities. But we do so through actions and choices\nconditioned by our social existence. (p. 206)\nAnd, this social process is different from traditional\nEuropean approaches. Relating this self-invention to the exis-\ntentialist thought of Jean-Paul Sartre, Lewis R. Gordon (1997),\nin his introduction to Existence in Black: An Anthology of\nBlack Existential Philosophy, cautions that, although \"Sartre\nstands as an unusual catalyst in the history of black existential-\nist philosophy\" (p. 2), \"it will be an error to construct Africana\nacademic existential philosophy as a fundamentally Sartrean\nor European-based phenomenon\" (p. 3) because,\nalthough there are Africana philosophers who have been\ninfluenced by both Sartre and European thought, for the obvious\nreason that there has been no place \"outside\" of Western/\nEuropean civilization from which to raise questions about\nexistence in the twentieth century, it will nevertheless be\nfallacious to assume that the influence functions as the \"cause\"\ninstead of a consequence. (p. 3)\n4 SAGE Open\nAfricana philosophers already have a reason to raise existential\nquestions of liberation and questions of identity . . . by virtue of\nthe historical fact of racial oppression manifested most vividly\nin the European and Arabic slave trade and the European\ncolonization of the African continent and the entire world of\ncolor. (p. 3)\nrefers to, with Richard Wright, as \"undoubtedly the twentieth\ncentury's two most influential Africana existentialist `men of\nletters'\" (p. 9), throughout The Wretched of the Earth empha-\nsizes the need for the issues of identity and possibility to be\ntied to the social and political sphere. In a passage that is\nconsistent with Heidegger's view of the historicality of\nDasein, Fanon declares that \"When the colonized intellectual\nwriting for his people uses the past, he must do so with the\nintention of opening up the future, of spurring them into\naction and fostering hope\" (p. 167).\nTo continue my point about the correlation between post-\nmodern art and the social world, Linda Hutcheon (1988) has\nargued for just such a connection through, specifically, post-\nmodernism's use of parody, which\nparadoxically brings about a direct confrontation with the\nproblem of the relation of the aesthetic to a world of significance\nexternal to itself, to a discursive world of socially defined\nmeaning systems (past and present)--in other words, to the\npolitical and the historical. (p. 22)\nSimilarly, connecting African American literature to the past\nand so to history, Henry Louis Gates Jr. (1983), in his foun-\ndational article, \"`The Blackness of Blackness': The Critique\nof the Sign and the Signifying Monkey,\" defines the central\ntrope of African American literature as \"signifying,\" the\nrepeating, revising, parodying, and extending of previous\nworks: \" . . . black writers read and critique other black texts\nas an act of rhetorical self-definition. Our literary tradition\nexists because of these precisely chartable formal literary\nrelationships, relationships of signifying\" (p. 693). And,\nfinally, Teresa C. Zackodnik (2010), in The Mulatta and the\nPolitics of Race, builds on the work of Hazel Carby on the\nracialization of the 19th-century \"cult of true womanhood,\"\non theories of parody, and on Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s (1983)\ntheory of signifying as including performance as well as\n\"verbal and musical texts\" to posit a type of signifying that\nshe terms \"parodic performance\" (p. xxi). Through parodic\nperformance of \"racialized womanhood and whiteness,\" the\nmulatta figure in the texts she examines \"signify on power\nstructures African American women sought to redress\"\n(p. xxvii). By orienting her discussion around the \"redress-\ning\" of social ills, Zackodnik (2010) emphasizes the com-\nplexity of the issue of passing and the mulatta figure, its\nresistance to a simple duality of interpretation, and, from a\ndifferent theoretical direction, the significance of the past.\nFor, although a character has the freedom to choose to pass,\nto perform an identity, the experiences of the past have\nweight and, to the extent that those experiences have been\nimbued with the political and psychological effects of rac-\nism, cast their shadows across the future actions of the pass-\ning self.3 So, too, the viability--in Heideggerian terms, the\nauthenticity--of the identities of the protagonists in the nov-\nels that I discuss can be seen in relation to their ability to\nacknowledge and use their past experience to condition their\nrange of action, of possibilities, for the future.\nIn these early African American novels, that past experi-\nence is fraught with the horrors of slavery, Reconstruction,\nand post-Reconstruction in the United States. The impact of\nthese horrors on character is discussed by Stephen Knadler\n(2003) in \"Traumatized Racial Performativity: Passing in\nNineteenth-Century-African American Testimonies\" in\nterms of trauma theory and performance studies to arrive at\nwhat he terms \"traumatic performativity\" (p. 66) in African\nAmerican texts. Specifically, his purpose is \"to look at the\ncomplex and often fragmented process by which certain\nextensively rehearsed memories come to, and sometimes fail\nto, mediate a core narrative of the self . . . \" (p. 66). In the\nprocess, Knadler critiques both poststructuralist and African\nAmerican studies' views of passing and its meaning for per-\nsonal identity. The former, he says, focuses on race as a cul-\ntural construction based on behavior. The latter does not\ndeny the constitutive nature of race but promotes the value of\nmaintaining race pride, solidarity, and self-determination for\nthe achievement of social justice. Both views, according to\nKnadler, underplay or ignore the role of trauma on identity\nformation and maintenance. Knadler quotes trauma theorist\nCathy Caruth's definition of trauma as \"the response to an\nunexpected or overwhelming violent event or events that are\nnot fully grasped as they occur but return later in repeated\nflashbacks, nightmares, or other repetitive phenomena\"\n(p. 65, emphasis in original). In such circumstances, the self\nis unable to express the traumatic experience in traditional\ndiscourse, that is, the discourse of the dominant culture, and\nso is left with gaps in its ability to perform racial identity.\nBoth the poststructuralist and African American studies\nviews, Knadler argues, stress the passer's choice of racial\nidentity, which he ties to \"neoliberal capitalist democracy\nand late twentieth-century versions of multiculturalism\"\n(p. 68), and thus repress the passer's trauma.\nTo return to the Heideggerian concepts of state-of-mind\nand \"thrownness,\" or our \"facticity,\" this existential/phe-\nnomenological aspect of the facticity of human being is most\npronounced negatively in a racist context. For the laws gov-\nerning the institution of slavery define the slave as chattel, a\npiece of property, an object. And so, as Robert Birt (1997)\nhas observed, quoting Simone de Beauvoir, \"the black per-\nson is `reduced to pure facticity, concealed in his immanence,\ncut off from his future, deprived of his transcendence'\"\n(p. 207). Without the ability to make choices, being relegated\nto oppression and objectification, having no real position as\na subject, racist oppression, Birt (1997) claims, \"robs people\nof their identity . . . [and] imposes rigid, stultifying identities\non its victims\" (p. 206). Furthermore, \"all oppression begets\nalienation [and] . . . according to Angela Davis, alienation `is\nthe absence of authentic identity'\" (p. 207).\nGoing even further in the direction of victimhood and its\neffects, Knadler's (2003) approach supports the role that I\nclaim phenomenological facticity plays in not only the for-\nmation and the performance of identity but also on the self's\nfuture horizon of possibilities. For no aspect of experience of\nthe character, including the traumatic events and the\nresponses that they produce in the character, can be excluded\nfrom, or elided across, the impact that they have on a charac-\nter's identity and on the horizon of possibilities for that char-\nPossibility . . . does not signify a free-floating potentiality-for-\nbeing . . . In every case Dasein . . . has already got itself into\ndefinite possibilities . . . Dasein is being possible which has been\ndelivered over to itself--thrown possibility through and through.\n(p. 183, emphasis in original)\nFor the characters in these African American novels who\nare born with certain racial attributes and in a condition of\nslavery, those facts are part of their \"thrownness\" into the\nworld.\nSuch thrownness is the major focus in what is generally\nacknowledged as the first novel by an African American,\nClotel: or, The President's Daughter: A Narrative of Slave\nLife in the United States, written by William Wells Brown\nand published in London in 1853. For the main characters,\nCurrer, Thomas Jefferson's former hired slave and mistress,\nand her two daughters with Jefferson, Clotel and Althesa, the\nchoice to pass for White involves their survival because\nracial passing offers a means of escape from slavery. Brown's\nliterary style of mixing fictional and non-fictional elements\nhas been widely discussed, often to his detriment as a novel-\nist. However, Eve Allegra Raimon (2004) sees this style as\npurposeful. She also links it to a style that we have come to\nthink of as postmodern:\nThe title character's story is constantly interrupted by a complex\nassortment of seemingly disparate textual elements--a pastiche\nof short stories, anecdotes, biographical notes, histories,\ntranscriptions of newspaper clippings, billboard announcements,\nand other such artifacts woven loosely together in a collection\none might fairly term protopostmodern. (p. 68)\nRaimon (2004) goes on to claim that \"the blurring of the\nboundaries of fictivity that is so insistent in Clotel joins with\nthe project of blurring the boundaries of race and nation,\nrevealed as their own brand of fiction\" (p. 70). This \"blur-\nring\" coincides with Brown's \"double-edged narrative strat-\negy\" (p. 71) toward the largely White readership, dramatized\nin the novel's first scene of the auctioning of female slaves,\nof appealing both to the reader's sympathy for the victims of\nslavery's \"sexual exploitation\" (p. 70) and to the reader's\n\"anxieties about `amalgamation'\" (p. 71). The results are\nalso that this approach \"introduce[s] the reader to the notion\nof the instability of racial identities\" and \"place[s] the origin\nof such racial instability where it belongs, not with the advent\nof widespread antislavery agitation in the 1830's but with the\nvery founding of the Republic, and before\" (p. 71). This\nracial instability can be tied, in Phillip Brian Harper's (1994)\nterm, to the social marginality of African Americans in ante-\nbellum America, certainly, but the even more interesting\naspect of Raimon's point--and of Brown's approach--is that\nthis racial instability is applicable, at least theoretically\nthrough miscegenation and the uncertainty of \"pure\" racial\nbloodlines that necessarily proceeds from it, to the entire\nsociety, thus sowing the seeds of both greater fragmentation\nof racial identity and greater possibility of choice of such\nidentity for future generations of Americans.\nAlthesa and Clotel pass for the wives of White men,\nthough Clotel's marital arrangement is sub rosa from the\nstart. In fact, the novel has come under some criticism for\nwhat is seen as an overemphasis on the roles of passing and\nof Whiteness. Ann duCille (2000) discusses this criticism in\ngeneral and the point of view of critic Addison Gayle in\nparticular:\nGayle asserts that Brown was incapable of portraying anything\nother than stereotypical images and secondhand ideas. He\nsimply rebutted popular depictions of blacks as brainless,\nchildlike Uncle Toms or lawless \"brute Negroes\" with\ncounterimages of beautiful quadroons--romantic images that\nappealed to whites and to the black middle class . . . (p. 453)\nHowever, duCille (2000) argues that Brown and other\n19th-century African American writers chose\na strategy of the times, [an] attempt to argue for equality by\nestablishing resemblance, by collapsing difference into\nsameness, by pointing out the mutability of race and the\nabsurdity of white society's color codes through the trope of the\nmulatto, tragic and heroic [and that contemporary readers may\nbe guilty of applying a kind of] prescriptive, anachronistic\ncriticism [to these writers]. (p. 454)\nTo be sure, Clotel and her daughter Mary are tragic fig-\nures. Their facticity while passing carries the weight of the\nsecret of their mixed ancestry, and so because of their soci-\nety's racial essentialism they suffer a kind of fragmentation\nof the self. However, as duCille (2000) contends, they are\nalso heroic figures. In Heideggerian terms, this heroism can\nbe linked to the concept of authenticity. The Self, Heidegger\n(1962) says, \"is . . . for the most part inauthentic, the they-\nself\" (p. 225). The \"they-self\" is an aspect of the existential\nof fallenness, which Heidegger (1962) defines as \"an absorp-\ntion of Being-with-one-another,\" or \"Being-lost in the pub-\nlicness of the `they'\" (p. 220). In and of itself, fallenness into\nthe world is not a negative quality; it is simply one mode of\n6 SAGE Open\nbeing. But to the degree that it becomes, in Heidegger's\nturn away from its own selfhood, fallenness is a potential\nproblem for personal identity. Clotel and Mary face the\ntemptation of fallenness in two senses: First, they could sim-\nply go along with the \"they-self\" of their social circumstance\nof slavery; second, while passing, they could go along with\nthe \"they-self\" of White society and forget about their past,\nas Clotel could forget about Mary after escaping to the north.\nFallenness is in its basic aspect what Heidegger (1962) terms\n\"inauthentic.\" Inauthenticity also is not a categorically nega-\ntive quality, but rather simply a part of Being in the world.\nHeidegger (1962) contrasts the inauthentic Self to \"the\nauthentic Self--that is, . . . the Self which has been taken hold\nof in its own way\" (p. 167, emphasis in original). One comes\nto authenticity through the existential of understanding, which\nHeidegger (1962) defines as \"the phenomenological basis for\nseeing [possibility] as a disclosive potentiality-for-Being\" (p.\n183). Through their experiences, Clotel and Mary come to the\nexistential of understanding and choose to live authentically\nby \"taking hold\" of their own heritage and the horizon of pos-\nsibilities stemming from it even when, as in Clotel's case,\ndoing so may result in death.\nIn February 2001, Henry Louis Gates Jr. purchased a\nholograph manuscript from the Swann Galleries in New\nYorkCityduringitsyearlyauctionof\"PrintedandManuscript\nAfrican Americana\" (Gates, 2002, p. xxi). The title of the\nmanuscript was \"The Bondwoman's Narrative by Hannah\nCrafts, a Fugitive Slave, Recently Escaped from North\nCarolina,\" and the date of origin was put at \"circa 1850's\"\n(Gates, 2002, p. xxiv). Based on his evaluation and research\ninto its authorship and date, Henry Louis Gates published the\nmanuscript in 2002 as The Bondwoman's Narrative, A Novel,\nby Hannah Crafts. In his introduction to this first edition of\nthe novel, Gates (2002) states his view that \"this fictional-\nized slave narrative . . . [is] possibly the first novel written by\na black woman and definitely the first novel written by a\nwoman who had been a slave\" (p. xxv). As the auction cata-\nlog description says, \"the narrative is not only that of the\nmulatto Hannah, but also of her mistress who turns out to be\na light-skinned woman passing for white\" (Gates, 2002, p.\nxxiii). In fact, Hannah's mistress, Mrs. Vincent, has not actu-\nally made a deliberate choice to pass. She has led a life of\nsouthern White privilege unaware that she has been \"pass-\ning\" since birth, for she was exchanged for the stillborn child\nof the mistress and raised as the Master's daughter. The later\ndiscovery of her origin shocks Mrs. Vincent to the point of\nfragmenting her sense of self--she \"was\" one person and\nthen she \"is\" a totally different person in the eyes of the law\nand society. Along with shock, Mrs. Vincent feels shame and\nregards the fact of the infant exchange as \"the secret of my\n(Crafts, 2002, p. 49). Although pejorative, her reaction to her\ntrue background has the objective rationale that the legal\nstatus of a child in the slave states followed that of the\nmother, and so, if her background is revealed, Mrs. Vincent\ncould be sold at any moment. With this threat hanging over\nher, she quickly agrees to Hannah's advice to run away. In\nmaking this decision, Mrs. Vincent changes identity again,\nfor she goes back to passing as White as a means of escape.\nThus, for Mrs. Vincent, \"passing\" carries the burden of her\nstruggle to hide a literal secret.\nIn these terms, Mrs. Vincent experiences what would seem\nto be impossible--a change in her thrownness, the material\nfacts of her being--by her color and race changing instanta-\nneously. Of course, what this change actually dramatizes is\nnot a change in her thrownness but rather the arbitrariness of\nthe social perception of her thrownness, that is, the absurdity\nof the \"one drop rule\" that defines a person who has any\nAfrican heritage whatsoever as a Negro and thus as a slave.\nAs with Clotel, Hannah faces the temptation of falling\ninto the they-self of the stereotype of the obedient slave. In\nparticular, in dealing with Whites, Hannah must suppress her\nown mental acuity. As Adebayo Williams (2003) points out,\nHannah's \"sharp wit, intellectual elevation, and sense of dan-\nger . . . are contrasted unfavorably with the dim-witted clum-\nsiness and obtuse procrastinations of her mistresses and other\nsocially superior ladies\" (p. 144). Hannah's knowledge of a\nmistress's embarrassing encounter with social fashion in the\nform of face powder that turns her face, ironically, black\nleads to Hannah being falsely accused by a jealous fellow\nslave of revealing the episode and to Hannah being sent to be\nthe wife of a field hand whom she hardly knows.4 Hannah\ndecides to escape a second time, not, as with Mrs. Vincent, to\nhelp her desperate mistress, but for her own sake.\nHannah's successful escape from this forced marriage is\naccomplished by her ability to pass first as a White boy and\nthen as a White girl. Like Mrs. Vincent, Hannah has frag-\nmented her identity between races, but going farther than\nMrs. Vincent, Hannah crosses the gender line as well as the\ncolor line. The ability to pass, then, although indicative of the\ndegree to which identity may be seen as socially constructed,\ncan in the context of the struggle to survive the horrors of\nslavery be seen as a valuable tool that can fool anyone, Black\nor White, male or female. However, when Hannah reaches\nfreedom in New Jersey, she chooses a life that is not racially\nambiguous in any way, that is, she makes a clear choice of\none side of the color line. She marries a Black minister who\ninto a community of African Americans, and \"keep[s] a\nchoice, this Heideggerian projection of her own possibilities,\nHannah heals the postmodern-like fragmentation that has\ncharacterized her sense of self to this time by firmly acknowl-\nedging and accepting her African American heritage.\nHannah, as Phillip Brian Harper (1994) says of the protago-\nnist of Invisible Man, comes to understand \"the importance\nof [her] identification with the black community if [s]he is to\nachieve individual identity\" (p. 135).\nPublished in London in 1857, Frank J. Webb's The Garies\nand Their Friends has been traditionally acknowledged to\nbe, after Brown's Clotel, the second novel published by an\nAfrican American. Although written in the same decade as\nClotel and The Bondwoman's Narrative, The Garies and\nTheir Friends offers a strikingly different view of African\nAmerican society, yet raises similar issues about identity.\nThe setting is not the cotton plantation south but the mercan-\ntile north, specifically, Philadelphia, which by the 1830s had\na significant and thriving free African American population.\nThe main conflict of the novel is based on the tensions\nbetween White, particularly Irish, immigrants and African\nAmericans over jobs and social status that resulted finally in\nGaries are an interracial couple; he, a wealthy Georgian\nplanter, and she, a beautiful, lighter skinnedAfricanAmerican\nand fell in love with. Although legally unable to marry in\nGeorgia, the couple live as a family with their two children,\nClarence and Emily, both of whom \"showed no trace what-\n53) to her husband, she and the children \"might be sold and\nconvinces her husband to move the family to Philadelphia.\nThe move to the north, however, as slave narratives such\nrelief from bigotry and discriminatory civil practices. These\npractices, though, are mild precursors to the horror of the\nrace riot that results in the deaths of Mr. and Mrs. Garie. How\nthe two children grow up from this point, how their identities\nform, makes the central point about passing in the novel. For\nthe two--both capable of passing for White--take distinctly\ndifferent paths. Emily, as a female, is allowed to remain in\nthe African American community and grows to be a happy\nand well-adjusted adult. Clarence, however, is sent to an all-\nWhite boys' school far away and so put on a track for life as\npassing for White. The children's guardian, the African\nAmerican entrepreneur Mr. Walters, agrees to the plan pro-\nposed by Balch, the Garies' White lawyer, but suspects trou-\nble may result from his decision in the long run; for Clarence,\nWalters worries, \"must live in constant fear of exposure; this\ndread will embitter every enjoyment, and make him the most\nWalters uses, \"dread,\" is particularly appropriate to my dis-\ncussion of the issue of identity, for dread is the term that\nHeidegger uses to describe that state of mind that makes us\n\"aware of what is . . . We are thrown in a world. Dread brings\nemphasis in original). In Clarence's case, this dread is the\nawareness of his mixed racial background and how that is\nperceived in the world of antebellum America, even in the\nnorth. For Heidegger (1962), dread can be a catalyst for an\nindividual to confront his ability to make choices, that is, to\nbe authentic. For Clarence, though, the matter of whether he\nmakes an authentic choice to pass for White is muddled, for,\nas Guilia Fabi (2001) observes, \"Clarence's passing is an\nexternally imposed lifelong necessity that emerges as one\nmore form of racial oppression . . . young Clarence falls vic-\ntim to the white family lawyer's conviction that as a white\nperson he `will be better off'\" (p. 39).\nGiven this problematic nature of Clarence's choice to\npass, his further development as White can also be seen as\nquestionably authentic. More probably, as the evidence indi-\ncates, his is another example of pre-postmodern fragmented\nidentity. At the beginning of the novel, Clarence is simply\nhimself, a child with a beautiful mother with a \"light-brown\nof racial identity. After the riot, though, Clarence becomes\nracially divided, as Balch tells him, \"we are going to send\nyou where it is not known that you are coloured; and you\nemphasis in original). As a result of this socially enforced\nracial essentialism, that is, the expectation that a person must\nbe either Black or White, Clarence must necessarily disas-\nsociate from his former life and so from a central part of\nhimself. For example, he begins to think of African\nAmericans, including his sister, as the Other: \" . . . I can't go\n[to see her] with any comfort or pleasure . . . each year as I\nvisit the place, their ways seem more strange and irksome to\nschizophrenia, even as he denies its possibility: \" . . . I can't\nbe white and colored at the same time; the two don't mingle,\nand I must consequently be one or the other\" (Webb,\nAnglo and African, but society demands that he can be only\none, and if it knew of the African part, would classify, essen-\ntialize, him as Black. Clarence expresses his sense of frag-\nmentation in Heideggerian terms: \"My education, habits, and\nideas, all unfit me for associating with [African Americans];\nand I live in constant dread that something may occur to\nemphasis added). This \"bringing out\" does indeed finally\ntranspire and ruin Clarence's plans to marry the (White)\nwoman he loves, and he lives out the brief remainder of his\nlife \"very wretched and lonely . . . apart from both [white and\nIola Leroy, or Shadows Uplifted, published in 1892 by\nFrances E. W. Harper, begins during the Civil War and ends\nduring Reconstruction and so can be seen as a \"transition\nfrom the antebellum period to the Harlem Renaissance\"\n(Foster, 1988, p. xxxvii). Iola Leroy shares the circumstance\nwith Mrs. Vincent of The Bondwoman's Narrative of having\nher sense of self reversed overnight. Born to a wealthy\nLouisiana planter, Eugene Leroy, and Marie, his light-\nskinned former slave, whom he sent north to be educated and\nthen married, Iola has never been told of her mixed heritage\nand so is \"perfectly ignorant of [her] racial connection\"\n8 SAGE Open\nslavery to her abolitionist schoolmates at an exclusive girls'\nschool in the north:\nSlavery can't be wrong . . . for my father is a slave-holder, and\nmy mother is as good to our servants as she can be . . . I don't\nthink these Abolitionists have any right to meddle in our affairs.\nThe next minute, she is tricked into leaving the school by a\nlawyer sent by her father's cousin and heir after Leroy's\ndeath by yellow fever, returned to Louisiana, and sold as a\nslave. The shock of this change causes Iola \"intense horror\nyoung woman, she is purchased \"to keep house,\" a euphe-\nmism for sexual services, but because, in the words of her\nslave friend, Tom Anderson, \"she's a reg'lar spitfire\" in\nresisting such service, she has been sold \"all ober de kentry\"\nIola, then, is marginalized by race--from White to Black;\nby social status--from privileged aristocrat to slave; and by\nsexual status--from respected lady to purchased concubine.\nBy any standard of expectation, she should suffer a break-\ndown of her sense of self. The world as she knew it has col-\nlapsed; everything she believed to be true is false. Her world,\nthat is, has become strikingly chaotic and absurd, or post-\nmodern. Yet Iola's identity, finally, does not remain frag-\nmented. Teresa Zackodnik (2010) states that Iola is \"forced\nto become self-reliant and independent as a result of [her]\nexperiences\" (p. 110). Certainly, Iola does become self-reli-\nant and independent. She even maintains her sense of pride\nin the most humiliating circumstances and is able to ascribe\nshame to the perpetrators rather than the victims of abuse:\nI have heard men talk glibly of the degradation of the negro\n[sic], but there is a vast difference between abasement of\ncondition and degradation of character. I was abased, but the\nmen who trampled on me were the degraded ones. (Harper,\nHowever, it cannot be, tautologically, that Iola responds\nresiliently because there are forces that militate against her.\nRather, Iola is able, though marginalized in several social\ncategories, though having had her sense of self shattered, to\nreconstitute her fragmented identity. The means by which\nshe does so can be understood through Heidegger's concept\nof history and historicality. History, in Heidegger's view, \"is\nabout the worlds of those Daseins whose stretching-along\nbetween their respective births and deaths constitutes a sig-\noriginal). Historicality, for Heidegger, is the existential\nawareness through which one understands being in history.\nThere are three grounds to historicality: heritage--or \"one's\ntradition as significantly determining . . . the makeup of the\n`world' that one is `in' as Being-in-a world\" (p. 212), a part\nof thrownness; fate--\"one's awareness of one's finitude . . .\n[and] one's limited possibilities and the ensuing significance\nof one's choices and decisions\" (p. 212, emphasis in origi-\nnal); and destiny--\"a kind of fate on the level of a whole\npeople . . . grounded in Dasein's Being-with of others\" (p.\n213). Iola responds to her changed circumstances by seeing\nherself anew as a historical being. Whereas she was a typical\nsouthern belle who believed in the southern ideal of the south\nas an Anglo Saxon Camelot, a world out of space and time,\nher sudden change in material circumstance jolts her back\ninto history by making her aware of her own finitude.\nMoreover, she becomes aware of destiny and heritage through\nidentification of herself--imposed at first but then accepted\nand avowed by her by choice--as African American.\nSpecifically, when the Civil War ends and the hospital at\nwhich Iola serves as a nurse closes, Dr. Gresham suggests that\nshe, like many other White women, open a school for African\nAmerican children. Up to this point, Iola has been a slave and\nin that sense has identified withAfricanAmericans. However,\nafter the war, she can choose to be White orAfricanAmerican.\nHer greatest temptation to choose to be White comes in the\nform of a marriage proposal from Dr. Gresham, who as \"a\nmember of a wealthy and aristocratic family, proud of its lin-\neage, which it could trace through generations of good blood\nthat same Anglo Saxon ideal that grew beyond the south\nthroughout the 19th century along with American militarism.\nAs Raimon (2004) explains, \"The growing confidence in\nwhite racial superiority blended with a parallel sense of provi-\ndentially sanctioned nationalist destiny\" (p. 28).7\nAlthough Gresham is attracted to Iola, and proposes to her\neven after learning of her origin, he nonetheless sees that ori-\ngin as shameful: \"he resolved to win her for his bride, bury\nher secret in his Northern home, and hide from his aristocratic\nrelations all knowledge of her mournful past\" (Harper,\nAfrican Americans as less than equal to Anglo Saxons. For\nexample, in attempting to persuade Iola of his genuine affec-\ntion for her, the two become entwined in a discussion of the\naftermath of slavery, and Dr. Gresham expresses the same\nview that African Americans must pull themselves up by their\nown bootstraps, must, that is, earn the equality that is granted\nthem, like every other citizen, by law, that, a few years after\nthe publication of Iola Leroy, BookerT.Washington expressed\nin hisAtlanta ExpositionAddress: Specifically, Gresham says\nthat African Americans \"must learn to struggle, labor, and\nthe model for African Americans to emulate:\nThe Anglo-Saxon race is proud, domineering, aggressive, and\nimpatient of a rival . . . They have been a conquering and\nachieving people, marvelous in their triumphs of mind over\nmatter. They have manifested the traits of character which are\nThus, Gresham wants (a) to separate Iola artificially from her\nown, again, in Heidegger's term, thrownness--he tells her, \"I\nlove you for your own sake.And with this the disadvantages of\ndeny, and to have her deny, her heritage and the destiny that\nshe could share with African Americans; and (c) to bestow\nupon her, noblese oblige, his own thrownness, his Anglo\nSaxon heritage and destiny. For example, in response to her\ncontinuing the discussion of the lot of African Americans,\nGresham, \"a little impatiently,\" protests, \"But, Iola . . . what\nhas all this to do with our marriage? Your complexion is as\nfair as mine. What is to hinder you from sharing my Northern\nhome, from having my mother to be your mother?\" (Harper,\nhard genetic facts that might disrupt his Anglo Saxon para-\ndise and that a medical man might have been expected to\nanticipate, a point she ironically emphasizes by addressing\nhim by just his title: \"Doctor . . . suppose we should marry,\nand little children in after years should nestle in our arms,\nand one of them show unmistakable signs of color, would\nyou be satisfied?\" His reaction--\"His face flushed as if the\n117)--reveals his most fundamental feelings toward African\nAmericans and provides Iola with the motivation to resist the\nvery significant temptation to renounce her heritage by\naccepting his proposal of marriage.\nIn rejecting Gresham, Iola takes a major step to her own\nauthentic choice of identity. In choosing to follow that path\nof destiny that accords to the African American people, Iola\nacknowledges in the most substantive manner possible that,\nin the United States, race matters. As Barbara Christian\n(1980) discusses, Iola represents a different kind of mulatta,\none \"no longer tragic or melancholy but a source of light for\nthose below and around her\" (p. 29). It is because Iola\nchooses to identify with her African heritage that she does\nnot see herself as having to hide a secret of identity or to feel\na shame of origin. And, it is because she chooses to project\nher destiny with that of African Americans that she sees her\nfuture as having meaning and possibility.\nThe characters' motivation for passing changes with the\nhistorical circumstances in Charles Chesnutt's The House\nBehind the Cedars, published in 1900. In North and South\nCarolina \"a few years after the Civil War\" (Chesnutt,\nfrom slavery. For John Warwick/John Walden, passing is\ninstead a means to prosperity and higher social status. He\nthinks of his origin and heritage as an African American as\nand rails momentarily \"against the fate which made it neces-\nsary that he should visit the home of his childhood, if at all,\nlike a thief in the night,\" but he is able to assign such\nfor he has chosen to be one of those \"men who have elected\nto govern their lives by principles of abstract right and rea-\nson\" and to \"be careful about descending from the lofty\nheights of logic to the common level of impulse and affec-\nWarwick's view of race is legalistic. As John Sheehy (1999)\nasserts, Warwick's \"is the mind of a lawyer . . . Warwick/\nWalden is white, by appearance, by blood, and, more impor-\ntantly, by law\" (p. 409, emphasis in original). As Judge\nStraight advises John Walden when he comes to him as a boy\nannouncing that he wants to be a lawyer, John might one day\ngo to South Carolina, where the law allows that a person of\nmixed blood might be considered White not only if \"the\nadmixture of African blood did not exceed one-eighth\" but\nalso \"by reputation, by reception, and by their exercises of\np. 118). John Warwick, then, solves his own sense of margin-\nalization, heals the fragmentation of his identity, by simply\nignoring a part of his facticity in a socially acceptable way,\nthat is, by legal definition, and creates a wholly new identity.\nThere is some residue of his prior self left over in the emo-\ntion he feels in missing his mother, but he seems willing to\naccept the weight of that residue in exchange for his new\nidentity.\nIn Heideggerian terms, an initial inclination might be to\nconclude that Warwick lives authentically because he\nchooses, from among all of the genuine elements of his per-\nsonal background, his facticity, that is, from among the\nWhite and the Black aspects, to live his life as a White man.\nHowever, there are several reasons why this view is prob-\nlematic. First, in his approach to living his life, Warwick is\nstill living with a lie and a secret, and so is not authentically\nfacing his facticity. Second, Warwick's need to pass for\nWhite requires him to accept uncritically the values of that\nWhite, particularly idealized Anglo Saxon society--for\nexample, the Tournament scene contrasts Warwick playing\nthe knight and honest Frank Fowler watching the pretentious\nevent from the sidelines--and so requires him to act inau-\nthentically. Third, Heidegger's conception of freedom, like\nhis conception of possibility, is not absolutely free.As Joseph\nHeidegger does not describe freedom as a present power of\nautonomous or arbitrary choice . . . [Freedom] means the\nimpossibility of any essential amelioration or progressive\ntransformation of the human condition and situation, for it is a\nbeing-free for a future that is in all essentials the recurrence of\nwhat has already been, and one of these essentials is the thrown\nand factical necessity of having to take over a particular past that\none can never make over from the ground up ex nihilo because\nit is itself part of the ground. (pp. 62-63)\nWhat this means in terms of Warwick's authenticity in\nfine and the authenticity of mixed-race characters in general\nis that one is always already what one is factically and that\nfacticity has meaning in the projection of possibilities into\nthe future. A character who denies or ignores the whole of\nwhat he or she is limits or perverts the range of possible\nchoices for the future, and so is living inauthentically.\nNot only does Warwick live inauthentically but also he\nsucceeds in leading his younger sister into this condition of\ninauthenticity by prying her from her life with their mother\nin Patesville, North Carolina, to his estate in Clarence, South\nCarolina, and changing her name from Rena Walden to the\nromantic, Ivanhoe-inspired Rowena Warwick. However,\nalthough Warwick's regret over repudiating his mother and\nhis heritage is minimal, Rena/Rowena falls into the senti-\nmental trope of the tragic mulatta because she suffers from a\ncombination of the kind of shame that Mrs. Vincent in The\nBondwoman's Narrative felt about her secret past and a nos-\ntalgia for her family life with her mother and her heritage. For\nexample, when considering a marriage proposal from the\nWhite, aristocratic George Tryon, Rena hesitates \"due to a\nsimple and yet complex cause . . . It was the consciousness of\nher secret . . . Rena's secret was the worm in the bud, the\nAnd, because the people she has heretofore identified with\nand her heritage are socially marginalized by the dominant\nculture and defined as inferior, in passing Rena is acquiescing\nto the they-self of that dominant culture and their view rather\nthan acknowledging the facts of her background and her heri-\ntage, and so, like her brother, living inauthentically. As\nSheehy (1999) says, \"Rena ultimately assents to assuming an\n`owned' identity, historically predetermined and founded on\nEuropean notions of race . . . this `received'identity masquer-\nades for Rena as an image of her `essential' self\" (p. 412).\nWhen Tryon learns of Rena's background and drops her,\nshe returns to a life as an African American schoolteacher\nand seems to accept that identity. When George Tryon's\nmother visits the school coincidentally without knowing of\nRena's former relationship with George and asks Rena\nwhether she is \"really colored,\" the narrator tells us, \"A year\nand a half earlier, Rena would have met the question by some\ndisplay of self-consciousness. Now, she replied simply and\np. 167). Yet, she still accepts an essentialist, socially defined\nversion of her identity, one that categorizes, limits, and\nembarrasses her. For instance, when Tryon sends her a letter\nasking to meet after learning of her proximity, Rena, in her\nletter of response, writes,\nYou are white, and you have given me to understand that I am\nblack. I accept the classification, however unfair, and the\nconsequences, however unjust . . . As a white man, this might\nnot mean a great deal to you; as a woman, shut out already by\nmy color from much that is desirable, my good name remains\nClearly, Rena is still pining for her former \"passing\" life with\nGeorge, and the loss of it has caused her pain. She has\nbecome the sentimental tragic mulatta, coping with a sense\nof original shame, and in that role she dies a horrible and\nseemingly unnecessary death from \"brain fever\" induced by\nher getting lost in a swamp during a storm as she runs from\nboth Tryon and would-beAfricanAmerican suitor, Jeff Wain.\nAlthough Wain is not the gentleman he pretends to be, he\ndoes represent a Black alternative to the White Tryon.\nMoreover, the male character in the novel who is unarguably\nthe finest person and who has loved Rena since childhood,\nFrank Fowler, is someone who she does not even see as a\npossible mate. Thus, in a sense, Rena rejects both White and\nBlack males, showing the confusion and sorrow over her\nown racial identity as the tragic mulatta figure of the 19th-\ncentury sentimental novel.\nthe author's name, The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured\nMan, by James Weldon Johnson, problematizes issues of\nauthentic destiny and of identity more than any previous\nnovel of racial passing. In fact, I would argue that with The\nAutobiography, the sentimental and realistic elements of the\nAfrican American novel coalesce with the novel of the domi-\nnant culture into the psychologism of the Modernist period.\nCertainly, the mind of the narrator is as much the ground of\nthe action of the novel as is its physical and cultural geogra-\nphy as we watch his struggle to acclimate to, and his alien-\nation from, whichever society, for example, superficially\nintegrated Connecticut, African American New York, White\nEurope, the African American South, or White New York, he\nlives in at the time. But, even more interestingly, we can see\nthe roots of a postmodern division of identity in the narra-\ntor's sense of himself. This fragmentation can be seen in all\nthe African American texts I have discussed but is enunci-\nated most memorably in The Souls of Black Folk with W. E.\nthis sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of\nothers . . . One ever feels his two-ness,--an American, a Negro;\ntwo souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring\nideals in one dark body . . . (p. 3)\nIn The Autobiography, the narrator alludes to \"that remark-\nable book by Dr. DuBois, The Souls of Black Folks\" (Johnson,\ning the full range of African American life beyond stereo-\ntype, but, more to the point, mentions also his own \"transition\nfrom White to Black, and so to double-consciousness, or\nwhat he terms \"a sort of dual personality,\" of being \"forced\nto take his outlook on all things, not from the view-point . . .\nof a man . . . but from the view-point of a coloured man\"\nFurthermore, what Phillip Brian Harper (1994) concludes\nabout Maxine Hong Kingston's autobiographical narrative,\nThe Woman Warrior, may be said of The Autobiography,\nnamely, that it represents\na postmodernistic human subject whose existence is highly\nunstable and contingent upon the various narrative motifs that at\nany moment are deployed to ground [his] personality; that\nrepresentation derives . . . specifically from the narrative\ntreatment of social difference and marginality. (p. 28)\nIn The Autobiography, those narrative motifs take the\nform of test-case identities that the narrator tries on through-\nout the novel, unwilling to make, in Heidegger's term, an\nauthentic choice of identity. His indecisive attitude can be\nseen in the fact that, unlike other characters in the passing\ntradition, the ex-colored man sees his situation as more comic\nthan serious. At the beginning, he refers to his passing as \"a\nthe end of the novel as \"the capital joke I was playing\"\nseems to indicate that passing has changed from a matter of\nnecessity--either for literal survival or for social or economic\ngain--to a matter of arbitrary preference. Specifically, the ex-\ncolored man could choose at various times to be Black, White,\nor Italian by virtue of his olive complexion, or French,\nGerman, or Spanish by virtue of language and cultural flu-\nency, and could slip into any of these identities for no greater\nreason that his own satisfaction, as when he takes \"pride that\n[he] spoke better Spanish than many of the Cuban workmen\nTo be sure, throughout his life, the narrator identifies\nmore with Whites than with Blacks. For instance, when at\nschool a Black student throws a slate at a White student, the\nnarrator joins the crowd of White students who retaliate: \"We\nran after them pelting them with stones . . . \" (Johnson,\neasier to praise Whites than Blacks. For example, in a discus-\nsion of the reaction of White southerners to the possible\nadvancement of the former slave class, the narrator says, \"I\ncould not but appreciate the logic of the position held by\nthose Southern leaders who have been bold enough to pro-\nclaim against the education of the Negro\" (Johnson,\nexperiences traveling through the south, he adopts an anthro-\npological tone that smacks of smug White superiority. As\nThe anonymous narrator . . . in aiming for a \"detached\" or\n\"objective\" stance on the race question--the position the social\nscientist conventionally pretends to--not only distances himself\nfrom the black America he depicts, but frequently chooses to\nadopt the gaze of white society. (p. 20)\nFor example, the narrator delineates elements of \"Negro dia-\nlect\"--such as \"Lawd a mussy!\" and \"Look heah, chile!\"--\nand condescendingly praises the \"droll humour\" and \"ability\nto laugh heartily\" that \"does much to keep [the Negro] from\nFurthermore, like an anthropologist, the ex-colored man cat-\negorizes those he observes. He outlines three classes ofAfrican\nAmericans, all of them dominated by the \"white gaze,\" for, as\nthe narrator acknowledges, they are \"not so much in respect\nto themselves as in respect to their relations with the whites\"\nmen who work in lumber and turpentine camps, the\nex-convicts, the bar-room loafers\" who hate and avoid\nWhites; second, the \"domestic service\" class, comprised of\n\"the servants, the washerwomen, the waiters, the cooks, the\ncoachmen\" who are closely connected to Whites; and third,\nthe \"well-to-do and educated class,\" including \"indepen-\ndent workmen and tradesmen\" who \"live in a little world\nIn his description of these categories, the narrator betrays\nwhat may seem to be an authentic identity, that of a social\nand economic elitist. For instance, on his first trip to Atlanta,\nhe reacts to what he sees as \"the unkempt appearance, the\nshambling, slouching gait and loud talk\" of the large African\nAmericans population with \"a feeling of almost repulsion\"\nand is relieved when told that these people \"were of the\nthe narrator privileges class distinction over race distinction.\nFor example, he says that \"refined coloured people get no\nmore pleasure out of riding [in segregated train cars] with\noffensive Negroes than anybody else would get\" (Johnson,\nhim that class means more than race: \"When one has seen\nsomething of the world and human nature, one must con-\nclude, after all, that between people in like stations of life\nthere is very little difference the world over\" (Johnson,\nHowever, ultimately, in neither his classist nor White\nexperience traveling around Europe with his \"patron\" is the\nnarrator making a wholly authentic choice of identity. It can\nbe argued that although the narrator learns about different\ncultures and languages, he is, like the patron, essentially sim-\nply living in fallenness. Heidegger outlines three characteris-\ntics of the existential of fallenness: \"idle talk, ambiguity, and\nexhibits all three. Although the patron is somewhat distant\nand restrained, he is among the White \"slummers\" (Johnson,\nhe throws extravagant dinner parties at his apartment so that\nhe is constantly surrounded by \"idle,\" or inconsequential,\n\"talk.\" He lives in ambiguity in the Heideggerian sense that\nhe refuses to make clear plans or decisions, as seen in his\nresponse when the narrator asks him how long he proposes to\np. 130). And last, the patron displays the curiosity that dis-\ntracts one from one's own life through voyeurism--\"He\nseemed to take cynical delight in watching and studying oth-\nin decadence--his crowd \"were people . . . who were ever\nexpecting to find happiness in novelty, each day restlessly\nexploring and exhausting every resource of [New York] that\nmight possibly furnish a new sensation or awaken a fresh\nthen, that the narrator shares the patron's way of life while he\nis with him and admires him--as he does: \"I looked upon\nhim . . . as about all a man could wish to be\" (Johnson,\ntalk, ambiguity, and curiosity that constitute fallenness.\nThe narrator appears to break through this state of fallen-\nness when he has what seems to be an epiphany, after a\nGerman musician at one of the patron's parties transposes the\nnarrator's ragtime number into classical form, that he can do\nthe same in a more comprehensive manner, thereby becom-\ndreamed of as a boy. He decides to return to the south to\np. 143). However, he never succeeds in this breakthrough to\nauthentic selfhood for several reasons. First, when he goes to\nthe south, he still maintains the \"white gaze\" that he had dur-\ning his first trip; if anything, it has become even narrower\nbecause of his time passing as a White American in Europe\nand his acculturation into White European society. For\nexample, in conversing with a young male schoolteacher that\nhe meets while studying African American spirituals at the\nnarrator notes that he and \"the majority of intelligent coloured\npeople are . . . too much in earnest over the race question . . .\nare unable to see things in their proper proportions . . . \" and\nshould \"exercise [a] sense of humour\" about \"their present\nhe explicitly censures White musicians who make money\nfrom popularizing as their own the music of Black ragtime\nmusicians, his venture to re-work the old slave songs for his\nown glory and profit, represents, as Goellnicht (1996) notes,\n\"the very thievery he had been critical of white musicians\nfor\" (p. 27). Third, he has a fundamental lack of respect for\nthe very music and culture, and therefore for a part of his\nown heritage, that he plans to appropriate for his benefit.
