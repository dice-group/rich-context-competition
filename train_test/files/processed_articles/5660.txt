However, subsequent findings suggest that\nthe evidence for nonoriented mechanisms has been misinterpreted: those experiments might have\nrevealed the characteristics of suppression (eg, gain control), not excitation, or merely the isotropic\nsubunits of the oriented detecting mechanisms. To shed light on this, we used all three paradigms\nto focus on the `high-speed' corner of spatio-temporal vision (low spatial frequency, high temporal\nfrequency), where cross-oriented achromatic effects are greatest. We used flickering Gabor patches\nas targets and a 2IFC procedure for monocular, binocular, and dichoptic stimulus presentations. To\naccount for our results, we devised a simple model involving an isotropic monocular filter-stage\nfeeding orientation-tuned binocular filters. Both filter stages are adaptable, and their outputs are\navailable to the decision stage following nonlinear contrast transduction. However, the monocular\nisotropic filters (i) adapt only to high-speed stimuli--consistent with a magnocellular subcortical\nsubstrate--and (ii) benefit decision making only for high-speed stimuli (ie, isotropic monocular outputs\nare available only for high-speed stimuli). According to this model, the visual processes revealed by\nmasking, adaptation, and summation are related but not identical.\n",

These drive complex decision-making processes that control many\nof our interactions with the world. But how are the spatio-temporal retinal images encoded\nby our nervous system? Or put another way, what is the form of the neuronal representation\nthat observers use for their decision making?\nThe textbook answer is that isotropic spatial filtering in the retina and lateral geniculate\nnucleus (LGN) is followed by orientation-tuned filtering in the primary visual cortex (V1).\nThis view is supported by evidence from single-cell physiology, visual psychophysics, and\nvarious neural imaging techniques (Hubel and Wiesel 1962, 1968; Blakemore and Campbell\ncell recordings we know that the receptive fields of cells in the retina and the LGN are\napproximately circular, having antagonistic centres and surrounds, or superimposed regions\nof antagonism in a push-pull arrangement. In contrast, cortical cells have elongated receptive\nfields that are well suited to detecting elongated image structures such as edges but that do\nnot respond to edges, bars, or gratings that are oriented at right angles to their preferred\norientations. The observer's decision making in behavioural tasks is presumably cortical and\nis thought to tap the outputs of these orientation-tuned cells, in simple contrast detection\ntasks at least. In other words, although the visual analysis begins with orientation-insensitive\n(isotropic) filtering (using circular receptive fields), the visual code upon which an observer's\ndecision making is made is distributed across orientation-tuned filters.\n1.1 Psychophysical evidence for the textbook model of early vision\nEvidence from at least three psychophysical paradigms has been taken to support the\ntextbook model above: (i) threshold elevation produced by contrast masking is orientation\nselective (Phillips and Wilson 1984; Meese and Holmes 2010), (ii) threshold elevation\nproduced by contrast adaptation is orientation selective (Blakemore and Campbell 1969;\nSnowden 1992), and (iii) there is little or no subthreshold summation of contrast between\npairs of superimposed gratings with very different orientations (Kulikowski et al 1973; Phillips\nand Wilson 1984; Georgeson and Shackleton 1994). None of these results would be expected if\nobservers were to make their psychophysical decisions based on the outputs of mechanisms\nwith nonoriented (eg, isotropic) receptive fields.\nIntriguingly, though, the refinement in filtering (from isotropic to oriented) is counter-\nproductive for the contrast detection of patterns containing image structure at more than\none orientation. For example, consider a plaid made from a pair of superimposed sine-wave\ngratings with equal contrasts and oriented at right angles to each other. The Michelson\ncontrast of this plaid is twice that of each of its components. Similarly, the responses of\nlinear isotropic filter mechanisms situated at the peaks of the plaid are twice as high as the\nbest response to just one of its components. Thus, the benefits to contrast detection that\nare available from isotropic filtering in the retina and LGN are lost to the decision-making\nprocesses, owing to the oriented cortical filtering--in the textbook model of vision, at least\n(figure 1a).\nFigure 1. Three schematic models of achromatic spatio-temporal filtering in early vision. The filter\noutputs are available to the observer for decision making. The rose/lavender colour gradient indicates\nthe linear speed gradient across spatio-temporal space from fast (top left) to slow (bottom right). In all\ncases, the filtering outside the high-speed corner is thought to be oriented (rosettes). The filtering in the\nhigh-speed corner might be (a) oriented, (b) nonoriented (here we suppose isotropic), or (c) a mixture\nof the two. Our results point to the scheme in (c). They also indicate that the oriented mechanisms are\nbinocular (red), whereas the nonoriented mechanisms are monocular (blue). The allocation of the\nmagnocellular and parvocellular labels is an idealised interpretation of Derrington and Lennie (1984)\nand Merigan and Maunsell (1993). Notes: SF: spatial frequency; TF: temporal frequency.\n1.2 More masking, adaptation, and summation studies\nThe simple textbook picture outlined above (figure 1a) is a convenient one, but it has been\ncomplicated by subsequent experiments, which require a little untangling. Contrary to\nthe textbook model, Burbeck and Kelly (1981) found that masks oriented at right angles\nto the target were able to raise threshold after all. However, this effect was limited to very\nlow spatial frequencies (SF) and high temporal frequencies (TF): the high-speed corner of\nspatio-temporal frequency space (where speed = TF/SF; Burbeck and Kelly 1981; Meese and\nNonoriented filters are monocular and adaptable 161\nHolmes 2007). A further study by Ferrera and Wilson (1985) found a similar result. The authors\nof both studies concluded that the detecting mechanisms for their oriented targets were\nnonoriented. (By `detecting mechanism' we mean the mechanism whose output is used for\ndecision making.) This conclusion follows from a `within-channel' model of masking (Legge\nand Foley 1980; Wilson et al 1983), where masking is caused by a reduction in signal-to-noise\nratio brought about by excitation of the detecting mechanism by the mask. As the masks and\ntargets were at right angles to each other, the detecting mechanisms must be nonoriented,\nquite possibly isotropic. As it is unlikely that detecting mechanisms are subcortical, one\nobvious interpretation is that there is a set of isotropic detecting mechanisms in the cortex\nthat can be accessed by the observer when performing a detection task (figure 1b).\nSingle-cell recordings also provide some support for the conclusion above. In addition to\nthe well-known orientation-tuned cortical cells, several studies have reported subpopula-\ntions of layer 4 striate cells with isotropic receptive fields in cat (Hirsch et al 2003), in tree\nshrew (Mooser et al 2004), and in monkey (Hubel and Wiesel 1968; Blasdel and Fitzpatrick\n1984), offering a potential cortical substrate for Burbeck and Kelly's (1981) masking results.\nHowever, there is at least one alternative interpretation of the cross-orientation masking\nresults. Orientation-tuned cortical cells are thought to inhibit each other (Morrone et al 1982;\nBonds 1989; Heeger 1992), producing cross-orientation suppression, and this could be the\nbasis for the cross-orientation masking described above (Foley 1994; Meese and Holmes\nneurons found by Hirsch et al (2003) in layer 4 of the primary visual cortex (Meese et al 2008;\nRoeber et al 2008). This general type of arrangement--involving suppressive interactions--is\nsometimes referred to as `cross-channel' masking. There is also good psychophysical support\nfor this model from a dual-masking paradigm (Ross et al 1993; Foley 1994; Holmes and\nMeese 2004), from contrast matching (Meese and Hess 2004), from experiments involving\nfine-pattern discriminations (Olzak and Thomas 1999), and from the analysis of the slope\nof the psychometric function (Meese and Holmes 2007; Meese et al 2008). See Meese and\nThe conclusions above point back to the simple textbook model of early vision (figure 1a).\nUnfortunately, though, they do not resolve the issue because very different psychophysical\nresults have been taken to suggest the contrary. Kelly and Burbeck (1987) performed\ncross-orientation adaptation experiments--where fast flickering adapters and targets had\northogonal orientations--and found substantial threshold elevation. For the detecting\nmechanisms to be desensitized by this type of adapter, the implication was that they\nwere unselective for adapter orientation (figure 1b). However, more recent evidence that\nsubcortical magnocellular (but not parvocellular) cells are prone to adaptation (Solomon et\nal, 2004) offers another interpretation: Perhaps the cross-orientation adaptation effects were\nthe result of desensitization of the isotropic LGN cells (the subunits) that feed the oriented\ncortical mechanisms [but see Crowder et al (2006) for an alternative view]. The association of\nthe magnocellular pathway with the high-speed corner of spatio-temporal vision (Derrington\nand Lennie 1984) is also consistent with this interpretation. Thus, a second thrust towards\nthe arrangement in figure 1b turns out to remain consistent with that in figure 1a.\nIn a third strand of enquiry, Kelly and Burbeck (1987) also performed subthreshold\nsummation experiments for cross-oriented gratings and found about 3 dB (a factor of 2)\nof summation between equally detectable components in the high-speed corner of spatio-\ntemporal vision. This is more summation than expected for detection by independent\noriented filter mechanisms (Phillips and Wilson 1984; Georgeson and Shackleton 1994),\nwhich is typically about 1.5 dB (a factor of  1.2) according to several models of probability\nsummation (Tyler and Chen 2000). This result takes us back again to the scheme in figure 1b,\ninvolving nonoriented detection mechanisms.\nKelly and Burbeck (1987) considered the results from their masking, adaptation, and\nsummation experiments to provide good evidence for isotropic detecting mechanisms in the\nhigh-speed corner of spatio-temporal vision. However, the summation results were from just\na single observer, and as we have seen, their interpretations of the masking and adaptation\nresults are of questionable standing. Furthermore, there are some potential methodological\nproblems with some of the experiments. For example, the main masking and adaptation\nexperiments involved criterion-sensitive methods of assessment (method of adjustment\nand yes/no staircases). They also used a drifting adaptation stimulus, which added the\npotentially complicating factor of motion after-effects. Another potentially important factor\nis that Kelly and Burbeck (1987) performed their adaptation and subthreshold summation\nstudies monocularly. No explanation was offered for this, and although cross-orientation\nmasking effects have been found for binocular (Meese and Holmes 2007), monocular, and\ndichoptic mask and target arrangements (Baker et al 2007; Cass et al 2009; Meese and Baker\n2009), the question of whether monocular stimulation was an important factor for obtaining\ncross-orientation adaptation and summation effects (Kelly and Burbeck 1987) remains open.\nThis is potentially important because it could have implications for the ocularity of the filter\nmechanisms that are available for decision making.\n1.3 Aims and outcomes\nOur main aims here were three-fold. First, we wanted to make meaningful comparisons\nacross the three contrast detection paradigms above (masking, adaptation, and subthreshold\nsummation) by including common spatio-temporal conditions and observers within a\nsingle study. We used a jittering adaptation stimulus to avoid motion after-effects (see\nmethods for details) and two-alterative forced-choice (2AFC) methodology to avoid the\nproblems associated with criterion-sensitive methods. We also measured the slopes of the\npsychometric functions in the masking experiment to provide additional constraints on\ndata interpretation. Second, we performed the experiments using monocular, binocular, and\ndichoptic presentations of stimulus components to assess the ocularity of the mechanisms\ninvolved. This was to extend our ongoing investigation of binocular interactions in early\nThird, we wanted to develop a model of early spatio-temporal vision, consistent with the\nresults of Kelly and Burbeck (Burbeck and Kelly 1981; Kelly and Burbeck 1987) but also more\nrecent findings, including those of the experiments performed here.\n1.3.1 The value of masking, adaptation, and summation paradigms. Of the three psychophys-\nical paradigms used here we consider subthreshold summation to be the most valuable,\nsince it does not require detailed models or assumptions about suprathreshold interactions.\nModels of the interactions involved in masking are fairly well developed, and we do not\naim to extend them here. The main purpose of our masking experiment was to provide\nthe additional constraint [over that in the Burbeck and Kelly (1981) study] that comes from\nmeasuring the slope of the psychometric function. Owing to the potential complexity of\nthe processes involved in adaptation--the arrangement and interactions between filter\nmechanisms and the form and loci of desensitization (Tolhurst et al 1973; Foley and Chen\nand urge caution when interpreting results. Nevertheless, the simple model that we propose\ndoes a good job in accounting for most of our results.\n1.3.2 Possible filtering schemes for achromatic spatio-temporal vision. The general hypothe-\nses that we wished to test are summarised in figure 1. In all cases, contrast detection is by\nNonoriented filters are monocular and adaptable 163\noriented mechanisms for most of spatio-temporal space; the focus of interest is the high-\nspeed corner (top left in each panel).(1) In figure 1a this is purely oriented (the `textbook'\nmodel), in figure 1b it is purely nonoriented (Kelly and Burbeck 1987), and in figure 1c both\ntypes of mechanism exist. In each case the different mechanisms could be monocular and/or\nbinocular. Our results favour the model in figure 1c, with the new insight that nonoriented\nhigh-speed achromatic mechanisms are strictly monocular (blue) whereas the others are\nbinocular (red). We elaborate on the details of this scheme in the general discussion.\n2.1 Overview of the experiments\nWe ran five experiments in total. We refer to monocular masking, adaptation, and summation\nexperiments as experiments 1, 2a, and 3a, respectively. We refer to the adaptation and sum-\nmation experiments in which we manipulated ocularity (monocular, binocular, dichoptic)\nas experiments 2b and 3b, respectively. We did not manipulate ocularity for the masking\nexperiment here, but we have done so elsewhere (eg, Meese and Baker 2009).\n2.2 Apparatus and stimuli\nStimuli were presented using either a ViSaGe (experiments 1, 2a, and 3a) or a VSG2/5\n(experiments 2b and 3b) stimulus generator (both from Cambridge Research Systems Ltd,\nKent, UK), controlled by a PC. Each setup used a Clinton Monoray monitor (CRS) running\nat 120 Hz, with a maximum luminance output of 250cd/m2. The monitors were gamma\ncorrected using standard techniques. In all experiments observers viewed the display through\nferro-electric shutter goggles (CRS, model FE-1) to enable independent images to be shown\nto each eye using a frame interleaving technique. The goggles act as a neutral density filter of\n0.9 log units, which reduced the effective mean luminance of the display to 16cd/m2.\nTarget stimuli were circular sine-phase Gabor patches, oriented at \u00b145 deg. from vertical,\ndepending on the experimental conditions. The Gaussian spatial envelope had a full-width-\nat-half-height of 1.67 carrier cycles and the patch size scaled with spatial frequency. Our\nmain spatial frequency was 0.5c/deg. (all experiments), but some conditions were also run at\n2c/deg. (experiments 2a and 3a) and 0.25 c/deg. (reported in the general discussion). Stimuli\nwere temporally modulated using either a 15 Hz biphasic pulse for 0.25 c/deg. (`fast') and\n0.5 c/deg. stimuli (see figure 2c) or a single cycle of a 2 Hz sinusoidal modulation for 2c/deg.\nstimuli (`slow') (figure 2f). This produced stimulus durations of 67ms and 500ms, respectively.\nIn the adaptation paradigm (experiments 2a and 2b), the adapter was a large circular\npatch of sinusoidal grating, oriented at -45 deg. from vertical and with contrast of 80%. The\ntotal diameter of the adapter was 18 deg., with raised cosine blur the width of half a carrier\ncycle around the boundary (see figure 2d-e). If, instead, we had used an adapter matched to\nthe size of the target, then small eye-movements during adaptation could result in the target\nregion being underadapted. This is less likely to be a problem with our large adapting field.\nThe adapter was phase-jittered to prevent local luminance adaptation. This was done by\nincrementing the phase angle by 90 deg.+x, where x is a random value in the range 0:180 deg.\nThe jitter was constructed to be consistent with the temporal properties of the appropriate\ntarget stimulus: for 15 Hz conditions a phase shift occurred every 33 ms, and for the 2 Hz\nconditions it occurred every 250 ms. A control experiment confirmed that this produced\nsimilar results to the more conventional counter-phase flickering adapter.\n(1)By `speed' we mean the ratio of temporal frequency to spatial frequency (TF/SF). All of the stimuli\nin this study were flickering gratings. They did not drift.\nStimulus contrast is reported as Michelson contrast in percent (100(Lmax -Lmin)/(Lmax +\nLmin)).\nFigure 2. Spatial and temporal properties of the jittering or flickering (adapter) stimuli used in this\nstudy. None of our stimuli drifted. (a, b) Left- and right-oblique Gabor patches (\u00b145 deg.), used as\ntargets in all experiments. In experiment 1 they were also used as masks. (d, e) Adapter stimuli at\nthe two main spatial frequencies (0.5c/deg. and 2c/deg.). Temporal waveforms were a (`fast') 15 Hz\nbiphasic pulse (c) and a (`slow') single cycle of 2 Hz sinusoidal modulation (f).\nIn all experiments we measured contrast-detection thresholds for oriented Gabor patches,\nsometimes in the presence of a mask. Observers were seated in a darkened room with their\nhead in a chin support to which the shutter goggles were attached. The viewing distance was\n57cm. All experiments used a temporal two-interval forced-choice (2IFC) paradigm, with an\ninterstimulus interval of either 400ms (DHB) or 500ms (all other observers). The stimulus\nlocation was indicated by a quad of fixation points placed on a virtual circle with a radius of\nPsychometric functions were fitted using a 3-parameter Weibull function to estimate\nthreshold (81.6% correct after correcting for lapsing), slope, and lapse rate (Wichmann\nand Hill 2001a, 2001b). Data from each experimental block were fitted independently,\nand the thresholds and slopes were averaged across multiple blocks, and then across\nobservers. A bootstrapping technique was used to resample the original fits to each individual\npsychometric function to produce threshold and slope distributions for statistical analyses.\nSignificance testing was always two-tailed.\nSpecific procedures for each experiment were as described below.\n2.4 Experiment 1: monocular masking\nThere were five conditions: (i) no mask, (ii, iii) co-oriented masks at 2% and 30% contrast, and\n(iv, v) cross-oriented masks at 2% and 30% contrast. The target was always a 0.5c/deg. right\noblique Gabor patch. All stimuli were presented monocularly to the right eye and the left\nNonoriented filters are monocular and adaptable 165\neye viewed mean luminance. Preliminary staircases were run to determine the approximate\nsensitivity in each condition, in order to set target contrast levels for the main experiment. To\nachieve detailed measures of the psychometric functions, we used the method of constant\nstimuli, with six target contrast levels per condition. Each block consisted of 40 trials per\ncontrast level presented in a random order for a given condition. Each observer completed\nfour blocks, giving 960 trials per psychometric function.\n2.5 Experiment 2a: monocular adaptation\nThe adaptation regimen consisted of two minutes of continuous adaptation at the start\nof a block, and 5 seconds of top-up adaptation before each trial. Between the top-up\nadaptation and the first 2IFC interval there was a gap of 400 ms. The adapter was always\nleft oblique (-45 deg.), and the target was either left oblique (co-oriented) or right oblique\n(cross-oriented), with conditions blocked by target orientation. All stimuli were presented\nmonocularly to the right eye, and the left eye viewed mean luminance. Baseline thresholds\n(involving no adaptation phase) were measured for both orientations in the right (target) eye\nin blocks at the beginning and end of the entire experimental series and on different days\nfrom the adaptation. Adaptation was performed for the 0.5c/deg. and the 2c/deg. stimuli on\ndifferent days. Target contrast was determined by a pair of 3-down\u00ad1-up staircases, with a\nstep size of 3 dB (where contrast in dB is twenty times the log10\nof the Michelson contrast).\nEach adaptation block lasted around 15 minutes, and there were four blocks of trials for each\ncondition.\n2.6 Experiment 2b: multiple ocular adaptation conditions\nThe methods were similar to those for experiment 2a, except that only one spatial frequency\n(0.5c/deg.) was used, and there were three ocular arrangements of target and adapter. In\nthe monocular condition the target and adapter were both presented to the right eye. This\ncondition was identical to its equivalent from experiment 2a. In the dichoptic condition\nthe adapter was presented to the left eye, and the target was presented to the right eye.\nIn the binocular condition both adapter and target were presented to both eyes. Only one\nocular condition was performed on any given day. Baseline thresholds were measured for\nthe relevant binocular and monocular targets in the same way as above.\n2.7 Experiment 3a: monocular cross-orientation summation\nWe measured subthreshold summation for orthogonally (cross-)oriented Gabor patches\nin the right eye using the method of constant stimuli. The range of target contrasts was\ndetermined by the results from experiments 1 and 2a. Thresholds were measured for the left-\nand right-oblique component stimuli (ie, Gabor orientations of -45 deg. and 45 deg.), and\ntheir sum (the compound), for both spatial frequencies. Preliminary analysis showed that\nthe sensitivity for the two orientations was very similar and so results were averaged across\ncomponent orientations for comparison with the compound stimulus when calculating the\nsummation ratio (see Results).\n2.8 Experiment 3b: multiple ocular summation conditions\nThis experiment was similar to experiment 3a, except that there were three ocular conditions,\neach performed with the 0.5c/deg. stimulus. The monocular condition was as described\nfor experiment 3a, and the binocular condition was the same except that the stimuli were\npresented to both eyes. In the dichoptic condition one target component (left oblique) was\npresented to the right eye, and the other target component (right oblique) was presented to\nthe left eye. Thus, in the compound condition different eyes saw different stimuli.\n2.9 Observers and preliminary analysis\nThree undergraduate optometry students participated in experiments 1, 2a, and 3a as part of\ntheir course requirements (AJ, KB, SS). Experiments 2b and 3b were completed by one author\n(DHB) and four undergraduate students (JC, MD, RP, SB), one of whom was paid (SB), the\nothers participating for course credit. All observers wore their required optical correction\nduring testing and had normal stereopsis (ie, they were able to see depth in stereograms\ncontaining crossed and uncrossed disparities).\nPreliminary analysis of the results led us to exclude the data from two of the undergraduate\nobservers in experiments 2b and 3b. For one observer (MD), the psychometric functions\nwere remarkably unreliable as revealed by their unusually high standard errors (SE > 3 dB\nfor more than half of the psychometric functions). For the other (JC) there was a marked\ninstability in the baseline measures: contrast detection thresholds were 3 dB higher in the\nblock of baselines measured at the end of the experiment compared with the first. This made\nit impractical to evaluate the after-effects of adaptation for this observer. Observers DHB and\nSB were subsequently recruited to replace the discarded datasets.\n3 Results and discussion\n3.1 Experiment 1: monocular masking\nThe stimulus conditions for the monocular masking experiment are summarised in figure 3a.\nExample psychometric functions are shown for one observer (AJ) in figure 3b for each of the\nfive mask conditions (see legend of figure 3b). Note that relative to baseline (black), these are\nshifted rightwards for the 30% contrast masks (dark blue), regardless of whether the mask was\nco-oriented or cross-oriented relative to the target, but that the slope of the psychometric\nfunction becomes very shallow only in the co-oriented condition (solid dark blue).\nThreshold elevation (TE) was calculated in the conventional way as follows: TE =\n(CM ASK /CNO_M ASK ), where CM ASK and CNO_M ASK are the contrast detection thresh-\nolds with and without the mask, respectively. Figure 3c shows threshold elevation averaged\nacross the three observers (AJ, KB, and SS). (In this, and other bar charts, results for individual\nobservers are shown by the coloured dots.) Average slopes of the psychometric functions are\nshown in figure 3d.\nFor threshold elevation statistical significance was evaluated by assessing the difference\nbetween the averaged bootstrapped populations for baseline and masked thresholds. For\npsychometric slopes we compared the bootstrapped populations for each condition to a\nvalue of  = 1.3, which is the characteristic of a linear psychometric function(2) (Foley and\n(and other figures) by one asterisk for p < 0.05 and two asterisks for p < 0.01.\nThe co-oriented mask produced threshold elevation of around 12 dB (a factor of 4) at\nhigh contrasts (30%), but produced a threshold reduction at low contrasts (2%) of around\n7 dB (a factor of> 2). These statistically significant effects are consistent with the well-known\ndipper function for pedestal masking (Legge and Foley 1980). The co-oriented mask reduced\nthe slope of the psychometric function (Weibull ) substantially, from  > 5 with no mask\nto  = 1.8 for the low contrast mask, and  = 1.1 for the high contrast mask. The latter value\nis not significantly different from the prediction of  = 1.3, as anticipated by the linearizing\neffect of pedestal contrast for small signal increments (Foley and Legge 1981; Bird et al 2002;\nThe high-contrast cross-oriented mask produced significant threshold elevation of\naround 8 dB (ie, it was about 4 dB less potent than the co-oriented mask), whereas the\n(2)By this we mean the sigmoidal psychometric function produced by a linear system (ie, the\npsychometric function produced by a linear contrast transducer). When expressed as d' (ie, d' as\na function of target contrast), the psychometric function for a linear system is linear and has a slope of\nunity.\nNonoriented filters are monocular and adaptable 167\nlow-contrast cross-oriented mask did not affect threshold significantly. Although slopes for\nthese conditions were shallower than for the baseline, they were both significantly steeper\nthan  = 1.3, with values around  = 3 .\n3.1.1 Interpretation of masking results. For a conventional within-channel model of mask-\ning--where masking derives from direct excitation of the target mechanism by the mask\n(Wilson et al 1983; see also Meese and Holmes 2010) --the effects of cross-orientation\nmasking might be taken to indicate nonoriented detecting mechanisms (Ferrera and\nWilson 1985). However, in contradistinction from co-oriented masking: (i) the slope of the\npsychometric function was not linearized (it was not reduced to  = 1.3) (Meese and Holmes\n2007), and (ii) there was no facilitation (Foley 1994). This shows that different processes were\ninvolved for the two mask orientations. These results are consistent with previous studies of\nand Holmes 2007) and stand against a within-channel account, suggesting that our high-\nspeed targets (low spatial frequency, high temporal frequency) were detected by oriented\ndetection mechanisms subject to suppressive interactions from the mask. We consider the\nnature of these interactions in the general discussion.\nFigure 3. Masking experiment (experiment 1). (a) Stimulus configurations (mask plus lower contrast\ntarget) for co-oriented and cross-oriented conditions).

In this figure and others bars show results (\u00b11SE) averaged across three\nobservers (here: AJ, KB, and SS), and the coloured circles are for individual observers. Asterisks indicate\nstatistical significance, as described in the text. The dotted horizontal line indicates  = 1.3, which is\nthe psychometric slope expected for a linear system.\n3.2 Experiment 2a: monocular adaptation\nThe stimulus conditions for the adaptation experiments are summarised in figure 4a.\nThreshold elevation (TE) from adaptation was calculated in the conventional way as follows:\nCAD APT /CB ASELINE ), where CAD APT and CB ASELINE are the contrast detection\nthresholds with and without adaptation, respectively. This is shown for the two adaptation\nconditions and two spatial frequencies in figure 4b, averaged across three observers (AJ, KB,\nand SS). The co-oriented adapter raised thresholds significantly--by around 6 dB (a factor of\n2)--at both spatial frequencies. When the adapter was cross-oriented, threshold elevation\nwas weaker (2.2 dB), but significant in the fast condition (0.5 c/deg., 15 Hz flicker). There\nwas no significant threshold elevation in the slow condition (2 c/deg., 2 Hz flicker) for the\ncross-oriented adapter.\n3.2.1 Interpretation of monocular adaptation results. The standard view of adaptation is that\nthe adapter desensitizes the visual mechanisms that respond to the adapter, with the caveat\nthat some visual mechanisms do not adapt (eg, parvocellular cells in the LGN; Movshon and\nLennie 1979; Solomon et al 2004). Therefore, these results provide evidence for a nonoriented\ncomponent to the detection process in the high-speed corner of spatio-temporal vision. We\nwill elaborate on what that might be in the general discussion.\nFigure 4. Adaptation experiments. Stimulus configurations (a) are shown for the two orientation\nconditions in experiments 2a and 2b (b and c, respectively) and for each of the three ocular conditions\nin experiment 2b (c). The `fast' stimuli had a spatial frequency of 0.5 c/deg. and temporal frequency\nof 15 Hz. The `slow' stimuli had a spatial frequency of 2 c/deg. and a temporal frequency of 2 Hz\n(see figure 2 for details). In (b) and (c) asterisks denote the conditions where threshold elevation for\ncontrast detection was significantly different from 0 dB.\nNonoriented filters are monocular and adaptable 169\n3.3 Experiment 2b: Multiple ocular adaptation conditions\nWe repeated the fast stimulus condition from experiment 2a in three ocular arrangements.\nThe monocular condition was an exact replication of the condition from experiment 2a,\nbut for three different observers (RP\n, DHB, and SB). The results were very similar to before,\nwith significant adaptation after-effects of around 5.2 dB and 2.2 dB for the co-oriented\nand cross-oriented targets, respectively (figure 4, blue). When the adapter and target were\npresented binocularly (figure 4c, red), the adaptation after-effect was weaker than in the\nmonocular case for each of the adapter orientations. For the co-oriented target the effect\ndropped marginally (to 4.4 dB), and for the cross-oriented target the effect was abolished\n(there was no significant effect). When the adapter and target were presented to different eyes\n(dichoptic condition), there was a small negative adaptation after-effect of around 1 dB (ie,\ndetection performance was slightly improved by adaptation). This was statistically significant\n(p < 0.05) for both orientations (figure 4c, green).\n3.3.1 Interpretation of adaptation within and between the eyes. If the nonoriented compo-\nnent of adaptation identified in experiment 2 arose after binocular combination, then it\nshould have been evident in the dichoptic condition. The fact that it was not suggests that\nthe effect arises within purely monocular mechanisms. Similar conclusions follow from\npreliminary reports of a related adaptation study by Cass (2010).\nThe finding of facilitation in the dichoptic condition (and its inconsistency across\nobservers) replicates an earlier finding by Baker et al (2007) and preliminary reports by\nthe release of standing inhibition between cross-oriented mechanisms in different eyes. That\nis, the cross-oriented adaptation causes disinhibition across orientation and eye. Similarly,\nthe release of standing inhibition between co-oriented mechanisms in different eyes would\nexplain the co-oriented facilitation.(3) This type of inhibitory interaction between the eyes\nand its release by adaptation in the fellow eye might also explain why the after-effects were\nsmaller in the binocular condition than in the monocular condition (figure 4c).\n3.4 Experiment 3a: Monocular cross-orientation summation\nSummation ratios (SR) were calculated in the conventional way as follows: SR =\n(CLR/CL+R), where CLR is the average detection threshold for the individual\ncomponents and CL+R is the detection threshold for the compound stimulus (the sum\nof the two components). With this arrangement, SR = 6 dB (a factor of 2) would indicate\nperfect linear summation, and SR = 0 dB (a factor of 1) would indicate no summation (ie, no\nbenefit of adding a second component to the first). Summation ratios are plotted in figure 5b\naveraged across three observers (AJ, KB, and SS). Only modest levels of summation were\nfound at each spatio-temporal frequency, but were greater in the fast condition (0.5 c/deg.,\n3.4.1 Types of summation. Probability summation [sometimes called `signal selection'; Meese\nand Baker (2011)] is usually taken to be the minimal combination rule (Tyler and Chen 2000).\nWhen this occurs between two sets of independent noisy linear mechanisms, the SR is\nabout 1.5 dB (Tyler and Chen 2000). Nonlinearities prior to probability summation would\nreduce this value further. For example, a square-law transducer produces SR  0.75 dB in\nconjunction with probability summation. A distinct alternative to probability summation is\nsignal combination, where signals are summed within a single mechanism. Most analyses\n(3)Only one of the three observers here (SB) shows good evidence of the co-oriented dichoptic\nfacilitatory effect. Preliminary analysis of work to be published elsewhere found only weak evidence\nfor this in 3 of the 5 observers (up to 1.4 dB of facilitation). Clearly, even if real, the facilitatory effect is\ntypically small and inconsistent across observers. We consider this effect to be a minor observation\nand one that is peripheral to the main conclusions and motivations in this paper.\nfind that this is a more potent form of summation than probability summation (eg, see\ncomplicated by the potential effects of spatial pooling (eg, Georgeson and Shackleton 1994;\nBergen et al 1979) and integration of early noise (Meese 2010), each of which can dilute the\npredicted level of summation across orientation. For example, for our sine-phase Gabor\npatches linear summation across orientation followed by peak-picking (a MAX operator)\nacross space and late additive noise predicts SR = 5.6 dB (nearly a factor of 2). But it is easy to\nshow that this drops to 3.9 dB, 3.0 dB (a factor of 2), and 2.1 dB for Minkowski summation\nover space using Minkowski exponents of 4 (fourth-root), 2 (quadratic; Meese 2010), and 1\n(linear), respectively.(4)\nTo establish evidence for signal combination across orthogonal orientations, we required\nthat summation were significantly greater than the probability summation level of SR =\n1.5 dB. This criterion was met in the fast condition, with empirical summation levels just\nmore than 2 dB. For the slow condition summation was actually a little less than 1.5 dB (see\nfigure 5b).\n3.4.2 Interpretation of summation results. These results (figure 5b) suggest there are mecha-\nnisms in the high-speed corner of spatio-temporal vision that can perform signal combina-\ntion of luminance contrast across orthogonal orientations and that the observer can use these\nmechanisms in contrast detection tasks. Isotropic cortical mechanisms (cells with circular\nreceptive fields) are plausible candidates for this because they sum luminance modulations\nat all orientations.\n3.5 Experiment 3b: Multiple ocular summation conditions\nWe also extended the cross-orientation summation experiment to multiple ocular conditions\nusing the fast stimuli (0.5 c/deg., 15 Hz flicker). The results are shown in figure 5c. The\nmonocular condition produced 3.1 dB of summation--a little more than the equivalent\ncondition from the different observers in experiment 3a--and as before, was significantly\ngreater than the probability summation prediction of 1.5 dB. (The average level of monocular\nsummation across experiments 3a and 3b was 2.6 dB; n = 6 observers). When the stimuli\n(4)These standard computations are fairly simple, but it is not easy to provide intuitions for the results,\nand the equations involved do little to help (not shown). There are one or two points that we can make,\nthough. First, the usual intuition for linear summation between two equally detectable components\n(for which the response to each is one arbitrary unit) with late additive noise (ie, limiting noise that\narises at the final stage, just before the decision variable) is that the summation ratio is 2 (6 dB),\nbecause 1+1 = 2. For sine-wave gratings this intuition holds if a MAX operator is used over space so\nthat the computation is not affected by spatial pooling. For the sine-phase Gabor stimuli used here\nthe contrast modulation at right angles to the orientation of the bars means that the spatial peak\nin the compound stimulus is the sum of two local contrasts, each of which is slightly less than the\nMichelson contrast of each component. Therefore, the summation ratio is slightly less than 2 (here,\n5.6 dB), assuming the spatial MAX operator again. Second, it is well-known (eg, Bergen et al 1979)\nthat when pairs of differently oriented 1D luminance modulations (eg, gratings or Gabor patches)\nare summed, the constructive and destructive interference across two-dimensional space (the beats)\nmeans that when spatial pooling (ie, the combination of responses over space) is more potent than\na MAX operator, there is a reduction in the benefit of the second component. As the spatial pooling\nexponent (ie, Minkowski exponent) is increased (ie, spatial pooling becomes more nonlinear) this\neffect decreases. For example, a large Minkowski exponent (eg,  10) represents highly nonlinear\nspatial pooling and is a good approximation to the spatial MAX operator (above), which preserves the\nintuitive summation ratio of 2 (6 dB) across grating orientation. [Note that the comments here are for\nthe situation where the limiting noise is late. When limiting noise is placed before the MAX operation,\nthe effects of pooling are often approximated by a Minkowski exponent of about 4, assuming a linear\nNonoriented filters are monocular and adaptable 171\nFigure 5. Cross-orientation summation experiments (experiments 3a and 3b). Stimulus configurations\nare shown in (a) and results for experiments 3a and 3b in (b) and (c), respectively. The `fast' stimuli\nhad a spatial frequency of 0.5 c/deg. and temporal frequency of 15 Hz. The `slow' stimuli had a spatial\nfrequency of 2 c/deg. and a temporal frequency of 2 Hz (see figure 2 for details).

Statistical tests were performed against this criterion, and significant results are denoted\nby the asterisks at the top of the figures.\nwere presented either binocularly or dichoptically, summation was weaker ( 1.8 dB) and\nnot significantly greater than 1.5 dB.\n3.5.1 Interpretation of summation within and between the eyes. If the nonoriented detecting\nmechanism identified in experiment 3 were binocular, then the levels of dichoptic and\nmonocular cross-orientation summation should have been the same because the binocular\nresponse would be the same for each of these conditions. The fact that the SR was less in the\ndichoptic condition suggests that the isotropic detecting mechanisms are purely monocular.\nBut why should there be less summation for binocular stimuli than monocular stimuli? In\nfact, the scheme we are to propose does predict that this should happen, but we withhold\nexplanation until after describing the model details in the general discussion.\n4 General discussion\nWe performed masking, adaptation, and summation experiments for the contrast detec-\ntion of achromatic flickering Gabor patches. We found interactions across orientation in all\nthree paradigms. For adaptation and summation the effects were greater for the fast condition\n(0.5 c/deg., 15 Hz flicker; 30 deg./s) than the slow condition (2 c/deg., 2 Hz flicker; 1 deg./s),\nconfirming previous reports of a departure from scale invariance (Kelly and Burbeck 1987).\nElsewhere this departure has also been reported for cross-orientation masking (Burbeck and\nThe summation results provide good evidence for nonoriented detecting mechanisms in\nthe high-speed corner of spatio-temporal vision and reject the `textbook' scheme involving\nonly oriented detectors (figure 1a). However, although the results of our masking experiment\nconfirm the existence of cross-orientation interactions, we doubt these derive from within-\nchannel activity in isotropic detecting mechanisms because of the steep psychometric\nfunction and the lack of facilitation (see results section). It is more likely that the target\nwas detected by an oriented mechanism that was suppressed by the cross-oriented mask\nthan that the high-speed corner of spatio-temporal vision was dominated by nonoriented\nmechanisms (figure 1b). This leaves the hypothesis in figure 1c: there are both nonoriented\nand oriented mechanisms in the high-speed corner of spatio-temporal vision.\nFor the adaptation and summation experiments we also found greater cross-orientation\neffects for monocular conditions than dichoptic conditions. The summation result is new and\nsuggests that the nonoriented detection mechanisms that we have investigated are purely\nmonocular. We have denoted this with the dark blue colouring in figure 1c. The adaptation\nresult confirms some previous observations (Kelly and Burbeck 1987; Meese et al 2007; Bex\nIn the study here we were able to calculate a binocular summation ratio (not shown)\nfor co-oriented components from the monocular and binocular thresholds measured in\nexperiments 2b and 3b. On average, this was 3.9 dB for the fast target (n = 3 observers). This is\nsimilar to previous studies (eg, Meese et al 2006) and confirms the existence of conventional\n(co-oriented) binocular summation in the study here. Furthermore, in a preliminary report\nby Georgeson and Meese (2007) binocular summation ratios were derived for a wide range\nof spatio-temporal frequencies. Signal combination was found in all cases providing firm\nevidence for binocular mechanisms throughout spatio-temporal vision (red symbols in\nfigure 1c).\nWe present a summary of the full set of our current results in table 1. This is in anticipation\nof the qualitative assessment of our model in the following sections, where we cross reference\nthe effect numbers in this table.\n4.1 A specific proposal\nHow might early vision be wired to be consistent with our results? Figure 6 shows a simple\nneural hierarchy designed to achieve this, where figure 6a is for the high-speed corner\nof spatio-temporal vision, assessed by our `fast' stimulus condition, and figure 6b is for\neverywhere else, assessed by our `slow' stimulus condition (we discuss this generalization\nbelow). In figure 6a a pair of isotropic monocular filters at level 1 feed into an oriented\nbinocular filter at level 2. The green dashed boxes indicate that all three mechanisms are\nsusceptible to adaptation. For simplicity, we have shown binocular summation, orientation\nfiltering, and adaptation at a single stage in level 2, though several sub-stages might be\ninvolved. The addressable outputs of all three filters pass through sigmoidal transducers\n(Legge and Foley 1980) before reaching the decision stage. [We note that detailed models of\nmore elaborate datasets might involve multiple stages of contrast transduction (Meese and\nSummers 2009; Meese and Baker 2011)]. In principle, this contrast transduction could derive\nfrom accelerating square-law energy mechanisms (Duong and Freeman 2008; Meese 2010)\nand dynamic contrast gain control (Foley 1994). Figure 6b is identical to figure 6a except that\n(i) there are no monocular outputs from the isotropic mechanisms and (ii) the desensitizing\neffect of adaptation is limited to the orientation-tuned mechanism (green dashed box).\nNonoriented filters are monocular and adaptable 173\nTable 1.

Four changes\nto figure 6a are needed to produce figure 6b, which reduces to two by symmetry (remove\nmonocular outputs, remove monocular adaptability). Arguably then, a total of five design\ndecisions were required to construct the model. Without elaboration or extension, this\nsimple model is consistent with 13 of the 18 effects reported here (as we shall soon describe).\nA further four of these effects (effects 2, 9, 13, and 15) are easily explained with simple\nelaborations and refinements, as are another two relevant effects from other studies (3 and 4).\nOnly one (effect 12) is not easily explained within the framework we propose and probably\nrequires detailed quantitative modelling to be properly understood. This is beyond the scope\nof this study and the constraints of our data. In what follows we provide a brief overview of\nthe qualitative relation between our model and all 20 effects in table 1 (18 from this study,\nincluding 5 null effects, and 2 from elsewhere), starting with adaptation, then summation,\nand finally masking.\n4.2.1 Adaptation in the model and in humans. Threshold elevation occurs for monocular\ncross-oriented adapters (effect 10) owing to the adaptable isotropic filters at level 1 in figure 6a\nnot happen in the dichoptic case (effect 11) because there is no adaptable node (green\ndashed box) that is common to orthogonal orientations in different eyes. However, why\nshould monocular adaptation be orientation tuned (effect 13)? (That is, why is threshold\nelevation greater for co-oriented adapters than for cross-oriented adapters?) As the only\nadaptable monocular route is isotropic, the implication is that the oriented binocular filter is\nFigure 6. Proposed circuit diagrams for the mechanisms of achromatic spatio-temporal vision. (a)\nArrangement for isotropic monocular mechanisms and oriented binocular mechanisms in the high-\nspeed corner of figure 1c. (b) Arrangement for the oriented binocular mechanisms outside the\nhigh-speed corner of figure 1c. The green dashed squares indicate the various loci of adaptation.\nThe assignment of levels 1 and 2 to subcortex and cortex is based on known physiology and is\nnot constrained by the results here. The implication is that the outputs of adaptable isotropic\nfilters are available for decision-making in the high-speed corner of spatiotemporal vision, but not\nelsewhere. (The various pathways that might be involved in cross-channel suppression and interocular\nsuppression are omitted for clarity but have been shown in previous publications: Meese et al 2006;\nused for the detection. But why should this happen, given that this route takes a double hit\nfrom adaptation? We suggest that the orientation tuning derives, in part, from linear spatial\nsummation across an array of isotropic filter elements (Hubel and Wiesel 1962; Mooser et al\n2004). Thus, the oriented filter elements are more sensitive than their nonoriented subunits\nbecause of the benefit of spatial summation within their elongated receptive fields (Meese\n2010). Instead, we might have pursued a more complex argument (and model) involving\noriented monocular filters. Indeed, we cannot rule out the possibility that such mechanisms\nexist, but we were not compelled to appeal to them here. But we do need the monocular\nisotropic outputs in figure 6a to account for the summation results, as we describe in the\nnext section.\nThreshold elevation is greater at higher stimulus speeds (effect 14) because in this corner\nof spatio-temporal vision there are two stages of adaptation (figure 6a), compared with the\nsingle stage elsewhere (figure 6b).\nAs explained above, there is no threshold elevation for cross-oriented dichoptic masking\n(effect 11), but there is a facilitatory after-effect, and this is found for both orientations of\nthe dichoptic adapter (effect 15). This is not explained by the model in figure 6, but it can\nbe achieved by the simple extension described in the results: if the model were to include\nsuppressive interactions across eyes and orientation (Sengpiel et al 1995; Walker et al 1998;\nal 2007; Moradi and Heeger 2009), then when adapted, these could result in disinhibition\nand facilitation (see Meese et al 2007).\nIn figure 6a we would expect binocular cross-orientation adaptation to be just as potent as\nits monocular counterpart. The fact that it was not (effect 12) points to a potential weakness\nin the model. It is possible that this might have something to do with interocular suppression\nbetween the binocular adapters, which is not explicit in the simple scheme sketched out in\nfigure 6. For example, we have found that when a mask in one eye is matched to a mask in the\nother eye, this can reduce the potency of the original mask. We say that the binocular match\nof the masks gates the level of masking (Meese and Hess 2005; Baker et al 2007). Similar\nNonoriented filters are monocular and adaptable 175\neffects have been found for binocular rivalry (Nichols and Wilson 2009). We now see that a\nbinocular match of a cross-oriented adapter also reduces the potency of cross-orientation\nadaptation (effects 10 and 12). Another possibility is that there is disinhibition from the\ninterocular component of the binocular adapter (see our explanation of effect 15 above),\nwhich cancels out the adaptation effect of desensitization. However, the variability in our\ndata (across observers) dissuaded us from attempting to develop a detailed quantitative\nmodel of this effect.\n4.2.2 Summation in the model and in humans. Cross-oriented signal combination is seen\nfor pairs of monocular components (effect 16) because contrast is linearly summed across\norientation by the isotropic filters at level 1 (figure 6a) and this output is available to the\ndecision stage. We have argued above that the oriented filter elements are more sensitive\nthan the isotropic filter elements, but presumably, the extra stimulus component that is\nvisible to the isotropic filter overcomes this setback. This does not happen for binocular\nstimuli, however (effect 18), because in that case the more sensitive oriented binocular filter\nalso benefits from summing a pair of parallel components from the two eyes. Summing a\npair of monocular components across orientation within the less sensitive isotropic filters\ncannot beat this binocular benefit.\nThere is no cross-orientation signal combination for dichoptic presentation (effect 17)\nbecause the two components do not stimulate a common isotropic filter.\nCross-orientation signal combination occurs only at high speeds (effect 19) because there\nare no outputs from isotropic filters at lower speeds (figure 6b).\nFinally, there is binocular summation of co-oriented components (effect 20) because the\nmodel contains oriented binocular mechanisms at all spatio-temporal frequencies.\n4.2.3 Masking in the model and in humans. Pedestal masking (effect 1) in the model derives\nfrom the compressive region of the sigmoidal contrast nonlinearity at high contrasts (Legge\nMonocular cross-orientation masking (effect 2) could arise from either of two routes.\nFirst, it could arise from cross-orientation inhibition between oriented mechanisms in the\n2011), an approach that could also accommodate cross-oriented dichoptic masking (effect\nThis is not shown in figure 6, but the scheme is easily extended to do this, and we have made\nexplicit proposals elsewhere (Baker et al 2007; Baker and Meese 2007). The simplest method\nhere would be to replace the sigmoidal output nonlinearities with dynamic contrast gain\ncontrol with a broadly tuned suppression field (Foley 1994; Meese and Holmes 2010). This\nwould involve inhibitory interactions amongst differently oriented mechanisms at level 2\nin figure 6.(5) A second explanation of effect 2 is that masking arises within the isotropic\nfilters at level 1 (Klein et al 1997; Meese and Holmes 2010). If the output characteristic of\nthese cells were such that the cross-oriented mask reduced the effective contrast available\nto the subsequent stage of orientation filtering, then this would produce suppression while\nretaining the characteristics of the output nonlinearity at the decision stage. One way that\nthis could be achieved would be from an isotropic suppression field, such as that identified\nin the retina (Shapley and Victor 1978) and LGN (Bonin et al 2005) of cats [see Meese and\nThe fact that cross-orientation masking is more potent at high stimulus speeds (effect 4)\nis not an emergent property of our model here, but it could be easily accommodated by the\n(5)The details are more complicated than this. Elsewhere (Baker et al 2007; Meese and Baker 2009)\nwe have argued that the suppressive interactions arise after orientation tuning but before binocular\nsummation. This implies an additional stage between stages 1 and 2 in figure 6.\nappropriate setting of suppression weights in the contrast gain control at either level 1 or\nThe pedestal facilitation (effect 5) is explained in the conventional way (Legge and Foley\n1980)--by arranging that the output nonlinearity accelerates at low contrasts, similar to the\nsquare-law process needed for energy (or power) detection (Meese 2010). This also produces\na steep psychometric function at detection threshold (effect 8) (Foley and Legge 1981). Since\nnone of our proposals for cross-orientation masking attribute the effect to within-channel\nexcitation of isotropic detecting mechanisms (ie, we do not require that the observer is able\nto access the outputs of the isotropic filters in the masking experiment), the cross-oriented\nmask does not drive the sigmoidal output nonlinearity at the decision stage. Therefore, there\nis no facilitation (effect 6), and the psychometric function is steep for cross-orientation\nmasking (effect 9) (Holmes and Meese 2004). However, it is shallow for pedestal masking\n(effect 7) because of the linearizing effect for small signal increments caused by the drive up\n4.2.4 Model summary and interpretation. For the purposes of this paper the important\nfeatures of our model are illustrated in figures 1c and 6. As with previous proposals (Hubel and\nWiesel 1962; Mooser et al 2004), oriented filters are fed by (arrays of) isotropic filters. However,\nthe isotropic filters are also available for decision making, but only within monocular\nchannels selective for low spatial frequencies and high temporal frequencies. Isotropic filters\nare also prone to adaptation in this corner of spatio-temporal vision. Taken together with\nresults from neurophysiology (Solomon et al 2004), our model of achromatic vision might\nbe interpreted as follows: the observer can tap into an image-representation at an earlier\nstage in the (transient) magnocellular stream than in the (sustained) parvocellular stream\n(the situation for chromatic vision is probably different, as we discuss below). However, the\npurpose of this monocular privilege remains unclear.\nThe results of the adaptation and summation experiments here (experiments 2b and 3b)\nsuggest that Kelly and Burbeck (1987) were wise (or fortuitous) to conduct their experiments\nmonocularly. Indeed, for the experimental conditions used here this type of presentation\nis essential for revealing each type of cross-orientation interaction. This also follows from\npreliminary observations of adaptation recently reported by Cass (2010).\n4.3.1 Monocular summation. In the high-speed corner of spatio-temporal vision the average\nlevel of cross-orientation summation found by us (2.6 dB) was only a little less than that\nfound by Kelly and Burbeck (1987) ( 3 dB). We note that Kelly and Burbeck reported results\nfor only a single observer and that one of our six observers (RP) produced summation levels\nthat were in excess of this (figure 5c). We have presented quantitative arguments (see the\nresults section for experiment 3a) to suggest we might expect only modest effects of cross-\norientation summation from isotropic mechanisms (2 to 3 dB) if spatial summation were a\nsignificant factor (see also Bergen et al 1979), consistent with our average results.\n4.3.2 Monocular adaptation. A comparison between our monocular cross-adaptation results\nand those of Kelly and Burbeck reveals notable differences. We have replicated their finding\nthat thresholds are elevated in the high-speed corner of spatio-temporal vision by adapting\nto an orientation at right angles to the target, but our effects (typically a little less than 3 dB)\nare notably smaller than theirs (typically a little greater than 6 dB). Why might this be? We\nwondered whether we might get larger effects at faster speeds, so DHB performed cross-\norientation adaptation for 0.25 c/deg. adapter and target stimuli at 15 Hz (60 deg./s). This\nincreased the after-effect of adaptation a little for this observer (from 2.2 dB at 0.5 c/deg.\nNonoriented filters are monocular and adaptable 177\nbut still not achieving the higher levels found by Kelly and Burbeck. Furthermore, our main\nspatio-temporal conditions were comparable to some of those used by Kelly and Burbeck,\nso the question of why their effects were larger remains. Kelly and Burbeck used a slightly\nhigher contrast adapter than us (95% versus 80%), a higher mean luminance (90cd/m2\nversus 16cd/m2), and drifting adapters rather than our jittering adapters. Another factor\nis that the method used for monocular stimulation might be important. We used shutter\ngoggles to present uniform mean luminance to the irrelevant eye. Unfortunately, Kelly and\nBurbeck (1987) do not report how they achieved monocularity, though an occluder is a\nlikely possibility. It is also possible that the difference owes to the criterion sensitive (yes/no)\nmethods used by Kelly and Burbeck (1987) compared with the criterion free 2IFC method\nused here.\nAnother factor relates to the method used for measuring the baselines for contrast\ndetection thresholds. Previous studies have adopted two different approaches. In one (eg,\nBaker et al 2007) the baseline blocks of trials are identical to the experimental blocks, except\nthat the adapter contrast is set to 0% (ie, observers adapt to a blank screen). This has the\nbenefit of using consistent experimental protocols across the measures being compared\nbut means that the baseline involves adaptation to mean luminance. This is a questionable\ncomparison, since the visual system is normally `adapted' to the natural images encountered\nin the real world (Elliot et al 2011). In the other approach (eg, Langley and Bex 2007) the\nadaptation periods (both pre and top-up) are removed from the experimental sequence.\nThis avoids the artificial process of blank adaptation but has the disadvantage that the\nexperimental sequence is not identical for the baseline and experimental measures that are\nto be compared. We used the second of these methods here, but it is not clear which method\nKelly and Burbeck (1987) used. To check whether the method might be important, we ran a\ncontrol experiment to compare baselines measured each way. For DHB and SB and a fast\nstimulus (0.5 c/deg., 15 Hz flicker) the baselines were 1.9 dB and 2.2 dB lower, respectively,\nwhen blank adaptation was used (typical standard error was 0.27 dB and 0.85 dB for DHB\nand SB, respectively). For the slow stimulus (2 c/deg, 2 Hz flicker) the effects were smaller\n(average difference of 0.5 dB) and in opposite directions for the two observers. Thus, a case\ncould be made that we have underestimated the magnitude of the adaptation after-effects\nin our fast conditions by about 2 dB. Fortunately, this does not change any of our main\nconclusions or the model architecture that we propose in figure 6.\nWhether any one or some combination of the factors above is responsible for the different\nlevels of cross-orientation adaptation reported across studies remains unclear.\n4.4 Further considerations\n4.4.1 Cascading stages of adaptation and spatial selectivity. One feature of our model is the\ncascading stages of adaptation (levels 1 and 2 in figure 6a). We note that similar cascades\nhave been suggested before (Georgeson and Schofield 2002; Shady et al 2004; Langley and\nBex 2007). For example, Georgeson and Schofield (2002) used the tilt after-effect to reveal a\ncascade of orientation tuned stages (beyond the scope of the present study), whereas Langley\nand Bex (2007) identified an initial adaptable transient stage followed by a parallel pair of\nadaptable temporal channels. Whether our stage 1 filter is related to the initial temporal\nfilter of Langley and Bex (2007) is not clear and would require a better understanding of the\nspatial selectivity of the filters in each case. For example, we have represented our initial\nstage (level 1) with a familiar icon for a spatially opponent receptive field (figure 6). However,\n(6)Facilitation from a dichoptic adapter (co-oriented and cross-oriented) was also confirmed for the\n0.25 c/deg. adapter and target.\nthere is nothing in our data to demand that our level 1 filter is pattern selective (as we discuss\nfurther in the next section). It could be that its primary function is that of temporal selectivity.\n4.4.2 Generalization of spatio-temporal conditions. The study here has concentrated on the\nhigh-speed corner of achromatic spatio-temporal vision. Burbeck and Kelly (1981), Meese\nand Holmes (2007), and Meese and Baker (2009) surveyed the entire spatio-temporal space\nusing a cross-orientation masking paradigm for binocular, monocular, and dichoptic masks\nand targets. No similarly extensive study has been performed for adaptation or summation\nusing criterion free methods, but the yes/no adaptation study of Kelly and Burbeck (1987)\ncovered a substantial spatio-temporal region. In sum, it is possible that our results and\nconclusions from the 2 c/deg., 2 Hz Gabor stimuli do not generalize to the entire achromatic\nspace outside the high-speed corner. Nonetheless, we are aware of no results to suggest that\nthey might not, and the Kelly and Burbeck study suggests that they do, at least for adaptation.\n4.4.3 Chromaticity versus achromaticity. In stark contrast to above, we do not generalize our\nconclusions (figure 1a and figure 6) to chromatic spatio-temporal space. In a preliminary\nreport Mullen et al (2010) used the summation paradigm to reveal nonoriented chromatic\n(red/green) mechanisms--but not achromatic mechanisms--at low spatial frequency and\nlow temporal frequency. Like their achromatic counterparts here, these mechanisms ap-\npeared to be strictly monocular. Intriguingly, the nonoriented monocularity is consistent\nwith single-cell recordings in layer 4C and layer 4C of primary visual cortex (Hubel\nstudies, respectively. The implication is that these cells not only provide convergent inputs to\norientation-tuned filters (Mooser et al 2004), but their outputs (or similar) are also available\nto the observer for decision making.\n4.4.4 Our conclusions derive from the simplest model arrangement. Our model in figure 6\nis the simplest one we could devise to account for the majority of our data. As always,\nmore complex models might be derived that can also account for the results, and these\nmight change our interpretations and conclusions. For example, our claim that observers\nare able to access the outputs of a monocular stage of processing (for the high-speed\nstimuli) follows from the diminution of cross-orientation summation when the components\nwere presented to different eyes (experiment 3b). However, another possibility is that this\narises from interocular suppression across orientation between the targets in the different\neyes. Indeed, we have proposed such pathways to account for the minor adaptation after-\neffects of dichoptic cross-orientation facilitation that we observed, attributing that effect to\ndisinhibition. However, the problem here is to devise a model in which cross-orientation\nsuppression could arise from components that are themselves only at threshold. Indeed,\nstudies where the relevant masking measures have been made (eg, Baker et al 2007; Meese\nand Baker 2009) suggest that suppression is not found until the mask component is above its\nown detection threshold.\n4.4.5 Further considerations. Notwithstanding our comments above, our conclusions regard-\ning perceptual access to an adaptable isotropic mechanism might require some elaboration.\nUsing uniform flicker (ie, no spatial pattern) as adapt and test patterns, Shady et al (2004)\nreport that flicker frequencies that are too high to be seen can serve as effective adapters.\nMeier and Carandini (2002) found a similar result for cross-orientation masking. In other\nwords, each of these studies points to what is presumably an isotropic mechanism that can\ninfluence visual perception but for which the observer cannot access the output. These\nresults can be reconciled with our account if a low pass temporal frequency filter (Langley\nand Bex 2007) were inserted between our level 1 filter and the output to the decision variable.\nNonoriented filters are monocular and adaptable 179\nAs it seems likely that this is subcortical [eg, see Meier and Carandini (2002) for a brief review],\nthis temporal filtering is presumably positioned before binocular convergence in our scheme.\nOur criterion-free psychophysical experiments confirm earlier findings of Kelly and\nBurbeck (Burbeck and Kelly 1981; Kelly and Burbeck 1987): cross-orientation interactions\ncan be found in the high-speed corner of spatio-temporal vision but are diminished or absent\nelsewhere. However, Kelly and Burbeck attributed the results from all three paradigms (mask-\ning, adaptation, and summation) to a common explanation: that the detecting mechanisms\nare isotropic. In the light of a greater number of experimental conditions and analyses, we\ninterpret these results rather differently, arguing that only the summation paradigm reveals\nnonoriented detecting mechanisms directly. Adaptation possibly reveals adaptable isotropic\nsubunits of oriented filters, and masking reveals cross-orientation interactions from either\noriented or isotropic mechanisms onto oriented detectors. We also conclude that the high-\nspeed corner of spatio-temporal vision contains both oriented and nonoriented filters, but\nthat the nonoriented variety is strictly monocular (figure 1c). We have argued that 16 of the 18\npsychophysical effects reported here are consistent with a simple model of these processes\ninvolving only five design decisions and some simple elaborations. One further effect and\ntwo other relevant results in the literature are easily accommodated with simple extensions\nto our model. A notable property of our model (figure 6) is that if a filter is available for\ndecision making, it is also adaptable.\n"
