Although EP has yielded many theoretical\nadvances and empirical discoveries, it has provoked resistance from some scholars in the\nsocial sciences (Confer et al., 2010; Laland and Brown, 2011). This resistance is especially\nevident when EP is applied to sex and gender differences, but this application is an\ninevitable extension of powerful theories that were developed by evolutionary biologists\n(Vandermassen, 2005). Darwin (1871), for example, initially proposed the theory of sexual\nselection to explain a persistent pattern of sex differences that he and others observed\nacross the animal kingdom. Sexual selection has since been elaborated and shown to be\nvital for understanding sex differences in many species, including humans (Andersson,\nMisrepresentations of evolutionary psychology\nDespite success in explaining cognitive, behavioral, and morphological sex\ndifferences in many species, evolutionary theory remains controversial when applied to\nhumans and continues to provoke hostility (Geher and Gambacorta, 2010; Segrest\u00e5le, 2000;\nVandermassen, 2005). Because this controversy has been broadcast to the public in often\nsensationalist accounts, it might appear more vitriolic than it really is (Kurzban, 2010). The\npreponderance of complaints and attacks on EP come from scholars outside of the field and\nare frequently based on misunderstandings of evolution itself or how it is applied to\nhumans (Vandermassen, 2005). Concerned scholars have attempted to correct these\nmisunderstandings and simplistic media portrayals and to build bridges with scholars from\nother disciplines (e.g., Buss and Schmitt, 2011; Confer et al., 2010). However, many of\nthese corrections and clarifications are published in academic journals that are read by few\nundergraduates. By contrast, textbooks are a crucial component of an undergraduate`s\neducation and are an important conduit of the ideas and data that comprise a paradigm of\nresearch (Griggs, Jackson, Christopher, and Marek, 1999). Previous research indicates that\ntextbook accounts of EP are frequently inaccurate (see Previous Textbook Studies section\nfor references), and there apparently has been little effort devoted to improving textbook\naccuracy.\nIn this article, we assess the presentation of EP in 15 textbooks on sex and gender.\nWe focus on sex and gender textbooks for three reasons. First, as explained above,\nevolutionary theory is well suited to contribute to the understanding of sex differences and\nsimilarities (Geary, 2010). Second, many sex and gender studies scholars appear skeptical\nabout the merits of EP (Buss and Schmitt, 2011; Vandermassen, 2005). Third, to our\nknowledge, researchers have not examined the accuracy of sex and gender textbook\npresentations of EP. Before presenting our coding methodology and results, we briefly\ninvestigate potential reasons for mistrust and hostility toward EP among sex and gender\nstudies scholars and review previous presentations of evolutionary psychology in\ntextbooks.\nReasons for Mistrust and Lack of Acceptance\nThe idea that human nature--including differences between the sexes--is\nbiologically influenced was once relatively standard, indeed, taken for granted by most\nsocial scientists (Degler, 1991). In the early 1900`s, however, a number of scholars,\ninfluenced by the incipient disciplines of cultural anthropology and behaviorism, began to\nquestion this assumption. The gradual revelation of the crimes committed by the Nazis\nalarmed the public and academics alike and further promoted concerns about the social and\npolitical implications of biological approaches to human nature (Laland and Brown, 2011).\nThese concerns and skepticism have persisted, to some degree, as protection against what\nsome scholars view as an attempt to justify inequitable social policies and institutions\n(Lopreato and Crippen, 1999; Lord and Sanderson, 1999). That is, biologically based views\nof human nature are, within certain academic communities, seen as a form of apologetics\nfor an unjust social system and for myriad other social evils (e.g., sexism, racism,\nclassism). This seems especially true for broadly liberal disciplines that aspire actively to\nameliorate social suffering (Geher and Gambacorta, 2010).\nMisrepresentations of evolutionary psychology\nHowever, recent research has shown that, despite popular assumptions, liberalism\ndoes not predict a rejection of applying evolutionary theory to humans (Perry and Mace,\n2010). Furthermore, from the imperfect data we possess, EPs appear no more likely to\nadhere to conservative political beliefs than other social scientists (Tybur, Miller, and\nGangestad, 2007). Therefore, political ideology, although a probable source of some\nhostility toward EP, is not a powerful predictor of a scholar`s willingness to apply EP to\nhuman behavior.\nEvidence indicates that, in fact, a misunderstanding of the basic principles of EP is a\nmore powerful predictor of hostility toward it than is political ideology (Perry and Mace,\n2010). A student, for example, who is taught that EP ignores the importance of culture\nmight understandably develop a skeptical, perhaps even hostile, attitude toward EP. A\nsimilar problem led to hostility toward behaviorism, especially as propounded by B.F.\nSkinner. Students were taught that Skinner eschewed instincts altogether and that he\ncompletely ignored internal processes (Jensen and Burgess, 1997). Instincts and internal\nprocesses quite clearly exist, so this led to dismissals of Skinner and accusations that his\nframework was entirely wrong (in fact, embarrassingly so). These errors were included in\ntextbooks and propagated to the next generation of students, who continued to reject\nSkinnerism (DeBell and Harless, 1992). We suggest that a similar process involving sex\nand gender textbooks may explain some of the hostility toward EP. Thus, a combination of\nliberal ideology and broad misunderstanding of the content of EP may combine to lead sex\nand gender scholars to view EP as a conservative and wrongheaded approach to explaining\nhuman sex differences.\nAs a first step in testing our hypothesis that a cycle of ignorance contributes to the\nhostility directed toward EP, we coded its presentation in sex and gender textbooks. We\npredict that presentations of EP will be frequently inaccurate.\nIt is important to note that sex and gender scholars and sociologists probably hold a\nmore negative view of EP and have more misconceptions than scholars in many areas of\npsychology (e.g., cognitive scientists, developmentalists, neuroscientists, linguists, etc.)\npsychologists who do not identify as EPs have fully integrated the Darwinian revolution\ninto their research and possess an acute knowledge of evolution and natural and sexual\nselection.\nPrevious Textbook Studies\nTo our knowledge, five previous studies have examined presentations of EP in\nundergraduate textbooks. All found that EP presentations were flawed, inaccurate, or, more\nrarely, hostile. Cornwell, Palmer, Guinther, and Davis (2005) reported that almost 80% of\nroughly 30% were negative toward EP. Martin and Machaleck (2006) found that 69% of\nintroductory sociology textbooks covered EP in any way, and the ones that did frequently\ncontained errors. Some of the most common errors were claims that EPs adhere to genetic\ndeterminism or biological reductionism. Park (2007) studied 10 social psychology\ntextbooks and found that all contained at least one mistaken representation of kin selection,\nMisrepresentations of evolutionary psychology\na foundational theory for evolutionary approaches to cooperation. Chrisler and Erchull\n(2011) examined 16 social psychology textbooks and found that none presented EP\nuncritically, concluding that, The most common critique of evolutionary theory seems to\nbe to tell students that cognition and culture can override biological tendencies or that\nculture restrains or limits biological tendencies (p. 756). Last, Leahy (2012) found that\nsociology textbooks tend to reject explicit theories of human nature, including EP, as\nbiological and therefore incompatible with the plasticity of human behavior.\nOur study extends these previous ones in several ways. First, our study focuses\nexclusively on sex and gender textbooks. Second, we present a well-defined and explicit\ncatalog of errors pertaining to the presentation of evolutionary theory; previous studies\ngenerally did not define the errors they were coding (but see Park, 2007). Third, we provide\nfull documentation for every error we coded so that our procedure and claims are fully\ntransparent.\nMaterials and Methods\nSelecting textbooks\nWe began identifying social science textbooks that focus on sex and/or gender by\ncontacting Monument Information Resource (MIR), a company that compiles information\non undergraduate textbook usage in the United States. MIR provided us with separate\ndatabases for a sample of psychology (n = 1,200) and sociology (n = 1,484) courses taught\nin the U.S. during 2007 with titles similar to Sex and Gender, Women`s Studies, and\nHuman Sexuality.1 For each course, information was provided on the institution where\nthe course was taught, the course title, the instructor, the expected enrollment, and any\nrequired or recommended books. For both psychology and sociology databases, we sorted\nthe books by title and used online resources, such as reviews and publisher`s descriptions,\nto initially identify introductory textbooks to sex and gender that were broad in scope,\nincluding discussions of both social and biological factors that influence gender-\ndifferentiated behavior. We excluded textbooks published prior to 2005, edited volumes,\nencyclopedias, readers or article compilations, specialized academic books (e.g., on sexual\nviolence, human sexuality, gender and aging, gender and religiosity, gender and math,\ngender and labor markets, gender and group processes), and non-academic books (e.g.,\nthose marketed toward parents or lay audiences). These categories of books were excluded\nto 1) keep our sample manageable and 2) because undergraduate textbooks form the core of\nmost undergraduate classes (Griggs et al., 1999) and, therefore, are most informative in\ngauging the mainstream view of the discipline. In cases where it was unclear if a book was\nappropriate, we obtained it and collectively made a judgment.\nMIR used Human Sexuality as a key research term when providing data about classes on sex and gender\nand textbook usage. However, we were interested in introductory textbooks on sex and gender and thus\nexcluded specialized textbooks on human sexuality. Some courses with course titles similar to Human\nSexuality served as introductory courses to sex and gender in general whereas others were more specialized.\nMisrepresentations of evolutionary psychology\nWe obtained the 15 textbooks (six sociology; nine psychology) that were used in\nmore than one course in the MIR database and met our criteria for inclusion. At least one of\nwidely used book was used in 326 courses (22%), and the least widely was used in 15\ncourses (1%). At least one of these nine psychology textbooks was used in 552 of 1,200\npsychology courses (46%); the most widely used book was used in 124 courses (10%), and\nthe least widely was used in 21 courses (2%). See references for the number of courses that\nused each textbook.\nIdentifying relevant pages\nTo find the pages in the textbooks that covered EP, we searched the index for three\nkey phrases (evolutionary theory, evolutionary psychology, and sociobiology). We summed\nthe pages and checked each page thoroughly for the errors listed in our catalog.\nDeveloping the error catalog\nWe identified types of errors by reading previous textbook analyses, evolutionary\npsychology textbooks, and introductory sex and gender textbooks. We identified eight\nmajor types of errors, each of which is discussed in the catalog below. We note our error\ncatalog, like any other, is somewhat arbitrary. However, the errors listed in our catalog\nwere selected because EPs themselves have addressed them, sometimes repeatedly. We\nalso note that the Straw Man category is something of a catch all category which includes\nBiological Determinism, Naturalistic Fallacy, Political Agenda, and the Intentionalistic\nFallacy. That said, there were several egregious misrepresentations that simply did not fit in\nthese categories and we felt these deserved to be made explicit and rebutted. Therefore, our\nStraw Man (not otherwise specified) category includes straw man arguments that are not\ncaptured by the other error types. The Appendix also corrects a few errors that were not\nformally coded for analysis. We encourage other scholars to code textbooks using different\nor expanded error catalogs.\nIdentifying errors\nThe first author initially coded errors by occurrence and type. He then directed the\nsecond author to each passage containing an apparent error, and the second author\nindependently classified it according to error type. They agreed in 87% of cases (Cohen`s \n= .85), and disagreements were resolved by discussion.\nThe error catalog\nBelow is a list of the eight types of errors we coded with an explanation, rebuttal,\nand textbook example of each. E#) denotes the type of error and R#) provides a rebuttal of\nthe error. Note that four of these errors--Biological Determinism, Naturalistic Fallacy,\nPolitical Agenda, and Intentionalistic Fallacy--are ones that EPs are accused of making,\nwhereas the others are made in the explication of evolutionary theory and its application to\nhumans.\nE1) Lack of Evidence/Lack of Falsifiability. The assertion that many or all claims by EPs\nMisrepresentations of evolutionary psychology\n(1) lack substantive confirmatory evidence and/or (2) are unfalsifiable.\nR1) (1) Evidence supports many claims made by EPs. Buss, Haselton, Shackelford, Bleske,\nand Wakefield (1998, Table 1) summarized 30 empirical discoveries about human nature\ngenerated by explicit evolutionary theorizing, including mother-fetus conflict and\nlandscape preference. More recently, Buss and Schmitt (2011, Table 1) summarized 17\nrobust empirical findings regarding sex differences in desire for sexual variety. Many more\nempirical findings are reviewed in introductory evolutionary psychology textbooks (e.g.,\nare falsifiable. Buss`s introductory textbook (1999) presented 11 methods and data sources\nfor testing evolutionary hypotheses (p. 54) and concluded that at least two of the methods\nmust support a hypothesis for it to have a firm empirical foundation (p. 65). Ketelaar and\nEllis (2000) devoted a full article to falsifiability and demonstrated that the charge that EP\nclaims are generally unfalsifiable is unwarranted. Last, Schmitt and Pilcher (2004) laid out\na rigorous program for testing evolutionary based hypotheses, and this emphasized the\nimportance of generating and testing empirical predictions.\nTextbook Example: Sociobiology has some success in applying evolutionary theory to\nanimal behavior, but because it is virtually impossible to test the natural selection principles\non which it is based, empirical support for evolutionary links to human behavior is weak.\nE2) Biological Determinism/Dichotomy between Nature & Nurture. (1) The assertion\nthat EPs contend that biology determines or can explain all human behavior. (2) The\nassertion that some phenomena are entirely cultural whereas others are entirely biological.\nR2) (1) EPs do not contend that human nature is hardwired by genes or determined\nexclusively by biology. In fact, introductory evolutionary psychology textbooks warn\nabout deterministic views of human nature (e.g., Buss, 2008; Gaulin and McBurney, 2004).\nFor example, Rossano (2003) states, Evolutionary psychologists firmly reject both genetic\ndeterminism and environmental determinism and, instead, contend that both genes and\nenvironment must be considered in understanding the human mind (p. 28). (2) EPs believe\nthat understanding human nature requires an interactionist framework; i.e., incorporating\nboth biology and culture. As Tooby and Cosmides (1992) point out:\nEvolution shapes the relationship between the genes and the environment such that\nthey both participate in a coordinated way in the construction and calibration of\nadaptations. Thus, evolutionarily patterned structure is coming in from the\nenvironment, just as much as it is coming out from the genes. (p. 86)\nIn short, nature and nurture are inseparable in the EP account.\nTextbook Example: What`s more, if these [biological] explanations are true, no amount\nof political initiative, no amount of social spending, no great policy upheavals will change\nthe relationships between women and men (Kimmel, 2013, p. 22).\nMisrepresentations of evolutionary psychology\nE3) Naturalistic Fallacy. The assertion that EPs contend that what exists is either ipso\nfacto good or morally desirable simply because it exists.\nR3) The accusation that EPs are guilty of the naturalistic fallacy is belied by numerous\nwritings from early sociobiologists (e.g., Alexander, 1979; Symons, 1979) and more\nrecently from evolutionary psychologists. In The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins (1976)\nwrites, I am not advocating a morality based on evolution. I am saying how things have\nevolved. I am not saying how we humans morally ought to behave (pp. 2-3). Many\nintroductory textbooks on evolutionary psychology contain explicit warnings about\nTextbook Example: Biological arguments reassure us that what is is what should be, that\nthe social is natural. Finally, such reassurances tell us that these existing inequalities are not\nour fault, that no one is to blame, really (Kimmel, 2013, p. 22).\nE4) Political/Ideological Agenda/Consequentialist Fallacy. (1) The assertion that EPs\nhave a conservative, rightwing political agenda and that this agenda significantly influences\ntheir research. (2) The assertion that evolutionary accounts are morally dubious and\npossibly dangerous if widely disseminated.\nR4) (1) To the extent that we have empirical data on the political views of EPs, this\nassertion appears to be false. Most of the early sociobiologists were liberals or social\ndemocrats (including E.O. Wilson and Richard Dawkins), while Robert Trivers, who\ndeveloped the theory of parental investment, was a political radical who coauthored a paper\nwith Huey Newton (Segrest\u00e5le, 2000; Trivers, 2002). A recent study of EPs found that their\npolitical views match those of social scientists in general--0 of 31 EPs identified with the\nRepublican Party (Tybur et al., 2007). Even if it were true that EPs have more conservative\nviews than other social scientists, it would not automatically follow that they are more\nlikely than others to use their scholarship to advance a conservative agenda. We know of no\ndata addressing this possibility, and the textbooks making this assertion do not provide any\nevidence for it. (2) Unfortunately, almost any view of human nature can be used to justify\nself-serving behavior that harms other people, ranging from the extremes of Nazism on the\nright to communism on the left (Pinker, 2002). The communists, for example, perpetrated\nnumerous ghastly crimes, which were justified by a singular commitment to human\nflexibility, environmental determinism, and equality (Pipes, 2001). However, the factual\ncontent of a theory or proposition is not determined by the perceived good or ill it may do\nto society.\nTextbook Example: Another concern is the claim that gender differences have evolved\nover time, which implies that gender differences are inevitable and unchangeable. Biology\nthen becomes an excuse for accepting differences and not advocating for social change\nMisrepresentations of evolutionary psychology\nE5) Species Selection. The assertion that evolution via natural and sexual selection\noperates to ensure species survival or that the survival of the species is the goal of\nevolution.\nthe individual, not the species. In the 1960s, evolutionary biologists revolutionized the field\nby formalizing the insight that it was not the individual but the gene that was the\nfundamental unit of selection (Dawkins, 1976; Hamilton, 1964a,b). Although there is\ndebate about the importance of differing units or levels of selection (e.g., group, individual,\ngene; Wilson and Wilson, 2007), biologists are nearly unanimous that species level\nselection does not occur:\nIn the early post-Darwinian period when thinking about selection was rather\nconfused, it was often said that such and such a character had evolved because it\nwas good for the species. This is quite misleading. The selected character had\noriginated because it benefited certain individuals of a species and had gradually\nspread to all others. The species as an entity does not answer to selection. (Mayr,\nTextbook Example: Evolutionary theory argues that in any species, including humans,\ncertain characteristics persist across generations--passed along genetically--because they\nE6) Straw Man Argument (Not Otherwise Specified). A misrepresentation of the\nopponent`s position which creates the illusion that the argument in question has been\nrefuted when, in fact, the actual position of the opponent has not been addressed.\nR6) Straw Man arguments must be examined case by case but often involve\noversimplifying the arguments of EPs to make them appear careless or reductionist. For\nexample, many critics of EP assert that the theory posits that all men are promiscuous\nwhen, to our knowledge, this is not a serious position of EPs.\nTextbook Example: Because each Straw Man argument is somewhat unique, aside from\nthose that fall into specified errors we have already cataloged, each requires its own\nexplanation (see Appendix for detailed comments on each coded Straw Man error).\nE7) Intentionalistic Fallacy. The assertion that EPs contend that humans intentionally\nattempt to enhance their inclusive fitness and are explicitly aware of such intentions. For\nexample, the claim that using contraception and engaging in sex for the sake of pleasure\nrather than reproduction refutes evolutionary arguments regarding natural and sexual\nselection.\nR7) EPs do not believe that humans are consciously aware of the evolutionary logic of\ntheir behavior. E.O. Wilson, the founder of sociobiology, made the point that the brain has\nMisrepresentations of evolutionary psychology\nbeen programmed to perform as if it knows [emphasis added] the underlying evolutionary\nlogic of its affective biases (Wilson, 1975, p. 4). Similarly, John Tooby and Leda Cosmides\n(1992), two of the founders of evolutionary psychology, state ...the biological concept of\nfunctionality differs from the folk notion of functionality as goal-seeking behavior.\nAlthough some of our evolved psychological mechanisms probably operate through goal-\nseeking, surely none of them has fitness maximization as a mentally represented goal (p.\n54). Even in cases where humans explicitly represent goals (e.g., I need to protect my child;\nI would like to have sex), EPs do not posit that they are aware of the evolutionary logic\nguiding the specific goal in question (see for example, Buss, 1999; Geary, 2005).\nTextbook Example: The sociobiological view of sex differences assumes that sexual\nintercourse will lead \u00ad or is intended to lead \u00ad to reproduction. Today, I doubt that the\nmajority of men are thinking about establishing paternity and the majority of women are\nthinking about their partners` ability to support a child when deciding whether or not to\nE8) Mechanical Demonstration. The assertion that if a scholar lacks knowledge of the\nspecific proximate mechanism(s) contributing to a behavior, then that scholar is unable to\nlegitimately make any claims about the evolutionary function of the behavior. For example,\nthe claim that sex differences in cognition cannot have an evolutionary basis because the\nprecise genes, neurotransmitters, and evolutionary pressures giving rise to them are not\nperfectly understood.\nR8) It is, of course, desirable to have perfect knowledge of all of the physiological, genetic,\nand historical components of a hypothesized adaptation, but this is not necessary to make\ninformed hypotheses about human adaptations. George Williams (1966) developed\nrigorous criteria for evaluating adaptations (reliability, efficiency, and economy) and these\ncriteria can be used for evaluating evident design features of humans (e.g., the eye,\nopposable thumbs, fever) without knowing the precise physiological basis of the adaptation\nin question (see also Buss, 1999; Tooby and Cosmides, 1992). We also note that scholars\nusing non-evolutionary perspectives routinely and fruitfully advance hypotheses about the\ncauses of behavior without providing a comprehensive account of all mechanisms involved\nin the causal pathway.\nTextbook Example: Evolutionary psychologists fail to specify the biological mechanisms\nfrom evolution to behavior. Their basic arguments are that evolution occurred over millions\nof years and, voila, we have a certain pattern of gender differences in the 21st century. But\nevolution can act only through genes, and genes influence behavior because they direct the\nsynthesis of certain proteins and not others, leading to differing levels of biochemicals\nsuch as neurotransmitters or hormones. This is the era of the Human Genome Project, in\nwhich specific genes that create specific medical conditions and behaviors are being\nidentified. Evolutionary psychology has failed to incorporate this work, and fails to specify\nwhich genes and biochemicals are responsible for the patterns of gender differences that\nMisrepresentations of evolutionary psychology\nTable 1.

Of the\n12 remaining textbooks, all contained at least one error (see Table 1 and Fig. 1; see\nAppendix for complete documentation of every coded error). The mean number of errors\nper book was 5.75 (SD = 3.81) and the median was 5; this statistic allows that a book may\ncommit an error type more than once. Across books, the mean number of error types was\n3.75 (SD = 1.86) and the median was 3.5. Not surprisingly, there was a strong correlation\nbetween the number of pages devoted to discussing EP and total errors, r = .73.\nThe Straw Man error was the most frequent, occurring 17 times in nine textbooks.\nBecause this category of error is the most open-ended, the result is not surprising. The\nBiological Determinism/Dichotomy between Nature and Nurture error was the second most\nfrequent (14 times in nine textbooks). The Naturalistic Fallacy and Intentionalistic Fallacy\nMisrepresentations of evolutionary psychology\nerrors were the least frequent, occurring four times in three textbooks and four times in four\ntextbooks, respectively. Psychology undergraduate textbooks devoted more pages to EP (M\ncontained more types and more overall errors than did psychology textbooks (see Table 2).\nWe note that the sample size was extremely small so these results should be treated with\ndue caution.\nDiscussion\nOur study improves upon previous studies by furnishing a well-defined catalog of\nerrors in the presentation of EP and demonstrating that these errors occur frequently in\nundergraduate sex and gender textbooks. EPs have frequently addressed these errors (Buss,\nefforts, errors persist.\nAlthough these results are discouraging, they are also encouraging because the\nfactual errors can be corrected and future textbook writers, equipped with a more accurate\nunderstanding of evolutionary theory, can produce balanced (but critical) textbooks. EP\nshould be exposed to rigorous criticism and debate; however, that cannot happen if\nresearchers are not well-informed. There are well-informed criticisms of EP`s analysis of\nsex differences, and these can lead to a more comprehensive and flexible theory. For\nexample, Wood and Eagly (2012) have published widely cited criticisms of a biologically-\nbased analysis of the origins of human sex differences. Scholars debate their conclusions,\nbut they can serve as catalysts for future research and clarification of hypotheses (see also\nA possible concern with the current study is the accuracy of our error catalog.\nPerhaps, for example, EPs do espouse a form of biological determinism (E2), a common\nattribution of the textbooks (see Results), despite explicitly arguing that evolutionary theory\ndoes not entail such determinism. To some degree, this will depend upon perspective. A\nresearcher who believes that biology plays no role in causing sex and gender differences\nwill view any suggestion otherwise as redolent of biological determinism. What is\nimportant, however, are not the specifics of this debate, but rather whether EP is accurately\nrepresented in textbooks. The passages in sex and gender textbooks that we coded as errors\nare contradicted by quotes from EP textbooks, which consistently urge researchers to avoid\nmaking the four fallacies attributed to evolutionary psychologists (see EP textbooks in\nreferences). Furthermore, these passages are contradicted by numerous peer-reviewed\narticles (see EP textbooks for references).\nThe evidence for all errors is provided in the Appendix, and researchers can\nevaluate these themselves. Some might argue that specific EPs do make the errors imputed\nto them by the textbooks we coded. However, our contention is that mainstream EP as a\nfield does not commit these errors and should not be judged nor characterized by the\nwritings or assertions of one or two unorthodox scholars. Moreover, in making these claims\n(EPs generally espouse Biological Determinism), the textbooks invariably failed to\nprovide a single case of an EP making the error.\nWe anticipate a few more concerns, some of which represent limitations of the\nMisrepresentations of evolutionary psychology\npresent research and some of which underscore the need for further research. First, we did\nnot apply our catalog of errors to textbooks that were not focused on sex and gender. This\nshould be done because general introductory textbooks reach a wider audience than sex and\ngender textbooks.\nSecond, sex and gender researchers from a more social constructionist perspective\nmay argue that EP textbooks and articles similarly mischaracterize their theories and\narguments. If true, we welcome careful documentation of this problem, because this can\nlead to increased understanding. Nevertheless, this does not mitigate or excuse the shoddy\ntreatment of EP documented here.\nLast, we simply demonstrated that textbooks frequently make errors; we did not\nestablish that such errors are perpetuated or have an impact on students. It is, however,\nreasonable to posit that students are exposed to these errors (from reading textbooks,\nlistening to lectures, or both) and that such exposure influences student attitudes about EP,\nas we hypothesized. More research is necessary to demonstrate causal links between\ntextbook errors and student knowledge and attitudes. A clear prediction from the current\nresearch is that students will be more hostile toward EP after taking sex and gender classes\nand that the hostility of the used textbook will moderate this effect.\nOn a practical level, we suggest several recommendations to improve the quality of\ntextbooks. First, sex and gender textbook writers could communicate with EPs and send\nthem preliminary versions of their chapters. Second, EPs could write their own textbooks.\nThis would certainly increase the accuracy of the presentation of EP. However, it may\ncreate its own problems and may provoke suspicion in an unsympathetic audience. Perhaps\nthe best solution would be to encourage more collaboration between EPs and researchers\nwho operate from different theoretical perspectives. This would allow both perspectives\nfull and honest expression and would allay the concerns of skeptical researchers who might\nanticipate ideological distortions from authors who belonged to one theoretical camp or\nanother.\n"
