Only one population-based\nstudy has examined the relationship between emotional abuse and migraine. None have investigated the temporal relation-\nship between onset of abuse and of migraine.\nMethods.--We analyzed data from 14,356 adults aged 24\u00ad32 years in Wave 4, which is a cross-sectional subset of the\nlongitudinal Add Health study. Participants were queried regarding abuse (emotional, physical and sexual) during child-\nhood, diagnosis of migraine, depression and anxiety by healthcare providers, and symptoms of current depression. We used\nlogistic regression to estimate the association between childhood abuse and migraine, controlling for socio-demographic\nfactors, current depression, and lifetime diagnosis of anxiety and depression.\nResults.--About 14% (n 5 2040) of respondents reported migraine. Participants with migraine (vs no migraine)\nreported significantly higher rates of childhood abuse overall (60.6% vs 48.9%), including emotional (57.8% vs 45.4%), sex-\nual (8.4% vs 4.6%) and physical (22.4% vs 17.9%) abuse. Emotional abuse had a stronger association with migraine (odds\nsexual abuse (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.93\u00ad1.68), adjusting for socio-demographic factors. The emotional abuse-migraine associa-\ntion remained even when controlling for lifetime diagnosis of depression and anxiety (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.19\u00ad1.57) and for\ncurrent depression (OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.30\u00ad1.67). The odds of migraine increased with increasing number of abuse types\nreported. There was a U-shaped distribution of odds of migraine associated with frequency of occurrences of emotional\nConclusions.--Emotional abuse during childhood contributed more than physical or sexual abuse to the development of\nmigraine. There is a dose\u00adresponse relationship with increasing number of abuse types associated with rising odds of migraine.\nIn addition, the relationship between the frequency of emotional abuse and the odds of migraine follows a U-shape pattern.\nKey words: migraine, emotional abuse, childhood abuse, depression, anxiety\nAbbreviations: ACE adverse childhood experiences, Add Health National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health,\nAMPP American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention, CCHS-MH Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental\nHealth, CES-D Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, CI confidence interval, CTQ Childhood Trau-\nma Questionnaire, ICHD2 The International Classification of Headache Disorders 2nd Edition, OR odds ratio\nFrom the Department of Neurology, University of Toledo, Toledo, OH, USA (G.E.

Another limitation is the potential for\nrecall bias with retrospective querying about child-\nhood experiences in adults samples with mean ages\nInformation Table S1).\nIn the HMO-based Adverse Childhood Experi-\nences (ACE) study6 emotional abuse was more\ntightly linked with frequent headache, not specifi-\ncally migraine, than either physical or sexual\nabuse.6 The influence of other abuse types and of\ndepression and anxiety on the emotional abuse-\nmigraine relationship was not explored. The Ameri-\ncan Migraine Prevalence and Prevention (AMPP)\nstudy,5 using criteria from the International Classifi-\ncation of Headache Disorders-217 to characterize\nheadache and modules from the Childhood Trauma\nQuestionnaire18 to classify abuse, found a relation-\nship of emotional abuse and migraine, which was\nindependent of depression and anxiety. This was\nnot the case for sexual abuse; physical abuse was\nnot investigated. Although the sample was from a\nnationally representative population it only\nincluded persons with migraine (85%) and tension-\ntype headache, which served as the control group.\nThe population-based Canadian Community Health\nSurvey-Mental Health (CCHS-MH), controlling for\nother abuse types, depression and anxiety, demon-\nstrated an independent association of physical\nabuse, sexual abuse, and witnessing abuse with self-\nreported provider-diagnosed (SRPD) migraine in\nboth men and in women. The survey did not\ninclude questions on emotional abuse.7 None of\nthese three studies examined differences in the\nmigraine-abuse relationship stratified by race. The\nnumber of abuse types positively influenced the\nodds of migraine diagnosis in the AMPP and\nCCHS-MH, and of frequent headache in the ACE\nstudy, but the relationship of migraine and abuse\noccurrence frequency, another component of severi-\nty, has not been examined.5\u00ad7 A remaining knowl-\nedge gap is of the chronology of onset of abuse and\nof migraine, vital information as we develop\nhypotheses of mechanistic links.\nOur objective was to examine data from the\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult\nHealth (Add Health),19 a nationally representative\nU.S. sample of young adults to test whether emotion-\nal, sexual and physical abuse are associated with\nmigraine, with and without accounting for other types\nof abuse and for comorbidities of depression and anx-\niety. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of\nfrequency of abuse occurrences, and number of abuse\ntypes. Lastly we looked at the temporal relationship\nof age of onset of abuse and of migraine.\nMETHODS\nThe National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nHealth (Add Health) is a longitudinal prospective\nstudy of a nationally representative sample of\nutilized a multistage clustered sample design for\ndata collection. The first survey was administered in\nschools to a cross-section of approximately 90,000\nadolescents in grades 7\u00ad12 during the academic\nsurveyed an additional three times. Wave 4 was an\nConflict of Interest: Dr. Tietjen serves on editorial board of\nHeadache, has reviewed grants for NINDS and Migraine\nResearch Foundation, and owns common stock in Johnson\n& Johnson, and Stryker.\nMs. Karmakar reports no disclosures.\nDr. Amialchuk reports no disclosures.\nFinancial Support: Funding for the analysis in this manu-\nscript came from the University of Toledo and the Clair\nMartig endowment to the Department of Neurology.\nused survey data from Wave 4, following approval\nby the University of Toledo institutional review\nboard.\nAnalysis Sample.--We restricted the initial sample\nof 15,701 respondents by excluding those with miss-\ning sample weights, bringing the sample to 14,800.\nFurthermore, we excluded respondents with missing\nresponses to questions about socio-demographic\ncharacteristics, childhood abuse, and diagnosis of\nmigraine, current depression and lifetime diagnosis\nof depression and anxiety. The final sample was\nporting Information Figure S1 for additional details.\nVariables and Measurement.--Dependent Varia-\nble.--We used self-reported clinically diagnosed\nmigraine (based on an affirmative response to the\nquestion, \"Has a doctor, nurse or other health care\nprovider ever told you that you have or had\nmigraine headaches?\") as the dependent variable.\nThe participants were also asked for their age when\nthe diagnosis was made (age of migraine diagnosis).\nChildhood Maltreatment.--For the purposes of this\nstudy childhood maltreatment is defined as any abuse\nexperienced by the respondents before the age of\n18 years. Childhood maltreatment was self-reported\nby respondents using a six-item \"Mistreatment by\nadults\" questionnaire. Emotional abuse was assessed\nby the question: \"Before your 18th birthday, how\noften did a parent or other adult caregiver say things\nthat really hurt your feelings or made you feel like\nyou were not wanted or loved?\" Physical abuse was\nassessed by the question: \"Before your 18th birthday,\nhow often did a parent or adult caregiver hit you\nwith a fist, kick you, or throw you down on the floor,\ninto a wall, or down stairs?\" Sexual abuse was\nassessed by the question: \"How often did a parent or\nother adult caregiver touch you in a sexual way, force\nyou to touch him or her in a sexual way, or force\nyou to have sexual relations?\" The response options\nfor each question were \"this never happened,\" \"1\n\"more than 10 times.\" Simple descriptive for the fre-\nquency of abuse for each type showed that there was\na substantial drop in the number of responses in the\ncategory \"6\u00ad10 times\" for each abuse types. Hence,\nto simplify analysis and to avoid picking up outliers\nin that group the categories \"6\u00ad10 times\" and \"more\nthan 10 times\" were merged to a single category for\neach type of abuse. Those affirming abuse were asked\nto estimate the age of onset (1\u00ad18 yo) of abuse for\neach type. If an individual reported at least one count\nof physical abuse, emotional abuse or sexual abuse,\nwe classified them as abused. The frequency of occur-\nrence for each of the abuse types, and the number of\ntypes of abuse an individual experienced, were also\nused as independent variables.\nThe items used for measuring childhood abuse\nwere developed based on previously validated\nscales by the administrators of the database. The\nitem measuring childhood emotional abuse was\ndeveloped by the Add Health database administra-\ntors based on similar questions form the Childhood\nTrauma Questionnaire.18 The item measuring child-\nhood physical abuse was adapted from the validat-\ned Traumatic Events Scale20 while the item\nmeasuring childhood sexual abuse was adapted\nfrom the Parent-Child Version of the Conflict Tac-\ntics Scale.21 All three scales have been psychometri-\ncally validated and are widely used in the field of\nof the physical abuse and the sexual abuse items\nfrom the Wave 3 of the Add Health (same items as\nthe ones used in Wave 4) has been discussed in pre-\nvious published literature.22 This was done by cor-\nrelating the items as a part of a unidimensional\nabuse scale to predict experiences related to child-\nhood abuse (i.e., being paid to have sex, running\naway from home, and being homeless).22 The\nresulting models showed good fit indices with weak\nto moderate association with the variables relating\nto childhood abuse.22 In addition to this, the child-\nhood abuse items from Waves 3 and 4 dataset have\nbeen extensively used in published literature to pre-\ndict risky behaviors later in adulthood such as inti-\nmate partner violence, dating violence, substance\nabuse, drinking, delinquency, risky sexual behaviors\nand others.23\u00ad28 The items have also been linked\nwith obesity and diabetes in adulthood.29,30\nThe criterion validity of the three items from\nWave 4 were established in a peer reviewed\nconference paper by researchers from University of\nPennsylvania by correlating the different abuse\ntypes to experiences typically related to maltreat-\nment.31 However, the authors established an arbi-\ntrary cut point of being emotionally abused (10\ntimes) to reflect the national prevalence of abuse.23\nHence, for the purpose of our study, we additional-\nly investigated the criterion validity of the item\nmeasuring emotional abuse without any arbitrary\ncut point, which is presented in Supporting Infor-\nmation Table S2. The results revealed that the\nitems significantly predicted homelessness for more\nthan a week, running away from home, their child-\nhood home being investigated by Social Service,\nand being removed from childhood home by Social\nService, even after controlling for current depres-\nsion and age. Furthermore, we also analyzed the\nfactorial structure of the three items using confir-\nmatory factor analysis. The analysis revealed that\nthe three items used for measuring childhood mal-\ntreatment loaded significantly (P < .05) on a single\nfactor solution with factor loadings above 0.5 (Sup-\nporting Information Fig. S2), which suggests that\nthe items are unidimensional, measuring similar\ntraits among the respondents.\nCurrent Depression.--Depressive symptoms in the\npast seven days using a short five-item CES-D\n(Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression)\nscale was used to measure current depression. Since\ndepressive symptoms displayed at the time of sur-\nvey administration may color the reporting of child-\nhood abuse and other self-reported measures,\ncurrent depression was used in regression models as\na confounder.\nLifetime Diagnosis of Depression and Anxiety.---\nSelf-reported clinical diagnoses of depression and\nanxiety were used as additional confounders.\nRespondents were also asked for their age when\nthey were diagnosed with depression and anxiety.\nThe two specific items used were\n \"Has a doctor, nurse or other health care provider\never told you that you have or had depression?\"\n \"Has a doctor, nurse or other health care provid-\ner ever told you that you have or had anxiety or\npanic disorder?\nSocio-Demographic Characteristics.--We used\ninsurance status (had insurance vs no insurance),\nrace (white/Caucasian vs black/African American\nvs Asian vs others), and ethnicity (Hispanic vs non-\nHispanic) as socio-demographic characteristics to\naccount for confounding in regression models.\nStatistical Analysis.--Analyses were performed\nusing survey estimation procedure in STATA ver-\nsion 14 (Statacorp, College Station, TX, USA). Fre-\nquencies and percentages were used to describe\nsocio-demographic characteristics, and prevalence\nof diagnosis of migraine, depression, anxiety and\nchildhood maltreatment. T-test and chi-square were\nused to test the difference between the groups. The\nprimary dichotomous variable of migraine vs no\nmigraine diagnosis was modeled using logistic\nregression to estimate the effect of childhood mal-\ntreatment, while controlling for socio-demographic\nfactors. Current depression, and lifetime diagnosis\nof depression and anxiety were added as confound-\ners in subsequent models. Subgroup analyses were\nconducted by race and sex to test homogeneity of\nthe association between migraine and childhood\nabuse. We also used linear regression to analyze\nassociation between childhood abuse and age of\nmigraine diagnosis, and logistic regression to ana-\nlyze the association between age of onset of abuse\nand migraine diagnosis. All estimates were weight-\ned using Wave 4 cross-sectional sampling weights.\nSignificance level (a level) was set at 5% for all sta-\ntistical significance testing.\nRESULTS\nThe respondents in the final sample\nDetailed socio-demographic characteristics, includ-\ning income, are described in Table 1.\nhaving a migraine diagnosis, of which 73% were\nwomen. Women had 2.5 times higher odds of\nreporting migraine than men (odds ratio [OR] 2.54;\n15% of the entire sample reported being diagnosed\nwith depression and 12% with anxiety, whereas in\nthe migraine sample 35% reported depression and\n25% anxiety. Those with depression and anxiety\nhad higher odds of reporting a migraine diagnosis\n(Table 1).\nAbout 51% of the sample reported some form\nof childhood abuse (Table 1). Emotional abuse was\nreported by 47%, physical abuse by 19%, and\nsexual abuse by 5%. An estimated 61% of persons\nwith migraine reported being abused compared\nwith 49% of respondents without migraine. Reports\nof each type of abuse were also consistently higher\nin those with migraine (Table 1). A detailed break-\ndown of the abuse types by race and sex is reported\nin Supporting Information Table S3.

After adjusting for socio-demographic\nfactors (race, ethnicity, sex, age, insurance status\nand income), those who reported \"any abuse\" in\nchildhood had about 1.6 times greater odds (OR\ndiagnosis when compared with those without a his-\ntory of childhood abuse (Table 2). The odds of\nmigraine diagnosis were statistically higher for\nthose who reported multiple forms of childhood\nabuse. Those reporting all three forms of childhood\nabuse had almost two times higher odds (OR 1.98;\nmigraine compared with those who reported no\nabuse (Table 2).\nEach type of childhood abuse (i.e., emotional,\nphysical and sexual abuse) by itself was associated\nwith significantly higher odds of migraine diagnosis;\npresenting the highest odds (Table 2) when adjust-\ned for socio-demographic characteristics. However,\nwhen all three types of childhood abuse were used\nin the logistic regression model, essentially adjust-\ning for each other, only emotional abuse (OR 1.57;\n(Table 2). The association between frequency of\nemotional abuse and migraine diagnosis was stron-\ngest for those reporting emotional abuse occurring\neither one time or 6 times (Table 3), and lower\nfor those who reported frequencies of abuse\nbetween 2 and 5 times. Frequencies of physical and\nsexual abuse were not significantly related to odds\nof migraine diagnosis.\nAs a next step, we added current depression as\nan additional control to account for the influence of\ndepressive state on the self-reporting of abuse items\n(Table 4). This additional confounder lessened the\nstrength of the association between emotional\nabuse and diagnosis of migraine. However, the\nTable 2.--Association of Abuse with Migraine Diagnosis, Subgroup Analysis by Race and Gender\nIndependent\nVariables\nMigraine Diagnosis1 (Odds Ratios) in\nEntire Sample\nMales\nFemales\nNon-Hispanic\nNon-Hispanic\nN of abuse types\nType of abuse, unadjusted for other abuse types (2)\nType of Abuse, adjusted for other abuse types (3)\nNotes: 1: Reference group 5 not abused. 2: Odds ratios obtained by entering each abuse types separately into regression mod-\nels, additionally controlling for socio-demographic characteristics (age, income, race, and sex). 3: Odds ratios obtained by\nentering each abuse type together into a single regression models, additionally controlling for socio-demographic characteristics\n(age, income, race, and sex).\nassociations still remained significant.

The mean age of\nonset of migraine was 19 years while the mean age\nof onset of anxiety was 22 years. Furthermore, 199\nrespondents (58%) reported that migraine was\ndiagnosed earlier than anxiety while 86 respondents\n(25%) reported that migraine was diagnosed after\nanxiety. About 59 (17%) reported that migraine\nand anxiety were diagnosed at the same age.\nDISCUSSION\nWe ascertained in a cross-sectional study of a\nnationally representative sample of young adults\nthat emotional abuse in childhood, the most com-\nmon type of maltreatment reported in this survey\n(Tables 1 and Supporting Information Table S2),\nwas also the type most closely associated with\nmigraine (Tables 2, 4, and 5). Of the three adverse\nchildhood experiences evaluated, it was the only\none linked to migraine after adjusting for the other\nabuse types, socio-demographic factors, lifetime\ndiagnosis of anxiety and depression, and current\ndepression.\nIn the Add Health population, prevalence of\nemotional abuse approached 50%, using a broadly\nworded question, \"how often did a parent or other\nadult caregiver say things that really hurt your feel-\nings or made you feel like you were not wanted or\nloved?\" We defined a positive response to the ques-\ntion, even if occurring only one time, as abuse to\nexamine the frequency spectrum. Defining moderate\nto severe emotional abuse as a positive response to\n10 times yields a prevalence of 12%. This is compa-\nrable with the 10.6% reported for \"moderate to\nsevere\" emotional abuse in the ACE study,6 where\nthe single question had a similar 2-part construct but\nwas more descriptive, and incorporated general fre-\nquency (\"often\" or \"very often\"), and the threat of\nTable 5.--Association of Abuse with Migraine Diagnosis, Controlling for Lifetime Diagnosis of Depression and Anxiety\nIndependent Variables\nMigraine Diagnosis1 (Odds Ratios) in\nEntire Sample\nMales\nFemales\nNon-Hispanic\nNon-Hispanic\nN of abuse types\nType of abuse, unadjusted for other abuse types (2)\nType of abuse, adjusted for other abuse types (3)\nNotes: 1: Reference group 5 not abused. 2: Odds Ratios obtained by entering each abuse type separately into regression mod-\nels, additionally controlling for socio-demographic characteristics (age, income, race, and sex), depression and anxiety. 3: Odds\nRatios obtained by entering each abuse types together into a single regression models, additionally controlling for socio-\ndemographic characteristics (age, income, race, and sex), depression and anxiety.\nphysical violence, rather than emotional abandonment,\ni.e., \"Did a parent or other adult in the household\noften or very often swear at you, insult you, or put\nyou down, or sometimes, often, or very often act in\na way that made you think that you might be physi-\ncally hurt?\" The 21.6% prevalence of moderate to\nsevere emotional abuse in the AMPP study5 sample\nwas determined by responses to the five-question\nCTQ module regarding experiencing name calling\nand other insults, feeling hated and unwanted, or\nconsidered themselves emotionally abused. In those\nwith migraine (85% of the sample) the prevalence\nwas 22.5%, similar to what had been found using\nthe same instrument in a headache clinic-based sam-\nple of migraineurs, i.e., 20%, for moderate to severe\nintensity, although 40% for mild to moderate inten-\nsity.32 Differences in the socio-demographic compo-\nsition of the study samples may have also played a\nrole in the varying prevalence rates of abuse.\nDespite the differences in study populations, and in\nmeasures of abuse and prevalence rates there is a\nconsistency of findings in the Add Health, ACE,6\nand AMPP5 studies, each finding emotional abuse to\nbe the type of abuse most tightly associated with\nmigraine or frequent headache. Point estimates of\nodds ratios (unadjusted for depression and anxiety)\nin the studies were similar, ranging between 1.465\nEmotional abuse in childhood is more frequent-\nly recalled by women than men, in our study as\nwell as in the ACE6 and AMPP5 studies. In post\nhoc analyses of subgroups, we demonstrated a\nhigher odds ratio for the emotional abuse-migraine\nassociation in males than in females, a finding not\npreviously reported. Of note, the association of\nmigraine and posttraumatic stress disorder, as eval-\nuated in the cross-sectional, general population\nNational Comorbidity Survey Replication, was also\nmore robust in men.33 Reasons for sex-based differ-\nences in these associations with migraine are uncer-\ntain, but from a biological perspective may be\nrelated to variations of stress reactivity,34 inflamma-\ntion,35 brain structural changes (particularly in the\ncorpus callosum),36 and unique sensitive periods for\nstress-related structural changes.37 From a social\nperspective, the gender-based differences in the\nassociation may also be attributed to the fact that\nwomen are more likely to seek mental health care\nthan men.38,39 Hence, it is possible that women\nreceive treatment more often for the initial abuse-\nrelated trauma, thereby developing better coping\ntechniques than men. These hypotheses require\nconfirmation through continued research.\nWhen stratified by race, the black/African-\nAmerican subgroup, which comprised 20.6% of the\npopulation, did not demonstrate an association\nbetween migraine and abuse, in adjusted analyses.\nThis stands in contrast to the association of\nmigraine and emotional abuse in the white/Cauca-\nsian subgroup. Factors, including relatively small\nsample size, genetic and epigenetic determinants of\nresilience may be at play. This race-related differ-\nence is a novel finding requiring confirmation in\nother samples.\nImportance of emotional abuse as a risk factor\nfor mental health conditions has been recognized\nglobally. In 2015, for example, there were studies\nfrom Australia, Asia, India, and Portugal,40\u00ad44 in\naddition to a meta-analysis of all published litera-\nture,45 reporting strong links between emotional\nabuse and depression, suicidality, and other psycho-\npathology. Migraine is comorbid with a number of\npsychiatric conditions, particularly depression and\nanxiety.46 Our data support a relationship of\nmigraine and emotional abuse, which is indepen-\ndent of, although attenuated by, both depression\nand anxiety. The finding that in over two-thirds of\nparticipants the diagnosis of migraine either preced-\ned or was concomitant with the diagnoses of\ndepression and anxiety suggests that adjustment for\ndepression and anxiety may be an overcorrection.\nThe mechanism of the relationship of migraine\nand emotional abuse is uncertain, but there is a\ngrowing body of scientific study supporting neuro-\nphysiological links. Dysregulation of the neurohu-\nmoral, autonomic, immune, and metabolic systems\nappears to be a consequence of maltreatment-\nrelated stress, and may also play a role in\nmigraine.47 Areas of the brain structurally and func-\ntionally affected by childhood abuse and by\nmigraine are also similar,48\u00ad51 and include the limbic\nsystem structures, which connect to pain regions in\nthe brainstem.51 Putative mechanisms by which early\nlife stress increases the likelihood of developing\nmigraine include gene x environment interactions, in\naddition to epigenetic modifications via DNA\nWe demonstrated that onset of emotional abuse\nprecedes onset of migraine in 83% of cases, a novel\nfinding. Like in other studies,5\u00ad7 we found an increas-\ning odds of migraine with increasing number of\nabuse types, i.e., a dose response relationship. Cau-\nsality cannot be inferred from the abuse-migraine\nassociations found in cross-sectional analysis. We find\nit intriguing, however, that several of Sir Bradford\nHill's nine criteria for establishing an argument for\ncausation53 have been met while examining the rela-\ntionship between migraine and abuse, including the\ntemporal sequence, biological gradient (i.e., dose\u00ad\nresponse), consistency of findings across research\nsites and methods, specificity, coherence with natural\nbiology and progression of disease, analogous evi-\ndence with abuse and mental health problems in lon-\ngitudinal studies, and biological plausibility.\nAnother original finding is the U-shaped curve\nbased on frequency of occurrences for each sepa-\nrate abuse type, even after controlling for current\ndepression and lifetime diagnosis of depression and\nanxiety. Although this finding may be due to the\ninaccuracies of the measurement tools for abuse\nand migraine, we hypothesize a role for resilience\nthat with repeated events eventually becomes\nstrained. There is support for this conjecture from\nanimal and human studies showing that exposure to\nstressors has a positive toughening effect when the\nexposure is limited and there is an opportunity for\nrecovery.54 A multiyear longitudinal, study of the\neffects of adversity on mental health-related out-\ncomes in a national sample demonstrated a similar\nU-shaped relationship.55 Evaluating the reproduc-\nibility of our findings in other datasets is necessary.\nStrengths of our investigation include the large,\nnationally representative sample. The mean age of\nadults in our study was 30 years old, which was\nnearly two to three decades younger than the\nmeans in other studies investigating the relationship\nof abuse and headache,5\u00ad7 in adults. Also, the Add\nHealth survey queried all three major types of\nchildhood abuse, and we controlled for the other\ntwo in the analysis of each abuse type. Unique to\nthis dataset are reports of frequency of each abuse\ntype and information on age of both abuse onset\nand migraine diagnosis.\nThere are a number of limitations of the study\nas it pertains to examining the relationship of\nabuse, particularly emotional abuse, and migraine.\nIn any cross-sectional studies, causality cannot be\ninferred from the association of variables. The most\noften raised concern in retrospective studies of\nevents of childhood and adolescence is that abuse\nis based on self-report and not on objective data,\nsuch as court records, and therefore subject to\nrecall bias. The traumatic nature of the event(s),\nthe stigma of being perceived as \"damaged,\" and\nthe passage of time may lead to under reporting.\nOur finding that an affirmative answer to the emo-\ntional abuse question, even for a single event, had\nsignificant criterion validity for a number of out-\ncomes that have been tied to abuse, lends support\nto accuracy of the recollection. This type of analysis\nhas not previously been done in the abuse-migraine\nliterature, but similar validity findings have been\nreported for sexual abuse and physical abuse from\nthis data set.22 Although over-reporting of abuse is\nthought to be less likely than under reporting,56 it\nis possible that depression may negatively influence\nmemories of past experiences. To account for this\npossibility, our analysis controlled for both lifetime\nand current diagnosis of depression.\nOther limitations of the study include the use of\nself-reported healthcare provider diagnosis of life-\ntime depression, anxiety, and migraine but at least\nin the case of current depression, we had a validated\ntool (CES-D) of measurement over the preceding\nseven days. In the case of migraine, investigators\nin the Women's Health Study reported excellent\nagreement between self-reported migraine and\nICHD-2 based migraine classification.57 This agree-\nment would likely also be true for healthcare provid-\ner diagnosis, but there still may be participants who,\nfor personal, cultural, or socio-economic reasons,\nhave not seen a healthcare providers and therefore\nhave not been diagnosed with migraine (or depres-\nsion or anxiety). However, controlling for income\nand health insurance status, both of which are associ-\nated with access to health care, did not significantly\nchange the estimates. It is also reassuring that in our\nstudy both the migraine prevalence (14%) and fema-\nle:male ratio of migraine (2.5:1) are in keeping with\nlarger U.S. epidemiological studies using validated\ninstruments to ascertain migraine diagnosis.58 We\nhave looked at the influence of age of abuse onset,\nnumber of occurrences of abuse, and number of\ntypes of abuse on the relationship to migraine, but\nother information, which may be germane to the out-\ncome, such as the severity of individual incidents, the\nduration and ages over which abuse occurred, the\nrelationship to the perpetrator, and the available sup-\nport system, is missing.\nCONCLUSIONS\nMore than either physical or sexual abuse,\nemotional abuse during childhood and adolescence,\neven a single occurrence, predisposes an individual\nto migraine. A causal relationship cannot be ascer-\ntained from this study, but the gradient demonstrat-\ned by increasing association of abuse and migraine\nwith increasing number of types of abuse experi-\nenced, and the temporal relationship wherein abuse\nprecedes development of migraine, supports the\nhypothesis that there may be a causative pathway.\nFurther research to corroborate the influence of\nemotional abuse on migraine and to understand the\npotential mechanistic links is warranted.\n"
