Specifically, students\ncompleted the Future-Orientation Questionnaire, the Psychological Sense of School Membership scale, and the Revised\nOlweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire to assess their future orientation, school bonding, and bullying behaviors, respectively.\nResults indicated that students' future orientation (toward education or occupation) was negatively associated with school\nbullying perpetration. Future orientation was also significantly associated with their feeling of school bonding. School bonding\nhad a significant indirect effect (b = .37) on the relation between future orientation in the educational domain and school\nbullying behavior, and also played a significant mediating role in the relation between future orientation in the occupational\ndomain and school bullying perpetration (b = .30). This research suggests that school bonding may be one mechanism by\nwhich children's orientation toward future education or future occupation may have an effect on their bullying perpetration\nbehaviors.\n",

Significant research attention has been\ndirected toward identifying risk factors for bullying and vic-\ntimization, thus we can now sketch a fairly accurate profile\nof the characteristics of perpetrators and victims of school\nbullying (Cook, Williams, Guerra, Kim, & Sadek, 2010).\nHowever, given that protective and promotive factors also\nplay an important role in the etiology and the developmental\ncourse of adolescent problem behavior, scientific attention\nshould be broadened beyond its traditional preoccupation\nwith risk factors to encompass protective and promotive fac-\ntors as well (Jessor, Van Den Bos, Vanderryn, Costa, &\nTurbin, 1995), so as to inform school bullying prevention\nstrategies for adolescents to aim to reduce the risks and\nstrengthen the protective factors (Ttofi & Farrington, 2012).\nFuture orientation, which refers to an individual's\nthoughts, plans, motivations, and feelings about his or her\nfuture (Nurmi, 1991), has been identified as a protective and\npromotive factor for adolescents. Nurmi (1991) pointed out\nthat adolescents who are not oriented toward the future may\nengage in a variety of problem behaviors, such as delin-\nquency, problems in school or drug use. Research has pro-\nvided evidence of the association between future orientation\nand a wide range of problem behaviors (Bolland, 2003;\nZimmerman, & Bauermeister, 2011). However, the link\nbetween future orientation and school bullying has not been\nexamined. In addition, no research has tested the mediating\neffect of school bonding on the relation between future ori-\nentation and school bullying behavior. Therefore, in the pres-\nent study, we aim to examine the relationship between future\norientation and school bullying, and to examine the mediat-\ning effect of school bonding on the future orientation--\nschool bullying behavior link.\nIn adolescence, future orientation is an important issue\nworthy of further research. First, the subjective sense of\nfuture time plays an essential role in student or human moti-\nadolescence is a time of identity development, exploration,\nand commitment (Erikson, 1950). Third, motivational fac-\ntors are more malleable than individual demographic factors\n1The University of Hong Kong, China\nCorresponding Author:\nShu Ling Gao, Department of Social Work and Social Administration, The\nUniversity of Hong Kong, The Jockey Club Tower, Centennial Campus,\n712, 7/F, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, China.\nEmail: shulinggao@sina.com\nFuture Orientation and School Bullying\nAmong Adolescents in Rural China: The\nMediating Role of School Bonding\nShu Ling Gao1 and Ko Ling Chan1\n Keywords\nfuture orientation, school bullying, school bonding, adolescents, rural China\n2 SAGE Open\nand school context factors.As such, they are capable of being\nthe target of school-based prevention and intervention\nefforts.\nFuture Orientation and Bullying Behaviors\nAdolescence is a critical \"turning point\" in the life course,\nduring which adolescents make important choices that will\nhave an impact on their future (Quinton, Pickles, Maughan,\n& Rutter, 1993). Future orientation is an issue that becomes\ncritical as children approach adolescence, during which time\nit is rapidly developing, differentiating, and expanding\n(Greene, 1986). Future plans become increasingly detailed,\nand adolescents begin to make more realistic evaluations of\ntheir ability to reach future goals. Seginer (2009) reviewed\nprevious work on future orientation and summarized the\naspects of future orientation that may have motivating effects\non behaviors, namely, the perceived value of future events,\nthe expected possibilities of achieving future goals, and the\nevaluation of one's control over goal attainment. On the\nbasis of these considerations, individuals direct their devel-\nopment in certain ways and purposefully select a variety of\nlife trajectories (Nurmi, 1993). That is to say that if adoles-\ncents consider a positive future that is important, achievable,\nand controllable, they would be expected to devote them-\nselves to activities that help them reach that vision of their\nfuture; whereas a low level of future orientation may influ-\nence the decision-making process of engaging in problem\nThere are a number of studies showing that future orienta-\ntion is inversely related to several kinds of problem behav-\niors, including theft (Oyserman & Saltz, 1993), general\ndelinquency (Skorikov & Vondracek, 2007), school miscon-\nduct (Oyserman, Bybee, & Terry, 2006), and violent behav-\nresearch, however, has established whether future orienta-\ntion is negatively associated with school bullying.\nAccordingly, the first aim of the present study was to exam-\nine the relation between future orientation and bullying\nbehavior.\nThe Mediating Effect of School Bonding\nSchool bonding is argued to be particularly important for\nadolescents as they rely less on family as part of the individu-\nation process and come to rely more on extrafamilial rela-\ntionships, such as those found in schools, with friends, and\nothers (Goodenow, 1993). Researchers have not yet reached\nconsensus about the definition of school bonding. In the cur-\nrent study, to define school bonding, we adopted Goodenow's\n(1993) definition of psychological school membership,\nwhich refers to \"the extent to which students feel personally\naccepted, respected, included, and supported by others in the\nschool social environment\" (p. 80). Empirical studies have\ndocumented that students' school bonding is negatively\nrelated to a number of conduct problems, aggression, and\nviolent behaviors (Chapman, Buckley, Sheehan, Shochet, &\nRomaniuk, 2011; Loukas, Ripperger-Suhler, & Horton,\ninstance, Maddox and Prinz (2003) found that school bond-\ning is linked to delinquency and antisocial behavior.\nHowever, the relationship between school bonding and\nschool bullying remains unclear. Therefore, in the current\nstudy, it is expected that school bonding is negatively associ-\nated with bullying behavior. In addition, previous research\nreported gender differences in bullying behaviors (Atik &\nthus the effect of gender on bullying should be tested.\nStudies of the antecedents of school bonding have prolif-\nerated, but many have either focused on individual character-\nistics, such as age, gender, physical attractiveness, family\nstructure, and academic performance (Thompson, Iachan,\nOverpeck, Ross, & Gross, 2006), emotional problems\n(Waters, Cross, & Shaw, 2010b), and coping styles\n(Frydenberg, Care, Freeman, & Chan, 2009), or focused on\nschool ecology factors (McNeely, Nonnemaker, & Blum,\nattention to individual motivational factors, such as future\norientation.\nMultiple studies have shown that being future-oriented is\nassociated with several optimal school outcomes. For\ninstance, future-oriented students have been found to regu-\nlate their study behavior (Bilde, Vansteenkiste, & Lens,\n2011), to be more strongly engaged in their schoolwork, to\nspend more time studying (Horstmanshof & Zimitat, 2007),\nto manage their time more efficiently, to display less procras-\ntination (Harber, Zimbardo, & Boyd, 2003; Jackson, Fritch,\nNagasaka, & Pope, 2003), to persevere with their school-\nwork, and they also derive a greater sense of satisfaction\nfrom studying (Zaleski, 1987). Although there is no direct\nevidence showing that future orientation is associated with\nschool bonding, much indirect pieces of evidence hint that\nfuture orientation may be positively related to school bond-\ning. Based on these findings, in the present study it is antici-\npated that future orientation be positively associated with\nschool bonding. It is important to note that prior research\nreported age and gender differences of future orientation\n(Lamm, Schmidt, & Trommsdorff, 1976; Steinberg et al.,\n2009), therefore the effects of gender and age (or grade) on\nfuture orientation should be tested.\nNow the last but most important hypothesis has also\nemerged. Specifically, in the above section, we hypothesized\nthat future orientation is negatively related to school bullying\nbehaviors; in the current section, we have hypothesized that\nfuture orientation is positively associated with school bond-\ning, which is, in turn, negatively related to bullying behav-\niors. Then, does school bonding have a mediating effect on\nthe relation between future orientation and school bullying\nbehaviors? Thus, in the current study, school bonding is\nanticipated to have a mediating effect on the relation between\nfuture orientation and school bullying.\nGao and Chan 3\nTheoretical Foundations\nA social exchange perspective can be applied to explain bul-\nlying behavior by weighing the costs, rewards, and alterna-\ntives for its perpetrators. A social exchange framework posits\nthat much of human relationships are formed by the use of a\nsubjective cost\u00adbenefit analysis and the comparison of alter-\nBullying is probably rewarding for perpetrators. For instance,\nthey can obtain power, social dominance, or high-status\ngroup affiliation through bullying (Olthof, Goossens,\nare two kinds of standard or criterion to evaluate the accept-\nability of outcomes in an exchange relationship: comparison\nlevel (CL) that determines whether the exchange meets the\nindividual's expectations, and CL for alternatives (or CL\nalt\n)\nthat determines whether the current outcome exceeds the\nindividual's other alternatives (Thibaut & Kelley, 1959). In\nadolescence, with the rapid development of future orienta-\ntion (Greene, 1986), adolescents have more alternatives to\nmeet their needs and achieve their goals, such as through\ncommitment to future education or occupation to gain social\nstatus or power. These alternatives may be more cost-effec-\ntive than bullying in the long run. Therefore, adolescents\nwho develop high-level future orientation may less likely\nengage in bullying, whereas those who have a low level of\nfuture orientation may pursue immediate gratification by\nengaging in bullying.\nPurpose of Study\nUsing a cross-sectional research design among adolescents\nin rural China, the current research aimed to examine future\norientation as a motivator enhancing students' sense of\nschool bonding, which, in turn, negatively relates to bullying\nbehavior.\nSpecifically, four central questions guided this research:\nResearch Question 1: Does adolescents' future orienta-\ntion predict their bullying behaviors?\nResearch Question 2: Does adolescents' future orienta-\ntion predict their sense of school bonding?\nResearch Question 3: Does adolescents' school bonding\npredict school bullying behavior?\nResearch Question 4: Does adolescents' school bonding\nmediate the effect of future orientation on bullying\nbehavior?\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants were 677 students from one rural middle school\nand 168 (24.8%) were eighth and ninth graders, respectively.\nParticipants ranged in age from 12 to 17 years, with a mean\nProcedures\nApproval for this research was obtained from the University\nHuman Research Ethics Committee prior to data collection.\nData were collected in spring 2013 through anonymous self-\nreport questionnaires distributed in the regular classroom by\nthe researcher and teachers.

Students completed the questionnaires during\nclass time. The children did not receive compensation for\ntheir participation in the study.\nMeasures\nBackground variables. Students were asked to provide demo-\ngraphic information, including age, gender, grade, and\nwhether they were left behind or not.\nBullying perpetration.Bullying perpetration was assessed\nusing the Chinese version of the Revised Olweus Bully/Vic-\ntim Questionnaire (OBVQ-R; W. X. Zhang, Wu, & Jones,\n1999). Seven items were presented asking about specific\nforms of behaviors associated with bullying others. These\nseven questions referred to the four forms of bullying perpe-\ntration: verbal, physical, social, and other forms of bullying\nothers. Example items include \"I called mean names, made\nfun of, or teased others in a hurtful way,\" and \"I hit, kicked,\npushed, shoved around, or locked others indoors.\" Partici-\npants were asked to respond on a 5-point Likert-type scale\nranging from 0 (never) to 4 (several times a week). Total\nscores were calculated by summing across items. The range\nof total scores thus ran from 0 to 28. The Cronbach's alpha\ncoefficient for the seven-item scale was .81 (W. X. Zhang\nFuture orientation. The Exploration and Commitment Ques-\ntionnaire (Nurmi, Seginer, & Poole, 1990) was used to mea-\nsure the levels of exploration and commitment separately in\nthree domains of future life: education, occupation, and fam-\nily. Exploration for education, occupation, or family was\nassessed by asking three questions, respectively, concerning\nthe extent to which the participants had sought information\nand planned for this domain of their lives (e.g., \"How often\ndo you think about your studies and plan your future educa-\ntion?\"). The participants respond to the questions on a 5-point\nLikert-type scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (daily).

The participants responded\nto the questions on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from\n1 (definitely not) to 5 (definitely yes). Cronbach's alpha reli-\nabilities for the scores measuring commitment to decisions\nconcerning future education, occupation, and family were\nThe Chinese version of the Exploration and Commitment\nQuestionnaire was revised by L. L. Zhang, Zhang, Ji, and\nNurmi (2006). Cronbach's alpha reliabilities for explorations\nconcerning future education, occupation, and family were\n.53, .66, and .76, respectively. Cronbach's alpha reliabilities\nfor the scores measuring commitment to decisions concern-\ning future education, occupation, and family were .59, .56,\nand .68, respectively.\nIn the current study, we only chose the subscale of explo-\nrations concerning future education and occupation, and\ncommitment to decisions concerning future education and\noccupation. In this study, Cronbach's alpha reliabilities for\nexplorations concerning future education and occupation\nwere .55 and .66, respectively; Cronbach's alpha reliabilities\nfor the scores measuring commitment to decisions concern-\ning future education and occupation were .59 and .58, respec-\ntively. Cronbach's alpha reliability for the whole future\norientation scale was .84.\nSchool bonding. It was assessed with the Psychological Sense\nof School Membership (PSSM) scale (Goodenow, 1993).\nThe Chinese version of the PSSM is an 18-item measure\nusing a 6-point Likert-type scale response format ranging\nfrom 1 (not at all true) to 6 (completely true; Cheung & Hui,\n2003). This scale assesses the extent to which students feel a\nsense of belonging (e.g., \"I feel like a real part of this\nschool\"), respect (e.g., \"I am treated with as much respect as\nother students\"), encouragement (e.g., \"People here know I\ncan do good work\"), and acceptance and inclusion (e.g., \"I\nam included in lots of activities at this school\"). Goodenow\n(1993) reported that in two studies with suburban students,\ninternal reliability was .88. Scores on the PSSM correlated\nsignificantly with teacher-rated social standing and with stu-\ndent self-reported motivation, grades, and teacher-rated stu-\ndent effort (Goodenow, 1993). The internal consistency of\nthis measure for the present sample was  = .83.\nResults\nAnalysis Overview\nResearch questions were addressed with structural equation\n2010). Missing data were dealt with listwise deletion. Models\nwere estimated separately for the educational and occupa-\ntional domain of future orientation. That is, we established\ntwo models: In Model 1, there were three variables--future\neducational orientation (independent variable), school bond-\ning (mediator), and bullying behavior (dependent variable);\nin Model 2, there were three variables--future occupational\norientation (independent variable), school bonding (media-\ntor), and bullying behavior (dependent variable). Model fit\nwas evaluated based on the chi-square test statistic, the com-\nparative fit index (CFI), the root mean square error of\napproximation (RMSEA), and the standardized root mean\nsquare residual (SRMR). Guidelines suggest that CFI values\ngreater than .95, RMSEA less than .06, and SRMR less than\nGender Differences in Future Orientation, School\nBonding, and School Bullying\nIndependent-samples t test analyses indicated that there were\nno significant differences in scores for males and females in\nsignificant differences in scores in bullying, t(675) = 6.31,\np < .01, and in occupational future orientation, t(675) =\nGrade Differences in Future Orientation, School\nBonding, and School Bullying\nOne-way ANOVA analyses showed a statistically significant\ndifference in future occupational orientation scores for three\nno statistical differences in future educational orientation,\nthree grade groups.

The kurtosis values of the four variables of the school bul-\nlying perpetration scale were greater than 0, indicating that\nthe univariate distributions of variables were not normal\nwhich can lead to multivariate abnormality, thus the more\nrobust maximum likelihood mean adjusted (MLM) estimator\nwas used for data analysis in the present study rather than\nML which is based on data normality (Byrne, 2012).\nCorrelations, covariances, variances, means, and standard\ndeviations for latent variables are presented in Table 2.\nStructural Equation Modeling Analysis\nMeasurement model. All the measured variables significantly\nloaded on the latent variables (all p < .001; see Table 3).

The structural model of total effect of future\neducational (or occupational) orientation on school bullying\nperpetration fits the data well (see Table 4). The proposed\nmediation model with the indirect pathway of future educa-\ntional (or occupational) orientation on school bullying\nthrough school bonding demonstrated a good fit with the data\n(see Table 4). There was a significant and negative indirect\neffect ( = -.37, p < .05) in Model 1(see Table 5); to estimate\nthe effect size of the mediation effect in Model 1, the method\ndecreases by 0.11 standard deviations for every 1 SD increase\nin education future orientation indirectly via school bonding.\nSimilarly, there was a significant and negative indirect effect\n( = -.30, p < .05) in Model 2 (see Table 5); the effect size of\nthe mediation effect in Model 2 is ab\u00b7Sx / Sy = (-.30) 0.62 /\n2.04 = -.09, indicating that bullying perpetration decreases\nby 0.09 standard deviations for every 1 SD increase in occu-\npation future orientation indirectly via school bonding. It is\nalso important to note that future education orientation\naccounted for 44% of the variance in school bonding (p <\n.001); in turn, future education orientation and school bond-\ning explained 26% of the variance in bullying perpetration (p\n< .01). Similarly, future occupation orientation accounted for\n36% of the variance in school bonding (p < .001); in turn,\nfuture occupation orientation and school bonding explained\n24% of the variance in bullying perpetration (p < .01).\nDiscussion\nThis research examined relations among future orientation,\nschool bonding, and school bullying perpetration behaviors\namong a sample of adolescents in rural China. Four hypothe-\nses were all supported. Specifically, future orientation is nega-\ntively associated with school bullying perpetration behaviors;\nfuture orientation is positively related to school bonding;\nschool bonding is negatively associated with school bullying\nperpetration behaviors; and school bonding mediates the\nTable 1.

First, it\nhas demonstrated that adolescents' future orientation in both\nthe educational and occupational domains is associated with\ndiminished bullying behaviors, suggesting that such motiva-\ntion may be beneficial for reducing bullying behavior. This\nfinding is in accord with previous related studies, which\nreported that future orientation is inversely related to school\nmisconduct (Oyserman et al., 2006; Skorikov & Vondracek,\n2007). Second, in the current study the hypothesis that future\norientation is related to school bonding was supported. Third,\nthe current research found that students' feelings of bonding\nto their school were significantly related to fewer bullying\nbehaviors. This finding is consistent with previous research\n(Loukas et al., 2009), which found that adolescents' feelings\nof school bonding predicted lower levels of conduct prob-\nlems and physical aggression. Moreover, the results of the\nmediation models supported the notion that children's future\norientation (whether in the educational or occupational\ndomain) has significant mediating effects on their bullying\nbehaviors through school bonding. This finding corroborated\nand extended previous research (Bilde et al., 2011; Chapman\nrelation between future orientation and school activities, or\nthe relation between school bonding and problem\nbehaviors.\nLimitations and Strengths\nIt is important to note limitations when interpreting these\nresults. First, due to limited research resources (e.g., research\nfund), we can only conduct cross-sectional study using con-\nvenient sampling and only collect self-report data. However,\nreliance on exclusively self-reported data raises the issue of\nsocial desirability and recall biases, which may inflate or\ndeflate correlations. Further research would benefit from a\nmultirate\u00admultimethod design, such as using teacher-, self-,\nand peer report simultaneously in one study. Furthermore,\nthis study was exploratory in nature, and cross-validation is\ntherefore needed to address potential issues with sample\ndependency. Given that social class (McLoyd, Kaplan,\nPurtell, & Huston, 2011) and culture (Sundberg, Poole, &\nTyler, 1983) can also influence adolescents' future orienta-\ntion, further research with a large and representative sample\nis necessary to examine whether adolescents' future orienta-\ntion is related to their bullying behavior through a sense of\nschool bonding. Another limitation of the present study is\nthat, as the data were collected concurrently, it would be\ninappropriate to make statements (however tentative) about\nthe causal direction of effect. Future longitudinal research\nwould provide an insight into the direction of these effects.\nDespite these limitations, this study has a number of\nstrengths. It is the first to apply a social exchange framework\nto explain bullying behavior, and to incorporate a social\nTable 3.

For instance,\nprevious research found that school bullying behaviors peak\nin middle school and decline in high school (Williams &\nGuerra, 2007). According to social exchange perspective,\nthis may be because adolescent bullies become more focused\nat this stage on planning and achieving future goals for a\ndelayed gratification (Trommsdorff, Lamm, & Schmidt,\n1979). Another strength is the examination of the role of\nfuture orientation in conjunction with school bonding and\nbullying behavior, which focused on protective factors rather\nthan on the risk factors of bullying. Focusing on protective\nfactors and building the resilience of children at risk may be\na more positive approach and more attractive to\ncommunities.\nImplications\nBy providing evidence of protective factors in reducing bul-\nlying behavior, this study can inform bullying agencies to\nadopt a protective factor focused on a prevention and inter-\nvention approach as their framework to guide new antibully-\ning initiatives. First, the results of this study indicate that one\npossible way to reduce bullying is to enhance adolescent bul-\nlies' future orientation. If they plan and commit to a valued,\nachievable, and controllable future goal, they might become\nless involved in bullying behavior. School psychologists\nshould help students find their valued, achievable, and con-\ntrollable future goal, and help them achieve it. Second, it is\nimportant for school psychologists to inform and educate\nteachers, administrators, and staff on the role school bonding\nplays in contributing to diminished bullying behavior. This\nstudy also indicates that students'heightening future orienta-\ntion could increase their level of school bonding. Other\nevidence for strategies to improve school bonding is also\nemerging, such as mentoring (Karcher, 2005; King,Vidourek,\nConclusion\nThis study represents a first step in understanding relations\namong future orientation, school bonding, and school bully-\ning perpetration behaviors. A conceptual mediation model\nwith four hypotheses was tested, wherein school bonding\nmediated the relationship between future orientation and\nschool bullying perpetration. The findings generally sup-\nported our proposed model, and four hypotheses were\nsupported.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAtik, G., & Guneri, O.
