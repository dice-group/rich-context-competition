Such training is physi-\ncally and mentally demanding and may have undesirable\neffects on medical students' personal health (Dyrbye,\nThomas, & Shanafelt, 2005). According to Weil (n.d.), medi-\ncal schools foster unhealthy lifestyles; medical students suf-\nfer from sleep deprivation, poor nutrition, lack of exercise,\nand are placed under a considerable amount of stress. In one\nstudy, medical students were shown to have a poorer status\nof physical and mental health, and more anxiety, depression,\nand negative lifestyle changes as compared with non-\nmedical students (Al-Dabal, Koura, Rasheed,Al-Souwielem,\n& Makki, 2010). Physicians are health professionals who\nplay a vital role in a country's health care system. It is there-\nfore essential that physicians-in-training maintain their own\nwell-being to better care for their patients in the future.\nAssessing the overall health of individuals and popula-\ntions is of public health importance. According to the Center\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (2011), one approach to\nthis is to make use of an expansive concept known as health-\nrelated quality of life (HRQOL). It is a multidimensional\nmeasure for evaluating physical functioning, psychological\nwell-being, and social functioning (Calvert & Skelton, 2008).\nAs it is multifaceted, HRQOL is in agreement with the defi-\nnition of health of the World Health Organization (2013),\nwhich is \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social\nwell-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infir-\nmity.\" HRQOL has been applied to studies of various popu-\nlations such as those with chronic diseases or debilitation, as\nwell as to groups of healthy adults and health professionals.\nA search for published research articles that primarily\nassessed the HRQOL of medical students revealed studies\nconducted in Canada (Raj, Simpson, Hopman, & Singer,\n2013), and none in the Philippines. This study therefore\naimed to assess the HRQOL of medical students at the Saint\nLouis University in Baguio City, Philippines. Specifically, it\nsought to determine the status of the HRQOL of the medical\nstudents along the domains of physical functioning, role lim-\nitations due to physical health, bodily pain, general health\nperceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due\nto emotional problems, and mental health; it also sought to\n1School of Medicine, Saint Louis University, Baguio City, Philippines\nCorresponding Author:\nJohn Anthony A.

Domantay1\n Keywords\nHealth-related quality of life, medical students, medical school, medical education\n2 SAGE Open\ndetermine factors associated with the medical students'\nMethod\nStudy Design\nA cross-sectional study design was used. In this design, the\noutcome variable, which is the HRQOL, as well as the expo-\nsure variables were assessed at a particular point in time\nusing a questionnaire. A descriptive cross-sectional design\nwas used to determine the status of the medical students'\nHRQOL. An analytical cross-sectional design was used to\ndetermine the factors that are associated with the medical\nstudents' HRQOL.\nStudy Population\nThe target population included all students enrolled at the\nSaint Louis University School of Medicine in Baguio City,\ntion of the students was 608. As all students were included in\nthe study, no sampling techniques were employed.\nData Collection\nData were gathered using a questionnaire consisting of the\nfollowing parts:\nAssessment of HRQOL.HRQOL was measured using the\n36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire.\nThe SF-36 is a multipurpose, short-form health survey con-\nsisting of 36 questions. It measures eight areas of health:\nphysical functioning, role limitations due to physical health,\nbodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social func-\ntioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and\nmental health. The tool produces scores for each of these\neight areas. As a generic measure, this questionnaire has\nbeen useful in evaluating the health of general and specific\npopulations as well as assessing HRQOL (Ware, 2003).\nThus, it is an appropriate data gathering instrument for this\nstudy.\nThe SF-36 was authored by John E. Ware Jr. and was\ndeveloped as a part of the RAND Medical Outcomes Study\n(MOS): Measures of Quality of Life Core Survey (RAND\nCorporation, n.d.-a). The utilization of the SF-36 has been\ncited in more than 4,000 published articles. It has also been\nacknowledged as the most widely evaluated generic patient\nassessed health outcome among quality of life measures. It\nhas also been used in the description of more than 200 dis-\neases and conditions. Translations of the instrument have\nhas been reported to have high reliability, with coefficients\nexceeding .70 and even .80. There is also evidence of the\ninstrument having adequate content validity, concurrent\nvalidity, criterion validity, construct validity, and predictive\nvalidity. The various studies on the validity of the SF-36 are\ncited elsewhere (Ware, 2003). A recent study has shown that\nthe instrument is a valid and reliable tool for measuring the\nhealth status among Filipinos residing in two cities in the\nPhilippines (Castillo-Carandang et al., 2013).\nThe SF-36 can be used as a self-administered question-\nnaire, or can be administered via a computer or personal or\ntelephone interview. It takes only 5 to 10 minutes to com-\nplete. In this study, it was given to the medical students as a\nself-administered questionnaire.\nScoring of the instrument followed the two-step process\nas recommended by the RAND Corporation (n.d.-b). In the\nfirst step, precoded numeric values were recoded using a\nscoring key. Each item was scored in a range of 0 to 100. The\nscores represented the percentage of the total possible score\nachieved. In the second step, items in the same scale were\naveraged together to yield the eight-area (scale) scores.\nMissing data were not included when computing for the\nscale scores.\nIn this study, norm-based interpretation of the SF-36 was\nused. In this interpretation strategy, 50 is considered as the\naverage score or norm. Scores higher than 50 are better than\nthe general population average for all the eight scales,\nAssessment of depression. Depression was assessed using the\nBeck Depression Inventory (BDI). This instrument was orig-\ninally meant to measure depression in patients with mental\nillness, but it can also be used in a primary care setting. It\nconsists of 21 questions, each question having four possible\nresponses with scores ranging from 0 to 3. The total score of\nthe test is a measure of the severity of depression. In a pri-\nmary care setting, a score higher than 21 is interpreted as\nhaving depression. Studies have provided evidence of the\nvalidity of this tool; it is also considered to have high reli-\nability (Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders, n.d.).\nThe BDI has been validated in some Asian countries such\nas Indonesia (Ginting, N\u00e4ring, van der Veld, Srisayekti, &\n(Kojima, Furukawa, Takahashi, Kawai, & Nagaya, 2002).\nHowever, a review of the literature did not reveal any valida-\ntion studies of the BDI done in the Philippines.\nMeasurement of burnout. To measure burnout, an abbreviated\nMaslach Burnout Inventory (aMBI) was used. This inven-\ntory is the most widely used measure of burnout (Maslach,\nJackson, Leiter, Schaufeli, & Schwab, n.d.). The abbreviated\nform contains only 12 out of the original 22 questions, but\nstill assesses the same three domains, namely, emotional\nexhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment\n(McManus, Smithers, Partridge, Keeling, & Fleming, 2003).\nThe abbreviated form includes an additional three items\nregarding \"satisfaction with medicine,\" which makes it an\nappropriate tool for the present study of medical students. No\nDomantay 3\nvalidation studies of the aMBI or the Maslach Burnout\nInventory in the Philippines were found.\nMeasurement of perceived stress. Stress was measured using\nthe Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). This is the most commonly\nemployed questionnaire to gauge an individual's perception\nof stress (Cohen, n.d.). It consists of 14 items which are eas-\nily understood and hence can be used in the general popula-\ntion. It has been validated in studies, particularly those\ndealing with health status. For example, in Asia, it has been\nvalidated among Chinese cardiac patients who are smokers\n(Leung, Lam, & Chan, 2010). It also has good reliability\nMeasurement of stressful life events. Stressful life events were\nassessed using the Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale (Mind-\nTools, n.d.). This is a list of 43 stressful life events that have\nbeen correlated with illness. Each stressful event corresponds\nto a value known as a life change unit (LCU), depending on\nhow stressful the event is. The sum of the LCUs yields an\nestimate of an individual's stress level and likelihood of ill-\nness. For this particular study, life events that were most\nlikely to apply to medical students in the Philippine setting\nwere included in the questionnaire. For example, divorce\nwas not included as divorce is not allowed in the Philippines.\nHowever, no formal validation of this instrument has been\nconducted in the Philippines.\nMeasurement of other variables.The instrument also con-\ntained self-report items related to the other exposure vari-\nables. These variables were age, sex, civil status, year level,\nacademic performance, pre-medical course, and socioeco-\nnomic status.\nData Management\nThe questionnaires were administered personally by the\nresearcher accompanied by a research assistant. The ques-\ntionnaires were administered at the middle of the second\nsemester. Questionnaires were administered during regular\nclass days and not during major examination periods.\nTo extract the data from the questionnaires, the responses\nwere coded, using number codes to make the data suitable\nfor analysis.\nMicrosoft Excel was used for data entry. Only one data-\nbase was created. The database had one variable for each\nitem in the questionnaire and one record for each respondent.\nEach participant had a unique identifier in the form of an\nidentification number. The Microsoft Excel file was then\nexported to Epi Info 7 for data analysis.\nData Analysis\nThe main outcome variable was the HRQOLscores (continuous\nquantitative). Exposure variables included age (quantitative),\nsex (binary), civil status (unordered categorical), ethnicity\n(unordered categorical), year level (ordered categorical), aca-\ndemic performance (ordered categorical), pre-medical course\n(unordered categorical), socioeconomic status (ordered categor-\nical), depression (continuous quantitative), burnout (continuous\nquantitative), stress levels (continuous quantitative), and stress-\nful life events (continuous quantitative).\nPrior to actual analysis, the data were checked for missing\nvalues. These were appropriately coded, so that the computer\nwill recognize them as missing and thus exclude them from\nthe analysis.\nIn the analysis of the data, the following were carried out:\nbasic descriptive analysis in the form of means and standard\ndeviations of the HRQOL scores along the eight scales; mea-\nsures of association between the HRQOL scores and the\nexposure variables, t test, and null hypotheses and p values\nfor the association between the HRQOL scores and binary\nvariables, that is, sex, one-way ANOVA and null hypotheses,\nand p values for the association between the HRQOL scores\nand unordered and ordered categorical variables. In addition,\nBartlett's test for inequality of population variances was per-\nformed. If the p value from Bartlett's test was less than .05,\nnon-parametric tests such as the Mann\u00adWhitney/Wilcoxon\ntwo-sample test or the Kruskal\u00adWallis test were used instead\nof the t test or ANOVA, respectively. Pearson's correlation\ncoefficient and null hypotheses and p values were used to\ndetermine the association between the HRQOL scores and\nquantitative variables, that is, age, depression (BDI score),\nburnout (aMBI score), stress levels (PSS Score), and stress-\nful life events (Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale score).\nEthical Considerations\nThe research protocol was reviewed and approved by the\nInstitutional Review Board (IRB) of the university prior to\nthe conduct of the study. The review considered both scien-\ntific and ethical aspects of the research. The questionnaire\nhad a cover letter that provided information on the research\nobjectives as well as the significance and importance of the\nstudy. Participation in the study was voluntary and it was\nexplained to the students that they had the option not to\nanswer the questionnaire. Students were not compensated for\ntheir participation. Complete anonymity of the research par-\nticipants was observed as the participants were asked not to\nwrite their names or any identifying marks on the question-\nnaires. Thus, specific information on the questionnaires\ncould not be linked to specific individuals. Access to the data\nwas limited only to the researcher and two research\nassistants.\nResults\nCharacteristics of the Study Participants\nA total of 527 medical students participated in the study rep-\nresenting a response rate of 86.7%. Most were between the\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 2. Psychological Characteristics of the Participants.\nVariable Frequency %\nDepression (based on BDI score)\nStress\nVariable M SD\nBurnout\nNote.

Most of the medical students studied nursing as\ntheir pre-medical coursework (55.6%). The most common\ncombined annual income range was between PhP (Philippine\nThe response rate in this study was 86.7%. Among the\nnon-responders, there was an almost equal number of males\nand females; 40 were males and 41 were females, with a\nmale to female ratio of approximately 1:1. The male to\nfemale ratio in each year of the medical school was as fol-\nratio in the medical school is 1:1.5. Further analysis revealed\nthat there was no significant difference between the non-\nresponders and responders according to sex (p = .10; see\nTable A1 in the appendix). Although it is possible that some\nstudents who refused to participate were symptomatic, for\nexample, with depression, the high response rate makes non-\nresponse bias less likely.\nIn all, 45 students (8.5%) had manifestations of clinical\nmoderate to major stress. The medical students had a low\ntendency for burnout along the domains of personal accom-\nplishment and depersonalization, but had a high tendency for\nburnout along the domain of emotional exhaustion. They\nscored relatively high in terms of satisfaction with medicine\n(Table 2).\nHRQOL of the Medical Students\nThe mean scores in all of the eight domains were above 50,\nalong the areas of physical functioning (85.83) and bodily\npain (69.20), whereas the lowest mean scores were in the\nareas of vitality (51.72) and role limitations due to emotional\nAssociations Between HRQOL and the Exposure\nVariables\nMale students tended to have higher scores than female stu-\ndents along the domains of general health (p = .001), vitality\n(p = .014), and role limitations due to emotional problems\n(p = .004). There were no significant differences in the\nHRQOL scores among the four year levels except for the\narea of social functioning, where fourth-year students had\nlower scores as compared with the other three year levels (p\n< .001). There were also no associations between the HRQOL\nscores and academic performance, except in the domain of\nTable 1.

Those who studied nursing as\ntheir pre-medical course had higher scores in the area of\nbodily pain (p = .046), whereas those who studied medical\ntechnology as their pre-medical course had higher scores in\nthe area of social functioning (p = .008). No associations\nwere observed between the HRQOL scores and age, civil sta-\ntus, and parents' combined annual income (Table 4).\nThere was a striking association observed between the\nHRQOL scores and depression; those who were depressed\nhad significantly lower scores in seven out of the eight\ndomains, as compared with those without depression (p <\n.001). In terms of stress, those with moderate to major stress\nhad lower scores in the areas of role limitations due to physi-\ncal health, general health, and role limitations due to emo-\ntional problems (Table 4). Similar findings were observed in\nterms of perceived stress, presented in Table 5, where nega-\ntive correlation coefficients in all areas of HRQOL except\nbodily pain and social functioning, indicated that higher\nstress levels were related to lower HRQOL scores.\nAs for burnout, emotional exhaustion and depersonaliza-\ntion were negatively correlated with HRQOL scores in six\nout of the eight areas. The relationships were stronger for\nemotional exhaustion as compared with depersonalization.\nThere were slightly positive correlations between satisfac-\ntion with medicine and HRQOL in five out of the eight areas\n(Table 5).\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study showed that overall, medical stu-\ndents had an average to above average HRQOL. It also\nrevealed that students had a higher HRQOL in the scales\nrelated to physical health, that is, physical functioning and\nbodily pain, but scored lower in scales related to mental\nhealth, that is, vitality and role limitations due to emotional\nproblems. Depression, stress, and burnout were associated\nwith lower scores in most of the domains of HRQOL,\nwhereas sex, pre-medical course, academic performance,\nand year level were associated with fewer of the HRQOL\ndomains.\nThe lowest scores were in those domains related to mental\nhealth. This means that medical students have a tendency to\nencounter problems with work or other daily activities as a\nresult of emotional problems and that they may experience\nfeelings of nervousness and depression (Ware, 2003). These\nare likely related to the nature of the medical school experi-\nence, which has been often described as stressful. Medical\nstudents have to undergo frequent periods of adjustment,\nwhich may affect them emotionally. For instance, first-year\nstudents have to adjust to medical school itself, which is\nmore rigorous and intellectually challenging as compared\nwith their pre-medical course. Students in third year have to\nadjust to clinically oriented courses, from the basic science\ncourses of lower years, not to mention the issue of academic\noverload typical of third year. Students in fourth year have to\nadjust to clinical clerkship, wherein full-time clinical train-\ning in the hospital is an entirely different experience from\nteaching and learning in the classroom setting. Moreover,\nthis study also showed that psychological conditions such as\ndepression, stress, and burnout are inversely related to\nHRQOL scores.\nThere are other issues that might stress medical students.\nAlthough family members are generally supportive, due to\nthe cultural norm of close family ties in the Philippines, they\ncan also be a source of stress, especially for students who\nhave family problems, or who are married and/or with chil-\ndren, who may be struggling to balance family life and medi-\ncal school training. Financial problems can also be a source\nof stress, as medical education is expensive and scholarship\ngrants for medical education are very limited in the\nPhilippines.\nThe findings of the current study are consistent with those\nof Voltmer, Rosta, Aasland, and Spahn (2010) who, as a part\nof their article, studied the HRQOL of medical students in\nGermany and discovered that the students had lower scores\nin the domain of mental health as compared with physical\nhealth. The results are also in agreement with those of Dyrbye\net al. (2007) who, also as a part of their article, determined\nthe quality of life of medical students in the United States.\nTheir students also had relatively low mental quality of life\nscores.\nHowever, medical students are able to perform all types of\nphysical activities, even the most vigorous, without limita-\ntions due to health, and that they do not experience pain or\nthere are no limitations due to pain (Ware, 2003). A possible\nexplanation for this might be that the great majority of medi-\ncal students are apparently physically fit young adults, as\nattested by their annual medical-physical examinations.\nStudents have to undergo these physical examinations\nTable 3. HRQOL of the Medical Students.\nDomain M SD\nNote. HRQOL = health-related quality of life; PF = physical functioning;\nRP = role-physical; BP = bodily pain; GH = general health; VT = vitality; SF\n= social functioning; RE = role-emotional; MH = mental health.\n6 SAGE Open\ntogether with basic laboratory tests prior to enrollment.\nMoreover, chronic diseases which may bring about pain and\nphysical limitations are uncommon in this age group.\nOur study also showed that males had significantly higher\nscores than females in the domains of general health and\nvitality. This means that males have a tendency to evaluate\ntheir personal health as excellent and that they always feel\nenergetic, as compared with females. This is in keeping with\nthe cultural norm in the Philippines where men are generally\nconsidered to be the stronger sex, thus men perceive them-\nselves to be so. The present study also revealed that male\nmedical students had significantly higher scores in the\ndomain of role limitations due to emotional problems as\ncompared with female medical students. A higher score\nmeans that there are less interferences with work or daily\nactivities as a result of emotional problems. This is again\nconsistent with the cultural norm in the Philippines where\nmen are supposed to be less emotional than women. Thus,\nmale medical students in general do not let emotions or emo-\ntional problems hinder their performance in their studies and\ntraining. These findings are similar to those of the study of\nParo et al. (2010) that female students had lower HRQOL\nscores than males. Jamali et al. (2013) also established that\nmale gender was significantly associated with higher\nHRQOL scores as compared with females.\nRegarding the factors associated with HRQOL, our find-\nings are similar to those of Paro et al. (2010) who found out\nthat female medical students and those with depression had\nlower HRQOL scores. Dyrbye et al. (2007) likewise reported\nthat burnout and depression were major factors that influ-\nenced medical students' quality of life. In addition, Swami et\nal. (2007) observed that in Malaysia, life satisfaction, which\nis used interchangeably with quality of life, was inversely\nrelated to depression. Arslan, Ayranci, Unsal, and Arslantas\nTable 4.

Among Pakistani medi-\ncal students, physical functioning, general health perception,\nvitality, and social functioning for second-year students were\nsignificantly less than the other classes. In the present study,\nsocial functioning was highest among third-year students\nand lowest among fourth-year students. This is because stu-\ndents in the third year have already adjusted to life in medical\nschool and have already established friendships among\nclassmates. Thus, they are able to interact with each other\nand socialize on weekends. However, fourth-year students\nare in clinical clerkship wherein they spend most of their\ntime in the hospital. There is little time for socialization with\nfriends and after work they would rather rest and sleep in\npreparation for the next hospital duty the following day. This\nis similar to the findings of Paro et al. (2010) and Jamali et al.\n(2013) where students in the highest year level had lower\nHRQOL scores as compared with lower year levels.\nIt is interesting to note that 45 medical students (8.5%)\nhad depression based on the BDI score. Further analysis of\nItem Number 9 on the BDI, which assesses suicidal thoughts,\nrevealed that 54 students checked the response \"I have\nthoughts of killing myself, but I would not carry them out\";\n3 students responded that \"I would like to kill myself\"; and 2\nstudents responded that \"I would kill myself if I had the\nchance.\" This has implications for counseling services in a\nmedical school. Such services are available at our universi-\nty's Guidance Center, and the head of the center personally\nattends to medical students who seek consultation. However,\nvery few medical students avail of these services, most prob-\nably due to lack of time owing to their heavy class schedule\nand busy hospital rotations.\nThe strength of this study is that it made use of well-\nestablished and validated data gathering instruments such as\nthe SF-36, BDI, aMBI, PSS, and Holmes and Rahe Stress\nScale. The use of such tools minimized information bias.\nThis study also had a relatively high response rate, which\ncould have minimized selection bias. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first study on the HRQOL of medical\nstudents in the Philippines.\nHowever, this study also had certain limitations. As in\nother studies employing questionnaires, recall bias is a pos-\nsibility. In determining the factors associated with HRQOL,\nconfounding was not assessed as the main objective of the\nstudy was to describe the status of the medical students'\nHRQOL. Furthermore, the present study only involved stu-\ndents from just one medical school in the Philippines. This\nlimits the study's generalizability. The results may not neces-\nsarily be extrapolated to students from other medical schools\nin the country or to those from other countries. It is important\nto bear in mind that medical schools vary in terms of the\nnature of their curricula, for instance, traditional versus prob-\nlem-based learning, duration of the medical course, as well\nas school and hospital atmosphere and environment. Medical\nstudents from different schools may also vary according to\nsociodemographic characteristics such as age and sex distri-\nbution, and other personality characteristics. All these may\ninfluence their HRQOL.\nIn conclusion, medical students in our school are gener-\nally in a satisfactory state of functional health and well-\nbeing, but have a lower level of mental health as compared\nwith physical health. Depression, stress, and burnout reduce\nthe medical students' state of health. The results of this study\nhave implications for medical educators in our school. It\ncould provide a basis for the development of student well-\nness programs and activities. It is imperative that counseling\nservices and mentoring programs for medical students be\nstrengthened and enhanced. Improving the well-being of\nfuture physicians will hopefully translate to better quality of\ncare for the patients they are meant to serve.\nFuture research on the HRQOL of medical students is\nneeded. This study may be replicated by other medical schools\nin the country. Further investigations could utilize a longitudi-\nnal design rather than a cross-sectional design to trace changes\nin the students'health and well-being over time.\nTable 5.
