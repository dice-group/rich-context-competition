It addresses (i) the ways in which the\nmethodology was a response to the need for constructive, transformative dialogue through use\nof repeated focus groups in a design interspersing dialogic and reflective spaces; and (ii) how\nstimulus materials for the focus groups involved imaginative and creative interactions with data.\nParticular innovations in the blending of narrative and thematic analyses and data generation and\nanalysis processes are explored, specifically the creative use of metaphor as stimulus and the\nplayful adaptation of I-poems from the Listening Guide approach as writing and performance. In\nreflecting on these methodological turns we also reflect on creativity as an interpretive lens. The\npaper is an invitation for further methodological dialogue and development.\n",

While for\nsome (such as Coffey, 2011) innovation is crucial and for others (e.g. Travers, 2009) it\nbrings the dangers of poor research and fads, new research problems may demand solu-\ntions that push researchers to, if not outright innovate, at least experiment with new\npotentials for methods developed for purpose. Wiles et al. (2013: 19) refer to `the need\nto develop and experiment with methodological innovations that have the potential to\naddress new and emerging research questions', alongside `demonstrating and persuading\nthe broader social science community of the affordance and credibility of new methods\nin relation to other existing methods'. Moreover, these authors highlight the pressures to\ndisseminate innovations before they have been rigorously critiqued and allowed to\nmature into something robust. In this paper we discuss our own experimentation with\nmethod/ology, which was in part driven by need and in part driven by a desire to follow\nCoffey and Atkinson's (1996) advice, and Edwards and Weller's (2012) example, to be\nplayful with analytic methods and angles. The intention is to kindle discussion of the\npotential affordances of this kind of design and these kinds of adaptations of emergent\nmethods so that they might be developed further if they are useful to others, or perhaps\nstimulate further critique.\nThe paper is organised such that we first present the research context and the aims\nand needs of the study in question. We then discuss the design developed for the study\nand go on to the particular methods as part of this, discussing their rationale, roles and\npotential.\nThe research context\nThe context for the methodological exploration discussed in this article was a study\nfunded by the Economic and Social Research Council in the UK, which was aimed at\nbuilding knowledge and capacity in inclusive research with people with learning disabil-\nities (Nind and Vinha, 2012, 2014). In the process of securing funding and before recruit-\ning a research fellow for the project Melanie had proposed to meet this aim by taking\nstock of the knowledge base, producing guidance on the issues and challenges, develop-\ning materials and case studies, and producing criteria for quality in inclusive research.\nTaking stock of the knowledge base and understanding quality in inclusive research\nthough, were particularly complex and sensitive tasks demanding a creative response.\nThe term inclusive research in the field of learning disabilities was adopted by\nWalmsley and Johnson (2003) to allow for the continuity and reciprocity between par-\nticipatory research \u00ad actively involving people with learning disabilities in decision-\nmaking and conduct of research \u00ad and emancipatory research \u00ad which is under full\ncontrol of people with learning disabilities and in their interests. It was also intended to\nbe a more accessible term and a more flexible concept, free of some of the dogma\nattached to these other concepts. Nonetheless, Walmsley and Johnson (2003: 16) are\nexplicit about the principles on which inclusive research is based: that it `must address\nissues which really matter to people with learning disabilities, and which ultimately leads\nto improved lives for them', `must access and represent their views and experiences', and\nreflect `that people with learning disabilities need to be treated with respect by the\nresearch community'. This approach to research is a response to the desire to address the\npast wrongs of research that regarded people with learning disabilities as having nothing\nworthwhile to say, thereby making them at best `passive recipients of well-intentioned\nacademics ... and, at worst, dehumanized objects whose actions were observed and\ncounted with no recognition of their humanity' (Walmsley and Johnson, 2003: 11).\nDiscussing people's moves into inclusive research and what makes it good inclusive\nresearch, therefore, involved entering heated political territory.\nThe original motivation in seeking funding to conduct the research related to Melanie's\nintellectual curiosity, both as a methodologist and as someone whose substantive research\nconcerns have been in the realms of learning disability, social interaction and inclusion.\nThe moral case for inclusive research with people with learning disabilities she found\ncompelling. Yet she also understood from experience that research can be valid and\nemancipatory without always being inclusive (see also Danieli and Woodhams, 2005),\nand therefore inclusive research required better understanding. While some commission-\ners of research (particularly Joseph Rowntree Foundation and Heritage Lottery Fund in\nthe UK) and much of the learning disability research community are convinced about the\nvalue of inclusive research, it is still rarely regarded as producing the best evidence \u00ad\nmore often positioned alongside `real', quality research \u00ad a necessary adjunct. The rheto-\nric around inclusive research has also reflected a `failure to grapple honestly' (Walmsley\nand Johnson, 2003: 16) with the most sensitive questions about the challenges, and this\nneeds to be recognised for investment in inclusive research to be wise investment. Some\nof Melanie's research had been more inclusive, some less so, and she wanted to be in\ndialogue with other researchers, both those with learning disability labels and those with\nacademic positions, who could reflect on a wider range of experiences of inclusive\nresearch.\nIt was evident that the taking stock could not be done without problematising some-\nthing that was prone to being glorified, though constructive questions had been raised\nabout whether the primary issue is the quality of the participation or the quality of the\nresearch (Greene, 2009; Freeman and Mathison, 2009), whether participatory research is\nnecessarily `ethically or morally superior'or `more enabling'(Holland et al., 2008: 1), or\nwhether the participation of people with learning disabilities is always meaningful and\ngenuine (Aspis, 2000). It was timely, therefore, to try to un-stifle the debate and `chal-\nlenge certain orthodoxies and assumptions in order to clarify what inclusive research is\nand how and where it can be applied' (Walmsley and Johnson, 2003: 12). This meant\naccepting the argument of Grant and Ramcharan (2007) that inclusive research had come\nto the end of an initial phase in which practical knowledge had been gained, and it would\nbe useful to agree the elements of that knowledge and enter a new phase that would\ninclude asking `how the knowledge claims of inclusive research can be assessed and\nauthenticated' and `whether good science and good inclusive research practice can be\nAdventures with focus group design\nThe rationale for choosing focus groups as the essence of the research design related to\na desire to create vibrant interactive spaces in which best use could be made of\nconstructive friction within the field. This, in turn, was influenced by reading of Freire\n(1970) and the methodological translation endeavoured by Hilra (Vinha, 2011) in her\ndoctoral study, which embedded the Freirean dialectic of the praxis (action-reflection) in\na continuous reflexive movement. A crucial idea was that facilitating dialogue would not\njust unveil reality but allow those communicating their reality to know it critically and to\nengage in re-creating knowledge in a communal way, transforming their understandings\nof themselves and their work. In challenging certain orthodoxies that had grown up we\nneeded to challenge the concept of any actor in the research being an expert knower\n(based on academic knowing or the expert by experience idea); instead we sought to\nposition everyone as `emergent becomings', `always-unfinished subjects-in-the-\nmaking', never `fully knowing, competent and rational' (Gallacher and Gallagher, 2008:\n511). In this way we could all learn and benefit from focus group dialogue. Morgan,\nFellows and Guevara (2008) refer to the relatively short history of the use of focus groups\nin social science research, the proliferation in use of them, and some emergent alterna-\ntives to traditional focus group approaches. In face-to-face focus groups, they argue,\nthere is `a self-conscious movement beyond the minimal goal of producing the kind of\ninteraction that has manifest value as data for social science research'(2008: 191). It was\ninteraction we needed, but this came with considerable challenges because of the sensi-\ntivities associated with power dynamics in inclusive research. Focus groups offered an\nobvious route for interaction, but were potentially fraught.\nThe aim was to involve a range of inclusive researchers and for the research process\nto be dialogical \u00ad listening to and engaging with a range of researcher voices, reflective\n\u00ad embracing the praxis of naming the world collaboratively, and transformative \u00ad re-\nlocating authority away from the individual researcher or researched and instead embed-\nding it in the interactive space between them. This meant the need for dialogic spaces to\nbe safe enough, but not too safe. Following StPierre's (2009) argument that thoughts as\nwell as voices constitute data, the dialogic spaces needed to be interspersed with reflec-\ntive spaces. In the initial planning Melanie was drawn to adapting Hilra's (Vinha, 2011)\ndialogic inquiry cycles and to using Freire's (1970) concept of dialogue as creative and\nliberating. There was a need to `design for emergence' (Morgan et al., 2008: 191) so that\nthe research process was not imposed on the dialogic partners but responsive to them. We\nmight have managed this within focus groups by structuring open-ended questions either\nside of specific focus topics, but this would not have given any of us the space to reflect\nand to transform our thinking. We therefore needed a repeated or reconvened focus group\ndesign (Morgan et al., 2008) in which participants could bring thinking done in and since\nprevious dialogic encounters into later focus groups, enriching the dialogue and giving\nthem more control. The reflective spaces between a series of focus group encounters\nwould also allow time for the creation of stimulus materials to bring to each focus group\nencounter that could in some way enable ideas to flow between focus groups.\nThe repeated focus group design seemed to answer the call for a methodology in\nwhich inclusive researchers could engage in `deliberative, dialogic and democratic prac-\nsuch focus groups can represent a non-hierarchical participatory approach, which is\n`more than just an exercise in capacity building or the production of \"relevant\" research\n... it also produces alternative knowledge and more effective ways of understanding\ncomplex situations and relationships'. The question remained, though, as to how the\nfocus groups could un-stifle debate and talk about things that were difficult to talk about\n(e.g. whether there are limits to what inclusive research can achieve, or to who can be\nincluded in it, and how it maps on to other quality criteria in research). The answer came\nin developing the strategy of Madriz (2000) and Haw (2010) when addressing similar\npolitical and pragmatic challenges about who can speak safely with whom and about\nwhat in research with marginalised groups. This meant, somewhat riskily, rejecting a\ngrowing convention in inclusive research that everything in the research had to be done\ntogether and instead bringing together separate groups of inclusive researchers who were\nrelatively homogenous in their relationship to research and who might feel able to talk\nopenly together: a group comprising researchers with learning disabilities who led and\nconducted their own research, a group of researchers with and without learning disabili-\nties who worked together collaboratively as co-researchers, and a group of academic\nresearchers who used participatory approaches to actively engage people with learning\ndisabilities in research. For the purposes of emergent design and responsive, transforma-\ntive dialogue, these groups needed to have stable membership and build trust over time\n(three encounters each), so that they could engage, and re-engage, with ideas from their\nown and each other's dialogic encounters. To add another perspective a single focus\ngroup of funders and policy maker supporters of inclusive research was added. The\nmethodological emphasis was on non-judgmental group interviews where those with a\ncommon interest could share thinking without needing to reach consensus (Krueger and\nThe design was for the main focus groups to meet on three occasions in a sequence of\nthe encounters allowing each group of insight-rich participants to take a turn in setting\nthe agenda informing the questioning route for the other groups. Focus groups were to\nlast two hours and the questioning route was structured conversationally from the initial\ninvitation to start talking and share experiences into transitional and key open-ended\nquestions of what makes inclusive research inclusive, challenging, possible, and of high\nquality. Ending questions were designed to promote considered reflection on the discus-\nsions and to ensure critical concerns had been voiced. The dialogic and reflective process\nwas to culminate in a plenary event in which the different focus groups would join to\ndiscuss the key themes arising from the research. This reinforced the inbuilt ongoing\nvalidation process in which ideas were revisited, and it allowed for a final discussion\nabout the meaning we had given to the participant-researchers' discussions so that the\nmost salient features could be checked and further built upon.\nInevitably the reality of the iterative focus groups was messier than the design implied.\nThe planned sequence of encounters was interrupted by practical problems with agreeing\nmeeting dates. Even being flexible with dates, membership was only about two-thirds\nstable across encounters and the size of groups fluctuated. To ensure we heard suffi-\nciently from learning disabled researchers and to facilitate ease of travel we included an\nadditional group of learning disabled researchers and their supporters. It may be that the\npreparatory work with them was insufficient, however, as there were tensions in the first\nencounter of this group in which some of the participant-researchers and supporters\nangrily asserted their authoritative knowledge about making ideas and consent forms\naccessible and research inclusive. Trust and rapport were lacking amongst those more\nready to speak than to listen. A small group worked between meetings to provide feed-\nback on how the focus group could work better and indeed a stronger sense of dialogue\nwas achieved next time. Other groups were dialogic from the start, evident in the tran-\nscript statements such as `I understand, I agree with you', `yes, I always felt that', `I\nreally enjoyed listening to ...', `I was thinking while you were talking' and `I thought\nthat was a good metaphor'.\nThe role of stimulus materials\nMorgan et al. (2008) argue that, compared with other fields, such as market research,\nsocial science researchers rely heavily on pure discussion of interview questions. The\nalternative they suggest is to use more stimulus materials \u00ad pictures, stories and so on \u00ad\nas a basis for discussion. Stimulus materials are created outside of the focus group and\nintroduced by the moderator or created more emergently (as in their concept mapping\nexample) generated by the group. Melanie was led to incorporate stimulus materials in\nthe original design for two key reasons. First, we would be involving people with learn-\ning disabilities who might find tangible materials aided their expression and understand-\ning of ideas. Moving away from pure talk might help to facilitate their active engagement\nin discussion. This took on further importance when Hilra became involved in making\nthe design a lived reality as her earlier methodological work with (learning disabled)\nchildren (Vinha, 2011) had been underpinned by verbal and visual metaphor, through\nwhich she had created enabling spaces for dialogue with her participants. Second, the\nresearch necessitated exploring ways of allowing for different perspectives to be heard\nand shaped in interaction with others. It was important that the ideas discussed in the\nfocus groups remained somewhat fluid so that participants did not feel driven to defend\ntheir positions, making them entrenched. In our taking stock of inclusive research we\nwanted to be able to communicate its complexity and diversity at a moment in history,\nrather than fix it. For the repeated, stratified focus group design to be effective it was\nnecessary for ideas to flow across and between focus groups without making the discus-\nsions feel too repetitive. For this reason, the questioning routes for each group needed to\ncommunicate something of the interim analysis, something that communicated effec-\ntively while not being too polished, and this required stimulus materials.\nThree main types of stimulus materials were used. The most straightforward and\ntherefore not extensively discussed further here was of the concept mapping type and\nused in the single occasion focus group of funders and policy makers. There were two\nlots of stimuli incorporated into the questioning route: one was an oral introduction about\nemergent themes in the research so far, by a researcher with learning disabilities and her\nco-researcher and supporter (Lou Townson and Chloe Chapman-Brown),1 offering their\nperspective. This was politically important in the spirit of nothing about us without us; it\nmeant that the idea of including people with learning disabilities in the conduct of\nresearch was not being discussed in the absence of anyone with learning disabilities or\nthe ideas of researchers with learning disabilities. This desire to set a respectful tone was\nin tension somewhat with the desire for safe spaces and discussion that was not stifled;\nmany of the decisions related to participatory or inclusive research can be about trade-\noffs (Edwards and Alexander, 2011). Nonetheless, the introduction made the focus group\nfeel alive with important issues and critical and reflective engagement was therefore\nhigh. The other stimulus was the things about inclusive research that individuals in the\ngroup thought were important, which they were asked to write on cards at the start and\nadd to if they so wished. The concept mapping, which happened later in the discussion\ninvolved physically organising these named elements into a diamond ranking. The dia-\nmond visual structure for this kind of exercise supports thinking about the hierarchy of\nconcepts and generates dialogue about the complexities and nuances (Wall et al., 2013).\nThe other types of stimulus materials involved more experimentation with adapting ideas\nfrom research for new purposes. First we discuss the use of a playful metaphor as stimu-\nlus, and second the use of a kind of I-poem idea taken from the Listening Guide approach\nMetaphor: if inclusive research was a cake ...\nMetaphors are accepted foci for qualitative researchers, but usually those used in every-\nday language or those used as a feature of thought in interpretation and theory-building\n(Todd and Harrison, 2008), such as Denzin and Lincoln's (2008) bricoleur or quilt maker\nand Janesick's (2003) choreography. Metaphor involves referring to, or understanding,\n`one kind of thing by means of another, thereby highlighting possible new aspects of a\nkind' (Kvale and Brinkman, 2009: 48). In conceptual metaphors `the abstract notion [for\nexample] of life (the target domain) is explained through the more concrete physical\nexperience of [for example] a journey (the source domain)' (Todd and Harrison, 2008:\n481). The stimulus material involved exploring the target domain of inclusive research\nthrough the more concrete source domain of a cake. Indeed participant-researchers\nplayed around with ideas about the ingredients of the cake (inclusive research) and what\nmade the cake good (quality in inclusive research). The first focus group to use this\nstimulus material, which involved both the idea and tangible visual materials represent-\ning a cake and its ingredients (see Figure 1) were the group of researchers with learning\ndisabilities and their supporters and this was their second of three encounters. The physi-\ncal products of their manipulation and labelling of ingredients were photographed to\ncreate stimulus materials for the focus group that met next, a different group of learning\ndisabled and academic researchers who worked collaboratively. This, then, was a mani-\nfestation of our `serious play'(Gauntlett, 2007) with techniques within the overall design.\nThe outcome of introducing the cake metaphor stimulus was some very rich dialogue.\nOne participant-researcher in particular, Carl Bridden, was enthused by the idea and\nparticularly liberated to think with this conceptual tool. In manipulating the visual pieces,\nhe commented, `The jam is going to be us, because we're on the middle of the cake'. The\ntechnique triggered a whole list of ingredients of inclusive research (a topic, us/people,\nbackground work, translators, money), but also some playfulness with ideas. When Hilra\nasked `who makes up the \"us\"?', Durbali Roy responded `The jam factory!' When Hilra\nclarified `Who are the people?', Becca Cooper replied `strawberries, raspberries!'When\nwe discussed academics as possible ingredients and Melanie asked, `Are you happy that\nthey are in this cake?' Becca replied `you are university jam'. The enthusiasm amongst\nthe learning disabled participant-researchers was matched by, perhaps aided by, the\nenthusiasm of those there to support them. When asked about the recipe for bad inclusive\nresearch, one supporter (Julie Davies) leapt on the metaphorical idea responding, `It\nwould be all filling and no substance'. As well as making verbal contributions people\nwere moving the images, labelling with pens and thinking. As moderators we were both\nin the moment and reflecting on the moment: the transcript records a check `Are we\ngoing too fast, Michael?' and response `I'm thinking' and we recall evaluating then and\nafterwards the ability of the stimulus materials to provoke and yet still to fail to act as a\nleveller when people process information at different speeds and in different ways.\nThe focus group members discussing the metaphor somewhat second hand were dis-\ncussing other people's ideas generated by the stimulus. Nonetheless, they took the origi-\nnal metaphor stimulus, in interaction with the outcomes from it to date, and breathed new\nlife into it. They generated their own conceptual metaphors, talking about the different\ntypes of cakes (inclusive research) that could be made depending on how the ingredients\nwere put together, about commissioned research as `factory made' and life story and\npartnership research being more `home made' (Ian Buchanan). Chloe Brownlee-\nChapman introduced the metaphor of `sprinkles' used as decorative elements and the\n`baking tray' as the academic researcher who `holds things together'. Jan Walmsely\nadded another dimension: `we need to think about what we say to funders about the taste\nof this cake that is superior to a cake that is made without the inclusive ingredient'.\nMelanie Chapman added the idea of the cake turning out differently to how you and the\nfunders expected it to be. The metaphor then, was an effective stimulus for deep thinking\nand for interaction between ideas.\nFigure 1. The cake metaphor.\nIterative data analysis: playing with I-poems\nInforming the choice of stimulus materials and their use was the importance of themes\narising from earlier discussions providing a focus for our talk, but equally, the impor-\ntance of such themes not overpowering the individual and collective narratives or work-\ning against fresh ideas. The ongoing iterative analysis in the reflective spaces between\nthe dialogic spaces, therefore, had complex layers of work to do in shaping the stimulus\nmaterials and questioning routes as the research progressed. This meant using a `range of\ninterconnected interpretive practices' to `get a better understanding', each practice mak-\ning `the world visible in a different way' (Denzin and Lincoln, 2005: 4). The analysis\ncomprised a process of coding themes alongside identifying core narratives. The former\nwas about `bring[ing] order to experience by seeing individual things as belonging to a\ncategory' (Polkinghorne, 1995: 10) while interest in the narratives was in their power to\ndescribe `what happened' intermingled with `emotions, thoughts and interpretations'\n(Chase, 2005: 656) and in not reducing people's lives and stories to data in an objectify-\ning way. Thematic analysis involved assigning codes (thematic labels) (e.g. ways of\nworking together, research topics, outcomes) and sub-codes (e.g. outcomes/impact, out-\ncomes/data, outcomes/report, outcomes/DVD) to parts of the transcripts. The more\ndetailed sub-codes were later grouped into more coherent groups (e.g. outcome impact,\noutcome process, outcome product format). In the interpretative process some codes\nwere assigned greater importance and others were merely logged for transparency. The\nthemes culminated in units of meaning that were checked in the final plenary focus\ngroup. A less standard approach was applied to the narrative part of the analysis.\nIn common with narrative researchers we were viewing `narratives as verbal action\n\u00ad as doing or accomplishing something' (Chase, 2005: 657) such as explaining, inform-\ning, confirming or challenging. For the narrative analysis we worked two processes\nsimultaneously; one was highlighting the statements made in the first person (e.g. `I'm in\nthe Work in Progress team', `I want to make a difference', `I've seen more exciting\nthings', `I look back', `I wish I had') and the other was assigning a narrative code iden-\ntifying what the narrative was about or what it was for (e.g. narratives about belonging,\nnarratives about motivation, witnessing narratives, reflecting narratives). This working\nof the transcript data felt important in terms of being true to what was being said and to\nthe dialogic process. It was less clear, initially, how the narrative analysis would be used.\nThe idea of coding the first person statements came from the literature on the voice-\ncentred relational method/Listening Guide (Brown and Gilligan, 1992) and specifically\nthe parts about I-poems (Edwards and Weller, 2012; Gilligan et al., 2003). The Listening\nGuide is an approach to analysis of narrative data that counters the implicit assumption\nthat `a person's \"story\" is singular and transparent' (Sorsoli and Tolman, 2008: 495) and\ninstead seeks to listen to the multiple voices threaded through, thus using multiple inter-\npretive readings to get at the underlying complexity. The approach was developed for\nmore psychodynamic work and for working with the transcripts of individual interviews,\nneither of which related to this context. Nonetheless the concepts of plot and voice were\ninteresting in the light of the repeated references the participant-researchers in this study\nmade to their identities, learning journeys, experiences and hopes. Gilligan and col-\nleagues use the concept of contrapuntal voices \u00ad which are distinct and working with and\nagainst each other to infuse meaning \u00ad and this echoed through the reading of the focus\ngroup transcripts which concerned dynamics and story form as well as content.\nThe construction of I-poems in the Listening Guide process involves first, identifying\nparts narrated in the first person (or second person when linguistically it is used to repre-\nsent oneself) with their immediately associated relevant text, and second, taking these\nsections out of their original context and into an unpunctuated exact order list. These are\nplaced on separate lines to resemble a poem (Gilligan et al., 2003). The original purpose\nof constructing I-poems was analytical, and we had also focused on I-statements as a\nway of not losing the sense of individual voices amongst the noise of the concepts and\nleitmotifs. We were using them iteratively to build a picture, and thus they were shaping\nas well as being shaped by the dialogic process. For Edwards and Weller (2012: 203) an\nI-poem analysis `draws attention to the research subject's subjectivity \u00ad how they under-\nstand and speak about themselves, it also produces a particular analytic ontology \u00ad how\nthe researcher is placed in relation to the subject and their social reality'. Similarly, we\nvalued this reflexive potential regarding the mix of emotional and intellectual responses\nand the dynamic of speaking and listening. Inclusive research is ultimately about the\npeople we want to include and so people are important as well as ideas.\nSmith (2013) constructed I-poems from interview and participant diary data, thus\nadapting the process. He, though, like Edwards and Weller (2012) retained use of Gilligan\nand colleagues' four steps of sequential listening: listening to the plot (and the research-\ner's response to it); constructing I-poems to really attend to the voices; listening for\ncontrapuntal voices; and composing an analysis. We were much less focused on the rig-\norous attention to this analytic process and much more concerned with the emergent\npotential of I-poems in the iterative process of feeding ideas and stories across focus\ngroups. These, could perhaps tell much about how people were story-ing their involve-\nment with inclusive research and thus bring previous focus groups' discussions alive in\na new focus group context. This idea for an innovative use of I-poems was recorded in\nMelanie's fieldnotes with the capital letters and explanation mark suggesting an `aha'\nmoment: `IDEA! Maybe use poems for Leeds and Manchester [focus groups]'. The idea\nthen took on an important dimension in the design as a vehicle to communicate, across\nfocus groups, key ideas and narratives using the participant-researchers' own multiple\nvoices to lay bare the multiple, interwoven ways of experiencing inclusive research and\ntelling inclusive research.\nOur use of I-poems had a relationship with inclusive research that was full of almost\nparadoxical tensions. It felt democratic that ideas would be presented in participant-\nresearchers' exact words and narrating their experiences of inclusive research offered\npromise of transformation. Yet the poems were shaped by our (Melanie and Hilra's)\nanalysis and construction and the power we held in the research. The words were not raw\ndata but situated, textual, representing a certain kind of telling (Silverman, 1993). Our\nresearcher voices were neither authoritative nor muted but more interactive in Chase's\n(2005) terms. The I-poems were less `gazing at' the participants and more `standing\nalongside' them (Edwards and Weller, 2012: 215), yet still interpreting their (and our)\nsocial realities. Byrne et al. (2009) saw the participatory research potential of the\nListening Guide and used the clear steps to make the analysis process accessible to the\nearly school leavers they were involving as researchers, but this was not our goal. We\nwere more concerned with a new use for I-poems as co-constructed products with a\nstimulatory role in the ongoing cyclical process of dialogue. By working from focus\ngroup transcripts, instead of one person's multiple voices being teased out it was as if the\nvoices of multiple participants became one. We were always cautious about writing\nabout the participant-researchers, doing research on them, but it was inclusive research\nand not people that was the primary object of inquiry. Like StPierre's older women\ninvolved in her research on reflexivity, these people were present in the texts, every-\nwhere in the analysis, `provocateurs' of fresh ideas and like her we did not want to `be\nThe new function for the I-poems demanded some poetic license be taken with the\nListening Guide process. There was an innovative dimension in that the poems would\nneed to be read aloud, in part because not all the participant-researchers would be able to\nread them for themselves, but more because this would mean the stimulus material was\nexperienced as a group `experience of consumption' (Leavy, 2008: 344; original empha-\nsis). There was therefore an element of performance to consider, though this was not the\nfirst performance, the narratives themselves being `socially situated interactive perfor-\nmances' of `the self, experience, and reality' (Chase, 2005: 657). The I-statements were\nidentified and grouped under themes, for example:\nWho we are\nI'm a co-researcher\nI'm from People First\nI'm a parent with a learning disability\nI'm a Lecturer at the Open University\nI'm a part-time research student\nI've been working... for a very long time\nI am Lisa\nThis is me and the research I've done\nI am good at speaking up\nand\nOur beginnings\nI spent the first 15 years of my working life\nI'd never done a project myself\nMy first days\nI didn't know anything\nI started looking at history\nFrom asking questions I got into research\nI'd always had a belief\nI heard the lottery were funding\nI went off to do a PhD\nI ended up going to Helsinki\nWe were breaking with Listening Guide rules in doing this thematic re-organising of\nI-statements and then in not presenting them in the order in which they appeared, but as\nMelanie reflected: `I was the narrator now, it was I who was creating the sense of order\nin the material. I was also adding stanzas as part of the creative process, making the\npoems more coherent and appealing to the ear':\nOur journeys\nI started off\nI ended up\nI didn't intend to be a researcher\nI was working with\nI got involved\nI joined the research team\nI learnt something\nI started asking loads of questions\nI decided\nI think I stumbled into inclusive research by making mistakes\nAs the I-poem dimension of audience took hold then so did the dimension of writing as\na method of knowing. Richardson and StPierre (2005: 959) maintain that qualitative\nresearchers have latterly found `writing as a method of inquiry to be a viable way in\nwhich to learn about themselves and their research topic'. In experimenting with writing\ndata as `a poetic representation' we were `using writing as a method of knowing'\n(Richardson and StPierre, 2005: 974), one of the explorations Richardson recommends.\nThis was, as Brady (2005) discusses, complementing rather than replacing other ways of\nknowing. Even though the words did not come from us, writing \u00ad or composing \u00ad the\nI-poems gave a new perspective on the data. Writing being research fits with a core idea\nin qualitative research of the researcher being the research instrument making this more\ncomfortable than it might have been.\nIn selecting and reorganising some of the phrases from the transcripts we could be\nsaid, in the poststructural reading of Richardson and StPierre (2005), to be creating a new\nform of narrative writing, less reflecting the focus groups'social realities and more inter-\npreting them to create new meaning. Just as the participant-researchers' meaning was\n`dependent on the discourses available to them' (Richardson and StPierre, 2005: 961) so\nthese new narrative poems were located in the cultural norms of self-advocacy and\nresearch as a site of politically sensitive struggle. Yet they could play a role in the desired\nprocess of helping us all to know inclusive research afresh, and perhaps also to `under-\nstand ourselves reflexively as persons writing from particular positions at specific times'\nOur reflections\nI look back\nI always remember\nI thought at the time\nI didn't say it\nI wish I had\nI wish you had too\nI was entirely wrong\nPeople have accused me\nIt made me think\nI surprise myself\nI've realised that\nI learnt a lot about\nWe are still learning\nStPierre reflects, `for me, writing is thinking, writing is analysis, writing is indeed a\nseductive and tangled method of inquiry' (Richardson and StPierre, 2005: 967; original\nemphasis). She argues that `language cannot serve as a transparent medium that mirrors,\n\"represents\", and contains the world' (2005: 968); it doesn't `simply transport meaning'\n(2005: 968) so that we might work towards consensus. Thus `interpretation is not the\ndiscovery of meaning in the world but rather the \"introduction of meaning\" (Spivak,\nmaking, which is no longer a neutral activity of expression that simply matches word to\nUltimately the I-poems brought creative and analytical processes closer together, inter-\ntwining process and product as Richardson and StPierre (2005) describe. By `performing'\nthe poems at the start of a focus group we understood that they were being judged for their\naesthetic merit and emotional impact as well as their ability to re-present our discussions.\nSome responses to hearing the poems were about the form itself. Lou Townson (self-\nadvocate researcher) responded: `What a good idea of [.], what a good way of doing it.\nSometimes, if you do transcripts [they] can be a bit long, but actually putting like that\ncondenses everything.'She then added warm approval: `I like that, it's an idea that I never\nthought about, but, I like that'. Malcolm Eardley, another self-advocate researcher, made\nan effortful response to sum up the nature of the thing and its impact: `That bit it's just like\na story. It's very [.]. When they get ... writing like this, in put[ting] word[s] together as a\npoem, putting words together, what happens and what they are doing, it's just getting the\nfeeling of ... the poems together'. In another focus group, Dubarli Roy, a learning disa-\nbled researcher commented on the lyrical aesthetics: `I quite liked it, because feel all we\nwent, you got a voice as you have a voice, and you want to sing a song. Sometimes you\nwant to learn how to sing a song, you want to know how to do poems, and it's really a\ngood choice.' Gareth, in contrast, observed `They're not Pam Ayres'!\nA performance exists primarily in the live moment, and its ephemeral quality (Leavy,\n2008) adds a certain charge. The following (narrative but less of an I-poem) triggered a\nparticular emotional response, a sighed, spoken, echoing of the sense of relief at the end.\nOur experiences with funders\nIt [our bid] was kept hanging\nWe did ring them\nThe funders wouldn't give us the money\nWe kept going back to them\nThey don't really give you reasons\nIt got to the final stage\nThey were so impressed they actually gave us funding\nThe creative variation on I-poems then, shifted from offering a scientific analytical lens,\nto combining scientific and creative lenses, which Richardson and StPierre (2005: 964)\nmight see as a `\"social science art form\" \u00ad a radically interpretive form of representation'\nallowing us to `see more deeply'. As Leavy (2008: 344) argues, in the doing of perfor-\nmance `meaning is constructed and multiplied', negotiated with the audience with social\nscience and emancipatory potential not yet fully understood. In constructing and reading\nthe poems Melanie was in some small way embodying the data (see Leavy, 2008). Indeed\nthe other stimulus materials \u00ad the co-produced `cakes' might be seen in this light also.\nWhile Richardson and StPierre see thinking as happening in the writing, our thinking\nwas happening in the talking, creating, listening and writing.\nConclusion\nThe whole movement toward inclusive research is about values, ideas, politics. This\nforms a kind of `methods gap' (Hesse-Biber and Leavy, 2008; Leavy, 2008) in which\nabstract theory places demands on methodological development. In researching inclu-\nsive research we sought to create a dynamic, dialogic process. In doing so we came to\nunderstand the subject of our inquiry \u00ad inclusive research \u00ad in relation to trust but also\nrisk, to social responsibility but also playfulness. Ultimately we transgressed some of\nthe orthodoxies of the inclusive research genre, just as we transgressed or adapted\naspects of the Listening Guide. We gave ourselves permission to engage in our own\nmethodological development, engaging as much with ideas from the cutting edge of\nqualitative research as with ideas from inclusive research to compose an approach mak-\ning use of, but not being constrained by, principles from each. The stimulus materials,\nmetaphor and I-poems worked within the iterative focus group design where their\npotential for provoking and reflecting transformative dialogue was realised. Responses\nto them were authentic in the way that their use was authentic; the methods were\nincluded for a carefully considered purpose and engagement with them was in this\nspirit. They could not make everything accessible to everyone all of the time, but they\ncould give us a different purchase on the topic of inclusive research and the analysis of\nknowledge in the making.\nTaking risks, facing our own epistemological doubts, and daring to listen fully to\neveryone involved made us aware of our moral obligation to challenge ourselves to fur-\nther the discussion, to invite other researchers to dig deep into the contradictions and\ncomplexities of doing research inclusively rather than pursue a fixed methodology with\nthe label of inclusive research. We need to reflect on how we are `producing' (StPierre,\n2009: 230) ourselves in interaction with the labels and descriptions assigned to us.\nExtending this substantive and methodological dialogue has been the goal in writing the\npaper. Our desires to connect inclusive research with wider research developments and\nto treat ourselves as emergent instruments of research and crafters of research methods\nare genuine. Our claims to innovation and to inclusion may be modest but we have been\nambitious in our attempt to do something creative and constructive with the tensions\nbefore us.\n"
