However, we know that reporting bias in general\nis common (11\u00ad13) and that patterns differ by key sociode-\nmographic characteristics including race/ethnicity and gender\n(14). Little is known, however, about how reporting patterns\ncompare across sexual orientation groups.\nAccuracy in weight reporting has also been shown to differ\nby other social and health characteristics and behaviors. These\ninclude level of education (15) and weight status (16). Others\nhave speculated that the presence or absence of depressive\nsymptoms and physical activity level may also impact accu-\nracy of reporting (16).

Given the literature on differences by sexual ori-\nentation and gender in weight satisfaction and body image\n(18\u00ad22), we hypothesized that lesbian women would be less\nlikely and gay men more likely to underestimate their BMI than\ntheir same-gender, heterosexual peers. We further hypoth-\nesized that depression may lead to more accurate reporting\nwhile overweight status would lead to greater underestimation\nof weight. Finally, we anticipated that both lower educational\nattainment and lower physical activity levels would lead to less\naccurate weight reporting.\nMethods and Procedures\nStudy population\nThis research uses data from the third of four Waves of the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a nationally representative\nschool-based study of adolescents enrolled in grades 7 through 12 at\nof the initial wave of the Add Health study is schools. Prior to sampling,\nschools were sorted by size, school type, census region, level of urbani-\nzation, and the percentage of the student body that is white. Add Health\nused systematic sampling methods and implicit stratification to ensure\nthat the selected schools were representative of US schools. All of the\nstudents attending the chosen schools were eligible for the in-home\nsample. Students were stratified by gender and grade in school with\nabout 17 students randomly selected from each stratum. The final sam-\nple in Wave I was 20,745. Every effort was made to find respondents for\nthe in-home questionnaire for Wave III.\nSeveral exclusion criteria were applied to create our analytic sample. We\nexcluded those who identified themselves as not attracted to either males\nor females as the sample size was small (n = 68), and it was difficult to\ninterpret the meaning of this category relative to the other sexual orienta-\ntion groups. Additionally, we excluded those who were missing sampling\nweights as well as those who were missing information either regarding\nour dependent variable (self-reported BMI based on self-reported height\nand weight) or key independent predictors (total of 978 excluded because\nof missing either self-reported BMI or measured BMI). However, prior\nto this final exclusion, we addressed a high nonresponse rate (~10%)\nfor the two variables measuring socioeconomic status--parent-reported\nmaternal education and household income. In an effort to avoid selec-\ntion bias and inaccurate inferences resulting from listwise deletion, we\nimputed these variables by using the Gaussian normal regression imputa-\ntion method (23,24). After this imputation and all exclusions, our final\nsample contained 12,797 adolescents and young adults.\nStudy variables\nOutcome variable. Our primary outcome of interest was BMI calcu-\nlated from the participants' self-reported height and weight (referred to\nas self-reported BMI).\nPrimary predictor variables. Our primary predictor variable was BMI\ncalculated from objectively measured height and weight (referred to as\nobjectively measured BMI) recorded by field interviewers in a standard\nway. Our second predictor of interest was sexual orientation. Partici-\npants were asked to \"choose the description that best fits how you think\nabout yourself,\" with the following possible responses: (i) 100% het-\nerosexual (straight), (ii) mostly heterosexual (straight), but somewhat\nattracted to people of your own sex, (iii) bisexual--that is attracted to\nmen and women equally, (iv) mostly homosexual (gay), but somewhat\nattracted to people of the opposite sex, (v) 100% homosexual (gay), and\n(vi) not sexually attracted to either males or females. As noted above,\nwe excluded those who chose option 6 as this category was difficult to\ninterpret. Additionally, because of small cell sizes we collapsed \"mostly\nhomosexual\" (n = 84) and \"homosexuals\" (n = 113) into a single cat-\negory called \"gay/lesbian.\"\nAdditional independent variables. Race/ethnicity was constructed\nfrom two questions, one that asked participants to indicate if they were\nof Hispanic/Latino origin and a second that asked them to choose a\ncategory of race that best describes them. We constructed six catego-\nries: Hispanic, black or African American (not Hispanic), Asian/Pacific\nIslander, white (not Hispanic), Native American/American Indian, and\nmultiracial/other. Depression score was taken from a modified version\nof the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and\ntreated as a continuous variable with a range of 0\u00ad26 (25). We elected\nto control for socioeconomic markers of the household of origin (i.e.,\nWave I household income and highest educational attainment of\nmother/caregiver) in Wave III because of the expected heterogeneity of\nprofessional and/or educational development in Wave III participants\nwho were ages 18\u00ad26 at the time of data collection. Maternal education\nwas treated as an ordinal variable with four categories (less than high\nschool; high school or vocational school; some college or trade; and\ncollege and beyond). Maternal report of household income was also\ntreated as a continuous variable. Due to a high degree of missingness for\nthe maternal report of household income and maternal education, we\nimputed these variables using the Gaussian normal regression imputa-\ntion method. Additionally, we controlled for age, gender, and reported\nphysical activity (taken from seven different questions asking the num-\nber of times in the last 7 days participated in different groups of activi-\nties) treated as a continuous variable with values ranging from 0\u00ad49.\nAnalyses\nAll analyses were performed using STATA/SE 10.0. In all models,\nwe accounted for the complex survey design using svy commands in\nSTATA and applied weights to account for the unequal likelihood of\nbeing sampled for certain subpopulations. We performed bivariate\nanalyses of our covariates of interest with our outcome variable to test\nfor significant relationships. We then used multiple linear regression to\ntest for bias in weight status reporting among different sexual orienta-\ntion groups accounting for objectively measured BMI. We show our\nmodel-building strategy starting with a model only controlling for our\nprimary predictor variables, objectively measured BMI, and sexual ori-\nentation group (Model A), then a fully controlled model (Model B).\nRegression diagnostic procedures showed no evidence of multicolline-\narity, heteroscedasticity, or substantial influence from outliers.\nWe tested for effect modification of the association of sexual orienta-\ntion group and self-reported BMI by weight status. Specifically, we tested\nfor improvement of fit of our model with the inclusion of the interaction\nterms measured BMI \u00d7 sexual orientation group using a global test, gen-\neralized linear hypothesis testing. We compared the -2* log likelihood\nratios of models with and without the interaction terms. Because of our a\npriori hypotheses regarding differences by gender within sexual orienta-\ntion groups, we performed all analyses stratified by gender.\nIn order to assess for the potential influence of over- or underreport-\ning of either height or weight, we did sensitivity analyses with height and\nweight as separate outcomes.\nResults\nSexual orientation groups differed on several of our variables of\ninterest (Table 1). Gay (average BMI = 25.2) and bisexual males\n(average BMI = 24.5) had on average lower measured BMIs\ncompared to those of male heterosexuals (average BMI = 26.4)\nwhereas bisexual females (average BMI = 28.7) and lesbians\n(average BMI = 26.8) had on average higher BMIs compared\nto heterosexual females (average BMI = 26.3). The depres-\nsion score was lower in the heterosexual males and females\ncompared to all other same sex sexual orientation groups.\nGay males and lesbians had the highest reported physical\narticles\n \nactivity levels across sexual orientation groups. Heterosexual\nand mostly heterosexual males and females were more likely to\nhave mothers with some college education compared to homo-\nsexual males and females.\nTables 2 and 3 present results from our partially and fully\nadjusted multiple linear regression models examining the\nassociation of sexual orientation groups and BMI calculated\nfrom self-reported height and weight taking into account\nobjectively measured BMI. We tested for improvement of fit\nof our models with the addition of interaction terms sexual\norientation group \u00d7 objectively measured BMI. Though our\ngeneralized linear hypothesis testing indicated improve-\nment in the overall fit of our model with the addition of\nthese interaction terms, none of the individual interaction\nterms were significant.

There was no significant difference\nby sexual orientation group in amount of underreporting of\nBMI. We also see that there is a slight increase in self-reported\nBMI ( = 0.02) resulting in improved accuracy with increasing\ndepression score; in contrast, there is a modest decrease in self-\nreported BMI with increase in physical activity ( = -0.02).\nThere is also a slight decrease in self-reported BMI with an\nincrease in maternal education ( = -0.07) but no significant\ndifference related to household income.\nFindings in males are overall similar to those in females.\nIn males, the intercept in the fully adjusted model is approxi-\nmately one BMI unit lower than the model not fully adjusted.\nIn the fully adjusted model, with every one-unit increase in\nmeasured BMI, there is an average increase in self-reported\nBMI of 0.85 BMI units indicating that on average males under-\nreport their BMI by 15%. In addition, gay males on average\nreport a BMI 0.37 units lower than heterosexual males of the\nsame BMI, indicating that gay males underreport their BMI\nto a greater degree than do heterosexual males. There are no\nother significant differences by sexual orientation group. As in\nfemales, there is a modest increase in reported BMI with an\nincrease in depression score ( = 0.02), resulting in improved\naccuracy. However, in males, there is no association between\nphysical activity level nor marker of socioeconomic status and\nself-reported BMI.\nIn Figures 1 and 2, we show prototypical plots of the self-re-\nported BMI vs. measured BMI for the different gender-specific\nsexual orientation groups. In both figures, we see that there is\nan overall underreporting of BMI across the population and\nthat at the absolute value of underreporting is higher at higher\nBMIs. In the gender-specific sexual orientation groups, we see\nan overall underreporting of BMI but a great degree of similar-\nity between the groups.\nIn order to assess for undue influence of over- or underre-\nporting on either height or weight, we examined models with\nheight and weight as separate outcomes (see Tables 1 and 2\nTable 2Characteristics associated with difference in BMI\ncalculated from self-reported vs. measured anthropometrics\nin females\nPartially adjusted\nmodela Fully adjusted modelb\nCovariates\nSexual orientation groups\n Heterosexual\n (referent)\n Mostly\n heterosexual\nRace/ethnicity\n Native\nAmerican\n Depression\n score\n Maternal\n education\naAdjusted for sexual orientation group and objectively measured BMI. bAdjusted\nfor sexual orientation group, objectively measured BMI, demographics (race/\nethnicity, age gender, socioeconomic status), depression, and physical activity.\nTable 3Characteristics associated with difference in BMI\ncalculated from self-reported vs. measured anthropometrics\nin males\nPartially adjusted\nmodela Fully adjusted modelb\nCovariates\nSexual orientation groups\n Mostly\n heterosexual\nRace/ethnicity\n Depression\n score\n Maternal\n education\naAdjusted for sexual orientation group and objectively measured BMI. bAdjusted\nfor sexual orientation group, objectively measured BMI, demographics (race/\nethnicity, age gender, SES), depression, and physical activity. *P < 0.05;**P <\narticles\n \nin Supplementary Appendix online).

Counter to our\nhypotheses, lesbians did not underreport their BMI to a lesser\ndegree than heterosexual females, but consistent with our\nhypotheses, gay males showed greater reporting bias than did\nheterosexual males. Specifically, gay males were the only group\nwho underreported their BMI to a greater degree than same-\ngender heterosexuals. Similar trends were found in other male\nsexual orientation groups when looking at height and weight\nseparately though no statistically significant associations were\nnoted. However, it is notable that there was significant under-\nreporting of BMI by all groups and that the absolute value\nof underreporting increased with increasing measured BMI.\nThis is the first study of which we are aware to examine sexual\n\norientation-related bias in self-reported BMI.\nIt is worth noting that groups differed in under- and overre-\nporting of height and weight. Specifically, all male racial/ethnic\ngroups with the exception of the multiracial males underre-\nported their height relative to whites. Also, Hispanic and\nAsian males significantly underreported their weight relative\nto whites. However, when examining BMI, only black males\ndiffered significantly in their reporting accuracy relative to\nwhites. In females, the patterns for height and weight reporting\nwere similar for height and weight when compared to BMI.\nCurrent evidence from the literature based on self-report\ndata has documented elevated obesity in sexual minority\nfemales and reduced obesity in sexual minority males relative\nto same-gender heterosexual peers (4\u00ad8). Our findings among\nfemales based on objectively measured and self-report BMI\nindicate that these observed sexual orientation disparities can-\nnot be explained by orientation-related bias in self-reported\nBMI. Among males, while a greater degree of underreporting\nof BMI among gay males may lead to overestimates of orienta-\ntion-related obesity disparities, in our study, group differences\npersisted even when BMI was objectively measured, provid-\ning further evidence that heterosexual males are at greater risk\nfor elevated BMI than are gay males despite the presence of\nreporting bias.\nThough certain sociodemographic factors such as gender\nhave been shown to be associated with the accuracy of weight\nthe impact of other behavioral and health factors. In their\nreview of the accuracy of self-reported weight in adolescents,\nSherry et al. called for further studies to investigate the influ-\nence of physical activity, socioeconomic status, and mental\nhealth status on accuracy of weight reporting (16). In our\nanalysis of females, we found a modest influence by all three\n(depression score, physical activity, and maternal education)\non self-reported BMI; in males, we found only depression to be\nsignificantly associated with self-reported BMI.\nSelf-reported BMI\nMeasured BMI\nHeterosexual Homosexual\nPopulation average\nMostly heterosexual\nBisexual\nFigure 1 Female self-reported vs. measured BMI by sexual orientation\nin a nationally representative sample of young adults.\nHeterosexual Homosexual\nPopulation average\nMostly heterosexual\nBisexual\nSelf-reported BMI\nMeasured BMI\nFigure 2 Male self-reported vs. measured BMI by sexual orientation in a\nnationally representative sample of young adults.\narticles\n \nThere are limitations to this study that should be noted. First,\nwe were limited in our BMI data by the equipment used; per-\nsons weighing more than 400 pounds could not be weighed by\nthe scales used. Thus, if there were different patterns occurring\non the high-end extreme of weight status, we would be unable\nto capture them. Second, participants were aware that they\nwould be weighed so may have been more accurate in their\nreporting than if they had not known that objective measure-\nmentswouldbetaken.Finally,sexualorientationwasdiscerned\nby a single item assessing sexual orientation identity. In public\nhealth research, sexual orientation is typically understood to be\nmultidimensional construct makeup of three primary dimen-\nsions: (i) attractions, (ii) sex of sexual partners, and (3) iden-\ntity labeling as heterosexual, bisexual, or lesbian/gay (29,30).\nAssociations between sexual orientation and health have been\nfound to differ by the dimension measured (31).\nConclusions\nUnderstanding both the overall accuracy of self-reported BMI\nand the relative accuracy between groups is key to determining\nhow to allocate often scarce public health intervention dollars.\nBecause reliance on self-reported data is common, especially in\nlarge state-run surveys such as the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (32)\nand Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (33), it is all the\nmore important to understand the accuracy of these data. Our\nfindings are reassuring that in most cases the relative accuracy\nof self-reported BMI is similar across sexual orientation groups.\nThus, targeting specific sexual orientation groups for interven-\ntion based on self-reported weight status data is reasonable espe-\ncially when obtaining measured data are not feasible.\nObesity disparities have been identified as among the most\ncritical public health problems facing the nation, and research\ninto the causes of racial/ethnic and gender disparities in obes-\nity is receiving increasing scholarly attention (1,34). Sexual\norientation-related disparities in obesity have now been con-\nsistently documented across samples and, importantly, our\nstudy indicates that observed disparities are robust and cannot\nbe attributed to reporting bias. It is now time for researchers\nfocused on health disparities and obesity to devote concerted\nefforts to identifying the causes of these disparities, which will\nprovide us with the scientific knowledge essential to designing\neffective interventions to eliminate sexual orientation-related\ndisparities in obesity.\nSupplementary material is linked to the online version of the paper at http://\nwww.nature.com/oby\n"
