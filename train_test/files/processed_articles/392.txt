Recent policy and ser-\nvice initiatives have endeavored to address the desires to age in place and\nimprove the quality of life among an expanding older population (Rowles,\nbased services by improving local service infrastructures and community\npartnerships (Bolda, Saucier, Maddox, Wetle, & Lowe, 2006). The provi-\nsion of a variety of flexible services under innovative delivery systems will\nhelp meet the changing needs of older adults and facilitate aging in place.\nServices required by older adults at home with long-term care needs\ninclude in-home services like home care, home health services, home-\ndelivered meals, and home improvement programs as well as community-\nbased services such as senior centers, adult day care, and transportation\nprograms. When confronted with a health crisis, older adults and their fam-\nily caregivers have to consider alternative options such as assisted living or\nnursing homes if the existing care arrangement no longer meets their needs\n(Nakashima, Chapin, Macmillan, & Zimmerman, 2004). In fact, appropri-\nate use of in-home and community-based services was related to delaying\nnursing home placement, reversing deterioration of physical functioning,\nUsing national longitudinal data, Gaugler et al. (2005) documented\nthat earlier use of in-home services by family caregivers of older adults\nwith dementia predicted a delay in institutionalization. Burr et al. (2005)\nfound that older unmarried women with functional limitations experienced\na reduced risk of institutionalization when states increased spending for\nhome and community-based services. Albert, Simone, Brassard, Stern, and\nMayeux (2005) found that Medicaid home care service use was linked with\na significantly reduced risk of death among older adults with disabilities\nin activities of daily living. These studies demonstrated that appropriate\nor early use of in-home and community-based services would promote\naging in place by delaying institutionalization and avoiding its deleterious\nconsequences among certain groups of frail older adults.\nAs posited from the behavioral model of health service use (Ander-\nson, 1968), awareness of services enabled the use of services. Indeed,\nknowledge or awareness of a service was found to be one predictor of ser-\nvice use (Calsyn & Rades, 1993). Similarly, qualitative studies found that\nlack of knowledge about available services was a major barrier to access to\nand utilization of these services for community-dwelling older adults (Gal-\nlagher & Truglio-Londrigan, 2004; Hare, Rogers, Lester, McManus, &\nMant, 2005). Lack of knowledge derived partly from older adults' poor\nunderstanding of agency policies and practices and partly from deficiencies\nin community networks (Moyer, Coristine, Roberger, & O'Hagan, 1999).\nPrior to using services, older adults must have the means and knowledge\nof how to get the services and make use of them, though it remains unclear\nwhether knowledge of services is related to actual planning for aging in\nplace. Much previous research profiled the effects of using community-\nbased services; however, little research to date has been done regarding\nthe effects of awareness of these services on anticipatory aging in place or\nrelocation. This study, which was designed to examine the association be-\ntween awareness of services and the anticipation for aging in place versus\nrelocation, has implications for disseminating accurate information regard-\ning the availability of community-based long-term care and services and\ncalibrating these services to fit the changing needs of an aging individual\nand an aging community.\nIn this study, we sought to understand whether perceived awareness of\nservices was related to anticipation for aging-in-place and relocation and\nwhether awareness of services was associated with the predicted age for\nstaying at home and relocating. This study used the Community Partnership\nfor Older Adults (CPFOA) Survey of Older Adults, a representative sample\nof adults aged 50 years or older from 13 communities. Taking a prospective\napproach, the survey asked the age at which the respondent expected to\nlive on one's own under regular help and when to move out because of\nhealth problems, and it examined the awareness of the un/availability of an\narray of community-based services. Specifically, we asked the following\nquestions:\n1. What are the characteristics of adults with the anticipation for aging\nin place?\n2. What are the characteristics of adults with the anticipation for\nrelocation?\n3. Is perceived awareness of community-based long-term care and ser-\nvices associated with the anticipation for aging in place?\n4. Is perceived awareness of community-based long-term care and ser-\nvices associated with the anticipation for relocation?\n5. Is perceived awareness of community-based long-term care and ser-\nvices associated with the expected age at which participants would\nneed help to age in place?\n6. Is perceived awareness of community-based long-term care and ser-\nvices associated with the expected age for relocation?\nMETHODS\nData\nThe data for this study were drawn from the CPFOA Survey of Older\nAdults. As an initiative of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the\nCPFOA was aimed at improving long-term care and supportive service\nsystems for older adults through sustaining local community-based part-\nnerships. The local community was composed of older adults, health and\nsocial service providers, Area Agencies on Aging, government and busi-\nness leaders, and local funders (Bolda et al., 2006). The survey was part of\nthe evaluation of the CPFOA program, which was designed to identify older\nadults at risk of needing long-term care and assess gaps in their knowledge\nabout the options available (Black & Brown, 2004). A telephone survey was\nconducted among a representative sample of adults aged 50 years and older\nin 13 communities that had been awarded development grants by the CP-\nFOA program. These communities were located in Boston, Massachusetts;\nBroome County, New York; Chittenden and Grand Isle Counties,\nVermont; Columbia and Union Counties, Arkansas; El Paso County, Texas;\nFulton County, Georgia; Houston/Harris County, Texas; Maui Island,\nHawaii; Milwaukee County, Wisconsin; Riverside County, California; San\nFrancisco, California; St. Clair County, Missouri; and Upper Peninsula,\nMissouri.\nHouseholds in these communities were selected using list-assisted ran-\ndom digit-dialing, and one respondent from each eligible household was\nwere interviewed in 2002. The response rate averaged 63% across the\n13 sites, ranging from 53% to 71% in individual communities (Black &\nBrown, 2004). People aged 75 years and older were overrepresented in this\nstudy, consisting of about 25.3% in the population aged 50 years and older.\nand older were aged 75 years and older (U.S. Census of Bureau, 2001).\nFor this study, the sample was restricted to older adults who were living\nindependently either in a rented place or one's own place at the survey time\n(N = 4,611), excluding those living in a nursing home, a group home, an\nassisted living facility, or with a relative in the relative's home.\nMEASURES\nPerceived Awareness of Community-Based Long-Term Care\nand Supportive Services\nRespondents were asked if an array of long-term care and support-\nive services were available in their community. These long-term care and\nsupportive services included senior centers, adult day programs, house-\nkeeping services, senior lunch programs, a telephone helpline, home re-\npair assistance, visiting nursing services, personal assistance, door-to-door\ntransportation, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and hospice care.\nA three-category response was used: (0) no, (1) yes, or (2) don't know.\nEach of these 12 variables was dummy-coded, and the \"don't know\" group\nwas used as the reference variable in the analysis of the relationships with\nanticipations for aging-in-place planning and relocation, respectively.\nAnticipation for Aging in Place or Relocation\nTwo questions were asked to respondents about their anticipation for ag-\ning in place and relocation, \"At what age do you think you will need regular\nhelp to remain living on your own?\" and \"At what age do you think you will\nno longer be able to live in your current home because of physical or mental\nhealth problems?\" The answers ranged from (1) younger than 60 years to\n(11) never. However, approximately 38% and 44% of participants, respec-\ntively, reported that they did not know at what age they would need help\nto remain living on their own or need to move out. Thus two dichotomous\nvariables--aging-in-place anticipation and relocation anticipation--were\nfirst created to capture those who anticipated an age at which they would\nneed help or move out (1 = yes) or those who had no idea at what age they\nwould need help or move out (0 = no). Those who answered they would\nnever need help or move out were categorized into the \"don't know\" groups\nbecause the response indicated that they would never anticipate aging in\nplace or relocation based on these services. As a result, approximately\n48% and 56% respondents, respectively, did not anticipate aging in place\nor relocation (Table 1). Bivariate analysis indicated that these two groups\nof respondents were different and approximately 36% had anticipations\nfor both aging in place and relocation. These two variables were used as\ndependent measures in logistic regressions to answer research questions 3\nand 4 regarding the relationship between perceived awareness of services\nand aging-in-place/relocation anticipation.\nTABLE 1.

The mean age for anticipated help to age in place\nControl Variables\nControl variables included age, gender, education, annual household in-\ncome, housing type, living arrangement, home repair need, community\nrating, self-rated health, and long-term care use.

Housing type was\nmeasured by (0) living in a rented place or (1) living in one's own place.\nLiving arrangement was coded into (0) living alone or (1) living with oth-\ners. Respondents were asked if their current residence needed significant\nrepairs, modifications, or changes to improve their ability to live in it over\nthe next 5 years, with responses coded (0) no or (1) yes. Community rating\nwas measured by the response to the question \"Overall, how would you\nrate your community as a place to live?\" Four-category responses were\navailable and ranged from (1) excellent to (4) poor. Self-rated health was\nmeasured by (1) excellent, (2) very good, (3) good, (4) fair, or (5) poor.\nLong-term care use was indicated by use of any one of three long-term\ncare services (i.e., nursing home, assisted living facility, or hospice care)\nwithin the past 3 months. It was coded into (1) yes for anyone indicating\nthe use of any service, or (0) no for those having not used any service\nbefore.\nThe analysis proceeded in two steps. First, we conducted bivariate ex-\naminations of anticipations (yes/no) for aging in place and relocation with\nbackground variables to answer research questions 1 and 2. Next, to an-\nswer research questions 3 and 4, we conducted a series of logistic regres-\nsion analyses to examine whether perceived awareness of services--either\navailability or unavailability--was related to anticipating aging in place or\nrelocation. To answer research questions 5 and 6, we conducted a series of\nnormal multivariate regressions to examine whether perceived awareness\nof services was associated with the age at which older adults anticipated to\nneed help to remain living on their own or to move out because of health\nproblems.\nRESULTS\nPerceived awareness of community-based long-term care and services\nvaried substantially among adults living independently either in rented\nplaces or in their own places. As seen in Figure 1, the proportion of older\nadults who were aware of the availability of services ranged from ap-\nproximately 37% (home repair assistance) to 88% (nursing home). Corre-\nspondingly, approximately 7% did not know about nursing home facilities,\nwhereas 47% were unaware of home repair services. Generally, a smaller\nproportion reported services were not available in the community com-\npared to those unaware of these services, from 4% for senior center to 16%\nfor home repair (see Figure 1).\nTable 2 presents frequency distributions of background variables and\ntheir bivariate associations with aging-in-place anticipation. In this study\nhalf of respondents were aged 50 to 64, and only approximately 5%\nwere aged 85 and over, with 60% being female. Approximately half were\nhighly educated with some college or more years of schooling. More than\none-third had annual incomes higher than $40,000. Approximately\nFIGURE 1.

Approximately four-fifths lived in\ntheir own places, with 16% requiring significant repairs to their homes.\nApproximately 39% rated their community as an excellent place to live.\nAs for health status, one-fifth reported excellent health status and approx-\nimately 7% reported poor health. Approximately 91% of respondents had\nnot used any of three long-term care services before.\nAs indicated from bivariate analyses, those with aging-in-place antici-\npation were likely to be young-old (50\u00ad64 years), male, higher-educated,\nwith more income, and in very good or excellent health status. Proportion-\nally, those who lived with others, those who resided in their own places,\nand those whose current residence needed significant repairs were more\nlikely to anticipate aging in place than were their counterparts.\nTable 3 shows the characteristics of those with relocation anticipation.\nThese characteristics included young-old, male, higher-educated, more\nincome, living with others, in excellent and very good health conditions.\nAlso those who had used long-term care services before were likely to\nanticipate relocation.\nTable 4 contains results from the logistic regressions indicating that\nperceived awareness of the availability of all types of community-based\nlong-term care and services were significantly related to aging-in-place an-\nticipation. Compared with those without knowledge about these services,\nthose who were aware of the availability of the services were more likely\nto anticipate aging in place. In addition, perceived awareness of a lack of\neight types of services (all except senior lunch programs, nursing home,\nassisted living, and hospice care) in the community was also related to the\nlikelihood of aging-in-place anticipation. For example, those reporting an\nunavailability of housekeeping were 66% more likely, in terms of odds, to\nexpect a need for regular help for remaining at home than those without\nknowledge about the service. Similarly, perceived awareness of the avail-\nability of 11 types of services (all except hospice) was associated with the\nlikelihood of the expectation for moving out of the current residence. Also,\nperceived awareness of the unavailability of 7 types of services (all except\nhelpline, visiting nurses, personal assistance, nursing home, and hospice\ncare) was related to an expectation for relocation.\nTable 5 contains parameter estimates and standard errors for the models\nexplaining the relationship of perceived awareness of services and the an-\nticipated age range for aging in place and relocation. Perceived awareness\nof the unavailability of visiting nurses, personal assistance, and transporta-\ntion was respectively associated with the younger age at which respondents\nTABLE 3.

If people thought there were no such services avail-\nable in their community, they were likely to anticipate a need for help to\nremain living on their own at a younger age than those who were unaware\nof the services. Awareness of the availability of adult day care was related\nto having an older age for anticipating the need for help to age in place.\nPerceived awareness of the unavailability of visiting nurses, personal\nassistance, and transportation was also related to the younger age at which\nrespondents anticipated to move out. In addition, perceived awareness of\nthe availability of helpline was associated with relocation anticipation at\nan older age.\nDISCUSSION\nThis study assessed the perceived awareness of community-based long-\nterm care and services among older adults living independently in commu-\nnities and its associations with aging-in-place and relocation anticipation.\nFindings demonstrated that, by a substantial margin, older adults were\nnot aware of long-term care and services that were available in the com-\nmunity. In addition, a smaller portion of respondents reported that some\nservices were not available, though these programs were well-established\nand usually visible in the community (Black & Brown, 2004). Aware-\nness of community services alone did not predict service use (Gallagher\n& Truglio-Londrigan, 2004), but a lack of awareness was considered a\nmajor barrier to access services, even more than other barriers including\nunavailability of services and financial restraints (Li, 2006). Consequently,\nthis lack of awareness of services prevents future use of and reliance on\ncommunity services to remain living at home or in the community. In con-\ntrast, lack of knowledge or misreport of an unavailability of services would\nimpose more concerns about relocation.\nWe found that older adults with certain characteristics were likely to ex-\npect to age in place with regular help and move out because of health prob-\nlems. These characteristics were: young old, male, high socioeconomic\nstatus (SES), good health, and living with others. Ironically, the reversed\ncharacteristics were just the demographic profiles of nursing home resi-\ndents: oldest old, women, low SES living alone, and in greater need of\ncare (Eaton, 2005). Probably because of cumulative disadvantages in their\nlife course, these groups of people may have little knowledge about home-\nand community-based care and services in terms of access, eligibility, and\ninsurance coverage. Thus they may not consider using services available\nin the community and are more likely to enter a nursing home than those\nusers of community-based services. A lack of awareness of or information\nabout community services may hamper people from receiving in-home and\ncommunity-based services that could meet their changing care needs and\nsignificantly improve their quality of life. Lack of anticipation for reloca-\ntion may be related to an unwillingness to relocate even in face of health\ndeterioration or lack of information about long-term care availability in\nthe community. Some people might have the information, or were even\nreferred to service programs, but withdrew or refused due to financial con-\nstraints or institutional barriers during the complicated application process\n(Long, Liu, Black, O'Keeffe, & Molony, 2005). Such experiences, either\npersonally or by others, may discourage people from reliance on commu-\nnity services. To address issues of accessibility, availability, affordability,\nand quality of community-based long-term care and services, the Robert\nWood Johnson Foundation has initiated the program Community Partner-\nships for Older Adults with the focus on improving local service-delivery\ninfrastructure. One of the strategies of local community partnerships is\nto increase awareness about long-term care and services within the com-\nmunity, specifically awareness of resources, access points, eligibility, and\ninsurance coverage (Bolda et al., 2006).\nThis study also indicated that perceived awareness of availability of\nvarious community services was associated with the likelihood of aging-\nin-place and relocation anticipations. Faced with possible deterioration in\nphysical and mental health, older adults need a continuum of services and\ncare options, from personal care (e.g., homemaker and chore assistance)\nto long-term care to meet their desires for aging in place. For example,\nas assisted living has become an increasingly important component in the\nlong-term care system, less restrictive admission and retention policies\nwith adequate staffing and funding could increase opportunities for aging\nin place in assisted living (Chapin & Dobbs-Kepper, 2001). Although a\nnursing home is the last place to choose, knowledge about its availability\nin the community may help older adults remain in a familiar setting and\nclose to families, and a temporary admission to a skilled nursing facility\ncan address their needs as well. Given the importance of housing and\nhigh home-ownership rates in the older population, it is not surprising that\nperceived awareness of home repair services was related to both aging-in-\nplace and relocation anticipation, even though it received the lowest score\nfor level of awareness in this study.\nPerceived unavailability of most services was related to anticipations. It\nis, of course, the sudden decline or change in health that usually precipitates\nthe decision to move into a long-term care facility. However, older adults\nwould be worried if there were no housekeeping or personal assistance\nservices to aid with activities and functioning in daily life or if there\nwere no visiting nurses to care for their increasing medical needs. Also, a\nlack of transportation would increase limitations in mobility and activity.\nThe unavailability of senior centers and adult day programs would relate\nto decreased social engagement and unmet medical needs, thus posing\nburdens on family caregivers. With the worries about a lack of availability\nof such essential services in the community, older adults were likely to\nanticipate regular help and relocation. Perceived unavailability of services\nsuch as visiting nurses, personal assistance, and transportation was related\nto an earlier age at which older adults anticipated to need help or move out.\nOlder adults may rely on these services to keep living in their current home,\nand when these services are supposedly unavailable, elders may think about\nneeding help or relocating at an earlier age than would otherwise be.\nThis study showed that adults who were aware of (un)availability of\ncommunity-based long-term care and services were likely to think about\nreliance on regular help to remain at home and about moving out of the\ncurrent home due to health problems. Those who reported an unavailability\nof some services tended to anticipate aging in place under regular help or\nrelocation atan earlierage.Findings pointed to the importance ofincreasing\nawareness of long-term care and services in the community to facilitate\nolder adults' anticipation for aging in place or relocation. In turn, the\nanticipation will lead to further appropriate access to and use of these\nservices with the long-term goal of keeping people in their own homes for\nas long as possible.\nStrategies have been proposed to address the substantial knowledge\ngaps among community-dwelling older adults, including developing and\npromoting the use of a telephone helpline in disseminating information\nabout long-term care, conducting a media campaign or door-to-door out-\nreach campaign, and improving communication and collaboration among\nlong-term care service providers and senior service organizations (Black &\nBrown, 2004). As indicated by this study, the targeted populations in these\ncampaigns include the older old, women, those of lower socioeconomic\nstatus, those living alone, and those who are vulnerable and in greater need\nof long-term care and services because of functional dependence, finan-\ncial restraints, and lack of informal support. In light of the demographic\nchanges the United States is facing, the young-old and aging baby boomers\nneed to be informed about services and resources on which they are able\nto draw to meet the increasing desire for aging in place.\nIn addition, federal and state policy efforts are needed to expand the\navailability of home and community-based services through raising the\nincome or asset eligibility criteria for Medicaid waiver programs and au-\nthorizing state general revenues for home and community-based services\nfor people who are ineligible for Medicaid (Burr et al., 2005; Long et al.,\n2005). This is particularly important when older adults are in need of, but\ncurrently ineligible for, community services. When older adults know that\nthey are not financially eligible for a service (e.g., home repair) or cannot\nafford a service (e.g., assisted living), they may report an unavailability\nof the service. Improved awareness of community services refers to the\nknowledge not only about availability of services, but also about access\npoints, eligibility for service, and affordability of quality care for older\nadults.\nLimitations\nSeveral caveats must be made to this study. Although the results raised\nthe possibility that perceived awareness of community-based long-term\ncare and services could assist in older adults' future planning for regular\nhelp or relocation, the analysis did not allow us to attribute the anticipation\nto the information regarding services. As indicated from existing litera-\nture, many factors are important in decision making for aging in place\nor relocation, including physical health, social networks, and financial\nstatus, as well as institutional barriers to access services. However, this\nstudy demonstrates the needs for and potential importance of promoting\nawareness of community services among community-dwelling residents.\nFurther, knowledge about services also includes how to access to and get\nenrolled in programs, issues of eligibility and insurance coverage, and\nthe potential benefits and risks of participation. This study does not assess\nknowledge about these dimensions. Future research is needed to clarify the\neffects of knowledge in these dimensions and beyond on future planning.\nIn addition, the respondents of the CPFOA Survey were selected from\n13 communities that were awarded development grants by the initiative\nprogram of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The CPFOA sites varied\nin the size and diversity of their older adult populations, ranging from rural\ncommunities with fewer than 20,000 older adults to major metropolitan\nselected sites are limited in number, which may not well represent elders\nfrom communities that were not selected. Thus, generalizability is limited.\nFinally, the concept or model of aging in place also includes another\nkey component--housing and supportive services, the full range of which\nis not covered in this study. Housing options, including naturally occurring\nretirement communities, congregate housing, continuing care retirement\ncommunities, and co-housing (Wilson, 2006), provide not only locations\nwhere concentrated numbers of older adults live, but also supportive ser-\nvices of various degrees. Knowledge about these options and services and\ntheir affects on aging-in-place planning are not yet known.\nCONCLUSION\nWith the aging of the baby boom generation, the rapid growth of the\noldest-old population, and their great potential of aging into disability,\nthere will be a dramatic increase in the demand for community-based,\nlong-term care and supportive services in the coming years. The commu-\nnities in which older adults live should be livable with \"appropriate and\naffordable housing, adequate options for mobility, and the community fea-\ntures and services that can facilitate personal independence and continued\nengaging in civic and social life\" (AARP, 2005, p. 1). Aging in place is\nan appealing goal that is desired by a majority of aged and aging adults.\nIndividuals, aging agencies, communities, and public policies have their\nparts in improving the community's livability and achieving aging in place.\nA greater number of older adults will be able to realize the goal of aging in\nplace through improved public awareness of the availability of long-term\ncare and supportive services for older adults and an increase in the actual\navailability of in-home services.\nREFERENCES\nAARP.
