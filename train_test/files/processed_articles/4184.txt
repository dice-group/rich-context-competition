A total of 107 women with history of breast cancer attending Movimento Vencer e Viver\nLisboa responded to a questionnaire designed to assess the use of CAM, as well as other variables, such as satisfaction with\nconventional care, health perception, perceived control over cancer, and health status (body mass index [BMI], smoking and\nalcohol consumption, hours of sleep, and physical activity). Forty-eight percent of the participants had used some kind of\nCAM in the past 12 months. The perceived control over cancer was significantly associated with CAM use (odds ratio [OR] =\n1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.2, 1.9]). CAM use was more prevalent among women aged 30 to 39 years, single, with\nhigh education, and a monthly income of 2,500 to 2,999. The CAM used most often were natural products, along with\npsychotherapy, breathing exercises, and meditation. The main reason mentioned for its use was the improved sense of well-\nbeing, and it was interesting to note that 60% of the participants who used CAM did not discuss it with their physicians. The\nfindings support previous data that suggest that the participants' perceived control over their cancer is a significant predictor\nof CAM usage, and more than half of the patients did not discuss CAM usage with their physician. Further studies with larger\nsamples of cancer patients are warranted.\n",

The National Center for\nComplementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM, 2011)\ndefines CAM as a group of diverse medical and health sys-\ntems, products, and practices that are not generally consid-\nered part of conventional medicine. Therefore,\ncomplementary medicine refers to use of CAM together with\nconventional medicine, and alternative medicine refers to its\nuse in place of conventional medicine (NCCAM, 2011).\nThe use of CAM is also growing among cancer patients\nreported that the use of CAM increased by 30% after the\ncancer diagnosis. The most commonly reported CAM used\nare natural products, such as herbs, vitamins, and minerals.\nThe use of homeopathy and relaxation techniques is also\ncommonly reported (Molassiotis et al., 2005).\nCAM use has been associated to sociodemographic factors\nbecause many studies have found that increased CAM use is\nassociated with female gender, higher levels of education, and\ngood income (Nguyen, Davis, Kaptchuck, & Philips, 2010;\nRosenberg et al., 2008). In addition to demographic charac-\nteristics, the type of cancer and it's stage are two important\nfactors related to the use of CAM, and several studies suggest\nbreast cancer as one of the most associated with this use\n(Adams, Sibbritt, & Young, 2005; Gansler, Kaw, Crammer, &\ngiven by breast cancer patients for the use of CAM consist in\nthe desire to improve the immune system, cure cancer (Boon\n2010), alleviate symptoms associated with the side effects of\nconventional treatments (Shen et al., 2002; Wanchai et al.,\n1ISPA\u00adInstituto Universit\u00e1rio de Ci\u00eancias Psicol\u00f3gicas, Sociais e da Vida.,\nLisbon, Portugal\n2ISPA \u00ad Instituto Universit\u00e1rio de Ci\u00eancias Psicol\u00f3gicas, Sociais e da Vida\n& UIPES - Psychology & Health Research Unit, Portugal\n3ISPA - Instituto Universit\u00e1rio de Ci\u00eancias Psicol\u00f3gicas, Sociais e da Vida\n& CEAUL \u00ad Centro de Estat\u00edstica e Aplica\u00e7\u00f5es da Universidade de Lisboa,\nPortugal\nCorresponding Author:\nMariana Vidal, ISPA\u00adInstituto Universit\u00e1rio, Rua Jardim do Tabaco n\u00ba34,\nEmail: mariana-vidal@hotmail.com\nUse of Complementary and Alternative\nMedicine in a Sample of Women With\nBreast Cancer\nMariana Vidal1, Cl\u00e1udia Carvalho2, and Regina Bispo3\n Keywords\ncomplementary and alternative medicine, breast cancer, user profiles, communication, physician\u00adpatient\n2 SAGE Open\nperception of disease control (Wanchai et al., 2010), and\nIn the last decade patients began to have a more proactive\nrole in relation to their health and well-being, and the ability\nto discuss about treatments, both conventional and alterna-\ntive, with their health professionals is becoming increasingly\nmore important (Milden & Stokols, 2004). A study of Chang,\nBrodie, Choong, Sweeney, and Kerin (2011) showed that\nonly 17.2% of the doctors confessed that they were able to\nencourage their patients to use CAM. Most doctors say that\nthey do not have enough knowledge about the safety and\nefficacy of these techniques but were interested in learning\nIt's important that physicians are aware of the side effects of\nCAM, or about the possible interactions between substances\nto advise the use of CAM when it presents to be beneficial,\nor warn about the danger of its use when they present risks\nfor the health of the patient. Likewise, patients should be\nencouraged to share this information with their health care\nprofessionals through a conversation that should be per-\nformed carefully and should be made to feel that they are\ntaken seriously and are not criticized for using CAM\n(Werneke et al., 2004). A study conducted on women with\nbreast cancer showed that patients using herbal medicines or\nother products of oral intake, with exception of homeopathy,\ncommunicated to their doctor that they were using those sub-\nstances, which indicates that they expect that the doctor\ninform them about the potential risks. However, patients who\nresorted to quiropraxis, yoga, guided imagery, hypnosis, and\nacupuncture were least likely to inform their health profes-\nsionals, perhaps, because they feel that these practices do not\npresent risk to the treatment they are under and also because\nmany doctors do not believe in these modalities (Shen et al.,\nTo our knowledge, in Portugal no study has explored\nCAM use among cancer patients. The aim of the present\nstudy is to examine CAM usage in a sample of Portuguese\nwomen with history of breast cancer, in a comprehensive\nway by examining its association through access to a general\npractitioner,1 perceived satisfaction with conventional care,\nhealth perception, suffering from other chronic diseases, and\nperceived control over breast cancer.\nMethod\nThe data were obtained using a questionnaire based on two\nsections from the International Questionnaire to Measure\nUse of Complementary andAlternative Medicine (I-CAM-Q;\nQuandt et al., 2009), which aims to internationally assess the\nuse of CAM. This questionnaire includes a set of questions\nabout visiting health care providers from traditional medi-\ncine and alternative and complementary medicine.\nParticipants were asked to indicate the number of times the\nproviders were seen in the past 3 months, the main reason\nthey last saw each provider and how helpful the visit was.\nThe questionnaire included sociodemographic data (age,\nmarital status, education level, monthly income, and occupa-\ntion); questions about access to a general practitioner, satis-\nfaction with conventional care, health perception, existence\nof other chronic disease and perceived control over breast\ncancer, by using an item from the Brief Illness Perception\nQuestionnaire (Broadbent, Petrie, Main, & Weinman, 2006)\nthat aims to access the belief that the patient has about the\npossibility of their disease to be controlled and cured; and\nhealth status (information on body mass index, smoking and\nalcohol consumption, number of hours of sleep per night,\nand physical activity practice). The sample was collected in\nMovimento Vencer e Viver Lisboa (Reach to Recovery) in\nLisbon, Portugal. Participation was voluntary and partici-\npants did not receive any payment for participating in the\ninquiry. Questionnaires were anonymous and no personal\ninformation was asked for disclosure.\nStatistical Analyses\nParticipants were classified according to the use of CAM in\nthe past 12 months, as \"users\" (defined as using CAM at\nleast once in the past 12 months) or \"nonusers.\" The differ-\nences between CAM users and nonusers with respect to\nsociodemographic, clinical, and health characteristics were\ntested using a Pearson chi-square test or a Wilcoxon\u00adMann\u00ad\nWhitney test depending on the scale measurement of the\nvariable. The use/nonuse of CAM was modeled using a\nbinary logistic regression as a function of the mentioned\nvariables. The odds ratio (OR) and the correspondent 95%\nconfidence intervals (CI) were determined to measure the\neffect size for each variable while controlling the effect of\nthe other variables. Results were considered statistically sig-\nnificant at p < .05.All data were analyzed using the Statistical\nPackage for Social Sciences, version 19.\nResults\nA total of 107 individuals participated in this study. Of these,\nThe most frequently used types of CAM were natural prod-\nmentioned for using CAM were to increase well-being (50%)\nand to treat a long-term health condition (i.e., one that last\nmore than 1 month) or its symptoms (33%). Sixty-eight per-\ncent of the alternative medicines mentioned were considered\nvery useful. Among CAM users, 60% reported that they did\nnot discuss the usage of CAM with their physicians.\nThe perceived control over the breast cancer disease was\nfound to be a significant (p = . 002) predictor of CAM use (OR\nCAM is about one and a half times higher in participants with\na greater perceived control over the disease. Also, perceived\nVidal et al. 3\ncontrol over the breast cancer disease showed significant dif-\np < .001), with nonusers reporting a higher perceived control\nover the disease than users.

Natural products, psychotherapy, breathing\nexercises, meditation, and homeopathy were among the most\ncommonly used CAM practices. These results are supported\nby previous studies with cancer patients in which the most\nreported CAM were natural products (Boon et al., 2000;\nhomeopathy (Molassiotis et al., 2005; Steinsbekk et al.,\nData also reveal that a high number of patients do not\nreport the use of CAM to their physician, confirming pre-\nvious studies (Richardson, Sanders, Palmer, Greisinger, &\nlack of communication is associated with several factors,\nnamely, being afraid that the physician does not under-\nstand or disapproves of the usage, and that physicians tend\nto not ask the patient about CAM use. In an era where\npatients attend to have a more proactive role in relation to\ntheir health and their well-being, it is important that\npatients and physicians are able to discuss either conven-\ntional or alternative treatments to prevent its misuse, detri-\nmental interactions, and enhancement of personal control\nover disease.\nOur study suggests that use of CAM is popular among\nbreast cancer patients and that some variables may signifi-\ncantly explain the use of CAM. The small size of the col-\nlected sample and its nonprobabilistic nature limits this\nstudy's inference results; however, this study, with its limited\nsamples found similar results in previous reports on CAM\nuse with larger samples, suggesting that Portuguese breast\ncancer patients behave in a similar way regarding CAM use,\nthan other international samples studied. Nevertheless fur-\nther studies in a larger representative Portuguese samples are\nwarranted.\n"
