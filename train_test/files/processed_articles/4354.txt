    "abstract": "Abstract. The \"zograscope\" is a \"visual aid\" (commonly known as \"optical machine\" in the 18th\ncentury) invented in the mid-18th century, and in general use until the early 20th century. It was\nintended to view single pictures (thus not stereographic pairs) with both eyes. The optics approximately\neliminates the physiological cues (binocular disparity, vergence, accommodation, movement parallax,\nand image blur) that might indicate the flatness of the picture surface. The spatial structure of pictorial\nspace is due to the remaining pictorial cues. As a consequence, many (or perhaps most) observers\nare aware of a heightened \"plasticity\" of the pictorial content for zograscopic as compared with natural\nviewing. We discuss the optics of the zograscope in some detail. Such an analysis is not available\nin the literature, whereas common \"explanations\" of the apparatus are evidently nonsensical. We\nconstructed a zograscope, using modern parts, and present psychophysical data on its performance.\n",

The first part (Section 2) deals with the optical prop-\nerties of \"zograscopes.\" The second part (Section 3) is an account of a psychophysical enquiry into the\nvisual effects of such instruments.\n2 Optics of the zograscope\nOptical viewing aids\n\"Optical viewing aids\" are a fuzzily defined subset of optical devices designed to be used by the hu-\nman observer. \"Used by the human observer\" means that the retinal image is the final stage in the\noptical pathway of imaging instruments. The actual \"output\" is the visual awareness of the user of the\ninstrument, not some physical illuminance distribution. \"Imaging instrument\" implies that we ignore\nsuch things as gun sights (at least \"iron sights\" and the like), the theodolite and other surveying instru-\nments, and so forth. We also ignore microscopes and telescopes as specialized areas: we roughly aim\nat what could also be seen with the unarmed eye. Another--huge--area that we ignore are spectacles.\nWe mainly aim at vision aids for viewing pictures of \"normal\"--postcard to folio, say--size. Typical\nexamples of \"viewing aids\" then are hand magnifiers (reading glasses), viewboxes (Guckkasten), and\nso forth. The zograscope (Figure 1; see note 1 with a typical erroneous explanation of the function) is\nThe hand magnifier, often used by elderly people to read or younger people to view smallish\nitems like postage stamps, is a good example to introduce a few key issues. It is such a good exam-\nple because it is treated in virtually any book on introductory physics that has a chapter on optics\n(Halliday, Resnick, & Walker, 1996). In the conventional account, the glass is held closely in front of\nthe (single!) eye, the object being placed in the focal plane of the (positive) lens (Figure 2, left). \"The\"\nmagnification of the hand magnifier is usually defined as 250 mm divided by the focal length in mm.\nHere, 250 mm is the conventionally designated \"normal reading distance.\" The magnification is then\ndefined as the ratio of the angular size subtended by an object with the glass in normal use, and the\nZograscopic viewing\nsame object at normal viewing distance. So far so good. However, if you watch people actually using a\nhand magnifier, you will notice that they hold it at quite a distance, and look through it with both eyes\nopen (Figure 2, right). They move the glass back and forth, rarely having the object in the intended\nfocal plane. Some experimentation will soon teach you that a single hand magnifier can yield quite a\nrange of \"magnifications.\" Thus, the use is different from that assumed by the textbooks, and the effect\n(the magnification) is different too. The reason is that optics texts fail to take the actual eye use, and\nthe relation between visual awareness and optical input, into account.\nThese informal observations are fairly typical of the way viewing aids are treated in conventional\noptics (Hecht, 2002). Their actual use tends to be ignored, and replaced with an idealized account that\nmay be arbitrarily far from reality. As a matter of course, observers make eye movements, includ-\ning differential ones, change accommodation state and pupil diameter (important for depth of field).\nMoreover, the effect of the instrument, which is the visual awareness of the user, is not at all recog-\nnized for what it is. For instance, binoculars are usually stamped with their so-called \"magnification,\"\nwhereas the user notices no magnification at all, but an apparently diminished distance instead. There\nare many instruments for which no such convenient number is available. Examples are the Zeiss Ver-\nant and Synopter (note 2). The zograscope is another instance. These instruments have disappeared\nFigure 1. A typical specimen of the zograscope with original zograscope picture.\nFigure 2. Left: use of lens magnifier according to the optics texts; right: lens magnifier as actually used by most\npeople.\n194 Koenderink J, Wijntjes M, van Doorn A\nfrom the optics textbooks because they really belong to psycho-optics (a term framed by analogy with\n\"psycho-acoustics\"), a field that has no official standing. Yet an instrument like the zograscope was in\nuse for at least two centuries to the full satisfaction of its users.\nThe zograscope was apparently invented in the mid-18th century (or possibly earlier), and was\nin common use to at least the conclusion of the 19th century. Perhaps unfortunately, the etymological\norigin of the term remains unclear. It was a popular instrument for the well-to-do classes, much like\nthe stereoscope was in Victorian times. At the turn of the century (19th to 20th), one had even com-\nbined stereoscopes\u00adzograscopes (various examples can easily be found on the Internet), each having\nits specific use. Like stereo pairs, prints meant to be looked at with the zograscope are common enough\non the antiques market. They are easily recognized by their size, and especially the title, which always\nappears in mirror reversed print.\nPrinciple of the zograscope\nThe principle of the zograscope appears simple enough (Figures 3 and 4), although the explanations\noffered in various places are frequently nonsensical. The observer views a picture through a large\nlens of positive power. The picture is placed at the focal plane of the lens. The observer looks through\nthe lens with both eyes. The picture is scrutinized via eye movements. Eye movements are necessary\nbecause the field of view is quite large, about 30\u00ba\u00ad40\u00ba. Because the picture is at the focal plane, the\nobserver neither has to adjust vergence nor accommodation, as the fixation point is changed. The\ntwo eyes receive identical images. This removes effectively the physiological cues (Graham, 1965;\nHelmholtz, 1856), eg, binocular disparity, vergence, monocular movement parallax, head movement\nFigure 3. The principle of the zograscope. Both eyes obtain the same input. The \"object\" is at infinity. There is\nno vergence and no disparity. In these drawings we use an \"ideal\" zograscope, the lens is infinitely thin, and ray\ntracing uses the paraxial approximation. At left, the center of the picture is seen at infinity for both eyes. There is\nno vergence and no accommodation. At right, notice that the two eyes receive identical images of the (grating)\npicture. This illustrates the principle very well: the zograscope renders the viewer \"cyclopic.\"\nFigure 4. A 3D rendering of the beams involved in zograscopic vision. In this figure, the eyes are viewing in\nparallel directions for each pair of beams, thus revealing field curvature. However, such aberrations are easily\ncorrected by way of minor adjustments of the human visual system. The figure has been drawn for 4-mm pupil\nsizes. Notice the horizontal\u00advertical asymmetry of the system.\nparallax, accommodation, and blur, which might reveal that the picture is actually a flat surface cov-\nered with pigments in a particular simultaneous arrangement. As a result, pictorial space develops\nin \"monocular stereopsis,\" which results in a vivid impression of markedly increased \"plasticity\" as\ncompared with viewing the picture binocularly without the instrument. Monocular stereopsis is due to\nso-called \"pictorial cues.\" The effect is somewhat similar to viewing a large painting from a distance\nwith one eye closed, a case familiar from the literature on the visual arts. In the 20th century, Moritz\nvon Rohr (note 3), an optics engineer working at the Zeiss optical factory (note 4), developed \"syn-\nopters\" (note 5) that essentially achieved the same effect, although with (much) better optical quality.\nVon Rohr's designs were apparently inspired by his collaboration with Alvar Gullstrand (note 6), a\nDanish ophthalmologist with a keen interest in optics. Gullstrand frequently visited the Zeiss factory,\nhis native country Denmark lacking an important optical industry.\nAnother design with superior properties was the Doppelverant (again by von Rohr with input from\nGullstrand), essentially a high-quality stereoscope, used with two copies of a single image instead of a\nstereo pair. The plasticity achieved by the Doppelverant was frequently rated better than what could be\nachieved via the usual disparate images. The disparate images suffer from a marked \"coulisses effect,\"\nthat is, they tend to yield a depth stack of flattish, silhouette forms, instead of neatly rounded, volu-\nmetric pictorial shapes. In contradistinction, the Doppelverant yields pleasantly articulated (\"plastic\")\npictorial reliefs.\nThe appreciation of the plasticity resulting from monocular stereopsis has largely disappeared\nfrom the literature in the standard contemporary textbooks (Palmer, 2001; Vishwanath, 2001). In fact\n\"stereopsis\" is nowadays commonly defined as \"binocular stereopsis\" (note 7), and even the term\n\"monocular stereopsis\" is taken to be self-contradictory (Enright, 1991; Pollack, 1955; even as early\nas 1904, Clapar\u00e8de (1904) mentions \"paradoxical monocular stereopsis\"). This is perhaps somewhat\nsurprising, as the viewing of single images is still common enough, and one may hardly assume that\nthe viewers of holiday postcards (say) have no impressions of pictorial space, but are only aware of\nplanar patterns of colored patches. But the appreciation of the special charm of monocular pictorial\nspace appears to have been lost. The remarkable plasticity in such awareness was still common knowl-\nedge in the early 20th century.\nAnalysis of specific zograscope designs\nThe zograscope is a typical \"historical\" instrument, in that the design was not changed since its inven-\ntion in the 18th century. This is understandable for technical reasons: the need for a large lens with\ncomparatively short focal length does not lend itself to a manageable design. Occasionally one finds\nzograscopes that use a concave mirror instead of a lens. This at least removes a major defect of the\nlens, which is chromatic aberration. We have only seen such mirror devices for smallish pictures (less\nthan postcard format), again, an understandable constraint. A modern version of the zograscope might\nuse a (plastic) Fresnel lens, this would indeed be an advantage. Here we only analyze the classical\ndesign though.\nAt first blush, judging from some familiarity with traditional optical design principles (Hecht,\n2001; Herzberger, 1958), the zograscope appears to be a rather unlikely design. A single lens of that\naperture (ca. 1:3 to 1:4) is certain to have a large degree of spherical deviation on axis, and huge\namounts of astigmatic and comatic aberrations at 20\u00ba off axis. Moreover, the Petzval field curvature\n(note 8) has to be appreciable. Apart from these aberrations, there will additionally be a huge chro-\nmatic aberration for the typical glasses (standard crown) used for the lens. However, we propose that\nsuch notions are not appropriate, because they implicitly assume that the image-forming bundles are\nlimited by the outer diameter of the lens. However, the pupil diameters of the user's eyes, rather than\nthe outer diameter of the lens, limit the beams. Thus, one needs to consider a combination of two nar-\nrow beams, separated by the interocular distance, instead of a single wide one.\nMoreover, the optics of the zograscope should take the eye optics into account, including the\nmotility of the eyes. Thus, the optical system is not fixed, but changes as the observer changes fixation.\nObservers typically make minor corrective eye movements, and (depending upon age) accommoda-\ntion changes, small enough not to count as physiological cues, but enough to cancel various imperfec-\ntions of the optical system. This renders the full analysis of the zograscope a surprisingly complicated\nproblem, rather more complicated than that of many sophisticated, multicomponent optical systems\nsuch as camera lenses.\n196 Koenderink J, Wijntjes M, van Doorn A\nIn order to obtain a feeling for what is implied here, we discuss two simple cases. The first involves\nthe (indeed very significant) spherical aberration (note 9) of the lens, and the second involves the influ-\nence of (again very significant) field curvature (note 8).\nConsider spherical aberration (Figure 5, top). This is a serious on-axis aberration. The so-called\n\"focal length\" of the lens is the point at which rays parallel to the axis and, running at a short distance\nfrom it, converge. A ray parallel to the axis that enters the lens at some distance from the axis will meet\nthe axis at some distance from the focal point, toward the observer. For a ray that meets the lens near its\nboundary, this distance can easily amount to a few centimeters for the generic zograscope. Thus, one is\nperhaps led to take the spherical aberration very seriously. However, consider the case of the two eyes\nlooking into the direction of the axis (\"straight ahead\"). The beams defined by the pupils will converge\nat some point on the axis, away from the focal point. Is this at all problematic? We propose that it is\nnot a problem. For you may simply place the picture at the point where the beams cross the axis, and\nyou end up with an almost perfect system. The remaining spherical aberration is actually quite small,\nbecause the beam diameter is the pupil diameter (say, 4 mm) instead of the lens diameter (say, 10 cm).\nThis is a first example that illustrates that the standard insight into lens aberrations is of no use here.\nNext, consider the case of the Petzval field curvature (note 8; Figures 5 bottom, and 6). Suppose\nyou have correctly \"focussed\" the zograscope, that is to say, rays parallel to the axis at a distance of\nhalf an interocular distance from the axis meet the axis at the plane where the picture is. Now fixate\na point of the picture away from the axis. When the two eyes do not change vergence, field curvature\nwill make the two beams meet at some distance in front of the picture. Is this a problem? Again, not at\nall, for the observer easily rectifies this with a minor vergence adjustment. The vergence needed is too\nsmall to act as a depth cue, but the field curvature has been \"corrected.\" Notice that each of the two\nbeams converges to a point somewhat in front of the picture plane. Is this a problem? Again, no, for\na minor accommodation change (too small to act as a depth cue) easily takes care of that. This case is\nevidently more complicated than that of the spherical aberration, where no vergence or accommoda-\ntion changes were needed at all. It is harder to analyze in full detail.\nFigure 5. The upper figure illustrates spherical aberration, the lower pair field curvature. At top one notices that\nrays that enter parallel to the optical axis fail to meet the axis at a single \"focal point.\" Instead, one obtains a\ncuspidal caustic. At bottom left the eyes look perfectly parallel. At bottom right, a minor vergence \"corrects\" the\neffect of field curvature.\nIn order to study the actual performance of zograscopes, one needs to take the possible corrective\nactions of the observer's oculomotor system into account. This renders such a study complicated. It is\nvery different from the regular analysis used to design conventional optical imaging systems.\nWe studied the zograscope through ray tracing. We implemented the well-known ray-tracing\nalgorithm of Herzberger (1958) in Mathematica code (note 10). This allows us to implement various\nnonstandard methods with reasonable ease. We studied the zograscope with symmetrical biconvex,\nplan-convex, and convex-plan lenses (the latter differ only in orientation). Somewhat different from\nintuition (we put our money on the biconvex lens based on our experiences with standard optical\ndesigns), the best setup is the plan-convex lens (planar side at the observer side). Although the various\ncases show up significant differences in quality, all are \"good enough,\" thus suitable for zograscopic\nuse. We discuss only this best case here (plan-convex with planar side to the observer). The reverse\ndesign (convex side to the observer) is not much worse. The zograscopes we could examine had con-\nvex curvatures facing the observer, but we were in no position to examine the other side. Judging from\nother historical instruments we guess that most lenses were biconvex. They must have been a little\ninferior (though still serviceable) to our implementation.\nWe analyzed a design with a 120-mm diameter plan-convex lens, made of borosilicate crown\n65 mm and a pupil diameter of 4 mm. The \"effective focal length,\" defined by the axis crossing of a ray\nat half the interocular distance from the axis, is 271 mm, reckoned from the front of the lens. It is more\nthan 20 mm closer to the lens than the paraxial focal plane. We consider a picture of 200 mm wide.\nThe field curvature (radius of curvature 202 mm) is not very extreme (this is one aspect on which\nthe plan-convex configuration beats the convex-plan and biconvex ones), and is easily corrected for by\nvery minor vergence movements. At an eccentricity of 20\u00ba, a vergence of 1\u00ba is needed, at 10\u00ba less than\n0.3\u00ba. We find that the system has a number of aberrations that do not really fit the conventional tax-\nonomy very well. The blur regions for the left and right eyes are different (Figure 7), and may be astig-\nmatic \"lines\" of rather different length that meet at an angle. Then what is the relevant size of \"the\"\nblur circle? In our view, most likely the smallest one, as one easily checks by defocussing one branch\nof a stereoscope loaded with identical pictures. For the system analyzed here, the blur circle then does\nnot exceed a quarter of a millimeter at the far out corners of the image. For most of the picture, it is less\nthan a tenth of a millimeter. This implies that the zograscope performs fine with respect to resolution.\nWe encounter two aberrations that might possibly limit the zograscope's performance. One is dif-\nferential distortion and another (most serious) is chromatic aberration.\nThe plan-convex configuration minimizes distortion as compared with convex-plan or biconvex.\nDistortion in itself is not a major defect (except when one places an extreme weight on projective\nstructure), but the problem is that the left and right eyes receive mutual mirror-reversed versions of\nlaterally asymmetrical distortion (Figure 8). This is something that never occurs in the conventional\noptical systems. Is this a problem? We propose it is not, because most of the difference can be \"cor-\nrected\" via a minor vergence movement. What rests is a small disparity field about the present fixa-\nFigure 6. This figure illustrates field curvature for eyes that look perfectly parallel in any case. It is significant,\nthough not dramatical. Most importantly, it has no effect on visual awareness, because minor (unconscious)\nvergence movements correct for the \"problem.\"\n198 Koenderink J, Wijntjes M, van Doorn A\ntion point. For a point at the edge of the field of view (really worst case), looking 45\u00ba upward (again:\nworst case), we find a differential cyclorotation of 2\u00ba, a differential magnification of 3%, and a dif-\nferential deformation (magnification anisotropy) of 3%, the last perhaps suggesting a 14\u00ba obliquity of\nthe apparent frontoparallel plane. These numbers are really minor. The differential magnification and\ncyclorotation will be fully unnoticeable. The differential deformation might be, but probably will not.\nOver most of the visual field, the deviations are even much less than this. This might perhaps induce\nthe impression of a faintly curved picture plane. In practice (pictures of articulated scenes) one does\nnot see this at all. Perhaps one might notice it if one used checkerboard patterns as pictures though.\nThe chromatic aberration (note 11) is a major flaw of the system. The problem is that lateral chro-\nmatic aberration occurs mirror reversed in the two eyes. Thus, it leads to a significant chromatic dis-\nparity signal (Figure 9). This is indeed quite noticeable in a \"TV test image\" with vividly colored lines\nand squares. We do not really notice it in structured images, and we do not notice chromatic fringes\nin monochrome images. That is to say, any chromatic fringing is much less noticeable than in (even\nquality) consumer camera digital images taken at moderate \"wide angle\" settings. (In our experience\nthese are often objectionable.)\nBecause of the horizontal separation of the eyes, the zograscope is not rotationally symmetric\nabout the axis. There is a minor magnification difference of 3.25% between the vertical and horizontal\ndirections. All aberrations depend not only on the distance from the axis but also on the azimuthal\nlocation (angle with the horizontal). The numbers given above are all worst case.\nThe zograscope is even more complicated when one considers minor head movements (transla-\ntions and rotations), as are certain to occur in actual use. Longitudinal translations change the eye\nFigure 7. Here we show two extreme cases, the fixated point being at the boundary of the field of view. At left the\nfixation point is in the top right corner, at right at the top center. The blurring ellipsoids (containing two-thirds of\nthe traced rays) for the two eyes (drawn in red and blue) are very different. The smaller one dominates awareness.\nNotice that the \"blur size\" is quite small, even at the edge of the field. All measures are in millimeters. Pupil sizes\nof 4 mm were assumed. We did not take the Stiles\u00adCrawford effect (Stiles & Crawford, 1933) into account, which\nwill have a beneficial influence on resolution.\nFigure 8. Distortion is noticeable. What is really relevant is that it occurs mirror reversed in the two eyes. What\nreally counts is the difference modulo shift and size. It is only minor.\nrelief, and thus the lateral locations of the entrance beams in the case of off-axis fixations. Lateral\ntranslations affect the locations of the entrance beams even for straight ahead fixations. Thus, the\nzograscope is a remarkably complicated, dynamic optical system. In practice head attitude and loca-\ntion, as well as fixation directions (including vergence and cyclovergence movements), and states of\naccommodation are unknown. Pupil sizes will probably vary too, affecting the depth of field. The\ncharacterizations discussed above allow a reasonable insight into the performance of the system, but\nare in no way exhaustive.\n3 Psychophysical investigation of the effect of the zograscope\nIt is of some interest to compare measurements of pictorial relief evoked by pictures viewed directly\n(with both eyes) with those viewed zograscopically. Is there any evidence that zograscopic viewing\npromotes \"plasticity\"?\nIf there is any effect it has to be due to the removal of all but purely pictorial cues. That this has an\nimportant effect was widely known until the early 20th century, whereas this insight somehow became\nlost even before WW II. Thus, writing in 1941, Harold Schlosberg remarks on the first page (opening\nsentences of the paper):\nIn the period around 1910, when interest in stereoscopy was high, it was widely known that the \"plastic\"\neffect could be obtained almost as well by viewing a single picture through a lens as by the use of\ndisparate pictures in the binocular stereoscope. The phenomenon has been largely forgotten during\nthe last two decades, and does not seem to be mentioned in any of the standard introductory texts of\npsychology. ... A surprisingly large proportion of psychologists are unaware of the phenomenon, and\nsomewhat at a loss for an explanation. ... the plastic depth that can be obtained monocularly is very\nstriking, and must be seen to be appreciated. ... To summarize: the phenomenon of monocular plastic\ndepth is due to the release of certain monocular factors from overpowering cues, largely binocular, that\nFigure 9. Chromatic aberration is most likely the worst problem of the generic zograscope. Here are three blur\nellipsoids (red and blue for the left and right eye) at the spectral limits (top 405 nm and bottom 707 nm), and\nthe (dominant) spectral center (middle, 547 nm). All measures are in millimeters, whereas the effective viewing\ndistance is (roughly) 20 cm. This is the worst case, 20\u00ba off axis at the top right. Even this aberration is manageable.\n200 Koenderink J, Wijntjes M, van Doorn A\nshow the picture to be flat. (Schlosberg, 1941)\nPerhaps unfortunately, the \"proportion of psychologists\" unaware of the effect, and clueless as\nto an explanation, has increased to probably over 99% (one in a hundred \"in the know,\" our informal\nsampling would suggest perhaps one in a thousand). No modern textbook known to us mentions these\nevidently important (indeed, crucial to a proper understanding of pictorial perception--or even per-\nception as such) facts.\nJudging from the contemporary literature on visual perception, one might well expect that 18th-\nand 19th-century observers were simply deluded. In such a view, the instrument is nothing but a non-\nsensical \"Rube Goldberg\" type of contraption (note 12).\nOf course, this is simple enough to check through direct experiment. This might also yield a hint\nas to what one might mean by an ill-defined term like \"plasticity.\" In case the concept indeed is void,\nthen the experiment should reveal this to be the case. Of course, the zograscope has such a venerable\nhistory that one would have to make a strong case in order to denounce it nonsense. The second part\nof our paper is devoted to such a study.\nMethods\nThe zograscope used in the experiments\nWe constructed a zograscope from readily available (in any old laboratory that is) salvaged parts. The\nlens was a plan-convex element from a discarded epidiascope, which used to be powered by a carbon\narc source. The lens has a 12-cm diameter and an effective focal length of 380 mm. The dimensions\nBoth the iPad and the lens were mounted either on an optical bench (Figure 10) or in a wooden frame.\nWith the lens removed, observers could look through the empty aperture and view the iPad with\nboth eyes without the optics. This made it very convenient to collect measurements with and without\nthe zograscope.\nGeneric methods\nWe used the \"gauge figure method\" to collect data. The method has been described in detail at various\na pictorial relief map modulo absolute depth. Such depth maps are necessarily idiosyncratic. After\nall, monocular pictorial depth exists only in the mind of an observer. There is no obvious notion of\n\"veridical depth.\"\nThe implementation used in the experiments is written in MatLab, using the Psychophysics Tool-\nFigure 10. The zograscope used in the experiments was constructed on the basis of a large plan-convex lens,\nsalvaged from a discarded (carbon arc powered) epidiascope, and an iPad. These parts were mounted on a standard\noptical bench, making the instrument conveniently adjustable. Notice that we have omitted the diagonal mirror\nconventionally used in zograscopes. It is of no importance to our investigation.\nObservers were the authors. They are well acquainted with the task. We know from many years of\nexperience that \"naive observers\" yield similar results. The differences between the authors are easily\nas large as those we typically encounter in a group of naive observers.\nThe stimuli were two photographs of sculptures and one painting (Figure 11). The painting (by\nModigliani) is very unlike a photograph, and would by many be considered \"flat.\" Of the photographs,\none is technically \"frontal\" (actually taken downward, witness the floor tiles), the other \"oblique.\" The\nstimuli were selected because one might expect marked differences in pictorial relief.\n4 Experiment\nThe raw settings of the observers were converted to a pictorial relief representation, a surface depth\nmap modulo an arbitrary depth shift (we arbitrarily set the mean depth to zero). The conversion al-\nlows one to check the internal consistency of the data. Nothing extraordinary was detected in any case\n(either viewing condition, all observers, all stimuli). We will not report on this in detail, extensive\ndiscussions are available in the literature mentioned above. Here we start the analysis with the reliefs.\nThey are illustrated for one observer, both viewing conditions, and all three stimuli (Figures 12a\u00adc).\nDifferences between zograscopic and normal viewing are readily detectable by eye. We analyze\nthe data in more detail below.\nThe simplest analysis involves scatter plots of the depths of corresponding points in the two condi-\ntions (Figure 13). We find good correlations in the case of the Hermaphrodite image: coefficients of\ndetermination 0.97 for AD, 0.87 for JK, and 0.97 for observer MW, and also for the Danaid image:\ncoefficients of determination 0.99 for AD, 0.96 for JK, and 0.99 for observer MW. For the Modigliani\nimage, the correlations are much more variable over observers: coefficients of determination 0.70 for\nThe slopes of the regression lines indicate the depth of relief magnification for zograscopic rela-\ntive to normal viewing. The values are collected in Table 1 and Figure 14.\nThe values for the Modigliani stimulus are not very useful, because the correlation is low (see\nbelow). In the other instances, we find a range of relief magnifications, ranging from only 4% to almost\na factor of three. These magnifications apparently depend both on the observer and on the stimulus.\nIn all cases of interest (the case of the Modigliani is discussed below), they are in the same direction\nthough. Apparently, the zograscope tends to increase the depth of relief.\nIn the case of the Modigliani, it is evident that different parts of the image lead to different results.\nThis is immediately obvious from a straight clustering analysis (using the k-means algorithm (Hartigan\nthat different from that of the other stimuli. The existence of \"parts,\" which is very marked for observ-\ners AD and JK, is a phenomenon we have studied in detail before.\nOverall, the depth relief magnifications are all expanding, with one exception (one of the clusters\nof observer AD for the Modigliani stimulus).\nFigure 11.

This is an interesting issue, because there never existed anything remotely like a \"theory of the\nzograscope,\" although the notion of \"cue\" was understood in the 18th century (Berkeley, 1709). The\ninstrument was apparently \"invented\" by mere serendipity, starting from notions derived from expe-\nriences with view boxes, a fascination with lenses, and a desire to be able to use both eyes instead\nof looking through a single peephole. Nor is there much optical theory of modern origin. The ideas\nintroduced by Moritz von Rohr that led to his development of the synopter at the Zeiss factory at the\nbeginning of the 20th century, after the demise of the zograscope, are a first attempt at fundamental\nunderstanding. Roughly speaking, the zograscope works because it removes (at least to a large extent)\nthe physiological cues that reveal pictures as being planar surfaces covered with pigments in some\nsimultaneous configuration (as succinctly explained by Schlosberg, 1941, quoted above). Thus, its\nfunction is similar to that of the synopter, and, indeed, with very similar results (Koenderink, van\nDoorn, & Kappers, 1994). The effect is similar to that of closing an eye when looking at a painting, a\ntechnique that has served painters for centuries, and is still in widespread use. The zograscope is more\nconvenient, in that it allows the conventional use of both eyes. Literature on \"monocular stereopsis\"\nSchwartz, 1971; Streif, 1923) is generally in accordance with these findings. Thus, the \"explanation\"\nof the effect of zograscopic viewing is that it is a slightly complicated (due to the specific optical sys-\ntem) variety of synoptic viewing.\nWe find that the zograscopic effect indeed occurs. The depth of pictorial relief is significantly\nlarger with than without zograscopic viewing. As expected, the effect depends both upon the picture\nand on the observer. Thus--again, as expected--it is not possible to stamp the zograscope with a\nnumber \"depth magnification such and so.\" This is psycho-optics, not geometrical optics.\nIt is fairly obvious that a photograph of a brick wall in frontoparallel attitude is not going to reveal\nany \"zograscopic effect.\" The case of the Modigliani fits roughly in this ballpark, as Modigliani evi-\ndently painted in a way that preserves the awareness of the picture plane. Different from 19th-century\nacademic painters, who conceived of the picture plane as a \"window\" opening up to a \"pictorial\nworld,\" painters like Modigliani tried to preserve an awareness of the fact that pictures are actually flat\nobjects, even when depicting volumetric objects in space.\nTable 1. The slopes of the regression lines\nindicate the depth of relief magnification\nfor zograscopic relative to normal viewing.\nFigure 14. The depth relief magnifications due to zograscopic viewing. Here the magnifications are specified as\na percentage. (Thus unit magnification becomes 0%, a doubling becomes 100%, and so forth.) Red observer AD,\nyellow observer JK, blue observer MW.\n204 Koenderink J, Wijntjes M, van Doorn A\nThat observers react differently on \"synoptic viewing\" (as also approximately achieved by the\nzograscope) is both empirically evident (Koenderink et al., 1994), and theoretically likely. For instance,\nobservers with an amblyopic eye, or defective binocular depth vision, are likely to benefit little from\nsuch a viewing aid. This is an area in which empirical data are unfortunately scarce.\nIn summary, we analyzed the optics of the \"zograscope,\" constructed a functional implementation\nfit to work with the iPad, and presented psychophysical data for three observers. The function of the\nzograscope (different from the various explanations to be found in various places) is found to mini-\nmize the effect of physiological cues, and thus maximize the efficacy of the purely pictorial cues. From\nthe experimental data, we conclude that the zograscope indeed (as shown earlier for the synopter;\nKoenderink et al., 1994) tends to magnify depth of pictorial relief, depending on the pictorial content\nand on the observer. These results perhaps suggest that the notion of a psycho-optics (after the gener-\nally recognized psycho-acoustics) is perhaps a useful one.\n"
