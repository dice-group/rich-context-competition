Many different sources\nof information for estimating depth and distance have been identified, and it has been\nsuggested that different sources of perceptual information have different effective ranges\nand that their reliabilities vary across viewing conditions (Cutting and Vishton 1995). One\ntype of information that is of particular interest is information about direction of gaze. In\nprinciple, gaze direction toward a point on level ground can be used to measure egocentric\ndistance if eye-height is known. Gibson (1950, 1979) emphasized that the ground plane\nprovides a great deal of important visual information about distance, including optical flow,\nangular declination, and texture gradients. These ground-based sources of information\nare particularly useful for locomotor space (ie, what Cutting and Vishton called \"action\nspace\"). However, even when it comes to ground distance in locomotor space, both empirical\ndata and theoretical accounts of perceived distance remain difficult to integrate across\nvarious paradigms and theorists. For example, some evidence suggests that perceived ground\ndistance in locomotor space is increasingly compressed at greater distances (eg, Gilinsky\n1951; Ooi and He 2007) while some evidence suggests that it is roughly constantly compressed\n(eg, Foley et al 2004), and yet other evidence suggests it is essentially accurate (eg, Loomis et\nRecently, two theories have been proposed, which have the potential to explain a number\nof empirical findings concerning the perception of ground extents in locomotor space.\nOne theory is the intrinsic bias hypothesis (Ooi et al 2006). The other theory is the angular\nexpansion hypothesis (Durgin and Li 2011; Li and Durgin 2010). Although the two theories are\nsimilar inasmuch as they both attribute the misperception of distance to biases in perceived\nslant, the fundamental assumptions of the two theories are very different. In the present\nTwo theories of distance perception 369\npaper, we will review and compare how the two theories explain some empirical findings in\ndistance perception.\n2 Fundamental geometrical assumptions of the two theories\nThe fundamental assumption of the intrinsic bias hypothesis is that there might be a default\nrepresentation of space when no visual information is available. This default representation\n(or intrinsic bias) biases the perceived geographical slant of the ground plane (by an additive\nconstant, ), which in turn results in biases in perceived distance, as shown in the left side of\nIn contrast, the angular expansion hypothesis assumes that the perceived gaze declination\n' and the perceived optical slant ' are systematically biased (by a multiplicative factor of\nabout 1.5), so that the perceived distance D' is foreshortened but the perceived geographical\nslant of the ground plane is largely unchanged, as shown in the right side of Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Diagrams depicting the fundamental geometrical assumptions of the intrinsic bias hypothe-\nsis (left) and the angular expansion hypothesis (right).\n3 Evidence and predictions of the intrinsic bias hypothesis\nThe evidence of the assumption in the intrinsic bias hypothesis originally came from\nexperiments using a blind walking and gesturing paradigm (Ooi et al 2001; see also Loomis\n2001) conducted in a dark environment. When participants were asked to perceive the 3D\nlocation (ie, distance and height) of a dim target light in the dark and to indicate it by walking\nblindly to the perceived distance of the target and gesturing the perceived height with the\nhand, the indicated location always lay on an implicit surface slanted upward despite the\nAs shown in Figure 1, left, if the perceived ground plane is tilted upward by a constant\nangle , the perceived egocentric distance D' (which can be expressed by Equation 1, see Ooi\nand He 2007) would be compressed relative to the physical distance D',\nFigure 2 shows the perceived egocentric distance D' as a function of the physical distance\nD, based on the prediction of Equation 1 for three possible values of . We can see the\npredicted perceived egocentric distance is increasingly compressed when the physical\negocentric distance increases. Moreover, even small changes in  result in substantial\ndifferences in distance compression, especially for long distances. This pattern of egocentric\ndistance foreshortening is consistent with Gilinsky's (1951) observation of accelerating\ndistance compression using an equal apparent interval procedure.\nThe intrinsic bias hypothesis predicts that perceived exocentric sagittal distance would\nalso be foreshortened. As shown in Figure 3, if the perceived geographical slant of the ground\nFigure 2.

Moreover,\neven small changes in  would result in substantial difference in the distance compression\nespecially for long distances. This pattern of exocentric distance foreshortening is consistent\nwith Li et al's (2011) observation with an aspect ratio task.\nTwo theories of distance perception 371\nFigure 4. Predicted perceived exocentric distance foreshortening based on the intrinsic bias hypothe-\nsis.  is the assumed bias in the perceived geographical slant of the ground plane. In this simulation,\nthe near end of the exocentric extent is fixed at 10 m from the observer.\nAlthough the intrinsic bias hypothesis provides plausible explanations for perceived\ndistance foreshortening, it fails to predict the observed results in the distance fractionation\nexperiments. For example, Purdy and Gibson (1955) showed that participants could bisect or\ntrisect large egocentric distances fairly accurately. Lappin et al (2006) reported reliable but\nsmall errors (3% to 13% of the total bisected distance) in a distance bisection experiment, in\nwhich their participants always set the middle point too far from themselves.\nIn contrast, the intrinsic bias hypothesis predicts that the middle point should be set\nmuch too close to the observer (Figure 5). The perceived distance ratio D2'/D1' can be\nexpressed by Equation 3,\nFigure 6 shows the predicted (by Equation 3) set middle point as a function of the physical\nmiddle point in the distance bisection task. It is clear the predicted set middle point is too\nclose to the observer, which is inconsistent with the empirical observations (ie, Lappin et al\nThe reason that the intrinsic bias hypothesis cannot explain the distance fractionation\nresults is because the intrinsic bias hypothesis predicts that the perceived distance should\nalways be a non-linear function of physical distance (ie, the perceived distance is increasingly\ncompressed), as shown in Figures 2, 4, and 6. In fact, the intrinsic bias hypothesis does not\ndistinguish between the perceived egocentric and exocentric distance. However, there is\nsubstantial evidence suggesting that perceived egocentric distance is a linear function of the\nphysical distance while the perceived exocentric distance is not (Li et al 2011; Loomis et al\nFigure 5. Diagram depicting the performance in the distance bisection task based on the assumption\nof the intrinsic bias hypothesis.\nFigure 6. Predicted set middle point as a function of physical middle point in the distance bisection\ntask, based on the intrinsic bias hypothesis.  is the assumed bias in the perceived geographical slant\nof the ground plane.\n4 Evidence and predictions of the angular expansion hypothesis\nAs shown in Figure 1, right, the angular expansion hypothesis is based on the assumption\nof exaggerations in two perceptual angular variables--the perceived optical slant and the\nperceived gaze declination. There is convergent evidence that perceived optical slant is\nexaggerated. For example, Durgin et al (2010) showed that, for small slants within reach, a\n34\u00b0 slant from horizontal was judged to be 45\u00b0 from horizontal. Moreover, the effect is spatial,\nnot verbal: a 56\u00b0 slant from vertical was judged to be 45\u00b0 from vertical, and when the task\nwas to indicate the bisection point between horizontal and vertical, a surface about 34\u00b0 was\nindicated using standard psychophysical staircase procedure.\nThere is also convergent evidence showing that perceived gaze declination is exaggerated\nas well. For example, Li and Durgin (2009) asked participants to indicate gaze declination to\ndistant targets (viewed from upper story windows) using both verbal estimation and 2D ori-\nTwo theories of distance perception 373\nentation matches. They found systematic exaggeration in perceived gaze with both measures.\nDurgin and Li (2011) asked participants to verbally estimate their gaze declinations to targets\non the ground (with about 6\u00b0 geographical slant) and found systematical exaggerations with\na linear gain of about 1.5. They also asked different participants to indicate the bisection\npoint of gaze declination between horizontal and vertical and found that a gaze declination\nof about 31\u00b0 was indicated. Li et al (2011) showed that exaggeration in perceived gaze angle\n(with a linear gain of about 1.5) can perfectly explain the egocentric distance foreshortening\nrelative to the horizontal and vertical distances (Higashiyama and Ueyama 1988).\nA direct effect of the angular expansion hypothesis is the egocentric distance foreshorten-\ning (Figure 1, right). The perceived egocentric distance can be expressed either in terms of\nthe perceived gaze declination ', ie, D' = H/tan('), or in terms of the perceived optical slant\n', ie, D' = H/tan('). The perceived gaze angle is a linear function of actual gaze angle from\nIn contrast, the perceived optical slant ' has been found to be not only a function of\nactual optical slant  but also a function of viewing distance D (Li and Durgin 2010), ie\nBecause the slant gain k1 is close to 1.5, if we fix k1 to 1.5 and force C to 0, the perceived\noptical slant function can be simplified as\nEquation 4 and 5 suggest that, when looking at a flat ground plane, the perceived optical\nslant and the perceived gaze angle would be similar for near distances, but they would be\ndivergent at far distances (ie, the ground plane may look tilted up at far distance). Therefore,\nthe perceived distance function would be different depending on which angular variable\n(gaze angle or optical slant) is used to determine the perceived distance. For example,\nthe perceived egocentric distance would be linearly compressed if it is determined by\nperceived gaze angle alone (Figure 7, solid line)--but perceived egocentric distance would\nbe increasingly compressed if it is determined primarily by perceived optical slant (Figure 7,\ndashed line).\nThis dual feature of the angular expansion hypothesis allows it to account for differences\nobserved between the perceived egocentric distance function and the perceived exocentric\ndistance function (Loomis et al 1992), which could not be explained by the intrinsic bias\nhypothesis. To account for an observed perceived distance function using the angular\nexpansion hypothesis, we need to figure out which visual information (ie, optical slant\nor gaze angle) is used primarily by the visual system to determine the perceived distance. For\nexample, in most egocentric distance perception studies, the perceived gaze angle is more\nreliable than the perceived optical slant (especially when distance is far). This is because\nwhen the distance is far, the visual information for perceiving optical slant (eg, the texture\ngradients and the disparity gradient) becomes less reliable. In contrast, the reliability of\nperceived gaze declination seems largely unaffected by distance. Thus, in order to model\nperceived egocentric distance, the gaze model (Equation 4) would be appropriate. As shown\nin Figure 7, the gaze model predicts a nearly linear relationship between the perceived\negocentric distance and physical egocentric distance, which is consistent with most direct\nmeasures of egocentric distance (Foley et al 2004; Loomis et al 1992; see also Loomis and\nFigure 7. Predicted perceived egocentric distance functions based on the angular expansion hypothe-\nsis when the perceived distance is determined by perceived gaze angle alone (solid line) or by perceived\noptical slant alone (dash line).\nFor the distance fractionation tasks (ie, distance bisection or trisection), because the\nvisual angles subtended by the two sagittal extents are relatively large, the gaze model would\nstill be appropriate to model the perceived distances. Because the gaze model predicts a\nlinear relationship between the perceived and physical distance (Figure 7), it predicts nearly\naccurate performance in the distance fractionation task (as shown by Purdy and Gibson 1955).\nThe reason that Lappin et al (2006) found the middle point set was too close to the observer\n(especially in the lobby and hall way conditions) may be because the indoor environment\nshifts the perceived horizon downward (Messing and Durgin 2005), which in turn changes\nthe perceived gaze declination and perceived distances (Ooi et al 2001).\nTo model the perceived exocentric distance is more complicated because in different\ntasks the relative reliability of perceived gaze angle and of perceived optical slant could be\ndifferent. To model the perceived exocentric sagittal distance D' using the perceived gaze\ndeclination alone we can use Equation 6 (Figure 8, top),\nwhere H is the observer's eye height; 1 and 2 are the physical gaze declination to the\nfar and near targets, respectively; and 2-1 is the physical visual angle subtended by the\nexocentric sagittal distance extent.\nAccording to Equation 6, the reliability of the perceived exocentric sagittal distance D'\nwould depend not only on the reliability of the perceived gaze declinations to the far and near\ntargets (ie, 1.51 and 1.52) but also on the reliability of the perceived visual angle subtended\nby the distance extent (ie, 1.5(2-1)). If the physical visual angle of the sagittal extent is small,\nits perceived value may not be reliable. This suggests the gaze model may not be appropriate\nTwo theories of distance perception 375\nFigure 8.

The white circles represent the perceived targets.\nto model perceived exocentric sagittal extent if the physical visual angle of the sagittal extent\nis small.\nWhen the visual angle of the sagittal distance is small and the gaze model is not\nappropriate to model the perceived exocentric distance, we can use the optical slant model\n(Equation 5). But we need assumptions. If the task involves only an isolated exocentric\nsagittal extent (Figure 8, middle), we may need to assume the observer can approximately\naccurately perceive the frontal projected distance, d, of the sagittal extent, D (ie, d'  d). This\nassumption is based on the size constancy. We then have\nSubstituting ' with Equation 5 we have\nThis model can be used to explain Gilinsky's (1951) finding. Gilinsky asked her participants\nto successively produce a standard length (1 meter or 1 foot) along the ground starting from\ntheir feet. Although she conceptualized her study as one of perceived egocentric distance,\nher task clearly involved perception of isolated exocentric sagittal distance, which can be\nmodeled by Equation 7. Figure 9 shows the (angular expansion) model-predicted result of\nGilinsky's study (using Equation 7, with k = 1), which is fairly similar to her observation(1).\nFigure 9. The egocentric distance function derived by applying the optical slant model of the angular\nexpansion hypothesis (ie, Equation 7) to Gilinsky's (1951) successive equal apparent interval procedure\n(circles) compared to Gilinsky's hyperbolic-space model (thick line) of her data.\n5 Similarity between the two hypotheses\nLoomis and colleagues have employed an aspect ratio task to study perceived exocentric\nsagittal ground distance (eg, Loomis et al 1992; Loomis and Philbeck 1999), which involves\ncomparison between the sagittal ground extent D and a frontal extent W next to it (Figure 8,\nbottom). To model the aspect ratio task we only need to assume the perceived ratio between\nthe frontal projection of the sagittal distance and the frontal extent approximates its physical\nratio (ie, d'/w'  d/w). With this assumption, we can model the perceived aspect ratio R' (ie,\nD'/w'), ie\nLi and Durgin (2010) have shown that the optical slant model can well explain the\nobserved results of the aspect ratio experiments (ie, Kudoh 2005; Loomis et al 1992; Loomis\nand Philbeck 1999). In fact, the intrinsic bias hypothesis could also well explain the aspect\n(1) Gilinsky's observed data can be well fit by a hyperbolic function D' = A\u00b7D/(A+D), where constant A\nTwo theories of distance perception 377\nratio data (Ooi et al 2006). Essentially, both models attribute the foreshortening in perceived\nexocentric sagittal distance to the exaggeration in perceived slant. Whereas the intrinsic\nbias hypothesis assumes a constant exaggeration (ie, '=+) due to the intrinsic bias, the\nangular expansion hypothesis assumes a nonlinear function of the perceived optical slant\n(ie, '=1.5+k\u00b7ln(D)).\nMathematically,  in the intrinsic bias model corresponds to 0.5+k\u00b7ln(D) in the optical\nslant model. Figure 10 shows the 0.5+k\u00b7ln(D) as a function of viewing distance D and of k. It\nis clear that when the distance is long (ie, > 10 m), 0.5+k\u00b7ln(D) approaches a nearly constant\nvalue. This helps explain why the intrinsic bias model (by assuming a constant slant error) is\nsimilar to the optical slant model in explaining the results of aspect ratio tasks.\nFigure 10. The component, 0.5 + k\u00b7ln(D), as a function of viewing distance D and of k. This component\nin the optical slant model corresponds to the slant error  in the intrinsic bias hypothesis.\n6 Dissimilarity between the two hypotheses\nThere are many differences between the intrinsic bias hypothesis and the angular expansion\nhypothesis, but one important difference is that the angular expansion hypothesis assumes\nthe gaze declination is perceptually exaggerated while the intrinsic bias hypothesis assumes\nit is accurately perceived. Both assumptions have supporting evidence.\nOoi et al (2001, 2006) found that when participants performed the blind walking and\ngesturing task to a previewed target light in an otherwise dark environment, their walked\ndistance and their gestured height often deviated from the physical distance and height of\nthe target, but the implied gaze declination remained approximately accurate. How does the\nangular expansion hypothesis account for this result?\nThere is evidence that action (performance) is calibrated to visual experience (Harris\n1963; Li and Durgin 2012). That is, accurate performance does not necessarily depend on\naccurate visual perception but may depend on correct expectation of the outcomes of motor\nactions. If action performance is well calibrated to visual experience, then action will be\naccurate even when there is perceptual bias in visual experience. A good example of the\ncalibrated action idea is prism adaptation (Helmholtz 1867; Held and Freedman 1965; Ooi\net al 2001). When visual perception is distorted by the prism in front of the eyes, the action\nsystem can quickly adapt to the changed perceptual consequences of actions by modifying\nthe expected effects of actions (learned/calibrated through feedback). For example, to reach\n(apparently) forward to a target while wearing displacement prisms requires a different\nmotor action than the one required when the prisms are off. Upon removal of the prisms, an\nerror in the opposite direction of the action can be observed due to recalibrated expectation\nof the action. Because such adaptation does not always transfer to an unadapted effector,\nsuch as the other hand, Harris (1963) noted that the adaptation is proprioceptive.\nIn locomotion, there is evidence that the perceived self-motion speed is calibrated to\noptical flow speed. After being adapted to walking on a treadmill towed behind a tractor (in\nwhich optical flow speed is inconsistent with biomechanical speed), participants showed\nsubstantial errors in blind walking to a previewed target (Rieser et al 1995). When the\nbiomechanically perceived self-motion speed was faster, participants walked too long\n(because they perceived the self motion speed being too slow)--but when optical flow\nspeed was faster, they walked too short (because they perceived the self motion speed being\ntoo fast). If perceived gaze declination is exaggerated, as proposed in the angular expansion\nhypothesis, perceived optical flow (created by relative motion of the ground plane) would be\nslower than the physical optical flow. After adaptation, people might walk longer (than the\nperceived distance) to a previewed target. Thus, their walked distance would be about right\n(as the physical target distance) because, although the perceived distance is foreshortened,\nthe perceived self motion speed is also underestimated. Like prism adaptation, these effects\non locomotion are also effector specific (Durgin et al 2003).\nFigure 11. Diagrams of explanation of the nearly accurate indication of the perceived gaze declination\nin the blind-walking and gesturing tasks. The lower plots are the physical situations while the upper\nplots (inside the bubbles) are the perceived situations according to the angular expansion hypothesis.\nFigure 11 shows a possible explanation of the nearly accurate indication of perceived gaze\ndeclination in the blind walking and gesturing performance (ie, Ooi et al 2001, 2006). In a dark\nenvironment, participants may perceive two targets, T1 and T2, as being in the same location\nT' (with perceived distance D' and perceived height H'; Figure 11, left). The perceived gaze\ndeclination is exaggerated according to the angular expansion hypothesis, as illustrated in\nthe thought bubbles for each case. However, during blind walking, the participants also\nunderestimate their self motion speed (due to calibration to the angular expansion) so that\ntheir physically walked distance D is longer than their perceived walked distance D'. Thus,\nalthough the perceived gaze declination of the target is greater than it is, the indicated gaze\ndeclination (by the gesture) still falls along the line of their true gaze declination simply\nbecause their actions are already calibrated (Figure 11, right).\nTwo theories of distance perception 379\n7 Advantages of the angular expansion hypothesis\nAs we have discussed, there are many situations in which the intrinsic bias hypothesis makes\npredictions that are similar to those of the optical slant model of the angular expansion\nhypothesis. Thus, most of the empirical data that could be explained by the intrinsic bias\nmodel can also be well accounted for by the optical slant model of the angular expansion\nhypothesis. However, the angular expansion hypothesis, because it incorporates biases in\nperceived gaze declination as well, can also explain empirical findings in distance perception\nthat the intrinsic bias hypothesis cannot explain (eg, evidence that perceived egocentric\ndistance is nearly a linear function of actual egocentric distance).\nBecause the intrinsic bias hypothesis is constructed on the assumption of a bias in\nperceived geographical slant of the ground plane, it is constrained primarily to explaining\nbiases in perceived distance on the ground plane. In contrast, the angular expansion\nhypothesis is built on assumptions of misperception in angular variables, which allows\nit not only to explain the biases in perceived distance but also to account for the biases in\nto account for the biases in perceived height (eg, Li et al 2011). For example, the angular\nexpansion model of hill perception based on the optical slant model provides an excellent fit\nto published slant data (Li and Durgin 2010). Moreover, the fact that downhill surfaces look\nsteeper than they are is also difficult to understand based on the intrinsic bias hypothesis, but\nit can be quantitatively understood by the angular expansion theory (Li and Durgin 2009).\n8 A note on reports of non-Euclidean properties of visual space\nStudies of the geometry of visual space often conclude that visual space possesses non-\nground-based extents, but many have not. The angular expansion theory supposes that,\nlocally, certain angular variables are misperceived and that this results in distortions of visual\nspace that are locally consistent with Euclidean analyses.\nThere are a variety of findings and theories that are lumped together as evidence for\nnon-Euclidean space, but some of these, we believe, can be interpreted as locally Euclidean\nbut non-veridical estimation of local spatial (angular) variables. For example, Foley et al\n(2004) concluded that visual space was non-Euclidean, despite using a model of perceived\nsize that was locally Euclidean once the angles and egocentric distances in the underlying\nequations were assumed to be distorted. That is, Foley et al's model suggests that perceived\nspatial variables are locally consistent with Euclidean axioms. However, Foley et al treated the\nangular distortions as convenient fictions in their model. In contrast, the angular expansion\ntheory has measured some of them directly and found that perceived angles appear to be\nexplicitly distorted in perceptual experience (Durgin and Li 2011; Li and Durgin 2009).\nWhile visual space may be locally distorted in a manner that is consistent with Euclidean\nanalyses, these distortions will certainly lead to global inconsistencies with Euclidean\n(2) Although the intrinsic bias hypothesis is qualitatively consistent with uphill slant exaggeration,\nit cannot quantitatively explain uphill slant perception. The deduced  is usually small (eg, 2\u00b0 or\n3\u00b0 in a full cue environment, Ooi and He 2007) but the exaggeration in perceived hill slant is much\nlarger (Proffitt et al 1995). Crucially, the intrinsic bias would predict underestimation in perceived\ndownhill slope, which is inconsistent with the empirical findings of downhill slant exaggeration (Li\nand Durgin 2009; Ross 1974). In contrast, the gaze model of the angular expansion hypothesis provides\na quantitatively precise explanation of downhill slant exaggeration (Li and Durgin 2009).\nprinciples. For example, Koenderink et al (2000) examined the global Euclidean properties\nof large-scale space perception using an exocentric pointing task in a field of tall grass\nthat minimized the availability of ground-based information. They showed that perceived\norientations across views implied a global space that was non-Euclidean. These findings\ncould be understood as resulting from local errors in recovering angular variables, such as\noptical slant of the surface of the pointer (Li and Durgin 2010) and/or egocentric direction\nto the pointer and target (Philbeck et al 2008, Experiment 3). It is only when comparing\njudgments across views (ie, over wide angular separations) that it becomes clear that these\nparticular tasks produce implied contradictions to Euclidean principles, which may be\nresolved by assuming either that (1) global perceived space is non-Euclidean or (2) that the\nvisual system is not designed to represent (or provide conscious access to) global space in\nthis way. Either of these conclusions is theoretically important, but neither contradicts the\nangular expansion theory.\nWe therefore emphasize here that the theories being contrasted in the present article\nconcern local (rather than global) estimation of spatial structure and that these theories\nassume the availability of ground information. Of course, even these criteria are insufficient\nto exclude all cases that have been described as non-Euclidean. For example, Norman\net al (2005) used a ground-based spatial task in which 8 participants tried to position\npoles (moved by experimenters) into equilateral ground shapes. The researchers found\nbetween-participant variability in performance of this task and also found alternative results\nwhen a slightly different task was used and concluded that there was no unique geometric\nrepresentation that fit all observers. Using much larger N, however, Li et al (2011) reported\nmean trends in similar large-scale shape matching tasks that seem to reflect highly stable\ngeometrical relationships consistent with locally Euclidean models (consistent with angular\nexpansion). Importantly, these data patterns closely replicated those reported in studies by\nHigashiyama and Ueyama (1988). Although there may be strategic variability in performance\nbetween individual observers in a single study (eg, Durgin et al 2012), and there may be task\neffects related to the kinds of information available for various tasks, we would emphasize\nthat there also appear to be stable patterns of perceptual bias across observers that have\nbeen replicated on different continents, in different centuries.\nIn conclusion, although the two theories considered here assume that a Euclidean analysis\nis locally possible, this assumption has not been made lightly. That is, the specific data that\nhas been amassed in support of these ideas is consistent and stable across many laboratories.\nNeither does the use of Euclidean geometry in these models contradict the alternative claim\nthat local judgments of size and orientation are often non-veridical in ways that necessarily\nimply global inconsistencies with Euclidean assumptions. We do not wish even to claim that\nlocal geometry is always consistent with Euclidean assumptions, but only that the present\nmodels, which utilize Euclidean axioms, can provide a coherent account of a great deal of\ndata concerning the perception of ground extents in locomotor space.\n9 Conclusions\nIn the present paper, we reviewed and compared two theories regarding the perception of\nground extents in locomotor space. The intrinsic bias hypothesis and the angular expansion\nhypothesis are based on very different geometrical assumptions, but they make similar\npredictions about exocentric ground distance tasks. Although both hypotheses attribute\nperceived exocentric ground distance foreshortening to perceived slant exaggeration, the\nangular expansion hypothesis also accounts for egocentric distance foreshortening with\nexaggeration in perceived gaze declination. This allows the angular expansion hypothesis\nto distinguish two types of ground distance foreshortening--linear compression (mainly\nTwo theories of distance perception 381\ncaused by exaggeration in perceived gaze declination) and non-linear compression (mainly\ncontributed by exaggeration in perceived optical slant). Whereas both hypotheses account\nfor exocentric sagittal ground distance compression equally well, the angular expansion\nhypothesis can explain a broader range of empirical findings concerning spatial biases,\nincluding linear compression in perceived egocentric ground distance, exaggeration in uphill\nand downhill slant perception, and anisotropy between perceived egocentric ground distance\nand frontal height.\ntional Eye Institute.
