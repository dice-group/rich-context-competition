    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The rising availability through the Internet of commonly\nabused prescription drugs has raised public health concerns. We\nexamined whether the growth of US prescription drug abuse may be\nexplained by the parallel growth in high-speed Internet use. We find that\nfor every 10 percent increase in high-speed Internet use at the state level,\nassociated treatment facility admissions for prescription drug abuse rose\nby 1 percent. Admissions for abuse of alcohol, cocaine, and heroin, which\nare not readily purchased online, had minimal or negative growth during\nthe same period. The results suggest that better surveillance of online\nprescription drug sales is warranted, and aggressive efforts to curb\nillegitimate online pharmacies may be necessary.\nOnline pharmacies have grown tre-\nmendously in recent years. From\nsales of prescription drugs in-\n$3.2 billion.1 Although the growth of legitimate\nonline pharmacies has benefited patients\nthrough lower costs and added convenience, im-\nportant concerns have been raised about the\ngrowth in illegitimate Internet pharmacies that\npromote unfettered access to both ordinary pre-\nscriptionmedicationsand controlleddrugswith-\nout any direct physician examination and some-\ntimes without physician approval.1\u00ad7\nSeveral studies have offered evidence that the\ndramatic increase in US admissions to treatment\nfacilitiesfor abuse of prescription drugs--includ-\nin admissions for abuse of narcotic painkillers8--\nmay partially stem from wider online availability\nAlthough the majority of online pharmacies\noperate no differently than standard brick-and-\nmortar pharmacies that rely on prescriptions\noriginating from actual doctor-patient inter-\nactions, a growing number of illegitimate phar-\nmacies have emerged that do not abide by these\nsafeguards.2,6,11 Illegitimate pharmacies have\ntaken on two forms, neither of which require a\npatient to visit a doctor or other practitioner in\nadvance to obtain a prescription: \"questionnaire\npharmacies,\" which require users only to com-\nplete an online questionnaire before medication\nis dispensed, and \"rogue pharmacies,\" which\nrequire neither a prescription from a physician\nor other practitioner in advance nor the provi-\nsion of a medical history.\nIn 2007 the National Center on Addiction and\nSubstance Abuse at Columbia University esti-\nmated that 581 websites offered to sell controlled\nprescription drugs; only two of the pharmacies\nwere legitimately certified by the National Asso-\nciation of Boards of Pharmacy.12 Nearly 85 per-\ncent of the websites did not require a prescrip-\ntion, and of the remaining sites, 57 percent\nrequired only that a prescription be faxed, which\nmade it possible for customers to forge prescrip-\ntions or use the same prescription multiple\nResponding to concerns about the rising avail-\nability of controlled prescription drugs on the\nInternet, in 2008 the federal government\nenacted the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Con-\nsumer Protection Act.

It amended the existing Controlled Sub-\nstances Act of 1970 by prohibiting the delivery,\ndistribution, and dispensing of controlled pre-\nscription drugs over the Internet without a pre-\nscription from a physician who interviewed and\nexamined the patient in person.13\nMonths later, in November 2009, the Food\nand Drug Administration issued warnings to\nmore than 100 online pharmacies for prescrib-\ning violations that included the sale of controlled\ndrugs without prescriptions and, in some instan-\nces, the sale of medications not yet approved for\ndistribution. An example was the antiobesity\nmedication Acomplia.14\nDespite the growing presence of illegitimate\npharmacies on the Internet and federal regula-\ntions seeking to curb them, relatively little is\nknown about rates of prescription drug abuse\noriginating from these pharmacies and, more\nimportant, whether the observed increase in\noverall prescription drug abuse may partially\nstem from wider online availability. Survey evi-\ndence from small, locally conducted samples, as\nwell as national samples of prescription drug\nabusers, estimate that between 1 percent and\n11 percent of controlled prescription drug abus-\ners purchased their medications online. Most\nsurveys attribute approximately 3 percent of\nSurveys may underestimate the prevalence of\nInternet-based prescription drug abuse. People\nmost likely to purchase controlled prescription\ndrugs online may not have been included in sur-\nveys because of where those surveys were con-\nducted. For example, surveys of patients at meth-\nadone clinics may yield a downward-biased\nestimate of online prescription drug purchasing\nbecause Schedule II drugs such as methadone are\nmore difficult to acquire online than drugs in\nSchedule IV such as zolpidem (Ambien).16 Con-\ntrolled substance schedules are generally de-\nfined by the potential for abuse; higher sched-\nules (III and IV) consist of drugs with lower\npotential for abuse. As another example, surveys\nwill naturally not include those involved in the\nillegal street distribution of controlled prescrip-\ntion drugs.\nThe National Drug Intelligence Center at the\nDepartment of Justice reports that large\namounts of Schedule III and IV medications\nare purchased through the Internet by local drug\ndealers. The center also reports increasing\ninvolvement of street and motorcycle gangs in\nthe distribution of controlled prescription drugs\nacquired online.16,17 Wider availability of con-\ntrolled prescription drugs on the Internet may\ntherefore affect rates of abuse not only through\nindividuals purchasing drugs but also through\norganized purchasing and local distribution.\nIn addition to the limited survey evidence on\nabuse of controlled prescription drugs acquired\nthrough Internet pharmacies, other studies of\nillegitimate online pharmacies have examined\nthe ease with which prescription drugs may be\nobtained without valid prescriptions or doctor-\npatient interactions. In each of these studies,\nincluding a 2004 study by the Government Ac-\ncountability Office,4 research investigators at-\ntempted to purchase controlled prescription\ndrugs online and demonstrated readily available\naccess to commonly abused prescription drugs\nsuch as narcotic pain killers, stimulants, sedative\nhypnotics, and anxiolytics (drugs for treating\nThe extensive availability of commonly abused\nprescription drugs on the Internet raises the pos-\nsibility that widespread Internet growth may it-\nself have contributed to the observed trend in\nprescription drug abuse. During the period\nties for nonheroin narcotics such as oxycodone\nincreased 374 percent, while admissions for al-\ncohol abuse actually declined by 5 percent,8 sug-\ngesting that general trends in substance abuse\nbehavior alone may not explain the growth in\nnarcotic painkiller abuse.\nDuring this same period, Internet use grew. In\nNearly half of those households were using the\nInternet for purposes that included health care.20\nAlmost all of this growth in overall Internet use\nstemmed from growth in high-speed access, and\nWe explored whether overall growth in Inter-\nnet use may partly explain observed prescription\ndrug abuse growth in the United States. To gauge\nthis, we used state-level data on high-speed In-\nternet penetration and admissions to substance\nabuse facilities for treatment of controlled pre-\nscription drug abuse. Internet-based dispensing\nof general prescription drugs increased nearly\nto widerInternetuse by consumers.1 By thissame\nmechanism, growth in Internet use may have\nplausibly led to the purchase and abuse of con-\ntrolled prescription drugs also available online.\nStudy Data And Methods\nTo test the hypothesis that increases in Internet\nuse have been partially responsible for recent\nincreases in prescription drug abuse rates, we\nobtained annual state-level data on high-speed\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

We assumed that Internet\ngrowth could more plausibly be linked to pre-\nscription drug abuse growth if it were also un-\nassociated with substance abuse growth among\nsubstances not readily purchasable online.\nInternet Use We measured Internet penetra-\ntion across states using publicly available data\nfrom the Federal Communications Commission\nhigh-speed Internet deployment database. In\n2000 the commission instituted a formal data-\ncollection program to gather information about\nstate-level subscriptions to high-speed Internet\nservices.22 Among other information, Internet\nservice providers were required to report the\nnumber of high-speed Internet lines (defined\nas carrying more than 200 kilobits in one direc-\ntion) to residential customers in each state.\nCombining this information with intercensal\nstate population estimates from the Census Bu-\nreau (provided each year with a reference date of\nJuly 1), we calculated the number of residential\nInternet lines per capita for each state and year\nestimate of state-level Internet use. Growth in\nthis use has been associated with state-level\ngrowth in other major online markets, including\nRates Of Prescription Drug Abuse Annual,\nstate-level estimates of prescription drug abuse\nare generally difficult to obtain. As a baseline\nmeasure of prescription drug abuse, we used\ndata on treatment admissions to substance abuse\nprograms in the United States, which are pub-\nlicly available from the Treatment Episode Data\nSet maintained by the Substance Abuse and\nMental Health Services Administration.8 The\ndata set consists of treatment admissions to pub-\nlic and private substance abuse programs receiv-\ning public funding; the unit of observation is\ntreatment admission to a substance abuse fa-\ncility.\nEach observation contains information on the\nsubstance abused, including alcohol, cocaine,\nheroin, prescription opiates (including syn-\nthetic opiates), benzodiazepines and other\nanxiolytics, barbiturates and other sedative\nhypnotics, and amphetamines and other stimu-\nlants.We computed rates of substance abuse ad-\nmissions for each state and drug category by\ndividing the total number of admissions within\na state by that state's population.\nAlthough the Treatment Episode Data Set does\nnot contain all substance abuse admissions\nwithin a state, available inclusion rates suggest\nthat facilities in the data set account for nearly\n70 percent of total known admissions.8 Although\ncomparisons across states are limited by differ-\nences in the extent to which substance abuse\nadmissions are recorded in the data set, compar-\nisons within states over time are less subject to\nthis measurement error.\nIt is possible that changing treatment environ-\nments in substance abuse facilities over time may\nlead to spurious associations between state-level\ngrowth in Internet use and measured prescrip-\ntion drug abuse. For example, if over time treat-\nment facilities located in states with large growth\nin Internet use more frequently admitted pa-\ntients abusing prescription drugs because of bet-\nter insurance reimbursement or public funding\nfor prescription drug abuse, we would falsely\nattribute changes in substance abuse admissions\nfor prescription drugs to Internet growth.\nAlthough the inclusion of separate state-year\ntrends in our regression model would presum-\nably account for these unobserved factors,\nchanging treatment patterns that remain corre-\nlated with state-level Internet growth are\npossible.\nIn addition to our baseline measure of pre-\nscription drug abuse, we explored other options\nfor measuring prescription drug abuse at the\nstate level. The Drug Abuse Warning Network\ncollects data on emergency department visits\nfor a number of prescription drug classes but\ncontinually collected information for only\nAlthough a time-series of Internet use at the city\nlevel was not readily available to us, the cities for\nwhich we had data on emergency department\nvisits were also large metropolitan centers that\nprobably varied little in Internet growth.\nWe also explored the possibility of computing\nstate-level inpatient hospital admission rates for\nabuse of prescription drugs using the National\nInpatient Sample, an approximately 20 percent\nWeb First\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

This annual, cross-\nsectional survey gathers information on rates of\nsubstance abuse among the US noninstitution-\nalized population age twelve and older.15 We fo-\ncused on reported state-level estimates of nar-\ncotic painkiller and cocaine abuse as only\nthese drugs had annual data available for each\nment admission data were available).\nStatistical Analysis In our baseline model,\nwe estimated longitudinal linear regressions of\nthe association between high-speed Internet use\nand admissions to substance abuse treatment\nfacilities for each of several prescription drug\nabuse categories: nonheroin opioids (includ-\ning synthetics), benzodiazepines, sedative hyp-\nnotics, and stimulants (including amphet-\namine).\nFor each drug in question, the dependent var-\niable was the natural log of the substance abuse\nrate in state s in year t, and the key explanatory\nvariable was the natural log of high-speed Inter-\nnet lines per capita in state s in year t. In order to\naccount for unobserved fixed state characteris-\ntics and trends over time, we included both state-\nlevel fixed effects and state-specific year trends.\nTo validate our model, we also conducted sepa-\nrate \"falsification tests,\" in which we replaced\nthe dependent variable with treatment facility\nadmission rates for abuse of alcohol, heroin,\nand cocaine separately.\nBecause none of these substances are known\nto be readily purchasable online, the absence of\nany relationship between Internet use and abuse\nrates of these substances would further suggest\nthat any observed relationship between Internet\nuse and prescription drug abuse might be causal.\nTo account for changing demographics not cap-\ntured in state-year trends, all models included\ncontrols for the percentage of the population\nin each state and year that was male, and the\npercentage younger than age thirty.\nSensitivity Analyses As an additional sensi-\ntivity analysis to our baseline model, we ac-\ncounted for other factors that may be associated\nwith changes in prescription drug abuse rates\nover time. Because states with greater high-\nspeed Internet growth may also have experi-\nenced greater legal prescriptions for commonly\nabused substances, we accounted for the overall\nprescribing environment in a given state and\nyear by including as a covariate the number of\nprescriptions per Medicaid beneficiary of each\ndrug we considered.27 In addition to changes in\nlegal prescribing behavior, coincident increases\nin criminal enforcement for heroin and cocaine\nuse and trafficking may have occurred in states\nthat experienced high-speed Internet growth.We\ntherefore included a covariate of drug arrest\nrates (as a percentage of total arrests in a given\nstate and year) obtained from the National Con-\nsortium on Violence Research, which itself com-\nputed rates from Federal Bureau of Investigation\nUniform Crime Reports.28\nAsa final sensitivityanalysis, in additionto our\nbaseline model, which used state treatment fa-\ncility admission rates as a measure of substance\nabuse, we also estimated the association between\nself-reported state cocaine and narcotic pain-\nkiller abuse rates and high-speed Internet use.\nBecause ourdataspannedonly fouryears (2002\u00ad\n05), our longitudinal linear regression model\nused state fixed effects (rather than state-year\ntrends) and controlled for state Medicaid pre-\nscription rates for narcotic painkillers as well\nas state drug arrest rates.\nStudy Results\nExhibit 1 displays growth in per capita rates of\nhigh-speed Internet access and admissions to\nsubstance abuse treatment facilities in the\ntime, high-speed Internet access in the United\nStates increased from 1,816 residential lines per\nThere was significant variation in growth across\nstates, with the bottom five states (Massachu-\nsetts, Nebraska, New Hampshire, California,\nand Rhode Island) growing substantially more\nslowly during the seven-year period than the\ntop five states (Montana, Maryland, Indiana,\nKentucky, and Delaware)--734 percent versus\nstance abuse treatment facilities for prescription\ndrugs grew dramatically during this period.

For each substance-specific model, we\naccounted for state fixed effects and state-\nspecific trends.\nGrowth in Internet use across states was nei-\nther practically nor statistically significantly cor-\nrelated with growth in abuse of substances not\nreadily purchasable online: alcohol, cocaine, or\nheroin. Forexample,ourestimates suggest that a\n10 percent increase in Internet use was associ-\nated with only a 0.18 percent increase in treat-\nment facility admissions for cocaine abuse\n(p \u00bc 0:51). At the same time, growth in Internet\nuse across states was significantly correlated\nwith growth in three out of four substances\nknown to be readily purchasable online, namely\nprescription opioids, sedative hypnotics, and\nstimulants. Estimated associations were similar\nin magnitude: a given 10 percent increase in\nInternet use was associated with a roughly 1 per-\ncent increase in treatment facility admission\nrates for these three prescription drugs.\nWe explored how accounting for legal pre-\nscription rates of commonly abused prescription\ndrugs and drug arrests within a state affected the\nestimated association between state high-speed\nInternet use and admissions to treatment facili-\nties (Exhibit 4, left side). After we controlled for\nboth of these factors as well as state fixed effects\nand state-specific time trends, growth in Internet\nuse across states was still significantly correlated\nwith growth in prescription narcotics, sedative\nhypnotics, and stimulants. For each 10 percent\nincrease in Internet use, treatment facility ad-\nmission rates for these three drugs continued\nto rise by roughly 1 percent.\nWe found similar results when focusing on\nself-reported cocaine and prescription narcotic\nuse as opposed to treatment facility admission\nrates (Exhibit 4, right side). Accounting for state\nfixed effects, legal prescription rates of narcot-\nics, and drug arrests within a state, a 10 percent\nincrease in state high-speed Internet use was\nassociated with a 0.06 percent change in self-\ncent increase in prescription narcotic use\nDiscussion\nThegrowthin illegitimateonlinepharmacies has\nraised concerns about inappropriate access to\ncommonly abused prescription medications.

Our analysis of the potential link\nbetween online availability of commonly abused\nprescription drugs and actual abuse was moti-\nvated by the first-time treatment of a patient by\none of us (Jena) for tramadol (Ultram) toxicity\nfrom extensive and prolonged Internet purchas-\ning of this synthetic opioid medication.\nWe hypothesized that given the availability of\ncommonly abused prescription drugs on the In-\nternet, growth in overall Internet use might ex-\nplain some of the growth in prescription drug\nabuse in the United States. Using the facts that\nhigh-speed Internet growth has accounted for\nnearly all of the recent growth in Internet use\nand that nonprescription drugs should not have\nbeen affected by this growth, we demonstrated\nthat states with greater high-speed Internet\ngrowth had more growth in prescription drug\nabuse but no detectable change in abuse of drugs\nnot readily purchasable online.\nOur results were robust to adjustments for\nunobserved state-specific factors that trended\nlinearly over time, as well as observed factors\nsuch as legal prescription rates of commonly\nabused prescription drugs and drug arrest rates.\nOur results suggest that for every 10 percent in-\ncrease in state high-speed Internet use, associ-\nated admissions to substance abuse treatment\nfacilities for prescription drug abuse rose by\nroughly 1 percent.\nOur work is hypothesis generating: It raises\nthe possibility that the observed growth in US\nprescription drug abuse may partially stem from\nwider Internet availability through online phar-\nmacies that sell prescription drugs illegally.\nThere are, however, important limitations of\nour analysis.\nFirst, although we used falsification tests with\nsubstances not readily purchasable online, our\nresults ultimately reflect an association that\nmight more convincingly be causal if there were\nnatural experiments to exploit. For example, had\nthere been variations in state laws or law enforce-\nment policies to shut down illegitimate online\npharmacies (there are no specific state laws of\nwhich we are aware), one could explore whether\nstates with such laws experienced declines\nin prescription drug abuse. More generally,\nalthough we accounted for factors such as drug\narrests, legal prescription rates, and unobserved\nstate-specific factors that varied linearly over\ntime, unobserved state factors such as general\nattitudes toward prescription drug abuse may\nstill confound our association.\nSecond, using administrative data such as sub-\nstance abuse treatment facility admissions has\nits own limitations. Changes in how data are\ncollected over time may lead us to spurious asso-\nciations simply because specific abused sub-\nstances such as prescription drugs may have bet-\nter data recorded over time.\nThird, prescription drug abuse and access to\nthe Internet are hard to define. Increases in treat-\nment rates may not necessarily reflect increases\nin the prevalence of substance abuse, though we\ndo find such associations for the single case of\nself-reported prescription drugs that we con-\nsider, namely narcotics. Access to high-speed\nInternet use within a state may be a poor proxy\nfor access to illegal online pharmacies, yet nearly\nall of the recent growth in Internet use has been\ndriven by expansion of high-speed Internet ser-\nvices and access to such sites by definition re-\nquires access to Internet.\nDespite these important limitations, our re-\nsults suggest that better surveillance is war-\nranted to understand the extent to which pre-\nscription drug abuse occurs due to drugs\npurchased online, either by individuals or by\norganized dealers who then distribute drugs lo-\ncally. Our findings provide a first glimpse that\ngrowing Internet use may partly explain why US\nprescription drug abuse rates have risen\ndramatically while other substance abuse rates\nhave not.\nBased on our findings, recent efforts by the\nFood and Drug Administration to shut down ille-\ngitimate pharmacies not only seem warranted\nbut may also lead to substantial reductions in\nprescription drug abuse. The success of these\nefforts will, of course, depend not only on the\nability of the Food and Drug Administration to\nserially monitor the emergence of new, rogue\nInternet pharmacies but also on the agency's\nability to promptly shut down pharmacies by\ncoordinating with Internet service providers.\nHowever, these efforts are complicated by the\nemergence of international sites that ship\nmedications to the United States, creating com-\nplicating jurisdictional and regulatory over-\nsight. \nWeb First\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.
