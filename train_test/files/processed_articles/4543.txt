CMT1 has autosomal dominant\ninheritance and slow nerve conduction velocity, suggesting\na myelin dysfunction; CMT2 has autosomal dominant inher-\nitance and normal nerve conduction velocity, suggesting an\naxonal dysfunction; CMT4 is recessive and demyelinating;\nand CMT2-AR is recessive and axonal. Most patients with\nCMTX (X-linked CMT) have an intermediate nerve conduction\nvelocity.\nAt least 45 causing genes have already been identified and\nseveral others are still coming (Murphy et al., 2012; Patzko\nand Shy, 2012). The most frequent mutation worldwide is\npatients. The second most frequently mutated gene is the\nGJB1, which is implicated in the CMTX1 group of patients\nwith an intermediate nerve conduction velocity and who oc-\ncasionally develop abnormalities in the CNS (central nervous\nJ.

Figure 1 depicts the selection process used to identify\nstudies.\nRESULTS\nUsing the search terms and inclusion and exclusion criteria,\n20 studies were selected, and their relevance was assessed by\na psychiatrist and a clinic psychologist.\nStudy designs\nOnly one study was qualitative descriptive (Arnold et al.,\n2005). Among the quantitative studies, two referred to them-\nselves as descriptive (Gemignani et al., 1999; Padua et al.,\n2008a), while the remaining studies employed comparisons\namong groups (Rubinsztein et al., 1998; Dematteis et al.,\nConsidering the specific aims of the evaluated studies,\nit was possible to divide them into two groups, as fol-\nlows: (a) studies investigating the comorbidity of psychi-\natric disorders in patients with CMT (Rubinsztein et al., 1998;\nand (b) studies evaluating the impact of the CMT symptoms\non the quality of life (Teunissen et al., 2003; Arnold et al.,\nclinical presentation.\nThe most of the studies were conducted in Europe, es-\npecially in Italy (N = 7) (Gemignani et al., 1999; Vinci et al.,\n2009), suggesting a lack of studies in the Americas and East-\nern countries. The distinguished cultures can distinctly con-\ntribute to the assessment of the quality of life.\nSample characteristics\nTen studies evaluated the different forms of CMT (CMT1,\nCMT2, CMTX, and other forms of CMT) (Gemignani et al.,\nies exclusively analyzed patients with CMT1 (Rubinsztein\nsingle study analyzed only CMT2 (Teunissen et al., 2003).\nThe diagnoses were performed using a combination of\nclinical manifestations, electromyography, and a genetic\nexam in 85% of the studies.\nRegarding nonclinical groups, utilized comparison groups,\nnine studies employed the general population (Dematteis\nand five studies used normative data (Vinci et al., 2005; Padua\nwith clinical studies examining other neurological disorders,\nsuch as NH (nonhereditary neuropathies), rLTNCs (rare long-\nterm neurologic conditions), MD (myotonic dystrophy), FSHD\n(facioscapulohumeral dystrophy), insomnia, and post-stroke\npatients.\nData are detailed in Table 1.\nAssessment tools\nThe instruments applied to evaluate the clinical variables in\nthe examined studies are schematically presented in Table 2.\nMost of the studies used the gold standard instrument\nfor quality of life evaluation, the SF-36 scale (Vinci et al.,\nboth the PS (physical score) and the MS (mental score). Briefly,\nwhile low PSs indicate severe physical dysfunctions, distress-\ning body pain, fatigue, and an unfavorable progression, low\nMSs indicate frequent emotional suffering and severe social\ninteraction deficits. Higher scores represent a better quality\nof life. The remaining studies employed qualitative interviews\nand EQ-5D (Calvert et al., 2012) scales.

The instruments used by the other studies were based\non self-rating scales that only estimated signals and symp-\ntoms, which are not adequate for the diagnosis of mental\ndisorders. This is an important limitation of these studies.\nCMT and quality of life impairment\nThe primary results related to quality of life in patients with\nCMT are presented in the Table 3.\nMost studies (N = 8) (Teunissen et al., 2003;Vinci et al.,\nC 2014 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nJ. L. C. Cordeiro and others\nquality of life in patients with CMT compared with healthy\ncontrol groups, although CMT does not appear to alter the\nlife span.\nMost studies have reported that decreased quality of life\nfatigue (Boenterd et al., 2010). That is, the weakened physical\ncondition of CMT patients appears to be the primary factor\nthat contributes to the observed decrease in the quality of\nlife. Additionally, it was expected that the progression of the\ndisease would also decrease the quality of life.\nHowever, the results were controversial. Three studies (Te-\nany decrement in the quality of life related to aging or the\nduration of the disease. However, two studies (Vinci et al.,\npatients with healthy controls using the SF-36 scale revealed\na significant difference associated with age, with quality of\nlife assessments reaching higher rates in elderly patients with\nCMT. This discrepancy could be due to the subjective evalua-\ntion of the quality of life, according to Shy and Rose (2005)\nwhich is dynamic and can vary during the disease time course.\nAdditionally, the slow progression of CMT allows patients\nwith CMT to find ways to adapt and reduce the impact of the\ndisease on their quality of life.\nStudies that employed the SF-36 scale to evaluate pa-\ntients suffering from other chronic diseases, such as dia-\nrheumatoid arthritis, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease), angina, asthma, and epilepsy (Stavem et al., 2000)\nhave shown a decrement in the quality of life compared with\nhealthy subjects. This result is in line with the studies exam-\nining CMT patients, suggesting that the observed impairment\nin the quality of life is not disease-specific but may be related\nto chronic diseases. These studies did not evaluate the associ-\nation between the quality of life indicators and the duration\nof the disease.\nCMT and depressive disorders\nThere were no consensus results regarding depression in CMT\npatients compared with control groups (see Table 3). Three\nstudies compared the prevalence of depressive disorders in\npatients with CMT to that of healthy controls. Two studies\nsignificant differences between CMT patients and the con-\ntrol groups. One study (Phillips et al., 2009) found a greater\ndiagnostic of depression in patients with CMT. The other two\nany significant differences between CMT patients and the\ncontrol groups. Importantly, each study used distinct instru-\nments to evaluate of the signals and symptoms of depression.\nDespite the small number of studies (Rubinsztein et al.,\n2009), patients with CMT appear to display similar indicators\nof depressive disorders as are observed in other neurologi-\ncal diseases, such as FSHD (Kalkman et al., 2007) and stroke\n(Pfeiffer et al., 2001). When comparing patients with MD and\nCMT, the results have been contradictory. While one study\n(Kalkman et al., 2007) reported the same rates of depression\nin patients affected by these diseases, two studies (Rubin-\nprevalence of depression in patients with MD. In all three of\nthese studies, patients with MD or CMT presented higher rates\nof depressive symptoms than the healthy control groups. The\ndiversity in the sample sizes of patients with MD and CMT,\nas well as in the methodological issues (self-rating scales \u00ad\nstandard instruments \u00ad Kalkman et al., 2007), should be em-\nphasized.\nThe deficiencies or flaws in the instruments of evaluation\nand the lack of standardization across studies that examine\nthe relationship between depression and CMT can critically\ninfluence these data. The employment of instruments that\ntrack signals and symptoms instead of standard interviews\ncan mask the true prevalence of depressive disorders. Thus,\nthese limitations did not allow for the formation of a solid\nconclusion.\nPrevious studies have described the comorbidity between\ndepression and neurological diseases (van der Werf et al.,\npatients with diseases such as Parkinson's, migraine, epilepsy,\nand multiple sclerosis, depression was reported in 40% of the\nsample (Carson et al., 2003). Moreover, a strong association\nbetween depression and worsened indicators of health, in-\ncluding physical, social, and work components, was reported.\nOur data regarding the association between depression\nand CMT are in line with the literature. Nevertheless, it is not\nyet possible to define the role of the depressive symptoms. If\nsecondary, these symptoms would be related to the disease. If\nprimary, they would be etiological. These studies suggest that\npatients with CMT are a group at increased risk for depressive\nsymptoms, which can be linked both to the disease and to\nthe specific conditions that result from this disease, and thus,\nCMT patients constitute targets for further research.\nCMT and anxiety disorders\nAs observed in Table 3, the results were discrepant when anx-\niety symptoms were evaluated in patients with CMT and MD\nor in healthy controls. In patients with CMT, generalized anx-\niety, phobias, posttraumatic stress disorder, and panic were\nfound. However, only a single study (Kalkman et al., 2007)\nemployed the gold standard interview for DSM-IV, while the\nsymptom self-tracking, which may not correspond to psychi-\natric diagnoses. Then the divergence in data may result from\nthe differences in the sample sizes and/or methodologies\n190 C 2014 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nCMT: psychiatric indicators and quality of life\n(self-rating scales versus structured interview) among stud-\nies. No study addressing anxiety and other neuromuscular\ndiseases was found.\nCMT and sleep disorders\nAmong sleep disorders, OSAS (obstructive sleep apnoea syn-\ntert et al., 2014), RLS (restless legs syndrome) (Gemignani\n2010) found sleep disturbances in CMT patients compared\nwith healthy controls, irrespective of the type of disturbance\nor the instrument used for evaluation. In two studies (De-\nwas found to be higher in patients with CMT compared with\nhealthy controls. Both studies described a positive correlation\nbetween the OSAS severity and neurological impairments in\npatients with CMT. A higher prevalence of RLS in patients with\nCMT2 compared with patients with CMT1 was reported in\nthough the prevalence of RLS in CMT patients was higher\nin all of the studies (Gemignani et al. 1999; Hattan et al.,\nOf note, one study (Boenterd et al., 2010) has reported, using\nmultiple analyses of regression, that CMT is a statically sig-\nnificant predictor of reduced sleep quality, regardless of age\nor gender.\nThen, CMT appears to predispose patients to sleep dis-\nturbances. In particular, CMT1 patients are predisposed to\nOSAS development. From a clinical perspective, it appears\ncritical to investigate OSAS in patients with CMT1. Although\nthe association between RLS and peripheral neuropathy is\nnot fully elucidated, a significant association between CMT\nand RLS was observed in the present study, suggesting that\npatients with RLS should be investigated for peripheral neu-\nropathy and vice versa, as RLS may be a treatable manifes-\ntation of neuropathy (Rutkove et al., 1995). Thus, patients\nwith CMT can benefit from sleep disorder investigations and\ntreatments, if applicable.\nCONCLUSION\nPatients with CMT present a higher risk of developing psy-\nchiatric disorders, especially depression. Additionally, these\npatients appear to be more susceptible to alterations in\nthe quality of life, which can be dramatically influenced by\nphysical limitations. There is a remarkable correlation be-\ntween sleep disorders and CMT. These data suggest the im-\nportance of the systematic evaluation of these conditions to\nreduce the CMT-induced impairments, as well as the quality\nof life decrement.\nHowever, our results should be interpreted with caution\nbecause the statistical analysis (meta-analysis) could not be\nperformed due to the diversity of instruments employed to\nassess the distinct outcome variables. Thus, future studies\nmust demonstrate homogeneous methodologies to statisti-\ncally confirm the clinical evidence. The importance of studies\nthat separate the patients with various CMT subtypes and\nthose that use structured interviews to accurately estimate\nthe association between CMT and psychiatric disorders should\nalso be highlighted.\nJoana Cordeiro did acquisition of data.
