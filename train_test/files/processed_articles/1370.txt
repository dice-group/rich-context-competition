A cohort of 3402 white and black subjects 45 through 74 years of age\ntotal of 416 new stroke cases.\nResults--Results were evaluated to determine the relative risk (RR) for stroke per 1-SD decrease in BMD, after controlling\nfor age at baseline, smoking status, alcohol consumption, history of diabetes, history of heart disease, education, body\nmass index, recreational physical activity, and blood pressure medication.

A\nrelationship between BMD and stroke was observed in a\ncase-control study in which female but not male stroke\npatients had lower BMD than population control subjects.3 A\nlarge, cross-sectional analysis of stroke prevalence and BMD\nusing data from the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES) found no significant asso-\nciation of BMD and stroke in men.4 There was some\nindication of elevated prevalence in women with BMD\n0.936 g/cm2, but no dose-response relationship was found.\nTo further investigate the relationship between BMD and\nstroke incidence, we used data from the NHANES I Epide-\nmiological Follow-up Study (NHEFS) to assess the associa-\ntion of phalangeal BMD with 20-year stroke incidence and\nmortality.\nSubjects and Methods\nThe NHEFS is a longitudinal study of participants in NHANES I\n1975.5 The personal interviews and physical and laboratory exami-\nnations of NHANES I provided the BMD and other baseline data for\nthe NHEFS. The ascertainment of subsequent stroke occurrence in\nthis analysis was based on 4 waves of follow-up data collection\nof 4 interview surveys, healthcare facility medical records for the\nperiod between baseline and last follow-up, and death certificates for\nall decedents.\nThis analysis was restricted to white and black persons 45 to 74\nyears of age at baseline in NHANES I. Of the 4107 subjects in this\ngroup who had been randomly selected from the general sample to\nreceive detailed examination, including a single bone density mea-\nsurement, 112 (total, 2.7%) were lost to follow-up (no subject or\nproxy interview at any follow-up wave) or had no death certificate.\nExcluded from all analyses were 99 subjects (2.4%) who had a\nhistory of stroke at baseline and 494 subjects (12.0%) with unknown\nbaseline history of heart disease, diabetes history, weight, height,\nsmoking status, alcohol consumption, blood pressure medication,\nrecreational physical activity, or educational attainment, leaving\n3402 for analysis.

The date of inci-\ndence was estimated as 1 of the following: date of first hospital\nadmission with a stroke diagnosis or date of death for persons dying\nFrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, Md.\nCorrespondence to R.F.

A total of 416 new\nstroke cases were identified.\nPhalangeal BMD was determined from a baseline x-ray of the left\nhand by use of radiographic absorptiometry and reported in arbitrary\nunits (AU). The radiographic absorptiometry process uses direct\nexposure (nonscreen) radiographs of the participant's left hand\nalongside an aluminum alloy reference wedge, which are digitized\nby a high-resolution camera for computer analysis.6,7 Radiographic\nabsorptiometry has been found to have excellent precision and\naccuracy (precision error, 1%; accuracy error, 4.8%)5 and to corre-\nlate well with other accepted methods of bone densitometry.8\nBaseline age, smoking status, alcohol consumption, blood pres-\nsure medication use, educational attainment, and physical activity\nlevel were obtained by interview, and body mass index was calcu-\nlated from measured height and weight. History of heart attack and\ndiabetes was based on self-reported doctor's diagnoses. Estimates of\nthe risk of stroke for persons according to BMD derive from Cox\nproportional-hazards regression models computed with the PHREG\nprocedure.9 Proportional-hazards assumptions were tested by meth-\nods using plots and time-dependent covariates.9 Separate analyses\nwere carried out for white men, white women, and blacks. Small\nsample sizes did not permit sex-specific models for blacks. BMD\nwas treated as a continuous variable, and estimates of risk of stroke\nwere calculated for people with values of 1 SD below the mean\ncompared with the mean. To assess the effect of complex survey\ndesign on the results, Cox proportional-hazards regression analyses\nwere confirmed by use of the survival procedure in SUDAAN to\nincorporate the stratification, clustering, and sample weights.10\nResults\nNo statistically significant differences in age-adjusted mean\nBMD at baseline with versus without stroke were found for\nby race and sex is shown in the Table. In stroke-free\nsurvivors, the length of follow-up averaged 18.7 years. In\nCox proportional-hazards analyses, the incidence of stroke\nwas not associated with a 1-SD decrease in BMD in any of\nthe 3 race-sex groups (Table). No significant associations\nwere found among white men (P0.88), white women\nwhen the SAS-callable SUDAAN survival procedure was\nused to check for changes in stroke relative risk (RR) after\nusing sampling weights. To exclude nonlinear associations,\nRR was estimated in a model with dummy variables for BMD\ntertiles for white women. With the first tertile serving as the\nreference group, the RR of stroke in the highest tertile was\nIn an analysis of BMD and stroke mortality (any mention on\ndeath certificate, n169), the 3 race-sex groups were com-\nbined (controlling for sex and race in addition to other\nvariables) because of the small number of deaths from stroke.\nNo association between BMD and stroke mortality was found\nDiscussion\nThis article reports one of the few longitudinal studies of BMD\nand incidence of stroke and is the first to use a biracial cohort of\nwomen and men. No association of phalangeal BMD was found\nwith the subsequent development of stroke. Controlling for\nbaseline age and other potential confounding factors failed to\nalter this finding. (Unfortunately, BMD at proximal sites was not\nmeasured.) This is consistent with the fact that no satisfactory\ncausal mechanism for the previously reported association of\nBMD and stroke incidence or death has been discovered.1\u00ad4 Low\nBMD may serve as a marker of other causes of stroke in some\nsamples. For example, the possibility that both osteopenia and\nstroke may result from low relative lifetime exposure to estrogen\nin women or low vitamin D and its metabolites, which might\naffect vascular reactivity, has been raised.3,4 Osteoprotegerin, a\ncytokine that regulates osteoclastogenesis, was not found to be\nrelated to BMD or incidence of stroke in white women despite\nassociations with hypertension and diabetes.11 A diet high in\nprotein (acids) and salt but low in potassium might aggravate\nosteoporosis and increase risk of stroke.3,12 Essential hyperten-\nsion may be associated with increased mobilization of calcium\nfrom bone.12 Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats have\nlower femoral BMD than Wistar-Kyoto control rats.13,14 How-\never, treatment with antihypertensive agents prevented stroke\nbut not decreased BMD.13 Thus, further in vitro and in vivo\nresearch is needed to determine whether a biological mechanism\nexists for an association of BMD with stroke incidence reported\nby others. It is important to exclude a causal association of BMD\nwith stroke because, in clinical practice, finding low BMD in a\nwoman may result in prescribing estrogen-replacement therapy,\nwhich itself may increase the risk of stroke.15\nIn summary, in a large national study, no significant\nassociations of BMD and stroke incidence or mortality were\nfound for whites or blacks.\nReferences\n1.
