For female adolescents, sexually active relation-\nships with partners they had not known before the\nromantic relationship began were less likely to include\ndiscussions of sexually transmitted infections or contra-\nception, and were less likely to include consistent use of\nbirth control (odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals,\nromantic social ties did not play a statistically signifi-\ncant role for these outcomes among male adolescents\n(odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of friends and\nConclusion: The existence and nature of an adoles-\ncent's prior relationship with a future romantic partner\nhave significant implications for an adolescent couple's\nlater sexual decisions, but patterns differ for male and\nfemale adolescents.\nadulthood represent a time\nof high risk for unin-\ntended pregnancies and\nsexually transmitted infec-\ncies among teenagers are unintended,\nand an estimated 1 in 10 young women\nunintended pregnancy.4 Consistent con-\ntraception use is fundamental to prevent-\ning unintended pregnancies among sexu-\nally active young people. For example,\nabout half of adolescents and young\nadults aborting a pregnancy report that\nthey were using a contraceptive method\nduring the month of conception, but 76%\nof all birth control pill users and 49% of\ncondom users aborting a pregnancy\nreported inconsistent method use as lead-\ning to the pregnancy.5\nIndividual factors that have been asso-\nciated with contraception use include sex,\nrace and ethnicity, family structure, paren-\ntal education, and school grades.6-8 How-\never, couple structure and dynamics pro-\nvide a social context for all reproductive\nnegotiationsandbehaviorofthecouple.Be-\ncause adolescents generally lack substan-\ntial experience in romantic relationships,9\nthey may be unsure of how to initiate and\nconduct discussions about contraception\nwith romantic partners.

The existing\nliterature has focused on contraceptive use within rela-\ntionships that were already sexual, rather than on ro-\nmantic relationships that may or may not involve inter-\ncourse. At first sexual intercourse, female adolescents who\nhave just met their sexual partner are less likely to use\ncontraception than those who have first sex in the con-\ntext of an existing romantic relationship, such as going\nsteady.6 In addition, adolescents are more likely to ever\nuse a condom with a partner from the same school than\nwith one from a different school.7 Although adolescent\nmales and females report different contraceptive use pat-\nterns and different attitudes toward sexuality and ro-\nmance,8,10-12 the possibility that the associations be-\ntween relationship characteristics and contraceptive\nbehavior vary by sex is largely unexplored.\nThisstudyexaminedtheassociationbetweenpreexist-\ning social ties between adolescent romantic partners and\nthecouple'ssexualbehavior.Preexistingsocialtiesinclude\nknowing the partner through being friends, schoolmates,\nor neighbors or attending the same church before a rela-\ntionshipwasconsidered\"romantic\"bytheadolescent.Spe-\ncifically,weexaminedthefollowingresearchquestions:Do\npreexistingsocialtiesaffectthelikelihoodofanadolescent\nromanticrelationshipresultinginintercourse?And,among\nrelationships that include intercourse, do preexisting so-\ncialtiesaffectthelikelihoodof(1)discussionofSTIsorcon-\ntraception and (2) using birth control consistently?\nMETHODS\ncents who reported having an opposite-sex romantic partner\nin Wave II of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nHealth (Add Health).

About 28% of respon-\ndents in our sample reported more than 1 partner. To standardize\nanalyses across respondents, minimize recall bias, and reflect\nthe most current experiences, we identified the most recent op-\nposite-sex relationship from the list based on the start date of\nthe relationship for our analyses.\nMEASURES\nDependent Variables\nRespondents were asked to examine cards that described things\nthat might have happened in their romantic relationship. They\nwere then asked to reject those cards that described things that\nhad not happened and keep those cards that described things\nthat had happened. We constructed dichotomous variables for\nwhether the couple had intercourse and whether the couple\ntalked about contraception or STIs, based on whether respon-\ndents kept the cards for \"We talked about contraception or sexu-\nally transmitted diseases\" and \"We had sexual intercourse.\" Re-\nspondents who indicated that they had sex with their partner\nwere also asked if they or their partner used some method of\nbirth control every time they had sexual intercourse.\nIndependent Variables\nRespondents were asked in what ways they knew their partner\nbefore the romantic relationship began. Answers were used to\nconstruct a 3-category measure of preromantic social ties: (1)\nfriends before the romance began, (2) acquaintances who knew\neach other (through school, church, the neighborhood, or other\nways) but were not friends, or (3) persons who had never met\nbefore the romance began (the relationship became romantic\nright away).\nControl Variables\nVarious characteristics of individuals may influence how they\nchoose a partner (eg, whether they are attracted romantically\nto friends or strangers) and their risk behaviors. We included\nseveral potential confounders that are often tied to sexual\nbehavior in the literature, including the respondent's sex (fe-\nmale or male), age (as a continuous variable), race (white,\nblack, or other), parental education (did any parent go\nbeyond high school), and family structure (2 biological par-\nents; 2 parents, not both biological; mother only; father only;\nor other). We also controlled for the duration of the relation-\nship (in months) because evidence indicates that adolescents\nin relationships of a longer duration are more likely to ever\nuse contraceptives with that partner but less likely to always\nANALYSES\nMultinomial logistic regression was used to obtain adjusted es-\ntimates of the odds of having sexual intercourse with the most\nrecent partner and of talking about contraception or STIs, and\nusing birth control consistently. Male and female adolescents\nwere modeled separately. The models for intercourse used data\nfrom all the respondents with opposite-sex romantic partners\nin our study sample. Models of the other outcomes were re-\nstricted to respondents who reported having intercourse in that\nrelationship. The duration of the relationship and the respon-\ndent's age, sex, race, parental education, and family structure\nwere included as control variables. Statistical software (Stata)\nwas used to incorporate weights and adjust for Add Health's\nRESULTS\nDemographic and Control Variables\nOf the 6658 respondents with a romantic partner at Wave\nII, most were white, had parents with more than a high\nschool education, and lived with 2 biological parents\n(Table 1).\n\u00a92005 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nIndependent Social Ties Variables\nMost respondents with romantic partners reported hav-\ning met the partner before the romance began, and more\nthan a third considered the partner a friend before the\nromantic involvement (Table 1).\nOutcomes\nAt Wave II, just less than half of the sample reported hav-\ning intercourse with their most recent partner (Table 1).\nOf these persons, most reported that they had talked about\ncontraception or STIs with their partner and that they\nalways used birth control. Although more female ado-\nlescents reported that they talked about STIs or contra-\nception with their partners, more male adolescents re-\nported actually using birth control every time (Table 1).\nBy using acquaintances (the largest group) as the refer-\nent group, we next examined the association between so-\ncial ties and the various sexual outcomes using logistic\nregression models.\nIntercourse\nBeing friends before the romantic relationship began was\nassociated with a lower likelihood of intercourse com-\npared with being acquaintances for male and female ado-\nlescents (Table 2). Not knowing the partner before the\nromance did not differ significantly from just being ac-\nquaintances. The odds of intercourse increased with re-\nlationship duration, respondent's age, and family struc-\ntures that are not 2 biological parents. The odds of\nintercourse decreased with higher parental education. The\nodds of intercourse were also higher for black male ado-\nlescents compared with white male adolescents.\nTalking About STIs or Contraception\nThe odds of talking about STIs or contraception were\nsubstantially lower for female adolescents who did not\nknow their partner before their romantic involvement\ncompared with female adolescents with partners who\nwere acquaintances. However, being friends did not\nincrease the odds of talking about these issues com-\npared with just being acquaintances (Table 2). For male\nadolescents, the odds of discussing these issues did not\ndiffer significantly between groups. Older age and\nhigher parental education levels were associated with\ndiscussing STIs or contraception among female adoles-\ncents, and longer duration of the relationship was asso-\nciated with greater odds of discussing these issues for\nmale and female adolescents.\nAlways Using Birth Control\nAs with the previous outcome, the odds of always using\nbirth control with a partner are lower for female adoles-\ncents who did not know their partner before their\nromantic involvement, while for male adolescents the\nodds of always using birth control did not differ signifi-\ncantly across groups (Table 2). Although black adoles-\ncents did not differ significantly from white adolescents\non always using birth control, adolescents of other race\nhad lower odds of always using birth control compared\nwith white adolescents. Among female adolescents,\nhigher parental education was associated with always\nusing birth control.\nCOMMENT\nThe results of this study indicate that the nature of the\nbeginning of an adolescent's relationship with a future\nromantic partner has significant implications for an\nadolescent couple's later sexual decisions. Knowing\none's partner as a friend before beginning a romantic\nrelationship was protective against engaging in sexual\nintercourse with that partner for male and female ado-\nlescents. However, for some outcomes, the patterns of\nthis association are different for male and female adoles-\ncents, suggesting qualitative differences in the way male\nand female adolescents approach sexual decision mak-\ning and negotiations in romantic relationships. For\nfemale adolescents, romantic relationships with part-\nners they had not met before were less likely to include\ndiscussions of STIs or contraception, and controlling\nfor relationship duration, were less likely to include\nalways using birth control. Preromantic social ties did\nTable 1.

A male ado-\nlescent who is thinking of a relationship in more sexu-\nalized terms may be more inclined to address such prac-\ntical concerns.\nSex roles of normative behavior for male and female\nadolescents still differ in important ways that may influ-\nence sexual negotiations. Female adolescents are judged\nmore harshly in regard to their sexual activities than\nmale adolescents, are more likely to feel ambivalence\nabout their sexuality, and are more concerned about\nhow their sexual activity will be labeled by others.16\nFemale adolescent sexual behavior also tends to be\nmore influenced by social control processes than that of\nmale adolescents,17 so these sex roles may influence\ntheir behavior more. Female adolescents may avoid\nplanning ahead for consistent contraception use\nbecause this might imply that they intend or want to\nhave sex, an attitude they might associate with mascu-\nline sex roles. Our findings that female adolescents are\nmore likely to talk to partners about STIs and contra-\nceptives if they were friends or acquaintances before\nbecoming romantic partners suggest that a preexisting\nsocial relationship may change the couple's negotiation\nprocess by emboldening female adolescents, thereby\nfacilitating communication and perhaps increased\nfemale control. Alternatively, the type of male partner\nmay differ in these various relationship situations. In\nrelationships that become romantic right away, male\nadolescents may be more aggressive in demanding sex\nor refusing to use contraception. The expectations of\nboth partners may differ depending on the type of rela-\ntionship.\nThe findings of this study should be interpreted with\ncaution. It is possible that adolescents who are more prone\nto high-risk behavior seek out relationships with part-\nners whom they do not already know. Furthermore, while\nwe can determine if they were acquaintances or friends\nfirst with their most recent romantic partners, we can-\nnot determine how long adolescents knew each other be-\nfore the romantic relationship began. Add Health al-\nlowed respondents to interpret what qualified as a\nromantic relationship. Although this has the benefit of\nenabling respondents to classify their relationships based\non their feelings and personal experiences instead of on\nimposed checklists or terms such as dating, it is pos-\nsible that groups of adolescents interpreted the term dif-\nferently.\nAdditional quantitative and qualitative research is\nneeded to better understand how friendship experi-\nences and previous social ties between partners may in-\nfluence couples' interaction processes. For example, do\nfemale adolescents feel more comfortable talking or as-\nserting themselves with male adolescents with whom they\nare already familiar? Are they more reluctant to inter-\nTable 2.

For example, training adolescents to im-\nprove practical communication skills and to challenge\naspects of traditional romantic scripts that discourage ac-\ntive roles for both partners in contraceptive decisions may\ncontribute to safer sexual decisions regardless of the pre-\nromantic history of partners.\nCorrespondence: Carolyn Tucker Halpern, PhD, De-\npartment of Maternal and Child Health, The University\nof North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Campus Box 7445,\n.edu).\nFunding/Support: This study uses data from Add Health,\nthe National Institute of Child Health and Human De-\nvelopment, Bethesda, Md, with cooperative funding from\nRole of the Sponsor: The funding bodies had no role in\ndata extraction and analyses, in the writing of the manu-\nscript, or in the decision to submit the manuscript for\npublication.\n"
