While the employment of expellees increased monotonically after the inflow,\nthe employment of native workers decreased in the first few years after the inflow. Furthermore,\nmany workers migrated within West Germany to the region with few expellees. The paper also\nshows that despite the large and long-lasting adjustment dynamics following the expellee inflow,\nnative workers experienced only a modest loss in their lifetime income of about 1.38%. Per-period\nlosses in native income, however, were considerably larger, especially for those native workers\nwho were not employed at the time of the inflow.\nThe analysis suggests that economic policy that affects the nature of the immigration inflow,\nfor example by spreading it over time, can reduce native income losses and dampen labor market\ndynamics.

Das liegt unter anderem an stark steigender inter-\nnationaler Migration, am wachsenden Zustrom von Fl\u00a8\nuchtlingen nach Europa, und an der weit\nverbreiteten Angst vor negativen Auswirkungen auf L\u00a8\nohne und Besch\u00a8\naftigung. Vor diesem Hin-\ntergrund analysiert das Papier, wie regionale Arbeitsm\u00a8\narkte in Westdeutschland die Massen-\nimmigration von acht Millionen Vertriebenendeutschen nach dem 2. Weltkrieg aufgenommen\nhaben. Die Vertriebenendeutschen waren zun\u00a8\nachst sehr ungleich \u00a8\nuber Westdeutschland verteilt.\nDas Papier nutzt diese historische Besonderheit sowie die ungew\u00a8\nohnlich lange Zeitdimension der\nvorliegenden Daten aus, um zwei Forschungsfragen zu untersuchen. Erstens, wie schnell und\ndurch welche Mechanismen haben sich regionale Arbeitsm\u00a8\narkte in Westdeutschland angepasst?\nZweitens, wie hat sich der Zustrom im Zeitablauf auf das Arbeitseinkommen der einheimischen\nErwerbsbev\u00a8\nolkerung ausgewirkt?\nBeitrag\nTrotz des gestiegenen Interesses an den Arbeitsmarkteffekten von Zuwanderung sind zwei\nwichtige Aspekte von Zuwanderung bisher noch nicht hinreichend verstanden. Zum einen wissen\nwir wenig dar\u00a8\nuber, wie lange es dauert, bis sich der Arbeitsmarkt vollst\u00a8\nandig an Zuwanderung\nanpasst. Zum anderen wissen wir nicht, durch welche Mechanismen die Anpassung geschieht.\nDas vorliegende Papier untersucht beide Aspekte.\nErgebnisse\nDas Papier zeigt, dass es ca. ein Jahrzehnt gedauert hat, bis der Arbeitsmarkt nach dem\nZustrom der Vertriebenendeutschen wieder einen Normalzustand erreicht hatte. W\u00a8\nahrend die\nBesch\u00a8\naftigung der Vertriebenendeutschen damals kontinuierlich anstieg, fiel die Besch\u00a8\naftigung\nder Einheimischen in den ersten Jahren nach dem Zustrom. Zudem gab es eine ausgepr\u00a8\nagte\nWanderungsbewegung innerhalb Westdeutschlands aus den sogenannten \"Fl\u00a8\nuchtlingsl\u00a8\nandern\"\nin die restlichen Bundesl\u00a8\nander. Obwohl diese Anpassungsdynamiken sehr ausgepr\u00a8\nagt und lang-\nwierig waren, fiel das Lebensarbeitseinkommen der einheimischen Erwerbsbev\u00a8\nolkerung nur\nrelativ moderat um 1.38%.

The share of expellees in the population ranged from 3.1% in the federal\nstate of Rhineland-Palatinate to 33.3% in Schleswig-Holstein. We exploit this large, unexpected,\nand highly uneven inflow of expellees to take up two key research questions. First, how quickly\nand by what margins did regional labor markets adjust to the expellee inflow? Second, how did\nthe inflow affect the native population's labor income along the adjustment path?\nOur paper contributes to an extensive literature in labor economics that analyzes labor mar-\nket adjustments to immigration.1 Over the past two decades, interest in the issue has been\nfueled by sharply rising numbers of international migrants and public concern about the conse-\nquences of immigration. The recent surge in forced migration and the growing inflow of refugees\ninto Europe have only added to these concerns. Despite strong public interest, the burgeoning\nliterature on immigration has not yet addressed two major aspects of the adjustment process\n(Borjas 2014): the length of the adjustment process and the relative importance of different\nadjustment margins along the adjustment process.2 Our paper addresses these two aspects.\nWe start our analysis by presenting novel empirical facts on how regional labor markets\nin West Germany adjusted to the inflow of expellees, drawing on more than two decades of\nhistorical data. We derive these facts by contrasting the economic development of two stylized\nregions: a high-inflow region H that consists of what were known as the \"refugee states\" of\nBavaria, Lower Saxony, and Schleswig-Holstein, and a low-inflow region L that consists of the\nremaining West German states. The two regions had similar unemployment and population\ngrowth rates before World War II. However, during and after World War II, much more expellees\nfled to region H than to region L, because region H is located much closer to the homelands\nBorjas (2014) provide comprehensive reviews, meta-analyses, and critiques of the existing literature.\n2In fact, the existing literature focuses mainly on changes in wages as the key margin through which labor\nmarkets adjust to immigration (see, e.g., Aydemir and Borjas (2011), Manacorda, Manning, and Wadsworth (2012)\nor Dustmann, Frattini, and Preston (2013)). Moreover, the literature typically analyzes the labor market effects\nof immigration in a static framework (see, e.g., Card (2001), Boustan, Fishback, and Kantor (2010) or Braun and\nMahmoud (2014)). In contrast, remarkably little is known about the labor market effects of immigration along\nthe adjustment path and about the time that it takes the labor market to digest an immigration-induced labor\nsupply shock.\nof expellees than region L. We compare economic developments in the two regions before the\ninflow and document their subsequent relative development until 1970, two decades after the\nexpellee inflow was complete. We argue that this comparison is informative about the effect of\nthe expellee inflow because regional differences in inflow rates were very large and exogenous to\nlocal labor market conditions.\nOur empirical facts reveal that by 1950, the unemployment rate in region H was as high as\n16.7% and exceeded the unemployment rate in region L by a factor of two and a half. Regional\nunemployment rates then gradually converged during the 1950s and eventually fell to around 1%\nby the early 1960s. The decrease and convergence in regional unemployment was accompanied\nby large regional migration flows. In 1950 alone, net migration from region H to L amounted\nto 1.9% of the population in region H. These large migration flows diffused the labor market\neffect of the expellee inflow from region H to region L. Consequently, a direct comparison of\nlabor market outcomes between the two regions does not reveal the causal effect of receiving\nhigh rather than low expellee inflows even if the initial distribution of expellees was random.3\nThis is all the more true at later stages of the adjustment process, as regional migration flows\naccumulate over time.\nTo isolate the causal effect of the expellee inflow despite regional migration, we develop a\ndynamic structural model with two regional labor markets that accounts for regional migration.\nThe backbone of this model is a dynamic two-region search and matching model of unemploy-\nment where workers also take a migration decision between the two regional labor markets.\nMigration is subject to costs, except for the initial expellee inflow which we model as an ex-\nogenous increase in the number of non-employed workers. In each region, a representative firm\nemploys many workers and accumulates capital to produce output. The firm faces costs when it\nadjusts its workforce or capital stock. We calibrate the model to historical data, and show that\nthe model's adjustment dynamics after the asymmetric historical expellee inflow closely fit our\nempirical facts. We then use the calibrated model to address our two research questions.\nWith respect to the first question, we find that regional labor markets approached the new\nsteady state about a decade after the expellee inflow. Regional migration played a crucial role\nin the adjustment process. About one-third of the initial increase in region H's population was\neventually absorbed through migration to the low-inflow region L. The adjustment process of the\n3Such simple comparison would violate the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA), which, in our\ncase, requires \u00ad over the entire adjustment path \u00ad labor market outcomes in one region to be unaffected by the\nexpellee inflow to the other region.\nnative population differs quite dramatically from the process of the population as a whole. The\nemployment probability of native workers decreases in the first few quarters of the adjustment\nprocess, whereas the employment probability of the average worker increases monotonically\nthroughout.\nThe negative effect of the expellee inflow on native employment is largest about nine quarters\nafter the arrival of the expellees. When measured at that time, 4.65 native workers lose their job\nfor every ten expellees who arrive in region H. Of those 4.65 native workers, 1.59 leave the labor\nforce, 2.23 enter the unemployment pool, and 0.83 leave region H for region L. About four years\nafter the inflow, migration to region L accounts for one-third of the decrease in region H's native\nemployment, and after 15 years it accounts for the entire decrease. The negative employment\neffect that we find is in line, also in magnitude, with recent evidence for Germany by Glitz\nWith respect to our second research question, we find that despite the large and long-lasting\nadjustment dynamics in regional labor markets, the expellee inflow decreased the expected dis-\ncounted lifetime labor income of the average native worker in West Germany only modestly by\n1.38%. However, the short-term decline in per-period labor income is much larger and reaches\nup to 5.34%. Even larger is the decline in wage income, but native workers mitigate the loss in\nwage income by drawing upon other sources of income. We also find that it takes more than a\ndecade for 90% of the loss in the expected discounted lifetime labor income of the average native\nworker to be realized, and that the magnitude of the loss depends on a worker's location and\nlabor market status at the time of the inflow.\nIncome losses of native workers crucially depend on the nature of the expellee inflow. In fact,\ncounterfactual analyses show that changes in the timing, regional distribution, and magnitude\nof the inflow can significantly reduce native income losses and dampen adjustment dynamics. In\nparticular, the adverse effects of expellees on native income are much less pronounced if the inflow\nis spread out over time. Distributing expellees more equally across regions than was the case\nhistorically accelerates expellees' integration into the labor market and increases their income.\nSurprisingly, however, a more equal distribution also increases the income loss of the average\nnative worker. Reducing the overall magnitude of the expellee inflow significantly decreases\nnative income losses but has little effect on the duration of adjustment.\nCohen-Goldner and Paserman (2011) is one of the few studies on the dynamic effects of\nimmigration on native wages and employment.4 The authors analyze the impact of the inflow of\nmore than one million Soviet Jews into Israel after the collapse of the Soviet Union. To capture\nthe dynamic adjustment to the inflow, the analysis allows the effects of immigrants to vary with\ntheir years of tenure in the Israeli labor market. The authors show that the initially negative\nwage effect of the inflow dies out after five to seven years. Their empirical approach exploits\nvariation in the migrant share across labor market segments and assumes that these labor market\nsegments are isolated from each other. In contrast, our structural approach directly accounts for\nmovements between regional labor market segments and therefore allows us to quantify the role\nof regional migration as an adjustment margin.\nA related literature, which, however, abstracts from adjustment dynamics, studies the link\nbetween immigration and subsequent internal migration of native workers. Some studies find that\nnative workers indeed respond to immigration by moving out to other areas (see, for example,\nno such effect (see, for example, Card and DiNardo (2000), Card (2001) or Kritz and Gurak\n(2001)). Our paper demonstrates that the effect of immigration on native out-migration depends\ncrucially on the regional asymmetry and magnitude of the immigrant inflow, and on the time\nelapsed since the inflow.\nThe economic literature has paid scarce attention to the labor market effects of forced rather\nthan voluntary migration (see Ruiz and Vargas-Silva (2013) for a review), despite the tens of\nmillions of persons who are forcefully displaced worldwide (UNHCR 2015). Braun and Mahmoud\n(2014) is, to the best of our knowledge, the only other study that analyzes the labor market\neffects of our specific episode of forced migration.5 The authors demonstrate that expellees had\na substantially negative effect on native employment in 1950. In contrast to our paper, Braun\nand Mahmoud (2014) focus on the short-term effect of the expellee inflow and do not quantify\nthe relative importance of different margins through which the West German economy adjusted\nover time to the expellee inflow.\n4In a recent paper, Monras (2015) analyzes the short- and long-term effects of Mexican immigration into the\nUS on the wages of low-skilled natives. He finds that Mexican-US immigration has large negative wage effects\nin the short run, and that regional migration quickly dissipates local labor supply shocks. Monras (2015) uses a\ndynamic structural model to obtain the evolution of wages in a counterfactual no-migration scenario. In contrast\nto our paper, however, he focuses on wage effects only \u00ad and hence abstracts from the unemployment and labor\nforce participation margins.\n5In addition, Bauer, Braun, and Kvasnicka (2013) and Falck, Heblich, and Link (2012) analyze the economic\nintegration of expellees in post-war West Germany, and Braun and Kvasnicka (2014) analyze the effect of the\ncation of production factors after German reunification in 1990, and shows that the integration process involves\nsignificant migration from East to West Germany.\nOur paper is also related to an emerging theoretical literature that studies the effect of\nimmigration within search and matching models. Ortega (2000) studies a two-country model, in\nwhich unemployed workers decide where to search for a job. Chassamboulli and Palivos (2014)\nanalyze the effects of immigration into the US, while Liu (2010) and Chassamboulli and Peri\n(2015) analyze the effect of illegal immigration into the US. Our work differs from these papers\nin three main respects. First, we focus on the adjustment dynamics triggered by immigration\nrather than on the steady-state effects of immigration. Second, we study the role of regional\nmigration within a country as an adjustment margin to immigration. Third, we calibrate key\nmodel parameters using data from a natural experiment.\nThis paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides background on our historical setting, and\nSection 3 derives empirical facts on how regional labor markets in West Germany adjusted to\nthe expellee inflow. Section 4 develops the structural model that we use to analyze the historical\ndata. Section 5 explains the calibration of model parameters and assesses the model fit. Section 6\ncontains our main results on the channels through which regional labor markets adjusted to the\nexpellee inflow, the associated income effects for native workers, and various robustness checks.\nSection 7 reports the results from our counterfactual exercises. Finally, Section 8 concludes.\n2 Historical background and nature of the expellee inflow\nBelow, we shall refer to those territories east of the present-day eastern border of Germany\nthat were part of the German Reich before World War I as eastern territories (see Figure 1\nfor an overview of Germany's territorial losses between 1919 and 1945). We shall refer to the\nFederal Republic of Germany as West Germany and to the German Democratic Republic as\nEast Germany (again, see Figure 1). Together, West and East Germany represent the territory\nof present-day Germany, to which we refer as post-war Germany.\nThree phases of displacement. The displacement of Germans from central and eastern\nEurope took place between 1944 and 1950, and occurred in three different phases. The first\nphase took place during the final stages of the war, the second phase occurred between the end\nof the war in May 1945 and the Potsdam Agreement in August 1945, and the third phase after\nthe conclusion of the Potsdam Agreement.\nThe first phase of the displacement took place as the Red Army advanced westwards in the\nfinal stages of World War II. As a result, hundreds of thousands of Germans from the eastern\nFigure 1: German territorial losses in World War I and II\nOder-Neisse line\nTerritories ceded after WWII\nTerritories ceded after WWI\nEast Germany\nWest Germany\nBerlin\nBrandenburg\nPomerania\nWest\nPrussia\nEast\nPrussia\nPosen\nSilesia\nterritories of the German Reich fled further inland. Most of these refugees planned to return\nhome after the end of the war, and therefore fled to regions close to their former homelands.\nAfter Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender in May 1945, some refugees did indeed manage\nto return home.\nThe second phase of the displacement took place in the months immediately following the end\nof the war. Polish authorities first prevented refugees from returning to their former homelands\nand then started to expel the remaining German population. These \"wild\" expulsions had not\nyet been sanctioned by an international treaty. The Czechoslovakian authorities soon followed\nthe Polish example and also began to drive the German population out of the country.\nThe third phase of the displacement began after the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and\nthe United States concluded the Potsdam Agreement of August 1945. The Agreement legalized\nand sanctioned the expulsion of Germans from central and eastern Europe and shifted the\nGerman-Polish border westwards. The eastern territories that Germany lost after World War II\nwere placed under Polish or Russian control (see Figure 1). Germans remaining east of the new\nborder were brought to post-war Germany in compulsory and organized transfers.\nThe Potsdam Agreement also divided post-war Germany into British, French, American, and\nSoviet zones of occupation. The three western zones were merged into West Germany in 1949.\nThe Soviet zone became East Germany in 1950. Below, we characterize the expellee inflow to\nWest Germany, which is the focus of our analysis.\nRegional distribution of expellees. The expellee inflow prompted a dramatic increase in\nthe population of West Germany. Despite heavy war losses, the West German population grew\narrived in West Germany, accounting for 16.3% of the West German population.\nMore than half of the expellees came from the eastern territories that Germany had ceded\nafter World War II, such as East Prussia and Silesia. Another quarter had lived in Czechoslovakia\nbefore the war, most of them in the Sudentenland.6 The remaining expellees came mostly from\nthe eastern territories that Germany had already ceded after its defeat in World War I, such as\nPosen and West Prussia.\nThe share of expellees in the population differed greatly across West German states, and\nranged at the end of 1949 from 3.1% in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate to 33.3% in Schleswig-\nHolstein. There are three main reasons for the very uneven regional distribution of expellees in\nWest Germany.\nFirst, German refugees who fled the approaching Red Army during the final stages of the war\n(first phase of displacement) mainly sought shelter in regions close to their former homelands.\nThe \"wild\" expulsions (second phase of displacement) only added to the uneven regional distri-\nbution, as Polish and Czechoslovakian authorities often just drove Germans across the border\ninto what was post-war Germany.\nSecond, the French refusal to admit any of the organized expellee transfers (third phase of\ndisplacement) to their zone of occupation led to a very uneven distribution of expellees between\nWest German occupation zones. As they had not been invited to the Potsdam Conference, the\nFrench did not feel bound by the Potsdam Agreement. Therefore, expellees to West Germany\nwere initially transferred only to the American and British zones of occupation.\nThird, expellees were more likely to be placed in areas where housing was available. Since the\n6The Sudetenland, though mainly inhabited by German speakers, had become part of the independent\nCzechoslovak state after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy in 1918. It was annexed by Nazi Germany\nAllied bombing campaigns had destroyed much of the housing stock in major West German cities,\nthe expellees often had to be transferred to more rural regions that had been less devastated by\nUnlike in most other immigration episodes, the initial regional distribution of expellees in\nWest Germany was not driven by local labor market conditions (Braun and Kvasnicka 2014,\nBraun and Mahmoud 2014). This was because in all three phases of the displacement, expellees\nwere generally unable to choose their initial destination in West Germany based on local eco-\nnomic conditions. As mentioned before, expellees fled to the most accessible regions west of\nthe front line in the first phase of the displacement, and were brought to West Germany in\ncompulsory expellee transfers in the second and third phase. Local authorities then distributed\nexpellees based on the availability of housing, not jobs (Nellner 1959). Regions that received\nmany expellees thus differed little in their pre-inflow economic conditions from regions that\nreceived only few expellees. We will back up this point in Section 3.\nThe regional distribution of expellees remained largely unchanged until the end of 1949\nbecause the occupying powers banned relocations in the immediate post-war period.8 The occu-\npying powers wanted all German residents, irrespective of whether they were expellees or not,\nto remain wherever they had arrived in Germany or had been located on the day of armistice.\nAfter the total ban was abolished in 1947, moving required permission from the military admin-\nistration (permission was granted mostly for family reunification). The restrictions on regional\nmobility were lifted only as late as May 1949 (M\u00a8\nto legal restrictions, the heavy destructions brought by the war and the resulting lack of housing\nspace impeded regional mobility at that time.\nSocio-demographic characteristics of expellees. Expellees were relatively close substi-\ntutes to native West Germans on the German labor market. They were all German native\nspeakers and had been educated in German schools. In addition, expellees and native inhabi-\ntants had, in most cases, been living in the same country for decades (the eastern territories,\nhome to most expellees, had been part of the German Reich since it was founded in 1871).\nMoreover, expellees were not a selected sub-group of their home regions, as virtually all Ger-\nmans living east of the new German-Polish border were forced to migrate. This contrasts with\no (2012) shows that geographic, rather than economic characteristics explain regional differences in the\nscale of housing damage. In particular, he finds that distance from the Royal Air Force headquarters in High\nWycombe was the crucial determinant in the scale of damage.\nTable 1: Socio-demographic characteristics of expellees and non-expellees\nExpelleesa Rest of the\npopulationb\nAge structure\nMarital status (aged 18 and above)\nData sources: All data except for educational attainment are from the census of 13\neducation are from our own calculations based on a 10% sample of the census of 27\nAmter des Bundes und der L\u00a8\ntable is reproduced from Braun and Kvasnicka (2014).\nNotes: a Expellees are defined as German nationals or ethnic Germans who on\n1 September 1939 lived (i) in the former German territories east of the Oder-\nNeisse line, (ii) in Saarland or (iii) abroad, but only if their mother tongue was\nGerman. b The education statistics distinguish between expellees and native West\nGermans (excluding non-German foreigners). All other statistics distinguish be-\ntween expellees and the rest of the population. c The education statistics are for\nwhelming majority of these persons should have completed their education by 1950.\nd We only have data on the highest school degree. Years of schooling are inferred\nfrom the minimum years of schooling required to obtain a particular degree.\nmost other migration episodes, in which immigrants are a selected group of the population from\nTable 1 shows that expellees and native West Germans were indeed very similar in their\nsocio-demographic characteristics. As is evident, there were more women than men among both\nexpellees and non-expellees, a legacy of the two world wars. Expellees were slightly younger than\nnative inhabitants and, therefore, also less likely to be married. Moreover, expellees had almost\nidentical years of schooling to natives, a similar probability of having completed vocational\ntraining, and a slightly higher probability of having graduated from university. Overall, therefore,\ndifferences between natives and expellees were small \u00ad especially when compared with other\nmigration episodes (see OECD (2008) for a detailed comparison of the characteristics of the\nimmigrant and native population in OECD countries).\n3 Empirical facts on regional development\nWe now present novel empirical facts on how regional labor markets in West Germany adjusted\nto the large and asymmetric inflow of expellees. We derive these facts by comparing the de-\nmographic and economic developments of two stylized regions, a high-inflow region H and a\nlow-inflow region L, between 1939 and 1970. Our key labor market variables are regional un-\nemployment rates and the West German labor force participation rate. We further describe the\nevolution of regional population and the underlying migration flows between the two regions.\nFinally, we use regional GDP per capita as a measure of regional income differences.9\n3.1 Regional classification and pre-war differences\nTable 2 shows how we classified the West German federal states (Bundesl\u00a8\nander) into a high-\nand a low-inflow region. It also provides an overview of expellee inflows into these regions, of\nselected economic characteristics before the war and of the regional degree of war damage.\nThe high-inflow region H consists of Bavaria, Lower Saxony, and Schleswig-Holstein. These\nthree states were called \"refugee states\" (Fl\u00a8\nuchtlingsl\u00a8\nander) in contemporary publications. Al-\nthough the refugee states accounted for only a third of West Germany's pre-war population,\nthey were hosting more than 60% of all expellees by the end of 1949. The population share of\nexpellees in region H was 25.1% (see column (3) of Table 2). The low-inflow region L consists of\nthe remaining West German states, namely Baden-W\u00a8\nurttemberg, Hesse, Rhineland-Palatinate,\nNorth Rhine-Westphalia, and the city states of Bremen and Hamburg.10 The population share\nof expellees in region L was 10.5% at the end of 1949, and thus less than half of the population\nshare in region H.\nThe states in region H hosted considerably more expellees than those in region L for all\nthree reasons discussed in Section 2. First, all three states in region H were relatively easily\naccessible for refugees who were fleeing the approaching Red Army during the final stages of\nthe war. Bavaria was the prime destination for refugees from neighboring Sudetenland, and\nSchleswig-Holstein was the prime destination for refugees from East-Prussia arriving via the\nBaltic Sea. Lower Saxony received an over-proportional number of refugees because of its general\n9Since our theoretical analysis focuses on labor income of workers, we would have preferred to use a measure of\nwage income. However, to the best of our knowledge, data on total wage income in the two regions is not available\nfor the period of our analysis.\n10Saarland was not yet part of West Germany in 1949.

Second, all three states were not located in the French zone\nof occupation that was initially sealed for expellees. Third, all three states retained a relatively\nintact housing stock during the war.\nBefore we compare the economic developments in the regions after the expellee inflow, we\nbriefly study whether the regions already differed before the inflow. Pre-existing differences might\nprovide an alternative explanation, other than the asymmetric expellee inflow, for observed\ndifferences in regional economic development after the inflow.\nColumns (4) to (7) of Table 2 report pre-war data on regional population growth, unem-\nployment, agricultural employment, and national income per capita, and column (8) shows the\npercentage of housing destroyed in the war. Before the war, population growth rates were very\nonly 0.7 percentage points more than the population in region L. Likewise, unemployment rates\nwere very similar before the war, reaching 1.6% in region H and 2.0% in region L in 1938 (see\nHowever, Table 2 also shows that region H was less industrialized and more rural in nature\nthan region L. This reflects the fact that, as discussed in Section 2, expellees were more likely\nto be transferred to rural areas than to urban areas. The table illustrates that in 1939, 36.5%\nof the labor force in region H, but just 21.8% in region L, worked in the agricultural sector\n(see column (6)). Since the agricultural sector was less productive than the non-agricultural\nsector (Eichengreen and Ritschl 2009), region H was also somewhat poorer than region L (see\ncolumn (7)). In fact, national income per capita was around 8% lower in H than in L in 1936.12\nMoreover, the more rural region H also suffered less from war damage than region L, since\nthe Allied bombing campaign primarily targeted German cities. Around 12% of all dwellings\nin region H were destroyed during the war, considerably less than the West German average of\n11In the wake of the massive rearmament policy undertaken by Nazi Germany, full employment existed in 1938.\nUnemployment figures for 1938 might, therefore, be uninformative about structural differences in unemployment\nrates between the two regions. Prior to 1938, unemployment tended to be somewhat lower in region H than in\nregion L. In fact, the unemployment rate in 1936 was 6.3% in region H and 9.2% in region L. Importantly, there is\nno evidence that unemployment was higher in region H before the war, as we observe it for the post-war period.\n12 Since pre-war data on unemployment and income are not available for the West German states in their\npost-war borders, we had to approximate their values for regions H and L. We approximate 1936 national income\nin region H as the population-weighted average of income in Bavaria, Hanover, and Schleswig-Holstein. We then\nuse the average national income in the rest of West Germany (excluding Hamburg and Bremen, Oldenburg,\nBraunschweig, Lippe, Schaumburg-Lippe) as a proxy for national income in region L. We discard the data for\nBremen, Oldenburg, Braunschweig, Lippe, and Schaumburg-Lippe, as data for these regions are only reported as\nan aggregate figure. The aggregation from the former regions of the German Reich to our stylized regions is far\nfrom perfect. Therefore, the figures should be interpreted with some caution.\nTable 2: Expellee inflows, pre-war differences and war damage in West German states\nExpellee1 inflows Pre-war differences War damage\npopulation population in 1949 change, employment labor force in income per destroyed\nBaden-W\u00a8\nData sources: Data on expellees in 1949 come from Statistisches Bundesamt (1955c).

Pre-war unemployment data is not\navailable for the West German states in their post-war borders. The unemployment rate of region H is approximated by the labor-force-weighted average of\nthe unemployment rates in the employment agency districts of Bavaria, Lower Saxony, Nordmark.

In additional\nrobustness checks, however, we incorporate these differences into our analysis in two ways (see\nSection 6.3). First, we account for them directly in our model. In particular, we allow for regional\ndifferences in the degree of war damage. Second, we use an alternative classification of federal\nstates that levels out pre-existing differences in the degree of industrialization and war damage.\nWe then show that both the empirical facts and our quantitative results in the structural model\nare robust to the use of this alternative classification.\nWe compare the demographic and economic developments of regions H and L in 1939, i.e.,\nbefore the flight and expulsion, and between 1950 and 1970, i.e., in the first two decades after\nthe expellee inflow was complete.\nUnemployment and labor force participation. Figure 2 shows the unemployment rates in\nas time-consistent regional employment data is not available after then). Before the war, both\nregions had almost full employment (unemployment rates were 1.6% and 2% in region H and\nL, respectively). Unemployment then increased dramatically in both regions in the immediate\npost-war period. However, the situation was much more severe in the high-inflow region H, where\nthe unemployment rate was 16.7% in 1950, than in the low-inflow region L, where it was 6.4%.\nThe 1950 unemployment rate in region H thus exceeded the unemployment rate in region L\nby a factor of two and a half. Expellees were much more likely to be unemployed than native\nworkers at that time: every third unemployed person in West Germany was an expellee in 1950\n(compared with a share of expellees in the population of 16.5%).13\nRegional unemployment rates in both regions then gradually decreased in the 1950s. By\nthe early 1960s, both regions were back at what was basically full employment. Nevertheless,\nunemployment remained slightly higher in region H than in region L until 1963.\nWe augment the unemployment data with data on labor force participation because the\nunemployment data only cover persons who were officially registered as unemployed. In contrast,\npersons who would generally like to work but have nevertheless withdrawn from the labor market,\n13Expellees then benefited dis-proportionally from the fall in unemployment in the 1950s. By 1958, their share\namong the unemployed had fallen to 22.0%. Unfortunately, we cannot calculate separate unemployment rates for\nexpellees and non-expellees, as our data on employment does not distinguish between the two groups.\nsay because they consider their chances of finding a job to be small, are not officially registered\nas unemployed. An increase in the number of discouraged workers does not, therefore, show up\nas an increase in unemployment, but rather as a fall in labor force participation.\nFigure 2 shows that the decline in regional unemployment in the 1950s coincided with an\n(unfortunately, participation rates are not available at a regional level for 1950-63).14 Labor force\nparticipation was, therefore, low in 1950, most likely because labor market prospects were dire.\nThis suggests that hidden unemployment was high at that time. As the labor market recovered,\nand the probability of finding a job grew, formerly discouraged workers might have increasingly\nchosen to re-join the labor force.\nLaborforceparticipation\nUnemployment\nUnemploymentrate,regionH\nUnemploymentrate,regionL\nUnemploymentrate,West\nGermany\nLaborforceparticipationrate,\nWestGermany\nData sources: The unemployment data come from L\u00a8\nanderrat des Amerikanischen Besatzungsgebiets (1949)\n(for 1938) and from various issues of the Amtliche Nachrichten of the Bundesanstalt f\u00a8\nur Arbeitsvermittlung\nund Arbeitslosenversicherung (for 1950-63). Data on economically active persons, used to calculate the labor\nforce participation rate, are taken from Sensch (2004), Table B3.1. Data on the total population aged 16-65\ncome from the Statistisches Bundesamt.\nNotes: The unemployment rate is expressed as a percentage of the dependent labor force. The unemployment\nrate of region H in 1938 is approximated by the (labor force-weighted) average of the 1938 unemployment rates\nof Bavaria, Lower Saxony, Nordmark, the unemployment rate of region L by the average of the unemployment\nrates of Hesse, Southwest Germany, Rhineland and Westphalia. The labor force participation rate is the ratio\nof all economically active persons to the population aged 15-65.\n14We report the labor force participation rate for the same period, for which unemployment data are available.\nThe labor force participation rate is the ratio of all economically active persons to the population aged 15-65.\nWe do not compare the post-war labor force participation rate to its pre-war level because the war dramatically\nchanged the demographic composition of the West German population. For instance, men in their twenties were\nmore likely to die in the war than women or older men. Since labor force participation rates vary strongly by age\nand gender, the war is likely to have had a major effect on labor force participation.\nPopulation and internal migration. The red line in Figure 3 shows that the population\nexpellee inflow, therefore, changed the relative size of the two regions dramatically.15 Relative\nThe blue line in Figure 3 shows that regional migration from H to L was by far the most im-\nportant factor in moving the relative population size of the two regions back towards its pre-war\nlevel. The line shows how the relative population size of the two regions would have evolved if the\nonly reason for changes in the relative population size had been migration between region H and\nregion L. The migration-based population series thus abstracts from other potential influences,\nsuch as differences in fertility rates or migration from abroad, on the relative population size of\nFigure 4 plots the migration-based population series separately for native inhabitants and\nexpellees, and shows that regional migration markedly reduced the relative population of both\ngroups in the 1950s.

In fact, the migration rate of expellees stood at a stunning 4.4% in 1950\n\u00ad and was thus four times higher than the migration rate of natives (1.1%). It fell in tandem\nwith the overall regional migration rate but still exceeded it in 1958.\nGDP per capita. Figure 5 shows GDP per capita of region H relative to region L between\nregion L's level. The regional gap then narrowed considerably during the 1950s and early 1960s,\nimprovement in region H's relative GDP per capita. If anything, the gap in comparison with\n15The inflow of expellees was by far the most important driver of this dramatic increase in relative population\n(see Braun and Mahmoud (2014) for a comprehensive overview of regional population changes in West Germany\nbetween 1939 and 1950). However, it was not the only one. Even without the inflow of expellees, region H's\ncontrast, would have decreased by 2.0%. There are two main reasons for this difference. First, the states of Lower\nSaxony and Schleswig-Holstein, both part of region H, bordered the Soviet zone of occupation, and, therefore, also\nreceived a disproportionately large share of migrants from what was to become the German Democratic Republic.\nSecond, the number of civilian casualties was lower in rural areas than in urban areas, and therefore many city\ndwellers, especially from Bremen and Hamburg, were evacuated to more rural areas during the war.\nSince we consider only the expellee inflow and endogenous regional migration as a sources of population change,\nwe calibrate the model to an adjusted relative population of the two regions in 1939. The adjustment adds to the\nfor by the expellee inflow. We calculate the residual as the difference between the historical population change\nBasedonnetmigrationonly\nData source: Statistisches Bundesamt, Institut f\u00a8\nur Raumforschung.\nNote: Population is measured at the end of each year.

Unfortunately, there are\nno pre-war GDP data for West German regions that are comparable to the post-war data. To\nnevertheless gauge the pre- to post-war changes in relative GDP per capita, we use two proxies\nfor regional differences in GDP per capita before the war (see Appendix A.1 for more details on\nthe two proxies).\nThe first proxy uses national income data from 1936, as also reported in Table 2. National\nincome per capita of region H reached 92% of region L's value in 1936. Judged by this measure,\nregion H suffered a significant fall in relative GDP per capita following the expellee inflow (Figure\n5 shows the 1936 value of relative national income along with data for relative GDP per capita\nfor 1950-70). The second proxy for regional differences in GDP per capita uses firm sales as a\nproxy for production, as suggested by Vony\u00b4\no (2012). Relative sales per capita in region H fell\nOverall, therefore, both proxies suggest that relative GDP per capita decreased significantly\n(and early 1960s). Since we do not have comparable data on GDP per capita from before the\nwar, we cannot conclude whether or not relative GDP per capita returned to its pre-inflow level.\n70 are from the Statistisches Bundesamt.\nNotes: The data point for 1936 is the (approximated) national income of region H relative to region L. We\ncalculate the 1936 national income in region H as the population-weighted average of income in Bavaria,\nHanover, and Schleswig-Holstein. We then use the average national income in the rest of West Germany (ex-\ncluding Hamburg and Bremen, Oldenburg, Braunschweig, Lippe, Schaumburg-Lippe) as a proxy for national\nincome in region L. See the text for further explanation. All other data points give GDP per capita of region\nH relative to region L.\nSummary of empirical facts. To sum up, we have established five empirical facts.\n16As evident, the relative level of sales per capita is lower than the relative level of GDP per capita. This is\nmainly due to the fact that the share in sales per capita of the two city states, which are both part of region L,\nis much larger than their share in GDP per capita. Comparable data is no longer available after 1955.\n1950 unemployment rate was two and half times larger in region H than in region L. Un-\nemployment then gradually declined during the 1950s, and both regions were recording full\nemployment again by the early 1960s. Expellees were much more likely to be unemployed\nthan natives.\n2. The labor force participation rate in West Germany increased strongly between 1950 and\n4. Migration from region H to L was the decisive factor in moving relative population back\ntowards its pre-war level in the 1950s. Expellees were much more likely to leave region H\nfor region L than native inhabitants.\nH experienced considerably faster economic growth than region L up to the early 1960s.\nTo quantify to what extent these empirical facts can indeed be understood as a consequence\nof the expellee inflow, we now derive a dynamic two-region search and matching model of unem-\nployment. The benchmark model acts upon the assumptions that the two regions were identical\nbefore the inflow, and that no asymmetric shock other than the expellee inflow hit the two\nregions over the time period considered. We relax both assumptions in our robustness checks in\nThe dynamic search and matching model allows us to quantify and interpret the regional\nadjustment processes after the inflow shock, because it offers three important advantages over\na reduced-form regression model. First, the search and matching model accounts for regional\nmigration that diffuses the effect of regional expellee inflows. Such diffusion effects are difficult\nto account for in purely empirical work, especially when the data have a long time dimension.\nSecond, the dynamic search and matching model allows us to assess the effect of the expellee\ninflow on variables that we do not directly observe in the data, such as regional wages, regional\nemployment of native workers and expellees, or the cost of regional migration. Therefore, we can\nquantify the effects of immigration on natives using comprehensive income measures. Finally,\nthe dynamic search and matching model allows us to run counterfactual exercises, in which we\nTime\nPeriod t starts Period t ends\nExpellees (if any)\narrive as non-\nemployed workers\nNon-employed workers\ndecide about labor mar-\nket participation\nNon-employed, partic-\nipating workers decide\nabout migration\nProduction\nJob separation\nFigure 6: Timing of events in period t.\ncan disentangle the importance of different variables, such as the regional distribution of the\nexpellee inflow or the magnitude of migration costs, in shaping adjustment dynamics and the\neffect on native income.\n4 A dynamic model of regional labor markets\nThe backbone of our model is the textbook Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides search and matching\nmodel of unemployment. We depart from a version of this model with endogenous labor force\nparticipation and extend it in two directions that are motivated by the particular historical\nepisode that we study.\nOur first extension is regional migration. We consider two regional labor markets \u00ad one in\nregion H and another in region L \u00ad that interact via migration. Workers who search for a job\nchoose whether to search in region H or L.17 Migration decisions are forward looking and subject\nto migration costs. Our second extension incorporates regional expellee inflows into the model.\nWe model them as an exogenous increase in the number of non-employed workers, i.e., as a labor\nsupply shock, and calibrate the regional distribution of this shock from the historical data.\nIn each region, a representative firm employs many workers and accumulates capital to pro-\nduce output. Output is homogenous across regions and serves as numeraire. Adjusting employ-\nment or the capital stock is subject to adjustment costs. Furthermore, we consider a competitive\nequilibrium, in which firms and workers bargain over the wage. Our description of the model\nfocuses on region H with the understanding that region L is formulated symmetrically to region\nH. Variables that pertain to region L are superscripted by a star and/or subscripted by L.\n4.1 Labor market stocks and flows\nThe working-age population Pt in region H at time t comprises employed workers Nt, unemployed\nworkers Ut, and non-participating workers Rt, and hence Pt = Nt +Ut +Rt. Regional population\nevolves over time, because Xt expellees enter the labor market in region H exogenously and\nnon-employed workers move endogenously between regions. This yields\nPt = Pt-1 + Xt + Gt\n- Gt , (1)\nwhere Gt\n- Gt denotes net migration to region H.\nFigure 6 summarizes the timing of events within a period. We assume that all expellees are\nnon-employed upon arrival, because they were forced to emigrate to a new environment and,\nhence, gave up previous employment. Despite initial non-employment, however, some expellees\nin the model are employed by the end of the first period, because a worker can move through\nseveral labor market states within a period.\nWe also assume that expellees are homogenous to native workers in our model. The homo-\ngeneity assumption reflects the fact that expellees and natives were close substitutes on the West\nGerman labor market (see Section 2). Burda (2006) adopts a similar homogeneity assumption\nin his analysis of regional economic integration between East and West Germany after German\nreunification.\nFigure 6 shows that non-employed workers, both expellees and natives, decide at the begin-\nning of period t whether or not to participate in the labor market. The workers' participation\nprobability, denoted by t, then determines the size of the reserve pool Rt of workers who are\nout of the labor force:\nRt = (1 - t)[Pt-1 + Xt\nSquare brackets in this equation contain the number of non-employed workers at time t, which\nequals population in the previous period Pt-1 plus expellee inflow Xt minus workers with ongoing\njobs (1 - )Nt-1. Here, 0 <  < 1 denotes the fraction of previously employed workers who are\nexogenously separated from their jobs.\nParticipating workers who are non-employed decide whether they migrate to region L's labor\n17Ortega (2000) and Chassamboulli and Peri (2015) also assume that only workers who search for a job, but\nnot workers who are employed, decide whether to migrate.\nmarket. The participation decision predates the migration decision (see Figure 6), because we\ntreat migration as being motivated by labor market prospects. The workers' migration proba-\nbility, denoted by t, then determines H to L migration:\nGt = t[Pt-1 + Xt\nProduction in region H takes place once the participating workers who stay in region H have\nmoved into either unemployment or employment. Employment, which evolves according to\ncorresponds to new jobs, denoted by Mt, plus workers with ongoing jobs. The sum of employed\nand unemployed workers equals the labor force, i.e., Lt = Nt +Ut. Unemployed workers, workers\nseparated from their job, and non-participating workers enter the next period as non-employed,\nand a new labor market cycle begins.\nEquations (1) to (4) determine population, employment, H to L migration, and the labor\nforce in region H given initial conditions P-1 and N-1, L to H migration Gt\n, expellee inflow Xt,\nand transition probabilities t and t.\n4.2 Labor market states and their values\nIn each period, a worker occupies one out of six labor market states. These states are employment,\nunemployment, and non-participation in either region H or L. Each state is accompanied by a\nvalue function that determines a worker's value of being in this state. The value of an employed\nworker in region H at date t is denoted by Wt and recursively computed as\nWt = wt + (1 - )Wt+1 + Eh max(Ht+1(h), (5)\n- ) ) .\nThe employed worker receives wage wt (in units of the numeraire) at date t and the expected\ncontinuation value, discounted at 0 <  < 1, at date t + 1. The expected continuation value in\nequation (5) has two parts. The first part occurs with likelihood 1 -  and is the value Wt+1 of\na worker who remains employed in the next period. The second part occurs with likelihood \nand is the value of a worker who loses his job at the end of period t. This second part depends\non the two sequential decisions, each indicated by a max operator, that the worker takes at the\nbeginning of period t + 1.\nThe worker decides to participate in the labor market if the value of non-participation,\ndenoted by Ht+1(h), is smaller than the value of participation (captured by E[. . . ] in equation\n(5)). The value of non-participation depends on the idiosyncratic home benefit parameter h  0\nthat each non-employed worker draws at the beginning of a period from a random distribution\nwith cdf . Operator Eh denotes the worker's date t expectation about this source of date t + 1\nuncertainty.\nFurthermore, the worker decides to migrate to region L if the value of searching for a job in\nregion H is smaller than the value of searching for a job in region L net of migration costs. The\nvalue of searching for a job in region H, t+1Wt+1 + (1 - t+1)Qt+1, depends on the job-finding\nrate t+1, the value of an employed worker Wt+1, and the value of an unemployed worker Qt+1.\nMigration costs are denoted by   0 and are idiosyncratic. At the beginning of a period, each\nnon-employed worker draws  from a distribution with cdf . Draws  and h are independent\nof each other.\nThe value of an unemployed worker in region H is recursively computed according to\nQt = z + Eh max(Ht+1(h), (6)\n- ) ) .\nThe unemployed worker receives unemployment benefits z > 0 and the expected discounted\ncontinuation value. The continuation value of the unemployed worker refers to the same sequence\nof participation and migration decision through which an employed worker moves when he loses\nhis job at the end of period t.\nFinally, the value of a worker who does not participate in the labor market and has home\nbenefit parameter h corresponds to\nHt(h) = h - z + Qt . (7)\nThis parsimonious formulation of Ht(h) emerges, because we model participation as a decision\nabout the current period only. Thus, the continuation value of the unemployed worker in equation\n(6), which corresponds to Qt\n- z, and the continuation value of the non-participating worker\ncoincide.\n4.3 Migration and participation probabilities\nThere is a critical level of idiosyncratic migration costs, denoted by c\nt\n, at which the worker is\nindifferent between regions, because this critical level equates the value of searching for a job in\nregion H to the value of searching for a job in region L net of migration costs:\nc\nt\n= [t\nWt\n)Qt\n] - {tWt + (1 - t)Qt\nIdiosyncratic migration costs  below c\nt\ninduce the worker to migrate, whereas idiosyncratic\ncosts above c\nt\nprevent migration. Accordingly, c\nt\ndetermines the probability of a worker mi-\ngrating from region H to L in period t, conditional on this worker being non-employed at the\nbeginning of this period:\nt = (c\nt\nWe assume that  is uniform over [0, a] with parameter a > 0. We interpret 1/a, which determines\nthe sensitivity of t with respect to c\nt\n, as workers' propensity to migrate, because increasing\n1/a makes t more sensitive to c\nt\n [0, a]. A small propensity to migrate also coincides with\nlarge (unconditional) expected migration costs, which are equal to a/2.\nThere is also a critical level of home benefits, denoted by hc\nt\n, at which the worker is indifferent\nbetween participation and non-participation, because this critical level equates the value of non-\nparticipation to the value of participation:\nH(hc\nt\n) = E max(tWt + (1 - t)Qt, t\nWt\n)Qt\n- ) .\nRearranging this equation using the probability of migrating, t, and expected idiosyncratic\nmigration costs conditional on migration, denoted by \u00af\nt = E[| < c\nt\n], yields\nH(hc\nt\n) = (1 - t) tWt + (1 - t)Qt + t t\nWt\n)Qt\n- \u00af\nt .\nReplacing H(hc\nt\n) by hc\nt\n- z + Qt (see equation (7)) and further rearranging yields\nhc\nt\n= z + t(Wt\n- Qt) + t(c\nt\n- \u00af\nThus, hc\nt\nis bounded from below by the level of unemployment benefit z and increases when\nlabor market prospects improve. Improved prospects in region H increase the expected net value\nof work t(Wt\n- Qt). Furthermore, improved prospects in region L make migration from region\nH to L more attractive and, hence, increase the expected net value of migration t(c\nt\n- \u00af\nt). The\ncritical level of home benefits determines the probability of participating,\nt = (hc\nt\nbecause draws of h  0 above hc\nt\ninduce the worker not to participate in the labor market.\nWe assume that  is uniform over [e0, e1] with e0 < e1. We interpret e0, which determines\nthe sensitivity of the participation probability with respect to hc\nt\n, as workers' propensity to\nparticipate in the labor market, because increasing e0 makes t more sensitive to hc\nt\nUsing equations (8) to (11), we rewrite value functions (5) and (6) in terms of transition\nprobabilities, the expected net value of migration t(c\nt\n- \u00af\nt), and the expected net value of\nstaying at home (1 - t)(\u00af\nht\n- hc\nt\n):\n)\n- \u00af\n)\n- \u00af\nwhere \u00af\nht is the expected home benefit conditional on non-participation, i.e., \u00af\nht = Eh[h|h  hc\nt\n].\nTransition probabilities t, t, and t, which workers take as given, are endogenously determined\nin equilibrium.\n4.4 Firm behavior, wage bargaining, and labor market matching\nWorkers in region H are employed by firms in this region. Firms use their workforce and capital\nstock to produce output. Output is homogenous across regions and serves as numeraire. Firms\nare indexed by j  [0, 1], and the behavior of a representative firm j follows from a standard\nprofit maximization problem. In this problem, the firm selects (sequences of) employment Njt,\nvacancies Vjt, capital stock Kjt, and investment Ijt to maximize its discounted period profits:\nmax\n{Vjt,Njt,Kjt,Ijt}\n\nt [F(Kjt-1, Njt) - wtNjt\n- Ijt\n- C(Vjt, Njt, qt)] s.t. (14)\nand subject to the initial conditions Kj,-1, Ij,-1, Nj,-1.\nPeriod profits accrue from output, which the firm produces with technology F(\u00b7), after de-\nducting the wage bill wtNjt, investment Ijt, and employment adjustment costs C(\u00b7). Employment\nin equation (15) comprises (non-separated) incumbent workers and new workers, which arrive\nat the job-filling rate qt (defined below). Capital in equation (16) depreciates at rate  and is\nsubject to investment adjustment costs B(\u00b7), which penalize changes in investment and, hence,\nslows down capital accumulation. Furthermore, Lagrange multiplier jt denotes the value of one\nextra unit of capital, and multiplier Jjt denotes the value of one extra worker. Solving the firm\nproblem yields standard optimality conditions.\nEmployment adjustment costs (EACs) are a major part of the firm problem. EACs tend to\nbe convex in the literature that uses aggregate data, but they tend to be linear and contain a\nfixed costs component in the literature that uses disaggregated (firm-level) data.18 Our historical\ndata refer to regional labor markets and are, hence, accompanied by an intermediate degree of\naggregation. Therefore, we treat the amount of cost convexity as a parameter that we calibrate\nbelow and also add fixed costs per worker to our specification of EACs. Fixed costs emerge\nfrom recruiting and on-the-job training of new workers but also from incumbent workers' fringe\nbenefits, such as sick leave, health insurance and pensions. We use the following functional form\nfor EACs with non-negative parameters 0, 1, and 2 (omitting the j subscript):\nC(Vt, Nt, qt) = 0Nt +\n(exp[2(qtt\nHere, t denotes the vacancy rate Vt/Nt and qtt denotes the hiring rate, which equals  in\nsteady state. Adjustment costs are proportional to employment and increase in the hiring rate\n18 For aggregate data, Yashiv (2000) and Yashiv (2006) use adjustment costs that are convex (cubic) in vacancies\nand new workers; Merz and Yashiv (2007) use a generalized convex cost function that increases in the hiring\nrate; and Gertler, Sala, and Trigari (2008) and Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Trabandt (2013) apply quadratic\nadjustment costs to hiring new workers. For firm-level data, Yaman (2011) estimates linear EACs; Bloom (2009)\nand Cooper, Haltiwanger, and Willis (2007) estimate linear EACs with a strong fixed cost component; and Dolfin\n(2006) demonstrates the relevance of fixed costs per worker.\nto capture costs for training and integrating new workers into the workforce.19 Parameter 2,\nwhich we interpret as firms' propensity to not adjust employment, governs costs convexity. A\nconvenient property of equation (17) is that it decouples the model's steady state (depending on\n0 and 1) from the model's dynamics (also depending on 2). This property, which follows from\nincorporating fixed costs per worker and expressing the hiring rate relative to its steady-state\nvalue, simplifies parameter calibration below.\nIn every period, firm j bargains with its workers over the wage. We assume that the wage\nis determined by Nash bargaining and thus maximizes the weighted product (Wt\njt\n,\nwhich comprises a worker's net surplus from work Wt\n- Qt and the firm's net surplus from one\nextra worker Jjt. The bargaining process yields the surplus sharing rule\nWt\n- Qt =\n\nwhere 0 <  < 1 denotes a worker's share of the total surplus from creating the job, Jjt+Wt\n-Qt.\nNon-employed workers who participate in the labor market in region H are matched to firms\nin this region through the regional matching function M(St, Vt). Its first argument refers to\nthe number of workers in region H who search for jobs, St = Ut + Mt. Its second argument\nVt refers to the aggregate number of vacancies. We have assumed that regional labor markets\nare segregated, and thus postulate two regional matching functions instead of one aggregate\nmatching function.20\nWe define labor market tightness as the ratio of aggregate vacancies over workers searching\nfor jobs, t = Vt/St, and the job-filling rate as matched workers over aggregate vacancies,\nq(t) = M(St, Vt)/Vt. Rearranging the latter shows that the job-finding rate equals market\ntightness times the job-filling rate, t = tq(t).\n19We also used a more general specification of EACs that allows for vacancy posting costs. However, in no case\ndid we find that vacancy posting costs improved the fit of our model to the historical data. This is consistent\nwith Yashiv (2000) who also finds a predominant role of post-match EACs using data on the Israeli labor market.\nSimilarily, Silva and Toledo (2009) estimate that post-match EACs account for about 92% of both post-match\nand pre-match EACs in US data.\n20The assumption of segmented labor markets is common in the literature (see, for example, Epifani and Gancia\nwas still costly at that time, and the average household did not own a car or a telephone. Furthermore, we consider\ntwo large regional labor markets, so that the average distance between two arbitrary locations within these labor\nmarkets is large as well. Therefore, workers would have had to travel relatively great distances to reach the other\nlabor market for, for instance, a job interview.\nWe consider an equilibrium with symmetric firms within each region and thus Vt = Vjt, Nt =\nNjt, It = Ijt, Kt = Kjt, Jt = Jjt and t = jt. Furthermore, we use a Cobb Douglas technology,\nYt = F(Nt, Kt-1) = AN\nt\n, with A > 0 and 0 <  < 1; a Cobb Douglas matching function,\nM(St, Vt) = S\nt\nt\n, with  > 0 and 0 <  < 1; and quadratic investment adjustment\ncosts, B(It/It-1) = b(It/It-1 - 1)2/2, with b  0. We solve the model numerically using the\ndeterministic extended path algorithm of Fair and Taylor (1983), as implemented in Adjemian,\nBastani, Karam\u00b4\ne, Juillard, Maih, Mihoubi, Perendia, Ratto, and Villemot (2011). This algorithm\nassumes perfect foresight and accounts for permanent shifts in variables and nonlinearities in\nthe model.\n5 Model calibration and fit\nWe choose the parameters of the model in three steps. In the parametrization step, we set initial\nconditions and expellee inflow rates to historical values and a first set of parameters to values\nconventional in the literature. In the second step, we calibrate a second set of parameters by tar-\ngeting steady-state values of endogenous variables. In the third step, we calibrate the remaining\nthree parameters by minimizing the distance between the model's adjustment dynamics after\nthe expellee inflow and a subset of the historical time series described in Section 3. We use the\nother historical time series as non-targeted moments to evaluate the model fit, and discuss in\nSection 6.3 the model fit for plausible alternative parameter calibrations.\nWe set initial conditions and expellee inflow rates to the historical values in the upper panel\nof Table 3.

Moreover, initial\nregional capital stocks per capita, K-1/P-1 and K-1\n, start from below their steady-state\nvalues to account for war-related capital damage. According to Krengel (1958), 19% of the West\nGerman industrial capital stock was destroyed in the war. Regional expellee inflows are equal\nto the regional expellee population on 31 December 1949, as shown in column (2) of Table 2,\nafter expressing the regional expellee population relative to the West German population.

The value of the separation rate  yields the\naverage monthly separation rate of 1.8% that we observe in historical data on West Germany\n5.2 Targeting steady-state values\nWe calibrate a second set of parameters, summarized in Table 4, by targeting steady-state values\nof endogenous variables. We consider a steady state that is symmetric in both regions. Therefore,\nparameters in Table 4 apply to either region.\nTo calibrate unemployment benefit z in Table 4, we equate the unemployment rate in steady\n21We calculate the rate by dividing the number of persons who became newly unemployed in a given month\nby the number of employed persons in the previous months. Data come from the German employment agency\nand are available once per quarter (i.e., we use monthly data that we observe only once per quarter). From\nSeptember 1955 onwards, the employment agency records inflows into the pool of job seekers instead of inflows\ninto unemployment. Employment data are no longer available for 1964-70.\nTable 4: Parameters calibrated by targeting steady-state variables\nVariable Description Target Parameter Description Value\nC/M Av. costs / new worker CV /q 0 Av. costs per worker 0.0194\nNotes: Columns (1) and (3) list endogenous variables along with their steady-state values that we target.

See Section 5 for further explanation.\nstate to its historical value in West Germany in 1963 and solve for z. We treat the 1963 value\nas steady state, because the West German unemployment rate was as low as 0.8% in 1963 and\nstayed almost constant until the early 1970s. To calibrate 1, which determines firms' expected\ncosts to hire the marginal worker, CV /q = 1/, we set the replacement ratio z/w to 51%. This\nvalue corresponds to the average earnings replacement ratio between 1950 and 1970 of a single\nunemployed beneficiary (Flora 1986). We calibrate 0, which equals average costs per worker\nC/N, by assuming that expected costs to hire the marginal worker equal average costs per newly\nhired worker, CV /q = C/M. This yields 0 = 1 and implies that average costs per newly hired\nworker equal 56% of the quarterly wage in steady state. This value aligns well with existing\nTo calibrate the value of the matching efficiency  in Table 4, we target the quarterly job-\nfilling rate in West Germany between 1950 and 1970 (see Appendix A.3). Finally, we normalize\nregional output per capita to unity and derive regional productivity A from this normalization.\n5.3 Targeting adjustment dynamics\nWe calibrate the remaining three parameters by targeting a subset of the historical time series\ndescribed in Section 3. These parameters are workers' propensity to participate in the labor\nmarket e0, their propensity to migrate 1/a and firms' propensity not to adjust employment 2.\nThese \"propensity parameters\" do affect the model's adjustment dynamics to the expellee inflow,\nbut they do not affect the model's steady state. The steady state is independent of the propensity\nto participate e0 and the propensity to migrate 1/a, because we consider a steady state with full\n22Using US data, Silva and Toledo (2009) report average costs per newly hired worker of close to 60% of the\nRelating this estimate to a gross monthly wage of EUR 2,551 in Germany in the year 2000 yields a cost estimate\nlabor force participation and without expellee inflow and hence regional migration. It follows\nfrom our functional form of EACs in equation (17) that the steady state is also independent of\nWe calibrate the propensity parameters by minimizing the distance between the model's\nsimulated adjustment path after the expellee inflow and the historical time series (see Redding\nand Sturm (2008) for a similar calibration approach). We measure distance as D =  W. The\nvector  is n \u00d7 1, and each of its elements j denotes the mean absolute difference between a\nvariable in the model and the historical data,\nj =\nT\nabs(yt\n- ydata\nt\nusing yt to denote a generic variable. W is a diagonal matrix that weighs the contribution of a\nvariable to D by the inverse of this variable's mean in historical data. W is normalized so that\nmain diagonal elements sum to unity.\nWe use data on n = 4 variables, namely relative population Pt/Pt\n, the average unemploy-\nment rate (Ut +Ut\n)/(Lt +Lt\n), average labor force participation (Lt +Lt\n)/(Pt +Pt\n) and relative\nGDP per capita YtPt\n/(Yt\npopulation series that abstracts from influences other than regional migration (see Section 3.2),\nsince our model also abstracts from such influences. We also normalize the historical data on\nrelative GDP per capita and labor force participation by dividing each time series by its 1963\nvalue. Much like the unemployment rate, we thus treat these 1963 values as steady-state values.23\nThis normalization aligns the data with the measurement suggested by our model, because in\nthe model we consider a steady state with the same level of GDP per capita in each region and\nfull participation. We linearly interpolate all historical data from annual to quarterly frequency.\nBefore turning to the model fit of the historical time series, we discuss the plausibility of\ncalibrated propensity parameters. The propensity to participate e0 that minimizes distance\nD is equal to 0.33 and implies a long-run labor supply elasticity at the extensive margin with\nrespect to the real wage, d log(L/P)/d log w, of 0.14.24 The value is at the lower range of existing\n23Two observations suggest that relative GDP per capita had reached its steady-state value by 1963. First,\nrelative GDP per capita stopped increasing by the end of the 1950s and stayed fairly constant throughout the\n1960s (see Figure 5). Second, despite lower GDP per capita in region H than L, workers did not migrate from\nregion H to L in the 1960s. Moreover, participation was arguably in steady state in 1963, because there was\nbasically full employment at that time and the participation rate had hardly changed since 1957 (see Figure 2).\n24In the model, this elasticity refers only to endogenous variables. Therefore, we consider a permanent reduction\nin exogenous aggregate productivity, which reduces wt\nby 1% and also reduces Lt\n/Pt\n. In the short run, the\nreduction in Lt\n/Pt\ndepends on many, if not all, model parameters, but it depends on only e0\nin the long run.\nestimates. In a meta-study of nine quasi-experimental studies, Chetty, Guren, Manoli, and Weber\n(2012) find a steady-state elasticity at the extensive margin of 0.25, with estimates ranging from\n0.13 to 0.43. The authors also survey four macro studies that exploit cross-country variation in\ntax rates to estimate labor supply elasticities and find a mean steady-state elasticity of 0.17.\nThis is very close to the long-run labor supply elasticity implied by our calibration of e0.\nFurthermore, we obtain a propensity to migrate 1/a of 0.065. This parameter implies that\nconditional migration costs \u00af\nt = E[| < c\nt\n], which correspond to the average migration costs\nof those workers who actually move between regions, are equal to 10.4% of annual steady-state\nwage income when measured at the time of the expellee inflow. Lkhagvasuren (2012) reports\nvery similar moving costs equal to one-tenth of annual labor income. He obtains this value by\ntargeting the gross mobility rate in US regional data in a multi-location migration model. Bayer\nand Juessen (2012) report higher costs of moving between US states of around two-thirds of an\naverage annual household income.\nFinally, we obtain a propensity of firms not to adjust employment 2 of 5.06. This parameter\ndetermines the elasticity of average costs per worker to (non-infinitesimal) deviations of the\nhiring rate qtt from its steady-state value .25 This elasticity is equal to 1.43. We can use\nthe value of this elasticity to back out the degree of cost convexity implied by our calibration\nfor the alternative cost function 0(qtt/)3 , which is often estimated in related work.26 This\napproach yields a value for the degree of convexity of the alternative cost function, 3, equal to\n1.39. Mumtaz and Zanetti (2015) derive a DSGE model with EACs that depend on the hiring\nrate and estimate a degree of cost convexity of 1.16, which is close to the value implied by\nour calibration. Overall, therefore, our three calibrated propensity parameters are in line with\nexisting estimates in the literature.\n5.4 Model fit of targeted and non-targeted moments\nFigure 7 compares the historical data, which we target to calibrate the three propensity pa-\nrameters, to the adjustment paths implied by the calibrated model. The figure shows that the\ncalibrated model fits the historical data remarkably well, both qualitatively and quantitatively,\neven though we use only three parameters to optimize fit.\n, we obtain that the elasticity (Ct/Nt-C/N)/(C/N)\n(qtt-)/\n(qtt-)/\nand thus, for a\ngiven change in the hiring rate, is indeed determined by 2\n.\n26 The elasticity is [(qt\nt\nt\n- )/] and, hence, determined by 3\n(for a given change in the hiring\nrate).\nFigure 7: Model fit of targeted moments\nA.

Relative GDP per capita\nNotes: The figure compares the historical data (blue dashed line) to the adjustment paths predicted by our\ncalibrated model (red solid line). See Section 5.4 for further explanation.\nIn particular, the model fits the initial magnitude and persistent decline of the historical av-\nerage unemployment rate (Panel A). Unemployment increases because expellees arrive in either\nregion without a job, and unemployment remains persistently high because expellees and unem-\nployed native workers only gradually move into employment. The persistence of unemployment\nimplied by the model depends, in particular, on firms' propensity not to adjust employment 2.\nThe model also fits the large discouraged worker effect (Panel B), which reduces the historical\nlabor force participation rate to roughly 95% of its (calibrated) equilibrium rate. Labor force\nparticipation is slightly less persistent than the unemployment rate, again in line with the\nhistorical data. The evolution of labor market participation in the model depends to a large\ndegree on workers' propensity to participate e0.\nFurthermore, the model captures the gradual decline in relative population of region H to L\nafter the expellee inflow (Panel C). Relative population declines because non-employed workers,\nmotivated by higher wages and job-finding rates in region L, migrate from region H to L. Ongoing\nmigration along with faster capital accumulation in region H first attenuates regional differences\nin wages and job-finding rates, and eventually eliminates migration incentives altogether.\nThe model also explains the quintessence of relative GDP per capita dynamics (Panel D).\nUpon impact, relative GDP per capita in region H decreases sharply as unemployment soars,\nand then slowly reverts to its pre-inflow level. Figure 7 shows, however, that the model tends to\noverestimate both relative population and relative GDP per capita in region H during transition.\nThe model fit of both time series depends on workers' propensity to migrate 1/a. While a higher\npropensity improves the model's fit of relative population by increasing regional migration, it\nworsens the fit of the catch-up process in relative GDP per capita. We return to this point in\nour robustness checks in Section 6.3.\nFigure 8 evaluates the model fit of the historical time series that we did not target to\ncalibrate the propensity parameters. Evidently, the calibrated model fits the initial magnitude\nand persistent decline of both regional unemployment rates remarkably well (Panels A and B).\nThe good fit of the regional dimension of the data is reassuring, given that this dimension takes\ncenter stage in our subsequent analysis. The model also portrays the relative native population\nremarkably well (Panel C). Again, this is reassuring since, below, we are mainly interested in\nthe effects of the expellee inflow on labor market adjustments of native inhabitants.\nThe model also replicates the decline in the relative population of expellees qualitatively,\nbut it falls short of replicating this decline quantitatively (Panel D in Figure 8). Effectively, as\nshown in Panel C of Figure 7, the model overestimates total relative population after the mid-\n1950s because it predicts too little regional migration of expellees for that period. Improving\nthe model's fit of relative expellee population without compromising the fit of relative native\npopulation would require a more elaborate model, say one with differences in migration costs\nbetween native inhabitants and expellees. In our model, expellees are more likely to migrate\nthan native inhabitants, because expellees are more likely to be unemployed at the beginning of\nthe adjustment process.27\n27 How strongly these different initial conditions of native inhabitants versus expellees affect the migration rate\nof each group depends on the propensity to migrate 1/a. A small propensity to migrate, for instance, downplays\nthe role of different initial conditions, because it implies that many of those who are initially unemployed in region\nH do not migrate.\nFigure 8: Model fit of non-targeted moments\nA.

Due to data availability, Panels C and D only show the\n6 Main results on the labor market effects of the expellee inflow\nWe have shown that the calibrated model explains the empirical facts surprisingly well. In this\nsection, we use this model to address our two research questions. Subsection 6.1 discusses how\nquickly and by what margins regions H and L adjust to the expellee inflow, and Subsection 6.2\nquantifies the effect of the inflow on native labor income. Finally, Subsection 6.3 shows that our\nmain results are robust to various changes in the model calibration.\n6.1 Margins of labor market adjustment\nThis subsection shows that regional migration is an important margin through which regional\nlabor markets adjust to the expellee inflow. We find that almost a third of the initial increase of\nthe population in the high-inflow region H is eventually absorbed through migration to the low-\ninflow region L. This finding contrasts with conclusions from parts of the migration literature\nthat do not ascribe a major role to regional migration as an adjustment margin. We also show\nthat the adjustment processes of native inhabitants and expellees differ dramatically from each\nother because the two groups start from different labor market states.\nWe consider employment, unemployment, non-participation, and regional net migration as\nthe adjustment margins in the labor market and measure the relative contribution of a margin\nby tracing out how the expellee inflow affects this margin in the course of time. Recall that\npopulation in region H evolves as Pt = Pt-1 + Xt + Gt\n- Gt. Combining this equation with the\nidentity Pt = Nt + Ut + Rt and taking first differences yields\nXt = Nt + Ut + Rt + Gt\n- Gt\nwhere  denotes the difference operator, i.e., Nt = Nt\n- Nt-1. Equation (20) shows that the\nexpellee inflow Xt into region H can be decomposed into changes in employment Nt of both\nnative workers and expellees, unemployment Ut, non-participation Rt, and into net migration\nGt\n- Gt\n.\nCumulating equation (20) over the time horizon T yields T\nXt = T\n(Nt + Ut +\nRt +Gt\n-Gt\n). After simplifying this equation and dividing it by the cumulative expellee inflow\n(which reduces to X0 as long as expellees enter only in period zero), we obtain\nNT\n+\nUT\n+\nRT\n+\nT\n(Gt\n- Gt\n)\nThis decomposition expresses the cumulative change in employment, unemployment, non-\nparticipation and net migration between the time period before the inflow and period T relative\nto the overall expellee inflow. Therefore, the decomposition measures the relative contribution\nof each margin and adds up to one.\nWe can learn more about the economic adjustment mechanisms by splitting decomposition\n(21) into one decomposition for the native population and another decomposition for expellees.\nComputing the decomposition for the native population yields:\nNNT\n+\nUNT\n+\nRNT\n+\nT\n(GNt\n- GNt\n)\nHere, each margin refers to native workers only. NNT , for instance, denotes native employment\nat time T. Since the native population experiences no exogenous inflow, the four adjustment\nmargins on the right-hand side of equation (22) add up to zero. We obtain the decomposition\nfor expellees by subtracting the decomposition for the native population (22) from decomposi-\nFurthermore, we express each decomposition relative to its corresponding decomposition in\na counterfactual scenario, in which we set the expellee inflow to zero. This isolates the effects\nof the expellee inflow from the effects of the war-related damage of regional capital stocks.\nAccordingly, in the counterfactual scenario we ignore the expellee inflow shock and compute\nthe model's adjustment dynamics that would have emerged had the economy been hit by the\ndestruction of regional capital stocks only.\nFigure 9 shows, separately for region H and L, the relative contribution of each adjustment\nmargin in the overall population (Panels A and B), the native population (Panels C and D),\nand the expellee population (Panels E and F). Relative contributions are shown for each time\nhorizon T from the time of the expellee inflow until 1965.\nThree main findings emerge from the decompositions. First, the unemployment and non-\nparticipation margins dominate the adjustment process for the overall population in the early\nyears after the shock, whereas the employment and migration margins dominate this process in\nlater years. This is true for each region (see Panel A for region H and Panel B for region L). In\nlater years, the contribution of the migration margin is sizable. At the end of the adjustment\nprocess, migration has contributed about one-third to the cumulative labor market adjustment\nof region H.\nSecond, it takes regional labor markets at least a decade to approach the new steady state.\nEssentially, the adjustment of the unemployment margin to the expellee inflow was completed\nafter ten years in region H and after 11.5 years in region L, i.e., when 90% of the gap between\nunemployment at the time of the inflow and unemployment in the terminal steady state has\nbeen closed. The adjustment process takes longer in region L, because the ongoing migration\nfrom H to L constitutes another, endogenous, inflow into unemployment in region L.\nThird, the adjustment process of native workers differs quite dramatically from the process\nof expellees (compare Panels C and E for region H and Panels D and F for region L). The\nreason for the markedly different adjustment processes of native workers and expellees is that\nboth groups start from very different initial labor market states. While most native workers are\ninitially employed, all expellees are initially non-employed. Our results show that the different\nFigure 9: Cumulative contribution of adjustment margins over time, regions, and worker types\nA. Expellees and natives in region H\nC. Natives in region H\nE.

Each decomposition is expressed relative to the corresponding decomposition in a counterfactual\nscenario, in which we set the expellee inflow to zero. See Section 6.1 for further explanation.\ninitial conditions are crucial in shaping the labor market experiences of the two groups in the\nwake of the shock.\nIn particular, native employment decreases in each region at the beginning of the adjustment\nprocess, with job separations of native workers outnumbering new matches in the first few\nquarters after the shock (see Panels C and D). Native employment in region H reaches a minimum\nnine quarters after the shock. When measured at that time, 4.65 native workers lose their job for\nany ten expellees who arrive in region H. This minimum employment effect is robust to various\nmodifications in our model calibration (see Section 6.3). Of the 4.65 native workers who lose\ntheir job, 1.59 leave the labor force, 2.23 enter the unemployment pool and 0.83 leave region\nH for region L.28 The unemployment rate of native workers equals 9.51%. The large negative\nemployment effect that we find is broadly consistent with recent evidence in Glitz (2012). He\nstudies the immigration of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union\nto Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall and finds that in the short run, 3.1 native workers\nlose their jobs for every ten immigrants that find employment.\nFurthermore, four years after the expellee inflow, migration accounts for one-third of the\ndecrease in region H's native employment, and after 15 years it accounts for the entire decrease.\nThe migration margin dominates the unemployment and non-participation margins after six\nyears. At the end of the adjustment process, 1.75 native workers have left region H for any ten\nexpellees who arrive.\nNative migrants expand the labor market in region L (see Panel D). Since native migrants\narrive without a job, they initially add to the unemployment and non-participation pools.29 Over\ntime, however, native migrants find jobs and eventually increase native employment in region\nL, whereas native employment in region H falls permanently.\nIn contrast to the native population, expellees are gradually absorbed into employment,\nwith their inflows into employment exceeding their outflows from employment over the entire\nadjustment path (see Panels E and F). This process is faster in region L than in region H\nbecause the job-finding rate remains higher in the low-inflow region L. Two years after the\nshock, expellee employment already stands at 101% in region L but at only 69% in region H\n(relative to the regional expellee inflow). Migration plays a relatively small, but non-trivial, role\nin the adjustment process of expellees.\n28 Native workers in our model adjust to the expellee inflow in a way that closely resembles the adjustment\nthat the literature on how regional labor markets adjust to local labor demand shocks predicts in the wake of a\nnegative demand shock (see, for example, Blanchard and Katz (1992), Decressin and Fatas (1995), Lkhagvasuren\n(2012), Dao, Furceri, and Loungani (2014), and Beyer and Smets (forthcoming)). The literature on labor demand\nshocks focuses on region-specific shocks. Our historical shock, in contrast, hits both regions, although to a very\ndifferent degree, and thus convolutes aggregate and region-specific components. In additional unreported work,\nwe thus decompose the historical shock in a common and a region-specific component and quantify the relative\ncontribution of the adjustment margins for the region-specific component. The decomposition, which can be\nobtained upon request, supports our conclusion: Native workers adjust to the region-specific component of the\nexpellee inflow in a way that closely resembles the labor market adjustments after a negative labor demand\nshock. In general, our results add to the results in the literature on labor demand shocks, because our strategy\nfor identifying the role of regional migration combines a natural experiment with dynamic search and matching\ntheory and therefore differs from the predominant strategy in this literature, which relies on imposing exogeneity\nassumptions in time-series VAR models.\n29Panels C and D in Figure 9 show that the maximum decline in native employment is slightly larger in region\nL than region H when denominated by the initial regional expellee inflow. Alternatively, we can denominate the\nsame cumulative change in regional native employment by the regional native population before the expellee\ninflow. This alternative denomination implies that out of one hundred native workers who lived in region H before\nthe shock, 15.60 lose their job nine quarters after the shock. The corresponding statistic for region L is much\nsmaller and equals 7.18 native workers.\nThe adjustment of expellees qualitatively resembles the adjustment of the overall population.\nHowever, relative to the overall population, expellees adjust much more via employment rather\nthan migration. Native adjustment makes up for this difference between expellees and the overall\npopulation. That is, out of those native workers who lose their job in the wake of the expellee\ninflow, migration is the predominant margin in the long run (see Panel C).\n6.2 The effects of the expellee inflow on native labor income\nWe have shown that native workers experience an increased probability of non-participation and\nunemployment along the adjustment path, and respond to the expellee inflow by moving from\nregion H to L. These adjustment processes affect natives' expected lifetime labor income, and\nquantifying this income effect is the focus of this subsection.30 We dissect the overall income\neffect by income type and by a worker's initial labor market status, and also compute the income\neffect for each point in time along the adjustment path. Therefore, we significantly extend the\nexisting literature that mainly focuses on the effect of immigration on native workers' wage\nincome at a given point in time.\nWe find that the expellee inflow reduces expected discounted lifetime income of native workers\nby modest 1.38%, despite the large and long-lasting adjustment processes described in Section\n6.1. However, per-period income effects in the first years after the expellee inflow are up to\nfour times larger than the overall effect on lifetime income. We also find that in region H, the\ndecrease in lifetime wage income is more than twice as high as the decrease in overall lifetime\nlabor income. Workers mitigate this loss in wage income by drawing upon other types of income\nsuch as unemployment or home benefits. Furthermore, we show that income losses are largest\nfor native workers who are non-employed in region H at the time of the expellee inflow.\n6.2.1 Overall treatment effect on expected discounted lifetime income\nTable 5 reports the treatment effects of the expellee inflow on the expected discounted lifetime\nincome (EDI) of native workers. The treatment effect, T0, is the percentage difference between\na worker's EDI in the historical scenario, Z0, and her EDI in a counterfactual scenario without\n30 In our partial equilibrium model, we implicitly divide a household into workers, consumers and shareholders\nand focus our analysis on workers, but not on consumers or shareholders. Accordingly, our analysis is silent about\nwho owns what share of the economy-wide capital stock and, hence, about the effects of the expellee inflow on\ncapital income.\nexpellee inflow, Z0, at the time of the shock:\nIn both the historical and the counterfactual scenario, the economy starts from a capital stock\nbelow the steady state to account for war damage.\nZ0 denotes a generic income measure that depends on a worker's labor market state at the\ntime of the shock. For instance, the EDI of a native worker employed in region H equals the\nvalue of employment W0 in region H (see equation (12)), so that Z0 = W0 in this case. Since\na worker can be in one of six different states (employed, unemployed, or non-participating in\nregion H or region L), we also compute six worker-specific treatment effects in Table 5.\nWe augment worker-specific treatment effects by the treatment effect for the average native\nworker in region H, the average native worker in region L, and the average native worker in\nboth regions. The EDI of the average native worker in region H, denoted by ZNt, weighs the\nvalue of working by the (regional) share of natives who are employed, (LNt\n- UNt)/PNt; the\nvalue of unemployment by the share of natives who are unemployed, UNt/PNt; the value of\nnon-participation by the share of native workers who are non-participating, (1 - LNt/PNt); and\nmigration costs, \u00af\nt, by the native migration rate, GNt/PNt:\nZNt =\nWt +\nHt(\u00af\nht) -\n\u00af\nWe compute a corresponding measure, ZNt\n, for the average native worker in region L. The EDI\nof the average native worker in both regions weighs ZNt and ZNt\nby their population shares:\nZNt = (PNtZNt + PNt\n)/(PNt + PNt\nThe first main result in Table 5 is that the expellee inflow reduces the EDI of the average\nnative worker by 1.38%. This value is robust to various modifications in our model calibration\n(see Section 6.3). Also, this value has no equivalent in the existing literature on immigration,\nsince the literature generally focuses on per-period income effects, which we consider below. The\nsecond main result in the table is that the magnitude of income losses varies significantly with a\nworker's initial location (region H or region L) and labor market status (employed, unemployed,\nor non-participating).\nIncome losses are 45.4% larger for the average native worker in region H than for the average\nTable 5: Treatment effect on expected discounted lifetime income of native workers\nRegion H Region L\nTreatment Treatment\nWorker type Income effect (in %) Income effect (in %)\nAverage ZN\nAverage in both regions, ZN\nNotes: The treatment effect is defined in equation (23) and described in Section 6.2.1. We distinguish\nnative workers by their labor market status and their location at the time of the shock.\nworker in region L (1.73% compared with 1.19%). Interestingly, regional income losses are much\nmore similar to each other than regional expellee inflow rates, which differ by more than 100%.\nThis is because the asymmetric shock triggers migration from region H to region L, which\nthen diffuses the income effect of the asymmetric shock across regions. Nevertheless, regional\nmigration is not large enough to fully equalize income effects across regions. Positive migration\ncosts, in particular, prevent larger migration flows.\nFurthermore, income losses in both regions are almost 40% higher for workers who are\nunemployed at the time of the shock rather than employed (2.33% compared with 1.69% in region\nH, and 1.57% compared with 1.16% in region L). This is because the expellee inflow decreases\njob-finding rates and hence the re-employment probability of unemployed native workers. In\ncontrast, employed natives only suffer from lower job-finding rates if they lose their jobs in later\nperiods.\n6.2.2 Per-period and cumulative treatment effect\nWe analyze how income losses evolve over time by decomposing the overall treatment effect in\nthe EDI of the average native worker in both regions, ZNt, from Table 5 in two ways. The first\ndecomposition is the per-period treatment effect and shows in which period the treatment effect\nis largest (in absolute terms); the second decomposition is the cumulative treatment effect and\nshows how long it takes for the overall treatment effect to be realized.\nWe denote the per-period treatment effect in period t by PT t and define it as the difference\nbetween period t income in the historical scenario, Zt\n- Zt+1, and period t income in the\nFigure 10: Treatment effects over time\nA. Per-period treatment effect\nB. Cumulative over total treatment effect\nNotes: The figure depicts the per-period treatment effect (Panel A) and the cumulative overall treatment\neffect in expected discounted lifetime income (Panel B) of the average native worker. See Section 6.2.2 for\nfurther explanation.\ncounterfactual scenario, Zt\n- Zt+1, expressed in terms of the average counterfactual income:\n[Zt\n- Zt+1] - [Zt\n.\nPanel A in Figure 10 shows that the per-period treatment effect in ZNt evolves non-\nmonotonically over time. On impact, the expellee inflow reduces historical per-period income of\nthe average native worker in both regions by 3.28% relative to counterfactual income. As more\nand more native workers become unemployed or leave the labor force over time (see Section\n6.1 for the labor market dynamics of native workers), the per-period treatment effect declines\neven further, reaching a minimum value of -5.34% in nine quarters after the shock, and slowly\ndissolving thereafter. The large (in absolute terms) per-period treatment effects in the early\nyears after the expellee inflow are consistent with the considerably smaller overall treatment\neffect, since the latter averages the discounted per-period effects over a worker's lifetime, i.e.,\nSince it takes more than a decade for per-period treatment effects to vanish, it also takes\na long time for the overall treatment effect to be realized fully. We summarize this speed of\nadjustment in a cumulative treatment effect for the average native worker in both regions. This\ncumulative treatment effect corresponds to the overall treatment effect truncated at date t,\nTruncation implies that historical and counterfactual income are compared up to date t only and\nthat CT t approaches the overall treatment effect T0 as t becomes large. The ratio of cumulative\nto overall treatment effect, CT t/T0, then yields the fraction of the overall treatment effect that\nis realized over a certain time horizon of the adjustment process, say within the first five years.\nPanel B in Figure 10 plots CT t/T0 for the income of the average native worker, and shows\nthat the overall treatment effect builds up only very gradually over time. Five years after the\nexpellee inflow, the cumulative treatment effect still amounts to less than two-thirds of the overall\ntreatment effect, and it takes another ten years for the remaining effect to be fully realized. This\nresult shows that per-period income has to be analyzed over a long period of time in order to\nobtain a full picture of the overall income effect of the expellee inflow.\n6.2.3 Contribution of income types to the treatment effect\nWorkers receive their overall income from various income types, such as regional wages, unem-\nployment benefits and home benefits. Accordingly, another decomposition of the overall treat-\nment effect isolates the contribution of each income type to the overall effect.\nTo obtain this decomposition, we derive the analytical result that the EDI of the average\nnative worker in both regions, ZNt in equation (25), has a \"direct form\" that shows the contri-\nbution of each income type to overall income:\n\nt\nPNt + P\nNt\nwt +\n\u00af\nht\n-\n\u00af\nt\n+\nPNt + P\nNt\nP\nNt\nwt\n+\nP\nNt\nP\nNt\n\u00af\nht\n-\nP\nNt\n\u00af\nt\nAccording to equation (26), the EDI of the average native worker ZN0 is an infinite weighted\nsum of wages wt and wt\n, unemployment benefits z and z , average home benefits \u00af\nht and \u00af\nht\n, and\nmigration costs. In each period t, weights on all income types (ignoring weights on migration\ncosts) sum to unity. They can thus be interpreted as the unconditional likelihood of the average\nnative worker receiving a particular income type at time t. The direct form equation allows us to\ncompute the contribution of one specific income type, say, wage income, to the overall treatment\neffect as the difference in expected discounted lifetime wage income between the historical and\nthe counterfactual scenarios as a percentage of the overall treatment effect.\nTable 6 shows this decomposition. A striking result in this table is that the decline in ex-\npected lifetime wage income in region H amounts to 220% of the overall decline in native income.\nExpected wage income in region H decreases for two reasons. First, wages decrease temporarily\nTable 6: Decomposition of the treatment effect in native income\nContribution (in %) to treatment effect\nRegion H Region L Both regions\nNotes: The table shows how different income components contribute to the\noverall treatment effect in EDI of the average native worker in both regions\n. The contribution of, say, wage income in region H to this overall treatment\nt(w\nt\nwt\n-w\nt\nwt\n), denoting by w\nt\nthe per-period\nweight attached to wages, w\nt\n= NNt\n/(PNt\n+ PNt\n), and by ZN0\nincome at\nthe time of the shock. Variables without tilde refer to the historical scenario,\nand variables with tilde refer to the counterfactual scenario without expellee\ninflow. Contributions of other income types are computed correspondingly. All\ncontributions are expressed relative to the overall treatment effect. See Section\n6.2.3 for further explanation.\nin region H. Second, the likelihood of the average native worker being employed in region H\ndecreases as well, because of migration to region L and because of temporarily higher unemploy-\nment and non-participation rates. Therefore, as shown in the table, the large decline in wage\nincome in region H is partly offset by the other income types available to workers, namely by\nunemployment benefits, home benefits and wage income in region L.\nWhile we focus on the income effect of immigration, the literature often focuses on the\nwage elasticity of immigration. The wage elasticity in our model, computed as (d log(wt) -\nd log(wt))/d log(Pt), equals -0.12 and -0.16 in region H and L, respectively, when measured at\nthe time of the shock. The elasticity decreases slightly in the first few quarters after the shock and\ngradually approaches zero thereafter. Our short-run wage elasticities are slightly lower than most\nestimates in the literature and thus imply larger wage effects of immigration. In fact, Friedberg\nand Hunt (1995) and Kerr and Kerr (2011) report that most studies find wage elasticities of\n-0.1 or higher. However, Borjas (2003) finds much higher wage effects of immigration, pointing\nto a wage elasticity of between -0.3 and -0.4. Either way, our analysis highlights the fact that\nestimates of the wage elasticity generally depend on the time elapsed since immigration.\n6.3 Robustness checks\nThis section tests how plausible changes to our baseline calibration affect the model fit, the values\nof propensity parameters, and the effects of the expellee inflow on native income and employment\n(as discussed in the previous two subsections). The robustness checks focus, in particular, on\npre-existing differences between regions H and L that we have not incorporated in our baseline\ncalibration. Robustness checks show that changes to our baseline calibration can slightly improve\nthe model fit but typically have no marked effect on calibrated propensity parameters and also\nhave no income and employment effects. If anything, we find that the adverse effects on native\nincome and employment in our baseline calibration are conservative estimates.\nWe conduct five robustness checks and report for each check our distance measure of model\nfit, the calibrated propensity parameters, the treatment effect on native income (in %), and\nthe minimum effect on native employment in region H along the adjustment path (for any ten\nexpellees who arrive in region H). All statistics are in Table 7, along with the initial conditions\non regional capital stocks and productivity (the first panel recalls the corresponding results for\nthe baseline calibration).\nA. Asymmetric initial capital stocks. Our baseline calibration abstracts from regional\ndifferences in war-related damage to the capital stock. However, such differences might provide\nan alternative explanation, other than asymmetric expellee inflows, for the regional adjustment\ndynamics observed historically. Robustness check A., therefore, accounts for regional differences\nin war damage, and sets initial regional capital stocks in region H and L to 88% and 77% of\ntheir steady-state values, respectively.31\nAsymmetric initial capital stocks worsen model fit (see Panel A. of Table 7). Since region H\nsuffered less from damage than region L (see Section 3), regional differences in war damage\nincrease ceteris paribus relative GDP per capita in region H and generate regional migration\nfrom L to H. This is at odds with the empirical facts, such as migration from region H to region L,\nhence making it more difficult for the model to fit the data. Importantly, regional differences\nin capital destruction reduce the effects of expellees on native income and employment only\nmarginally.\n31We calculate these initial regional capital stocks by using the fact that damage d of the nationwide capital\nstock is a weighted sum of damage of regional capital stocks, i.e., d(K + K ) = dH\n+ dL\n. We transform\nthis equation into per capita terms and solve it for dH\nusing the observation that dL\n, which follows from\nthe historical data on regional war damage in Table 2. This yields dH\n). Our\nTable 7: Robustness checks\nInitial conditions Model Calibrated propensity Model\nand shocks1 fit2 parameters3 predictions4\nNotes: The table shows the effects of various changes in the baseline calibration on the model fit and the calibrated propensity parameters. The table\nalso shows the effects of the expellee inflow on native income and employment. Each robustness check changes the baseline calibration in one dimension,\nkeeping all other parameters at the baseline values discussed in Section 5. 1 Initial condition k-1\ndenotes the capital stock per capita before\nthe expellee inflow, and k = K /P denotes the steady-state level of the capital stock per capita.2 The distance of targeted moments D compares the\nmodel's simulated adjustment path in response to the expellee inflow to the historical time series on relative population, the average unemployment rate,\naverage labor force participation, and relative GDP per capita (see Section 5). 3 Propensity parameters are workers' propensity to migrate 1/a, workers'\npropensity to participate in the labor market e0\n, and firms' reluctance to adjust employment 2\n. 4 Treatment effect TN0\ndenotes the percentage change\nin the expected discounted income of the average native worker as a result of the expellee inflow (see Section 6.2.1). min NN\ndenotes the minimum effect\nof the expellee inflow along the adjustment path on native employment in region H (for any ten expellees who arrive in region H).\nB. Regional productivity gap. Our baseline calibration also abstracts from regional pro-\nductivity differences. However, catch-up in productivity between regions H and L might be a\nplausible alternative explanation for the catch-up in GDP per capita that we observe in the\ndata. Robustness check B., therefore, mimics productivity catch-up in the model by introducing\na time-varying productivity shock At in region H, keeping productivity A in region L constant.\nUnfortunately, reliable regional productivity data are unavailable for the historical time\nperiod but have to be inferred under strong assumptions (which is why we do not consider\nproductivity differences in the baseline calibration). We use data reported in Waidlein (2013)\nand set the initial value of the productivity shock equal to the gap in total factor productivity\ninitial productivity in region H is 5.2% lower than in region L. We assume that this gap closes\nRegional productivity catch-up significantly increases model fit (see Panel B. of Table 7), be-\ncause the negative productivity shock in region H constitutes another \u00ad and relatively persistent\n\u00ad motive for regional migration. Therefore, relative population declines more strongerly and thus\nmoves closer to the data than in the baseline calibration. The migration propensity declines sig-\nnificantly from 0.065 to 0.037, since a lower migration propensity is now sufficient for the model\nto match the regional migration data. The effect on native income decreases from -1.38% to\n-1.75%, because productivity in region H is now temporarily lower than in the baseline. Firms\nin this region thus pay lower wages and have less incentive to hire new workers.\nC. Alternative data classification. Robustness checks A. and B. directly incorporate re-\ngional differences into the model. Robustness check C., in contrast, maintains the symmetry as-\nsumption of the baseline calibration but uses an alternative data classification of federal states.\nThis alternative classification levels out pre-existing differences in both the degree of industri-\nalization and in war damage. It excludes Bremen, Hamburg and North Rhine-Westphalia from\nregion L, as these three states are responsible for the observed pre-existing differences between\nregions H and L (see Table 2). Appendix A.2 documents the empirical facts for the alterna-\ntive classification and shows that they are qualitatively similar to the facts for the baseline\n32Waidlein (2013) reports data on two measures of total factor productivity for German states. We aggregate\nthe data to the level of our regions H and L, using population as weights, and take the average of the two\nmeasures. Given data constraints, exact values should be interpreted cautiously. For instance, Waidlein (2013)\nhas to approximate regional capital stocks from nationwide capital stocks and regional industry employment, as\nthere exists no regional capital data before 1960.\nclassification.\nThe model fit improves considerably if we use the alternative classification of regions (see\nPanel C. of Table 7), and calibrated propensity parameters remain surprisingly close to the\nbaseline calibration. The same is true of the effect of the expellee inflow on native income and\nemployment. The income effect remains virtually unchanged despite the fact that significantly\nfewer native workers migrate endogenously from the high- to the low-inflow region than in the\nbaseline classification (see Appendix A.2 for the details).\nD. Initial capital stock at steady state. Our baseline calibration sets initial regional\ncapital stocks 19% below their steady-state values to account for war-related damage of the\ncapital stock. However, the Nazi era also witnessed massive investment in industrial capacity\nthat partly made up for later war damage. In fact, the magnitudes of investment and war damage\n\u00ad and the degree to which the former out-weighted the latter \u00ad is still debated among economic\nhistorians (Eichengreen and Ritschl 2009, Vony\u00b4\no 2012). Robustness check D., therefore, initializes\ncapital stocks at their steady-state values rather than below them.\nThis change in calibration leads to a slight deterioration in model fit (see Panel D. of Table 7).\nWhile the migration propensity 1/a remains virtually unchanged, participation and employment\nadjustment propensities e0 and 2 increase moderately. When firms maintain a higher capital\nstock, they absorb the expellee inflow faster and therefore unemployment declines relative to\nthe baseline calibration. Lower unemployment also makes it more attractive for workers to\nparticipate in the labor market. The higher propensities e0 and 2 offset both effects. However,\na greater reluctance on the part of firms to adjust employment (higher 2) also increases the\nduration of native non-employment and therefore amplifies the effect on native income and\nemployment.\nE. Discount data on relative GDP per capita. Section 3 pointed out that measuring\npre-war regional GDP per capita is fraught with problems. Robustness check E., therefore, re-\ncalibrates the propensity parameter by discounting the weight of relative GDP per capita in\nthe distance function by 50%. This change in calibration increases the migration propensity 1/a\nfrom 0.065 to 0.080. Recall that in the baseline calibration, further increases in 1/a improve\nthe model's fit of relative population but worsens the fit of relative GDP per capita. Therefore,\nwhen the GDP time series is discounted, a higher 1/a improves overall model fit. The effects of\nthe expellee inflow on native income and employment remain virtually unchanged.\n7 Counterfactual immigration experiments\nMotivated in large part by the policy discussions surrounding Europe's current refugee crisis,\nwe conduct four counterfactual immigration experiments, which explore the predictions of our\nstructural model under different parameter calibrations. First, we reduce the magnitude of the\nexpellee inflow. Second, we vary the initial regional distribution of expellees. Third, we vary\nthe timing of the expellee inflow, and spread it over time. Fourth, we change the propensity\nof workers to migrate between regions. The counterfactual experiments suggests that economic\npolicies that change the nature of the immigrant inflow can have important consequences for the\nmagnitude of native income losses and labor market adjustments but are unlikely to markedly\nspeed up the adjustment process.\nA. Counterfactual magnitude of expellee inflow. The first counterfactual experiment\nreduces the overall expellee inflow rate from its historical 16.3% to a counterfactual 3.2% or\n1.3%. The 1.3% inflow rate corresponds to the inflow rate of refugees to Germany in 2015, and\nthe 3.2% inflow rate corresponds to the sum of the inflow rate of non-refugees in 2014 and the\ninflow rate of refugees in 2015 (the inflow rate of non-refugees for 2015 is not yet available). The\nexperiment only varies the overall magnitude of the expellee inflow; the regional distribution of\nthe expellee inflow remains the historical distribution. The results are in Panel A. of Table 8\n(the first panel recalls the corresponding results for the historical scenario).\nLower inflow rates are associated with lower income losses, since in our model immigration\nhas unambiguously negative effects on the income of native workers. The income loss of the\naverage native worker in both regions, as measured by the overall treatment effect on the EDI,\n)\nfrom 16.3% to 3.2% (see column (1)). The overall income loss decreases further to 0.12% when\nwe decrease the inflow rate to 1.3%. In fact, the relationship between the magnitude of the\nexpellee inflow rate and native lifetime income losses is approximately linear.\nLower inflow rates increase expellee income more than native income (compare columns (1)\nand (4)), because expellees are initially non-employed and, therefore, compete directly with other\nexpellees. We measure the effect on expellee income by the percentage difference between the\nEDI of the average expellee and the EDI of the average native in the case without any expellees.\nThe counterfactual experiment also shows that reducing expellee inflow rates amplifies re-\ngional differences in native income losses (see columns (2) and (3)). In the historical scenario,\nthe income loss of the average native worker is 45.4% higher in region H than in region L. This\nrespectively. Intuitively, lower inflow rates reduce the value of workers migrating from region H\nto L but do not affect migration costs. As a consequence, regional migration flows, as measured\nby cumulative net migration over the total expellee inflow into region H, decrease (column (10)),\nand regional differences in the overall treatment effect become more important.\nFinally, lower expellee inflow rates also reduce minimum per-period income losses (columns\n(6) and (7)) and average unemployment rates in the first ten years of adjustment (columns\n(8) and (9)). However, even with lower inflow rates, the adjustment process of regional labor\nmarkets takes time. The duration of adjustment, as measured by the number of quarters that\nit takes for 90% of the overall treatment effect to be realized, decreases only modestly from 35\nto 28 quarters when the inflow rate falls from 16.3% to 3.2%. This finding suggests that even at\nmore modest levels of immigration, researchers need to analyze a relatively long time period to\nobtain a complete picture of the overall effect of immigration.\nB. Counterfactual initial regional distribution of expellees. Counterfactual B. varies\nthe initial regional distribution of expellees, keeping the overall magnitude of the expellee inflow\nat its historical level. We either distribute all expellees into one region, or distribute expellees so\nthat regional inflow rates, X0/P-1 and X0\n, are identical.33 Identical inflow rates imply that\n) and thus 0.35. In our model, the distribution with equal\ninflow rates mimics today's policy of distributing refugees across German states according to\nlocal population size. Similar distribution quotas are also the subject of animated debate within\nthe European Union.34\nThe results in Panel B. of Table 8 suggest that unequal inflow rates benefit the average\nnative worker at the expense of the average expellee worker. In fact, the income loss of the\naverage native worker in both regions is minimized (at 1.24%) when all expellees are distributed\nto region H (see column (1)), the region with the smaller initial population size. This perhaps\n33We denominate regional inflow rates by P-1\nrather than P0\nto ensure that they are exogenous.\n34In addition to population size, distribution quotas usually take economic indicators into account. The German\nquota, for instance, allocates more refugees to states with higher tax income. However, regions in our model are\nex ante identical in per capita terms. Therefore, economic indicators do not carry additional information for the\ndistribution of expellees in our model, once differences in population size are accounted for.\nsurprising result is due to the fact that with positive migration costs, native inhabitants in region\nL are partly shielded from the expellee inflow to region H. Distributing all expellees to region H,\nin which there are relatively few native inhabitants, maximizes the number of natives shielded\nfrom the negative effects of immigration. The income loss of the average expellee, in contrast,\nis maximized (at -2.81% relative to the average native's EDI in the case without any expellee\ninflow) when all expellees are distributed to region H (column (4)). This is because all expellees\nthen start in the congested labor market of region H with a small probability of finding a job\nquickly.\nThe income loss of the average native worker in both regions is maximized (at 1.41%) when\nexpellees are distributed in proportion to the initial native population in each region. The pro-\nportional distribution of expellees is thus the worst possible distribution from the perspective of\nthe average native worker in our model.35 The income loss of expellees, in contrast, is minimized\n(at 1.99%) in that case. Our results also show that a proportional distribution levels out regional\ndifferences in minimum per-period treatment effects (columns (6) and (7)) and unemployment\ndifferentials (columns (8) and (9)) and thus might be considered a \"fair distribution\".\nPanel B. of Table 8 also shows that we observe the longest duration of adjustment when all\nexpellees are distributed to region H, and the shortest duration when expellees are distributed\nproportionally (column (5)). Distributing all expellees to the less populous region H maximizes\nmigration incentives, and thus increases the magnitude and persistence of regional migration\nflows. In fact, half of the initial increase in the population of region H is eventually absorbed\nthrough migration to region L if all expellees are distributed to region H (column (10)). Regional\nmigration adds to the persistence of the treatment effect in region L \u00ad as more expellees arrive\nin region L in later periods, too \u00ad and hence increases the duration of adjustment.\nC. Gradual inflow of expellees over time. Counterfactual C. explores the effects of a\ngradual inflow of expellees, keeping the overall magnitude and distribution of the inflow at\nhistorical values. That is, instead of considering a one-off inflow, we distribute the expellee inflow\nover either three or ten years so that quarterly inflow rates, Xt/(Pt +Pt\n) and Xt\n/(Pt +Pt\n), are\nconstant over time. Gradual intakes of refugees are common practice in many countries today.\n35Clearly, our partial equilibrium analysis abstracts from a number of channels through which the regional\ndistribution of expellees might affect native income. The extreme initial distribution of expellees, for instance, de-\ncreases the employment probability of expellees and hence increases their dependency on unemployment benefits.\nIn general equilibrium, native workers will have to finance the benefits of unemployed expellees and thus have an\ninterest in high expellee employment. Such interest is absent in our partial equilibrium framework.\nThe UK, for instance, has recently agreed to take in 20,000 Syrian refugees but will spread the\nintake over five years. Likewise, Norway has agreed to accept 8,000 refugees across a three-year\nperiod.\nThe results in Panel C. of Table 8 suggest that a more gradual inflow of expellees markedly\nreduces the income loss of native workers. The income loss decreases by almost 25% when the\nexpellee inflow is distributed over three years, and it more than halves when the expellee inflow\nis distributed over ten years (see column (1)). A more gradual inflow has even stronger income\neffects for expellees, since they suffer most from a congested labor market. The income loss of\nthe average expellee worker decreases by 35% and 62% when the expellee inflow is distributed\nover three and ten years, respectively (column (4)).\nThe counterfactual also shows that a more gradual inflow increases the minimum per-period\ntreatment effect and keeps average unemployment rates down. Distributing the expellee inflow\nover ten years reduces the average unemployment rate in the first ten years of adjustment from\nOverall, the counterfactual suggests that a more gradual inflow of immigrants can effectively\nlimit the negative effects of immigration. Of course, our model does not account for the \u00ad\npotentially large \u00ad costs of delayed entry for immigrants themselves.\nD. Counterfactual migration costs. Counterfactual D. explores the effects of prohibitively\nhigh and very low costs of inter-regional migration. These costs are determined by a, i.e., the\ninverse propensity of workers to migrate. Varying these costs allows us to discern the role of\nlabor mobility in shaping the effects of the expellee inflow, and facilitates the extrapolation of\nour results to settings in which regional labor markets are more or less integrated.\nThe results in Panel D. of Table 8 show that prohibitively high migration costs shield workers\nin region L from the negative income effects of regional migration from region H to L. Therefore,\nthe income loss for the average native worker in region L decreases from 1.19% in the historical\nscenario to 0.94% (column (3)). Conversely, natives in region H suffer from high migration costs,\nas workers are no longer able to evade the poor labor market conditions in region H by moving\nto region L. Consequently, the income loss for the average native worker in region H increases\nTable 8: Counterfactual immigration experiments\nOverall treatment effect on EDI Income of Duration of Minimum per-period treatment Avg. unemployment rate Migration as\nBoth regions Region H Region L (in %) (# quarter) Region H Region L Region H Region L margin4\nA.

Migration costs\nNotes: The table shows the effects on various outcome variables of varying the magnitude of the expellee inflow (Panel A.), the initial regional distribution of the expellee inflow (Panel\nB.), the timing of the expellee inflow (Panel C.) and migration costs (Panel D.). Each counterfactual varies only one parameter at a time, keeping all other parameters at the values\ndescribed in Section 5. 1 The income of the average expellee is the percentage difference between the average expellee's EDI upon arrival and the EDI of the average native in the case\nwithout any expellee inflow. 2 The duration of adjustment is the number of quarters that it takes for 90% of the treatment effect in column (1) to be realized. 3 The minimum per-period\ntreatment effect is the minimum of the per-period treatment effect on native income (as described in Section 6.2.2) over the adjustment path. 4 Migration as an adjustment margin is\ncomputed as cumulative net migration over the total expellee inflow into region H. 5 Not defined (division by zero).\nUnder very low migration costs, in contrast, native income losses in both regions converge to\n1.41%. Workers in region L no longer benefit from a less congested labor market, as unemployed\nworkers in region H can move at no cost and do so instantaneously until migration incentives are\nexhausted. Therefore, the income loss for the average native worker in both regions is slightly\nhigher for very low migration costs than for prohibitively high migration costs (1.41% vs. 1.36%).\nExpellees, however, benefit from lower migration costs, because their costs of bypassing the\ncongested labor market in region H fall. These findings mirror our conclusion from counterfactual\nexperiment B., i.e., shielding native workers in the low-inflow region L is beneficial for the average\nnative worker but detrimental for the average expellee.\n8 Discussion and conclusion\nThis paper has analyzed how regional labor markets in West Germany adjusted over a period\nof more than two decades to the inflow of eight million expellees after World War II. Three\nkey findings emerge. First, it took regional labor markets more than one decade to absorb the\nexpellee inflow. Second, the adjustment process was characterized by large differences in regional\nunemployment rates and strong migration from the high- to the low-inflow region. Third, despite\nthese large and long-lasting adjustment processes, the average native worker experiences only a\nmodest loss in expected discounted lifetime income of 1.38%. Per-period losses in native income,\nhowever, are much larger and can reach up to 5.34% in the short run. Workers who are non-\nemployed at the time of the inflow suffer the greatest losses.\nCounterfactual immigration experiments suggest that economic policy interventions that\nchange the timing, regional distribution and magnitude of immigration can have important\nconsequences for native income losses and adjustment dynamics. We find that a more gradual\ninflow of immigrants significantly reduces the incomes loss of native workers. A more equal\ndistribution of immigrants across regional labor markets, in contrast, benefits immigrants but\nincreases the income loss of the average native worker. The counterfactual experiments also\nsuggests that the adjustment process of regional labor markets takes considerable time even\nunder today's more modest levels of immigration. The duration of adjustment is still seven\nyears if we decrease the expellee inflow rate from its historical rate of 16.5% to 1.3% \u00ad a value\nsimilar to Germany's inflow rate of refugees in 2015.\nOur results shed light on the dynamic labor market effects of one of the largest forced pop-\nulation movements in history. But they also provide several relevant insights for the burgeoning\n\u00ad and largely static \u00ad empirical literature on the labor market effects of immigration. First, the\ntime elapsed since immigration matters greatly for the results of empirical studies on the labor\nmarket effects of immigration. Not only do short-run effects of immigration differ greatly from\nlonger-run effects. The effects can also evolve non-monotonically over time. Therefore, estimated\nshort-run effects of immigration do not generally establish a bound on longer-run effects and\nvice versa.\nSecond, empirical studies that use regional variation in inflow rates to estimate the effects\nof immigration are more likely to obtain biased estimates, the more time has elapsed since\nimmigration. This is because, over time, regional migration will diffuse the effect of immigration\nfrom high- to low-inflow regions. Low-inflow regions are then no longer a valid counterfactual\nfor high-inflow regions. The more unevenly initial inflows are distributed, the greater will be\nthe importance of regional migration as an adjustment mechanism. One way to account for this\ndiffusion effect of regional migration is through a structural model, such as the one developed\nin this paper.\nThird, estimated effects on wage income will, in general, exceed the overall income effects of\nimmigration. In our setting, the effects on wage income are actually twice as large as the effects\non overall income. This is because workers resort to other income sources outside the labor\nmarket in response to deteriorating labor market conditions. This outcome suggests that the\nliterature's focus on wage income is fairly narrow and may benefit from including other income\nsources.\nAt the most general level, our dynamic analysis \u00ad and the large discrepancy between lifetime\nand per-period income effects that we find \u00ad reminds us of the simple fact that any static\nanalysis will necessarily provide no more than an incomplete snapshot of the overall benefits\nand costs of immigration. A deeper understanding of the dynamic effects of immigration is,\ntherefore, essential for informing the in-depths policy debate on immigration. Future research\nin this area might build productively on our theoretical framework, addressing several caveats\nof our analysis.\nFirst, our analysis assumes that there are no long-run effects of immigration on wages and\nproductivity, as we use a \"standard\" constant returns to scale production technology. Clearly,\nthe long-run effects of immigration, and thus also transitional dynamics, may differ under either\nincreasing or decreasing returns to scale. Economies of scale might, for instance, arise from high-\nskilled migration fostering firm innovation and productivity (Kerr, Kerr, and Lincoln 2014).\nSecond, our analysis abstracts from skill differences between native workers and immigrants,\nand thus from potentially important distributional consequences of immigration. This assump-\ntion is justified in our context, where native workers and expellees compete as close substitutes\nalong the entire skill distribution. In contrast, today's migration flows are often concentrated\nin specific parts of the skill distribution, so that skill differences become an essential model\ningredient.\nThird, and related to the two previous points, our framework abstracts from potential positive\neffects of immigration for native workers (though not for native capital owners). Such positive\neffects can arise if, say, natives and immigrants differ in their skills or in their search costs (see,\nfor instance, Chassamboulli and Palivos (2014)). While our goal in this paper was to build the\nmost parsimonious model that can explain the historical data, and our specific historical episode\nallows us to abstract from many differences between immigrants and native workers, some of\nthe simplifications may not be warranted in other settings.\nFourth, our analysis has focused on the relocation of workers, abstracting from the entry\nand exit of firms in response to immigrant inflows (although we allow for capital accumulation).\nDustmann and Glitz (2015) have recently highlighted the importance of this adjustment channel\nin a static framework, and it would be valuable to explore its dynamic implications.\nFifth, expellees and native workers face identical migration costs in our model. Expellees still\nhave a higher probability of migrating from one region to the other in our analysis, as they are\nmore likely to be unemployed at the beginning of the adjustment process. In general, however,\nimmigrants might be more willing to move than native workers because they have fewer social\nand psychological ties in the host country and might thus face lower migration costs than native\ninhabitants. Exploring the effects of differences in migration costs on the adjustment process\nmight, therefore, be a further promising avenue for future research.\nReferences\nAdjemian, S., H. Bastani, F.

The first proxy uses\nnational income data from 1936, but is subject to the limitation that the states of the German\nReich, for which the income data is available, do not correspond to the later West German\nstates. We therefore had to approximate the values for the H and L regions (see footnote 12 for\nthe details).\nThe second proxy uses data on firm sales that come from published sales tax statistics\n(Statistisches Bundesamt 1955a, Statistisches Bundesamt 1955b). Total sales are defined as\ndomestic deliveries and other services of a business for money and own consumption of the\nbusiness. The sales data have two advantages over the national income data. First, comparable\ndata on firm sales exist for both the pre- and the post-war periods (although, unfortunately, only\nuntil 1955). Second, sales data are available at district level and can thus be precisely aggregated\nto the federal state level (and thus also to the level of our two regions). On the downside, sales are\nnot a direct measure of production value, and certain exemptions for businesses with low revenues\napply. However, firm sales per capita correlate strongly with national income per capita.36 The\npre- to post-war changes in relative sales per capita between the two regions gives at least an\nindication of the change in relative GDP per capita. As sales statistics are not available for 1939,\nfor the 19 regions of the German Reich, for which both types of data are available. And for 1950, the correlation\ncoefficient between sales and GDP of the nine West German states is 0.99.\nA.2 Alternative regional data classification\nThis section shows that empirical facts are robust to the use of an alternative classification\nof federal states that levels out pre-existing differences between the high- and the low-inflow\nregion. The alternative classification excludes Bremen, Hamburg, and North Rhine-Westphalia\nfrom region L, as these three states are responsible for the differences in agricultural employment\nand the degree of war damage that we observe for regions H and L (see Table 2).37 In what\nfollows, we will refer to the resulting geographical entity, which consists of Baden-W\u00a8\nurttemberg,\nHesse, and Rhineland-Palatinate, as region L'. We will refer to the excluded states of Bremen,\nHamburg, and North Rhine Westphalia as (L-L') region.38\nTable 2 illustrates that regions H and L' are very similar not only in terms of pre-war\npopulation growth and unemployment but also in terms of agricultural employment and war\ndamage. The agricultural employment share in region L' was only slightly lower than in region\ndamage, was virtually identical in the two regions (12.1% and 12.8%). While regions H and L'\nwere thus similar in their pre-war economic structure and their degree of war damage, region L'\nexperienced a much smaller expellee inflow than region H (12.6% vs. 25.0%). The main problem\nwith using the alternative classification is that it excludes almost one-third of the West German\npopulation.\nFigure A1 shows that the empirical facts presented in Section 3 also prevail, at least quali-\ntatively, when we compare the demographic and economic development of the H region to the\nL' region rather than to the L region. As before, we consider relative population, relative GDP\nper capita, and unemployment rates. On labor force participation, we use the same time series\nas in our baseline classification, since participation data is only available at the national level.\nPanel (a) shows the population size of region H relative to region L' from 1939 to 1970\n(red line). The graph also shows how the relative population size of the two regions would have\nevolved if the only reason for changes in the relative population size was regional migration\n37North Rhine-Westphalia comprises the Ruhr region, Germany's pre-war industrial center. Therefore, only\n14.1% of North Rhine-Westphalia's labor force was in agriculture before the war (compared to a national average\nof 27.0%). North Rhine-Westphalia is not only highly industrialized but also highly urbanized and thus suffered\nover-proportionally from war damage. The same is true for the city states of Bremen and Hamburg, which comprise\nonly urban areas, and had almost no agriculture in 1939.\n38This alternative classification thus divides West Germany into three regions. In our two-region model, we\ntreat migration between regions H and L' as endogenous. To account for net migration flows between region H\nand (L-L'), however, we treat them as exogenous and subsume them into Xt\n. Thus, Xt\ntakes non-zero values also\nafter the expellee inflow in t = 0. Likewise, we subsume flows between regions L' and (L-L') into Xt\n.\nwithin Germany (blue line). The relative population of H to L' increased markedly from 110.8%\ncompletely, reached its pre-inflow value in 1970. Most of the fall in relative population took place\nin the early- to mid-1950s. The blue line shows that inner-German migration is responsible for\nmost of the change in relative population in the 1950s (but not thereafter).\nFigure A1: Empirical facts for region H and region L'\nBasedonnetmigrationonly\nUnemploymentrate,regionH\nUnemploymentrate,regionL'\nSources: Institut f\u00a8\nur Raumforschung, Statistisches Bundesamt, L\u00a8\nanderrat des Amerikanischen Besatzungs-\nur Arbeitsvermittlung und Arbeitslosenversicherung. See the notes on the\ncorresponding Figures in Section 3 for details.\nNotes: The population series in Panel (a), which is based on migration only, is calculated by adding to the\nactual population figure of the H and L' region on 31 December 1949 (cumulated) net migration between the\ntwo regions. The unemployment rate in Panel (c) is expressed as a percentage of the dependent labor force.\nThe unemployment rate of region H in 1938 is approximated by the (labor force-weighted) average of the\n1938 unemployment rates of Bavaria, Lower Saxony, and the Nordmark. The unemployment rate of region L'\nis approximated by the average of the unemployment rates of Hesse and Southwest Germany.\nPanel (b) shows GDP per capita of region H relative to region L' between 1950 and 1970.\nRelative GDP per capita reached a trough in 1952, when GDP per capita in region H reached\n83.3% of the level of region L'. The gap between the two regions then narrowed markedly in\nimprovement in region H's relative GDP per capita. If anything, the gap to region L' widened\nagain. Unfortunately, we do not have a good measure of relative GDP per capita before the war.\nWe can, however, again look at sales per capita between 1935 and 1955 (we discuss the pros and\ncons of using sales per capita as a proxy for production in Appendix A.1). Sales per capita of\nPanel (c) gives the unemployment rates of regions H and L' in 1938 and between 1950 and\n1963. At 1.6%, unemployment rates of the two regions were identical before the war. Both re-\ngions then experienced a drastic increase in unemployment, which, however, was much more\npronounced in H than in L'. In 1950, the unemployment rate was 16.7% in region H but only\n6.8% in region L'. Unemployment then gradually decreased during the 1950s and regional un-\nemployment rates were nearly identical by the beginning of the 1960s.\nOverall, comparing the demographic and economic development of regions H and L' yields\nempirical facts that are very similar to those obtained by comparing region H and L. Nevertheless,\ntwo differences stand out. First, the population of H continues to fall in the 1960s relative to L'\nbut not relative to L. The decline is, however, relatively modest compared to the decline in the\n1950s and due to factors other than inner-German migration. Second, the catch-up in GDP per\ncapita of region H is more pronounced when measured relative to region L than relative to L'.\nThis might partly be due to the fact that the initial gap in GDP per capita between H and L is\nlarger than between H and L'.\nA.3 Calibrating job-filling rates\nThe job-filling rate equals the ratio of job-finding rate over labor market tightness, i.e., q(t) =\nt/t. As data on gross worker flows is not available for the historical time period, we follow\nShimer (2005) and infer the job-finding rate from aggregate data on employment, unemployment\nand short-term unemployment. Let ut be the number of workers unemployed at the end of month\nt (in contrast to the rest of the paper, t refers to a month rather than to a quarter in this\nappendix), and let uN\nt\nbe the number of workers unemployed for less than one month at the\nend of the same month. Finally, let t denote the probability of an unemployed worker finding a\njob during month t. If we further assume that no unemployed worker exits the labor force, the\nunemployment rate evolves according to\nThe job-finding probability t is given by\nut\nUnfortunately, the German Federal Employment Agency does not provide data on short-term\nunemployment for the historical time period. However, it does provide data on total inflows\ninto unemployment during a month, It. When a worker enters the unemployment pool, she has,\non average, half a month to leave the unemployment pool before she is recorded as short-term\nunemployed at the end of the month. The number of short-term unemployed at the end of month\nt can then be approximated by (1 - 0.5t)It, and the job-finding probability can be expressed\nas:\nWe use monthly West German data from July 1950 to December 1970 to calculate the job-finding\nprobability for every month. Data is taken from various issues of the German Federal Employ-\nment Agency's Amtliche Nachrichten. Note that from September 1955 onwards, the employment\nagency records inflows into the pool of job seekers instead of inflows into unemployment. There-\nfore, we use data on job seekers to calculate the job-finding probability for this time period.
