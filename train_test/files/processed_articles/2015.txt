    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Levels of physical activity (PA) in the general population are difficult to characterize. Historically\nmeasurement has been based on self-report, which can be subject to bias. PA monitor use has created\nopportunities to improve surveillance and analytic research on activity and health. The aims of the current study\nwere to investigate the associations between objectively measured PA and cardiovascular disease risk factors and\nobesity.\nMethods: Data on PA from accelerometers, demographics, blood pressure, plasma glucose and lipids, self-reported\nwere assessed as levels of moderate and vigorous activity, percentage of participants meeting recommended\nguidelines, and the correlations between activity and cardiovascular risk factors. Accelerometry data were available\non 3,370 adults. Based on standard algorithms, activity levels were extremely low in all age-gender-race/ethnic\ngroups, with an average of only 1 bout of vigorous activity lasting longer than 1 minute/day.\nResults: Men spent 35 minutes in moderate activity/day, women 21 minutes; >75% of this activity was\naccumulated in 1-minute bouts. Levels of activity declined sharply after age 50 in all groups. Negative associations\nwere observed between minutes of combined moderate and vigorous activity and systolic blood pressure,\nblood glucose, diabetes, hypertension, body mass index and obesity, and a positive association was seen with\nHDL-cholesterol (all P  0.03), suggesting valid rank ordering of participants by activity level.\nConclusion: The magnitude of the gap between self-report and accelerometry activity must be a result of either a\nvast social acceptability bias in reporting or inaccurate measurement with accelerometry. Therefore, due to the low\nvalidity of self reported PA data for epidemiologic research, it is pertinent to encourage the use of valid, objective\nmethods to assess PA.\nBackground\nThe population burden attributable to cardiovascular\ndisease (CVD) has evolved rapidly over the last 50 years.\nVigorous efforts to improve levels of smoking, hyperch-\nolesterolemia and uncontrolled hypertension have con-\ntributed significantly to the 75% reduction in CVD\nin lifestyle continues and several goals for Healthy Peo-\nple 2010 for heart disease and stroke risk factors have\nalready been met [3]. As is well recognized, however,\nsignificant adverse trends in obesity and diabetes have\nemerged and threaten to erode these gains [4]. The new\nurgency attached to the prevention of obesity and its\nsequelae has furthermore heightened interest in poten-\ntial strategies that can limit age-related weight gain [5].\nUnfortunately, despite the relatively straightforward nat-\nure of the energy equation, balancing calorie intake with\nexpenditure has become difficult for large segments of\nthe population in the current obesigenic environment.\nIn an attempt to address the obesity epidemic, consider-\nable emphasis has therefore been placed on surveillance\nof physical activity and the initiation of campaigns to\nenhance leisure activity [6,7]. These strategies depend\non accurate information about patterns and levels of\nenergy expenditure in the general population.\nIn contrast to the \"classic\" CVD risk factors, until\nrecently assessment of physical activity in large popula-\ntion studies has relied on self-reported questionnaires\n* Correspondence: aluke@lumc.edu\n Contributed equally\nDepartment of Preventive Medicine and Epidemiology, Loyola University\n\u00a9 2011 Luke et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Self-report of beha-\nviors such as alcohol intake, diet and physical activity are\nnotoriously unreliable, being subject to both random and\nsystematic reporting bias [10-12]. Development of\nimproved physical activity monitors, i.e., accelerometers,\nhas now made it possible to measure activity patterns\nobjectively in free-living individuals [13-15]. Doubly\nlabeled water (DLW), a non-invasive method of indirect\ncalorimetry [16], has also been applied on a limited scale\nto field research [17,18], however, it remains prohibitively\nexpensive for most large studies, and accelerometers are\nlikely to be the most widespread technique that will be\nused for the foreseeable future.\nan accelerometer for 7 consecutive days. In this analysis\nwe examine the patterns of physical activity in the 3,370\nindividuals between 20 and 65 years with adequate qual-\nity data and non-debilitating illnesses and assess the\nrelationship between activity and CVD risk factors and\nobesity.\nMethods\nlyses. Using a complex, multistage probability sampling\ndesign, NHANES recruited a representative sample of\nthe total civilian non-institutionalized population, 2\nmonths and older, in the United States. Briefly,\nNHANES participants perform an at-home interview\nand, approximately two weeks later, a clinic examination\nat a mobile examination center (MEC). The examination\nlasts approximately 3-4 hours and site-specific error is\nminimized by standardizing all data-collection methods\n[19]. All participants provide informed consent for both\nthe at-home interview and MEC examination and the\nUS Department of Health and Human Service approved\nindividuals were interviewed and examined (all ages). Of\nindividuals wore the activity monitor for a minimum of\n4 valid wear days. There were 1,093 adults excluded for\none of the following reasons: missing BMI data (n = 31),\npregnant at time of examination (n = 240), self-reported\nrace/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic white, non-His-\npanic black or Mexican American (n = 343), or self-\nreported chronic health condition that might have\nimpacted physical activity levels, such as congestive\nheart failure, stroke or emphysema (n = 542). Thus, the\nWeight (kg) and height (m) were measured according\nto standard procedures and used to calculate body mass\nindex (BMI, kg/m2). Brachial SBP and DBP measure-\nments were made during a single examination and\nfollowing standard procedures; the average value for up\nto three measurements was used [20].\nBlood was drawn following an overnight fast and pro-\ncessed according to standard procedures [21]; plasma\nglucose and lipids concentrations were measured.\nPlasma glucose was assessed and triglycerides and HDL-\ncholesterol were measured in serum (Roche Diagnostics,\nIndianapolis, IN), while levels of LDL-cholesterol were\ncalculated using the Friedewald formula [21].\nPhysical activity monitors (Actigraph model 7164;\nActigraph LLC; Fort Walton Beach, FL) were placed on\nall ambulatory participants six years and older [22]. The\nActigraph records vertical accelerations as \"counts\"\nrepresenting the relative intensity of each movement\n[23]. The monitor was worn over the right hip; partici-\npants were asked to wear the monitor while awake and\nremove it for swimming or bathing [15]. Data were\nsummarized in 1-minute epochs for 7 days.\nFor the purpose of our analyses, we included acceler-\nof age, who met our minimum wear time criteria, as\ndescribed below. Each participant was required to\nachieve a minimum of 10 hrs of monitor wear on four\nor more days. Wear time was determined by subtracting\nnon-wear time from 24 hr, while non-wear time was\ndefined as an interval of 60 consecutive minutes with\nzero activity counts allowing for intervals of 1-2 minutes\nThe average number of valid wear days was 5.97 for\nWe defined moderate and vigorous physical activity\ncut-points for adults using previously published recom-\nmendations [24], as described by Troiano [15]. Briefly,\ncut-points allow the conversion of accelerometer counts\ninto estimates of activity intensity, i.e., moderate or vig-\norous, using weighted averages. The cut-point was 2020\ncounts/min for moderate activity and 5999 counts/min\nfor vigorous; these were used to estimate the total num-\nber of minutes per day spent in each activity level. We\npresent physical activity data as the total time in min-\nutes accumulated in either 1- or 10-minute intervals of\nmoderate, vigorous or moderate plus vigorous activity,\nas well as activity counts per minute (ct/min). Following\nprior conventions, we allowed for up to 2 minutes of\nbelow threshold count activity before considering the\nbout to be ended [15]. For these analyses, therefore, the\ncontinuous measure of \"counts over time\" was con-\nverted into \"bouts\" and these became the unit of\nanalysis.\nAs a form of sensitivity analysis, we repeated the esti-\nmates of time spent in moderate or vigorous activity\nusing cut-points which progressively reduced the counts\nper minute down to a minimum of 30% of the pre-set\nstandards described above [15].\nParticipants were identified as diabetic if they self-\nreported having the condition or were taking insulin or\noral hypoglycemic medications. Participants were identi-\nfied as hypertensive if they were taking anti-hypertensive\nmedication or their systolic blood pressure (SBP) was\nused standardized BMI cut-points to categorize partici-\npants as either overweight (BMI 25 and <30 kg/m2) or\nStatistical Methods\nData are presented as the total time accumulated in\neither 1- or 10-minute bouts of activity level, mean\ncounts per minute and mean wear time. Weighted\nmeans and standard errors are computed for each of the\ncontinuous variables of interest, and proportions with\nstandard errors are reported for the categorical variables\nby sex and race/ethnicity, accounting for the complex\nsampling scheme used by NHANES. Plasma glucose\nconcentrations were adjusted using the fasting sampling\nweights included in the NHANES dataset. Partial corre-\nlation coefficients were computed for each of the physi-\ncal activity measures with well-established CVD risk\nfactors, BMI, overweight and obesity accounting for age,\ngender and race/ethnicity. Standardized coefficients\nwere used to express change in the dependent variable\nper standard deviation in the independent variables.\nSummary statistics and correlation coefficients were cal-\nculated using SUDAAN (v.9, Research Triangle Park,\nNC), and Stata SE (v.11, College Station, TX).\nResults\nyears are presented in Table 1. The mean age of Mexi-\ncan-American participants was somewhat lower than for\nthe other racial/ethnic groups (i.e., 36 years vs. 42 for\nwhites and 39 for blacks). As anticipated, overweight\nand obesity were common in all groups, with a substan-\ntially higher prevalence in blacks. In addition, blacks had\nhigher blood pressures and lower total cholesterol and\nLDL-C levels. Diabetes prevalence, unadjusted for age,\nwas higher in blacks (8.0%) than either whites (3.6%) or\nMexican Americans (5.0%), as was hypertension preva-\nPhysical activity was summarized as the mean number\nof counts per minute (cts/min) and in the categories of\nmoderate or vigorous, presented in 1-minute and 10-\nminute bouts (Table 2). The average counts were higher\nest among Mexican-American men and women. As\nanticipated, activity declined sharply after age 50 (Figure\n1). Vigorous activity was recorded very infrequently; no\ngender-race groups had 1 bout of vigorous activity per\nday that lasted at least 10 minutes (Table 2). Even\nvigorous activity bouts of 1 minute were rare, ranging\nfrom 0.4/day among Mexican American women to 1.5/\nday among white men. Daily moderate activity was\nrecorded in 32 to 41 bouts of 1-minute duration in\nmen, and 18 to 20 1-minute bouts in women. Given the\npotential for artifact, the significance of 1-minute bouts\nof activity is difficult to interpret. The most stable esti-\nmate of activity patterns may therefore be the number\nof minutes per day spent in 10-minute bouts of activity.\nThis measure ranged from a high of 10.3 minutes per\nday of moderate plus vigorous activity among Mexican-\nAmerican men to a low of 5.0 minutes among Mexican-\nAmerican women, with a population average of 6.6 min-\nutes per day. Furthermore, over 66% of men and 68% of\nwomen did not accumulate a single 10-minute bout of\nmoderate or vigorous activity on any of the days.\nPrevious national prevalence estimates of activity pat-\nterns have come exclusively from questionnaires on dis-\ncrete behaviors and have suggested that relatively large\nproportions of the population meet current physical\nactivity guidelines [8,25,26]. In contradiction, activity as\nmeasured by activity monitors demonstrated that guide-\nlines are rarely being met. Thus, only 0.2% of women\nand 0.4% of men in the NHANES sample would have\nmet current guidelines requiring a minimum of approxi-\nmately two 10-minute blocks of moderate activity per\nday [6]. While more individuals accumulated greater\namounts of total moderate activity, the overwhelming\nmajority of this time was accounted for by 1-minute\nbouts (i.e., 75%); the time spent in longer bouts declined\nrapidly (Figure 2). Across the entire 6-day average per-\niod of recording, only 14% had a single block lasting 20\nminutes.\nQuantification of physical activity using accelerometry\ndepends critically on the number of counts per minute\nused as the cut-point defining moderate or vigorous\nactivity. Accelerometers can be well calibrated for walk-\ning or running but may miss other forms of body\nmotion thereby underestimating intensity. As a sensitiv-\nity analysis we therefore reduced the number of counts\nrequired to qualify as moderate/vigorous activity in a\nstepwise fashion from 80% of the laboratory-validated\nstandard down to 30%, and repeated the analyses above.\nCurrent guidelines of two 10-minute blocks of moderate\nactivity per day were met by 1.9% of the population\nwith the threshold reduced to 80% of the standard and\n29.5% when the threshold was only 30% of the standard.\nMost importantly, the majority of time in activity (~\n90%) was still spent in 1 minute bouts, suggesting sus-\ntained fitness-inducing exercise continued to be rare\neven at this much reduced threshold of counts per\nminute.\nAs a means of evaluating the internal validity of the\nmonitoring procedure we examined the relationship\nbetween activity measures and primary cardiovascular\nrisk factors. In a combined analysis, with adjustment for\nage, gender and race/ethnicity, both activity counts per\nminute and number of minutes in 1-minute bouts were\nsignificantly negatively associated with SBP, blood sugar,\nhypertension and diabetes, while activity measures were\npositively associated with HDL-cholesterol (Tables 3\n&4). Table 4 presents the change in risk factor based on\na standard deviation change in the activity measure; as a\nproportion of the mean for the given risk factor, the lar-\ngest effect was seen for HDL-C, followed by glucose. In\nTable 4, the association with hypertension and diabetes\nis further summarized as the change in odds ratio; for\nhypertension the odds were 20% lower, and for diabetes\n35% lower, with one standard deviation increase in\nactivity. After removing the effect of BMI and age, a\nnegative association remained for plasma glucose in the\ntotal sample and the majority of sub-groups (Table 5).\nNegative associations were also seen for diabetes, hyper-\ntension and HDL-cholesterol, although less consistently.\nBlood pressure was unrelated to activity counts or time\nspent in moderate activity in any of the separate gender-\nrace/ethnicity groups; this finding may be due in part to\nthe fact that treated hypertensives were not excluded.

Statistically sig-\nnificant negative associations with BMI were seen in\neach gender-race/ethnicity group, with the exception of\nactivity counts per minute for black women, and both\nmeasures for Mexican-American women. The associa-\ntion with overweight was not consistent, and the nom-\ninal relationship was positive and significant in the total\nsample, albeit weak in magnitude. On the other hand,\nobesity was negatively associated in all sub-groups for at\nleast one exposure measure, again with the exception of\nMexican-American women. The contrasting results in\noverweight and obesity could in part reflect the fact that\nmean BMIs were in the overweight range. Likewise, the\namount of moderate and vigorous activity in Mexican-\nAmerican women was the lowest of the sub-groups and\nthe sample size was modest.\nDiscussion\nThese findings from a large representative sample add a\nnew dimension to our understanding of the patterns and\nconsequences of physical activity in the US population.\nThe estimates of both vigorous and moderate activity were\nextremely low, and contrast dramatically with those\nobtained by self-report [8,25-27]. Vigorous activity lasting\neven 1 minute was only observed in 2% of any of the\ngender-race/ethnic groups and a 10-minute episode of\nmoderate activity - the intensity obtained by walking up\nstairs - was recorded in only one third of the participants\non any day of monitoring. The overall pattern observed\namong population sub-groups was, however, consistent\nwith expectations. Mexican-American men were some-\nwhat more active than blacks or whites, which might be\nattributable to physically demanding occupations, while\namong women whites appeared to be slightly more active\nthan either blacks or Mexican Americans, possibly reflect-\ning leisure time activity. Activity declined sharply with age;\nafter 60 only ~ 15 minutes of moderate activity was\nrecorded among men and 10 minutes among women per\nday. Despite the low mean levels a highly significant asso-\nciation was observed between activity level and all the\nmajor metabolic risk factors for CVD confirming that the\nmeasurements were valid and the effects sufficiently large\nto confer physiologic consequences.\nThe major finding from these analyses is the demon-\nstration that population estimates of activity levels from\nsurveys by questionnaire are markedly at variance with\nthose obtained by objective measurements. As the only\nsource available from past surveys, questionnaires have\nbeen used in analytic research and have informed public\nFigure 1 Mean number of minutes per day of moderate plus vigorous activity combined in 1-minute bouts by 5-year age groups -\npolicy for the last 50 years. If the data presented here\nare correct, a re-evaluation of the conclusions from\nmuch of this literature would be required. For example,\nbased on national survey data it was assumed in Healthy\nous activity of more than 20 minutes per episode at\nleast 3 times per week at the beginning of this decade\n[3]. However, in the NHANES data presented here, < 1\npercent of the population achieved this level of expendi-\nture. Likewise, current guidelines recommend 150\nminutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous activity\nindividuals in this sample, achieved that level. This\nresult is in stark contradiction to a recent report using\nself-reported \"usual occupational/domestic activity\" in a\nwhere 42% of persons with a mean age of 45 met cur-\nrent guidelines [28]; precision of this self-reported activ-\nity measure was apparently low, however, since it was\nunassociated with CVD risk factors. The findings of this\nFigure 2 Number of minutes accumulated in continuous bouts of moderate or vigorous activity lasting from 1 to 10 minutes,\nNHANES 2003-2006, (n = 3370).

Admit-\ntedly this validation is indirect, and additional evidence\nmust be sought in external studies which used similar\nmethods. Objective measurement of energy expenditure\nhas only become feasible in the last two decades, and\nfew of the available studies include representative popu-\nlation samples [17,18], therefore we know of no other\nstudies bearing directly on this question. Methodological\nstudies suggest that activity estimates from question-\nnaires are only correlated at approximately 0.2 with\nDLW, generally viewed as the most accurate approach\n[34]. Activity monitors, on the other hand, have been\nshown to correlate on average at 0.5-0.6 with energy\nstantial increase in precision.\nThe critical question for these NHANES data, how-\never, is not the degree to which accelerometry places\nindividuals in the correct rank order of increasing activ-\nity, but whether the absolute amount of activity is being\nmeasured more accurately than by questionnaire. A\nrecent review examined mean differences between esti-\nmates from DLW vs. questionnaire in 20 studies [34].\nThese studies were extremely heterogeneous in terms of\nsample size, type of participants and the questionnaire\nand, not surprisingly, the results were highly inconsis-\ntent; questionnaires overestimated energy expenditure\nby 1,000 kcal/day in some instances and under-esti-\nmated by 400 kcal/day in others [34]. A similarly hetero-\ngeneous literature exists on the concordance between\naccelerometry and DLW [14]. Contrary to question-\nnaires, accelerometry slightly under-estimated total\nexpenditure in all but one report, and mean differences\nkcal/day, or about 15 - 25% of physical activity expendi-\nture. A second comprehensive review summarized the\nconcordance between accelerometry and questionnaires\nin 47 validation studies [37]. On average, questionnaires\nrecorded 44% more daily energy expenditure than did\nactivity monitors. This second review also found that\nthe degree of heterogeneity in the comparison of ques-\ntionnaires with DLW was so great that no conclusions\nwere possible, although there was an indication that the\ndiscrepancy was larger for women than men [37]. It\nmust be recognized that the individual studies reviewed\nused a variety of instruments, each applying a different\nalgorithm to generate caloric expenditure from activity\ncounts, and they may not be directly comparable to the\ninstrument used in NHANES. In general, however, it\nseems reasonable to conclude that questionnaires are\nsubject to widely varying bias, most often leading to\nlarge over-estimates, while accelerometry has a far smal-\nler, contrary tendency to under-estimation. This evi-\ndence would suggest that true expenditure among\nNHANES participants is closer to the accelerometry\nestimates, although somewhat higher. Nonetheless, even\nwhen applying a threshold of counts per minute that\nwas only 30% of the standard set by direct calorimetry\nrelatively few individuals met the guidelines.\nAccelerometry is of course subject to potential biases.\nFor example, cycling or activities that require weight\nbearing will not be adequately captured, although these\nare infrequent in the general population. Likewise the\ndevice is not worn while swimming. Artifactual increases\nin counts can also occur as a result of external sources\nTable 6 Partial Correlation Coefficients (P-value) -\nPhysical Activity Monitor Measures and BMI, Overweight\nand Obesity* by Gender-Race/Ethnic Groups - NHANES\nVariable Body Mass\nIndex\nOverweight Obesity\nMod & Vig Activity (min/d in 1-\nmin bouts)\nMod & Vig Activity (min/d in 1-\nmin bouts)\nMod & Vig Activity (min/d in 1-\nmin bouts)\nMexican-American Males (n =\nMod & Vig Activity (min/d in 1-\nmin bouts)\nMod & Vig Activity (min/d in 1-\nmin bouts)\nMod & Vig Activity (min/d in 1-\nmin bouts)\nMexican-American Females (n\nMod & Vig Activity (min/d in 1-\nmin bouts)\n*Adjusted for age.\nof motion, such as riding in a vehicle. Artifact is a parti-\ncularly important bias for these data since the vast\nmajority of activity was recorded in episodes lasting only\n1 minute. These short bursts are unlikely to represent\nintentional efforts to accumulate fitness-inducing exer-\ncise or physically demanding tasks at work of the type\nthat would be captured by questionnaires. In fact, per-\nhaps the most robust conclusion from this survey is that\nvery few Americans engage in sustained activity, such as\njogging or long walks, on a frequent basis. Likewise, in\nan on-going multi-national survey we have also observed\na very low frequency of 10-minute bouts of activity in\nall 5 study populations (A. Luke, unpublished data).\nClearly a more detailed analysis of questionnaire data in\nconcert with accelerometry, and preferably DLW, will\nbe required to resolve these questions.\nIn addition to the associations with metabolic risk fac-\ntors, significant but quantitatively weak negative associa-\ntions exist between the activity measures and BMI and\nobesity. Likewise, after accounting for BMI, the associa-\ntion with CVD risk factors was substantially weakened,\nhighlighting the confounding that would be expected\namong these variables. The activity-BMI relationship\ncannot be considered causal, however, since these data\nare cross-sectional. Causality could be operating in the\nopposite direction or in both directions simultaneously.\nIn fact, whether increased activity prevents weight gain\nis a contentious question. Despite the widely held per-\nception that low levels of energy expenditure in activity\nis an important risk factor for obesity, prospective data\ndo not support this view [18,38]. Randomized trials,\nwhere activity levels are rigorously measured and no\nattempt is made to restrict calories, likewise show that\neven substantial increases in energy expenditure in exer-\ncise do not result in weight loss because of compensa-\ntory increases in intake [39,40]. We conclude, therefore,\nthat the associations observed in the NHANES data pre-\nsented here between activity and relative weight are\nspurious - i.e., the direction of the causality is most\nlikely from obesity to lower activity.\nPrevious analyses of the NHANES activity monitoring\ndata have noted a similar outcome as reported here with\nregard to levels of activity for the US population and the\nand Metzger et al. [13] reported a slightly higher propor-\ntion of the US population meeting the current physical\nactivity guidelines than our estimate (i.e., 5%). Metzger et\nal. used the data to define 5 classes of physical activity,\nincluding two classes of very low activity. The combined\nphysical activity level of these 2 classes was less than 25\nmin of moderate/vigorous physical activity per day and\nrepresented almost 79% of the US population [13].\nOne of the challenges for activity assessment by accel-\nerometry has been the choice of appropriate summary\nmeasures. Multiple alternative measures have been used\nand the results are often difficult to interpret or com-\npare across studies [45-47]. After detailed preliminary\nanalyses we chose three basic metrics - activity counts\nper minute and time spent in either vigorous or moder-\nate activity. As noted, the 1-minute bouts are subject to\nover-estimation of activity across the day due to instabil-\nity of the monitor The 10-minute bouts are potentially\nmeaningful with regard to health benefits, but may not\nbe capturing the true activity patterns of Americans and\n2- or 3-minute bouts could yield different results. How-\never, as shown in Figure 2, much less data will be avail-\nable with these cut-points. Using data from an on-going\nmulti-country study, we estimated an intraclass correla-\ntion coefficient of 0.88 with six days of activity monitor-\ning, indicating the NHANES data presented here with\nan average of 6 days, characterize the individual's activ-\nity patterns over the measurement period quite well (A.\nLuke, unpublished data).\nConclusion\nThese analyses of the NHANES physical activity moni-\ntor data demonstrate that the US population is seden-\ntary to a degree well beyond what had previously been\nassumed. Questionnaires on activity, as in most\nattempts to assess health behaviors, are subject to a\nstrong social desirability bias. Numerous examples\nexist in the public health literature on behaviors as dis-\nparate as smoking and sexual practices [48,49] and it is\nsomewhat surprising in fact that reported data on\nactivity have been taken at face value for so long.\nNonetheless the degree of discrepancy exceeds reason-\nable expectations and unrecognized methodological\nproblems may exist with use of accelerometry in the\ngeneral population. This detailed analysis of the\nNHANES results provides a starting point from which\nto address this important question. Research and sur-\nveillance in this vital area will continue to be of limited\nvalue until we have access to accurate objective meth-\nods of measurement.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Shiv Sundram for his assistance in creating\nfigures for this manuscript.
