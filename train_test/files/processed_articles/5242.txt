The sample comprised\nan important role in forming materialistic orientations in young people. Materialism is associated with parental attitudes of\nrejection and over-protection. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to determine whether the level and structure\nof young adults' materialism varied depending on their parents' attitudes toward upbringing. The analysis revealed that\ngroups with different perceptions of these parental attitudes viewed them solely within the scope of variables describing\nmaterialism as the importance of possessing and acquiring money to fulfill one's main goals in life (that being the case for all\nits dimensions). The \"traditional\" understanding of materialism (and the most common one in specialist literature), that is,\nregarding the possession of material goods as a source of happiness and an indicator of success in life, was non-differentiating.\n",

Thus, psychol-\nogists view these attitudes as an important topic within\nresearch into human functioning. Despite the large amount\nof research into materialism, the mechanism by which it is\nengendered and the role of upbringing in its formation are\nstill unclear. It is expected that the family plays an important\nrole in the process because its impact is the strongest and is\npresent throughout a person's life.

Richins and\nDawson (1992) understand materialism as the \"value which\n1University of Warsaw, Poland\nCorresponding Author:\nMagdalena Poraj-Weder, Faculty of Psychology, University of Warsaw, ul.\nEmail: mporaj@psych.uw.edu.pl\nPerceived Parental Upbringing and the\nMaterialism of Young Adults\nMagdalena Poraj-Weder1\n Keywords\nmaterialism, money, parental upbringing, young adults\n2 SAGE Open\nguides human choices and behaviour in various situations\nrelated to consumption and operationalize it as the set of\nbeliefs concerning the value attributed to material goods in\nthe individual's life\" (p. 308). Materialism manifests itself in\nthree areas. The first area is the tendency to judge one's suc-\ncess and that of others by the quantity and quality of posses-\nsions (the role of possessions in defining success). The\nsecond is the propensity to identify the possession of goods\nwith happiness and satisfaction (the role of acquisitions in\nhappiness). The third area is the central place in life accorded\nto the acquisition of goods (acquisition centrality). Because\nthinking about materialism solely in the context of material\ngoods seems to produce an incomplete picture of the phe-\nnomenon, Richins and Dawson's conceptualization was\nextended by adding another component, that is, the impor-\ntance of money and its role in achieving one's main goals in\nlife.\nOf course, questions related to the drive to acquire money\nhave already appeared in materialism research, especially in\nstudies on the relationships between materialism and a sense\nas suggested by Srivastava, Locke, and Bartol (2001), stud-\nies explicitly or implicitly assumed that individuals who had\nhigh financial aspirations and appreciated money would\nwish to allot it toward making purchases and consumption.\nNevertheless, high financial aspirations and the tendency to\nattach importance to money may also be based on other\n\"positive\" motives, such as the need to secure one's own and/\nor one's family's future or the need to be independent.\nAccording to Csikszentmihalyi and Rochberg-Halton (1981),\nthese motives are part of the \"instrumental\" form of material-\nism (as cited in G\u00f3rnik-Durose, 2002) rather than \"terminal\"\nmotives, such as the willingness to enhance one's status or\nthe desire to gain admiration and/or arouse jealousy from\nothers.\nOrigins of Materialism\nMany researchers have studied the essence and correlations\nof materialism, but few have undertaken research into the\norigin of the phenomenon. To date, the issue has mainly\nbeen explored in countries with developed consumption\ncultures that are suffering from the adverse consequences\nof materialism due to its expansion. Studies into the deter-\nminants of this materialistic orientation have been con-\nducted by many researchers (e.g., Cohen & Cohen, 1996;\nmaterialism has been present in Poland for less than 10\nyears (G\u00f3rnik-Durose, 2002), but studies into the origin of\nthe phenomenon have only recently started to appear\n(G\u00f3rnik-Durose & Dziedzic, 2013). The studies quoted\nabove (G\u00f3rnik-Durose & Dziedzic, 2013; Kasser et al.,\nof a model designed by Kasser et al. (2003), which points to\ntwo paths that lead to materialism: deprivation and social-\nization. The former presents materialism as a compensation\nstrategy (i.e., materialism as the effect of important psycho-\nlogical needs that were not satisfied in childhood). The lat-\nter emphasizes the role of internalizing and modeling\nbehaviors that lead to learning materialistic patterns (i.e.,\nmaterialism as an effect of behavior modeling). The study\npresented in this article considers the aspect of deprivation,\nand the analysis focuses on the relationship between paren-\ntal attitudes toward upbringing and young adults' material-\nism. It also considers two additional socioeconomic\nvariables: a subjective assessment of the family of origin's\nmaterial situation and the degree to which one's material\nneeds in childhood are met, which is subjectively\nperceived.\nThe relationship between parental attitudes and children's\nmaterialism has been studied by many researchers, including\nand G\u00f3rnik-Durose and Dziedzic (2013) in Poland. Their\nresults indicate that a materialist orientation is engendered\nby attitudes that do not involve a need for belonging and\ncloseness; these attitudes lack consistency and are associated\nwith excessive control. Such attitudes hinder the growth of\nindividual and social resources, disrupt the individuation\ncit compensation through the development of a materialist\norientation and thus a focus on goods and money (Kasser et\nal., 1995). The concept of parental attitudes proposed by\nArrindell et al. (1999) was adopted in the present study.\nArrindell et al. distinguish three types of parental attitudes\nexhibited by mothers and fathers: emotional warmth, over-\nprotection, and rejection. In view of the results cited above,\nover-protection and rejection seem to foster a materialistic\norientation.\nResearch Issue\nThe aim of this study was to analyze the relationships\nbetween parental attitudes and materialism. Materialism is\nunderstood here as the importance of possessing and acquir-\ning material goods and money to achieve one's main goals in\nlife. The following research questions were examined in this\nstudy.\nResearch Question 1: Are maternal and paternal atti-\ntudes toward a child's upbringing connected with young\npeople's materialism?\nBased on existing literature and the results of previous\nresearch, it was assumed that a materialistic orientation\nwould be fostered by parental rejection and over-protection\nKasser et al., 1995). The relationships between young peo-\nple's materialistic orientations and mothers' parental atti-\ntudes were expected to be stronger than relations between the\nPoraj-Weder 3\nformer and parental attitudes exhibited by fathers (G\u00f3rnik-\nResearch Question 2: Does young adults' materialism is\naffected by parenting style and whether a young people's\nneeds were met in childhood?\nTo answer this question, it was necessary to divide the\nentire group of participants into subgroups characterized by\nthe specific parenting styles exhibited by mothers and\nfathers.\nMethod\nSample\nThe study surveyed individuals aged 18 to 34 years old. The\nparticipants were full-time and evening students at the\nUniversity of Warsaw, the University of Social Sciences and\nHumanities in Warsaw, the Academy of Special Education in\nWarsaw, the University of L\u00f3d, the University of Computer\nSciences and Skills in L\u00f3d, the Academy of Music in L\u00f3d,\nand the L\u00f3d University of Technology. In all, 530 individu-\nals were surveyed, and 453 individuals were qualified for\nanalysis. The resulting participants comprised 335 females\nInstruments\nThe study utilized a research strategy based on an adult's\nretrospective assessment of childhood and growing up. The\nquestionnaire method was applied.\nMaternal and paternal upbringing attitudes were exam-\nined using the Polish version of the My Memories of\nUpbringing Egna Minnen Betr\u00e4ffande Uppfostran (s-EMBU )\ninventory (Arrindell et al., 1999). The tool measures parental\nupbringing attitudes on three dimensions: emotional warmth,\nrejection, and over-protection. The reliability of the specific\ndimensions in the presented study was as follows:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 emotional warmth: Cronbach's \nM\n\nF\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 rejection: Cronbach's \nM\nF\n=\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 over-protection: Cronbach's \nM\n\nF\nThe subjective assessment of the family of origin's mate-\nrial situation and the degree to which one's material needs\nwere met in childhood were determined using closed-ended\nquestions on a demographic questionnaire.\nMaterialism was studied using two scales: the Material\nValues Scale (MVS) by Richins (2004) and the Motives for\nMaking Money Scale by Srivastava et al. (2001).\nThe MVS is the Polish adaptation of the abbreviated MVS\nthree subscales that address three aspects of materialism:\nSuccess, Happiness, and Centrality of possessions. The suc-\ncess subscale measures the tendency to assess one's own suc-\ncess and the success of others based on the quantity and\nquality of possessed goods. The Happiness subscale mea-\nsures the tendency to equate possessions with a source of\nhappiness and satisfaction with life. The Centrality subscale\nmeasures the centrality of possessions in an individual's life.\nThe MVS was adapted for Polish conditions by Wsowicz-\nKirylo (2013). Similar to the version devised by Richins, the\nadapted version consists of 15 items and contains three sub-\nscales: Success, Happiness, and Centrality of possessions.\nHowever, the study presented here does not conform to the\nthree-factor structure, which is consistent with the results\nfrom other Polish studies. Exploratory factor analysis was\nconducted, and the results indicated four main components\nwith eigenvalues above one, which cumulatively accounted\nfor 54% of the variance. However, due to the unsatisfactory\nreliability of the received subscales, factor analysis was per-\nformed again by applying a solution suggested by the scree\nplot for two and three components. Because of this proce-\ndure, a proper version of the MVS was produced. This ver-\nsion comprised 9 test items and contained two subscales:\nSuccess and Happiness. The Success subscale included 5\nitems--the same as the original questionnaire version,\nwhereas the Happiness subscale was made up of 4 items,\nwhich was also the same as Richins' scale. A subsequent\nanalysis performed on the 9-item questionnaire version\nexamined its internal structure. Exploratory factor analysis\nwas used using the principal components analysis method\nwith Oblimin rotation and Kaiser normalization. The results\nfor sample selection adequacy were satisfactory (Kaiser\u00ad\nMeyer\u00adOlkin [KMO] = 0.822; Bartlett's sphericity test 2 =\nTwo principal components were reached cumulatively and\naccounted for 51.57% of the variance. The next step was to\ndetermine the reliability of both subscales selected as a result\nof factor analysis. To that end, Cronbach's alpha method was\napplied. Item 14 comprising the Happiness subscale lowered\nCronbach's  coefficient value and weakly correlated with\nthe other items; therefore, it was dropped from the scale. In\nthis way, the final 8-item version of the tool was reached.\nThe Cronbach's  statistical values were .724 for the Success\nsubscale and .727 for the Happiness subscale. The psycho-\nmetric characteristics of the scale formed by combining\nitems included on both subscales were also tested. The\nCronbach's  coefficient value for these characteristics was\nThe Motives for Making Money Scale enables the diag-\nnosis of materialism in relation to the importance of money\nin value realization. In its original version, the tool comprises\n10 subscales with three items each. The subscales are\nSecurity, Family Support, Market Worth, Pride, Leisure,\nFreedom, Impulse, Charity, Overcoming Self-Doubt, and\nSocial Comparison. The reliability of the specific subscales\nmeasured by Cronbach's  coefficient ranges from .73 to .92\n4 SAGE Open\n(Srivastava et al., 2001). These subscales form three superior\ndimensions, which were isolated by Srivastava et al. (2001)\nas a result of second-order factor analysis. These dimensions\nare positive motives, freedom of action, and negative\nrespectively.\nThe scale was adapted for Polish conditions by Poraj-\nWeder for the purposes of this work, and Srivastava et al.\n(2001) gave consent for the tool to be adapted. The transla-\ntion was done using the back-translation procedure and com-\npetent raters. As in the original version, data concerning\nmotives for making money were subjected to second-order\nfactor analysis. The results received, however, were only\npartly consistent with the original solution. Based on these\nresults, four dimensions were isolated instead of three, as in\nthe original version.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The positive motives dimension grouped the security,\nfamily, support, market worth, and pride scales. It\nexpressed the tendency to treat money as a means of\nobtaining one's life necessities (e.g., \"I want to secure\nbasic needs,\" \"I want to secure the future of my chil-\ndren\"), a measure of market worth (e.g., \"I want to get\njust compensation for my efforts\"), and a measure of\nachievements in life (e.g., \"I want to know that I can\nhandle challenges posed by life\"). It proved to be\nidentical to the positive motives dimension isolated\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The freedom of action dimension grouped the leisure\nand impulse scales. It expressed the tendency to treat\nmoney as a means allowing for a comfortable, nice,\nand entertaining life (e.g., \"I want to let my mood\nguide me at times so that I can blow money while\nshopping just for the thrill of it,\" \"I want to enjoy lux-\nuries\"). This dimension differed fundamentally from\nthe original freedom of action dimension (Srivastava\net al., 2001), which treated money as a means of car-\nrying out values.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The negative motives dimension grouped the over-\ncoming self-doubt and social comparison scales. It\nwas tantamount to perceiving money as a means of\novercoming one's deficiencies and gaining an advan-\ntage over others (e.g., \"I want to show that I am better\nthan my acquaintances, siblings, relatives,\" \"I want\nto prove that I am not as dumb as some people\nassumed I was\"). It proved identical to the negative\nmotives dimension isolated by Srivastava et al.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The charity scale comprised one scale of the same\nname. It entailed treating money as a means of serving\nothers (e.g., \"I want to donate money to those who\nneed it\"). In the factor solution assumed by Srivastava\net al. (2001), charity did not form a separate factor;\ninstead, it was part of the freedom of action\ncomponent.\nResearch Results\nThe first aim of the study was to verify the relationship\nbetween role models in the family and young people's mate-\nrialism. The analyses indicated several interesting, though\nrelatively weak, relationships among the analyzed variables.\nRelations Between Parental Attitudes and\nMaterialism (Understood as the Importance of\nPossessing and Acquiring Material Goods for\nValue Realization)\nThe first step was to analyze the relationship between mater-\nnal and paternal attitudes toward upbringing and materialism\nthat equates the possession of goods with success and happi-\nness. Statistically significant relationships between paternal\nattitudes toward children's upbringing for both success and\nhappiness were revealed. Both forms of materialism corre-\nlated positively with attitudes of rejection and over-protec-\ntion and negatively with an attitude of emotional warmth. In\nrelation to maternal attitudes toward upbringing, positive\nrelationships were found between treating possessions as a\nmeasure of success and an attitude of over-protection and\nbetween seeing possessions as a source of happiness and atti-\ntudes of over-protection and rejection (p < .10). Detailed\nresults from the analyses are shown in Table 1.\nRelations Between Parental Attitudes and\nMaterialism (Understood as the Importance\nof Possessing and Acquiring Money for Value\nRealization)\nThis study also aimed to analyze the relationship between\nparental attitudes toward their children's upbringing and\nmaterialism, understood in this section as the importance of\npossessing money to realize values. In relation to maternal\nattitudes toward upbringing, the attitude of acceptance (emo-\ntional warmth) proved to be vital. It was positively correlated\nwith the positive motives dimension and with the freedom of\naction and charity dimensions at the level of tendency, thus\nindicating good or \"instrumental\" materialism\n(Csikszentmihalyi & Rochberg-Halton, 1981, as cited in\nG\u00f3rnik-Durose, 2002). An attitude of over-protection was\npositively correlated with the negative motives dimension,\nwhich equates money with the ability to overcome one's\ndeficiencies and gain an advantage over others; therefore,\nbad (\"terminal\") materialism was indicated. The attitude of\nrejection also correlated with the negative motives dimen-\nsion at the level of tendency.\nA very similar set of results was received for the fathers.\nThe attitude of acceptance correlated positively with the pos-\nitive motives and charity dimensions, while the attitude of\nrejection correlated negatively with the positive motives\ndimension and positively with the negative motives\nPoraj-Weder 5\ndimension. The attitude of over-protection correlated posi-\ntively with the negative motives dimension (Table 2).\nTo answer the second question, it was first necessary to\nisolate and describe groups comprising mothers and fathers\nwho exhibited specific types of parental attitudes and then to\ndetermine whether those groups showed differences in the\nlevel and structure of materialism.\nParenting styles. Ward's (1963) method of hierarchical clus-\ntering analysis was used (StatSoft, Electronic Statistic Text-\nbook) to assign individuals to groups according to parenting\nstyles. Ward's method was chosen to minimize variance\nwithin clusters and to group participants exhibiting similar\nparenting styles. The analysis was based on empirical data\ndescribing parenting styles exhibited by mothers and fathers.\nThe analysis was conducted for three, four, and five clus-\nters. An optimal value was received for four clusters\nbetween each group's parental attitudes toward upbringing\nare shown in Table 3 and are illustrated in Figure 1.\nThe isolated groups are represented by (1) individuals\nwho perceived their mother's and father's parenting styles as\nnormal; (2) individuals with a positive perception of their\nmothers and who perceived their fathers as isolating; (3)\nindividuals who perceived their mothers as distant and con-\ntrolling and their fathers as inconsistent; and (4) individuals\nwho perceived their mothers as over-protective and their\nfathers as rejecting and controlling.\nIndividuals who perceived their mother's and father's\nparenting styles as normal (Cluster 1) differed from the oth-\ners on all the dimensions of parental attitudes toward\nupbringing. The only exception was for the attitude of rejec-\ntion exhibited by the mother (similarly \"remembered\" in the\nfirst and second clusters). Thus, individuals in the first group\nTable 1.

They scored moderately on the over-protection\nattitude, which indicates its normal intensity (parents are per-\nceived as protective but not controlling).\nIndividuals with a positive perception of their mothers\nand who perceived their fathers as isolating (Cluster 2) were\ncharacterized by a complex array of scores. Hence, they dif-\nfered in regard to maternal parenting styles from the third\nrejection dimension, from the first and second clusters on the\nemotional warmth dimension, and from all the clusters on\nthe over-protection dimension (p = .001), in which they\nscored the lowest in comparison with the other groups. The\narray of scores for maternal attitudes toward upbringing indi-\ncates a similarity between the parenting style in the second\ncluster and the style characterizing the first cluster, that is,\nindividuals who perceived the parenting style of both parents\nas normal. However, in the second cluster, the profile is\nclearly less beneficial; mothers are perceived as less emo-\ntionally warm and less protective. Consequently, this cluster\nspecifies these maternal parenting styles as \"positive\" but\nnot \"normal\" or \"desirable.\"\nWhen analyzing paternal parenting styles, participants in\nthe second cluster differed from the others on the rejection\nterms of the attitude of rejection, they scored higher than the\nindividuals in the first cluster did and lower than the indi-\nviduals in the third and fourth clusters did, while they scored\nthe lowest compared with the other clusters on the over-pro-\ntection dimension. In addition, the participants differed from\nindividuals in the first cluster in the emotional warmth\ndimension. Therefore, in comparison with the other clusters,\nfathers in this cluster seem emotionally cool, uninterested in\ntheir children, and \"absent\" in the upbringing process.\nIndividuals who perceived their mothers as distant and\ncontrolling and their fathers as inconsistent (Cluster 3) dif-\nfered from the others on all the dimensions of maternal atti-\ntudes toward upbringing. They received the highest scores\ndimensions and the lowest scores on the emotional warmth\n(p = .001) dimensions compared with the other clusters. Such\nan array of scores makes this maternal parenting style the\nleast beneficial compared with the other clusters.\nIn terms of paternal parenting styles, participants in the\nsecond cluster differed from the others on the rejection (p =\nthe attitude of rejection, the participants scored higher than\nthe individuals in the first and second clusters and lower than\nthe individuals in the fourth cluster. For the attitude of over-\nprotection, they scored higher than individuals in the second\ncluster and lower than individuals in the first and fourth clus-\nters. This structure indicates an inconsistency in upbringing,\nas fathers seem simultaneously rejecting, protective, and\nemotionally cool. Together with emotionally cool, rejecting,\nand controlling mothers, they create a clearly adverse envi-\nronment for the process of individuation.\nTable 3.

Thus, for the attitude of\nrejection and over-protection, they scored higher than indi-\nviduals in the first and second clusters and lower than indi-\nviduals in the third cluster, whereas they scored lower than\nindividuals in the first cluster and higher than individuals in\nthe third cluster for the attitude of emotional warmth. The\nscores on the over-protection and emotional warmth dimen-\nsions are especially significant to the qualitative description\nof this cluster. Their intensity indicates a clear perception of\nmothers as over-protective (although not controlling).\nIn terms of paternal parenting styles, the participants in\nthis cluster scored the highest on the rejection (p = .001) and\nover-protection (p = .001) dimensions in comparison with\nthe other clusters. Moreover, they differed from the first clus-\nter (p = .001) on the emotional warmth (p = .001) dimension,\nwhere they received lower scores. Such an array of scores\nindicates a strongly negative perception of paternal parenting\nstyles. Fathers are perceived as exceptionally strict, reject-\ning, controlling, and emotionally cool.\nThe clusters that emerged from the analysis were further\ncharacterized by socioeconomic variables. Participants\nassigned to a given group were tested for the subjective\nassessment of their financial situation and the satisfaction of\ntheir needs during childhood. To that end, a different signifi-\ncance test was performed between two independent propor-\ntions (Ferguson & Takane, 2009). The results of this analysis\nare shown in Table 4.\nStatistically significant differences were found for the\nfirst and second clusters (p = .05) and for the first and fourth\nones (p = .05). The percentage of individuals who perceived\nthe material conditions in which they grew up as negative\nwas higher in the second and fourth clusters than in the first\ncluster.\nThe last element of the deprivation path in the presented\nstudy was then tested, that is, the degree to which one's\nmaterial needs were met during childhood. Similar to the\nsubjective assessment of material conditions, a different sig-\nnificance test was performed between two independent pro-\nportions (Ferguson & Takane, 2009). The percentage of\nindividuals who assessed the degree to which their material\nneeds were met during childhood as unsatisfactory was lower\nin the first cluster than in all the others (p = .05). Moreover,\nthe percentage of individuals who stated that their parents\nwent above and beyond in meeting their material needs was\nhigher in the first cluster than in the fourth cluster No other\ndifferences regarding satisfaction were observed among the\nclusters.\nDifferences Between Clusters With Respect to\nthe Level and Structure of Materialism\nThe objective of the next stage of analysis was to answer the\nsecond research question, namely, whether different parent-\ning styles result in varying intensities and structures of mate-\nrialism in young adults. To answer that question, a MANOVA\nbetween groups was conducted. The groups determined in\nthe hierarchical cluster analysis were treated as the indepen-\ndent variable. Two dependent variables were used:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 materialism understood as the importance of possess-\ning and acquiring material goods to achieve one's\nmain goals in life, which are defined as success and\nhappiness; and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 materialism understood as the importance of possess-\ning and acquiring money to achieve one's main goals\nin life, which are defined as positive motivation, free-\ndom of action, negative motivation, and charity.\nThe results indicated that participants differed only on\nvariables describing materialism as the importance of pos-\nsessing and acquiring money to achieve one's main goals in\nlife. In addition, inter-group differences in materialism\nunderstood in this way were found for all four of its dimen-\nTable 4.

For these tests, the\nfirst, second, and third clusters constituted the first group and\nthe second group included \"classified\" participants, exclud-\ning those individuals in a cluster that constituted the first\ngroup for comparisons. The results of these analyses are pro-\nvided in Tables A1 to A4 in the appendix.\nIndividuals who perceived the parental styles of both their\nparents as normal (Cluster 1) scored higher in comparison with\nthe other clusters on the positive motives dimension, t(377.44) =\n.072, dimensions.

The conclu-\nsion applies both to materialism understood as the impor-\ntance of possessing and acquiring material goods for value\nrealization and to materialism understood as the importance\nof possessing and acquiring money for value realization. The\nattitude of over-protection seems to be especially adverse. It\nclearly contributes to the belief that possessed goods are a\nguarantee of happiness and success and that money serves to\novercome doubts and to gain an advantage over others (\"ter-\nminal\" materialism). In turn, attitudes toward upbringing\nthat support the individuation process, which is associated\nwith emotional warmth, contribute to forming positive\nmotives for earning money and treating it as a means to ful-\nfilling constructive goals and values (\"instrumental\" materi-\nalism). In addition, fathers' attitudes toward upbringing are\nnegatively related to materialism in terms of viewing posses-\nsions as a measure of success and a source of happiness.\nIt is quite surprising and contrary to previously held\nassumptions that paternal (rather than maternal) attitudes\ntoward children's upbringings appeared to be more impor-\ntant in forming young people's materialistic orientations.\nRelationships between materialism (understood as the\nimportance of possessing and acquiring both material goods\nand money for value realization) and the attitude of rejection\nexhibited by mothers were observed only at the level of ten-\ndency (the attitude of over-protection played a significant\nrole). This result requires further verification because accord-\ning to information provided by the specialist literature,\nabnormal maternal attitudes are central to forming young\nHowever, studies by Kasser et al. (1995) and Flouri\n(1999) only examined mothers. Therefore, the hypothesis\nregarding the impact of paternal attitudes toward children's\nupbringings on young people's materialism was de facto not\nverified. However, studies by G\u00f3rnik-Durose and Dziedzic\n(2013) used a retrospective assessment of parental attitudes\nto analyze differences between groups that were isolated\nbased on a configuration of goals in life (individuals with\nmaterialistic orientations were compared with individuals\nTable 5. Differences in the Components of Materialism in Isolated Clusters.\nCluster 1 Cluster 2 Cluster 3 Cluster 4 MANOVA\n M\nSD\nM\nSD\nM\nSD\nM\nSD\nF p \nThe importance of possessing and acquiring material goods to achieve one's main goals in life\nThe importance of possessing and acquiring money to achieve one's main goals in life\nPoraj-Weder 9\noriented toward spiritual development and individuals ori-\nented toward achieving psychophysical harmony). These\nstudies produced results indicating inter-group differentia-\ntion between both maternal and paternal attitudes toward\nupbringing. In both these cases, inconsistent and demanding\nattitudes proved to be important. Although the strength of the\neffect was decidedly higher for maternal attitudes toward\nupbringing, the results indicated that not only maternal but\nalso paternal attitudes toward children's upbringing play a\nrole in forming young people's orientation in life. This result\nwas also confirmed in a study conducted by Poraj-Weder and\nDzierek (2012) that compared differences between life\ngoals among groups that were isolated based on the quality\nof parental attitudes toward children's upbringing. The object\nof the analyses was to determine which maternal and pater-\nnal attitudes toward upbringing are differentiating in relation\nto forming materialistic orientations operationalized by\nattaching a high importance to goals related to money, image,\nand fame. The results revealed that individuals who per-\nceived parental attitudes toward upbringing as normal\nassessed goals indicating materialistic orientations signifi-\ncantly lower than did individuals who perceived maternal\nattitudes toward upbringing as inadequate (inconsistent,\nover-protective) or those who perceived paternal attitudes as\ninadequate (rejecting, excessively demanding, do not sup-\nport autonomy).\nThe other aim of the study was to determine whether the\nlevel and structure of young adults' materialism varied\ndepending on how they perceived their parents' style of par-\nenting. The cluster analysis used in the study divided the par-\nticipants into four groups based on their perception of\nmaternal and paternal parenting styles. The four clusters\nwere divided as follows: (1) individuals who perceived their\nmother's and father's parenting styles as normal; (2) indi-\nviduals with a positive perception of their mothers and who\nperceived their fathers as isolating; (3) individuals who per-\nceived their mothers as distant and controlling and their\nfathers as inconsistent; and (4) individuals who perceived\ntheir mothers as over-protective and their fathers as rejecting\nand controlling.\nThe groups differed in their subjective assessment of the\nmaterial situation and subjectively perceived the degree to\nwhich their material needs were met during childhood. The\nfirst cluster contained the highest the percentage of \"satis-\nfied\" individuals in comparison with the other clusters. In\ncontrast, the fourth cluster comprised the largest number of\nindividuals who experienced deficiencies in both areas.\nA comparative analysis of the each groups regarding spe-\ncific components of materialism (understood as the impor-\ntance of possessing and acquiring material goods and money\nto achieve one's main goals in life) revealed interesting\nresults.\nFirst, the studied groups differed only on the scope of\nvariables describing materialism as the importance of pos-\nsessing and acquiring money to achieve one's main goals in\nlife (this was the case for all its dimensions). Materialism in\nits \"traditional\" and most common understanding, that is, the\npossession of material goods as a source of happiness and an\nindicator of success in life, was non-differentiating. This was\na surprising result that requires further empirical verification\nbecause it indicates a higher importance for the component\nthat associates materialism with gathering money (rather\nthan with gathering goods) and, more specifically, with vari-\nous motivations that underlie gathering money.\nIn terms of the motives for gathering money, the relation-\nships revealed were as expected. Positive parenting styles on\nthe part of both parents (Cluster 1) or only mothers (Cluster\n2) created favorable conditions for shaping positive motives\nfor gathering money, which are typical of \"instrumental\"\nmaterialism. However, negative parental attitudes toward\nupbringing, especially on the part of fathers (Cluster 4),\nresulted in the development of negative compensatory\nmotives, which represent \"terminal\" materialism.\nThus, the hypothesis that the deprivation path leads to\nmaterialism was confirmed for parental attitudes toward\nchildren's upbringings.\nIn terms of the formulated expectations, an apparently\ncontradictory result was received for the third cluster.\nNegative maternal attitudes toward upbringing associated\nwith excessive control and emotional distance combined\nwith inconsistency in paternal upbringing (Cluster 3) resulted\nin the inhibited development of motives connected with the\nfreedom of action dimension, which leads to the tendency to\ntreat money as a means of obtaining a comfortable, nice, and\nentertaining life. Cluster three's high reluctance to freely and\n\"materialistically\" dispose of their money may result from a\nneed for security that was not satisfied in their childhood\nbecause of disturbed relationships with their mothers\n(Uchnast, 1991). This deficit may trigger behaviors aimed at\nensuring security for oneself, which is manifested in various\nareas of life, including one's attitude toward money and a\nreluctance to squander it and spend it to indulge oneself.\nThe issue is very interesting in the context of the depriva-\ntion-related roots of materialism. However, it requires fur-\nther research and empirical verification through analysis\ncarried out on a representative sample using instruments that\nare more sophisticated. The sample and the measures used in\nthis study both somewhat limit the results of this research.\nIn interpreting the results of the study, one should note the\nstructure of the sample; 74% of the participants were women.\nIt is possible that this disparity biased the results. The study\nshould be repeated with a representative sample of an appro-\npriate size.\nThe instruments used in the study have good psychometric\nproperties, although they do rely on self-assessment. While\nsuch tools are widely accepted in studies on parental attitudes\nand materialism, they are sensitive to situational and temporal\nfactors. Therefore, alternative assessments on parental attitudes\ntoward children's upbringings and materialism that corroborate\nor extend the results of this research would be desirable.\nIn conclusion, the results of the present study show that\nparents can effectively help their children live lives governed\nby \"being\" rather than \"having\" by ensuring well-function-\ning family environments for them. This result is very impor-\ntant. The ubiquitous mercantilism in social relations and the\nbelief that possessions define our identities pose a serious\nthreat to the proper development of the young generation and\nprovide fertile grounds for the growth of materialism as a\ncharacter trait. The role of the family is particularly impor-\ntant in this context. A child's materialist orientation is shaped\nand strengthened within the family. When they are accepted\nand loved, children grow in an atmosphere conducive to the\ndevelopment of self-esteem and the adoption of a system of\nvalues that helps them resist harmful external influences and\nmake free choices. However, deficits in this area lead them\nto seek compensation in the form of goods and money,\nalthough such a lifestyle does not guarantee a sense of\nwell-being.\nAppendix\nTable A1.
