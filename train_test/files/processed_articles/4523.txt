Standardized blinded ultrasound\nexamination of 36 joints and the triceps and patellar tendons was performed to identify tophi\nand the double contour (DC) sign.\nResults: Ultrasonographic sensitivity was lower in early than late gout. Binary logistic regression\nanalysis showed that two ultrasonographic signs (tophi in the first metatarsophalangeal joint [odds\nratio, 16.46] and the DC sign in the ankle [odds ratio, 25.18]) significantly contributed to the final\nmodel for early gout diagnosis (sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 81%, respectively). The inter-\nreader reliability kappa value for the DC sign and tophi was 0.712.\nConclusions: Four-joint investigation (both first metatarsophalangeal joints for tophi and both\nankles for the DC sign) is feasible and reliable and could be proposed as a screening test for early\nultrasonographic gout classification in daily practice.\n",

The gold\nstandard diagnostic technique for gout is\ndetection of monosodium urate (MSU)\ncrystals in synovial fluid.7\u00ad9 However, this\nis an invasive procedure and does not allow\nfor evaluation of either the extent of urate\ndeposition or the response to urate-lowering\ntreatments. Ultrasonography (US) has\nrecently been proposed for these pur-\nRheumatology/European League Against\nRheumatism (ACR/EULAR) gout classifi-\ncation criteria are the first to incorporate US\nevidence of the double contour (DC) sign,\nan articular cartilage abnormality related to\nthe deposition of crystals on the surface of\nthe hyaline cartilage, as a sign specific\nto gout.12 The specificity and sensitivity of\nother gout-related elementary US lesions,\nsuch as the presence of tophi, still need to be\nevaluated in prospective trials.12,13 The sen-\nsitivity and negative predictive value of US\nsigns of MSU deposition in symptomatic\njoints is only about 60%, while examination\nof multiple joints gives better results.14\nexamination including the upper and lower\nextremities and two tendons; this technique\nficity for gout diagnosis. Peiteado et al.16\nperformed an uncontrolled study of a time-\nsaving 6-minute US examination of four\njoints in the lower extremities (knees and\nfirst metatarsophalangeals [MTPs]), which\nallowed for the detection of ``hyperechoic\ncloudy areas'' and/or the DC sign in 97% of\ncases. Since the aforementioned studies,\nmost gout US imaging studies have\ninvestigated patients with advanced-stage\ngout17 with an average disease duration of\n7 years. Therefore, which and how many\nsites should be investigated for optimal US\ngout classification in patients with early-\nstage gout remains unclear.\nOur goal was to compare the diagnostic\nvalue of US in early- versus late-stage gout\nand to establish an optimal multiple-site US\ntest for early gout classification.\nMethods\nThe prospective case-control single-\nLithuanian University of Health Sciences\nKaunas Region Biomedical Research\nEthics Committee. Written informed con-\ntent was obtained from all patients before\nstudy entry.\nParticipants\nFor inclusion in the study, participants had\nto be >18 years old and meet one of the\nfollowing two criteria: (1) have a diagnosis\nof gout as stated by a rheumatologist and\nconfirmed by the study investigators accord-\ning to the presence of MSU crystals in a\nsymptomatic (ever) joint or bursa and have\nno acute gout attack at the time of US\nexamination, or (2) have a healthy clinical\nstatus with a serum uric acid (UA) concen-\nobjective or subjective joint symptoms.\nPatients with gout were recruited from\nthose who had been referred from a primary\ncare facility for a rheumatology consult-\nation. Patients with other inflammatory\ndiseases or psoriasis were excluded. The\nparticipants were divided into four groups\nfor statistical analysis: whole gout (all\npatients with gout), early gout ( 2 years\nfrom the first attack), late gout (>2 years\nfrom the first attack), and healthy controls.\nSample size calculation\nThe primary effect variable used for the\npower calculation was the proportion of\ntophi or DC signs found per joint site on US\nexamination. With an assumption of a\ncalculated expected sensitivity of 49% for\ntophi or the DC sign in patients with\nadvanced gout, 23% in patients with early\ngout, and 2% in healthy controls; based on\nthe sensitivity reported at different joint sites\nerrors, a minimum of 49 joints was required\nper site for comparison between patients\nwith early and late gout, and a minimum of\n29 joints was required for comparison\nbetween patients with gout and healthy\ncontrols. Because bilateral assessment of\neach site was planned, a minimum of 25\nparticipants was required in each group.\nClinical and laboratory assessment\nAll participants underwent a clinical assess-\nment and blood sampling by a rheumatolo-\ngist. Demographic data (age and sex), height,\nweight, and the serum concentrations of UA,\nC-reactive protein, and creatinine were\nobtained for all participants. Disease history\n(symptom duration and the numbers of gout\nattacks throughout life and within the last\nyear) and the presence of subcutaneous tophi\nwere recorded for all patients with gout.\nUS assessment\nStandardized US examinations were per-\nformed for all participants by one rheuma-\ntologist (M.P.) who had 10 years of\nexperience in musculoskeletal US and was\nblinded to the patient groups and clinical\ndata. The LOGIQ e US system with a\n12-MHz linear transducer on a B-mode\nscale was used for all US examinations.\nObtained views were recorded to the digital\nfile for each participant. Thirty-six joints\n(both wrists, metacarpophalangeals [MCPs],\nhand proximal interphalangeals, knees,\nankles, and MTPs and four tendons [both\ntriceps and patellar tendons]) of each partici-\npant were assessed. All joints were scanned in\nthe longitudinal plane on the dorsal side.\nKnees were explored in the longitudinal and\ntransverse planes in the suprapatellar and\nparapatellar joint recesses on full extension of\nthe leg for joint cavity evaluation, longitu-\ndinally at 20 degrees of flexion for patellar\ntendon evaluation, and transversally at max-\nimal flexion for femoral cartilage evaluation.\nThe ankles were investigated in the longitu-\ndinal plane on the dorsal and lateral sides.\nThese views were chosen according to the\nguidelines for musculoskeletal US.21\u00ad23 The\nareas scanned were defined based on typical\ngout clinics and previously published litera-\npresence of the DC sign and tophi. Tendons\nwere investigated for tophi. US features of\nMSU crystal deposition (Figure 1) were\npersonal experience. Specifically, an intra-\narticular tophus was defined as a circum-\nscribed heterogeneous, hyperechoic/isoechoic\n(relative to subdermal fat) mass, sometimes\nwith hypoechoic inclusions and with or\nwithout a small anechoic rim. The DC sign\nwas defined as a hyperechoic band over the\nsuperficial margin of the articular hyaline\ncartilage, visible independent of the angle of\ninsonation. An intratendinous tophus was\ndefined as a circumscribed heterogeneous,\nhyperechoic/isoechoic (relative to the tendon\nfibres) aggregation with poorly defined mar-\ngins and with or without areas of acoustic\nshadowing, changing the normal course of\nthe tendon fibres.\nUS reliability\nPrior to the study, two investigators (M.P.\nand E.N.) scanned 10 patients with gout\n(not included in the study) who had visible\nsubcutaneous tophi to discuss the scanning\ntechnique, clarify previously reported defin-\nitions of gout lesions, and identify typical\nsigns of gout deposits. To calculate the\nreliability and reproducibility of the US\nassessment, a Web-based exercise was per-\nformed at the start of the study. Eighty-four\ndigitally recorded US images with or with-\nout urate deposits in different investigated\nareas of both patients and controls were\nrandomly selected from the database and\nevaluated twice at a 3-week interval for the\npresence or absence of MSU deposits by\ntwo rheumatologists: M.P. (the investigator\nwho obtained the US images) and E.N.\n(4 years of experience in US and special\nskills in gout US). Both rheumatologists\nwere blinded to the patients' clinical data.\nThe results reported by investigator M.P.\nor upon agreement were used for statistical\nanalysis.\nSynovial fluid investigation\nUS-guided aspiration from symptomatic\n(ever) joints or bursas was performed by the\ntwo above-mentioned study investigators\n(M.P. and E.N.) in all patients with gout\nbefore inclusion in the study. Healthy con-\ntrols underwent aspiration when they had\npathological US findings (tophus or DC sign)\nand if they agreed to undergo an interven-\ntion. Synovial fluid was analysed for MSU\ncrystals by polarized light microscopy on the\nsame day as the aspiration. Analysis was\nperformed by two trained rheumatologists.\nOne of them was an independent assessor\nwho was blinded to the patients' clinical data\nand US results. Discrepancies between esti-\nmators were resolved by consensus.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using\nSPSS statistical software, version 20.0\nFigure 1.

The frequencies of\nUS findings were calculated first as propor-\ntions (displayed by participants) and second\nat individual investigated sites. Paired means\nbetween groups were compared using the\nMann\u00adWhitney test or Student's t test and\nPearson's chi-square test or Fisher's test for\ncategorical variables, as appropriate. All\ntests were two-tailed. The reliability analysis\nwas performed using unweighted Cohen's k-\nstatistic for dichotomous assessment (i.e.,\npresence or absence), and the k-statistic was\nreliability; and >0.80, almost perfect reli-\nability.30 To identify the most important\nsites and signs for US gout classification,\nonly variables with a p-value of <0.05 in the\nchi-square test and a Cramer's V of >0.3\nwere subjected to binary logistic regression\nwith the forward stepwise conditional\nmethod. The diagnostic value of the devel-\noped set of US features for US gout classi-\nfication was estimated using a classification\ntable: sensitivity of prediction (percentage of\npatients classified correctly) and specificity\nof prediction (percentage of controls classi-\nfied correctly). All p-values of <0.05 were\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nThe data of 96 participants were chosen for\nanalysis: 60 patients (53 men) with primary\ngout proven by the presence of crystals\n(25 classified as early gout, 35 as late gout)\nand 36 healthy controls (28 men). Seventeen\npatients clinically suspected to have gout\nwere screened for the study, but gout was\nnot confirmed by crystal microscopy and\nthe patients were not analysed.

The strength of agreement was con-\nsidered good or very good.\nConcordance between US findings and\nmicroscopic evaluation of MSU crystals\nForty-five intra-articular tophi found by US\nexamination (39 randomly selected from\npatients with gout and 6 from healthy\ncontrols) were aspirated. MSU crystals\nwere microscopically identified in 80% of\nparticipants (36/45). Six crystal-negative\nsamples were from the healthy control\ngroup, and three were from the clinically\nsuspected gout group (all from the first MTP\njoint). Thirty-six tophi found in the first\nMTP joint on US examination were con-\nfirmed by MSU crystal identification in 75%\nof participants. Aspiration of these tophi in\npatients with gout revealed MSU crystals in\nonly the DC sign present on US examin-\nation, crystals were found in 80% of cases\n(one crystal-negative sample was from the\nhealthy control group).

The authors found that the\nsensitivity for tophus, ``snowstorm,'' and the\nwith a gout symptom duration of <2 years,\nsensitivity was limited (tophus, 34%; snow-\nstorm, 32%; and DC sign, 51%). That study\ndid not evaluate the sensitivity and specifi-\ncity of multi-site investigation in the early\nstage. Comparison of the results of their\nstudy and ours is difficult because of the\ndifferent descriptions used for specific gout\nlesions and the different anatomical sites\ninvestigated. Our understanding of\n``tophus'' and ``DC sign'' is in line with the\ndefinitions proposed by the Outcome\nMeasures in Rheumatology (OMERACT)\ngroup13 except that we did not differentiate\n``tophus'' from ``aggregates,'' and some of\nour ``tophi'' could be considered ``aggre-\ngates'' according to the OMERACT cri-\nteria. The feasibility of the latter definition is\ndoubtful because the latest efforts of the\nOMERACT US group to validate the def-\ninitions of US gout lesions in patients\nshowed poor interobserver agreement for\n``aggregates.''13 The double-validity control\nperformed in our study exhibited good value\nfor specific US signs of MSU deposition:\n83% specificity for tophi and 86% specificity\nfor the DC sign according to healthy\nnormouricemic controls, and 80%\nconcordance of US tophi and the DC sign\naccording to synovial fluid investigation for\nMSU crystals.\nTo check the spread and specificity of US\nsigns of MSU deposition in different disease\nstages, we systemically scanned 36 joints\n(including the upper and lower extremities)\nand two tendons (patellar and triceps) in the\npresent study. We found a tophus and/or\nthe DC sign in at least one investigated\narea (40 sites) in 97% of patients with gout,\nwhich is comparable with the findings\njoints most often affected in the lower\nextremities, similarly reported in other stu-\nknees, and ankles. We identified fewer DC\nsigns in the first MTPs; the DC sign was\nfound in 35% of the joints in our whole gout\nvious reports.18,25 This last finding can\nbe explained by the shorter duration of\nsymptoms in our whole cohort. Because we\ninvestigated only the suprapatellar and\nparapatellar recesses (without the lateral\nand medial compartments) of the knee,\nwe reported many fewer intra-articular\nknee tophi than did the authors of some\nthat reported in the suprapatellar knee\nrecesses in one study.15 Our study confirms\nthe findings reported by Naredo et al.15, who\nstated that the wrists and second MCP joints\nare the most often affected joints in the\nupper extremities.\nOur direct comparison of the urate\ndeposit load (tophi or the DC sign) between\npatients with a disease duration of <2 versus\n>2 years, even with our relatively small\nnumber of participants, showed that urate\ndeposition was significantly lower in the\nearlier stage of the disease in all sites\n(including the upper and lower extremities\nand both investigated tendons). Tophi and\nthe DC sign were seldom or not found in the\nMCP or proximal interphalangeals in\npatients with early gout. Our examination\nfindings for small hand joints are compar-\nable with those of Ottaviani et al.,18 who\nfound no tophi or DC signs in MCP joints in\nearly gout.20 The most specific signs found\nin the present study included tophi and the\nDC sign in the knees, ankles, and foot joints,\nshowing up to 97% specificity for healthy\ncontrols. We found that the presence of a\ntophus in the first MTPs was the most\nsensitive US sign for gout in all stages,\nalthough it was less specific (83%) with the\nblinded assessment performed in our study\nthan in some previous studies reporting\n100% specificity for tophi in toes with a\nnonblinded investigator. False-positive\ntophi on US could be explained by degen-\nerative changes in a toe, which are found in\n17% of healthy persons, and confirmed by\nthe absence of crystals in synovial fluid\nin our study.\nTo create an optimal US test for early\ndiagnosis of gout, we first performed\nbinary logistic regression analysis for all\npatients with gout. The US predictors that\ncontributed to the regression model and\nwere therefore estimated to be independ-\nently associated with gout were tophi in\nthe first MTP joint, tophi in the triceps\ntendon, the DC sign in the ankle, the DC\nsign in the first MTP, and the DC sign in\nthe second MTP joint cartilage; these signs\nhad a sensitivity and specificity of 93% and\n78%, respectively. Parameters such as the\nDC sign in the knee, tophi in the wrist, and\ntophi in the patella did not improve the\ndiagnostic model for US gout classifica-\ntion. While testing the same predictors for\nearly gout classification (excluding patients\nwith a disease duration of >2 years), we\nfound that only two US signs--tophi in the\nMTP joint and the DC sign in the\nankle--were independently associated with\ngout in the final step of the regression\nanalysis, with a sensitivity of 84% and\nspecificity of 81%. This finding suggests\nthat the first MTP joint and ankle might be\nthe joints most often involved in gout at\nthe beginning of the disease. Both tests,\nincluding the one recommended for US\ngout classification in the literature15,16 and\nthe one tested in our cohort, showed good\nvalue and were comparable in terms of\nsensitivity and specificity in patients with a\ndisease duration of >2 years. The sensitiv-\nity of all diagnostic tests, including the\n(knees and first MTPs) investigation,15 and\nthe set of 5 joints, generated from the\nresults of our study was lower (80% versus\n100%, respectively) in patients with a\ndisease duration of 2 than >2 years.\nThe best balance between the sensitivity\n(84%) and specificity (81%) of early gout\ndiagnosis was reached with investigation of\nthe first MTPs for tophi and the ankles for\nthe DC sign in our study.\nSeveral limitations of our study should be\nmentioned. Twenty-one of 60 patients with\ngout (35%) were reportedly undergoing\nhypouricemic therapy, which might have\nhad an impact on US sensitivity;31,33 how-\never, most were not within the therapeutic\nwindow (87% of the patients had a UA\nconcentration of >360 mmol/L), and there\nwas no difference in the use of hypouricemic\ntreatment between the early and late gout\nsubgroups. For ethical reasons, all US\nassessments (long-lasting US assessment of\n40 sites) were performed by a single inves-\ntigator; however, validity control showed\ngood concordance between the US findings\nand crystal detection in the synovial fluid as\nwell as between the two investigators in the\nWeb-based exercise. The lack of a univer-\nsally accepted definition of tophus during\nthe planning phase of the study might have\nresulted in overestimation of the percentages\nof tophi found per participant because some\nof them might now be defined as aggre-\ngates.13 Finally, exclusion of the lateral and\nmedial knee compartments from the exam-\nination protocol in our study could have\nimpacted the final test results.\nThis study is the first attempt to compare\nthe spread of specific US gout symptoms in\nearly versus late gout using a multiple-site\ninvestigation. Our findings create a para-\ndigm for future US studies, suggesting that\nthe MSU deposition load increases propor-\ntionally with the disease duration at all\nanatomical sites, demonstrating the highest\nsensitivity in the first MTP joint and ankle\nin the early stage of the disease. The value\nof the diagnostic test for early gout proposed\nin our study should be assessed using\nthe most recent definition of tophus13 and\nin asymptomatic patients in the hyperurice-\nmic stage.\nConclusions\nThe present study has shown that the US\nsensitivity for specific US signs of MSU\ndeposition (tophus and the DC sign) was\nlower in patients with a gout symptom\nduration of 2 than >2 years.\nThe four-joint investigation, which\nincludes both first MTPs for tophi and both\nankles for the DC sign, is feasible and reliable\nand could be proposed as a screening test for\nearly US classification of gout in daily prac-\ntice based on the results of our study.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
