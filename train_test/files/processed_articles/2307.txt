In 1994,\nthe Federal Hazardous Substances Act\n(FHSA) was amended by the Child\nSafety Protection Act to require chok-\ning hazard warning labels on packag-\ning for small balls, balloons, marbles,\nand other toys and games that contain\nsmall parts when these items are\nintended for use by children in defined\nage groups.8 This act also bans any\ntoy intended for use by children aged\n,3 years that may pose a choking,\naspiration, or ingestion hazard. In addi-\ntion, the FHSA defines test of an object\nsize by using the small-parts test fixture,\nwhich simulates the mouth and pharynx\nof a small child.4 An object is considered\na small part if it fits completely within\nthe small-parts test fixture. Finally, the\nConsumer Product Safety Improvement\nchoking hazard warnings to be dis-\nplayed on or adjacent to Internet or\nprinted product advertisements that\nprovide a direct means for purchasing\na product for which the FHSA requires\na warning.4\nDespite these improvements in the\nsafety and labeling of nonfood items\ndistributed for children, studies have\ncontinually shown that the majority\nof foreign bodies that cause choking-\nrelated injuries are not toys but\nnonfatal choking episodes reported\namong children ages 0 to 14 years in\n438]) were associated with a food\nsubstance; candy/gum was the most\nfrequently cited food item.1 Food ac-\ncounted for 75.7% of nonfatal choking-\nrelated episodes among children ages\nage ,1 year.1 According to the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC), an average of 57 deaths among\nchildren ages 0 to 14 years due to in-\nhalation and ingestion of food causing\nobstruction of the respiratory tract oc-\nand nonfatal choking hazards to children\ninclude hot dogs, hard candy, nuts/\nseeds, certain raw fruits and vegeta-\nfoods that present a choking risk to\nchildren share many of the physical\ncharacteristics often described for\nhigh-risk toys: cylindrical in shape,\nairway sized, and compressible,\nallowing a tight and complete occlu-\nsion of a child's airway. Despite the\nfrequency of pediatric food-related chok-\ning, and the risk similarities to haz-\nardous toys, choking on food remains\na relatively underaddressed problem\nin the United States.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the cur-\nrent study is the first to comprehen-\nsively investigate nonfatal food-related\nchoking among children treated in US\nEDs over a multiyear period. The pre-\nvious study by the CDC evaluated non-\nfatal choking episodes among children\ndue to food and nonfood items during\nstudy provides a much more in-depth\nanalysis of nonfatal food-related chok-\ning over a 9-year period.\nMETHODS\nData Source\nNonfatal food-related choking data an-\nalyzed in this study were obtained from\nthe National Electronic Injury Surveil-\nlance System\u00adAll Injury Program\n(NEISS-AIP). The NEISS is operated by\nthe CPSC to provide nationally repre-\nsentative data on consumer product\u00ad\nrelated ED visits using a stratified\nprobability sample of 100 hospitals,\nincluding 7 children's hospitals, which\nhave 24-hour EDs with at least 6 beds in\nthe United States and its territories.16\nThe NEISS-AIP is a nationally represen-\ntative subsample of 66 of the NEISS\nhospitals, which collects data on all\ntypes and external causes of nonfatal\ninjuries treated in the participating\nEDs, regardless of consumer product\ninvolvement. Each year, the NEISS-AIP\nrelated ED visits. Trained NEISS-AIP\ncoders review all ED medical records\nat participating hospitals daily to ex-\ntract data, including age, gender, prin-\ncipal diagnosis, primary body region\naffected (eg, airway-related events for\nthe current study), consumer products\ninvolved (eg, food for the current study),\ndisposition at ED discharge, locale\nwhere the event occurred, and a short\nnarrative abstracted from the medical\nrecord describing the precipitating\nevent for each patient. Sample weights\nare applied to provide national esti-\nmates of nonfatal injuries treated in\nData Selection\nA food-related choking case for the\ncurrent study was defined as any\nnonfatalchokingeventpresenting toan\nNEISS-AIP hospital ED for children aged\n#14 years in which the patient choked\non or aspirated a food item (including\nliquids other than water) and/or a food\nitem was removed from the child's\nairway or throat. An initial data ex-\ntraction of the NEISS-AIP database from\nnonfatal cases with an unintentional in-\njury diagnosis that had a precipitating\ncause indicating suffocation/inhalation\nand a product code involving foods (ex-\ncluding hot water) or with the words\n\"choke\" or \"swallow\" identified by a\nkeyword search of the narratives. The\nnarrative description for each patient's\nchoking event was subsequently re-\nviewed by 1 of the study researchers to\nidentify food-related choking cases and\nclassify each case for type of food. Clas-\nsification of all cases was then reviewed\nby 3 other study researchers, and dif-\nferences in coding were resolved by\nconsensus. Case narratives that stated\ndifficulty breathing, foreign body sensa-\ntion, stuck in throat, or throat pain were\nretained. Cases in which the narrative\nindicated smoke inhalation, submer-\nsion, strangulation, a breath-holding\nspell, exposure to noxious or toxic sub-\nstances, or poisoning were excluded.\nCases were also excluded if the child\nchoked on an unknown or nonfood item\n(including vomitus), if food was found\nin the esophagus or ingested without\nmention of a foreign body sensation or\nchoking, or if the only symptom was\ndifficulty swallowing.\nVariables\nFor analysis, NEISS-AIP variables were\ncollapsed into broader categories to\nincrease statistical stability of national\nestimates. Consistent with previous\nresearch on choking on food in the\npediatric population, age was divided\nyear of age for those aged 1 to 14 years\nand month of age for children aged ,1\nyear were used to calculate mean ages.\nDisposition at ED discharge was col-\nlapsed into 3 categories: treated and\nreleased, hospitalized (including those\ntransferred to another hospital or held\nfor observation), and left against medi-\ncal advice. Event location was described\nas home, school (including day care\nsettings), and other. Case narratives\nwere used to generate a variable for\ntype of food. Type of food was classified\ninto 17 different categories: hard candy,\nother candy (eg, gum, soft candy), meat\n(other than hot dogs), hot dogs, bone,\nfruits/vegetables, formula (including\nmilk and breast milk), seeds/nuts/shells,\nchips/pretzels/popcorn, biscuits/cookies/\ncrackers, bread/pastries, french fries,\nnoodles/pasta, multiple specified foods,\nother foods, other/unspecified liquids,\nand unknown.\nStatistical Analysis\nStudy results were based on weighted\nNEISS-AIP cases. Statistical analyses\nwere performed by using SAS version\n9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) and\nSUDAANrelease10.0(ResearchTriangle\nInstitute, Research Triangle Park, NC)\nsoftware. Sample weights for NEISS-AIP\ncases were used to calculate national\nfood-related choking incidence esti-\nmates and risk ratios (RRs) with 95%\nconfidence intervals (CIs).16 Data re-\nported in this study are national esti-\nmates unless otherwise specified.\nMissing values were not included in\nmates acquired from the US Census\nRESULTS\nfood-related choking, with an average\nper day).

Al-\nthough not statistically significant, the\npercentage of female patients treated\nfor food-related choking episodes was\nhigher than that of male patients at\nseveral single age levels (ie, ,1 year,\n5 years, and 10 years) (Fig 1). The rate\nARTICLE\nof food-related choking episodes for\nmale subjects during the study period\nFood Type\nThe types of food that contributed to\nchoking episodes among children in\nthis study are shown in Table 1. Of all\nknown food types, hard candy caused\nthe most choking episodes (15.5%),\nfollowed by other candy (12.8%), meat\n(other than hot dogs) (12.2%), and\naccounted for more than one-half\n(52.5%) of choking episodes with\na known food type. The mean age of\nthose treated for food-related choking\nvaried according to food type. Children\nwith bone-induced choking episodes\nhad a mean age of 7.6 years, whereas\nthose with formula/milk/breast milk\u00ad\ninduced choking episodes had a mean\nage of 0.3 year (ie, 4 months). Although\nformula/milk/breast milk was re-\nsponsible for 6.7% of all food-related\nchoking, it accounted for more than\none-third (36.3%) of the choking epi-\nsodes among children aged ,1 year.\nHot dogs accounted for 2.6% of food-\nrelated choking (Table 1). Patients\nwho choked on a hot dog were more\nlikely to require hospitalization than\nthose who choked on another type of\naddition, patients who choked on a\nseed/nut/shell were more likely to re-\nquire hospitalization than those who\nchoked on another food type (RR = 2.58\nThe distribution of the most common\nfood types involved in choking episodes\namong patients ages 0 to 4 years, by\nyear of age, is displayed in Table 2.

By 3 to 4\nyears of age, children have developed\nmolars but are still learning to chew\nand swallow effectively. Children in this\nage range also may be easily dis-\ntracted and not focused on the task\nof eating. In addition, behavioral fac-\ntors, such as high activity levels while\neating, as well as developmental dis-\nabilities and neurologic conditions may\nincrease choking risk among young\nSimilar to the study by the CDC in\ncandy was the top contributor to\nnonfatal food-related choking epi-\nsodes. In addition to candy, our study\nalso identified meat, bone, and fruits/\nvegetables as common causes of non-\nfatal food-related choking episodes\namong children. Previous studies\nhave identified hot dogs, seeds, nuts,\ncandy, and raw fruits/vegetables as the\nmost common foods associated with\nfatal choking episodes.2\u00ad7,14 Seeds/nuts/\nshells and hot dogs were the seventh\nand 12th, respectively, most commonly\nnoted foods in our study of nonfatal\nNumberofchildrenpresentingtoUShospitalEDsforfood-relatedchoking,groupedaccordingtoageand\nepisodes. These differences in asso-\nciated foods between fatal and nonfatal\nchoking episodes may be due in part\nto the physical characteristics of\ncertain foods. Hot dogs, for example,\nare cylindrical in shape, similar in\ndiameter to a child's airway, and com-\npressible, allowing them to com-\npletely block a child's hypopharynx\nand resulting in an increased risk of\nfatal injury. Some high-risk foods are\nmore difficult to chew (eg, raw fruits\nand vegetables) or are frequently\nconsumed by the mouthful (eg, seeds,\nnuts, some candies), which may over-\nwhelma child's chewingandswallowing\nabilities, resulting in aspiration of food\nfragments.6\nAlthough the CPSC has well-established\nsurveillance systems in place, as well\naslegislationandregulationstoprotect\nchildren from nonfood-related choking,\nno similar monitoring systems, legis-\nlation, or regulations currently exist\nto address food-related choking among\nchildren. The American Academy of\nPediatrics (AAP) has proposed mea-\nsures to prevent pediatric food-related\nchoking.4 These recommendations in-\nclude instituting a mandatory system\nto label high-risk foods with appropri-\nate information regarding their choking\nrisk to children, detailed surveillance\nof food-related choking incidents, and\npublic awareness campaigns to educate\nthe public about food-related choking\nhazards. The AAP recommends that the\nUS Food and Drug Administration take\nthe lead on these measures, while\nworking closely with the US Depart-\nment of Agriculture (which has regula-\ntory jurisdiction over meat products)\nand the CPSC. In addition, more detail\nin the medical records collected in EDs\nabout the type of foods involved and\ncircumstances surrounding choking\nepisodes would help document the\nproblem and provide data relevant\nto developing interventions aimed at pre-\nventing food choking among children.

Child\ncaregivers should also be aware of\nfood choking prevention recommen-\ndationsandageguidelinesprovidedby\nprofessional organizations, such as\nthe AAP. For example, the AAP recom-\nmends that children ,5 years of age\nnot be given hard candies or gum\nand that raw fruits and vegetables be\ncut into small pieces.4 The current\nstudy provides evidence supporting\nthese recommendations. In addition,\nthe AAP recommends that young\nchildren should be supervised while\neating, should eat sitting down, and\nshould never run, walk, play, or\nlie down with food in their mouth.4\nIf a choking incident does occur,\ncaretakers can be prepared by being\nfamiliar with and practicing choking-\nrelated rescue maneuvers.\nStudy Limitations\nAs with all studies using prerecorded\ndata, the current study had some\nlimitations. First, we were unable to\ndocument all cases of choking on food,\nfor a number of reasons. For example,\nchoking episodes that resolved at\nhome or were treated in a medical\nfacility other than an ED were not in-\ncluded in this study. In addition, it\nwas sometimes difficult to discern\nwhat caused the choking event, which\npotentially excluded some true\nfood-related choking cases. The cases\nreported in the current study thus may\nnot be representative of all cases\nof food-related choking. Second, the\nshort narratives provided by the\nNEISS-AIP were unable to provide\nenough information for several addi-\ntional variables we attempted to code,\nincluding adult presence during the\nchoking event, concurrent activities of\nthe child when the choking occurred,\nhowthechildobtainedthefood,amount\nof time between the choking event and\nthe child presenting to the ED, whether\nthe food was prepared in a manner\nthought to reduce the likelihood of\nchoking,theuseandsuccessofchoking\nrescue maneuvers, and the perfor-\nmance of any diagnostic or therapeutic\nmedical procedures.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis is the first multiyear, nationally\nrepresentative study on nonfatal\nfood choking among children. The\nnonfatal choking-related injuries\nattributable to food occur each\nyear. Improved surveillance, food la-\nbeling and redesign, and public edu-\ncation are strategies that can help\nreduce pediatric food choking.\nREFERENCES\n1.
