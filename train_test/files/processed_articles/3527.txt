The real-time\nseismic monitoring network comprises 17 broadband Indian seismic stations transmitting real-time earthquake data through\nVSAT communication to the central receiving stations located at the Indian Meteorological Department, New Delhi, and\nthe Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services, Hyderabad, simultaneously for processing and interpretation.\nIn addition to this, earthquake data from around 300 global seismic stations are also received at the Indian National Center\nfor Ocean Information Services in near-real-time. Most of these data are provided by IRIS Global Seismographic Network\nand GEOFON Extended Virtual Network through Internet. The Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services\nuses SeisComP3 software for auto-location of earthquake parameters (location, magnitude, focal depth and origin time).\nAll earthquakes of Mw >5.0 are auto-located within 5\u00ad10minutes of the occurrence of the earthquake. Since its inception\nin October 2007 to date, the warning centre has monitored and reported 55 tsunamigenic earthquakes (under-sea and\nnear coast earthquakes of magnitude 6.5) in the Indian Ocean region. Comparison of the earthquake parameters (elapsed\ntime, magnitude, focal depth and location) estimated by the Indian Tsunami Early Warning System with the US Geological\nSurvey suggests that the Indian Tsunami Early Warning System is performing well and has achieved the target set up by the\nIntergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.\n",

Under-sea earthquakes account\nfor nearly 85% of the world's tsunamis (Whitmore etal.,\n2008), and tsunamis are less commonly caused by sub-\nmarine landslides, infrequently by submarine volcanic\neruptions and very rarely by a large meteorite impact in\nthe ocean (Nayak and Kumar, 2011). The Indian Ocean\nand displaced more than 1\nmillion people. In India, the\ntsunami devastated the coastal communities in Kerala,\nTamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Puducherry, and the\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands claiming nearly 18,000\nlives (National Disaster ManagementAuthority (NDMA),\n2010). In response to this great tragedy, the Government\nReal-time earthquake monitoring\nat the Indian Tsunami Early Warning\nSystem for tsunami advisories in\nthe Indian Ocean\nE Uma Devi, MV Sunanda, B Ajay Kumar, Ch Patanjali Kumar\nand T Srinivasa Kumar\n Keywords\nEarthquake, tsunami, seismic network\nIndian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS),\nHyderabad, India\nCorresponding author:\nE Uma Devi, Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services\n(INCOIS), Ocean Valley, Nizampet BO, Pragathi Nagar SO, Hyderabad\nEmail: umadevi@incois.gov.in\nOriginal Article\nof India established the Indian Tsunami Early Warning\nSystem (ITEWS) at the Indian National Centre for Ocean\nInformation Services (INCOIS), Hyderabad (Gupta,\n2005). The ITEWS comprises a real-time network of\nseismic stations, tsunami buoys, tide gauges and a 24\u00d77\noperational tsunami warning centre to detect tsunami-\ngenic earthquakes, to monitor tsunamis and to provide\ntimely advisories with back-end support of scenario data-\nbase, vulnerability modelling and decision support sys-\nThe concept\nWithin any tsunami early warning concept, but mainly\nfor a warning system for near-field tsunamis, the earth-\nquake monitoring system plays a central role (Hanka\netal., 2006). The time available to warn the population in\nthe near-field regions like the Andaman and Nicobar\nIslands after a tsunami has been generated by a large\nearthquake is extremely short since the expected tsunami\ntravel times are only of the order of 20\u00ad30min or even\nless. Therefore, tsunami watch or warning bulletins\nshould be issued preferably within 10\u00ad15min in order to\nbe able to initiate timely civil protection measures. These\nbulletins will initially be based primarily on rapidly\ndetermined earthquake parameters and on selected pre-\ncalculated tsunami scenarios which fit the initial seismic\nparameters (Behrens etal., 2010). The sea level sensor\ndata will be used in the later bulletins to warn the far field\nregions like the Indian mainland. These sea level data\nwill also be used to validate the model results and also\nhelp in giving the final ALL Clear advisory.\nThe seismic network\nObservation of the historical earthquake data sets in the\nIndian Ocean region indicates two potential source\nregions, namely, the Andaman\u00adNicobar\u00adSumatra island\narc and the Makran subduction zone north of the Arabian\nSea (Nayak and Kumar, 2008). The east and west coasts\nof India and the island regions are likely to be affected by\ntsunamis generated mainly by subduction zone\u00adrelated\nFigure 1. Historical seismicity indicating the tsunamigenic source regions in the Indian Ocean.\n22 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 7(1)\nearthquakes occurring in these zones (Figure 1). In order\nto monitor earthquakes occurring in these regions and to\nestimate earthquake parameters with reasonable accuracy\nin the shortest possible time, a well-distributed network\nof broadband seismic stations communicating data in\nreal-time is vital for the tsunami early warning system.\nINCOIS has established a land-based network of 17 seis-\nmic stations (Figure 2) in collaboration with the Indian\nMeteorological Department (IMD), New Delhi. All these\nstations transmit real-time data through VSAT\ncommunication to the central receiving stations (CRSs)\nlocated at IMD, New Delhi, and INCOIS, Hyderabad,\nsimultaneously for processing and interpretation. The\nstations are listed in Table 1. In order to have good azi-\nmuthal coverage of stations for quick and precise estima-\ntion of the earthquake parameters, the ITEWS has also\nconfigured stations from internationally coordinated net-\nworks like the IRIS, GEOFON and GSN networks, where\nreal-time data are received through the Internet.\nStation configuration\nEach field station is equipped with Trillium 240 broadband\nseismometer, Taurus seismograph, and necessary power\nand communication facilities. The seismometer is well\ncovered with thermal insulation and kept on `pier' for\ndirect contact with hard rock on the ground and shielded\nperfectly to avoid the thermal and pressure fluctuations\nand to protect it from other atmospheric effects. The seis-\nmometer continuously records ground motion with 100\nsamples/s in the frequency range of 0.01\u00ad50Hz with con-\nstant frequency response. The recorded data are stored in\nthe Taurus seismograph and transmitted continuously in\nautomatic mode to the CRS through VSAT communica-\ntion. The CRSs are equipped with state-of-the-art comput-\ning hardware, communication, data processing,\nvisualisation and dissemination facilities. The field equip-\nment can be accessed from the CRS remotely at any point\nof time and perform functions such as calibration of sen-\nsors including centring of mass, inspecting the state of\nhealth and downloading the seismic data from field sta-\ntions. The schematic diagram at each station is given in\nFigure 2. Location map of the Indian seismic stations for\ntsunami early warning.\nTable 1.

SeisComP3 software is configured\nfor real-time data reception, archiving, processing and\nauto-location using the national and international sta-\ntions. Any earthquake of magnitude >5.0 occurring on\nthe globe is auto-located within 5\u00ad10\nmin using this\nsoftware. The earthquake parameters are displayed\n(Figure 4) with an alarm notification to alert the warning\ncentre operators. The system can compute almost all\ntypes of magnitudes such as the local magnitude (ML),\nbody wave magnitude (mb), broadband body wave mag-\nnitude (mB), broadband p-wave magnitude (Mwp), sur-\nface wave magnitude (MS) and moment magnitude\n(Mw). After the auto-location is given by the system, the\noperators can review the earthquake waveforms to refine\nFigure 3. Schematic diagram of broadband sensor set-up at each field station.\nFigure 4.

As part of its regional ser-\nvices, the ITEWS compares its estimated earthquake\nparameters (elapsed time, magnitude, focal depth and\nlocation) with those of the US Geological Survey\n(USGS) to maintain its regional performance (targets\nitored 475 earthquakes of magnitude 6.5 all over the\nglobe (both land and ocean). Out of these earthquakes,\n55 are in the Indian Ocean region (both Ocean and near\ncoast). A summary of the performance of the warning\ncentre against key performance indicators since it\n(22 earthquakes), is given in Table 2.\nIt is evident from Table 2 that the parameters estimated\nby the ITEWS seismic network are very well within the\ntarget set up by IOC-ICG/IOTWS-V/13. Elapsed time is\nthe time span between origin time of the earthquake and\ninitial earthquake information issuance. It is observed that\nthe average elapsed time of the ITEWS is 8.3min, which\nis within the target of 10/15min, while the USGS has an\nelapsed time of 10min. The average difference in magni-\ntude of the ITEWS estimate with the USGS is 0.30, which\nalso achieves the target of 0.3. The average focal depth\ndifference with the USGS is 19.8km (Figure 5(a)), which\nis within the target value of 25km. A comparison of earth-\nquake location estimated by the ITEWS with the USGS\nindicates that the average difference in location is within\nthe target of 30km (Figure 5(b)).\nAs a case study, we will discuss the ITEWS perfor-\nmance during the large strike-slip earthquakes of mag-\n2012 in the Indian Ocean region. The former earth-\nquake generated a small ocean-wide tsunami that has\nbeen recorded by various tide gauges and tsunami\nbuoys located in the Indian Ocean region. The ITEWS\ndetected this earthquake within 3\nseconds and\nlocated it within 7\nmin from its occurrence with the\nhelp of `SeisComP3' auto-location software. The initial\nmagnitude of this earthquake was estimated as Mw\n(mB) 8.7 with a focal depth of 10km. Both the national\nand regional earthquake information bulletins were\nissued after 8min of the occurrence of the earthquake\nmin prescribed by\nthe IOC. The earthquake parameters were reviewed,\nand considering the tsunami model results, the second\nbulletin was issued at 12\nmin with the revised earth-\nquake magnitude as Mw (mB) 8.5 with threat informa-\ntion considering the earthquake as thrust fault as it\noccurred in the subduction zone. Furthermore, the real-\ntime waveforms were analysed and noted that the earth-\nquake occurred with strike-slip faulting and concluded\nthere was no threat of an ocean-wide tsunami. But con-\nsidering the tsunami model results and the real-time sea\nlevel observations, only a few parts of Andaman and\nNicobar Islands were advised to evacuate. The ITEWS\nissued further bulletins according to its Standard\nOperating Procedure and avoided unnecessary evacua-\ntions to the mainland. This event once again proved the\nefficiency of the ITEWS.\nSummary\nThe ITEWS established at the INCOIS with all the neces-\nsary computational and communication infrastructure is\nperforming satisfactorily since its inception in October\n2007. The real-time seismic monitoring network is con-\ntinuously providing data and achieved its design goals.\nThe earthquake monitoring capability of the ITEWS is\nsignificantly improved with the real-time seismic net-\nwork, in particular with respect to the potential tsunami-\ngenic earthquake\u00adgenerating regions.\n"
