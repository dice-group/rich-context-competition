    "abstract": "Abstract. The predictive coding model is increasingly and fruitfully used to explain a wide range\nof findings in perception. Here we discuss the potential of this model in explaining the mechanisms\nunderlying aesthetic experiences. Traditionally art appreciation has been associated with concepts\nsuch as harmony, perceptual fluency, and the so-called good Gestalt. We observe that more often\nthan not great artworks blatantly violate these characteristics. Using the concept of prediction error\nfrom the predictive coding approach, we attempt to resolve this contradiction. We argue that artists\noften destroy predictions that they have first carefully built up in their viewers, and thus highlight\nthe importance of negative affect in aesthetic experience. However, the viewer often succeeds in\nrecovering the predictable pattern, sometimes on a different level. The ensuing rewarding effect\nis derived from this transition from a state of uncertainty to a state of increased predictability. We\nillustrate our account with several example paintings and with a discussion of art movements and\nindividual differences in preference. On a more fundamental level, our theorizing leads us to consider\nthe affective implications of prediction confirmation and violation. We compare our proposal to other\ninfluential theories on aesthetics and explore its advantages and limitations.\n",

If we take \"good Gestalt\" (Pr\u00e4gnanz) to mean\nhaving regular, clear, symmetrical, and simple forms, as it is conventionally defined, this\nseems to exclude an abundance of artworks (ranging from traditional to modern) from ever\nbeing beautiful to human eyes. Why is it that artworks, prime instances of beauty, often\ncontain precisely these violations that are supposed to \"hurt our sense of beauty\"?\nWe will suggest a way out of this conundrum based on a view on visual art that is firmly\nrooted in cognitive neuroscience. It will be less reductionistic than other proposals in that\nart will not be explained by piecemeal activations in separate visual areas on a specific level\nof visual processing but by taking into account the bidirectional, hierarchical nature of the\nvisual system as it is implemented in the predictive coding approach. The former approach\nis doomed to fail for at least two reasons. First, an activation, however strong, of one or\nmore of the visual processing areas is clearly not sufficient for an object or event to pass as\nartwork may indeed activate area V5/MT, but a passing bicycle would activate those motion-\nprocessing areas even more strongly and would not be considered a work of art.\" Second,\nwe are indeed never confronted with the isolated raw visual input; rather, our visual system\n(and the brain as a whole) actively but effortlessly organizes it into surfaces, motions, three-\ndimensional objects, and concepts. Our proposal will center on these processes of perceptual\norganization (rather than the representational or symbolic meaning of their \"end-products\").\nThe rationale for this is found in Redies (2007, p 3), who calls for a broadly applicable theory\n(from cave art to Kandinsky) \"as universal as aesthetic judgment itself.\" He notes that since\nalmost any (visual) stimulus can be used to compose aesthetically pleasing objects, aesthetic\nperception may rely on general aspects of information processing that are implemented in\nall visual channels and regions. Redies adds that aesthetic perception requires the processing\nof global features encompassing interactions between large amounts of receptive fields. By\ngrounding our proposal in the formal, organizational characteristics of visual information\nprocessing as hypothesized by the predictive coding framework, we will attempt to meet\nthese requirements.\nPerceptual processes alone would hardly give us aesthetic experiences, though. Together\nwith anthropologist Dissanayake, we claim that \"much is overlooked when aesthetic cog-\nnition is conceptualized simply as 'sensory' or 'perceptual'...\" (Dissanayake 2009, p 163). A\none-sided emphasis on perception neglects the emotional aspects that are the motivating\ndrives for creating and enjoying art in the first place. Artistic expressions attract and hold\nattention and stir and shape emotion. Consequently, any theory of art must explicitly\nelucidate the crucial interactions between perceptual and emotional processes. Luckily\nfor our purposes, recent data suggest vision may be intrinsically affective (Barrett and Bar\n2009), in the sense that the processing of emotional relevance and value is not an afterthought\nin the visual processing hierarchy but can actually drive object formation and recognition.\nOur challenge will be to specify the emotional consequences of the formal, organizational\nmechanisms of the predictive coding view, bracketing the emotional or symbolic content of\nthe representations involved.\n2 Predictive coding\nThe predictive coding approach of perception holds that the brain actively anticipates\nupcoming sensory input rather than passively registers it. On the basis of prior experience,\nthe brain actively makes predictions about what visual input to expect in the current context\nof stimulation. At every level of the visual hierarchy predictions are generated and propagated\n(top-down) to lower levels, where they are checked against incoming (bottom-up) evidence.\nThe idea is that these predictions suppress or explain away the activity in lower areas\nthat agrees with them (de-Wit et al 2010), while what remains and is sent upward are the\nmismatches between these predictions and the current input, also called the prediction\nerrors. This way the processing resources (attention) can be directed to that part of the\nstimuli that has not been sufficiently explained (predicted), and thus still has to be learnt.\nThrough constantly fine-tuning predictions using the mismatches, the brain becomes tuned\nto statistical regularities of our natural visual environment. These predictions structure\nthe perceptual input in patterns that allow for predictability both within and across visual\ndisplays. Thus, the classic concept of Gestalt, traditionally defined as a (experiential) whole\nthat is different from the parts, can be recast in terms of predictive coding (Van de Cruys and\nWagemans in press).\nThis framework is fruitfully adopted to explain several findings on visual processing\n(but also auditory perception [cf Winkler et al 2009; Kumar et al 2011]). It can account for\nextra-classical receptive field effects measured with single-cell recordings in the primary\nvisual cortex (Rao and Ballard 1999) but also for fMRI patterns of activation across the\nvisual hierarchy. For example, Murray et al (2004) observed that perceptual grouping is\naccompanied by an increase in activity in higher tier object-sensitive areas (LOC) and\nconcomitant decreases of activity in lower visual areas (V1), as predicted by a predictive\ncoding view. Furthermore, the well-known phenomenon of repetition suppression can\nbe explained by a reduction of neural activity for predictable stimuli (Summerfield et al\n2008). Similarly, Alink et al (2010) cleverly used an apparent motion path to generate strong\npredictions about when and where a visual stimulus will be, demonstrating that stimuli\nevoke smaller responses in V1 when they have an onset time that matches these predictions.\nThe more traditional theory of (neural activity in) perception as the piecemeal accumulation\nof evidence with visual neurons functioning primarily as feature detectors would have great\ndifficulties in explaining this series of evidence. In contrast, in predictive coding, perception is\nan iterative matching process of top-down predictions checked against bottom-up evidence\nalong the visual hierarchy. Consequently, each level in the visual cortical hierarchy has a\ntwofold computational role: first, it provides predictions (the conditional probability of a\nstimulus) regarding expected inputs to the next lower level, and second, it encodes the\nmismatch between predictions and bottom-up evidence (the prediction error or \"surprise\").\nEgner et al (2010) explicitly set out to compare performance of a predictive coding model\nwith the traditional model. They found that when subjects strongly expected to see a face,\nfMRI activity in the face-selective fusiform area was indistinguishable when actually viewing\na face versus a house, while maximally differentiated when the expectation of seeing a face\nwas low. Using computational modeling, the authors conclude that this pattern of results\ncan only be accounted for by the predictive coding model, which says that the total neural\nactivity in category-selective areas represents the sum of activity related to prediction (\"face\nexpectation\") and that related to prediction error (\"face surprise\").\nAt the heart of predictive coding is the concern for ease (efficiency) of processing. As\ndescribed earlier, neural resources needed for processing predictable stimuli are minimized,\nas our system gradually becomes optimized to the statistics of our natural perceptual\nenvironment. In addition to that, the predictive coding strategy is parsimonious because\ndifferent levels of the processing stream do not need to keep duplicates of information,\nmaintained in higher regions (de-Wit et al 2010). In light of evolution, being able to encode\nand process sensory information in an efficient way is vital for the costly organ the brain is.\nBeing able to successfully predict is another obvious evolutionary advantage, as it allows\nanimals not only to react after the fact to stimuli that change the internal milieu (homeostasis)\nbut also to prepare (anticipate and compensate) for those that are very likely to ensue. Thus,\nhomeostasis urges organisms that can walk around and manipulate their environment to\ntake a predictive stance. Friston's (2010a) generalization of the predictive coding framework\nstarts from homeostasis, or the realization that only a limited set of all the states an organism\ncan be in is compatible with its continued existence. The long-term goal of reducing the time\nspent in \"surprising\" states translates into the short-term goal of reducing prediction errors.\nThis holds for single-celled organisms as well as for complex mammals, like humans, who\nevidently can rely on a greatly enhanced predictive capacity (Cerra and Bingham 1998). Based\non statistical regularities in the environment, organisms form predictions on the where, when,\nand what of future resources, compensating for the inherent variability in the availability of\nthese resources. Complete predictability implies that any disturbances of internal milieu are\nfully compensated for (by plasticity or action). Propagated prediction errors tell our system\nwhether our current cognitive resources are up to the task of interpreting and coping with\nincoming stimuli or whether extra effort is needed. This effort can take the form of learning,\nwhen changing the predictions (our internal generative model of our environment), but it\ncan also be behavioral effort, when actions are executed to change the things predicted or\nIf we acknowledge that predictive coding is ultimately founded on homeostasis and the\nvital maintenance functions of the body, it should be no surprise that we can link this view\nto emotions. Indeed, to understand aesthetic emotion (appreciation), we need to make this\nlink explicit.\n3 Prediction and emotion\nEmotions can be seen as motivational amplifiers (Huron 2006). They motivate organisms\nto pursue behaviors that are normally adaptive and to avoid behaviors that are normally\nmaladaptive. When they form accurate predictions, organisms can efficiently react to\nupcoming events, thereby increasing the likelihood of future positive outcomes. Hence,\nit would be wise for evolution to reward cases in which predictions are confirmed in actual\ncircumstances. Meanwhile, our failures in predicting situations may be characterized by\nnegative emotion, because they signal that there is something wrong with the mental model\nwe use to generate the predictions. It follows that prediction errors are always to some extent\nnegative in affective valence. Adopting a better-safe-than-sorry strategy, nature tends to\nassume the worst because the cost of a false negative (type II error) is potentially much larger\nthan that of a false alarm (type I error). In a conservative reflex, the first, quick reaction to\nprediction violation or error is negative (Huron 2006). This is also reflected by the so-called\nconflict theories of emotion (for a historical review see Mandler 2003), which claim that\nemotions arise from interruptions or discrepancies between expected and actual situations.\nBy studying the continuous intrinsic activity of the brain, Hebb realized that the brain was\nproactively involved in processing incoming stimuli, rather than just passively responding\nto them. According to him, thought consists of so-called phase sequences: sequential\nactivations of neural structures (cell assemblies) that are built up as a result of previous\nexperience and learning. Each assembly activation may be aroused by a preceding assembly,\nby a sensory event, or by both. Negative emotions arise, then, from the interference with\n(obstruction of) such an established phase sequence. Although the terms used may seem\nquite peculiar to modern ears, Hebb's view is consistent with the approach described earlier\nof implicit formation of predictions and their confirmation or obstruction.\nMandler (2003) elaborated on this theory, arguing that interruptions of ongoing response\ntendencies and conflicts between expectations and actual circumstances create arousal\nbecause they signal important changes in the environment that must be acted upon.\nDepending on the cognitive context and the situation, the arousal is subsequently evaluated\nas positive or negative. Two important differences must be noted between Mandler's theory\nand ours. First, the basis for the generated expectations in Mandler's view are cognitive\nschemata. We choose the broader term \"predictions\" because it can be used for both\nsensory predictions (in predictive coding) and conceptual (high-level) predictions based on\ncognitive schemata. Consequently, the term prediction is also more neutral with regard to\nthe conscious access to the predictions. Second, we described any discrepancy (prediction\nerror) as negatively valenced, while for Mandler discrepancies generate undifferentiated\narousal, which is later interpreted as either positive or negative. The same discrepancy may\nproduce differently valenced emotions depending on the circumstances and the cognitive\ncontext. Instead, we argue that any discrepancy (surprise) is initially experienced as negative,\neven when a situation is not accurately predicted but in fact better than expected. Instantly\nafterward, a reappraisal will take place, converting this into a positive experience and actually\nmore positive than when it would not have been preceded by a negative one. This contrast\neffect will be made more explicit in our discussions of visual art.\nIn general, the pleasure associated with visual configurations seems to be dependent\non the perceptual and emotional dynamics involved. In a similar view, Kubovy defines\nthe pleasures of the mind as \"collections of emotions distributed over time whose global\nevaluation depends on the intensity of the peak emotion and favorability of the end\" (Kubovy\n1999, p 138). Transitions, rather than static states of stimulation, are needed for these kinds\nof pleasures. Applied to our context of predictions, positive emotions are experienced when\nwe have succeeded in reinstating predictability (solving the prediction error). In slightly\nprovocative terms we could say that resistance (of prediction errors) breeds liking.\nAnother way of thinking about this is that gains in efficiency, the sparing use of resources,\nare rewarded. If the visual system manages to find a sparse explanation of previously\nunpredictable stimuli, this genuinely appears to feel good. Similar thoughts have been\nexpressed in the literature on processing fluency (Reber et al 2004). According to these\nauthors, stimuli are preferred more if they are processed more easily. Because of this, familiar,\nsymmetrical, clear-cut (high-contrast), or prototypical (average) stimuli are thought to be\nliked most. The mere exposure effect (Zajonc 1968) is cited as evidence for this position,\nseeing that improved processing of a stimulus because of repeated presentations leads to\nincreased preference for this stimulus. At least in case of simple stimuli and subliminal\nexposures, the mere exposure effect has ample empirical support (Bornstein 1989). If we\ntranslate this into the terms of the predictive coding framework, an increase in processing\nfluency amounts to an increase in predictability (reduced prediction error), but the fluency\naccount has largely disregarded the dynamics of fluency. Recently, however, some processing\nfluency theorists acknowledged the importance of this in the context of the research on the\ninsight experience (the Aha-Erlebnis). Topolinski and Reber (2010) report that a surprising\ngain in fluency increases positive affect and the judged truth of the solution found. Since\nthis positive affect sets in before any (conscious) assessment of the \"insightful\" solution has\ntaken place, they argue this positive effect cannot be solely due to the positive feeling of\npride.\nInterestingly, discovering the solution of a neutral two-tone image (cf Gregory's cam-\nouflaged dalmatian) is accompanied by amygdala activity, and the strength of this activity\npredicts long-term memory for the organized stimulus (Ludmer et al 2011). Although the\nstudy referred to did not directly probe possible associated (positive) affect, it is well estab-\nlished that the amygdala intervenes in reward processing just as well as in fear processing\n(Baxter and Murray 2002; Sander et al 2003). Here, the amygdala might signal the goodness of\nthe solution found in terms of representational efficiency, and phenomenologically this may\nbe experienced as positive. A reduction of uncertainty, or equivalently, a gain in predictability,\nmight account for the positive experience of the Aha-Erlebnis. That perceptual insight,\nirrespective of the emotionality of stimuli involved as such, is processed by the same neural\nstructures as those responding to the beneficial biological value of stimuli (Baxter and\nMurray 2002) is intriguing. It points to the importance of this kind of perceptual and neural\n(re)organization in economizing representations.\nSo far, we infer that a (temporary) state of unpredictability (prediction error) can be\nas important for the emergence of perceptual pleasure as is the predictability. This might\nparticularly be the case for artworks, in which the presence of discrepancies would otherwise\nbe difficult to explain. Earlier (Van de Cruys and Wagemans in press) we used the example\nof earworms: the melodies that keep haunting us. They may be great Gestalts (extreme\npredictability), but they are rarely described as beautiful. We will delve deeper into the role\nof (un)predictability later on, using artworks as examples.\nMore neural evidence that (un)predictability is an important factor in emotion has been\naccumulating. For example, a recent study found sustained amygdala activity for temporally\nunpredictable tones in humans and mice in comparison with rhythmic (predictable)\ntones (Herry et al 2007). Moreover, both humans and mice show increased anxiety-related\nresponses in a standard anxiety test when these unpredictable (versus predictable) tones\nwere played in the background. Other subcortical areas also seem to be involved in the\nprocessing of prediction errors. Research on reward processing has found that dopamine\nneurons in the ventral tegmental area encode the deviations between actual received rewards\nand the expected reward. The reward prediction errors may be crucial signals for learning\nabout rewards (Schultz et al 1997). Another region implicated in reward processing, the\nputamen, was reported to be more active whenever a tone was not followed by the stimulus\ntype it predicted in an experiment only using entirely neutral, unrewarded stimuli (den\nOuden et al 2010). Similarly, plasticity in the amygdala in the context of fear learning seems\nto be driven by prediction errors originating in the peri-aquaductal gray (McNally et al 2011).\nKapp et al (1992) show that amygdala responses wane once contingencies have been fully\nlearned--in other words once stimuli are perfectly predicted--and are reinstated only when\nexternal associations change (when predictions fail).\nThe studies reviewed so far point to an interesting stance, namely that predictions and\nprediction errors are omnipresent in the brain as has been suggested by several scholars (Bar\n2007; Friston 2010a). We have come across predictions in perception--in reward and fear\nprocessing and in cognitive schemata. In social and developmental psychology we encounter\na long tradition of theorizing about cognitive schemata giving rise to expectations and about\nthe general tendency to reduce dissonance (see, for example, Kagan 2002; Proulx et al 2010),\nwhich can also be reconceptualized in terms of predictions and errors. Although a rigorous\ncomparison of these concepts still awaits to be done, we can discern a common theme in all\nof these studies. The brain's main trade is to predict impending circumstances based on prior,\nsimilar experiences. Cases in which this goes awry are significant and therefore emphasized\nby emotion. The organism has to deal with these mismatches by action (assimilation) or\nby updating its mental model (accommodation through learning). To show that predictive\ncoding is a pervasive mechanism of mental function might seem of lesser importance for\nthe current purposes. Yet, as an explanation for emotion in art, which evidently works on\ndifferent perceptual and non-perceptual levels, a theory that encompasses more than purely\nperceptual principles has substantial appeal.\nFinally, this line of reasoning provides a way for visual processing to influence (and be\ninfluenced by) emotion. Duncan and Barrett (2007) already remarked that in brain anatomy\nthe boundaries between emotion and cognition seem to dissolve. Conceiving perception in\nterms of predictions and mismatches opens up a path for perceptual configurations to induce\ndifferent sequences of affect, partly independent of the particular contents of perception. It is\nthis link we want to explore with aesthetic appreciation of visual art as a concrete application.\nNote that in what follows we do not aim to explain all possible emotions in art (if indeed\nsuch a thing would ever be possible). We focus on perceptual features of art and only briefly\ntouch upon content, which can, of course, induce a whole range of emotions, from very\nstraightforward ones (as, for example, in paintings of nudes) to very complex ones (as in\npaintings portraying social settings). Here, we are not interested in intrinsic or associative\naffective value of the content as such, although we agree that real impressive and expressive\nart embodies an important interaction between stylistic aspects (perceptual) and thematic\nones (see below). Some other affects that we will not talk about but that can show up when\ncontemplating works of art have been listed by Jackendoff and Lerdahl (2006)--for example,\nthe admiration of craftsmanship, emotions linked to nostalgic memories associated with a\nparticular work, social emotions of belonging to (or differentiating oneself from) a group, etc.\nThese different affects probably interact when viewing art, and in the process the sources may\nbe lost, which means that affect caused by one factor can enhance or diminish affect caused\nby another. Granted that these different emotions are difficult to disentangle in our actual\nexperiences with art, here we are concerned only with the ways in which the perceptual or\ncognitive organization can provoke emotions.\n4 An application to visual art\nVisual art is in many ways different from the visual input we ordinarily receive from our natu-\nral environment. We want to focus on the prediction errors, more often called incongruities,\nubiquitous in art. When we talk of incongruities in the context of art, surrealistic paintings\nspring to mind. Or perhaps Duchamps' La Fontaine, a porcelain urinal, an object one would\nnever have expected to belong in an art exhibition, let alone to be called \"beautiful\". However,\nmuch more subtle kinds of incongruities play in many other styles as well. As a first example,\ntake the painting below by Morandi (Figure 1). In his still lifes he often used subtle differences\nin hues or texture for figure and background, which makes the perception very unstable. The\nprediction error resides in those dissolving boundaries and more generally in the fact that\nMorandi twists expectations of how still-life paintings are defined traditionally.\nWhy do painters repeatedly and deliberately create such obstacles for us? As we saw,\ncurrent theories of predictive coding in visual perception assume that our brain aims at\nreducing prediction errors. In art, however, even though we (or rather, the artists) fully\ncontrol the stimuli, we intentionally create prediction errors that may not even be possible\nin the natural visual environment. So in art we do not always manipulate stimuli in ways that\nreduce prediction errors. Why so? And why does this not imply that we experience most art\nas unpleasant, as would be the case if all prediction error was negative? The common answer\nis that in going to a museum, we expect the unexpected. In this limited domain and time\nspan, we can tolerate and even enjoy unpredictability because we expect to be surprised in\nevery new exhibition hall. Furthermore, in these settings there is no need for urgent actions.\nPrediction errors in art do not need to be acted upon as in real life. This playful and safe\nas-if context of art, where our guards can be lowered and our actions suspended, allows\nfor the usually negative prediction errors to be enjoyed. Hence, a positive reappraisal can\nimmediately follow the negative gut reaction. But why take this detour? The frequent use\nof prediction errors in art and their relation to appreciation deserve to be explicated more\nthoroughly.\n4.1 From auditory to visual pleasures\nWe propose that while prediction error is always annoying or unpleasant initially and\nconfirmed predictions are pleasurable as such (mostly independent of their content),\nprediction errors or delayed prediction confirmation can be an important tool for artists to\namplify the subsequent positive affect of prediction confirmation, in a sort of contrast effect\n(Huron 2006). For developing the current view, we are much indebted to Leonard Meyer and\nhis treatment of emotion in music (Meyer 1961). He already invoked expectancy violations\nto explain emotion expressed in music. Tensions are created in music by first establishing a\nstrong pattern in rhythm and melody (a scale based on the tonic) and subsequently deviating\nfrom it. The role of expectancy violations might have been realized in music first because\nmusical patterns are spread out in time, so the dynamics of predictions and deviations thereof\nare easier to notice. However, they also play in visual perception, albeit on a millisecond time\nscale. For example in Day and Night by Escher (Figure 2), every new bird-like form the visual\nsystem encounters confirms and strengthens the (later destroyed) parsimonious prediction.\nAn experience of deep aesthetic appreciation is not so easily reproduced in the lab.\nOne more reason music might be more tractable in the lab than visual art is that music\nhappens to be the art form in which an aesthetic experience can be best elicited in an\nintense, more or less controlled and reliable (repeatable) fashion. These experiences known\nas music \"chills\" or \"shivers-down-the-spine\" have been successfully used to explore the\nneural and cognitive underpinnings of music appreciation (Blood and Zatorre 2001; Huron\n2006). Cognitively, Sloboda (1991) found that these chills are strongly correlated with marked\nviolations of expectation. Neurally, Blood and Zatorre (2001) reported that they are associated\nwith increases in cerebral blood flow in regions involved in reward processing (ventral\nstriatum) and decreases in amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Similar to the study\nby Ludmer et al (2011) discussed earlier, changes in predictability of stimuli elicit a pattern of\nactivity characteristic of processing biologically relevant, survival-related stimuli.\nWhile musicians use uncertainty on the when (rhythm) and the what (melody, volume)\nto evoke emotions in their listeners (Huron 2006), visual artists utilize uncertainty on the\nwhere (spatial) and the what (object indeterminacy, see below) with the same intent. Below\nwe will discuss a series of examples, elucidating the workings of this artistic \"tool\".\nIn Separation by Munch (Figure 3) there is a (mild) violation of grouping by similarity of\ncolor and form; however, we have no problems finding out what the objects are. Artists seem\nto like using strong predictions, either by building them themselves through repetition,\nas in the Escher painting above, or by using a well-known conceptual domain in their\npainting and thereby relying on existing strong predictions. In Munch's Separation we find\nthis combination of a familiar pattern (strong predictions) together with a minimal deviation\nof default expectations, which makes the painting attention-grabbing and memorable.(1)\nIn his Weeping Woman (Figure 4) Picasso arguably counts on our specialized face-\nprocessing systems (fusiform face area) to project its guesses on what belongs where in a face\nbased only on some fragmentary cues. The viewer quickly runs into incongruencies, which\npresumably generate arousal aimed at reducing the prediction errors. This style-induced\narousal could add up the emotionality of the contents, because despite the \"errors,\" we can\nstill recognize the emotional expression portrayed. We can contrast this with Ramachandran\nand Hirstein's (1999) explanation invoking the peak shift phenomenon. In this account,\nPicasso's face derives its emotionality from being a superstimulus, activating visual face\nprocessing systems very strongly because input from multiple viewpoints is merged in\none image. This explanation for art is refuted by Hyman (2010), who observes that artistic\ndepictions often deviate too far from the norm to be examples of peak shift (which is, as\nHyman reviews, a very specific phenomenon in animal behavior). In our view it is precisely\nthe incompatibility (prediction error) that causes part of the emotionality in this (and other)\npaintings.\nPredictive coding is an intrinsically hierarchical, multi-level model (Lee and Mumford\n2003) in the sense that implicit predictions are generated and checked on every level in the\nvisual system, from low-level feature-related to mid-level configurational predictions, up\nto high-level concrete and abstract semantic predictions. Importantly, predictions on every\nlevel are partly encapsulated (Jackendoff and Lerdahl 2006), such that even when we are very\nfamiliar with a painting (eg, Blanc Seing by Magritte [Figure 5]), and the visual input is in\nfact not unexpected any more, we are subject to these dynamics. That is, our visual system\nunconsciously computes its moment-to-moment predictions and errors regardless of the\nviewer's conscious memory.\n(1)Of course, there is more to the paintings we discuss than the aspects we zoom in on. We just want\nto draw attention to a possible commonality in these pieces, which can appeal to both laymen and\nexperts.\nVincent van Gogh in The Olive Trees (Figure 6) plays with perceptual grouping by similarity\n(parallel waves) breaching the borders of the objects as defined by color and by our top-down\nknowledge of what the objects are in the scene (trees, fields, sky). In this light, differences\nbetween art movements and artists might also be interpreted in terms of differences in\nthe amount and kind of prediction errors primarily used. The evolution of movements\ncan be understood within our framework, recalling that predictions are dependent on the\nspecific history of stimulation, and therefore on cultural and personal experience. Recall\nthat van Gogh (and numerous other great artists) did not enjoy any recognition from his\ncontemporaries. He was mocked and died in obscurity. Predictions evolve, and what was a\nprediction error once can now be the canonical form of expression and thus fully predictable.\nThese shifts partly explain why artistic taste varies widely in different eras and within the\nsame era, between experts and laymen. In the predictive coding approach all perception\nis a form of expert perception (Clark 2011), in the sense that it is always determined by an\nindividual's expectations built up through a lifetime of implicit statistical learning.\nFigure 6. The Olive Trees (1889), Vincent van Gogh.\nA certain kind or amount of prediction error can be upgraded intentionally or uninten-\ntionally to being the norm, the predictable standard, only for those who have developed the\nallegedly exquisite sensitivities and expertise needed to appreciate or grasp these artworks\n(ie, seeing the underlying predictable structure). This role of aesthetic taste in creating\nsocial distinction and status is defended by the sociologist Bourdieu (1984), who argues\nthat by openly declaring oneself an aficionado of difficult and inaccessible artworks people\nreassert their membership in society's upper classes. It also figures in current theories on the\nevolutionary role of art as an expensive and time-consuming status symbol, not unlike the\n4.3 Inter-individual differences and the optimum of (un)predictability\nWe can derive two important hypotheses from the previous. First, it follows that individuals\nare likely to have an optimal amount of unpredictability that they most appreciate. Too\nmuch prediction error is unpleasant or even disturbing; none or too little is boring (neither\npositive nor negative). This relates to psychological or subjective complexity, an important\ndeterminant of people's aesthetic evaluations (Gaver and Mandler 1987). The psychological\ncomplexity is a function of both actual stimulus complexity and personal experience with the\nclass of stimuli involved. The predictability of the work of art increases with the observer's\nknowledge of the correlational structure built up through exposure. An optimum of mild\nviolation of predictions will be experienced as most pleasant, because the experiencer\nmanages to return to a familiar mental schema. Therefore, for a given piece of art, we will also\nsee an evolution of liking through repeated exposure, with initially an increase of preference\nand motivation to enjoy the piece time and again, but as predictability further increases\nappreciation will diminish again. A similar evolution of preference has been reported by\nBerlyne (1970) relating complexity and novelty to arousal. He hypothesized that stimuli of\nmoderate complexity engender a moderate amount of arousal, which is optimally pleasing.\nBerlyne does not further address the question of whether this mild arousal can be pleasant\nin itself or, alternatively, whether the moderate complexity still allows a resolution to a\npredictable, recognized configuration, which only then is experienced as positive. We will\nreturn to this issue later on.\nReliable inter-individual differences in appreciation should thus be present, which will be\ndependent on personal experience, which is especially obvious when comparing aesthetic\nevaluations by experts with those of laymen (Lindell and Mueller 2011). Additionally, we\nspeculate that these inter-individual differences in preference also depend on the strength\nof the top-down predictions the viewer generates (irrespective of the particular perceptual\npredictions). This factor may determine how much prediction error a particular person can\n\"tolerate\" and appreciate, but whether this is the case is still an open, empirical question.\nRelated to that, one may wonder whether personality factors such as personal need for\nstructure (Thompson et al 2001), field dependency (Witkin and Goodenough 1981), or the\nsystemizing quotient from autism research (Baron-Cohen et al 2003) relate to this strength of\ntop-down predictions. At least for personal need for structure a correlation has already been\nfound with art appreciation (Landau et al 2006).\nThe second hypothesis derived from our theorizing is that artists attempt to strike this\noptimal balance between predictability and surprise in their works. This way their viewers\nhave to make an effort and initially experience minor negative affect, only to experience\na much intenser positive affect by contrast, once they actually mentally \"resolved\" the\nprediction error. The effort or mental work one has to do to cope with the prediction error is\na conditio sine qua non for receiving perceptual pleasure of a Gestalt formation (prediction\nerror reduction). Before arriving at a clear, coherent interpretation of the jumble of lines in\nKlimt's Reclining Woman (Figure 7), our visual system is embroiled in a small struggle. Only\nwith some mental work is the familiar silhouette discovered. But the aesthetic pleasure is\nlarger as a result. Sometimes this Aha-Erlebnis emerges only after a glance at the title for\nsome contextual information, as for Picasso's Guernica.\nThe hypothesis that aesthetic pleasure lies in forcing the brain to do some work has\nalso been put forward by Dodgson (2009). His research starts from the computer-generated\ngeometric patterns inspired by the early work of the English Op artist Bridget Riley. With\na psychophysical test using different degrees of distortion, he shows that there is a range\nin which a pattern is not immediately recognized but can be recognized given some extra\neffort. Since Riley's works precisely lie in this region where a pattern is hinted at but not\nmade obvious, Dodgson suggests that this might be a common mechanism in all art. In\nline with our account above, he argues that finding an aesthetic optimum is not a matter of\ndepicting the best Gestalt but rather of providing just enough information that the viewer\ncan reconstruct the pattern but not so much information that the pattern is plainly obvious.\nHence, Dodgson's research is a nice illustration of the idea that artworks embody a right\nbalance of the expected and the surprising. It also helps to clarify discussions on the relative\nimportance of familiarity and novelty in art appreciation where it is often concluded that: \"It\nis not extreme novelty but `optimal' innovation--novelty that allows for the recoverability of\nthe familiar--that is most pleasurable\" (Giora [2003, p 176] quoted in Lindell and Mueller\nFigure 8. Computer rendition of Fragment 6/9, Riley (from Dodgson [2009] with permission from the\nauthor).\n4.4 The valence of prediction error\nA central assumption of our theory is that prediction errors are always to some extent\nemotional, more specifically negative in valence. We are currently setting up experiments to\ntest this, but so far we have only indirect evidence to support it. For example, we note that\nthe expression of surprise, the emotional reaction to violation of predictions, is very close to\n(and often indistinguishable from) a fearful expression. Neuroimaging studies lend support\nfor this similarity since the amygdala responds equally strongly to surprised as to fearful\nfaces and much less to angry or happy emotions (Whalen 1998). Moreover, a very recent\nmeta-analysis of neuroimaging studies on aesthetic appreciation (across modalities) found\na consistent activation of the anterior insula (Brown et al 2011). This structure is known to\nbe involved in the conscious, bodily emotional experience (Craig 2009), in particular for\nunpleasant emotions such as disgust and pain. The authors were puzzled that this region\nsystematically pops up in studies on aesthetics and assumed it attests to the visceral impact\nof artworks. In light of our theory, the insula activity might point to the unpleasantness of\nprediction errors, which are an important stage in the aesthetic experience. The limited\ntemporal resolution of fMRI might not make the distinction between stages that quickly\nfollow each other. However, we should tread carefully in interpreting the anterior insula\nactivity because, as Yarkoni et al (2011) report in their large-scale meta-analysis, the insula\nis one of the regions found to be active in a large percentage of neuroimaging studies, a lot\nof which do not even study emotion. Still, it is interesting to see that the anterior insula is\nnot only involved in negative emotions but that more specifically (spatially and temporally)\nseparable signals can be found reflecting risk prediction and risk prediction errors in the\ninsula (Preuschoff et al 2008). This role of the insula in uncertainty and anticipation, which\nhas been noted before (Elliot et al 2000), is in line with our reasoning that prediction errors\nin art cause uncertainty (risk of not being rewarded in the end), the computations of which\nwill determine whether to look away or to go on exploring the piece. Moreover, the anterior\ncingulate cortex, a region often jointly active with the insula (Craig 2009), has been found\nto be involved in signaling visual prediction errors (Noyce and Sekuler 2011) analogous to\nits role in signaling motor mistakes (which we can reasonably assume are experienced as\nnegative). All this being said, whether our hypothesis of the negatively valenced prediction\nerrors stands the empirical test remains to be seen.\nWhile traditionally the aesthetic experience is equated with attaining harmony and\nsuccessful insights, we are not the first to emphasize negative affect, discrepancy, and\ndisruption as important components in aesthetic appreciation. Vygotsky (1971) used\nAristoteles' concept of catharsis to describe that in aesthetic experiences we go through a\ntransformation from a negatively valenced obstruction to a positively experienced resolution,\nin full awareness that the positive catharsis would not be possible without first having\nexperienced its contrast. More recently the artist Pepperell (2011) characterized his aesthetic\nexperience as a moment in which his \"usual conceptual grip on the world failed\". This was\naccompanied by mild anxiety and \"active struggle to make sense of what [he] was seeing\".\nArtists use the compulsive interpretative (predictive) mode of the visual system to leave out\nparts of, or blatantly contradict, the suggested content of their works.\nPelowski and Akiba (2011) similarly highlight disruptions and breaches as vehicles for\nthe kinds of self-transformation described in accounts of rich aesthetic experiences. When\nartworks forcefully challenge the conceptual classifications and personal self-understandings\nof the viewer, they can lead him or her to question, change, or expand these, with possible\nexistential ramifications. This is a precarious balance to strike because the viewer might\nprematurely break off perception. Overcoming initial negative experiences requires courage\nand inventiveness to modify the existing (self-)schema (Vygotsky 1971; Pelowski and Akiba\n2011) but is constitutive for the full aesthetic experience. It is encouraging to see that, starting\nfrom different inspiration, namely the full, rich aesthetic experience and several social-\npsychological findings, the authors arrive at an understanding of the aesthetic experience\nthat is consistent with ours. While their view explores the existential and meta-cognitive\nimplications of the conflicts present in art, ours starts from a substantiated theory of visual\nperception, in a rather \"bottom-up\" way.\n4.5 No pain, no gain?\nWhat evidence do we have to argue that a reduction in unpredictability (prediction error)\nis experienced as positive? Put differently, do we have reason to assume that the degree of\nour mental efforts to compensate for this unpredictability (to resolve the picture) is directly\nrelated to the reward we experience? A common finding in animal learning tasks is that\nrandom intermittent rewards (there is a pattern but it is disrupted) or non-reward (during\ninitial extinction trials: there was a clear pattern, but now it is interrupted) provoke most\nvigorous responding. In those cases motivation is highest. For example, a variable interval\nreinforcement schedule, in which the animal is rewarded on average every nth amount of\ntime, provokes the highest response rates, presumably because from the point of view of the\nanimal there remains something to be learnt. Neurally, unexpected rewards, compared with\nexpected rewards, are associated with increased dopamine peaks. Johnson and Gallagher\n(2010) specifically asked whether it might be the effort required for getting a reward that is\nthe determining factor for the reward value. They reported that the positive affective quality\nof taste can be boosted by increasing the amount of effort required to obtain it. In their study\nmice learned to press a lever A for a reward and lever B for another, different tasting, reward.\nNext, they gradually increased the number of operant lever presses needed to obtain one\nof the two rewards. When tested afterwards outside of the training environment, the mice\nshowed a clear preference for the reinforcer for which they had to work the hardest in the\nlearning phase. In accordance with our speculations on art, they concluded that pleasure\n(hedonic value) is increased by effort. In humans something similar has very recently been\nreported as the IKEA effect: participants value the products of their own labour similar to\ncreations of experts, but only when they successfully completed them (Norton et al in press).\nThe view outlined here is bound to learn a lot more from advances in (animal) learning\nstudies on the link between uncertainty versus predictability and reward value. They might\nhelp to explain why we can derive pleasures from mildly deviant stimuli, as in an addict\nwho experiences pleasure from almost winning (near-misses). In a set-up mimicking a\ngambling machine, almost winning is shown to induce heightened reward expectancies in\nrats, mediated by dopamine and analogous to the near-miss effect in addiction (Winstanley\net al 2011). It seems that part of the reward lies in the anticipation instead of the consumption\n(Lauwereyns 2010), with a little unpredictability adding to the reward. One must note that this\nis in agreement with the idea that biological organisms are characterized by striving: It would\nhave made little sense for evolution to reward static states of stimulation. Prediction errors\nintroduce uncertainty that will stimulate further processing (mental effort), the outcome\nof which is also uncertain, thus unexpected when successful. Phenomenally, this kind of\nperceptual problem solving is not only rewarding but also gives the viewer a sense of mastery\nIn the context of art perception, Ishai et al (2007) find a positive correlation between\nthe time needed to comprehend a picture and its aesthetic value (measured as the judged\ndegree of \"powerfulness\" of a presented painting), leading Pepperell (2011) to suggest that the\neffort people have to invest to recognize the contents has a positive influence on aesthetic\nvalue. Reports that the better the viewer's understanding of an artwork, the more he or\nshe experiences pleasure, should thus at least be re-examined (Leder et al 2004). No doubt\nindividual differences determine a large part of the variability here (as described earlier),\nbut in addition to that, experiment designs may not always allow the tracking of these\ndynamics and the presence of moments of misconception. It may be true that understanding\nfacilitates liking, but this pleasure may be potentiated by preceding mismatches. Likewise,\nwhen going to a scary film, we endure cruel tensions because their resolution is so good.\nNote, however, that when we say we like a painting, there is a kind of misattribution taking\nplace: the pleasurable experience associated with a processing characteristic, namely the\nreduction of prediction error in the stimulus, is ascribed to the stimulus itself (Huron 2006).\nOur fundamental thesis is that the progression from a state of more unpredictability to\na state of less uncertainty is pleasurable. Again, animal studies support this hypothesis. In\nan elegant experiment Bromberg-Martin and Hikosaka (2011) showed that monkeys have a\npreference for cues that indicate that advance information on the presence or absence of\na forthcoming reward will be available over cues that signal such information will not be\navailable, even if their choice has no influence whatsoever on the actual appearance of the\nreward. Moreover, the monkeys more consistently chose this advance information over the\nno information cue than they choose a more probable reward over a less probable reward\n(Niv and Chan 2011). In other words, information or reduction of uncertainty is rewarding\nas such, consistent with our account. In fact, when Bromberg-Martin and Hikosaka (2011)\nexamined the neural underpinnings of the value of information, they concluded that it is\nencoded by the same habenula and dopaminergic neurons that also encode primary rewards.\nTo be clear, these dopamine and habenula neurons are known to signal a change in reward\ncontingencies (reward prediction errors), and this is also what they found with regard to\ninformation: these neurons do not encode the value of predicted information per se but only\nthe changes in predicted information (Niv and Chan 2011). The signals related to information\nchange were simply added up to signals related to reward changes, indicating that the value\nof reward and that of information use a interchangeable neural currency (Niv and Chan\n2011). In keeping with this, we contend that decreases of (information) prediction error\nare pleasurable and constitute part of the aesthetic pleasure. Cues that signify a reduction\nof uncertainty also seem to have greater value for humans. Ogawa and Watanabe (2011)\nasked people to perform a contextual cuing task in which targets are surrounded either by a\nrepeated (and thus predictive) configuration of distractors or, in the other half of the trials,\nby a novel display of distractors. When subjects had to evaluate the goodness of the displays\nafterward, predictive displays were judged more positively than non-predictive or novel\nconfigurations. Since people did not see predictive displays more frequently (nor did they\nrecognize them significantly more in a final phase of the experiment), this increased liking\ncould not be caused by mere exposure. The authors conclude that predictability promotes\npreference (Ogawa and Watanabe 2011). In the context of an effortful search task, with a large\ndegree of uncertainty on the position of the target, predictable configurations will become\nassociated with a higher value than configurations that do not reduce uncertainty.\nTo sum up, dealing with unpredictability requires effort from the viewer. But when\nsuccessful, it leads to positive appreciation. The idea that the viewer's personal efforts and\n\"accomplishments\" matter in art appreciation is also recognized by Mamassian (2008, p\n2152): \"not all ambiguities in paintings are re-solved, and artists probably strive to leave the\nright amount of ambiguities to let the observer contribute to his experience in a personal\nway.\" However, only by using minimal prediction errors painters can ensure that viewers\nwill obtain their reward(s) and not give up prematurely. Final gratification may be further\npostponed as long as the artist has hidden in the painting enough \"micro-rewards\" the viewer\ncan discover along the way.\nOur view emphasizes the role of the dynamics of perceptual processing in art appreciation.\nThis emphasis is not particularly new, but has been foreshadowed by Arnheim, although\narguably in a less articulate way. In his seminal work, Arnheim (1974) asserts that visual\nexperience is dynamically governed by \"attractions\" and \"forces\" or \"tensions\". Even though\nthese terms are kept rather vague in his writings, our prediction error account could be seen\nas an effort to give his concept of tension new substance. Arnheim realized that these tensions\nare inherent in any percept, as with our concept of prediction (error), even acknowledging\nthe active role of the observer and his past experience in (automatically) generating these\ntensions. Analogously to our view, Arnheim contends that psychological, like physical,\nsystems \"exhibit a very general tendency to change in the direction of the lowest attainable\ntension level\" (Arnheim 1974, p 14). A crucial difference between Arnheim's view and ours\nis that the ultimate goal for Arnheim is balance or stability, while for us it is the reduction\nof prediction error (or maximization of predictability). In general, once he acknowledged\nthe dynamic nature of perception, he remains overly focused on balance and stability as the\nstatic pinnacle of beauty, largely ignoring the emotional dynamics of the transitions going\nfrom \"tensed\" to \"relaxed\" interpretations of visual input that, according to our view, may\ncause positive appreciations.\nBecause it is inspired by predictive coding, our view also shares with Arnheim's the\nconcern for parsimony (efficiency of representation, cf supra), which he in turn inherits from\nthe Gestalt tradition, with its emphasis on simplicity and Pr\u00e4gnanz. Predictability implies\nmore efficient, higher level representations, freeing up expensive processing resources. That\nthere is positive affect (appreciation) associated with this progression has been anticipated\nby Eysenck (1942) in his law of aesthetic appreciation: \"The pleasure derived from a percept\nas such is directly proportional to the decrease of energy capable of doing work in the total\nnervous system, as compared with the original state of the whole system\" (Eysenck 1942,\np 358). Thus, a change towards a more efficient state of the dynamic perceptual networks\ngiven the current constraints of stimulation, tantamount to a decrease in prediction error\n(surprise), is pleasurable as such, as we described for the Klimt sketch above (Figure 7).\n4.7 From traditional to modern art\nMelcher and Bacci (2008) noted that artists often use very familiar perceptual domains, like\nfaces or animals, but apply their \"artistry\" on them. Since prehistoric times, artists exploit very\nfamiliar patterns, for which we developed exquisite, specialized systems through evolution\nand experience. Melcher and Bacci (2008, p 352) observe that \"the ability to recognize certain\nstimuli quickly and easily makes it easier, then, for artists to add decorative elements, accurate\ndetails and artistic style.\" For example in prehistoric cave art, the patterns portrayed are\nnot \"just\" depictions of animals or humans; they incorporate counter-intuitive or unusual\ndeformations (see Figure 9).\nFigure 9. Examples of prehistoric cave art (elongated human figures in aboriginal art in Kukadu\nNational Park, Australia).\nThe cultural anthropologist Dissanayake (2009) calls this special treatment \"artification\"\nor \"making special,\" which, according to her, encompasses formalization, exaggeration,\nelaboration, repetition, and manipulation of expectation. Note that most (if not all) of\nthese terms relate to either confirmation and strengthening of predictions or violation and\ndisruption of predictions (prediction errors). Dissanayake agrees that this process is most\nobvious in the temporal, performing and traditional arts, but claims that these are universal\ncharacteristics common to all art forms. This particular shaping of stimuli is meant to set\nthese objects or practices apart from, and make them more than, the ordinary (traditionally\nin the context of religious rituals).\nIn the context of their discussion of surprise in art, Melcher and Bacci (2008) provide\nsome other fine examples of prediction error in art. About the Sleeping Hermaphrodite they\nwrite:\nDisplayed with the back to the viewer, it offers a sensual pose that flatters the femininity of the\nfigure, in accordance with the tradition of the reclining Hellenistic nude. Enticed by the sensual\nnature of this work, the viewer who will then walk around the sculpture to see it from the front\nwill encounter the surprise of the figure's androgynous nature, which provides a moment of\nastonishment in which sensory information does not coincide with expectation (Melcher and\nOn the powerful, realistic evocation of biological motion in Caravaggio's The Death of\nthe Virgin they hypothesize: \"Thus, perception of motion in static art involves a form of\nperceptual ambiguity, in which complex motion areas such as MT/MST are activated but\nSeveral theorists and art critics have argued that (post)modern artists, with their explicit\nabandonment of any representational aspirations and their blunt refusal to provide any\nfamiliar reference point whatsoever to their spectators, have taken things too far (Landau et\nal 2006; Pinker 2003). They are said to leave the viewers of their works completely in chaos,\nbombarding them with colors and fragmented shapes with no structure or meaning. In our\nterms: an overload of prediction errors that despite our best efforts, cannot be reduced to a\nmore predictable, sparser explanation. As a consequence, modern abstract art, as compared\nwith other styles, is least preferred by the general public (Landau et al 2006; Lindell and\nMueller 2011). We suggested earlier that artists will attempt to find an optimum, but their\nsuccess in doing so depends on their intended audience and its broader cultural context.\nWorks of art will survive through time if they manage to be at such an optimum (and thereby\nappeal) across cultures and periods (Melcher and Bacci 2008). Of all abstract art our theory\npredicts that we will be most impressed by paintings in which we can, with some labor,\ndistinguish recognizable, predictable forms. Excavation by de Koonig (Figure 10) can serve\nas a good example, as can the paintings of Pepperell that also show this kind of object\nindeterminacy, investigated by Fairhall and Ishai (2008).\nClearly our approach can be applied to art belonging to a broad range of styles and eras.\nIn fact, it has most difficulties in explaining the attraction of hyper-realistic art. In this case\nwe can speculate that it has more to do with the admiration of craftsmanship, the emotional\ncontent of the painting, or possibly an ultimate prediction error in all visual artworks: this\nwork provokes strong feelings in me, as if the particular object depicted is really in front\nof me, while in fact it isn't. What we could call the \"ceci n'est pas une pipe\" experience.\nAlternatively, we might be bemused by the fact that we see a nearly photo-realistic image\nwhile we expected a painting. But evidently these are just ad hoc explanations.\n4.8 The fate of prediction errors\nThe examples so far might have made it clear that often we do not end up with a coherent,\npredictable Gestalt. Still, we want to draw attention to the fact that prediction errors at the\nlevel of style (perceptual ones) sometimes can be resolved on the level of meaning (see, also,\nPinna 2010). The deserting lady in Munch's Separation dissolves in the road and the air,\nand Picasso's Weeping Woman can be \"broken\" because she is sad. A clear congruency in\nmeaning unexpectedly \"saves\" the coherence of the paintings, and so the prediction error is\nreinterpreted. With these symbolic explanations, we enter a more speculative realm, but it\nwould be foolish to expect that something as complex as art appreciation can be understood\nby looking only at the low-level, perceptual features. Art is about the interaction of style and\ncontent, not a simple addition of these components. As we reviewed in the introduction, a\npredictive coding view can, similar to schema theory (Proulx et al 2010), provide a way for\nhigh-level expectations to be involved in our experience with art.\nWhat about those paintings in which we can not even remotely and mentally come to a\nform of closure? Paintings are static art forms, so prediction errors often cannot be resolved,\nexcept in our minds. In their artistic endeavors people seem to deliberately seek prediction\nerrors. Prediction errors intrigue us, especially when they violate strong default expectations.\nEven if we are not sure there is an actual clue to them, we cannot remain indifferent to them\n(they cause arousal), and we keep coming back to examine them (attentional resources are\nrecruited). We might still experience positive emotions from these \"unsolvable\" paintings,\nthough. By reappraisal of the negative prediction error in a safe context, the resulting emotion\nis still very positive because of the contrast effect (cf supra). A related, but more implicit\nmechanism, namely misattribution, could turn a negative arousal into something of positive\naffective valence. This mechanism shows people often have very little insight into the sources\nof their experienced emotions or arousal, as exemplified by the classic Capilano suspension\nbridge experiment (Dutton and Aron 1974). In this experiment passers-by on a scary rope\nbridge or a solid wood bridge are asked some sham questions by an attractive female\nresearcher and told that they can always call for more information on the research afterward.\nThe authors found that if participants were questioned on the foot-bridge, they were much\nmore likely to call the researcher afterward to ask her out. The authors assumed that those\nparticipants misinterpreted their arousal from the fright of walking on a high, shaky bridge\nas feelings of attraction. The specific experiment has been criticized, but the phenomenon of\nmisattribution has been replicated since and is well-established. It might thus partly explain\nwhy we misinterpret, for example, the mildly negative color mismatch in a Matisse painting\nas affectively positive (Figure 11).\nThe question of whether prediction errors can be experienced as positive also relates\nto the conceptual confusion on what exactly an aesthetic experience entails. We can safely\nassume that art has to be rewarding in one way or another; otherwise, we would not be\nmotivated to engage with it. But people might label some artworks as \"fascinating\" or\n\"special\", rather than \"beautiful\" (Augustin et al in press). Finally, a particular painting\nmight also be differently appreciated depending on the context of stimulation, as we will\nbriefly discuss in the next section.\n4.9 Inferentially rich, attention-grabbing meaning threats\nBecause of the prediction errors, we feel impelled to question our perception and to linger\non its contents. These visual or cognitive challenges urge us to, implicitly or explicitly, go\nthrough multiple cycles, exploring different predictions and the corresponding errors (Leder\net al 2004). They grant access to different layers of meaning, which we so much like to\ndiscover. They create the multi-interpretability and ambiguity that has been invoked by\nothers to explain our enjoyment of art (Biederman and Vessel 2006; Mamassian 2008; Zeki\ncoined the term surplus structure to denote that through externalizing their ideas in sketches,\nartists themselves discover new, unanticipated features and interpretations of the raw ideas.\nMight this be true? Not so much because in sketches they can more lucidly represent their\nideas but rather because sketches allow them to depart more easily from ordinary ideas and\nexaggerate, restructure, and deform more freely, in other words amplify what would normally\nbe prediction errors?\nBiederman and Vessel's (2006) idea is basically that inferentially rich stimuli will be\npreferred because they are accompanied by more activity in regions higher up in the ventral\nvisual stream, which possess higher amounts of mu-opioid receptors. This hypothesis is not\nat all incompatible with our account. Our optimally deviant expected patterns with a limited\nviolation of intuitions, combine the rich inferences (of a predictable pattern) with the high\nsaliency (of the discrepancies) which conspire to make a very emotional and memorable\nstimulus (Sperber and Hirschfeld 2004). Discrepancies are attention grabbing and stimulate\nfurther processing, but only when strong predictions are first built up (clear organization).\nThis optimum makes for a highly relevant stimulus according to Sperber's (2005) theory\nbecause it guarantees the richest cognitive inferences for the least cognitive effort.\nOur account also bears a clear resemblance to the Freudian notion of the uncanny (das\nUnheimliche). Freud observed that we are disturbed and aroused by unfamiliar experiences\nin an otherwise completely familiar setting (Proulx et al 2010). For example, in absurdist\nor surrealist art we often find an unfamiliar juxtaposition of very familiar objects. Thus,\nstrong expectations have to be present before such an experience can ensue. In a completely\nunfamiliar situation no strong predictions are formed, so no violations will be encountered.\nIncongruency or expectancy violation will result in negatively valenced arousal aimed at\nreducing the inconsistency if at all possible, as in our account. Some authors have even\nreported that this arousal can lead to an affirmation of any other meaning framework to\nwhich one is committed. For example, after exposure to an absurd Kafka parable, subjects\nmore strongly affirmed their cultural identity than after reading one of Aesop's meaningful\nparables (Proulx et al 2010). The meaning maintenance model, as this theory is called,\nhas been developed to counter the terror management theory, which assumes that only\nmortality threat (salience) will cause people to defend their cultural world-view. In a study\nby Landau et al (2006) terror management theory has also been applied to art appreciation.\nApparently, mortality salience (having people to imagine what will physically happen when\nthey die and which emotions they have with that) decreases their liking for \"meaningless,\"\nabstract art, while leaving their appreciation of representational paintings untouched. In\nfurther studies the authors find that this effect is limited to individuals with a high personal\nneed for structure, and diminished when the abstract artworks were given meaning (eg,\nby giving a title). This research goes to show that next to stable traits of the viewer and\nstable characteristics of the piece of art, aesthetic appreciation can also be influenced by the\ncontext-dependent cognitive and emotional mindset the viewer is in. We could speculate\nthat any contextual uncertainty (prediction error or, in terms of the theories discussed,\nthreat of meaninglessness) could add up to the uncertainty in a painting and thus influence\nits appreciation. For instance, against a background of unpredictable (versus rhythmic, cf\nsupra) tones a representational painting may be liked more, while an abstract painting might\nbe liked less. Related to this, Mueller et al (in press) recently probed implicit and explicit\nattitudes towards creativity after inducing a sense of uncertainty in half of their volunteers.\nThese people were told they might receive additional payment based on a random lottery\nor, in a second experiment, they were primed to be intolerant of ambiguity. While explicit\nattitudes towards creativity were similar in the experimental and the controls, people in the\nhigh uncertainty condition had an unconscious bias against creativity and judged a highly\ncreative idea less favorably.\nUltimately, maintaining (or returning to) predictability is about survival and maintaining\nthe body through homeostasis (Cerra and Bingham 1998; Van de Cruys and Wagemans\nin press; Friston 2010a). Predictive coding is about reinstating predictability and therefore\nabout affirming one's own existence. So within a predictive coding framework, we do not\nneed to assign a special status to the existential threat of mortality. We further assumed that\nmaking progress in this prediction project of life genuinely feels good or, in the case of art,\nis beautiful. In his Ethics, Spinoza (2001, p 40) writes, \"[I]f the motion by which the nerves\nare affected by means of objects represented to the eye conduces to well-being, the objects\nby which it is caused are called beautiful; while those exciting a contrary motion are called\ndeformed.\" When a successful, sublime aesthetic experience is described as a selfless state of\nharmony between the viewer and the world (Pelowski and Akiba 2011), we might take this\nquite literally: the beholder has advanced in tuning the self to the world.\n5 Remaining questions and concluding remarks\nWe hope to have shown that the predictive coding approach can summarize and throw a new\nlight on existing concepts in the flourishing field of aesthetic appreciation, such as familiarity,\ncomplexity, novelty, prototypicality, interpretability, fluency, incongruency, ambiguity, and\nso. Further research will have to make clear what the added value is of thinking in terms of\npredictions and prediction errors in comparison with these concepts. We want to end our\noverview by discussing some of the limitations and advantages of our approach.\nFirst of all, we do not want to reduce aesthetic experience to the formal mechanisms\ndiscussed. For instance, we are not saying we experience a full-blown aesthetic reaction\nwhen discovering the actual content or organization of 2-tone images, but our hypothesis is\nthat a significant part of the aesthetic appreciation comes from discovering the organization\nafter struggle.\nSecond, we are being too vague when we claim that art is about optimally or minimally\nunpredictable stimuli. The amount but also the kind of prediction errors seems important.\nSome prediction errors are more potent than others. For example, we saw that artists either\ninduce strong predictions themselves in their viewer or rely on strong existing predictions of\nthe domain used in the painting, to subsequently violate them. Also, different artists may\nhave different preferences for the kind of prediction errors they use, as reflected in their style.\nFor instance, some artists play with classical grouping principles and their competition.\nThird, one might object that our focus on prediction errors is born out of cultural myopia.\nIn Western art there is a strong impetus to be original and novel, and even to defy established\ntraditions. In traditional, non-Western cultures, however, originality is often discouraged,\nand artists are expected to closely follow and endlessly repeat the same set of patterns\npassed on for centuries (Dissanayake 2008). As we mentioned earlier, this repetitive art\nalso involves a modulation of predictability but it seems to lack any prediction errors.\nHowever, Dissanayake also notes that these forms of art originally take place in the context\nof ritual ceremonies in times of transition or uncertainty. These rituals nearly always concern\nbiologically important things, such as \"assuring or restoring subsistence, safety, fecundity,\nhealth, prosperity, and victory or successfully dealing with the bodily changes and emotional\nand social concomitants of sexual maturity, pregnancy, birth, and death\" (Dissanayake 2008,\np 19). Hence, she sees stress reduction or coping with uncertainty as an important adaptive\nfunction of art. If we assume that, at least in these particular ceremonial situations, people\nin traditional societies experienced more life-threatening uncertainties than we do in our\nmodern Western society, our hypothesis of a general preferred optimum of unpredictability\ncould still hold. In traditional communities, art could primarily function as a vehicle for\nre-establishing predictability. In Western culture, on the other hand, we artificially create\nobstacles for predictability (in art, disaster movies, etc) to be able to experience the joys\nof their resolution (while we often still use predictable patterns for our wallpapers and\ndecorations). The proximate cause for making and consuming art would then be emotion\nregulation, not \"just\" uncertainty reduction. Also, according to Dissanayake, art can be\ntraced back to the simplified, repeated and stereotyped interactions between adults and\nchildren, which assist the development of emotional self-regulation, attention and learning.\nIndeed, the dynamics of prediction and emotion seem to be protracted in children, where,\nfor instance, in the in the peek-a-boo game the contrast effect (positive emotion following a\nnegative one is more intense) is easily observed.\nWhile art may therefore be a form of training of our exploratory learning capacities\nin a safe, playful context--information foraging is after all a vital human capacity (Vessel\n2004)--it didn't necessarily evolve for that reason. Rather our approach connects to the\nneural recycling hypothesis (Dehaene and Cohen 2007), which assumes that art (similar\nto, for example, writing) didn't evolve for any particular adaptive function but is the result\nof cultural inventions exploiting evolutionarily older brain circuits and inheriting many of\ntheir structural constraints. Indeed, there is no art module in the brain that needed to evolve.\nArtistic abilities are piggy-backing on our perceptual and emotional information processing\ncapacities. Once in place, art may or may not have become a criterion by itself for selective\nforces to work on (co-optation), for example, in mate selection (Pinker 2003) or as a way to\npromote belonging to a social group.\nFourth, unpredictability and its resolution are important in other human activities. For\ninstance, games are most rewarding when they have just the right amount of difficulty,\nof unpredictability. Similarly in humor we build up expectations and create discrepancies\n(Hurley et al 2011). Even in science we are most astonished when a scholar discovers (and\nmanages to explain or make predictable) a counter-intuitive discrepancy in a very familiar\ndomain. One might wonder what, if anything, is special about art. But does art need such an\nessence? Could we not suffice by stating that it is a human activity involving the full emotional\nand cognitive abilities of human beings but with no immediate biological purpose? A quasi-\nnecessary result of a greatly expanded predictive capacity and an extended ability to delay\ngratification?\nFinally, how do we explain within the predictive coding framework that humans--while\nultimately aimed at maximizing predictability, or equivalently, minimizing prediction errors--\nstill explore unpredictable stimuli, and even intentionally create them, as in the case of art.\nmotivation of seeking prediction errors may, in our view, be obtaining a larger reward (by\ncontrast) later. Friston explains that this complicated exploratory (itinerant) behavior does\nnot violate the general tenet of minimization of surprise, provided that the agent \"revisits a\nsmall set of states, called a global random attractor that are compatible with survival\" (Friston\n2010a, p 2). His generalization of predictive coding in the free energy principle optimizes this\nmotion through sensory state-space.\nTurning to the advantages of our approach, artists and art critics will approve of the\nimportance of the active, albeit largely implicit, role of the subject (the viewer) in the\npredictive coding approach. Even a static painting becomes a dynamic experience, as Dewey\n(2005, p 222) writes: \"The product of art--temple, painting, statue, poem--is not the work\nof art. The work takes place when a human being cooperates with the product so that the\noutcome is an experience that is enjoyed because of its liberating and ordered properties.\"\nOur proposal also repeats another adage of artists: learn the rules well, so you can break\nthem effectively.\nThus, predictive coding seems to agree with how artists themselves think about what they\ndo. The painter Henri Matisse famously said when interviewed: \"C'est une cr\u00e9ation par les\nrapports: Je ne peins pas les choses, je ne peins que des diff\u00e9rences entre les choses\" (Aragon\n1971, p 140).(2) We may not read too much into it if we say that he intuitively appreciated\nthat our brain works contextually, by figuring out the differences (prediction errors), not the\nabsolute values (Nikoli\u00b4\nsketch of the differences that the visual system would pick up when viewing the real scene.\nIn fact, scene category can be decoded from fMRI activity in the visual system during the\nviewing of line drawings of scenes, just as well as from brain activity while viewing colour\nphotographs of the scenes (Walther et al 2011).\nIn addition, honoring Occam's razor, we may not need a special, separate psychological\ntheory for aesthetics by using predictive coding. This is consistent with the idea that\n(2)\"It's a creation by relation: I do not paint things, I only paint the differences between things\" (Author's\ntranslation).\ngeneral-purpose motivations and capacities are involved in art, even though their particular\ncombination might be special to art. In this case, we can rely on the cognitive and neural\nevidence for predictive coding, which is broader than visual perception (Friston 2010a;\nWinkler et al 2009). The latter is particularly appealing because art obviously consists of more\nthan visual perception alone. Predicting is the default mode of the brain, encompassing\nperceptual and semantic levels. And even though the emotional implications of the predictive\ncoding approach have not been thoroughly explored, its potential to connect perception,\nlearning, and emotion may be clear from this proposal.\nLastly, our view may open new avenues for the empirical study of aesthetic appreciation.\nPrediction error and confirmation may be tractable in the lab, and thus may allow us to\nisolate one mechanism involved in aesthetic appreciation. For instance, we can induce strong\nshort-term predictions in subjects and subsequently violate or confirm them. Also, it may\nhelp to have physiological markers of prediction violation, for example, in the event-related\nbrain potential visual mismatch negativity (Kimura et al 2011). Here we can expect that\ntemporal aspects and expertise will critically influence the outcomes in perception and\nemotion.\nIn this paper we have outlined a theory of art starting from the hierarchical, bidirectional\ndynamics of vision. We concluded that it is not the most predictable stimulus that is most\npleasurable (the easiest Gestalt formation, cf perceptual fluency) but the Gestalt that appears\nunexpectedly after a fair amount of \"obstinate obstruction\". The positive affective evaluations\nresult from a transition rather than a certain state of stimulation. A stimulus has to play hard\nto get before it can be pleasing (Lehrer 2008). But because our cognitive system ultimately\naims to return to predictability, an optimal amount of prediction error exists. Eventually\nunderstanding art implies fully understanding our brain (not just the visual system) and its\nembodied embeddedness in the natural, social, and cultural environment. We are far from\nsuch an understanding, so any theorizing on art is necessarily preliminary and speculative.\nOur theory on art is really a theory about perception and emotion and their interplay because\nwe believe that only by understanding this interaction we will come to comprehend human\nartistic behavior.\n"
