A special feature\nof the human pattern is that after birth the legs\ngrow relatively faster than other post-cranial body\nsegments.20 For groups of children and youth,\nshort stature due to relatively short legs (i.e. a high\nsitting height ratio) is a marker of an adverse\nThe United States Third National Health and\nis the most recent national sample to include\nmeasures of both stature and sitting height (length\nof the body from buttocks to crown of the head),\nwhich allows the estimation of leg length via\nsubtraction, leg length \u00bc (stature \u00ad sitting height),\nand the estimation of relative leg length via sitting\nheight ratio (SHR \u00bc sitting height/stature \u00c2 100).

In one of these studies, greater body fatness,\nas assessed by BMI is shown to be positively\ncorrelated with supergluteal fat thickness (r \u00bc 0.51,\ncompressible, a thicker gluteo-femoral fat mass will\nincrease sitting height and artificially decrease both\nabsolute and relative leg length. Spurious associations\nbetween measures of sitting height and leg length on\nthe one hand, and leg length-based risks for fatness\nand metabolic disease on the other hand, are likely.\nIn this article we analyse the NHANES III sample to\nassess the reliability of the sitting height ratio as a\nproxy for leg length in adult men and women when\ncorrected for estimated supragluteal fatness.\nMethods\nPopulation\nThe NHANES is a periodic survey conducted by the\nU.S. National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nseries of these surveys. The survey is based on a\ncomplex, multi-stage sampling plan, designed to\nprovide national estimates of the health and nutri-\ntional status of the United States' civilian, non-\ninstitutionalized population in the 50 states and the\nDistrict of Columbia.\nStudy design\nThe major design parameters of the NHANES III have\npersons, aged 2 years and older, were selected over\nthe 6 years. The NHANES identifies subjects by sex,\nage, ethnicity and by the poverty income ratio, an\nindex of family income relative to the poverty level\nadjusted for family size for a given year. `Race/\nethnicity' was self-reported for adults. The NHANES\nIII defined four `race/ethnic' groups: Non-Hispanic\nWhite, Non-Hispanic Black, Mexican-American and\nOther. There are too few of these `Other' individuals\nfor useful analysis.\n`Race/ethnic' codes are social categories and not well\ndefined genetic or biological groups (www.aaanet.org/\nstmts/racepp.htm). Nevertheless, U.S. Blacks have, on\naverage, relatively longer legs than Whites and\nMexican-Americans.28,29 The causes of these group\ndifferences in relative leg length are not well under-\nstood.12 The existence of these group differences\nrequires analysis by `race/ethnic' groups.\nMeasures\nEthnicity/race is self reported by the participants in the\nsurvey as White, Black or Mexican-American.\nSex (female or male) is self reported by the\nparticipants in the survey.\nAge at interview, in years (Age) was calculated from\ndate of birth and the date of interview.\nPoverty income ratio is computed as a proportion of\ntwo components. The numerator is the midpoint of\nthe observed family income category reported in\nthe Family Questionnaire of the NHANES III. The\ndenominator is the poverty threshold, based on the\nage of the family reference person, and the calendar\nyear in which the family was interviewed. The poverty\nthreshold values (in dollars) are produced annually by\nthe U.S. Census Bureau and are adjusted for inflation.\nAnthropometry measurement protocols are available.27\nStanding height and sitting height were measured\ndirectly to the nearest 0.10 cm. Leg length was\ncalculated by subtracting sitting height from stand-\ning height. Additional anthropometry used in the\npresent analysis includes weight, four skinfolds\n(subscapular, triceps, suprailiac, thigh), upper leg\nlength (femur length), biiliac breadth (maximum\nbreadth of the hips at the highest point of the iliac\ncrests), biacromial breadth (maximum breadth of the\nshoulders across the lateral borders of the acromial\nprocesses), elbow breadth (greatest breadth across the\nepicondyles of the humerus at the elbow) and\nbuttocks circumference (maximum circumference of\nthe hips). The body breadths are included as a control\nfor body shape and as a measure of frame size, an\nimportant variable associated with body fatness.30\nPercentage body fat was calculated using the\nformulas of Peterson et al. 31, which assume a four-\ncompartment model of body composition. For men\nthe sum of the triceps, subscapular, suprailiac and\nmidthigh skinfolds. In the formula for women the\nterm `BMI' is the body mass index (weight in kg/\nheight in m2).\nAs our measure of relative leg length we use the\nsitting height ratio. We feel this is more appropriate\nthan using estimated leg length [i.e. (stature \u00ad sitting\nheight)]. The sitting height ratio gives the percentage\nof total stature that is due to the length of the head,\nneck and trunk of the body and, therefore, partially\ncorrects for the stature variation within the sample.\nThe sitting height ratio is a better descriptor of body\nshape than stature or leg length.12 Moreover, if\nbuttocks fatness biases the measurement of sitting\nheight then it also biases the estimate of calculated\nleg length. It seems better to analyse a ratio of the\ndirect measurements of height and sitting height\nrather than a calculated estimate of leg length.\nWe compute % upper leg length, % biiliac breadth,\n% biacromial breadth, % elbow breadth and % but-\ntocks circumference by dividing each variable by\nstanding height (e.g. buttocks circumference in cm/\nheight in cm). BMI, an index of weight-for-height, is\nalso included in our analyses. Relating these variables\nto stature allows for common comparison of lengths,\nStudy sample and statistical analysis\nthe variables was extracted. We chose this age range\nto avoid the effects of growth, development and\nmaturation for younger people. We also wish to avoid\nage-related changes for older adults in stature and\nsitting height, which in the NHANES III sample tend\nto decrease after age 50 relatively rapidly compared\nwith younger adults (analysis not shown here, see\nalso ref.34). Age 50 years is also a convenient cut-off\npoint for fatness changes in the NHANES III sample.\nSummarizing our analyses of age changes in fatness\n(not shown here), women tend to increase to age 60\nyears, but slowly after age 50. Fatness in men tends to\nincrease relatively rapidly to age 40 years, more slowly\nto age 60 years, and then stabilize to age 90.\nIn Table 1 the distribution of participants by\nethnicity (White, Black and Mexican-American) and\nsex along with the means and standard deviations for\nage, height, sitting height, % body fat are presented.\nThe maximum number of men and women for any\nsingle variable totals 9023 cases.

Due to relatively large number of\ncorrelations, and the possible multicollinearity (linear\ndependence) between many of these variables it may\nbe difficult to understand the underlying biological\nstructure of the data set.

In the present analysis the\ndata are treated as a sample of convenience.\nResults\nWe begin the presentation of results by assuming that\nthe sitting height ratio is an accurate proxy for\nrelative leg length. In Figure 1 we show the relation-\nship of means for sitting height ratio according to\nquartiles of % body fat for adult women. Quartile 1 is\nthe lowest and quartile 4 the highest % body fat.\nSimilar data for men are shown in Figure 2. In\nwomen, all three ethnic groups show increases in\nsitting height ratio (relatively shorter leg length) with\nincreases in % body fat (P < 0.001). For men, Blacks\nand Mexican-Americans show increases in sitting\nheight ratio with increases in % body fat (P < 0.01),\nbut Whites do not. Results of this type, that adults in\nthe NHANES III with relatively longer legs have lower\nbody fatness and lower BMI are reported in the\nliterature cited previously.\nThe association between relative leg length and\n% body fat is reduced and less direct if additional\nvariables are considered simultaneously. Presented in\nTable 2 is a correlation matrix for the set of variables\nconsidered here for women and men. The correlation\ncoefficients (r) for sitting height ratio and % body fat\nlength and % body fat the r for both men and women\nis \u00c00.10. While the signs of these correlations are in\nthe expected direction (greater % body fat with\nrelatively shorter legs) these are small-to-modest\ncorrelations given the sample size. In contrast, the r\nvalues for correlations between % body fat, BMI and\nthree variables are strongly associated. Percentage\nbuttocks circumference has very little association with\n% upper leg length (r \u00bc \u00c00.04 for both sexes), but a\nmodest association with sitting height ratio (r \u00bc 0.25\nfor women and r \u00bc 0.32 for men). The measurement\nof buttocks circumference and upper leg length are\nindependent in terms of technique. In contrast, the\nmeasurement of sitting height includes some amount\nof gluteo-femoral tissue that also contributes to\nbuttocks circumference.\nPrinciple component analysis results for women\nand men are shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.\nFor women, four factors have eigenvalues greater\nvariance in the dataset, is composed of loadings 40.70\nfor % body fat, % biiliac breadth, % elbow breadth,\n% buttocks circumference and BMI. The choice of a\n`critical level' for factor loadings is arbitrary. Some\nsources suggest values greater than 0.50.35 We chose\n0.70 because it is more conservative and recom-\nmended by the software (STATISTICA) used in our\nanalysis.36 The negative signs of the loadings may be\nignored as they are all negative, and only the relative\nsize of the loading is important. This seems to be a\nbody fatness/body breadth factor. Factor 2, with\nloadings for sitting height and standing height\n(15.36% of the variance), seems to be a linear skeletal\ndimension factor. Factor 3 is comprised of relative leg\nlength, both the sitting height ratio and % upper leg\nlength. The opposite signs for these loadings indicate\nthat adults with greater sitting height ratio have, as\nexpected, relatively shorter femurs. Factor 4 is the\nPoverty income ratio.\nFor men, five factors have eigenvalues41.0.

This seems to be a body\nfatness/lower body breadth factor. Factors 2 and 3 are\nessentially the same as for women. Factor 4 is Age\nand factor 5 is Poverty income ratio.\nDiscussion\nThe results of the principle components analyses\nindicate that fatness, and measures of body breadth\ncorrelated with fatness, comprise the factor which\ndominates the anthropometric structure of the\nNHANES III sample of adults. The `fatness/body\nbreadth' factor is not correlated with the `linear\nsize,' or `relative leg length' factors in the NHANES\nIII sample. Accordingly, the reported relationship\nbetween relative leg length and fatness in the\nliterature, and the one we show in Figures 1 and 2\nare, at least partly, spurious associations that arise\nfrom sources of bias not measured in a simple\nanalysis.\nWithin factor 1, the strong correlation between\n% body fat and % buttocks circumference suggests\nthat the thickness of buttocks fat is one source of bias.\nWe are not aware of any studies that divide buttocks\ncircumference into anatomical regions of fat. One\npublished report finds a positive association between\nBMI and subcutaneous supragluteal fat thickness.25\nTable 2 Correlation matrices for women, above the diagonal, and men, below the diagonal\nTable 3 Principle components analysis for women\nVariable Mean SD Factor 1 Factor 2 Factor 3 Factor 4\nVariables with their means and standard deviations and factor loadings are shown.

One is an analysis of 669\nBrazilian women, which finds that individuals with\nrelatively shorter legs carry significantly more body fat\nthan women with relatively longer legs.37 The authors\nmeasured height and sitting height to calculate sitting\nheight ratio. Buttocks circumference was also mea-\nsured but not included in their regression analysis, so\nit is possible that gluteo-femoral fat thickness biases\nthe results to some extent. The second study is of 30\nwas found between % body fat and height, trunk\nlength or leg length. Measurement protocol is not\nreported, so it is possible that leg length is estimated.\nThe small sample size may obscure important\nrelationships.\nFactor 3 of the principle component analysis\nincludes sitting height ratio and % upper leg length.\nIt is expected that these measure of relative leg length\nwould be strongly, and negatively, correlated if\nbuttocks fatness were not a bias, but less strongly\ncorrelated if sitting height is biased and upper\nleg length is not. The strong association in the\nNHANES III sample may indicate that both measures\nof relative leg length are biased by fatness. The\nmethod for measuring upper leg length used in\nthe NHANES III requires palpating the knee to find\nthe patella-femur junction, drawing a line across\nthe knee at this junction, measuring from the mid-\npoint of this line to the mid-point of the inguinal\ncrease (the junction of the thigh with the lower\nabdomen when the participant is seated). The\nNHANES III manual instructs anthropometrists that,\n`No pressure is to be applied at the inguinal crease;\nhowever, folds of fat tissue may have to be lifted on\nsome obese SP's [subject persons] to measure at\nthe crease' 27 (pp. 3\u00ad9). Applying `no pressure' to a\nfat-filled inguinal crease will underestimate true\nfemur length.\nLiving conditions and growth trends in\nthe United States\nThe principle component analysis finds that the\npoverty index ratio accounts for about 8% of the\nvariance for both women and men in the data set. In\nthe United States, sub-optimal nutrition and relatively\nfrequent disease are more common for children and\nadults of lower income families, of recent immigration\nfrom other countries, for unemployed and under-\nemployed families, and minority ethnic groups.39,40\nStates born populations show a modest increase in\nmean stature for Whites and no increase for Blacks.\nThese trends in height are in contrast to western\nEuropean populations showing stronger positive\ntrends in stature during the same period. The authors\nsuggest the patterns of height growth in the United\nStates may be attributable to the unequal distribution\nof health care and, `. . . the relatively weak welfare\nsafety net' (p. 283). Indeed, this same report states\nthat the United States has the greatest income\ndisparity, as measured by the Gini coefficient, of any\nof the industrialized nations. Body weight and\nfatness, of course, have increased at a rapid rate for\nthe United States adult population during this same\nperiod,42,43 and the burden of the overweight/obesity\nepidemic falls heaviest on those with a lower poverty\nTable 4 Principle components analysis for men\nVariable Mean SD Factor 1 Factor 2 Factor 3 Factor 4 Factor 5\nA negative relationship between sitting height ratio\nand the poverty index ratio for children and youth of\nthe NHANES III is reported.45 Fatness in these\nchildren and youth may bias this relationship, since\nthose with relatively shorter legs also have greater\nsum of four skinfolds.23 Even so, it is possible that\nthe relatively short-legged children from families with\na lower poverty index ratio do, in fact, have reduced\nleg growth. These lower income children may become\nadults with shorter stature, reduced relative leg length\nand greater risk for fatness and metabolic disease.46\nConclusion\nThere seems to be a significant bias when leg length\nand relative leg length (e.g. sitting height ratio) are\nestimated from stature and sitting height in popula-\ntions with high percentage of overweight and obesity.\nIn such populations, the relation of leg length to body\nfatness, and hence disease risk, will be overestimated.\nFuture rounds of the NHANES, and similar surveys\nin other nations with high body fat populations,\nshould measure lower extremity length directly.\nMeasuring lower leg length is especially important\nas the tibia is more sensitive to changes in the health\nenvironment than is the femur or the long bones of\nIt is easier to measure sitting height than leg length.\nIn part this is because there is no consensus for\nchoosing the appropriate anatomical landmarks. Two\ncommon methods for measuring upper and lower leg\nlength are to have the person stand and measure\nsubischial length (the perpendicular distance from\npubic symphysis to the floor) or greater trochanter\nheight (the perpendicular distance from the lateral\nmargin of the greater trochanter of the femur to the\nfloor). Palpating these landmarks in overweight and\nobese individuals may be difficult, time consuming\nand possibly embarrassing. Nevertheless, more direct\nmeasurement of leg length is called for to better\nassess its epidemiological value as a marker for health\nand disease risk and to track changes over time as an\nindicator of the effectiveness of health and nutrition\npolicy and practice.\n"
