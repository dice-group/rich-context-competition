    "abstract": "Abstract\nWithin foreign policy and academic circles in the United States and other western countries, retrenchment has become an\nincreasingly controversial topic. In spite of the increased attention, there have been few empirical studies that rigorously\nexamine the outcomes of great power retrenchment. In this paper, we seek to fill this gap by performing a quantitative\nanalysis of great power retrenchment outcomes from 1870\u00ad2007. Counter to the retrenchment pessimists' expectations,\nwe find that retrenchment leads to relatively positive outcomes for declining states. States that choose to retrench\nexperience shorter periods of economic decline and are less likely to be the target of predatory conflict initiation.\n",

However, it has also become a ques-\ntion of increased political importance as policy-makers in the\nUnited States grapple with fears of decreasing international\ninfluence caused by the economic and military growth of\ngreat power competitors. Scholarship exploring this topic has\nbeen deeply divided, with prominent scholars such as Brooks\nthat a strategy of retrenchment will leave declining states less\nsafe and less prosperous and Copeland (2000) and Gilpin\n(1983) contending that retrenchment will open a declining\nstate up to predation and imperil their security. On the other\nwill lead to a more secure and prosperous America.\nAlthough there has been intense theoretical debate regard-\ning the benefits and costs of retrenchment, these theories have\nonly been tested on a handful of cases with various degrees of\nmethodological rigor. Work by MacDonald and Parent (2011)\nrepresents one notable exception as they base their findings\non a cross-case analysis of all major powers over the same\ntime span that we analyze. However, their analysis is limited\nin its ability to control for confounding factors that may affect\nthe success of strategies of retrenchment. We build on this\nwork by testing these arguments on a time-series cross-\nsectional dataset of all major powers that stretches from 1870\nto the present. Scholars have often pointed to the United\nKingdom's successful policy of retrenchment following\nWorld War II as a rare exception to an otherwise bleak record\n(Gilpin, 1983). Our findings suggest that retrenchment is gen-\nerally effective, making states more likely to recover their\nprevious power and less likely to experience the most danger-\nous interstate conflicts.\nWe propose two hypotheses that directly test two of the\nmost contentious claims in the literature.\nH1: When in a period of decline, a state that chooses to\nretrench will be more likely to recover their previous\nposition than a state that does not.\nH2: A great power experiencing a period of decline will\nbe less likely to be the target of predation at the hands of\nfellow states than a great power that does not.\nResearch note: \"Should we stay or\nshould we go?

The full list of countries and\nyears included in the data is provided in Table 1.\nTo operationalize relative power, we follow MacDonald\nand Parent (2011) in constructing an ordinal ranking of all\ngreat powers in a given year. States are ranked according to\ntheir overall share of gross domestic product (GDP) per\ncapita among great powers. This is preferable to measures\nof absolute power, such as overall capabilities, that do not\nallow us to capture the relational nature of our theory. States\ncan experience relative decline because their own eco-\nnomic performance is poor, or because other states are sim-\nply advancing faster than they are.2\nStates are coded as entering a period of relative decline\nwhen they lose at least one rank in a given year. States exit\na period of decline, or recover, when they regain at least\none ordinal rank after they enter a period of decline. In our\nview, partial recoveries that reverse the process of decline\nwithout restoring a state to its full previous rank still indi-\ncate successful retrenchment. We also believe that states\nshould maintain their improved ranking for some minimum\nperiod of time. States that regain a rank but immediately\nlose it again have not successfully recovered. Since we\nhave no strong theoretical priors regarding how long this\nperiod should be, we use two different thresholds and pre-\nsent results for both. One requires a state to maintain their\nimproved ranking for at least one year after recovery, and\nthe other requires states to maintain their ranking for five\nyears. Once states recover, they become \"at risk\" of experi-\nencing another period of decline.\nTo operationalize retrenchment, we use the percentage\nchange in a state's military expenditures over the previous\nyear as a proxy for its military posture. Whether they are\ndrawing down foreign commitments or decreasing mili-\ntary investment at home, states engaged in a strategy of\nretrenchment should display declining military expendi-\ntures. This provides a continuous measure that allows us\nto capture both whether a state retrenches and the degree\nto which it does so. Data on military expenditures come\nfrom the COW project's National Military Capabilities\nDataset and are measured in nominal values (Lemke and\nReed, 1998).3 Because we do not have reliable data on the\ninflation rate for military capabilities, we choose not to\nadjust these values for inflation. This decision should be\ninconsequential for our results, since we care more about\nyearly changes in military expenditures rather than their\nabsolute level.4\nWe include several control variables to ensure that our\nmodels capture the effects of adopting a strategy of\nretrenchment rather than changes in latent military capa-\nbilities. To control for the effects of a state's absolute power,\nindependent of its position relative to other states, we\ninclude the absolute level of GDP per capita. We also\ninclude the change in GDP per capita over the previous\nyear to control for abrupt changes in absolute power.\nWe also control for factors that may affect a state's abil-\nity to retrench effectively. First, states with strong alliance\nportfolios should have an easier time retrenching by relying\non allies to take up the slack in managing international\nsecurity threats. We control for this using the S alliance\nscore measure, which provides a measure of alliance port-\nfolio strength relative to the system leader (Small and\nSinger, 1969). Second, states capable of nuclear deterrence\nmay be able to reduce military spending more easily by cut-\nting conventional capabilities. We control for this using\ndata on nuclear weapons status from Jo and Gartzke (2007).\nThird, regime type may have an effect on a state's ability to\nretrench. Because autocracies possess less veto players, we\nexpect that they may be able to adjust their spending priori-\nties more easily. In addition, since well-consolidated\nregimes of either type may be more capable of adjusting\nstate policy than anocracies, regime type may have a curvi-\nlinear effect on our variables. To account for this, we\ninclude both the state's Polity2 score and its square using\ndata from the Polity IV dataset (Marshall and Jaggers,\n2002).5 To avoid the possibility of simultaneity bias, we lag\nour independent variables and the control variables account-\ning for power by one year in all models.\nRecovery models\nH1 predicts that states in periods of decline are more likely\nto recover their previous status if they retrench. To test this,\nwe use discrete time duration models to estimate the prob-\nability that a state in a period of decline recovers in a given\nyear. The dependent variable for these models is our binary\nindicator of Recovery. For each version of our Recovery\nvariable (1 year and 5 year), we estimate binomial logit\nmodels on the subset of the data for all years in which a\nstate is coded as in decline. We model the change in the\nTable 1. Countries included in sample.\nGreat powers Years in dataset\nAtkinson and Williford 3\nprobability of failure as a function of time using cubic poly-\nnomials of the time since the beginning of the period of\ndecline (Carter and Signorino, 2010). Because some coun-\ntries never experience decline, both sets of models omit\nobservations on some countries.\nWe begin by discussing the results of our models that\nemploy the one year recovery threshold (see Table 2).\nModel 1 estimates the probability of recovery solely as a\nfunction of a state's change in military expenditures.\nModel 2 introduces the control variables discussed above,\nand Model 3 introduces fixed effects for each country\n(i.e., unit-specific intercepts) to control for unobserved\nheterogeneity induced by including repeated measures on\nthe same units. Taken together, these results provide mod-\nest support for the argument that retrenchment helps a\nstate recover their previous standing during periods of\ndecline. Although the coefficient on changes in military\nexpenditures is insignificant in Model 1 and 2, controlling\nfor unobserved heterogeneity in Model 3 reveals that\nincreases in military expenditures have a negative and\nsignificant effect (at the 0.1 level) on the probability of\nrecovery. Put otherwise, states that decrease their military\nspending in a given year are less likely to experience\nrecovery in the following year.\nTo illustrate the substantive significance of this effect,\nFigure 1 plots the predicted probability of recovery as a\nfunction of changes in military expenditures with all other\nvariables held at their observed values. The probability of\nrecovery is highest after states make significant cuts in their\nmilitary spending. This probability steadily decreases from\nindicating that states which make sharp increases in their\nmilitary spending have almost no chance of recovery.\nTable 3 presents the results of our models using the five\nyear recovery threshold. Although the coefficients are in\nthe predicted direction, our military expenditures variable\nis not significant in any of the three models. In addition,\nincluding fixed effects in the model requires dropping a\nnumber of cases, since several states never experience our\nmore restrictive coding of recovery. As such, it is difficult\nto draw firm conclusions on the basis of these models. In\nsum, we find some evidence that retrenchment facilitates\nrecovery, although this is sensitive to both measurement\nand model specification.\nPredation models\nH2 predicts that states in periods of decline may be subject\nto increased attacks by enemy states. To test this argument,\nwe use binomial logistic regression to model the probability\nthat a great power is attacked by another state. Our depend-\nent variable is a measure of whether another state initiated a\nmilitarized interstate dispute (MID) against a state in a given\nyear (Palmer et al., 2015). Because we care about whether\nother states actually attack declining great powers, we\nrestrict our analysis to MIDs that involve fatalities. Our pri-\nmary independent variables are our indicator of whether a\nTable 2.

Since\nthe choice of recovery threshold determines how long a state\nis coded as in decline, we run models using both our one\nyear and five year coding schemes. We present the models\nusing our one year threshold here. Models using the five\nyear threshold are included in the Supplementary Online\nAppendix. These models include the same control variables\ndiscussed in the previous section as well as cubic polynomi-\nals of the number of years since the last MID initiation.\nTable 4 presents the results of these models. Model 1\nincludes only our measures of decline and retrenchment,\nModel 2 introduces control variables, and Model 3 intro-\nduces fixed effects for each country year. Our results pro-\nvide modest support for the argument that states\nexperiencing relative decline are subject to opportunistic\nattacks by challengers. Although this effect does not reach\nconventional levels of statistical significance in Model 1, it\nbecomes significant after introducing control variables\n(Model 2) and fixed effects (Model 3). Holding all other\nvariables constant at their observed values, the predicted\nprobability of fatal MID onset in a given year is 0.063 for\nstates in periods of decline and 0.031 for states that are not.\nAs such, great powers in periods of decline are effectively\ntwice as likely to be attacked by another state in a given\nyear. This provides support for the argument that great\npowers may be subject to opportunistic attacks by challeng-\ners during periods of weakness.\nWe also find modest support for the proposition that\ngreat powers that retrench may be able to avoid predatory\nattacks by challengers. The coefficient for change in mili-\ntary expenditures is positive and significant at the 0.1 level\nin two of our three models. This indicates that increases in\nmilitary spending are associated with an increased risk of\npredatory attacks. This effect is also substantively signifi-\ncant. To provide some intuition of the size of the effect,\nFigure 2 plots the predicted probability of fatal MID onset\nusing Model 3 across the observed range of our\nRetrenchment variable with all other variables held at their\nTable 3.

This provides modest support for the position of\nretrenchment optimists. Although great powers do appear\nto be subject to attack during periods of relative decline,\nour results suggest that states that decrease their military\nexpenditures may be less prone to this type of behavior.\nOn the whole, our results are relatively robust. In gen-\neral, the predicted values of both sets of models track well\nwith the observed data.6 Both our models of recovery and\npredation are robust to changes in the coding of our decline\nvariable using both one and five year thresholds for our\nrecovery variable. However, our results are somewhat sen-\nsitive to measurement and model specification, which\npoints to the need for further testing before drawing firm\nconclusions. In particular, the fixed effects model performs\nwell in all of our analyses. We believe this is the theoreti-\ncally most appropriate model, since it controls for unit-\neffects and corrects for the violations of the assumption that\nobservations are measured independently. Nonetheless, this\nspeaks to the need for further testing before drawing firm\nconclusions on the basis of our results. Additional studies\nthat employ alternate measures of power and retrenchment\nwould be especially useful in this regard.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we have assessed the outcomes of great power\nretrenchment using a dataset of all great powers from\nhave found that retrenchment has led to relatively success-\nful outcomes. Declining states that choose to retrench expe-\nrience shorter periods of relative economic decline and are\nless likely to be the targets of predation than declining\nstates that choose not to retrench. While these findings are\nsuggestive, more research needs to be done to fully assess\nthe outcomes of retrenchment. Among other topics, future\nwork should explore the impact that retrenchment has on\nthe credibility of the international commitments that the\ndeclining state chooses to maintain. Additionally, our data\ncontain a number of instances of declining states that chose\nnot to retrench and subsequently experienced prolonged\neconomic problems and predation. Our findings suggest\nthat retrenchment would have mitigated some of the nega-\ntive effects of decline. Of these cases, post-World War II\nFrance represents and interesting instance of a declining\npower that chose not to retrench (Spruyt, 2005). Future\nresearch should employ quantitative counterfactual analy-\nses, such as synthetic control, to explore how retrenchment\ncould have changed France's fortunes.\n"
