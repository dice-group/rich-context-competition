As a bioactive\ncomponent of the renin\u00adangiotensin system (RAS) and\nkallikrein\u00adkinin system (KKS), it plays a significant role in\nblood pressure regulation. It acts by hydrolyzing angioten-\nsin I into a potent vasopressor peptide \u00ad angiotensin II \u00ad\nand also by deactivating the vasodepressor peptide\nbradykinin.7 The insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of\nthe ACE gene was characterized by the presence or absence\nof a 278-bp Alu repetitive sequence in intron 16. This\npolymorphism accounts for a large proportion of serum\nACE activity, with the DD genotype having the highest and\nthe II genotype having the lowest ACE activity.8\nEndothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is one of three\nisoforms of nitric oxide synthase that exhibit homology of\nsequence and function.9 Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized\nfrom L-arginine by a family of three enzymes, which are\nconstitutive enzymes that produce low levels of basal NO\nproduction in a calcium-dependent fashion.10,11 NO from\npolymorphisms in Saudi subjects with\nhypertension\nAhmad Ali1, Abdullah Alghasham2, Hisham Ismail3,\nMoataz Dowaidar1 and Ahmad Settin1\n Keywords\nACE, eNOS, polymorphism, hypertension, Saudi Arabia\nMolecular Biology Research Center, College of Medicine, Qassim\nUniversity, Burayda, Saudi Arabia\nDepartment of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, Qassim University,\nBurayda, Saudi Arabia\nClinical Pathology Department, College of Medicine, Qassim University,\nBurayda, Saudi Arabia\nCorresponding author:\nArabia.\nEmails: settin@mans.edu.eg\nArticle\nthe endothelium is considered an important atheroprotec-\ntive mediator, as defects in generation of NO are associated\nwith an increase in cardiovascular risk factors.12 Multiple\ngene polymorphisms related to eNOS have been reported,13\nbut a common polymorphism exists in nucleotide 894 G-T\nthat results in the conversion of glutamate to aspartate for\nshown to be associated with a shorter half-life of eNOS in\nendothelial cell culture, as the result of increased enzymatic\ncleavage.14 In addition, clinical studies have demonstrated\nthat vascular responsiveness is altered in subjects with this\nvariant, as patients with Asp298 have an increased vaso-\nconstrictive response to phenylephrine consistent with\ndecreased NOS activity;15 therefore, it has been implicated\nas a risk factor for both hypertension14,16 and coronary\nHypertension is a well-known prevalent disorder among\nthe Saudi population, especially in Qassim Region which is\na tribal region characteristically having high consanguinity\nrates plus relatively high aggregation rates for familial dis-\neases such as obesity, hypertension and diabetes.19,20 In\nspite of this fact, to date few data have been published con-\ncerning the genetic background of Saudi subjects in terms\nof their susceptibility to hypertension.\nThis study was planned in order to check for the associa-\ntion of ACE I/D and eNOS E298D genetic polymorphisms\nwith hypertension among affected Saudi subjects.\nSubjects and methods\nAs a pilot study ahead of a future wide-scale genetic analy-\nsis of Saudi patients with hypertension, a convenient sam-\nple of 120 affected subjects were included in this study.\nThese were 80 males and 40 females with an age mean \u00b1SD\nstanding hypertension, i.e. with systolic blood pressure\nduration of hypertension is 1 year, confirmed during at least\ntwo visits to the outpatient clinic of Buraydah Central\nHospital, Qassim region, Saudi Arabia. Of these patients,\nhad positive parental consanguinity, 12.8 % were smokers,\nyears were taken from the same locality as controls.\nObesity was diagnosed on the basis of the most com-\nmonly used definitions, established by the World Health\ndefines the body mass index (BMI) of obesity as being 30\nor greater.21 Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed on the basis of\nmg/dl on at least two occasions, or with symptoms of\nhyperglycemia and a casual (random) plasma glucose\nwas obtained from all participants, as well as ethical\napproval from the local Ethics and Scientific Committees.\nDNA extraction and amplification\nThe isolation of genomic DNA was done on a MagNA Pure\nLCinstrument(RocheMolecularBiochemicals,Mannheim,\nGermany), using the manufacturer's standard protocol.\nOligonucleotide primers and fluorescence-labeled hybridi-\nzation probes were designed for amplification and\nsequence-specific detection of the corresponding polymor-\nphism (TIB MolBiol; Berlin, Germany).

Interestingly, cases with hypertension, dia-\nbetes, and obesity showed 100% mutant D allele carriage\nthat gave a just near-significant association (p = 0.052)\n(Table 1).\nRegarding the eNOS E298D polymorphism (Table 2),\nthe frequency of mutant eNOS D allele carriage was only\nobserved to be higher than controls among cases with\nhypertension associated with diabetes and obesity, yet not\n350 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 14(4)\nAll other subgroups showed a non-significant difference of\nfrequencies related to eNOS E298D gene polymorphism\ncompared with controls.\nInterestingly, testing for the association of hyperten-\nsion with combined genotypes of the two polymorphisms\nrevealed only a significant association with ACE D allele\ncarriage (data not shown). Comparing case subgroups in\nterms of risk factors such as gender, age, smoking, con-\nsanguinity and family history showed a non-significant\ndifference related to all studied genotypes and alleles\n(Table 3).\nDiscussion\nThis study showed that Saudi patients with hypertension,\nparticularly when associated with obesity and diabetes, had\nsignificantly higher frequency of the mutant ACE D allele\ncarriage rate than controls, with a significantly higher fre-\nquency of the heterozygous polymorphism ID. Interestingly,\nthe ACE DD genotype frequency in Qassim region (51.7%)\nwas higher than reported in other Mediterranean and Asian\nTable 1.

Conversely, many studies have pointed\nout that DD genotypes failed to show an association with\nhypertension, such as those done among Chinese,33 Punjabi\nPakistanis,34 a rural Indian population of Haryana35 and in\nthe western Black Sea region of Turkey.36 Similarly, no\nassociation was found regarding the ACE I/D polymor-\nphism among cases with hypertension and diabetes as\nIt has been speculated that ACE and the components of\nthe RAS are expressed in adipose tissue and therefore might\nbe associated with obesity. Wacker et al. indicated that the\nACE I/D polymorphism may be differentially associated\nwith obesity depending on multiple factors.41 However,\nCooper et al. pointed out that the I/D polymorphism of the\nACE gene was associated with variation in the levels of\nACE, but inconsistently with BMI. Therefore, the investi-\ngators suggested that obesity may alter the levels of ACE\nand angiotensinogen, and provide a potential pathway\nthrough which obesity leads to elevation of blood pres-\nsure.42 In this respect, Kramer et al. examined the associa-\ntion between obesity and 13 ACE gene polymorphisms,\nincluding the I/D polymorphism, and found no polymor-\nphism consistently over-transmitted from parents to obese\noffspring among blacks living in Ibadan, Nigeria; Spanish\nTown, Jamaica; and Chicago.43\nRegarding the eNOS E298D polymorphism, the fre-\nquency of mutant D allele carriage was only observed to be\nhigher in cases of hypertension associated with diabetes\nand obesity as compared with controls, yet was statisti-\ncally non-significant. These results do not support the\nhypothesis that the E298D eNOS polymorphism contrib-\nutes to the genetic susceptibility to hypertension with or\nwithout obesity and diabetes among Saudi subjects.\nSimilarly, many studies have pointed out that the E298D\neNOS polymorphism failed to show an association in\nhypertension among different populations, for instance, in\na population-based cohort of Caucasians,44 in Anglo-Celtic\naddition, a meta-analysis by Zintzaras et al. has confirmed\nno association of the E298D eNOS polymorphism with\neither hypertension status or blood pressure levels in other\npopulations.48 Conversely, there are studies showing a pos-\nitive association of E298D eNOS with hypertension in\nmale Asian Indians.52 Such controversial associations\nmight lead us to believe that final conclusions are limited\nby diverse factors challenging human geneticists involved\nin multifactorial disease research. It is relevant to recog-\nnize that disease prevalence is a consequence of the inter-\nsection of the genetic variation that represents a population\nwith different environmental exposures. Each population\nis expected to have a different distribution of relative gen-\notype frequencies and a different constellation of possible\nenvironmental histories.53\nIn this respect, to clarify the significance of this gene\npolymorphism, we recommend a large-scale prospective\ncohort study to more accurately judge associations of the\npolymorphism with hypertension. Future research should\npreferentially focus on gene\u00adenvironment interactions as\nwell as haplotype analyses.\nIn conclusion, this study has demonstrated the possible\nassociation of ACE I/D (but not the eNOS E298D) gene\npolymorphism with hypertension in a Saudi population\nfrom Qassim Region. This polymorphism can be used as\nmarker for the susceptibility to hypertension among\naffected families, who can be counseled to avoid other\ninteractive environmental risk factors.\n"
