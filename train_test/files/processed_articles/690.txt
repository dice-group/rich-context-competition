Many studies of self-rated health show that it is a reliable predictor of mortality even when controlling\nfor health-related variables and status characteristics. According to previous research, one reason for the consistent find-\ning is that self-ratings of health represent judgments of health trajectories. Althogh self-ratings of health may be dy-\nnamic perceptions of health, relatively few studies have systematically examined this possibility.\nMethods. This study reexamines the prognostic value of self-ratings of health on mortality with data from 20 years\nof the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\u00adI Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (N  6,833). Special atten-\ntion is given to differences between White and African Americans.\nResults. Results indicate that event history models of mortality with self-rated health treated as a time-dependent co-\nvariate are superior to those treating it as a baseline predictor only--the latter are likely to underestimate the effect. More-\nover, self-ratings of health predict mortality for African Americans only when treated as a time-dependent covariate.\nDiscussion. The results suggest that self-ratings of health are sensitive to declines in physical health, especially those\nassociated with terminal drop. The analysis also demonstrates the importance of using dynamic models for studying the\nlink between self-rated health and mortality if data from multiple observation points are available.\nIDLER and Benyamini (1997) thoughtfully reviewed the\nburgeoning literature examining the link between self-\nrated (or self-assessed) health and mortality. They noted\nthat interest in the subject was spurred by research on the\nvalidity of lay reports of health information as well as the\ninfluence of psychosocial factors on health and longevity.\nThey identified more than 45 studies of the topic (Ben-\nyamini & Idler, 1999), and the findings are, in their words,\n\"impressively consistent.\" Self-rated health is an indepen-\ndent predictor of mortality in most studies, despite numer-\nous control variables, and the link appears especially strong\nfor men. Idler and Benyamini issued a call for a new gener-\nation of studies on the topic to examine more carefully four\nmajor interpretations for why self-rated health may predict\nmortality.\nThe present study focuses on one of the four interpreta-\ntions identified, namely that \"self-rated health is a dynamic\nevaluation, judging trajectory and not only current level of\nidence in the literature to support this interpretation, but\nmuch of the extant literature relies on baseline measures of\nself-rated health used to predict mortality at follow-up. Al-\nthough the modeling of mortality has been exemplary in\nmany of these studies, there are very few studies that exam-\nine how change in self-rated health is related to mortality.\nThis would appear to be a logical next step for studies of\nself-rated health and mortality, especially to determine the\nplausibility of the mechanism noted above (i.e., self-rated\nhealth is a dynamic evaluation). The present study uses data\nfrom a multiwave longitudinal national sample to compare\nstatic and dynamic models of the relationship between self-\nrated health and mortality. Extending findings on racial dif-\nferences in the validity of lay information, special attention\nis also given to determining whether the predictive validity\nof self-rated health on mortality differs for White and Afri-\ncan Americans.\nSelf-Rated Health as a Dynamic Evaluation\nOne explanation for the relationship between self-rated\nhealth and mortality is that people incorporate health status\nchanges into their health ratings. Indeed, one study that in-\ncluded both self-rated health and self-rated health decline\nfound each to be significantly associated with mortality in\nbivariate analyses, but that only the latter was significant in\nmultivariate analyses (Deeg, van Zonneveld, van der Maas,\n& Habbema, 1989). Although the standard question for self-\nrated health does not ask the person to account explicitly for\nchanges over time, it appears that respondents consider health\ntrajectories in rendering their ratings. It has been shown in\nseveral studies that change in morbidity and disability is re-\nlated to change in health ratings (e.g., Ferraro, Farmer, &\nWybraniec, 1997), thereby suggesting that self-rated health\nreflects, in part, the overall pattern of one's health trajectory.\nAs noted above, most of the literature on the relationship\nbetween self-rated health and mortality examines how base-\nline health ratings influence mortality (e.g., Borawski, Kinney,\nSchoenfeld, Malmrose, Blazer, Gold, & Seeman, 1994;\nstudy more carefully the dynamic evaluation thesis, how-\never, one needs repeated measures of health status, includ-\ning self-rated health, to determine if change in them is\nlinked to mortality. A small number of studies make use of\nany repeated measures, and these studies fall into one of two\ngroups. First, a few studies have examined change in vari-\nous health status measures, except self-rated health, as pre-\ndictors of mortality. Thomas, Kelman, Kennedy, Ahn, and\nYang (1992) examined changes in activities of daily living\n(ADLs) and health conditions, but baseline self-rated health\nremained significant after accounting for such changes. By\ncontrast, Wolinsky and colleagues found that accounting for\ndeclines in basic ADLs and lower body function rendered\nbaseline self-rated health nonsignificant in predicting mor-\ntality among respondents of the Longitudinal Study on Ag-\ning (Wolinsky, Callahan, Fitzgerald, & Johnson, 1993;\nSecond, we identified only two studies that examined\nwhether change in self-rated health was associated with\nmortality risk. These studies required a minimum of two in-\nterviews querying self-rated health followed by a mortality\ntracing. Sv\u00e4rdsudd and Tibblin (1990) studied Swedish men\nwith such a design (i.e., a 7-year re-interview and an 8-year\nsubsequent mortality follow-up). They found that declines\nin self-rated health were associated with higher mortality.\nStrawbridge and Wallhagen (1999) examined survival over\n28 years in the 4-wave Alameda County, California, study\nand reported that self-rated health remained a significant\npredictor of mortality even after accounting for the most re-\ncent information on health conditions.\nTaken together, these two groups of studies point to a\nneed for further research on how change in self-rated health\nmay be related to mortality. They supply the most solid evi-\ndence to date regarding the dynamic evaluation thesis, but\ncan be logically extended in many ways, two of which are\nconsidered in this research: (1) method of analysis and (2)\nconsideration of minority differences.\nModeling Mortality with Multiwave Data\nThe literature on self-rated health and mortality could be\nenhanced greatly by the application of more dynamic meth-\nods for analyzing multiwave data. Specifically, if two or\nmore waves of data are available with further mortality fol-\nlow-up, the application of time-dependent covariates would\nbe most helpful for analyzing how change in self-rated\nThe universe of models implementing time-dependent co-\nvariates is large, but we identified only one article that re-\nported such an analysis (Strawbridge & Wallhagen, 1999).\nFailure to account for changes in self-rated health in previ-\nous research may lead to underestimates of the relationship\nbetween self-rated health and mortality. Consider the sce-\nnario for a 4-wave panel study in which participants rated\ntheir health as good at the beginning of the survey, fair at\nwave 2, poor at wave 3, and died before the final wave. (In-\ndeed, eight respondents to the National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey\u00adI Epidemiologic Follow-up Study\n(NHEFS) fit this exact scenario with scores of 3, 2, and 1 on\nself-rated health over the first three waves.) With baseline\npredictors only, these respondents would be assumed to be\nin good health throughout the survey until death. The use of\ntime-dependent covariates would enable one to account for\nchanges over the survey period. In order to highlight the in-\nfluence of different types of analyses with multiwave data,\nwe compared results from models that do not incorporate\ntime-dependent covariates with those that do.\nModels that reflect the timing of changes in self-rated\nhealth are important to consider when testing the dynamic\nevaluation thesis. If mortality is perceived as a temporally\nproximal outcome of a health decline, one would expect that\nhealth ratings would reflect such concern. In essence, per-\nsons may believe that the pace of their health decline is rais-\ning the risk of mortality, or even that they are dying. Geron-\ntologists have long expressed interest in the concept of\nterminal drop (sometimes referred to as terminal decline or\nterminal change). Kleemeier (1962) introduced the concept\nof terminal drop by studying the relationship between test\nperformance and survival. He observed declines in test\nscores of men on several occasions over the course of 12\nyears; however, what was most striking was that the decline\nwas much greater for those who died after one of the data\ncollection periods as compared to those who survived dur-\ning that same interval. He observed that declines in intellec-\ntual performance may be detected \"several years prior to\nthe death of the person\" (p. 293, emphasis added).\nTerminal drop indicates that there is a determinant chain\nof functional changes that are due to a death process (Berg,\n1988). If self-rated health reflects a dynamic evaluation of\nhealth, then it should decline sharply in the period prior to\ndeath, and more dynamic models of self-rated health may\nuncover this phenomenon. Of course, how early such\nchanges may be observed is an empirical question. In the lit-\nerature examining terminal decline in cognitive functioning,\na few studies report declines as early as 7 years or more\nprior to death (Bosworth, Schaie, & Willis, 1999; Johansson\n& Berg, 1989). The bulk of the studies, however, examine\ntime windows of 1 to 5 years and show declines in selected\nfeatures of cognitive functioning (Jarvik & Blum, 1971; Jo-\ndynamic evaluation hypothesis is focused on whether peo-\nple might identify preclinical symptoms suggesting health\nproblems. Therefore, the relevant time window is much\nlonger than what people consider in cases of \"failure to\nthrive\" or \"dwindling\" in clinical settings (Egbert, 1996).\nAlso, key to our concerns is a recognition that the person is,\nto some degree, aware of the change in their health.\nSelf-Rated Health Among Minority Populations\nThe second innovation needed for research on self-rated\nhealth and mortality is a systematic consideration of minor-\nity populations. Idler and Benyamini (1997) conclude their\nreview of studies of self-rated health and mortality by offer-\ning four suggestions for the \"next stage of studies.\" Two of\ntheir recommendations focus on studying \"special popula-\ntions\" and \"cognitive/cultural processes.\" These are superb\nsuggestions, but we would like to add to the list a greater\nconsideration of minority health and aging. Ethnic minority\ngroup members can be considered a special population, and\ncultural factors are certainly a part of ethnicity. Neverthe-\nless, very little attention has been given to ethnic or racial\ndifferences in the predictive validity of self-ratings of health\non mortality. The literature includes a number of studies of\npopulations with limited ethnic or racial variation, either in\nthe United States (Borawski et al., 1996) or other countries\n(Shahtahmasebi, Davies, & Wenger, 1992); some of this is\nprobably due to the composition of the population. Never-\ntheless, there are numerous studies of the United States or\nother diverse societies that do not give systematic consider-\nation to ethnic or racial differences (Deeg et al., 1989; Ka-\nGiven the substantial health inequality in American soci-\nety by racial and ethnic groupings, one would expect more\ninterest in the topic. Dozens of studies of morbidity, disabil-\nity, and health ratings across the life course reveal that Afri-\ncan and Hispanic Americans have poorer health (American\nHummer, 1996). Many members of ethnic minorities have\nless frequent or delayed contacts with physicians (Himmel-\ning that they may also be less likely to have a definitive di-\nagnosis about conditions that bother them (and thus present\nto a physician at a more advanced illness stage). Indeed,\nsome research shows that African Americans exaggerate\ntheir subjective probability of survival (Hurd & McGarry,\n1995). Thus, one wonders if self-ratings of health have less\npredictive validity on mortality for minority group mem-\nbers. In a study comparing White and African Americans,\nFerraro and Farmer (1999) found that self-reports of mor-\nbidity were equally predictive of mortality for both groups,\nbut whether the same holds true for self-rated health re-\nmains to be seen. Many studies do not even include a con-\ntrol for racial or ethnic variation (e.g., Thomas et al., 1992);\nof those that do, none have examined whether change in\nself-rated health is predictive of mortality. In short, we are\nunaware of any studies that compare the predictive utility of\nself-ratings of health on mortality across U.S. ethnic groups.\nThe present analysis is designed as a first step to fill this gap\nby examining the predictive validity of self-rated health\nover time on the mortality of White and African American\nrespondents. The basic research questions addressed are\ntwofold:\n1. Is change in self-rated health associated with higher mor-\ntality risk? We will answer this question by comparing\nthe use of models with and without time-dependent cova-\nriates to highlight the contribution of changes in self-\nrated health. It is anticipated that self-rated health will\nmanifest a stronger relationship to mortality in models\nwith time-dependent covariates.\n2. Is the predictive validity of self-rated health on mortality\ncontingent on race? Given the substantial health inequality\nin American society, we ask whether self-rated health has\nless utility for predicting mortality among Black adults.\nMETHODS\nSample\nData for this research are from the NHEFS. A multistage,\nstratified, probability sample of noninstitutionalized persons\nreceived a medical examination and survey interview in\nistered in modules, and this analysis proceeds with those re-\nspondents who were administered the detailed component\nincluding the health care needs questionnaire (n  6,913).\n1984, and the next two follow-ups were in subsequent 5-year\nand operational procedures is provided elsewhere (Cornoni-\nHuntley, Huntley, & Feldman, 1990; National Center for\nParts of this analysis focus on differences in outcomes\nbased on race. At the baseline, respondents were asked to\nspecify their race (White, \"Negro,\" or Other) only if the an-\nswer could not be visually determined by the interviewer.\nDue to the small number of other racial and ethnic groups\n(i.e., 41 Asian Americans), further subsample analyses with\nthese groups were not possible. The present study analyzes\nvey who were followed across time. Response rates among\nthose who received the detailed components were very high\nnumber of accumulated deaths over the approximate 20-\nsurvey is referred to as a wave (W); the first wave is consid-\nered W1 (or baseline).\nMeasures\nThe measurement of self-rated health in NHEFS was a\nsingle question asked at each wave: \"In general, is your\nhealth excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?\" Excellent\nhealth is scored 5 and poor health is scored 1. Although\nsome researchers have found it useful to examine contrasts\nbetween specific categories of self-rated health (or aggre-\ngates of those categories), the linear form of self-rated\nhealth was used here for two principal reasons. First, we de-\nsired to avoid the coarseness involved by collapsing the five\nresponses into fewer categories. Second, treating self-rated\nhealth as a time-dependent covariate is far more parsimoni-\nous when the original form is retained.\nIn order to assure that the relationship between self-rated\nhealth and mortality is not spurious, most investigators have\nincluded a broad array of independent variables including\nmorbidity and status characteristics and resources. Morbid-\nity is measured with two variables, both counts of diagnosed\nhealth conditions. The National Health and Nutrition Exam-\nination Survey\u00adI (NHANES\u00adI) differs from many other sur-\nveys by asking if the respondent had been diagnosed with a\nparticular health condition rather than relying on respondent\nopinion. Respondents were asked, \"Has a doctor ever told\nyou that you have . . . hypertension or high blood pressure?\"\nEach condition was first coded as a binary variable (1\nequals condition is present). Next, separate sums of serious\nand chronic nonserious conditions were created (Ferraro &\ntions, those that are life threatening, include cancer, diabe-\ntes, heart failure (attack or trouble), hypertension, and\nstroke. Chronic nonserious conditions asked at all waves in-\nclude arthritis, cataracts, hip fracture, and kidney trouble.\nSeveral measures of health behavior were included in the\nanalysis. First, respondents were asked two questions re-\ngarding their amount of daily physical activity: \"In things\nyou do for recreation, for example, sports, hiking, dancing,\netc., do you get much exercise, moderate exercise, little, or\nno exercise?\" and \"In your usual day, aside from recreation,\nare you physically very active, moderately active, or quite\ninactive?\" Subjects who answered \"little or no exercise\" on\nthe first question and \"quite inactive\" on the second were\nconsidered quite inactive and coded 1 for restricted activity;\nall others were coded 0. Second, survey respondents were\nasked if they had a regular physician for their health needs\n(1  yes, 0  no). Finally, current smokers and past smok-\ners of cigarettes, cigars, or pipes were separated out in bi-\nnary variables, 1 indicating yes and 0 indicating no.\nIndicators of socioeconomic status include income (ranges\n(ranges from 0 to 7, with 7 equal to graduate school). Those\nwith private medical insurance and recipients of Medicaid\nare indicated by binary variables (1 equals yes).\nThe measurement of the other covariates is fairly straight-\nforward. Female, Black, lives alone, widowed, and lives in a\nrural community are all dichotomous where 1 equals the\nname of the variable. Respondents with a body mass index\n(BMI) equal to or greater than 30 are considered obese and\ncoded 1 (all others are coded 0). Given the nonlinear rela-\ntionship between BMI and many health outcomes, under-\nweight respondents--BMI less than 18.5--were also identi-\nfied and coded 1 (all others are coded 0). In order to account\nfor the possible influence of psychological distress on both\nself-rated health and mortality, a self-rating of \"strain, stress,\nor pressure in the last month\" was also included (Farmer &\neral additional variables were considered in preliminary\nanalyses, but deleted from subsequent consideration after\nthey did not manifest a significant relationship with mortal-\nity in multivariate models (e.g., South, overweight [BMI \n25 and  30]). Unfortunately, measures of social support or\nsocial networks are conspicuously missing in NHEFS. Item-\nmissing data were modest (i.e., 5%) and were handled via\nand race categories (Little & Schenker, 1995).\nVital status was determined at the follow-up surveys for\nall traced respondents and confirmed by death certificates.\nBrief interviews were conducted with proxies of the de-\nceased respondents. Date of death was obtained for 1,935\ndecedents, so continuous-time event history models were\napplied. (Only all-cause mortality is considered; disease-\nspecific cause of death, from death certificates, is not used.)\nFor additional analyses related to identifying the time win-\ndow for the dynamic evaluation thesis, four categories of vi-\ntal status were created based on the timing of death relative\nto each survey: died within 12 months of the survey; died\nmonths after the survey and the time of the next survey; and\nsurvived. This process was repeated for waves 2 and 3. For\nanalyses for each wave, binary variables differentiating the\ncategories were tested against a reference group of those\nwho survived to the next survey wave. Mortality data are\nnot available past the fourth wave.\nAnalytic Plan\nAlthough our preferred analytic strategy is to apply time-\ndependent covariates in proportional hazards models, the\nanalyses were completed with additional strategies to com-\npare findings. First, the analysis began with event history\nmodels specifying baseline self-rated health as predictive of\nmortality--parallel to the common approach in the recent\nliterature (e.g., Bernard et al., 1997). Second, we specified\nseveral types of models with time-dependent covariates (Al-\nThere are many different ways to implement time-depen-\ndent covariates, but the simplest uses the most recent value\navailable. If no changes are reported, baseline information\nis used. If change is reported, the value reported at the most\nrecent observation is used. A second type of model uses the\nmost recent values but scales them by time of observation\nplaced on the most recent value. Although no information\non initial values is used for those persons who changed their\nrating, the time of the most recent value is incorporated in\nthe analysis. Knowing when the most recent value was ob-\nserved is a critical piece of information when there are three\nor more data collection points.\nA third type of time-dependent covariate analysis builds\nupon the preceding approach but incorporates change in the\ncovariate. Both the initial value and all transitions in the co-\nvariate are used to estimate the partial-likelihood function.\nThis approach may be described as time-indexed change be-\ncause three pieces of information regarding change in the\ncovariate are parsimoniously incorporated into the partial-\nindexed change captures the magnitude (i.e., unit change in\nself-rated health), direction (i.e., increase or decrease), and\ntiming of the transition(s). If the dynamic evaluation thesis\nis correct, self-rated health should remain a significant pre-\ndictor in these models. Indeed, one may expect that its asso-\nciation with mortality will be stronger.\nWe estimated selected analyses with all three approaches\nand compared them to the results predicated on baseline\nvalues only. All of the models with time-dependent covari-\nates yielded the same substantive conclusions, but the mag-\nnitude of effects varied slightly. Whereas model fit was su-\nperior for the time-indexed change analysis, those results\nwill be presented in the following section and compared to\nthose from models using baseline information only.\nAs noted above, the time between survey waves is fairly\nlong, leading to the possibility of coarseness in the model-\ning of mortality. Especially for the first follow-up, self-rat-\nings of health may have declined during the 10 years, but\nthis was not measured among respondents who died. The likely\neffect of this would be an underestimate of the association\nof self-rated health on mortality. In order to test for potential\ncoarseness, we estimated what Allison (1995) refers to as ad\nhoc models of time-dependent covariates. We incorporated\na time stamp to estimate changes in self-rated health using\nthe baseline characteristics and follow-up information when\navailable. Two strategies for these regression imputations\nwere used: (a) imputing integer values of self-rated health,\nand (b) imputing noninteger values. Both methods yielded\nresults that were very similar to our findings, suggesting\nthat potential bias due to the coarseness of measurement in-\ntervals is minimal.\nTo summarize, our analysis proceeded in three stages.\nFirst, we estimated the models described here to compare\nthe results. Second, we used the time-indexed change mod-\nels to incorporate more than one time-dependent covariate.\nConsistent with our interest in minority aging, these models\nwere estimated on the total and race-specific subsamples.\nFinally, we examined the timing of declines in self-rated\nhealth on mortality with retrospective analyses. Self-rated\nhealth at each of the first three waves of the study was re-\ngressed on vital status after the respective survey. The timing\nof death was used to delineate categories of deceased subjects\nanticipating that self-rated health would be lower for those\ndying shortly after the survey.\nTable 1.

W1  Wave 1.\nRESULTS\nThe results of the baseline and time-dependent covariate\nanalyses are presented in Table 1 (with 95% confidence in-\ntervals). Risk ratios (RR) and confidence intervals (CI) are\npresented for the total sample and separately for Black and\nWhite respondents. The first equation (column) indicates\nthat, consistent with the bulk of the literature, poor self-\nrated health at baseline (W1) is associated with a greater\nrisk of mortality for the total sample (RR  0.91). Serious\nillness is also associated with higher mortality, as are re-\nstricted activity and age. Higher mortality is also observed\nfor men, African Americans, the tails of the BMI distribu-\ntion (i.e., obese and underweight persons), current smokers,\nand those with limited socioeconomic resources (less in-\ncome, lacking private medical insurance, and on Medicaid).\nPast smoker is not a significant predictor, perhaps because\nof the long time frame for NHEFS (the duration of not\nsmoking is longer, thereby reducing the effect of past smok-\ning on mortality). Mortality did not differ for rural and ur-\nban respondents after controlling for the other variables, but\npersons reporting more distress in their lives manifested\nhigher mortality risk.\nAlthough the subsample analyses are similar in many re-\nspects, there are some notable differences for the Black and\nWhite respondents. First, self-rated health is not a signifi-\ncant predictor of mortality for African Americans, but it is\nfor White persons. Second, the effects of some of the health\nstatus and health behavior variables are different across the\ntwo groups (chronic illness, restricted activity, and obesity).\nFinally, the socioeconomic variables have somewhat differ-\nent effects. For example, private medical insurance reduces\nmortality for White respondents but not for Black respon-\ndents. The association between Medicaid and mortality that\nwas observed in the full sample is observed only in the\nBlack subsample when race-specific models are estimated.\nThe next set of equations (last 3 columns) presents the re-\nsults from the analysis where self-rated health is treated as a\ntime-dependent covariate. For the total sample, self-rated\nhealth is again significant, but the effect is much stronger\nwhen treated as a time-dependent covariate, thereby provid-\ning evidence for the dynamic evaluation thesis. The pattern\nof significant findings is almost identical to what was ob-\nserved in the first equation, where only baseline self-rated\nhealth was considered, and the effects of most variables are\nsimilar. One notable difference between the first and fourth\nequations is the effect of distress. Although distress pre-\ndicted mortality in the first equation, treating self-rated\nhealth as a time-dependent covariate rendered the effect due\nto distress nonsignificant. This is an important observation\nbecause many of the previous studies reporting a link be-\ntween distress or depression and mortality may have been\nreflecting concern about unmeasured declining health.\nIn the equation for the African American subsample,\ntreating self-rated health as a time-dependent covariate\nleads to different results from what was seen in the earlier\nmodel. Self-rated health, including change in it, is strongly\nlinked to mortality risk, although such a conclusion could\nnot be derived from the baseline predictor model. This\nmeans that African Americans, just as their White counter-\nparts, adjust their health ratings in such a way that is predic-\ntive of mortality. While the effects of many of the covariates\non mortality are similar to those in the baseline model, the\nmagnitude of effects for several variables changes. Many of\nthe effects are reduced slightly, but some are actually\ngreater once accounting for self-rated health as a time-de-\npendent covariate (probably reflecting suppression). For ex-\nample, the effect due to serious illness is larger in the model\nwith self-rated health treated as a time-dependent covariate.\nAs anticipated, the results for the White sample are quite\nsimilar to the results for the total sample. Given the differ-\nences observed across the Black and White subsamples, a\nnumber of interactions with race were tested (i.e., age, self-\nreported health), but none were significant.\nThe results thus far reveal substantial support for the idea\nthat self-rated health is a dynamic evaluation; it reflects tra-\njectories at least as they pertain to mortality risk. This is an\nimportant finding, but it is possible that incident morbidity\nduring the study could be at least partly responsible for the\ngreater mortality risk. While Fisher and Lin (1999) assert\nthat \"the use of time-dependent covariates offers exciting\nopportunities for exploring associations and potentially\ncausal mechanisms\" (p. 146), they also argue that these\nanalyses must be approached with caution. In particular,\nthey note that there is the \"possibility of too much modeling\nand overfitting of a data set\" (p. 152). With two measures\nfor morbidity (serious and chronic, nonserious), we fol-\nlowed their advice and treated one morbidity variable as\ntime dependent at a time. (We also tested for several other\nsignificant time-dependent covariates--one at a time--but\nfound none.) The results, presented in Table 2, compare\nmodels with and without self-rated health as time depen-\ndent, but where morbidity is time dependent throughout.\nThe results for the total sample in Table 2 reveal that self-\nrated health remains a strong predictor of mortality even\nwhen morbidity is treated as a time-dependent covariate.\nThis relationship is evident when using baseline self-rated\nhealth or treating self-rated health as time dependent (model\n2). The magnitude of the relationship is reduced somewhat\nby also considering two forms of morbidity as time depen-\nrespectively).\nThe race-specific results in Table 2 show again that self-\nrated health is a significant predictor of mortality for Afri-\ncan Americans only when it is treated as a time-dependent\ncovariate. Neither of the morbidity variables is significant\nfor the Black subsample in Table 2. For the White subsam-\nple, mortality risk is shaped by self-rated health in both\nmodels (used as a baseline or time-dependent predictor), but\nthe magnitude of the relationship is reduced compared to\nTable 1 results. In short, incident morbidity during the study\nwas partly responsible for the greater mortality risk associ-\nated with changing self-rated health. Nevertheless, for both\nWhite and African Americans, the link between changing\nself-rated health and mortality persists after controlling for\nchanging morbidity.\nGiven the differences in the number of cases in the White\nand Black subsamples, supplementary analyses were under-\ntaken to assure that the differences between the subsamples\nare not simply the result of the larger subsample of White\nrespondents. First, the equation for the White subsample\nwas reestimated on a random sample of 814 respondents in\norder to match the frequency of the Black subsample. The\nsecond set of analyses involved taking a subsample of\nWhite respondents so that the number of deceased persons\nequaled those deceased in the Black subsample. Given the\nlower mortality of White respondents, the first approach--\nmatching the number of Black cases--yields fewer deaths\nin the White subsample. Therefore, we also reestimated the\nmodels on a slightly larger sample of White respondents\n(n  1,179) so that the number of deaths (outcome variable)\nwas equal across Black and White respondents. This set of\nanalyses confirmed all of the significant relationships re-\nported with the total White sample. Although the effects of\nsome of the covariates were slightly different in the two ap-\nproaches, the findings and conclusions regarding self-rated\nhealth and well-known risk factors (e.g., serious illness, fe-\nmale, age) were consistent across both of these sets of esti-\nmates and the results presented.\nThe final step in our analysis is designed to clarify the\nchanges in self-rated health that occur as a result of ap-\nTable 2.

Self-rated health at the\nfirst three waves of the study was regressed on four catego-\nries of vital status based on the timing of death relative to\neach survey wave: died within 12 months, died between 13\nand 24 months, died between 25 months and the time of the\nnext survey, and survivors. The logic of these analyses is to\nexploit the longitudinal data by \"retroactively\" considering\nhow proximity to death may have influenced self-rated\nhealth. Figure 1 displays the mean levels of self-rated health\nfor each of the four vital status categories at each wave. It\nappears that there is a terminal drop phenomenon on self-\nrated health for those respondents who died within 1 year of\nthe survey. The effect is strongest for the most proximate\ndeaths (within 1 year after being interviewed), but remains\nsubstantial for all of the decedents between survey waves.\nPeople adjust their health ratings to reflect the health prob-\nlems experienced in the last few years of their lives.\nTable 3 presents the results of multiple regression analy-\nses for each wave where binary variables differentiating the\nvital status categories were tested against a reference group\nfor those who survived to the next survey wave. These mod-\nels also include the independent variables considered ear-\nlier. (Whereas the first interval between waves is 10 years\nand the intervals between the last three waves are 5 years\neach, a dummy variable for more than 5 years is included in\nanalyses for the first follow-up.) For the first equation,\ndeath within one year was the only vital status dummy vari-\nable significant in the equation. After controlling for the\nother independent variables, only the most temporally prox-\nimate deaths are associated with lower self-rated health,\nsuggesting that terminal drop is reflected in self-rated health\nin the year prior to death. For the second and third waves,\nall deaths between survey waves, regardless of when they\noccurred, are associated with lower self-rated health; this\nsuggests that self-rated health is adjusted even earlier than\none year prior to death. There are several reasons why the\nfindings may differ from W1 to W2 and W3, but one seems\nmost plausible. As is common in national health surveys,\nthe NHEFS baseline interview was completed on noninsti-\nFigure 1.

The effects of most of the remaining variables are\nconsistent with the literature on self-rated health. Morbidity,\nage, race, and socioeconomic variables are all significantly\nrelated to self-rated health.\nDISCUSSION\nThe literature on self-rated health has proliferated in the\npast decade, and the bulk of the studies finds that self-rated\nhealth is a remarkably consistent predictor of mortality de-\nspite controlling for numerous variables. The purpose of the\npresent study has been to extend the literature in two ways:\n(1) to apply more dynamic models for examining the rela-\ntionship between self-rated health and mortality, and (2) to\ngive greater attention to minority health ratings.\nFirst, we sought to systematically examine Idler and Ben-\nyamini's (1997) thesis that self-rated health is a dynamic\nevaluation of health: Does self-rated health reflect a per-\nson's health trajectory? While it seems reasonable to assert\nthat self-rated health reflects a dynamic evaluation of health\nstatus, there have been very few studies that systematically\nexamine such a thesis. There have been dozens of studies\nthat examined whether baseline self-rated health is related\nto mortality, and one that examined whether the expectation\nof declining health was independently related to mortality\n(Wolinsky & Tierney, 1998). A few studies have also exam-\nined how self-rated health affects the probabilistic assess-\nment of life expectancy (Hurd, McFadden, & Gan, 1998;\nHurd & McGarry, 1995). We are aware of only two studies,\nhowever, that use repeated measures of self-rated health to\nexamine how change in the ratings is related to mortality\n(Strawbridge & Wallhagen, 1999; Sv\u00e4rdsudd & Tibblin,\n1990). Unlike those studies, the present research used a na-\ntionally representative sample while treating self-rated\nhealth as a time-dependent covariate. It also tested explicitly\nfor differences in the effect of self-rated health on mortality\nfor Whites and African Americans. We hope to see more\nstudies that will examine these relationships with different\nsamples and different time lags.\nThe findings from the NHEFS offer some of the most\nsystematic evidence to date that self-rated health reflects\nhealth trajectories, especially the steep declines associated\nwith death after the last survey measurement. Not only was\nbaseline self-rated health predictive of mortality for NHEFS\nrespondents, but models of change in self-rated health\nshowed a stronger relationship with mortality risk. One con-\nclusion from this study, therefore, is that self-rated health is\nprobably a stronger predictor of mortality than has been re-\nported in many previous studies. Many of the previous stud-\nies that relied on baseline self-rated health to predict mortal-\nity had fairly long lag times (e.g., 28 years, Deeg et al.,\n1989). The fact that baseline self-rated health is an indepen-\ndent predictor of mortality with such long lag times is an\nimportant finding, because longer lag times work against\nfinding such an effect (or underestimating such an effect).\nAccounting for more recent health ratings among the\nNHEFS survivors shows that the association between self-\nrated health and mortality is even stronger than estimates\nderived using baseline self-rated health alone. Moreover,\nestimating mortality with both morbidity and self-rated\nhealth treated as time-dependent covariates accounts not\nonly for the more recent ratings, but also the transitions in\nhealth ratings from wave to wave among those who survive.\nAnother way to consider whether self-rated health is a\ndynamic evaluation is whether terminal drop reflects itself\non self-rated health. That is, if self-rated health reflects a\nperson's health trajectory, one would expect that temporal\nproximity to death would be associated with the steepest de-\nclines in self-rated health. In essence, evidence for steep de-\nclines in self-rated health associated with mortality risk\nwould suggest that people are, to some degree, aware of ter-\nminal drop and adjust their health ratings accordingly.\nEvidence from the NHEFS shows that declines in self-\nrated health precede most deaths within a 1-year follow-up\nperiod. The models presented in Table 3 for W2 and W3 are\nresidualized change analyses, and in both equations persons\nwho died within 12 months after the previous interview\nshowed a decline in self-rated health. It is clear from these\nanalyses that people adjust their health ratings to reflect\ntheir mortality risk, and that change in self-rated health as-\nsociated with terminal drop is not solely a function of\nchanging morbidity. We conclude that Idler and Benyamini\n(1997) were quite correct in suggesting from previous re-\nsearch that self-ratings of health \"reflect a dynamic, rather\nthan static, perspective on health\" (p. 29). While their sug-\ngestion was based on a thoughtful reading of a literature that\nwas dominated by fairly static models, the findings from the\npresent investigation based on more dynamic models offer\nsome of the most compelling evidence that this is the case.\nThe second major contribution of the present research is\nto give greater attention to minority health ratings in the\nprediction of mortality (and exhort others to do likewise in\nfuture research). In the most simple of terms, one wonders\nwhether self-rated health \"works\" as a predictor of mortality\nfor minority groups. Many minority groups, especially Afri-\ncan Americans studied in detail here, are health disadvan-\ntaged and limited in various ways to quality medical care\n(Himmelstein & Woolhandler, 1995; Wolinsky et al.,\n1989). Thus, the question of whether African American\nself-rated health operates as a predictor has important policy\nimplications. Do African Americans interpret and respond\nto a question about their self-rated health in the same way\nthat White Americans do? Do Black persons understand\nthat they are approaching their death? Given the concerns\nabout early detection of disease, are they aware of their\nmortality risk due to incident disease?\nThe answers to these questions will differ depending\nupon the mode of analysis. Findings from the NHEFS that\nrely on baseline self-rated health show that self-rated health\ndoes not predict mortality risk. By contrast, models incorpo-\nrating self-rated health as a time-dependent covariate show\nthat they do. Three conclusions are inescapable. First, one\nwould reach absolutely contradictory results depending\nupon model specification. Second, models incorporating\ntime-dependent covariates are superior inasmuch as they ac-\ncount for transitions in self-rated health among survivors.\nThird, African Americans are quite perceptive of their\nhealth declines, including the rapid declines associated with\nterminal drop. Moreover, even adding morbidity as a time-\ndependent covariate did not negate the effect of self-rated\nhealth as a predictor of mortality. Self-ratings of health\nwork just as well for African Americans as they do for\nWhites if the models incorporate change in health ratings.\nWe believe that this study is only a first step in what Idler\nand Benyamini (1997) call \"the next stage of studies.\" There\nare several lines of research that we believe merit further and\nmore detailed examination. First, the present investigation\nhas systematically examined one minority group only.\nWhether the findings extend to Hispanic, Native, or Asian\nAmericans is not known. Second, we agree with Idler and\nBenyamini's (1997) call for pursuing qualitative approaches\nto the subject of health ratings and mortality. Several of these\nstudies have shed important light on the topic (e.g., Krause &\nJay, 1994), and we believe that ethnographic analyses of the\nhealth trajectory thesis could be an important contribution.\nThird, we disagree with Idler and Benyamini's (1997) asser-\ntion that \"researchers are fast approaching, if not already\nreaching, the limits of what secondary analysis of these large,\nlongitudinal data sets can tell us about the relationship be-\ntween self-ratings of health and mortality. There is a point\nwhen replication becomes redundancy\" (p. 31).\nWhile we agree that isomorphic replications of previous\nstudies may not yield much in the way of scientific or health\npolicy value, we disagree that secondary analysis is neces-\nsarily \"approaching something of an impasse in understand-\ning\" (p. 34). Rather, we assert that the rich multiwave data\nsets that include repeated measures of self-rated health (and\nother health variables) open up a new vista of studies that\ncan incorporate more dynamic models of self-rated health\nand mortality. Those types of analyses may help us to better\nunderstand Idler and Benyamini's (1997) assertion that self-\nrated health involves the assessment of one's health trajec-\ntory and not only the current level of health. There are other\nissues, such as a better understanding of minority health rat-\nings, that can be gleaned from such quantitative analyses of\nlarge data sets. A number of such large prospective studies\nare underway, and we hope that investigations comparing\nvarious ethnic or racial groups will ensue.\nWhichever direction the literature on self-rated health\nand mortality flows, the findings from the present analysis\nprovide systematic evidence for the assertion that health rat-\nings reflect a dynamic perspective on health. People adjust\ntheir ratings of health in a way that is associated with mor-\ntality risk, and this phenomenon is clearly observed in the\nyear prior to death reflective of terminal drop. The changes\nin health ratings can be observed for both White and Afri-\ncan Americans only when dynamic models of self-rated\nhealth and mortality are estimated.\n"
