In particular, researchers such as\nIkels (1983) suggest that increased geographic dis-\ntance between the parent and adult child reduces the\nprobability of the child caring for the parent, and\ninvestigators such as Wolf and Soldo (1988) suggest\nthat labor force participation of the child reduces the\nprobability of the child caring for the parent. How-\namong others, suggest that the causation runs the\nother way. These authors are inferring causation\nfrom what is essentially a correlation. A few research-\ners measure causation controlling for variation in\nother explanatory factors (Cutler & Sheiner, 1993;\nWolf & Soldo, 1991), but none seriously deal with\ncausation potentially working in both directions.\nCutler and Sheiner (1993) are concerned about the\nissue when choosing policy measures, and Soldo et\nal. (1990) worry about it when defining care alterna-\ntives. But neither uses an estimation method to con-\ntrol for the problem. Boaz and Muller (1992) condi-\ntion on positive hours of caregiving and then find\nsmall effects both ways.\nTheory suggests that causation can run either or\nboth ways. It is reasonable to assume that children\nfar away are not well suited to provide care, and that\nworking children have other serious demands upon\ntheir time. It also is reasonable to assume that a child\n(or a parent) will move closer to facilitate caregiving\n^ h e Bankard fund provided generous support for this study. The author\nthanks Mike Palumbo, Jon Skinner, Jim Hamilton, Toni Braun, Frank Wolak,\nDouglas Wolf, Tom Mroz, Rosalie Young, Steven Nock, and Jim Berkovec\nfor helpful comments, Amy Crews, Anne Culati, and Jennifer Elise Novak\nfor excellent research assistance, and Peggy Pasternak for manuscript\npreparation.\n2 Address correspondence, including requests for data or computer pro-\ngrams, to Dr. Steven Stern, Department of Economics, University of Vir-\nor that a child will reduce work hours to provide\nbetter care. Whether these arguments are true is an\nempirical question and one that cannot be answered\nby measuring one or two correlations.\nThis study applies nonlinear estimation techniques\ndeveloped to look at the causation question for these\ndata in Stern (1995). It uses a sample of families from\nthe National Long-Term Care Survey. The model\nestimates imply that there is a particular hierarchy of\ncausation. First, children choose where to live inde-\npendent of parent long-term care needs. Then, once\nthe parent requires care, the family decides who\nshould provide care while taking into account the\ndistance between the parent and each child (along\nwith other relevant criteria). Finally, the child who\nprovides care decides whether to continue working,\ntaking into account his or her care responsibilities.\nThe next sections of this article describe the data to\nbe used, the model and estimation procedure; and\nprovide estimates and simulation results based on\nthose estimates.\nThe Data\nThe data are from the National Long-Term Care\nSurvey (NLTCS), a sample of families with a parent at\nleast 65 years old with an activity of daily living (ADL)\nproblem or instrumental activity of daily living (IADL)\nproblem lasting at least three months (Macken,\n1986). Elderly people who passed a series of screen-\ning questions were surveyed in 1982 about their\nliving arrangements and reinterviewed in 1984.\n(There is another wave of the NLTCS in 1989 not used\nin this study.) From an original sample of 25,401,\nfailed the 1982 screening test (and thus were not\nasked any of the relevant questions), and 1,306 ob-\nservations were rejected because they did not an-\n76 The Gerontologist\nwere lost because of missing information on sex,\nrace, age, or education of the parent (with no reason-\nable way to impute the missing value), and 642 were\nlost because of missing information on the number\nof children. This left 3,447 parents for whom there\nwas information on all of the essential variables or for\nwhom there was enough to confidently impute the\nmissing variable values.\nMany of the same imputation techniques of Wolf\nand Soldo (1991) are used here, although others are\nadded to avoid missing value problems. For exam-\nple, if the parent's observed sex is different in the\ntwo years but a spouse's sex is constant, the parent's\nsex is adjusted, assuming a traditional marriage. Ad-\njustments are made to the parents' and children's\nages to make them consistent with the passage of\ntime. Finally, children's sex is adjusted so that sex\ndistribution within a family is consistent over time\n(e.g., it is impossible to add sons or daughters).\nThe means and standard deviations of important\nvariables for parents are listed in Table 1. The sample\nAbout two-thirds of the sample is female, 56% have\nno spouse, and people have a high number of prob-\nlems with ADLs and other functional limitations\n(OFLs) relative to the United States population of the\nsame age (because of the NLTCS screening rules).\nOFL variables are IADL problems and other func-\ntional limitations. ADL and OFL variables are listed in\nAppendix A. No one lives in a nursing home in 1982\nbecause of the NLTCS sampling procedure. Some of\nthe estimation procedures used in this study restrict\nthe sample to those who receive no significant help\nfrom children in 1982. For those procedures, the\nThe key variable in this analysis is the care provi-\nsion for the parent. The parent is asked to list each\nchild (either at home or away from home) and\nwhether he or she provides help. If only one child is\nlisted as providing help, that child is designated the\nprimary caregiver. If more than one child is listed, a\ntie-breaking rule (with hours of care provision as its\nTable 1.

Even if the spouse provides\nmore care than any of the children, the child provid-\ning the most care is labeled the primary care pro-\nvider. This is done because the purpose of the re-\nsearch is to identify factors determining care choices\noutside the home. If no child is listed, then the\nparent is designated as \"living alone.\" The parent is\nconsidered to be \"living alone\" even if a spouse,\nsibling, friend, or paid care provider is present. The\nparent's \"living alone\" category is aggregated by\nmarital status because it is improper to define alter-\nnatives for the endogenous variable in terms of an\nexogenous variable. The other categories (care from\nsibling, friend, or paid care provider) are aggregated\ninto this group because (a) there are not enough\nobservations for each separate category, and (b) it is\nnot observed whether each category is an available\noption (e.g., there is no information in the data about\nsiblings of the parent). If the parent lives in a nursing\nhome, then the nursing home is the primary care-\ngiver. The proportion of parents receiving help from\nachild is much lower in this study than in other work,\nsuch as Wolf and Soldo (1991), because married and\nunmarried parents of both sexes and people in nurs-\ning homes are included here.\nThe NLTCS includes an income variable for each\nparent but it is not used because (a) it is missing for\n529 people, and (b) it is bracketed and imprecise for\nall people, especially those living with children or in\na nursing home. A continuous measure of income\nwas experimented with for all observations using the\ntechnology in Stern (1991). However, there were\nclear signs of unspecified nonlinearities and selec-\ntion bias, and thus it was not used.\nchild characteristics are presented in Table 2. Obvi-\nously, there is something wrong with the reporting\nnumbers are treated as a proxy for the unreported,\ncorrect 1984 numbers. Also, the number of living\nchildren reported declines too much between 1982\nnational data (Table 1). Part of this decline is due to\nmortality. But part of it is due to parents losing\ncontact with some of their children. This loss of\nTable 2.

On the\nother hand, the NLTCS is the only large data set with\nsufficient information to address long-term care is-\nsues in a family context. The data set used by Kotli-\nkoff and Morris (1988), for example, is much smaller\nand somewhat specialized, while other data sets do\nnot include sufficient information about all of the\nchildren in the family.\nThe estimation procedure relies on transitions of\nthe parent and child explanatory variables over time.\nIn particular, the primary estimation method condi-\ntions on the parent living alone in 1982 and then uses\nvariables to explain transitions from living alone to\nother care alternatives. In fact, conditional on living\n3,049 changes in existence of different ADL prob-\nlems, 14,192 changes in existence of different OFL\nproblems, and 1,341 changes in child or parent resi-\ndence observed in the data. Thus, there is certainly\nsufficient variation in the data to estimate the models\nto be described. The other estimation methods do\nnot condition on living alone in 1982 and thus use\nvariation across both time and families to explain\nvariation in care alternatives.\nEstimation Methodology\nThis section describes the model's equations (and\nparameters) to be estimated and provides the reader\nwith intuition about the estimation procedure. The\nreader interested in the details of the estimation\nprocedure may request that Appendix from the au-\nThe model is described by three equations. The\nfirst determines the value to a family of using a partic-\nular long-term care arrangement; the second deter-\nmines the value of each child in the sample working;\nand the third determines where a child decides to live\nrelative to the parent. It is assumed that long-term\ncare alternatives are (a) to have each child alive at t\ncare for the parent; (b) have the parent live alone\nwithout any care from a child; or (c) have the parent\nlive in a nursing home. In many families there are\nmultiple caregivers, but almost always one child as-\nsumes the role of primary caregiver (Cantor, 1983).\nThus, in a family with N children, there are N + 2 care\nalternatives. For this study I assume that a family\nmakes the decision that maximizes the sum of utilities\nto all family members. Engers and Stern (1995) and\nHeidemann and Stern (1995) construct family\ndecision-making models where there are important\ndifferences in the interests of different family mem-\nbers and where family members act strategically.\nWhile the estimation results are different, most of the\nresults are qualitatively similar. Let yj be the value to\nfamily i of choosing the jth care alternative at time t for\nwork status of child j, the distance between child j and\nthe parent, other observed explanatory variables, and\nsome unobserved explanatory variables.\nThe variable y,* is not observed. Instead, yijt\nis\nobserved which is equal to 1 if and only if family i\nchooses choice j at time t. It is assumed that yijt\nand only if y,* > yj, for all k =\n\u00a3 j ; i.e., that the care\nalternative chosen is the one that maximizes the\nvalue to the family of providing care.\nThe second equation determines the value of\nworking for child j of family i at time t. Assume the\nvalue of working (relative to not working) depends\nupon the lagged value of working, the care responsi-\nbilities of child j , other observed explanatory vari-\nables, and some unobserved variables. As was true\nfor the value of providing care, the value of working\nis not observed; instead, whether child j works is\nobserved.\nThe last equation determines the distance be-\ntween child j and the parent. Assume the distance\ndepends upon lagged distance, the care responsibili-\nties of child j, other observed explanatory variables,\nand other unobserved variables. Again, distance is\nnot observed. Instead, the range that distance falls in\n(where ranges are defined in the note to Table 2) is\nobserved.\nAll three estimation problems are polychotomous\ndiscrete choice estimation problems. The exact\nmethod of estimation depends upon, among other\nthings, the distributions of the errors in each equa-\ntion. For specific assumptions about the error distri-\nbutions, estimation of the care equation requires\nmultinomial logit or multinomial probit; estimation of\nthe work equation requires probit or logit; and esti-\nmation of the distance equation requires ordered\nprobit or ordered logit (Maddala, 1985). For the care\nequation, the number of choices available for each\nfamily varies over families; it is N + 2 when there are N\nchildren. There is no problem caused by having fami-\nlies of different size or children with different charac-\nteristics within a family. For the work equation, the\nnumber of choices is two: work or not. For the dis-\ntance equation, the number of choices is six. For each\nmethod, the objective is to minimize a weighted sum\nof squared residuals where there is one residual for\neach choice available. I assume errors for the care\nequation are extreme value (leading to a multinomial\nlogit type model), and errors in the work and distance\nequation are normally distributed (leading to a probit\nand ordered probit type model, respectively).\nResults, once properly interpreted, are not sensitive\nto error distribution assumptions.\nA problem that must be addressed for all three\nequations is that one of the explanatory variables for\neach equation is the dependent variable for one of\nthe other equations. This causes the explanatory vari-\nables to be endogenous; it is correlated with the error\nin the equation. One must either estimate all three\nequations simultaneously, using a method like full\ninformation maximum likelihood estimation, or esti-\nmate each separately, controlling for the endogeneity\nof some of the explanatory variables. The second\napproach, used in this research, can be implemented\nusing nonlinear instrumental variables estimation.\nTwo steps are involved in using instrumental vari-\nables. The first is to find other variables, called instru-\n78 The Gerontologist\nments, for each equation that are uncorrelated with\nthe error of that equation but are correlated with the\ndependent variable and the explanatory variables. In\nthis particular application, good instruments for 1984\nendogenous explanatory variables are 1982 values of\nthose variables. These instruments have the desired\nproperties as long as only the families where the\nparent lived alone in 1982 are used. If only such\nfamilies are used, then there is no variation in the\ncare provision variable for 1982, and so the explana-\ntory variable cannot be correlated with it. Stern\nand shows empirically which ones are important. In\nparticular, Stern (1995) suggests that there may be\nimportant differences in transitions between the in-\ncluded and excluded data, while Engers and Stern\n(1995), using a different model, suggest that no im-\nportant biases exist. If such bias did exist, it would\nsuggest that care transition probabilities depend\nupon the care alternative being used before the\npotential transition. The second step is to use a\ngeneralization of ordinary least squares using the\ninstruments to estimate the parameters. For this ap-\nplication, the instrumental variables estimation pro-\ncedure provides estimates of the parameters with\ninsignificant asymptotic bias even when there are\nendogenous explanatory variables. The interested\nspecific to this application.\nIt may be that the potentially endogenous explana-\ntory variable in any particular equation is actually\nexogenous (uncorrelated with the error). For exam-\nple, if the value of working for child j does not\ndepend upon her care responsibilities and the errors\nin the care and work equations are independent,\nthen work status in the care equation is actually\nexogenous. One can test whether any of the explana-\ntory variables are endogenous using a test statistic\ndescribed in Hausman (1978). This essentially in-\nvolves measuring the significance of the difference\nbetween coefficient estimates when endogeneity is\ncontrolled for and coefficient estimates when it is not\ncontrolled for.\nEstimation Results\nBefore discussing estimates from particular proce-\ndures, I need to specify what variables belong in each\nequation. The value of living alone depends upon a\nconstant, gender, age, education, marital status,\nrace, six ADL problems, and 21 OFL problems (de-\nfined in Appendix A). The value of living in a nursing\nhome depends upon a constant, gender, age, educa-\ntion, marital status, and race. The value of receiving\ncare from a particular child depends upon the child's\ngender, age, marital status, distance from the parent,\nlabor force participation, labor force participation of\nthe child's spouse, and number of children of the\nchild (grandchildren). There are also dummies for\nwhether the child is either the oldest male or oldest\nfemale child. The motivation for this specification is\nthat the parent tries to remain independent as long as\npossible. Once he or she requires help, possibly\nbecause of an ADL or OFL problem, the characteris-\ntics of the children and the other characteristics of\nthe parent determine whether the parent receives\ncare and from whom.\nResults of the instrumental variables estimation of\nthe care equation are reported in Table 3. The inter-\npretation of a coefficient estimate is the effect of that\nvariable on the value of using a particular care alter-\nnative. For example, the A-FEMALE coefficient esti-\nmate is -.443. This means that the value of living at\nhome is -.443 less for elderly women than it is for\nelderly men. It is assumed that the distribution of\nerrors is extreme value with a standard deviation of\n.345 standard deviations of the error. Similarly, the\ncoefficient on N-BLACK means that the value of living\nin a nursing home is -.476 less for blacks than for\nwhites, and the coefficient on C-DIST = 1 means that\nthe value of being cared for by a child in distance\nvalue of having a child live in the parent's home.\nTable 3. Long-Term Care Coefficient Estimates\nC-DIST = 1\nC-DIST = 2\nC-DIST = 3\nC-DIST = 4\nNote: There are 2,238 observations representing those families\naN-variables are associated with nursing home care. A-variables\nare associated with living alone. C-variables are associated with\nreceiving care from a child. N- and A-variables refer to parent\ncharacteristics, and C-variables refer to child characteristics.\nbNumbers in parentheses are standard errors.\nCC-DIST = 5 actually diverges to - * . Asymptotic standard errors\nfor the other coefficients are conditional on the coefficient value\nfor C-DIST = 5.\nTo save space, no estimates are reported for ADL\nor OFL variables. However, they are jointly signifi-\ncant (the ADL significance level is .01, and the OFL\nsignificance level is <.0001). One can test whether\nthe ADL (or OFL) variables are all of the correct sign\n(negative) using a test statistic described in Kodde\nand Palm (1986). The significance level of the Kodde-\nPalm test statistic for the ADL coefficients is .037, and\nfor the OFL coefficient it is .074, suggesting reason-\nable support for all ADL and OFL variables having the\ncorrect sign.\nMost of the estimates for other variables are con-\nsistent with previous work. In particular, being fe-\nmale, older, single, or white reduces a parent's\nchances of living alone, and being male, married, or\nliving far away reduces a child's chances of providing\ncare. One result worth noting is the negative (though\ninsignificant) coefficient estimates on the oldest\nchild dummies. This directly contradicts common\nbelief but is consistent with Horowitz (1982) and the\nempirical results of Treas, Gronvold, and Bengtson\n(1980). It is also worth noting the small and insignifi-\ncant effects of education on care choices. Since an\nincome measure is missing, one would expect the\neducation variable to capture omitted income ef-\nfects. This suggests that parent income is not a strong\npredictor of care alternatives. Both child income and\nchild education are not available, so I can say nothing\nabout the effect of child income on care alternatives.\nThe key results are that the distance coefficients,\nC-DIST = 1 through C-DIST = 5, are significant and\nconsistent with previous theory, but the work status of\nTable 4.

If one does not\ncontrol for the endogeneity of these explanatory\nvariables, the coefficient on the child work status\nbecomes statistically significant (Stern, 1995, Table 4,\nColumn 1). Thus, it is important to control for the\nendogeneity of explanatory variables if one wants to\ndraw proper causation conclusions. However, the\nHausman test statistic for this equation is insignifi-\ncant. Interpretation of this result is delayed until the\nend of the section.\nTable 4 reports results of the instrumental variables\nestimation of the distance equation. The explanatory\nvariables included in the equation are previous dis-\ntance, care variables, and changes in marital status.\nWith the exception of the threshold variables, C2\nthrough C5, these estimates are the effect of each\nexplanatory variable on the unobserved (possibly\nnonlinear) measure of distance. This unobserved\nmeasure of distance gets translated into the observed\nbracketed distance measures by determining which\nthreshold variables the unobserved measure is be-\ntween. For example, if the unobserved measure is\nThus, for example, the effect on 1984 unobserved\nliving in range 0 in 1982). Given the threshold values,\nCO through C6, this has a large effect on location in\n1984. While previous location and getting married\nhave significant effects (with predicted directions) on\npresent location, becoming the primary caregiver or\ngetting divorced do not have significant effects. Actu-\nally, even if the endogeneity of care is not controlled\nfor, the coefficients on the care variables are insignifi-\ncant. Also, the Hausman test statistic is insignificant.\nTable 5 reports results for work status of the child.\nThese estimates should be interpreted as the effect\nof each explanatory variable on the value of working.\nFor example, providing care reduces the value of\nworking by 1.009.

Results indicate that previous work\nstatus and care provision significantly affect present\nwork status. In some preliminary regressions, other\nvariables such as changes in marital status and mari-\ntal status interacted with work were found to be\ninsignificant. Again, the Hausman test statistic is in-\nsignificant.\nThe results of Tables 3,4, and 5 suggest a hierarchy\nof decisions. First, each child decides where to live.\nSecond, conditional on location but independent of\nchild work status, a care arrangement is determined.\nFinally, the child decides whether to adjust his or her\nwork schedule. The Hausman test statistics are all\ninsignificant, suggesting it is not important to control\nfor endogeneity. However, there is some consensus\nthat Hausman test statistics have low power. Also, in\nthis case, based on Stern (1995), different conclu-\nsions would have been drawn if potential endoge-\nneity had not been controlled for.\nBoaz and Muller (1992) use a continuous measure\nof caregiving hours and a discrete measure of work\nhours conditional on positive caregiving hours. They\nthen use a two-stage least squares estimator to mea-\nsure the effect of work hours and caregiving hours\non each other. They find that work hours have small\neffects on caregiving hours, but caregiving hours\nhave significant effects on reducing work hours from\nfull- to part-time work, and no significant effect on\nreducing part-time hours to no work. Translating\ninto the discrete activity variables of this model im-\nplies that neither activity has a significant effect on\nthe other. Other studies, such as Spitze and Logan\n(1991), find similar results. The results in Boaz and\nMuller (1992) differ from mine because (a) they use a\ncontinuous measure of hours, (b) they control for\nmore caregiver characteristics, (c) they do not con-\ntrol for any characteristics of other potential care-\ngivers, and (d) they do not control for the selection\ncondition of positive caregiving hours.\nA reader unfamiliar with polychotomous discrete,\nordered discrete, and binary discrete parameter esti-\nmates may have a difficult time interpreting the\nresults in Tables 3, 4, and 5. An alternative way to\nreport results shows how choice probabilities\nchange with explanatory variable changes. Table 6\nreports the probabilities of each potential caregiver\nproviding care for a set of representative families.\nThese numbers are based on the coefficient esti-\nmates in Tables 3 and 5. The coefficient on work in\nthe care equation is set to zero. This is done because\n(a) it is insignificant and (b) if it is not zero, then\nHeckman (1978) shows that the model is not logically\nconsistent. The base case consists of a 76-year-old,\nsingle white woman with 9 years of education and no\nADL problems, no OFL problems, and two children\nboth living 31 to 60 minutes away from her. The first\nchild is a 50-year-old married woman with no job, no\nchildren, and a working spouse. The second is a 44-\nyear-old married man with a job, no children, and a\nnonworking spouse. In this family, the parent has an\n88% chance of living alone, a 7% chance of living with\nher daughter, and a 4% chance of living with her son.\nIf the parent were male, he would have a 92% chance\nof living alone. As the parent ages, she is less likely to\nlive alone. If she is married, she has a 97% chance of\nreceiving no care from children. ADL problems re-\nduce her chances of living alone in 5 out of 6 cases.\nAs the daughter moves further away from the parent,\nher chances of caring for the parent change from 34%\n(when living with the parent) to .05% (when living\nmore than 1 day away). There are similar results for\nthe son. Finally, the effect of adding a third child\nqualitatively similar to the son is to reduce all re-\nprobability of child 2 caring for the parent).\nThe second half of Table 6 reports the probability of\neach child working conditional on whether that child\nTable 6.

It is clear that providing care\nhas a large effect on labor force participation.\nSimulation and Policy Experiments\nOver the last generation, there has been a trend\naway from having children of an elderly parent care\nfor the elderly parent to having the elderly parent live\nalone or live in an institution such as a nursing home.\nKotlikoff and Morris (1988) report the following sta-\ntistics: Since 1940, the proportion of unmarried,\nnoninstitutionalized elderly living alone has in-\ncreased from less than 25% to over 60%. For those\nover 85 years old, the proportion has increased from\nthe late 1980s. See, also, Boersch-Supan, Kotlikoff,\ndence on long-term trends. There are significant\nsocial and financial implications associated with this\ntrend. Thus, it is worthwhile to understand how\nfamily decisions are made concerning care for an\nelderly parent.\nOther researchers in this area have suggested\nvarious reasons why care received from children has\ndeclined over the last few decades. For example,\nTreas (1977) argues that declining fertility rates have\naffected care provision and suggests (Treas, 1981)\nthat increasing labor force participation rates of\nwomen have had the same effect. Crimmins and\nIngegneri (1990) attribute the change to child migra-\ntion patterns.\nUsing the parameter estimates in Table 3, one can\nsimulate the effects of various exogenous changes in\nthe environment families live in on care provision\nchoices they make. First, a baseline sample of one\nmillion 1982 families, each with an elderly parent, is\nsimulated. Details of that process are described in\nAppendix B. Characteristics of the sample in 1984 are\npresented in Table 7. Care provision choices are\ngrouped into four categories: living alone with a\nspouse, living alone without a spouse, living in a\nnursing home, and receiving significant care from\nchildren. This sample looks similar to the NLTCS\nsample except that (a) parents have fewer ADLs (be-\ncause having an ADL is a selection condition for the\nNLTCS), and (b) living by oneself or with a spouse is\nmore prevalent (because there are fewer ADLs).\nThe care probabilities presented in Table 7 repre-\nsent 2-year transition probabilities conditional on\nliving alone in the initial period.

The paths followed by this\ncohort over the next 14 years are graphed in Figures 1\nand 2 using the transition probabilities implied by the\nparameter estimates. One can see that, as the cohort\nages, living alone becomes less attractive and living\nwith children or in a nursing home becomes more\nattractive. This is true for both women (Figure 1) and\nmen (Figure 2).\nIn the first experiment, the one-year death proba-\nbilities are cut in half. This is done without changing\nthe joint density of sex, age, race, and marital status\nin 1982. Thus, the change does not reflect the shifting\nof the elderly age distribution toward older ages.\nHowever, it does reflect children living longer. The\neffects of this change on 2-year transition probabili-\nties, presented in Table 8, are to increase the proba-\nThere is also a small increase in children providing\ncare mainly because more children are available. The\nchange in the elderly age distribution, not captured\nhere, can be measured by observing the changes in\ncare provision choices across different age groups.\nIn particular, in Table 7, it is clear that, as parents age,\nthey are more likely to receive care from children,\nlive in nursing homes, and live alone without a\nspouse. These changes occur because older parents\nare less likely to have a spouse and because they are\nmore likely to have ADL and OFL deficiencies. Other\nresearch, such as Rivlin and Wiener (1988), predicts\nsignificant trends in long-term care based only on\nchanging age and implied ADL distribution. How-\no\nNursing Home\nAge\nFigure 1.

This is consistent with results in Marcil-\nThe third and fourth experiment alters the distri-\nbution of distances between the parent and children.\nFirst, I shift the distribution so that, of the 34% of\nchildren living one hour to one day away from the\nparent (C-Dist = 4), 10% move more than one day\naway (C-Dist = 5). This experiment is referred to\nbelow as increasing intermediate distances (IID).\nThis change has very little effect on care provision\nbecause children with C-Dist = 4 were unlikely to\nprovide care anyway. Next, I shift the baseline dis-\ntance distribution so that children living less than 10\nminutes from the parent (C-Dist = 0 or C-Dist = 1)\nmove to intermediate distances (C-Dist = 2 or C-Dist\n= 3). This experiment is referred to below as increas-\ning short distances (ISD). Results are presented in\nTable 10 for the specific change described in the\nNotes. This change makes care provision by children\nless likely but only by small amounts.\nThe long-term effects of the experiments de-\nscribed above on the probability of receiving care by\na child for the cohort of 70-year-old women living\nalone are graphed in Figure 3. The baseline probabil-\nity curve (BL) is identical to the \"Children\" curve in\nFigure 1. Changing death probabilities has a negligi-\nble effect on the cohort.

The analogous curves for\nmen look very similar (not shown). Effects on long-\nterm probabilities of living alone (with and without a\nspouse) are graphed in Figure 4. The only experi-\nments with any nonnegligible effects are reducing\nthe number of children (RC) and increasing short\ndistances (ISD). Reducing the number of children\nincreases the probability of living alone by only\nabout 5% even at age 84. It also increases the proba-\nbility of living in a nursing home by about 1.5%.\nThese are small changes relative to those seen in the\nUnited States over the last few decades.\nIncreasing divorce rates should not explain the\nsecular trend in that the coefficient on C-Marry in\nTable 3 is negative (and insignificant). Increasing\nlabor force participation rates should not explain\nthe trend in that the coefficients on work, C-Work,\nand C-SPWork are insignificant, small, and of oppo-\nsite signs.\nOther possibilities which I have not been able to\nmeasure because of lack of data include income\neffects and changing social norms. In particular, ris-\ning incomes of elderly people may cause them to\nspend resources on maintaining their indepen-\ndence. However, this does not explain why 7% of\nlived in nursing homes in 1988, nor is it consistent\nwith the small coefficients on education variables.\nAnother possibility is changes in Medicaid eligibility\nrules. However, this would not explain movements\nbetween care by children and living alone. Possibly,\nit just has become more socially acceptable for chil-\ndren to not care for their elderly parents.\nConclusions\nOnce endogeneity of explanatory variables is con-\ntrolled for, a relatively clear picture emerges of how\nfamilies make decisions concerning long-term care\nof elderly parents. First, each child decides where to\nlive independent of future long-term care responsi-\nbilities. Next, once the parent requires care, the\nfamily decides how to provide care while taking into\nFigure 4. Experiments for 70-year-old women living alone; living\nalone probabilities.\naccount the location of each family member but\nessentially ignoring work responsibilities of chil-\ndren. Then, the chosen primary caregiver decides\nwhether to reduce work hours, taking into account\nher care responsibilities.\nFour demographic trends have been used to ex-\nplain the increasing incidence of parents living at\nhome: (a) increasing income of elderly people, (b)\ngreater geographic dispersion of families, (c) smaller\nfamily size, and (d) greater labor force participation\nrates of middle-aged women. This study has little to\nsay about the effect of increasing income. It suggests\nthat greater geographic dispersion of families and\nsmaller family sizes have helped increase the inci-\ndence of elderly people living at home but cannot\nexplain the size of the trend. It also suggests that,\nrather than the increasing labor force participation of\nmiddle-aged women increasing the incidence of el-\nderly people living alone, the incidence of elderly\npeople living alone increases the labor force partici-\npation rate of middle-aged women. As care responsi-\nbilities of children have decreased (because of other\nreasons), women and men have been able to work\nmore. Whether one thinks these trends are good or\nbad depends upon one's opinions about work and all\nof the long-term care alternatives available to families.\nReferences\nBoaz, R., & Muller, C. (1992).

OFLs are assumed to be a problem\nfor 1984 nursing home residents. This might cause a bias,\nbut there is no better alternative. No significant differ-\nences occur in other coefficient estimates if the OFL vari-\nables are not included as regressors.\nAppendix B\nSimulation\nThe goal is to simulate a sample of families with an\nelderly parent in 1982 and then let it change stochastically\nover the next two years. First, I construct the joint density\nof the 1982 family characteristics. The joint density of age,\nsex, and race (black or white) comes from U.S. Department\nand 97, inclusive. The density of marital status (married or\nnot) conditional on age, sex, and race for 30 =s age =s 85\ncomes from U.S. Department of Commerce (1992). Data\nare reported for 5-year age intervals and extrapolated for\nlater ages. The joint density of each ADL conditional on\nage, sex, race, and marital status is modeled as a probit\ndepending on a constant, sex, race, marital status, and a\nquadratic polynomial in age. The coefficients of the probit\nindex are estimated using data from the 1979 National\nHealth Interview Survey. The characteristics of these data\nare described in Stern (1989). Each IADL is treated as a\nBernoulli random variable where the Bernoulli probabili-\nties are the sample means in the 1982 data used in this\narticle. While this may appear to be biased, there is no\nalternative source of data to use, and the lADLs are not as\nimportant in explaining behavior as are the ADLs. The\ndensity of education conditional on age, sex, and race\nThe density of number of children conditional on age,\nrace, and marital status is derived by using Series B 42-48\nDepartment of Commerce (1992) data are used to deter-\nmine the probability of an unmarried person having ever\nbeen married. The Department of Commerce (1975) data\nreport the density of number of children conditional on\nhaving ever been married. The numbers are reported as 0\nmore children. The numbers are restricted to be between 0\nand 6, and then they are extrapolated using the informa-\ntion in the table using a quadratic polynomial spline for 0\nto 4 children and a constant splitting rule for 5 and 6\nchildren. The ages of the children are simulated condi-\ntional on number of children n, by drawing n, random\nnumbers between 20 and 35 (the age of the mother at\nbirth), adjusting them so that they are all at least 1.25 years\napart, and then subtracting them from the parent's age in\n1982. As with the lADLs, there is no available data on child\nspacing with enough detail for the relevant years of family\nbuilding. Child sex is modeled as a Bernoulli (.5) random\nvariable. Each child is subjected to a mortality probability\n(from birth until age in 1982) conditional on age, sex, and\nrace data taken from U.S. Department of Health and Hu-\nman Services (1991). The density of working status condi-\ntional on age, sex, and race comes from U.S. Department\nof Labor (1985). The density of distance between the parent\nand each child comes from the 1982 empirical density of\nthat variable from the data used in this article. Again, there\nis no better source. However, it predicts the distribution of\nthe distance of the closest child in 1984 very well using\nCrimmins and Ingegneri (1990), Table 2 as a reference.\nstructed. Sex, race, education, and child distance are\n86 The Gerontologist\nfixed, and age increases by 2. All family members and\nspouses of family members are subjected to 2-year mortal-\nity probabilities conditional on age, sex, and race. It is\nassumed that no divorce occurs. ADL transition probabili-\nties are constructed assuming that having an ADL is an\nabsorbing state and then using the probit coefficients to\nconstruct transition probabilities conditional on age, sex,\nrace, and marital status:\nwhere Pr(t) = probability of having a particular ADL in year\nt. It is assumed that work statuses of children and chil-\ndren's spouses are independent over time.\nOne must make some extra assumptions about some\ntransition probabilities in order to generate the curves in\nFigures 1-4. They are (a) nursing home is an absorbing\nstate while alive (probability of leaving a nursing home is\nzero); (b) Pr[live alone at t + 2|live with child at t] = .05; and\n(c) Pr[live in nursing home at t + 2|live with child at t] = .02.\nThe estimation procedure provides no information about\nthese transition probabilities because they condition on a\ncare arrangement other than living alone.\nThe joint density described above is used to simulate a\npopulation of one million families. Changes in the density\nparameters represent policy experiments. For example, in\nTables 8 and 9, I reduce mortality probabilities by 50% and\nshift the number of children density to the left.\nVideotapes in Spanish and Hmong\nThese videotapes may be used to educate non-English\nspeaking Hispanic or Hmong elderly about the Living\nWill and Power of Attorney for Health Care.
