This advisory outlines 2 issues that all\nusers of NHANES serum 25OHD data need to consider.\nThe purpose of our letter is to discuss the data advisory in relation\nto our recently published article that used NHANES serum 25(OH)D\ndata (1). The first issue outlined in the data advisory is the need to\nadjust the serum 25(OH)D data from NHANES III to make valid\ncomparisons with serum 25(OH)D data collected in NHANES since\n2000. The exploration of this issue was one of the major objectives\nof our study, and the final conclusions about differences between\nlogic difference between surveys. The first issue outlined in the data\nadvisory was fully addressed in our article and therefore does not\naffect our results.\nThe second issue noted in the advisory describes drifts in assay\ncomparability for the serum 25(OH)D data collected since 2000.\nThe effect of these drifts on the population data were not fully recog-\nnized until after the publication of our article and thus was not\naddressed in our analyses. When we became aware of this issue, we\nimmediately conducted an analysis to address its effect on our pub-\nanalyses were repeated after the exclusion of the data of concern, and\nthose results were compared with the results published in the Journal.\nThe results of these analyses are described in detail in the data ad-\nvisory. Briefly, the effect of excluding the data of concern on our pub-\nlished results was minimal. Exclusion of the data of concern resulted\nlower (by 1\u00ad2 nmol/L) and estimates of the prevalence of low serum\n25(OH)D values that were slightly higher (by 1\u00ad2 units) than those\nconclusions were not affected.\nIn summary,the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention(CDC)\nhaspostedadataadvisorywithregardtoserum25(OH)Ddatafromthe\nNHANES that identifies one issue, assay variability since 2000, that is\nrelevanttoourstudy.Ouradditionalanalysesindicateaminimal effect\nofthisissueonourresults.WorkisplannedbytheCDCtoaddressboth\nissues raised in the data advisory by using the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology (NIST) standard reference materials (SRM)\nfor serum 25(OH)D (2). That work will likely take many months to\ncomplete, however, and the CDC did not want to wait before inform-\ning the user community. When the NIST SRM results become avail-\nable, we plan to reevaluate our published results, and we will provide\nan update at that time, if necessary.\nNone of the authors declared a conflict of interest.\nAnne C Looker\nDavid A Lacher\nNational Center for Health Statistics\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\nE-mail: alooker@cdc.gov\nChristine M Pfeiffer\nRosemary L Schleicher\nNational Center for Environmental Health\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\nMary Frances Picciano\nElizabeth A Yetley\nOffice of Dietary Supplements\nNational Institutes of Health\nREFERENCES\n1.
