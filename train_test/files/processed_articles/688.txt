    "abstract": "Abstract: This DataWatch refutes the notion that chronic illness is more prevalent among persons\ncovered by indemnity insurance than by health maintenance organizations (HMOs). This is true even\nwhen health status and sociodemographic factors are accounted for in the analysis. The study analyzes\nthe prevalence ofchronic illness among privately insured nonelderly persons in HMOs and indemnity\nplans, using data from the 1992 National Health Interview Survey. More data are needed to examine\nthis issue for Medicare and Medicaid populations.\nThere is a perception that persons with chronic illness are less likely\nto receive their health care from health maintenance organizations\n(HMOs) than through indemnity plans.1 However, few studies have\nsystematically tested whether this perception is valid. Studies that have done\nso have either used old data or focused exclusively on the elderly. It is\nimportant to quantify the validity of this perception in an environment\nincreasingly dominated by managed care, because its validity has implica-\ntions for how well a health system dominated by managed care can meet the\nneeds of the chronically ill. To explore this issue, we analyzed data from the\n1992 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Our analysis is limited to\nthe privately insured, noninstitutionalized population under age sixty-five.3\nApproximately 68 percent of all persons with chronic conditions, defined\nas persons with a chronic disease, a mobility limitation, or a sensory or\ncognitive limitation, are in this age group.\nThe issue of biased selection is closely related to whether the proportion\nof people with chronic conditions is similar in HMOs and indemnity plans.\nDo chronically ill persons disproportionately elect indemnity plans when\ngiven a choice, fearing that the services in HMOs are inadequate? A\nconsiderable and still evolving literature exists on the subject of biased\nselection. This literature yields contradictory findings at times, in part\nbecause selection bias may exist under some circumstances and not others.4\nThis analysis was not intended to focus on biased selection; however, the\nTeresa Fama is deputy director of The Robert Wood Johnson Foundations National Program\nOffice for Chronic Care Initiatives in HMOs, at the Group Health Foundation in Washington.\nPeter Fox is president of PDF Incorporated and directs the national program office.

The data for this paper come from public use files of\nthe 1992 NHIS, conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics\nholds. Information on type of health insurance coverage and private health\ninsurance characteristics was collected for each person in the household. In\n7,822 cases insurance coverage was unknown or not ascertained; we omit-\nted these cases from the analyses. Because the questionnaire did not ask\nwhether persons age sixty-five and older were enrolled in HMOs, elderly\npersons (15,370 cases) also were excluded. The remainder were known to\nbe covered by private insurance or by government programs (Medicare,\nMedicaid, and the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed\nServices [CHAMPUS]). Anyone who did not report being covered by any\ngovernment program or by any type of private insurance was classified as\nuninsured.\nNCHS staff verified the type of private insurance by comparing the plan\nname and type reported by survey respondents with the plan name and type\nfrom a list compiled by NCHS. We dropped all cases in which the response\nwas not congruent with listed plan types. In many cases, the respondent\nnamed a private plan that was not on the precoded list. These \"unverified\"\nresponses were analyzed only if the type of plan was reported.\nIn many instances persons who were covered by private insurance re-\nported being covered by more than one plan type. If the person was covered\nby two or more plans of the same type (for example, all indemnity or all\nHMO), then we assigned the person to the appropriate category. If, how-\never, the person reported being covered by two different private plan types,\nwe dropped the case. Finally, because the analysis focused on comparisons\nof indemnity and HMO coverage, we dropped cases in which persons were\nenrolled in preferred provider organizations (PPOs).\nThis process of omitting irrelevant cases and nonresponses left us a total\nplans and 19,575 persons by HMOs. The remaining persons either were\ncovered by public insurance or were not insured (Exhibit 1).\nStatistical differences in means and proportions for indemnity plans and\nHMOs were tested using t-tests. Multivariate regression analysis also was\nperformed to examine the relative likelihood of a person's being enrolled in\nan HMO compared with being in an indemnity plan.\nStudy Results\nDemographic characteristics.

Information on all nonelderly persons in the sample\n(that is, those in indemnity plans; HMOs; PPOs; a combination of indem-\nnity plans, HMOs, or PPOs; Medicare; Medicaid; other public programs;\nand CHAMPUS; and those who are uninsured) is included as a reference.\nThe major finding is the lack of substantive differences in most of the\ndemographic characteristics of indemnity plan members and HMO mem-\nbers. Among these two groups, the only substantive differences are in the\npercentage of nonwhite members and in the percentage of members who\nlive in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA). In particular, 17.6 percent of\nHMO enrollees are nonwhite, compared with 10.2 percent of persons in\nindemnity plans. With respect to geographic location, 91.3 percent of\nHMO enrollees live in MSAs, compared with 743 percent of persons in\nindemnity plans. This is not surprising, given that HMOs are typically\nlocated in densely populated areas, for a variety of reasons.5\nThere are statistically significant differences (at the .05 level) in the\nmeans or proportions of some of the other variables. For example, HMO\nenrollees come from slightly larger families and are slightly younger than\npersons covered by indemnity plans.\nPrevalence of chronic conditions. The NHIS includes questions per-\ntaining to a wide range of conditions that are classified as \"chronic.\" Exhibit\n2 includes only those conditions that are likely to be associated with a\nlong-term functional impairment, such as arthritis or diabetes. We ex-\ncluded conditions such as trouble with dry skin, chronic sinusitis, and\nfrequent indigestion that rarely meet this definition. Thus, we compared\nthe prevalence of fifteen chronic conditions among persons in HMOs and\npersons in indemnity plans, controlling for age.\nAgain, the most striking finding is how little HMOs and indemnity plans\ndiffer in the prevalence of chronic conditions. The most substantive differ-\nences pertained to arthritis, selected respiratory conditions, hearing impair-\nments, and orthopedic impairments or deformities. The differences that do\nexist are in both directions, and only the difference in the prevalence of\nhearing impairments is statistically significant. Arthritis is less prevalent\namong persons under age forty-five who are enrolled in HMOs compared\nwith those in indemnity plans. Among all age groups, hearing impairments\nare much less prevalent in HMOs than in indemnity plans. The prevalence\nof orthopedic impairments or deformities among persons under age forty-\nfive in HMOs is greater than in indemnity plans, but the opposite is true for\npersons ages forty-five to sixty-four. Among selected respiratory conditions,\nfindings are mixed. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are less prevalent\nin HMOs among all age groups, except among persons ages forty-five to\nsixty-four in the case of chronic bronchitis. Asthma is more prevalent\namong all age groups in HMOs compared with indemnity plans.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The two latter measures have been shown to be predictive of\nimportant health changes (that is, major or minor hospitalization, major\nillness) between baseline and one year later among healthy older adults.6\nThe percentage of persons with any activity limitation is slightly higher\nin indemnity plans than in HMOs (Exhibit 3). Irrespective of age, HMO\nenrollees are less likely than persons in indemnity plans to have a limitation\nin a major activity. However, HMO enrollees under age eighteen are more\nlikely than children in indemnity plans to have a limitation in a major\nactivity and to be unable to perform a major activity.\nThe distribution of bed days, regardless of age, is similar.

The variables pertaining to\nthe presence of an activity limitation or specific chronic conditions or the\nnumber of chronic conditions are not significant.\nDiscussion\nThis analysis refutes the notion that chronic illness is more prevalent\namong nonelderly persons covered by indemnity insurance than among\nthose covered by HMOs. Although some differences were identified, the\ncentral finding relates to the similarities. Furthermore, where differences do\nexist, they occur in both directions; that is, HMOs have proportionately\nfewer persons with chronic illness than indemnity plans have when some\nmeasures are used, and have more such persons when other measures are\nused.\nOur study was not motivated by the desire to determine the existence of\nbiased selection, but it does shed some light on this complex issue. If HMOs\ndo benefit from favorable selection, we believe that the bias is minimal\noverall, although in some situations it could be significant--to either the\nadvantage or the disadvantage of the HMO. One could also conclude that\nHMOs have been no more successful than indemnity plans have been at\nrisk selection. Unfortunately, the NHIS data do not allow us to identify risk\ndifferences among persons with a choice of plans.\nThese findings pertain only to the privately insured nonelderly popula-\ntion. Additional current data are needed to examine whether persons with\nchronic conditions who are covered by Medicare or Medicaid are more or\nless likely to join HMOs. A study funded by the Health Care Financing\nAdministration (HCFA) that compared Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs\nwith those in traditional fee-for-service plans found that HMO enrollees\nwere more likely to be healthy.8 However, since that study there has been a\ndramatic increase in Medicare HMO enrollment. In particular, enrollment\nin Medicare full risk-based HMOs increased by almost one million between\nWith respect to Medicaid enrollment in HMOs, most states have ex-\nempted persons with severe disabilities from managed care arrangements,\nand some states are just beginning to experiment with methods (most of\nwhich pertain to setting payment rates) for including such persons.10 It is\nnot known, however, whether Medicaid eligibles who have chronic condi-\ntions but are not severely disabled are more or less likely to join HMOs.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

In 1994 alone\nthree million Medicaid eligibles were enrolled in prepaid health systems, an\nincrease of about 60 percent over the previous year.11 It is important to\nenhance our understanding of how best to serve people with chronic\nconditions and other populations in a managed care environment and to\ndemonstrate how capitation might offer opportunities for innovation in\nservice delivery and care coordination.\nAlthough this study was funded by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, it does not necessarily\nreflect the foundation's views.
