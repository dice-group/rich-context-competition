A non-parametric equation derived from a probabilistic Baye-\nsian network (BN) was established by including sex, age, body weight and height.

A French DXA database (n 1140) was used (1) to adjust the model parameters\n(n 380) and (2) to cross-validate the model responses (n 760). French subjects were significantly different from American NHANES subjects\nwith respect to age, weight and FM. Despite this different population context, BN prediction was highly reliable. Correlations between BN\npredictions and DXA measurements were significant for FFM (R 2 0\u00b794, P,0\u00b7001, standard error of prediction (SEP) 2\u00b782 kg) and the per-\ncentage of FM (FM%) (R 2 0\u00b781, P,0\u00b7001, SEP 3\u00b773 %). Two previously published linear models were applied to the subjects of the French\ndatabase and compared with BN predictions. BN predictions were more accurate for both FFM and FM than those obtained from linear\nmodels. In addition, BN prediction generated stochastic variability in the FM% expressed in terms of BMI. The use of such predictions\nin large populations could be of interest for many public health issues.\n",

Due to the accumulation\nof excess fat tissue, the worldwide increase in the preva-\nlence of obesity contributes to a high risk of metabolic\ndisorders such as CVD and type 2 diabetes(3). In addition,\nFFM loss in ageing populations and its progression towards\nsarcopenia increase morbidity and mortality(4 \u00ad6). Accurate\nmeasurements of body composition can be obtained from\nreference methods, such as underwater weighing, dilution\ntechniques and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).\nAlthough the use of such methods is widespread, their\napplication is time consuming and expensive, and as a\nresult, they are not relevant for use as a part of routine\nclinical examinations or population studies. Bioelectrical\nimpedance has often been considered to be a convenient\ntool for body composition analysis. However, the recorded\nbioelectrical values (resistance and reactance) must be\nused in equations that are body shape specific, and accu-\nrate FFM and FM assessments require adjustments with a\nIn contrast, simple anthropological measurements, such\nas body weight or BMI, cannot give a reliable quantifi-\ncation of body composition, although they are of predic-\ntive interest at a population level(3,11\u00ad 13).

Because increa-\nsingly more information on body composition analysis is\navailable, either directly from large surveys (e.g. National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey; NHANES) or\nindirectly through scientific publications, we investigated\nthe potential of a non-parametric model derived from\na Bayesian network (BN) to predict body composition.\nA BN provides a global joint probability distribution over\na set of random variables(14,15).

The\npresent study aims to present this new calculation concept\nand to validate BN predictions for FFM and FM against\nDXA measurements obtained from an independent\nsample of French subjects.

Subjects were characterised from the\ncovariables (sex, age, height and weight) included in the\nmodel irrespective of ethnicity (Table 1).\nFor the current purpose, only subjects having a valid\nscan were included, and the mean value of five DXA\nmeasurements (Hologic QDR-4500) was considered. Lean\nmass values were increased by 5 % to overcome the initial\nreduction imposed on the entire NHANES database, as\nexplained in the user guide (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/\nnhanes/dxx/dxa.htm)(23).\nIndependent body composition database for model fitting\nand validation\nhad their body composition measured by DXA (Hologic\nQDR-4500) during routine examination at the Radiology\nDepartment of the Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital\nthis database, two different subsets were defined to adjust\nparameters for FFM estimates (CHU-fit: 380 subjects), and\nthe second was used to cross-validate model responses\n(CHU-valid: 760 subjects) (Table 1). Subsets were matched\nfor sex and BMI distributions.\nFat-free mass adjustments\nFor each subject in the CHU-fit database, a subset of candi-\ndates was selected in the NHANES database using a BN\nequation, which included the age, body weight and\nheight of the subject to predict.\nA distance was computed from the covariables using the\nfollowing formula:\nD \u00bc\nmax wa\nda\n; wh\ndh\n; ww\ndw\nwa\n\u00fe wh\n\u00fe ww\n;\nwhere da\n, dh\n, dw\nare the absolute values of the difference\nfor age, height and weight, respectively, between the\nCHU subject to predict and the NHANES subjects of similar\nsex, and wa\n, wh\n, ww\nare associated weighting parameters\nfor age, height and weight, respectively.

A candidate could be selected outside these\nlimits when his/her covariables gave a distance below Dm\n.\nComparisons with other predictive models\nPredictions of the percentage of body fat (FM%) on CHU\nsubjects were compared when obtained with either BN\nor multiple regression models.

These\nequations were developed to predict FM%. Using a two-\ncompartment model, they were applied to body weight\nto deduce FM and, consequently, FFM.\nStatistical computations and analyses. Underlying cal-\nculations were processed using the Rebastaba package(24)\nwritten in R (R Development Core Team, 2009), a language\nand environment for statistical computing (R Foundation\n07-0, URL http://www.R-project.org), which is available\nat http:/r-forge.r-project.org/projects/riskassessments/\nThe quality of prediction was globally assessed on both\nCHU-fit and CHU-valid databases by the SEP, which is\ndefined as follows:\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nP\n\u00f0FFMmeasured\n2 FFMpredicted\nn\ns\n;\nwhere n is the number of subjects in the corresponding\ndatabase.\nDifferences between population characteristics were\nanalysed with Student's t test (XLstat 2008). Correlations\nbetween variables were calculated with Pearson's formula.\nResults\nModel parameter adjustments\nThe NHANES and CHU (fit and valid) subjects were signifi-\ncantly different for all variables (P,0\u00b7001) with the excep-\ntion of height (except for CHU-valid, where women were\ntaller than those in the other groups). The NHANES sub-\njects had greater body weight, BMI and FM than the\nFrench subjects. The CHU subjects had a slightly but sig-\nnificantly higher FFM (not significant for CHU-fit women)\nthan the NHANES subjects. CHU-valid women had higher\nFFM values than the other female groups (Table 1). There-\nfore, BN prediction was analysed for subjects very distinct\nfrom the NHANES population.\nNumerous combinations of weighting coefficients and\nDm\nwere first considered. Among them, 125 effective com-\nbinations were scrutinised for the SEP and rate of predic-\ntion for the subjects belonging to the CHU-fit database.\nAs expected, there were interactions between the SEP\nand the rate of prediction. The SEP decreased with Dm\nuntil a minimum corresponding to the optimal fit between\nFFM predictions and DXA measurements, and then\nincreased again with larger Dm\nvalues (Fig. 1(a)). Decrea-\nsing Dm\nled to an increase in the number of empty predic-\ntive subsets and consequently worsened the prediction\nrate. Reaching a predictive rate of 100 % was possible but\nreduced the quality of fit (SEP approximately 3 kg;\nFig. 1(b)). The retained combination provided a compro-\nmise between the two criteria, with an SEP of 2\u00b784 kg\nand a prediction rate of 99\u00b721 %.

No difference\nwas observed for variables from men from the two data-\nbases. However, CHU-valid women were slightly taller\nand had higher FFM values than CHU-fit women. The cov-\nariables (age, height and weight) of the NHANES subjects\nselected as predictors were similar to those of the CHU\nsubjects, and no difference was observed between the\ngroups (Table 2).\nThe FFM, FM and FM% values of the predictors were\nplotted against their respective experimental DXA counter-\nparts (Fig. 2). Accuracy of BN prediction was compared\nwith the two linear models, equations 1 and 2. The quality\nof fit was excellent in women for FFM (SEP 2\u00b771 kg, R 2\n0\u00b786) and was superior to those obtained with equation 1\nR 2 0\u00b783). Similar trends were found for males; however,\ndiscrepancies between the three models were less pro-\nnounced for males than for females. All correlations were\nhighly significant (Table 3). Because FM was deduced\nfrom FFM, the SEP was equivalent for FFM and FM.\nCorrelations were still highly significant for FM%, although\npredictions were less closely fit to their experimental\ncounterparts, and the SEP remained lower for BN predic-\ntion than those obtained with linear models.\nWhen FM% was expressed in terms of BMI, a large inter-\nindividual variability was observed with experimental\nmeasurements for both males and females. This variability\nwas better described by the BN predictions than with other\nmodels (Fig. 3). The variability observed with equation 2\nwas introduced by the age effect, which was not sufficient\nby itself to describe the inter-individual variability. In con-\ntrast, the well-known sex difference in FM% in terms of\nBMI was well described by the three predictive models.\nDiscussion\nThe main objective of the present study was to investigate\nthe potential use of a non-parametric equation derived\nfrom a BN to assess body composition with easily accessible\ncovariables. BN are particularly useful in predicting events\nin a population when only part of the information is avail-\nable or eventually provided as aggregated information.\nHowever, in the present study, BN prediction was validated\nin a context where all the covariables needed for prediction\nwere known. It was shown that the BN enabled the precise\nprediction of the FFM of the French subjects (CHU) from\nbody composition values recorded in the US population\n(NHANES). The first requirement in developing such a\nmodel was to have a validated database of body compo-\nsition measurements. DXA is one of the gold standard\nmethods for assessing body composition(25). The NHANES\ndatabase, to our knowledge, is the largest database of\nDXA body composition measurements available for down-\nloading. It offers a good reliability, with five replicates per\nsubject recorded under validated procedures.

We were particularly interested in describing a French\nEuropean population. Therefore, we used a French dataset\nto adjust the parameters of the BN equation. However, the\nequation could have been adjusted or applied to any\nother population. It is interesting to note that the NHANES\ndatabase could be used to describe the body composition\nof a population of interest that differed in many aspects\n(age, weight and BMI). To predict the body composition\nof a subject, the BN equation returned an adjusted subset\nof candidates from which the one having the median FFM\nvalue was the predictor. His/her FFM value was attributed\nto the subject to predict, and FM was directly deduced as\nthe body weight minus FFM. It would have been possible\nto do similar adjustments from any body compartment\n(fat, lean or bone mass). However, FFM was the most\nimportant body compartment, and the one most closely\nadjusted to the BN covariables(18\u00ad20). FM was then con-\nsidered to be the adjusting variable. Bone mineral content\nrepresents the smallest compartment (about 3\u00b75 % of\nweight). It was not considered to be a specific compartment\nbut was included in FFM.\nThe potential outcomes associated with a reliable predic-\ntive model for body composition have been highlighted(1),\nand many attempts to describe body composition, particu-\nlarly body fat, using linear models with simple variables\nhave been proposed. They usually included BMI, and\noccasionally, age or ethnicity(20,25,26). It was thus interes-\nting to compare the fit obtained with BN prediction and\nwith linear predictive models when applied to the same\npopulation. Two robust and clearly described equations\nwere used for comparison. Equation 1(22) included a quad-\nratic form of BMI that was irrespective of age, while\nequation 2(11) included BMI, age and ethnicity, both with\nsex specificities. When applied to the CHU-valid subjects,\nthe quality of FM% adjustments was very similar to those\nobtained in the original population context(11,22). For\nequation 2, the quality of fit varied from R 2 0\u00b781, with\nSEP 4\u00b701 %, for the CHU-valid subjects. For equation 1,\nwhen stratified by sex, the quality of fit varied from\nfor CHU-valid males. The similarity of fit obtained with\nthese two models in different populations confirms their\nrobustness. For both body compartments (FFM and FM),\nBN prediction resulted in a better fit than linear models,\nespecially for FFM, which was the adjusted compartment.\nIt is noteworthy that BN prediction was obtained without\nconsidering ethnicity.

Although the French population to predict\n(CHU) was mostly Caucasian, the best fit was obtained\nwhen the entire database was used (SEP 2\u00b784 kg) rather\nthan limited to white, non-Hispanic subjects (SEP\n3\u00b711 kg). The influence of ethnicity was, therefore, not\nincluded in the final model adjustment.\nSex differences observed in the relationships between\nBMI and FM% were similar to those previously\ndescribed(21,31). In contrast to other predictive linear\nmodels, BN prediction provided a stochastic picture of\ninter-individual variability, as illustrated by the relationship\nbetween BMI and FM% and could be useful to depict bio-\nlogical variability in any population of interest.\nThe BN equation is not a ready-to-use tool for straight\napplication; instead, it should be considered as a new\nconcept in the field of body composition assessments\nthat can be improved in further releases. The applicability\nand accuracy of model predictions directly depend on the\nquality and quantity of the available information in the\nNHANES database. The predictive subset size varied from\nzero to fifty subjects. An empty subset meant that it was\nnot possible to find a candidate in NHANES having the\nrequested age, height and weight within the constraints\nimposed by the BN equation This prediction failure was\nrather low, and only four subjects out of 760 were not pre-\ndicted. When the subset size equalled one, the FFM predic-\ntion was deduced from a single candidate with a higher\nrisk of poor adjustment. These types of situations were\nmore frequently found for extreme anthropometric\nvalues. Of the five predicted subjects with a subset of\none (all female), two were taller than 180 cm, and two\nwere shorter than 148 cm. Excluding subjects predicted\nfrom only one candidate, the quality of fit was slightly\ntrast, a NHANES subject can be selected as a predictor for\ndifferent CHU-valid subjects (six NHANES subjects were\nselected three times; sixty-seven were selected twice and\n604 were involved in a single prediction). The number of\nreplicates of a predictor depended on the covariable distri-\nbution of the population to predict. Retaining different\nmodel limits to avoid rare anthropometric situations\ncould be a possible way to improve the model.\nThe quality of FFM predictions obtained with the BN\nmodel were similar to those obtained with bioelectrical\nimpedance equations, where SEP varied from 2 to 3\u00b76kg(32),\nBMI (kg/m2)\nBMI (kg/m2)\nBMI (kg/m2)\nBMI (kg/m2)\nFM% predicted from CHU-valid\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFM% measured on CHU-valid\nFM% predicted from CHU-valid\nFM% predicted from CHU-valid\nFig. 3.
