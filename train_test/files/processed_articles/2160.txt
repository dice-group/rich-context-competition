    "abstract": "Abstract\nOnly a handful of public health studies have investigated expectations of early death among adolescents. Associations have\nbeen found between these expectations and risk behaviors in adolescence. However, these beliefs may not only predict\nworse adolescent outcomes, but worse trajectories in health with ties to negative outcomes that endure into young\nadulthood. The objectives of this study were to investigate perceived chances of living to age 35 (Perceived Survival\nExpectations, PSE) as a predictor of suicidal ideation, suicide attempt and substance use in young adulthood. We examined\nthe predictive capacity of PSE on future suicidal ideation/attempt after accounting for sociodemographics, depressive\nsymptoms, and history of suicide among family and friends to more fully assess its unique contribution to suicide risk. We\ninvestigated the influence of PSE on legal and illegal substance use and varying levels of substance use. We utilized the\nNational Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) initiated in 1994\u00ad95 among 20,745 adolescents in grades 7\u00ad\nwere almost certain of living to age 35, perceiving a 50\u00ad50 or less chance of living to age 35 at Waves I or III predicted\nsuicide attempt and ideation as well as regular substance use (i.e., exceeding daily limits for moderate drinking; smoking $\na pack/day; and using illicit substances other than marijuana at least weekly) at Wave IV. Associations between PSE and\ndetrimental adult outcomes were particularly strong for those reporting persistently low PSE at both Waves I and III. Low\nPSE at Wave I or Wave III was also related to a doubling and tripling, respectively, of death rates in young adulthood. Long-\nterm and wide-ranging ties between PSE and detrimental outcomes suggest these expectations may contribute to\nidentifying at-risk youth.\nCitation: Nguyen QC, Villaveces A, Marshall SW, Hussey JM, Halpern CT, et al.

Howev-\ner, fatalism and perceived vulnerability may also encourage\ngreater recklessness. Cross-sectional studies linked adolescent\nexpectations of early death to risk behaviors like suicide\nideation/act, impulsive sensation-seeking, drinking and driving,\nand selling drugs [2,3]. Studies utilizing data from the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) identified\nlow perceived chances of living to age 35 (which we term\nPerceived Survival Expectations, PSE) as a predictor of future\nsuicide attempt, fight-related injury, unsafe sexual activity, police\narrest, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosis [4]\u00adand\nmost recently to cigarette smoking [5]. The importance of low PSE\nis underscored by their prevalence among youth. One in seven\nadolescents at Wave I of Add Health reported perceiving a 50\u00ad50\nchance or less of living to age 35 [4].\nLow PSE may reflect an overall tendency to view the future\npessimistically, fatalistically and with resignation. Hopelessness has\nbeen linked with violence involvement, substance use and early\nsexual activity among adolescents [6]. As described above,\nanalogous associations have been found for low PSE [4].\nHopelessness may impair an individual's abilities to define\nproblems and to formulate and implement their solutions [7].\nRecently, low PSE were linked to avoidance of problems and\nacting without considering consequences [8]. Essential compo-\nnents of hopelessness include the expectation that desired events\nwill not occur, negative events will occur, and nothing can be done\nto change the course of these events. Beck's original 20-item true/\nfalse hopelessness scale was composed of items such as ``My future\nseems dark to me,'' and ``I might as well give up because I can't\nmake things better for myself'' [9]. There are current movements\nto incorporate considerations of survival expectations more\ndirectly into hopelessness theory. For instance, Bolland added\nthe following item to his hopelessness scale: ``I don't expect to live\na very long life'' [6].\nSuicide and Substance Use among Young Adults\nAmong those 25\u00ad34 years old, suicide represents the second\nthird of suicide attempts result in injuries that require medical\nattention [11]. Suicidal behavior among youths is strongly related\nto psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder,\nantisocial behaviors, and substance use disorder [12]. Hopelessness\nis also tied to suicidal behavior [13,14]. Other key risk factors for\nsuicide include family history of suicide and psychopathology,\nstressful life events such as child abuse, violence exposure, and\nsocial/economic disadvantage [12,15]. Structural factors related to\nsuicide include neighborhood poverty/economic deprivation [16].\nProtective factors include family cohesion (i.e., mutual involve-\nment, shared interests, emotional support) and religiosity [17].\nSuicide deaths are more prevalent among men but women\nattempt suicide more often [18].\nAdditionally, substance use has substantial health costs.\nCigarette smoking is the largest individual cause of preventable\ndeaths and morbidity across the world [19]. Alcohol accounts for\napproximately 3% of global deaths and 4% of disability-adjusted\nlife years (DALYs) [20]. Illicit substance use is connected with\nexcess mortality, fatal and non-fatal injuries, motor-vehicle\naccidents, violence and psychiatric disorders [7]. Substance use\npeaks in young adulthood, reaching 72% by age 27. Daily\ndrinking, binge drinking and daily drunkenness are at their\nmaxima in young adulthood [21].\nIdentified risk factors for substance use are extensive and\ninclude regulations and norms favorable to drug use, availability of\ndrugs, severe economic deprivation, psychiatric disorders, family\nhistory of substance use, family conflict, low family attachment,\nlow school commitment, early peer rejection, social pressure,\nalienation and rebelliousness [22]. Men have higher rates of\nsubstance use and problem use than women [23,24]. Personality\ntraits hypothesized to be associated with substance use include\nhopelessness, impulsivity, anxiety sensitivity, and sensation-seeking\nPSE as a Predictor of Young Adult Risk Behaviors\nPreviously, low PSE has been connected to a variety of adverse\nhealth outcomes including fight-related injury, diagnosis of HIV/\nAIDS, and police arrests [4]. In this study, we investigate\nexpectations of an early death as a predictor of young adult\nsuicidal behavior and substance use\u00adtwo categories of risk\nbehaviors that exert large health burdens on this age group. We\nhypothesize that PSE increases the likelihood of both types of\nbehaviors. People who perceive a severely bleak or limited future\nmay respond to challenges with fatalism and less persistence. They\nmay set fewer goals, seek less guidance, and develop or attempt\nfewer solutions to their problems [25]. Low PSE in adolescence\nmay increase the risk for suicide later in life through the\ndevelopment of cognitive schemas in which negative events are\nseen as inevitable and desired events are seen as unattainable.\nIndividuals with low PSE may be more apt to believe that their\nproblems are insoluble and to view suicide as the only recourse. It\nis also important to assess whether such associations persist even\nafter accounting for depressive symptoms, religiosity, and history\nof suicide among family and friends along with other potentially\nconfounding factors. Additionally, perceptions of a bleak future\nmay encourage substance use by promoting a disregard of future\nconsequences or encourage substance use as a means to cope.\nPeople who perceive poor life chances may act more recklessly\nRecently, McDade et al. using Add Health data connected\nlower PSE to higher daily number of cigarettes among current\nsmokers [5]. Another Add Health study found that adolescents\nwho reported low PSE at Waves I and II were more likely to\nreport past-year illicit substance use compared to those who had\nhigh PSE at both waves, although effect measures bordered\nstatistical significance [8]. A third study found Wave I PSE was\nunrelated to past-year illicit substance use at Waves II and III [4].\nNonetheless, marijuana, the most common illicit substance, was\nnot distinguished from other illicit drugs. Approximately three-\nquarters of illicit drug users report marijuana use [26]. The health\neffects of marijuana are also generally more benign than those of\nother illicit drugs [27]. In addition, these studies did not examine\nvarying levels of use and they did not investigate alcohol use.\nPrevious studies have only examined past-year illicit substance use.\nStudy Aims and Hypotheses\nThe aim of this study was to examine associations between PSE\nand future suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and substance use in\nyoung adulthood after accounting for important confounding\nfactors that relate to low PSE and to the detrimental outcomes\nunder investigation. This study utilized data from Add Health to\ntest two hypotheses:\n1. Low PSE at Waves I and III will be associated with increased\nsuicidal ideation and suicide attempt at Wave IV.\n2. Low PSE at Waves I and III will be associated with increased\ncigarette smoking, alcohol use, marijuana use and other illicit\nsubstance use at Wave IV.\nThe efficiency of PSE cannot be over emphasized. PSE was\nassessed with one survey question pertaining to respondents'\nperceived chances of living to age 35, and Wave I occurred 13\u00ad14\nyears prior to Wave IV. If PSE is predictive of detrimental\noutcomes at Wave IV even after adjusting for important individual\nand contextual confounding factors, it merits consideration as\na tool to identify at-risk youth.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nThis study utilized data from Add Health, a nationally\nrepresentative field study of 20,745 U.S. adolescents in grades 7\nresponse rate was 79% (mean age 16) [28]. Three in-home follow-\nup interviews of the cohort have been completed: Wave II in 1996\n(88% of the eligible cohort at Wave I; mean age 16), Wave III in\nmean age 28). By design, high school seniors at Wave I were not\nre-interviewed at Wave II, but were included in Waves III and IV.\ninterviewed. The analytic sample was restricted to respondents\nwith non-missing survey weights (N = 14,800 with Wave IV cross-\nsectional weights and N = 12,288 with valid longitudinal weights\nfor analyses that use data from Waves I, III, IV).\nVariable Coding/definitions\nVariable definitions can be found in the Supplemental Materials\n(Table S1). The main predictor of interest is Perceived Survival\nExpectations (PSE). Respondents were asked at Waves I, II and III,\n``What are your chances of living to age 35?'' Possible responses\nwere: ``almost no chance;'' ``some chance, but probably not;'' ``a\nEarly Death Expectations and Adult Outcomes\n50\u00ad50 chance;'' ``a good chance'' and ``almost certain.'' Consistent\nwith previous literature, we collapsed PSE equals ``50\u00ad50 chance''\nwith lower categories [4]. We also assessed whether more\nmoderate departures from certainty of living to age 35 (i.e.,\nreporting ``a good chance'') were also related to adverse outcomes.\nWave IV outcomes. Outcomes under examination included\nsuicidal ideation and attempt as well as substance use at Wave IV.\nBoth suicidal ideation (assessed via the question, ``During the past 12\nmonths, have you ever seriously thought about committing\nsuicide?'') and suicide attempt (assessed via the question, ``During\nthe past 12 months, how many times have you actually attempted\nsuicide?'') were coded dichotomously due to low prevalences of\nboth behaviors. All respondents were asked about the number of\nsuicide attempts regardless of their response to the question on\nsuicidal ideation. To investigate whether PSE is differentially\nrelated to divergent levels of substance use, we coded substance use\nwith a series of polytomous variables\u00adwith the exception of\nexceeding recommended daily limits for moderate drinking which was\ndefined as two or more drinks per day for women and three or\nmore drinks per day for men [29]. Cigarette smoking had the\nfollowing levels: A) none, B) less than daily smoking, C) daily\nsmoking but less than a pack a day, and D) at least a pack a day\n[30]. Binge drinking was defined as 5/4 [men/women] or more\ndrinks in a row [31]. We also investigated marijuana use and use of\nillicit substances other than marijuana. Frequency of the latter three\noutcomes was examined with the following levels: none, monthly\nor less, 2\u00ad3 days/month, at least weekly. This study contributes to\nthe literature by exploring PSE as a predictor of a variety of\nsubstance use behaviors (i.e., cigarette smoking, binge drinking,\nheavy daily drinking, marijuana use, and other illicit substance\nuse)\u00adand at varying levels of use from occasional to regular use.\nCovariates. The primary aim of this study is to study is to\nassess PSE as a predictor of suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt, and\nsubstance use in young adulthood, independent of important\nconfounding factors. The following covariates were selected\na priori based upon the literature demonstrating their relationship\nto lower PSE and greater engagement in risk behaviors [4,5,8,32]:\nage (years), sex, foreign-birth, race/ethnicity, parental education,\nfamily structure, childhood physical maltreatment, childhood\nsexual abuse, 12-month family history of suicide, 12-month\nhistory of suicide among friends, substance use, self-rated health,\nreligiosity, depressive symptoms and parental attachment/support\n(Table S1). Indices were constructed for depressive symptoms,\nreligiosity and parental attachment/support. For each index,\nscores were calculated by averaging across items composing the\nindex. We required valid responses for two-thirds of questions\ncomposing the indices. Internal consistency of items composing\nthe indices was satisfactory with Cronbach's alphas approximately\n0.70 or greater. For all variables, higher values indicate greater\nrisk.\nStatistical Analyses\nWe first calculated prevalence estimates and 95% confidence\nintervals for PSE, all covariates, and Wave IV outcomes. We then\nevaluated associations between PSE and Wave IV outcomes. In\nassessing PSE as a marker of negative health outcomes, we\nexamined both the predictive capacities of PSE measured at Wave\nI when respondents were in grades 7\u00ad12th and PSE measured at\nWave III when respondents were 18\u00ad26 years old. Adults have\nmore developed risk perceptions compared to adolescents who\noverestimate the probability of negative events [33]. Thus, low\nPSE at Wave III may be less subject to crude risk perceptions\n(compared to Wave I PSE) and may signal severe levels of\nhopelessness. We also examined the outcomes of respondents who\nreported persistently low PSE at Waves I and III in order to assess\nwhether this group is particularly vulnerable to detrimental\noutcomes in young adulthood.\nWe investigated the potential effects of Wave I PSE on Wave IV\nsuicidal ideation and attempt (Study Aim 1) using log-binomial\nregression models to calculate relative risks and including all\naforementioned covariates. We investigated the relationship\nbetween Wave III PSE and Wave IV suicidal behavior controlling\nfor the full set of covariates with Wave III values where available\n(i.e., family history of suicide, history of suicide among friends,\nblock group poverty, depressive symptoms, religiosity, parental\nattachment/support, substance use and self-rated health).\nSecondly, we investigated the potential impact of Wave I and\nWave III PSE on Wave IV substance use (Study Aim 2). For the\ndichotomous outcome variable (i.e., exceeding daily limits for\nmoderate drinking), we utilized log-binomial regression models to\nestimate relative risks. For polytomous outcome variables, we\nutilized multinomial logistic regression because the Brant test\nshowed violations of the proportional odds assumption [34].\nModels controlled for all-above specified covariates that were\nincluded in models evaluating the relationship between PSE and\nsuicide with the exception of self-reported history of suicide among\nfamily and friends\u00adwhich had negligible impact on effect sizes but\nwould have reduced the analytic sample size (results not shown). In\norder to investigate whether PSE has an enduring effect on\nsubstance use in young adulthood beyond its effects on adolescent\nsubstance use [4], we controlled for previous substance use and\ncompared with effect estimates without this adjustment.\nWe tested the statistical significance of sex-by-PSE interactions\nin order to evaluate whether the effects of PSE differed for males\nand females. Across all examined outcomes, these interactions\nwere non-significant at the 0.05 level, and thus not included in\nfinal models. Among respondents with valid survey weights,\nmissing data for PSE and all Wave IV outcomes was ,1%.\nMissing data for covariates were also low (generally ,2%). Wave\nIII parental attachment/support had the highest rate of missing-\nness (5%). The exclusion of individuals with missing data on PSE,\nWave IV outcomes, and covariates resulted in the exclusion of 6\u00ad\n13% of respondents. All summary statistics were produced using\nSTATAH/SE 10 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) and\nweighted to be representative of U.S. adolescents in grades 7\u00ad12\nEthics\nThis analysis was exempt from further review by the Public\nHealth-Nursing IRB at the University of North Carolina at\nChapel Hill.\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics\nreported low PSE (i.e., #50% chance of living to age 35) (Table 1).\nHowever at Wave III, when all respondents were 18 years and\nolder, the proportion reporting low PSE reduced to 7% (95% CI:\nreported low PSE At Wave I and III (results not shown). At Wave\nI, the Add Health population was approximately balanced\nbetween males and females. Most respondents were white (65%)\nwith large populations of blacks (15%) and Hispanics (11%).

Approximately 1 in 4 were current daily smokers, of\nwhom about one-third (or 8% of the Add Health Wave IV\npopulation) smoked a pack or more a day. While 12% reported\nbinge drinking at least weekly, fewer (2.3%) reported exceeding\nrecommended daily limits for moderate drinking (i.e., up to one\ndrink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men)\n[29]. Self-reported past-year marijuana use was relatively common\n(23%) and higher than past-year use of other illicit substances\nPSE as a Predictor of Wave IV Suicidal Behavior\nLow PSE at Waves I and III predicted greater risk of suicidal\nbehavior at Wave IV. Reporting that one had a 50\u00ad50 chance or\nless of living to age 35 at Wave I or Wave III versus reporting that\none was ``almost certain'' of living to age 35 was associated with\na 29% and 44%, respectively, increase in risk of suicidal ideation\nat Wave IV (Table 3). Low PSE at Waves I or III was additionally\nrelated to approximately double the risk of suicide attempt at\nWave IV. Even stronger associations were observed for individuals\nwho reported persistently low PSE at Waves I and III. Compared\nto those who reported high PSE at Waves I and III, individuals\nwho reported low PSE at both waves had twice the risk of suicidal\nideation (RR: 1.93) and more than three times the risk of suicide\nattempt (RR: 3.39) at Wave IV (Table 3).\nSubstance use has been shown to increase the risk of suicidal\nattempts [35]. Nonetheless, associations between PSE and Wave\nIV suicidal behavior persisted even after controlling for concurrent\n(Wave IV) substance use including marijuana use, other illicit\nsubstance use, binge drinking, heavy drinking, and smoking\n(results not shown). In multivariate analyses, Waves I/III de-\npressive symptoms, illicit drug use, history of suicide among family\nor friends and experience of physical or sexual child maltreatment\nwere associated with increased risk of suicide ideation at Wave IV.\nWaves I/III illicit drug use and history of suicide among family or\nfriends predicted suicide attempt at Wave IV (Table S3).\nPSE as a Predictor of Wave IV Substance Use\nLow PSE was associated with drinking, smoking, and illicit\nsubstance use at Wave IV, but only at relatively high levels of use.\nTo conserve space, we only show a subset of relationships in\nTables 4 and 5. The uncondensed tables are available in Tables\nS4, S5, S6, S7, S8. Associations between PSE and substance use\nwere moderately attenuated after controlling for previous sub-\nstance use. For instance, the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for Wave\nI PSE #50% not controlling for previous substance use were 1.95,\n1.79, and 1.68 for exceeding daily limits for moderate drinking,\nsmoking at least a pack a day, and using illicit substances other\nthan marijuana at least weekly, respectively. After controlling for\nprevious substance use the respective AORs were 1.74, 1.62, and\n1.46. Individuals with low PSE at both Waves I and III were about\n2 times as likely to exceed daily limits for moderate drinking, 2.5\nTable 2.

For instance, higher depressive symptoms suggested\ngreater adjusted odds of smoking at least a pack a day and using\nillicit substances other than marijuana at least monthly.\nWe examined Wave I and Wave III PSE as predictors of actual\nmortality risk in young adulthood by assessing ties between PSE\nand death occurring between Waves III and IV (n = 131)\n(Figure 1).

PSE #50% was linked to\nincreased suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in young adult-\nhood, and these associations persist even after accounting for\ndepressive symptoms, history of suicide among family and friends,\nand concurrent substance use in addition to demographic and\nfamily characteristics. Thus, low PSE may uniquely contribute to\nidentifying at-risk youth beyond traditionally assessed risk factors.\nMoreover, this study is also the first to explore ties between\nPSE and varying levels of both legal and illegal substance use.\nDetrimental associations between low PSE and increased\nsubstance use were confined to heavy/regular use rather than\noccasional or moderate substance use. Specifically, low PSE\npredicted smoking at least a pack a day; consuming more than\nthe recommended daily limits for moderate drinking; and using\nillicit substances other than marijuana at least weekly at Wave\nIV. Furthermore, ties between PSE and adult substance use\nendure even after controlling for previous substance use\u00ad\nsuggesting that PSE may continue to be related to future adult\nrisk behaviors above-and-beyond its association with adolescent\nrisk-taking.\nAlthough Wave III PSE was closer in time to Wave IV\noutcomes than Wave I PSE, the pattern and magnitude of\nassociations with Wave IV outcomes were similar for Wave I and\nIII PSE. However, only low Wave I PSE predicted exceeding the\ndaily limits for moderate drinking at Wave IV\u00adhighlighting the\nimportance of examining adolescent developmental factors on\nadult outcomes [36]. Earlier life factors may be important to the\nprediction of adult alcohol use given high rates of experimentation\nand opportunity for the development of substance use disorders in\nadolescence. For instance, 40% of adult alcoholics experience\nUnexpectedly, in this study we found that low PSE at Wave I\nwere related to lower frequency of binge drinking. The complexity\nof motivational factors underlying substance use may help explain\nthe patterning of associations. Episodic binge drinking among\nyoung adults may occur with the expectation of positive affective\nconsequences of drinking. Indeed, social drinking motives (e.g.,\ndrinking to have fun with friends) are the most commonly\nendorsed drinking motives [37]. These drinking motives may be\nless prevalent among individuals with low PSE, leading to lower\nrates of binge drinking. People with low PSE may be more socially\nisolated. In a recent study, Duke and colleagues found that low\nPSE at Waves I and II predicted lower odds of prosocial activities\n(i.e., hanging out with friends, shopping, creative activities) and\ncivic engagement (i.e., volunteer/community service, political\nactivities, voting) at Wave III [8]. Alternatively, drinking to cope\nwith problems (e.g., avoid or escape from problems) often involves\ndrinking alone and is most related to the manifestation of drinking\nproblems and alcohol misuse [37,38,39]. Hence, PSE may predict\nonly a subset of substance use behaviors (i.e., heavy use rather than\nrecreational use). Nonetheless, substance use motives were not\nassessed in Add Health, and warrant further investigation.\nFigure 1. Percent deceased (n = 131) by Wave I and Wave III PSE.\nEarly Death Expectations and Adult Outcomes\nStudy Findings in Context\nOur results are consistent with nascent literature that links\nanticipation of an early death among youth to a broad array of\ndetrimental outcomes including suicidal behavior, participation in\nillegal activities, fight-related injury, and unsafe sexual activity\n[2,3,4]. Nevertheless, these studies examined outcomes among\nadolescents or individuals in their early twenties. This is the first\nstudy to connect PSE with risk behaviors over a decade later\u00ad\nimportant because it suggests that low PSE may have long-lasting\nassociations with harmful outcomes.\nThis study also breaks new ground in research examining PSE\nand varying types of substance use. An Add Health study found\nthat adolescents who reported low PSE at Waves I and II were\nmore likely to report past-year illicit substance use at Wave III\ncompared to those with high PSE at both waves, although effect\nmeasures fell short of statistical significance [8]. Additionally,\nBorowsky et al. found that Wave I PSE was unrelated to past-year\nillicit substance use at Waves II and III [4]. Previous Add Health\nstudies may have had difficulty detecting a relationship between\nlow PSE and illicit substance use because marijuana, the most\ncommon illicit substance, was not differentiated from other\nsubstances. In addition, level of substance use had only been\nexamined as any past-year use. We found that low PSE predicted\nheavy/regular use of legal and illegal substances rather than low\nlevels of substance use. We also connected low PSE to Wave IV\ndeath\u00ad which contrasts with the results of an earlier study based on\nAdd Health data that reported a null relationship between low\nWave I PSE and Wave III death [4]. This earlier study may have\nbeen limited by lower power given that only 96 respondents were\nconfirmed deceased by Wave III.\nIn addition to risk behaviors, low PSE has been related to lower\neducation attainment, personal earnings, physical activity, en-\ngagement with the community, self-esteem and life satisfaction\n[8,40]. The breadth of ties between low PSE and future outcomes\nsuggest that its relationship is not specific to one set of outcomes.\nRather low PSE is predictive of many different adverse outcomes.\nIn addition, the origins of low PSE are diverse\u00adreflecting lived\nexperiences, exposures, and resources such as violence involve-\nment, self-esteem, depressive symptoms, adult and peer connection\nas well as racial/minority status, foreign-birth, and low parental\nsocioeconomic status [4,32]. Thus potential modes of intervention\non low PSE are diverse.\nAt Wave I, close to a quarter of youth with parents receiving\npublic assistance reported low PSE compared to 13% of youth\nwhose parents did not receive public assistance [4]. Although an\nindividual's racial status, foreign-birth or family socioeconomic\nstatus cannot be altered or easily changed, the higher prevalence of\nlow PSE among these groups suggest that designing interventions\nwhich target the healthy youth development of at-risk groups may\nnarrow health inequities. These interventions may take the form of\nmentoring programs that connect youth with professionals in their\nprospective career of interest; college-readiness programs; tutoring\nprograms; after-school recreational programs; summer camp or\na variety of other programs that help keep youths engaged and\nsupport them in the completion of their goals.\nTwo youth programs that have overwhelming success include\nthe Stanford Medical Youth Science Program (SMYSP) and\nBUILD. SMYSP organizes an annual, intensive summer residen-\ntial program for low-income and minority high school students.\nSMYSP participants attend lectures given by Stanford professors,\nparticipate in anatomy labs and hospital internships, and go on\nweekly outings with mentors. To date, 100% of SMYSP\nparticipants have graduated high school; 84% have graduated\nfrom 4-year colleges (five times the rate of other low-income youth\nin California); and 47% have attended medical school or graduate\nschool [41]. Alternatively, BUILD is an educational non-profit\ncombating low high school graduation rates across urban\ncommunities in the United States by ``using entrepreneurship to\nexcite and empower disengaged, low-income youth through high\nschool and college success.'' To date, 100% of their program\ngraduates have completed high school and been accepted to\ncollege [42]. A meta-analysis of mentoring program suggests that\nongoing training of mentors, structured activities, involvement of\nparents, and monitoring of program implementation increases\nachievement of program goals [43].\nStudy Strengths and Limitations\nUsing nationally representative, longitudinal data, this study\nfound that anticipation of an early death was predictive of select\nhealth risk behaviors 6\u00ad13 years later among young adults aged\n24\u00ad32 years. Nonetheless, this study is subject to several\nlimitations. We were unable to assess the influence of numeracy\non the reporting of PSE [44]. Our ability to examine the\nrelationship between PSE and suicidal behavior was constrained\nby the exclusion of people who completed suicide. Respondents\nself-reported their substance use, which may be subject to under-\nreporting. If under-reporting is related to actual substance use\n(e.g., if heavier users under-report), this may attenuate observed\nrelationships between PSE and substance use. However, Add\nHealth used Computer Assisted Self-Interviewing (CASI) on\nsensitive questions pertaining to suicide and substance use, which\nhas been shown to increase reporting of drug use and violence\ncompared to a more standard self-administered questionnaire\n[45]. Moreover, our study focused on the examination of prevalent\nsubstance use behaviors (which are themselves associated with\nhigh health costs) rather than the onset of substance use disorders\nat Wave IV. It is possible that loss to follow-up may have biased\nobserved relationships although the distribution of demographic\ncharacteristics was similar at Wave I and Wave IV, and survey\nweights adjust for attrition across waves.\nStudy Implications\nFuture areas of research include delineation of how low PSE\nrelates to future outcomes. In particular, further understanding of\nmotivational factors for substance use that correlate with low PSE\nis needed. Moreover, further research is needed on how to\nsuccessfully intervene on low PSE and related psychological factors\nassociated with worse health outcomes. Beliefs individuals have\nabout their futures may influence their decision-making. People\nwith fatalistic perceptions of the future may not see the point of\ntrying; they may be more reckless with themselves and others.\nAnticipation of an early death is not a typical health survey\nquestion. However, its demonstrated prevalence among adoles-\ncents and its long-term ties to wide-ranging unfavorable outcomes\nsuggest it may contribute to identifying at-risk youth beyond\nmeasures of depressive symptoms, individual and family socio-\ndemographics, and even previous risk behaviors. PSE may be\nincorporated into health and counseling sessions with adolescents.\nPositive adult connections and increases in self-esteem have been\nlinked with transitioning out of having expectations of an early\ndeath [46]. Interventions may decrease hopelessness cognitions\nand promote positive future orientations by contesting interpreta-\ntions of events viewed through a pessimistic inferential style and\naiding in the development of problem-solving and coping abilities\n[47]. Efforts to delay the onset of alcohol and drug use during\nadolescence; reduce the quantity consumed; and otherwise alter its\npattern of use so as to attenuate its riskiness would lower the\nburden of substance use and related outcomes [48]. The emerging\nEarly Death Expectations and Adult Outcomes\nliterature on PSE highlights the importance of earlier life factors\non adult health and behaviors.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 Variable definitions.\nTable S2 Descriptive Statistics, Add Health.\nTable S3 Perceived Survival Expectations (PSE) as a predictor\nof Wave IV suicidal ideation and attempt, Add Health.\nTable S4 Perceived Survival Expectations (PSE) as a predictor\nof exceeding daily limits for moderate drinking at Wave IV, Add\nHealth.\nTable S5 Perceived Survival Expectations (PSE) as a predictor\nof smoking at least a pack/day Wave IV, Add Health.\nTable S6 Perceived Survival Expectations (PSE) as a predictor\nof illicit drug use (other than marijuana) at Wave IV, Add Health.\nTable S7 Perceived Survival Expectations (PSE) as a predictor\nof binge drinking at Wave IV, Add Health.\nTable S8 Perceived Survival Expectations (PSE) as a predictor\nof marijuana use at Wave IV, Add Health.\n"
