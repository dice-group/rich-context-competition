The aim of this study was to examine\nthe prevalence of lower-extremity PAD, PN, and overall LED in the overall U.S. population and\namong those with and without diagnosed diabetes.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- The analysis consisted of data for 2,873 men\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The main outcome measures consisted of\nthe prevalence of lower-extremity PAD (defined as ankle-brachial index 0.9), PN (defined as\n1 insensate area based on monofilament testing), and of any LED (defined as either PAD, PN,\nor history of foot ulcer or lower-extremity amputations).\nof PAD, PN, and overall LED increases steeply with age and is higher (P  0.05) in non-Hispanic\nblacks and Mexican Americans than non-Hispanic whites. The prevalence of LEDs is approxi-\nCONCLUSIONS -- LED is common in the U.S. and twice as high among individuals with\ndiagnosed diabetes. These conditions disproportionately affect the elderly, non-Hispanic blacks,\nand Mexican Americans.\nLower-extremity disease (LED), in-\ncluding lower-extremity peripheral\narterial disease (PAD) and peripheral\nneuropathy (PN), is disabling and costly\n(1\u00ad5). PAD, which can be accompanied\nby intermittent claudication or rest pain,\nmay necessitate revascularization proce-\ndures and seriously diminish health-\nrelated quality of life. Even when\nasymptomatic, PAD may decrease mobil-\nand is a strong predictor of subsequent\ncardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortal-\nity (3,7,8). PN also erodes health-related\nquality of life, and when it occurs in com-\nbination with PAD, as is frequently the\ncase with diabetes, it can lead to foot ul-\ncers and nontraumatic amputations (1,9).\nDespite the array of complications of\nLED, its epidemiology in the U.S. has not\nbeen well characterized. Previous preva-\nlence estimates for PAD from the U.S. and\nEurope, for example, have ranged from\nfined by symptoms or impaired vibration\nsensation in populations with diabetes\nof this variation is probably due to meth-\nodological differences, including varia-\ntions in definitions, populations, and\nmeasurements. There have been no na-\ntionally representative estimates of the\nprevalence of PAD or PN in the overall\nU.S. population or those with diabetes. In\naddition, previous studies have not exam-\nined the combined burden of PAD and PN\nor the degree to which these conditions\nare specific to individuals with diabetes.\nBecause of the lack of population-\nbased data on LEDs in the U.S. and the\npotential to reduce its burden through\npharmacological or behavioral interven-\nthese conditions were incorporated in the\ntion Examination Survey (NHANES). The\nobjectives of the present study were to\ndetermine the prevalence of LED, includ-\ning lower-extremity PAD and PN in the\nU.S. among both the overall population\nand individuals with diagnosed diabetes.\nMETHODS -- The NHANES is a na-\ntionally representative survey of the U.S.\ncivilian noninstitutionalized population\nconducted by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics of the Centers for Disease\n                                                \nFrom the 1Division of Diabetes Translation, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health\nPromotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia; the 2Epidemiology and Biometry\nProgram, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland;\nand the 3Division of Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys and Division of Epidemiology, National\nCenter for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hyattsville, Maryland.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Edward W.

Participants are inter-\nviewed in their homes to obtain informa-\ntion on health history, health behaviors,\nand risk factors. Participants subse-\nquently undergo the physical examina-\ntion at a mobile examination center. The\nprocedures to select the sample and con-\nduct the interview and examination have\nbeen specified elsewhere (30). Informed\nconsent was obtained from all partici-\npants, and the institutional review board\nof the National Center for Health Statistics\napproved the protocol.\nThis study was based on the initial 2\n40 years who were eligible for the sur-\ntion. All participants aged 40 years who\nreceived the physical examination (n \nment of LEDs, which included noninva-\nsive tests for PAD and PN, as well as\nphysical inspection for foot lesions and\nabnormalities. Two individuals were ex-\ncluded from the entire examination be-\ncause they had bilateral amputations (n \n2). Individuals with ankle-brachial index\n(ABI) 1.5 in both legs (n  2) or in one\nleg (n  4) if the ABI value for the other\nleg was missing were excluded, as these\nindividuals were believed to have medial\narterial calcification, which prevents ac-\ncurate measurement of arterial perfusion.\nData on PAD were missing on both feet for\nowing to either equipment or data capture\nfailure, limited time available to conduct\nthe examination, participant refusal, or\nsome other unspecified reason. An in-\ncompressible artery, absent pulse, or\nsome other condition related to the dis-\nease may have also led to missing data,\nbut this information was unavailable for\nanalysis. Thus, complete information on\nPAD, PN, and all LED data were available\nrespectively, aged 40 years.\nAssessment of PAD\nPAD was assessed by determining the\nABI, which is the ratio of systolic blood\npressure in the ankles (posterior tibial\nvessels) to that in the right arm (right bra-\nchial vessel). Measurements were taken\nwith the participant in the supine position\nusing an 8.1-MHz Doppler probe at-\ntached to a vascular testing device (Parks\nnicians followed a standard protocol (31).\nblood pressure measurements were taken\nat each site (right arm, both ankles), and\nleft and right ABI were calculated as the\nmean of the two measurements at the\nright and left ankle, respectively, divided\nby the mean of the two brachial blood\npressure measurements. For logistic rea-\nsons, participants aged 60 years (n \neach site, and thus, a single measurement\nwas used to calculate the right and left\nOur primary analyses defined PAD as\npoint has been shown to have a high sen-\nsitivity and specificity in angiographic\nstudies (4,32). We also examined the\nprevalence ABI 0.7, which has been de-\nfined as moderate-to-severe PAD. PAD\ncases were classified as symptomatic if the\nparticipant reported \"yes\" when asked\nduring the home interview (before exam-\nination) whether they ever get calf pain in\neither leg while walking.\nAssessment of PN\nPN was assessed using self-reported\nsymptoms and by testing of foot sensation\nwith a standard monofilament (5.07-\ngauge Semmes-Weinstein nylon) accord-\ning to a standard protocol (31). Health\ntechnicians applied pressure with the\nmonofilament at three sites (plantar, first\nmetatarsal head; plantar, fifth metatarsal\nhead; and plantar, hallux) on the bottom\nof each foot (i.e., a total of six sites). The\nmonofilament was applied until it buck-\nled, then held for 1 s. A site was consid-\nered insensate if the participant\nincorrectly determined when the mono-\nfilament was applied to the foot on two of\nthree applications. Impaired sensation\nwas quantified by the total number of in-\nsensate areas for both feet (range 0\u00ad6),\nand PN was defined as 1 insensate area.\nPrevious studies have found 1 insensate\narea to be highly predictive of ulcers and\namputation and to have moderately high\nsensitivity (85%) and specificity\n(80%) based on vibration testing and\nParticipants were also asked during the\ninterview whether in the last 3 months\nthey had had numbness, loss of feeling, or\npainful sensations or tingling in their feet.\nPN cases were classified as symptomatic if\ntheparticipantreportedyestothisquestion.\nOther assessments of LED\nParticipants were also asked whether they\never had an ulcer or sore on their leg or\nfoot that took 4 weeks to heal. During\nthe examination, health technicians also\nrecorded the history of lower-extremity\namputation. Ten individuals with a toe or\nfoot amputation were identified. We de-\nfined any LED as a presence of either PAD\n(ABI 0.9), PN (1 insensate areas), foot\nulcers, or lower-extremity amputation.\nWe defined symptomatic LED as having\neither PAD or PN symptoms.\nDiabetes and other measurements\nA history of physician-diagnosed diabe-\ntes, hypertension, stroke, and CVD (con-\ngestive heart failure, coronary heart\ndisease, angina, heart attack) as well as\nage, race/ethnicity, and smoking was as-\nsessed by questionnaire (30). Because of\nthe limited sample, only estimates for non-\nHispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,\nand Mexican Americans are reported, al-\nthough data for other race/ethnicity\ngroups are included in total estimates. In-\ndividuals were classified as never, former,\nand current smokers based on their re-\nsponses to questions about smoking at\nleast 100 cigarettes during their lifetime\nand whether they were currently smok-\ning. Additionally, height and weight were\nmeasured with a standard protocol and\nused to compute BMI (kg/m2).\nStatistical analyses\nOur primary analyses estimated the prev-\nalence of the diseases of interest in the\noverall population and within several\nsubgroups. All analyses were conducted\nusing SUDAAN software to take into ac-\ncount the complex sampling design and\nto obtain estimates representative of the\nnoninstitutionalized U.S. population\naged 40 years (36). For each of the pri-\nmary outcomes, we used the largest sam-\nple number available to estimate\nprevalence. For PAD and PN, this was\ntively. For any LED, we used the number\nof individuals who had all variables (PAD,\nPN, amputations, ulcers) present (n \nlated using the \"delete one\" jackknife\nputed using the critical value for a t dis-\nLower-extremity disease in the U.S.\ntribution with the appropriate number of\ndegrees of freedom for each subgroup\n(SDJ1REPN-1). Age-adjusted prevalence\nestimates were calculated using the direct\nmethod, which were age adjusted to the\n75 years (38). Estimates with a relative\nstandard error 30% were considered\nstatistically unreliable and are identified\nas such in tables. Statistical hypotheses\nwere tested univariately at the 0.05 level\nusing a t-statistic.\nBecause there were missing data for\nples, we examined the characteristics of\nindividuals with missing data. Compared\nwith individuals with sufficient PAD data,\nthose individuals with missing PAD data\nwere significantly more likely to be 60\ndiffer with regard to CVD or current\nsmoking status. Individuals with missing\nPN data did not significantly differ from\nthose with PN data in terms of age, sex,\ndiabetes, CVD, or current smoking status\nbut were more likely to be non-Hispanic\nblack (17%) than individuals with PN\nBecause of these differences, we fur-\nther examined the potential impact of\nnonresponse by adjusting the original\nsampling weights according to methods\npublished by Lohr (39). Examination of\nfindings using these adjusted weights led\nto only minor differences in point and\nthis study, we present all estimates using\nthe original 2-year examination weights.\nRESULTS -- The general characteris-\ntics of the study population, weighted to\nbe representative of the U.S. population\n40 years of age, are shown in Table 1.\nThe mean age of this segment of the pop-\nulation was estimated to be 57 years, with\nican American. In addition, by self-report,\nsion, and 11.5% had CVD. Compared\nwith the overall population, the diabetic\npopulation was older (mean age 62\nyears), consisted of more nonwhites, had\nhigher BMI values, fewer smokers, and a\nhigher prevalence of hypertension, CVD,\nand stroke.\nAmong U.S. adults aged 40 years,\n(Fig. 1), among whom almost two-thirds\nwere asymptomatic (i.e., no calf pain with\nwalking) and almost one-third (1.3%\nnot shown). Prevalence of PN (1 insen-\nsate area) was 14.8%, among whom over\nthree-fourths were asymptomatic. Almost\none-half of those with PN had two or\nand over one-fourth had three or more\nshown).

Estimates\nsimilar to or lower than those in our study\nwere observed for white women in the\nStudy of Osteoporotic Fractures (18),\nwomen without CVD in the Cardiovascu-\nlar Health Study (12), and men in the Ho-\nnolulu Heart Study (3\u00ad5% among those\nfrom the Netherlands, Scotland, and men\nin the Cardiovascular Health Study all\nhad prevalence estimates ranging from 8\nto 12% for individuals of similar age as\n13). Previous estimates among diabetic\npopulations have been considerably\nand in the Honolulu Heart Study (15)\nbut comparable in India and Australia\nThe lower prevalence we observed\ncould be due to several factors. Although\nprevious studies sampled individuals\nfrom population-based sources, there\nmay have been varying levels of represen-\ntativeness of the underlying population. It\nis possible that previous studies have se-\nlectively recruited individuals of worse\nhealth status, or alternatively, that the de-\nmands of the NHANES examination leads\nto a slightly healthier sample. It is also\npossible that there was a higher rate of\nmissing data, and unmeasureable ABI val-\nues in our sample led to an underestimat-\ning prevalence. Finally, this could reflect a\nreduction in PAD incidence or CVD risk\nfactors over the past decade, as most pre-\nvious studies were not conducted re-\ncently. This would be consistent with the\nobserved reductions in CVD risk factors\nand mortality in the U.S. (44), but no lon-\ngitudinal data exist to support or refute\nthis speculation. Unfortunately, the lack\nof consistency in methods of recruiting,\nconducting, and reporting studies of\nLED makes it difficult to identify the\nkey reasons explaining discrepancies in\nprevalence.\nBecause of the wide variation in defi-\nnitions, it is also difficult to compare PN\nprevalence estimates between popula-\ntions and over time. In the San Luis Valley\nTable 2--Age-specific and age-adjusted prevalence of LED by sex and race/ethnicity in the U.S. population aged >40 years\nCharacteristics\nAge specific\nAge (years)\nU.S. population)\nSex\nRace/ethnicity\nMen\nWomen\n*Age-specific comparisons were not applicable because some of the estimates were statistically unreliable; reference group for statistical analyses; does not meet\nstandard of statistical reliability and precision (relative SE 30%); \u00a7significantly different from reference group (P  0.05).\nGregg and Associates\nDiabetes Study, prevalence based on vi-\nbration threshold testing was 28% in the\ndiabetic population and 4% in those with-\nout diabetes (45). Similarly, a hospital-\nbased population in the U.K. had a\nprevalence of 29% (22), whereas a recent\npopulation-based study in Australia\nfound a prevalence of 10% among indi-\nviduals with diabetes (17). In a recent\nstudy in Northwest England that used\nmethods similar to our study, prevalence\nof insensate feet among individuals with\nstudies have defined PN based on vibra-\ntion threshold, temperature perception,\nand ankle reflexes, finding that preva-\nvey, 38% of the diabetic population and\n11% of those without diabetes had symp-\ntoms of sensory neuropathy, which was\ndefined as numbness, loss of feeling, pain,\nor tingling in the last 3 months. Our study\nis the first nationally representative study\nin the U.S. to examine PN based on an ob-\njective measure of sensation (monofila-\nment testing) and, thus, should serve as an\nimportant baseline for surveillance of PN.\nThere are several potential limitations\nto our study. First, NHANES does not in-\nclude individuals from nursing homes\nand other similar institutions. Thus, our\nestimates probably underestimate those\nof the total U.S. population. Second,\nwithin the NHANES sample, ABI mea-\nsurements were not available for 17% of\nthe sample, many of whom may have had\ndisease. Adjustment procedures were\nused to decrease the potential nonre-\nsponse bias, but not all factors can be ac-\ncounted for, and thus, it is more likely\nthat we have underestimated than overes-\ntimated the true disease prevalence.\nThird, our prevalence definitions are\nbased on noninvasive indicators of dis-\nease. The ABI has emerged as a measure-\nment of choice for PAD because it is a\nnoninvasive and inexpensive yet a more\nindicator of arterial obstruction (33,34)\nthan previously used measures, such as\nintermittent claudication or pulse inspec-\ntion. For PN, electrophysiological and\nnerve conduction studies could give more\naccurate diagnostic data, but for epidemi-\nological settings, monofiliament testing is\nstill an improvement over the previously\nused symptom questionnaires in terms of\nsensitivity, specificity, and prediction of\nto both PAD and PN, however, it is im-\nportant to note that the choice of disease\ncut points are based on clinic-based,\nsymptomatic samples of individuals for\nABI (4,10) and diabetic individuals for\nmonofilament testing (1,1,34). Thus, val-\nidation studies are still needed among\nbroader population samples to further re-\nfine the use of these measures for epide-\nmiological surveillance purposes. Finally,\nwe lacked detailed information on symp-\ntoms and lacked power to examine prev-\nalence estimates within subgroups,\nincluding individuals with undiagnosed\ndiabetes and impaired glucose tolerance,\nas well as age, sex, or ethnicity subgroups\namong individuals with diabetes.\nThis study provides the first national\nestimates in the U.S. of the civilian, non-\ninstitutionalized population and, thus,\nthe most broadly representative estimates\nto date for the U.S. population. Because\nmuch of this burden may be preventable\nthrough existing interventions, these data\nshould provide policy makers, clinicians,\nand researchers with key data for preven-\ntion and treatment efforts. This study also\nprovides baseline data to monitor the\nprevalence of LED, its consequences, and\nthe success of prevention efforts.\nReferences\n1.
