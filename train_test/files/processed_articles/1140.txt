Furthermore, I discuss why demographers who are\ninterested in socio-cultural issues such as gender should supplement their tool box with\nqualitative methods. I use an integrated qualitative/quantitative study of women's\nsituation in rural Malawi as a case study to demonstrate that the sum of the two data\nsources can be greater than the separate parts.\nDemographers typically use quantitative data (e.g., from censuses, surveys) to\nexamine macro-level processes and to focus on aggregate, often cross-cultural,\ncomparisons. Effective analysis of objective quantifiable variables benefits from an\nunderstanding of the social context from which they come. When examining variables\nand concepts that are socially constructed and defined, however, it is essential to\ncontextualize the variables of interest. In this paper, I give examples of qualitative\nmethods that are accessible to demographers, methods that can improve the\ninterpretation of quantitative findings and the quality of quantitative measures. As\nsocial demographers probe the relationship between demographic outcomes and socio-\ncultural concepts such as gender, this type of investigation clearly shows a need for\ntriangulating data sources, particularly an iterative process of qualitative and\nquantitative data collection. By nesting qualitative work within survey research,\ndemographers retain the breadth and generalizability available through survey data and\ngain rich nuanced information to help them explain gendered realities in the local\ncontext.\n2. Demographers investigate women's situation\nThe 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) piqued\ndemographers' interest in the study of women's position because it posited a\nrelationship between women's situation (status, autonomy, and empowerment) and\nsexual and reproductive health outcomes. As a result of this focus, demographers have\ninvestigated the theorized relationship between women's situation and fertility-related\n2002). Quantitative findings in this area have largely confounded researchers; few\nauthors have found positive relationships between women's position and fertility\noutcomes (exceptions include Hindin 2000; Morgan and Niraula 1995; Morgan et al.\n2002). Demographers still do not have a clear understanding of the links between\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 5\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 145\nwomen's situation and reproductive health, despite their attempts to capture the multi-\ndimensionality of women's position with both proxies (e.g., education, employment\nstatus, and age at marriage) and more proximate measures (e.g., freedom of movement,\nhousehold decision-making power, violence against women) (Blanc et al. 1996;\nThe lack of evidence of a relationship between women's situation and fertility-\nrelated behavior may be partly attributable to inappropriate or poorly specified\nmeasures (Mason and Smith 2001). Demographers are still in the early stages of\nunderstanding gender and how to measure it. Many variables that demographers use to\ndenote gender refer to \"women,\" but actually do not capture gendered realities (Kaler\nconceptualization of gender in the right direction. Even these variables, however, lack\nconsensus among demographers in terms of terminology, meaning, and measurement.\nThese proximate measures are largely associated with male-female relations of power\nand authority, about which Mason and Smith (2001) have \"very little confidence that\nwe are measuring ...in a meaningful way\" (p 1).\nThere are some basic disadvantages and problems with current quantitative\nmeasures of women's situation; I will mention four that have affected my own work.\nFirst, existing data often lack qualitative grounding or cultural adaptation;\nunderstanding the gender context prior to creating survey questions is crucial. Questions\nwith cultural meaning and significance in capturing women's situation in Asia may not\ncapture the same concepts in Africa. Second, survey researchers often include questions\nthat explicitly measure women's situation only on women's questionnaires (Becker\nwomen about women's situation, researchers miss information about norms and\nhousehold dynamics when the male perspective is absent from the analysis (Becker\n1996). Third, the dichotomous nature of common proximate measures hides situational\nnuances; for example, describing how or why a decision was made. One way to address\nthe latter issue is through better-specified questions that are based on an understanding\nof the local context. Another solution is to allow for open responses to survey\nquestions. When those solutions are insufficient, demographers need to look to\nqualitative data to reveal and explain those nuances. Fourth, quantitative measures of\nwomen's situation rarely sufficiently address gendered processes in the household.\nQualitative data can reveal not only what happens between women and men in a\nhousehold, but also how and why these events occur, and they can do so in ways that\nquantitative data cannot capture. Although better quantitative data can and should\naddress some of these issues, a more-nuanced conceptualization of the gendered\nprocesses and of the local context gained through the collection of qualitative data will\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 5\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n146 http://www.demographic-research.org\nforward demographers' understanding of women's situation. Furthermore, this\nunderstanding can illuminate quantitative data on women's position in new ways.\nI am not arguing that demographers should throw out survey methods and become\nethnographers. Instead, I believe that demographers can use qualitative data and\nmethods to collect better quantitative data and to improve an understanding and\n1997). Qualitative methods and data can lend themselves to three important\nimprovements in quantitative data: 1) testing of quantitative findings, 2)\ncontextualization of results, and 3) conceptualization of concepts and variables.\nAlthough my main focus in this paper is on furthering demographic research on\nwomen's situation, my case study can also be used as an example of the usefulness of\nqualitative methods for the study of other social phenomena.\n3. Gender and context in rural Malawi: a case study\nThe case study I present uses survey and ethnographic data from the Malawi Diffusion\nwomen and their spouses), and I conducted supplemental qualitative projects in 1999\nand 2000 (N~50 women and their spouses). The MDICP data used in this paper come\nfrom two areas of rural Malawi--one site in the southern region and one site in the\nnorthern region. The MDICP 1998 survey (henceforth referred to as Malawi 1) included\nmeasures of women's education and income as well as a gender module with more\nproximate measures of women's situation. The ethnographic data include my own non-\nparticipant observations and repeated in-depth interviews with 91 respondents (50\nwomen and 41 men). This case study demonstrates the advantages of combining\nquantitative and qualitative data to further an understanding of women's situation in\nrural Malawi. The quantitative data provide a sense of macro-level attitudes and\nopinions about women's situation and enable a statistical analysis of the relationship\nbetween women's situation and reproductive outcomes. Although such statistical\nrelationships are difficult to establish with qualitative data, the in-depth interviews\nuncover processes and mechanisms that underlie women's situation at the micro-level.\nBy integrating the two data sources, I begin to unpack the \"black-box\" of women's\nsituation in rural Malawi. The nested nature of my study allows me to compare directly\nqualitative and survey responses of individual respondents as well as to extrapolate my\nqualitative findings to the larger MDICP study population.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 5\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 147\n4. Data and methods\nIn 1998, MDICP conducted a survey in three study sites, one in each of Malawi's three\nregions: Rumphi in the north, Mchinji in the center, and Balaka in the south (Note 1). I\nrestrict both my quantitative and qualitative data to the respondents interviewed in the\nnorthern and southern sites. These two sites present a clear contrast in terms of\nethnicity, religion, and kin structure. The majority of households in the northern site are\nTumbuka, Protestant, patrilineal, and patrilocal, whereas the population in the southern\nsite is predominantly Yao and Muslim and generally follows matrilineal and matrilocal\nresidence patterns (Note 2). Both of these sites are in rural areas with very few\namenities--e.g., no running water or electricity. In addition, the level of poverty in\nthese areas is generally quite high (Malawi Government 2000; UNIMA Center for\nstudy--the Gender Context Study (GCS) (Note 3). During that period, I devoted three\nmonths to the collection of qualitative data in the form of non-participant observation\nand semi-structured interviews in 14 villages in the northern and southern MDICP\nstudy areas. My qualitative research focused on gendered mechanisms and processes\nwithin households and the larger community.\n4.1 Malawi 1 Survey and GCS Samples\nIn each of the MDICP sites, the 1998 survey sample consists of approximately 500\never-married women of childbearing age (between the ages 15 and 49) and their\nspouses. The sample for the two sites on which I focus includes 1174 women and 1002\nmen. The survey response rate was 85% among women (999 women) and 67% among\nFor the GCS, I selected a purposeful sub-sample of 50 couples from the Malawi 1\nsample. Although a random sub-sample might have helped to legitimize claims of\naccurate representation of the Malawi 1 sample, the purposeful sub-sample assured\nheterogeneity of the Malawi 1 sample, ensuring variation in age, marital status,\nmarriage type, lineage, and residence patterns (Note 4). Table 1 shows the regional\ndistribution of the GCS sample by these characteristics (Note 5). The sampled couples\nin the southern site came from three Malawi 1 villages. I drew the sample in the\nnorthern site from three clusters of Malawi 1 villages; each cluster approximated the\nsize of the villages in the southern site. I interviewed 76% of the originally sampled\ncouples; after replacing the couples that I was unable to find, the couple response rate\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 5\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n148 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 1: Gender Context Study (GCS) Sample\n(Number of respondents/couples in each category)\nTotal South North\nWomen's age\nMarital Status\nMarriage type(of married couples)\nLineage\nResidence\n4.2 Measures of women's situation\nIn addition to collecting common proxies of women's situation such as educational\nattainment, economic activity, age at marriage, and age difference between spouses, the\nMalawi 1 survey included a gender module with potentially relevant proximate\nmeasures of women's situation. Table 2 shows the Malawi 1 survey findings for the\nfour sets of proximate measures: 1) women's perceived control over reproductive\ndecision-making (four questions), 2) attitudes about divorce (five questions), 3)\nattitudes about freedom of movement (2 questions), and 4) women's control over\nmoney (three questions). These questions operationalize multiple dimensions of\nwomen's situation--decision-making, attitudes about divorce, movement, and\neconomic control (Mason 1986). I included the Malawi 1 gender module topics on the\nsemi-structured GCS interview guide. By collecting data on similar topics, I was able\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 5\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 149\nto compare responses on the Malawi 1 fixed-choice questions to the GCS open-ended\nresponses.\nTable 2: Malawi 1 Women's Situation Variables\nTotal South North\nFamily Planning Decision-Making\nA woman can:\nDo something if husband won't use family planning 58% 60% 55%\nGet her husband to agree if she wants to delay next birth 55 37 72\nGet her husband to agree if she wants to stop childbearing 35 31 40\nWould use secretly if her husband doesn't want to use FP 57 42 72\nDivorce Attitudes\nA woman can leave her husband if:\nFreedom of Movement\nA woman can go without her husband's permission to:\nControl over Money\nWoman tells husband about money\n(of women who do income generating work)\nThe qualitative interviews further explored issues associated with marriage,\npolygyny, household decision-making, family planning, and HIV/AIDS. I developed\nthe GCS interview guide primarily to investigate questions that initial quantitative\nfindings from the Malawi 1 survey raised about power and authority in gendered\nbelow.\nThe emergent 1994 ICPD ideology as well as previous demographic, sociological,\nand anthropological research led the MDICP team to believe that women who report a\ngreater sense of control over their own fertility, who had more liberal attitudes about\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 5\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n150 http://www.demographic-research.org\ndivorce, who reported greater freedom of movement, and who had more control over\nincome sources would have greater status, autonomy and power (Blanc et al. 1996;\nUnited Nations 1995). MDICP researchers also expected to find that women in the\nmatrilineal/matrilocal southern site would score higher than women in the northern site\nrelationship between women's situation and reproductive behavior, the premise for\ncollecting such quantitative data was primarily to analyze relationships between gender\nvariables and fertility behavior as well as other sexual and reproductive health outcomes\nMy analyses of the Malawi 1 survey data show that rather than correlating with\none another, each of the four dimensions had different levels and salience in the two\nregions (Schatz 1999, 2002). In addition, I found that a higher percentage of women in\nthe northern site reported autonomous behavior than women in the southern site on\nmany of the indicators (see Table 2). At the individual level, the relationships between\nwomen's situation measures and fertility behavior (e.g., contraceptive use, unmet need)\nwere weak and inconsistent. Neither individual measures of women's situation nor\nindices of multiple questions (determined by theme and factor analyses) were correlated\nwith fertility behavior. Furthermore, logistic regression analyses, which controlled for\ndemographic characteristics and other relevant variables, revealed few significant\nresults. Among the women's situation measures, only the family planning decision-\nmaking index was a significant predictor of fertility behavior. I went on to examine\nregional differences in women's situation; and, finally, I regressed each of the fertility\noutcomes on regionally grouped data for each of the women's situation indices in order\nto assess the regional-level relationship therein. The results showed that women in the\nsouthern site did not consistently score higher on these measures than women in the\nnorthern site, as I had expected they would. In addition, at the aggregate level, the only\nconsistent significant relationship was between the family planning decision-making\nindex and ever-use of a modern method of contraception. These unexpected results\nraise many questions about women's situation in rural areas of Malawi, or at least raise\nquestions about the measurement of women's situation in this setting. I decided to\nexplore these surprising findings with a rigorous qualitative study.\nThe GCS gave me a sense that women in the North and South differed in ways not\nreflected in the survey results. The in-depth interviews, which explored unanswered\nquestions from the quantitative analysis, further proved this point. These questions\nincluded why women in the southern site did not have consistently greater autonomy,\nstatus, and power than women in the northern site and why freedom of movement,\nattitudes about divorce, and control over money did not seem to predict fertility\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 5\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 151\nbehavior. I found that the social environments and constraints differ greatly between the\ntwo sites, primarily because of differences in residence patterns, kin networks, and\nphysical proximity to busy roads. I also found that, despite considerable variations in\nsocial environments, women in Malawi, in both the North and South, were not meek or\ndisempowered. Rather, through the interviews and observing village life, I discovered\nthat women in Malawi find ways to influence and, at times, to manipulate their\nenvironment to get what they want.\n4.3 Rigorous qualitative data collection\nDuring my time in the field, I trained 16 local interviewers, who then conducted\nrepeated semi-structured interviews with 50 female and 41 male respondents (Note 7).\nRather than interviewing respondents myself through a translator, I opted to have the\nlocal interviewers conduct the interviews to improve their flow (Note 8). However,\nhaving the local interviewers conduct the interviews without my interference made\nrigorous interviewer-training essential. If the interviewers had not grasped the concepts\nof the study or had not developed very good qualitative interviewing skills, the project\nwould not have been successful.\nThe interviewers I hired had worked mainly with MDICP as enumerators for\nsurvey data collection. Thus, it was crucial for me to stress the following issues in\ntraining: 1) the need to ask questions in a format that did not allow single-word\nresponses, 2) the merits of prompting respondents to elaborate on their answers, and 3)\nthe importance of creating a conversational atmosphere with the respondent to enable\nthe respondent to shape the conversation along with the interviewer (Note 9). During\nthe training sessions, I also focused on the importance of verbal and listening skills,\nwhich improve qualitative interviewing. I continued working very closely with the local\ninterviewers during the four days of training and throughout the fieldwork to ensure\nhigh quality of the data.\nMy presence in the field provided me with a unique opportunity to follow up each\nrespondent's first general interview with a more-directed second interview. I was able\nto get more-complete stories by reading the English transcription of the first interview\nand creating a unique second interview-guide for each respondent. In this way, I was\nable to gain additional insight into issues that the first interview did not fully reveal as\nwell as to fill in gaps where an interviewer had missed or misunderstood a question on\nthe first-round interview guide. That two-part interviewing process gave me back some\nof the control over the interviewing process that I had lost by not conducting the\ninterviews myself.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 5\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n152 http://www.demographic-research.org\nOnce the interviews were transcribed and typed, I inductively coded them\nfollowing Corbin and Strauss' guidelines--reading the interviews for emergent themes\n(Corbin and Strauss 1990; Strauss and Corbin 1990). Inductive coding involves closely\nreading each transcript and creating codes--phrases or words--that capture the idea or\ntheme of a section. About 150 themes emerged while I coded the interviews, and\nanother 350 smaller sub-codes emerged within those themes. I then grouped these into\n20 axial-code categories. These coding groups facilitated the analyses of the qualitative\ndata.\n5. Comparing, contextualizing, and conceptualizing\nThe Malawi 1 survey contributes to demographic research on women's situation\nthrough proximate measures and by facilitating an analysis of the relationship between\nthose measures and fertility behavior. Alone, however, these data are limited\nconceptually and in scope. This is not to suggest, however, that these quantitative data\nhave no merit, but that they more-prominently advance research when they are\ncombined with the nested GCS qualitative data. In the following sections, I compare\nfindings from the two data sources, showing how the qualitative data can act as a check\nfor hypothesized and unexpected survey findings. I employ the qualitative data to\ncontextualize the quantitative data, illuminating social practices, beliefs, and norms that\nshape women's position. Finally, I use the qualitative data to conceptualize better\nqualitative measures to use in rural Malawi in the future.\n5.1 Comparing samples and findings: the advantages of a nested study\nNesting the GCS study within the MDICP had two main advantages: 1) it reduced the\nnon-representativeness of my purposefully selected qualitative sub-sample; and 2) it\nenabled me to directly compare quantitative and qualitative responses for individual\nrespondents.\n5.2 Extrapolating from a small \"N\"\nTable 3 shows traits of women in the GCS sub-sample and the Malawi 1 sample as\nmeasured in the 1998 MDICP survey (Note 10).

I tested differences between the two samples\nin STATA using unpaired `ttests' for the difference between means and `prtests' for\ndifferences in the proportion of women who answered given questions in the\naffirmative. The only variables for which there are significant differences between the\ntwo samples are the number of children ever born (total samples), mean years of\nschooling (northern samples), and women reporting the acceptability of divorcing a\nman who does not support his wife financially (total samples, southern samples). The\nmost-striking differences shown in Table 3 are not those between the GCS sub-sample\nand the Malawi 1 sample, but, rather, differences between the women living in the\nsouthern site and those living in the North. The similarities, as seen in this table,\nbetween the two samples are remarkable considering the small sub-sample size and the\nfact that I purposefully sampled respondents on other characteristics (age, marital\nstatus, marriage type, residence, and lineage). The match of the GCS and Malawi 1\nsamples gives me confidence that I can extrapolate trends and concepts found in the\nGCS data to the larger Malawi 1 population.\n5.3 Comparing quantitative and qualitative responses\nThe nested GCS sample allows for direct comparison of the survey findings with\nnarratives on similar topics. The qualitative data can then help to clarify the ways in\nwhich respondents understood the Malawi 1 questions--i.e., what they heard, how they\nthought they were responding, and the details missed because of the questions'\ndichotomous nature. Table 4 provides an example of how the fixed-choice questions\ndiffered from the open-ended questions, juxtaposing the survey schedule with the\nqualitative interview schedule for the freedom of movement questions. Below I\nThe narratives that emerged from the GCS questions about freedom of movement\nrevealed that the form of the Malawi 1 questions was problematic. The two freedom of\nmovement questions on the Malawi 1 survey asked specifically about whether or not a\nwoman could go to the health center or the market without her husband's permission.\nThe only possible answers were \"yes\" or \"no.\" The qualitative accounts, however,\nmake it clear that women make decisions about movement on a case-by-case basis--for\nthe majority of women, a discrete \"yes\" or \"no\" answer was insufficient. In both the\nsouthern and the northern sites, the decision of whether or not to ask permission from\none's husband before going somewhere depends on many factors: 1) how urgent the\ntrip is; 2) how far the place is from her home; 3) how long the trip will to take; 4) how\nclear the purpose of the trip is; 5) if her husband is around or not, and if leaving a note\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 5\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 155\nis sufficient notification or not; or 6) if she needs/has the money needed for the trip.\nWomen may take all or some of these factors into account when determining whether or\nnot to ask their husbands for permission before going somewhere.\nTable 4: Differences in Quantitative and Qualitative Questions\nMalawi 1 Survey Questions GCS Qualitative Questions\nFreedom of\nMovement\nIs it acceptable for you to go to\nthe local market without\ninforming your husband?\nIs it acceptable for you to go to\nthe local health center\nwithout informing your\nhusband?\nWhat kinds of things do you need your\nhusband's permission to do?\nCan you give me an example of a time you\nasked his permission to do something?\nWhat about going places?\nWhat places do you need his permission to\ngo to?\nWhat about places that you just tell him\nbefore going?\nWhat places are okay for you to go on your\nown?\nWhat places do you go together?\nWhat happens if you don't ask permission or\ntell him before you go?\nCan you tell me about a time this happened?\nTaking advantage of the nested GCS sample, we can look at a couple of examples\nof women who reported seemingly contradictory responses between the survey and the\nqualitative interviews. For example, Lyness, a 22-year-old mother of two from the\nnorthern site, reported on the Malawi 1 survey that she could go to neither the market\nnor the health center without her husband's permission (Note 11). In 2000, in the in-\ndepth interviews, it became clear that there are times when she goes places without first\ngetting her husband's permission:\n[There are] many things [that I do only after telling my husband]. Like business\nissues, I need to tell him I want to do such-and-such a business. If there is\nmoney needed to buy relish [vegetables], going to the maize mill, well, I tell\nhim [that I need money]. [Other things I do without telling him like] buying\nrelish, if there is money already, I go on my own. Whether I need soap and I\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 5\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n156 http://www.demographic-research.org\nSometimes Lyness does ask permission or informs her husband before going places--\nthis may take the form of asking for money to go to the market or maize mill. At other\ntimes, particularly if she already has money, she goes on her own; that was not clear\nfrom her survey responses.\nEmily is another respondent who reported in 1998 that she would not go to either\nthe market or the health center without her husband's permission. Emily lives in the\nsouthern site; she is 43 years old and has five children and one co-wife. Despite\nclaiming in 1998 that she cannot go places without her husband's permission, she\nThe first time we separated [it was] because of a trip. We had a women's [church\nguild] trip to Monkey Bay [~100 km away], and we all contributed money for\nthe trip. When I told him [I was going], [he did not want me to go]. But, I just\nwent there on my own wish, and when I came back, I found him gone to his first\nwife with his belongings... And I just told myself to let him go, if he needs me,\nhe will come back... Then after a week, I saw him coming. I greeted him and he\nsaid, `I have come as you are my wife.' And I said, `I thought you would not\ncome again.' I accused him of separating despite the fact that I had gone to listen\nto God's words and not just anywhere. He said, `Okay, it was just a mistake,'\nand that he would not do it again. Then we continued staying together (9011,\nThe story that she told in 2000 demonstrates that she did in fact ask her husband for\npermission before going on this trip, which took her much farther than either the local\nmarket or health center. When her husband refused permission, however, she decided to\ngo anyway. Her actions led to a short marital separation, but when her husband\nreturned, it was he, not she, who apologized.\nNearly all of the women who reported on the Malawi 1 survey that they could go\nto the health center and/or the market without permission also gave less-definitive\nanswers about movement in the qualitative interviews. In 1998, Rose, a 39-year-old\nmarried woman with five children from the North, said that she can go to both the\nhealth center and the market without asking permission. When asked in the GCS\ninterview what would happen if she went somewhere without first asking her husband,\nshe said, \"Then we could not agree. When I am going out, I have to inform him. If I\ndon't, then I would be annoying him. He would ask me why I do that\" (112011, Rumphi\n2000). However, she went on to say that there are places that she can go and only\ninform her husband on her return. For example, she told the following story: \"I\nremember one time I went to Mhuju [nearby trading center] to get my dress at a tailor\nwhen [my husband] was out... When I came back, he asked me where I had gone.\n`Why did you not tell me you were going away?' Then I told him that I went out\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 5\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 157\nnarratives show that women may perceive a need to ask their husbands for permission\nbefore going places, but that, in actuality, their decision to seek or not to seek\npermission before going somewhere depends on the circumstances of the situation.\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to conclude that the quantitative and qualitative\nresults are systematically opposite of one another. Instead, the qualitative interviews\nexposed that decisions about movement are situational. From the qualitative narratives\nwe can see that the Malawi 1 freedom of movement findings can be misleading.\nConducting in-depth interviews with a sub-sample of the Malawi 1 sample enabled me\nto compare not only general qualitative and quantitative responses, but also responses\nby individual respondents. The qualitative responses showed that women, regardless of\nwhether or not they reported in 1998 that they could go to the market or health center\nwithout asking permission, were actually making decisions about going places on a\ncase-by-case basis and were weighing a number of factors before making a decision to\ngo somewhere. Thus, in 1998, the responses to these fixed-choice questions likely\ndepended on the particular situation the respondent was recalling. This knowledge can\nhelp demographers to construct a more-precise quantitative instrument by clarifying a\nneed to direct respondents to discuss a specific time the event occurred (e.g., the last\ntime) and probing for factors that contributed to the final decision.\n5.4 Contextualizing quantitative data\nThe questions on the Malawi 1 survey that measure each of the women's situation\ndimensions are helpful in revealing aggregate levels of these measures, but they cannot\nfully address how families make decisions about contraceptive use, divorce, physical\nmobility, and money. The qualitative data help to contextualize these issues as well as\nto expand the understanding of how each of these is operationalized in the local context.\nThe GCS data can help to contextualize Malawi 1 survey data by revealing reasons for\nunexpected results, offering multiple perspectives and explanations about each issue,\naccounting for the processes and mechanisms by which decisions are made and\nopinions are formed, and providing a thick description of the local environment. All of\nthese provide grounding to the survey data and depict in more-nuanced detail the world\nin which the Malawi 1 respondents live.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 5\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n158 http://www.demographic-research.org\n5.5 Unanticipated differences, contextualizing unexpected findings\nIn 2000, while spending time traveling from my accommodations in each site to the\nfield, I became acutely aware of social and physical differences between the MDICP\nnorthern and southern sites (Note 12). Although these areas are quite similar in certain\nways--both are about 25 kilometers from a town, and none of the residents in either site\nhas access to amenities such as running water or electricity--the two sites differ greatly\nin terms of social and physical layouts. The ability to monitor one's spouse, or wife in\nparticular, is very different in the two sites for two reasons: 1) social structure and\nresidence and 2) physical closeness to a main road. These differences shed light on the\nunexpected quantitative results that showed that a much-higher percentage of women in\nthe northern site ranked high on the freedom of movement measures than women in the\nsouthern site (see Table 2 above). The qualitative interviews with both the women and\ntheir husbands also support the findings that contextual differences drive the\nquantitative results rather than differences in women's situation per se. It could\nalternatively be argued that these cultural differences influence and shape women's\nThe sites' proximity to a main road or trading center is also an influence on the\ndifferences between the North and South in women's freedom of movement: the\nsouthern site encircles a trading center; in the North, the majority of Malawi 1\nrespondents live several kilometers from a main road. Thus, in the South, the \"market\"\nand \"health center\" are along busy main roads where women are outside of their\nvillage-environment. In the North, the \"market\" and \"health center\" are more contained\nwithin their communities. Partly because of those differences, mobility has a different\nmeaning or weight in the two sites.\nAnother factor affecting women's movement differently in the two sites has to do\nwith the ability of the husband's family members to monitor women's movements. This\ndistinction is mainly a function of social structure--i.e., who lives around the couple\nand helps the man to monitor his wife's movements. In the northern site, married\nwomen usually live among their husbands' kin. In the southern site, there is much-more\nfluidity of residence, but many of the married female respondents live among their own\nkin. Having the husband's kin, in addition to the man himself, living in the area may\nincrease a family's ability to monitor a woman's movements and, thus, effectively\nincrease her freedom to move within a contained area. For example, if a man's kin are\ndispersed throughout a village, they can keep track of his wife's movements; thus, his\nwife may be able to move freely throughout that village without arousing suspicions of\nmisconduct because her husband's relatives know where she is. In future survey rounds,\nthese issues of where services are situated and the ability of kin to monitor a woman's\nmovement can be constructed as variables and added to the survey instrument. Once\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 5\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 159\nquantified, it would be possible to control for these issues to get a more-nuanced sense\nof women's freedom of movement.\n5.6 Multiple perspectives, emerging meanings\nMen's role in shaping women's situation, especially within the context of the couple's\nrelationship, necessitates the integration of men's opinions about women's status,\nautonomy, and power with women's views on those topics. Because men play an\nequally important role in the social construction of gender, men's narratives provide a\nsignificant piece of information missing from the Malawi 1 study (Note 13). In\naddition, because women's situation is primarily about male-female relationships of\npower and authority, effectively measuring concepts such as freedom of movement\nrequires a ruler against which to assess women's freedom of movement.\nThe qualitative data also revealed that men often need to ask their wives'\npermission or inform their wives before going places. Joseph, a 62-year-old man, is\nliving with his wife and five children on her family's property. He divulged why it is\nimportant for him to check in with his wife before going somewhere. \"I tell her about\neverything that I want to do. Even if I want to go and visit my friend, I tell her so that\nexpressed in the northern site are not very different. Bright is in his early-40s; he lives\nwith his wife and their four children on his family's land. He differentiated between\nneeding to `beg permission' and `informing' his wife of his comings and goings:\n[I am] not necessarily begging for permission but informing her--say I am going\nto see my friends. Then she can ask if she wants to know where I am going, to\nsee my sister or anyone. ...[I inform her] because when I go there, she knows\nthat I am going to see my sister; there is no reason for begging her permission.\n...[I go without asking permission] when I go out walking to pass hours away\nwhere I know that I would be back in a short time. But when I know I am going\nto spend a night there, I have to bid farewell. ...[I bid farewell] so that my\nspouse knows where I have gone. If I go without telling her, she would be\nFrom these excerpts, we learn that men too are constrained by needing to inform their\nwives before going places. This supplemental knowledge about the system of informing\none's spouse and the two-way restrictions on physical mobility redefines how the\nresearcher understands \"asking permission.\" For both men and women in this context,\nthe need to \"beg permission\" or \"inform\" one's spouse seems to be more about courtesy\nbetween spouses than about autonomy. Additional questions about men's movement\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 5\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n160 http://www.demographic-research.org\ncould be added to future quantitative instruments to permit a comparison between men\nand women's mobility.\nMDICP adapted the freedom of movement questions from the Status of Women\nand Fertility (SWAF) Project conducted in five Asian countries (Note 14). One reason\nthat these questions may not have worked as well in Malawi is that, in general,\nwomen's movement is not as restricted in Malawi as it is in Asia and the Middle East\n(Caldwell, Caldwell, & Quiggin 1994). In Malawi, as in many other parts of Africa,\nwomen are present in public spheres in all capacities--working as market women,\ntraveling on public transport, walking along the main roads. Although the matrilineal\nsouthern region is largely Muslim, Muslim women there are not restricted by rules of\npurdah. In both the North and the South, it is common to see women walking to and\nfrom the market, carrying children on their backs along the main roads, and gathering\nfor special programs at local maternal and child health clinics. Thus, rather than asking\nwomen if they were allowed to go to certain places alone, as the SWAF survey had, the\nMalawi 1 survey asked women if they have to get their husbands' permission to go to\nthe market and local health center. Despite the attempt to contextualize the questions, it\nseems that further contextualization and improvement are needed.\n5.7 Processes and mechanisms\nQualitative inquiry provides the opportunity to record the negotiations by which\ndecisions are made within a household rather than providing just the final result. A\ngood example of negotiation processes that the GCS data picked up has to do with the\ndifficult subject of contraceptive use. The qualitative data show that decisions about\nfamily planning use do not fall into easily defined categories such as \"woman decides,\"\n\"spouses agree,\" or \"husband decides.\"\nMen from the southern site stressed the importance of families communicating\nabout family planning before using it. Michael stated his belief by saying, \"Yes, family\nplanning is about the husband and the wife. If the wife wants to use it, she has to tell her\nhusband that she wants to use it and not do otherwise\" (6507, South 2000). When asked\nwhat a wife should do if her husband refused her request to use family planning, he\nresponded:\nIf the husband has refused, then even if the wife started using it secretly, then\nthere can't be a problem since the husband was told but he refused to give the\nwife an okay. [If the husband finds out] there it can be for the two of them\ndiscussing and agreeing what to do, but, according to my own opinion, I think\nthe husband is the one who can be wrong because, as I have already said, women\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 5\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 161\nare the ones who feel the delivery so it's at least better to consider them (6507,\nAlthough Michael continued to highlight the need to \"discuss and agree,\" he placed\nblame on the man in this scenario. His openness to a woman using family planning\nsecretly reinforces an idea that arose often in the qualitative narratives: because it is\nwomen who suffer, they should decide what is best in terms of contraceptive use.\nAlthough women are the ones who \"suffer\" during childbearing, many women do\nseek their husband's approval to use contraception. This is often a protracted process.\nAbigail, a 40-year-old woman from the southern site who has six children, claimed that\nit took her more than five years to convince her husband to let her have a tubal ligation.\nWhen she first returned from the hospital after the birth of their last child, she asked\nhim about it frequently. However, her husband wanted another child, so she \"let him do\nwhat he wanted\" (9024, South 2000). She did not actually have another child during\nthat time, however, because she \"stayed for a long time using the injection as a form of\nspacing, not to stop\" (9024, South 2000). After several years, she asked her husband\nagain whether he wanted her to become pregnant, which would have necessitated her\nstopping use of the injection; his response was, \"I will answer you later,\" postponing\nthe decision again. After years of continually bringing up the idea of tubal ligation,\nAbigail finally succeeded in convincing her husband to allow her to have the operation.\nWhen asked how she finally convinced him, she said:\nI was bored [unhappy] with his refusal and one day I told him, \"Because you\nwant me to still bear children, I am accepting what you want. But when I just\nhave a child I do not feel well.\" And, I just told him, \"Everything you want, I am\ngoing to do. But, you should know that, when I get pregnant and have a child, I\nmight die and leave a little child with you. Then you will be in trouble because\ncaring for a little child is difficult for men. I will die while thinking that I am\nIn 1998, Abigail said that she could do something if her husband did not want her to use\nfamily planning and that she could get her own way if she wanted to stop childbearing.\nClearly, although she did eventually get her own way, it took many years for her to\nconvince her husband to allow her to do so.\nThe above accounts reveal some of the ambiguities concerning negotiations about\ncontraceptive use that were not available in the survey findings. In addition, the\nqualitative data reveal the existence of other participants who are petitioned for, and\ngive advice about, childbearing and family planning use. Men and women related\ngetting information about modern methods from the radio, health-care workers, friends,\nand relatives; and this information often influenced the decision-making process. Some\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 5\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n162 http://www.demographic-research.org\nof these sources encouraged further communication between spouses, while others\nencouraged women to make decisions on their own (Note 15).\nSome respondents observed that some women are persuaded to use kulera [family\nplanning] secretly by other women, clinic workers, and relatives. One man from the\nnorthern site complained to the interviewer about this outside pressure:\nAt the clinic, they teach women that they have the right to [secretly use kulera].\nBut because this involves two partners, the husband would ask why she has\nstarted this. They need to agree to use. ...[If I found out my wife was using\nsecretly], I would criticize her on why she didn't tell me so that I should not\nwork in vain [i.e., having sex without being able to impregnate her] (141515,\nThis respondent's objection is partly attributable to the fact that a husband should be\npart of the decision-making process about contraceptive use. However, he also joked\nthat he did not want to be having sex \"in vain.\" He wanted to know when sex was\nreproductive and when it was simply recreational.\nInterestingly, a woman from the northern site told a different story about what\nwomen hear at the clinics:\nI don't know anybody [who has used secretly]; that is not what we are taught at\nthe clinic. We don't have to practice family planning secretly because your\nmarriages may end if your husbands find out. ...[My friends and I] agreed that it\nwas a good idea to tell our husbands before we do anything of this nature in\nIn this respondent's experience, the clinic workers encouraged women to tell their\nhusbands before they use family planning. She and her friends thought this was sound\nadvice that would help make their marriages stronger. This woman's survey responses\nin 1998 reflected the same sentiment: she said that she could not do anything if her\nhusband refused to let her use family planning and that she would not use family\nplanning secretly.\nWomen also told stories about seeking help in the negotiation process. In the\nnarrative of Angela, a woman from the southern site, a family planning advisor visited\nher and her husband. This advisor helped them to come to the decision as a couple to\nuse family planning:\nI started family planning in October last year ...[My husband] gave me\npermission. The family planning advisor had come to ask him what he thinks\nabout family planning. And, the advisor said we were grown people and why\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 5\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 163\ncouldn't we stop [having children]. We discussed until my husband thought that\nit was indeed better that I should rest from giving birth. ...And the advisor gave\nAngela felt that she had to get her husband's permission before using family planning.\nShe said, \"It is not right just to go without getting permission. But if he accepts, [you\ncan use it]\" (9006, South 2000). It also seems that the family planning advisor required\nher to discuss this matter with her husband before s/he would send Angela to the clinic\nwith a letter for family planning. Despite the input of the advisor, the original idea and\nimpetus for the conversation was Angela's. When asked who brought up the issue,\nAngela said, \"It was me. [My husband] did not say anything. He just accepted\" (9006,\nSouth 2000). In this case, Angela brought up the topic but relied on the outside\ninfluence of the clinic advisor to negotiate the particulars of the decision with her\nhusband. Interestingly, in 1998, Angela reported that, although she would not use\nfamily planning secretly and did not feel she could get her way if she wanted to stop\nchildbearing, she did feel as if she could do something if her husband refused to let her\nuse family planning. She also felt that she could get her way if she wanted to space her\nbirths. Here we learn that the \"something\" she could do to get her way in such a\nsituation was to involve an outsider to help negotiate.\nIt becomes clear through the qualitative data that negotiations about family\nplanning use are not straightforward, but are likely to be multi-faceted and complex.\nThe qualitative data largely support the general findings of the quantitative data on\nfamily planning decision-making. Both data sources show that women often feel that\nthey can do something if they want to use family planning--e.g., enlist the help of\noutsiders. In addition, both qualitative and quantitative data support certain differences.\nThey include that women in the southern site feel empowered to make decisions about\nboth spacing births and stopping childbearing, whereas women in the northern site are\nmore likely to claim a right to making decisions about spacing than about stopping.\nFinally, both data sources support the idea that secret use is a real and viable choice for\nmany, but not all, women when other strategies do not work. Each data source has one\nadvantage that the other does not. The qualitative data complement and supplement the\nquantitative data by providing narratives of the processes by which certain decisions are\nmade. The narratives illuminate the multi-staged, often protracted, negotiations between\nspouses as well as the negotiations that involve other participants who influence\ndecisions about family planning use. The quantitative data facilitate examining\ncorrelations between those concepts and reproductive behavior at the aggregate level,\nwhich is difficult to accomplish with the qualitative data alone.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 5\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n164 http://www.demographic-research.org\n6. Conclusions: using qualitative data to ask better quantitative\nquestions\nDemographers are interested in modeling the relationship between women's situation\nand fertility-related behavior. Current demographic research attempts to measure\nwomen's situation by quantifying concepts such as status, autonomy, and\nempowerment. Transforming these abstract concepts into concrete survey questions\nwith quantifiable responses is perhaps the most daunting task before demographers.\nEthnographic data are an underused resource. By nesting the GCS qualitative work in\nsurvey research, I retained the breadth and generalizability of the Malawi 1 survey data,\nbut gained rich nuanced information about gender and context in rural Malawi. In my\ncase study, the qualitative data supplement, but do not replace, the quantitative results. I\nhave shown that one can use the qualitative data to compare findings, contextualize\nresults, and help to conceptualize women's situation in the rural Malawian context.\nThe Malawi 1 survey questions, to be useful for statistical analysis, necessarily\nconstrained the type and number of responses that a respondent could give to a\nquestion. In the semi-structured interviews, however, respondents were able to talk\nfreely about the Malawi 1 survey gender module topics as well as about a number of\nother issues associated with the local gender context. The respondents could emphasize\nthe aspects of those subjects that were most relevant to their own lives rather than have\nthe quantitative researcher presuppose appropriate measures of women's status,\nautonomy, and power. Although not the only goal, the qualitative data can help\ndemographers to find ways in which to improve the survey instrument in future\niterations.\nThroughout this paper, I have referred to a few ways in which the gender module\nof the Malawi 1 survey could be improved. The concept of women's freedom of\nmovement in the Malawian settings would be better-specified in two ways. First, to\ncontrol for differences in community layout and kin structure, there should be\nadditional questions that measure the distance to the market/health center and kin's\nability to monitor women's mobility. Second, the questions should refer to the last time\nthe respondent went to the market/health center and should ask for the factors that led to\nthe decision to ask permission or not; these should replace the more-generic questions\nAdding questions about women's situation to men's questionnaires is another way\nto improve what we can learn from survey data. This may be in the form of asking men\nabout their opinions of women's behavior and gender norms. It can also extend to\nasking men about their own behavior - e.g., their freedom of movement - to serve as a\nruler against which to measure women's comparative status, autonomy, and\nempowerment.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 5\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 165\nThe family planning decision-making survey questions seemed to parallel what we\nlearned through the qualitative narratives. One improvement to these questions,\nhowever, would be to somehow include other possible sources of influence and\nintervention in the decision-making process, recognizing that men and women do not\nmake these decisions in a vacuum. It is important to recognize the limitation of the\nscope of these questions and to continue to collect qualitative narratives to contextualize\nand complement them.\nAnother important issue that the qualitative data raised that I have yet to discuss\nhas to do with questions that allowed for respondent interpretation of meaning. For\nexample, the qualitative data revealed that responses to at least one of the divorce\nquestions may have depended on how respondents interpreted the question. In 1998,\nonly about a quarter of the women reported that it was permissible to leave a man who\ndid not support his family financially (see Table 2 above). Nevertheless, nearly all of\nthe female, and many of the male, respondents mentioned this reason for divorce\nspontaneously during the in-depth interviews in 2000. The difference may have\nreflected interpretation. In 2000, women said they would tolerate a man who actively\nsought an income, but found none, but that a man who squandered the family's money\non beer and girlfriends could be divorced. It is unclear whether all respondents\nunderstood this question in the same way in 1998. To be sure that all respondents\ninterpret such a question in the same way in the future, it may be better to ask a series of\nquestions: 1) Can a woman divorce a husband who is unable to find an income? 2) Can\na woman divorce a husband who has squandered the family's money on beer? Finally,\n3) Can a woman divorce a husband who has squandered the family's money on\ngirlfriends?\nAlthough not the focus of this paper, one way in which qualitative data can\nimprove the survey is by adding new questions on emergent themes--inductive\nqualitative inquiry can reveal new topics of research on women's situation. These open-\nended responses from narratives can lead researchers to unanticipated answers,\nunderstanding, and further questions. The qualitative data may also illuminate concepts\nand areas of women's situation that are too complex to be measured by fixed-answer\nsurvey questions. Moreover, they may shed light on new topics associated with\nwomen's situation that will better-capture this concept and its relationship to\nreproductive health outcomes.\nIt is crucial for demographers to use qualitative data to improve the quantitative\ninstrument rather than as a stand-alone data source. Just as the quantitative data may be\ninsufficient in certain areas, qualitative data alone cannot answer demographers'\nquestions about women's situation and its relationship to fertility behavior. Although\nqualitative data provide a more-nuanced picture of women's situation, and may even be\n\"more accurate\" in certain ways than the quantitative data, qualitative data are also\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 5\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n166 http://www.demographic-research.org\nsomewhat intractable. It is much-more difficult to try to correlate qualitative measures\nof autonomy to reproductive outcomes than to do so with survey data. In addition, the\nsmall \"n\" of qualitative data does limit the macro-level processes one can explore.\nThus, to get a full, rich picture of women's situation and its relationship to reproductive\nbehavior, it is necessary to integrate the two data sources while recognizing the\nweaknesses and exploiting the strengths of each.\n7.
