It traces the development of the application of the log-linear distance\nmodel to the study of homophily and reviews its recent use to assess the extent and structure of gender and age homophily\nin groups of criminal accomplices (`co-offenders'). The transformations of the group membership data that are a prerequisite\nof the log-linear analysis, and the interpretation of the log-linear parameters, are explained in detail in order to make the\napproach accessible to potential users. Although the described applications are to gender and age homophily in groups of\ncriminal accomplices, the method can be used to assess homophily on one or more variables in any small groups.\n",

Recently, the log-linear distance\nmodel has been used innovatively to model homophily on\nordinal and dichotomous variables in small groups of crimi-\nmethods are equally applicable to any small groups.Although\nthe methods are introduced in the cited sources, their expla-\nnation of the methods is very brief. This article explains the\nmethods in detail. It discusses the conceptualisation and\noperationalisation of homophily, traces the development of\nthe application of the log-linear distance model to homophily\nand its advantages over the well-known Coleman index,\nshows how it can be applied to small groups and reviews the\nresults are reported: the purpose of this article is to put the\nrecent applications in conceptual and historical context and\nto make the model accessible to potential users.\nConceptualising homophily\nHomophily has been defined as `the principle that a contact\nbetween similar people occurs at a higher rate than among\nal. (1995) characterise homophily as `the social distance\ninteraction hypothesis': `The frequency with which people\nenter into face-to-face association (contact, interaction) is\ninversely related to the social distance between them' (p. 20).\nThus, according to the principle, or hypothesis, of homophily,\nthe highest rate of interaction is expected between people\nwho are in the same category of a discrete variable (e.g. both\nmale) or who have the same value on a continuous variable\n(e.g. same age), that is, whose social distance is zero.\nAs the definition of McPherson et al. (2001) implies, the\nphenomenon of observed homophily, or homogeneity in\nsocial relationships, does not in itself imply any particular\nexplanation. In particular, it is not necessarily due to personal\nhomophily generally fall into three categories:\n1. Population composition: This might be characterised\nas the `null' hypothesis. The selection of interaction\npartners is influenced simply by the availability of\npotential partners. If partners are selected at random,\nthen their characteristics will reflect the distribution of\nthose characteristics in the population or pool of poten-\ntial partners. If the population is distributed unevenly\nover categories or values of some attribute, then\nLog-linear distance models of homophily in\nsmall groups\nPeter J Carrington\n Keywords\nLog-linear, distance model, homophily, co-offending\nDepartment of Sociology and Legal Studies, University of Waterloo,\nWaterloo, ON, Canada\nCorresponding author:\nPeter J Carrington, Department of Sociology and Legal Studies, University\nof Waterloo, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.\nEmail: pjc@uwaterloo.ca\nOriginal Article\n2 Methodological Innovations\n\u00ad assuming random selection of partners \u00admembers of\nthe numerical majority group(s) will be more likely to\nselect similar partners, and homophily will be observed\nthis as baseline homophily. For example, because the\ngreat majority of criminals are male, random (i.e. gen-\nder-blind) selection of accomplices would, ceteris\nparibus, produce a high proportion of homophilous\nmale co-offending groups (and a smaller number of\nmixed-gender and all-female groups), and that is pre-\ncisely what has been observed in numerous studies of\nco-offending (van Mastrigt and Carrington, 2014).\n2. Preference: For various reasons, people prefer to\nassociate and collaborate with those who are similar\nto them. According to McPherson et al. (2001), `the\npsychology literature has demonstrated experimen-\ntally that attraction is affected by perceived similarity\n...'(p. 435). Similarly, in the area of professional col-\nlaboration, Steffensmeier and Terry (1986) concluded\non the basis of interviews with male thieves that they\npreferred same-gender accomplices because they\nwere perceived as more reliable and trustworthy.\n3. Social structure: Features of the social structure\napart from overall population composition may con-\nstitute `opportunity structures' that favour homo-\nphilous contact and collaboration. For example,\nMcPherson et al. (2001) point out that `organiza-\ntional foci', such as neighbourhood play groups,\nschools, workplaces and voluntary organisations,\nbring together people who are similar in age, ethnic-\nity, socioeconomic status and sometimes gender\ngence settings', where local youth `hang out' and\nhave the opportunity to meet and screen potential\ncriminal accomplices. Such `opportunity [to meet\nand screen] structures' are often partly or entirely\nsegregated by age, gender, ethnicity and so on, thus\nrestricting the pools of potential partners to similar\nothers (reviewed in van Mastrigt and Carrington,\n2014) have noted that it is the `local' availability\nand accessibility of potential criminal partners,\nrather than their distribution in the larger popula-\ntion, that affect partner selection and that local\navailability and accessibility are structured by social\nnetworks based on family, friendship, neighbour-\nhood and so on. Pettersson (2003) shows that resi-\ndential ethnic segregation leads to ethnic segregation\n(homophily) in co-offending, although individual\npreferences may tend towards ethnic heterogeneity.\nAs the `baseline' homophily that can be accounted for by\nrandom selection and population composition is often of lit-\ntle theoretical or substantive interest,2 some researchers\nrestrict the definition and study of homophily to that which\nexceeds expectations under random selection \u00ad sometimes\ntermed inbreeding bias or inbreeding homophily (Coleman\nAppendix B) conceptualises homophily in sociometric\nchoices as the extent to which the number of actual choices\nof persons in the same category as the chooser exceeds the\nnumber expected under random selection. Coleman's (1958:\n36) index of homophily is category-specific\nh\na e\nm e\ni\nii ii\ni ii\n=\n-\n( )\n-\nwhere hi\nis the (inbreeding) homophily of persons in cate-\ngory i, aii\nis the number of same-category choices made by\nmembers of category i, mi\nis the total number of choices\nmade by persons in category i and eii\nis the expected number\nof same-category choices by persons in category i, under\nrandom selection, which is equal to mi\nmultiplied by the pro-\nportion of persons of category i in the population.\nLimitations of the Coleman index\nAlthough the Coleman index of inbreeding homophily has\nbeen used extensively (for recent applications, see, for exam-\nMastrigt and Carrington, 2014), it has several limitations:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 It is based on a binary conceptualisation of similarity:\npersons chosen are either of the same category or not.\nThis can be seen in formula (1). Therefore, its applica-\ntion is limited to dichotomous variables or to polyto-\nmous variables that can be analysed as dichotomies.\nThe notion of social distance \u00ad other than `same/dif-\nferent' \u00ad is unknown.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The estimate of homophily that it produces is cate-\ngory-specific. No overall estimate of homophily in the\npopulation is available.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Its sampling distribution is unknown, so there is no\nknown standard error and therefore no inferential sta-\ntistics such as confidence intervals or significance\ntests.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 It is not readily incorporated into a multivariate model,\nin which, for example, homophily can be assessed\nwhile controlling other relevant variables.\nThe log-linear distance model\nThe limitations of the Coleman index of homophily do not\napply to the log-linear distance model. It applies to ordinal\n(and dichotomous) variables, it has a well-understood sam-\npling distribution and therefore a standard error, from which\nconfidence intervals and significance tests can be derived,\nCarrington 3\nand it is part of the statistically well-developed and well-\nunderstood log-linear model and, more generally, of the gen-\nThe simplest log-linear distance model is applied to a\nsquare cross-tabulation H(i, j) of pair-wise interactions, or\ndyads, in which the rows and columns represent the catego-\nries of the same ordinal (or dichotomous) attribute, and the\ncells (i, j) contain counts of the number of dyads comprising\nan actor in category i and an actor in category j. The model\ncan be written as\nlog \u00b5\nij ij\nd\n= + + +\n   \ni\nX\nj\nwhere \u00b5ij\nis the count (i.e. frequency of dyads) in cell (i, j), X\nis the row and column variable, indexed by i (rows) and j\n(columns) and d i j\n= | |.\n-\nLike all conventional log-linear models for two-way\ntables, the distance model includes an intercept parameter ,\nparameterising the overall frequency,3 and row and column\nparameters \ni\nX and \nj\nX  parameterising the overall (marginal)\nfrequency of each row and column, thus capturing the effects\nof population composition on interaction frequencies (Agresti,\nparameter , which captures the effect of social distance: in\nthis case, the distance \u00ad that is, difference \u00ad between catego-\nries of the variable.Thus, the  parameter captures the strength\nand direction of the association between attribute-based social\ndistance and the frequency of interactions while controlling\nfor population composition. Inbreeding homophily is indi-\ncated by cell counts that decrease for cells at increasing dis-\ntances from the main diagonal of the cross-tabulation. As the\ndij\nterm measures the distance between categories i and j, a\npositive estimate of  indicates that cell frequencies increase\nwith increasing differences between i and j \u00ad that is, heteroph-\nily \u00ad and a negative estimate indicates homophily.\nDevelopment\nThe log-linear distance model was introduced by Goodman\nHaberman, 1974)5 for square ordinal social mobility tables,\nin which cell counts (i, j) indicate the number of father\u00adson\ndyads for which father is in the ith occupational class and son\nis in the jth occupational class. Cells on the main diagonal \u00ad\nwhere i=j and father and son are in the same occupational\nclass \u00ad indicate social immobility (`status inheritance'; i.e.\ninheritance by a son of his father's occupational class); cells\nat increasing distances from the main diagonal indicate\nincreasing amounts of upward or downward social mobility.\nThe  parameter (in model 2 above) captures the strength of\nthe association between the number of occupational classes\n(|i-j|) separating father and son and the number of father\u00ad\nson dyads in cell (i, j), that is, the extent to which social\nmobility exceeds expectations based on random placement\nof sons in occupational classes.\nMarsden (1988) applied the log-linear distance model to\nanalyse homophily in personal networks. The 1985American\nGeneral Social Survey captured data on the characteristics of\nup to five persons with whom respondent `discussed impor-\ntant matters'. Marsden (1988) transformed the data into (up\nto) five respondent\u00adalter dyads for each respondent and then\nconstructed cross-tabulations \u00ad on age, education, race/eth-\nnicity, religion and gender \u00ad with rows representing respond-\nents, columns representing alters and counts of dyads in the\ncells. Various forms of the log-linear distance model were\napplied to these cross-tabulations in order to assess the\namount and structure of homophily on each attribute of\nrespondents' choices of discussion partners.\nExtension to small groups\nThe log-linear distance model applies to a cross-tabulation of\ndyadic interactions: the categories of the variable to which the\ntwo members of the dyad belong are indexed in the rows and\ncolumns of the cross-tabulation. Therefore, it is inapplicable to\ninteractions involving more than two actors and therefore to\ngroups of more than two members.6 However, any `small' or\n`face-to-face' group incorporates a set of dyadic, or pair-wise,\ninteractions or relationships: a group of size n generates\nenon is limited to `small' groups because in larger groups it is\nunrealistic to assume that all members interact with all other\nwrites, in justifying the omission of larger groups from a study\nof social versus spatial distance in criminal collaborations,\nThe assumption is made that individuals who were part of the\nsame offense [i.e. co-offending group] had a social relationship.\nTwo offenses were dropped from the data because they had such\na high number of participants (23 and 54) that they likely\nviolated this assumption. (p. 143)\nStegbauer and Rausch (2012) showed how lists of the\nmembers of a set of small groups of varying sizes can be\nused to generate a cross-tabulation of co-participating\ndyads, without knowledge of the identities of the members.\nSpecifically, they transformed a list of the nationalities of\nthe co-participants in a set of events (namely, sessions at an\nacademic conference) into a set of co-participating dyads,\nlabelled by the nationalities of the members, which in turn\nwere used to generate a cross-tabulation of the frequencies\nwith which people of different (and the same) nationalities\nco-participated in conference sessions. As nationality is a\npolytomous nominal variable, the concept of social distance\nwas inapplicable, as was the log-linear distance model.\nCarrington (2015b) extended the method of Stegbauer and\nRausch (2012) to analyse age homophily among co-offenders\n(accomplices in crimes) apprehended by police in connection\nwith all recorded co-offences in Canadian police during 2006\u00ad\n4 Methodological Innovations\nbegan with information on one characteristic of each of the\nco-participants in a set of events: specifically, the age in years\nof each of the offenders. The distance model was particularly\nappropriate because age (unlike nationality in the research of\nStegbauer and Rausch, 2012) is an ordered attribute and was\ncoded in the data as an ordinal variable, with values from 3 to\n88years. The co-offences in the data ranged in size (i.e. number\nof recorded participants) from 2 to 44 co-offenders, but the\ngreat majority had only 2 or 3 co-offenders.\nFollowing the method of Stegbauer and Rausch (2012),\nCarrington (2015b) created a square symmetric cross-tabula-\ntion with 86 rows and columns, representing ages from 3 to 88\ninclusive. Cell counts (i, j) indicated the number of co-offend-\ning dyads in which a person aged i+2 co-offended with a per-\nson aged j+2. Formally, the age-by-age co-offending matrix is\nH = ( )\n=\nh\ni j\nij\n, :\n,\nfor\ns ,\n,and\nthenumberof co-offendingdyads\nwhosemembershave\nh h\nij ji\n= =\na\ni j\n+ +\nThe matrix H was constructed from the individual co-\noffences, which were transformed into a weighted incidence\nmatrix M\nM = ( )\n=\n=\nm\ni\nj\nij\n,\n, ,\n,\nfor:\ni\nicipations\nthenumber of partici\n,\nm\nij\n= p\npationsin\nco-offence of offendersof age 2\ni j +\nFor example, Figure 1(a) shows three hypothetical co-\noffences labelled A, B and C, involving nine co-offenders\naged 3\u00ad7years. The first co-offence has five co-offenders, of\nwhom two are 3years old, and one each is 5, 6 and 7years\nold. This co-offence comprises 10 co-offending dyads: Jack\u00ad\nJoe, Jack\u00adHarry, Jack\u00adWalter, Jack\u00adMac, Joe\u00adHarry and so\non The second and third co-offences have only two co-\noffenders each and therefore comprise only one co-offending\ndyad each; in the second, they are both 4years old, and in the\nthird, they are 5 and 6years old. Figure 1(b) shows the result-\ning rows of the incidence matrix M.\nFigure 1. Transformation of co-offending data into an age-by-age matrix: (a) co-offending data, (b) weighted incidence matrix M, (c)\nweighted adjacency matrix MTM and (d) weighted adjacency matrix with corrected cell counts H.\nTotal dyad count=12.\nCarrington 5\nWhen M is pre-multiplied by its transpose, the result is a\nsquare matrix MTM (Figure 1(c)), showing the number of\ntimes that offenders of age i+2 co-offended with offenders\nof age j\n+\n2; for example, in the example in Figure 1, two\n3-year-olds co-offended with one 5-year-old in co-offence A\nand none in co-offence B or C, so the value for MTM1,3\n(and\n) is 2. This adjacency matrix is symmetric, so the\nupper (or lower) triangle is redundant. However, the diago-\nnal cells of MTM (shaded in Figure 1(c)) have incorrect val-\nues of 4, 4, 2, 2, 1 for numbers of co-offences between\noffenders of the same age. Stegbauer and Rausch (2012: 4)\ncorrect the diagonal entries with the formula\nh\nm m\nij\nk ki kj\n=\n -\n( )\n( )\nfor = and =1,\ni j k s\n,\nwhere s is the number of rows in M, which in the example\ngives the correct diagonal entries of 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 (Figure 1(d)),\nindicating the single co-offence between 3-year-olds (in co-\noffence A; see Figure 1(a)) and between 4-year-olds (in co-\noffence B) and no same-age co-offences between 5-, 6- and\n7-year-olds. A further correction was required in the\nCarrington (2015b) research, as the log-linear models were\napplied to the entire symmetric matrix, unlike the analysis in\nStegbauer and Rausch (2012), where only the lower triangle\nwas analysed. In MTM, each off-diagonal dyad is double-\ncounted: once in the lower triangle and once in the upper\ntriangle. In order to eliminate the double-counting, the modi-\nfied formula used by Carrington (2015b) also divides the off-\ndiagonal cell counts by 2\nh\nm m\nij\nk ki kj\n=\n\n( )\n\n\nfor and = 1,\ni j k s\n,\nwhere s is the number of rows in M, giving the cell counts\nshown in Figure 1(d), which sum to the correct total of 10 dyads.\nThe age-by-age matrix H in Carrington (2015b) contains\noffenders are of the same age in years (i.e. on the main diago-\nnal) and 793,581 dyads involving offenders of different ages.\nThe distribution of ages of co-offending dyads is strongly\naffected by the row and column marginals \u00ad that is, the num-\nbers of co-offenders of each year of age \u00ad which range from\ninclude a 19-year-old. The effect of population composition\n- that is, the row and column marginal effects - can be\nremoved by taking the normalized residuals from the log-\nlog \u00b5\nij\n= + +\n  \ni\nX\nj\nwhere \u00b5ij\nis the count (i.e. frequency of interactions) in cell (i,\nj) and X is the row and column variable, indexed by i and j.\nThe marginals can be plotted in an age-by-age matrix\n(Figure 2). In Figure 2, the density of the shading of cells is\nproportional to the normalised residual. As predicted by the\nhomophily hypothesis, co-offending is greater than expected\n(from population composition) on and near the main diagonal\n(red cells) and less than expected off the diagonal (green cells).\nThis is confirmed by the distance parameter estimate  from\nthe log-linear distance model (formula (2)), which was\n=\nnegative and statistically significant (Carrington, 2015b:\nFurther hypotheses based on age-by-age cross-tabulation\nwere tested in Carrington (2015b), primarily concerning var-\niations in homophily with co-offenders' ages \u00ad which can be\nseen in Figure 2, where homophily appears to be stronger\namong teenagers and children and practically non-existent\namong older co-offenders. This phenomenon was modelled\nby the `variable distance' model, which allows the effect of\nsocial distance to vary\nlog +\n\u00b5\nij ij ij ij\nd d s\n= + + +\n    \ni\nX\nj\nX\nwhere d=|i-j| and s=i+j (Carrington, 2015b: formula 2,\nparameter represents an interaction between het-\nerophily and age; a positive estimate for 2\nindicates that age\nheterophily increases \u00ad that is, age homophily decreases \u00ad\nwith an increase in the sum of the ages of the members of the\ndyad. Carrington (2015b) also tested hypotheses and models\nthat added social distance based on age groups to distance\nbased on year of age. The concept of `age group' and models\nfor it are discussed in the following section.\nExtension to two variables\nCarrington (2015a) extended the approach of Carrington\n(2015b) to model homophily on two variables (gender and\nage) simultaneously. Homophily on each variable was esti-\nmated while controlling for homophily on the other variable\n(as well as for population composition), and the interaction\nbetween homophily on the two variables was estimated: that\nis, whether or not co-offending between occupants of certain\npairs of categories of the two variables occurred more or less\nfrequently than expected on the basis of homophily on each\nof the variables individually.\nCarrington (2015a) used the same data as Carrington\nto have at least 10 female co-offenders for each year of age.\nThe result was a reduction to 968,712 co-offending dyads. As\nthe dyads were transformed into a cross-tabulation, but in this\ncase it was a four-dimensional 71 \u00d7 71 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 cross-tabulation\nby age and gender simultaneously: H=(hijkl\n), in which each\ncell hijkl\nis a count of the number of dyads in which the age of\nthe first member is indexed by i and his or her gender by k, and\nthe age of the other member is indexed by j and his or her\ngender by l. Formally, the cross-tabulation is denoted by\n6 Methodological Innovations\nH = h\nijkl\n( )\nl={1, 2}, labelled by {`Male', `Female'}; and hijkl\n=hjilk\nthe\nnumber of co-offending dyads whose members have the\nages indexed by i and j and genders indexed by k and l.\nTo transform the individual co-offending groups into\ndyads, they were first transformed into two weighted inci-\ndence matrices M and F, for male and female co-offenders\nM = m\nij\n( )\n... , 71}, indexing participations of male offenders with ages\n\n=\nthe number of participations in co-\noffence i of male offenders of age j.\nF = f\nij\n( ),\n... , 71}, indexing participations of female offenders with\n= the number of participations in co-\noffence i of female offenders of age j.\nFor example, Figure 3(a) shows three co-offences labelled\nA, B and C, involving nine co-offenders aged 5\u00ad9years. The\nfirst co-offence has five co-offenders, all male, of whom two\nare 5years old and one each is 7, 8 and 9years old. This co-\noffence generates 10 co-offending dyads. The second and\nthird co-offences have only two co-offenders each and gen-\nerate one dyad each; in the second co-offence, they are both\nyears old and of different genders, and in the third co-\noffence, they are 7 and 8years old and of different genders.\nFigure 3(b) shows the resulting incidence matrices M and F.\nWhen M is pre-multiplied by its transpose, the result is a\nsquare adjacency matrix MTM (Figure 3(c)), showing the\nnumber of times that male offenders of age i co-offended\nwith male offenders of age j; for example, in the example in\nFigure 3, two 5-year-old males co-offended with one 7-year-\nold male in co-offence A and none in co-offence B or C, so\nthe value for MTM1,3\n) is 2. However, the\ndiagonal cells of MTM (shaded in Figure 3(c)) have incorrect\nvalues of 4, 1, 1, 2, 1 for numbers of co-offences between\nmale offenders of the same age.

In MTM,\neach off-diagonal dyad is double-counted: once in the lower\ntriangle and once in the upper triangle. In order to eliminate\nthe double-counting and preserve the correct total number of\nco-offending dyads, the modified formula also divides the\noff-diagonal cell counts by 2\n =\n\n( )\n\n\nm\nm m\nij\nki kj\nk\ni j k s\n\nwhere s is the number of rows in M, resulting in the\nmale*male slice of H, or H11\n), where the last two sub-\nscripts, 1 and 1, index male gender (Figure 3(d)).\nThe same procedure was followed to produce the\nfemale*female co-offending adjacency matrix H22\n)\nand the male*female co-offending matrix H12\n) and its\ntranspose, the female*male co-offending matrix H21\n)\n(Figure 3(c) and (d)).\nwas then reduced to a 3\u00d73\u00d72\u00d72 cross-tabulation by aggre-\ngating years of age into age statuses, which Carrington\n(2015a) argues are more sociologically and criminologically\nrelevant than merely chronological years of age or the ad hoc\ngroupings of ages into `age groups' in Carrington (2015b).\nFollowing Burt (1991), dyadic co-offending frequencies\nwere row- and column-normalised using iterative propor-\ntional fitting (IPF),8 in order to remove the effects of varying\nvolumes of co-offending by members of different year-of-age\ngroups. Distances (dissimilarities) between the co-offending\npatterns of each pair of years-of-age were calculated as\nthe Euclidean distance between the corresponding pair\nof rows (or, equivalently, columns) in the two-dimensional\n\u00d7\nyear-of-age by year-of-age cross-tabulation of\nFigure 3.

Two\nmethods were used to cluster the years of age in the resulting\n71\u00d771 distance matrix: visual examination of a multidimen-\nsional scaling (MDS) plot and Ward's hierarchical agglom-\nerative clustering method.9 For Ward's clustering, the choice\nof the number of clusters was assisted by plots of the pseudo-\nF statistic and pseudo-t2 statistic against the number of clus-\nters (Cooper and Milligan, 1988).

The estimate for the interaction between gender\nthat dyads comprising a young female and an adult male are\nmore frequent than expected from the main effects of gender\nand age, that is, gender and age status homophily are mutu-\nally attenuating, not reinforcing (Carrington, 2015a).\nLimitations\nThe log-linear model of homophily in groups is a `dyad-inde-\npendent' model that assumes there are no connections\nbetween groups (Handcock et al., 2008). Where data are\navailable on connections between groups \u00ad that is, if informa-\ntion is available on the presence of the same persons in two or\nmore groups \u00ad then a model such as the exponential random\ngraph model (ERGM) is, in principle, more appropriate\nbecause it can estimate homophily (using the same underly-\ning distance model) while controlling for network effects\ntations to the size of population that can be modelled with an\nERGM (Robins and Lusher, 2013), whereas the approach\ndescribed here is insensitive to population size, as the nodes\nare aggregated into categories of the classificatory variable.\nThe log-linear distance model also has the limitation that\nthe transformation of groups into dyads, preparatory to con-\nstruction of the cross-tabulation required by the log-linear\nmodel, loses information about group size. As homophily\nhas been found to be related to group size (McPherson et al.,\n2014), this may be an issue in some applications.\nConclusion\nThe log-linear distance model is a powerful and flexible\nway of modelling inbreeding homophily in small discon-\nnected groups on attributes measured with ordinal or dichot-\nomous variables. It brings the modelling of homophily into\nthe overall family of log-linear models, whose statistical\nproperties are well-known and whose parameterizations are\nextremely flexible and therefore readily adaptable to the\ntesting of specific hypotheses. In order to apply the log-\nlinear model to data on group memberships, the list of the\nmembers of each group must first be converted to a cross-\ntabulation of dyadic relationships, following the method of\nStegbauer and Rausch (2012). Examples of the use of the\nlog-linear distance model to assess age and gender homoph-\nily in co-offending groups are provided in recent work by\n"
