We will examine whether tall men are\nmore satisfied with their relationship, less prone to jealousy and whether male height is\nassociated with the use of mate retention behaviors.\nMale height, quality, and attractiveness\nMale height provides a clear indication of mate quality and health (Silventoinen,\nLahelma, and Rahkonen, 1999), with only high quality men able to allocate the resources\nrequired to develop their stature. In addition, research has demonstrated that male height is\nassociated with established indicators of genetic quality such as fluctuating asymmetry\nHeight, satisfaction, jealousy, retention\n(Manning, 1995) and self-reported physical health (Samaras and Elrick, 1999). Height may\nalso indicate a man's status relative to other men, for example tall men are perceived as\nmore dominant and assertive than shorter men (Melamed, 1992). In part, this perception\nmay reflect the fact that the higher levels of testosterone associated with male height (Heald\net al., 2003) also results in other observable features associated with dominance such as a\nprominent jaw and brow ridge (Enlow, 1990). Male stature may also signal the possession\nof desirable non physical qualities. For example, male height is associated with\nsocioeconomic status and access to resources (Judge and Cable, 2004; Peck and Lundberg,\nAs a consequence of the physical and non-physical qualities associated with male\nstature, tall men experience a number of reproductive advantages. Stature is an important\nelement of male attractiveness (Pawlowski and Koziel, 2002) and women are most\nattracted to tall men (Kurzban and Weeden, 2002; Pawlowski and Jasienska, 2005). In fact\nboth men and women (at least in Western post-industrial societies) report a desire for\nrelationships in which the man is taller (Gillis and Avis, 1980). Consequently, tall men\nreceive more responses to `lonely hearts' column advertisements (Lynn and Shurgot, 1984)\nand women report dating tall men more frequently than short men (Shepperd and\nStrathman, 1989). The average number of dates for men one standard deviation above the\nmean was twice that of men one standard deviation below the mean. Tall men also obtain\nmore attractive partners (Feingold, 1982) are less likely to be childless (Nettle, 2002) and\nhave a greater number of children (Mueller and Mazur, 2001) than their shorter rivals. The\nincreased reproductive success of tall men may reflect the greater likelihood that tall men\nobtain a second or subsequent wife. As height can be a cue to a man's ability to provide\nprotection and resources or a cue to heritable fitness (Silventoinen, Kapiro, Lahelma,\nViken, and Rose 2001; Schousboe et al., 2004) there are a number of reproductive\nadvantages afforded to women that select tall mates.\nCuckoldry and reproductive success\nThe female preference for tall partners may present an increased risk of desertion or\ncuckoldry (paternity by another male) to shorter men. The mixed mating or dual strategy\nhypothesis (Gangestad and Simpson, 2000) suggests that women may cuckold their long\nterm partner by mating with a man that has a high genetic quality (in order to produce high\nquality offspring) whilst retaining the resources of their primary (lower quality) partner.\nWhilst cuckoldry represents a substantial problem for all men (Baker and Bellis, 1995;\nPlatek and Shackelford, 2006), it may be of greater concern for short men. Women unable\nto secure the most desirable (i.e. tall) partner for a long term relationship could adopt a dual\nstrategy, retaining the investment of a less attractive (i.e. short) man whilst engaging in\nextra pair copulations with a more desirable (i.e. tall) man.\nExtra pair copulations with tall men would be less beneficial for women in a long\nterm relationship with a tall as opposed to a short man. The relative difference between the\nattractiveness of the long term and extra pair partners would be lower for these women and\nthe quality of the partner lost (if the extra pair copulation were discovered and\nabandonment followed) would be greater. The suggestion that short men may are at most\nrisk of cuckoldry is supported by the finding that the female preference for tall men is\nheightened when selecting a man for a short term relationship or during the fertile phase of\nthe menstrual cycle (Pawlowski and Koziel, 2002) and the greater jealousy of less attractive\nHeight, satisfaction, jealousy, retention\nmen when their partner is most fertile (Haselton and Gangestad, 2006). This is also\nconsistent with other research indicating that women paired to low quality males are most\nlikely to seek extra-pair relationships with higher quality men (Waynforth, 1998).\nIn addition, short men may have greater difficulty increasing their reproductive\nsuccess through short term or extra pair matings than tall men and be most likely to restrict\ntheir reproductive output to the level of their long term partner. The greater reliance on the\nsuccess of a long term relationship for lifetime reproductive success further highlights the\nthreat that cuckoldry or relationship dissolution poses for short men. This may be further\nexacerbated by a greater difficulty attracting a new partner as suggested by the female\npreference for tall mates (Pawlowski and Jasienska, 2005). Consequently, being sensitive to\nthe threat that cuckoldry and desertion presents and investing in mate retention may be of\nmost benefit to short men.\nJealousy and mate retention\nJealousy is often perceived as a negative emotion (Buunk and Bringle, 1987) and\nhas been related to a range of destructive events or behaviors such as domestic violence and\nmarital problems (Aronson and Pines, 1980; Barnett, Martinez, and Bluestein, 1995).\nJealousy however, may serve a number of adaptive functions (Buss, 2000). The elicitation\nof jealousy allows an individual to identify those individuals or circumstances that present\nthe greatest threat to their relationship. Importantly, the identification of a specific threat\nmay promote the use of mate retention behaviors intended to strengthen the pair bond or\ndeter rivals (Buunk, Massar, and Dijkstra, 2007). Jealousy therefore has the potential to\nreduce desertion or cuckoldry and promote reproductive success if elicited by an\nappropriate threat. In addition, it has been suggested that jealousy protects and promotes\na partner's jealousy could be interpreted as a sign of caring, promoting a belief that the\npartner is committed and ready to invest in a long term relationship. Alternatively,\nindividuals that believe their partner is desired by others (and respond jealously to a\npotential rival) may raise their perceptions of the partner's mate value or attractiveness,\nincreasing their attraction to their partner. The level of jealousy experienced may reflect the\nlevel of threat. For example, men that are concerned with their partner's jealousy\nexperience more jealousy when the rival is attractive (Maner, Miller, Rouby, and Gailliot,\nIn this context, Buunk, Park, Zurriaga, Klavina and Massar (2008) demonstrate that\ntall men are less jealous than short men. Specifically, tall men are less jealous than short\nmen when faced with the prospect of a physically attractive and dominant rival. This\nresearch made an important contribution to the field, demonstrating that male height is\nrelated to romantic jealousy and that these responses can be elicited in response to\nhypothetical scenarios. The present study investigates the relationship between height and\njealousy further, and considers the manner in which male height is related to three jealousy\ndimensions. Pfeiffer and Wong (1989) identify three jealousy dimensions: emotional\njealousy which concerns how a person responds to potentially provoking situations;\ncognitive jealousy which comprises of the individual's appraisal of a situation and\nbehavioral jealousy which includes a range of behaviors intended to reduce a specific\nthreat.\nHeight, satisfaction, jealousy, retention\nThe current study and predictions\nWe predicted that the potential threats to lifetime reproductive success experienced\nby short men (outlined above) would result in greater suspicion or concern (cognitive\njealousy), efforts to minimize the threat (behavioral jealousy) and reaction to events that\nthreaten the relationship (emotional jealousy). Based on their relatively high attractiveness,\nincreased ability to obtain high quality mates and hypothesized lower risk of cuckoldry or\ndesertion, we also predicted that tall men would report higher levels of relationship\nsatisfaction than shorter men. To explore the relationship between height and behaviors that\nmay minimize the risk of cuckoldry or desertion further, we considered a range of mate\nretention behaviors (Buss, Shackelford and McKibbin, 2008). These included behaviors\nintended to deter potential rivals and those expected to increase a partner's desire to remain\nin the current relationship.\nTherefore, the current study extends previous research in this area beyond initial\nattraction (e.g. Pawlowski and Koziel, 2002) or reproductive success (e.g. Mueller and\nMazur, 2001) to the dynamics within a relationship. In particular, the research explores the\nextent to which male height is associated with relationship satisfaction, jealousy and mate\nretention.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nNinety-eight heterosexual men aged between 19 and 72 years (mean = 27.3, SD =\n11.09) participated. Men were recruited from the local community (i.e. local business)\nthrough opportunity sampling. All participants were in a romantic relationship at the time\nwas comparable with the UK average (Mean 175.3cm, Health Survey for England, 2007,\nProcedure\nParticipants were presented with a questionnaire which asked a range of\nautobiographical questions (age, own height). The use of self-report rather than directly\nmeasured height is consistent with previous research (e.g. Pawlowski, 2003) and the\nreliability of this method is well documented (Himes and Roche, 1982). Participants were\nthen asked to rate their relationship satisfaction on a 7 point Likert scale. Participants were\nalso asked to complete the 24 item Multidimensional Jealousy Scale (Pfeiffer and Wong,\n1989), assessing cognitive (8 items), emotional (8 items) and behavioral jealousy (8 items).\nExample items include `How would you emotionally react to X flirting with someone of\nthe opposite sex?' and `How often do you call X unexpectedly, just to see if he or she is\nthere?' Each subscale proved to be reliable (Cronbach's alpha: cognitive: .92; emotional:\n.86 and behavioral: .90). All items relating to jealousy were completed on a 7 point Likert\nscale.\nFinally, participants completed the Mate Retention Inventory-Short Form (Buss,\nShackelford, and McKibbin, 2008), consisting of 38 items. Example items include \"Called\nto make sure my partner was where she said she would be\" and \"Perform sexual favors to\nkeep my partner around.\" The scale proved to be reliable (Cronbach's alpha: .88). Each\nsubscale of the questionnaire was also largely reliable (Cronbach's alpha: vigilance: .77;\nHeight, satisfaction, jealousy, retention\nconcealment of mate: .75; monopolization of time: .86; jealousy induction: .89; punish\nmate's infidelity threat: .39; emotional manipulation: .78; commitment manipulation: .45;\nderogation of competitors: .66; resource display: .88; sexual inducements: .68; appearance\nenhancement: .90; love and care: .71; submission and debasement: .72; verbal possession\nsignals: .57; physical possession signals: .79; possessive ornamentation: .82; derogation of\nmate: .60; intrasexual threats: .89; violence against rivals: .59 (2 items per subscale).\nResults\nConsistent with previous research (e.g. Buunk et al., 2008), regression analyses\nwere used to test for linear and quadratic effects. The analyses controlled for participant\nage. As shown in Table 1, significant linear and quadratic relationships were identified\nbetween men's height and relationship satisfaction, cognitive jealousy and behavioral\njealousy. An inspection of the residuals suggests that the linear regressions provided a\ncloser approximation of the data. As shown in Figures 1-3, tall men reported greater\nrelationship satisfaction and reported lower levels of jealous cognitions or jealous behavior.\nHowever, neither significant linear nor quadratic relationships were revealed between\nmen's height and emotional jealousy or overall use of mate retention strategies.\nTable 1.

The greater\nrelationship satisfaction reported by tall men is consistent with research finding that tall\nmen are more attractive to women (Pawlowski and Jasienska, 2005) and that women would\nrather be in a relationship in which the man is taller (Gillis and Avis, 1980). In order to\nguard against infidelity or desertion and promote mate retention, women partnered with a\nhigh quality mate may use a range of behaviors such as improving physical appearance to\nincrease their mate's satisfaction with the existing relationship (Buss, 1988). Therefore tall\nmen may report greater satisfaction with their relationship because their partner is more\nattentive. In addition, the greater desirability of tall men is expected to provide greater\nHeight, satisfaction, jealousy, retention\naccess to attractive women. Consequently, tall men may report greater satisfaction with\ntheir relationship because they are partnered to highly desirable women. Future research is\nrecommended to investigate the relative desirability and behavior of women partnered to\ntall and short men.\nThe current study revealed that tall men are less likely to report jealousy with\nrespect to jealous cognitions (i.e. suspicion or concern) or behaviors (intended to minimize\nthe threat). This is consistent with previous research indicating that high quality men\nexperience the least mate oriented jealousy (Brown and Moore, 2003). Both tall and short\nmen are at risk of cuckoldry (Baker and Bellis, 1995; Platek and Shackelford, 2006),\nhowever the greater desire for tall partners and heightened female preference for tall men\nduring the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle or when selecting short term partners\n(Pawlowski and Jasienska, 2005) suggest that shorter men should be more alert to the risk\nof their partner's infidelity or the presence of male rivals than tall men. An increased\npropensity to experience jealous cognitions (suspicion) or to act on these concerns (jealous\nbehaviors) may be adaptive for short men, reducing the risk posed by specific threats.\nThese cognitions and behaviors may be less advantageous for tall men, for whom the risk\n(of cuckoldry or desertion) may be lower and for whom an increased physical\nattractiveness could increase the likelihood that a desirable alternative mate could be\nobtained. These findings further demonstrate the manner in which evolved psychological\nmechanisms (i.e. jealousy) may interact with functionally relevant individual differences\n(i.e. height) to affect the expression of behavior (Schaller, Park, and Mueller, 2003).\nThe relationship between male height and mate retention was less uniform than\nother findings which may explain the lack of association between male height and the\noverall use of mate retention behaviors. The results suggest that tall men engage in\ndifferent mate retention behaviors and adopt different approaches to short men. Tall men\nwere more likely than short men to engage in mate retention behaviors such as vigilance or\nmonopolization of time. This tendency could reflect an ability to adopt undesirable\nbehaviors without lowering their overall mate quality. In contrast, we suggest that short\nmen may be reluctant to adopt these behaviors which could further reduce the\nattractiveness of the relationship, already compromised by a lower mate quality. The extent\nto which women's reactions to mate retention behavior is influenced by their partner's\nheight has not been investigated and additional research is required to explore this issue.\nShorter men were not more likely to engage in competitive behaviors such as\nviolence against rivals. This is perhaps understandable as tall rivals are expected to be of a\nconsequently risk retaliation and unfavorable comparisons with a higher quality rival if\nthey decide to pursue these mate retention behaviors. As height is related to testosterone\nlevels (Heald, et al., 2003), this finding is consistent with the finding that men with a high\n(2D:4D) digit ratio (indicating lower prenatal testosterone) are less likely to threaten\ncompetitors or use threats or aggression against their partner (Cousins, Fugere, and\nFranklin, 2009). In the current study, short men were most likely to adopt mate retention\nbehaviors such as increasing the love and care that they show their partner. In this manner\nshort men demonstrate that they are aware of the risk of cuckoldry but attempt to increase\nthe desirability of a woman's current relationship rather than adopting more risky strategies\nthat encourage comparisons with a rival or appear aggressive.\nMale height was not related to emotional jealousy (reactions to events that threaten\nHeight, satisfaction, jealousy, retention\nthe relationship). At first, the lack of association between height and emotional jealousy\nappears inconsistent with the greater cognitive and behavioral jealousy reported by short\nmen or the more generalized relationship between height and jealousy revealed by Buunk,\net al. (2008). Differences may reflect the focus of each subscale. The cognitive and\nbehavioral jealousy subscales measure the propensity to interpret situations suspiciously or\nrespond to that suspicion. In contrast, the emotional jealousy subscale asks participants to\nconsider how they would feel in a range of situations such as a partner hugging and kissing\nsomeone of the opposite sex. In these less ambiguous situations, height does not influence\nmen's emotional reactions. Although there may be less incentive for tall men to interpret\nambiguous situations jealously (for example a lower likelihood that their partner would\nattract a higher quality mate than for short men), when unambiguous situations occur, men\nexperience an emotional reaction, regardless of height. Alternatively, the results may reflect\nthe relatively high level of emotional (compared to cognitive or behavioral) jealousy\nand 14.65 (SD = 7.84) for cognitive and behavioral jealousy respectively, suggesting that\nmen may report high levels of emotional jealousy regardless of the scenario or personal\ncharacteristics such as height.\nFuture Research and Limitations\nSelf reported male height was obtained rather than direct measurements. The\nreliability of self reported height is well documented (Himes and Roche, 1982) and the use\nof self reported height is now standard practice (e.g. Pawlowski, 2003) in research of this\ntype. We acknowledge the limitations of this method however, and the greater accuracy\nafforded by direct measurements. In particular, the positive association between male\nheight, attractiveness and socioeconomic status suggest that data may be systematically\nbiased with men artificially inflating their self reported height. Additional research\nexploring this issue and establishing the reliability of self report measures is recommended.\nRelationship experience was also assessed through self report questionnaires. Future\nresearch could obtain a more detailed retrospective or longitudinal account of an\nindividual's relationship history including length of each relationship, relationship conflict\nand termination. This description would also provide important information about the\nrelationship between male height and relationship behavior. The relative ease with which\nhigh quality men can obtain extra pair partners (Waynforth, 1998) suggests that\nrelationships outside the primary pair bond and their impact on the pair bond should also be\nconsidered. For example, it may be predicted that women are more likely to forgive a taller\n(higher quality) partner when they are unfaithful than a lower quality short mate.\nThe current study focused on absolute male height. The relative height of men and\nwomen is also important however and both men and women adjust their preference for\npartner height in relation to their own height (Fink, Neave, Brewer, and Pawlowski, 2007;\nPawlowski, 2003). The relative height of a man, in relation to his partner, operationalized\nas sexual dimorphism in stature (SDS: male height / female height) should also therefore be\nconsidered in relation to relationship satisfaction, jealousy and mate retention. As with\nmuch of the research conducted in this area, the current study investigated height in a\nWestern post-industrial society. Sear and Marlowe (2009) find no evidence for the male\ntaller norm or a relationship between male height and reproductive success in the more\ntraditional Hadza community. Therefore the extent to which these results can be\nHeight, satisfaction, jealousy, retention\ngeneralized to non-Western cultures remains speculative and extensive cross-cultural\nresearch is required assessing both partner preference and mating behavior.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, the current study finds that tall men report greater satisfaction with\ntheir romantic relationship and are less likely to report cognitive or behavioral jealousy.\nThe relationship between height and mate retention is less uniform with tall and short men\nreporting engaging in different mate retention behaviors. These results indicate that male\nheight influences not just a man's ability to acquire a suitable mate, but his behavior whilst\nin the relationship and approach to mate retention. These findings compliment existing\nresults and suggest new areas of research such as investment in a partner and extra-pair\nrelationships.\nReferences\nAronson, E., and Pines, A. (1980, May).
