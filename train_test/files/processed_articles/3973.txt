Among the factors contributing to these out-\ncomes is the frequent statutory exclusion of precarious work-\nersfrombasichealthandsafetyrightsandinjury-compensation\nbenefits (Bernstein, Lippel, Tucker, & Vosko, 2006).\nMitigating or reversing such statutory exclusions in the face\nof employer and governmental opposition is challenging.\nThis study of the exclusion of farm workers in the Canadian\nprovince of Alberta from mandatory workers' compensation\ncoverage draws on social movement theory and uses narra-\ntive analysis to consider how issue framing can be used to\nimprove these precarious workers' access to statutory\nbenefits.\nExamining government rationales for the contrasting\nworkers' compensation exceptionalism experienced by\nAlberta firefighters and farm workers suggests that inconsis-\ntent political justifications may be a useful jumping-off point\nfor farm-worker advocates interested in increasing farm\nworkers'access to workers'compensation benefits. Yet addi-\ntional activities will likely be necessary to overcome the\ninterlocking interests of farmers and conservative politicians.\nAmong the strategies available to farm-worker advocates are\nthe following: (a) leveraging common-law solutions to injury\ncompensation to generate a shared framing among farmers\nand farm workers that mandatory workers' compensation is\nbeneficial, (b) utilizing the greater access of migrant farm\nworkers from other countries to workers' compensation\ntreatment as a way to reframe workers' compensation as a\nright rather than a cost, (c) mounting a constitutional chal-\nlenge to the farm-worker exclusion, and (d) developing a\ndigital mobilizing structure to create a space for farm work-\ners to share information about employers' employment prac-\ntices and articulate a shared sense of grievance.\nEmployment Precarity, Injury, and\nStatutory Benefits\nConstitutionally, Canada's 10 provinces and 3 territories are\nresponsible for regulating approximately 90% of employ-\nment relationships.

Alberta's\nemployment laws are frequently said to favor employers in\ntheir content (Block, Roberts, & Clarke, 2003) and (non)\napplication (Barnetson, forthcoming). As a result of this\narrangement, and controlling for demographic and industrial\ndifferences, Alberta workers are more likely to be injured on\nthe job than those in any other province except British\nThroughout Canada, there has been a widespread shift\nsince the 1980s toward employment conditions that are often\ncharacterized as precarious. Vosko (2006) defines precarious\nemployment as \"paid work characterized by limited social\nbenefits and statutory entitlements, job insecurity, low wages\nand high risks of ill health\" (p. 4). Precarious employment\nstands in contrast to the standard employment relationship\n(SER), which was the normal (although by no means univer-\nsal) form of employment during the middle to late 20th cen-\ntury and upon which public policy continues to be based.\nSome authors assert that growth in employment precarity is\na function of economic globalization, which has intensified\nthe commodification of labor and diminished collective\ninstitutions (e.g., public education, the SER, trade unions,\nstatutory employment rights and benefits) that provided\nimportant factors in the distribution of precarity.\nPrecarious employment is associated with negative health\neffects, including a greater risk of work-related injury or ill-\nness and a lower propensity to report such injuries (Lewchuk,\nClarke, & de Wolff, 2011; Lewchuk, de Wolff, King, &\n2001). This may reflect regulatory exclusion (Bernstein\net al., 2006). Historically, uncompensated workplace injury\ncaused significant social instability, which, in turn, gave rise\nto systems of workers' compensation (Babcock, 2006;\ncarious workers from such systems, via regulatory exclusion\nand employer efforts to transfer risk to workers via subcon-\ntracting arrangements (Lippel, 2006), shifts injury costs from\nemployers to workers, to their communities, and, in Canada\n(where health care is publicly funded), to the taxpayer.\nWhile policymakers and analysts grapple with the impli-\ncations of growing precarity, precarious workers and their\nadvocates seek ways to mitigate or reverse these effects. The\ncase of Alberta farm workers is instructive regarding efforts\nto reduce the statutory exclusions often associated with\nemployment precarity. Depending upon the Statistics Canada\nworkers (there appears to be no way to reconcile these num-\nbers). In addition to low wages and limited job security,\nAlberta's waged farm workers are excluded from virtually all\nstatutory employment rights, including occupational health\nand safety (OHS) and mandatory workers' compensation\n(Barnetson, 2009). Both employers and legislators have\nresisted efforts to extend basic health and safety rights\n(Barnetson, 2012a). A closer examination of farm workers'\nexclusion from mandatory workers' compensation coverage\nprovides insight into key issues and dimensions blocking\nefforts to extend statutory benefits to precarious workers. An\nimportant part of this examination lies in contrasting the\nworkers'compensation experience of precariously employed\nfarm workers with the experience of firefighters employed in\nComplicating this analysis is segmentation within the\nfarm-worker group: In addition to farm workers who are\nlong-time Alberta residents, there is a small group of interna-\ntional migrant workers. Alberta has a long history of relying\non small numbers of interprovincial migrant workers\ncurrently facilitates the use of approximately 3,000 interna-\ntional migrant workers, mostly from Mexico and the\nCaribbean (Canada, 2013). There are reports of exploitation\namong contemporary migrant workers that is facilitated by\ninternational migrants' tenuous residency. For example, the\nUnited Food and Commercial Workers reported that an\nemployer had hired all of the men from a single village in a\nLatin American country and, when one of them balked at\nunsafe work, the employer threatened to deport the entire\ncrew (Yeager, 2014). While there is no clear evidence of rac-\nism in the discussion about the statutory exclusion of farm\nworkers, Foster and Barnetson (2013) note that Alberta gov-\nernment legislators often praise migrant work while being\ncool to or critical of migrant workers. Questioning the com-\npetence and commitment of international migrant workers\nmay be an effort to politically justify the structural and\nracialized marginalization of international migrant workers\nby ascribing the marginalization to characteristics and behav-\niors of international migrant workers themselves.\nWorkers' Compensation and\nOccupational Disease\nEvery Canadian province operates a workers' compensation\nsystem. Workers who are within the ambit of coverage and\nwho experience a compensable occupational injury are\n(usually) eligible to receive a combination of wage-loss,\nvocational rehabilitation, and medical care benefits.\nWorkers' compensation operates as a \"no fault\" system.\nUnder this arrangement, workers are entitled to receive\nimmediate (albeit scheduled and capped) benefits without\nneeding to prove any breach of the standard of care under\ntort law. In exchange, workers have surrendered their right\nto pursue private litigation, including claims for aggra-\nvated and punitive damages (Barnetson, 2010).\nApproximately 80% of Canadian workers are covered by\nworkers' compensation, with significant gaps in coverage\nBarnetson 3\nevident among workers in non-SERs and self-employed\nworkers (Arthurs, 2012; Bernstein, Lippel, & Lamarche,\ntain categories of employers to carry workers' compensa-\ntion coverage for their employees, while other categories\nof employers--such as farmers in Alberta, Saskatchewan,\nNova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island and 17 U.S. juris-\ndictions--may purchase voluntary coverage (Barnetson,\n2009). There is greater variation among U.S. workers'\ncompensation systems, and the remaining 37 U.S. jurisdic-\ntions have some farm work coverage exceptions, typically\nfor farms with limited waged labor (Farmworker Justice,\nHistorically, most workers' compensation claims arose\nfrom acute physical injuries clearly linked to a workplace\nincident, thus determining that compensability was fairly\nstraightforward. By contrast, occupational diseases often\nhave long latency periods and murky causation (Elinson,\nchallenges posed by occupational disease are employer\nefforts to minimize liability by withholding information\nabout the injurious nature of materials and work processes\nand government reluctance to take action that would expand\nemployer liability (Brophy, Keith, & Schieman, 2007;\nThat being said, governments have recognized some\noccupational diseases and granted workers with such dis-\neases presumptive status. Presumptive status means that the\nWorkers' Compensation Board (WCB) automatically\naccepts claims when workers demonstrate that they have a\nspecified disease unless the WCB can rebut such a presump-\ntion. Some workers receive presumptive status for occupa-\ntional cancers (e.g., firefighters, coal miners, and workers\nexposed to asbestos), but the presumption is often condi-\ntioned upon the worker having worked in a specific industry\nand/or for a specific period of time. Canada-wide, accepted\nworkers' compensation claims for deaths due to occupa-\nand 2010. Led by increases in Ontario, the number of\naccepted claims for cancer-related death has now surpassed\nclaims for traumatic-injury-related deaths (Del Bianco &\nDemers, 2013). Presumptive status may be the only realistic\nway to ensure compensation for occupational cancer. For\nexample, there is broad agreement that 8% to 10% of can-\ncers have an occupational link (Epstein, 1998; Proctor,\nTakala, 2005). The need to prove (and the difficulty associ-\nated with proving) an occupational link may partially\n0.68% of cancer deaths in Alberta resulted in successful\nworkers' compensation claims--the majority being pre-\nsumptive-status claims (Barnetson, 2010).\nFirefighters, Farm Workers, and\nOccupational Cancer\nThere is significant evidence that full-time municipal fire-\nfighters are at heightened risk of various kinds of cancer,\nincluding melanoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia,\nand multiple myeloma as well as bladder, brain, colon,\nesophageal, kidney, lung, prostate, stomach, and testicular\nPukkala et al., 2014). This heightened risk is most likely the\nresult of occupational exposures to burning materials. While\nmost workers can refuse to work when they face imminent\ndanger, Section 35(2)(a) of Alberta's OHS Act defines immi-\nnent danger as \"a danger that is not normal for that occupa-\ntion.\" Carcinogenic exposures are normal dangers for\nfirefighters, and thus firefighters have no right to refuse this\nwork.\nAll Alberta municipal firefighters fall within the ambit of\nthe Workers' Compensation Act. Absent presumptive status,\nfirefighters seeking workers'compensation for cancer would\nhave to demonstrate that their cancer arose from and occurred\nduring the course of employment. Proving cancer causation\nfor firefighters has been difficult. While no Alberta data are\navailable, British Columbia reported a 35% acceptance rate\n2004). Recognizing the evidence of occupational cancer\namong firefighters, the Manitoba legislature granted pre-\nsumptive status to certain firefighter cancers in 2002.\nBeginning in 2003, Alberta, British Columbia, New\nBrunswick, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, Nova\nScotia, and the Yukon followed suit (Association of Workers'\nCompensation Boards of Canada, 2012). Further changes in\ninclude 14 types of cancers, assuming the firefighter meets\nminimum service requirements.\nFirefighters typically have SERs, with high wages and job\nsecurity and significant access to employment and statutory\nbenefits. Firefighters' success in maintaining and improving\ntheir working conditions may stem from a high rate of union-\nization (resulting in relatively high wages and job security),\nfirefighting's ties to the interests of capital (i.e., property pro-\ntection and loss mitigation), and efforts by firefighter advo-\ncates to politically capitalize upon the \"honourable white\nmasculinity associated with firefighting\" (Braedley, 2009, p.\n129). Canadian firefighters sought presumptive status for a\nnumber of years (Guidotti, 2003). Some commentators sug-\ngest that the widespread adoption of presumptive status in\nCanada beginning in 2002 reflects firefighter advocates'utili-\nzation of their increased political capital post-9/11 to trigger\nlong-sought legislative change. Indeed, Alberta legislators\nmade specific reference to the heroism of firefighters during\n2003c). Interestingly, despite increases in the prevalence of\npresumptive status and 9/11-specific injury-compensation\n4 SAGE Open\nlegislation, only half theAmerican firefighters have access to\npresumptive status for cancer (Gordy, 2013).\nIn contrast to firefighters, Alberta farm workers are arche-\ntypal precarious workers, with low wages and limited job\n3,000 of these workers are foreign migrant workers, whose\nprecarious employment is compounded by their precarious\nresidency (Canada, 2013). Farm workers are largely excluded\nfrom statutory employment rights, including most of the\nEmployment Standards Code, all of the Labour Relations\nCode and the OHS Act, and mandatory workers' compensa-\ntion coverage (Barnetson, 2009). The employers of approxi-\nmately 7.5% of farm workers have taken out voluntary\nworkers' compensation coverage (WCB, 2013). Farm work-\ners with coverage seeking to make a worker's compensation\nclaim for occupational cancer would need to demonstrate\nthat the cancer arose from and occurred during the course of\nemployment, a task complicated by their lack of a right to\nknow about the hazards they are exposed to due to their\nexclusion from the OHS Act.\nPrevious research examined the opportunity structure\nfaced by Alberta farm workers seeking basic statutory\nemployment rights (Barnetson, 2009). The opportunity struc-\nture--the degree of openness within a system to change, the\n(in)stability of economic and political relationships among\npowerful actors, the presence of powerful allies, and the\nstate's ability and willingness to repress dissent--is one of\nthree sets of factors typically of interest in social movement\ntwo factors are mobilizing structures (i.e., informal and for-\nmal means by which individuals act collectively) and the\nframing process by which groups develop shared meanings\nand definitions, including a sense of cognitive liberation (i.e.,\nthe sense that inequitable circumstances are susceptible to\nThis earlier research found that the statutory exclusion of\nAlberta farm workers is one outcome of the interlocking eco-\nnomic and political interests of the state, agribusiness, and\nfarmers, and that there was little evidence that farm workers\nhad much opportunity to advance an agenda of statutory\ninclusion. This study seeks to extend that research by nar-\nrowing the focus to a specific exclusion (mandatory workers'\ncompensation) and examining the framing process.\nSpecifically, it considers how legislators (key actors as set\nout in the earlier research) frame the exceptional nature of\nthe farm-worker exclusion and how farm workers do (and\nmay) resist and influence that framing.\nWhile social movement theory typically discusses the\ndevelopment of a shared framing of an issue among workers\nited ability to develop mobilizing structures due to the frag-\nmented nature of the industry and their inability to unionize\nsuggest that alternative approaches to developing a shared\nframing and mobilizing structures may be necessary. For\nexample, developing a shared framing between employers\nand precarious workers may be a useful approach.\nIt is important to recognize that social movement theory is\noften criticized as overly structuralist and insufficiently cog-\nnizant of the agency of actors and the implicit or explicit\nstrategic choices they make (Jasper, 2004). The manner in\nwhich workers and worker advocates engage in framing\ndebates will be influenced by various dilemmas (e.g., with\nregard to organizational form, engagement, naughty vs. nice,\nplan vs. opportunity) that are common to social movements.\nConsidering how (and why) workers and their advocates\nhave approached these dilemmas begins to link a structural\nanalysis of framing to social action and will form part of this\nstudy's analysis.\nThe study begins by considering how the workers' com-\npensation access of firefighters (exceptionally good) con-\ntrasts with the workers'compensation access of farm workers\n(exceptionally bad). This comparative approach is warranted\nbecause farm workers share three important similarities to\nfirefighters around occupational disease. First, farm workers\nface a heightened risk of various kinds of cancers, including\nmelanoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia, and multi-\nple myeloma as well as brain, cervical, esophageal, oral,\nprostate, and stomach cancers (Blair & Freeman, 2009; Blair\nDodge, & Yang, 2009). Second, this heightened risk is likely\nthe result of occupational exposures to pesticides, solvents,\nexhausts, dusts, and microbes. Third, farm workers have no\nability to refuse occupational exposures to carcinogens due\nto their exclusion from the OHS Code. Understanding how\nAlberta legislators have justified such differential exception-\nalism around injury compensation identifies key consider-\nations around the framing process for advocates seeking to\nincrease access to statutory rights for precarious workers. It\nalso suggests potentially fruitful ways for workers and their\nadvocates to reframe the issue.\nMethod\nAlthough this case study focuses exclusively on Alberta, it\nwill be of interest to readers in both Canada and the United\nStates. Along with Alberta, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward\nIsland, and Saskatchewan continue to normally exclude\nfarming and ranching from mandatory workers' compensa-\ntion coverage. The strategies available to Alberta farm work-\ners and their advocates may have utility in these other\nprovinces. The long-standing social and fiscal conservativ-\nism of Alberta's government has given rise to a labor rela-\ntions climate similar to that experienced by many American\nreaders. For example, Alberta's private-sector unionization\nrate is approximately 12% (Canada, 2012), and there are sig-\nnificant numbers of international migrant workers--both in\nagriculture and in the service industry (Canada, 2013). These\nparallels suggest that strategies identified in this article may\nhave application in the United States.\nBarnetson 5\nAlberta is governed in the Westminster parliamentary tra-\ndition--the party that elects the most legislators forms the\ngovernment. The right-wing Progressive Conservative party\nhas formed the government since 1971. This study uses nar-\nrative analysis to examine how government (i.e., Progressive\nConservative or \"Tory\") members of the legislative assem-\nbly (MLAs) in Alberta explain the differential access to\nworkers' compensation benefits faced by farm workers and\nmunicipal firefighters. MLAs' statements were selected for\nanalysis because they can indicate the outcomes and norms\ndesired by powerful actors and provide insight into how poli-\nticians justify such outcomes to maintain legitimacy with the\nelectorate (Sharma, 2006). The study of such public rituals\ncan be useful in understanding the underlying political econ-\nomy of an issue as well as identifying specific framing and\nreframing efforts.\nNarrative analysis identifies how MLAs order and relay\ninformation about workers' compensation coverage and\nthereby communicate (or construct) a particular meaning for\nthe audience (Bryman, Bell, Mills, & Yue, 2011; Prasad,\n2005). Because narratives are constructed, narrative analysis\nallows us to examine both the story itself and how the story\nserves the interests of the teller while preserving the teller's\ncontext (Smith, 2000). The intentionality of narrative con-\nstruction means that the teller, the audience, and the context\nall become important components of the analysis\n(Czarniawska-Joerges, 2004). Given the nature of the data,\nthis study conducts a thematic form of narrative analysis to\nassess how MLAs justify differential access to compensation\nbenefits, which emphasizes the content of the story and how\nit serves specific interests (Riessman, 2008).\nThe data for this study comprise all the statements\nrecorded in transcripts of the proceedings of the Legislative\nAssembly of Alberta (Hansard) by government MLAs about\nworkers' compensation for farm workers and firefighters\nset excludes government policy documents. Examples of\nthese documents were reviewed and not found to articulate a\npolicy rationale suitable for analysis. This study also excludes\nstatements by MLAs recorded in print media. A review of\nsuch statements revealed that they added little new content.\nData collection began with keyword searches (injur*,\nworker*, compensation, firefighter*, farm*) of Hansard\n2000 was selected as a starting date due to the significant\nincrease in provincial attention to workplace injury (includ-\ning farm injuries) that occurred at that time (Barnetson,\nadded little to the analysis. A review of the 373 potentially\nrelevant passages narrowed the dataset down to 103 pas-\nsages. The relevant passages were analyzed in the context of\nthe statement in which they appeared to ensure that the quo-\ntation could be understood within its context.\nA thematic narrative analysis was then conducted in three\nstages. First, an initial reading of all the statements brought\nto the surface six main reasons for firefighter exceptionalism\nand three main reasons for farm-worker exceptionalism. The\ndataset for farm-worker exceptionalism was thin (10 pas-\nsages) but closely mirrored a much larger dataset regarding\nfarm-worker exclusions from the ambit of Alberta's OHS Act\n(Barnetson, 2012a). Second, each reason for exceptionalism\nwas further analyzed to tease out its details in greater depth.\nThird, the analytic focus moved to the context in which each\nset of justifications was constructed, to draw out additional\ninsights about the justifications and identify key issues and\ndimensions relevant to mitigating or reversing the statutory\nexclusion of farm workers.\nJustifying Firefighter and Farm-Worker\nExceptionalism\nMLAs used six reasons to justify presumptive status for fire-\nfighter cancers during the 2003 legislative debates. These\narguments were reprised verbatim when presumptive cover-\nage was expanded to other cancers as well as to part-time and\nthe narratives used each time was striking, and exemplars set\ndebates.\nThe first reason government MLAs gave for granting fire-\nfighters presumptive status was that firefighters get cancer\nmore often than the average person, most likely caused by\noccupational exposures to carcinogens. For example, the\nsponsor of the 2003 bill (MLA Richard Magnus) made the\nfollowing statement:\nStudies from Burnett, Guidotti, Mount Sinai, and the Ontario\nindustrial disease panel, to name a few, all have told the same\nstory: The profession of fire fighting makes firefighters more\nlikely to get these cancers than you and I. Why? Because every\ntime that a firefighter walks into a fire . . . he steps into a toxic\nsoup of soot and gases that are released by the burning materials.\nMLAs' second reason for enacting presumptive coverage\nwas that firefighters are the only workers who cannot refuse\nexposures to occupational carcinogens:\n[T]here's a huge difference between firefighters and other\nprofessions. If in any other profession workers encounter a\ndangerous situation, an environmental risk, they can refuse to\nwork under that danger . . . but firefighters cannot. When an oil\nrefinery explodes or a chemical factory catches fire, firefighters\nare duty bound to enter that environment and work in it. (Mr.\nThe third reason given for presumptive coverage was the\ndifficulty individual firefighters have in demonstrating the\nclear link between a specific exposure (or specific exposures)\n6 SAGE Open\nand their cancer that is necessary to gain workers'compensa-\ntion benefits:\nThe fundamental problem from an evidentiary point of view is\nthat many cancers arise from many, many different types of\ncauses. . . . It's very difficult, if not impossible, for us to know\nexactly what the causes of those cancers were and when they\nmight have arisen. The result has been that it's been extremely\ndifficult for our firefighters to muster the evidence necessary to\nshow that there is a nexus between the various types of cancer\nand the exposure to toxic compounds that they encounter in the\ncourse of their employment, sometimes years and years before a\nPlacing such an evidentiary burden on firefighters and\ntheir families was deemed to be unfair:\nWithout this legislation Alberta firefighters . . . would have to\nfile a workers' compensation claim and endure the uncertainties\nof the claims process. This process of claims and appeals can\ntake years to produce a final decision, and even then there is no\nguarantee that the claims system will recognize their illness as\noccupational and award appropriate compensation. [Presumptive\nstatus] would allow these families to focus all of their attention\nand energy on fighting these diseases rather than on the claims\nand appeals process of workers' compensation. (Mr. Johnston,\nMLAs' fourth reason for granting firefighters presump-\ntive status was that the cost of presumptive status was\nexpected to be small:\nAnother concern is that all of a sudden there will be an outpouring\nof claims for WCB benefits. Let's face it. No one wants to have\ncancer. Cancer claims aren't going to appear mysteriously out of\nnowhere if Bill 202 is passed. Current statistics bear this out.\nEach year 1.8 of every 1,000 firefighters are diagnosed with\ncancer. In Alberta there are roughly 2,300 firefighters. Using\nsimple math, then, it can reasonably be assumed that four cancer\ncases involving firefighters would be brought to the WCB's\nattention in Alberta each year. (Mr. Cenaiko, as cited in Alberta,\nThe fifth reason MLAs cited for granting presumptive sta-\ntus was that other jurisdictions had adopted similar presump-\ntive-status provisions around firefighter cancer:\nThis has already been accomplished in one other Canadian\nprovince and 23 states of the United States. . . . Manitoba set the\nstandard for other provinces to follow by passing Bill 5, the\nWorkers Compensation Act, on May 2, 2002. . . . The road to\nintroducing Bill 5 in Manitoba was one that involved tragic\nevents. Since 1987 17 firefighters have died in Winnipeg from\nwork-related cancers. That is 17 lives lost and 17 families\nFinally, MLAs described firefighters as heroes and indi-\ncated that society owed them presumptive status:\nThere's another reason to support this bill, a more emotional,\nless tangible reason, and that is that firefighters deserve it. They\ndeserve to know that just as they are there for us whenever we\nencounter danger and just as they answer any call for help, they\ncan count upon us as legislators and Albertans to back them up\nin their rare times of need. Firefighters haven't come before the\nLegislature before, making demands or asking for help. That\nwould be out of character for them, but this matters to them\ndeeply. It matters that we send a signal that we understand the\nrisks they take, the dangers they face, and the duty they accept,\na duty that few of us would ever consider. (Mr. Magnus, as cited\nA variation in this theme was that society owed firefight-\ners' families presumptive status:\nThe service of the men and women who bravely enter burning\nbuildings, gladly risking their lives for ours, is quite obvious.\nMore subtle is the service rendered to the people of Alberta by\nthe families of these firefighters. Each day, like the firefighters\nthemselves, they deal with a great amount of uncertainty. Mr.\nSpeaker, they're also the ones who will take care of our\nfirefighters if they have to battle cancer and are the ones left\nbehind if they lose that fight. (Mr. Johnston, as cited in Alberta,\nIn contrast to the prominence of firefighters in the argu-\nments for granting them exceptional access to compensation,\nfarm workers are entirely absent from discussion about\nmaintaining the farm-worker exclusion from workers' com-\npensation. Instead, MLAs discuss employer interests, a sub-\nject that never came up when they were discussing\npresumptive status for firefighters--perhaps because fire-\nfighter employers were supportive of presumptive status\n(Alberta, 2011b). When the farm-worker exclusion was\nquestioned, MLAs argued three things. First, MLAs said that\neducating farmers about the benefits of taking out voluntary\nworkers' compensation for their workers was better than\nforcing them to do so:\nMr. Speaker, when we do some of the work and talk with the\nfarm families, there are many of them who are aware that they\ncan get coverage under WCB, and a lot of individuals opt to take\nthe optional WCB coverage. So there is some protection that's\navailable for farm workers if the employers and employees\nmake that arrangement between themselves. On that basis, we\ndon't anticipate any immediate changes. We still believe in\neducation and some of the work that . . . [cut off by time limit].\nSecond, MLAs argued that farms cannot be regulated like\nso-called regular worksites, primarily because farms are\nmixed-use worksites (i.e., they are both homes and\nbusinesses):\nWell, Mr. Speaker, work environment on a farm obviously\ndiffers a great deal from that in any industrial setting. A farm is\nalso a place where people actually live and raise children, and\nBarnetson 7\nit's a community, so applying strict industrial standards to a farm\nsetting is not exactly comparable. (Mr. Lukaszuk, as cited in\nFinally, some MLAs said that farmers do not want manda-\ntory workers' compensation coverage forced upon them:\nWell, Mr. Speaker, it's not about [the government] finding\nmoney. It's about the producers' desire. I know that if the\nproducers, in their wisdom not ours, were to come forward in a\nmajority view to the minister of agriculture, he would bring that\nforward to this table. He represents them extraordinarily well.\nBut I must inform the hon. member, being a part of the\nagricultural community myself, that they are very independent\nthinkers, and they like to make their decisions and ask us to\ncarry out policy they believe is in their best interest. (Mrs.\nI had it reinforced for me again this morning in a meeting that I\nhad in Trochu, Alberta, with a group of 25 agricultural producers\nwhen I asked them right flat out how we could help them and\nthey said: no more regulations. I said: Are we moving in the\nright direction with our farm safety instead of workmen's\ncompensation and occupational health and safety? They said:\nAbsolutely; this is what we want. (Mr. Hayden, as cited in\nIt is useful to assess the validity of these rationales for\nexceptionalism. This analysis suggests that contrasting forms\nof workers' compensation exceptionalism mask very similar\nworking conditions for firefighters and farm workers and are\nfrequently based on specious arguments.\nDiscussion\nThe rationales used to justify granting firefighters presump-\ntive coverage for some cancers sit uneasily with MLAs'\nefforts to maintain the farm-worker exclusion. While it is\ntrue that firefighters get cancer more often than the average\nperson, research suggests that farm workers also face a\nheightened rate of cancer. MLAs' efforts to distinguish fire-\nfighters from other workers by saying that firefighters are the\nonly workers who cannot refuse exposures to occupational\ncarcinogens ignore the fact that farm workers are also unable\nto refuse unsafe exposures, because they are excluded from\nthe ambit of the OHS Code.\nThe difficulty firefighters faced in demonstrating a clear\nlink between a specific exposure (or specific exposures) and\ntheir cancer is consistent with the causation challenges typi-\ncal of occupational diseases. Farm workers face similar dif-\nficulties because their exclusion from the OHS Code means\ntheir employers have no obligation to inform them about the\nhazards in their workplace, including carcinogenic expo-\nsures. While MLAs did offer to consider extending presump-\ntive status to other occupational groups with valid claims\nLabour Relations Code effectively precludes such a claim\ndue to farm workers' limited individual ability to formulate\nand advance such claims to government.\nMLAs noted that the cost of presumptive status was\nexpected to be small. The cost of mandatory workers' com-\npensation coverage would be approximately 3% of payroll.\nAbsent mandatory coverage, farm workers' employers are\nable to externalize injury costs onto farm workers, their fam-\nilies, and the taxpayer-funded medical system. Justifying\npresumptive status for firefighters by pointing to similar\nefforts in other jurisdictions ignores the fact that farm work-\ners have slowly been acquiring basic employment rights in\nother Canadian jurisdictions, a trend that accelerated during\nthe time period during which firefighter presumptive status\nspread across Canada (Barnetson, 2012a; Faraday, Fudge, &\nTucker, 2012). Finally, MLAs described firefighters as\nheroes and indicated that society owed firefighters presump-\ntive status. By contrast, farm workers are entirely absent\nfrom legislative debates about extending mandatory work-\ners' compensation coverage.\nThe rationales used to justify maintaining the farm-worker\nexclusion from workers' compensation are clearly defective.\nMLAs' assertion that educating farmers about the benefits of\ntaking out voluntary workers' compensation for their work-\ners was better than forcing farmers to take out coverage can-\nnot be reconciled with the fact that education has resulted in\napproximately 93% of farm workers having no coverage.\nMLAs' insistence that farms cannot be regulated like so-\ncalled regular worksites because they are both homes and\nbusinesses ignores the fact that nine other jurisdictions in\nCanada require mandatory coverage (although farms oper-\nated with only family labor are sometimes excluded). And\nMLAs' belief that farmers do not want mandatory workers'\ncompensation coverage forced upon them ignores the fact\nthat employer resistance to regulation is generally not con-\nsidered a valid basis upon which to make public policy.\nFurthermore, the underlying issue is that government MLAs\nare politically beholden to rural voters for reelection due to\nMLAs' gerrymandering of electoral boundaries, and, conse-\nquently, MLAs are reluctant to eliminate the statutory excep-\ntionalism that farmers value (Barnetson, 2009).\nThis analysis yields three useful, although admittedly\npedestrian, observations for worker advocates. First, excep-\ntionalism in public policy requires justification. The justifi-\ncation provided does not necessarily have to be particularly\ngood (or even true). But politicians clearly recognize the\nneed for at least the fa\u00e7ade of a rationale so as to maintain\ntheir legitimacy when making public policy. This, in turn,\nsuggests that politicians may be sensitive (or even vulnera-\nble) to having their purported rationale upended by careful\nand timely analysis. Second, employer support or opposition\ncan play a critical role in extending access to statutory ben-\nefits. Employer opposition is not immutable and is suscepti-\nble to being politically neutralized or even converted into\nsupport. Furthermore, employer opposition is not determina-\ntive: Workers with powerful allies or whose dissent the state\n8 SAGE Open\nwould be unable or unwilling to repress can achieve public\npolicy change. These lessons are applied below to suggest\nsome potential opportunities for change.\nConclusion\nThe analysis above suggests four potential strategies for\nadvancing mandatory workers' compensation coverage for\nAlberta farm workers. These strategies can be pursued indi-\nvidually but are also mutually reinforcing, in that each\naddresses one of the three key dimensions suggested by\nsocial movement theory (political opportunities, mobilizing\nstructures, and framing processes). The strategic choices and\ndilemmas posed by each strategy are also considered.\nThe longevity of workers' compensation systems can be\npartly attributed to how well the systems meet the respective\nneeds of workers, employers, and the state. Workers receive\nimmediate, stable, and predictable compensation. Employers\nbenefit from liability protection and the collectivizing of the\ncost of injury.And the state can manage disputes about injury\ncompensation by channeling them into an energy-intensive\nprocess run by an arms-length organization (Barnetson,\n2010). Alberta's farm-worker exclusion means that employ-\ners can be sued by their workers. The potential awards from\na civil suit--which may include aggravated and punitive\ndamages--can be significant. Consider the recent USD$765\nmillion settlement agreed to by the National Football League\nsimilar CAD$38 million lawsuit filed by National Hockey\nLeague Player Steve Moore against Todd Bertuzzi and the\nVancouver Canucks, following a 2004 hit that ended Moore's\ncareer, was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum\n(Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 2014). While sports\nstars have financial resources far beyond those of most farm\nworkers, the potential for individual or class-action suits\nresulting in large awards is not lost on Alberta farmers.\nIndeed, a recent lawsuit brought by the widow of farm\nworker Kevan Chandler resulted in an out-of-court settle-\nment and the subsequent bankruptcy of the employer\nThe specter of crippling awards for farm injuries has\nheightened interest within some employer groups in the lia-\nbility protection offered by workers'compensation coverage.\nIndeed, some members of Alberta's largest farm lobby group\npassed a motion compelling their organization to explore\nmandatory workers' compensation coverage (Barnetson,\n2013c). So far, this has created significant discord within this\nproducers' group, which has reduced the group's ability to\npublicly resist calls for mandatory workers' compensation--\nalthough the group's executive continues to do so behind the\nLawsuits over both injuries and fatalities provide a means\n(albeit imperfect) to provide injury compensation to workers\nand to increase the levels of voluntary coverage among\nemployers, both of which are positive outcomes. As levels of\nvoluntary coverage grow, employer resistance to the cost of\ncoverage will decrease and the desire to take the cost of cov-\nerage out of competition (via mandatory coverage) will\ngrow. In addition to creating periodic political opportunities\nfor change, civil suits also create the possibility for employ-\ners and farm workers to develop a shared framing of manda-\ntory coverage as a mutually beneficial outcome. The key\nimpediments to this strategy for farm-worker activists are the\ncost of litigation, the delays involved in it, and the willing-\nness of workers (or their families) to engage in it. The bene-\nfits include the humanizing of farm workers, demonstrating\ntheir vulnerability to injuries, and highlighting the indecency\nof employers who externalize costs onto workers in the form\nof injury.\nOver the past 20 years, Alberta farmers have begun\nemploying increasing numbers of international migrant\nwere employed through various government-sponsored for-\neign-workerprograms(EmploymentandSocialDevelopment\nCanada, 2014). Employers must provide each of these\nmigrant workers with workers' compensation coverage,\neither from a provincial WCB or from a private insurer\n(Employment and Social Development Canada, 2013). As a\nresult, international migrant workers have better statutory\naccess to workers' compensation (via federal requirements)\nthan do farm workers who hold Canadian citizenship.Alberta\nhas experienced a rapid increase in the use of temporary\ngrowth has caused significant political problems for Alberta\npoliticians around the specter of migrant workers displacing\nCanadians and eroding wages and working conditions\n(Foster & Barnetson, 2013). Highlighting the preferential\naccess that international migrant workers are granted to\nworkers' compensation provides a potent rhetorical lever for\nthose advocating mandatory access for Canadian farm\nworkers.\nThis lever is potent in two ways. First, it plays on an exist-\ning fear among Canadian workers that international workers\nwill replace them, by providing evidence that international\nworkers receive better treatment than Canadian workers (at\nleast in this one respect). That Alberta's government pro-\nvides Canadian farm workers with poorer access to injury\ncompensation than the federal government mandates for for-\neign nationals is potentially damaging for provincial politi-\ncians, particularly in light of growing grassroots resistance to\nforeign migrant workers. Second, there is no real rationale\nfor excluding farm workers from mandatory coverage,\nexcept the perceived need to politically pander to their\nemployers. Indeed, other workers who face similarly hazard-\nous working conditions (such as firefighters) receive excep-\ntional access to workers'compensation rather than exclusion.\nThe potential effectiveness of this strategy will be height-\nened if it is pursued in combination with a litigation strategy\nto reduce employer resistance to mandatory coverage. A\npotential risk associated with this approach is that it may\nBarnetson 9\nprove divisive among potential progressive allies, who are\nsympathetic to the position of migrant workers.\nA third strategy is to launch a constitutional challenge to\nAlberta's statutory exclusion of farm workers from basic\nemployment rights. Alberta's exclusion of farm workers\nfrom mandatory workers' compensation coverage may vio-\nlate Sections 7 and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and\nFreedoms. Section 15(1) of the Charter stipulates,\nEvery individual is equal before and under the law and has the\nright to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without\ndiscrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based\non race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or\nmental or physical disability.\nMedeiros and McIntyre (2014) suggest that the farm-\nworker exclusion may discriminate on the basis of occupa-\ntional status and disability. While occupational status is not\nan enumerated ground of discrimination, the jurisprudence\nsuggests that it may be an analogous ground. The concurring\nreasons in Dunmore v Ontario (Attorney General) (2001)\nand Ontario (Attorney General) v Fraser (2011) provided\ndiffering views as to whether occupational status as an agri-\ncultural worker is a protected ground; thus, the facts of any\nchallenge will be an important factor in the outcome of a\nchallenge. The disability argument is that two of the diseases\n(silo filler's disease and farmer's lung) for which presump-\ntive status is granted are likely to be caused by exposures\nunique to farm workers; excluding farm workers from work-\ners' compensation coverage indirectly discriminates against\nagricultural workers who develop these diseases. These\nforms of discrimination create a disadvantage by precluding\nfarm workers from accessing the medical and vocational\nrehabilitation services they would otherwise be entitled to\nunder workers' compensation. Instead, these farm workers\nmust rely upon probably slower and poorer publicly pro-\nvided medical services.\nSection 7 of the Charter stipulates that\nEveryone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person\nand the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance\nwith the principles of fundamental justice.\nExcluding farm workers from the ambit of workers' com-\npensation means that these workers must access medical ser-\nvices through the public health care system, which entails\nlong waiting times. By contrast, workers within the workers'\ncompensation system have expedited access to diagnostic and\ntreatment services due, for which the WCB pays directly. The\nreduced speed and quality of health services caused by the\nfarm-worker exclusion may cause detrimental physical and\npsychological effects, which constitute a violation of farm\nworkers' security of person (Medeiros & McIntyre, 2014).\nSuch a challenge would need to engage with the question of\nwhether the resulting deprivation is arbitrary, over-broad, and\ngrossly disproportional. Both the Section 7 challenge and the\nSection 15 challenge would also need to withstand a likely\ngovernment argument that these violations can be reasonably\njustified in a free and democratic society (Section 1). The\nkey impediment to this strategy is mostly one of cost and\ndelay, but the prospect of a court victory by farm workers\nmay pressurize the government to preemptively amend its\nlegislation.\nThe final strategy is one of social mobilization via social\nmedia (specifically Facebook). Traditionally, it has been dif-\nficult to organize or even disseminate information to farm\nworkers because of their physical isolation and fear of being\nostracized (Danysk, 1995). The ubiquity of mobile devices,\nthe penetration of social media, and the anonymity of the\nInternet dramatically reduce the issues of distance and the\nrisks of information sharing and organizing. Anonymously\nsharing employment experiences serves a dual purpose. In\nthe short term, it provides prospective workers with informa-\ntion about potential employers. This creates a form of market\npressure on employers to provide desirable working condi-\ntions, although such pressure may be diminished by a loose\nlabor market and may be less meaningful for migrant work-\ners (who have no labor mobility). In the longer term, it gives\nfarm workers an opportunity to develop a sense of shared\ngrievance (i.e., it creates a framing process).\nIn contrast to efforts in the Canadian province of Ontario\n(Faraday et al., 2012), organized labor in Alberta has largely\nabandoned efforts to assist farm workers to acquire statutory\nrights, with only the United Food and Commercial Workers\ncarrying forward an extended, albeit modest, campaign. In\nplace of organized labor, a grassroots organization called the\nFarmworkers Union of Alberta (FU Alberta) has emerged\nover the past 10 years. FU Alberta has few organizational\nresources; it has only two staff members, both of whom are\nvolunteers. One of the difficulties FU Alberta has faced is a\nbelief among other stakeholders that it does not represent a\nconstituency. The exclusion of farm workers from the ambit\nof the Labour Relations Code effectively precludes FU\nAlberta from representing farm workers in collective bar-\ngaining. This statutory inability to bargain dramatically\nreduces the incentive of farm workers to join FU Alberta,\nresulting in few members and questions about whom (if any-\none) FU Alberta represents. This lack of organizational\ncapacity has been used by organized labor as a pretext for\nlimiting its support of FU Alberta. And the lack of a constitu-\nency limits the policy salience of FU Alberta when it is inter-\nacting with provincial politicians.\nA vibrant Facebook group creates a mobilizing structure\nthat FU Alberta may eventually be able to parlay into more\nconcrete action (e.g., demonstrations, letter-writing cam-\npaigns). This process has proven effective in the grassroots\nmobilization of opponents of Canada's temporary foreign-\nworker program. It also calls attention to working conditions\non farms, conditions that are often exploitative and simply\nodious: numerous injuries, many of them gruesome, poor sani-\ntation, appalling working and living conditions, low wages\nand poor treatment, harassment, and sexual assault (Dunlop\n& Kosta, 2008). These characteristics of farm work can be\nharnessed to improve the public perception of farm workers\nas necessary and hardworking, and as needing and deserving\nof the same basic employment rights as every other worker.\nThe key difficulties for farm-worker advocates center on the\neffort involved in sustaining such a community and the\npotential development of rival agendas.\nOverall, this analysis of framing opportunities around\nmandatory workers' compensation coverage for farm work-\ners suggests that, while there is presently little political\nopportunity for broad statutory inclusion of farm workers in\nAlberta (Barnetson, 2009), reframing sub-issues (as well as\ncreating mobilizing structures) may change the context and\nthus the option set available for farm-worker advocates.\nConsidering the current environment, strategies such as\nincreasing employer interest in voluntary coverage via a\ncredible litigation threat, revealing inconsistencies in work\ntreatment, challenging the constitutionality of the exclusion,\nand developing space for farm workers to share stories and\nengage in a framing debate provide viable options for\nadvocates.\n"
