    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe word \"emotion\" has named a psychological category and a subject for systematic enquiry only since the 19th century.\nBefore then, relevant mental states were categorised variously as \"appetites,\" \"passions,\" \"affections,\" or \"sentiments.\" The word\n\"emotion\" has existed in English since the 17th century, originating as a translation of the French \u00e9motion, meaning a physical\ndisturbance. It came into much wider use in 18th-century English, often to refer to mental experiences, becoming a fully fledged\ntheoretical term in the following century, especially through the influence of two Scottish philosopher-physicians, Thomas Brown\nand Charles Bell. This article relates this intellectual and semantic history to contemporary debates about the usefulness and\nmeaning of \"emotion\" as a scientific term.\nKeywords\naffection, emotion, definitions, history, passion, semantics\nAuthor note: I am grateful to the editor of this journal, to two anonymous readers, and to Emily Butterworth for their feedback on an earlier draft of this article, and to the\nWellcome Trust for a research grant awarded to Queen Mary, University of London, on the theme of \"Medicine, Emotion, and Disease in History.\"\nCorresponding author: Thomas Dixon, School of History, Queen Mary, University of London, London E1 4NS, UK.

I have divided this article into\nthree sections which correspond to three different dimensions of\nthose multiple meanings: categories, concepts, and connota-\ntions. By thinking about categories, we can investigate which\nmental states have been thought to fall into the category of\n\"emotion,\" and what alternative mental typologies have been\nused, especially those which made a fundamental distinction\nbetween \"passions\" and \"affections.\" Secondly, by looking at\nthe multiple concepts that have been named by the single term\n\"emotion,\" we can ask what theorists have intended to claim\nabout a mental or bodily state by calling it an \"emotion.\" From\nthe outset, there was ambiguity and confusion. Finally, in the\nrealm of connotations, we have access to those broader intel-\nlectual, linguistic, and disciplinary frameworks within which\nkeywords function. We will see that the different cultural terri-\ntories within which the words \"passions\" and \"emotions\" oper-\nated gave them different roles in the production of both mental\nexperiences and of psychological theories. These reflections on\nconnotation will pave the way for some brief concluding\nthoughts on \"emotion\" as a term in both everyday and scientific\nlanguage in the 21st century, and the morals we can draw from\nhistory.\nCategories\nThe first books written on the subject of \"the emotions\" appeared\nalists, and theologians generally used more than one term with\nwhich to theorise about mental states which would later be des-\nignated \"emotions.\" Theorists distinguished especially between\n\"passions\" on the one hand and \"affections\" on the other. In 1836\nthe English polymath William Whewell commented that the pro-\nposal to refer to what he called \"the desires and affections\" of\nhuman nature as \"the Emotions\" had not been generally accepted.\nEven as late as 1862, Whewell was expressing his preference for\nthe compound phrase \"the desires and affections,\" while\nacknowledging that the term \"emotional\" had been adopted by\nsome recent writers (Whewell footnotes to Mackintosh, 1862,\nIn order to understand this all-important distinction between\ntroubling desires and passions on the one hand and milder affec-\ntions and sentiments on the other, we need to look back briefly\nto ancient debates between Stoicism and Christianity. An analy-\nsis of works by two of the most influential medieval Christian\ntheologians, Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas, reveals\nthat it was their desire to provide an alternative to the moral\nphilosophy of the Greek and Roman Stoics that led to their crea-\ntion of the distinction between passions and affections (Dixon,\n2003). The Stoics had famously treated all the passions as dis-\neases of the soul, from which the wise man could be cured by\nthe application of calm reason. When the Stoic sage felt the\n\"first movements\" of a passion stirring with him, he was advised\nto withhold his assent from the judgement underlying that incip-\nient passion, thus retaining his composure and peace of mind,\nhis apatheia. The Stoics aimed thus to use a kind of cognitive\ntherapy to remain free of passions and perturbations of the\nmind, while still being able to enjoy milder positive feelings\nThe response of Augustine and Aquinas to this Stoic view\nwas twofold. In one way, they agreed with the Stoics: The pas-\nsions were indeed violent forces that could conflict with reason\nand lead an individual into sin. But, on the other hand, they did\nnot agree that a state of complete Stoic apatheia was one to be\nwished for. As Augustine put it, someone who no longer trem-\nbled from fear or suffered from sorrow would not have won true\npeace, but would rather have lost all humanity (Augustine,\n1966, XIV.9). It was important for theologians to be able to dis-\ntinguish between those troubling movements of the soul--appe-\ntites, lusts, desires, passions--that the good Christian should\navoid, and those more virtuous and Godly affections of love and\ncompassion to which they might rightly aspire. For Aquinas, the\npassions and affections were movements of two different parts\nof the soul, namely the sense appetite and the intellectual\nappetite respectively. The latter was another term for the will.\nThis distinction between passions of the sense appetite and\naffections of the intellectual appetite, although interpreted vari-\nously by different theorists and only rarely elaborated in detail,\nundergirded moral-philosophical thought for many centuries.\nThe distinction was explicitly discussed in several philosophical\nabout religious affections by the American preacher and phi-\nlosopher Jonathan Edwards emphasised that affections were\nmovements of the intellectual part of the soul:\nHoly affections are not heat without light, but evermore arise from some\ninformation of the understanding, some spiritual instruction that the mind\nThe 18th century saw a proliferation of new ideas about senti-\nments and sensibility, as well as about passions and affections.\nBut in almost all theoretical works, the various feelings and\nemotions of the human heart and intellect were understood to\nfall into at least two categories: the more violent and self-\nregarding \"passions\" and \"appetites\" on the one hand, and the\nmilder and more enlightened \"interests,\" social \"affections,\"\nand \"moral sentiments\" on the other (DeJean, 1997; Dixon,\nand affections of the mind composed in the early 19th century\nby the physician and philosopher Thomas Cogan restated the\nsemantic distinction between passions and affections, noting\nthat in common usage the word \"passion\" was often applied to\n\"the evil propensities,\" while \"affection\" was used for the \"vir-\ntuous propensities; as the social, friendly, parental, filial affec-\nWhewell was expressing his preference for the compound\nphrase \"the desires and affections.\"\nThis more differentiated typology was lost with the rise of the\ncapacious new category of \"emotion\" during the 19th century.\nThe key figure in this transition was the Edinburgh professor of\nmoral philosophy Thomas Brown, whom I have previously des-\nBrown subsumed the \"appetites,\" \"passions,\" and \"affections\"\nunder a single category: the \"emotions.\" The word \"emotion\"\nwas already in wide usage, but in Brown's lectures, first pub-\nlished in 1820, the term took on a newly systematic theoretical\nrole in the science of the mind. This innovation proved to be\npopular. In arguably the first modern psychological book about\nthe emotions, the incredibly wide reach of the new category was\nmade explicit: \"Emotion is the name here used to comprehend\nall that is understood by feelings, states of feeling, pleasures,\npains, passions, sentiments, affections\" (Bain, 1859, p. 3). Two\nfeeling states that fell into the category. How could anyone pos-\nsibly devise a single theory, or a simple conceptual definition,\nthat could cover such a wide range of different mental states?\nThe answer is that no one could.\nConcepts\nThe word \"emotion\" first arrived on British shores from France\nin the early 17th century. John Florio, the translator of Michel de\nMontaigne's celebrated essays, apologised to his readers for the\nintroduction of various \"uncouth termes\" from French into his\nEnglish version of the work, including among them the word\n\"emotion\" (de Montaigne, 1603, p. v). In both its French and\nEnglish forms, \"emotion\" was a word denoting physical distur-\nbance and bodily movement. It could mean a commotion among\na group of people (as in the phrase \"public emotion\"), or a phys-\nical agitation of anything at all, from the weather, or a tree, to\nIncreasingly, during the 18th century, \"emotion\" came to\nrefer to the bodily stirrings accompanying mental feelings. The\nStoic idea of \"first movements,\" those physical stirrings that\nmarked the onset of a passion, was sometimes referred to with\nthe phrase \"first emotions of passion,\" as it was in a sermon\npreached before the queen of England in 1711 on the subject of\n\"The government of passion\" and also in Fielding's 1749 novel\nVol. 2, p. 306). And for some medical and philosophical writers,\nthe term \"emotion\" was reserved for those bodily movements\nwhich served as the external signs of inward passions and affec-\nbody are received, and with reason, as probable indications of\ncentury by Cogan (1802), who insisted that the term \"emotions\"\nwas properly applicable only to those \"sensible changes and vis-\nible effects which particular passions produce upon the frame\"\n(1802, pp. 7\u00ad8). This idea, that emotions were external and vis-\nible effects, also explains why the term \"sensible\" (meaning\noutwardly observable) was so frequently applied to the term\nFinally, from the mid-18th century onwards, \"emotion\"\nmoved from the bodily to the mental domain. As early as 1649,\nDescartes had attempted to introduce the term \u00e9motion as an\nalternative to passion in his theoretical treatise on the passions\nnot generally followed, however, and the earliest works to make\nfrequent use of \"emotion\" as a term for feeling, passion, and\nrelated states of mind did not appear until about 100 years later,\nworks by two central figures of the Scottish Enlightenment,\nwere far from systematic, however. For them, as for many other\nwriters in the second half of the 18th century, \"emotion\" func-\ntioned either as an undefined and general term for any kind of\nmental feeling or agitation, or sometimes as a stylistic variant\nfor central theoretical terms such as \"passion\" and \"affection\"\nAs I have already indicated, it was in the early 19th-century\nlectures of another Scottish philosopher, Thomas Brown, that\nthe term \"emotion\" definitively took on its new status as a the-\noretical category in mental science, replacing those \"active\npowers\" of the mind, the \"passions\" and \"affections.\" Brown, a\nphysician and poet as well as a philosopher, was the first to\ntreat \"emotion\" as a major theoretical category in the academic\nstudy of the mind, and his use was the most systematic and\nmost influential of the period. Here, then, in the lecture halls of\narrive at the key moment in the history of our modern concepts\nof \"emotion.\"\nWhat, then, was the definition that Professor Brown ascribed\nto this important new theoretical term in mental science? \"The\nexact meaning of the term emotion,\" Brown told his students, \"it\nis difficult to state in any form of words.\" And it has remained\nso ever since. Brown did go a little further than this in trying to\noffer a definition of the \"emotions\":\nPerhaps, if any definition of them be possible, they may be defined to be\nvivid feelings, arising immediately from the consideration of objects,\nperceived, or remembered, or imagined, or from other prior emotions.\nIn other words, unlike sensations, which were caused directly\nby external objects, emotions were caused by the mental \"con-\nsideration\" of perceived objects; and, unlike intellectual states,\nthey were defined as noncognitive \"vivid feelings\" rather than\nas forms of thought.\nBrown's lectures exercised a very wide influence in the dec-\nhis statement that the term \"emotion\" was difficult to define\nexcept in terms of vividness of feeling. Although everyone\napparently knew what an \"emotion\" was, theorists agreed with\nBrown that this could not be embodied in any verbal definition\nstill living with this legacy of Thomas Brown's concept of\n\"emotion.\" Psychologists have continued to complain, at regu-\nlar intervals, right up to the present, that \"emotion\" is utterly\nhardly surprising for a term that, from the outset, was defined as\nbeing indefinable.\nDixon \"Emotion\": Keyword in Crisis 341\nBrown's was also a strongly noncognitive concept of \"emo-\ntion.\" His stark separation between intellectual thoughts and\nemotional feelings was endorsed by many of the leading psy-\ntwo-volume textbooks of psychology in which Volume 1 was\ndevoted to the senses and the intellect, and Volume 2 to the\nemotions, feelings, and will.\nBut Brown was not the only important early \"emotion\" theo-\nrist, and so his is not the only relevant legacy. A second key\nfigure was another Edinburgh physician and philosopher,\nCharles Bell. Bell was an important figure in the history of neu-\nrology and also the most influential 19th-century theorist of\nexpression before 1872, when Darwin published his work on\nthe subject. Bell's theories of emotion and expression, worked\nout in the successive editions of his essays on the anatomy and\nprovided foundations later built upon by both Darwin and\nJames. It is well known that Darwin argued strongly against the\ntheological notion in Bell's work that the muscles of the human\nface had been divinely designed to express the higher senti-\nments. What has only rarely been noticed, however, is that\nDarwin took his main theoretical principle of expression,\nnamely the idea of \"serviceable associated habits,\" directly\nSuch is Bell's importance, in fact, in this conceptual history\nthat it would be appropriate to think of him as the coinventor of\nthe modern \"emotions\" along with Brown. Where Brown was\nthe key theorist of \"emotions\" as vivid mental feelings with men-\ntal causes, in Bell's work we find a concept of \"emotion\" which\nfor the first time gave a constitutive role to bodily movements.\nFor Bell an \"emotion\" was a movement of the mind. His brief\ndefinition of the term was that \"emotions\" were \"certain changes\nor affections of the mind, as grief, joy, or astonishment,\" which\ncould become visible through \"outward signs\" on the face or\nbody (Bell, 1824, p. 19). The additional interest of Bell's work,\nhowever, is the importance he gave to bodily movements, espe-\ncially of the heart and lungs, as not only outward signs, but also\nas constitutive causes of emotional experience. He recognised\nthat the idea that the emotions might \"proceed from or in any\ndegree pertain to the body\" might not \"willingly be admitted\" by\nsuade them that the \"organs of breathing and speech\" were nec-\nessary not only to the \"expression\" of emotions, but also to their\n\"development.\" Bell pressed the point further, arguing that the\noperation of the organs of expression preceded \"the mental emo-\ntions with which they are to be joined,\" and strengthened and\ndirected them. He even argued that the reason that all people\nexperienced the same \"internal feelings and emotions or pas-\nsions\" was because of the uniform operation of the bodily organs\nfamous formulation, published six decades later, is very striking.\nW. James was certainly familiar with Bell's work, although only\nDarwin (1872) had also endorsed a similar view of the indis-\npensable role of bodily movements in a fully fledged emotion,\nsuggesting that: \"Most of our emotions are so closely connected\nwith their expression, that they hardly exist if the body remains\nIn Bell's works, then, we find the final piece of the jigsaw.\nHere was the source of the idea that the term \"emotion\" referred\nto mental states that necessarily had an outward bodily expres-\nsion, which additionally somehow constituted the emotion.\nTaken in combination with Brown's influential treatment of the\n\"emotions\" as a very broad category of noncognitive states of\nfeeling, we now have a clear picture of the origins of the late\n19th-century theories of emotion which have given rise to so\nmany conceptual and definitional problems. While Brown and\nBell agreed that an \"emotion\" was itself something mental,\nthey differed over whether its constituents were primarily men-\ntal or bodily. The tensions between these two models were\nnever fully resolved. Darwin and James were both influenced\nby these works produced in Edinburgh in the opening 2 dec-\nades of the 19th century. Darwin even studied medicine in\nEdinburgh briefly in the 1820s, and James stated that he spent\nhis youth immersed in philosophical works by Brown and by\nBrown's predecessor in the moral philosophy chair, Dugald\nhave debated what should be considered the true seat of the\nemotions: the soul or the body; the heart or the brain (Bound\nAlberti, 2010). In view of the importance of Brown and Bell in\nthis conceptual history, I would suggest that the true seat of the\n\"emotions\" was in fact the University of Edinburgh, circa 1820\nConnotations\nIt is appropriate that at this stage of the argument we should\nhave reached a conclusion about a particular institution and a\nparticular place. This reminds us that words do not operate in\nvacuums, but rather within lexical and social networks. Words\nderive their meanings from the company they keep, and that\napplies both to the other words they rub shoulders with, and to\nthe speakers, writers, and readers through whose minds, mouths,\nhands, and eyes they pass.\nThe semantic connotations that were lost by the transition\nfrom \"passions\" and \"affections\" to \"emotions\" in theories of\nthe human mind can all be grouped together under the unifying\ntheme of pathology: cognitive, medical, or moral (Dixon, 2006,\n2011). \"Passion\" and \"affection\" were both terms whose ety-\nmology and core meanings emphasised passivity, suffering, and\ndisease. For the Stoics, the passions had been diseases of the\nsoul, to be cured by cognitive therapy, and right up to the 19th\ncentury the terms \"passion\" and \"affection\" were used in medi-\ncal contexts as terms for organic disease. Passions and affec-\ntions of the mind, especially in their stronger forms, were also\nconsidered by physicians to constitute a constant threat to health\nand life. Since the key early \"emotion\" theorists, including\nBrown and Bell, were almost all trained medics, it is significant\nthat they chose to use a word for the vivid mental feelings which\ndetached them from this medical thought-world and its patho-\nlogical associations, bestowing to subsequent generations of\nmental philosophers and psychologists a newly de-medicalised\nQuestions of professional and disciplinary identity are also\ngermane to thinking about the detachment of \"emotion\" from the\nestablished languages of morality and religion. Many of the most\ninfluential theorists of \"passions\" and \"affections\" had been\nmoral philosophers, clergymen, or both. Preachers and theologi-\nans, as well as secular moralists, most often found themselves\ndiscoursing on these subjects in order to demonstrate the impor-\ntance of governing the passions and cultivating the affections.\nDuring the religious revivals of the 18th century, in which the\nfeelings and sympathies of the human heart were so important,\nspoke and wrote in the language of the Bible. The terms \"pas-\nsions,\" \"lusts,\" \"desires,\" and \"affections\" all had a biblical ped-\nigree. The term \"passion\" had an additional biblical association\nthrough its connection with the gospel accounts of the sufferings\nand death of Jesus of Nazareth. The terms \"emotion\" and \"emo-\ntions,\" by contrast, were detached from the linguistic worlds of\ntheology and moralism. They never appeared in any English\ntranslation of the Bible and, unlike the terms \"passion\" and \"pas-\nsions,\" were very unlikely to be paired with such moralising epi-\nthets as \"despicable,\" \"detestable,\" \"evil,\" \"perverted,\" or\nWhen modern uses of \"emotion\" and \"emotional\" emerged\nduring the 19th century, they connoted knowledge of and sym-\npathy with a modern and scientific approach to human mental\nlife. They were words which belonged within a secular, morally\nneutral, and scientific register. The linguistic shift from \"pas-\nsions\" and \"affections\" to \"emotions\" thus both reflected and\nenabled shifts in institutional and intellectual authority. By the\nend of the 19th century the view was on the rise in European and\nAmerican universities that a properly scientific account of the\nhuman mind would be produced only through a thoroughly\nphysiological investigation. Champions of this view explicitly\ncontrasted their work with the philosophical psychology of their\npredecessors (and contemporaries), which they believed was\nstill in thrall to theological, spiritual, and dualistic views of the\nhuman person.\nOne particularly able critic of the physiological tendency of\nmodern psychology in general, and of James's theory of emo-\ntion in particular, was David Irons. Irons argued in several arti-\nthat emotions were irreducible \"attitudes\" of the whole person\nthat Havelock Ellis's response to Irons attacked him not only for\nhis theoretical views, but for his ignorance of human physiology\nand his reliance on the tools of philosophy. Ellis wrote that the\nproblems of modern psychology required \"something more than\na merely logical equipment; they require a very considerable\nphysiological and even pathological equipment\" and that any-\none who could suggest, for instance, that melancholia lacked a\nphysical basis was evidently \"not competent to discuss the\nIn summary, the term \"emotion\" suited the purposes of a self-\nconsciously secularising and scientific cadre of psychological\ntheorists in the late 19th century, detached as it was from the\ncenturies of moral and theological connotations that had accrued\nto the terms \"passion\" and \"affection.\" \"Emotion,\" for progres-\nsives such as Ellis, was the name of a domain of scientific study\nfrom which mere philosophers were to be barred. Competence to\ndiscuss emotion now required a training in physiology. As\nW. James put it at the end of his 1884 Mind article, the truth or\nfalsity of his theory of emotion would be best determined not by\nlogical analysis, but by empirical investigations undertaken by\n\"asylum-physicians and nervous specialists\" who \"alone have\nConclusions\nSo, when W. James famously asked in 1884, \"What is an emo-\ntion?\" he was not engaging with an age-old conundrum, but was\nseeking to define a psychological category that had been in\nexistence only a couple of generations. James's answer to his\nown question, one which revealed his indebtedness to Brown,\nBell, and Darwin, was that emotions were vivid mental feelings\nof visceral changes brought about directly by the perception of\nsome object in the world.\nJames's theory had a curious early career. On the one hand,\nit became, along with the similar theory of the Danish psycholo-\ngist Carl F. Lange, the flagship emotion theory of the fledgling\nscience of psychology. On the other hand, the theory entirely\nfailed to create consensus among the psychological community\nexcept, perhaps, a consensus that it was wrong. Within 10 years\nof the publication of James's original theory it had been system-\natically rebutted in almost all the leading philosophical and psy-\nJames's theory failed to distinguish between emotions and non-\nemotions; that it failed to differentiate between the different\nemotions; that it gave excessive priority to feelings of bodily\nchange at the expense of other components of emotion; and that\nit unnecessarily denied the role played by cognitive and intel-\nlectual factors in generating emotion. James's article created\nfurther confusion by seeming to support several different claims\nabout whether all emotions had bodily expressions, or only\nsome, and whether this was a matter of definition, or of empiri-\nAfter ten years of rebuttals of his original theory, W. James\nduly published (1894) a restatement of his views on emotion,\nwhich included so many concessions and qualifications as to\namount virtually to a retraction of his own theory. So, by the\n1890s, although the idea that \"emotion\" was the name of a psycho-\nlogical category had become entrenched, the nascent psychologi-\ncal community had neither an agreed definition of the extent of the\ncategory, nor a shared idea of the fundamental characteristics of\nthe states that fell within it.\nThe founders of the discipline of psychology in the late 19th\ncentury bequeathed to their successors a usage of \"emotion\" in\nwhich the relationship between mind and body and between\nthought and feeling were confused and unresolved, and which\nnamed a category of feelings and behaviours so broad as to\ncover almost all of human mental life including, as Bain (1859)\nDixon \"Emotion\": Keyword in Crisis 343\nhad put it, all that was previously understood by the terms \"feel-\nings, states of feeling, pleasures, pains, passions, sentiments,\nThe survey undertaken recently by Izard (2010a) reveals that\npsychologists are still living with this legacy. On the basis of the\nreplies to his questionnaire, Izard put together a composite\ndescription of what contemporary emotion scientists mean by\n\"emotion.\" The most commonly cited features were summa-\nrised by Izard in one sentence:\nEmotion consists of neural circuits (that are at least partially dedicated),\nresponse systems, and a feeling state/process that motivates and\nIzard emphasised that this was not meant to be a definition of\n\"emotion,\" but a description of the dominant uses. Nonetheless,\nit indicates well enough the challenges that still face theorists of\n\"emotion,\" especially the need somehow to articulate the\nassumed relationships between physiological processes and\nmental experiences, and between states of feeling and states of\nthought. Among those philosophical and psychological writers\nof the 19th century (and before) whose works have been\nexcluded from the canon of the history of psychology, but who\nresisted the conglomeration of \"passions\" and \"affections\" into\n\"emotions,\" who argued for the centrality of the intellect and\ncognition to states of feeling, and who connected psychology\nmost closely to philosophy and ethics rather than to physiology,\nsome clues may still be found as to what went wrong in the\nconstruction of modern concepts of \"emotion\" in psychology\nIn the debate about whether \"emotion\" can today function as a\nscientific term, its semantic and conceptual history is, it seems to\nme, relevant if not decisive. On the question of whether \"emotion\"\nis a \"folk\" or \"everyday\" term rather than a scientific one, there is\na clear historical story to tell. \"Emotion\" has existed as a normal\nEnglish-language term for physical agitation since the 17th cen-\ntury. It gradually started to be applied, in an undefined and general\nway, to states of mental feeling during the 18th century. So, when\nBrown and others adopted it as a term of mental science, they were\nadopting an everyday term and giving it a new theoretical role. As\nBrown himself put it: \"Every person understands what is meant by\n20th centuries, this previously \"everyday\" word became a scien-\ntific term used in technical ways not only in psychology, but also\nin medicine, sociology, and anthropology. The final stage of this\nsemantic history has been the popularisation of ideas about \"emo-\ntional intelligence,\" \"emotional literacy,\" and \"emotional well-\nbeing,\" which have themselves virtually become \"everyday\"\nphrases. This process has seen scientific ideas about \"emotion\" and\nthe \"emotional\" becoming widely spread through popular culture\nand politics, in a way that has traded on the scientific, psychological,\nand medical authority of that language.\nThis complex cultural history of \"emotion,\" especially its\nrather recent, haphazard, contested, and gradual emergence as\nan English-language psychological category in the first half of\nthe 19th century, does not strongly suggest that \"emotion\" is\nlikely to name either a natural kind or any kind of innate or\nWierzbicka, 2010). On the other hand, it may be that psychol-\nogy is not the kind of science that deals in natural kinds or innate\nconcepts. If the science of emotion is supposed to provide an\nexplanation of a widely experienced kind of mental state, and in\nterms that can be communicated to the general public, then it\nmight be better to stick with the complexity, fuzziness, and\noverinclusivity of \"emotion\" than to retreat still further from the\nworld of everyday concerns into new scientific jargons.\nLet me end, however, on a constructive note, by suggesting a\nthird way between the retention of the problematic metacate-\ngory of \"emotion\" and its abandonment in favour of studies of\ndiscrete feeling states such as love, anger, fear, and the rest. In\nthe conclusion of my 2003 book on this subject I was rather\ntimid and suggested that the \"old-fashioned terminology of pas-\nsions and affections\" was unlikely to \"find favour in future psy-\nthat the definitional crisis in \"emotion\" theories has reached a\nnew peak, the time has come to reinstate in psychological sci-\nence some version of that distinction between \"passions\" and\n\"affections\" which structured modern thought about mind and\nmorality for so many centuries. Among philosophers of emo-\noverinclusivity of the modern category of \"emotion\" and argued\nthat it should be divided into two subcategories: the more prim-\nitive \"affect programs\" and the \"higher cognitive emotions\" (cf.\nphy are taken on board, then, it is just possible that the ideas of\nAugustine and Aquinas might yet turn out to be just what is\nneeded to inspire a new scientific paradigm of emotions research\nfor the 21st century.\nReferences\nAnnas, J.

    "reduced_content": "Emotion Review\ner.sagepub.com\n\"Emotion\" has, since 1884, been a theoretical keyword at the\nheart of modern psychology. In that year William James wrote an\ninfluential article in Mind entitled \"What Is an Emotion?\" A cen-\ntury and a quarter later, however, there seems to be little scientific\nconsensus on the answer to his question, and some are beginning\nto wonder whether it is the very category of \"emotion\" that is the\nproblem.\nIzard's (2010a) interviews with leading emotion scientists,\ntogether with responses from other experts, powerfully demon-\nstrate that, despite the continuing proliferation of books, jour-\nnals, conferences, and theories on the subject of \"emotion,\"\nthere is still no consensus on the meaning of this term. Some\neven believe that it should be thrown out of psychology alto-\ngether. Among the scientists surveyed by Izard, there was mod-\nerate support for the view that the term \"emotion\" is \"ambiguous\nand has no status in science,\" and that it should therefore be\nword in modern psychology, but it is a keyword in crisis. Indeed,\nas I shall suggest below, it has been in crisis, from a definitional\nand conceptual point of view, ever since its adoption as a\npsychological category in the 19th century.\nIzard's recent article and several of the responses to it (White,\nabout the language of \"emotion\": whether it forms part of a uni-\nversal human \"folk psychology,\" whether it is part of \"ordinary\nlanguage\" in English, and whether, in light of the answers to\nthese questions, it can be expected to operate as part of a truly\nscientific lexicon. An historical perspective can help to answer\nthese questions.\nHistorians have long recognised the importance of keywords\nas both mirrors and motors of social and intellectual change\nrealms of culture and thought, where new words, or new mean-\nings attached to old ones, can create new concepts, and even\nnew worldviews, which in turn transform people's ability to\nimagine, experience, and understand themselves. Psychological\ncategories and concepts in particular have this reflexive rela-\ntionship with our mental lives, shaping and colouring as well as\ntory of the term \"emotion\" as a keyword of just this kind is both\nshorter and more eventful than its modern users might imagine.\nAlthough the word \"emotion\" (imported into English from the\nFrench \u00e9motion) was in use in the 17th and 18th centuries, it did\nnot become established as the name for a category of mental\nstates that might be systematically studied until the mid-19th\ncentury. The present article uses the intellectual history of this\nterm to offer an historical diagnosis of the contemporary defini-\ntional malaise, and to offer a reminder of some of the ideas\nabout passions, affections, and emotions that have been forgot-\nten during the last two centuries.\n\"Emotion\": The History of a Keyword in Crisis\nThomas Dixon\nSchool of History, Queen Mary, University of London, UK"
