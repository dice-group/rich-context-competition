    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Although postmenopausal vulvar pain is frequently attributed to vaginal atrophy, such symptoms may\nbe due to vulvodynia, a chronic vulvar pain condition. Given the limited research on vulvodynia in postmenopausal\nwomen, the objective of this study was to provide preliminary population-based data on the associations of vaginal\nsymptoms, serum hormone levels and hormone use with chronic vulvar pain in a multiethnic sample of\npost-menopausal women.\nMethods: We used data from 371 participants at the Michigan site of the Study of Women's Health Across the\nNation (SWAN) who participated in the 13th follow-up visit. Women completed a validated screening instrument\nfor vulvodynia and provided information on additional vaginal symptoms as well as demographic characteristics,\nand hormone use by questionnaire. Blood samples were obtained to assess hormone levels. We compared women\nwho screened positive for vulvodynia and women with past or short-duration vulvar pain to women without vulvar\npain, using Chi-squared and Fisher's Exact tests. Relative odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated\nusing multinomial logistic regression models adjusting for age, body mass index, and race/ethnicity.\nResults: Current chronic vulvar pain consistent with vulvodynia was reported by 4.0 % of women, while 13.7 %\nreported past but not current chronic vulvar pain or short-duration vulvar pain symptoms. One quarter of women\nwho reported current chronic vulvar pain did not report vaginal dryness. Women with current chronic and with\npast/short duration vulvar pain symptoms were more likely to have used hormones during the preceding year\nthan women without vulvar pain symptoms (13.3 %, 17.6 %, 2.0 %, respectively; p < .01). Increased relative odds\nof current vulvar pain symptoms were associated with each log unit decrease in serum dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate,\nestradiol and testosterone levels at the previous year's visit.\nConclusion: Some women who experience chronic vulvar pain symptoms do not report vaginal dryness, and others\nreport continued or first onset of pain while using hormones. Vulvodynia should be considered in the differential\ndiagnosis of postmenopausal women presenting with vulvar pain symptoms.\nBackground\nAlthough vulvar pain symptoms can occur at any time\nover the life span, it is not uncommon for symptoms to\nbegin for the first time after menopause [1\u00ad3]. In fact,\nthe prevalence of chronic vulvar pain in mid-life women\nhas been estimated to be 8.9-38 % percent, making\nchronic vulvar pain a major health concern for women\nin this age group [4, 5]. However, despite recognition of\nthe burden of chronic vulvar pain symptoms in the mid-\nlife, research on vulvodynia, a chronic pain condition\ncharacterized by pain in the vulva, has mainly focused\non premenopausal women [1, 2].\nUntil recently, research on postmenopausal vulvar pain\nsymptoms has largely focused on vaginal dryness and\nvulvar atrophy, secondary to estrogen deprivation. How-\never, evidence indicates that postmenopausal vulvar pain\nmay occur for other reasons as well [6\u00ad9]. Additionally,\nwomen with atrophy do not all experience pain [7], epi-\nsodes of postmenopausal vulvar pain are not all success-\nfully treated using estrogen therapy [8, 9], and in a\n* Correspondence: harlow@umich.edu\n1Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, 1415 Washington\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2016 The Author(s).

These findings suggest that\nsome vulvar pain reported by postmenopausal women\nmay be a condition other than atrophy, such as vulvody-\nnia, and present independent of estrogen-or atrophy-\nrelated changes.\nThis paper evaluates chronic vulvar pain reported by\nAfrican American and white women participating in the\nMichigan site of the longitudinal, multiethnic Study of\nWomen's Health Across the Nation (SWAN). Although\nthe sample size is limited, prospective measurements of\nage at final menstrual period, symptoms of vaginal dry-\nness, and hormone therapy (HT) use, as well as serum\nhormone levels obtained prior to the assessment of\ncurrent pain status, provide preliminary data on the esti-\nmated prevalence of chronic vulvar pain, consistent with\nvulvodynia in post-menopausal women and its associ-\nation with hormones, HT use and vaginal dryness in this\npopulation-based sample of postmenopausal women.\nMethods\nThis study used data from the Michigan site of SWAN,\na multiethnic prospective cohort study addressing\nhealth-related changes in the midlife and menopausal\ntransition. The cohort has been described in detail previ-\nenrolled white women and one targeted minority popu-\nlation. The Michigan SWAN population, established\nusing a community census, was composed of women\naged 42\u00ad52 years at baseline, who were not using ex-\nogenous hormones at the time of enrollment, had an in-\ntact uterus and at least one ovary and had had a\nmenstrual period in the three months before enrollment,\nwere not pregnant or lactating, and self-identified as ei-\nther white or African American. At baseline and each\nfollow-up visit a blood sample was collected, height and\nweight measures were taken while demographic charac-\nteristics, medication use, and symptoms of vaginal dry-\nness were ascertained by questionnaire. Over the next\n17 years women participated in follow-up visits approxi-\nMichigan site added several screening instruments for\nchronic pain conditions including a validated screening\ninstrument for vulvodynia [11].\nAt baseline, the Michigan SWAN cohort was com-\nup Visit 13. Nine women who did not answer any ques-\ntions pertaining to vulvar pain were excluded, leaving\nanalysis. For analyses including endogenous serum\nhormone levels, we evaluated hormone levels at Visit 12,\nto ensure hormone levels preceded the report of vulvar\npain status at Visit 13. These analyses include 319\nwomen as we excluded the 37 women who did not have\nblood drawn and the 15 women who reported HT use at\nEthics and consent\nThis study was approved by Health Sciences and Behav-\nioral Sciences Institutional Review Board of the University\nformed consent at baseline and each follow-up interview.\nIn Visit 13, Michigan participants completed a vali-\ndated screening questionnaire for vulvodynia [11] that\nobtained information on symptoms of vulvar pain or dis-\ncomfort, including date of pain onset, duration of pain,\nand whether pain continues. We interpret a positive\nscreen in this postmenopausal population to be consist-\nent with vulvodynia but acknowledge that this screening\ntool may not adequately differentiate vulvodynia from\natrophy in this postmenopausal cohort. Therefore we\nuse the term \"chronic vulvar pain\" in lieu of vulvodynia\nwhen presenting the results.\nBased on responses to the vulvodynia questionnaire,\neach participant was categorized into one of three\ngroups: women with current chronic (lasting 3 months\nor longer) vulvar pain, women who reported ever having\nchronic vulvar pain in the past or reported having short-\nduration (less than 3 months duration) vulvar pain\nsymptoms, and women reporting no current or past vul-\nvar pain symptoms. Current chronic vulvar pain was de-\nfined by a history of vulvar pain or discomfort at the\nopening to the vagina that had lasted for at least three\nmonths and had been experienced in the preceding three\nmonths. The past chronic vulvar pain/short-duration\nvulvar pain symptom group included women who had a\nhistory of vulvar pain lasting for at least three months\nbut who had not experienced pain in the preceding three\nmonths and women with current vulvar pain lasting for\nless than three months. This group represents a hetero-\ngeneous symptomatic group who, based on prior work\n[12], are more likely than the non-symptomatic group to\ndevelop vulvodynia, and hence we categorize them sep-\narately from the no pain group.\nAge was modeled as a continuous variable. Race/ethni-\ncity was self-reported as either white or African Ameri-\ncan. Measured height and weight were used to calculate\nbody mass index (BMI) (weight in kilograms (kg) divided\nby height in meters (m) squared). BMI was further cate-\ngorized as normal weight, overweight, or obese (<25,\nassessed by self-reported difficulty paying for basics (very\nhard versus somewhat or not hard) and education at\nbaseline (high school or less versus at least some\ncollege). Marital status was categorized as either married\nor not married.\nIn addition to questions about vulvar pain, we asked\nabout other specific vulvovaginal symptoms at Visit 13\nincluding self-reported number of days in the past\n2 weeks of vaginal dryness, soreness, and irritation cate-\ngorized into three duration levels (0 days, 1\u00ad5 days, or\n>6 days). In addition, we created variables to reflect\nwhether women ever reported vaginal dryness before,\nand after, the final menstrual period (FMP) or hysterec-\ntomy (yes/no) based on responses at each follow-up visit.\nAlthough women were not eligible to enroll in SWAN ff\nthey were using HT, women who began using HT after\nenrollment remained in the study. Two HT variables\nwere considered: current HT use (yes/no), and ever used\nHT during the study (yes/no).\nAt each visit, a fasting blood sample was collected,\nrefrigerated for 1\u00ad2 h after collection, and then centri-\nfuged. Serum hormone levels of estradiol (E2), dehydro-\nepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S), follicle stimulating\nhormone (FSH), sex hormone-binding globuliN (SHBG),\nand testosterone (T) were determined.\nAll assays were performed on the ACS-180 automated\nanalyzer (Bayer Diagnostics Corporation, Tarrytown,\nNY) at the CLASS laboratory at the University of Mich-\nigan, utilizing a double-antibody chemiluminescent im-\nmunoassay with a solid phase anti-IgG immunoglobulin\nconjugated to paramagnetic particles, anti-ligand anti-\nbody, and competitive ligand labeled with dimethylacri-\ndinium ester (DMAE). The FSH assay is a modification\nof a manual assay kit (Bayer Diagnostics) utilizing two\nmonoclonal antibodies directed to different regions on\nthe beta subunit, with a lower limit of detection (LLD)\nof 1.05 mIU/mL. Inter-and intra-assay coefficients of\nassay modifies the rabbit anti-E2-6 ACS-180 immuno-\nassay to increase sensitivity, with a LLD of 1.0 pg/mL\nand inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation aver-\naging 10.6 % and 6.4 %, respectively. The T assay modi-\nfies the rabbit polyclonal anti-T ACS-180 immunoassay,\nwith a LLD of 2.19 ng/dL and inter-and intra-assay coef-\nficients of variation of 10.5 % and 8.5 %, respectively.\nThe DHEA-S and SHBG assays were developed using\nrabbit anti-DHEA-S and anti-SHBG antibodies, with\nDHEA-S, the inter- and intra-assay coefficient of vari-\nation were 11.3 % and 8.0 %, respectively. For SHBG, the\ninter- and intra-assay coefficient of variation were 9.9 %\nand 6.1 %, respectively. Duplicate E2 assays were con-\nducted, with results reported as the arithmetic mean for\neach subject, with a CV of 3-12 %. All other assays were\nsingle determinations. Hormone levels below the lower\nlimit of detection were assigned a random number be-\ntween 0 and the lower limit of detection.\nThe prevalence of vulvar symptoms overall and strati-\nfied by demographic characteristics were calculated and\ncompared using Chi-squared and Fisher's Exact tests as\nappropriate. Hormone levels were log-transformed for\nregression analyses. The median values of the log-\ntransformed E2, DHEA-S, SHBG, FSH, and T at Visit 12\nwere compared overall and across symptoms groups\nusing Kruskal-Wallis tests. Relative odds ratios (OR) and\n95 % confidence intervals (CI) comparing the current\nchronic vulvar pain and past/short-duration vulvar pain\ngroups to the no vulvar pain group were calculated using\nmultinomial logistic regression models appropriate for\noutcomes with more than two categories [13]. These\nmodels compare odds for reporting current chronic vul-\nvar pain symptoms in relation to the no pain category\nand odds for reporting past/short-term vulvar pain\nsymptoms in relation to the no pain category. In\naddition to an unadjusted model, models adjusted for\nrace, BMI, and age were also assessed. Analyses were\nperformed using SAS 9.3 (Cary, NC).\nResults\nAt follow-up Visit 13, participants ranged in age from 56\nreporting current chronic vulvar pain, one did not pro-\nvide an age of symptom onset, four experienced symp-\ntom onset before age 45, two experienced onset between\nage 46 and 55, and the remaining 8 experienced onset\nported first onset since their previous follow-up visit,\nrepresenting an incidence of 1.3 %.\nMedian age, marital status, and proportion sexually ac-\ntive in the previous 6 months did not differ by chronic\nvulvar pain status (Table 1). However, women with\ncurrent chronic vulvar pain were more likely to be white,\nless likely to be obese, and more likely to have com-\npleted at least some college compared to women in the\nother vulvar pain groups (Table 1).\nAlthough few women reported current HT use, both\nthe current chronic and past/short-duration vulvar pain\ngroups were more likely than women with no vulvar\npain symptoms to report having used HT during the\npreceding year (Table 1). Women with past/short-dur-\nation vulvar pain were more likely to have ever used HT\nand more likely to have had a hysterectomy than women\nin the other two groups (Table 1). Two of the 15 women\nwith current symptoms (13.3 %) began HT after pain on-\nset but did not report remission while 3 of the 32\nwomen with current or past chronic vulvar pain\nTable 1 Demographic and clinical characteristics of women in the MI SWAN population, by self-reported vulvar pain\nTotal Current Chronic Vulvar Pain Past/Short-term Vulvar Pain No Vulvar Pain\nVariable N (%) n (%) n (%) n (%) p-value6\nCurrently Use HT < .01\nHistory of Hysterectomy .21\nUrogenital Symptoms in previous 2 weeks\nHistory of Reported Dryness\nDry Before FMP/Hysterectomy5 .46\nsymptoms (9.4 %) reported first onset of vulvar pain\nwhile taking HT.\nPrevalences of self-reported dryness, soreness, and/or ir-\nritation were lowest in the no vulvar pain symptoms group\nand highest in the current chronic vulvar pain group\n(Table 1). However, although over half of women with\ncurrent vulvar pain indicated they had \"dryness\" for over\n6 days in the past 2 weeks, approximately a quarter\n(26.7 %) of women with current vulvar pain did not report\nvaginal dryness. Similarly, although reporting of \"soreness\"\nor \"irritation\" was most frequent in women with current\nchronic vulvar pain, over half of the women with current\nchronic vulvar pain did not report soreness or irritation.\nIn the multinomial logistic regression models adjusted\nfor race, odds of having current chronic vulvar pain\nsymptoms were significantly elevated in white women,\ncurrent HT users, and individuals reporting dryness,\nsoreness, or irritation for 6 or more days in the preced-\ning 2 weeks (Table 2). Odds of past/short-duration vul-\nvar pain symptoms were significantly elevated in white\nwomen, current and past HT users, women who had\nhad a hysterectomy, and individuals reporting vaginal ir-\nritation 1\u00ad5 days in the previous 2 weeks. Adjusting the\nlogistic models for age or BMI did not substantially alter\nresults (data not shown).\nAt Visit 12, median serum hormone levels of E2 and\nDHEA-S tended to be lower (p = 0.06) in women who sub-\nsequently reported current chronic vulvar pain symptoms\nat Visit 13 compared to those who reported no vulvar\nsymptoms (Table 3). The unadjusted relative odds of\ncurrent chronic vulvar pain symptoms versus no vulvar\nsymptoms at Visit 13 were elevated with each log unit de-\ncrease in Visit 12 E2, DHEA-S, and T levels (Table 4).\nAfter adjustment for age, race and BMI, the odds remained\nelevated only for DHEA-S and T. FSH and SHBG levels\nwere not associated with chronic vulvar pain. In an ex-\nploratory analysis we evaluated longitudinal endocrine pat-\nterns prior to pain onset in the five women reporting new\nonset chronic pain symptoms at visit 13. From Visit 10 to\nVisit 12, three of the five experienced a sharp drop in E2\nlevels (defined < =15 % of the Visit 10 level at Visit 12) as\nDiscussion\nPostmenopausal women are as likely as younger women\nto report chronic vulvar pain consistent with vulvodynia\n[4, 14, 15]. This study is one of the first population-\nbased studies to examine the association between symp-\ntoms of vaginal dryness, serum hormone levels, hor-\nmone use and chronic vulvar pain symptoms in\npostmenopausal women. We found that women with\ncurrent chronic vulvar pain symptoms often experienced\npain onset prior to menopause. Women with current\nchronic pain were more likely than women without such\npain symptoms to be using HT, and some reported the\nonset of vulvar pain symptoms while already taking HT.\nDespite the possibility of inadequate hormonal treatment\nin some cases, vulvar pain unresponsive to HT further\nsupports the presence of a chronic pain condition such\nas vulvodynia that is likely to require alternative, non-\nhormonal, treatment modalities. Notably, more than a\nquarter of women who reported current chronic vulvar\npain did not report vaginal dryness, a common com-\nplaint associated with vaginal atrophy. Lower average\nDHEA-S, and T levels prior to ascertainment of vulvar\npain symptoms were associated with elevated odds of\nsubsequently reporting chronic vulvar pain, further sup-\nporting that for some, hormonal levels may contribute\nto symptoms experienced. These results provide add-\nitional evidence that chronic vulvar pain in postmeno-\npausal women has a heterogeneous etiology and, in many\nwomen, may not be explained by estrogen deficiency-\nIn this sample of postmenopausal women, the preva-\nlence and incidence of chronic vulvar pain was some-\nwhat lower than that observed in other studies. One\nprevious study reported prevalences in women age 40\u00ad\nand had not used HT, respectively [4, 5], and an inci-\ndence of approximately 3.3 per 100 person-years in\nwomen age 50 and older [16]. A second paper reported\na prevalence of vulvovaginal symptoms suggestive of at-\nlence of chronic vulvar pain reported in this study\nreflects the large proportion of African Americans who\nhave been shown to be less likely than white women to\nreport chronic vulvar pain. Vulvodynia is more prevalent\nin white women than African American women in most\nlence reported here also reflects the older average age of\nthe study population, as previous reports have indicated\nthat vulvodynia prevalence and incidence decline with\nTable 1 Demographic and clinical characteristics of women in the MI SWAN population, by self-reported vulvar pain (Continued)\nDry After FMP/Hysterectomy5 .01\n6All p-values calculated using Chi-squared tests except BMI, Difficulty Paying for Basics, Currently Use HT, Vaginal Dryness, Vaginal Soreness, and Vaginal Irritation,\nwhich were calculated using Fisher's Exact test\nTable 3 Serum hormone levels (median and interquartile range (IQR)) at Visit 12 for all women not using hormonal therapy, by self-\nreported vulvar pain symptoms at Visit 13\nTotal Current Chronic\nVulvar Pain\nPast/Short-term\nVulvar Pain\nNo Vulvar Pain\nVariable Median (IQR) Median (IQR) Median (IQR) Median (IQR) p-value\nHormones (log transformed)\nTable 2 Relative odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for selected variables, adjusted for race\nCurrent Chronic Vulvar Pain vs none Past/Short-term Vulvar Pain vs none\nCategorical BMI\nCurrently Use HT\nNo REF \u00ad REF \u00ad\nEver Use HT\nNo REF \u00ad REF \u00ad\nSexually Active in Last 6 months.\nNo REF \u00ad REF \u00ad\nHysterectomy\nNo REF \u00ad REF \u00ad\nVaginal Dryness\n0 days REF \u00ad REF \u00ad\nVaginal Soreness\n0 days REF \u00ad REF \u00ad\nVaginal Irritation\n0 days REF \u00ad REF \u00ad\nage, especially if those not having sexual intercourse are\nincluded in the analysis [4, 16].\nPrevious research has suggested that a drop in estro-\ngen may be associated with onset of chronic vulvar pain\nthat will not necessarily be reversed by subsequent estro-\ngen supplementation [8]. We observed that lower levels\nof E2, DHEA-S, and T were associated with increased\nodds of reporting current chronic vulvar pain, although\nonly DHEA-S and T remained significant after adjust-\nment. When we evaluated longitudinal endocrine pat-\nterns prior to pain onset only in the five women\nreporting new onset chronic pain symptoms at visit 13,\nthree of the five had experienced a prior sharp drop in\nE2 levels compared to just five percent of women with\nno symptoms. Although consistent with the theory that\na variable hormonal environment may contribute to\nchronic vulvar pain, we observed only a small number of\nnew onset cases. Further study of the relationship be-\ntween longitudinal endocrine patterns and risk for\nchronic vulvar pain is warranted.\nLower DHEA-S levels at visit 12 were associated with\nhigher odds of reporting current chronic vulvar pain\nsymptoms, a finding that should be explored in future\nstudies. An association between low DHEAS and sexual\ndysfunctioN (as measured by the Female Sexual Func-\ntion Index) [18] and a weak association of serum andro-\ngens and sexual well-being in women with premature\novarian failure have been reported [19]. However, a\nmechanism to explain a direct relationship between\nDHEAS and vulvar symptoms is unclear. The topical ap-\nplication of DHEA to the vagina in women with severe\natrophy has been reported to improve all domains of\nsexual function, including pain with sexual activity, in\ncontrolled clinical trials [20\u00ad22], potentially due to local\nconversion to androgens and estrogens. Future studies\nare needed to confirm and further assess these findings.\nThis study adds to the literature indicating that post-\nmenopausal vulvar pain may be caused by factors other\nnot always prevent symptom onset and was not associated\nwith symptom remission in all women. However, as the\nvulvodynia screening instrument was administered at only\nVisit 13, timing of vulvar pain onset was ascertained by\nretrospective report. Also, information on details of HT\nsuch as dose, route of administration, indication and dur-\nation of use was limited or unavailable; thus, we are not\nable to assess adequacy of treatment for presumed estro-\ngen deficiency. However, those with vulvar pain symptoms\nsecondary to atrophy who had been adequately treated\nwith estrogen would not be included in the chronic vulvar\npain group\u00adhence only those with persistent symptoms\ndespite hormone therapy, and those with persistent symp-\ntoms who have not taken HT, were included in the\nchronic vulvar pain group.\nThis analysis was constrained by the limited sample\nsize, particularly the small number of women with\ncurrent vulvar pain symptoms meeting our screening\ncriteria. As a categorization of chronic pain requires a\nminimum duration of three months and categorization\nas a past case depends on participant recall, it is possible\nthat some participants forgot to report past episodes,\nthus attenuating the findings. Nonetheless, a unique\nstrength of this study is the availability of longitudinal\ndata on HT use, serum hormone levels, and self-reports\nof vaginal dryness in postmenopausal women within a\ndefined timeframe after the final menstrual period per-\nmitting a more detailed, though preliminary, look at the\nrelationship between vaginal symptoms, hormone levels\nand vulvar pain in a population-based, multi-ethnic sam-\nple of midlife women. Future studies might consider\nevaluation of additional pain symptoms such as dyspar-\neunia in relation to reporting of chronic vulvar pain.\nConclusion\nThis preliminary but rich longitudinal population-based\nstudy adds to the growing literature suggesting that\nTable 4 Relative odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for having chronic vulvar pain by log-transformed serum\nhormone levels at Visit 12 among women not using hormones\nHormone (log) Unadjusted Model Adjusted Model*\nCurrent Chronic Vulvar\nPain vs none\nPast/Short-term Chronic\nPain vs none\nCurrent Chronic Vulvar\nPain vs none\nPast/Short-term Vulvar\nPain vs none\n* adjusted for age, categorical BMI, and race\nvulvar atrophy may not be the sole cause of postmeno-\npausal vulvar pain. Postmenopausal women may be ex-\nperiencing new onset, exacerbated and/or long-term\nchronic vulvar pain consistent with a diagnosis of vulvo-\ndynia. Health care providers should consider and evaluate\nfor vulvodynia when treating postmenopausal women\nwith chronic vulvar pain, especially those women who fail\nto respond to HT. The best tool for distinguishing if\nchronic vulvar pain consistent with both atrophy and vul-\nvodynia will respond to HT is to give a trial of HT,\nfollowed by alternative vulvodynia treatments in those not\nresponding. Future research should focus on the diagnosis\nand treatment of women who do not respond to this\nintervention.\nAbbreviations\nBMI, body mass index; DHEA-S, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate; E2, estradiol;\nFSH, follicle stimulating hormone; HT, hormone therapy; Kg, kilograms; M,\nmeters; SHBG, steroid hormone binding globulin; SWAN, Study of Women's\nHealth Across the Nation; T, testosterone\nAcknowledgements\nClinical Centers: University of Michigan, Ann Arbor-Siob\u00e1n Harlow, PI 2011\nUniversity, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL-Howard Kravitz, PI 2009\n-Ellen Gold, PI; University of California, Los Angeles-Gail Greendale, PI; Albert\nEinstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY-Carol Derby, PI 2011-present, Rachel\nand the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA-Karen Matthews, PI.
