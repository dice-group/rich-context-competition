Whether FFLs contribute to gun-\nrelated homicide in areas where they are located, in which case FFLs may be a homicide risk factor\nthat can be modified, is not known.\nMethods: Annual county-level data (1993\u00ad1999) on gun homicide rates and rates of FFLs per\ncapita were analyzed using negative binomial regression controlling for socio-demographic\ncharacteristics. Models were run to evaluate whether the relation between rates of FFLs and rates\nof gun homicide varied over the study period and across counties according to their level of\nurbanism (defined by four groupings, as below). Also, rates of FFLs were compared against FS/S \u00ad\nwhich is the proportion of suicides committed by firearm and is thought to be a good proxy for\nfirearm availability in a region \u00ad to help evaluate how well the FFL variable is serving as a way to\nproxy firearm availability in each of the county types of interest.\nResults: In major cities, gun homicide rates were higher where FFLs were more prevalent (rate\nto 1999 (RR = 12.72), due likely to federal reforms that eliminated low-volume dealers, making FFL\nprevalence a more accurate exposure measure over time. No association was found in small towns.\nIn other cities and in suburbs, gun homicide rates were significantly lower where FFLs were more\nprevalent, with associations that did not change over the years of the study period. FFL prevalence\nwas correlated strongly (positively) with FS/S in major cities only, suggesting that the findings for\nhow FFL prevalence relates to gun homicide may be valid for the findings pertaining to major cities\nbut not to counties of other types.\nConclusion: Modification of FFLs through federal, state, and local regulation may be a feasible\nintervention to reduce gun homicide in major cities.\n\u00a9 2009 Wiebe et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBackground\nHomicide is a major cause of death in the U.S. and the sec-\nond leading cause of death among 15\u00ad34 year-olds.[1]\nDuring each year of the past quarter century (1980\u00ad\n2005), more homicides were committed with firearms\nthan with all other weapon types combined.[2] Firearms\nA correspondingly large firearm manufacturing and dealer\ndistribution system exists in the U.S. and is thought to\ncontribute to the incidence of firearm homicide. [3-5] The\nnumber of federally-licensed firearm dealers (FFLs),\nwhich include gun stores and individuals that are licensed\nby the federal government to ship, transport, and receive\nfirearms in interstate commerce and engage in retail sales,\nU.S. in 2001.[6] No publicly available data report the\nnumber of guns sold by FFLs. However, data on gun pur-\nchases and on guns seized and guns recovered by police\nindicate that firearms flow through FFLs into U.S. com-\nmunities at a rate that sums into the millions each year.\n[7-9] A state-level study, using self-reports of household\nfirearm ownership as a proxy for gun availability, found\nthat the states where guns were most common experi-\nenced the highest rates of gun homicide.[10] Similarly, it\nis possible that a greater number of FFLs is associated with\ngreater gun availability and ultimately, increased gun\nhomicide rates.\nAlthough the federal government is responsible for regu-\nlating which individuals or businesses are issued an FFL,\nthe decision about where an FFL can operate is a local\nmatter. Therefore, it is helpful to adopt an urban planning\nperspective when considering the possibility that FFLs\ncould be impacting local homicide rates.[11,12] Like\nother businesses, FFLs are subject to regulations including\nzoning laws which dictate how land parcels can be used.\nIn addition to zoning laws, state-level legislation,\nalthough currently in place in only a minority of states,\ncan mandate additional licensing requirements and peri-\nodic inspection of gun dealer records.[13] Therefore, if\nFFLs do act as a spigot through which firearms flow into a\ncommunity and thereby contribute to homicide, it is pos-\nsible that regulating the locations and activities of stores\nwhere firearms are sold is a way to curb homicide. With\nthis in mind, we considered whether licensed gun dealers\nfunction as a proxy for gun availability in counties in the\nU.S., and studied whether having a disproportionately\nhigh number of FFLs in a county was associated an ele-\nvated rate of homicide committed with guns. Other stud-\nies examining mortality as a function of gun availability\nhave used FS/S \u00ad the proportion of suicides that were\ncommitted with firearms as opposed to other methods \u00ad\nas a way to measure by proxy the extent of gun availability\nin a geographic area. Whereas FS/S appears to serve well as\na proxy for gun availability, FS/S is not a risk factor that is\nterms of their locations and retail practices, and thus in\nthis way this analysis is investigating a public health issue\nwith direct policy relevance.\nMethods\nData and Variables\nOur dataset consisted of seven separate, year-specific\nentries for 3,112 counties (including the District of\nColumbia and county equivalents such as boroughs and\nindependent cities), totaling 21,784 observations of\ncome measure was annual firearm homicide rates per\nthrough 1999. The rates were calculated with firearm\nhomicide data from the National Center for Health Statis-\ntics' (NCHS) Multiple Cause of Death files (defined as\nInternational Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision\nCensus data. Permission to include counties with fewer\nsion of Vital Statistics. We calculated this outcome meas-\nure separately by year for each U.S. county. Our primary\npredictor measure was the annual per capita prevalence of\n\"type one\" (firearm dealer) and \"type two\" (pawnbroker)\nthrough 1999. The FFL data were obtained from Basic\nInformation Systems, Inc. (Wheaton, Maryland), which\nprovided data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Fire-\narms and Explosives (ATF) on the annual number and\ntype of FFLs in the U.S. by county for the study period. FFL\ndata were not available for counties in Alaska and there-\nfore Alaska was not included in the analysis. FFL data for\nCovariates were used to control for several county-level\nfactors thought to be potential confounders of the associ-\nation between FFL rates and homicide rates being studied\ncent male, percent African American, percent Native\nAmerican, percent Hispanic, percent married, percent liv-\ning alone, percent female headed households, average per\ncapita income, percent of persons below the poverty level,\npercent of the civilian labor force unemployed, percent\nover age 25 who were college educated, hospital beds per\ncapita, and percent of arrests that were drug-related. Each\nof these variables was obtained from the U.S. Census\nBureau and the Area Resource File[16] with the exception\nof drug-related arrests, which was obtained from the Fed-\neral Bureau of Investigation's county-level Uniform Crime\nReports (UCR),[17] and was incorporated given evidence\nthat drug arrests may be feasible as an indicator of drug\nactivity.[18,19] Because the UCR arrest data are derived\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nfrom police jurisdictions, which do not correspond\nexactly with county boundaries, a second variable that\nadjusted for the discrepancy by distance-based weighting\nbetween police jurisdiction centriods and county centro-\nids was included in the model. Also, the covariates\nincluded a variable for urbanization defined according to\na modification of the rural-urban continuum classifica-\ntion (mRUC) scheme [20-22] designed by the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture.[23] This variable initially\nincluded 11 categories that were collapsed to four catego-\nries for parsimony during preliminary analyses: major cit-\nies (mRUC 1: central counties of one million population\nor more); other cities (mRUC 2: central counties of metro-\npolitan areas of one million population or more); sub-\nurbs (mRUC 3\u00ad5: fringe counties of metropolitan areas of\none million population or more, ranging to counties in\nand small towns (mRUC 6\u00ad11: urban counties with a\npopulation of 20,000 or more adjacent to a metropolitan\narea, ranging to completely rural counties of less than\n2,500 urban population not adjacent to a metro area).\nEach variable was measured annually except for urbaniza-\ntion, persons below the poverty level, female-headed\nhouseholds, persons living alone, persons married, and\npersons college-educated. These variables were based on\ndata available either decennially and/or for certain inter-\ncensal years. Intercensal years without data were linearly\ninterpolated or forecast based on known values. Addition-\nally, a linear trend for year was included to account for\ntemporal variability.\nGiven that the availability of firearms in one county may\ndepend on how many FFLs exist in surrounding counties,\na variable was included to reflect the prevalence of FFLs in\ncounties surrounding the index county, weighted by the\ninverse of the squared rectilinear distance between county\npopulation-weighted centriods. The leniency of state fire-\narm laws in each county was controlled for as well. This\nwas done by coding each county according to a classifica-\nscheme uses an integer scale ranging from 0 to 100, with\n0 representing maximum restrictiveness and 100 repre-\nsenting maximum leniency, to reflect state laws pertaining\nto the acquisition, ownership, and transportation of fire-\narms and ammunition. Leniency scores were assigned sep-\narately to each county for each year. The leniency scores\nlished information. We linearly extrapolated leniency\na variable containing county-level annual nongun homi-\nthe final statistical model. This was done to explore the\npossibility that such an adjustment could help control for\na latent homicidal tendency at the county level and isolate\nthe contribution of FFLs to gun homicide.\nStatistical Analysis\nPlots were generated to assess annual prevalence rates of\nFFLs and rates of homicide in the U.S. Negative binomial\ngeneralized linear regression conducted at the county\nlevel was used to estimate the association between the\nprevalence of FFLs and rates of gun homicide in U.S.\nficients were converted into incidence rate ratios (RR),\nand the result of the final statistical model are presented.\nCorrelation stemming from use of multiple data years was\naccounted for with generalized estimating equations\nunder a working independence correlation matrix. Spear-\nman correlation coefficients and variance inflation factors\nwere used to identify multicollinearity and for diagnostic\npurposes. Also, variation by year and urbanization, for\nreasons discussed below, was then investigated by restrict-\ning analyses to individual data years and using interaction\nterms to permit the relation between the prevalence of\nFFLs and rates of gun homicide to vary across counties\naccording to their size (i.e., on the rural-urban contin-\nuum). The variable used to represent a linear trend for\nyear was excluded from the year-specific models. The\nadjusted RR estimates derived from these models are pre-\nsented in a summary table.\nTo gain insight into how well the FFL prevalence variable\nmay be serving as a way to proxy gun availability in coun-\nties of each grouping, the proportion of suicides commit-\nted with firearms (FS/S) \u00ad which is considered an accurate\nproxy for household gun availability and has been studied\ncomputed within each county by year and modeled in\nplace of our FFL variable. Spearman correlation coeffi-\ncients were also calculated to determine how well FS/S\nwas correlated with the FFL prevalence rate within coun-\nties of each grouping.\nResults\ngun manufacturers, gun stores and individuals held active\nlicenses to sell firearms (i.e., FFLs).

The variable for percent of female\nheaded households was excluded during the model build-\ning process due to multicolinearity. The results based on\nthis overall model suggested that the prevalence of FFLs in\nU.S. counties was not associated with the rate of gun hom-\nicide in the county (RR = 0.98, 95% confidence interval\ninteraction term revealed that the relation between FFLs\nand gun homicide was found to vary significantly by\nurbanization (p < 0.01). The subsequent modeling\nrevealed that in major cities, a disproportionately high\nprevalence of FFLs was associated with significantly higher\n(Table 3). Additionally, the magnitude of this association\nincreased significantly over the study period with an aver-\ncontrast, in other cities and in suburbs a disproportion-\nately high prevalence of FFLs was associated with signifi-\nthe magnitude of these associations did not change when\ntested for trend over the study period. The prevalence of\nFFLs was not associated with gun homicide rates in small\ntowns. Inclusion of the covariate representing county-\nlevel rates of nongun homicide did not substantively\nchange the results. Also, the results did not change sub-\nstantively when the variable that was used to adjust for the\nimpact of the prevalence of FFLs in surrounding counties\nwas excluded from the models.\nThe results of the models run with FS/S used in place of\nthe FFL prevalence variable (not presented) were generally\nconsistent with our findings, although the link between\ngun availability and gun homicide appeared to be even\nstronger (positive) and more widespread than seen in the\nTable 2: Gun homicide rates as a function of the number of federal firearms licensees in U.S. counties\nIncident rate ratio SE P-value 95% CI\nSmall towns (reference) --\nResults of generalized linear negative binomial regression.\nSE denotes standard error.\nCI denotes confidence interval.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nanalysis presented here. Importantly though, FS/S was\nstrongly (positively) correlated with FFL prevalence in\nmajor cities (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.67) but\nwas weakly correlated and not correlated with FS/S in\nrespectively. From this evidence it appears that FFL preva-\nlence is a good proxy for firearm availability in major cit-\nies only, suggesting that the findings for how FFL\nprevalence relates to gun homicide may be valid for the\nfindings pertaining to major cities but not to counties of\nother types.\nDiscussion\nOur analyses provide evidence of an association between\nthe per capita rate of licensed firearm dealers in a county\nand its rate of firearm homicide. In particular, we found\nthat having a disproportionately high number FFLs was\nassociated with significantly higher rates of firearm homi-\ncide in major cities. As such, FFLs may represent a risk fac-\ntor for gun homicide that is modifiable. To the best of our\nknowledge, the association between licensed gun dealers\nand homicide rates has not previously been estimated. We\nalso found more FFLs to be associated with significantly\nlower firearm homicide rates in other cities and in sub-\nurbs. Possible explanations for both findings are dis-\ncussed below.\nOur evaluation strategy followed the assumption that the\nnumber of FFLs in a county gives some indication of the\nprevalence of firearms (i.e., a proxy of gun availability).\nAlthough no available data report the number of guns\nsold per dealer, the basic finding that major cities having\nthe most FFLs per capita also have the highest rates of gun\nhomicide is consistent with what is known about how\nFFLs and communities relate in terms of gun availability.\nData from gun traces (a determination of the chain of\nownership, usually conducted in connection with a crim-\ninal investigation) conducted by the ATF may provide the\nATF conducted 1,530 trace investigations to determine\nwhether guns used during crimes were trafficked from an\nFFL into the illegal gun market and to determine the point\nof first purchase.[8] FFLs accounted for less than 10 per-\ncent of the 1,530 trace investigations but for nearly half\n(40,000) of all firearms involved in these traces. The aver-\nage number of firearms trafficked by the FFLs under inves-\ntigation was 350, which far exceeds the average number of\nfirearms trafficked by other means including gun shows\n(130 guns), unlicensed gun dealers (75 guns), and straw\npurchasers (37 guns). The large volume of firearms that\ncan be obtained by FFLs is possibly what underlies this\ndiscrepancy and why FFLs may figure prominently as a\nrisk factor. In addition, a study where researchers tele-\nphoned FFLs and posed as customers provides additional\nevidence of how FFLs can facilitate the flow of guns to\ncriminals. Gun dealers were generally willing to sell a\nhandgun even when the buyer indicated an intention to\npurchase the gun illegally on behalf of someone else.[30]\nOther ATF data provide additional support for the possi-\nbility that gun homicide is a function of local FFLs. Guns\nare often found to have been used for criminal purposes\nTable 3: Gun homicide rates (per 100,000 population) as a function of the prevalence of federal firearms licensees (FFLs) (per 1,000\nIncident rate ratio\nIncident rate ratio\nAll counties Major cities Other cities Suburbs Small towns\nResults of generalized linear negative binomial regression models adjusted for covariates.\nCI indicates confidence interval.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nnot far from the gun dealer where they were first obtained.\nApproximately 62 percent of crime guns traced by the ATF\nwere first purchased from FFLs in the state where they\nwere recovered by police, one-quarter (25.9%) of crime\nguns were recovered in the county where they were pur-\nchased, and 10.5 percent were recovered in a county adja-\ncent to the county of purchase, almost all of which were\nin the same state (9.5%).[6] Moreover, almost one-third\n(32.2%) of traced crime guns are recovered by police\nwithin 10 miles of the FFL where they were first pur-\nchased, and over one-third (34.3%) are recovered\nbetween 11 and 250 miles of the FFL where they were first\npurchased.[6,8] Thus, an FFL appears most likely to have\nan effect in the home or surrounding counties.\nA recent study showing that gun dealers in or near major\ncities are at substantially elevated risk of selling guns used\nin crime may help to explain the strong positive associa-\ntion found here between FFL prevalence and gun homi-\ncide in major cities specifically.[31] Also, we found that\nthe association between FFLs and gun homicides in major\nconsistent with what resulted when in the 1990s the fed-\neral government took steps to regulate FFLs more closely.\nBefore this time, the process to obtain a license to sell fire-\narms was appreciably simpler.[4] The Gun Control Act of\n1968 required the ATF to issue a license to any applicant\nwho was at least 21 years old, had premises from which\nthey intended to conduct business, and who otherwise\nwas not prohibited by law from purchasing a firearm.[4]\nAt the time, the fee to obtain or annually renew an FFL was\nfor FFLs each year over the decade that followed. Fully\nsteadily thereafter and by 1992 reached a national peak of\nhowever. Any FFL enabled the holder to purchase large\nnumbers of firearms, often at wholesale prices, and to buy\nfrom sellers in other states.[6] Many of these dealers made\nfew if any registered sales, suggesting they were not truly\nengaged in the business of firearms dealing as required by\nfederal law, and a substantial proportion of the extant\nFFLs were not in compliance with applicable federal, state,\nand local laws.[4]\nWith the system becoming increasingly difficult for the\nincreased the FFL application fee 20-fold to $200 and\nimposed new laws intended to shut down inactive or cor-\nrupt FFLs.[4] In the years that followed, the number of\nciation between FFL prevalence and homicide may have\nbeen weaker in the early 1990s than in later years because\nthere existed a large number of low volume dealers who\ncontributed less to the supply of firearms.[4] Hence, with\nFFLs over time becoming a better measure of the exposure\nunder study, the actual magnitude of the association\nAnnual gun homicide rates as a function of the prevalence of federal firearms licensees (FFLs) in U.S. counties, by county type,\nAnnual gun homicide rates as a function of the prevalence of federal firearms licensees (FFLs) in U.S. counties,\nYear\nIncidence rate ratio\nMajor Cities\nOther Cities\nSuburbs\nSmall Towns\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nbetween FFLs and gun homicide may be more accurately\nportrayed in the last few years of our study.\nIn contrast to what was observed for major cities, we\nfound a negative association between gun homicide and\nFFL prevalence in other cities and suburbs. When consid-\nered in conjunction with the finding that FFL prevalence\nand FS/S are correlated strongly in major cities but corre-\nlated weakly in other cities and suburbs, this suggests that\nFFL prevalence is not a good proxy for gun availability in\nother cities and suburbs and hence the models based on\nthose areas should not be interpreted as providing valid\nestimates of the relation between gun availability and gun\nhomicide. We can consider these findings in light of our\nunderstanding of how the relation between FFLs and gun\nhomicide may vary across counties of different urbaniza-\ntion types. In major city areas with higher crime rates,\nthere will be greater criminal demand for guns and, hence,\na larger illegal market for guns. It thus seems more likely\nthat a weapon sold in a major city, as compared to one\nsold in another county type, will end up in the hands of a\ncriminal user through theft, straw purchase, gun traffick-\ning, or some other kind of transaction in the secondhand\nmarket. Also, it is possible that handguns rather than long\nguns account for a higher share of guns sold in major cit-\nies. Further, it would also stand to reason that an \"aver-\nage\" gun possessor has a greater chance of using a gun\ncriminally in an area with higher rates of gun violence.\nAlso, gun culture and the roles of guns in peoples' lives\nvary dramatically across urban-rural continuum. Firearm\nownership is more widespread in rural areas than urban\nareas, so the need to purchase a firearm from an FFL may\nbe less necessary in rural than urban areas. The role of fire-\narms certainly varies by county type in terms of firearm\nmortality, in that rates of firearm-related mortality in the\nU.S. are equally high in both the most urban and the most\nrural counties, with the nuance being that it is the gun\nhomicide rate that is high in the most urban counties and\nit is the gun suicide rate that is high in the most rural\ncounties.[20] Each of these points highlights the impor-\ntance of stratifying analyses by county type and identify-\ning variables that measure firearm availability accurately\nin the county type at the focus of a particular study, an\nimportant point that has been made previously.[32] The\nFS/S comparisons suggest that the FFL variable used here\nprovides an adequate proxy in major city counties alone.\nIf the FFL variable is not a good proxy for gun availability\nin counties we have defined as other cities and suburbs,\nour analyses cannot inform the issue of how gun availabil-\nity relates to gun homicide in counties of these types. It\nmay be the case that the impact of guns on a community\nmay vary by community type and may be protective in\nother cities and suburbs. In one study of 170 U.S. cities\nhomicide and of gun-related assault were found to be pos-\nitively associated with the prevalence of firearms.[33]\nEven so, it is possible that the mixing in that study of what\nwe have termed major cities, other cities and suburbs may\nhave prevented the authors from detecting modification\nof this effect across area type. Another study of counties in\nIllinois initially found that the rate of firearm ownership\nwas negatively associated with all measures of violent\ncrime, including homicide, but had failed to control for\nurbanization.[34] Subsequent multivariate analyses with\ncontrol for urbanization found no significant association\nbetween the rate of firearm ownership and homicide. A\nnumber of ecologic studies conducted at the state level\nfound firearm availability to be a risk factor for homicide\nrather than a protective factor, yet other studies have not\nfound clear effects of the relation between gun availability\nand homicide, e.g.,[34,38] and a recent National Acad-\nemy of Sciences report concluded that the body of\nresearch on this topic is inconclusive.[39] Our findings\nhighlight the need to account for urbanization in the stud-\nies that will follow.\nOur analysis had several strengths. First, it was conducted\nat the county level to account for within-state variability in\nhomicide rates and FFL prevalence. This also allowed us to\ncontrol for the possibilities that the homicide rate in a\ncounty was influenced by FFLs in surrounding counties\nand by the leniency or permissiveness of neighboring state\nfirearm laws. Second, our analysis examined the link\nbetween FFLs and homicide over county urbanization\ntype. Third, the study years coincided with a period when\nchanges to federal firearm licensing regulations produced\na change in the composition of the pool of FFLs nation-\nally. As FFLs became fewer the pool became more homog-\nenous, and hence may have provided an exposure variable\nthat became a better measure of gun availability over time.\nThe finding that the association between FFLs and gun\nhomicide in major cities grew stronger over time adds\nsupport to our interpretation of the results, as does the\nfinding based on our comparison with FS/S that FFL prev-\nalence appears to be a good proxy for gun availability in\ncounties defined as major cities but not in other county\ntypes.\nAlso, two aspects of the present study are unique and have\nimplications for how firearm homicide is studied and\nhow the incidence of firearm homicide may be reduced.\nFirst, because the link between gun homicide and gun\navailability (as measured by the prevalence of FFLs) was\nfound to vary significantly within states according to the\nurbanization levels of counties, it appears that studies\nconducted using broader geographic units of analysis\n(states, census divisions, etc.) may fail to detect important\nnuances in the nature of gun availability.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nSecond, to the best of our knowledge, our study, in focus-\ning on gun dealers as a potential risk factor for homicide,\nis the first to assess a tangible measure of gun availability\nthat can be modified as part of prevention activities. Law\nenforcement, city planners, and legal strategists in cities\nwith high gun homicide rates can concretely focus in on\nexcessive or problem gun dealers as opposed to the more\nnebulous issue of \"gun availability.\" Moreover, local\nefforts to close down illegal gun commerce have already\nexample, zoning laws, which control the location and\noperation of stores and individual dealers licensed to sell\nfirearms, have been used to regulate locations of FFLs in\nlaunch a coordinated effort to identify and act on prob-\nlematic gun dealers will surely face challenges, however.\nFor one, a key component of such efforts will be the polic-\ning activities of the ATF which, in having inspected fewer\n5% of FFLs in most of those years, may have resources\ninsufficient for the task.[6]\nOur analysis also had limitations. As discussed, we could\nnot account for the actual volume of firearms introduced\nby each FFL into the community. Although gun sales data\nare not currently available for a more focused test, the\nrecent National Academy of Sciences report called for bet-\nter information on FFLs to be collected and made availa-\nble for research.[39] Additionally, we did not explicitly\naccommodate spatial autocorrelation in the estimation of\nthe FFL effect estimates. Refitting the models presented in\nTable 2 and Table 3 including a simultaneous autoregres-\nsive (SAR) structure,[43] assuming that correlation\ndeclined in proportion to the square of the distance\nbetween counties, generally changed coefficients by less\nthan 5%. Also, data for FFLs for years after 1999 were not\navailable. Thus we could not analyze a more recent\nperiod. Nevertheless, we do not anticipate that the rela-\ntion observed here between FFLs and homicide would\nhave changed since the study period and thus this charac-\nteristic of the data should not be interpreted as devaluing\nthe findings. Finally, it may be that high rates of homicide\nmay lead to increased demand for firearms and hence\nadditional FFLs, in which case the results of the \"FFL as\nrisk factor\" hypothesis that our models have been\ndesigned to test would be spurious. A stronger analytic\napproach would be to test whether within-county\nincreases in FFL prevalence were followed by increases in\nthe rate of gun homicide. We considered that approach,\nbut found many instances in which a county experienced\nno gun homicides in certain years but some homicides in\nthe subsequent year, which prevents an annual change in\nhomicide rate from being calculated. Also, as discussed\nabove, we found evidence that FFL prevalence became a\nbetter proxy for firearm availability over time, which led\nto our preference for the 1999 models and our judgment\nto refrain from including change models in the current\nmanuscript. An instrumental variable approach could be\npursued as well, to attempt to remove from the models\nthe influence of circularity that may exist. We hope this\nmanuscript will inform how such design alternatives may\nbe approached, and acknowledge their need given the\ncross-sectional nature of the present study.\nConclusion\nIf locations of retailers licensed to sell firearms are indeed\nfunctioning as a spigot through which deadly firearms\nflow into criminal hands, then communities with greater\ngeographic access to these dealers should ostensibly expe-\nrience more firearm homicides. Our findings are consist-\nent with the hypothesis that this is occurring in major U.S.\ncities. The modification of FFLs, as tangible entities that\nare tracked and overseen at the national level and, in some\ncases, at the state and local levels, may be a feasible inter-\nvention to reduce firearm homicide.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nCB, MN and ME conceived of the study and supervised all\naspects of its implementation.
