    "abstract": "Abstract\nAdolescents, like adults, frequently experience discrimination, which can be particularly salient in the context of reproductive\nhealth care. We examined urban Black adolescent females' perceived experiences of racial discrimination during reproductive\nhealth care encounters. Structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with female African American patients, from age\n13 through 20, who obtained reproductive health care services at a single site. Twenty-four participants were enrolled. All\nwere in or graduated from high school, with a mean age of 16.8 years. These young Black women reported infrequent race-\nbased discrimination in the health care setting; however, many reported commonly experiencing discrimination in other\nplaces. An awareness of the discrimination that minority young women experience in non\u00adhealth care settings can help\nproviders demonstrate cultural humility when addressing such concerns with their patients. With this information, providers\ncan provide anticipatory guidance and the tools necessary to navigate complex social systems.\n",

In this case, discrimination at the individual\npatient\u00adprovider level is thought to manifest as differences in\ncare resulting from biases, prejudices, and stereotyping in\nclinical communication and decision making.\nThere is evidence that patients who perceive racial dis-\ncrimination are more likely to report adverse health out-\ncomes. Previous work has found that minority adults who\nreport ever experiencing discrimination, being prevented\nfrom doing something, being hassled, or made to feel inferior\nin various situations have greater physical and psychiatric\nsymptoms than their counterparts who did not report this\nexperience (Borrell, Kiefe, Williams, Diez-Roux, & Gordon-\nLarsen, 2006). In addition, individuals who report experienc-\ning discrimination at any time during their lifetime have been\nfound to have poor adherence to treatment, worse health out-\ncomes, and delays in seeking medical care (Casagrande,\nThe work of Dr. David Williams (2012) and others has\ncontinued to demonstrate a clear relationship between\nminority race and poorer health outcomes. Racial inequities\nand disparities are evident in the timing of disease onset\n(earlier for minorities), severity and progression of disease\n(more severe for minorities), the effects of some risk factors\n(less exposure to the risk factor has a greater impact on\nminorities), and the persistence of health disparities over\ntime (resulting in a lower life expectancy for minorities vs.\nnon-minorities).\nRacial discrimination is reported frequently by African\nAmericanadolescents,similartotheiradultcounterparts(Fisher,\nWallace, & Fenton, 2000; Sellers, Copeland-Linder, Martin, &\nLewis, 2006).

Given\nthe sensitive nature of care that is provided in these settings,\nreproductive care encounters can be prone to discriminatory\npractices based on imposed stereotypes or judgments about\npatients, such as what was described by theAfricanAmerican\nwomen in Benkert and Peters's (2005) study who reported\nexperiencing race-based discrimination when seeking family\nplanning care. For example, provider beliefs about the num-\nber of sexual partners, history of sexually transmitted infec-\ntions (STIs), or contraceptive use may differ depending on\nthe race of the patient. Thorburn and Bogart (2005) found\nthat among African American women ages 15 to 44 who had\nreceived family planning services, the majority (67%)\nreported having experienced race-based discrimination.\nAmong those 15 to 20 years of age, there was a greater asso-\nciation with stereotype-related discrimination. In addition,\nhaving a stronger Black identity was correlated with a greater\nperception of general health care discrimination.\nJo Valentine (2008) provided an overview of barriers to\nthe diagnosis and treatment of STIs and the relationship to\nthe heavy STI disease burden in the Black community.\nConstructs such as stigma, shame, and mistrust, as well as\nthe historical legacy in which these constructs are rooted and\ntheir contribution to the negative perceptions of Black sexu-\nality were explored and evaluated.\nIt is imperative that as few obstacles as possible exist\nwhen adolescents are seeking reproductive care because they\ncomprise a population at risk of suffering great health-related\nconsequences. Notably, young African American women\nsuffer disproportionately from reproductive morbidity, high-\nlighting the need for health care providers to recognize barri-\ners that impede this population from seeking reproductive\nhealth care (Augustine, 2010; Centers for Disease Control\n2006). This disparity underscores the importance of health\ncare providers' understanding the barriers to care, including\nthose related to discrimination, which may prevent this\ncohort from obtaining reproductive or other health care\nservices.\nDiscrimination results from processes of social inequity\nin which there is an imbalance of power and control, and a\ndevaluation, stigmatization, and rejection of a group of peo-\nple who possess specific attributes. There are varying\nresponses to the experience of rejection, prompting a need to\nconsider contextual, relational, and dispositional factors\n(Smart Richman & Leary, 2009). Patients who have negative\nperceptions of health care encounters, possess limited coping\nskills, and have inconsistent health care follow-up may have\nsignificant health-related consequences. There is an under-\nmining of the therapeutic relationship and a lack of patient\nempowerment that can occur if a young person perceives dis-\ncrimination from a clinician. The diagram in Figure 1 repre-\nsents the cycle that can occur when patients interact with\nproviders whom they perceive as discriminatory and the\nresultant avoidance of potential distress or discomfort at\nfuture encounters, followed by the negative impact on health\noutcomes if care is not sought in a timely fashion. When\nSlaughter-Acey, Caldwell, and Misra (2013) examined the\nrelationship between prenatal care entry and experiences of\npersonal and group racism among low-income, African\nAmerican women, they concluded that a delay in accessing\nprenatal care may be grounded in an attempt to avoid a dis-\ncriminatory experience. Using this context as a conceptual\nframework upon which this study is based, the objective was\nto use qualitative techniques to examine young Black wom-\nen's perceptions of racial discrimination during reproductive\nhealth care encounters and in non\u00adhealth care settings.\nMethod\nStudy Design\nWe conducted in-depth, semi-structured, face-to-face inter-\nviews with adolescent females, age 13 to 21 years, seeking\ncare at an urban family planning clinic, serving predomi-\nnantly African American females, between June and\nDecember of 2008. Study protocol and consent procedures\nwere approved by the hospital's institutional review board\nand the regional Family Planning Council. Adolescent\nwomen who met the study eligibility criteria provided writ-\nten informed consent. Parental consent was waived given\nthat participants were obtaining confidential reproductive\nhealth care.\nParticipants\nEligible participants met the following criteria: (a) female and\nhaving received reproductive health care at the recruitment\nsite, (b) 13 to 21 years of age, (c) able to speak and write in\nEnglish, and (d) self-identified as Black or African American.\nExclusion criteria included the following: (a) having dis-\ncussed transition to an adult provider because of age during\nthe last clinic visit (indicating the young woman would\nreceive health care elsewhere in the future); (b) being preg-\nnant, as confirmed prior to the visit and/or on the day of the\ninterview; and (c) having cognitive impairment that prevented\nparticipation in ongoing dialogue or written feedback.\nParticipants were recruited through direct contact with a\ntrained research assistant (RA) at the clinic or through\nrecruitment flyers. The RA approached young women fol-\nlowing their reproductive health care encounters with medi-\ncal providers, and invited them to participate in a research\nstudy to discuss their beliefs about race and health care.\nLewis et al. 3\nParticipants were also recruited through recruitment flyers\nthat were posted in the clinic with general information about\nthe study and contact details. After screening and eligibility\nfor participation were confirmed, a convenient time was\narranged for the participant to return for the face-to-face\ninterview. Informed written consent was obtained before the\ninterview.\nData Collection\nParticipants were interviewed in a private exam room by a\ntrained interviewer--an African American female. A detailed\nsemi-structured interview guide was developed from a thorough\nliterature review about race and ethnic identity development as\nwell as research about minority populations'perceptions of ste-\nreotypes and their impact on discriminatory behaviors (Sellers\net al., 2006). Each interview lasted for approximately 60 min,\nuntil saturation of key themes was achieved.\nThe semi-structured interview enabled participants to tell\ntheir \"stories\" about their experiences of discrimination,\neither personally or vicariously (awareness of others' experi-\nences), in a variety of contexts. The participants were first\nasked demographic questions to assess age; self-reported\nethnicity, skin color, educational level; personal work status;\nparental educational level and work status; other sources of\nhousehold income; and health insurance status. The inter-\nview guide included questions to elicit the participants' defi-\nnition of discrimination and to assess their opinions about the\nimpact of skin color (light- vs. dark-skinned) on discrimina-\ntion, the directionality of discrimination (i.e., within race vs.\nout-of-race discrimination), the presence of discrimination in\nthe health care setting (both reproductive and general medi-\ncal care), and its influence on the intention to return for med-\nical care, discrimination in non-medical settings, vicarious\ndiscrimination, and degree of Black identity.\nAfter their interviews, participants were asked to com-\nplete a brief questionnaire in private to provide feedback\nabout their comfort level with the questions and the inter-\nviewer. To ensure anonymity of feedback, participants were\ninstructed not to include identifying information on feedback\nresponse sheets and to seal the form in a blank envelope. The\nprincipal investigator (PI) reviewed the feedback, reporting\nresults in aggregate to the research team. Participants were\ngiven a choice between two US$20 gift cards to one of two\nlocal merchants as compensation for their time. The inter-\nviews were audio recorded and transcribed professionally.\nFigure 1. Impact of perceived discriminatory provider encounters on health outcomes.\n4 SAGE Open\nInterviewer training consisted of multiple meetings to\ndevelop the interview guide, integrating feedback from\nparticipant pilot data. An emergency medicine physician and\ninvestigator with expertise in qualitative methodology over-\nsaw and guided the training process. The PI conducted three\npilot interviews in which only she, as the interviewer, was\nvideotaped (with the participant's authorization) to assist\nwith training on non-verbal cues and standardization of\ninterview technique. These videos were used to train the one\nRA, who conducted the remainder of the interviews, the first\nthree of which were also videotaped (again, only she was\nfilmed). In addition, mock interviews were conducted among\nthe interviewers themselves to enhance their interview skills.\nDuring the period of data collection, the PI and RA met\nweekly to discuss the study's progress.\nData Analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic\nvariables. Transcript text was entered into Microsoft Word\nfor organization and coding. A priori (conceived beforehand)\ncodes based on the interview guide were used to group and\nlabel specific blocks of text and phrases from the interviews.\nThe first three interviews were coded by two members of the\nresearch team to develop mutually agreed-upon definitions\nfor each code. These initial interviews were coded multiple\ntimes by these same two reviewers to refine and clarify the\nterms and definitions of the coding library; any disagree-\nments in coding were resolved by consensus. Each interview\nwas then coded separately by two reviewers on the study\nteam. These two reviewers discussed the coding results, and\ndiscrepancies were resolved by consensus. The third reviewer\ncoded every third interview and provided supervision and\nassistance in coming to consensus, if necessary. Notes of\ncoding decisions were kept to facilitate member communica-\ntion and maintain coding consistency. Transcripts were then\nreviewed by the study team to identify patterns of emergent\nand recurrent themes. Theme development continued as an\niterative process, with review of transcripts as additional\ninterviews were ongoing, to assess when theme saturation\nhad been achieved.\nResults\nInterviews were conducted with 30 subjects. Three of these\nwere pilot interviews and were excluded from analysis.\nThree additional participants were excluded because of\nincomplete data due to audio recording failure (n = 2) or cog-\nnitive delay that was not detected until the interview was ini-\ntiated (n = 1; see Table 1).\nInterview Themes\nTable 2 provides additional illustrative quotes for each of the\nthemes described below.\nDefinition of discrimination. Most participants described peo-\nple who discriminate as those who dislike, look down upon,\nor treat an individual or group differently for a variety of\nreasons. Race, skin color, and ethnicity were reasons men-\ntioned by the majority (n = 17, 71%); other reasons stated\nwere age, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and appear-\nance. Many participants also used terms such as \"feeling\njudged\" and expressed that recipients of discrimination or\nprejudice lacked a sense of being valued and were made to\nfeel unworthy by others. Specifically, discrimination was\nassociated with a quality that works \"against you because of\nthe person you are,\" and \"restriction,\" or having limited\nopportunities. Discrimination was associated with disadvan-\ntage for Blacks and advancement for Whites. Participants\nalso mentioned other specific discrimination dyads: older\npersons against younger ones, and teachers against (Black)\nstudents.\nExperiences of racial discrimination in health care settings.Par-\nticipants reported that they infrequently experienced dis-\ncrimination in the health care setting. Regarding family\nplanning care, two participants reported past experiences in\nwhich providers made assumptions about their sexual his-\ntory. One young woman was encouraged by her male pro-\nvider to begin a birth control method because her mother\nassumed she was interested in becoming sexually active and\ntook her to the doctor for this purpose; she emphasized that\nhe did not confirm with her, as the patient, if birth control\nwas truly the reason she was there. Another young woman\nperceived that her family planning provider assumed she was\nsexually active, but she had come to the clinic only to learn\nabout birth control methods. In general health care encoun-\nters, one participant reported feeling as if she was treated\nworse by a Black female physician (as compared with a non-\nBlack health care provider) when she brought her younger\nTable 1.

She believed that the reason\nfor this differential treatment was that her sister was lighter\nskinned and she and the provider were darker skinned, repre-\nsentative of a viewpoint that individuals with lighter skin\nreceive better treatment than those with darker skin. The per-\nceived assumption that these young Black women were\nseeking contraception when they were not may be grounded\nin historical perspectives about the sexuality of Black\nwomen. During times of slavery, Blacks were seen as the\nproperty of slave owners; they were not viewed as human\nand, therefore, were not entitled to rights befitting a human.\nWhat accompanied these views was the inhumane treatment\nof slaves as evidenced by the commission of horrific acts of\nviolence toward them, one of which was the rape of Black\nwomen. Black female slaves were seen as objects of sexual\nexploitation for White men. Women had no right to resist\ntheir slave owners' advances; compliance with the owners'\nquest for sexual gratification was not only commonplace, but\nexpected (Collins, 2005). Furthermore, because Blacks had\nno rights, this was not seen as a criminal act. Jezebel, a term\nused to justify the sexual relations between White men and\nBlack women, emerged during slavery times and depicts a\nBlack woman with an overwhelming need and strong drive\nfor sex that could only be satiated by a White man, endorsing\nthe perspective that interracial sex was, in fact, desired by\nated the belief that Black women of that era were uncivilized\nwith unbridled sexual appetites, \"naturally\" promiscuous,\nand therefore impure. Childbearing was an important aspect\nof Black women's sexuality as great value was placed on\ntheir fecundity given the desire of slave owners to sustain\nand grow the slave workforce (Valentine, 2008).\nThere is evidence that young women perceive that the\n\"Jezebel perspective\" of Black women as it relates to sexual-\nity, use of birth control, and pregnancy still exists. Some\nyoung women described when they were solicited by White\nmen to participate in atypical sexual acts because these men\nview Black women as \"sexual freak[s].\" Relating to preg-\nnancy, one young woman shared, \"To some people, I think,\nwhen they see a Black girl, they automatically assume that I\ngot three or four kids or I am running around and all wild and\nloud and--I am this off the wall . . . \" These experiences and\nperceptions may indicate that the belief that Black women\nare hypersexual, promiscuous, or breeders still prevails\ntoday.\nExperiences of racial discrimination,non\u00adhealth care related.Par-\nticipants reported experiencing discrimination in a variety of\nsettings, including the workplace, school, stores, and their\nneighborhoods (see Table 3). Events at work and school were\nparticularly common, especially with regard to being hired\nor maintaining employment and interactions with peers,\nrespectively. This was the case for one participant who heard\nthat a hiring manager where she submitted her application\ntold her non-Black friend \"Every time a Black person comes\nand fills out an application I throw it away.\"\nAnother frequently described event was racial profiling,\nor being targeted by an individual purely on the basis of\nracial or ethnic characteristics. The context in which these\nevents were most likely to occur was in stores (e.g., being\nfollowed) and observations of or interactions with law\nenforcement officials (e.g., harassment, use of unnecessary\nforce, being stopped in a vehicle without clear justification).\nInterviewees described similar events that were experienced\nby family members or friends, with the majority of witnessed\nincidents involving police and Black males. Young women\ndescribed both emotional and action-based responses when\nthese events occurred. Anger, hurt, disgust, and discomfort\nwere among the emotional responses commonly reported.\nVerbal expression of these feelings toward the perpetrator or\nTable 2.

The young women\ngave examples of feeling that Blacks are thought of as less\nintelligent, being poor, having many children, living in vio-\nlent areas, or participating in criminal acts. These ideas were\ncaptured in quotes such as the following:\nBecause, like usually when people think about Black people, or\nlike their neighborhoods, they're like, \"Oh, don't go down there\nbecause you're going to get shot.\" Or they think of Black people,\nthey're like, \"They're dirty\" or \"They're poor.\" \"They're not\nbetter than us.\" Like if a White person--like if you ask a White\nperson, like \"What do you think when you hear the word, like\nAfrican American?\" They'll probably say a whole bunch of\nnegative stuff. But I don't know.\nIn addition, a common sentiment shared by interviewees was\n\"acting Black or White.\" References made to these behaviors\nwere usually in the context of speech, or using colloquial\nterms or slang specific to Blacks. For example, one partici-\npant spoke of being \"bona fide ghetto\" (ghetto being a\ndescription of predominantly Black, low-resource areas in\nsome communities) as \"loud, obnoxious, cussing all the\ntime\" (cussing refers to swearing or use of profanity).\nAlternatively, young women also described times when\nBlacks or Whites told them they were \"acting White\" because\nthey participated in certain activities or spoke in a way that\nwas perceived as being associated with \"Whiteness.\" One\nyoung lady said, \"I don't know what I want to be, I don't\nknow if I want to act White or if I want to act Black . . . White\npeople who don't know me, they may say I'm just a confused\nsoul.\"\nThe inverse was also noted when White friends or\nacquaintances of some participants \"acted Black\" by speak-\ning a certain way or using specific terms only in the presence\nof Black people. In spite of being part of these different cul-\ntural realms, the participants made it clear that they knew\nwhat behavior was appropriate at any given time. For exam-\nple, participants believed that slang could be used with\nfriends, but speaking in a professional tone and using proper\nEnglish is expected during an interview.\nEthnicity. There were commonalities among many of the par-\nticipants when describing the ways in which they identified\nwith their ethnic culture. Young women spoke not only about\nthe use of slang or a specific manner of dress but also the\nstyling of hair.\nSome of the young women believed that the practices\ndemonstrating their membership in the Black culture were\nperceived as having a negative impact on the way that they\nwere viewed or treated by non-Blacks and Blacks, alike. One\nyoung woman mentioned that if she wore her hair in a \"bush\"\n(afro hair style), she would be asked \"[why] do you have\nTable 3.

Many young women, regardless of self-reported\nskin color, perceived that light-skinned Blacks are regarded\nmore positively and receive better treatment than those who\nare dark-skinned, and that this differential treatment is prac-\nticed by both Blacks and Whites. This perception was evi-\ndenced by the following comments:\n. . . if you're light-skinned you're better no matter if you're\ndark-skinned or you're light-skinned but like better jobs if\nyou're light-skinned. Like, people will like you better or\nyou'll come-you'll come off better than people who are\ndark-skinned.\n. . . Light, like you have your-you're better, you're just\neverything is just going to be given to you, like you're just better\nthan the next person.\nNot only did they report this belief system being held\namong members of general society but also prevailing among\nmembers of their family in which lighter skinned individuals\nwere more highly valued or preferred over darker skinned\nindividuals. One exception to this \"rule\" is when light-\nskinned Blacks think of themselves as \"better than\" others,\nresulting in poorer treatment and exclusion from the domi-\nnant Black group.\nMost young women, regardless of their self-reported skin\ncolor classification, believed that for them personally, their\nskin color did not affect the way they were treated by others.\nHowever, some young women who self-identified as dark-\nskinned gave vivid accounts of hurtful personal experiences\nrelating to their skin color, which had a negative impact on\nhow they viewed themselves. An example of this was a quote\nfrom a young lady who recounted childhood experiences of\nbullying:\nWhen I was younger I would get bullied and stuff, they used to\ncall me tar baby and all this other stuff . . . yeah it used to make\nme cry and feel bad about myself, but now I don't pay no\nattention to things like that.\nAnother young lady recounted, \"And I didn't like being so\ndark, like they be like `Blackie,' . . .\"\nPositive outlook on race relations.\nMany young women\nexpressed that, although they are aware discrimination exists,\nthey do not believe there is a role for it in today's world and\ndo not endorse the idea that anyone should receive different\ntreatment on the basis of race or skin color. There is a\nreassuring sense of tolerance and the embracement of diver-\nsity. One young woman expressed,\nJust do you, don't worry about nobody else, come together, be a\nbig family. I go and eat spaghetti and meatballs with my Italian\nfriends all the time. I eat at the Jamaican store all the time; I even\neat Jewish food. We do the same things. Cut it out, right . . . So\nit's like be friends with everybody you know.\nDiscussion\nThe findings of this study indicate that young Black women\ndid not frequently perceive discrimination in the health care\nsetting, contrary to what other studies have reported. An\nexample of such a study is Benkert and Peters's (2005) work\nin which they found that African American women reported\nexperiencing discrimination when seeking family planning\nservices.\nIt is for this reason that our finding of young women not\nendorsing discrimination in a clinical setting warrants further\nexamination. To better understand why this may have been\nthe case in our clinic, it is necessary to first provide some\ncontext by describing the racial composition of the personnel\nwho staffed the clinic as well as the patient population that\nwas served there. The majority of patients served at the clinic\nwere Black (the clinic is embedded in an urban community\nthat is predominately Black). In contrast, the staff repre-\nsented a heterogeneous mix of both Black and White (in gen-\neral, there were more White than Black staff). The front-line\nstaff, such as receptionists and medical assistants, who made\ninitial contact with patients were Black; however, the nurses\nand physicians were predominately White (with the excep-\ntion of one Black physician). There were no cultural compe-\ntence trainings provided to staff, but it is reasonable to\nconsider that with the clinic being located in a Black com-\nmunity, serving mostly Black youth, with Black front-line\nstaff, the non-Black staff may have had a heightened aware-\nness of issues related to cultural bias and would be more\nlikely to engage in self-monitoring of behaviors that may be\nperceived as discriminatory. In addition, perhaps by first\ninteracting with Black reception staff and same-race peers in\nthe waiting room, patients' perceptions of the clinical\nencounter with non-Black clinicians that followed were posi-\ntively influenced (priming effect). Alternatively, it may be\nthat the presence of Blacks in the clinic enhanced comfort\nlevels among patients, enabling them to be more receptive to\ncare they received from non-Black clinicians.\nAlternatively, the race or skin color of the medical pro-\nvider may be one of many complex factors that a patient con-\nsiders when assessing the degree of discrimination\nexperienced during a health care encounter. Support for this\nsupposition comes from one participant who described feel-\ning as though she was discriminated against even though she\nand the physician with whom she was interacting were the\nsame race and same darker hue. This suggests that the\n8 SAGE Open\ntherapeutic bond goes beyond \"skin deep\" and may, in fact,\nbe more influenced by the perception of respect that the pro-\nvider shows the patient. Previous studies examining what\nBlack youth value in their relationships with health care pro-\nviders have shown that being respectful and non-judgmental,\nas well as maintaining the confidentiality of their informa-\ntion, is more important than sharing physical attributes or\ncharacteristics with a provider (Ginsburg, Menapace, &\nWe did discover that discrimination, although not neces-\nsarily perceived as being present in the clinic, is a common\nelement in the lives of these young Black women. The set-\ntings in which they are most likely to spend their time are the\nplaces that they reported having negative experiences of\nrace-based discrimination: school, the workplace, stores,\ntheir neighborhoods, recreational venues, and their own\nhomes. The perpetrators of these incidents are individuals\nfrom the same race, as well as those from different racial\nbackgrounds. The events may be subtle, such as an askance\nglance, or overt, such as a directed racial slur or epithet.\nIncidents may involve someone with whom they have a close\nrelationship, like a family member, or someone from whom\nprotection is expected, such as a law enforcement official.\nFor some, it has negatively affected how they view them-\nselves, or how they believe others view them and Blacks as a\ngroup.\nOur findings suggest that intra-racial dynamics were at\nplay in the perceptions of these young women. We chose to\nexplore the degree to which the young women identified\nwith being Black, as some studies have shown that, the\nstronger one's Black identity, the more likely one is to per-\nceive an event as discriminatory (Sellers et al., 2006;\nThorburn & Bogart, 2005). Young women reported that the\nmore they expressed their ethnicity or elements of their\nBlack culture, the more they were viewed negatively by\nmembers of other racial or ethnic groups. Interestingly, skin\ncolor--the degree of lightness or darkness--was a factor\nthat had an impact on the perception of discrimination and\naffected self-image in these participants. Among these\nyoung women, there is a belief that being lighter skinned\nconfers a degree of protection against discrimination and, in\nfact, is a more highly valued attribute among both non-\nBlacks and Blacks. It is worth providing a historical over-\nview to understand the origin of these beliefs and their\nprevalence among young Black women.\nDuring slavery, Whites placed greater economic value on\nthose who possessed lighter skin--they were sold at higher\nprices and were preferred by Whites to perform personal ser-\nvices. These lighter skinned individuals were more likely to\nbe house servants and were not subject to the hard field labor\nof their darker skinned counterparts, thus enabling them to\ndevelop marketable skills and gain social capital. These pref-\nerential practices stemmed from a belief that the lighter skin\nhue more closely paralleled the Euro-centric view of beauty\nin which White was more aesthetically appealing than Black,\nand that those with evidence of mixed racial heritage (lighter\nskin), were intellectually superior to those of pure African\nancestry. Our findings, as evidenced by the comments of\nsome of the participants, suggest that this historical perspec-\ntive, rooted in the legacy of slavery, racism, and discrimina-\ntion that was commonplace in this country for centuries, has\nbeen perpetuated and is still embedded in the belief systems\nof Black youth today (Keith & Herring, 1991).\nIt was encouraging to learn that many of the young\nwomen we interviewed had not adopted such views and,\nalthough they or others had experienced discrimination,\ntheir perceptions of the world around them had not been\ntainted. Participants' racial identity and ways that they\nidentify with their ethnic culture may help to promote their\npositive outlook. This concept, known as racial socializa-\ntion (based on race pride and preparation for bias), is\nbelieved to be a potential protective factor that buffers\nAfrican American youth from the negative impacts of per-\nceived discrimination (Harris-Britt, Valrie, Kurtz-Costes,\n& Rowley, 2007). However, for those youth who do not\npossess those protective factors, we must not overlook the\npotential negative impact on their emotional and physical\nwell-being, in both the short- and long-term. A 5-year lon-\ngitudinal study of African American adolescents (enrolled\nbetween 10 and 12 years of age) found that increases in\nperceived discrimination were associated with increased\nconduct and depressive symptoms (Brody et al., 2006).\nNurturing, involved parenting was a protective factor; con-\nduct problems were more prevalent among boys, but there\nwere no gender differences in depressive symptoms.\nAlthough this study gives some preliminary data about the\nconsequences of early exposure to discrimination, more\nresearch is needed to assess the relationship between dis-\ncrimination, health status, and protective factors in youth\nwho are exposed to discrimination over an extended and\nprolonged period of time, and how these impacts manifest\nin adulthood. The more recent Adverse Childhood\nExperience work of Wade, Shea, Rubin, and Wood (2014)\nhas taken into account the impact of discrimination on\nyouth and demonstrates that urban-specific traumas during\nchildhood predisposes to poor health outcomes as adults.\nHowever, there is an "
