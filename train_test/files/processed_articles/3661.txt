    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article presents an updated version of the Institutions and Elections Project (IAEP) dataset. The dataset comprises\ninformation on 107 de jure institutional provisions, and 16 variables related to electoral procedures and electoral events,\nfor 170 countries in the period 1960\u00ad2012. The dataset is one of the most encompassing datasets on global institutional\nvariation that explicitly codes de jure formal institutions. This article presents the dataset and compares it with existing\ndatasets on political institutions, highlighting how the IAEP's focus on disaggregated de jure institutions complements\nexisting datasets that combine de facto and de jure elements. We illustrate the potential uses of the data by constructing\nindices that capture institutional dimensions beyond the standard democracy\u00adautocracy dimension, and that represent\ndifferent ways of using the data for index construction. Finally, we illustrate potential applications by conducting a short\nreplication and expansion of a recent study of democracy and civil war onset.\n",

Scholarship suggests that economic growth\nis enhanced by `good' institutions (Acemoglu et al., 2001;\nKnutsen, 2011), interstate peace better preserved when\npolitical leaders are `constrained' in their foreign policy\n(Choi, 2010), and armed conflict is more likely to erupt\nwhen institutions are `inconsistently democratic' (Hegre\net al., 2001). All of these concepts, however, are hard to\ndefine: what they mean is often contested, they are multidi-\nmensional, it is unclear what their necessary conditions are,\nand it is not obvious how to capture them empirically from\nwritten sources. For example, to some democracy is a func-\ntion of representation and power sharing (e.g. Lijphart,\n1999), to others it is about institutions that facilitate compe-\ncases, assessing whether the institutions in a particular\ncountry at a given time are `democratic' or if they embody\nLijphartian `power sharing'involves a considerable amount\nof judgment. In this judgment, it is often impossible to dis-\ntinguish between the institutions that regulate behaviour\nand the behaviour itself. An example is the most widely\nused indicator of democracy, from the Polity dataset\nof the degree of institutional constraints on the executive in\nPolity, for instance, is largely a subjective assessment with-\nout reference to specific provisions in a country's constitu-\ntion or other laws.\nThis article presents an update and expansion of the IAEP\ndataset (the Institutions and Elections Project, by Regan\net al., 2009), which seeks to address these definitional and\nmeasurement issues by coding an extensive set of de jure\ninstitutional provisions in countries' constitutions that\ntogether form a picture of the formal setup of a country's\ninstitutions. De jure aspects of institutions have the distinct\nadvantage that they can be coded quite unambiguously from\nwritten sources. One may debate whether the executive of\nUpdated data on institutions and\nthe IAEP dataset version 2.0\nTore Wig1,2, H\u00e5vard Hegre2,3 and Patrick M.

This allows for more\nfine-grained analyses of how and when formal rules affect\ninstitutional behaviour and, in turn, outcomes such as con-\nflict or economic development. Disadvantages with relying\non de jure institutions, obviously, is that they may be system-\natically disregarded in practice, and that they reflect little\nmore than individual aspects of a bundle of institutions that\nmust be considered together. Still, they are an important\ncomplement to most datasets on institutions, which rely\nheavily on subjectively coded indices of de facto aspects.\nFocusing on de jure institutions allows us to answer crucial\nquestions about when formal institutions constrain behav-\niour. The IAEP is currently one of the most comprehensive\ndatasets on political institutions and elections in existence,\nand it should provide scholars with the opportunity to\ndevelop more refined testable implications about how politi-\ncal institutions affect outcomes.\nIn the next section of the article we present an overview\nof the dataset, accompanied by a discussion of how the\nIAEP compares to existing datasets on political institutions.\nThis is followed by some illustrations of how the data can\nbe used. First, we present trends in a selected number of\ninstitutional indicators over time. Second, we present two\naggregate indices that we create out of the individual indi-\ncators, each constructed using a distinct approach to index\nconstruction. This is done to illustrate how the data can be\nused to create indices in several ways. Finally, we illustrate\nanother potential use of the dataset by replicating and\nexpanding on a study on democracy and civil war by\nThe dataset\nOverview\nThe updated IAEP dataset describes the relationships\nbetween the ruled and their rulers across 170 countries\nThere are two groups of IAEP indicators. The first group\ncontains 107 variables that record information about the de\njure institutional arrangements of a country. The codebook\n(available as an online appendix) groups the indicators into\naspects of a country's constitution, its legislature, execu-\ntive\u00adlegislature relationship, the judiciary, government\ncentralization, the central bank, elections and electoral out-\ncomes, and rules governing elections.\nIn addition to this, there are 16 variables that record\ninformation about the practice of elections, if any, in a\ncountry. The `election in practice' component to these\ndata are recorded as events and characterize elections if\nthey are held, in democracies, partial democracies, or\nnon-democracies.\nThe information in the dataset is gathered from a num-\nber of publicly available sources and legal texts that are\ndescribed in the appendix. To assess the reliability of cod-\nings, we have conducted inter-coder reliability tests, all\nsuggesting that the reliability of the codings is high (see the\nappendix).\nContrasts with other datasets\nThe IAEP compares favourably with several other datasets\non political institutions, and serves as an important comple-\nment to many of them. Most existing datasets mix de jure\nand de facto elements together, and are highly aggregated,\nin stark contrast to IAEP which is disaggregated and mostly\nde jure. The largest category of institutional datasets is con-\ncerned with measuring democracy. The perhaps most popu-\nlar dataset is Polity (Marshall, 2010), which sets out to\nmeasure aspects of democracy based on Dahl's (1971) con-\nceptualization. Although Polity has a number of attractive\nfeatures (it disaggregates into sub-components, and has a\nlong time series), it has some important flaws. Most nota-\nbly, many of the sub-dimensions in Polity measure out-\ncomes rather than institutions, such as the participation\ncomponent which includes internal political violence as\npart of its coding (Vreeland, 2008). A similar critique of\ncoding bias has often been levelled at the Freedom House\ndataset, which bases most of its codings on subjective\nassessments of political outcomes that are entangled with\nmany potential dependent variables (Cheibub et al., 2010).\nAnother dataset that is affected by this criticism is the\nVanhanen dataset (Vanhanen, 2000), which measures con-\ntestation and participation based on electoral outcomes. A\ndataset that is considered to be more reliable and less sensi-\ntive to endogeneity biases is the ACLP/DD dataset\nmostly relies on objective coding criteria, e.g. the presence\nof elections with more than one party, it also captures polit-\nical contestation in the form of actual government turnover,\nwhich is partly also an institutional outcome, and thus sub-\nject to similar criticisms (see e.g. Knutsen and Wig, 2015).\nThe most ambitious democracy dataset to date is the V-Dem\n(Coppedge et al., 2011) project, which is currently develop-\ning a large collection of disaggregated democracy indica-\ntors. It fundamentally differs from IAEP since V-dem's\nfocus is mostly on subjectively coded de facto and not de\njure institutional characteristics, making it an important\ncomplement to IAEP when it becomes available. In short,\nIAEP is distinguished from existing democracy datasets in\ntheir focus on disaggregated de-jure institutions.\nA handful of other datasets have some points of similar-\nity with IAEP but lack its main focus on formal rules. For\nexample, the POLCON database (Henisz, 2002), and the\nDatabase of Political Institutions (Beck et al., 2001). The\nonly existing dataset that shares both IAEP's scope and\nfocusondejureinstitutions,istheComparativeConstitutions\nWig et al. 3\nProject (CCP) (Elkins et al., 2010), which codes a wide\nrange of constitutional provisions for all countries in the\nworld going back to 1789. Given the similar focus on de jure\ninstitutions, there is some overlap between the variables\ncontained in the CCP and IAEP. This can obviously be a\nbenefit, since a greater variety of sources for the same data\nis an undisputable good when investigating the robustness\nof empirical results to different sources. Furthermore, a\nnumber of institutional domains are covered in the IAEP\nthat are not covered in the CCP, and vice versa. For exam-\nple, many of the formal rules that are not constitutional, but\nstill de jure, like many provisions concerning the central\nbank, rules governing party participation in elections, candi-\ndate nomination and participation, and variables relating to\nthe outcomes and holding of elections themselves (which\nare not de jure).\nFocusing on formal institutions allows researchers to\nseparate the formal rules that may or may not constrain\nbehaviour from the behavioural outcomes that are produced\nby institutions, which most current datasets mix together.\nThis enables `unbundling' of institutions into formal and\nnon-formal components in a much more refined way than\nprevious attempts to disaggregate institutions (e.g.\nAcemoglu and Johnson, 2005). As many have pointed out\n(e.g. Voigt, 2013), lumping the behavioural and formal ele-\nments of institutions together in one measure is questiona-\nble. Conceptually, because there is a clear distinction\nbetween the normative content of a rule and its de facto\nimplementation. Empirically, because there are often clear\ndiscrepancies between de jure and de facto rules, as for\nexample Hayo and Voigt has shown in the case of judicial\nAnother clear strength of focusing on formal rules is\nthat they are easier to code reliably. As mentioned, many\nof the most common institutional indices are subjectively\ncoded and very often endogenous to outcomes of interest,\nsuch as economic growth (Glaeser et al., 2004) or inter-\nnal armed conflict (Vreeland, 2008). Coding de jure insti-\ntutions avoids this problem, and allows researchers to\nstudy the links between formal rules, institutional out-\ncomes (i.e. institutional behaviour), and variables of\ninterest.\nTo summarize, the IAEP is one of the few publicly avail-\nable dataset that describes the nuts and bolts of countries'\nde jure political institutions globally. It allows researchers\nto investigate how de jure political institutions constrain\nand shape behaviour and political outcomes. In the follow-\ning, we illustrate some of its potential uses.\nTrends in individual institutional indicators\nThe primary source from which most of the information in\nour dataset is derived is the constitution of a country or\nother legal documents. IAEP comprises information on a\nrange of individual constitutional provisions that are essen-\ntial in classifying regimes along dimensions such\nas democracy\u00adautocracy, degree of constitutionalism or\npower sharing. Figure 1 shows trends in the global propor-\ntion of countries that possess institutional provisions typi-\ncal of democracies; formal operational constitutions,2 a\nsupreme court,3 judicial review,4 elections to the executive\nand legislature,5 and a national legislature.6\nThe left box shows global trends in the presence of a\nsupreme court, a constitution, and judicial review; all ele-\nments of constitutional rule. The figure shows an increase\nin the presence of courts and judicial review, while most\ncountries have had operational formal constitutions\nthroughout the period. The right box in Figure 1 shows that\nthe number of countries holding elections has increased\nsteadily over time, reaching a peak in the mid-2000s. The\nsame goes for the proportion of countries with a supreme\ncourt. These developments align with the increase in the\nnumber of democracies in the `third wave of democracy'\nthat followed the end of the cold war (Huntington, 1991).\nThe figure also shows that the number of countries with\nlegislatures, and formal and operational constitutions has\nremained relatively stable throughout the period.\nFigure 2 shows global trends in the proportion of coun-\ntries having two constitutional provisions typical of autoc-\nracies: bans on specific parties and the presence of an\nofficial state party. This figure shows that these two auto-\ncratic institutions have, logically enough, declined with the\nspread of elections and judiciaries. After a spike in the early\ndownward trend after the end of the Cold War, coinciding\nwith the third wave of democracy. These two figures show\nhow the third wave of democratization can be tracked by\nlooking at individual de jure institutions.\nConstructing institutional\ndimensions\nIndividual indicators might often not yield significant\ninformation about a political system when considered in\nisolation, but may do so only when they are considered as\npart of an institutional dimension. In the following, we will\nillustrate some potential uses of the dataset by constructing\ntwo different indices. In doing so, we will both illustrate\nwhat kind of substantive indices are possible to construct\nwith the data, but also two different methodological\napproaches to index construction that are often found in the\nliterature: factor analysis and construction using the logic\nof necessary and sufficient conditions. This exercise is\nintended to illustrate two plausible indices and encourage\nusers of the dataset to develop their own.\nExecutive constraints\nThe first index we construct is intended to capture execu-\ntive constraints and will utilize a factor-analytic approach\n4 Research and Politics \nConstitutional provisions over time\nProportion of countries\nOperational formal constitution\nJudicial review\nSupreme court\nConstitutional provisions over time\nProportion of countries\nLegislature\nElections to the executive\nElections to the legislature\nFigure 1. Trends in individual constitutional provisions typical of democracies.\nWig et al. 5\nto index construction. This index builds on the IAEP-based\nexecutive constraints index presented in Regan et al.\n(2009). It includes items that either constitute an executive\npower \u00ad like an executive power to dissolve parliament \u00ad,\nor some sort of check on the executive \u00ad like a legislative\nveto. The following items are included as executive pow-\ners: The power to remove the legislature, propose legisla-\ntion, remove judges, amend constitution, ratify constitution,\nuse force abroad without legislative approval, change taxes\nwithout legislative approval, and whether the executive is\nchosen independently of legislature. The following are\nincluded as executive liabilities or checks: The existence of\na legislature, a legislative veto, legislature can remove the\nexecutive, legislature can propose legislation, legislature\ncan amend constitution, legislature can ratify amendments,\nthere are elections for the executive, legislative approval\nfor the budget is required, the court can rule on executive\naction, executive is a member of the legislature. The first\nset of items are conceived as powers given to the executive,\nwhile the last set of items includes constraints on the execu-\ntive. We proceed to fit a unidimensional Item Response\nModel using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, a factor-\nanalytic approach that has become standard in the develop-\nment of latent institutional indices (see e.g. Rosenthal and\nthis model estimates the ideal points (factor scores) for\neach country-year on the dimension that best describes the\npatterns of the individual institutional provisions men-\ntioned above.7\nFigure 3 shows the estimated ideal points for our execu-\ntive constraints index for a random sample of 60 countries\nin 2010. The latent index seems to do an acceptable job of\nseparating the cases with a very high score from the cases\nin the bottom of the ranking. However, because of the large\nconfidence intervals, there is a fair amount of uncertainty in\nthe cases in the middle of the scale.\nDoes this index track the executive constraints concept?\nThe country given the highest score on the latent dimen-\nsion, i.e. the most constrained, is Nicaragua in 1995, which\nhas a total of 9 of 10 of the executive liabilities mentioned\nabove, and 4 out of 9 of the executive powers listed above.\nCrucially, it has a number of important executive liabilities\nsuch as a legislative veto and the right of the legislature to\nremove the executive. The lowest-scoring country,\npowers. Crucially, it has a number of important executive\npowers; the executive can disband parliament and appoint\njudges. These cases indicate that the dimension is repre-\nsenting the degree of executive constraints. Figure 4 shows\nthe discrimination parameters of each institutional provi-\nsion, and the number of such provisions that the item\nresponse model correctly predicts. Executive liabilities are\nFigure 2. Trends in individual constitutional provisions typical of autocracies.\n6 Research and Politics \nhighlighted as triangles and powers are highlighted as\ncrosses. If the index is adequately separating constraints\nfrom executive powers it should group the powers and lia-\nbilities in opposite ends of the spectrum. The figure shows\nthat the latent dimension estimated by the Iterm Response\nTheory (IRT) model is not perfect at grouping liabilities\nand powers in two different clusters, although most liabili-\nties have positive discrimination parameters and most\npowers have negative coefficients. What this exercise\nshows is that our de jure institutional indicators can be used\nto construct latent variable indices. The figures presented\nabove show that the executive constraints index constructed\nhere does an imperfect, although not hopeless, job of sepa-\nrating countries on the theoretically relevant dimension.\nCombining de jure measures with information about de\nfacto institutions would be one way to construct a more\naccurate dimension.\nInstitutionalized participation\nSecond, we will construct an index of institutionalized par-\nticipation (IP) that illustrates how we can use theoretical\nprior information about the logical structure of the concept\nto calculate an index that more closely aligns with the theo-\nretical concept than simple aggregation or inductive factor\nanalysis. (For more on conceptual logic, see e.g. Goertz,\n2006.) We build this index with the intentions to measure\nthe degree to which electoral participation is institutionally\nprotected. A necessary condition for electoral participation\nis the presence of elections, therefore we start with a logical\ncondition stating that the measure should be scored as zero\nwhen there is no election to either the executive or the leg-\nislature. If and only if there are elections to at least the\nexecutive or the legislature, we consider whether there are\nrestrictions on (a) suffrage, and (b) political parties. If there\nis universal suffrage and no party restrictions, we want this\nmeasure to get a top score, while we want it to get the low-\nest score if it has fully restricted elections where many\ngroups are excluded and parties banned. Such a measure\nwould capture the fact that elections are necessary but not\nsufficient conditions for institutionalizing electoral partici-\npation; Only elections with universal suffrage and free\nparty competition are sufficient for saying that participation\nis fully institutionalized. Therefore, we construct IP as\nfollows:\nE\ni i i i\n= - +\n.( ( ))\nwhere E represents elections, PB is the number of party\nbans, normalized by dividing on the maximum value, SR is\nthe similarly normalized number of suffrage restrictions,\nand i signifies the given country. For simplicity, we scale IP\nto range between zero and one, where one signifies univer-\nsal suffrage and no party restrictions, while a score of zero\nmeans that you either have no elections, or elections with\nthe full amount of party and suffrage restrictions.\nIntermediate scores such as 0.45 mean elections with some\nrestrictions; this is, for example, the case for Cuba in the\n1980s which had elections with universal suffrage, but a\nban on all parties. This measure reflects the logical rela-\ntions between the items that make up the index; elections\nare necessary conditions for participation, but party bans\nand suffrage restrictions are alternative and substitutable\nways to block participation.\nApplication\nTo further illustrate how the IAEP data may be used, we\npresent a brief replication and extension of a recent study\ninvestigating the links between democracy and internal\narmed conflict where we use the institutionalized participa-\ntion index created above. Cederman et al. (2010) show that\ndemocratization leads to internal armed conflict. As one of\nseveral supporting arguments, they draw on the argument\nof Huntington (1968) that democratization can lead to con-\nflict because it entails sudden mass mobilization in institu-\ntional contexts that have not accommodated such pressures\nIndex\nEritrea\nMalaysia\nPakistan\nOman\nGuyana\nIraq\nVietnam\nEthiopia\nNew Zealand\nBhutan\nEstonia\nBahrain\nAustralia\nLibya\nCambodia\nSwitzerland\nNepal\nPapua New Guinea\nSuriname\nSingapore\nNamibia\nKenya\nPortugal\nFrance\nTurkey\nBelarus\nUzbekistan\nTurkmenistan\nComoros\nRwanda\nChad\nPeru\nGuinea\nKazakhstan\nRomania\nYugoslavia\nCameroon\nLiberia\nSlovakia\nUnited States of America\nDjibouti\nGuinea-Bissau\nGabon\nNiger\nBurundi\nMali\nMozambique\nArgentina\nSlovenia\nEast Timor\nPoland\nCongo\nUruguay\nCyprus\nTajikistan\nYemen\nIvory Coast\nMontenegro\nUkraine\nNicaragua\nFigure 3. Estimated ideal points on executive constraints\ndimension in 2010: The figures show a sample of 60 countries\nconfidence intervals based on the estimated standard deviation\nof the ideal point estimates.\nWig et al. 7\nbefore. In short, democratization is destabilizing when it\nleads to a sudden increase in political participation. One\nimplication of this argument is that we should observe less\nconflict in democratization processes where mass partici-\npation is already institutionalized. Where the institutions\nalready have accommodated mass participation, and the\ndemocratization process concerns some other institutional\nfeature such as an increase in constraints on the executive\nor an expansion of non-electoral political liberties, the risk\nof conflict should be lower. This can be formulated in the\nfollowing hypothesis.\nHypothesis 1. Institutional changes toward democracy\nincreases the risk of conflict where pre-existing levels of\nIP is low, but less so where participation is well\nestablished\nThis hypothesis is not tested in Cederman et al. (2010),\nbut is a logical implication of the mobilization argument.\nWe investigate H1 by interacting Cederman et al.'s democ-\nratization variable with the lagged level of IP as we have\ncoded it. We also interact democratization with lagged lev-\nels of the more subjective POLCOMP variable from Polity\nwhich captures the `democraticness' of participation and\nIAEP institutions are measured on the 1 January, while the\nPolity dataset used by Cederman et al. is coded on the 31\nDecember (Marshall et al., 2013, 12), our participation var-\niable should be considered as lagged by 1 year. POLCOMP\nis lagged by 1 year. Cederman et al. code democratization\nby using the POLITY index as a basis; they code a move-\nment in Polity as a democratization if it constitutes a move\nlarger than two points on the POLITY index, and if it is\nfollowed by a period of stability where the new level of\nPOLITY on average is more than two points higher than in\nthe previous stable period (see Cederman et al., 2010,\nIn their core model, Cederman et al. include their varia-\nble capturing democratization (dem), autocratization (aut),\nand controls for population, GDP per capita, and time trends\nusing calendar year, peace years and splines. The first col-\numn in Table 1 replicates their model 1.1. The second col-\numn runs the same model on the more restricted sample\nthat is covered by the IAEP. The third column tests our\nproposition, and indeed finds support for it. The main\nterm is significant and positive, and the interaction term\nsignificant, negative, and of equal size as the main\nterm. Democratization is particularly conflict-inducing in\nDiscrimination and prediction of Individual Items\n% Correctly classified\nDiscrimination parameter\nExecutive liabilities\nExecutive powers\nFigure 4. Estimated item discrimination parameters and percentage correctly classified item scores\n8 Research and Politics \ncontexts where the IP index is zero, while the effect of democ-\nratization on conflict drops with increases in IP at t - 1.\nThe upper box in Figure 5 shows the probability of con-\nflict given democratization (dem = 1), as IP increases, all\nother variables held at their means. This shows that the\nassociation between democratization and conflict weakens\nwith the level of pre-existing IP, suggesting that the effects\nof democratization might arise from sudden increases in\npolitical mobilization, as suggested by Huntington (1968)\namong others. During periods of no democratization, IP\nhas no effect on conflict risk, as indicated by the lower box\nin Figure 5. When we compare this result to the result found\nwhen using POLCOMP from Polity (the fourth column),\nwe do not find the same pattern. When the `democraticness'\nof participation is measured by POLCOMP, the level of IP\nalready in place when the transition happens seems to not\nmatter at all, contrary to the postulated mobilization mech-\nanism. There are several reasons to have more faith in the\nIAEP index than in POLCOMP. The latter mixes both de\njure and de facto restrictions on participation. The coding\nof its subcomponents includes behavioural aspects, includ-\ning categories such as `transitional' and `factional' compe-\ntition, which can be endogenous to political instability\nmore transparent and less tainted by endogeneity: it simply\ndenotes whether there are institutionalized elections and\nhow restricted participation is.\nConclusion\nThis update of the IAEP dataset makes a number of contribu-\ntions to the ongoing empirical study of the effects and causes\nTable 1.
