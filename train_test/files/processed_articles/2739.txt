USDA Snack Policy\nImplementation: Best Practices From the Front Lines, United\n Introduction\nThe Smart Snacks in Schools interim final rule was promulgated\nby the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) as authorized by\nplementation commenced beginning July 1, 2014; however, in the\nyears leading up to this deadline, national studies suggested that\nmost schools were far from meeting the USDA standards. Evid-\nence to guide successful implementation of the standards is\nneeded. This study examined snack policy implementation in ex-\nemplary high schools to learn best practices for implementation.\nMethods\nGuided by a multiple case study approach, school professionals (n\n= 37) from 9 high schools across 8 states were recruited to be in-\nterviewed about perceptions of school snack implementation;\nschools were selected using criterion sampling on the basis of the\nHealthierUS Schools Challenge: Smarter Lunchrooms (HUSSC:\nSL) database. Interview transcripts and internal documents were\norganized and coded in ATLAS.Ti v7; 2 researchers coded and\nanalyzed data using a constant comparative analysis method to\nidentify best practice themes.\nResults\nBest practices for snack policy implementation included incorpor-\nating the HUSSC: SL award's comprehensive wellness approach;\nleveraging state laws or district policies to reinforce snack reform\ninitiatives; creating strong internal and external partnerships; and\ncrafting positive and strategic communications.\nConclusion\nImplementation of snack policies requires evidence of successful\nexperiences from those on the front lines. As federal, state, and\nlocal technical assistance entities work to ensure implementation\nof the Smart Snacks standards, these best practices provide\nstrategies to facilitate the process.\nIntroduction\nWith the passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010\n(P.L. 111\u00ad296), Congress authorized the US Department of Agri-\nculture (USDA) to establish nutrition standards for nonmeal-pro-\ngram items sold in schools during the school day (also known as\n\"competitive foods and beverages\") (1). In June 2013, the USDA\nissued an interim final rule, \"Smart Snacks in Schools,\" which was\nto be implemented as of July 1, 2014 (2). However, during the\nschool year leading up to the deadline, unhealthy snack items re-\nschool year, 87% of high school students nationwide still had ac-\ncess to sugar-sweetened beverages through snack venues (3), thus\ncausing concern that full implementation of the standards may be\ndelayed.\nA systematic review reported a small but positive link between\nhealthful snack policies and outcomes such as decreased student\nconsumption of unhealthful snacks and decreased availability of\nunhealthful snacks (4). Few studies examine how the regulated\nstandards are translated from policy to school practices (5,6). Such\nevidence could be used by schools struggling with translating\nThe opinions expressed by authors contributing to this journal do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the U.S. Department of Health\nand Human Services, the Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the authors' affiliated institutions.\nSmart Snacks standards into practice. The objective of this study\nwas to learn best practices from high schools that successfully im-\nplemented stringent snack guidelines so those practices could be\nused by other schools before they began implementing the Smart\nSnacks standards.\nMethods\nA multiple case-study approach allowed us to examine high\nschools in their natural setting (7). This approach aligned well\nwith the purpose of this study because federal and state mandates\ndo not allow for randomization of high schools. The main re-\nsearch question was: among high schools with strong snack prac-\ntices, what are the critical factors that allowed the practices to be\nimplemented successfully? By identifying these factors, we were\nable to determine best practices for snack policy implementation.\nHigh schools were selected as cases because they typically have\nthe worst snack environments of all school levels (3). To select\nfrom schools already recognized for rigorous snack practices, we\nused the HealthierUS School Challenge: Smarter Lunchrooms\ndatabase (HUSSC: SL) as a sampling frame. In February 2014,\n203 high schools achieved some level of HUSSC: SL award\nstatus. From this sampling frame, we used criterion sampling prin-\nciples (8) to select 9 high schools with a range of state, district,\nand school characteristics from the Bridging the Gap state law\nand district and school-level socioeconomic data from the Nation-\nal Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Common Core Data\nThe University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Institutional Review\nBoard approved this study (institutional review board protocol no.\nschool district superintendents before contacting school profes-\nsionals via email to invite them for key informant, semistructured\nsionals were contacted if they were involved with snack policy im-\nplementation as identified by the food service director (FSD),\nschool principal, or superintendent. The interview guide was based\non research findings already published, pilot-tested with an FSD,\nand iteratively revised on the basis of feedback from external\nschool professionals and USDA officials. On the basis of the FSD\nguide, we modified guides intended to be used with other school\nprofessionals. The interview guide contained questions about im-\nplementing the snack policy, the key stakeholders in having the\npolicy implemented or not implemented, the facilitators and barri-\ners to implementing the policy, and sources of technical assist-\nance. The guides are available by request to the first author. Tele-\nphone interviews lasted from 45 to 70 minutes and were audio-\ntaped and transcribed. Post-interview notes and a detailed, ongo-\ning study audit trail were updated and consulted during analysis.\nTo triangulate interview findings, we collected internal docu-\nments such as each school district's wellness and snack policies,\nnewsletters, and Facebook pages.\nOver 140 documents comprising interview transcripts, internal\ndocuments, and post interview summaries were uploaded into At-\nlas.ti v.7 (Scientific Software Development GmbH) for organiza-\ntion and coding. External school professionals, USDA officials,\nand expert researchers informed iterative revisions of an a priori\ncoding guide. The coding process was guided by Salda\u00f1a's first-\nand second-pass coding, with the goal of turning the large data set\ninto organized, categorized, and small, manageable constructs for\nanalysis (12). Two analysts read through and independently coded\n20% of the transcripts; rounds of coding continued until 80%\ninter-rater agreement was reached (13). The analysts met regu-\nlarly to discuss revisions to the coding guide, emergent themes,\nand explanations of memos. These ongoing discussions facilitated\nthe iterative process of theme generation and refinement. Each\nanalyst then created detailed case summaries that outlined the\ntimelines and implementation process for each high school; this\nprocess allowed for an in-depth understanding of the contexts and\nnuances of the phenomenon in each unique case. Cross-case ana-\nlysis (7) guided a process that looked for emergent themes and\ncommonalities across the cases. One important component of this\nprocess included negative case analysis, which compared snack\npolicy implementation across cases in order to spot outliers and\ndeepen theme generation. The coding and analysis process is de-\nscribed in full elsewhere, including the steps taken to ensure rigor-\nous team analysis (14). Lastly, adhering to principles of trustwor-\nthiness, we enhanced the rigor of study findings by including con-\ntinuous peer debriefing and a detailed audit trail (15).\nResults\nThe characteristics of the 9 high schools in the study are in Table\n1. As the table indicates, the schools were in 9 districts and 8\nstates and spanned all 4 Census regions. Based on the Bridging\nstates with strong laws and some in states with weak state laws.\nState snack laws -- specifically those applicable to snack food\nsales in vending machines, \u00e0 la carte cafeteria lines, school stores,\nclassroom parties, and fundraising -- were coded using a rigorous\ncoding scheme adapted from Schwartz et al (16). For each loca-\ntion of sale, state laws were coded for a series of nutrient and\nbeverage standards. Provisions in state law that were \"encour-\naged\" we classified as weak. Also weak were laws that used terms\nsuch as \"should\" or \"may,\" or that allowed exceptions, or that ap-\nThe opinions expressed by authors contributing to this journal do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,\nthe Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the authors' affiliated institutions.\nplied only at certain times of the day or at certain sale locations. In\ncontrast, strong laws definitively required specific food and bever-\nage standards and used terms such as \"shall,\" \"must,\" and \"re-\nquire.\" Fourteen individual variables were coded for strength for\neach sale location. A composite scale measured the proportion of\nthe 14 individual items coded for each sale location that were\ndefinitively \"strong.\" The resulting strength scale ranged from 0 to\n100, with 100 being the highest score for provisions that were re-\nquired by law (9). It is notable that the highest score was 47 of 100\n(Mississippi) with all others scoring below 34 of 100. In addition,\nsome schools were located in large districts and some in small\nThe schools also varied by locale (city, town, suburban, rural), by\nracial/ethnic makeup of the student population, by socioeconomic\nstatus (range: 17% free- or reduced-price lunch participation\n[FRLP] to 89% FRPL), and by state rate for childhood obesity\n(range: 28% in Iowa to 40% in Mississippi).\nGiven the focus on FSDs and principals in school wellness literat-\nure, we made a concerted effort to include a wide range of school\nprofessionals in this study (Table 2). Respondents (n = 39) were\n11 district FSDs, 8 athletic directors/PE teachers/boosters, 7 prin-\ncipals/vice principals, 5 cafeteria managers, and the remaining 8\nrespondents were a nurse, consumer science/health teacher, tech-\nnical assistance provider, or a finance administrator. We inter-\nviewed a minimum of 3 school professionals per case, with 4 or\nmore school professionals interviewed in 7 of the 9 cases.\nThe findings are derived from cross-case analysis across high\nschools and respondent types. Because FSDs had the most pivotal\nrole in implementation, the findings are reported from the FSDs'\nperspective, with supporting quotes from additional respondents.\nFSDs used a variety of models for implementing a successful\nsnack policy, which is evident from several overarching themes\ndescribed in the Box.\nBox. Best Practices for Snack Policy Implementation: Key Themes, United\nTheme 1 Implementation and acceptance takes time and continued\neffort.\nTheme 2 HUSSC: SL certification was a critical catalyst.\nTheme 3 FSDs leaned on the power of state law and district policies.\nTheme 4 Internal and external partnerships increased capacity.\nTheme 5 Strategic communications changed perceptions.\nAbbreviations: FSD, food service director; HUSSC: SL, HealthierUS\nSchools Challenge: Smarter Lunchrooms.\nTheme 1: Implementation and acceptance take\ntime and continued effort\nAll FSDs shared that implementation required a series of activit-\nies that took time and continued effort to keep \"plugging away at\nit.\" Many FSDs began reforming the school food and snack envir-\nonment several years before the Smart Snacks deadline, and des-\npite attaining HUSSC: SL status, most were still planning initiat-\nives toward boosting student acceptance of various components. A\nbooster club leader from Mississippi shared:\nWe've never been asked to deviate from our menu because of it\nbeing in concessions . . . . If we had to adhere to those standards, I\ndon't think we'd be as successful as we are now. I think over time\nwe would because it would be an initial culture shock if we had to\nremove all carbonated drinks. I think we will initially have a change,\nbut overall, and I guess a few years down the road, I think it would\nbecome just common and end up being OK.\nTheme 2: HUSSC: SL certification was a critical\ncatalyst\nThe HUSSC: SL award was reported to be a catalyst for snack\npolicy implementation in 2 main ways. First, attaining any award\nstatus required that the school demonstrate to the USDA that they\nare implementing both the snack and district wellness policy com-\nprehensively; these combined efforts facilitated an enhanced\nawareness of health and wellness. In particular, school profession-\nals described nutrition education programs as a strong facilitator of\nsnack reforms. An FSD from Mississippi shared that nutrition edu-\ncation created \"another partner in the classroom.\" Second, many\nhigh schools faced challenges during school meal reform [ie, im-\nplementation of the USDA standards: Nutrition Standards in the\nNational School Lunch and Breakfast Programs (17)], which was\ndue for implementation 2 years before Smart Snacks. The\nHUSSC: SL award brought positive recognition and boosted the\nreputation of any food service department that attained it. An FSD\nfrom Iowa said \"It helped to get the HealthierUS School Chal-\nlenge, it helped to get patted on the back, to make these kids real-\nize, the teachers, and the parents, realize that the kids weren't get-\nting tortured\" [laughs]. Such recognition from the school com-\nmunity at large facilitated the FSDs' ongoing initiatives to im-\nprove the school food environment.\nTheme 3: FSDs leaned on the power of state law\nand district policies\nAlthough a change in policy alone may be insufficient to change\nschool practice (18), the existence of a policy can act as a strong\nfacilitator for implementation. FSDs across cases had varying\nlevels of power and influence in their school districts; however, all\nleaned on a district policy, state law, or both to \"reinforce\" their\nThe opinions expressed by authors contributing to this journal do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,\nthe Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the authors' affiliated institutions.\ninitiatives. As a Texas FSD said, \"Schools make decisions based\non policy. The curriculum is based on policy. Even salaries are\nbased on school board policies. So as long as there's a policy that\nis within hands' reach, so you can actually print it out and put it on\npaper, it helps to reinforce what we're doing.\"\nIn addition, school professionals from states with strong laws\noverwhelmingly referenced the law as a catalyst for implementa-\ntion. The power of state law was evident in discussions with prin-\ncipals, who despite having minimal interest in snack reform and\nwellness activities, referenced it as a reason for compliance. Ac-\ncording to a principal from Mississippi, \"And it's that you just\nhave to be in compliance with the state nutrition guidelines. That's\nwhen you're serving food in the cafeteria as well as in the vend-\ning machines, here on campus. Either one, the state has adopted\nsuch policies. I mean, we were pretty much forced to. It's state\nlaw.\" Essentially, the power of the district policy or state law was\nevident in comments from all school professionals.\nTheme 4: Internal and external partnerships and\ncollaborations increased capacity\nIt is important to acknowledge that these initiatives were added to\nFSDs' existing duties and responsibilities. As a result, FSDs em-\nphasized that internal and external partnerships and collaborations\nincreased their own capacity for implementation. One FSD from\nCalifornia recalled his reliance on partnerships and collaborations:\nI really reached out to the larger nutrition community as a whole.\nFor example, I'm just gonna name a few of our collaborators: an in-\nsurance group, not-for-profit community health, let's see -- Alliance\nfor Healthier Generation, the farmers market, the State Depart-\nment of Education. I incorporated a lot of these collaborations and\npartnerships to utilize their resources. Because I myself alone,\nthere's no way that I could've made these changes.\nThe most salient internal partnership cited by all respondents was\nwith school leadership; as the \"go-to person\" and \"hub of commu-\nnications,\" the principal was a critical stakeholder. Further, the\nmost notable external partnerships across cases were with state de-\npartments of education and respective child nutrition divisions,\nwhich provided invaluable hands-on technical assistance and re-\nsources, as well as peer networks with partner school districts. An\nFSD from Illinois explained, \"I have kind of a monthly call with\nthem [peer FSDs] and we share some of our challenges and best\npractices. We visit each other's schools and districts to see what\nyou're doing, what I'm doing, how can I incorporate some of what\nyou're doing, how can you incorporate what I'm doing.\"\nFSDs creatively relied on a range of partnerships and collabora-\ntions for technical assistance and additional resources; this best\npractice was especially critical given that these individuals led\nsnack (and wellness) policy implementation in addition to their ex-\nisting job responsibilities.\nTheme 5: Strategic communications changed\nperceptions\nSchool professionals expressed that removing unhealthful junk\nfoods (ie, low nutrient and high sugar, fat, calorie, and sodium\nfood and beverage items) was \"the right thing to do.\" A critical\npractice during implementation was extending their perceptions to\nothers within and outside the school community about the value\nand intentions of the snack policy. One FSD in Iowa said, \"It's ter-\nrible, they didn't want the government telling them what to do.\nAnd I can understand that, I don't really like the government\ntelling me what to do, but in my view, it wasn't that, it's showing\nthese kids healthy guidelines.\"\nIn this way, the FSDs' communications with key stakeholders\nabout the potential impact of the snack policy fostered support for\ntheir initiatives. As an FSD in Virginia recalled from school meal\nstandards implementation, many stakeholders were misinformed\nabout reform efforts. Thus, learning from that experience, she took\nan active approach when dealing with snack policy implementa-\ntion by focusing heavily on messaging and communications that\nframed school snacks reform in a positive light: \"share, share, and\nshare your successes!\"\nDiscussion\nThis study contributes to the limited best practices evidence for\nSmart Snacks implementation in US high schools. Overall, school\nprofessionals reported that implementation is taking time and is an\nongoing effort, which is an encouraging finding for struggling\nschools still in the process of fully adhering to Smart Snacks.\nHUSSC: SL certification was reported to be a strong catalyst be-\ncause of its emphasis on a comprehensive wellness approach; this\nfinding is consistent with a study by Bassler and colleagues (19),\nwho also examined snack reform in middle and high school dis-\ntricts. In the current study, FSDs noted that HUSSC: SL acted as a\nfacilitator, bringing positive recognition for the child nutrition de-\npartment. FSDs operate in complex contexts in the school com-\nmunity, and initiatives that boost the reputation and awareness of\nFSDs can act as facilitators for their initiatives. Because working\ntoward receiving the HUSSC: SL was reported as a best practice,\norganizations providing technical assistance to schools should en-\ncourage schools to strive for this award.\nThe opinions expressed by authors contributing to this journal do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,\nthe Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the authors' affiliated institutions.\nImplementers also leaned on state law and district policy as\nsources of power to legitimize and reinforce their initiatives. This\nfinding is a more nuanced explanation of what is known from cur-\nrent research findings: showing a link between a stringent state\nlaw and more healthful school practices and student-level out-\ncomes (20\u00ad25). Given that school districts tend to follow state\nstandards, these findings indicate that leadership from the state\nlevel has strong potential for helping FSDs implement their health-\nful initiatives. Local and state technical assistance providers\nshould consider training FSDs to maximize their ability to lever-\nage local policies and state laws for the benefit of programs that\nreduce unhealthful snacks in schools. This finding also provides a\nrationale for advocacy at all levels in support of state laws that im-\nprove snack policies for schools.\nFSDs also pointed to the challenge of leading snack policy imple-\nmentation in addition to their regular duties; their efforts to build\nstrong partnerships and collaborations were essential to boost their\ncapacity and increase access to needed resources. This finding\nmay be especially salient to FSDs in school districts with limited\nresources for wellness and nutrition activities. External organiza-\ntions, such as local public health departments and nonprofit tech-\nnical assistance providers may be open to partnerships and collab-\norations with schools for wellness-related efforts.\nLastly, strategic and positive communication also emerged as a\nbest practice, highlighting the essential role that FSDs play in\nshaping and framing food-related policy implementation for the\nschool community. Recently, the USDA issued a final rule ad-\ndressing professional standards for school nutrition programs; un-\nder this rule, one of the 4 training categories listed includes com-\nmunications and marketing (26). Technical assistance providers\nshould consider emphasizing this category for professional devel-\nopment with FSDs as well as with other school professionals who\nare involved with Smart Snacks implementation.\nThe best practices that emerged here were drawn from exemplary\nhigh schools across the United States; they may not reflect the ex-\nperiences of more typical high schools nationwide. Because the\nobjective of this study was to provide best practices to inform im-\nplementation for other high schools, the sampling strategy fo-\ncused on the exemplary case; however, future studies should fo-\ncus on a typical case for a more comprehensive understanding of\nimplementation in schools. In addition, the study is missing input\nfrom a few key stakeholder groups, including students, parents,\nand state technical assistance providers. Future studies should fo-\ncus on perspectives provided by these additional groups. Further-\nmore, this article does not present findings on monitoring and en-\nforcement activities that occurred during and after implementation\nprocesses, which are critical to the success of full implementation.\nDespite these limitations, this study is one of the few that ex-\namined US snack policy implementation in high schools from a\nprocess rather than outcomes perspective. The study design and\nexecution were guided by external school practitioners and USDA\nofficials to ensure that findings were relevant to both practice and\npolicy. Finally, to engage a wide range of voices (eg, FSDs, PE\nteachers, cafeteria managers) this study expanded the range of\nschool professionals typically involved in published studies; this\nprocess purposefully included the stakeholders that must be in-\nvolved for successful implementation of Smart Snacks in schools.\nAs schools nationwide work toward full implementation of Smart\nSnacks, this study provides evidence that schools still working to-\nward full adherence should adopt our list of best practices.\n"
