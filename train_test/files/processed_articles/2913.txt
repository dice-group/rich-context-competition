In fact, a significant number of these mergers involves either dis-\ntressed targets or, less frequently, distressed acquirers. It appears that mergers\nat times also serve the objective to prevent banks from failure. Particularly\namong savings and cooperative banks, problem institutions are normally not\ndissolved but, instead, are merged with a neighboring institution in the same\nbanking group. An analysis of the factors determining mergers in the banking\nsector must take account of this fact to avoid reaching the wrong conclusions.\nThe present study is the first merger analysis in Germany that is based on\nBundesbank data on mergers and distressed banks in the industry. These data\nmake it possible to distinguish between distressed and non-distressed merg-\ners. The banks can be divided into six categories. Both acquiring institutions\nand acquired institutions are subdivided into banks with problems and banks\nwithout problems. A further category comprises institutions which have been\nintensively scrutinized by the supervisory authority but which have remained\nin existence without being the subject of a merger. In addition, institutions\nwhich, in the observation period, were neither classified as problem cases nor\nbecame the subject of a merger have been included as a control group.\nUsing this classification, we model the wave of consolidation as a stochas-\ntic process involving the six possible situations in which an institution may\nfind itself. The various probabilities are estimated using a multi-nominal logit\nmodel based on the institution-specific data. This form of modelling enables us\nto subject the different financial profiles of the institutions to an econometric\nanalysis.\nOur results show that most mergers involve institutions with a comparatively\npoor financial profile. This is precisely what one would expect in the case of\ninstitutions which have been reported as problem cases to the supervisory\nauthority. What is surprising, however, is that the institutions taken over in\nnon-distressed mergers are often also in a comparatively precarious state. In\nmany cases the principal aim of such mergers therefore seems to be to prevent\nproblem cases arising at all or to correct such cases in the face of failure.\nIn both problem and no problem mergers we find that it is largely size and\ncapitalization that determines if a bank is more likely to become an acquirer.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nDie Konsolidierungswelle im deutschen Bankensektor hat dazu gef\u00fchrt, dass\ndie Zahl der Kreditinstitute seit Jahren best\u00e4ndig zur\u00fcckgeht.

Regulatory discretion and potential\nfinancial instability due to loss of public confidence ensure that information\nabout distressed mergers is rarely available. As a result, most bank merger\nstudies are unable to control for the existence of hidden bailouts. This shortfall\nmay lead to serious selection bias. For example, it may explain why previous\nstudies find that merging banks underperform compared to the rest of the\nmarket.\nIn this study we use a unique confidential data set provided by the German\nBundesbank. The data consist of detailed information on approximately 1,000\nDuring this period, bailouts accounted for about 10 percent of bank mergers.\nWe use undisclosed information on the regulatory intervention history to dis-\ntinguish between distressed and non-distressed mergers. Rather than defining\ndistress ourselves, we make use of the Bundesbank data to distinguish dis-\ntressed mergers from voluntary mergers, thereby reducing an important de-\npendency problem that exists in the literature (Wheelock and Wilson, 2000).\nAs a result, we can gain a much better understanding of bank merger mo-\n1 Email addresses: m.koetter@econ.uu.nl (M.

While\nno commercial banks failed during this period, a substantial number of German\nbank mergers were attributable to bailouts of distressed institutions by regulatory\nmerger motives exist, including the improvement of efficiency, diversification of earn-\nings and risk, growth through acquisition, realization of economies of scale or scope,\nor increase in market power.\nIf banks cherry pick top performing targets, we expect to find that economies of\nscale, market power, or managerial incentives motivate mergers. On the other\nhand, the efficient management hypothesis (e.g., see Roll, 1986) proposes that\nacquiring banks replace poorly performing target bank management by more\nfind that managerial efficiency tends to improve after bank mergers. However,\nfew studies examine efficiency as an ex ante determinant of mergers. In this\nstudy we use measures of X-efficiency derived from stochastic frontier analyses\nto investigate the role of cost and profit efficiency as a merger motive. Also,\nwe employ a variety of covariates to capture the financial profiles of merging\nbanks.\nWe find that among merging banks, distressed banks had the worst profiles and\nacquirers performed somewhat better than targets. However, both distressed\nand non-distressed mergers had worse CAMEL profiles than our control group.\nThus, cherry picking high performing targets is not supported by our empirical\nevidence. In fact, non-distressed mergers may be motivated by the desire to\nforestall serious future financial distress and prevent regulatory intervention.\nAn important implication of our results is that the inability to account for\nhidden bailouts is indeed a salient error in the bank merger literature.\nOur paper continues as follows. First, in section 2 we review the relevant liter-\nature on bank mergers with a particular focus on potential path dependency\nproblems of failures and acquisitions. In section 3, we describe our methodol-\nogy and data. We define five different merger events and a set of explanatory\ncovariates that characterize the financial profile of banks. Next, in section 4 we\npresent our empirical results. We start by quantifying the effects of changes\nin banks' financial profiles on the respective probabilities that they will be\ninvolved in a particular type of merger. We then report evidence on the im-\nportance of accounting for various groups of banks that participated in the\nmerger wave. We conclude in section 5.\n2 Literature\nClosely related to the present study, Wheelock and Wilson (2000) compare\ncharacteristics of U.S. banks (greater than $50 million in assets) that exited\nvia failure versus those that exited through acquisition in the years 1984-1993.\nThey apply a competing-risks framework to these alternative forms of exit and\nestimate separate, independent models for failure and acquisition using a Cox\n(1972) proportional-hazard approach. They point out that it is possible that\nthese exit paths are dependent on one another, as impending failure could\nmotivate an acquisition. To partially account for this potential dependency,\nthey include the ratio of equity to total assets in their acquisition model. In-\ndeed, they find that this variable is significant and that failure risk helps to\nexplain some acquisitions. They employ two classes of independent variables:\n(1) different components of CAMEL ratings (i.e., capital, asset quality, man-\nagement quality, and liquidity), and (2) bank traits including size, holding\ncompany and branching status, and age. They measure management quality\nwith efficiency scores derived from cross-sectional translog cost functions and\nnonparametric Shepard (1970) input and output distance functions. In their\nstudy, distress can lead to outright failure or exit via a merger. Failed banks\nare defined as either banks closed by the FDIC or banks with tier 1 capital\nratios less than two percent (i.e., critically undercapitalized under bank reg-\nulatory laws). 5 Their results indicate that banks most likely to fail tend to\nhave lower operating efficiency and weaker financial condition. By contrast,\nacquired banks tend to have higher managerial efficiency and can be char-\nacterized by stronger financial profiles than other banks. Also, smaller banks\nand banks in branch banking states are more likely to be acquired than other\nbanks. The authors conclude that managerially inefficient and financially weak\nbanks are more (less) likely to exit via failure (acquisition). Hence, these two\ntypes of exit are quite different from one another. 6\nImportantly, other empirical studies by Hannan and Rhoades (1987), O'Keefe\nof Wheelock and Wilson. In general, they find that target banks have a worse\nfinancial profile than acquirers. One possible explanation for these different\nresults is that Wheelock and Wilson carefully control for both failed and fi-\nnancially distressed banks in their sampling procedures. Alternatively, differ-\nent results may be explained by sample differences in terms of country, period,\nand types of banks under investigation.\nHannan and Rhoades (1987) hypothesize that poorly managed banks are more\nlikely to exit than other banks due to the market for corporate control. For\nbanks and 201 mergers. They include measures of bank performance and bank\nmarket characteristics and distinguish between three categories: (1) no acqui-\nsition, (2) acquisition within one geographic market, and (3) acquisition be-\ntween two markets. While none of the profit, loan activity, or size variables\n5 This capital ratio is computed as total equity capital less goodwill divided by\ntotal assets.\n6 A more recent paper by Wheelock and Wilson (2003) investigates the reasons why\nsome banks engage in mergers and other banks do not, including the intensity of\nmerger activity. Focusing on the effects of regulatory supervision on merger activity,\nthey find that banks with higher quality regulatory CAMEL and CRA ratings, lower\nmarket concentration, location in an urban market, larger asset size, and higher asset\nrisk tend to increase merger activity among banks. See also Calomiris and Karceski\n(1998) for research on case studies of merger motivations.\nis significant, measures of bank market share, bank growth, market growth,\nand location in local versus urban areas are. Also, banks with lower capital\nratios are more likely to be acquired. Based on their findings, they conclude\nthat there is no support for the notion that the market for corporate control\neliminates poorly managed banks.\nExtending Hannan and Rhoades, O'Keefe (1996) applies a stepwise logit re-\ngression model to identify both targets and acquirers among the population\nmergers among affiliated bank holding company institutions but including\nregulatory-assisted mergers, he finds that target banks have significantly lower\nprofits than acquirers, as well as higher expenses on fixed assets and more core\ndeposits. Using proxies for CAMEL rating components, targets tend to have\nrelatively low management quality, low earnings, and low liquidity. Also, tar-\ngets are smaller in asset size than acquirers.\nThompson (1997) examines the determinants of acquisitions of U.K. build-\nally owned, results are similar to those for joint stock companies. The logit\nmodel results showed that targets (including those involved in regulatory-\nassisted mergers) are more likely than other banks to have a smaller asset\nsize, slower asset growth, retained earnings below regulatory requirements,\nand negative profits. Thompson concludes that building societies with low\nearnings are likely to be encouraged by regulators to consider acquisition by\nstronger institutions.\nIn a related study, Worthington (2004) evaluates the determinants of mergers\namong mutual credit unions in Australia. He estimates technical and scale effi-\nciency indices using data envelopment analysis (DEA) and employs a multino-\nmial logit model to examine the factors that help explain if a credit union is\nacquired, acquiring, or not engaged in any merger activity. In addition to cost\nefficiency, he also uses proxies for CAMEL components. Results show that\n50 percent of targets and 60 percent of acquirers are correctly identified by\nthe model. Overall classification accuracy is about 96 percent. Worthington\nfinds that target banks tend to be relatively small in size and have low liq-\nuidity. However, cost efficiency measures of managerial ability -- that is, scale\nefficiency (measured by overall technical efficiency divided by pure technical\nefficiency) and optimal sizes (measured by increasing or decreasing returns-\nto-scale) -- are not significant. Acquirers tend to be larger, more profitable,\nand scale efficient banks. Thus, managerially efficient credit unions tend to\npurchase targets that are less efficient.\nHadlock, Houston, and Ryngaert (1999) focus on studying the role of man-\nagerial incentives in 287 U.S. bank mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in the\nment ownership are more likely to be acquired. After acquisition, management\nturnover rates increase. However, profitability (as measured by return on as-\nsets) is not a significant determinant in mergers. They conclude that man-\nagement entrenchment (or resistance) is a determining factor in bank M&A\nactivity.\nRelatively few studies of European bank M&As have been published. Van-\ndifferent types of consolidations: (1) cross-border takeovers; (2) domestic ac-\nquisitions in which more than 50 percent of the voting control is obtained by\nthe acquirer but the two institutions remain independent legal entities; (3)\ndomestic mergers among equal-sized banks; (4) domestic mergers of large and\nsmall banks in which the latter are absorbed by the former to form a single,\nlarger bank. Takeovers of failed banks are excluded from the analyses. Based\non univariate statistical tests, he finds that targets are less profitable and cost\nefficient (as measured by the deviation of bank total costs from a translog\ncost frontier) than acquirers in cross-border takeovers. In the case of domes-\ntic acquisitions, acquirers are larger, more profitable, and input-efficient, but\ntargets are not significantly different from a control group of banks. For do-\nmestic mergers of equals, both target and acquirer banks suffer declines in\nprofits and operational efficiency prior to the merger event (with a reversal in\nthese trends afterwards). Finally, for domestic mergers of unequal-sized banks,\npre-merger performance is similar among targets and acquirers. Interestingly,\nwhen targets have inferior performance prior to M&As, acquirers are unable\nto improve their performance after consolidation. Thus, the evidence appears\nto be mixed. Whether underperforming banks are more likely to be targets\ndepends on the type of consolidation.\nClosely related to our work, Lang and Welzel (1999) examine the cost effi-\nciency implications of mergers among German cooperative banks in Bavaria\n(i.e., about 25 percent of the total cooperative bank population). They sample\nmeasure cost X-efficiency. When they calculate ex ante and ex post merger effi-\nciency differences among acquired and acquirer banks, they find that acquiring\nbanks are less efficient than acquired banks in 47 percent of the mergers. In\nonly 70 out of 283 mergers, the acquired bank is less efficient than the acquir-\ning banks. In these cases ex post efficiency of the acquired banks generally\ndoes not improve. They infer that the cost efficiency motive for mergers is not\nstrongly supported by the empirical evidence -- that is, acquired banks are not\nselected by acquiring banks with the intention of improving their operating\nefficiency and thereby increasing profitability of the combined entity. Instead,\nregulatory and other considerations have historically been important factors\nmotivating cooperative bank mergers, including prohibition of mergers with\nother banks outside the region, restriction to only cooperative bank deals,\nand even the retirement of senior managers. These non-economic motivations\nhave tended to diminish the role of financial performance in merger decisions\namong German cooperative banks.\nFocarelli, Panetta, and Salleo (2002) investigate bank M&As in Italy for the\ncharacteristics distinguish bidders and targets from banks that do not engage\nin M&As. They find that targets are less profitable and have higher labor costs,\nboth of which suggest low performance compared to other banks. Acquired\nbanks are characterized by relatively low profitability, low costs of funds, and\nmany bad loans. An interesting finding is that mergers are associated with ex-\npansion of financial services, whereas acquisitions are related to improving the\nquality of the loan portfolio. Ex post analyses of bank performance confirms\nthat mergers and acquisitions are quite different forms of exit with separate\nmotives and outcomes.\nVander Vennet (2003) examines the determinants and effects of 62 cross-border\nother banks, he uses a multinomial logit model to discriminate between ac-\nquiring, acquired, and control banks but does not distinguish between failing\nor distressed banks from other banks in the former two groups. Although the\nfit of the model is relatively low, with a pseudo R2 of only 20 percent, re-\nsults clearly indicate that acquiring buyers have lower (higher) cost (profit)\nratios than acquired banks. Thus, acquired banks tend to be underperformers\nrelative to acquiring banks. In further analyses he compares cost and profit\nefficiency scores of these two bank groups prior to M&A deals. Following Lang\nand Welzel (1996), he uses a translog functional form to estimate X-efficiency.\nRanked efficiency scores of acquired banks are significantly lower than those of\nacquiring banks, especially with respect to profit efficiency. Tests of pre- versus\npost-M&A cost and profit efficiency reveal that profit efficiency of acquired\nbanks rises to the control (peer) group level after the acquisition.\nA number of studies have compared the efficiency of banks involved in M&A\ndeals with simple measures of efficiency and performance. For 135 U.S. bank\ntakeovers, Cheng, Gup, and Wall (1989) report that profit ratios of target\nbanks are higher than those of acquirer banks, although mean differences\nare insignificant. Berger and Humphrey (1992) study mega mergers involving\nbanks exceeding $1 billion in assets and find that bidder banks are on average\nmore X-efficient (relative to a translog stochastic frontier) than target banks.\nIn a study of U.S. commercial bank mergers, Rhoades (1993) finds that bidder\nbanks have significantly lower noninterest expense to assets ratios than target\nbanks. Fixler and Zieschang (1993) note that 160 acquiring banks have higher\nproductivity (measured by an aggregate output index of efficiency) than a\ntarget banks have lower financial performance than acquirers that do not\nimprove after M&As. And, Avkiran (1999) finds that mean efficiency scores\n(estimated using data envelopment analysis, or DEA, techniques) of acquired\nAustralian trading banks are lower than those of acquiring banks. 7\nIn sum, with the notable exception of Wheelock and Wilson, previous studies\nof depository institution acquisitions generally find that targets are either low\nperforming or no different from other banks. Potentially, the result of Whee-\nlock and Wilson differ due to the fact that they control for regulatory-assisted\nmergers in their sampling procedures. In the present study we explicitly con-\ntrol for German cooperative and savings bank mergers where at least one\nbank is deemed distressed by regulatory authorities. These banks are subject\nto regulatory intervention by the Bundesbank. Unlike previous studies, we are\ninterested in comparing the determinants of two types of target bank exit: reg-\nulatory arranged (distressed) mergers and voluntary (non-distressed) mergers.\nExtending work by Wheelock and Wilson (2000), we do not exclude failed or\ndistressed banks from our analysis. To our knowledge no other studies have\nexamined bank exit due to regulatory intervention. The confidential regula-\ntory information provided by the Bundesbank enables us to obtain a sample\nof merger targets in which failure is not imminent. Rather than calibrating the\ndefinition of distress within the framework of our analysis, we are thereby able\nto make use of the ex ante definitions used by the Bundesbank. In addition,\nwe can benefit from the confidential information gathered by bank examiners.\nConsequently, we significantly reduce dependency problems when we predict\nthe likelihood of different types of (non-)merger events.\n3 Methodology and data\nTo test whether regulatory assisted (distressed) mergers are fundamentally\ndifferent from unassisted mergers, we measure the influences of financial pro-\nfiles on the probability of being involved in a particular type of merger. The\nempirical model allows prediction of multiple events.\n3.1 Empirical specification\nWe assume that banks can experience five distinctly separate events during the\nmerger wave. We further assume that the chances of being involved in an event\nin a given year can be explained by two classes of explanatory covariates. The\nfirst class coincides with a bank's financial profile. The second class considers\nmacroeconomic conditions and other bank characteristics. We predict events\nY = i with a common covariate vector x. We have annual observations for\nour covariates. And we consider it important to allow for the possibility that\nthe different merger events are not entirely independent. This consideration is\nfurther validated by Wheelock and Wilson (2000), who also find that failure\nrisk helps explain acquisitions, when they include the ratio of equity to total\nassets in their acquisition model as a rough proxy. Finally, we consider it\nuseful to allow for the possible existence of serial acquirers. Therefore, we use\na multinomial logit model.\nAs a result, our modelling approach differs from Wheelock and Wilson (2000),\nwho use a Cox proportional hazard model. We consider several additional\nproblems with applying this model in our analysis. First, the time dimension in\nour panel is limited. For the current sample, the maximum number of periods\n(years) until a merger is seven. We can extend this somewhat, but at the\nconsiderable cost of losing many observations for our covariates. Alternatively,\nwe considered measuring merger events on a monthly basis. However, this\nwould create additional problems. We would still have annual observations for\nmost of our covariates. And we may seriously increase measurement problems\nregarding merger events. 8\nFor a number of i = 0, .., J groups, our model is given by Greene (2003) as: 9\np(Y = j) =\nej\nx\nej\nx\n, p(Y = 0) =\nej\nx\nWe normalize by measuring the relative influence of an identical set of covari-\nates x for five different events with respect to a common reference group of no\nevents, where an event is either an assisted (distressed) or unassisted merger.\nEstimated parameters per group, \nj\n, yield the effect of covariates x on the\nlogged ratio of probabilities relative to this reference group, i.e., ln (pj\n)=\n\nj\nx.\n8 As an example, consider the fact that distressed and non-distressed mergers may\nexhibit - different - seasonal patterns.\n9 Other bank merger studies that employ the multinomial logit are Focarelli et\nassumption is that relative probabilities in the multinomial logit model are inde-\npendent from each other, the so-called independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA)\nassumption. To test for IIA, Greene (2003) suggests to specify a nested logit model\nwhere alternative events are grouped on different levels. According to Hausmann\nand McFadden (1984), it is then possible to test the IIA directly, because excluding\nan irrelevant class of events will not lead to consistent estimates. However, we do\nnot specificy a nested logit model as it requires that the choices at a given level are\nmutually exclusive. This is clearly not the case in our study, and we therefore follow\nthe bank merger literature and use the multinomial logit model.\nEstimation requires independence of the observations. In fact, it is unlikely\nthat in our panel setting the observations fulfill this requirement. We there-\nfore relax the independence assumption and utilize a robust estimate of the\nestimated coefficients unchanged but provides robust standard errors of esti-\nmated coefficients. 10\nWe report relative risk ratios (RRR), which measure the change of the prob-\nability of being in group j relative to the probability of being in the reference\ngroup for a one-unit change in the underlying variablex. 11 The RRR for a\none-unit change in covariate x from value a to value a + 1 is as follows: 12\n(a, b) =\np(y = j|x = a)/p(y = 0|x = a)\np(y = j|x = a + 1)/p(y = 0|x = a + 1)\n= ej . (2)\nFor example, an RRRj\nof one is analogous to a zero coefficient. A change\nin the variable does not affect the probability of being in group j relative to\nthe probability of being in the reference group. 13 Likewise, an RRRj\nabove\none indicates an increase of the probability ratio as x increases, and an RRRj\nbelow one implies a declining relative risk to be in group j as x increases. 14\nFor the purpose of our study, it is crucial that we carefully distinguish between\ndistressed and non-distressed merger events. We define a distressed bank as a\nbank which is in danger of ceasing to exist as a going concern without outside\nintervention. In order to identify situations of distress we adopt a set of criteria\ncovering any intervention on the part of the supervisory authority, the auditor\n10 While occasionally (fixed effect) panel estimators for multinomial logit models\nhave been applied in the literature (Boersch-Supan and Pollakowski, 1990), we are\nnot aware of any applications to bank merger analyses. Hosmer and Lemeshow\n(2000) suggest a comparison of cross-sectional and panel estimations for binary\nlogit models. In three out of five binary logit estimations, the estimated variance\ncomponent is tested to be insignificant. We therefore report cross-sectional estima-\ntions with robust standard errors.\n11 References for a more in-depth discussion are provided in Hosmer and Lemeshow\n12 Reported relative risk ratios are therefore exponentiated coefficients. For exam-\nple, an RRR of two implies that a one-unit change in the covariate doubles the\nprobability of being in the event group. All RRRs are available upon request.\n13 In section 4, we report tests for the null hypothesis that a single RRRj\nis equal\nto one.\n14 For ease of exposition, we refer to the probability relative to the reference group.\nor the deposit guarantee scheme, and excessive losses. 15\nWe subdivide our group of distressed banks into those that (i) were distressed\ntargets (DT), (ii) distressed acquirers (DA), or (iii) continued to exist without\nany additional event (intervention only, I). 16 We suspect that those banks\nengaging in mergers without any prior intervention are fundamentally differ-\nent and, therefore, must be modeled as separate events. 17 These banks are\ndesignated as voluntary targets (T) and voluntary acquirers (A). We estimate\nthe likelihood of belonging to one of these groups relative to the same refer-\nence group consisting of all bank observations where none of the above events\noccurred. 18 This control group consists of banks that are neither distressed\nnor involved in a merger (O).\nAnnual pattern of events\nYear DT DA T A I O Total\nDT = distressed target; DA = distressed acquirer; T = (non-distressed) target;\nA = (non-distressed) acquirer; I = intervention only; O = the control group.\nAmel et al. (2004) point out that merger waves are a dynamic process. In fact,\n15 Excessive losses are losses amounting to 25% of liable capital or a negative op-\nerating result in excess of 25% of liable capital. Distressed events result from a\ndisclosure of facts pursuant to section 29(3) of the Banking Act (BA), moratoriums\npursuant to section 46a of the BA and capital preservation measures (including as\na result of restructuring caused by mergers).\n16 We also estimated the model excluding interventions without subsequent merger.\nResults were not affected for the most part.\n17 In line with other failure studies, we also defined distress as capitalization ratios\nclose to regulatory minimum values. However, only a handful of banks had equity\nratios close to regulatory thresholds.\n18 Thus, we also include pre-event observations of banks that ultimately experience\nan event in the control group. Excluding these bank observations did not change\nour results.\nin our sample period a number of banks experienced multiple events. Some\nbanks that acquired another institute subsequently experienced regulatory\nintervention and later became the target in an arranged or assisted merger.\nIn our analysis these banks are grouped as A, then I, and finally as DT.\nBy allowing one bank to experience multiple events, we acknowledge these\ndynamics. 19 Table 1 gives the number of yearly observations for our reference\nand respective event groups. Here we see the increasing momentum of the\nfor about 15 percent of total mergers in the sample period.\n3.3 Explanatory variables\nOur database on distressed versus non-distressed bank merger contains infor-\nmation on the date of a takeover, identity of the acquiring and target institu-\ntions, and date of intervention. All mergers have in common that the target\nceases to exist and no ex post data on the target are available. 20\nWe calculate CAMEL covariates per bank and year. The data are collected\nmainly from balance sheets and profit and loss accounts that are reported\nannually to the supervision department of the Deutsche Bundesbank. With\nthe exception of two banks, no financial data are available for target banks in\nthe year of the merger. 21 For the risk-related covariates, we draw from annual\naudit reports compiled by the Bundesbank, in addition to reports submitted\nby banks pursuant to the Principle I requirements of the 1988 Basle Accord.\nMonthly balance sheet reports are a further source to compute intra-annual\nasset growth.\nWe collect regional macroeconomic covariates that control for the geographical\ndemarcations within the two banking sectors from DeStatis Regional, a data-\nbase supplied by the Land Office for Data Processing and Statistics of North\nRhine-Westphalia. This database provides annual numbers per Bundesland on\n19 Of course, intervention may or may not lead to a merger. In most cases, the time\nthat elapses between an intervention and a merger is very short. In fact, for approxi-\nmately two thirds of our distressed mergers, the intervention and later merger occur\nin the same year. The average time between interventions and either DA or DT is\naround 1.4 years. Only if a merger occurs more than four years after intervention,\ndo we no longer classify it as distressed (but as voluntary). However, changing the\ntime until \"rehabilitation\" has little or no affect on the results.\n20 It should be noted that no transactions involving acquisition of minority stakes or\nmaintenance of the target bank as a separate institute exist among German savings\nand cooperative banks. This is not surprising in view of their public and mutual\nownership, as well as tightly integrated networks.\n21 This data restriction further explains using lagged financial profiles.\npopulation, GDP, and insolvency ratios. Both savings and cooperative banks\nare allowed to operate only in the region to which they are assigned (Greve,\nAs mentioned above, we account for both financial profiles of banks as well\nas the economic conditions under which banks operate. Like previous studies,\nwe use the CAMEL taxonomy as a way to define covariates that constitute\na bank's financial profile. 22 As a result, the financial profile employed in this\nstudy consists of nine key financial ratios that capture (i) Capital adequacy\n(coded ci\n), (ii) Asset quality (ai\n), (iii) Management ability (mi\n), (iv) Earnings\nlevel (ei\n), and (v) Liquidity management (li\n). 23 Furthermore, we employ three\nvariables to capture macroeconomic and bank characteristics, as well as year\nand bank type dummies. All covariates are included with a one year lag. 24\nTable 2 reports the mean values of these variables.\nWe expect improvements in any financial ratio to reduce relative probabilities\non distressed events (i.e., result in an RRR below one). For non-distressed\nevents such inferences are less clear, as they depend on whether targets are\nacquired due to underperformance or cherry picking of profitable banks. As\ndiscussed in the introduction, this issue is unresolved in the literature. Based\non financial performance comparisons in Table 2, we expect that targets are\nacquired due to poor financial profiles, such that improving financial ratios\nincrease the relative probability to become an acquirer.\nWe measure the capitalization of a bank by the ratio of total capital reserves to\n22 CAMEL profiles consists of a list of (financial) indicators used by the U.S. Federal\nReserve Bank to rate banks. Examples of studies employing CAMEL covariates\n23 The universe of financial ratios that are potential candidates for study is far\nlarger than our final selection. Piloff and Santomero (1998) point out the impor-\ntance of acknowledging the lack of a theoretical model in this respect. They argue\nthat rationalization of mergers is frequently subject to different perspectives by in-\nterested parties. For example, bankers consistently motivate mergers by citing scale\neconomies. But empirical evidence fails to confirm this motivation. Given the lack\nof theoretical guidance, we follow the selection approach outlined in Hosmer and\nLemeshow (2000). In brief, we collected a long list of about 200 ratios, for which we\ninspect descriptive and graphical evidence that indicates discriminatory power. We\nexamine each variable's univariate explanatory power in binomial logit analysis for\neach event. Based on this information criterion, we organized a short list of variables\ninto CAMEL categories. We then employed this reduced covariate vector in a multi-\nvariate logit per event category using stepwise regression. From this further reduced\nvector we chose a set of final covariates based on their economic meaningfulness.\n24 We also tested longer lags, but one-year lags yielded stronger discriminatory\npower.\nMean of covariates per event group\nVariable Code DT DA T A I O\nCapital reserve ratio c1\nSecurity share a1\nNet loan loss provision a2\nShare of latent risk loans a3\nAsset growth a4\nProfit efficiency m1\nCost efficiency m2\nReturn on RWA e1\nCash and inter-bank assets l1\nNotes: all variables measured in percentages with a one-year lag unless noted otherwise; 1) in\nthousands of Euros; measured in the event year; 2) in millions of Euros.\ntotal assets, c1\n. 25 The mean capitalization ratio is relatively low for the groups\nDT, I, and DA, and relatively high for the groups T, A and O. Reserves provide\nan important buffer for banks to absorb (for example) a sudden drop in the\nmarket value of securities or other non-traded assets (Hughes and Mester,\n1993). An increase in this buffer may reduce the probability of belonging\nto a distressed group or becoming a voluntary target, unless cherry picking\noccurs, which would have the opposite effect. Likewise, we expect that higher\ncapitalization leads to an increased probability of voluntarily acquiring another\nbank.\nTo capture the influence of asset quality on mergers, we construct four ra-\ntios. Our first covariate is the ratio of securities to risk-weighted assets, a1\n.\nPresumably, banks with higher proportions of securities have higher asset\ndiversification and lower overall asset risk. Table 2 indicates that all banks\ninvolved in events (but especially distressed banks) have shares of securities\nthat are on average below that of the control group. For this reason we expect\n25 Our univariate and stepwise variable selection process favored the use of gross to-\ntal assets as a denominator compared to risk-weighted assets, Basle equity ratios, or\ntotal equity. We capture the influence of risk in the asset quality category discussed\nshortly.\nthat an increase in a1\nleads to lower probabilities of distressed events. Also,\nthe probability of becoming a non-distressed target (acquirer) is likely to be\nsmaller (larger) after an increase in a1\n.\nTo proxy credit risk in the loan portfolio, we employ two ratios. First, we\nuse the ratio of net loan loss provisions to total customer credits, a2\n. This\nratio captures actual credit losses suffered during the pre-event period. Banks\ninvolved in voluntary mergers as well as non-merging banks have low and\napproximately equal mean levels of net loan loss provision. For distressed ac-\nquirers and banks receiving regulatory attention, this variable is substantially\nhigher, while it is highest for distressed targets. Higher losses increase the\nlikelihood of distress and voluntary targets but are expected to decrease the\nprobability of acquiring another bank. The second credit risk covariate, a3\n, is\nthe ratio of loans with higher latent risks according to the Bundesbank audit\nreports relative to total audited loans. This variable is a stock variable and\ntherefore captures the long-run risk profile of the bank when granting credit.\nIn terms of mean levels, a similar dichotomy holds. Non-distressed banks as\nwell as non-merging banks have a low share of latent risk loans, whereas the\nother groups have a relatively high share. Banks that are subject to regulatory\nattention (I) have the highest share of latent risk loans. Our expectations with\nregard to a3\nare the same as for a2\n.\nOur final asset quality covariate is annual asset growth, a4\n. This variable cap-\ntures the risk of either expanding business activities too rapidly (to manage\ngrowth prudently) or too slowly (to keep pace with competitive pressures).\nSample mean growth rates shown in Table 2 for all categories are below the\nmean of non-merging banks, especially both groups of targets and banks re-\nceiving intervention only. Hence, we expect that increases in this covariate lead\nto lower probabilities of becoming involved in distressed and non-distressed\nevents.\nTo proxy for managerial skill, many studies employ key performance indi-\ncators, such as cost-income ratios (e.g., see Rhoades, 1993). We argue that\nsuch covariates are an inferior proxy for two reasons. First, these measures are\nprone to accounting rule-induced distortions. For example, we know that cost\nincome ratios of savings banks are systematically below average due to fund-\ning advantages associated with government ownership. Second, these ratios\nmight reflect market circumstances, rather than managerial skill. If, for exam-\nple, an idiosyncratic shock hits a region, cost-income ratios will rise. Clearly,\nsuch a ratio does not proxy for management quality. As an alternative, we\nemploy profit and cost efficiency estimates, m1\n. These measures are\nderived from a bank production model using stochastic frontier analysis. 26 In\nthis model observed costs (profits) can differ from estimated best-practice cost\n26 The appendix provides technical details.\n(profits) for two reasons: (i) deviations can be attributable to random noise\n(e.g., measurement error); and (ii) deviations can result from systematically\nemploying sub-optimal combinations of input quantities to produce outputs,\nthereby leading the bank to incur too high costs (too low profits). The lat-\nter deviations are due to inefficiency and proxy (lack of) managerial skill. 27\nNote that two banks exhibiting identical returns on equity can be different in\nterms of employing in- and outputs in the correct proportion to realize that\nprofit. 28 From Table 2, we observe that acquiring banks and banks in the con-\ntrol group both exhibit high profit and cost efficiency, while distressed banks\nhave low profit and cost efficiency. Banks in the voluntary target group have\non average relatively low profit efficiency but high cost efficiency. We expect\nthat an increase in efficiency is associated with a lower probability of distress.\nRegarding non-distressed events, decreased (increased) efficiency is expected\nto correspond to a higher probability of being a target (acquirer).\nTo measure earnings we use operating return over risk-weighted assets, e1.\nThis covariate measures profitability on a risk-adjusted basis. Again, distressed\nbanks have low earnings ratios, non-distressed banks have relatively high earn-\nings ratios. We expect that higher earnings decrease the chances of distress.\nLikewise, we expect an increase of earnings to render a bank more (less) likely\nto be an acquirer (target).\nThe final CAMEL covariate refers to the liquidity position of a given bank. We\nuse the ratio equal to the sum of cash and inter-bank assets to risk-weighted\nassets, l1\n. 29 Liquidity is a buffer, and can help absorb sudden cash-outflows.\nMean liquidity in distressed target banks is very high, while in acquiring banks\nand non-merging banks it is quite low. Mean liquidity of the other groups falls\nin between. However, excessive cash holdings imply poor returns as these assets\nnormally have low yields. Thus, the effect of an increase in liquidity depends\non the level of liquidity holdings.\nTable 2 indicates that distressed and non-distressed targets exhibit higher\naverage liquidity than non-merging banks. Hence, we expect an increase of\nliquidity to result in a higher probability of being involved in a distressed\nevent and becoming a non-distressed target. Likewise, we expect that the\nprobability of acquiring another bank is lower.\n27 For a comprehensive discussion of alternative frontier models, we refer the reader\n28 Put differently, the inefficient bank might have realized higher returns with the\nobserved input-output combination at its disposal.\n29 A preferable alternative would have been the Principle II liquidity ratio that\nis reported for each bank in the supervision departments audit report (Deutsche\nBundesbank, 2002). Unfortunately, data for this ratio were not available before\nIn addition to bank-specific financial profiles, Porath (2004) emphasizes the\nimportance of macroeconomic conditions on bank performance. Our first macro-\neconomic variable captures the private sector by GDP per capita, GDP. The\nvariation in mean levels of GDP per capita across groups is low. We expect that\ndistress is less likely under good economic conditions. Higher income fosters\ndemand for financial products. Also, outstanding assets (e.g. customer loans)\nare at lower risk of failing. To capture the effect of economic conditions in the\nbusiness sector on bank merger probability, we also include the percentage of\ninsolvent non-financial firms, INS. Mean levels of insolvency ratios are high for\nall distressed banks, and relatively low for the non-distressed banks. As the\ncommercial customer base of banks suffers from adverse economic conditions,\nwe expect that banks will be increasingly exposed to distress. 30\nA number of studies on bank mergers (Worthington, 2004; Wheelock and\nare less likely to be taken over. To account for differences in size, we include\nthe log of risk-weighted total assets, RWA, as a final bank characteristic.\nThe most important observation with regard to differences in mean levels of\nrisk-weighted assets is not between distressed and non-distressed banks, but\nbetween targets and acquirers. The average size of target banks is substantially\nlower than that of all other banks. 31\nWe begin this section by assessing the appropriateness of our choice of co-\nvariates. Next, we provide results for the multinomial logit model. Finally, we\ntest for differences between distressed and non-distressed events and between\nacquirers and targets, respectively.\n4.1 Explanatory power\nHosmer and Lemeshow (2000) suggest various approaches for evaluating the\nexplanatory power of logit models. Since the primary interest of this study is\n30 The principle of the so-called Hausbank approach together with relationship lend-\ning is confirmed by Elsass and Krahnen (2004). They find that savings and coopera-\ntive banks \". . . develop an informationally intense relationship with their customers,\nand that these special relationships are common among mid-sized firms.\"\n31 We also include indicator variables for the respective year and banking group to\ncontrol for systematic differences between the two groups in terms of size, business\nfocus, and sheer number of banks (and events).\nto identify a financial profile that discriminates between distressed and non-\ndistressed merger events, we wish to find the set of covariates that categorizes\nobservations with highest possible accuracy. 32 Given that we estimate a con-\ntinuous probability that events fall into discrete categories, the discriminatory\npower of our model depends on the cutoff probability level beyond which pre-\ndicted values are assigned to a specific group.\nTo evaluate the discriminatory power of the model over a range of cutoff lev-\nels, we employ the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC)\ncurve. The area under the ROC curve (AUR) measures the percentage of\ncorrectly classified events (sensitivity) versus one minus the percentage of cor-\nrectly classified non-events (specificity). According to Hosmer and Lemeshow,\nare good, and higher values are outstanding. 33\nArea under the ROC curve for event groups\nControl Group Event DT DA T A I\nNotes: AUR = Area under the ROC curve;  = significant at the 1% level; number of observations\nbetween brackets.\nTable 3 depicts AUR values for various multivariate, binomial logit models. 34\nWe use the entire vector of CAMEL and other covariates for each possible com-\nbination of event and reference group. Columns coincide with event groups and\nrows with the respective control group. Estimations for distressed acquirers\n32 For example, a prediction model requires careful calibration of the model and out\nof sample testing.\n33 Note that perfect discrimination is not possible as it would prohibit estimation.\n34 Assessing the fit of a multinomial model by means of single variable logit analysis\n(DA), voluntary targets (T), voluntary acquirers (A), and intervention only (I)\ncontrol groups exclude non-event observations. AUR values between 0.826 and\n0.964 indicate that our model is well suited to differentiate distressed targets\nfrom distressed acquirers, voluntary mergers, and interventions, respectively.\nAlso note that the standard errors of the AUR values are fairly low. From this\nevidence we infer that the chances of becoming a distressed target is explained\nquite well by the covariates. At the bottom of Table 3, we also provide results\nfrom a single logit model predicting distressed targets relative to a reference\ngroup of strictly non-merging banks. 35 The AUR value of 0.943 is in line\nwith other information criteria (e.g., a pseudo R2 of 0.447) and supports the\nexplanatory power of the model. 36\nWe obtain similar results when modeling distressed acquirers as an event\ngroup. Depending on the choice of a reference group, AUR values (in col-\nHence, the ability of our covariates to identify distressed acquirers is fairly\nstrong.\nFor the two voluntary merger events, T and A, the explanatory power of\nour model is slightly lower. Nonetheless, AUR values ranging from 0.772 and\n0.864 support the inference that the covariates can explain different merger\nevents. 37 Lastly, we find AUR values close to 0.9 for interventions without\na later merger, which means that the covariates explain these events fairly\naccurately despite a relatively low number of observations.\n4.2 Degrees of difference\nIn this section we discuss the multinomial logit model results. In Table 4\nwe report RRR scores for each event. The reference group consists of bank\n35 Note that, unlike the multinomial model, this model excludes non-event observa-\ntions that later merge from the control group.\n36 Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000) caution not to rely entirely on R2. The assess-\nment of a model's goodness-of-fit should examine how well the choice of covariates\ncan predict an event to occur and the ability of the model to correctly classify an\nobservation as event or non-event.\n37 We also estimated our model with single covariates, and found that only four out\nof twelve covariates exhibit AUR values as high as 0.6. These results are available\nupon request. We further test whether the difference of financial ratios' means is\nsignificant. Given the non-normality of financial ratios, we use a Kruskall-Wallis\ntest (1952a, 1952b) and find for each variable that at least one difference between\ngroups is significantly different from zero.\nobservations without any event. 38 Since we are interested in whether the entire\nfinancial profile for each group significantly predicts the type of event, for each\ngroup we test the null hypothesis that all coefficients are simultaneously equal\nto zero. Reported Wald test statistics yield significant financial profiles for all\ngroups. Recall that the reported RRR measures the change in the probability\nof membership in one group relative to the probability of not merging at all\nfor a one-unit change of the variable.\nRelative risk ratios for event groups\nVariable Code DT DA T A I\nCapital reserve ratio c1\nSecurity share a1\nNet loan loss provision a2\nShare of latent risk loans a3\nAsset growth a4\nProfit efficiency m1\nCost efficiency m2\nReturn on RWA e1\nCash and inter-bank assets l1\nUnless otherwise indicated, all variables are measured in percentages.

To conserve space these\nresults are not reported but are available upon request.\nof becoming an acquirer. Our results generally confirm this hypothesis. In\naddition, the sensitivity to changes in capitalization is highest for the group of\ndistressed targets, followed by the intervention group and distressed acquirers.\nIn four out of five cases, the RRR score is significantly different from one, with\nthe correct sign. The modest sensitivity for the group of voluntary targets does\nnot support the existence of a strong cherry picking effect. While the RRR\nfor the group of non-distressed acquirer is in line with expectations, it is not\nsignificantly different from one.\nNext we consider asset quality. With respect to the security share, a1\n, we hy-\npothesized earlier an increase to yield lower probabilities for distressed events\nand voluntary targets. Also, we expected a higher probability for acquisitions\nto occur as a consequence of such a change. Table 4 shows that the estimated\nRRRs for the security share variable are between 0.96 and 0.99. Estimates\nare significant for all groups except for those banks that receive intervention\nwithout subsequent merger activities. The magnitude of the sensitivity shows\nthat this effect is quantitatively unimportant. Contrary to our expectation,\nthe probability of becoming a voluntary acquirer is negatively influenced by\nthe security share. A tentative explanation of the result that higher security\nshares lower the probability of being involved in any merger may be that espe-\ncially larger banks tend to hold high security shares and remain independent.\nThis requires further research.\nAccording to Greve (2002), cooperative (and savings) banks have traditionally\nfocused on providing credit finance to small commercial and private borrow-\ners. Increasing competition has reduced interest margins and rendered these\nactivities unattractive (Molyneux et al., 1996). The monthly reports of the\nDeutsche Bundesbank (2003) confirm this development. We suspect that the\ngrowing need to generate income from alternative sources caused some banks\nto expand their securities trading activities. The impact of an increase in the\nshare of securities is identical across all merger events in terms of direction,\nwhich may reflect this trend.\nAn increase in the net loan loss provision, a2\n, is expected to increase the prob-\nability of becoming distressed and becoming a target, while it is expected to\ndecrease the probability of becoming an acquirer. This is confirmed by signif-\nicant RRRs above one for all groups except non-distressed acquirers. We find\nno significant effect of loan loss provision changes on the likelihood of becom-\ning an acquirer. An increase by one percentage point of a2\nincrease in the probability of being involved in a distressed event. Thus, this\nmeasure is among the more important determinants of mergers in Germany.\nHigh sensitivities of increasing a2\nfor distressed events are in line with common\npractice in the literature that defines distress on the basis of this indicator.\nSignificantly higher mean loan loss provisions (see Table 2) tend to trigger\nregulatory attention. Non-distressed targets may be motivated to merge by\ntheir respective head organization in order to avoid further regulatory atten-\ntion. The necessity for increased write-offs could indicate adverse conditions\n(e.g., a harvest in a particular region lost due to flood). 39 The insignificant\nRRR for acquirers implies that net loan loss provisions for these banks are\nnot substantially different from those of non-merging banks. Consequently,\nthis observation does not support the notion that acquirers are financially\nhealthier banks compared to the non-merging bank population.\nWe expect a higher share of latent risk loans a3\nto increase the probability of\nbecoming distressed and voluntary targets and to decrease the probability of\nacquiring another bank. The RRR is insignificant for both distressed and non-\ndistressed acquirers. The sensitivity for the remaining groups is substantially\nlower compared to RRR for a2\n. We therefore conclude that latent risk loans,\n, are a less important indicator of distressed events than loan loss provisions,\n. Again, no evidence in favor of cherry picking is found.\nWe expect higher asset growth rates, a4\nto imply lower probabilities of being\ninvolved in distressed events. In addition, we expect higher growth rates to de-\ncrease the probability of being a voluntary target and increase the probability\nof being a voluntary acquirer. Table 4 shows that RRR estimates for annual\ngrowth of total assets, a4\n, are below one for both distressed and voluntary\nmergers. This implies that an increase in the growth rate leads to a lower like-\nlihood of merging. With the exception of distressed acquirers, all RRRs are\nsignificantly different from one. As found previously, the sensitivity to changes\nin growth is largest for group DT but the difference from group T is small. The\nevidence indicates that savings and cooperative banks prefer internal growth\nstrategies. Only if internal growth is too slow is an acquisition considered as\na means of growing in line with non-distressed competitors. In sum, we infer\nthat banks that experience below average growth are more likely to merge.\nExceptionally low growth is associated with becoming a target in a merger.\nDecreasing cost and profit efficiency are expected to lead to higher probabilities\nof becoming involved in a distressed event and becoming a target. This is in\nline with the efficient management hypothesis, which states that owners will\nultimately replace managers that employ scarce resources inefficiently with\nmore competent personnel (e.g., see Roll, 1986).\nIn Table 4, we see that estimates of the RRRs for profit and cost efficiency,\n, are significantly below one for all distressed events. This supports\nthe hypothesis that higher efficiency decreases the chances of experiencing a\ndistressed event. Cost efficiency RRRs are lower than profit efficiency RRRs\namong distressed banks. Moreover, the estimated RRR for non-distressed tar-\ngets significantly less than one suggests that profit efficiency influences the\nflooded a number of new Bundeslaender.\nprobability of falling into group T. The sensitivity is relatively small at an\nRRR of 0.984 but is identical to that of distressed mergers.\nTogether, the results for m1\nlend some support for the efficient manage-\nment hypothesis, despite the absence of an equity-based market for corporate\ncontrol. The fact that lower efficiency increases the probability of becoming a\nvoluntary target suggest that non-distressed institutions merge to forestall reg-\nulatory intervention. In this regard, while local savings and cooperative banks\nare not legally required to comply with their respective head organizations,\nour results suggest that they likely play a role in the merger process. 40\nWe expect that increased earnings lead to a lower probability of distress and\ntakeover and a higher probability of acquiring another bank. Our estimates\nfor RRRs for earnings, e1\n, are consistent with these expectations. Sensitivity\nis highest for interventions only, followed by distressed targets, and distressed\nacquirers. In fact, this covariate discriminates quite well between all event\ngroups, with the exception of non-distressed targets. For both non-distressed\nevents we find that higher earnings increase the probability of merging.\nWe expect that increases of cash and inter-bank assets, l1\n, increase the prob-\nability of becoming involved in a distressed merger or becoming a voluntary\ntarget. Assuming that acquirers are capable of better cash-management, we\nexpect the opposite effect for this group. The RRR is significant for all non-\ndistressed events and for distressed targets. The direction of the effect is con-\nsistent with our hypotheses, but small in magnitude.\nWe have few priors as to whether distressed and non-distressed mergers are\nmore or less likely to occur in relatively wealthy areas. Our results show that\nthe RRR of state GDP per capita is significantly below one for both non-\ndistressed events and for distressed acquirers. In adition, the magnitude of\nthese RRRs suggests that this covariate is an important determinant of merger\nactivity. Perhaps this variable captures the different stages in the consolidation\nprocess in the wealthy western states and the relatively poor eastern states.\nWe expect higher insolvency ratios to increase the probability of distressed\nevents and to decrease the probability of voluntary mergers. Our results indi-\ncate that insolvencies only have significant effect on the probability of being\ninvolved in a non-distressed merger. Only insignificant effects are found for\ndistressed events.\n40 Siebert (2004) and others have argued that corporate governance in Germany\nfollows principles of co-determination and consensus rather than reliance on market\nmechanisms. Wengerer and Kaserer (1998) point out that this corporate governance\nsystem may shield bank managers from the threat of being replaced by a more\nefficient management. Our evidence does not support these arguments.\nOur last covariate measures the size of the banking firm. We hypothesize\nthat large firms are more likely to become acquirers than targets. The RRR\nscores are large and significant for all groups and discriminates especially well\nbetween targets and acquirers. More specifically, an increase in size by one\nmillion euros implies a bank is almost twice as likely to become an acquirer.\nBy contrast, chances of becoming a target are almost halved. This relation\nis identical in direction for both distressed and non-distressed events. Thus,\nboth in distressed and non-distressed transactions, sheer size is an important\ndeterminant of whether a merging bank is a surviving (acquiring) or ceasing\n(acquired) institution.\nOur multinomial logit model results can be summarized as follows. Financial\nprofiles can explain merger events with high accuracy. Distressed events are\ndifferent from non-distressed events, and acquirers are different from targets.\nHowever, differences between groups are reflected to a greater extent in the\nmagnitude of effects rather than their direction. 41 The covariates that show\nthe largest absolute and relatively sensitivities and thus are most important\nin explaining different events and discriminating between groups, are capital-\nization net loan loss provision, earnings and size.\n4.3 Significance of differences\nGiven that the differences between estimated RRRs are relatively small, a nat-\nural question is whether sensitivities differ significantly between groups. While\nthe tests conducted so far reject the hypothesis that respective groups' pro-\nfiles are jointly equal to zero, it remains unclear if single covariate and entire\nprofile effects are different between groups. We tackle this issue by examining\nwhether single covariates and entire financial profiles differ significantly be-\ntween distressed and non-distressed mergers, as well as between acquirers and\nTo this end, we report four different tests. First, we test whether each co-\nvariate's RRR is equal for the distressed and non-distressed targets. Second,\nwe test whether the RRR for each single covariate is equal for distressed and\nnon-distressed acquirers. Third, we test whether the RRR for each single co-\nvariate is equal for distressed targets and distressed acquirers. Fourth, we test\nwhether the RRR for each single covariate is equal for voluntary targets and\n41 In this respect, our results nicely complement Oshinsky and Olin (2005), who\nreport similar findings when comparing recovery, mergers and continuation.\n42 We also tested all possible combinations between groups that are presented in\nTable 1 (i.e., nine combinations). In tests of equality between DT versus I and DA\nversus I, five out of twelve covariates are significantly different.

The variables asset growth, profit efficiency, and GDP per capita are no\ndifferent for targets merging with and without distress. Overall, the last row\nindicates that the RRRs of distressed targets are significantly different from\nthose of non-distressed targets. These results demonstrate the importance of\ndifferentiating between merger targets on the basis of distress.\nTurning to the results for acquirers, five out of twelve covariates have RRRs\nthat are not significantly different between distressed and non-distressed ac-\nquirers. In addition to the previously identified three covariates, the share\nof loans with higher latent risks and bank size are no different between the\n43 We also tested whether distressed mergers are different from non-distressed merg-\ners (abstracting from whether a bank was target or acquirer).

The fact that the remaining seven covariates differ significantly\nbetween the two groups explains why the hypothesis of joint equality of all pa-\nrameters is rejected. We infer that non-distressed acquirers have significantly\nstronger financial profiles than distressed acquirers.\nNext, we compare acquirers and targets. In Table 5 we report tests of whether\nthe RRRs of (distressed) targets and acquirers are equal. The p-values of Wald\ntests for each covariate and the all CAMEL covariates are provided there. In\ngeneral, half of the covariates' effects differ significantly between distressed\ntargets and acquirers. The estimated RRRs for net loan loss provision, the\ntwo efficiency measures, return on RWA, liquidity and the insolvency ratio do\nnot differ significantly. On the other hand, we find that capitalization ratios,\nsecurity shares, asset growth, latent risk loan share and size are significantly\ndifferent between the two groups.\nThe importance of accounting for different financial profiles is more pro-\nnounced among non-distressed mergers. In Table 5, all but two covariates are\nsignificantly different between voluntary targets and acquirers. The last row\nshows that all covariates are also jointly significantly different. We infer that\nvoluntary targets have financial profiles that are more like distressed banks\nthan like other non-distressed banks.\nOverall, the conclusion must be that focussing only on distressed versus non-\ndistressed banks is insufficient in a merger analysis. In addition, targets and\nacquirers have significantly different financial profiles and sensitivities to ex-\nplanatory variables.\n5 Conclusion\nThis paper investigates the possible bias that exists in studies of bank merger\ndeterminants when not appropriately controlling for the existence of hidden\nbailouts. We distinguish between five possible events, including distressed tar-\ngets and acquirers, non-distressed targets and acquirers, and banks subject\nto only regulatory intervention. After specifying a vector of bank-specific and\nenvironmental covariates, we estimate a multinomial logit model in order to\npredict the probability of becoming a (distressed) target, a (distressed) ac-\nquirer, or a bank that experiences intervention but continues to exist.\nWe find some evidence that supports the efficient management hypothesis. By\nimplication, regulatory authorities and head organizations of cooperative and\nsavings banks appear to play important roles in the disposition of distressed\nGerman bank mergers. Despite sharing below average profiles, merging banks\nthat are targets are different from acquirers. The probability of entering a\nspecific group is largely determined by sheer size and to a lesser extent by\ncapitalization. In general, larger banks that experienced intervention later be-\ncame an acquirer (rather than target) in subsequent mergers. Hence, size is the\ncrucial factor that determines the role a merging bank assumes in the merger.\nMore importantly, both distressed and non-distressed merging banks have\nlower capital reserve ratios than non-merging banks, lower exposure to se-\ncurities business, higher credit risk as measured by net loan loss provisioning,\nand below average efficiency. Sensitivities to changes in these covariates are\nnormally of a lesser magnitude for voluntary mergers, but the direction of co-\nvariates' impact on distressed and non-distressed events is identical for nine\nout of twelve covariates. Even for voluntary acquirers, we find only limited ev-\nidence that improving financial profiles increases the probability of belonging\nto this group.\nOur results provide evidence that merger events in general are more likely\nto occur among banks that exhibit relatively bad financial profiles. For dis-\ntressed mergers this finding is consistent with expectations. However, we also\nfind that non-distressed mergers involve underperforming banks, which may\nmean that voluntary mergers are motivated by pre-emptive distress resolution\nconsiderations, rather than cherry picking of top performing banks. It also\nconfirms the findings of Rhodes-Kropf and Robinson (2004), who find that\nmergers typically pair together firms that perform similarly, compared to the\nmarket.\nWe conclude from these findings that the recent consolidation in German\nbanking is associated with underperforming target and acquirer institutions\nperhaps seeking to avoid potential future financial distress. Given that a con-\nsiderable portion of non-distressed mergers may have been motivated by the\nintention to avoid more severe problems, we consider an analysis of the success\nof both distressed and non-distressed mergers an important topic for future\nresearch.\nReferences\nAkhavein, J.D., A.N.

To\nconserve space we only overview the cost model. 45 We assume that banks min-\nimize costs, operate in perfect markets, 46 and produce inputs and outputs per\nthe intermediation approach 47 .\nWe define three outputs ym\nsubject to fixed prices. Banks choose input quanti-\nties given factor costs. We specify three inputs purchased at prices t\ni\n. For bank\nk input-output combinations are produced at observed costs Ck\nHughes and Mester (1993), we specify equity capital z to account for different\nrisk profiles of banks. Output quantities and input prices are obtained from\nBundesbank accounts for cooperative and savings banks for the years 1993 to\nOutput quantities are year-end stocks. We calculate input prices as factor pay-\nments divided by input quantities. The price of fixed assets equals depreciation\nover fixed assets, the price of labor equals personnel expenses over number of\nfull time equivalent employees, and the price of borrowed funds equals interest\nexpense over total borrowed funds, respectively.\nFollowing Lang and Welzel (1966), we use a translog functional form including\na time trend variables. The cost frontier is written as: 49\nln TOCk\n(w, y, z) = a0\n+\nI\nai\nlnxikt\nI\nJ\naij\nlnxikt\nln xjkt\n+ k\nHere x consists of outputs y, input prices w, control variables z and a time\n44 SFA was developed by Aigner, Lovell and Schmidt (1977), Meeusen and van der\nex-post effects of merger include Kohers et al. (2000) and Akhavein et al. (1997).\n45 Since the profit model is analogous, we use footnotes to review methodological\ndifferences.\n46 For the profit model we follow the alternative profit approach proposed by\nHumphrey and Pulley (1997). In brief, banks continue to face perfect input markets,\nbut on the output side they are allowed limited price discretion as reflected by an\nadditional pricing opportunity constraint in the maximization problem.\n47 For a discussion of bank production, see Freixas and Rochet (1997).\n48 In the alternative profit approach the dependent variable is profits before tax, or\n.\n49 We use maximum likelihood estimation to obtain both parameter estimates for\nequation (3) and the error components. We impose homogeneity of degree one in\ninput prices and symmetry, following Lang and Welzel (1996).\nDescriptive statistics for variables employed in SFA analysis\nVariable Mean Std. Dev. Min. Max.\n* measured in millions of Euros; ** measured in percentages; ***measured in thousands of Euros;\ntrend t. The composed error k\nconsists of random noise component, v, and a\nsystematic inefficiency component labeled u. Following Stevenson (1980), we\nassume that the random component v is i.i.d. N(0, v\n). For the inefficiency\npart we assume that u is i.i.d. N|(\u00b5, u\n)|. As cost inefficient banks operate\nabove the efficient frontier the latter term is added to random deviations,\nresulting in a composed error of the form k\n= vk\n+ uk\n.\nAfter estimation of the cost and profit frontier we use the approach suggested\nby Jondrow et al. (1982) to derive firm-specific efficiency estimates. We obtain\nfirm-specific efficiency estimates as the expected value of inefficiency condi-\ntional on total error. Like Coelli et al. (1998), we calculate efficiency scores by\nusing:\n= [exp(-^\nuk\n)] .\nThe estimated cost and profit efficiency scores are referred to as CAMEL\ncovariates m1\n, respectively.\nThe following Discussion Papers have been published since 2004:\nSeries 1: Economic Studies\n1 2004 Foreign Bank Entry into Emerging Economies:\nAn Empirical Assessment of the Determinants\nand Risks Predicated on German FDI Data Torsten Wezel\n2 2004 Does Co-Financing by Multilateral Development\nBanks Increase \"Risky\" Direct Investment in\nEmerging Markets? \u00ad\nEvidence for German Banking FDI Torsten Wezel\n3 2004 Policy Instrument Choice and Non-Coordinated Giovanni Lombardo\nMonetary Policy in Interdependent Economies Alan Sutherland\nin an Asymmetric Currency Area Giovanni Lombardo\n5 2004 FDI versus cross-border financial services: Claudia M.
